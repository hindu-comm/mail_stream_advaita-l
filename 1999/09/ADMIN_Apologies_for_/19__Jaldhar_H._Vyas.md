I went on a short vacation over the Labor Day weekend and came back to
find the SCSI controller on advaita-vedanta.org's host machine had fried.
As a result the list and the website were unavailable from late Friday
through yesterday.  Luckily I had a spare so everything is fixed now.
Apologies for any inconvenience this may have caused.
