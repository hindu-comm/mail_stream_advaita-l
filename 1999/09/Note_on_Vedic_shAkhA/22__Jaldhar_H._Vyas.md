I'm talking about the VHP crowd.  I've met a lot of them over the years
and none have impressed me with knowing very much about what they are
supposedly defending.  (Sorry, hating Muslims doesn't make you a good
Hindu.) For me that's the test of any Guru or movement. Is it actualy
reducing ignorance or increasing it?  Frawley wrote a book called "Arise O
Bharata" or something like that which was filled with the standard
nationalist drivel.  Naturally they liked that a lot but I am the only one
who sees the irony in cultural chauvinists depending on a foreigner to
guide them?

Earlier you had written you felt disconnected from our traditions.  I
sympathise with that because I was in the same situation once.  So let's
get reconnected!  There are plenty of people and plenty of material
available nowadays to help.  For instance if you want to know about the
Vedas, Swami Chandrashekhar Bharati of Shringeri wrote a book in English
by that title which was published by the Bhartiya Vidya Bhavan.  It should
be available from them or in the library.  And you can bet it won't come
attached to any political agenda.

Most list members are busy people.  I urge you all to not waste your time
fishing for brass when you could easily have gold.
