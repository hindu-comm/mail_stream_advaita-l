As it was pointed out, you are referring to one variant of ganesha
gAyatri, but the other one I have known is

tatpurushhaaya vidmahe vakratuNDAya dhiimahi |
tanno dantiH prachodayaat.h ||

Regarding your question on  the order of names in
praNamya ... shlokam,  it may be just for poetic beauty. Other
possibility is something subtle and very important may be coded in that
poem, so that it could serve a mnemonic. Like the verse 32 of
saundrayalahari has panchadashi coded in it.


I learnt this by memory (thanks to Anand posting in 1996), but I find
the sequence of this number and names makes it difficult to convert it
into nAmAvaliH like format. OTOH, verses like rAmAya rAmabhadrAya .. or
laitAsahasranAmam (where the names are just stringed together) render
themselves easily for such a conversion. One can memorize sahasrnAmam,
and then say AUM shrImAtre namaH , AUM shrImahArAjn~yai namaH, .. and
so on. But this one even though it is brief, makes me pause a lot.

In anycase, these shloka-s are a delight to memorize and especially
considering our sequential access in brain working more efficiently
that the random access.

BTW, Giri page has a detailed meaning on this praNamya verse (was it
based on Grimes' book?)
