Namaste Vivek
    As per my knoledge Gayatri is  the name of a chandas (one of the ways
to form the sentence in sanskrit)
    Gayatri Mantra inspires wisdom. Its meaning is that "May the Almighty
God illuminate our intellect to lead us along the righteous path".
    Chanting of gayatri mantra inspires the inner Consciousness. It
improves the innerstrength to fight against the odds of our daily life
 The mantra should not be chanted loudly. The reason behind that is the
gayatri mantra is a very sacred one. It should be given or taught to a
person who is not eligible or competent for the same. If it is taught to a
incompetent person the effect will on both the teacher and the student.
A pause should be given after each and every chant. In our vedic way there
is a particular way to chant each and every mantra. There wiil be
aanganyasa and karanyasas for the mantra. You should get your self
initiated to the mantra from a guru. Ofcourse each every bhramhin will be
initiated into this sacred gayatri mantra by our father (guru).
