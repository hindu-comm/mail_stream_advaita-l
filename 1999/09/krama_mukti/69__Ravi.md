Does not this verse from vivekachuuDamaNi contradict
krama mukti?


vadantu shaastraaNi yajantu devaan.h
    kurvantu karmaaNi bhajantu devataaH  |
aatmaikyabodhena vinaapi muktiH
    na sidhyati brahmashataantare.api  || 6 ||

 Let one read the sastras, sacrifice to the gods, perform karmas
or meditate on the divinities; liberation will not arise even
after hundreds of brahmakalpas without knowledge of the Unity of
brahman

--
verse and meaning quoted from archives (posted by Vaidya).

Of course, one could argue that the purpose of this verse is to
motivate the student to embark on aatma vichaara and seek
liberation by quicker and direct approach, and not necessarily to
contradict krama mukti.

Please do correct me.
