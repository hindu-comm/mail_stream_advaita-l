I dont know if it contradicts krama mukthi or not, but I can tell you
bhajantu devataaH  does not contradict bakthi.

Naradha Bakthi Sutra makes it very clear.

TatrApi na mAhAtmya jnAna  vismrtyapavAdA :  22

(Gopies although worshipping krishna as their beloved) Never forgot this
divine nature.

 Tad vihinam jArAnAm iva    23

With out that knowledge of atmaikya (this approach) is perishable (Similar
to the base passion of a mistress for her paramour).
I think  aatmaikyabodhena vinaapi muktiH na sidhyati brahmashataantare.api
 also means the same.

I think the purpose of this  vivekachuuDamaNi  verse is to clearly state
that essence of all means sastra, sacrifice, karma or bhajana is to get
aatmaikya bodhana which bestows one with mukthi.

The word  vina , according to my understanding clearly states with out
which, so only the criterion is being emphasized, Karma or yajna or bhajana
is not criticized.In fact they are recognized.
Please do correct me if in case I am wrong.
