Last section of brahmasUtra bhAshya. The saguNopAsaka is said to go to
brahmaloka, where they are said to stay till pralaya - te brahmaloke tu
parAntakAle parAmRtAt parimucyanti sarve. For one who knows nirguNa brahman
as the essential brahman, there is no going anywhere - na tasya prANA
utkrAmanti.

That is how the following quotation makes sense.

Note the words tad ASraya - the goal of saguNopAsana is dependent upon the
essential reality of Brahman as nirguNa.

There is no contradiction in it, is there? It is not as there is one Brahman
that is saguNa and another, different Brahman that is nirguNa. Rather, the
nirguNa is the innermost, the essential core of what is considered saguNa.

The issue is one of knowing and grasping Brahman in the essential nature, as
opposed to describing Brahman through limiting adjuncts.

The distinction lies in the guNas. ISvara is beyond the guNas, but the human
mind has a great difficulty in understanding this.

Because of the above mentioned difficulty in understanding nirguNa brahma.
The goal of upAsana is to understand the guNas and to go beyond them, to
know ISvara in essence and in entirety.

Note the definition of Bhakti here is something different from what the
average (wo)man considers as Bhakti.

Strictly speaking, there can be no contemplation on the nirguNa, as the
nirguNa is a state of being, not a state of becoming or of experiencing. But
there is nothing contradictory in the saguNa leading to the nirguNa.
