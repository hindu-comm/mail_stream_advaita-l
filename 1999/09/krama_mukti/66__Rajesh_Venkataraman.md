Krishna himself says in the Bhagavad Gita that Bhakti is of 4 kinds
1.Artha bhakti - bhakti of a person in distress
2.arthArthI bhakti - bhakti of a person seeking material well being
3. jijnAsu bhakti - bhakti of a person seeking liberated person
4. jnAni bhakti - the bhakti of a liberated person.

Only the orientation of bhakti varies but bhakti always remains. But the
fact remains that the first two and even the third kind are of a lower kind
than the fourth. And it is also true that a person cannot go to the fourth
without passing through the first 3 stages. So they can never be belittled.
