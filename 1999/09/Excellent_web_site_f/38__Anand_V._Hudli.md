 This is the home page of the Siddhivinayaka temple in Mumbai. The
 characteristic feature of this Ganesh is that the trunk is bent
 towards the right instead of the left which is common.

 The web site states that the kalasha-sthApana and kuMbha-abhishheka
 of the temple in its current form was done by none other than
 Shri Bharati Tirtha, the Shankaracharya of Shringeri, in 1994.
 The temple itself is about 200 hundred years old.

 You will find a great deal of information on Ganesha, including
 the Ashta-vinayaka's, free Ganesh greeting cards, free audio downloads
 of stotras, and hymns, and much more.
