In the latest digest, I found  the posting
Sankara SampradhAyam - 10 appearing three times.
On Mon & Tue, my server returned these postings
with the message that 'advaita.org' is inaccessible.

That is why I resent it again today. But, all the
three have appeared.

I apologize for the inconvenience.

Regards,

Sudhakar
