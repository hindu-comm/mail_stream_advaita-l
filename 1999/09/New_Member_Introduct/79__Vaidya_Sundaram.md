Thank you for you prompt response.  I became interested in Yoga a few years
ago and later began meditation. Finally I attended Satsang and began study
under Guru Devananda. (Divine Life Society) I consider myself a sadhak and
also a devotee of Swmaji Shivananda and Swamaji Chidananda.

I am 61 years old, university educated and wish learn as much as I can.  I
hope that you will pardon my ignorance.
