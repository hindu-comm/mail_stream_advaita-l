I have received a few private e-mail queries about the online availability
of Jonathan Bader's book. Various booksellers quote different prices for
it. Search for "Aditya Prakashan" or "Bader" or "Jonathan Bader" on the
respective websites. There is a good collection of websites of publishers
and booksellers at <http://www.ucl.ac.uk/~ucgadkw/indnet-publishers.html>.
