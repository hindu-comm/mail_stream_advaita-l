No, that is not what I am saying. It(mukti) can happen at anytime, while the
jiva has this body or when it does not or when it has another body. There
should be no contradiction. I am not stating that liberation means giving up
of this body. What I had said in the email, as you pointed out, is that it
should be possible for the jiva, if liberation was not achieved *with a
body*, to achieve liberation *even after* the body is gone. That is why I
wanted to know why it was said that jivan mukti (I take this to mean
liberation in this body ?) is *essential* in Advaitam. That is what I wanted
to know - whether this is a principle. If yes, then what have the Acharyas
said.
