Exactly. And inasmuch as liberation can happen in this body, jIvanmukti is
possible.

Well, the gross material body may be gone after death, but there is what is
called the subtle body, which transmigrates. In that sense, the Jiva is
always embodied, till the realization of identity with Brahman dawns. But
this realization is also something that negates the Jiva-ness itself. In
the highest sense, there is no such thing as a liberated Jiva that is
separate from anything else, because it is and knows that it has always
been Brahman.

I suppose we are referring to different meanings of the word essential. If
your question is, does Advaita say jIvanmukti is the *only* kind of
liberation, the answer is no, Advaita also recognizes what is called krama
mukti. But if you think about it, as the Jiva is always embodied, at least
till the identity with Brahman is realized, mukti, whenever it happens, is
Jivanmukti. In that sense, yes, Advaita does affirm Jivanmukti.

Some of the most extensive discussions of this issue are found in
gItabhAshya, chapter 13, and in bRhadAraNyaka bhAshya.
