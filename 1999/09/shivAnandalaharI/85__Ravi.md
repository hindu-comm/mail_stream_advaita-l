In a personal mail, ashish told me that he is memorizing shrI
shankara's shivAnandalaharI. There is an audio rendering of this
beautiful stotram by Dr. M. Balamurali Krishna available in CD
format from

http://www.khazana.com/cd/artist551.html#126

It will be a great aid to those who wish to learn
shivAnandalaharI and memorize this great hymn. Musical genius of
Balamurali Krishna adds  splendour to these verses.

Likewise there is wonderful rendering of shrI lalitAsahasranAmam
by M.S.Sheela, which helped me to memorize many parts of
sahasranama. Music provides another element or structure to these
verses which enable remembering these verses easier.
