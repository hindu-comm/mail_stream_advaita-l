why advaita epistemology  'verbal testimony' is taken as a valid source of
knowledge ,indeed all the logic and arguments of advaita can be attacked if
the excuse of verbal testimnoy is not considered;is this why verbal
testimony is accepted?why this axiomatic approach in a system which prides
itself on it's very rigid and logical methods?
