Namaskaara Prasanna,

 Having completed my undergraduate education there at the Sharada Vilas
 and SJCE (B.E.), I have very fond memories of Mysore. Especially, the
 trips on foot to visit Goddess Chamundeshvari, Mahisha-mardini, who stands
 atop the hill blessing the entire city. And not far is the famous temple
 of Srikantheshavara in the town of Nanjangud, this Srikantheshavara being
 known as "abhisheka-priya" since He is pleased by abhishseka. Mysore,
 happily, is one of those rare places in India which still has an
 atmosphere of ancient tradition. Having lived in Mysore for a few years,
 I think of myself as fortunate.

 Welcome to the list.

 Anand
