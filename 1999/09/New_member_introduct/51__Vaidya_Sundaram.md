Thank you for the welcome to the Advaita-L list.

My name is John Reynolds, I'm 65 years of age and retired. I have the
spent the better part of that 65 years in search of the Real Self and
have a high regard for the study of advaita-vedanta. I feel fortunate to
have discovered this list with such a broad range of contributed
material.

Thanks again,

John Reynolds
