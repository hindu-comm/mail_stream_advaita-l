 I agree. This list often gives an impression of being dominated by
 a "chosen" few. It need not be that way. An large majority of those
 who join stay as silent spectators. It need not be that way.
 There are many "practical" aspects of advaita such as the smR^iti's
 (the word smArtas applied to advaitins comes from smR^iti) and other
 dharma-shAstras. It would benefit us to discuss these.
