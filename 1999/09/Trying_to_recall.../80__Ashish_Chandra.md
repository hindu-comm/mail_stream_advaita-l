Namaskaar All,

I had read something on Bhakti earlier this year. I cannot recall everything
but there was one sloka that really struck me. It was ofcourse a translation
but I would like to know from what work (and by who) is this exposition on
Bhakti.

The sloka is roughly translated as :

Like the fruits of the Ankola tree travelling towards tree itself, some
thing, some thing, like the love of a chaste woman towards her husband, the
constant flow of thoughts towards the lotus feet of Ishwara is Bhakti.

Dhanyavad
ashish
