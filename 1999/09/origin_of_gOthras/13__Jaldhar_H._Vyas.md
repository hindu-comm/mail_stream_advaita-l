Is your friend a Brahman?  The reason I ask is because I've noticed that
some of the other Gujarati castes have the concept of gotra but they don't
necessarily organize them the same way.  I.e. some have animals, some
local deities etc.

Amongst Brahmans (and this is true all across India) the Gotra is based on
Rshis.  The 8 main gotras have one pravara, the ancestral Rshi himself.
Then there are sub-gotras and sub-sub-gotras which have 3 or 5 pravara
Rshis which are generations of descendants from one of the 8 main Rshis.
