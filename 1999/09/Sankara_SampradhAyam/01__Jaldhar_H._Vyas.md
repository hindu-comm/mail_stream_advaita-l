This is fascinating stuff.  Didn't Anand once mention he belonged to a
sampradaya of Advaitin Vaishnavas?  Is this the same thing?

There is a sect in North India I'm trying to find out more about called
the Udasins.  Apparently they revere the Guru Granth Sahib and Guru Nanak
(but not the other Sikh gurus) but they also consider Shankaracharya their
Acharya and believe in Advaita Vedanta.

Do these still exist as an organized group?
