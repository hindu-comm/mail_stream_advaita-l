indeed ,both the worlds the external as well as the internal are presently
unknown to us and unknowable by us as long we view them through the mind(or
maya)only by transcending the mind can we know the essential nature of
internal as well as external reality-which is actually the same nondual
reality.this one fact is most difficult to understand--there is only one not
many,nonduality is free from many and 'rest of the things' and many is free
from nonduality --he who sees the wave does not see the ocean and he who
sees the ocean does not see the wave(even saying that'he who sees the ocean'
brings in duality:but we have to use this terminology for convenience).it
can be said that jivanmuktas are free but are bound to see duality as long
as prarabdha persists,but are no longer deluded by it.eg:a person after he
knows that a mirage is mirage will still see the mirage in the desert but
will not be deluded by it.also
in the case of avtaras like sriramakrishna ,sriramakrishna himself has said
that a trace of maya-or 'ripe ego' was maintained by him till his mission on
earth was not over i.e.,maya in name only---devendra.vyas.

Subject: krama mukti
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII

I would like those who know more about krama mukti comment on
this.

In advaita-vedAnta, mukti or liberation is through jnAna. That is
a first hand knowldge of brahmAnubhava, for that is the only way
to know brahman and that knowledge results in becoming brahman
(brahmavit brahmaiva bhavati).

In krama mukti it is said that the jIva goes to brahma loka and
eventually attain release there. Even in that state it must be
through jnAna only. Even in that loka, torments of duality should
persists and jiiva is still embodied in one form or other? May be
it is easier to attain knowledge in such higher loka-s as one may
be more advanced. On the other hand, it may be difficult there
due to the absence suffering which prompts one to think deeply
(as it is in this world).

Besides that it cannot be argued that one attains release after
100 years of brahma during the end of that cosmic cycle,
vivekachuDamaniH (verse 6? vadantu shaastrAni ..) states this. If
it is so how different it is from the shrIvaishNava concept
anyway?

Is that loka guarantee a state of non-return to this loka as some
being (plant, animal, or human)? How does one go there (to brahma
loka)? By karma phalan? if so what happens after it is exhausted?

I don't think even vaikunta is a loka of non-return, a glaring
example of vijaya and jaya (who guard the entrance) were kicked
out because of their ahankaram (that still exists there) and came
here as asura-s for three times in row to expiate for that.
Purana-s have many incidents of curses were even their shakti-s
of mumurti-s were sent to earth. One can give any good
rationalizing argument or dump of all the singularity in a single
term "leela", but what good does it do?

I think state of duality, whether here or anywhere is a state of
misery and one has to obtain release from this bondage of
ignorance. I do not know, when I think about it now, krama mukti
does not sound like a mukti (till the actual mukti happens)

 Ultimately, the release is in form of jivana mukti in one way or
other.

That is why, in advaita-vedanta when we worship any devata, we
worship them as brahman in essence and one has to attain it by
getting rid of the ignorance. The underlying mood is always,
"AsAvadityo brahma, brahmaiva satyam, brahmaivAhamasi". (in which
veda does this occur? , is it a simplfied for Asavadityo
brahmeti, brahmaiva san, brahmvaapyeti ya evam veda). We have
more opportunity to do kaimkaryam to bhagavan(if he really needs
it) here than in any other loka, and we will better of doing it
here rather than longing to go a particular loka.

Please do correct me.
