I am reminded of the shloka from the Chandi Path (5:12):

ya devi sarvabhuteshu vishnumayeti shabdita |
namastasyai namastasyai namastasyai namo namah ||

That Goddess who in all beings is  known as Vishnumaya
I bow down to again and again and again.

Shri Bhaskararaya quotes in his commentary on this verse a shloka from the
Kalika Purana stating that it is Shakti in the form of Vishnu Bhagawan's
maya which is responsible for sustaining the world.  Another commentary
the Damshoddhara makes a more explicitly Vedantic equation of Vishnumaya
with mula avidya--the external ignorance which is responsible for worldly
phenomena.

Maya is also mentioned as an Asura.  He is supposed to be the divine
architect and the author of the Shilpashastras and also the redactor of
the Surya Siddhanta and other astronomical works.
