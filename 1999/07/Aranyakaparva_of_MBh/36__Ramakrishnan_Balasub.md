The late Prof. Van Buitenens translation is readily available in
bookstores like Borders. There are 3 volumes and each of them costs
only around $25. All volumes are eminently worth purchasing.

There is also a full translation by Ganguli (or Gangoli or something
like that). You can find the reference in Van Buitenens book (too lazy
to look it up). But Ganguli does not use the so called "critical
edition" prepared by the BORI. You can get these volumes in many
University libraries.

The Yudishtra-Yaksha dialog has been translated separately by many
people. I don't have it here (it's back home in India). I can't
remember the author offhand. If I remember I'll let the list know.
