All the editions have those two shlokas and there is a style in Sanskrit
of having the concluding (or beginning) shlokas in a different chhanda
than the main body.  So that's a good case for genuineness.  It's just
they don't match up to the artistic style of the previous shlokas and just
gave me a funny "tacked on" feeling.  But as for their importance and
popularity, I completely agree.  My mother taught me Annapurne
sadapurne... long before I even knew who Shankaracharya was.

Ah yes.  This makes much more sense.

I'm pretty sure I'm correct.  In this stotra Annapurna Mata is called
Kashipuradhishwari.  As Vishwanath Mahadeva is Kashinath so the
relationship logically follows.
