Dear All

I am trying learn about DhakshinaKalika. All I know right now is this is the
form worshipped by Sri RamaKrishna Paramahamsa, can anyone help about this
form of worship,origin and its significance to advaita realization ?. I read
somewhere that Kalika helps her devotee to have the Advaita Anubhava by
awakening your kundalini.

thanks in advance
Ganesh Deivasikhamani
