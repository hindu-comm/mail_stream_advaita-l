This book is a re-publication of the CH's
original book "What are you doing in my
Universe". It is a very brief book (1600 words
introduction and 2000 words main text,
illustrated with diagrams). It introduces to a
lay man in a very simple language the essesence
non-dualistic philosphy. The book was evolved out
of the 30 years of practice and experience with
bhagavAn shrI ramaNa mahariShi's teachings.

This book has got raving reviews from many
new-age philosophers and author CH mentions that
he has got a very positive feedback from a wide
range of audience.

If you are interested in buying this book or
finding more information about it please contact
the author at chillig at jetlink.net

The WWW page is not yet functional, so the best

Thank you for your attention.

Sincerely,
Ravi
