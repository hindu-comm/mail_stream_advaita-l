I didn't invite anyone to dispute advaita. I merely answered your
question on importance of shruti in advaita. Advatins don't think they
earn brownie points by converting other people to their tradition
unlike Western religions. Read Jaldhars post on what I was actually
tring to say. Thanks Jaldhar!
