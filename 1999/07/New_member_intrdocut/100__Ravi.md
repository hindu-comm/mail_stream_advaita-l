    hi ravi, i am b.s.s.prasad basically from mysore, karnataka now working
in geometric software, pune. Right from childhood i have a very special
interest in sri shankaracharya and his teachings on advaita philosophy(there
are a number of reasons for this interest). I have never missed an
oppurtuinity to listen to discourses about sri shankara and his teachings
and to read the available material regarding his compositions and teachings
and discuss the same with other like minded people.
 I hope this was the kind of intro u were looking for..if u need any further
info pl contact me.
regards
_prasad
