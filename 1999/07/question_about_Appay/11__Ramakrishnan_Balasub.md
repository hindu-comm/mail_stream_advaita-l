There is a statue of  the dIxitar in the marundiisvarar temple in
Thiruvanmiyur, Chennai (Madras). The temple's tradition is that the
dIxitar performed a sacrifice there and the statue commemorates this
event. Appayya was well known for performing shrauta sacrifices.  So,
yes, we may take it that appayya was in Madras sometime in his life.

But, how was this particular lingam identified as the one worshipped
by appayya?
