Pranams !

Thank you very much for adding me to Advaita-L. Please find below my
introduction.

Introduction

Name : Praveen Kumar Tiwari

Place of birth : Allahabad, U.P. , India.

Profession: Software engineer
Presently working with ICT Automatisering, Netherlands as a software
engineer.

Qualification: M.Sc. (Computer Science)


I have been associated with Chinmaya Mission for the past 10 years and hence
got the opportunity to know about Sri Sankara, His philosophy and work. I
have studied few prakarana granthas by Sri Sankara besides little
familiarity with His commentaries on Geeta and Upanishads. I am deeply
impressed by the advaita vedanta and the realized masters like Sri Ramana
Maharshi and Sri Nisargadutta Maharaj alongwith the masters in the order of
Sri Sankara.

With warm Regards

Praveen
