My name is Pramod Moorjani.
Curious to know the meaning & purpose of life , I have been seeking answers in
some philosophies.
As far as Advaita Vedanta is concerned --
I have been studying Swami Chinmayananda's works for some time.
I would like to learn more..hence the request to subscribe to your list
