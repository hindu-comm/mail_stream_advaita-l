hello all.,

I have been a member of this list for quite a long time, I have not participated
actively, but I am going through all the mails and I feel I have still a long
way to go to participate in some of the topics which are currently being
discussed.

I need a simple clarification

I have heard that in Vedas there was no mention of temples anywhere because
Vedas clearly say that You see God in every soul.
So when did this tradition of temples came, and why?

Thanks in Advance
Prashanth
