That's a tautology.  Agreement/disagreement is a matter of degree.

So you don't believe in synonyms?  No two words can refer to the same
thing?  If you allow synonyms, then there can be congruent synonyms
pointing to the same truth that Advaita points to.  If you don't allow
synonyms, then Advaita can never even be translated to any other language,
so therefore can't be taught in English...
