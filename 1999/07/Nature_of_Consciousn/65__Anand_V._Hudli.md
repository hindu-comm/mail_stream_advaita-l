 Krishna makes a statement that seems to be analogous to the position of
 the Vedas with respect to other religions.

 Krishna says:

 mayA tatamidaM sarvaM jagadavyaktamUrtinA |
 matsthAni sarvabhUtAni na chAhaM teshhvavasthitaH || 9.4||

 This whole world has been pervaded by Me in My nature as being beyond the
 range of senses. All beings (from BrahmA down to a blade of grass) exist
 in Me, but I am not in (contact with) them, not contained by them.

 Similar is the status of the Vedic religion. It may be true that there
 are many great nonVedic religions in the world. But the essence of such
 religions is already in the eternal and changeless Vedas. And the Vedas
 are not contained in or influenced by any such religion. Whatever the
 nonVedic religions preach cannot contain what is taught by the Vedas.
 This is why the Vedas have a unique position.
