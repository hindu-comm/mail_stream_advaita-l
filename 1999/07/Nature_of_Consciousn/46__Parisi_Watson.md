Just for the record, I never mentioned the word proof. I am only seeking an
understanding of consciousness, experience, and knowledge that best explains
what we 'know' (unavoidably circular), and that entails no unnecessary
assumptions. But you seem to be conceding the main point as a matter of
faith only - as a sort of axiom from which everything else flows, but which
cannot be established except through supposed revelation. I would think that
many people, both Eastern and Western, would find such a position to be
lacking.
