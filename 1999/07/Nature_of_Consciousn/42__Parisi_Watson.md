How can a living person have _any_ state in the absence of brain physiology?
It's true that we can't explain how or why random thoughts arise, in terms
of brain physiology or anything else. But that's still not to say that these
thoughts and states are not produced by the nervous system, although in a
way that is unknown to us. If it were not so, then why would a person's
thoughts become bizarre and deranged after the ingestion of certain drugs?
Why would lack of blood flow to the brain produce unconsciousness? Why would
various types of brain injuries, which have been documented in detail in
books like those of Oliver Sacks, produce various grotesque distortions of
personality, perception, and self image?

What you say is true, but the argument is an indirect and circumstantial
one. We have only our perceptions, and can never compare them to any thing
in itself. But the fact they enable us to survive in an often hostile and
dangerous world is still evidence that our perceptions, which are certainly
concocted (not an exaggerated word) by the brain present a schema of reality
that at least makes us able to navigate, avoid hazards, and so forth. We
also have many different ways of confirming sense perceptions, not only by
the various senses, but also by indirect technical means. When all these
sources present a similar picture, then we are justified in making a guarded
judgment that the picture corresponds to what is 'out there.'

This is the crux of the issue. Is it not obvious that consciousness is the
medium of all human experience, regardless of whether consciousness is
produced by the nervous system or vice versa? So how can a valid argument be
made on this basis that "all there is is consciousness"?
