Omitting the "Obviously," your second sentence does not follow from the
first.  If there can be other systems opposed to advaita, then there must
be able to be other systems congruent with advaita, that say the same
things, that reveal the same truth.  In that case, neither advaita nor that
other system would hava a monopoly on truth...
