Hi.

I think you're you're indirectly saying that the Vedas being the creation
of Rshis who have realized Brahman, and so are omniscient, the defects of
knowledge associated with men are not present in them. As far as I have
understood, this is not what the MimAmsaka stand is. They say that the
Vedas are not the creation of anybody, not Rshis or even ISvara. In fact
some of them reject ISvara, and argue against omniscience.

No, my doubt was not that. I just wanted to know if Sankara even takes a
specific stand on the issue.  I accept the Vedas as infallible because of
faith in the Rshis and in ISvara, but am sceptical that their
unauthoredness can be 'proved'. Also I am asking whether Advaita Vedanta
requires us to accept the unauthoredness of the Sruti.

Regards,
Ganesh.
