  I think it is not entirely accurate to call any mImAMsakas "atheist"
  in the sense that the term "atheist" is used today. The anIshvara
  mImAMsakas are not so much interested to deny God as the atheists of
  today are. For such mImAMsakas, it does not matter whether God exists
  or not. They hold that the fruits of actions are automatically granted
  by some unseen potency called "adR^ishhTa". Shankara has dealt with this
  position of the anIshvara mImAMsakas in his sUtra bhAShya.
