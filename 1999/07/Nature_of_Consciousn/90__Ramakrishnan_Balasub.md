That's not true. The most venerable BhaTTa says in the very first
verse of his shlokavArtika:

vishuddha GYAna dehAya trivedI-divyacaxushhe |
shreyaH prApta nimittAya namaH somArdhadhAriNe ||

Obeisance to him (Lord shiva) who wears the crescent moon, who "body"
is pure consciousness, whose three eyes are the vedas and who is the
source of all prosperity.

In the10th verse he says his effort in the shlokavArttika is to turn
the mImAm.nsA which had been *mainly* atheistic into a theistic path.

Quite obviously he couldn't have been denying Ishvara. From the fact
that he says "mainly atheistic" it is reasonable to infer that there
were two strands of mImA.nsA in existence even in the bhaTTa's time:
theistic and atheistic. The latter was more popular, but the bhaTTa
makes his preference clear.

Neither is incompatible with the unauthordness of shruti.

No, the existence of Lord Krishna who is the omniscient Ishvara is
known only through the veda-s. And the veda-s are reliable because it
was not written by anyone including Ishvara. Sorry, I don't know what
verse in the gItA you are referring to.
