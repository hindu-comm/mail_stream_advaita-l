VedAnta is not "human enterprise" but inteprtetation of unauthored
texts. No author = no flaw in the texts. The flaw can lie only in
interpretation.

Sorry for being blunt again, but then it is best to forsake advaita
vedAnta.

Not to sound rude, but why would I care whether my views have some
commonality with some religious teachers in the US? Vedantins are not
interested in examining partial commonalties with other schools. I am
sure many religious teachers in the US also breathe air and eat food,
that doesn't bother me :-).
