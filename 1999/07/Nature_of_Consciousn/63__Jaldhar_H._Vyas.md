But if you're talking about truth only 100% agreement will do.  Any lesser
degree is false.

I don't believe that is relevant.  After all, other types of Vedanta use
the same words to different effect.  We are talking about concepts.  If
other systems concepts match up with Advaita Vedantas' then they are
Advaita Vedanta.  Actually this is a moot point because I haven't seen any
evidence of other philosophies which agree with Advaita Vedanta except in
superficial or partial ways.
