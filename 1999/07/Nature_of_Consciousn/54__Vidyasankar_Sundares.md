I'm not necessarily saying that those who are comfortable with the idea of
received revelation are always correct.

That said, advaita vedAntins have a completely different view of revelation
as compared to the Judeo-Christian-Islamic traditions. We allow for a lot
of metaphorical interpretation of the Veda. We do not insist upon the
literal where the figurative or the allegorical makes better sense.
