Sorry to disagree, but this is not a good book on this subject. The
author misrepresents the gauDapAda kArikA-s and the shA.nkara bhAshhya
on it in many places. A true characterization of both is achieved by
Swami Satchidanandendra Sarawati in his "shuddha shA.nkara prakriyA
bhAskara". I have also given a reference before to R. D. Karmarkars
book which is a good book on this subject, although not as good as the
one mentioned above.
