Excuse me, but you're making this too complicated. I simply asked how a
living human being can have any mental (or other) state in the absence of
brain physiology. Living, conscious people have functioning brains, and
these brains cannot be arbitrarily excluded from our understanding of people
and their mental states. Brain physiology is _always_ a key element in any
mental state of a living person.

The "How could anything" is part of the problem. When a position becomes
true by definition, so that its inevitable truth is entailed by the way it
is framed, then we have a right to wonder whether anything of substance is
actually being said. "All bachelors are unmarried."

We can observe not only succession, but dependence. We know without doubt
that massive injury to the brain results in loss of consciousness,
awareness, and personality. Does it not seem reasonable and realistic to
infer some dependence, and thus causality, in this case? If consciousness is
prior to and independent of the nervous system, then why is its quality and
very existence contingent on the proper functioning of that system? Doesn't
it seem to obvious even to mention?

It's not quite the same. If my mother dies tomorrow, my consciousness,
personality, self image, sense of 'I-am,' and so on will continue
unimpinged, even if I have been plunged into grief. The same cannot be said
of the destruction or injury of my brain. And of course food and air are
necessary in order to sustain life, without which the brain also has a rough
time of it.

Again my point: the argument you are making is true by definition, and so
supports nothing. Human consciousness _is_ the medium of all human
experience, whether or not it is produced and sustained by the nervous
system. In other words, the same considerations remain inevitable even under
a totally materialistic set of assumptions. Therefore how can they be used
to support one position over the other - either consciousness as the basis
of all being, or consciousness as produced and sustained by the organism?

>(iii) The third is "What is consciousness"?

I don't think the foregoing provides a firm enough foundation even to frame
this question. I know I don't have any definitive answer for it.

Robert.
