I have serious doubts about this whole area of alleged knowledge, as
outlined in my original statement. There is no experience or mental state
except those produced by the nervous system, including sense experience. The
only thing that makes sense experience special is its proven value as an aid
to survival. Therefore all the talk about supra-sensory matters based upon
ineffable states of consciousness is misguided. But I fear that this is a
disagreement at such a fundamental level that there is no point in
discussing it further.
