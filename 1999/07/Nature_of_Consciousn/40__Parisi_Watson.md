Forgive me, but I'm still grappling with the basic concepts. Please tell me
where this line of reasoning goes wrong:

1. Every shred of evidence, from psychoactive drugs to brain injuries,
indicates that all mental states are produced by the nervous system.

2. This statement applies to sense experience also, but its survival value
indicates that it bears some resemblance to what is really 'out there.'

3. By this reasoning, all other states of consciousness, including ineffable
experiences of nondual oneness and so on, are also produced by the nervous
system, and so tell us nothing radical or fundamental about the nature of
reality.
