Or it could be that, like any human enterprise, Vedanta includes some
profound truth without necessarily encompassing all of it, and perhaps some
areas that are fuzzy or slightly questionable. I call it a human enterprise
because I can't imagine any adequate justification for viewing it as
"unauthored," any more than I believe the Angel Gabriel dictated the Koran
to Muhammad, or that God personally wrote the Gospels. To believe these
things is your choice, but you might have more in common with some religious
teachers in the US than you realize.
