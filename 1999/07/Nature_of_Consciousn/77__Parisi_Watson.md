The point was that there are similarities in terms of claiming a monopoly on
truth. I'm sure you've heard Christians make flat, unqualified statements to
the effect that no one can possibly find God except through Jesus, that
Christianity is not a religion because religions are founded by men and
Christianity was founded by God, that God personally wrote every word of the
Bible through human agents, and so on? I think it's all rather sad, and I
don't believe I want to associate myself with any of it.
