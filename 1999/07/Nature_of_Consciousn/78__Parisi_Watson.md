So now you are admitting that there is some checking of the veracity of
Vedanta outside the Vedas themselves?

That was Heaven's Gate. No, I'm inclined just to forget the whole thing, and
return to my Western roots in what we call, for lack of a better term,
scientific materialism. IMHO it has the best fit to our experience with the
greatest economy of assumptions. After the current lively discussion dies
down, I'll withdraw from the list and pursue other avenues.

I respect that quality deeply. However I would respect even more deeply an
admission that, while they may contribute greatly to the wisdom of mankind,
the Vedas do not necessarily include all possible wisdom, and could even
contain some errors. You have made it abundantly clear that this is asking
too much.
