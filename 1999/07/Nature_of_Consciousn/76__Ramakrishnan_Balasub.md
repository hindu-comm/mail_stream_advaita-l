Instead

It's better to follow something after being informed rather than under
blissful ignorance.

There is the question of whether the teachings in a mosque, etc agrees
with universal experience as advaita vedAnta does (in my opinion at
any rate). So I take it you'ld also support the views of the poor
ignoramuses who killed themselves hoping that they'd be taken to
salvation by a flying saucer (sorry I don't remember the name of this
group, but it is difficult to keep track of all these lunatics)? Let
me  start a new system tomorrow stating that salvation is achieved by
repeatedly banging one's head against a wall. I presume you'll admit
that as "another path to truth"? :-). My intention is not to be
sarcastic, but to point out that the line you draw is quite arbitrary.

There is another important difference between conservatives in
synagogues, etc and advaita vedAntins. The latter say that purity of
mind is a prerequisite to GYAna and that can be certainly achieved in
a variety of different ways and religions. Thus, true followers of the
veda do not go and harass people of other religions. The old text sUta
sa.nhitA makes this quite clear.
