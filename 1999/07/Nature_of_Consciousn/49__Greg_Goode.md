Greg writes:
If questioning the concepts of person, brain, states, etc. is too
complicated, then the result is that you are restricting the question to
the realm of psychobiology, physiology, biology, etc.  In these fields, the
person, brain physiology are assumed.  The questions proper to these
disciplines then pertain to the interactions between brain and functioning
of the organism.  In that I can agree: according to the terms and
assumptions of these disciplines, the brain physiology IS a key condition
in the mental state of the person.

Greg wrote (about brain states and behavior in psychology/science, etc.):

Greg writes:
Because we seem to be talking just about science, there is no problem.
With the possible exception of the newer quantum physics, scientific
evidence doesn't usually can count against one metaphysical view or another
- nor is it asked to.  That's not its job.  Your questions in the first
section above are like that.  Neither the non-dual view nor a dualistic
view is implicated.  This is what I meant about "How could anything?"  This
approach is something that can never adjudicate for or against a
metaphysical view, non-dualistic, dualistic, or any other.  When the
questions become metaphysical, THEN the views of reality are in play.

Greg:
We *infer* dependence.  We observe actions, movements, meter readings, etc.

Robert:

Greg:
Dependence is another thing assumed by science, a relation between
observable actions.   The inference to causality is unnecessary, and
science does away with it largely by a kind of statistical instrumentalism.
 Such as "In X percentage of cases when Y is done, Z is observed to occur.
Similar future cases will probably yield like results."

[Greg said mother is like the brain, both necessary for waking-state
consciousness]

Greg:
Yes, in this way they are different, and science treats of brain states.
Psychotherapy deals with mother-states.

Greg:
Not true or valid by definition, but uttered when I thought we were talking
about metaphysics.  Within experimental psychology, psychobilogy, etc.,
non-dualism is a non-issue.

One position over another... Yes, this is exactly what I said above about
science and metaphysics.  With the possible exception of the new quantum
physics (Amit Goswami, etc.), science doesn't ask or purport to answer
metaphysical questions.  But then your statements immediately above are not
metaphysical either, they are scientific generalizations.  No problem.
