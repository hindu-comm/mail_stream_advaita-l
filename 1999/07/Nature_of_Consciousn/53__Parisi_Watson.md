Advaita Vedanta as taught by Shri Shankara, the subject of this list,
depends upon the Vedas and Upanishads. But have not people in other
continents and traditions, who may never have heard of the Vedas, also
reached the non-dual state equivalent to Nirvikalpa Samadhi? If the Vedas
and all those who remember them vanished from the Earth, would that
necessarily spell the end of all realization? This position strikes me as
overly ethnocentric. If the ideas of the Vedas are truly universal, then
they are not confined to any one tradition, language, or scripture. And even
if Advaita Vedanta is the most profound and deeply carried out mystical
tradition on Earth (as I believe it is), it is still only one voice in a
human chorus that spans the continents and millennia. No one tradition has a
total monopoly on the truth.
