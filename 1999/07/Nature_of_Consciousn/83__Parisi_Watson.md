My point, on the contrary, was that it is impossible for anyone to justify a
claim that the Vedas or any scripture or doctrine are the sum of knowledge.
That they are true, yes. Even that they are flawless and without error. But
to say that they constitute the sum of all possible wisdom is like saying
that everything possible has now been invented, and we can stop here.

Neither am I, as long as it's just a pointer and stops short of claims of
absolute, total, and unquestionable truth.

We start with what we know, and extrapolate from there. But the original
point concerned whether or not any state of consciousness can legitimately
serve as a medium for knowledge beyond the material realm. If all states of
consciousness, including sense data, are produced by the nervous system,
then trying to find ultimate truth by introspection, purification of
awareness, asking Who am I?, and so on is totally futile and misguided.
