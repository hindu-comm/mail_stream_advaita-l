Well, there we have it.  With one blow you have struck down the very thing
about Indian religion that has attracted so many people in the West. Instead
you return to the concept of authoritative and unquestionable revelation and
an absolute monopoly on Truth. I find this development very disillusioning.
If I were looking for that sort of absolutism, I could easily find it in the
right kind of conservative neighborhood church, synagogue, or mosque. They
also would insist, "But our Truth is the REAL Truth, the entire Truth, and
all those others are in error."
