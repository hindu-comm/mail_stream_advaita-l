It can only be a pointer by its' own admission. The truth is "yato vAco
nivartante" that from which even speech recoils ... hence, if you can postulate
it, dream it, etc, it is not IT. You've gotta do it your self!

 I believe I briefly addressed this in my earlier mail. asking WHat is IT?
mediating on an answer you get etc, and asking Who am I? and how am I me and
THAT as  well   -- etc -- are necessary because they prepare you for the IT.
Understanding the meanings of the words of the sentence is important to
understand the meaning of the sentence. (I remember reading the previous
sentence somewhere, i dont remember where though).Please note also that, the
established tradition tells you that trying to seek the answers by yourself just
by introspection does not work. You need a Guru to actually lead (or probably
for guys like me, drag) you as close to IT as possible.

Vaidya.
