That shruti is the pramana for knowledge of Brahman is a basic tenet of
Advaita Vedanta as the historical, traditional, and literary record
shows so no we are not showing any tolerance for those who think
it is not.  If I said "Tamils believe you should slice a childs left ear
off three days after birth"  would you be 'intolerant' for suggesting I
just made that up?  We can discuss the reasons for our respective views
but ultimately we will either accept or reject them.  Intolerence is when
you are not willing to hear people out.  Do you see that happening?

The cure for your discouragement is to not stay a beginner.  Listen to the
arguments, learn the issues and your outlook will change.

To restate the position.  The Vedas deal with two subjects, Dharma and
Brahman.  These cannot be known through perception, inference etc.  In the
fields of Dharma and Brahman they are the final authority.  Other shastras
or teachers are only authoritative insofar as they are based on the Vedas.

The authorlessness of the Vedas is to remove the personality of the
alleged creator as a factor in the interpretation.

Nobody learns anything purely on their own.  Teachers, experience,
environmental factors all contribute.  One should have the integrity to
admit this rather than claim all credit for ones beliefs.

Maybe they should.  Who is a realized person?  What coes it mean to be
realized?  How should someone go about it?

Please accept my correction when and if you are wrong.
