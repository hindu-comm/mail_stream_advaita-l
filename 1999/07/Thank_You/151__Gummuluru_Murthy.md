I have followed the discussion on consciousness. I was away from the List
for the past few weeks, and as I got back, I was able to read all the
postings on this thread sequentially at the same time. This gave me a
better perspective of the pro- and counter- arguments.

I feel sorry that Robert has found vedAnta unconvincing. May be, what
he found unconvincing are the dogmatic arguments put forward on this
List in favour of the vedAs. If Robert had got into a discussion with
a true follower of vedAnta, he would see the wisdom contained in the
upanishads; and would further see how effortlessly, vedAnta (upanishads)
explain the Truth. He would also see how it is immaterial whether vedAs
ALONE contain the truth or not. A perfect understanding of vedAs make one
become vedA, the Knowledge, in which case, this argument whether the
vedAs are the ultimate or not, is irrelevant.
