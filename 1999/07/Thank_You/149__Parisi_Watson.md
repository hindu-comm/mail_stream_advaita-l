Thank you, I will check it out.

I hoped that they weren't offensive or presumptuous, and I certainly have
not been offended in the least by any of the replies. As I stated, I don't
believe similar questions would ever receive such a patient and constructive
welcome in, for instance, a Christian setting. I am not going away angry,
but more just because I don't see much point in continuing to bludgeon the
same points over and over when there is clearly a disagreement at such a
fundamental level. Not that it isn't what I expected, of course, but just
wanted to double check my conclusions. All of you have my respect and
regard, if not my agreement.

Robert.
