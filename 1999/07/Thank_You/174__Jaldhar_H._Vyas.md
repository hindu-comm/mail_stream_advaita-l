I thought we were talking about people who had _previously_ left the list.

But that somewhere is not Advaita Vedanta.  People are entitled  to
believe in whatever they want.  It is when they misrepresent their own
notions as being that of Advaita Vedanta that I have a problem.  Bcause it
is not truth and I believe what is true is good and what is untrue is
evil.

And btw, several people who left the list in a huff still read it through
the web interface.  I seem them in the log files.  Obviously the
"harshness" didn't bother them _that_ much did it?

You are right to urge us to a higher standard.  Yes there is room for
improvement.  But it goes both ways.  People have to learn to not feel
attacked when they hear something they find uncomfortable.

For the same reason some new members don't exemplify the ideal student and
patiently try to understand things before shooting off an opinion.  These
are things that we all need to work on.

I count two sorts of learners.  The first may not be familiar with the
topic for whatever reason but they are interested in furthering their
knowledge.  Even if they do not end up agreeing with what you say, that
kind of person is a joy to answer.

The second is only looking for a mirror to confirm what he has already
decided upon.   In my book, such people are beneath contempt and do not
deserve any special consideration from me.

No.  Humans are higher than the Devas in this repect because they are
enjoying the fruits of their previous karma and are thus constrained to
act in particular ways while we have the power and free will to choose our
actions.
