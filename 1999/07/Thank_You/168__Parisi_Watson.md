Ironic as it may seem, I've always been more drawn, both logically and
aesthetically, to unconditional monism. I'm not looking for what some might
consider a 'watered down' substitute compromise. For me it's apt to be
either all or nothing, unless of course a compromise is seen to be demanded
by the facts. But still other ideas can be interesting to explore.
