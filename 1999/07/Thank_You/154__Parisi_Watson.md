I agree with you, but my questions about the ultimate authority of the Vedas
are also accompanied by grave doubts about the central tenets of the
Upanishads themselves, which I believe are a miracle of clarity and
simplicity, as you say. My doubts center around the question of whether
_any_ experience or state of consciousness can serve as support for
metaphysical or super-sensual claims. Unfortunately my main point got lost
in the shuffle over the Vedas. But as I stated, I fear that this
disagreement may lie at such a fundamental level that discussion will be
fruitless. Or maybe it isn't fruitless and I just allowed myself to be
sidetracked. It's hard to say...

Robert.
