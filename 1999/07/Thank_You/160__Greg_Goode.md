In general, Gummuluru, I would like to thank you for the gentlemanly and
courteous tone of your post, which by any sophisticated standards,
displayed wisdom, insight, and good judgment.

Yes, Robert's original question was about consciousness being the medium of
all human expression, and brain states being a key factor in
consciousness.  He didn't mention the Vedas at all in that question.

This has been repeatedly observed on this list.  Many people have left the
list, not because of religious or philosophical differences, but because of
the harsh character of some of the messages.  Is this harsh character,
displayed so openly, a good representation of advaita vedanta???  Do the
AchArya-s at the shankara maTha-s speak and behave this way towards?  I
don't know, but I sincerely doubt it!!!

Yes, *do we*???
