And what are people like me? I've heard very analogous arguments from
Christians who are affronted by having the final authority of their Bible
and "Tradition of the Fathers" questioned seriously. "Women can't chant the
Vedas because tradition says they can't" (whoever in the list said that). If
I don't follow my own Western tradition in this slavish manner, I'm
certainly not going to adhere to someone else's just for the sake of
tradition.
