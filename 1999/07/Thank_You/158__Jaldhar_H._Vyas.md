Yes the debate has been lively but has there been any malice on
anyones part?  I don't see it.  Those people who have expressed their
views have done so forcefully but reasonably I think.  If the reasons
aren't convincing that is another matter but an effort has been made to
make them convincing.  And I think you are doing Robert too little honor
if you think he is being "pushed into a corner" by any of this.  If the
mood was hostile people would have thought "oh another atheist" maybe
flamed him a bit or ignored him.  But this is exciting stuff.  Some
genuinely interesting ideas have been brought up here.  Hence the
responses.

As for what Advaita is for, that's simple it is for moksha.  Herein lies
the problem with the kid gloves approach.  It leaves people as ignorant as
when they started. I thank you for including me as a 'knowledgable member
of the list' but I didn't get that way overnight.  It took a lot of hard
work.  Hopefully I can share some of what I know so it won't be as hard
for the next person but they have to meet me part of the way.  The
'everything is a mystery' approach will not get one far.  We do not have
all the answers but lets work with what we do have.

What is wrong with saying Advaita Vedanta is not for you if in fact it
isn't?  Do you really want a one size fits all religion which will
try and be everything to everyone?  Didn't Ramakrisnan also suggest an
alternative?  This s exactly what our acharyas do.  To one person they
will say do this japa.  To another do that vrata and only for the
qualified do they recommend atmavidya.  It is not a sign of disgrace to
believe differently from Advaita Vedanta.

Let's say Robert decides to go with Western materialism.  He has said that
he still has a respect for our beliefs.  That's good enough for me.  So if
I say I acknowledge other religions but I think the Vedic religion is the
best, why should any be upset.  Are there hordes of dogma-crazed Vedantins
running around stopping anyone from doing their thing?  Have their been?

Yes they are.  Because Advaita Vedanta stands for certain ideas and
practices.  If people do not know this they should be told about it not
kept in the dark.

Reasons were given but maybe they weren't convincing.  We can try to make
the more convincing but maybe it will never work.  Oh well.

Once again, I think there has been fruitful exchange not harshness from
all sides.

Unfortunately there is a lot of incorrect notions floating around about
the teachings of Advaita Vedanta and this list performs a great service by
seperating the wheat from the chaff.  Some people have reacted adversely
to this but more have thanked us for providing straightforward no-bs
information even if it wasn't what they were expecting.

I would not expect someone who believed injustice was occuring to remain
silent but I hope I have in some way convinced you that no injustice is
ocurring.
