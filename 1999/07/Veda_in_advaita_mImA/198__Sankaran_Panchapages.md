Hi Ramakrishnan,
        Thanks for the clarifications and correcting some of my
minsconceptions. I didn't understand some parts and have some questions
since I need to know nyAya-vaiSeshika, etc. I am trying to read it from
Radhakrishnan's book 'Indian Philosophy' I'll also try to read Anand's
post on apUrva and will ask again after that.

Thanks,
Ganesh.
