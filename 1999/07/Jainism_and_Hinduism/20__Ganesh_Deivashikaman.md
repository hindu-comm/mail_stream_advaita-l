Dear Advaitains/Friends

Can anyone englighten me on the difference between Jainism and Hinduism.
Because many of the jains seems to worship our Gods  like Lakshmi,Ganapathi
and at the same time their Gods(Thirthangas) also.
Is Jainism similar to Buddhism that argues based on 'SoonyaVadha' or
'Nothingness'? or do they have anything similar to 'Advaita' ?

Thanks in Advance
Ganesh Deivasikhamani
