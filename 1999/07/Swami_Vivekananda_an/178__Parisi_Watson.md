If that is so, then it's a Western trait of which I don't approve. For
instance, at the risk of sounding unctious, my respect for the members of
this list has been untouched by the current discussion.

I don't believe that's the point. It is (or should be) more a matter of
having the humility to concede that no one teacher or tradition encompasses
all truth, so that every tradition and culture can make its own contribution
in its own way. Doubtless some traditions are much more rich and profound
than others, but there is no monopoly. If 'I am That,' then everyone else is
also, and others may realize it, approach it, and express it in very
different ways. When we're dealing with the essentially inexpressible, then
surely there is room for multiple approaches. I see nothing in this point of
view that insists on rigid conformity to one point of view... anything but.
And it's not a matter of corrupting or abandoning one's own approach, but
more just having the patience and tolerance to find the value in someone
else's while continuing to follow one's own. At least that's my take on what
the followers of Ramakrishna are getting at. Certainly I'm no expert.

Robert.
