I didn't say anything at all about pointing out defects or suggesting
remedies. I merely stated the obvious: that any endeavor involving human
beings will inevitably be flawed. If we knew what _all_ the flaws are and
how to remedy them, then we would no longer be imperfect, fallible human
beings. What I did say is that we can find the things of true value that
each culture and religion has to offer. I and do believe it can be found,
buried even in the most sectarian, tribal creed.

I don't want to get into acrimonious finger pointing. You have stated that
the Vedas are infallible and encompass all wisdom. I have said that nothing
conceived by human beings ever meets this standard, so why not look for the
valuable aspects of each culture's contribution. Let anyone judge where the
presumption may lie.

And please, don't bother repeating that the Vedas are not a human
endeavor... I've heard it all before from Christians and Muslims about their
scriptures and doctrines. The profundity and sheer beauty of the Upanishads
(with which I'm more familiar than the Vedas) can stand on its own, without
being propped up by any allegations that they are not of human origin.
