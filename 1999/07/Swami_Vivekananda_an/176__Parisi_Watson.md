I was disappointed that no one took up my question about Swami Vivekananda.
My impression from his speeches and writings is that he did not necessarily
take an absolute stance with regard to the Vedas as unauthored, encompassing
all possible wisdom, and totally without error. Or if he did, it was not
something that he chose to emphasize publicly. Does Swami Vivekananda, as
the foremost follower of Sri Ramakrishna, stand outside the circle of true
followers of Advaita Vedanta? And what about Sri Ramakrishna himself, who
openly advocated the "many paths" idea? If they do, then I think many
admirers around the world of these two figures would be shocked to learn
that the prophet is without honor in his own land.

Robert.
