Hi.

I came accross the photograph of the "Shankaracharia hill" in Kashmir, at
the home page of a guy from Kashmir:

http://web.syr.edu/~fsqazi/page35.html

The other pictures of Kashmir on the page are also beautiful.

Does anyone know why this hill is called the Shankaracharia hill (because
Sri Sankara attained samadhi there?) ?

Regards,
Ganesh.
