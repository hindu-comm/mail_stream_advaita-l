   Sri Shankara is supposed to have attained Samadhi near Kedarnath in
the Himalayas. But He did ascend the sarvajna peeTha in Kashmir. But I
am not sure if the place was the Shankaracharya Hill or a SAradA temple
there. This is according to the Sringeri tradition and the mAdhaveeya
Shankaradigvijaya. That's a very nice picture.
Raghavendra.
