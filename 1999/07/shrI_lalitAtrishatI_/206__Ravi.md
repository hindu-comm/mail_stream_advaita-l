Sage suuta spoke, Saying thus agastya mahaR^iShi
(kalashodbaha also known as kumbhasaMbhava) held the feet of
Lord hayagrIva. Taken aback, Lord hayagrIva told what is
this, what is this, let me go.

mu.nchamu.ncheti taMchoktvaa chintaakraanto babhuuva saH |
chiraM vichaarya nishchinvan.h  vaktavyaM na mayetya sau || 6 ||

Contemplating deeply on this matter for sometime, Lord
hayagrIva came to the conclusion that he has nothing more to
instruct.

tuushhNiiM sthitaH smarannaaGYaaM lalitaaMbaa kR^itaaM puraa |
taM praNamyaiva samuniH tatpaadaavatyajan.h sthitaH || 7 ||

Remembering the command of shrI lalitAmbikaa (that he should
keep trishatI secret) Lord hayagrIva remained silent. But
sage agastya did not let him go and was holding his feet
with his head bowing on it.
