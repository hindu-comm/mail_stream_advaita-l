This topic is handled in detail in the debate between shrI shankara and
maNDana mishra in madhava-vidyaraNya's shankara digvijaya.

Besides this in regard to your first post, former pontiff of kAnchi
maTha shrI chandrasekharendra sarasvatI refers to a quote from tamil
poem on Lord shiva which hails him as "aayiram shAkai uDaiyaan", as one
who has 1000 shAkAs, in reference to sAma veda. I dont remember the
exact reference for this talk. In some of this talks, he deals with
subject matter in quite a detail.
