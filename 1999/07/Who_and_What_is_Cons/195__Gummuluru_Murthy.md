namaste. The following is my understanding on consciousness.

There is the cognitive consciousness (the lower case c consciousness)
which allows us to recognize the jagat around. There is the Consciousness
(the upper case C), the Atman/Brahman which pervades all. It is this
Consciousness which gives the consciousness to each jeeva, each
species, whether we call them inert (jaDa) or with full of caitanya.
This lower case c consciousness is in the realm of lower knowledge and
would not help in understanding ourselves, because we are simply analyzing
the lower knowledge only. This lower knowledge is avidyA, ignorance and
it is this avidyA which makes us see some objects as inert (jaDA) and
some objects as with full of consciousness (caitanyA). But ALL in this
jagat, pervaded by the Consciousness (upper case C) have the same
caitanya; it is only our inability to recognize this caitanya on our
time scale. Thus, the rock, plant, animal and human kingdoms, all
pervaded by the same Consciousness, have, in my view, the same caitanya.
Obviously, the time scales of these caitanya are different; hence, for
example, humans, on their time scale, cannot recognize the caitanya of
rock kingdom.

Once we accept the above, explanation of the consciousness of the human
in terms of brain functions becomes a subject of lower knowledge and is
of no particular interest in advaita.
