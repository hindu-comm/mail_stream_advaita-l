Maybe not cats but I feel that some animals do.  In a more rudimentary way
than humans of course.

Perhaps one answer is to look at it in a statistical way.  Does the
subject show more signs of consciousness or not?  Trouble is, a good many
humans might fail that test.  (On a serious note it could be (and in
fact has) been used to justify oppression.  We can treat ____ however we
like.  They don't feel as we do.)

Agreed.  Perhaps another way to examine consciousness is to measure its
effect on other things.  Just like the outer planets were discovered by
their gravitational efects on the inner ones.  If we know a particular
behavior is based on instinct, and subject A is less bound by it than
subject B maybe it means A is more conscious.  That's why Vedanta (got to
stay on topic here :-) insists not only on the inside (the atma,
specifically the chitta shakti of the atma.) but an "outside" component
(brahman.)

Nothing was wrong with your reasoning except that it ran out of steam as
all logic eventually does.

In the same way that 3 < 4 only because the mathematics that is taught to
us tells us so.  It is quite possible  to imagine 4 < 3 and build a
consistent mathematics from it.

I think if you look at almost any aspect of your life you'll find a
thousand things that you accept infallibly.  If you are stopped at a
traffic light, you don't say "I could be wrong but that traffic light is
red" you say "the traffic light is red."  Perhaps one _should_ say the
former but no one does.  Such a level of doubt would be the path to
madness.  Ok, perhaps we can reserve doubt for the "big" ideas but where
is the line?  For myself, a lot of things seem more improbable than the
authorlessness of the Vedas.  That doesn't mean I've surrendered to
gullibility though.

Why restrict it to religions even?  I've never seen a member of Amnesty
International say "well maybe a bit of torture and genocide is not so
bad."  Any attempt by a short-lived, relatively immobile pile of
hydrocarbons to impose a system, some kind of order on the unending chaos
of the universe is arrogance and presumption of the most audacious kind!

But we do it anyway.

I am the heir to people whose accumulated arrogance caused both the the
thoughts you describe as profound and the ones you describe as ridiculous.
They all flowed indistinctly from the same source.  I don't see why I
shouldn't take advantage of all of it.

Speaking only for myself, I did find your questions sincere  (and I think
the Vedas withstood them fine :-) and I did learn from them in the sense
they helped me clarify a lot of the ideas I had in my own mind.  The only
thing I would add is the man of conviction uses doubt as a tool where it
is useful but knows deep down there is truth beyond doubt.

And in all earnestness, I wish the same to you.
