 You can get the complete text of the Mahabharata online at:

 http://bombay.oriental.cam.ac.uk/john/mahabharata/statement.html

 But you will have to first register as a user and agree to the terms
 and conditions mentioned in the agreement.

 Download the Aranyakaparvan of the epic. The story of the Yaksha's
 questions to Yudhisthira and the Nahusha episode as well occur in
 the parvan.
