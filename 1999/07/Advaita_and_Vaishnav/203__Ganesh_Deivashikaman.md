Thanks Ravi for throwing in some clarification on Aiyars andIyengars
as being myself a smartha I always wondered why my grandfather and relatives
used to put Gopi and vibuthi together. Do all smarthas do the Panchayuta
pooja. And how did this Smartha group come into existence may be after Sri
Shankara ?

Ganesh
