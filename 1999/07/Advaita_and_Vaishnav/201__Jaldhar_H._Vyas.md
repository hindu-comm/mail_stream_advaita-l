My impression, I could be wrong, is that the Acharyas think the Agamas are
fine for temple worship etc. but not as a means of Brahmajnana.

Well in Gujarat where I'm from the only significant non-smarta sects are
Vaishnava but what I said applies to Shaivas and Shaktas too.  However it
does seem that Shaivism is a bit more amenable to Advaita interpretation.
The Kashmir Shaivas also follow Shaivagamas but interpreted in an Advaita
way and the Tantras are usually interpreted that way too.

One of the nityakarma prayogas I have (Shuklayajurvediya
Brahmanityakarmasamucchaya of Durgashankar Shastri) says Brahmans should
always wear rudraksha mala and do tripundra even if they are Vaishnavas.
Only difference is if they are Smartas the tilaka looks like this:

 ------
 ------

while if they are Vaishnava it shold look like this

Even a Vaishnava like the 19th Century Saint Swami Sahajanand who founded
the Swaminarayana Sampradaya (Which follows Ramanujacharya) says

Tripundrarudraakshadhrtiryesham syaatsvakulaagataa |
taistu vipraadibhih kvaapi na tyaajyaa sa maadaashritaih ||

None of my Brahmana followers should ever give up their family traditions
of tripundra and rudraksha.

But as this shloka shows it is mostly a matter of family tradition.
