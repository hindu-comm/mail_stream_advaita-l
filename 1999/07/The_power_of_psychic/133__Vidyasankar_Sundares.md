Dear Sri Deivasikhamani,

The article you posted appeared on the online edition of The Hindu, an
Indian newspaper, a week or two ago. It would be better to post just the
correct URL of such articles to the list, instead of reproducing the whole
thing. This would be useful not only for minimizing the size of mails
generated in the list, but also to avoid any potential copyright problems.

Regards,
Vidyasankar
