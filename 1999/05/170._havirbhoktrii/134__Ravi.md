170. havirbhoktrii

"sa brahma sa shivaH sa hariH sendraH so.akShara paramaH
svaraaT.h" iti shruteH, vasu rudra aaditya aakaareNa
haviMShi yajamaanena agnau prakShiptaani svAha mukhena
bhuN^kti iti vaa tathaa ||

According to shruti SHE is brahma, shiva, hari, indra and
svaraaT. SHE enjoys as svaahaa, in the form of vasu, rudra,
aaditya, etc., the offering (havis) of the yajamana of the
sacrifice. Hence she is called havirbhotrii.

yadvaa haviMShii kaalaantara bhaavi phalaani
adR^iShTaatmanaa suukShma ruupaani tat.h tat.h yajamaana
jiiva gataani maayaa avidya shabditaani mukti paryantaM
bhunakti paalayati iti vaa tathaa ||


Another interpretation of this name is: the term "havis"
means the subtle form of the past deeds of the jiiva (who is
spoken here as the yajamaana). These past deeds bear fruits
in the future as unseen destiny. This is called as bhuuta
suukShma and cling to the jiiva and iishvara limited by the
avidyaa and maaya respectively in their states of diversity
and unity. SHE rules them both till they are liberated.

anyatha saMsaarasya anaaditva bhaavena aadima shariraadi
utpattau angiikriyamaaNayaM prapanchasya aakasmikatvaM
akR^it.h abhyaagama prasaN^gaH cha syaat.h iti bhaavaH ||

Otherwise, saMsaara will not be beginingless. And a
beginning has to be accepted to all bodies. Then the
questions of the cosmos springing up sponataneously without
any cause would arise. Hence, it is said the past deeds in a
subtle form cling on to the jiiva and iishvara as unseen
destiny in future.
