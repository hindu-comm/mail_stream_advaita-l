Dear List Members,

I have just discovered the Advaita Vedanda Home Page and have
subscribed to ADVAITA-L from there.

Advaita Vedanta interests me professionally from the interdisciplinary
perspective of religious studies/philosophy/psychotherapy--and
appeals to me personally, as well.

I tend not to intrude on lists to which I subscribe (prefering, for
the most part, to "lurk and learn") but I do sometimes ask questions.

Yours truly,

J. Kingston Cowart, M.S., M.A.(abt)
