But even leaving aside any philosophical talk, we can do better than that.
Empathy is a quality we all have to some degree.  To some extent we can
see through other peoples eyes, feel what they feel etc.  If for example
ones wife or children were to be hurt wouldn't if be felt as if it had
happened to oneself.  When that feeling extends to all things it is
moksha.
