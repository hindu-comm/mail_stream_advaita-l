Advaita Sadhana - tripaJNchaaN^nga yoga - maunam.h
Step 4 of 15. [ from Shankara's aparokshaanubhuuti ].
                     tr. by Swami Vimuktananda

yasnmaadvaacho nivartante apraapya manasaa saha .
yanmauna.n yogibhirgamya.n tadbhavetsarvadaa budhaH .. 107..

yasmaat.h = from which
vaachaH = words
nivartante = turn back
apraapya = without reaching
manasaa = mind
saha = with
yat.h = that
maunam.h = silence
yogibhiH = by the yogins
gamyam.h = attainable
tat.h = that
bhavet.h = should be
sarvadaa = always
budhaH = the wise one

The wise should always be one with that silence wherefrom
words together with the mind turn back without reaching it,
but which is attainable by the Yogins.

vaacho yasmaannivartante tadvaktu.n kena shakyate .
prapaJNcho yadi vaktavyaH so.api shabdavivarjitaH .. 108..

vaachaH = words
yasmaat.h = from which
nivartante = turn back
tat.h = that
vaktum.h = to be described
kena = by whom
shakyate = is capable
prapaJNchchaH = the phenomenal world
yadi = if
vaktavyaH = to be spoken
saH = that
api = even
shabdavivarjitaH = devoid of words

Who can describe That whence words turn away? If the
phenomenal world were to be described even that is beyond words.

iti vaa tadbhavenmauna.n sataa.n sahajasaGYitam.h .
giraa mauna.n tu baalaanaaM prayuktaM brahmavaadibhiH .. 109..

iti = this
vaa = or
tat.h = that
bhavet.h = is
maunam.h = silence
sataam.h = among the sages
sahajasaGYitam.h = called inherent
giraa = by speech
maunam.h = silence
tu = indeed
baalaanam.h = for children
prayuktam.h = ordained
brahmavaadibhiH = by the Teachers of Brahman

This, to give an alternate definition, may also be termed
silence known among the sages as inherent. The observance of
silence by restraining speech, on the other hand, is ordained
by the teachers of Brahman for the ignorant.

In the 18th century, sadASiva brahmendra and upanishad brahmendra were
very important teachers
in southern India. sadASiva brahmendra was a disciple of paramaSivendra
sarasvatI (author of Siva
gItA vyAkhyA and dahara vidyA prakASikA) and grand-disciple of abhinava
nArAyaNendra sarasvatI,
who wrote many upanishad dIpikAs. sadASiva wrote AtmavidyAvilAsa,
advaitarasamanjarI and other
popular works. [16] Numerous legends are reported about his saintliness,
the miracles he worked and the
height of his brahman realization. His simple kIrtanas are meant to
teach advaita values to even the most
illiterate person, and are very popular in Carnatic music today. He
passed away in Nerur in Tamil Nadu,
where annual ArAdhanas are held at his samAdhi-sthala. The sannyAsins in
sadASiva brahmendra's
lineage lived and taught in the extreme south of India, and were widely
known, but their maTha
affiliations, if any, are not known.
