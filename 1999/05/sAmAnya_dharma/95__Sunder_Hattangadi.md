It would also be worthwhile collecting Shri Sankaracharya's own writings
on this issue. He introduces many of his works  with these, and
Sadachara is exclusively devoted to it.

| In this context, I would like to refer the members to look
| into a jewel called "thirukkuRaL"  written by thiruvaLLuvar
| in Tamil. This book was written close to 2000 years ago
| and for the Tamil speaking population this has offered
| guidance for many and many generations (and continues to do
| so). It is very brief and succint. It has 1330 two line
| verses organized into 133 chapters (each having 10 kuRaLs).
| And these chapters are further organized into three
| sections, aRam (dharma), poruL (artha), inbam (kAma), but
| the author does not directly speak of viiDu (mokSha).
|
| Commentary on this work by parimelazhagar is very old and
| famous. It is explains the text from vedic stand point (for
| this reason, has been criticized severely by dravidian
| movements in this century). I have this work and refer to
| it. I have the original commentary in Tamil (little tough to
| read), but I am sure an English translation of the work
| should exist. Some of the insights of parimelazhagar are
| profound and very helpful in understanding the text.
|
|
| When I utter the word vaLLuvar and thirukkuraL (like many
| millions) my heart is filled with reverence, love and pride
| for this great saint. I bow to him again and again.
|
| vaLLuvar has many sections devoted to sAmAnya dharma.
