I was looking at the membership of the list and in the few months the list
has been hosted here we gained quite a lot of new members.  But you're not
posting!  On behalf of the readership, I urge you to ask any questions you
may have about the history, traditions, and doctrines of Advaita Vedanta.
We will do our best to answer them.  And if you can share some wisdom you
may have picked up on these subjects, please tell us, we are anxious to
hear.

Another thing.  One of the reasons we set up advaita-vedanta.org is to
provide resources which will help increase the understanding
and practice of our sanatana teachings.  If you need web space for a
worthy project, contact me, Ravi, or Vaidya and we'll try and help.
