Banal perhaps but hardly flippant.  I see Vivekananda as an apologist
for Vedanta to the Christians, colonialized Indians etc. not as a
faithful guide to Vedic/Vedantic teachings.  I mean the thing about Manu?
Come on, I knew that from Amar Chitra Katha comics.  I'm not saying an
apologist wasn't what was needed at the time--it is difficult for us to
realize what an enormous impact contact with the West had--but frankly I
just don't see what his appeal for today.  The whole phenomenon of the
"Hindu rennaissance" and why it still has any attraction for people is
fascinating to me.  But I think that is veering away a little from the
topic of the list.

The episode of Nachiketas is an interesting and important one and as I
said I believe it is often misinterpreted.  But I won't do anyone the
disrespect of giving them a flippant answer so I will write up my thoughts
and post them a little later.
