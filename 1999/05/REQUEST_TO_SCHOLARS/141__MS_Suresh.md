I request the learned scholars in this list to kindly
enlighten me, if within their knowledge and possibility, on
the "SAMPOORNA HAMSA GAAYATHRI MANTHRA JAPA VIDHI". I would
be grateful to receive a "CORRECT AND UN-MIS-INTERPRETED"
text, provided this type of exchange does not cause
'uncontrolled' deviation of the mis-nomered subject of this
list - advaita vedanta as taught by Shri Shankara.

My grateful thanks also is due to Mr Hudli, with an enquiry
into his interests in rudra sooktha paarayanam.

Thanking you once again,

MS Suresh
