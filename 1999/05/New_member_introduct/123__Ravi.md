Namaste...

My name is Rajesh. I got interested in vedanta about 3 years back. My
introduction to vedanta was through Ramakrishna Vivekananda literature. Then
I started attending the lectures of Swami Paramarthananda at Madras, India
on the Prasthana Trayam(Upanishads, Bhagavad Gita & Brahma Sutra) from Jan.
97. He is a strict exponent of Advaita Vedanta as explained by Sri Shankara.
I am his student (As I cannot call myself his disciple in the strict sense
of the term!) ever since and consider myself extremely fortunate to have got
such a teacher.

It is really nice to have an online satsanga like the Advaita Mailing list
and I am sure I will learn a lot from the discussions.
