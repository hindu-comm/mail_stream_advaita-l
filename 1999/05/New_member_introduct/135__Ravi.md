Dear Mr Ravi, Mr Vyas, Mr Sundaram,

1) Thanks very much for your welcome mail.

2) My name is MS Suresh, i am 29yrs old, am a resident
indian.

3) Shri Shankaraachaarya, to me, is the supreme authority in
philosophy, in religious leadership and in yoga. A mere
contemplation of HH is inspiring. I respectfully look
forward to some enlightening discussions with the scholars
in this sath sangam.

Thanking you,

MS Suresh
