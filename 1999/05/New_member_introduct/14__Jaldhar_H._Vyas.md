The purpose of the introductions is to get an idea of where you are coming
from. Some people have been immersed in  Vedantic concepts and tradition
for a long time prior to joining the list while some have just heard
garbled versions from people who barely understood the subject themselves.
Thus there is a great potential for confusion and acrimony and the
introductions go a little way towards preventing that.
