Dear Sunder,

The translation I have is as follows,

36. Even shouldst thou be the most sinful of all the sinful, thou shalt
verily cross all sin by the bark of wisdom.

With the boat of this knowledge, verily, you can cross the ocean of sin.
For one who seeks liberation, even dharma proves to be a sin.

Hope this may help.

Love to all,

Eddie
