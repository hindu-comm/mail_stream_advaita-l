There are apparently two different questions involved here:
1) Serving, with humility, the people of the world.
2) Reforming the system of the world with a zeal to revolutionize.

There is nothing wrong with the first, and in fact the scriptures advise
strongly FOR it.

There is an important story in the VishhNu purANam.h about a king who leaves his
kingdom and goes to the forest with only a kamaNDalu of water. After sometime
the king feels tired and is about to take a sip of water when a man (Indra in
disguise) comes to him complaining of thirst. The king offers him the water
saying,"Serving you is the same as serving the Lord." The king thereby achieves
mokshha. He doesn't merely acquire punya-points, but achieves the ultimate goal
of liberation itself ! Service and charity, when done with the right frame of
mind, certainly do aid one on the spiritual journey.

There is some stress on charity in the shruti also (taittiriiya upanishhad):
"shriyaa deyaM, hriyaa deyaM, bhiyaa deyaM, saMvidaa deyaM" -- give with
generosity, with humility, with respect, with love.

No one has suggested that the state of no distinctions can be arrived at by
someone who has not realized the Self. The above statements are quite
irrelevant.
