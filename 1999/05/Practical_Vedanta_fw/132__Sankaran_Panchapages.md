        I know that my statements were in fact based on common sense my
whole message was an absurd repetition. But since I read only the later
e-mails on the thread (I didn't update my bookmarks to the new location of
the list and was wondering why the earlier messages weren't appearing in
the archives), I came to the conclusion that people were arguing for some
sort of selfishness or escapism, and just wanted to say what I thought was
common sense. After I read the previous messages in the thread I
understood correctly what Vaidya Sundaram and others were saying and I
accepted my mistake. Again, I am sorry for butting my head in when I
didn't understand the context very well.

Ganesh.
