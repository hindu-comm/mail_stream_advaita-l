        I never said anything about rewriting smRtis. I only wanted to
learn if social service was included in our smRtis, and they seem to be.
(So, I guess advaita is still there for me :-).

believe that he was a jnAni and have faith in what he says.

Okay.  Since "social-service"  seems to be relevant as long as I am
attached to this world, I will do it as part of my dharma. I don't think
learning advaita and trying to practise it are incompatible with that. As
for social service for a jnAni, since He is God, there is no need for Him
to do (physical) social service through the physical body (maybe His
agents are doing it). As I see it, otherwise, there is even no basis for
beliefs in the grace of God, etc. And anyway, even jnAnis are doing what
can be called valuable service to society by teaching the right path.

        I don't think you should say this to anybody, least of all to
somebody who believes in the advaitic tradition. If you mean I am wasting
time on the list, I will not post further on the topic. Things are at
least clearer to me now.
