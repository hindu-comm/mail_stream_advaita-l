That is exactly my point. So, we have to necessarily be careful about
using the word vedAnta. We wouldn't claim the moon is made of green
cheese just because the moon is sublated in the ultimate sense, would
we? Without using the intellect vedAntaviGYana is also not possible,
shravaNa, manana necessarily entail the use of intellect. That however
is not "intellectual understanding" of vedAnta. There is no such
thing.
