 Surely, the GItA has the answers to many perplexing questions, so we
 should consult it to resolve the situation that you point out.

 Briefly, Arjuna finds himself in the situation that most of us are in.
 After listening to the description titled "sAnkhya yoga", which is
 explained as "samyagAtmabuddhiH", the right knowledge of the Self,
 by Madhusudana SarasvatI, Arjuna wants to know (the beginning of the
 3rd chapter) why Krishna is asking Arjuna to take to karma.

 Krishna replies that jnAna yoga is for the sAnkhya's who are explained
 (by MadhusUdana) as having among other qualifications, "brahmacharyA-
 deva kR^itasannyAsAnAm.h", acceptance of sannyAsa (immediately) after
 brahmacharya, and shuddAntaHkaraNAnAm.h, purified minds. Those whose
 minds are not purified, will necessarily have to approach the stage
 of the sAnkhya's through karmayoga. And perfection in karmayoga
 will lead to purification of the mind and eligibility for jnAna yoga.
 (antaHkaraNashuddhidvArA GYAnabhUmikArohaNam.h)

 So I see no problem in a person who is sincerely striving for perfection
 in karmayoga/bhakti yoga  and at the same time wants to discuss vedAnta.
 The danger lies in giving up one's duty to karmayoga and falsely assuming
 that one is fit for jnAna yoga, without the necessary qualifications.

 Both Shankara and MadhusudAna very clearly say that one cannot be
 engaged in both karmayoga and jnAnayoga at the same time. But at the
 same time, nowhere do they say that one who is engaged in karmayoga
 must never discuss or listen/read about jnAna. After all, the
 gItA itself is meant for study by all, regardless of the stage in
 life and the gItA is said to be the essence of vedAnta. Discussions
 about jnAna put things in focus and lets us know where we should be
 aiming.

 So there is nothing wrong in studying and discussing vedAnta in an
 semi-academic sense (which is all that is possible in a forum like
 this one), provided that one does not take it in a wrong sense and
 starts behaving as if he is suddenly enlightened, the whole world is
 a dream, and so on!
