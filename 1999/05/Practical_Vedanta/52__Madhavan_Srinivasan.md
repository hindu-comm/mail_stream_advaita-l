Dear Friend

Yes, this is absolutely true. Is it  a fair thing to think about ourself(or
whatever you say like 'self realization') and dying to attain mukthi  while
lots of people(particularly indians) suffer from evils like
castism,religious riots,hunger,unemployment etc.,?

What a great thought. You are refusing to accept the pains of other poor
people and wants to concentrate on your comfartables by using some gimmicks
like 'perception of the world'. Is this practical vedanta?

This is a pure escapism. We people settled in our lives and comfortably
discussing vedanta in the net. There are people who are struggling for their
day to day life. But you are advising that forget about other poor people
and solve your problem first.

Then whats the use of your 'full enthusiasm' to reform the world. You place
greater emphasis on the teachings of jnani's like Ramana Maharishi than
reforming the society. Can you place greater emphasis on teachings of jnani
than to keep your job safe, to get good hike in your salary, to get good
comfortables etc.?
In my point of view, 'practical vedanta' means : helping others, reforming
the society by eradicating - castism,religious differences,etc.

Madhavan
