        I differ to agree with whom you are calling samnyasin.  Sri Sankara
warned us about such people in his bhaja govindam song.
        Jatilo mundi lunchita Kesa: ....  Just because one calls one self as
a samnyasin one does not become one.  One who truly has renounced everything
is a samnyasin.  Lord Sri krishna although lead a life of householder is
true samnyasin.  Such people can be recognised by there actions from day to
day life.  Just because one wears a saffron colored coth and roaming about
with a stick in his hand calling himself a samnyasin does not become one.
Sri Ramakrishna paramahamsa though being a housholder was a true samnyasin.
