I request list-members to stop this thread. I request Mr Madhavan
Srinivasan to take his reform activities elsewhere. This list is for
discussion of the philosophy expounded by sha.nkara and not for
discussions of social reform, etc. The soc.culture.india.* newsgroups
are a good place for discussions on these topics. Thank you.
