| It's nice, but please don't call it "practical vedAnta". As I said
| "practical vedAnta"  is a misnomer.

Please refer to Swami Vivekananda's series of lectures in London
(Complete Works, Vol 2), titled "Practical Vedanta".

The use of an adjective does not always or necessarily imply the
existence or validity of its opposite. It only means "PRACTISE IT", and
not just have an intellectual grasp of it. In a previous response I had
also mentioned "Vedanta is nothing if not practical, but it has to be
practised".
