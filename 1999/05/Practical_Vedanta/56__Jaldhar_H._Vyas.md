Yes.  Peace and stability is what all people crave.  Your hungry,
unemployed riot victims would not give it up if it were within their grasp
so why should anyone else?

So people care.  How lovely.  What on earth have all the caring, practical
reformers actually done for anyone besides tell us how willing to accept
pains they are?  For the past 200 years socialist do-goodery has been the
political agenda of Hindu reformers.  Far from any progress they are the
ones keeping India backward.  I saw this on my last trip there.  Every
single area of life where free enterprise rules is uptodate, efficient,
and well-run.  Even in out of the way places like Rajkot, our home town,
many aspects of life compare favorably with the West.  But every service
run by the government is hideously unfriendly and inefficient.  It is the
very people that everyone claims to care so much about who suffer because
of this.

Everywhere people are given a choice, they choose crass, materialistic,
uncaring capitalism.  Because it delivers results not slogans.

And you are not even doing that much.

I can. If there is ever a conflict between my job and my Dharma, I'll give
up the job instantly.  But in the mean time, yes I'd like a bigger salary
too.  Why not?  What's wrong with being comfortable?

You are not the first person, to lament the supposed flaws of traditional
Hinduism.  Our history is littered with the wreckage of "reformist"
movements. Either they rejoined the status quo or they disappeared.
Sanatana Dharma has survived, because thank God, it is not
"spiritual"--not 100%.  It is concerned with all the things important to
Humans of which both the spiritual and the material are components.  The
Vedic teaching is very simple.  The person who is enamored of this
world--whether for selfish or noble reasons--must follow the appropriate
injunctions and prohibiions of the Vedas which cover Dharma, Artha, and
Kama.  One who has realized the futility of these pursuits should take
sannyasa and seek Moksha.  You cannot blame the sannyasi for not being
interested inyour petty concerns any more than I can blame you for not
being interested in the size of my salary.

With all due respect what is your point of view worth if it not backed by
deep understanding?  History has shown what happens when people of little
knowledge start trying to eradicate things.
