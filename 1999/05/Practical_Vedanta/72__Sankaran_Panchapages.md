        Yes, I accept that not knowing one's dharma is ignorance. But the
other case, I think, is the result of lack of faith or disbelief. The
whole dharma system is based on the reasoning I gave before. I think a
lesson which we can learn from history is that social structures like the
caste system should not be taken as absolutes, but only as convenient or
efficient. That was one of the major objections raised by the Buddhists,
and in my opinion should have been well taken.
        People being what they are, I really think sooner or later people
with much power, the brahmins will become corrupt, and those with no power
will suffer under oppression. The amazing thing is that the oppressed
suffered silently in India, and didn't revolt as they did in other
countries.

        From the verbal testimony of most jnanis, I would conclude that
spritual seeking and accumulation of wealth are not compatible, or rarely
are (there always are exceptions)

        I am aware of the story, but one cannot take one's morals directly
from epics and purANas, in my experience. Then one might well start eating
meat, since there is considerable evidence in the Mahabharata that many
gRhastha brahmins ate meat. In fact, one can even cite examples of Rshis
like Agastya who did (story of vAtApi). Such instances are in my opinion
not to be questioned since there might be various reasons, like
availability of grain food, etc. which we have no information about. We
should base our dharma on the enlightened souls of our own times. And this
would clearly indicate either sannyAsa in the extreme, or at least a great
degree of self-restraint.

As far as practical vedAnta goes, I don't think pleasure and AtmavicAra
are said to be compatible by any of our teachers.

My argument is not about whether you can work or not in your time, but
ideally, even if one needs to work to occupy one's time, one can do it as
a sort of karma-yoga, and not use the money only for serving oneself, but
maybe even give away all everything which is not strictly necessary for
your religious pursuits.

        Strictly speaking, there is no subsidising or otherwise for a
sannyAsi, right? If a sannyAsi comes to one's door, one just gives him
whatever one can, that is dharma. Supporting maThs, mandirs etc. is fine,
but it seems to me that it all revolves around you, your beliefs, etc.
There should be some selfless use of the money also, right?

        You are saying that making a hodge-podge of the two is a
characteristic of the new "uninformed modern types", while at the same
time there was a tension between the two. I don't understand exactly what
you mean.
        I tend to agree with the Buddha, for whom in society, a person was
superior/inferior only by his moral merit, and the extent of his spiritual
effort. If at all brahmins had at any time a claim to superiority, it was
when they followed the moral laws strictly, and I believe this existed at
some time in the past (call it kRta yuga, etc.), long before the buddha,
(as he himself says) and not much since.

        Considering that according to vedAnta one can be judged only by
the extent to which one has eliminated one's desires and is on the path to
jnAna, the gRhastha is inferior to the sannyAsi. This is just an objective
opinion.

        After Anand Hudli's clarification, I understand that social
service is a part of dharma.
        I don't know what you mean by social service being injurious to
society, etc. It's too vague for me to understand. I think "injury" should
be decided by that portion of society which seems to be needing help. One
should probably not "help" anyone who doesn't want it. But if to the
extent of one's information and capability one cannot see injury
resulting, and sees rather good results, I think one should go ahead and
offer help to anyone that asks for it or appears to need it.

Ganesh.
