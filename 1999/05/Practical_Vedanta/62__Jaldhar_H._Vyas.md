Ah but that's precisely the point.  I don't know.  Which is why I did
write after those words that it is not fair to ask that question in that
way.  But is it fair for you to ask in essence the same question of
others?  See what I'm getting at?

No but this must be done with objectivity and dispassion.  You have
offered anecdotes (and I suppose so did Giri) but what are the actual
facts of the situation?  Responsibility for dealing with that dark side
cannot be shunted off onto religion, government, or any other external
force.

Head on does not necessarily mean via brute force.  There are more subtle
ways.

Rest assured the list policies (which are sent to every new member) do not
include censoring anyone who has a different viewpoint particularly over
such minor matters.  As to my personal comfort, I'm not the one who is
getting worked up over anything.

This is a perfect example of what I mean.  Pollution is caused for the
most part by industrial waste.  It is much worse in India as opposed to
the West because Indian factories are out-of-date and inefficient.  The
government and public can make all the environmental laws they want but as
long as those obsolete factories exist, the problem will continue.  The
only way they will go away is through vigorous competition which forces
non-performing companies out of business.  A side effect of this will be
unemployment.  The compassionate caring people might then petition the
government to save these poor downtrodden masses via subsidies etc. but by
subsidizing inefficiency, they will only prolong their agony.  In fact
such turmoil will only be temporary as excess labor is absorbed by
expanding markets.  There is a role for public action in this.  A
completely laissez faire attitude is also not recommended but brute force
mass action simply will not work.  This is not an opinion but a matter of
historical and economic fact.

Whether one becomes ignorant, remains ignorant or is set free from
ignorance is entirely in their own hands.  This is the eternal teaching of
the shastras.  You need not wait for anyone.
