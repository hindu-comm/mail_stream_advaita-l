But why must it be interpreted this way?

Karma is action. JnAna is cessation of karma ie action.

When you sit in meditation, abiding in yourself, one without a second, then
you're practicing jnAna yoga.

But if you're not a samnyAsin and cannot sit in meditation the whole day and
have to attend to secular duties, then karma is inevitable. When you perform
duties without any attachment, then it is karma yoga.

It is thus, Karma and jnAna cannot be practiced together. And the reasons
are obvious.
