  The answer is yes. Please see my post titled "Request for discussion
  on Common Dharma", that I wrote about a week ago (May 9th). Specifically,
  sAmAnya dharma includes such things as dAna, dayA, satya, asteya, and
  ahiMsA , which if followed provide ample opportunity for social service.

  Instead of trying to answer the seemingly intractable question, "How
  can we do social service and improve conditions in India?", it is
  better to try to answer the questions: "Are we, as Indians, practising
  at least sAmAnya dharma, ie. dharma that should be practised by all
  human beings, regardless of their varNa and Ashrama? If not, how can
  we, as Indians, make sure that we all practise at least sAmAnya dharma
  and then raise ourselves to higher forms of dharma?"

 No, we dont have to adopt anything from any other faith. Our dharma-
 shAstras are sufficient if only we follow them.

  How about starting with the bare minimum dharma that all human beings
  must follow? This has been mentioned as sAmAnya dharma or sAdhAraNa
  dharma in the smR^itis. And I don't think there would be any disagreement
  about the validity of sAmAnya dharma. Most of it is mere common sense and,
  as the Americans would call it, "thinking straight" as opposed  to
  "crooked thinking." And there would be ample opportunity for social
  service even by following sAmAnya dharma!

   This is an erroneous conclusion. Although Brahmins are not supposed
  to hanker after excessive wealth, there is no basis for saying they
  must take to begging. What you are probably referring to is during the
  brahmacharya and sAnyAsa ashrama's? Even to this day, there are those
  who follow this, although I agree the practice is uncommon.

 A counter argument could be: "At least, in America I can earn my liveli-
 hood honestly and live an honest life, without being dragged into
 corruption. That way there is more scope to follow my dharma in America
 than in present day India. And being honest gives me  peace of mind, and
 I can turn my mind to Atma-vichAra." How would you answer this?

  I can understand your concern for social service but I cannot
  understand your line of reasoning. As I see it, you seem to be suggesting
  that since we cannot follow our dharma, we must take to social service.
  While there may be some merit in saying that it is better to be involved
  in social service than not following any dharma, this is missing the
  point. The main point is that we must follow our dharma which in itself
  will present us with opportunity for social service. The main focus
  should be on following dharma; serving others is included in dharma.
  Dharma is the one which will lead us to moksha.
