Truly speaking, the only one 'qualified' to study vedanta is one who has
been initiated into the 'brahma vAkya' by a sadguru.

As I do not fall into this category, I shall gladly stay silent.

| It seems I haven't got my point across. I'll say it one last time. I

| parlance). Please read the mail of mine which you quoted again.

| However this is NOT "intellectual understanding" of vedAnta. There is
| no such thing.
|
| Distinctions of "intellectual understanding" and "practice" is mainly
| a western concept. In pretty much any Indian darshana such a
| distinction is absent.
|
| I am making this point only because it brings out the necessity of
| qualifications for embarking on vedAntic study. vedAnta is not a 3
| credit course which can be "intellectually understood." :->
