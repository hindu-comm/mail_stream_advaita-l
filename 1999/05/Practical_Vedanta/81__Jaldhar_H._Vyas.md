Actually, what I meant to say was that disbelief and confusion are often
due to or increased by ignorance.  Faith needs fertile ground to
grow. Although some people do arrive at atheism, materialism etc. from a
philosophical point of view, I think your average modern person doesn't
have the mental framework to deal with the bewildering amount of
information out there and disbelief seems like the easiest option.

And the Buddhists disappeared from India.  The Jains (equally
objectionable from the Vedic point of view and for much the same reasons)
do believe in it to the extent that most people think of them as just
another Hindu caste.  The lesson I get from that is in the end high
philosophy only has a glancing effect on society.  People for the most
part do not think of "the caste system" as an ideology on the daily level
but a set of interlocking personal relationships.  These are sometimes
oppressive and sometimes not.  I think sociology is more important for
analyzing this than philosophy.

Look at history.  There have been numerous revolts.  Inevitably if they
succeeded they just ended up providing a new class of oppressors.

As far as Advaita Vedanta is concerned, there are two types of spiritual
seeking.  Towards Moksha the domain of sannyasis, in which case you are
right, and towards Dharma which is for grhasthas.  Dharma is not
incompatible with wealth and to some extent depends on it.

Many Hindus do eat meat.  In some parts of Northern India even the
Brahmans eat meat.  (It is only beef which is universally abhorred.)
Shishtachara or the traditions of our elders is on an equal footing with
Shruti, and Smrti as a source of Dharma.  Dravida and Gurjara Brahmans are
vegetarians because it is our tradition not because Shruti or Smrti
forbids it.  (Which as you point out, they don't)

The enlightened souls of today would agree to the value of sannyasa
_for_sannyasis_.  But the Grhastha is different.  He should be moderate
yes, but he is not a sannyasi.  Different rules apply.

Ugh theres that word again :-)  To prevent further confusion, can we use
the word sadhana instead?  I think it is more accurate anyway.

But Dharma is compatible with Kama, and Artha.

Yes, that's true but there are big grey areas.  E.g. is Internet access
frivolous or necessary?  You could argue either way.

But if you have more you can give more right?

Is all self-service done for selfless reasons?  It seems to me enlightened
self-interest is a valid reason for some social service.  Why not Dharma
too?

Ok I'll explain.  There have always been some followers of the Vedas who
thought karma is superior to jnana.  Others thought jnana is superior.
Yet more people said the two had to be done one after the other. but it is
only lately, amongst the ignorant that the very meanings of karma and
jnana have been conflated in such ludicrous ways.

Is there any Buddhist culture of past and present which didn't have social
divisions, elitism, and oppression anyway?  I'm not singling out Buddhism
just pointing out all Human societies have these problems despite what
their philosophers urge because evil is basically an inherent part of
human nature and something that has to be battled constantly.

I don't think there ever was a time when there weren't bad Brahmans and
good ones.  I don't think there will ever be such a time either.

Yes this is true according to Vedanta.  But for followers of the Vedas,
this is only half the picture.  Take for example Maharshi Manu who says in
his dharmashastra that of all the ashrams, the Grhasthas are the best
because they are the support of the other three.

Look at the conduct of the disciples of Shankaracharya today.  When people
go to the mathadhipatis for advice, they don't always recommend sannyasa.
Often they advise doing some yagna or archan etc.  It depends on the
fitness and capacity of the seeker.

I really, really don't want to get into politics here but if you look at
history, you can easily come up with examples of how people with the most
sincere of intentions ended up causing great problems in their societies
due to misguided "reforms".

The only thing I will add to that is one shouldn't get so involved in
helping others, one forgets to help oneself.
