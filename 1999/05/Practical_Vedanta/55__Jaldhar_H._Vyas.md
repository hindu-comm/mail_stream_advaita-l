This is a canard but it is pointless to argue about it with you.  The
pessimist will always see things in the worst possible light and the
optimist will always see things for the best.  Personally, based on what
Giri said and my own experiences in Gujarat and here in America, I incline
towards optimism.  Your mileage may vary.

What makes you think history or the shastras give the full picture of what
happened in the past?  History acts as a filter.  Only the notable deeds
good or bad get remembered by future generations.  The petty criminals of
the past never made it into any history book.  You mention Chandraswami
but who will remember him in 50 years let alone 5000?

I'm running a mailing list and a website, studying Sanskrit, and doing
puja every day.  What are YOU doing?  Ok that's not fair, I know you asked
about Rshi-Munis and neither of us qualify for that rank.  The point I'm
trying to make is that there is so much that we can do with whatever
resourc
es are at hand so why wait around for Rshi-Munis to tell us what to
do?

So the course is clear.  You should organize Bhagawati jagrana and not
charge money for it.  Then the good people will come to you instead of the
ruffians.

Kashmiri Brahmans are called Pandits because at one time every single one
of them was a scholar.  Restoring that part of your heritage (an
eminently doable and practical objective.) is your dharma.

This is the difference between a traditionalist and a modernist in a
nutshell.  The modernist keeps tinkering with his religion to attempt to
fit it to the times.  The traditionalist adapts the times to fit his
religion.  Which will have a more lasting effect in the long run?
