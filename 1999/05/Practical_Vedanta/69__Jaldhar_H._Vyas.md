No the subject is important and deserves to thought about carefully.

The ironic thing is that historically this hasn't been much of a Christian
idea either.  Missionaries have been in India since the time of Vasco Da
Gama etc.  (The Malabar Christians are even older of course but they
didn't proselytize AFAIK)  Those missionaries saw their job as simply
spreading the Gospel of Jesus rather than reforming society.  It was only
in the 19th century when Christianity was going through its own crisis of
faith (due to agnostic/atheistic progressive philoophies) that this kind
of missionary work became a religious ideal.

In both cases, the reason is mainly ignorance rather than some sea change
in the human condition.

The Mitakshara and other Dharmashastras list four different ways of life
for a Brahman which I can't list off the top of my head but I'm pretty
sure at least some of them involve accumulation of wealth.  Of course this
wealth should be used to Dharmic ends but not necessarily to the extent
that one is reduced to penury.

In the Brhadaranyakopanishad King Janaka offers a 1000 cows to the person
who will explain Brahmavidya and Maharshi Yagnavalkya gladly takes them.
We have many examples of Rshis and Pandits who were wealthy householders
as well as those who were forest hermits.

As I said before I believe you are only partially right and there is scope
for seeking pleasure.

If you look at what specifically is laid down as nitya karma for Brahmans,
you find it doesn't take more than an hour-hour and a half per day.  Add
an extra hour or so for daily svadhyaya and you still have enough of
what the shastras would consider "spare time" left over to do a job and
make some money.

And what can you do with that money?  You can subsidize the sanyasi and
other who truly renounced.  You can support maths, pathshalas and mandirs.
I don't know if you saw it but earlier in this thread I gave the example
of my growing Sanskrit library.  If I had no money I would have remained
ignorant.  If I'm not, it is because I have the purchasing power to be
able to get Sanskrit books and the leisure time to read them.

But they can do it.  They just need to make the effort.

Actually it is pre-Buddhistic.  There has always been a certain tension in
Indian culture between te worldly, and ascetic lifes.  What is new is all
these uninformed modern types who try and make a hodge-podge of the two.

Well He is very clear that Moksha is the exclusive province of the
sannyasi and the best a grhastha can do is the preliminaries.  But that
doesn't make the grhasthashram invalid or even inferior, just designed for
a different type of person.

The problem with the argument as formulated above is that it makes a false
oposition between Dharma and social service as if they were north and
south poles. A good deal of Dharma is concerned with other people and a
good deal of "social service" is injurious rather than helpful to society.
