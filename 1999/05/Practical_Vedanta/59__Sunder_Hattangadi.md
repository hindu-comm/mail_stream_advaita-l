namaskaaram .

                Gita's vision is comprehensive and synoptic: for
example,

na karmaNaamanaaraMbhaannaishhkarmayaM purushho.ashnute .
na cha sa.nnyasanaadeva siddhi.n samadhigacchchhati ..

sarva.n karmaakhilaM paartha GYaane parisamaapyate ..

karmaNyakarma yaH pashyedakarmaNi cha karma yaH .
sa buddhimaanmanushhyeshhu sa yuktaH kR^itsnakarmakR^t.h ..

karmaNyevaadhikaaraste ..........

ne hi dehabhR^itaa shakya.n tyaktu.n karmaaNyasheshhataH .
yastu karmaphalatyaagii sa tyaagiityabhidhiiyate ..

sarvadharmaanparityajya maameka.n sharaNa.n vraja .
aha.n tvaa sarvapaapebhyo mokshayishyaami maa shuchaH ..

adhikaara(fitness) and siddhi(attainment) are complementary, and not
incompatible.

| That's a bad example.  As the Gita says, Bhagawan only appears to
perform

before

| the actions.  One who has never performed actions doesn't count.

| Or rather their lack of actions!

|
| As much as some people may wish otherwise, Advaita Vedanta considers
the
| grhastha and sannyasa states to be utterly irreconcilable.
