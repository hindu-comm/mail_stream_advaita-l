Vidyasankar has brought out an important point. Sitting in meditation
is NOT GYAna-yoga. Sha.nkarabhagavat and especially Srimad Sureshvara
never tire of pointing this out. Even Sri MaNDana Mishra who advocates
GYAnakarmasamuccaya and does not call meditating as GYAna. It should
be done (according to him) to stabilize GYAna. Note: I am simplifying
his views here. Meditating is certainly not classified as a karma and
sannyAsis certainly can do it. But, it's not GYAna yoga.
