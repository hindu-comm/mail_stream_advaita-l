I don't know why u r analysing the features of private sector and
government? Did i mention anything about that in my mail?
So finally whats ur point:
It is a safe and good thing to learn sanskrit , do pooja , analysing the
features of jeevan muktha,brahmam and consider everything else (ie concern
about castism,religious riots,poor and downtrodden) as the perception of
mind(maya).

How did u know that? Are u thinking that u r the only person who is thinking
and discussing advaita? Since i am following practical advaita, i didn't
involve in the previous discussions(about theoritical advaita). I was also
thinking about  brahmam, jeevan muktha concepts. Finally i  decided to live
practical vedanta. Now i don't want to think about brahmam, jeevan muktha
concepts. I want to think about the remedies of problems in this world.
(Particularly in India.)
(I read upanishads,yoga vasishta,bhagvad gita etc., and did booja in my
house daily. But now i want to study about cause of castism,
untouchability,religious problems,etc., and want to do my part to eradicate
them.)

I didn't tell that being comfortable is a wrong thing. My question was:
"Can you place greater emphasis on teachings of jnani
than to keep your job safe, to get good hike in your salary, to get good
comfortables etc.?"
Earning more money and so helping more people is a good thing only.

I think u've to change the above statement from

"Hinduism is concerned with all the things important to
Humans of which both the spiritual and the material are components."

to

"It is concerned with all the things important to
Brahmins of which both the spiritual and the material are components."

Castism and Untouchability are the major flaws of traditional Hinduism. If
anybody who is willing to do his part to remove these flaws will not
destruct Hinduism unless Hinduism is only based on castism. Have u ever
think of bad effects of Untouchability?
If u r a bachelor r u ready to  marry a dalit(untouchable) girl to do ur
part to  eradicate untouchability?

If eradicating the evils like castism,untouchability etc are not important
concerns for a person(particularly indian) then i am sure that he will not
attain mukthi in this life.

Its a known fact that if castism and untouchability are eradicated then the
upper caste people can't enjoy their special privileges.
In precise as an indian, practical vedanta means, "eradicate
untouchability,castism and other social evils."
