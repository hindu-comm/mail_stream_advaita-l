Hi.
  I understand now the importance of scripture on the list. I realize that
my e-mail was based only on hearsay and opinion and tended to contradict
scripture. I now know that I was mis-/under-informed on several issues,
and had misunderstood some of the other e-mails. (I understand my views on
buddhist ideas about caste, etc. were sort-of attempting to downplay
smRti, etc.).

        I also apologize to Vaidya Sundaram for not understanding
correctly what he said, and also to other list-members for assuming
(seemingly)  whether one was or was not doing his/her dharma.

Ganesh.
