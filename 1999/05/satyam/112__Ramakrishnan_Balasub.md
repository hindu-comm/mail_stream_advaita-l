Right. For the prepared person, the question "Who am I?" should lead
to realization. Sha.nkara bhagavat has pointed this out in his
aparoxAnubhUti. It is also true that  Ramana Maharshi  advised "lower
order enquiry" to certain people. But, I think we need to keep in mind
that answers are given by gurus according to the needs of the student.
If we read the "Talks with RM", he advised someone to do japa of
Gayatri, someone else to continue with his hatha yoga and pranayama,
and some one else to chant the name of Rama. There is no one magic
bullet for all students. You may find something easy, but Ravi and I
find something else easier. Guess what that is  :-).  Only a satguru
can point out which path will lead to vicAra most naturally for a
student.

That is why it is essential to find a satguru. IMO, the sha.nkara
mathas serve this purpose admirably.

Rama
