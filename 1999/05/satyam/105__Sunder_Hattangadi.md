One solution to this dilemma is to think in terms of all actions as a
form of yaj~na; speech would then be 'vaachik yaj~na' ( vide Gita).

As devotees of truth, we do say a prayer:

  "  priiyataaM puNDariikakshaH sarvayaGYeshvaro hariH .

    tasmi.nstushhte jagattushhtaM priiNite priiNita.n jagat.h .. "

    If we sincerely believe that what we say pleases the Lord, the Lord
will take care of pleasing the listener; He will absolve us of any sin
of hurting others.
