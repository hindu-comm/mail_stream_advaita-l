Actually that is indeed the situation.  The most famous proponent of
this method, namely Ramana Maharshi admits this in many places. I have
read the autobiographies of all his close disciples and they say that
they could not do this for a very long time. For some, it took many
years after Maharshis death to engage in enquiry. Read for eg,
Devaraja Mudaliars autobiography or Ganapati Munis autobiography. Mind
you they even had the benefit of personal association.

It may come naturally for you, but for most people (including me) its
virtually impossible. Since I know you personally, I can well believe
that it comes naturally for you. However, I am quite skeptical of
droves of these internet gurus who attained realization by looking at
a picture of Ramana Maharshi.
