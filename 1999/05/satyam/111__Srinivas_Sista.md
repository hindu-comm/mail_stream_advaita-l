True. He said that. In fact Ganapati Muni did have lot of difficulty in
settling down into enquiry. But, doesn't Ramana Maharshi also suggest
enquiring about lower order questions which will eventually lead to the
grand enquiry "who am I"? I was trying to get at that. I should have
explained a little more. What I was driving at was, enquiry need not
start with "who am I". Since that is the last enquiry one undertakes
before extinction.
