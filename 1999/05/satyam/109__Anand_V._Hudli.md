 In my opinion, the approach should be:

 Whether we speak the truth or otherwise may not always be
 discerned by others but we cannot hide the fact that we spoke
 the truth (or falsehood) from the Self (Atman), which is the
 eternal witness in the states of waking, dream, and sleep.

 So one who disregards or looks down upon his Self and
 tries to deceive his own Self is indeed steeped in ignorance.

 Atmaiva hyAtmanaH sAxI gatirAtmaa tathA.atmanaH |
 mA.avama.nsthAH svamAtmAnaM nR^INaaM sAxiNamuttamam.h ||
                                (Manu Smriti 8.84)

 The Self alone is the witness of the Self, and the Self is the
 refuge of the Self. Do not disregard your own Self, the best witness
 among men.

 Of course, we can have the same attitude with respect to God,
 provided that we think of God as essentially the same as the
 Self, not as living in some remote place and watching over us
 like a spy.

 Anand
