As far as I know there is no commentary on the Samkhyakarikas by
Shankaracharya. (Given the rather rude things he has to say about samkhya
in Brahmasutrabhashya, it would be rather odd.)

There is a bhashya on this work by one Gaudapada but whether this is the
same prson as the Vedantin I don't know.
