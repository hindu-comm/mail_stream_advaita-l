That's why Advaita Vedanta also places importance on the Guru and
parampara.  Not only your interpretations but the interpretations of those
who have gone before you are also available to you in order to make sense
of your experiences.

I'm 100% sure they did have neurological explanations.  It's interesting
that you consider neurological explanations 'mundane'.  'mundane',
'religious', 'philosophical', how is a conglomeration of carbon, hydrogen,
and oxygen atoms with trace impurities (To use the mundane biochemical
explanation :-) able to use these terms?  Human beings are conscious, they
are self-aware, everything else proceeds from that.
