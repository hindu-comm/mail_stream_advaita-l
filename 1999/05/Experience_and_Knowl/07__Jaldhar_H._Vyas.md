They are mutually exclusive.  The apparent contradiction goes away not by
ignoring it but by realizing that Advaitins and Dvatins are opereating
from different definitions of 'self-realization'.

The mainstream of Hinduism would not support such skepticism as to the
power of language.  Look at the meticulous care with which the Vedas have
been preserved, the early development of linguistics, grammar, and
Mimamsa.  Even the influence of Tantra shows what esteem language has been
held in.  Far from being an obscuring veil over reality, it is in fact the
_only_ method for apprehending reality.  It is far superior to experience.

But Advaita Vedanta insists we can speak of the ultimate.  It is something
that can be known and that knowledge can be communicated to others.
