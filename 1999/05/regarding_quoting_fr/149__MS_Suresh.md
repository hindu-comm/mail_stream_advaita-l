In my response i had mentioned that "some publications may
prohibit quoting without author's permission..." i wanted it
to rather state correctly as "some authors may prohibit
quoting...". Obviously, it is of no concern to the
publications about copyrights issues which are "personal" to
the author!

Sorry for the error.
