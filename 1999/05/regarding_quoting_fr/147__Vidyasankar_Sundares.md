As far as mailing list postings are concerned, you can quote short extracts
without explicit permission, for the sake of elucidation/criticism etc., and
for making your own point. Take care to give proper attribution and
publication details (publisher, year, page numbers). Avoid making a posting
that consists entirely of a reproduction from a book. It would be a better
idea to simply give the details of the book. The same goes for online
newspaper articles also. Giving the URL should be sufficient, instead of
including the entire text.
