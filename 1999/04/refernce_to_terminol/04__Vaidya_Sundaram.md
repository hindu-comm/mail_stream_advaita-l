namaskArams.
 I was wondering if any list members know of any references to a sort of
dictionary of advaitic terms. I am not conversant in sanskrit and while reading
some translated works the sanskrit terms are listed as they are and it would
help to have a reference to such a list of terms ...

thanks in advance.
Cheers,
Vaidya.

I have seen a book by Prof. Grimes

Grimes, John A., 1948
A concise dictionary of Indian philosophy : Sanskrit terms
defined in English
Albany, N.Y. : State University of New York Press, c1989.


Besides this, you may be knowing the presence of Monier-Williams
Sanskrit-English dictionary on the net.

MIME-Version: 1.0

To a devotee of God, it does not matter what stage of life (s)he
is in and what order (s)he belongs to. For a person whether he is
a brahmachAri or a gR^ihasta or sannyAsi or some other thing, how
does it matter and what use of it, if one had surrendered the
lotus of one's heart to the Lord. Then the Lord belongs to that
devotee and the devotte to the Lord. All the burdens of life are
lifted by God instantly and HE bears it for the devoteee.


vaTurvaa gehii vaa yatirapi jaTii vaa taditaro
naro vaa yaH kashchidbhavatu bhava kiM tena bhavati |
yadiiyaM hR^itpadmaM yadi bhavadadhiinaM pashupate
tadiiyastvaM shaMbho bhavasi bhavabhaaraM cha vahasi || 11 ||

                                shivAnandalaharii of shankara

The word pashupatI denote Ishwara. He is the Lord (pati) of all
the jIvA-s (pashu).

There is a very beautiful musical rendering of shivAnandalaharI
by shrI Balamuralikrishna, he has poured his bhakti and the
musical genius in this work, and it is reflected in every verse
of this recording.
