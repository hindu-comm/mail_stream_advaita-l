Like the seeds of the ankola tree moving towards the tree
itself; Like the iron filings clinging to a magnet; like the
love, attention, and thoughts of a chaste woman flowing
towards her husband; like a creeper tightly entwining and
embracing the supporting tree and like the river rushing
towards her beloved Ocean, the constant flow thoughts
towards the lotus feet of Ishwara is called as bhakti.
