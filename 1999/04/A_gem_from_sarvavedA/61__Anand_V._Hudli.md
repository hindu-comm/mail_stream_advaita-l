 There is no cessation of the suffering due to the three-fold afflictions
 (tApatraya - namely adhyAtmika, Adhidaivika, and Adhibhautika) for
 human beings either in the abode of Yama (Death) or at home. But seeing
 that there is a small pause (when the suffering temporarily stops), the
 foolish take it to be happiness!!

 Note: This little known work attributed to Shankara is actually a
 lengthy work consisting of some 1015 verses, which makes it longer
 than the vivekachUDAmaNi. Needless to say, it is full of pithy
 observations and instructions filled with wisdom.

 Anand
