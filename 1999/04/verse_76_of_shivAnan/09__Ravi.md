bhaktiH mahesha pada pushhkaraM aavasantii

Like dark clouds giving rain in abundance which fill the
lakes, bhakti towards the lotus feet of the Lord gives the
showers of bliss and fills the lake of devotee's mind with
joy. Besides bhakti there is no other easier way to harvest
the purpose of one's life.

Like the scorched earth cooled by the nectar-like rain from
dark clouds, let the mind scorched by desires and tired of
running eternally behind the mirage of ephemeral pleasures,
attain peace from the ocean of bliss arising from the lotus
feet of God.

   || AUM namo bhagavate rudrAya ||

  The Rishi of this mantra is nArada, the devatA is shrI rudra
  (Shiva),  and the meter anuShTubh.

  pramuJNcha dhanvanastvamubhayorArtniyorjyAm.h |
  yAshcha te hasta ishhavaH parA tA bhagavo vapa ||

                     (Shri Rudram: anuvAka 1; Rik 10)

  pramuJNcha - untie
  dhanvanaH  - of (Your) bow
  tvaM       - You
  ubhayoH - of both
  ArtniyoH - ends of the bow
  jyAm.h   - bow string
  yAshcha  - and those
  te haste - in Your hand
  ishhavaH - arrows
  tA - them
  bhagavo - O Bhagavan (God)
  parAvapa - give up


  O Bhagavan, Rudra! (Please) untie the bow string from both
  ends of Your bow. And (please) lay down those arrows that
  are in Your hand.

  Here the devotee is requesting Rudra to assume a mild form
  for the benefit of His devotees. The form of Rudra with
  His bow ready to discharge  fiery arrows creates fear in
  the minds of people. So the votary prays here that Rudra
  may loosen the bow string from the bow and may lay down the
  arrows that He holds. It is customary to untie the bow string
  when the bow is not about to be used. Such untying will signify
  that Rudra is not in a mood to destroy but in a more benevolent
  mood.


  sAyaNAchAryabhAShyam.h   (Commentary of sAyaNAchArya)

  he bhagavo bhagavanpUjAvanmahadaishvaryasaMpanna rudra tvaM
  dhanvanastvadIyasya dhanushha ubhayorArtniyoH koTyoravasthitAM
  jyAM maurvIM pramuJNchAvaropaya | yAH te hasta ishhavaH
  vartante tA api parAvapa parityaja |

  O Bhagavan (God) Rudra! You are endowed with great lordship
  and worship (by others). Untie the bow string from the two ends
  of Your bow. Abandon the arrows in Your hand.


  Notes based on the commentary of BhaTTa BhAskara:

  1) atra namaste rudretyArabhya navabhirmantraiH kruddhaM devaM
     prasAdyAtaH paraM tasyopasaMhArakAraNAnyupasaMhArayituM
     prakramate|

     Now, with the (first) nine mantras beginning with "namaste
     rudra...", (the devotee) propitiates the angry God (Rudra).
     Henceforth, (the devotee) begins to make (Rudra) withdraw
     the causes of destruction (the forces of destruction).
  2) tatra dvau pratyaxakR^itau mantrau tritIyaH paroxakR^itaH |

     The (first) two mantras address Rudra directly while the
     third addresses Him indirectly (in third person).

  3) The word "bhagavAn.h", which means God, should be understood
     as "One who possesses bhaga." What is bhaga?

     aishvaryasya samagrasya dharmasya yashasaH shriyaH |
     GYAnavairAgyayoshchaiva shhaNNAM bhaga itIraNA ||


     The (possession of) these six in full is called bhaga
     - supremacy (lordship over all), dharma, fame, wealth,
       knowledge, and renounciation.

     There God or bhagavAn is One who has all these attributes
     in full.


     || AUM namo bhagavate rudrAya ||
