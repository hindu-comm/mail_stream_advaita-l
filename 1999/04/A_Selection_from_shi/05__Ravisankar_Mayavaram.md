shrI shrI ramaNa mahaR^iShi chose 10 verses from shrI
shankara's shivAnandalaharI to help his disciples understand the
substance of the work. The verses (in the order) are:
61, 76, 83, 6, 65, 10, 12, 9, 11 and 91. This set is a kind of
precise summary of the whole text and its purport.


In the next post verse 61 will be discussed which describes
bhakti. If you recollect, almost a year back, shrI nageshwara rao
(chelluri at aol.com) wrote to the list that AchArya of kAnchi maTha
referred him to the verse 61 to answer the question on bhakti.


Ravi

O mInanetrI, like a river rushing to her beloved ocean, may all
my thoughts flow towards Thy lotus feet.
