namaste.  The following is my understanding.

The clause taken above is incomplete when taken out of my posting.
I was saying in that post " ... as long as we think we are
limited by this embodiment, we are bound by the manas ...."

If we don't think we are limited (from intuition and experience), we are
not limited. If we think we are limited, we are bound by the manas.
This thinking is done through the manas.

Yes. As I understand, the common word for all of these is antahkaraNa,
the internal sense organ. I amplified on this in my second post on the
mind.

The agent of knowledge, the jeeva, i.e. the Atman with its main
limiting upAdhi which is antahkaraNa is the kartA and is the one
that remembers the thoughts.

I think we should not mix the knower, the knowledge and the instrument
of knowledge. We can distinguish between these three in the realm of
the jeeva, i.e. where Atman is limited by the limiting upAdhi.
The knower is the jeeva, the one that remembers the thoughts;
instrument of knowledge is the manas through using which the jeeva
acquires the thought; the perceived knowledge gained by the jeeva
is the thought.

In the Atman realm, there are no thoughts, no receiver of thoughts
and no instrument to receive the thoughts.

As I understand, the enjoyment and suffering comes, *not* from being
unable to distinguish the thoughts from the receiver, but *because* the
receiver thinks that he/she is the agent of action/knowledge.

You used the word "witness" (lower case) in the above quoted sentence.
As I understand, at the thought level, there is no witness. There is
only kartA, the agent.

I do not understand this. I would be grateful for clarification.

I notice you have used the Witness (upper case) here. I assume that
is intentional and you are discussing a different level (of understanding)
here. I do not know much about Patanjali Yoga system, hence cannot
comment on it. But from the vedanta, Witness and thoughts are at
different planes (if you mean by Witness, the Atman, the ever-present
turIyA state). When we are engulfed and ridden with the thoughts,
the Witness is only in the background, ungraspable in the thought-mode.
When we look ourselves as the Witness, there are no thoughts. Hence,
both (thoughts and Witness) cannot be simultaneously present for
deciphering.

Further, doesn't the Witness concept lead to an infinite loop (Witness to
the Witness to the Witness....)?
