namaste.

Thanks very much for the suggestions.  The background for this
particular posting (and to the three others hopefully that follow)
is that I have volunteered to address our local discussion group
on this topic, specifically vedantic explanation of the functioning
of the mind. As a prelude to that, I am posting it to this group
with the hope that the learned members give me suggestions for an
improved product of presentation.

I realize specific references to scriptures are missing and I gave
only generalized upanishadic references. That is because, the text
I prepared is in the form of an oral presentation to a group. I will
include specific references in the latter postings. I am following
Shri Shankara's bhAshhyAs on ChAndogya and Br^hadAraNyaka upanishads,
and on Brahma SUtrAs, specifically English renderings by Gambhirananda,
Thibaut, Vireswarananda and others. Specific reference to individual
SUtrAs and upanishadic verses will be provided in the postings.

Yes, I am hoping to develop antahkaraNa as the main upAdhi on the Atman
and that manas, buddhi, chitta as different names of antahkaraNa depending
on the context and function.

Thanks very much for the constructive suggestions.

Regards
Gummuluru Murthy
