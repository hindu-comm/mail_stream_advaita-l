For those who can read Tamil, there is a treasure house on
AchAryA's life history: 'dEivaththin kural - vol. 5'.

mahAsvAmi of kAnchi has elaborately discussed Adi sankarA's
life, running close to 700-800 pages.

Compilation of His discourses based on His excellent research
work over a period of time.
