This is a test of the new advaita-l list.  Please update your bookmarks,
mail aliases etc. to reflect these changes.

Send submissions to the list to:

advaita-l at lists.advaita-vedanta.org

Send commands to the list server to:

listserv at lists.advaita-vedanta.org

You can get a list of commands the server will accept by sending mail to
the address above with the word "help" (minus quotes) in the body of the
message.  If you have problems you can reach the list administrators at:

listmaster at lists.advaita-vedanta.org

Finally, we are starting a web site at

http://www.advaita-vedanta.org/

Currently, there is next to nothing there but if you have suggestions we'd
like to hear them.
