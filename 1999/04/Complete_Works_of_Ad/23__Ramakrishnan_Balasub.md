It's a 10 volume set. When I visited India in December, I visited the
Samata bookstore and talked to the owner/proprietor of the shop. She
told me that the sets have been completely sold out. I was able to get
4 volumes. Apparently they put in about 4 lakhs of ruppees in the late
70s and they got sold out just recently! Remember 4 lakhs was a very
large sum in the late 70s.  Apparently such books do not make any
money, and actually they incurred a huge loss. She said they are
trying to publish it again, although the paper quality will not be as
good due to some new import restrictions on paper. She wasn't sure
when it would come out. C'est la vie.

A bare-bones web-page of samata books can be found at

Maybe the set has come out already. See
