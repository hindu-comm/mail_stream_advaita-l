was last for the members who were recieving the mail as a
digest. In order to set it back, please send a mail to
listserv at advaita-vedanta.org and in the body type the
message,

SET ADVAITA-L DIGEST

This should do the job.  To find out more about your

How does the assurance develop? If we take as a given that realization
may not come in this lifetime, then how is assurance developed short of
that? This may seem like a pointless academic question, but to me it's
vital. I'm awash in philosophical doubts and questions as always, and
I'm having problems understanding how I can suspend judgment and proceed
on faith for, in all probability, the entire remainder of my life. So if
there are some grounds for assurance prior to full realization, but
consisting of more than just being convinced by intellectual arguments,
then I would very much like to know what they are.

As with my original question, I ask this, not to be confrontational, but
with a sincere wish to find out the answer.

Robert.

namaste,

       Thank you for the welcome.

       My name is Sunder Hattangadi. I am a retired psychiatrist. The
study of the mind has fascinated me since school days, and has led me to
explore the Hindu traditions and the Western ones. This has further
developed into forays in mysticism, philosophy, comparative religion,
etc. The advaita approach, as exemplified by the Upanishads and
Bhagavadgita, have appealed to me from the intellectual, emotional, and
practical aspects, to a degree not even closely approximated by any
other. That the greatest mystics of all traditions speak a similar
language to advaita has been unutterably satisfying.

      By joining this list I hope to extend my familiarity with
Shankara's works, and share some insights that my education may have
helped me explore.

Best regards,

Sunder
