Regarding complete works, when I was in India recently I
learnt that Samata books is working on a new edition of the
10 volume set. The old edition is almost out of print. I
saw few of the 10 volumes available in Giri Trading Company,
Mylapore, Madras. I bought only the V1 and V5 though. V1 has
all shloka-s and V5 has bhAShya-s to sahasranAma and
trishati.
