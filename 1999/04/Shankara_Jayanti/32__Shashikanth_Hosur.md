Namaskaram
My Guru Sri Mata Amritanandamayi gives a beautiful example.
In a house there are different rooms.  In each room there is electric bulb.
When you switch on the switch in a particular room them only that
bulb lights all the bulbs do not light up.  It is the same electricity thats
flows through flows through all the bulbs and switching on one switch in a
room does not light up all the bubls in all the rooms.  One has to turn on
switch in each room.  Similarly although everyones true nature is one as
each person has to remove the ego that remove that identification of the
self with the Lower self.  One has turn on the switch to tune oneself with
the Cosmic Consiousness.
