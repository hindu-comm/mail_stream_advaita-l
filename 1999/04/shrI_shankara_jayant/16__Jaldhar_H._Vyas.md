The Sanskrit name is Ardhanarishwara.  In the list of works of
Shankaracharya posted by Dr. Marur, there is a ardhanarishvara stotra
mentioned.  There is nothing singularly Advaitic about the Ardhanarishwara
for,  It is one of the cannonical forms of Shiva-Shakti mentioned in
Shaivagamas (Which can and usually are interpreted from dvaita or
vishistadvaita viewpoint.)
