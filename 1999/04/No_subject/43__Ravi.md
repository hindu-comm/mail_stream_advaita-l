We have moved all the members from TAMU List to the new one,
except the two concealed members. I will move them today and
keep their status concealed. For this reason I am sending
this  mail to the old list, so that they will know that they
are yet to be moved. I have to figure out who they are
first!

I take this opportunity for Jaldhar for all his HARD WORK in
setting up the listserv on his machine and doing all the
background work.  Many many thanks to him.

We have not moved the old-archives yet.  I will do that by
this weekend. Upto 98 first half, I have it on my disk, you
all should be able to get them using GET command. I am going
to request the LISTSERV of A&M to close the list by June 1st
and keep the archives on for a year more on the WWW. I am
not sure whether they will do the latter.

Thank you.

Ravi
