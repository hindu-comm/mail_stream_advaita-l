 He should mercifully initiate into Truth the sisya who approaches him in a
proper manner, who longs for release, who duly practises the prescribed
austerities, whose mind is peaceful and who has acquired the qualities of
sama etc.

 The abhayadhAna should first be given to the firghtened person, and then
only should upadesa be made. By the expression vidvAn etc, it is conveyed
that after freedom from fear for one subject to it has been vouchsafed, next
upadesa should be given consistent with qualification to receive it.

vidvAn: the emminent knower of Brahman, the preceptor.
mumuksave: to him who longs for release.

sAdhu yathoktakArine: to him who observes the prescribed austerities. By
this is conveyed that the sisya should be "sista", one qualified to be
instructed.  For it is said that "Not by mere prajn~A intelligence can this
be obtained by one who does not desist from bad behaviour (conduct) ... who
has not controlled the mind (Katha).

The Guru should make the upadesa to one who has qualified himself by
detaching his mind from objects of sense pleasure, and has controlled his
senses. For, such an instruction to a fit individual, is beneficial to the
whole of creation. For such a teaching to an apt sisya makes him ealsie and
he then inturn teaches it to another fit individual and this way of teaching
facilitiates the easy comprehension of the ultimate truth.

with commentary by Sri Chandrasekhara Bharati of Srngeri.

Pörnam adah` pörnam idam pörnaat pörnam udach`yaté |
Pörnasya pörnam ädaya pörnam éva avasish`yatè ||

The Absolute[adah] remains Perfect [poornam]as before, while the derivatives
are also Perfect [idam, poornam,]. Even though a Perfect is derived from the
original Whole, Perfect [poornasya, poornam, aadaya], the Original Perfect
remain Whole and Perfect.[poornam, eva, avasishyate.]
