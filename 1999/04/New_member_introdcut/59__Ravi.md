Thank you for your reply.I live in a small country town on the outskirts of
Melbourne Australia and am a member of a small group who are connected with
The Study Society London. The Society was founded by Dr. Francis Roles who
was a student of P.D.Ouspensky, who before his death in 1947 urged Dr.Roles
to continue to search for the source of the teaching of which they only had
fragments. In May 1961 Dr. Roles went to India and was introduced to His
Holiness Shantanand Saraswati the Shankaracharya of the North, and Dr.Roles
realised that at last he had found the source and the fragments we had,
were indeed fragments of Advaita. We were made free of the wisdom of His
teaching in many meetings with Him over the following years. We were taught
to Meditate and the Meditation has become the conerstone of the teaching.

We are constructing a web page www.angelfire.com/md/melstudy/

God Bless You.

regards Eddie Dawson.
