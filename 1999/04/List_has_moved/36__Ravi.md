Dear List members,

Advaita-L has been moved from TAMU Listserv to Listserv at
advaita-vedanta.org hosted by advaita sa.nshodana kendra. We
are testing the move now. So please put up with any
incovenience.

shrI shankara jayantI is celebrated on 20th April this year.
Actually is comes on the shukla pakSham panchami of the
vaishakha month. It is also known as the mAdhavi month of
vasanta ritu.

Like the fragrance of jasmine and the purity of its white
color, may the discussions on advaita-vedanta flourish on
this new server.

List Administrators of the new server are

Jaladhar Vyas
Vaidya Sundaram
Ravi Mayavaram

It is hosted by Jaldhar Vyas on his machine.



Thank you.

bhava shankara deshikame sharaNam
