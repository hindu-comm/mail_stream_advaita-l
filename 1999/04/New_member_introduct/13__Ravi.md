Subject: Re: Brief introduction

Namaste,

As desired a brief introduction about my self.

I am a north Indian Brahmin born at New Delhi in July 1951(Though my parents
belong to Poonch city in Kashmir, that part of Kashmir presently in
occupation of Pakistan) My father is a Priest at a temple in New Delhi. I am
a professional Advocate practicing at Delhi High Court since 1975. Coming
from a religious background I have deep inclination in study of scriptures.
Advaita Vedanta attracted me from early childhood and in my own humble way I
have tried to understand this philosophy. Swami
Vivekananda has great influence on me. I had a good fortune to read complete
works of Swami Vivekananda.  I am keen to participate in the list with a
desire to learn more about practical aspects of Advaita Vedanta to be
followed in the present state of life when the whole society seems to be
heading towards materialistic consumerism.
