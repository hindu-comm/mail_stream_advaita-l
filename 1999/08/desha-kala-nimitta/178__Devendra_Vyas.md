swami. vivekananda says that the absolute appears as the phenomenal world to
us because of maya,this he calls nama-rupa and also space-time
-causation.now,this explanation of his is very similar to kant's
analysis,but swamiji says that this was first worked out in the vedanta and
was termed as desha-kala-nimitta.while references to nama-rupa are plentiful
in vedantic texts,can anyone tell me where a reference to desha-kala-nimitta
can be found,--devendra.r.vyas.
