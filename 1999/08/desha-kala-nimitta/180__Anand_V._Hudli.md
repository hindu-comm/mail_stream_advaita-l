    The desha-kAla-nimitta concept naturally follows from the
    descriptions in the upanishads. In the advaita-prakaraNa of
    the GauDapAda kArikA, it is explained how the Self is said to
    appear as individual souls just as AkAsha (space) exists as
    delimited inside pots. Also, anything that is born must die,
    (see gItA: "jAtasya hi dhruvo mR^ityuH)so it naturally follows that
    anything that is born is delimited by Time, ie. its occurence is
    limited to a period of time. There is no recourse to Western
    philosophy involved in arriving at these conclusions.

  Anand
