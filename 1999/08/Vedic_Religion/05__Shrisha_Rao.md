Will do, although it will take time.  However, all things being the
same, I'd much rather read Shankara himself with the aid of his
commentators to learn what his refutation of the Pancharatra is,
rather than try to get a filtered and possibly discolored version
through a third party (with all apologies to Oberhammer).

And my point was only that since the Mahabharata and other texts
(Bhagavata and other Puranas, as well as the shathapatha-brAhmaNa) do
accept the Pancharatra, such acceptance cannot be considered an
invention of Yamuna or Ramanuja, although one may disagree with their
theology, or even with their style of defense of the Pancharatra (as
perhaps we both do).

Certainly I would agree that Madhva cannot, by himself, be taken as an
absolute authority on Advaita, and what he says about it should be
thoroughly cross-checked.  The same standard should, of course, apply
to others as well.

However, that was not the only point; I still fail to see why, if
difference in release is *denied* by the Pancharatra, it should be so
vigorously objected to by Shankara who otherwise agrees with it, but
equally vigorously defended by Yamuna, et al, who otherwise disagree
with it.

No, I just wanted to check what the position of the commentators was.

Thanks, but I probably won't need your help, although it may take me a
few weeks to get up to speed on the material (our library carries the
ABORI, but getting a copy and reading it is what will take time).
