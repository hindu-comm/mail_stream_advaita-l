I appreciate that position. I hold a slightly different view. I think
sometimes an appreciation of the variation of a philosophy over time
has some value to it. It's not merely a question of academic interest,
but can help in refining philosophical  views also. At least, it has
helped me in understanding many points. I'll try to explain this point
with reference to the pA.ncarAtra later.
