Thanks for the summary of the commentators views on the
pA.ncarAtra.Although, I think it is not entirely relevant to my point.
Anyway, please read Oberhammers paper on Sha.nkaras refutation of the
pA.ncarAtra in the ABORI , "An unknown source in the refutation of the
pA.ncarAtra," ABORI Vol LVIII-LIX, pp 221-223. Oberhammers comments on
sha.nkaras commentary are quite interesting. Sha.nkara makes his point
very clear that he regards the pA.ncarAtra as casting a slur on the
veda. BTW, there are a few other places where he ridicules the
pA.ncarAtra doctrine, though not naming it. Even Gaudapada refers to
it.

Again, my point was this: From various works (not sha.nkaras alone),
bhAskaras commentary, yAmunas reply to someone he calls "revered
commentator", vAcaspati and sha.nkara, it is clear that all four
commentators (not yAmuna) held that the pA.ncarAtra scriptures talked
about creation of jIvas. Ramanuja was the first commentator (known)
who thinks otherwise. So, it is quite likely that this was a later
evolution of the pA.ncarAtra, or a doctrine of a minor pA.ncarAtra
text. A further evidence in this regard is that yAmuna is not able to
produce any bhAshhyakAra who thinks that the pA.ncarAtra is vedic.
Even the commentator he reveres is against the pA.ncarAtra!

All these post Ramanuja works are of  near-zero use in judging
historical evolution upto the point of Ramanuja.

Prof. Torellas textual study shows otherwise.

Should have been obvious. Since textual comparisons have shown that
Kashmir Shaivism influenced the ahirbudhnya, the latter has layers
which are as recent as 10th century or later. So studies on the
ahirbudhnya alone cannot reveal how the pA.ncarAtra doctrine evolved.
Further textual comparisons are required. Right?

Strong enough for me to suggest a strong possibility.

Mere speculation, since yAmuna himself did not know of any commentator
who supported his views on the pA.ncarAtra.

vAcaspati who was a sarvatantrasvatantra? :-). The same vAcaspati who
defends nyAya and sA.nkhya vigorously against advaita in his other
texts? I doon't think soo :-). And were you watching over Bhaskara's
shoulder? :-). I'd think when Bhaskara refutes a doctrine that he must
have studied it and *since* he wasn't satisfied with it, he disliked
it. Why put the cart before the horse? Can we take it then that since
Madhva does not trust advaita, he did not study it carefully then?

This has nothing to do with my point, which was a historical analysis.

Sure, in a historical analysis fragments of bhAshhyas have to be
relied on. The end result is that we cannot be 100% sure (as in any
historical analysis), but can get strong pointers on the evolution of
various doctrines. of course, even if we had the full bhAshhya, people
may speculate (like you did) that there may have been other unknown
bhAshhyas. That is useful for pA.ncarAtra apologists, but not in a
historical analysis.

However, luckily the entire argument of commentator X on the
pA.ncarAtra is reproduced by sudarshanasUri, a subcommentator of
Ramanuja. Bhaskaras bhAshhya is available in its entirety. Yamunas
AgamaprAmANyam is also available. My mail was a historical analysis
and unfortunately you have misunderstood my intentions (as seen from
quoting from kalpataru and other late texts). Oberhammer also gives
the relevant extracts from the unknown bhAshhyakAra reproduced by
sudarshanasUri. My mistake,  if I had given the full reference to
Oberhammers paper and if you had read it this confusion might not have
arisen. Oberhammers paper is key in my analysis. Let me know if you
can't get this easily. I owe you one for the paper of Ramachandra
Dikshitar you sent me.
