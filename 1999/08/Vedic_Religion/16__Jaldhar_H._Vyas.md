I was going to ask abouth this.  The Vaikhanas school claim to be a shakha
of the Krshnayajuraveda and even have a shrautasutra, grhyasutra etc.  Yet
they also have agamas.  So what does that tell us about the origins of
pancharatra?  Have any later scholars considered this?

Also the term 'Satvata' is that a synonym for Pancharatra and/or Bhagavata
or something else differently?
