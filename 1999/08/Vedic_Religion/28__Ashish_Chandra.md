The import of what I am saying is that there *must* definitely have been a
process that a person had undergone before he became fit to *receive* the
mantra. I am not saying that the Mantras were the conclusion of a research
but that the state that enabled one to *see* the Mantras was the result of
that research/experimentation. So the statement that Rishis just somehow saw
the Mantras does not hold out. Otherwise, its quite possible that many of
the current Siddh Purushas as well as realized souls should have been able
to *see* the Mantras.

As far as the statement "everything is made of air, fire, water, earth and
ether" is concerned, where has this fact not held out ?
