The verse from mahAbharata is

sAnkhyaM yogaH pAn~charAtraM vedAH  pAshupataM tatha |
Ajn~yA siddhAni kaunteya na hantavyAni hetubhiH ||

In this context AchArya further quotes from pushpadanta's shiva mahimna
stotram

trayii saankhyaM yogaH pashupati-mataM vaiShnavamiti
prabhinne prasthaane paramidaM adah paththyamiti cha |
ruchiinaaM vaichitryaat.h R^ijukuTila naanaapatha jushaam
nR^iNaaM ekogamyaH tvamasi payasaam arnava iva ||


Besides this kAnchi periyavaa also refers to harsha's naishhada where
the poet compares the difficulty of damayanti in choosing the true naLa
from the 5 (naLa, indra, varuNa, agni and vaayu) with devotee's dilemma
in choosing the correct one from the five ways. The veda-s is
satyataram (superlatively true) of the 5 religious thoughts which
proclaim satyam.

Acharya goes on to say that other four may be considered as preparatory
and helpful in understanding the vedic truth.

The original mahAbhArata verse emphasizes that all thes five thoughts
should be preserved.
