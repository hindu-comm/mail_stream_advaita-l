The reference to pancharatras in Shatapathabrahmana is real alright.  I
think it is in the description of the purushamedha where  it it is said to
take "5 nights" to perform.  The archetype for this is the srshti as
described in the purushasukta which this text says took 5 days.  Neither
of the two commentaries I have, Sayanacharya and Hariswami Acharya say
anything about the pancharatra school in this context.
