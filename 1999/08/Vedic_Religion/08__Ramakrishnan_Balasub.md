Where does the shatapatha brAhmaNa laud the pA.ncarAtra? If it's some
text which the Madhvas think belong to the shatahapatha brAhmaNa, it's
not of much use for us. The rest are subordinate to shruti and it's
not necessary to take their meaning literally, especially when it
contradicts with shruti.

The shathapathabrAhmaNa has a recitation tradition doesn't it? It can
be easily determined what the meaning of that passage is in that case.
