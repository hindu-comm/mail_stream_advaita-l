That by itself is no objection, though, is it?  After all we have
Narada in the Chandogya saying `R^igvedaM bhagavo.adhyemi yajurvedaM
sAmavedamAtharvaNam.h', etc., or that he has already studied all the
four Vedas, and yet seeks Sanatkumara's advice!

I'm also not aware of any explanation for why the Mahabharata, the
Bhagavata and other Puranas, and the shathapatha-brAhmaNa laud the
Pancharatra, if the latter is so objectionable.

However, they don't study the Pancharatra either, so the less said
about them the better.
