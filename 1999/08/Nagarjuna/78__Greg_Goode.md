Yes, the bhAshhya does give this formulation.  Thanks.  It is likely that
Gaudapada read Nagarjuna, since some of the arguments, esp. in Chapter 4,
are similar, and the twirling firebrand image was used by both.  (Likely
also that this image was current in Indian philosophy of the time).

Is there a scriptural reference for that outlook?  There are several
definitions:

1. A non-dualist philosophy doesn't entail dualism.
2. A non-dualist philosophy entails unity.

3. A dualist philosophy entails dualism.
4. A dualist philosophy doesn't entail unity.

I was interpreting dualism and non-dualism according to (1) and
(3).  Especially for the definition of non-dualism, the emphasis seems to
be on not-two. It seems that you are interpreting Shankara as operating
according to (2) and (4).  I read Nagarjuna as not asserting unity or
dualism, and Shankara as asserting unity.  Interesting.  Thanks!
