Yes there are a lot of stock images and motifs used by all the various
philosophical schools such as "the space in a pot", "the city of the
Gandharvas" etc.  Somebody has collected a lot of these together but I
don't remember the name of the book.

Your (1) is correct but the key thing to remember is that Shankaracharya
isn't just putting forth a non-dualist philosophy but a non-dualist
*vedanta*.  Thus (2) becomes more accurate in his case.  Although the
technique of negation is employed (to great effect) in Advaita Vedanta,
this school insists that after as much is negated as possible *something*
remains, a fundamental reality upon which the world of opposites is based.
This is revealed in many places in the shastras.

On the other matter, I would go with (3) rather than (4) because
depending on how you define non-, a non-non-dualist is not necessarily a
dualist!  (The definition and analysis of negation or Nanyavada was an
important topic in later Indian logic.)
