Here are the verses from the Ashwamedhakanda of the Gargasamhita:

Yudhishthirovikramashchatathaavaishaalivaahanah |
Vijayaabhinandanashchaivatathanaagaarjunonrpah || 20 ||
Tathakalkishchabhagavaanaetevaishakabandhinah |
Karishyantikalaubhoopaadharmasthapanamevacha || 21 ||

Yudhishthira, Vikrama, Shalivahana, Vijayabhindana, King Nagarjuna, and
Kalki Bhagawan, these six lords of the earth will establish Dharma in the
Kaliyuga.

The first three are well known as is the last but who are Viyayabhindana
and Nagarjuna?  Are there any other positive references to a Nagarjuna
enywhere else in the shastras?
