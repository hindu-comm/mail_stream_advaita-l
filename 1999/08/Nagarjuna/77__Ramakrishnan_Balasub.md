The

I should have said _some_ schools of Buddhism deny both. Some actually
affirm the difference between different objects. But Nagarjuna
obviously denies difference.

All the books (published by Tamil Nadu folks) I have seen on the
pa.ncAyatana pUja invoke not just shiva during the AvAhanam, but
somAskandaparameshvara (the Supreme Lord with umA and skanda). So
shhaNmukha is generally worshiped by Tamil Nadu folks in the
pa.ncAyatana pUjA anyway, but I guess some people also include the
vEl. That's quite interesting, I have not come across this practice
myself.
