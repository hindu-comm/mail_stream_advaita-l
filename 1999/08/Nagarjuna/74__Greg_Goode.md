A while ago, someone posted some links about dualism and qualified
non-dualism.  I have a question about Nagarjuna that these URLs might be
able to answer.

Advaita-vedantins consider him a dualist, do they not?  But in Tibetan
Buddhism and other Mahayana schools, he's considered the father of non-dual
philosophy because of his Mulamadhyamakakarika (Treatise on the Middle
Way).  Can someone offer pointers about why Advaitins see him as a
dualist?  Thanks!
