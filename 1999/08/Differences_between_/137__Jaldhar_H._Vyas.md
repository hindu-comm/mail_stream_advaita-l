It is for the reason mentioned above that Shankaracharya insists that only
the Sannyasi can achieve moksha.  (I know there has been controversy on
this subject in the past but there is no doubt about this.) To allow the
effects of karma to "wind down" in this way, one must completely cease any
religious or secular karma.

For vishistadvaitains sannyasa is of the Tridandi type and they continue
to perform karmas even in sannyasashram.  This is why they keep shikha,
yagnopavit etc.  (The external signs of a karmadhikari) even at this
stage.  Advaitins are Ekadandins and give up the shikha, yagnopavit etc.
to signify that karma is incompatible with jnana.  Shrisha, please
explain: As the Dvaitins are also ekadandins, do they follow this and if
not, why not?
