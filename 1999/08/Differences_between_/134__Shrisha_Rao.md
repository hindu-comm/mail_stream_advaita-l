I don't believe that is accurate, because, for instance, the mANDUka's
`mAyAmAtram.h' would have to mean "[the world is] by ignorance (in the
plain sense) only." The actual explanation given is something like `mAyeti
bhagavatpraj~nA saiva mAna-trANa-kartrI yasya tan.h mAyAmAtram.h', the
operative part being, of course, `mAyeti bhagavat.h praj~nA' -- mAyA is
the Consciousness/Will of the Supreme Being.
