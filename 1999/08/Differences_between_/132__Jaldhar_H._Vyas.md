Ok here goes.  (corrections gratefully accepted.)

Advaita

Brahman = the ultimate reality
Maya = false knowledge
Ishwar = Brahman superimposed by  maya
Jiva = Brahman superimposed by maya
World = maya
Moksha = When the jiva realizes its non-difference with Brahman

Vishishtadvaita

Brahman = Ishwar = Vishnu Bhagawan = ultimate reality
Maya = False knowledge
Jiva = Real but dependent on Bhagawan. Prior to release superimposed by Maya
World = Real but dependent on Bhagawan
Moksha = When the Jiva transcends maya (it retains its individuality.)

Dvaita

Brahman = Ishwar = Vishnu Bhagawan = ultimate reality
Maya = ignorance in the plain sense of the word with no transcendental
       significance.
Jiva = real but dependant on Bhagawan
World = real but dependant on Bhagawan
Moksha = When the jiva dwells with Bhagawan in Vaikuntha.
