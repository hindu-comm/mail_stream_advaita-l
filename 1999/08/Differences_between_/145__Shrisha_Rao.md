Never made such an inference.  However, my main point still is that if
you want to talk about the Advaitic view of karma, or anything else
for that matter, it is absolutely necessary to look at the primary
sources in detail.  You have quoted some fables re Vachaspati,
Appayya, etc., as well as given some translations of Gita verses, but
I regret to say that in my mind this does not approach the threshold
of serious Advaita.

Not in particular, no, although I do feel that the recent discussion
about the Vedas' lack of authoredness would have benefited greatly if
someone had taken the trouble to look at the first six or so pages (in
the Max Mueller edition) of Sayana's comm. on the Rg Veda, and the
shaN^kara-bhAshhya and subcommentaries on `ata eva cha nityatvam.h'.
The gentleman may not have been convinced, but he would certainly have
thought Advaita a lot less dogmatic on this critical issue.

Subject: doubt regarding the kosas and sariras

how do we know that there 3 sariras and 5 kosas'?if indeed there are
sariras and kosas' can it not be argued that linga sarira,karana sarira
are the conscious and eternal entity spoken by the scriptures?--
