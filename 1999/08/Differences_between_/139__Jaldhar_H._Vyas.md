This is clearly wrong. Nityakarmas are enjoined for life.  On the basis of
Shrutivakyas such as "aharaharasandhyamupaset" (Shatapatha Brahmana) our
sages have determined nityakarma cannot be given up.  Vishishtadvaitins
acknowledge this and their sannyasis continue with nityakarma.
Advaitins, as was mentioned, believe this only applies to people who think
"I am the doer."  which (ideally) sannyasis are not.  You can make a case
for either of these views from the shastras but not the one you mention
above.
