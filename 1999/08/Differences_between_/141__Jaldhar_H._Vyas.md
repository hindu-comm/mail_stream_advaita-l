Non-dwijas are required to do various acts according to different
dharmashastras but that's beside the point.  For those who are qualified,
the requirement to wear yagnopavit, do Sandhyavandan etc. is binding.  To
give them up there better be a good reason.  To say the sannyasi follows a
different path you will have to explain what about him is so different.
