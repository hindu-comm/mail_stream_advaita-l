But what is the difference between avidya and maya?  As far as Advaita
Vedanta is concerned they amount to the same thing--the non-apprehension
of the true nature of reality.  Maya is specifically called the
superimposition of a false cognition onto a true one as in the case of the
rope mistaken as a snake.  Avidya of the jiva can be defined this way as
the superimposition of difference on that which is truly non-different.
