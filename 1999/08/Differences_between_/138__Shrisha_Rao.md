I'm not sure I follow the question, but yes, sannyAsI-s in the Maadhva
tradition also do not wear the yaj~nopavIta, perform sandhyA, etc.,
but the significance in that case is obviously not stated to be the
incompatibility of karma and j~nAna, but merely that the duties of
those in the final Ashrama are different from those of the first three.
