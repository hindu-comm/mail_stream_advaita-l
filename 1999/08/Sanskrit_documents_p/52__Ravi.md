Subject: Sanskrit documents page update

namaste,
       The following post is regarding the update of the upaniShads page
on the Sanskrit documents page. I request you to kindly post it on the
Advaita List for the benefit of the members.

Thank you,
Raghavendra.

        The upaniShad page of the Sanskrit document site has been
updated to include more
upaniShads. In addition to the principal upaniShads, other upaniShads
like the
atharvashira and kaula have been added to the web site. The newly added
upaniShads are marked with a 'nava' superscript in devanaagarii.
Interested
readers are welcome to utilize the same at :
http://sanskrit.gde.to/doc_upanishhat/doc_upanishhat.html
and its mirror sites.
Contributions in the form of additional encodings and proof-reads are
welcome.

Thank you.
