 I agree. Appayya dIkshita is considered one of the luminaries of
 the advaita system. While quoting stories of appaya's debates with
 others, the _least_ one can do to honor him is to _thoroughly_ check
 the authenticity of the accounts. Just one-sided accounts can hardly
 be called impartial and accurate. One must neither give in nor encourage
 rabid fanaticism and sectarian frenzy.
