1. Is there a vedic basis for hierarchy of devata-s as proposed by
dvaitin-s and other vaiShNava schools of thought? Is not vedic religion
comes under something like henotheism (I think vidya used this or a
word something like this sometime in the past)?

2. What is the basis for the concept of nityakaiMkaryam of
shrIvaiShNava-s? Residing in vaikunta as servants of Lord viShNu looks
similar to residing with Father in heaven of Christianity. Can an
influence of Christianity be seen in this school of vaiShNava religion?
Does this idea  (servants of ...) have any vedic basis?
