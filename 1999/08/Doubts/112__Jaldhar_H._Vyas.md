I have a copy of the Nirukta and I do remember that passage vaguely but
unfortunately the edition I have doesn't have an index and I haven't found
it yet.  When I do I'll take another look to see if I've misunderstood
something but I don't *think* I have.


Professor Sharma quotes this to support his theory that there is no one
coherant meaning to the Gita (and by implication I suppose to other
shastras) but I think this is overstating the case a little.  Just because
there were different approaches, doesn't mean they are exclusive.  I think
Yaskacharya is a good example of this.  Although his approach to
ascertaining the meaning of words is primarily etymological, he does use
grammar, ritual and myth as well.  For instance he tells the story of
Indra and Tvashtra.  He quotes sages like Audumbarayana and Gargya who
were pre-Paninian authorities on Vyakarana etc.  I think he believed as do
all astika thinkers that came after him, that the shastras do teach a
coherent message.  (Even though we may not be 100% sure what it is :-)

That's the kathenotheism Max Muller was talking about in action.

Thank you, Sir, for the prompt response.
What I am looking for is the following:

 Before evaluating the three schools, can we first list out their
basic differences ,  in regard to terms like Brahman, Jiiva, Maya,
Ishvara, Vishnu, Creator, Moksha, Absolute Truth, etc and the
inter-relationships between these.
