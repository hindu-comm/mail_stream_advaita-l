Nirukta is the Vedanga which deals with the meaning of words in the Vedas
which it approaches from the viewpoint of etymology, myth, grammar erc..
The only extant Niruktashastra we have is that of Yaskacharya but there
may have been others.  It takes the form of a commentary on a list of
Vedic words called the Nighantu.

Kind of but not really.  What it says is for instance you are sacrificing
to Indra in place A and I'm doing the same thing at place B how is it that
Indra is able to be in both places at once?  The answer is that both your
Indra and mine are aspects of the same being.  But maybe it was such ideas
that developed into the beginning of Advaita Vedanta.
