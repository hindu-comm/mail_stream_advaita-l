AFAIK, "henotheism" is a word that was coined by the Late Maxmuller. He had in fact coined a
previous term "Katheinotheism" to refer to the concept of God in the vedas. Katheinotheism means
"one by one"-theism, i.e. those who have seasonal monotheism. Like worship Deity A on Mondays,
Deity B on Tuesdays etc. Maybe upon closer inspection, he refined his phraseology to coin
"henotheism" which means "One but in many forms" or something like that.

I don't know how accurate MaxMuller's theories are.
