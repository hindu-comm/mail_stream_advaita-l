Whoa hold on a minute.  While he may not have approved of their doctrines,
there is no reason to believe Shri Dikshita showed such animosity to
the people themselves.

I think it is significant that a latter day biographer thought to write
this even if it isn't completely historically accurate.

I have read N. Rameshans book and I'm inclined to trust it but a famous
scholar like Appaya Dikshita must have taken part in many debates.  Surely
opponents did not always come to him.  And he was a royal minister was he
not?  That must have involved travelling too.
