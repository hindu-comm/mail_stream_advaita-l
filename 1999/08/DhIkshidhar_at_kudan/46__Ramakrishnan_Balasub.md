Sorry for sounding rude, but frankly, this seems like a cooked up
story to me. Appayya displays deep animosity towards the dvaita
doctrines at various places and has even written a text called
madhvatantramukhamardanam.  All these hagiographic tales are not of
any use. Dr. B.N.K Sharma who has written a very comprehensive and
well researched account of dvaita and it's literature says "There is
no authentic biography of Vijayindra, such as we have for Vyasatirtha.
There are a few sketches of his life in the form of Sanskrit stotras
by later day devotees. But they are of negligible historical value"
(page 396 History of Dvaita Vedanta and its literature).

The above is enough to convince me that this whole thing is a fairy
tale. Vijayindra who was a disciple of Vyasatirtha himself advising
someone to continue advaitic mode of worship? I don't think so. But
whoever cooked up this story must have had a good sense of humour, no
doubt :-). And certainly a good competition for Grimm.

Perhaps, but that view certainly cannot be disputed using the above
fairy tale. And I don't see why we should give credence to some
arbitrary story floating around, when a dvaita writer like B.N.K.
Sharma himself does not.
