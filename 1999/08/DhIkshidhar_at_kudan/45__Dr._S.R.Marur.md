The biography of HH SrI VijayIndhra ThIrtha, parama guru of HH SrI
RaghavEndra Swamy, describes, in great detail, the debates Sri
Appaya dhIkshidhar had with HH at KumbakOnam. HH is said to have
won over DhIkshidhar in all of them. (HH is known as Ajaya
VijayIndhrar). Impressed with His personality, DhIkshidhar chose to
stay at KumbakOnam for some time, resulting in deep friendship
between the two.

When DhIkshidhar was in death bed, HH had visited him at his
residence at KumbakOnam and is said to have advised him to
continue the advaitic mode of worship & enquiry.

The view that DhIkshidhar did not travel beyond Adayapalam
may not be correct.
