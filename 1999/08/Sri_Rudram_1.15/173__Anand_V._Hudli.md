|| AUM namo bhagavate rudrAya ||

  The Rishi of this mantra as well as the devatA is BhagavAn rudra (Shiva),
  and the meter anuShTubh.

  pari te dhanvano hetirasmAnvR^iNaktu vishvataH |
  atho ya ishhudhistavAre asmannidhehi tam.h ||
                      (Shri Rudram: anuvAka 1; Rik 15)

 te - Your
 dhanvano - bow's
 hetiH - arrow
 asmAn.h - us
 pari-vR^iNaktu - may it spare us
 vishvataH - everywhere
 atho - also
 yaH - that
 ishhudhiH - quiver
 tava - Your
 asmad.h Are - far from us
 nidhehi - keep
 tam - that (quiver)


  (O Rudra!) May the arrow from Your bow spare us everywhere and not
  torment us. (Please) keep (Your) quiver far away from us.

  sAyaNAchAryabhAShyam.h   (Commentary of sAyaNAchArya)

    he rudra te tvadIyasya dhanvano hetirbANashalyarUpA .asmAn.h
    vishvataH sarvataH parivR^iNaktu varjitAnkarotu | asmAn.h mA
    bAdhatAmityarthaH | atho api cha yastaveshhudhistamasmadAre
    asmatto dUre nidhehi sthApaya |

   O Rudra! May the arrow of Your bow spare us everywhere. This means
   "may it not torment us!" Further, place that quiver of Yours far away
   from us.

   || iti yajuH saMhitAyAM chaturthakANDe pa.nchamaprapAThake
      shrIrudra-adhyAye prathamo .anuvAkaH ||

    Thus ends the first anuvAka of the fourth kANDa, fifth prapAThaka
    of the shrI-rudra-adhyAya of the (krishna) yajur veda.

   The following is customarily recited at the end of the first
   anuvAka, although it does not form part of the rudra-adhyAya.

   namaste astu bhagavan.h vishveshvarAya mahAdevAya trayaMbakAya
   tripurAntakAya trikAgnikAlAya kAlAgnirudrAya nIlakaNThAya
   mR^ityuJNjayAya sarveshvarAya sadAshivAya shrImanmAhAdevAya ||


   May (our) salutations be to You, O Bhagavan, who are Vishveshvara
   (the lord of the universe), mahAdeva (the great God), trayaMbaka
   (the three-eyed One), tripurAntaka (the destroyer of the three cities),
   trikAgnikAla (the time of the agnihotra when the three fires
   gArhapatya, daxiNAgni, and AhavanIya, are used), kAlAgnirudra (the
   Rudra who consumes everything as the fire of kAlAgni at the time
   of destruction), nIlakaNTha (the blue-throated One),
   mR^ityuJNjaya (the conqueror of Death), sarveshvara (the Lord of
   all), sadAshiva (the ever-auspicious One), and shrImanmahAdeva
   (the celebrated and great God).


     || AUM namo bhagavate rudrAya ||
