Hi.

Yes, I do read and remember what you said, but I just wanted to confirm
then, that Radhakrishnan and Moore are wrong in their statement:

"Some later Mimamsakas admit the reality of God. Others, however, argue
extensively against the existence and necessity of God, as for example,
                        ^^^^^^^^^
does Kumarila Bhatta in the SlokavArtika".

I was also considering another possibility that you were mistaken in your
quote. So I just wanted to know if you knew exactly what conception of God
he accepts.

The selections are supposed to be from SlokavArtika, Section 16:
"sambandhAkshepa-parihAra".

Hope this discussion is relevant to the list.

Regards,
Ganesh.
