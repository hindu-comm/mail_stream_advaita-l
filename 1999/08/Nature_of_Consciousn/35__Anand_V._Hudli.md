 You are right. The apUrva is almost the same as adR^ishhTa. It appears
 that adR^ishhTa is used for just about _any_ effect that cannot be
 seen. For example, in the injunction "vrIhIn.h proxati", "one should
 sprinkle water over the rice", the effect on such sprinkling on rice
 is not visible and so is called adR^ishhTa. But apUrva is specifically
 used to indicate the unseen result or fruit of an action. So in this
 sense adR^ishhTa is a broader term than apUrva, the apUrva being
 independent of any material or object  in the sacrifice. In other words,
 every apUrva is an adR^ishhTa but not every adR^ishhTa is an apUrva.
