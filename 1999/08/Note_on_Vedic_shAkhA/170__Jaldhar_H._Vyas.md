I bow to the superior knowledge of the Pandits of Kanchi.  No doubt they
have gone into this much more thoroughly than I have, but it seems to me
there is an obligation to study the Vedas.  (Svadhyayam na pramaditavyam
as T.U. says)  Perhaps the person in this unfortunate position should just
learn the Gayatri, purusha sukta etc. which occur in all shakhas?  This
still leaves the question of learning the correct pronounciation.

If you get a chance to ask them again in more detail, I'd be interested to
know the answer.
