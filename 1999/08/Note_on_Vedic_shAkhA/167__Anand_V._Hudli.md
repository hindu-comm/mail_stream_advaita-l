  Also, the story goes on to say that YAjnavalkya was taught the
  shukla-yajur veda by sUrya, the Sun-God.

  Apart from the story about VaishampAyana and YAjnavalkya, the reason
  why Krishna and Shukla Yajur vedas are called what they are called,
  lies in the organization of the saMhitA and brAhmaNa portions. In the
  Krishna Yajur veda, the saMhitA and brAhmaNa mantras occur mixed
  together. While in the shukla yajur veda, the saMhitA and brAhmaNa
  portions are not so mixed. Also, there is a marked difference in the
  recitation style of the upanishhads. In the shukla yajur vedic
  bR^ihadAraNyaka upanishhad, for example, there are only two svaras
  (accents), not the usual three. The taittirIya upanishhad of the
  krishna yajur veda has all the three svaras.
