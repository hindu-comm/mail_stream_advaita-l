I'll tell you something interesting about this.  My kai. Grandfather went
to Kashi on a yatra.  Prior to that, the last time anyone in our family
that we knew of had gone there was in the 19th century.  Yet the Pande's
or priests there were able to find the records of that trip.  So if you
know ancestors of yours have made such a yatra (or to Gaya or Prayag or
some other major tirth especially if it is a place where Shraddhas ae
performed) you may be able to find out stuff.

Pandit Harikrishna Venkataram Joshi wrote a book called
Brahmanottpattimartanda which contains information about the various
Brahmana castes and their gotras and Shakhas.  Because he was a Gujarati
living in Aurangabad Maharashtra, the main focus is on those areas and
details get sketchier about people in more distant areas but if you give
me some details I'll look them up and send you a photocopy of any
findings.

We discussed this on the list once before.  Because it is the duty of
every Brahmana to learn the Vedas, you should learn what you can, even if
it is the "wrong" shakha but it is preferable to learn your own and you
should make the best possible effort to do so.

The Shalivahana shaka is a calender.  (It's year 1921 right now.)

I don't think so.  Although the different Vedas do occur in "clumps" any
particular area should have some of each as reciters of all four Vedas are
needed to perform the Shrauta yagnas.

According to our shastras, the Rshis saw all these different mantras.  At
the dawn of the Kaliyuga when people started getting progressively
stupider, Maharshi Krshna Dvaipayana gathered them altogether.  (For this
reason he is better known as Veda Vyas--the arranger of the Vedas)  He
taught the Rgveda, to Shaunaka, the Yajurveda to Vaishampayana, the
Samaveda to Jaimini, and the Atharvaveda to Sumantu.  Their pupils are the
founders of the shakhas.  Mostly the differences are very minor, a
slightly different arrangement of the mantras or a different
pronounciation etc.  The only really big difference is between the Shukla
and Krshna Yajurveda.  The story is the famous Yagnavalkya was the student
of Vaishampayana.  Once he had a big argument with his teacher and left
vomitting up all he had learnt.  Then he did tapa and from Surya Bhagawan
was given the Shuklayajurveda.
