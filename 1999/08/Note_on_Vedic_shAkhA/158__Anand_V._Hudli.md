  Yes, the Purusha sUkta occurs in more than one Veda. I know for
  a fact that it occurs in the Rg, Yajur, and sAma vedas, but it
  may also occur in the atharva veda. Yes, there is a specific
  way to recite it according to one Veda. The Rg vedic Purusha sUkta
  has different accents than the Yajur vedic purusha sUkta. The
  sAma vedic purusha sUkta sounds like singing. Apart from the
  recitation differences, there are textual differences as well
  between the Rg vedic and yajur vedic purusha sUkta. It follows that
  not all shAkhAs recite it the same way.
