Namaste All,

I have read in one of David Frawley's books that Yajnavalkya vommitted the
Yajurveda and it came out black in colour, a colour  resembling the Tittri
(spelling???) bird, and hence was called the Taittiriya (not sure which book
of the Vedas). Since it was black, it was called Krishna Yajurveda.

Can someone please post the incident between Vaishampayan and Yajnavalkya.

Maharshi Krshna Dvaipayana = Bhagawan Veda Vyas = Badarayana ???

Why is Maharshi Krshna Dvaipayana also called Badarayana ?

Namaste
ashish
