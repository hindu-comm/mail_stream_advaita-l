Are there any other efforts in this direction like this project? Please
let us know. I have not seen this CD-ROM, have any one you seen this
CD-ROM?

Few months back I saw that bhakti list was engaged in a project of
creating a CD-ROM for Ramanuja, I wished someone will do a similar
thing for shankara.

This CD costs around 20 USD.
