Strictly speaking, only two or three members of the list are "practising"
Vedanta as according to Shankaracharya this requires sannyasa--complete
physical and mental tyaga.  For the rest of us, the path is to perform all
actions, whether worldly or religious as a dedication to Bhagawan without
desire for the results.  This is what is called karmayoga in the Gita.  In
that sense too, Vedanta is "impractical" we should expect nothing from it.
That's why those people who interpret karmayoga as "social consciousnes"
or some such are missing the mark IMO.  It is good and noble to help
people but "progress" and other such ideals just entangle you further in
samsara rather than seperating you which should be the goal.  And that
ultimately causes more pain and suffering to other people.
