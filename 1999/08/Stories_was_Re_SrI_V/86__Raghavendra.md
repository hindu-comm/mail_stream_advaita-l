According to one of the books published by the Sringeri Matha,
Madhvacharya was defeated by Vidyashankara Tiirtha or one of his
predecessors. What can we say about that ? One or both of the stories
are false.
There are lots of other stories floating around, mostly propagated by
the devoted followers of each path. All of them need not be true. They,
according to me, serve only to strengthen the convictions of their
followers and illustrate the esteem each scholar had about the other.
There is no point arguing about something which is not verifiable.
Raghavendra.
