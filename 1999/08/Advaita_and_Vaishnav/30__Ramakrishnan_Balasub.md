Agama-s, both shaivite and vaishhNavite are partially acceptable.
However, advaitins prefer the shrauta rituals compared to tha Agama-s,
although they may not really object to the latter. In fact H.H shrI
saccidAnanda shivAbhinava bhAratI Mahaswami (guru of chandrashekhara
bhAratI mahAswami) , who was an AchArya of the Sringeri Peetham,
started a movement to buidl temples along the shrauta lines rather
than the Agama lines. This is because the Agama-s themselves are only
partially reliable, better to stick to shrauta rituals.

There are no non-advaitic, shaivite sects which also *claim* to be
based on the veda-s in existence now. The only susch school was the
shaivite Srikantha's and appayya dIxita's efforts subsumed the school
of Srikantha into advaita.

My mother's family wears tankalai style marks once a week and ashes
the rest of the days. When I went to Sringeri last time there was one
disciple who was wearing a vaishhnavite mark. All such things are
matters of family tradition and not anything do  with superiority or
inferiority of vishhNu. The Sringeri Acharys, although they wear ashes
themselves, advise people to follow family traditions, bhasma or
vaishhNava marks.

The vArttikakAra sureshvarAchArya has said in his
purushhavidhabrAhmaNa vArtika 377:

yaH prR^ithivAmitIsho.asAvantaryAmI jagadguruH |

The Lord of this earth, the one existing inside all that and the world
teacher, *is though one*,  sung variously as Hari , Brahma, Pinaki,
etc (a name for shiva commonly found in the mahAbhArata).
