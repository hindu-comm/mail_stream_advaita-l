Ganesh Deivashikamani,

Ramakrishnan Balasubramanian wrote an article on panchAyatana pUja
sometime back. Please refer to that article.

Regarding your question about smArta-s, they are so called because they
follow smr^iti-s. Even before the advent of shrI shankara, smArta-s
were there, as smR^iti-s are ancient. We can say that shrI shankara was
also a smArta. But he being an amsham Lord shiva, such classification
may not truly apply to him.

On this point, it was those who were smArta-s later embraced
shrIvaishNavam after the advent of rAmunjAcharya. In that sense they
were also smArta-s.

It is said that shruti and smR^iti are two eyes of a person. The word
nayana comes from the root naya which means "to lead". The purpose of
physical eyes is to lead a person while walking, etc. Since shruti and
smriti-s lead every one to mokSha, they are compared to eyes. It is
said that a brahmana who does not know these are blind even if he has
physical eyes (I read this verse in Sai sat charitra). I think this
should extend to every one.

In this world (at all times) only a few follow shruti and smriti
correctly. In that sense most of us are blind. That is why Lord Krishna
say only one in a thousand seeks me and among those one in a thousand
attains me. Here thousand implies a huge number.


Besides this coming back to your point on panchAyatana pUja, in Tamil
Nadu, since most people worship Lord shaNmukha with deep love, some
tamil smArta-s include vEl (shakti Ayudham of Lord skanda) along with
shiva, viShNu, ambaaL, ganesha and Aditya. There is talk on this
subject in the book Dharma which is a translation of talks of kAnchi
periyava.
