Someone had asked a question about this eclipse a while back. There is
 no total eclipse visible in the eastern part of US and Canada but a
 partial eclipse. Other parts of the US and Canada will not even have a
 partial eclipse. To find out the starting, maximum eclipse, and ending
 times, and what the eclipse looks like, please visit:
