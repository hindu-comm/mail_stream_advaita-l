Dear list members,

I am under the impression that although SankarAcArya talks of the subtle
body (sUkshma SarIra or linga SarIra) numerous times in his bhAshyas, he
does not talk of its composition definitively in these texts, the only
exception being the commentary on mANDUkya upanishad and kArikAs. A list of
the parts that constitute the subtle body is to be found in other
independent texts like the Atmabodha, AtmAnAtmaviveka, pancIkaraNa etc. I
would really appreciate it if those of you who have ready access to the
commentaries on the brahmasUtras and the major upanishads can check this
and share the information.

Regards,
Vidyasankar
