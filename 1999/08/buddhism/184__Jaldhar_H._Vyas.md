The Buddha avatar was taken to trick the daityas into giving up dharma by
teaching them false doctrines.  Not very complimentary.


All the great acharyas, Kumarila Bhatta in Purvamimamsa, Udayanacharya in
Nyaya, and Shankaracharya in Vedanta, have considered Buddhism to be the
worst of heresies.  Even someone like Jayanta Bhatta the Kashmiri Nyayaika
who was personal friends with Buddhist philosophers doesn't agree with
their philosophies.  Why?  Because they denied the eternal nature of
Brahman, the eternal nature of the jiva, and the validity of the Vedas.
