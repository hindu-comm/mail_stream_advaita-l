When I started reading the chapter on Sankara SampradhAyam [1],
to make a summary, I found that a lot of details of His discourse
would be lost in this exercise. It appeared that the best way
to present His thoughts would be to translate the entire chapter.
Ofcourse, the loss due to my translation is unavoidable.

I'll attempt to post a couple of pages of translation every
alternate day. At this rate, I hope, this would go for a
couple of weeks.

The copy right of this original book is with the publisher -
Mr. Thirunavukkarasu. Hope, he wouldn't mind this free-lance
translation, purely for the sake of members of advaita list.

In the running text, wherever my notes are inserted they are
enclosed by square braces.

Regards,

Sudhakar
