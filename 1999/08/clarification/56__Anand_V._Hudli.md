 This means "those other than cattle and horses are not animals."
 Or it could also mean (bahuvR^IhI) that "those other than who have
 cattle and horses, have no animals." I am unaware of the details of
 the context. It may be that nIlakaNTha dIkshita is arguing in the
 same sense as:
 "there is no alternative other than surrendering to God"
 (anyathA sharaNaM nAsti; tvameva sharaNaM mama; raxa raxa janArdana)
 "there is no other refuge; You alone are my refuge; protect me O
 janArdana!"

 Anand
