Just to be sure I checked this in the Laghusiddhantakaumudi.  The word go
is a special case as per the sutra sarvatra vibhasha goh (6. 1. 122)  In
the place of an at or eng there is optionally avagraha or it is as is.
E.g. go'shva or go ashva.  for other cases of ach there is guna.  E.g. go
+ indra = gavendra.  For hal it is as is.  go + loka = goloka.

Ok how about "To a man with a hammer, everything looks like a nail."?

The idea I think is because Nilakantha Dikshita is a fan of sharanagati,
he thinks it is the answer to everything.  In fact it is one of several
ways appropriate for some people but not necessarily everyone.

However this is not the same as the "anything goes" theory of the moderns!
Any path that purports to lead to Moksha must meet certain standards.  But
within the parameters set by the shastras, there is room for different
approaches and the task of a Guru is to determine which is the right one
for a particular shishya.
