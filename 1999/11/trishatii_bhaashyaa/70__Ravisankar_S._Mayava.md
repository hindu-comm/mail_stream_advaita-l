bhagaavan shrii shankara after the ma~NgaLaacharaNam (benedictory
verses), begins his commentary only after the puurva bhaagam of
trishatii is complete. He briefly summarizes the details of the
puurva here.

bahu kaalaM subhakti mahimnaa guru paadaambujaM avalambya
sthitaaya kumba-yoni munaye shiva-dampati kR^ita naama
shata-traya yoktya prerito hayagriiva uvaacha |

shankara's prelude:
-------------------

To the pot-born sage (agastya) who woshipped with unparalled
devotion the lotus feet of his guru (hayagriivaa) and took refuge
there holding on to it steadfastly for a long time, Lord
hayagriiva impelled by a divine behest, began to instruct the
three-hundred names composed by the divine couple, kaameshwara
and lalitaambaa.
