I'm sorry for the misunderstanding. I was just going through the thread
again, and in a reply to me, you had written:

knower,
knowledge or object of knowledge." >>

I am sorry if you think the above verse has anything to do with
saguNopAsana. It's obvious from the verse that it has nothing to do
with saguNopAsana.

I was always of the opinion that verses like the one above were
were meant to show the reader how saguNopaasana was supposed to be
practised. So when you objected to this verse being quoted, it really
stumped me. I assumed you were nitpicking on the term "saguNa" and how the
verse could not refer to saguNa Brahman. I have read only very little of
Shankara's BSB and GItA B, but enough to know that ni.rguNa Brahman does
not possess shakti, only saguNa Brahman does.

I now realize you were objecting to the term "upaasana." I guess I should
have seen that at that time, but the only meaning of the word I know is
its loose translation as "prayer/worship," not the strict philosophical
definition(s). In any case, the verse looks pretty much like saguNopaasana
of the GYAna-mishra kind that Anand talked about.
