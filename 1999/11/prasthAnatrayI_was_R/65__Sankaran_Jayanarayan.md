I frankly think you're mistaken, unless you're disputing about a mere play
of words. Maybe that's where your idea that saguNa and ni.rguNa are
different stems from :-)

Vidya had posted sometime ago that the saguNa Brahman is the quality-less
Brahman being conceived of as endowed with qualities for the purpose of
meditation. Being "All-powerful" is a quality, and conceiving Brahman to
be so is definitely referring to saguNa Brahman.

Here's an excerpt from Vidya's original posting:

Re: saguNa, nirguNa brahman and Shankara

There is no point in talking about saguNa and nirguNa brahman as if they
are two different entities. It is the essentially quality-less brahman
that is conceived as being endowed with all qualities in order to explain
creation and for the sake of meditation. This is the view of the advaita
tradition since time immemorial.

And this has nothing in contradiction to what I said.
