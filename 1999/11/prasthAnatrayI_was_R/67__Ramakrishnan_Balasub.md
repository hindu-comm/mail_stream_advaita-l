I think Anand is the only person who understood what I was trying to
say. Perhaps my next post will clear the haze up a bit. Sorry for
being blunt, but this is the second occcassion when you seem to have
made absolutely no effort to read my post, but more intent on dashing
off a reply. The karma thread stands out in my mind right now.
