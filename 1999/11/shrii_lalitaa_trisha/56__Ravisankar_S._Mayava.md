shrI lalitA trishatI pUrva pIThikA

agasthya uvAcha

hayagrIva dayA sindho bhagavan.h shiShya vatsala |
tvattaH shrutaM asheSheNa shrotavyaM yadyat.h asti tat.h || 1 ||

O Lord hayagrIva, you are a Ocean of Mercy and affectionate towards
your disciples, from you I have heard what all that needs to be heard.

rahasya nAma sAhasraM api tvattaH shrutaM maya |
itaH paraM me nAsti eva shrotavyaM iti nishchayaH || 2 ||

I have even heard the secret 1000 names on shrI lalita devI from you.
Thus I am sure  that there is nothing greater than this to be heard.


tathaapi mama chittasya paryaaptirnaiva jaayate |
kaartsnyaarthaH praapya ityeva shochayishhyaamyahaM prabho  || 3 ||

Even then in my mind there is no sense of fullness or
completion. Intuitively I feel I am lacking something. O
Lord, I am grieving to know what will get me the sense of
fullness.

Prior to this, shrI hayagrIva initiated sage agastya to shrI
lalitAsahasranAmam. Before he was taught lalitAsahasranAmam,
sage agastya was aware of the existence of a work called
lalitAsahasranAmam. But now, at this point, he does not know
that a work called shrI lalitAtrishatI exists. But he
intuitively feels that he is missing something very
important.


kimidaM kaaraNaM bruuhi GYaatavyaaMsho.asti  vaa punaH |
asti chenmama tat.h bruuhi bruuhiityuktvaa praNamya taM ||4||

Please tell me the reason for this, is there something some which I
have not heard from you. If it is so please instruct me
further. Saying thus sage agastya prostrated to lord hayagrIva.

suuta uvaacha :

samaalalaMbe tatpaada yugaLaM kalashodbhavaH |
hayaanano bhiitabhiitaH kimidaM kimidaM tviti || 5 ||

Sage suuta spoke, Saying thus agastya mahaR^iShi (kalashodbaha also
known as kumbhasaMbhava) held the feet of Lord hayagrIva. Taken aback,
Lord hayagrIva told what is this, what is this, let me go.

mu.nchamu.ncheti taMchoktvaa chintaakraanto babhuuva saH |
chiraM vichaarya nishchinvan.h  vaktavyaM na mayetya sau || 6 ||

Contemplating deeply on this matter for sometime, Lord hayagrIva came to the
conclusion that he has nothing more to instruct.

tuushhNiiM sthitaH smarannaaGYaaM lalitaaMbaa kR^itaaM puraa |
taM praNamyaiva samuniH tatpaadaavatyajan.h sthitaH || 7 ||

Remembering the command of shrI lalitAmbikaa (that he should keep
trishatI secret) Lord hayagrIva remained silent. But sage agastya did
not let him go and was holding his feet with his head bowing on it

varshha trayaavadhi tathaa gurushishhyau tathaa sthitau|
tachhR^i.nvan.h tashcha pashya.nta sarva lokaaH suvismitaaH || 8 ||

Three full years passed in this way and sage agastya (shishya) held
himself steadfastly at the feet of his guru, Lor hayagrIva, both fixed
in that state without moving. Hearing this and looking at this, all
worlds (the beings therein) were struck with wonder.

tatra shrii lalitaa devii kaameshvara sama.nvitaa |
praadurbhuutaa rahasyevaM hayagriivamavochata || 9 ||

After this, shrI lalita devii along with HER consort shrI kAmeshwara
appeared to Lord hayagrIva and commanded in secret to him.

shrii devii uvaacha :

aashvaananaa vayoH priitiH shaastra vishvaasine tvayaa |
raajyaM deyaM shiro deyaM na deyaa shoDashaakSharii || 10 ||

shrii devii spoke:

O horse faced one (Lord hayagriiva), we are pleased by your faith
and trustworthiness in the scripture (by keeping it
confidential). One can easily give away the kingdom, even one's
head, but shoDashaakSharii should not be given away (that
easily).

svamAtR^i jaaravat.h gopyaa vidyaa eshhaH iti agamaa jaguH |
tato ati gopaniyaa me sarva-puurtikarii stutiH || 11 ||

agamaa-s declare that knowlege (vidya) has protected and well guarded
like the way one protects his mother from evil and lustful persons.
If this is so for all the vidya-s, my sarva puurtikarii stuti (another
name for lalitaa trishatii) should be kept secret and guarded much
more carefully.

mayaa kaameshvareNaapi kR^itaa saa gopitaa bhR^isham.h |
madaaGYayaa vacho devyaH chakR^i naama sahasrakam.h || 12 ||

This trishatii stotram was composed by me and kAmeshwara and bestowed
to you to be guarded safely. It is by my command, vashinii and other
vaak devata-s composed the perfect thousand names on me.

aavaabhyaaM kathitaM mukhyaM  sarva puurtikaraM stavaM |
sarva kriyaaNaaM vaikalya puurtiryaH japato bhavet.h || 13 ||

Of these two composed by us, the most important is the sarva
puurtikaram stavam (trishatii), chanting this will make up for the
shortcomings in all other karma-s (like nitya and naimittika) and make
them complete.

sarva puurtikaraM tasmaadidaM naama kR^itaM mayaa |
tadbruuhi tvamagastyaaya paatrameva na sa.nshayaH || 14 ||

That is why I named this trishatii as sarvapuurtikarii and you can
instruct this to agastya and I have no doubt that he is well qualified
to receive it.

patnyasya lopaamudraakhyaa maamupaaste ati bhatitaH |
aya.ncha nitaraaM bhaktaH tasmaadasya vadasva tam.h  || 15 ||

His wife lopaamudra worships me with extreme devotion and he is also my
devout bhakta, hence, you can instruct him.

amu~nchamaanastvadpaadau varshatrayamasau sthitaH |
etat.h j~naatumato bhaktyaa hitameva nidarshanam.h || 16 ||

Without moving from the place he (sage agastya) has held on to
your feet for three years, to know what he is lacking and what
is beneficial, this clearly indicates his deep devotion.

cittaparyaaptiretasya naanyathaa saMbhaviShyatii |
sarvapuurtikaraM tamaadanuj~naato mayaa vada ||

The sense of fulfillment (which sage agastya is lacking now) will
not arise by other means. Hence, on my command, bestow him the
knowledge of sarvapuurtikarii (lalita trishatii) which alone can
provide that completeness in knowing.

suuta uvaacha:

(suuta spoke)

iti yuktva antaradhadaambaa kaameshvara samanvitaa |
athotthaapya hayagriivaH paaNibhyaaM kumbhasambhavam.h || 18 ||

saMsthaapya nikaTevaaca uvaaca bhR^isha vismitaH |

After saying thus, shrii lalitaa ambaa together with HER consort
shrii kaameshwara disappeared. After this, Lord hayagriivaa
began to speak as follows with wonder.

hayagriiva uvaaca:

(Lord hayagriiva spoke)

kR^itaartho.asi kR^itaartho.asi kR^itaartho.asi ghaTodbhava || 19 ||

You are blessed and have accomplished the ultimate purpose. (by
repetition, the sense of wonder at this great accomplishment is
indicated).

tvatsamo lalitaabhakto naasti naasti jagattraye |
enaagastya svayaM devii tavavaktavyaM anvashaat.h || 20 ||

You are the best devotee of lalitaambaa and there in none (again
wonder is indicated by repetition of naasti) equal to you in this
regard, for shrI lalitaamba Herself commanded me to instruct this
sarvapuurtikarii to you.

sachchhiShyena tvaya chaahaM dR^iShTvaanasmi taaM shivaaM |
yatante yaddarshanaaya brahmaviShNviisha puurvikaa || 21 ||

I obtained the great vision of shrii shivaa because of a good
disciple like you. For this vision, even brahma, viShNu and rudra
struggle so hard.

athaH paraM te vakShyaami sarvapuurtikaraM sthavam.h |
yasya smaraNa maatreNa paryaaptiste bhavddhR^ide || 22 ||

Hence, I will now tell you the sarvapuurtikaraM sthavam.h
(trishatii), even thinking about this sthavam itself will give
the complete sense of fulfillment to one's heart.

rahasyanaama saahsraadapi guhyatamaM mune |
aavashyakaM tato.apiyetallalitaaM samupaasitum.h || 23 ||

O sage, this is a greater secret (and more important) than the
important (and secret) sahasranaamam, hence it is very essential
for worshipping shrii lalitaambaa.

tadahaM saMpravakShyaami lalitaambaa anushaasanaat.h |
shriimatpa~nchadashaakSharyaaH kaadivarNaan.h kraaman.h mune ||  24 ||

O sage, I will instruct this to you because of the command of
shrii lalitaambaa Herself. This work will describe the glory of
akSharas present in shrImadpanchadashaakSharii according to
reading of kaadi-vidyaa.

pR^ithagviMshati naamaani kathitaani ghaTodbhava |
aahastya naamnaaM trishatii sarvasMpuurti kaaraNii || 25 ||

O pot-born sage, for each of the 15 akShara-s beginning with ka,
there are 20 names describing them in this 300 names (trishatii)
which will bring fulfillment and completion to everything.

rahasyaadi rahasyaiShaa gopaniiya prayatnataH |
taaM shR^iNuShva mahaabhaaga saavadhaanena chetasa || 26 ||

This is more secret than best of secrets, hence guard this with
great care. You being a very lucky one to obtain this,
please listen  to this with attention and care.

mantraatmakaM eteShaaM naamnaaM naamatmataapi cha |
tasmaat.h ekaagramanasa shrotavya cha tvayaa sadaa || 27 ||

They are verily mantra-s even though they seem to be just names,
hence, with one pointed mind listen to this.

suuta uvaacha

(suuta spoke)

iti yukytva taM hayagriivaH proche naamashatatrayam.h || 28 ||

After saying thus, shrii hayagriiva began to instruct the 300
names to sage agastya

|| iti shrii lalitaa trishatii stotra puurva bhaagaH ||

Thus ends the prologue of shrii lalita trishatii.
