Meaning:

I worship (and meditate on) shrImAtA who holds an exceedingly
sweet sugarcane in one hand; and bows which can confer bliss and
auspiciousness in the other; who is red in color like a rising
Sun and who has an amazing form of compassion. I meditate on HER
form which shines in the chakra-s starting from the muulAdhAra to
sahsrAra with a ever new beauty.


(sometimes people add more dhyAna shloka-s and include those
which are used in the sahasranaama)
