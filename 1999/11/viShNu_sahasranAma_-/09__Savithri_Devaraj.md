5. bhUtakR^it :  The creator and destroyer of all existences in the
universe.  Assuming rajoguNa, He as brahmA, is generator of all
objects.  kR^it  can also be interpreted as kR^intana or destruction.
The name can therefore also mean one who, as Rudra destroys the worlds,
assuming the guNa of tamas.

6. bhUtabhR^it : - One who supports or sustains or governs the
universe.  Assuming the sattva guNa, He sustains the worlds.
