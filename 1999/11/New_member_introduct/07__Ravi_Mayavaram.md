Subject: My introduction

Advaita-L readers,

My name is Sabin Smith and I've just subscribed to the Advaita
list. I'm 26 and I attend the University of Rhode Island in the
United States. I'm caucasian with respect to ethnicity and I've
never been to India. I have done quite a bit of reading about
various Hindu schools. Of course, Shankara represents the
pinnacle of Hindu thought, particularly with respect to the yogic
model of Patanjali. I believe that Shankara provides the
conceptual backgroung that is essential for serious study of
Hindu-yogic methods. In these times we are constantly bombarded
with comments like "we are all right" and "everything is
relative", even when speaking with religious people and yogic
students! I think Shankara points the way toward the sublime in a
rigorous and consistent manner that is so often overlooked in the
yogic seminars of the U.S.
