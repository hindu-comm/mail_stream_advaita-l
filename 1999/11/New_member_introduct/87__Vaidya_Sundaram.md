Hello,
    My name is Michele......my interest in advaita vedanta was brought on
when I started questioning my religious preference. I've never been a member
of an organized religion, but i've felt a curiosity towards Hinduism and
other religions of the eastern hemisphere. I decided it was time to learn
about it and discuss it with others so I have a better understanding. I'm
looking for peace in my life and I hope to discover it soon. Thank you!
sincerely,
Michele Simms
