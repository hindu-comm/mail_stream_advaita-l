Namaste,

My friend was in Sringeri last month and wanted to see swamiji. He was asked
to remove his shirt and vest. He was questioning me why was that a
requirement to see swamiji. He also mentioned that all brahman temples in
south India has that requirement to enter the temple.

I was not equipped with an answer when i went into argument with him. Could
the learned members of this list help me in this.

Thanks
Arun
