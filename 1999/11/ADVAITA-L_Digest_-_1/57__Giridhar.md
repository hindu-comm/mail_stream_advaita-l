The same shankaracharya you quote above has clearly said that
there is nothing in the sastras which prevent a brahmin from eating beef or
meat. But, sannyasis are forbidden to eat meat. Over the course of time,
the brahmins adopted it. Now, the tradition has become so long that not
many brahmins eat meat.

I don't see any mention of remarriage. Do you ? I only see that she can
bear an offspring, not remarry.

There was a sati even yesterday, isn't it ?

Shankara has written a commentary to this set of sutras. I had posted on
the advaita list two years back.
