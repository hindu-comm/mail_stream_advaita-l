Namaste All,

I was researching the aspect of adhikAra in the Advaita-L archives when I
came across this post from Jaldhar. Sorry about this blast from the past!

Hey Jaldhar,

you probably know the answer but the same thing happened with me. IN our
ancestoral village in UP, I had gone for a visit when I was around 10 years
of age. A Harijan lady had come to our house and given raw grains and
pulses. I had enquired of my Taiji (Father's elder brother's wife) as to why
she had given us puslses and grains? She had told me that this was because
we would not eat food cooked in their house. To this I had asked why not and
I distinctly remember that she had said that that was the custom. No one had
any hangups about it. I don't remember anyone feeling hurt that we didn't
eat the food cooked in their houses but the idea still doesn't appeal to me.
Afterwards, when the lady had left, my Taiji had said that the grains and
pulses would either be given away or would be fed to the animals. The
practice continues to this day without ryhme or reason.

Being brought up in a city, I had criticized the practice as "all were
equal" etc. etc. The elders of the house seemed rather amused and I remember
my Tauji (father's elder brother) remarking that if anything, my views would
atleast enable me to become the Pradhaan of the village  through the local
elections!
