Subject: [ambaa-l] saundaryalaharI - 1



Prostrating before ShrI LalitA, I start my humble presentation of
saundaryalaharI.

Shivah shaktyA yukto yadi bhavati shaktah prabhavitum
na ced evam devo na khalu kushalah spanditam api
atah tvAm ArAdhyAm hari-hara-viri~ncAdibhir api
praNantum stotum vA katham akr^ta-puNyah prabhavati    1

Shivah: Shiva (sadAshivatattvamUrthy; one who is with devI the most
        auspicious)
shaktyAh: with ability (to create the jagat) - with devI
yuktah yadi: if He is united
prabhavitum: to create the jagat
shaktah: will have ability to do
evam na cet: if He is not united with devI
khalu na kushalah: will not be skilled
spanditam api: even to stir (vibrate)
atah: therefore
hari + hara + viri~nci + Adibhih api: by VishNu, Shiva, Brahmah and
                                      others also
ArAdhyAm: capable of being worshiped
tvAm: about you (who is bhagavatI)
praNamtum: to prostrate
stotum vA: to chant your praise
akr^tapuNyah: one who has not acquired puNya through earlier good deeds
katham prabhavati: how would he be able to?

O Mother, only by uniting with you, Ishwara (Shiva) is able to create
the world. If He is not united with you, He will not have the ability
even to stir. While so, how can one who has acquired no merit through
earlier good deeds, can even dare to salute or praise You, who are
worthy of being worshiped by Hari, Hara, Viri~nci and others?


Commentary on this verse would follow.
