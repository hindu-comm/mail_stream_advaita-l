When shrii shankara sang this verse, it is said that Lord
Subrahmanya gave him darshan.

O Son of Mahadeva! Seated on the peacock chariot, being the essence of
the great mahaa vaakyaas, having wonderfully attractive body, dwelling
in the heart of great sages, O the quintessence of four vedas!
Thou art indeed the Lord of the Universe.
