Reason for residing on the sea shore
====================================

yadaa sa.nnidhaanaM gataa maanavaa me
 bhavaambhodhipaaraM gataaste tadaiva |
iti vyaJNjayansindhutiire ya aaste
 tamiiDe pavitraM paraashaktiputram.h || 4||


O Lord Subrahmanya! son of spotless paraashakti [the Mother of the
Cosmos], Thou have taken the your abode near the sea shore (Thiruchendur
is a coastal town) as if it is indication that whenever the devotees
take refuge in Thee, they can easily cross the ocean of Samsara (the eternal
cycle of life and death) and reach the other side of the shore safely!
