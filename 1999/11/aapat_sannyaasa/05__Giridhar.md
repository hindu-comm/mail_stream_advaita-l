This is only partly correct. RK mission talks to the parents. If the person
wanting to take sannyasa is the only son and the parents are unwilling to
let go, they do not accept him. They try to convince the parents though.
However, if the person is not the only son and is strongly wanting to take
sannyasa, they do what you have said above, if the parents object. I have
seen many cases here and in some cases, the parents are so happy that their
son/daughter wants to take sannyas. Some parents object because they do not
want their eldest son (who is supposed to perform the last rites) to take
sannyas.
                Anyway, it is clearly understood by all that for self-realization,
sannyas is needed (not the mental sannyas one has by working for a fortune
500 company, having 2 cars and a family :-) :-). Exceptions, though
available, are rare..very rare.
