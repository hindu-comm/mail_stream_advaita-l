^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
 Do you mean each way of performing the Yajna is ten times more effective than
the *following* or the *preceding*? I ask since it seems counter-intuitive to me
- that meditaing on the ashvamedha sacrifice is some how better than actually
studying / reciting / japa / performance of the the vedas!!
Please do find time to clarify.

H.H. Chandrasekarendra Saraswati of Kanchi has been known to specifically insist
on the ashhTkA shrAdhham. It is a must for every house holder. It is a yajna for
progeny and there are several references to this even in the Ramayana; it has
been said that Lord Vishnu chose to be born as a son of King Dasharatha because
Dasharatha and all of his ancestors had always religiously observed the ashhTakA
sharAdham.

 I think it should be mentioned that this goes on even today and only a few days
go I received a notification of a soma yajna to be preformed. I think it is
important that we look out for such events and learn from the knowledgeable
people who still perform these yajnas.
