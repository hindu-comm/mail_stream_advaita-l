Hello,
This is Jagannathan. I come from Madras, India and my family is settled in
Cochin. I am doing my masters in Uny of Texas, Austin in Petroleum
Engineering..It is very nice to know that we such a thing as discussions
on the net about advaita vedantha..I have been in touch with the most
remote and greatest saints of India and have had the chance to listen and
learn from these great masters and still continue to interact with
them..It is a wonder how the great masters convey the LIMITLESS to
people..still greater wonder how a person can develop interest in knowing
oneself..

Subject: Shri Rudram 2.1, 2.2 - pashUnAM pataye namaH

|| AUM namo bhagavate rudrAya ||

   On the occasion of kAlabhAirava jayantI, I continue the
   the thread on the rudra-adhyAya. Previous posts can be
   retrieved by searching for "Rudram" in the subject line.

            Second anuvAka
            --------------

   sAyaNAchArya's introduction to the second anuvAka:

   prathamAnuvAke bhagavato rudrasya yA pradhAnabhUtA tanurishhu-
   dhanurhastA tAM bahudhA prasAdya tasya ye lIlAvigrahA jagan-
   nirvAhahetavaste .ashhTabhiranuvAkaiH prasAdyante | teshhvanuvAk-
   eshhu sarvANyapi yajUMshhi | tAnyapi dvividhAni | ubhayatonamaskA-
   rANyanyataratonamaskArANi cha | tatra trishhvanuvAkeshhu namaskArA-
   dikaM namaskArAntamekaikaM yajuH | itareshhu panchasvanuvAkeshhu
   namaskArAdikamevaikaikaM yajuH | tatra dvitIye .anuvAke trayodasha
   yajUMshhi |

   Having propitiated in many ways the main form of Rudra bearing
   (weapons such as) the bow and arrow in the first anuvAka, the (next)
   eight anuvAka's (are used by the votary to) propitiate the various
   forms that (Rudra assumes) as a sport in order to enable the running
   of the affairs of the world. In these (eight) anuvAkas, all (mantras)
   are Yajur mantras. And they are of two types. (Some are ) "ubhayato-
   namakAra" and (some are) "anyatarato-namaskAra." (Of these eight
   anuvAka's,in  the first) three anuvAka's each Yajus has a "namaskAra"
   (namaH) in the beginning and a namaskAra at the end. In the remaining
   five anuvAka's, each Yajus has a namaskAra ("namaH") at the beginning
   only. There are thirteen Yajus (mantras) in the second anuvAka.


   The Rishi of the second anuvAka is "maNDUka", the meter mahAgAyatrI
   and the deity Rudra, as per the commentary of BhaTTa bhAskara.
     prathamaM yajuH
     ---------------

    namo hiraNyabAhave senAnye dishAM cha pataye namaH |

    Salutations to (Rudra) who has arms bearing golden ornaments
    (hiraNyabAhu), who is the commander of the troops (senAnI), and
    who is the Lord of the directions (dishAM patiH).


    sAyaNAchArya-bhAshhyam.h
    ------------------------

    hiraNyanirmitAnyAbharaNAni bAhvoryasyAsau hiraNyabAhuH sa cha
    saMgrAmeshhu senAM nayatIti senAnIstAdR^ishamUrtidharo yo rudras-
    tasmai namo .astu | yashcha dishAM pAlako rudrastasmai namo .astu ||

    (Rudra is called) "HiraNyabAhu" because His hands bear ornaments
    made of gold. He leads (nayati) the (army of gaNas) (senAm.h) into
    battle, so He is called senAnI, the commander. Salutations to Rudra
    who bears such a form. And salutations to Him who is the Lord of
    (and protects) the quarters or directions.


   Notes:

     BhaTTa bhAskara quotes a brAhmaNa sentence explain why some Yajus
     are ubhayatonamaskAra's (having a "namaH" at the beginning as well
     as the end) and some are anyataratonamaskAra's, (having a "namaH"
     at the beginning only):

     tatra brAhmaNaM cha bhavati "te haite ghoratarA rudrA ubhayato-
     namaskArAH | athaite shAntatarA ye.anyataratonamaskArAH" iti |

     A BrAhmaNa also states: The ubhayatonamaskAra's are meant for
     propitiating the extremely fierce forms of Rudra. And the
     anyatarato-namaskAra's are meant for propitiating the peaceful
     forms of Rudra.

     dvitIyaM yajuH
     --------------

    namo vR^ixebhyo harikeshebhyaH pashUnAM pataye namaH |

   Obeisances to the trees (vR^ixa) bearing green tufts (harikesha)
   and to the lord of animals (pashUnAM patiH).

    sAyaNAchAryabhAshhyam.h
    -----------------------


    haritvarNAH keshAH parNarUpA yeshhAM te harikeshAstAdR^ishebhyo
    vR^ixebhyo vR^ixAkArarudramUrtibhyo namo .astu | yo rudraH pashUnAM
    pAlakastasmai namo .astu |


    Salutations to the forms of Rudra that are trees having tufts of
    green leaves. Harikesha is that which has green tufts made of leaves.
    Obeisances to Rudra who is the protector of animals (pashus).


   Notes:
   ------

 1) BhaTTa bhAskara quotes a shruti text defining "pashupati"

  "yeshhAmIshe pashupatiH pashUnAM chatushhpadAmuta cha dvipadAM"

  He is Pashupati who is the lord of "pashus" both four-footed
  as well as two-footed.

  Also, the linga purANa states:

  brahmAdyAH sthAvarAntAshcha pashavaH parikIrtitAH |
  teshhAM patitvAdvishvesho bhavaH pashupatiH smR^itaH ||

  All beings beginning from BrahmA to the immovables (such as
  a clump of grass) are called pashu's. Being the Lord of the
  pashu's, Bhava (Shiva), the ruler of the world, is called Pashupati.

  The mahAbhArata states:

  sarvadA yatpashUnpAti taishcha yadramate punaH |
  teshhAmadhipatitvAchcha tasmAtpashupatiH smR^itaH ||

  He sports with the pashu's since He protects them always.
  Since He is the Lord of them He is said to be Pashupati.

 2) An explanation of "pashu" and "Pashupati" is also found in the
    jAbAlyupanishhad of the sAma veda:

 (jAbAli says:)

 pashupatirahaMkArAvishhTaH saMsArI jIvaH |

 The lord of pashus (Shiva) (acting as if) under
 the influence of ahaMkAra (ego, individuality)
 is the jIva (individual soul) (revolving) in
 worldly existence.

 sa eva pashuH |

 That (jIva) is himself a "pashu" (literally animal).

 sarvaGYaH paJNchakR^ityasaMpannaH
 sarveshvara IshaH pashupatiH |

 The all-knowing Ishvara, the lord of all, and
 enodowed with the (power of performing) the five
 kinds of actions is called pashupatiH (the lord of
 the jIvas or pashus).

 [upanishhad brahma yogin in his commentary quotes  the
  vArtikakAra :

  kAraNaM kAryamutpAdya kAryatAmiva gachchhati iti
  vArtikakArokteshcha |

  The cause, having given rise to the effect, seems to
  become the effect - so says the vArtikakAra. ]

 ke pashava iti punaH sa tamuvAcha ||

 (PaippalAdi) again asked (jAbAli): Who are the
  pashu's?

 jIvAH pashava uktAH | tatpatitvAt.h pashupatiH ||

 The jIvas are pashu's. (Shiva) is called pashupati,
 being the lord of those (pashu's).

 sa punastaM hovAcha kathaM jIvAH pashava iti |
 kathaM tatpatiriti ||

 (PaippalAdi) again asked: How are those jIvas
  the pashu's?

 sa tamuvAcha yathA tR^iNAshino vivekahInAH para-
 preshhyAH kR^ishhyAdikarmasu niyuktAH sakala-
 duHkhasahAH svasvAmibadhyamAnA gavAdayaH pashavaH |
 yathA tatsvAmina iva sarvaGYa IshaH pashupatiH ||

 (jAbAli) replied: Just as animals such as cows
 that eat grass, etc., that are deviod of discrimina-
 tion, that are driven by others, that are engaged
 in occupations such as agriculture, that endure
 all kinds of pain and sorrow, and that are bound
 by their master, (so are the jIvas, the pashu's).
 Just as the master of such animals is "pashupati"
 so the all-knowing Ishvara the pashupati of the
 jIvas.

 [upanishhad brahma yogin answers the question:
  What is pAsha, the chain that binds the pashu's?

 svAGYAnapAshena badhyanta iti pashavaH

 Because they are bound by the pAsha (chain) of ignorance of the
 Self, they are called pashu's. ]

 Correction: In the last post, I had incorrectly spelled
 "trayaMbaka" instead of the correct version "tryaMbaka."
 Thanks to Ganesh for pointing this out.
