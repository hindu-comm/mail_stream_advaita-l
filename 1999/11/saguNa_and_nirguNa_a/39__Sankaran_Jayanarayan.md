There is also a GItaa verse (12.2):

shrii bhagavaan.h uvaacha :

maayavesya mano ye maaM
nitya-yukta upaasate
sraddhayaa paraayopetaH
te me yuktatama matah

"Those who always worship Me, endowed with great shraddha (faith,
dedication and conviction), I consider perfect."

There are several verses following the above one, all of them praising
upaasana, and it ends with "If you are NOT able to do this, THEN you may
perform karma dedicating it to Me." So upaasana is not necessarily
associated with karma.

Thanks very much for all the clarifications.
