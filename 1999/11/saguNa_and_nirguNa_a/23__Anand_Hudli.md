 Although there may have been a shAlagrAma tIrtha, apart from the
 shAlagrAma shilA, it seems more likely that Shankara is referring
 to the latter (shAlagrAma shilA) rather than to a shAlagrAma tIrtha.
 To see this, examine the context of the quote in the sUtra-bhAshhya.
 The context is the sUtra "sthAnAdivyapadeshAchcha" (1.2.14) which
 appears immediately after "antara upapatteH", a sUtra which points
 out that what is referred to as occurring in the eye is Brahman.

 Shankara begins the commentary on "sthAnAdivyapadeshAchcha" thus:

  kathaM punarAkAshavatsarvagatasya brahmaNo .axyalpasthAnamupadyata iti |

  (Shankara raises a doubt which he then answers:)

 How can Brahman that is everywhere like space said to occur (specifically)
 in a small place such as the eye?

 It is in reply to this doubt that Shankara says essentially that Brahman
 may be said to specifically occur in some places (for the sake of
 upAsana) just as VishNu is said to reside in the shAlagrAma. At this
 point, the analogy of Brahman <-> VishhNu and eye <-> shAlagrAma shilA
 is more appropriate than an analogy with eye <-> a holy place shAlagrAma,
 because VishhNu can also be said to reside specifically in a small place
 such as the shAlagrAma shilA even though He pervades everything
 everywhere.

 Further, at least according to some, Shankara started the practice
 of the panchAyatana pUjA of which worship of the shAlagrAma shilA is a
 part. So he must have known about the shAlagrAma shilA. I am not
 denying that he could have known about the shAlagrAma tIrtha too.

 Also, neither the bhAmati of VAchaspati Mishra nor the nyAyanirNaya
 of Anandagiri says anything about the shAlagrAma.
