This may be slightly steering away from the topic, but I believe the term
"shaalagraama" referred to by Shankara was NOT the "shilaa" (the stone
which is worshipped as a representation of VishNu) but a tiirtha (holy
spot) where VishhNu is said to reside. In the translation of the Vishnu
Purana by H.H.Wilson, in the story of JaDa Bharata, it is described that
Bharata performed penances at the "Holy place of Shalagrama". The
translator explains in a footnote that although in present-day India the
exact location of this holy place has become obscure, there may have been
such a pilgrimage spot in ancient India. In the entire Vishnu Purana,
there is not a single reference to the shaalagraama-shilaa, but to the
shaalagraama pilgrimage spot *only*. The shaalagraama-shilaa may have
been a later development :-)
