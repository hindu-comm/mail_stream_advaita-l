I fully agree. That is why I wrote a saguNopasaka desires GYAana and not
moksha.  Even   'not this not this' approach is not totally desire less. In
fact one of the qualification for such an approach is an intense longing for
liberation. May be the feeling to get liberated can not be stated as a
desire.
