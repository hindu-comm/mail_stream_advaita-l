I apologize for these statements. I should have avoided them. It is one
of my personal biases that showed up. I have heard from different
people that such and such work is not shankara's. Most of them happened
to be what I like a lot. For instance, saundaryalaharii, trishatii
bhaashhya, subrahmanya bhujangam and so on.

I have learnt to ignore those who claim non-authenticity. To me kanchi
periyava quotes them as shankara's work, that is  enough for me to
believe it is authentic.

Thank you.

Ravi
