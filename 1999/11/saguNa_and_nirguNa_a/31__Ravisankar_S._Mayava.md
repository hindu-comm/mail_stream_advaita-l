I think it is appropriate to include vishnusahasranama bhaShya and
trishatii bhashya. To me the purpose of the discussion is to understand
about saguNa/nirguNa aspects of brahman and not establishing whether
prabodha sudhaakara is an authentic work or not. This topic will be of
importance in such bhAshya-s where bhagavAn's kalyANa guNa-s are
discussed, the naamas that highlight nirguNa aspect will stand in
contrast and make the commentator say something specific.

About the  authenticity of this work or any other work, I would believe
only if  Acharya-s of shR^ingagiri or kAnchi comment on it.  Let us not
flatter ourselves assuming that we are competent to do that, so much so
when are all changing our views like changing clothes.

I request the members to post their understanding on this subject based
vivekachuuDamani and any other works of shankara they are aware of.
