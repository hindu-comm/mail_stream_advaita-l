I believe so, too.

But in the VishhNusahasranaama (around the 91st verse), VishhNu is
referred to as "GuNabhR^it.h" and "ni.rguNaH". The commentary by Shankara
for these two names are (I don't have the translated work with me, so they
may not be absolutely accurate):

GuNabhR^it.h : One who is the support of the GuNas.
ni.rguNaH : one who is beyond the 3 guNas of prakR^iti -- sattva, rajas
and tamas.

Note that the term "ni.rguNa" is used in exactly the same sense as in all
the bhaashhyas. According to Madhusuudana sarasvatii, saguNa brahman has
*only* the sattva guNa (as per Anand's posting regarding this -- in a
newsgroup). The One who is being worshipped in this verse is no doubt
ni.rguNa brahman, who is without ANY guNa whatsoever (including the sattva
guNa.) So there is scope for the worship of ni.rguNa brahman, after all
:-)

But there is also a popular shloka in the advaita tradition which goes:
"guruH brahmaa guruH vishhNuH guruH devomaheshvaraH .
guruH saakshaat.h paraM brahma tasmai shrii gurave namaH .. "

"The Guru is Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva. My salutations to the Guru who is
the supreme Brahman Itself."

The Guru is extolled as not only the saguNa brahman, but the ni.rguNa
brahman also (I assume "paraMbrahma" must refer to the ni.rguNa brahman).
So there cannot be any difference between the two, if they both refer to
the Guru.

I'm not sure whether or not the verse was from a genuine work of Shankara,
but it seems to be well within the precepts of advaita. I felt I
understood the (*lack of*) distinction between saguNa and ni.rguNa brahman
only after reading the posting by Anand.
