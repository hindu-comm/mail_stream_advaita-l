According to Swami Vidyaranya's biography on Shankara, the first
work of Shankara was his commentary on the VishhNu sahasranaama, which
revealed his genius in exposition and exegesis. This work of Shankara is
accepted as authentic by the MaThas, as indicated by its presence among
the complete works of Shankara published by the Sringeri Math.

Of course, the VivekachuuDaamaNi has a commentary by Swami Chandrashekhara
Bharati, and is certainly accepted as an important work on advaita. In
fact, some teachers begin teaching the import of the scriptures by first
teaching the meaning of the verses in the VivekachuuDamaNi.

The VishhNu sahasranaama is from the Mahaabhaarata and is accepted by all
advaitins, irrespective of whether or not Shankara has commented on it.
The fact is that VishhNu is referred to as ni.rguNa during worship in both
the sahasranaama and the puraaNas. The worship of VishhNu as ni.rguNa
stands independent of Shankara's commentary on it.

I remember reading some verses from the Linga Purana where Shiva is hailed
as ni.rguNa also.
