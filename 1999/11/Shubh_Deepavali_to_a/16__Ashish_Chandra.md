7. bhAvaH: Pure existence.  It can mean one who manifests as the
universe.

8.bhUtAtmA: The essence of all beings. He is the in-dweller, antaryAmin,
of all objects individually and collectively. "esha ta atmAntaryAmy
amR^itaH" - this thy AtmA is the inner pervader and the immortal (Br. U.
3.7.3.22)

9.bhUta-bhAvanaH: He who originates and develops all elements

Question  - Should the quote from Br.U be "esha tu AtmAntaryAmy " ? I am
not sure if there is a printing mistake.
