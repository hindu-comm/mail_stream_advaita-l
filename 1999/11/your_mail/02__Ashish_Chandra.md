I am sure "extravagant claims" is your perception of things so you are
perfectly entitled to your opinion. But to suggest that this is
propagandist(as in dissemination of known falsehoods) in nature would be
quite erroneous.

Adi Sankaracharya claimed for himself the position of Jagadguru for Kali
Yuga. Is that why you choose to follow his teachings to a tee? It is
probably not the reason as you must have arrived at your own conclusions
based on your shikshan and your Guru's updesas. Similarly, his(Swami
Vivekananda's) Shishyas too have arrived at the conclusion that here was a
giant the likes of which had not been seen in a while. There is no one
goading you to believe that Sw. V was one. That is all that was said. You
can debate all you want whether or not he was one (expert) or not and you
wouldn't convince me. Similarly, I too have no desire of impressing upon you
how great he (Sw. V) was.

Yes he did say that. And what you are indulging in is text-torturing
yourself. Instead of taking an exhortation to become tall confident men
(which is what is meant by saying that you should rise and endeavour to be
Rshis), why should you consider that he is *dismissing* what the Rshis have
said or preached ? Where there are words, there would be interpretations
galore (Brahma Sutra for example). Our endeavour should be to concern
ourselves with the message and not how the words are structured. I know that
structure of words is important but sometimes a sentence or two here or
there does not give an adequate picture. Maybe what Devendra has percieved
is erroneous in your point of view as far as the Rshi statement is
concerned. However, the inadequacies of the reader should not be propagated
back up to the very source. If so, we can sit in judgement over Adi Sankara
himself, going by what some of the "pseudo-advaitins" say!

Who is this us ? One who doesn't have a clue about India ? One who only goes
there for family visists? Sorry to make this personal but you just want to
swipe your hand and fell everything on the table. Verily it must have been
the colonial babu class that rose up to the chant of Vande Mataram. The same
class whose soul was stirred by the writings of Tilak and Aurobindo. Surely
the simpleton village folks had nothing to do with the struggle for
independence. The same simpletons who rose against the Brits in 1857 and
those simpletons who died by the millions in the famine of Bengal. Surely
they were not crying out for release! Why do you bother to comment on things
that you just don't understand?

The previous paragraph should apply here too.

Thanks for taking me at my word. But exactly what made you reach the
conclusion that RK Mission is not doing anything ? What is this thing about
proportion that you talk of? Surely you are not saying that it is my
contention that RK Mission is the No. 1 relief organisation. All I said, in
fact, is that one only gets to hear about Chrtistian organisations doing
relief work in India. The Hindu orgs like APSS, RK Mission, VKA, VYK are
never even mentioned.

Have you read Swami Vivekanand's biography? May I suggest it to you so you
can clear some of your own doubts about him. And I can assure you that it is
not propaganda.

ashish
