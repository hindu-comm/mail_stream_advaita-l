Dear friends,

We all had a discussion on this topic sometime back. Last night
when I was reading "Talks with Ramana Maharshi" I found a
brilliant description of jivana mukti and also krama mukti. It
was around page number 495, starting from the discussion on the
vedic verse

"na karmaNa na prajaya dhanena tyagenaike amR^itatvamAnasuH"
