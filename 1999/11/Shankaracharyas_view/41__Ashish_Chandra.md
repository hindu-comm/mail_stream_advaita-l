Namaste,

I was going through the list archives on the subject of adhikAra. Thanks to
Vidya, Bala and Jaldhar for some informative posts. I also came across
something Vidya had written about 3 years back on the soc.religion.hindu
list on the question of adhikAra of reciting Vedas for shudras and women.
The post is at http://www.hindunet.org/srh_home/1996_4/msg00177.html

My question is, since the Jagadguru has himself pointed out to the
non-applicability of some Smritis, as mentioned in Vidya's post, what
exactly is a Smartha to follow ? What should be retained and what discarded
? Is there any agreement on these things? Is there a better way of learning
about this (i.e. from a book or articles)?

thanks
ashish
