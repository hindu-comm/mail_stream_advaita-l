But then so are artham and kAmam. Just because they are declared
as the ends of life, that doesn't mean that they have any eternal
value. Doesn't Manu himself say that moksham is the true goal, as
its fruits relate not only to this world but also the world beyond.
The same way though dharmam would've its effect even after this
world, its final end is only moksham.

Ofcourse, it was understood that not everybody had the qualities
required for moksham. So with the practice of virtue (dharmam), one
would burn up the accumulated karmam and evolve towards a suitable
contidion for moksham, even if it be in a future life. So Atma
JnAnam is the true goal.

Then why should a snAtaka even take up the stages of a householder
(grhasta) or a vAnaprastha (forest dweller)? Why can't he directly
take up samnyAsam? Everything at the right time. Though I'm not sure
of the significance of manidhanu or indradhanu, I would think that
the mantrams have a similar relation to the stage of life that one
is in.

Maybe. But also consider that the caste lines in the shruti and
earlier smrithis are not drawn so hard.

I don't think so. Dharmam is the way life is to be lived. And for
what purpose? - Atma jnAnam only. So the sage who's realized
himself, is the person who's aware of what exactly is involved in
the process and is the best person to clearly prescribe the dharmam
for the society. Infact, that some of the writers of the dharma shAstrams
were not sages themselves, might be one of the reasons for such excesses in
the texts.

Yes, though the brAhmana was responsible for laying down the dharmam,
it was the kshatriya who was responsible for making sure that the
dharmam was properly followed and when it wasn't, to punish the guilty. And
it's doubtful whether he'd have resorted to the ghastly punishments
prescribed in some texts, whatever say the brAhmanas might have in the whole
deal. And if the brAhmanas had actually been that sadistic in practice,
there's no way Vedic life would have endured for so long - there would've
been a popular rebellion long ago.

Even a historian like AL Basham, who cannot be said to be too liberal
with his praises, endorses that India was one of the most humane
societies in those times and that there's no evidence that such cruel
punishments adovocated in the shAstrams were ever implemented.
