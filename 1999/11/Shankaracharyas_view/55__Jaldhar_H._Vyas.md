This is the difference between Karma and Karmayoga.  Karma has all kinds
of goals, getting a son, a pay raise, or even supernatural siddhis.  The
goals are met, then their effects dissipate.  But it is only when actions
are done with a view to removing oneself from sansara by performing them
without thought of the results that they becom Karmayoga.

Actually in the discussion of Rshi Vamadeva who is mentioned in
Aitereyopanishad as having been liberated while still in the womb,
Shankaracharya discusses different views on this and maintains that
sannyasa is something that can be taken from any ashram or even no
ashram.  Because it is a negation of the very existence of ashrams and the
like.

Just as sannyasa is an end in itself.  Dharma is to be practised bcause it
is Dharma.  This is discussed in the Mimamsa shastra.  While many Dharmic
acts have definite purposes (viniyoga) both exoteric and esoteric, in some
cases the purpose has been forgotten and in some cases ther never was a
"significance" in the first place.  It's still Dharma.

As I mentioned above, chittashuddhi is just the fortunate byproduct of
*some* kinds of Dharmic activity.

Well, the smrtis of say Yajnavalkya or Parashara also contain
"excesses".

But consider this:  Manu is the lawgiver par excellance and he was a
Kshatriya.  And in the Gita who does Krishna Bhagawan offer as an example
of a true practioner o Karma?  Janaka, a Kshatriya.  In fact, the Gita is
a conversation between two Kshatriyas.  Like the old theory that the
Upanishads (and Buddhism and Jainism) were reactions against
"excessive"  Brahman ritualism, a Kshatriya Vs Brahman split on Dharma
doesn't hold water.  Probably amongst both there was a split betwen
pro-karma and pro-Jnana factions with other groups trying to reach a
middle ground between the two.
