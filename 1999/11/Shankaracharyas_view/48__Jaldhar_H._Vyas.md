Yikes! On rereading this I noticed there is a sentence missing near the
end which completely changes the meaning of what I'm trying to
say.  "There are such people even today" refers to sages.  I was
suggesting Kartik (or indeed anyone reading this) could be a sage not a
random justifier.

Apologies for any confusion which may have been caused.
