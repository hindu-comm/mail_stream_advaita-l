Yes.

No.  Why then would Dharma and Moksha be considered seperate
purusharthas?  At best Dharma purifies the person who practices them by
putting them in the state where they *can* achieve atmajnana.  But it
cannot in any way *cause* atmajnana.  The goal of Dharma is to remove
Dosha which is created in various ways.  Even the staunchest vegetarian
ahimsaka for example causes pain and death to other living
things.  Without the regular practice of nityakarmas, the dosha caused by
this would build up.

Then how do you explain for example the comment of the Paraskara Grhya
Sutra that a Snataka (one who has undergone the Samavartana sanskara
completing Vedic study but is not yet married.) must say manidhanu instead
of indradhanu (rainbow)?  I don't see how that aids or hinders atmajnana.

This is a popular theory but pure speculation.

For the purposes of Dharma it doesn't matter if the sages were
"realized" in the Vedantic sense or not, only that they knew Dharma.

So do Manu and Yajnavalkya in their Dharmashastras.

The vyavahara and prayaschita sections of the smrtis seem to have been
mostly based on wishful thinking.  There is little evidence any of it was
carried out in practice.  Mostly the punishment for crims seems to have
been whatever the local Raja or his agents thought was appropriate.
Certainly they haven't received anywhere nearly as much attention as
achara in the literature.

What is Brahmanism anyway?
