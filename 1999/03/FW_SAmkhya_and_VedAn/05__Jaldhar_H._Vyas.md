This is why I don't like the use of Advaita by itself.  Advaita is an
adjective which could be applaid to any number of things.  What is
important here is the noun it modifies, namely Vedanta.  Only the
teachings of Shankaracharya and the Acharyas in his parampara has the
right to call itself Advaita Vedanta.  Others who attempt to jump on the
bandwagon are either being sloppy or deceitful.
