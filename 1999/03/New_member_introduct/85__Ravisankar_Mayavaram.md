Subject: new to Advaita-L

   I was introduced to Advaita Vedanta about 15 years ago when I was in
college and took a course on Indian philosophy.  I was really into pursuing
spiritual growth and tended towards the eastern religions.  I recall that I
thought Advaita Vedanta held many truths.  The book I have is by Eliot
Deutsch, it focuses on the philosophy and is difficult to read.  I would
like to learn more about Advaita Vedanta and thought that this list might
help.

Truly,
Wendy
