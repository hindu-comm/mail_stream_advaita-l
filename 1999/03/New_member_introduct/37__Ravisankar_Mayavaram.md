INTRODUCTION:

Namaste,

I am a theoretical physicist by profession. I am married with two children
and at present my age is 52 years.

My family is quite religious and therefore I started my life in Bhakti
marg. I read Gita and Ramayana and many other religious books, written by
present days saints and vendantins. Recently, by reading the books by Swami
Parmanand I have become very much interested in Advaitya Vedanta.

With regards

Ram Kishore
