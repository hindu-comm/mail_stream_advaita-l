Dear Members,

I think I should clarify what I wrote earlier regarding Maya and Snake in
the Rope. I am sure all of us are tired of the back and forth repetitive
exchanges but what I had wanted to point out was

    Not judging whether anyone here knows what Maya is

but

    Whether any of us KNOW what Maya is.

It may be helpful for us in realising the Self to categorize everything
else but the Self as Maya. I believe I have read earlier on this forum that
several texts state that Brahman/Atman alone exists. What I was trying to
find out was whether, when we make such a claim i.e. This is an illusion
(Maya) and Brahman alone exists, we are trying to repeat the words and
works of the Acharyas. This is far from judging anyone, in my opinion,
whether here or elsewhere.

I am attempting to learn whether any of us here have been able to find out
first hand, or even realize, what exactly Maya is. How do we know it
without knowing the self ?

This is all I am trying to find out Nanda. This is not judging.

Ashish
