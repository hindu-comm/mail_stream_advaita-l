The subject matter of advaita is enunciated in the uppanishhads and
various other books like purANa-s etc. This list is for discussing the
views of sha.nkara and his followers on the upanishhads etc. These
people are not accepted as prophets. If you want to discuss about
prophets and "advaita" (I don't know what the quotes are doing around
advaita. advaita = teachings of sha.nkara and his followers), I
suggest that you start prophets-and-"advaita"-l. People interested in
that discussion can subscribe to that list.
