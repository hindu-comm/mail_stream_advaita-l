This issue was discussed on the list some time back.
Please refer to the article from Vidyasankar
http://listserv.tamu.edu/cgi/wa?A2=ind9704b&L=advaita-l&F=&S=&P=4144

You may also want to read the Advaita Vedanta Page by
Vidyasankar.

This will explain the issue.

The Archive is close to 3 years old (this May it be 3 years).
Many issues were discussed in the past. If you search the archive
you may find the answer even before posting the question on the
list.

The same question you asked (in a different form) was asked by
Nanda in
http://listserv.tamu.edu/cgi/wa?A2=ind9704b&L=advaita-l&F=&S=&P=1635

Please read the archives.
