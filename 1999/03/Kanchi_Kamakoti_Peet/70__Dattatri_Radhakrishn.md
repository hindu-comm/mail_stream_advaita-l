Namaste
   A doubt has developed in me regarding the title "Sankaracharya" being
conferred on the Mathadipathis. In the books & information that I have
read about Adi Sankaracharya, I have seen only the names of Sringeri,
Dwaraka, Puri & Badrinath as the 4 mathas established by Sri Sankara. If
that is the case then, why do we refer to the Acharyas of the Kanchi
Kamakoti Peetam as "Sankaracharya" ?? I mean no disrespect to the matha
or the people associated with it, I am just curious to know who
conferred the title of "Sankaracharya" on the mathadipathis of Kanchi
matha. Is there a *criterion* for being conferred the title of
"Sankaracharya" ?

Thanks
Dattatri
