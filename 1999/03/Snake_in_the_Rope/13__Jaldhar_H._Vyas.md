Oddly enough I didn't find it very hard to find people who knew God.  But
then again I was looking for people who had seen Hindu Gods whereas
Vivekananda was looking for a 19th century liberal protestant God which
may be a bit harder to come by.

Honestly, I don't know how he got this reputation for being some kind of
expert on Vedanta.  He was a marginal figure, not very well-versed in the
subject.  Whatever utility he has today is in explaining Vedanta to
outsiders and even there I think you can do much better.

No the problem these days is not a lack of information or guides, but a
lack of people who'll _do_ anything with these resources.
