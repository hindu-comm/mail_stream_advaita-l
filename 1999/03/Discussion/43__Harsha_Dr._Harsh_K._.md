Harsha: Agreed. I am relatively new on this list. Jaldharji's recent comments
seemed to me to be highly inappropriate and narrow minded given that most Indians
hold Swami Vivekananda and Sri Ramakrishana in high esteem. Do his comments have
official sanction here because this list is devoted to Sri Shankra's teaching
only? I would like that clarified. I have not seen comments of the nature that
Jaldharji made on the other list devoted to Sri Shankra's teaching -
Advaitin at onelist.com.

Harsha: Respectfully, what you say is highly misleading at best and at worst
completely inaccurate. You may want to go back and read the original sources
again. Of course everyone must find the Truth for themselves. There is no other
way. But Sages have clearly indicated the Path that Reveals the Self.
