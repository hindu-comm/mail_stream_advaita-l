What kind of a Guru you are talking about? If you have any Guru in your
mind who would say such a thing, please educate us all. Rama was clear
in his reasoning. I don't think it needs any further elaboration.

English translation:
===================

harShaH means joy or pleasure which is manifested in the
countenance, etc. It is the mental attitude of self esteem and
depreciation of others. SHE causes this experience, hence, SHE is
called as giver of that. SHE is bliss, hence SHE bestows it on
others, as the cause and result are one.

Or this name can be interpreted in another way. The term "pradA"
also means to cut off. SHE cuts off the fleeting pleasures
arising from ephemeral things like wealth, youth, children,
relatives and so on, by taking them away and conferring
renunciation and thereby granting eternal bliss of brahman.

AUM harShapradAyai namaH

Hi,

My name is Swamy S. Ketha.  I live in Edison, NJ.

My intereset in Advaita philsophy was born out of my desire to know more
about Hinduism.  My limited knowlege of Avaita philosophy comes from
reading books, and listening to lectures at Ramakrishna Ashram in
Hyderabad.

I came to know baout the List while doing a search for Adi Sankara.
