1) Why do you want to preach or advocate to others? Is it not
imporant to learn and practice, before one attempts to explain or
advocate?

2) It is simple to be truthful and honest. One has to be clever
to be otherwise. If someone asks you why are you doing a certain
thing or reading a certain book, you can tell the true reasons. I
see no difficulty in that. You will face difficulty and have to
be clever only if you want to sound intelligent and smart.

What is the problem in telling your friend, I cam across
something called advaita-vedanta, it sounds plausible to me, I am
trying to learn more and understand better because I think it
will help me.

Does shruti says this? If is just based on a Tamil proverb
"kaNdavar vindilar viNdavar kaNdilar, either it has to be
reinterpreted or dismissed.  I believe that shrI shankara knew
and explained it in the best possible way. This is my faith. Now
I can question the author of that saying, on what basis does he
say that "Those who know do not speak, and those who speak do not
know." It sounds pretty irrational to me. There may hundreds of
people who speak without knowing. But what prevents one who knows
from speaking?

Most honest stance is to speak truth. Not coat it with rational
arguments.

Problem comes because you want to advocate. Otherwise, it would
not arise.

I see no difficult in practising/learning something which you
find reasonable and want verify it further.  How else will you
progress?  If you want your friend or colleague applaud you for
that and say that you are smart, then it may be difficult.


Hope I did not offend you by my questions. Your post was very
helpful to me. It clarified some of my thoughts which I choose
not to express.


with respects,
