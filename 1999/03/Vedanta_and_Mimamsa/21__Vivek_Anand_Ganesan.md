Hello all :
        My sincere thanks to those who answered my previous questions.  I
would like to ask one more.

What are the similarities and differences between Vedanta and Mimamsa?

Thanks in advance,

-Vivek Aanand Ganesan.

Dear  Vivek

namaste.

I understand the need of your request. It will be very useful if
such a compilation is done. However, it will be a time consuming
task. If you or someone else on the list is willing to volunteer,
others can support the cause.

1) I think we can request the list members to write to the
volunteer about the books they have read on advaita vedanta and
their brief comments on the books. We can also request them from
what books and sources they learnt the basics. This data can be
compiled/edited and presented in the FAQ or in a WWW page.

2) Whoever volunteers can also study the archives and dig out
valuable information provided by the knowledgeable members of the
list.

I can include this request along the with the e-mail address of
the volunteer in the monthly FAQ, and the welcome file sent out
to the member when they join. I know that this will be time
consuming work. But the end result as you pointed out will be
very useful.

There is also a good bibliography page in Vidyasankar's advaita
vedAnta page.

Thanks for your valuable suggestion.

With regards,
Ravi
