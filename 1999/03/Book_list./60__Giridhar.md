namaste. I have been asked by three people to post the books I had sent
to Vivek Anand Ganesan to the advaita list. Here it is. Note that I recommend
these books based on my personal reading, because I own many of these
books. It does not mean they are the best translations or books available,
but from what I have seen, due to limited knowledge and exposure, it
looks like a decent list.

PS:             I have already clarified why I said "almost" with regard to Shankara's
teachings. Please re-read that post, if you are still unsure why I said so.


Many portions of the following is taken from my home page,

http://www.geocities.com/RodeoDrive/1415/
and my contributions to

http://sanskrit.gde.to

The above site translartion of astavakra gita, vivekachudamani,
bhaja govindam etc.

A preliminary introduction to Hinduism and its general
philosophies is needed, before one can understand advaita
in the right perspective with regard to other darshana-s.
I have included them at each level. This is a very
short book list, based on my own reading and preferences. Use the online
bookstore (http://www.amazon.com) to get publisher information. RK means
ramakrishna math publication.

I have not included great books like bhaja govindam
or Shivanandalahari since they are more practice/bhakti
oriented stotras, rather than general philosophy. If we
want to include that, I can make a separate list for that.
