The childhood is lost by attachment to playfulness. Youth is lost by
attachment to woman. Old age passes away by thinking over many
things. But there is hardly anyone who wants to be lost in
parabrahman.

For more than a decade, in the childhood, play and games
take away our time. Toys soon become a past memory and
youth comes with thoughts of passion and lust. Charmed
by the looks (and forgetting the verse 3 of Bhaja govindam),
youth is lost in the arms of Cupid. Energy and power is lost
and man becomes old. But attachment and worries do not
decrease. The infirm body still clings to hope and despair,
and has an excess of tortous thoughts. Primarly due to the
inability to control the mind when the body was young and firm.
Every one has to die soon but we spend the entire life in this
way ! Isn't this a tradegy worth pondering over ?

        Unless one gives up lust, greed and becomes a sannyasa, there
is no hope of liberation but we find there is hardly anyone
who wants to be lost in parabrahman !!
