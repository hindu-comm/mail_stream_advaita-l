Who is your wife ? Who is your son ? Strange is this samsaara, the world.
Of whom are you ? From where have you come ? Brother, ponder
over these truths.

The basic question in these verses comes down to the
question of the atma vichara 'Who am I'. Who we call
our spouse was only the son/daughter of someone else
before having no relation with you when we were born.
Intense vichara into the maya of samsaara leads to
atma vichara.

##satsaN^gatve## \ = in good company;

>From satsanga, company of good people, comes non-attachment,
from non-attachment comes
freedom from delusion, which leads to self-settledness. From
self-settledness comes Jiivan muktii.


Satsangh can be translated to association with Sat. Sat is
the Truth that exists that all times. That's why sitting
at the feet of a sage who has realized the Truth calms
the mind. From constant association with such sages, comes
detachment followed by freedom from delusion leading
to self-settledness and Jivanmukti.

##kaH## \ = who/what use( in the sense of kva?(where));
##kaamavikaaraH## \ = sensual/sexual attraction;
##shushhke## \ = in the drying up of;
##niire## \ = water;
##ka## \ = what( use) is the;

##GYaate## \ = in the realised state;
##tattve## \ = truth;
##kaH## \ = what (use) is;
##sa.nsaaraH## \ = world/family bond;

What good is lust when youth has fled ? What use is a lake
which has no water ? Where are the relatives when wealth is
gone ? Where is samsaara, the world,  when the Truth is known ?

The world, consisting of names and forms, will be found
to be unreal on realization of the Truth, says Shankara.

Do not boast of wealth, friends, and youth. Each one of these
are destroyed within a minute by time. Free yourself from the
illusion of the world of Maya and attain the timeless Truth.


Wealth, youth etc. are all temporary things, which are
being destroyed every minute. Shankara says that
by attaining the timeless Turth one can free oneself from
the Maya.

Daylight and darkness, dusk and dawn, winter and springtime
come and go. Time plays and life ebbs away. But the storm of
desire never leaves.

Though time passes swiftly, one finds that the storm of desire
seems to be never ending stream. Thus, one who has controlled
all desires is great.

This bouquet of twelve verses was imparted to a grammarian
by the all-knowing Shankara, adored as the bhagavadpada.
------------------------------

The complete text is 33 verses or so and can be
read in http://sanskrit.gde.to. It contains several verses
that are composed by the disciples of Shankara.

I would like to end the postings on bhaja govindam
with this set of twelve verses called the dvaadasha manjari.

Personally, I like to contemplate on these verses and
other works of Shankara and bhagavan in depth. Therefore, I
will be not be posting to the list for a while.

With best wishes.
namaste.
