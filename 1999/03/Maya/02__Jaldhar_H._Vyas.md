Once more with feeling.  When a person gets up in the dark and accidently
mistakes a rope for a snake he is superimposing a false cognition onto a
real one based on incomplete knowledge.  When the light comes on, the true
nature of the rope is revealed and the "snake" becomes non-existent.  In
the same way maya is a synonym for avidya.  It is the lack of correct
knowledge of the true nature of things which causes the jiva to believe it
is seperate from Brahman and the world of names and forms exists.  In
truth, they have no independent existence outside of the jivas ignorance.

The "son of a barren women" is only a contradiction because you know what
the terms "son", and "barren woman" mean in advance.  The statement is not
independent, it depends on external facts for comprehension.  In fact,
there is no reason why you could not define the terms so there is no
contradiction just as you can redefine the parallel postulate and still
come up with a valid system of geometry.  In the same way maya or avidya
is used to denote the false cognition of the jiva.  It isn't necessary
_for_the_purpose_of_the_inquiry_into_Brahman_ to know why maya is maya.
Presumably you could come up with an infinite number of other concepts but
there would be no point.

Btw every single one of your points have already been gone over.  But as
you seem to have missed them, here they are again.

Because the apparent similarities are not relevant.

In what manner is this discussion being carried out?  For some types of
discussion a comparison maybe appropriate but the "business" of Vedanta is
enquiry into Brahman and for that the similarities are far less important
than the differences.

The concept of the self is present in many philosophies.  There is nothing
special about the Samkhya concept of the self that makes it of particular
importance.

As a conjecture yes.  But why rely on some vague guess when we have
stronger and more direct evidence of the origins of Vedanta in
Mimamsa--which is also one of the oldest schools.  And the apparent
similarities are quite easily explained by the fact that both Samkhya and
Mimamsa are based on the the Vedas.

No it developed out of the attempts to understand and analyze the language
of the Vedas.  That part of the enquiry that dealt with Karma became Purva
Mimamsa and that which dealt with Brahman became Uttara Mimamsa or
Vedanta.  Both Maharshi Jaimini the author of the Purva Mimamsa Sutras
and Maharshi Badarayana the author of the Brahma Sutras are quoted as
authorities in each others work as are many other early thinkers.

I see no reason to accept dubious evidence when much stronger evidence
exists.

Because the fact is samkhya does not contribute to the understanding of
Vedanta.  If anything it is the opposite.  Without the "Vedantization" of
Samkhya t would have long ago ceased to exist.

And if Maharshi Kapila was the grandfather of Vedanta, it would be valid
for this discussion.
