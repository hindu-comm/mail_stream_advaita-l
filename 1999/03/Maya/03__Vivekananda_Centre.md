namaste and pranams

Ref all the threads dealing with maya and samkhya darshan

We are highly obliged with all the answers sri Jaladharji has given us. We
had hoped that we will get some response from Sri Giridharji, Sri Ramji, Sri
Vaidyaji who were the learned scholars  who had helped us along at the
earlier stage on this thread. We are highly obliged to Sri Jaladhariji for
throwing so much light on all the topics but just to be fair to the others
we would like to get some response from them too.
