    This question arises due to the identity of the doer ship. Who does
the action ?. But a word about the control of mind. The correct phrase i
would prefer is not 'Control of Mind ' rather i would use 'Mastering the
Mind'.

    Sri Ramana Mahrishi say's . There r two ways to control (master) the
mind.

    1. One is to fight with the mind like fighting with a Bull to get
control over it.

    2. Second one is like having a tuft of grass and making the Bull to
follow u'r direction.

    But u'r question is still un answered bcause , even in the process
of meditation or other practise there might exist the feeling of doer
ship.
