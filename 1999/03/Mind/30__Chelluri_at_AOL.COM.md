                                              OM
We all heard "You control your mind"
Who is this "you" who can control the mind.  The "you" is jada cant do
anything.
Mind has to control itself.    How?
Practice meditation.   Who does the meditation?  Ofcourse it is the mind.

I could not find the answer any where.   What are your thoughts?

                                                                       Nagy
