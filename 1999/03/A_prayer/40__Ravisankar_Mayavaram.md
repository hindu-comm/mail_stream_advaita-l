I read this nice verse in the book Acharya's call.

shAstraM shArira mImAMsa devastu parameshvaraH |
AchAryaH shankarAchAryaH santu janmani janmani ||

If I have take to birth again and again please grant me these
following wishes. Let shAstra I follow be shArira mImAMsa, let
the parameshwara be my iShTa devata and let my AchArya be
shankara

--

If one is blessed with devotion towards parameshwara it really
does not matter what birth one takes, be it a mosquito or worm.
This very beautifully highlighted by the verse in shivAnanda
laharI (by shrI shankara)


naratvaM devatvaM nagavanamR^igatvaM mashakataa
pashutvaM kiiTatvaM bhavatu vihagatvaadi jananam.h |
sadaa tvat.h paadaabja smaraNa paramaananda laharii
vihaaraasaktaM ched.hdhR^idayamiha kiM tena vapushhaa || 10 ||

What a boon it is to remember the lotus of feet of parameshwara
and be absorbed in that bliss.

Ravi
