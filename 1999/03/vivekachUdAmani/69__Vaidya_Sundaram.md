How  shall  I  cross  this ocean of samsAra? What is to be my fate? What are the
means?  I  know  nothing. O! great One! Save me by your grace. Vouch safe me the
liquidation of the sorrow of samsAra.

 How  shall  I  cross  this  ocean  of  samsAra beset with diverse isurmountable
afflictions.  If  it is to be like this for ever, what is to be my fate? What is
it  then that is to be attained  by me.? The idea is: if I am not save from this
ocean  of samsAra, what arre the means to be adopted? I do not know any thing by
myself.  I  am  terribly  afraid.  Pray save me. Completely uproot the sorrow of
samsAra  that  afflicts  me. Thus saying " samsArasukhaksatimAtanusva" the sisya
clearly prays for protection.

Chandrasekhara Bharati of Srngeri.


Pörnam adah` pörnam idam pörnaat pörnam udach`yaté |
Pörnasya pörnam ädaya pörnam éva avasish`yatè ||

The Absolute[adah] remains Perfect [poornam]as before, while the derivatives are
also Perfect [idam, poornam,]. Even though a Perfect is derived from the
original Whole, Perfect[poornasya, poornam, aadaya], the Original Perfect remain
Whole and Perfect.[poornam, eva, avasishyate.]
