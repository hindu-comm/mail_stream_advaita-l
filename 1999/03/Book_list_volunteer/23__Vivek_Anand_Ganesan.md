Hello all :
        Thanks to ShrI Ravi Mayavaram for following up on my earlier
suggestion. I have already indicated to him that I would love to
volunteer to compile a book list for advaita vedanta. I would like all
list members to respond to me about good advaita books. I propose to
do the following :

1) Compile a book list categorized as per beginner, intermediate and
advanced.

2) Publish the list on a web page ( definitely in the near future ).

        Please feel free to send your recommendations and suggestions to me
at this e-mail id( v_ganesan at yahoo.com ). I would appreciate it if you
could say something like "Book Recommedation" on the subject line.
Also, if possible, please specify the publisher and the Library of
Congress call number.

Thanks.

-Vivek Aanand Ganesan.
