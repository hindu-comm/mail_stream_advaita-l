Namaste

My name is Seshatre Natarajan and i have just started on my graduate
program in chemical engineering at Purdue University. I came to know of
the Advaita mailing list from my roommates here at Purdue who are also
members. I strongly beleive in the Advaita principle and have read a few
of Adi Sankara's and Paramacharya's works. Iam also interested in reading
and practicing the Bakthi marga through Naamasankirthan propounded by
many saints.
I hope to gain a lot of knowledge and insight into Advaita by joining this
group.

Thanks for including me in the list

Seshatre
