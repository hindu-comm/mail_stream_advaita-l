Subject: Introduction

Hello all,

I am Manjunatha Rao from Michigan Tech. I am presently doing my Masters in
Electrical Engineering. I am closely associated with Ramakrishna Math from
childhood. This is when I developed interest in Advaita. I have read the
Shankara Bhashya on Gita. I look forward to have good discussion on advaita
thru this mailing list.

Regards
Manjunath
