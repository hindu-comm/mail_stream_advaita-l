I have added shrI Govind Rengarajan to the admin of the list. His
e-mail addreess is grengar at hotmail.com. Starting from Jan 23rd
till Feb 25th, I will not be in a position to do the Admin jobs
of the list. During that period for any help please contact
Govind.

You can minimize the task of the administrator if you read the
welcome files the sent to by the Listserv and FAQ. Thank you for
your help.

You can also find a lot of help in

Special thanks to Govind for helping me out.


With best regards,
Ravi
