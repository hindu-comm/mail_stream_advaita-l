NamaskAram.

Check out http://sanskrit.gde.to/index.html It has several sanskrit
documents that you can download and print out; some of the documents come
with translations. There are also several links to sites to learn sanskrit
on the web.
 It also has the toTakAshTakam, with a brief history and translation.

Cheers,
vaidya.

This gross body is produced by one's karma in past life, out of the
elements which have  themselves  transformed, and is the instrument
of the  jiva's  experience.  That is its waking  state in  which it
experiences gross objects.  -- Adi Shankara in VivekacUdAmani.
