Hello.  I am a new member with a philosophical and a practical interest in
Advaita philosophy. My background is in yoga and meditation and the Jnana
path. My interest in yoga/meditation goes back 35 years when I was 7 years
old living in Amritsar, India. I was born in a Hindu family. I have studied
Hinduism, Jainism, Buddhism and Taoism and a little bit of Christianity. My
feeling is that great saints have manifested in virtually all spiritual
traditions. I am a devotee of Ramana Maharshi. It seems to me that Sri
Ramana has given the best practical approach to directly realizing that
Sat-Chit- Ananda is our original nature by teaching the path of
Self-Inquiry and Surrender to the Divine within. I am familiar with the
classical scriptures of Hinduism and those that emphasize the non dual
outlook. My B.A. was in Philosophy.
