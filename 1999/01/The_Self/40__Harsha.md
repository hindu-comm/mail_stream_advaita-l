Written some time ago but appropriate for this list:


Some say that Reality is Subjective, some say it is Objective and
some say it is both Objective and Subjective and some say it is neither.
Some say the Final State is that of Pure Existence, some say it is Only Pure
Non-Existence and some say It is beyond both Existence and
Non-Existence. No  matter how clever the terminology and how subtle the expression of the
experience of the Self, it misses the mark. It is because the Self has
no point of Reference in experience, being *It Self* the very Foundation on which
All experience appears to take place..

Harsha



Harsha :  I just came across a simple but beautiful passage (from Atma
Vidya...Sage of Arunachala). It states: "When you have not understood
yourself, what is the point in understanding other things? When you have
understood yourself, what else is there to understand?
