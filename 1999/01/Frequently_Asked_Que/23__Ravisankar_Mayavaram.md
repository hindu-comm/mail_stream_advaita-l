FAQ 1: What are the List policies?
----------------------------------------------------------------------

1) Advaita-L is a open, unmoderated list to discuss advaita-vedanta as
taught by shrI shankara. By advaita-vedanta, the tradition established
by shrI shankara and the maThas created to is referred.

2) Even though the major emphasis is on advaita-vedanta taught by shrI
shankara, topics related advaita-vedanta are welcome. Purpose of other
related articles should be to aid the understanding of advaita-vedanta.

3) Articles promoting bhakti within the framework of vedAnta are most
welcome.  The articles should be acceptable to the framework of
advaita-vedanta.  Even though advaita-vedanta holds that liberation
is through AtmajnAnam, bhakti is always emphasized.

4) Items 2 and 3 are vague, as the maintainer of the List, I reserve
the right on acceptability of articles. In the case the articles are
unacceptable, it will be informed in private and resolved in private.

5) Discussion of nAstika traditions and their philosophies are not
allowed. By nAstika traditions, I mean traditions like buddhism and
jainism. But scholarly articles comparing these traditions with
advaita-vedanta will be accepted. These articles should be sent to
the list manager (msr at tamu.edu) and not to the list.


6) Posters should not be disrespectful to towards saints and sages of
other traditions, and should show respect towards each other as well.
Avoid rude language. Repeated offensive postings will force me to set the
member's state to NOPOST. That will remove the privilege of directly
posting to the list and the such members should send their post to me
instead.

7) As the maintainer of this list, I reserve the final word on
critical issues like acceptablity of the articles and others
But I will not be autocratic, I will discuss the matter in private
with  knoweldgeable members of the list.  I will be open to
suggestions.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
FAQ 2: Where are the archives of the list? How can I access them

WWW interface. To do that point your Web browser to

The second method is to use the GET command. This method is very

The way the LIST has be set up is, if there are mail delivery
problems to your address, after the tolerance level, the List
Server software will automatically delete your name. The
tolerance level is: error for 40 consecutive messages or 4 days,
whichever happens first.

In case you are not receiving any mail for few days, please check
the Archive Web site. If the WWW site shows messages on those
days, please contact me, I will add you back to the list. This
has happened once or twice in the past.
