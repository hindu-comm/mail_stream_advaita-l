Yogamalika answers your questions on 'Samadhi'

1. Samadhi is defined as a state of absorption in any object.
   Generally, Samadhi is divided into Savikalpaka samadhi and Nirvikalpaka
   samadhi.

2. According to Vedanta, Samadhi belongs to the fourth state. Yoga
philosopher views it differently.

3. Samadhi can be attained by practicing Yama, Niyama etc of
Ashtaangayoga.

Note: According to Vedanta, Samadhi is not a means for liberation. Its
role in Vedanta before shravanam is for purity of mind and after shravanam
and mananam is useful for removing habitual error (vasana nivriti).
