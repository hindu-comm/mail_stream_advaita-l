Namaste
   I read in an article about the "three" states of consciousness -
waking, dreaming and deep sleep. Now where does the state of "Samadhi"
fit into all this ? Most importantly what exactly is "Samadhi" & how do
you realise it ??

   The reason I want this issue to be clarified is because I read in the
same article that "a saint is said to have reached the state of Samadhi,
when he becomes aware of the Atman residing within everyone and also
realizes this reality at all time, having no desires or ego". If this is
the case then why do we say that the saints like Shri Shankara, Shri
Ramana etc. attained Samadhi only when their soul became one with the
God ?? They realised the point mentioned above long before they attained
"Samadhi".

Your response is greatly appreciated.

Thanx
Dattatri
