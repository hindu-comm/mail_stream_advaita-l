Note: According to Vedanta, Samadhi is not a means for liberation. Its
role in Vedanta before shravanam is for purity of mind and after shravanam
and mananam is useful for removing habitual error (vasana nivriti).

 YOGAMALIKA

I thought that Samaadhi is a liberated state wherein union with the ONE
occurs. Of course, the Truth is seen from a preliminary to the "final"
state as Paramhamsa Yogananda has described in his Autobiography of a Yogi.
Any thoughts.

Ashish
