Due to some DNS problems, the Listserv having failed to deliver
the postings, thought the addresses were incorrect and deleted
most of them from the data base. Because of this, we had to
restore from a backup we had.

THERE WILL SOME INCONSISTENCIES
===============================

1) You might have subscribed in digest mode, and now may be
receiving in normal mode. I have changed for whom all we had
information. If we have not done for you, please either do it by
yourself or ask us.

2) You might have unsubscribed in the last 20+ days, and we could
have added you inadvertently. We are sorry. We will delete your
address, if can send us an e-mail.

3) If you are reading this from our WWW archives, you might
notice that you are not receiving posts from advaita-L, but some
how archives has the latest posts. This means, we have not added
you back. Please do contact us again, we will add you immediately
to the list database.

Again we are sorry for this error.

Sincerely,
Ravi
On behalf of admin team
