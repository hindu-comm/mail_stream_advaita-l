Just a quick clarification, in case I give the mistaken impression
that karma is not useful or necessary for the vast majority of people
(like me). The "shade" of becoming an ekadaNDin is not really a path
of comfort, unlike moving to the shade of a tree. The qualifications
for becoming an ekadaNDin should not be underestimated. Again, karma
is useless only for people with the right qualifications. The last
sentence is worth repeating many times.
