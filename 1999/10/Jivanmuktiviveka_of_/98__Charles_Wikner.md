    That man is called a (true) tridaNDin in whose mind
    these three, the control over his speech (vAgdaNDa),
    the control over his thoughts (manodaNDa), and the
    control over his body (kAyadaNDa), are firmly fixed.

                           Manu 12:10, tr. Georg Buhler.

The tapas relating to these three is discussed in gItA 17:14-16,
and the virAga view of these is given in 18:14-15.  Such vairAgya
is indeed "sharp".

Regards, Charles.
