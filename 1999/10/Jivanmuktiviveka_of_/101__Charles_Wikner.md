The difference is still not clear to me, despite your very
informative post -- for which I thank you.

Manu's definition of tridaNDin was offered as a possible
non-sectarian explanation for Vidyaranya's use of the word.
Whereas your point:

does not explain the use of the word in the text (to me at least).

In terms of the text, does that mean that (parama)haMsa-s are
ekadaNDin-s?

I follow the logic of that, for such complete vairAgya arises
only from direct Self-knowledge (YogasUtra 1.16).  But another
question arises here: what fills the "gap" between the life of
the gRhastha and that of the ekadaNDin?  The gRhastha is under
pressure from family/employer/customer to produce _results_,
which militates against vairAgya.  Practising the threefold tapas
(gItA 17:14-16) as best he can leads to unselfishness, but there
is still far too much rajas in his life to lead to "complete
vairAgya".  For that a more contemplative life is required:
vAnaprastha?

Is the tridaNDin here the same as vAnaprastha?  Is Vidyaranya
using the term saMnyAsa loosely to include vAnaprastha, whereas
you would restrict it to the ekadaNDin?

I am obviously not familiar with the tradition, so I would
appreciate being corrected.  (In fact, I have a particular
interest in vAnaprasta, with my worldly responsibilities
coming to an end in a few years.)

I would be more generous and say self-deluded: the "feel good"
high (pleasure) of "doing" good is taken for Ananda, and the
byproducts of fame and wealth reinforce the feeling.

This paragraph seems to express the central concern of your post.
Much dust was raised on this topic a few years ago, and led to
some members leaving the list; but, for all the smoke, some light
did get through (where there's smoke...).  My apologies to all if
my post appeared to be raising that ghost again: it was certainly
not my intention to do so -- hopefully it is laid to rest again.

Regards, Charles.
