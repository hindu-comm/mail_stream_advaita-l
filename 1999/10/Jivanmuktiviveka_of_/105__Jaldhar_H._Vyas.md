But remember Arjuna was also under pressure to produce results! :-)

The Vanaprastha Ashrama is rather ill-defined compared to the others.  I
was not able to find out much about it.  But in contemporary Hindu society
there is the informal idea that one should gradually withdraw from public
life, handing over responsibilities to children etc and take up more
religious and specifically austere practices.

a sannyasi.  Advaita authors such as Swami Vidyaranya consider
them inferior to "real" sannyasis though.
