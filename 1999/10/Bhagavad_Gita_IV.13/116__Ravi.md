namaste Ashish:

Can you post the svAmiji's reply (if he has not prohibited your from
doing so)?

Can you give me  a pointer to the source of this incident? I do not
remember reading it mAdhava-vidyAraNya's shankara dig vijaya. I might
have missed it. I should read it one more time carefully.

Thank you.

Sincerely,
Ravi

You are absolutely correct. There is no rule that the fourth follows
the third. sannyAsa may be taken up at any point of time, if the right
qualifications are present. The jAbAla is very clear on this. Please
look it up. I also posted this passage a long time back in the list.

Strictly speaking no. The jAbAla says once the correct vairAgya is
reached one may take up sannyAsa, whether or not "duties" have been
discharged. However, usually the premission of the wife/parents is
taken before taking up sannyAsa, due to the structure of society. Even
Sureshvara mentions that the husband takes the permission of the wife,
when describing the procedure for sannyAsa in the bR^ihad-vArtika. I
don't have the verse in memory. I can look it up if there is any
interest.

In Sringeri, the presiding AchArya writes to the parents of the
successor informing them of his intention. Usually, there is no
objection. But in the case of the Sri Chandrashekhara Bharati
Mahaswami, his mother refused to give her consent, because he was the
only child. The Mahaswami reportedly told her that he would become a
sannyAsi anyway. If she gave permission, he'd at least be in Sringeri,
and she could see him often. After that his mother apparently
reluctantly agreed. But, it does seem standard procedure to get
permission from the parents/wife.

Rama
