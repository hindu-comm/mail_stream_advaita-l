He thought that my question was in terms of time and place and hence that
our new varna and ashram dharma would be to serve the Hindu society in this

dharma. I did not press him any further.

If I recall correctly (I will check tonight), Swami Vivekananda makes a
reference to it in one of his lectures in the book "Lectures from Colombo to
Almora".
