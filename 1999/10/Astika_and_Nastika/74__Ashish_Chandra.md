Namaste All,

I am trying to find out the differences between the Astika traditions and
Nastika ones.

The question I have is this :

While both Purva Mimamsa and Vedanta consider Sruti as Pramana, the other
Astika ones don't always take this line. AFAIK, the Nastika traditions such
as Buddhism draws heavily from the Upanishads but rejects the Karma Kand.
Also, they (Buddhists) don't consider the Sruti to be Pramana. But neither
do schools such as Sankhya. So why is one considered Nastika and the other
Astika when both draw from Sruti but don't consider it to be Pramana?

If there is link to this in the archives, I would much appreciate it.

ashish
