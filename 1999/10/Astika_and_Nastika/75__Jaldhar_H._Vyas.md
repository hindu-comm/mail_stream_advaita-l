Basically there are three questions

1.  Does the soul (atma) exist?
2.  Is there a God?
3.  Are the Vedas and their ancillary shastras authoritative?

Those who say "asti" (it is so) to these are astikas and those who say no
to one or more are nastikas.

By definition they do (see 3. above) but sometimes for radically different
reasons.

You are probably right but Buddhists themselves might object to such a
contention.

We have no evidence that in their daily lives Buddhists didn't behave
exactly the same as everyone else around them.  Philosophically they
rejected the entire Veda.

Samkya/Yoga does consider Shruti to be a pramana but for different
reasons. For them, the Vedas are the recorded experiences of omniescent
Yogis of the past.  This gives them their authority.  While for
Mimamsa/Vedanta, the Vedas are anauthored and completely impersonal.  In
Nyaya/Vaisheshika, The authority of the Vedas stems from them having been
written by God who is perfectly knowledgeable.
