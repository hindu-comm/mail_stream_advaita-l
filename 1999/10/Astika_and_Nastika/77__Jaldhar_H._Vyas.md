Instead of the Rshis being important because they saw the Shruti, in
Samkhya the Shruti is important because it was seen by the Rshis.

The Mimamsakas based much of their philosophy on the theory of karma.
Thus they objected in the main to the idea of a God who could interfere
and "tip the balance" towards His favorites or enemies.  But they didn't
object to the idea of a God who impartially metes out papa and punya based
on the each jivas fitness to receive it.  And this is in fact the position
that Advaita Vedanta takes.

Similiarly Samkhya was uncomfortable with the idea of a God who involved
himself with creation etc.  But it was ok if He was defined as the
external Observer of creation.  And in fact Yoga is just Samkhya +
Ishwara.

Well if the accounts in works like sarvadarshansamgraha are to be believed
they rejected everything including the very idea of Astika and Nastika.
