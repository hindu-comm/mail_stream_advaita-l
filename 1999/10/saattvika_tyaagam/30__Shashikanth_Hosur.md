I believe there is a difference between Guru and teacher or scholar.
Generally we use the word Guru  to imply a scholar.  According to our
tradition Guru is one who is established in the supreme truth and has the
capacity to elimate the ignorance in a disciple who has surrendered to him
and lead him to the realize the utlimate goal of life.

Sri RamanujaCharya's teacher was a reknowned scholar in advaita vedanta by
name yadava praskash - under whom he was learning the shastras and advaita
vedanta.  Among his Gurus were Tiruk kachi Nambi,Periya Nambi ,Tiruk
Koshtiyur Nambi - who can be called Gurus as they had understood the essence
of the vedas and were established in the Sumpreme truth.
Thats the reason whu his teacher yadava prakash became his disciple.
Guru is a infinitely compassionate and in fact the Para bramhan in human
form.  Sr Yadava Prakash does not meet any of the qualifications of a Guru
given in the scriptures.  Cuurently the word guru is used in several
contexts.
