I'm sure Shri Ramaswamy can shed more light on this but I believe the
Ramanuja is considered the greatest exponent of Vishistadvaita but not its
founder and he had contact with earlier teachers of that tradition as well
as his Advaita teacher.

Personally I think anyone who goes against his Guru is commiting a grave
sin but no doubt Ramanuja had his reasons for doing what he did.  But even
though it may disagree with the Smarta sampradaya on important subjects,
Shri sampradaya and other astika sampradayas share a lot in common.  They
all base their stand on Brahma sutras, Gita, and Upanishads etc.  It's
only in the South of India there is such sharp seperation between the
sampradayas it seems.  My first teacher belongs to Swaminarayana
sampradaya which accepts the Shribashya as it's philosophical base (and he
worships Ganapati Bhagawan as his ishtadevata) and I didn't have any
problems with learning from him.  This is quite normal in our neck of the
woods.
