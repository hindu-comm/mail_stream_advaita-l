If you mean the Ishvara is unaffected by the jiiva's karma, don't you think
that's obvious: one cannot freely sin and then simply say the actions were
God's! Well...one can say so, but it wouldn't be true :-)

But if you mean advaitins are in agreement with the statement "Isvara never
does anything" when you say that "Ishvara is never the doer," then the
statement is in error.

The jiiva acts under the spell of avidya. The Ishvara MUST also act in order
to maintain the jiiva.

Quote from the BG (3.22) (translation by A.G.Krishna Warrier)
----------
"I have, Arjuna! no duty whatsoever to discharge in all the three worlds;
there is nothing I have not won, and nothing remains to be won by Me; still
I ceaselessly work."

Shankara's commentary: In all the three worlds, Arjuna! no duty whatsoever
exists for me to discharge. Why? There is nothing unobtained and nothing yet
to be obtained, by Me. Nevertheless I ceaselessly work.
----------

Better is BG (3.24):
----------
"If I don't work the worlds will perish; I may cause confusion, and may ruin
these living beings."

Shankara's commentary: If I work not, all the worlds 'will perish' -- will
be ruined, in the absence of the work that maintains their equilibrium.
Also, I shall cause confusion, and thus destroy these living beings. Seeking
to confer a blessing on them, I might work their ruin. It will ill accord
with My character as God.
----------

The last line of Shankara is "Ishvarasya ananuruupaM aapadyeta." An Ishvara
who doesn't work towards the well-being of the jiivas is no iishvara at all.

Well, there are great minds in other traditions too. And tradition is for
Man, not Man for tradition. One ought to choose whatever helps one the most.
If there is something in a tradition that is good for a certain person,
he/she could/should take it up whole-heartedly, IMO.
