I request the new members to

1) Go through the archives, many valuable discussions have
happened in the past and also many useful series has been posted
in the last 3 1/2 years.

You can locate the archives at

http://www.advaita-vedanta.org/

and in searchable form in

http://www.escribe.com/religion/advaita


2) If someone feels the list is going out of scope, and certain
things should not be discussed please write to the list
administrators (we can be reached by sending an e-mail to
listmaster at advaita-vedanta.org). DO NOT SEND THAT TO THE LIST
ITSELF.

3) Also if you are offended by certain posts/comments send your
comments to us and NOT to the list.

4) If you think the list goals are not meeting your needs, I
think you should seriously think about joining other
mailing-lists. There are specific lists in http://www.onelist.com
which discuss teaching of bhagavan shrI ramakrishna paramahansa,
viveknanda, etc. They may be able to help you.

Thank you.

Sincerely,
Ravi

On behalf of the list adminstrators.
