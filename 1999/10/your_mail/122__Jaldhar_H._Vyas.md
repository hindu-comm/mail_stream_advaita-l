The only reason the subject has come is because of extravagent claims from
his followers.  If you or other list members have benefited from his
teachings, then good for you.  Personally, I'm happy when knowledge is
increased and ignorance is decreased whatever the method.  It's the
propoganda I find annoying.

Then his would-be shishyas should stop treating him like one then.

The same ones which were dead and gone?  If the quote presented was
incorrect, I take back everything i've said.  If it is true then it
deserves to be criticised.

The only slave and moribund nation was the colonial babu class and they
sold themselves into slavery so they don't deserve a lot of sympathy from
us.

The common man never gave (and doesn't give) a damn about foreigners and
what they thought.  The common man didn't need rescuing, a tiny
westernized elite did.

Then perhaps we are not listening very hard?  In Gujarat, the Akshar
Purushottam Swaminarayana Sanstha, one of the leading Vaishnava sects is
at the forefront of drought relief, medical care, etc..  They help
thousands of people without compromising the least bit in strict obsevence
of Dharma.  They know Naraseva is a complement to Narayanaseva not a
replacement for it.  That's why I regularly donate to their campaigns even
though I don't believe in all aspects of their religion.  On the other
hand, the RK mission don't appear to be doing anything.  But I'll take
your word for it.  If they are doing good things for people then they
deserve that much praise but let's keep things in proportion shall we?
