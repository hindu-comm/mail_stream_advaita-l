viShNuH:

When the question arises who is it that has become viShvam, the All, the
answer is given that it is viShNu. As he pervades everything, veveshti,
He is called viShNu. The term viShNu is derived from the root viSh
(indicating presence everywhere) combined with the suffix nuk.  So the
viShNu purANa says:

yasmAd viShtam idam sarvam tasya shaktyA mahAtmanaH
tasmAd evocyate viShNur visher dAtoH praveshanAt

"The power of that supreme being has entered within the universe." The
root viSh means 'enter into'.

The following Rig vedic mantra also advocates the adoration of viShNu
for the attainment of spiritual enlightenment:

tamu stotAraH pUrvyam yathAvida
R^itasya garbham janushA pipartana
Asya jAnanto nAma cidviviktana
mahas te viShNo sumantim bhajAmahe

It means: O hymnists! put an end to your recurring births by attaining
the real knowledge of that ancient being who is eternal and true.
Understanding these names of viShNu, repeat them always.  Let the others
repeat or not repeat Thy holy names: we, O viShNu, shall adore Thy
charming effulgence.
