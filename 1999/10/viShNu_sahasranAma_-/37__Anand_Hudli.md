 This particular mantra from the R^ig Veda (MaNDala 1) is the basis
 of the various "nAma-sankIrtana" movements. Chanting the names of
 God, therefore, plays a key role in worship. This mantra validates
 the efficacy of various sahasra-nAma's, ashhTottara's, etc. of deities.

 For comparison, also see the mantra of the R^ig Vedic version of the
 Rudram, 2.33.8, which says "namasyA kalmalIkinaM namobhir.h gR^iNImasi
 tveshhaM rudrasya nAma" , adoring the God who destroys sins with
 obeisances, we chant the illustrious names of Rudra!"
