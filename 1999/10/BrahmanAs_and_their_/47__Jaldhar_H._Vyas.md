I have had the privilege to know mahatmas like this too.  For instance the
person who performed my yagnopavit, Shri Jagannath Shastriji had
opportunities to become quite well off but refused them because he felt it
would interfere with his true vocation.  But cases like mine are more
typical.  the surname Vyas indicates a kathakar of Mahabharata, Bhagavata
etc.  And several of my ancestors did just that.  However at least since
the mid-18th century, they have mainly been employed as teachers and minor
bureaucrats.  Undoubtedly, the political situation had a big part to play
in this.  The Kathiawad region of Gujarat where we are from was divided
into no less 202 little kingdoms and there was constant turmoil.  In
constrast the South was much more peaceful and prosperous.  Yet even
there, isn't it true thre is a distinction between Vaidiks who are engaged
in  Brahmakarma full time and Niyogis who combind it with some secular
job?

Everyone--not just Brahmanas should endeavor to know their Dharma and
practice it to the best of their ability.  It may not be easy, conditions
may not always be ideal, but if we try Bhagawan will forgive us any
imperfections.  But if we despair and decide it is to difficult to even
try, where will it leave us?
