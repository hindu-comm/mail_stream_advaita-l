  Also, I have heard from elders that another hall mark feature of
Brahmanism was poverty.  Southern Brahmins are more orthoprax ( maybe
due to lack of "foreign" influences like muslim rule, especially in the
deep south ).  And as far as I know, very few Southern brahmins were
prosperous ( I believe this is not the case up north ).

   What I was told was that the accumulation of wealth and the
accumulation of wisdom cannot be contemparenous.  In literal terms, "it
is like putting a car in reverse gear and expecting it to go forward".
I believe even the AchAryas have said that active pursuit of wealth is
not a brahmanical virtue.  I would like to know what the list members
feel about this issue.

Thanks,

-Vivek.
