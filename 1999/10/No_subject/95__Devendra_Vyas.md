dear vaidya,
             i have had my say and have also heard the voice of all the
esteemed members.i have already clarified that i was not against discussing
karma,it is obvious that karma is the means to an end and not an end in
itself;i only wanted to stress the point that we should endeavour to keep
the final end in view rather than get caught in endless discussions on the
means.i hope no one takes any offence at my well meaning observations.thank
you all for a very lively debate.-devendra.
