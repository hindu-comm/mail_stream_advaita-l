If you take the trouble to examine what all the great teachers of Advaita
Vedanta have said on the matter from Krishna Bhagawan in the
Gita, to Shankaracharya to Shri Vidyaranya to the present day, they have
unequivocally stated that karma and jnana are 100% incompatible.  If one
wishes to follow the jnaana marga, one must, not should, must renounce
this world.  It is only they who are beyond and thus can afford to ignore
Karma.  For all others (and this includes the vast majority of members of
this list) doing ones duty is of paramount importance and one cannot
wriggle out of it by claiming to be a jnani anymore than Arjuna could
wriggle out of doing his duty by claiming to be a vairagi.

Not only is there no harm, there is benefit in understanding and
practicing ones Dharma.  It is adharma and inaction which are the cause
of harm.

It is your understanding of Advaita Vedanta and its scope which needs
revision.  No true Advaitin would ever object to discussion and practice
of karmayoga by those who are qualified for it and none ever have.

When you joined the list, you were given an introductory welcome message
that explained what the list was about.  If you have some contribution you
can make which is on-topic for this list, please do so.  You needn't wait
for anyone.
