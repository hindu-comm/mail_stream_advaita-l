I'm sorry Mr Jaldhar !
It all initiated by me.

I was very new and had very bad experience of one such list.
So I wrote about "Futile Debates" in my introduction.

But One thing I strongly feel is, the course Of "Niti" and "Kartavyas"
always change with time.
We are supposed to understand the essence of them and go ahead with
implementing it in our own way.

So it does not matter if You Do "Agnihotra" before lunch or not but
The concept of purity of food is important.

I think when my friend Devendra says Not to discuss Karma he must have meant
it this way.

Regards
Anand.

                If you take the trouble to examine what all the great
teachers of Advaita
                Vedanta have said on the matter from Krishna Bhagawan in the
                Gita, to Shankaracharya to Shri Vidyaranya to the present
day, they have
                unequivocally stated that karma and jnana are 100%
incompatible.  If one
                wishes to follow the jnaana marga, one must, not should,
must renounce
                this world.  It is only they who are beyond and thus can
afford to ignore
                Karma.  For all others (and this includes the vast majority
of members of
                this list) doing ones duty is of paramount importance and
one cannot
                wriggle out of it by claiming to be a jnani anymore than
Arjuna could
                wriggle out of doing his duty by claiming to be a vairagi.

                Not only is there no harm, there is benefit in understanding
and
                practicing ones Dharma.  It is adharma and inaction which
are the cause
                of harm.

                It is your understanding of Advaita Vedanta and its scope
which needs
                revision.  No true Advaitin would ever object to discussion
and practice
                of karmayoga by those who are qualified for it and none ever
have.

                When you joined the list, you were given an introductory
welcome message
                that explained what the list was about.  If you have some
contribution you
                can make which is on-topic for this list, please do so.  You
needn't wait
                for anyone.
