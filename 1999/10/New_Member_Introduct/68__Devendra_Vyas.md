who's afraid of debates?no one.but,please let us have enriching
,enlightening debates.let us concentrate more on the jnana-kanda rather than
the karma-kanda.let us have more debates on the core of
advaita-vedanta,viz.,:
1.upanishads.
2.brahma-sutras.
3.bhagavad-gita.
and also,the many commentaries and works of
sankara,gaudapada-karika..etc.let us have debates on the lives and teachings
of many present age advaitins:sri ramakrishna paramhansa,swami.vivekananda,
sri ramana maharishi,swami. sivananda,swami.chinmayananda,sri nisargadatta
maharaj...etc.let us have discussions on the lives of the innumerable saints
and men of realization that the world has produced(indeed why should we
limit 'advaita' which indicates to us the limitless?):thomas'a
kempis,st.francis of assisi,sant jnanesvar,
namdeo,eknath,kabir...etc.let us view advaita in the light of western
philosophy:kant,schopenhaeur,whitehead, ... and also modern science and
quantum theory(also view them in the light of the advaita).indeed if we are
convinced about the glory of advaita we have nothing to fear ,all broad and
panoramic debates of advaita in any context will only reveal to us the glory
of advaita all the more.please let us not get trapped in debates related to
'shika' and the like.if my frank opinions upset any one i am willing to
leave the list.
by the way,let us be thankful to anand hari ghalsasi who started this
churning by his frank and forthright comments.-devendra.
