You have only scratched the surface of Advaita Vedanta.  There are often
very good reasons for what seems like "futile debates and propoganda" and
you should investigate more deeply before dismissing such activities out
of hand.

Experiences can be misleading.  By themselves they mean nothing.  It is
only through using our mental powers we can make sense of our experiences
and that requires debates.  But hopefully not futile ones.
