Please note that I never opposed the idea of debates/discussions. Infact
"vAda" or discussion is the lifebreath of philosophy and a prominent feature
of the Indian tradition. Please discuss/debate/ask questions relating to
Advaitam, as much as you wish. That to a great extent dispels our ignorance.

My point was only that the karma kAndam should not be ignored. That's as
essential as the jnAna kAndam. There've been phases in Indian history, due
to certain circumstances (like during the time of Islamic occupation,
holding on to our culture and tradition itself required great effort), that
karma kAndam had taken precedence over jnAna kAndam and the latter has even
been forgotten. Generally these are the times when great saints have
appeared and made it clear to the people that karma has no end in itself and
the ultimate end is jnAnam - knowledge of the Self. But that doesn't mean
that they denied the efficacy of karma - for all saints enjoin charity,
control and compassion - but just denied it ultimate value. The Buddha and
Vivekananda fall in this category.
