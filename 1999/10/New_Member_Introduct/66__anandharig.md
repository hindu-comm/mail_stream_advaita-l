As can be seen from my mail I'm only reluctant to Futile debates sir.
Futile in my interpretation means resulting in nothing.
Otherwise it's well known fact that " VAde VAde Jayate TatvaBodhaha "

So Let's have such debates which finally will help us to Discover the truth,
"Brahma" !

Anand.

                You have only scratched the surface of Advaita Vedanta.
There are often
                very good reasons for what seems like "futile debates and
propoganda" and
                you should investigate more deeply before dismissing such
activities out
                of hand.

                Experiences can be misleading.  By themselves they mean
nothing.  It is
                only through using our mental powers we can make sense of
our experiences
                and that requires debates.  But hopefully not futile ones.
