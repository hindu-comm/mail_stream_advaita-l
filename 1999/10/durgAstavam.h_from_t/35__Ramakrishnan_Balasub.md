arjuna-kR^ita durgAstavam.h:

This is one of my personal favorites right from my childhood
days. Since navarAtri starts today (at least in India), I
thought I'd post this. This stotram is found in many
recensions of the mahAbharatam, in the virATa parvam.h, but
has not been included in the critical edition prepared by the
BORI. Jan Gonda says there are many versions of this stavam.h
(Refer, J.Gonda, "Medieval Religious Literature in Sanskrit,"
A History of Indian Literature, Vol II, Fasc. 1, Otto
Harrasowitz.Wiesbaden, 1977). The version I give is found in
the southern recension of the mahAbhAratam.h. It was recited
by arjuna on the order of bhagavAn kR^ishhNa, in order to
secure victory in the great battle. The stotram is credited
with the power of bestowing destruction of enemies and a long
healthy life in the phalashruti. It is traditionally held that
the stotram also bestows self-control, which is essential for
Atma-GYana. No translation is provided since the Sanskrit is
very simple. Some other durgA-stotram-s can be found in:
