Came across these quotes in a newspaper :

                Whatever is here, that is there.
                What is there, that again is here.
                He obtains death after death
                Who seems to see a difference here.

                Katha Upanishad


                Yonder world is in the likeness of this world,
                this world is the likeness of that

                Attareya Brahmana


                There is on earth no (radical) diversity.
                He gets death after death,
                Who perceives here seeming diversity.
                As a unity only is It to be looked upon --
                This indemonstrable, enduring Being.

                Brihad-Aranyaka Upanishad


The above quotes show amazing similarity to NAgArjuna's views on the
ultimate reality (though 'being' would not be acceptable to him). Might have
actually been his source too. That's another blow to the "prachanna
bauddham" claim against Advaitam.

And Anand maybe you should review your stand regarding the literal
interpretation of the illusory nature of the world in Advaitam :-)
