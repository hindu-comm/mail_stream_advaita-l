Here is my introduction

Namaste,

Thanks for enrolling me in the list.  I am an engineering working in the
US.I am not very knowledgeable in the philosophy of Advaita Vedanta and
would like to have the opportunity of interacting with people who know about
this and can shed some light on similar topics. I have been involved with
Chinmaya Mission where we had discussions on the Bhagavada Gita.

Hari Om.

Arun
