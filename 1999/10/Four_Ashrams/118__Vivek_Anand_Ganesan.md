Thanks to ShrI Ramakrishnan for his answer to my previous question.

In pursuance to the previous topic, I would like to ask some questions
about the four Ashrams.

a) What marks the transition between GrihashAshram and VanAshram?
   ( I hope I spelled them right ).
   The transition between BrahmachAryam and GrihashAshram seems to be
   marraige.  But, the transition between the next two is not quite
   clear ( to me ).  When and how does this take place?

b) Also, I have heard very little mention of VanAshram.
   What is the purpose of this Ashram?

Thanks,

-Vivek.
