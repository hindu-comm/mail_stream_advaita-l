Yes scientific knowledge is also passed from generation to generation, but
it is verified at every step by experiment.  Even if one has learned all
there is about physics from a teacher of the highest calibre, if one does
an experiment that falsifies that, it has to be cast aside.  Antiquity has
no bearing on the matter.  Of course this is an ideal and scientists have
not always lived up to this but they try.

By tradition I mean an approach which is different.  It accumulates
information over time and values it for its longevity.

Let us pose the same questions to the National Basketball Association.
Oops it looks they also fail the test.  There is nothing in the rulebooks
about any of these subjects.  And generations of players, coaches, and
referees have failed to say anything either.  Does this mean you cannot be
a astika and a basketball player?  There is no way you can go up against
the Chicago Bulls armed with a copy of the Bhagavad Gita without facing a
very big problem! :-)

It is more correct to say science gives a resounding "Don't care" to those
questions.  For exactly the same reason science won't call itself astika,
it will refuse to call itself nastika too.  After all, you can't prove
something without evidence but you can't disprove it without evidence
either.

Dharma is matter of action not belief.  One becomes/stays a Brahmana by
being born, in a Brahmana family, getting yagnopavit, doing vedadhyayana,
sandhyavandana etc.  This is why in the Advaita tradition, sannyasis do
not have shikha, yagnopavit and other symbols of their purvashram.  These
are emblems of karma.

Now when you talk about atmavichara and moksha then you come into the
realm of belief.  But when you talk about the uses of science as opposed
to scientific facts, you are also moving beyond logic into the realm of
belief.  Take nuclear power.  It can be used for the good of generating
electric power or the evil of mass destruction. Which is more scientific?
Is it biting the hand of science to prefer one over the other?  We have to
go beyond science to determine this.

(Is receiving alms incompatible with science?  Physicists could be said to
subsist almost entirely on them in the form of grants.)  Throughout
recorded history Brahmanas have had other occupations to materially
sustain themselves.  Yet side by side they also practiced their spiritual
duties.  Modern times haven't really changed anything in this regard.

Well, I don't know about anyone else, but in school I did experiments in
science class and this is what convinced me of the validity of science.
If someone just came up to me and said "this is scientific, so this is
right" I would demand some kind of proof or I would ignore it.

If they can indeed do this, yes.  But in practice I don't see very much in
any of the philosophies you mention that does map to "the truths of
Advaita Vedanta."

Yes and this is why we cannot speak of the "scientific tradition" in any
unitary way.  It's own members do not agree on any but the most basic of
philosophical positions.  Whereas an Advaitin of 2000 AD and 2000 BC would
have a great deal more in common.  Yes there is a particular materialistic
worldview which is based on the implications of science but itself it is
no more scientific than any other.  For that matter there was the charvaka
view in ancient times.  Science seems for compelling as a philosophical
base now than it was in those days but the underlying issues are exactly
the same.  If people managed to combine both in those days, there is no
reason why we cannot do so today.
