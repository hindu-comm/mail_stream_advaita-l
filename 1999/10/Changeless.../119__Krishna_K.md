Hello,

I have a question based on the following premises of Advaita -

1. Only Brahman is true. Time is a vyaharika entity, which in the 'final'
analysis is unreal.
2. Brahman is changeless.

To say that something is changeless, the normal procedure that I know is to
record the initial and final state and the lack of difference therein;
between not just the two end states, but all the infinite intermediate
states. but this procedure, like other vyaharika entities, presupposes Time
- which is not real.
So, on what basis does one say that the only paramarthika entity, Brahman is
changeless?

Krishna
