What is advaita-vedanta's stand on this issues? Please do explain if
you know. Thanks"

I do not know anything about advaita-vedanta's stand on these issues and I am
eager to learn.

But I have learned something about these from Kalakshepams while in India.
May be, this will be of interest to you.

You may kindly browse www.srivaishnava.org/sgati (specially, the
Pre-SaraNAgathi (SDDS) issues Volume 01.001 to 01.0018 in which the subject
of SaraNAgathi has been discussed in detail based on Srimad Rahasya Traya
Saram of SwAmi vEdAnta DEsika (being excerpts from my book "Hinduism
Rediscovered").
