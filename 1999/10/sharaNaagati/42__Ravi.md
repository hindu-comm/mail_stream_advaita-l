daivii hyeshhaa guNamayii mama maayaa duratyayaa |

There are few places in giitaa, bhagavan says surrendering to him is
the
way to overcome/cross the delusive power of his mAyA.


1) What is meant by sharaNagati or prapatti?

2) How does one surrender?

3) How does one know that refuge has been granted?

4) How does one behave/live after surrendering?

What is advaita-vedanta's stand on this issues? Please do explain if
you know. Thanks.

Please do not let my reply intrude, as I am neither a scholar nor a
scientist-- I mean only to offer an opinion: it seems to me this is not
about the Moon in the sky, but about the mind, and now it is darkened from
spiritual wisdom, temporarily, by the serpents of ego/desire.
