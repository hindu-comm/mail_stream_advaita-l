Namaste all,
  I am a novice to Advaita vedanta but would like to learn more. I have more
queries than answers so maybe i can post my questions to the group. I am not
sure if i can ask too general questions like 'what is the essential
difference between man & other living beings & what does advaita-vedanta say
about this?',etc. Thank you for admitting ...
  with regards,
  Sanjay
