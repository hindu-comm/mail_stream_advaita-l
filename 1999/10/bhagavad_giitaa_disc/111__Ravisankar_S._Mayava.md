Please note that shrI Vidyasankar Sundaresan is discussing
bhagavad-giita based on bhagavaan shrii shankara's bhaaShyam. I
would like the new members to take up discussion on what he has
already posted.

He has already posted the shankara bhAshyam for many verses in
Chapter II. You can locate them in archives. I would prefer that
we go along with his discussion and ask questions when doubt
arises and give some clarifications if they are not adequately
explained.


If you want to take up something new on your own, please start
brahma suutra bhaaShyam of shrii shankara or some other work by
shrii shankara (say a bhAshyam to one of the principal
upanishad-s).


Thank you.

Sincerely,
Ravi
