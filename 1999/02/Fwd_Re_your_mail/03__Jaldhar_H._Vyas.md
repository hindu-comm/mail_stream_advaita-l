I'm sure you will find this list quite helpful.  But you are actually in a
great position to learn (better than me!) as you are in Bangalore which is
home to many great scholars.  I believe the Shringeri Mathas pathashala is
also there.  So if you get in touch with someone like that, you will get
the required background in no time.
