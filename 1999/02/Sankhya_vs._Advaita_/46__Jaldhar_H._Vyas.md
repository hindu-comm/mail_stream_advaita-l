Yes but Purush in Samkhya is also Asti.  Perhaps there are some variants
of Vedanta which can accept two Astis.  Advaita Vedanta cannot for reasons
which should be obvious.

Samkhya does not think there is a thing that disturbs existence.  It says
existence itself has the quality of change.  Advaita Vedanta on the other
hand says that it is Avidya which "causes" Maya.  Unlike Prakriti, neither
Avidya or Maya are unreal.

It never was illusion except in the misinterpretations of witless
translators.

Rather the world as it appears to be.

The Sanskrit word prana means breath or vital force. It is a huge leap
from there to energy or matter.

But Shankaracharya will also say even if the ultimate is (ultimately :-)
beyond words and thoughts it can only be approached through words and
thoughts.  So far in your presentation Samkhya seems only to be offering
vague words based on unfounded thoughts.  It is right to question that.

What comes out for me is that spirituality that is not accompanied by
viveka is vacuous.

You have never met Maharshi Kapila or for that manner Vivekananda.  Yet
you seem to readily accept someone elses word that they did actually teach
what you think they taught. You are no less dogmatic than I am.  You just
have different dogmas.

Certainly He made a contribution.  Later on most of that contribution was
rejected.  Today there are many Vedantins of various outlooks.  There are
next to no adherents of Samkhya.
