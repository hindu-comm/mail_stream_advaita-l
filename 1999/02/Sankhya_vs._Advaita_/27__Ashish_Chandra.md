Namaskaar All,

I was reading about Samkhya a couple of days ago and from a cursory
reading (have to admit it was an online source with a bare description),
I found a lot of similarities between the Maya as Sri Sankara has
described the world and Prakriti, as Sage Kapila has described it. The
same goes for Purusha vs. Brahma. Pardon my ignorance but can anyone
describe to me the basic differences ?

Thanks
Ashish
