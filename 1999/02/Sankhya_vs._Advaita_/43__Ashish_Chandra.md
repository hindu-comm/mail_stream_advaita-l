I thought that Advaita stems from expositions like Neti Neti, Aham Brahmasmi and
Soaham etc. Sri Shankara was the most brilliant philosopher that the world has
ever seen but how can one make a statment like Advaita *is defined by* Sri
Shankara's writings. His interpreted the Shrutis too. It might be the case that
his methodical and piercing approach is not visible, or available, in writings
prior to his coming.

Is it correct that if someone were to write Bhashyas on certain Upanishads and
Brahma Sootra, that would also be considered Advaitam, if the sections of these
texts were to be interpreted in the light of the concept of Brahma in the
Upanishads ?

To what is the nature of the relationship of Swami Vivekananda to Advaita been
ascribed to as being tenous ?
