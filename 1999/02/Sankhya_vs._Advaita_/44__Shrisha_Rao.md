Quite right, but that supports my point and does not invalidate it.  If,
as accepted by you, Sri Shankara's writings present Advaita clearly for
the first time in living memory although the concepts presented are not
his inventions, then too we must say that his writings, and those not in
contravention of them, are the real presentations of Advaita.

No, not necessarily, because there is no unanimity in respect of the
concept of Brahman, and dualistic interpretations are possible.  If
youwould consider Sri Shankara's non-dualistic view of Brahman as
canonical, and then ask if other presentations that accept the same view
of Brahman are also as authoritative in presenting Advaita, then too it
must be urged that you yourself place the original texts, which you
consider a canonical benchmark, at a higher plank than any latter-day
ones.

Simply this -- he did not have a classical education in the doctrine, and
did not necessarily adhere to its precepts in his own writings.  (In the
sense that such adherence must not be casual, for a classicist, but must
be overt and painstaking, as seen in scholars coming from the mainstream.)
