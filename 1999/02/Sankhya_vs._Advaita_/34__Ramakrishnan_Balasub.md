What is this supposed to mean? If I look at you and say you are human
being and some other guy comes and looks at you and says that you are
a tiger, does that make both of them right?

"adjustments"??!!

This is completely incorrect.

Whenever I read a Dortmunder novel by Donald Westlake I get a thrill
too.

?!!! Sha.nkara ridicules this kind of sentimentalistic regard of
kapila explicitly.  As a pUrva-paxa argument he states that kapila is
held as a revered sage in some smr^iti texts and hence sA.nkhya cannot
be incorrect. He basically laughs at this and says there is no proof
that it could not have been some other person named kapila.
