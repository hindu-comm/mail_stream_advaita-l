And you call that a minor difference???

Highly debatable.  In fact you would be hard put to say it was the first
rational philosophy India ever produced.  Mimamsa (of which Vedanta is a
part) can make an equal claim to antiquity.

For Yoga, yes.  Essentially Yoga is just Samkhya with Ishvara as an extra
tattva.  Vedanta is different.  A thorough glance would I believe suggest
only a superficial debt to Samkhya and I suspect that is more due to their
common basis in Vedic and Puranic texts rather than any actual borrowing.

Absolutely not.  See my reply to Ashish.

Perhaps if you read Advaita texts while sitting in a rollercoaster you
would get a similar thrill?

As described in the Bhagavata Purana for instance.  Now this raises an
interesting point. What do we mean by Samkhya?  In it's earliest forms,
before it became a systemized form of philosophy, Samkhya merely meant an
an attitude to philosophy, "theory" (as opposed to Yoga or "practice")
rather than an actual set of doctrines.  This kind of Samkhya is found in
the Mahabharata and Puranas, Ayurvedic texts and even the Arthashastra. In
the same way Mimamsa is used in early texts to simply mean "exegesis" and
doesn't necessarily imply the full-blown teachings of a Shankaracharya or
Kumarila Bhatta.

Then there is the "classical" Samkhya of Ishvarakrishna's Samkhyakarikas
and the commentaries thereon.  This is the "rational philosophy" you are
talking about and the one Shankaracharya is criticizing.

Thirdly much later there was a movement to combine Samkhya with Vedanta.
Vijnanabhikshu is the most prominent name associated with this.  (Though
one of his stated goals was to correct the "errors" of Shankaracharya.)

All three of these can be called Samkhya, all of them invoke the name of
Maharshi Kapila (as do various types of Vedanta in some contexts) and all
of them are different.  So which one are you referring to?
