If Einstein says Newton was a sentimentalist and his philosophy was based on
some sentimental concepts - yes then that would be slinging mud.

It is precisely Einstien's theories that are taking us  back to the finding
of Kapila.

Mankind evolves. The concepts that we have of the past have to be
re-evaluated. Even the ideas of Vedanta have to be reinterpreted with the
findings of modern science.
The first major steps in Indian philosophic thinking were taken by Kapila.
Next came Vedanta and now the future comes with the re-interpretation of
these philosophies by the sage recent times.
If anyone thinks that the secrets of the universe are tied up in some
passages of ancient books - by Kapila or by Shankara -just static stuff -
they will be disappointed. There is constant evolution even in
interpretation. We are fortunate that the message of spirituality has always
been refreshed by real seers 'rishis' throughout the ages - we have to be
open to their teachings rather than stick with some slokas from some books
collecting dust.

The most rational presentation of Samkhya and Vedanta the modern world has
seen comes with Vivekananda. He is not holding on to some dogma or defending
some dogmas but talks from first hand experience of what Kapil or
Shankracharya are talking about.

We are talking a subject which every prophet says: is only understood by
first hand experience. Is there anyone on this mail list who can say he is
master of Vedanta?

If one is not established in 'Advaita' then one should show the humility of
listening to perhaps the most recent prophet of Advaita. - 'Vivekananda' -in
my humble opinion.

It is Vivekananda who says that all other schools of philosophy - specially
the Vedanta and Yoga schools owe much to Kapila who set up the ground work.

So we come back is there a real difference in the concept of maya and
prakriti?
