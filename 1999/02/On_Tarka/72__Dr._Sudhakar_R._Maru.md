Almost all biographies of Acharyas of traditional
vedantic system (advaita/vishistadvaita/dvaita)
say, while dealing with their learing phase after sanyasa,
that they have mastered vyakarana(&alankara), nyaya,
tarka, mimamsa and vedanta. Even yoga has been practised
by the acharyas of advaita system (such as Sri Sadasiva Bhramendra,
HH Gnana nanda Giri of Thiruk Koviloor, HH Sivabhinava
Narasimha Bharathi and HH Abhinava Vidya Thirtha of Sringeri).

1. While nyaya, yoga, mimamsa & vedanta are part of the Indian
   philosophy, where does 'tarka' fit in ? Is it a shastra or a
   generic 'dos and don'ts' manual for those engaged in philosophical
   debates in those days ?

2. Why were vaiseshika & sankhya not mentioned as major areas of
   study as much as other four systems ?
