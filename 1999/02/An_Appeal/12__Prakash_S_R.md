Hello Everyone,

I want to post an appeal on behalf of a sangha in Bangalore.

Regards,
Prakash SR
Feb 1st 1999.

                          AN APPEAL
                         -----------

The Badaganaadu sangha, a premier organization of Karnataka is
rendering meritorious service in the cause of education for over
decades.

The sangha was founded in 1943 for providing free food and shelter
to the poor students for the community for prosecuting their
studies in Bangalore. The sangha has started the "Udyoga Shikshana
Vibhaga" to provide training/career guidance in self employment
and entreprenership. The sangha has now embarked upon an ambititous
project to construct the 'Badaganaadi Vidya Bhavana', multi-purpose,
multi-storeyed building with an area of 11,500 sq ft on a land
gifted to sangha by Smt Sarojamma Nagesha Rao, a noble philanthropic
lady and a life member of Sangha. The estimated cost for this
venture is around Rs 60 lakhs for which helping hand is needed.
A room or a hall may be donated by any person in their name,
the contribution for a room being Rs. 50,000/-. The sangha has
also plans to set up a lady hostel and 'vriddashrama' which are
essential for the community at large.

We look forward to noble and philanthropic persons like your
goodselves to give us your helping hand in serving the community.

All the payments can be done payabale to "Badaganadu Sangha",
Address :- 20/1, Badaganadu Sangha Road, Kumara Park West,
Bangalore 560 020.

Phone : 91-80-3445944.
