Perhaps you have heard of Paramhamsa Yogananda's Autobiography of a Yogi. His
guru, Sri Sri Yukteshwarji Giri was initiated into Kriya Yoga by Sri Lahiri
Mahashaya. Sri Lahiri Mahashaya was initiated into Kriya Yoga by Mahavatar
Babaji, a person said to be still alive, somewhere in the Himalayas. He is said
to have initiated Adi Shankara and Saint Kabir into Kriya Yoga. His purpose is to
give the Supreme Truth to those desirous of it. He has been alive for several
thousand years now, somewhere in the caves of Himalayas near Badrinarayan.
