In Gita Sri Krishna Paramatma said  "Jatasya Dhruvam Mrituv"

We see that truth ourselves in this world.

Now in puranas it was mentioned that there are seven persons (all males) who
are chiranjeevis.  Hanuman, Markandeya, Aswthama, Bali, Vibhushan, Krupacharya
and one more.

I asked some learned people in India and their responses are:
They are Divamsa sambhutulu,  Karana Janmulu

If that is so why not Adi Shankara, Ramana Mahrishi and Ramakrishna
Paramahamsa.   They are gone but their names remain forever.

But in the matter of chiranjeevis Hanuman etc. their forms and names are still
supposed to be existing somewhere- They only know.

Why would anybody wants to be a chiranjeevi?

                                                                            Na
