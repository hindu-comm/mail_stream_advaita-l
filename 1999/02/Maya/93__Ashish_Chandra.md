What I wanted to know Jaladhar is whether these *links* to
Brahman/Ishwara/Narayana are the innumerable realized Gurus and/or the
presence of Avataars amongst us. Sri Krishna himself says that he had given
*this* knowledge to Vivaswan who gave it to Manu who gave it to Ikshavaku.
What I'm trying to say is does there have to be such a link, that surely
must exist as avidyA as it is illusory, that leads us to our true nature ?

Any thoughts are much appreciated.

Sevaram

Brahman is self-illuminating.  Brahman is the basis of illumination.
