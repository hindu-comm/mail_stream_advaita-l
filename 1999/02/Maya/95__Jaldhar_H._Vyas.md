Well not quite.  The full example is this.  A man wakes up in the night
and feeling something under his foot, thinks "Aaargh! It's a snake." On
lighting a lamp, he realizes that what he thought was a snake was ust a
piece of rope.

The man is the Jiva bound by avidya.  The snake is  Maya.  The rope is
Brahman and the light is Jnana.
