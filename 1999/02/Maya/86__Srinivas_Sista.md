I have to split hairs here. 'snake in the rope' is a wrong way of putting
it. It is better if it is 'rope as snake'. So

        seeing rope as snake :: seeing Brahman as xxxxxx(whatever)

No. One does not view Brahman as anything. Because a view is just that,
a view. The view is the snake. Rope is non-view. You dont view the rope.

This reasoning arises when one considers the rope as also another view.
That is not the case as I explained above.
