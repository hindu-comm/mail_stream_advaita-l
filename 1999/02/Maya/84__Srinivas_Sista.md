Sure. Perhaps you feel that this illustration does not accurately represent
the status of maya. Then you should give your reasons for feeling that way.
The statement 'relationship between brahman and maya' should be considered
carefully. I will give a loose example:
        A person imagines a picture. What is the relationship between
        the person and the imagined picture? What is the relationship between
        the person and the power of imagination. Depending on which
        one is termed maya(picture or power to imagine), the answers differ.
        In the former no relationship, in the latter it is not apart from
        the person.

I meant it to be serious. I hope you will continue enquiry until doubts
get resolved.

Srinivas Sista.
