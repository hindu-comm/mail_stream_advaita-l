Thank you for your very valuable input Srinivasji.

let us get back to the main theme

'The snake in the rope DOES  illustrate the relationship between maya and
brahman.'

You have kindly said that the rope should not be taken a a rope but as
Brahman and you have also kindly resent the message explaining that it is
like viewing a picture.
You view Brahman as you view the rope?  Then brahman becomes a mere subject
of your imagination.

When I said the qualification is non trivial I meant if you replaced the
rope with say a string or a thread - that may be called a trivial
qualification and we can take that but this further qualification to the
concept of brahman as subject of the mind is worrying.

I also agree with you and take in your point that I have to continue to work
on this until the doubts in my mind are cleared.
