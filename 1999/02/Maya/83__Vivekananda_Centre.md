Dear Srinivasji

I am not sure if this message was meant to come directly to me or to go to
the list.
For the benefit of all I am posting the response back via the mail list.

Many thanks for your well thought out reaction. If I understand rightly you
are saying
that the example is supposed to give different valuations to the rope and to
the snake.  (rope should be taken to be absolute like Brahman) - then the
equation would work out.

But then can you really make the assertion that:-
The 'snake in the rope' DOES illustrate the relationship between maya and
brahman?

You have requalified your statement - the requalification is not trivial it
is a serious one.

Maybe other learned members will give us the benefit of their wisdom.
