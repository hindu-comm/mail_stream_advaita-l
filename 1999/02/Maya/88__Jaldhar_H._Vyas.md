The conceptual error you are making is confusing frames of reference.  For
example, a common type of Maths problem goes like this: "If a train leaves
London at 120 mph and another train leaves Manchester at 100 mph, at what
point will they meet?" Is it an acceptable answer to say "Well, I looked
at the schedule and there aren't any such trains." No, it is understood
that for the purposes of this problem, the trains are being mentioned.  It
isn't about trains, its about a concept of algebra.  In the same way the
snake-rope example illusrates superimposition.  Nothing more.  Do not read
anything else into it.

For now, Brahman is a subject of the mind.  This is a concession to the
fact that we are human beings bound by avidya.  The end of goal of
Vedantic sadhana is to be able to make a conceptual leap into
non-subjectness.

A good way to do this would be to read the works of learned Gurus in
Shankaracharyas parampara.  This has all been gone over many times before.
