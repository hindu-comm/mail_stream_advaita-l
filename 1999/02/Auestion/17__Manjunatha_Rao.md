Hello all,

I just have one question. I would like to know why God created this world?
Many say He created world & maya and that is how atman got in the web of
the world. If He is/was always pure, why did He opt to go through this
misery of being in maya ? Again for that many answer it is His lila. It is
really interesting to know more about this.

Thanks,
Manjunath
