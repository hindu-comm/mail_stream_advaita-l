He didn't.  It's all been a terrible misunderstanding. :-)

If by God you mean the saguna form of Brahman such as Vishnu Bhagawan,
Shiva Bhagawan etc. than they create and destroy the world due to the same

He didn't.  What we call lila is due to our own lack of understanding and
for that God cannot be blamed.
