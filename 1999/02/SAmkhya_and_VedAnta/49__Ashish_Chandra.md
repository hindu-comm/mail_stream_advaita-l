If Prakriti cannot be known, how does one know through SAnkhya that Purusha
exists and can be realized ? As far as this post goes, again there seems to
be little difference between Maya and Prakriti. Only difference is that
Kapila says Prakriti is real but unknown whereas Shankara says it(Maya) is
unreal, mithya.

The issue seems to be with Purusha. Why should there be multiple wholes.
Which could lead us to asking whether there is an Antaryamin that pervades
all these Purushas. Is that Ishwara of Yoga ?

To my understanding so far, Shankara's Brahma can be taken to be the the
exposition of the non-necessity of multiple Purushas. Purusha or Soul/Self
is verily one, and one alone. It gets deluded and thinks itself a part of an
unreal Maya or real Prakriti. Truth is attained when this Supreme Purusha or
Brahma is known to be Self and all else as being unnecessary, whether one
thinks all else is real and existent, or unreal and non-existent. Would this
be a correct interpretation ?

Based on what I known so far, which is not much, that would be my first
impression.

Thanks a lot
