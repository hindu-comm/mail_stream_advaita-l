We hear people talking about "realization of the self".  What is it that
they're talking about?  How can we "achieve" this if we can't even
determine what it is?  As Human beings, we are bound by names, forms,and
events.  Intellect is the only tool we have available to us.  Perhaps the
Devas or some advanced race of aliens have a better way but it doesn't do
us the slightest bit of good.  Thus Vedanta as a method of sadhana tries
to employ our talents (as meager as they may be) to the fullest degree
possible to clarify our understanding of the true nature of things.

As for the ultimate, let's cross that bridge when we get to it.

Dear Jaldharji, you are right in what you say of course. Intellect is a most
valuable tool available to us. What Ashishji was pointing to was that
"practical experience" of Self-Realization is beyond the Intellect. You say
dear Jaldharji that, "As for the ultimate, let's cross that bridge when we
get to it." Great Sages tell us that we are on that bridge now  that leads
to the Self. Did not Ramana Maharshi say that Reality must ever be Real.
Therefore it must be Here and Now. But We have to See It. Not some day in
the future but Now. If we wait for some bridge to come in the future so we
can cross it and reach the Self, there might be a long wait. I have taken
the liberty to quote the Sage of Arunachala.

It is false to speak of realisation. What is there to realise ? The real is
as it is, ever. How to realise it ? All that is required is this. We have
realised the unreal, i.e., regarded as real what is unreal. We have to give
up this attitude. That is all that is required for us to attain jnana. We
are not creating anything new or achieving something which we did not have
before.


Effortless and choiceless awareness is our real state. If we can attain it
or be in it, it is all right. But one cannot reach it without effort, the
effort of deliberate meditation. All the age long vasanas (impressions)
carry the mind outwards and turn it to external objects. All such thoughts
have to be given up and the mind turned inward. For that, effort is
necessary, for most people. Of course everybody, every book says 'Be quiet
or still'. But it is not easy. That is why all this effort is necessary.


Namaste to all
Harsha
