I think Jaladhar, that the realization of Truth, as was pointed out by Harsha, was
in reference to realization of the Self, and not merely through trying to find out
the best and truest categorization of an event. I further think that it is not even
the power of intellect but only the realization of Self that can really dispel
ignorance. Before one does that, isn't everything to be considered Avidya ? Does
rigorous analysis fit in then ?
