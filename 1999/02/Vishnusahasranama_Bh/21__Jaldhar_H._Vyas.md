Yudhishtira asks Bhishma six questions.

1.  In all the worlds, who is described as the one God?

Shankaracharya notes that by worlds is meant all the branches of
knowledge.  Ones intellect and imagination can take one far beyond the
limits of the mundane world.

2.  What is the ultimate goal?

Human beings have the power to do many things.  Yudhistira wants to know
what is the most importand and advantageous thing a man can do.

3,4. By praising whom and worshipping whom will Men gain the highest good?

Why are praise (stuti) and worship (archana) mentioned seperately?  aren't
they synonyms.  Here praise refers to the whole range of mental worship
where even if we are singing we are primarily _thinking_ about Bhagavan as
opposed to te physical acts of worship in the home or temple etc.  It is
wrong to stress one over the other.  Both are equally important.  A persom
may perform all the required acts diligently but without ever stopping to
think about what he is doing.  A person may be so in love with the concept
of Vedanta, he may completely forget to actually practice it.  Both these
types are lacking what is needed to achieve the highest good.


5. Of all the Dharmas, which do you consider the best?

When speaking of Dharma how do you judge better or worse?  The criteria is
the extent to which an act increases goodness.  Things like charity for
example increase the fortune of ones fellow beings.  Other deeds gain
wealth, children etc. for their doer.  But one realizes that all these
types of goodness though real are ephemeral.  So that goodness which is
eternal and without beginning or end is the highest goal and its pursuit
is the highest Dharma.

6  By the repeated practice of which Dharma will creatures be released
   from the chains of samsara?

The bonds of samsara bind tightly and it is a very rare person who can
shrug them off just like that.  Thus it is by repetition (japa) that one
can hack away at samsara.  Shankaracharya notes that while manava (human)
was used in preceding shlokas, here jantu(that which is born) is used.
This is because by samsara is meant chiefly the cycle of birth and death.
(Though all other forms of action and consequences are include also.)  And
in the matter of death the Humans predicament is no different from an ant
or any other living creature.

Next time I'll write what Bhishmas answers to these questions were.

So long as a man is fit and able to support his family, see
what affection all those around him show. But no one at home
cares to even have a word with him when his body totters due to
old age.

Money speaks in a language which the whole world
understands ! Man usually calculates before he gives.
He wants an equal return, if not more. Even families
operate this way. So long as a person is able and
earns, people crowd around him/her in the hope of
getting benefitted by the savings. As the person
gets old, even the people who depended upon him
all these years pack him off. These relatives now
do not want the old person, who needs financial,
moral and physical support, to be with them.
In the modern age, the old person is packed off to
an old age home (so many of them have sprung up
in India now, especially since most of the sons/
daughters of these old people are in US now !).
And as one loses the health, not even the person who
you took care for years will want to look after you.
One becomes a burden to the family and the relatives
look forward to the day that you will no longer be
a bother to them. This is the merciless way the world
operates.

What should be done ? Before the world and the relatives
reject the person as useless, let the person learn to reject
the world as maya, not out of arrogance, but by realizing
the Self within.
