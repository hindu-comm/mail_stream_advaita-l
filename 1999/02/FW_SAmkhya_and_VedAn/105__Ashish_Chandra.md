[...]  Intellect is the only tool we have available to us.

Are we to say then that intellect alone can lead us to this realization ?
What then of the various Bhakti margs and Kriya Yoga and Ashthanga Yoga ?
Or maybe if you mean that intellect being the means of controlling one's
senses :  then I think that is probably correct.
