From:   Jaldhar H. Vyas [SMTP:jaldhar at braincells.com]

[...] The mandir I usually go to is afiiliated with the Vaishnava Pushti
Marga sect.  They hold Bhakti to be of paramount importance and and have no
place for Advaita-style Jnana at all. [...]

I thought Pushti Marg was founded by Sri Vallabhacharya of the Shuddh
Advaita school. Is this incorrect ? They are also Advaitins then, but not
in the Shankara mould.

Thanks
Ashish
