Harsha: Thank you for your clear and eloquent response. I fully agree with
the spirit of it. But all spiritual practices are preliminary to GYAna
(and not just those involving Kundalini Yoga). Sri Ramakrishna Paramhansa
was of the opinion that Kundalini Shakti must be roused for spiritual
evolution. Other Advaitin saints have emphasized Shakti practices and
spoken of them. Perhaps even within the Advaita philosophy there is room
for difference of opinion in practical matters involving spiritual
practices.
