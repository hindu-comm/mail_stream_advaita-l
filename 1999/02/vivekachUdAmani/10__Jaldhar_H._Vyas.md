Yes there is, but not to the extent that "anything goes."  For Vedanta,
the line of demarcation is that any spiritual practice must be in keeping
with the teachings of the Vedas.  For instance although many Acharyas have
spoken highly of some Tantric sadhanas, they have not hesitated to
speak out againsts things such as vamachara which are immoral or
spiritually damaging.  A ritual practice can only have effect if there is
the right samkalpa or intention behind it.  If some practices don't even
share the same goals, how can they have the same effect?
