Sorry for bringing out an old thread into discussion, but I just
remembered this over the weekend:

There is, however, some shruti basis for this practise (saattvika tyAgaM).
In the atharvashI.rshhaganapati upanishhad (part of the atharva veda, this
is chanted during vinAyaka chaturthi even by yajur vedins), one of the
prayers is:

tvaM eva pratyakshaM brahmAsi .
(Verily, You are the perceptibly evident Brahman.)

Without doubt, Ganesha is being hailed as the Ishvara. And also:

tvaM eva kevalaM kartAsi .
(Verily, You alone are the doer.)

The upanishhad seems to say that there is no other doer but Ishvara. There
is simply no other way to interpret the above verse. I don't know if
saattvika tyAgaM is advaitic, but it is not contradictory to attribute ALL
doership to the Ishvara.
