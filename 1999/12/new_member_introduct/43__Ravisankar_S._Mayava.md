Hello and thank you,

Here is a brief introduction as requested.
My name is Keith Aitken and I live in Toronto Canada.

I was initiated into meditation over 20 years ago through the TM
organization, I was a meditator for about 3 years and then I lost my
way. 5 years ago I joined The School of Philosophy
http://www.schooleconomicscience.org/
in Toronto
The spiritual advisor of the School of Philosophy is the  Shri
Shantanand Saraswati, the Shankaracharya of northern India.

The teaching is advaita, and since joining the School of Philosophy I
have resumed meditating, and the practices recommended by the School.
I have begun a study of Sanskrit, but am at a very beginner stage in
that study.

I look forward to participating on the list.

Best wishes,

Keith Aitken
