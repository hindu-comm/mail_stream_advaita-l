Here are a few references among many:

1. upadeshasAhasrI 17.22-24
2. bhAshhya to kena 4.8. Note the comment about indra and
vairochana.
3. bhAshhya to muNDaka 3.1.5.
4. bhAshhya to brahmasUtra 1.1.1.

Also consult the bhAshhya to any bhagavadgIta verse which
talks about sama, dama, etc.

The upadeshasAhasrI summarizes the reason for and importance
of purity of mind in 3 verses. In fact, that seems to be more
than enough.
