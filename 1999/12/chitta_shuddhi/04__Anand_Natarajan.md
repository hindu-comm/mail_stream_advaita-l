Yes . That is correct. One use the mind to get rid of the mind.
An analogy is given that "The pyre of wood is lit by another piece of wood , but once lit, the piece of wood that was used to light the pyre is thrown into the pyre and is burnt along with it ".
The mind cannot survive a one pointed enquiry into itself because the mind lives by attachment.
