In the work Upasesa Saram of Sri Ramana Maharashi, there are many verses indicative of what Chitta Shudhi is.

For example :     "Manasam tu kim margane krithe
                         Naiva Manasam Marga Arjavath"

meaning      :    "What is the mind may you enquire
                        There is no mind you will find."

To me this is the whole meaning behind chitta shudhi. When the mind stuff is purified, the mind and the atman remain the same. There is no break up into forms any more.
