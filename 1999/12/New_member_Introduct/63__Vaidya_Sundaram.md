Thanks for enrolling me in the list.  I am a  "Smartha" Computer Engineer
working in Sydney, Australia.
I am moderately knowledgeable in the philosophy of Advaita Vedanta and
would like to take this opportunity of interacting with people who know about
this and learn more.

Thanks and Best Regards
Veena
