> Dear Shri Jaldhar,
>
> In response to your e-mail request, I advise that my interest in
> Advaita has arisen through my association with Chinmaya Mission. I am
> currently the Head of our fledgling Centre here in Dar es Salaam.
>
> This interest has deepened through attending the Discourses and
> Spiritual Camps of the Chinmayay Mission.
>
> I also endeavour to read as much as possible the books of Sri Adi
> Shankaracharya.
>
> I am currently the Chairman of Shree Hindu Mandal, Dar es Salaam and
> also the Hindu Council of Tanzania.
