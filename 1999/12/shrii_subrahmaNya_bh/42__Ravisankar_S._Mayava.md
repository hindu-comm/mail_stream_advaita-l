Glory of Sugandha Hill

O Lord Shanmukhaa! Thou stands on the top of the Sugandha hill,
proclaiming that whenever the devotees climb this hill it will give
the same benefit as climbing the king of mountains (Kailas)! May the
six-faced lord on the Sugandha hills remain there to bless me!

Glory of Lord Guha

On the shores of the great ocean which steals away the sins of the
devotees, stands the Sugandha hills, the most favourable site
for the sages to perform their penance! Thou resides there to destroy
the worries of the devotees! O self-luminous Lord who is present in
the cave of the heart! I adore Thee!
