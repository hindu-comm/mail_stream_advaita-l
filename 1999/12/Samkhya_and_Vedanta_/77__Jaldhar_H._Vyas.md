As we've moved on to a different topic I've changed the subject line.

This is very interesting as I haven't read Vijnanabhikshu in depth.  I
know he had a problem with the doctrine of Maya but I was under the
impression that he accepted most of the rest of Advaita Vedanta intact.

Other modern treatments of Samkhya do redefine it in Advaita terms.

A difference is that Brahman contains everything.  There is no independent
existence outside of Brahman.  Whereas in Samkhya Prakrti continues to
exist even after the Purush is liberated.

If Vijnanbhikshu doesn't believe in Maya how does he explain this
ignorance.  The classical Samkhya reasoning is that the Purush has somehow
gotten embedded in Prakrti and taken on some of its (local)
characteristics including ignorance.

Please post on this if you could.  Without Maya how can this
superimposition occur?  Is it just the delusive power of God?  That would
be quite close to the Dvaita explanaion I think.
