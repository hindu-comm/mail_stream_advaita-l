Thank you for the quotes relating to meat consumption in the Manu smR^iti!

Actually, the Gautama dharma suutra refers to the Manu smR^iti, which
means that Gautama was later than Manu, and had considered Manu's position
on the subject!

See for example Gautama dharma suutra (GDS) 21.7
"Manu (declares, that) the first three (crimes, named above) cannot be
expiated."

The book that I have (editted by Max Mueller) says that Apastamba also
refers to the Manu smR^iti, though I haven't come accross a verse therein
which mentions Manu by name.

YAGYavalkya also says in this context that "VR^ithaa mAmsaM varjayet.h"
-- Idle meat (that is not offerred to the gods) should be avoided.

 That may be true but in the case of Manu smR^iti we find that he
 specifically addresses the issue of rules for meat-eating and
 avoidance (maa.nsasyaataH pravakshyaami vidhiM bhakshaNavarjane, 5.26)
 in a section by itself so to speak. So such rules carry more "weight"
 than those mentioned in other contexts.

 YAGYvalkya smR^iti also has a similar section.
