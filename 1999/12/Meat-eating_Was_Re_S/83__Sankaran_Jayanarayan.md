This is quite incorrect. I have read several smR^iti quotes which advocate
meat-eating, and not just the "prasaadaM" from a yaGYa.

Apastamba dharma suutra (ADS) 1.5.17
14. He shall not eat food which has been bought or obtained ready-prepared
in the market.
15. Nor (shall he eat) flavoured food (bought in the market) excepting raw
meat, honey, and salt.

Gautama dharma suutra 17.38
"Let him eat (the flesh of animals) killed by beasts of prey, after having
washed it, if no blemish is visible, and if it is declared to be fit for
use by the word (of a BrAhmaNa)."

ADS 1.5.17.37 (virtually identical with GDS 17.27)
"Five-footed animals (ought not to be eaten) with the exception of the
iguana, the tortoise, the boar called savaatit, the porcupine, the
rhinocerous, the hare, and the Puutikhasha."

There must be several other quotes all over the place in other smR^itis
too like the PurANas.
