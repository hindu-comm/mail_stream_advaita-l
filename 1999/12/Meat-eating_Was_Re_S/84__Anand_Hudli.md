 The trouble with quotes taken in isolation and without properly
 considering all views is that they present a distorted picture of
 the issue in question!

 Manu discusses meat-eating in his smR^iti and then goes on to
 present his concluding remarks on the subject. These concluding
 remarks or rules (Manu 5.26 to 5.56) are to be taken as the final
 verdict of Manu who surely must have considered a greater number
 of texts than either you or I can possibly quote.

 For example, Manu says:
 yaGYaaya jagdhirmaa.nsasyetyeshha daivo vidhiH smR^itaH |
 ato.anyathaa pravR^ittistu raakshhaso vidhiruchyate || 5.31 ||

 Eating meat as part of a yaGYa is said to be a divine rule.
 Therefore, (eating meat) in other circumstances is becoming of
 rAkshhasa's.

 And, he says (5.32)
 devaan.h pitR^I.nshchaarchayitvaa khaadan.h maa.nsaM na dushhyati
 By eating meat in the course of worshipping Gods (in YaGYa's) and
 the pitR^i's (manes), there is no sin.

  In fact, Manu goes even further to prescribe the consumption
  of meat in rites such as yaGYa's:

  niyuktastu yathaanyaayaM yo maa.nsaM naatti maanavaH |
  sa pretya pashutaaM yaati saMbhavaanekavi.nshatim.h || 5.35 ||

  The man who, although engaged in a rite (such as certain yaGYa's)
  does not eat meat (which should be eaten) according to the rules,
  becomes an animal for 21 lives after death.

 Manu makes an unambiguous and conclusive statement in 5.52:

  svamaa.nsaM paramaa.nsena yo vardhayitumichchhati |
  anabhyarchya pitR^In.h devaa.nstato.anyo naastyapuNyakR^it.h ||

  There is no greater sinner than one who desires to increase his own
  flesh by (eating) the flesh of other (animals) without worshipping
  the Gods and manes.

  Manu even quotes a pithy definition of the word "mAMsa" (meat)
  in order to prove his point:

 maaM sa bhakshayitaa.amutra yasya maa.nsamihaad.h myaham.h |
 etatmaa.nsasya maa.nsatvaM pravadanti maniishhiNaH || 5.55 ||

 "He (saH) will eat me(mAm.h) in the next world whom I eat
  here in this world." This is the definition of "mAMsa" (meat)
  according to the wise.
