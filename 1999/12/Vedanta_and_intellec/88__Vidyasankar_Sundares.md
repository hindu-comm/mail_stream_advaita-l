Isn't there a gap between dedicating every action to the Lord and realizing
that one is not a doer at all? The former still assumes an element of
doership, but it is a discipline that helps in the maturity of the mind.
However, that one offers one's action to the Lord does not remove the
efficacy of action in bringing its desired rewards. One may not be attached
to it, but the rewards will be there, nonetheless. The latter realization
transcends even the necessity of offering action to the Lord.

I find that this distinction is often lost sight of in many modern
discussions. Sankaracarya's gItAbhAshya remains the classic exposition on
what it means to offer nishkAmya karma to the Lord, and how it differs from
the ultimate realization.
