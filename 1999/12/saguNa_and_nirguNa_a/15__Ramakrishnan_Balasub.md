I throw my hands and give up. I have had enough of trying to explain
what  my current posts mean. Now I have to explain what I meant by
posts which were posted 1 year back. When I do that, I presume some
post from two years back will surface, and so on and so forth. Sorry,
but I have neither the time nor the patience.
