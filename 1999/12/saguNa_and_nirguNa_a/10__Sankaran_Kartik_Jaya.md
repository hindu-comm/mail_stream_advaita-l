What I understand from the above is that something that is within the
realm of avidyaa cannot counteract avidyaa.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

But if shruti were in the realm of avidyaa, how can it remove ignorance?

In the updeshasahasrii, Shankara says that RAma achieved GYAna *only* by
listening to the statement "That is You," and NOT by *any other means*.
Implying of course, that the statement "That is You" conferred GYAna on
RAma. There are several other places where Shankara says that GYAna can be
achieved by contemplating on statements of shruti. My question would
be,"How is it that something like a statement (which is obviously in the
sphere of avidyaa), "cause" Self-realization?"
