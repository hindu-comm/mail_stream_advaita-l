Let me see if I've understood you (Rama) correctly now.

avidyaa is due to thoughts like "I am this (jIva)" and Shruti's teachings
such as,"You are THAT" etc. remove this avidyaa because they go contrary
to thoughts which are rooted in the ahaMkAra.

You're saying that ALL saguNopAsana stems from the thought "I am this
(jIva)" and the upAsana (worship) proceeds from this thought onto thoughts
such as "YOU are my savior" -- which in no way destroys the thought "I am
this (jIva)."

Am I correct? If so, saguNopAsana such as worship of Vishnu, Shiva as
endowed with forms, etc. cannot directly lead to salvation. I think that
is more or less obvious.

But what Anand said was that worship such as "This form that is the Lord
will save me" can aid one in identification with that form and eventually
lead to the destruction of the thought "I am this (jIva)." It is not a
direct approach, but an effective one, as this is prescribed by all
aachaaryas to common people such as ourselves.
