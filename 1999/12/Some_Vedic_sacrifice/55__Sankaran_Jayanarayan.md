I got this from your posting a while ago, as I assumed there had to be a
desire before performance every sacrifice/rite:

 Further, as HH Shri Abhinava Vidyateertha points out, the Veda
 usually has a qualification attached to a sacrifice. "If you
 desire such and such a thing, then do such and such a sacrifice/rite."
 So the conclusion is: If you don't have the desire for the thing
 indicated, there is no need to undertake the prescribed sacrifice.

Maybe the "vasante..." injunction is preceded by the desire for
such-and-such thing?
