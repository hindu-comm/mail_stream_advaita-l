It may be OK for you. But I don't think the animals would like to be slaughtered.
You seem to pay no attention to the pain and suffering that the animals go through.
How does advaita treat physical pain? Is the pain and suffering that the animals go
through also considered mithya? Does "experience" have any place at all in advaita? Or is
it rejected completely?
