 The yajnas that I cited used real animals. Vaishnavas  have been
 known to follow the custom of substituting real animals by those
 made from grains, but this has no vedic sanction. Perhaps the ParamAchArya
 was referring to such "piShTa-pashu-yajnas." smArtas do not accept
 such so-called yajnas.

 That is surprising given that Shankara's commentary on the Brahma sUtra
 "ashuddhamiti chenna shabdAt.h" makes it clear that we cannot find
 fault with yajnas that involve the killing of animals. Yes, all yajnas
 that are of the pAshuka and saumika type (see my previous note on this
 subject for an explanation) REQUIRE the killing of animals. I have heard
 from a reliable source that as recently as a couple years ago, such a
 yajna was performed near Gokarna, Karnataka. So there is really no way
 to insist on "ahiMsA" in such yajnas. Note also that not all yajnas
 require animals. The darsha-pUrNamAsa-ishhTi is an example of a
 "vegetarian" yajna.
