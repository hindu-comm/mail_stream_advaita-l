  "vasante vasante jyotishhA yajeta" - as per this one must perform
  the agnishhToma yajna every spring. In fact, even the ParamAchArya
  of Kanchi mentions people called "prati-vasanta-somayAji" who used
  to perform this soma yajna (agnishhToma-jyotishhToma) every spring.
  Now, any soma yajna involves both the soma juice and animals. So one
  could make an argument that there is an injunction to conduct such
  yajnas.

 The trouble is that people on both sides of the "vegetarian/ahiMsA
 vs. non-vegetarian" issue do not fully understand what the shAstra says
 and doesn't.  If one does perform a soma yajna, animal(s) must be
 sacrificed. There is no excuse for not sacrificing animal(s) in such
 yajnas. But at the same time, if one does NOT perform such yajnas,
 one must NOT kill animals or eat meat simply as part of one's diet.
 Outside the context of such yajnas, meat-eating must be avoided.
 Manu and other authors of smR^iti are quite clear on this.

 People who hold that ahiMsA has to be practised in all contexts,
 even in yajnas, as well as people who hold that meat-eating can be
 justified in any context are both wrong!

  Note that the book I was referring to is in Kannada and as such is
  meant mainly for people living in a limited geographical area. I am
  sure that any yajna conducted in TN or elsewhere and in accordance
  with the shrauta rules would not be done any differently. There is
  no systematic recording of such shrauta events. That makes it hard
  to cite examples in other areas unless there are "eye-witness"
  or otherwise reliable accounts.
