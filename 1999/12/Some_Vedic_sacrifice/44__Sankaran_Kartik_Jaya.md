This is an old posting, but I wanted to clarify one point.

I have a question here: were *real* animals sacrificed in these YaGYas or
were the "animals" made of flour and other inanimate objects? In "Hindu
dharma," the Paramaachaarya has talked about Vedic sacrifices in which
such subsitutions took the place of animals. Perhaps the above yaGYas were
also performed without injury to a real animal.

Earlier this century, some people wanted to perform a yaGYa where a real
animal was to be sacrificed and after much protest from persons associated
with the Sringeri Math, the idea was given up. So I would really like to
know if these sacrifices did indeed involve injury to animals.
