Well that depends on what you mean by Samkhya.  Most modern treatments of
Samkhya even in Sanskrit describe an "Advaitized" form of Samkhya such as
Vijnanabhikshus type.  If you mean "classical" Samkhya such as the type
Shankaracharya argues against in the Amshadhikarana, it takes the same
basis as Advaita Vedanta but comes to startlingly different conclusions.
