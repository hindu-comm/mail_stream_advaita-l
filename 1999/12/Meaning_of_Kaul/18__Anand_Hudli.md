 advaitins must indeed steer clear of kaulAchAra or vAmAchAra. This
 "left-hand" method of worship has flourished in many places including
 Bengal. Notably, Ramakrishna and Vivekananda have both been sharply
 critical of this cult. The former has described the vAmAchAra as the
 path of scavengers (bhangi's). See what Vivekananda says in The Complete
 Works, Vol III, p. 340:

  "Give up this filthy vAmAchAra that is killing your country...
  When I see how much vAmAchAra has entered our society, I find it a
  most disgraceful place with all its boast of culture..."

  That is a pretty strong condemnation of vAmAchAra coming from one of
  the greatest sons of Bengal.

  Sometimes an argument is put forward to defend vAmAchAra thus. Not
  everyone is fit to offer Vedic worship. People who are shUdras or
  outcastes cannot be engaged in vedic worship. They can offer meat, etc.,
  because that is what they consume everyday. While this may be a kind
  of justification of tAmasika worship by such people, it can hardly
  be transformed into "the best path for liberation" as the vAmAchAra
  claims. advaitins, who strive to worship in a sAttvika way, cannot (must
  not) stoop to that level in search of liberation! While God is
  supremely satisfied even with an offering of a leaf, flower, fruit, or
  just water with devotion (gItA 9.26), there is no necessity to engage in
  the "elaborate worship" as described by the vAmAchAra texts. Such forms
  of worship are simply schemes for sensual enjoyment, not anything
  else.
