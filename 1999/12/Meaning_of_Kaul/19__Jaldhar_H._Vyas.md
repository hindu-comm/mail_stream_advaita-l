Thankyou to all who responded to my questions about kaulachara.  You have
confirmed what I had suspected--that this Kaulachara is not approved by
our sages.  However the figure of Shri Bhaskararaya is still very
fascinating to me.  On the one hand he stands firmly in the mainstream of
Vedic tradition.  On the other hand he seems to be an advocate of
practices which are the polar opposite of that.  Maybe he was just a
hypocrite.  Somehow I don't think so.  Thinking about this, I was reminded
of the story of Daksha Prajapati and how by angering Shiva Bhagawan his
Yajna was destroyed.  That story also blends antinomian and orthodox
elements in a way that seems confusing at first but makes sense when you
grasp the inner meaning.

I guess I need to wait until I can question someone who has been initiated
into the Tantric tradition to get a proper understanding of this.
