One of the foremost scholars of the 17th Century was Shri Bhaskararaya.
The scion of a distinguished family of Rgvedins, he was an Agnihotri and
performed the Vishwajit and other Somayajnas.  His erudition in Mimamsa
and Vedanta was also considerable and he always salutes Shankaracharya and
his four students at the beginning of his works.  The reason I mention
these things is to show he was hardly some antinomian rebel.  In fact Shri
Bhaskararaya meets the highest standards of Vedic orthodoxy.  Yet he
identifies himself as a Kaul.  In the couple of works of his I have read
(Saubhagyabhaskara on Lalitasahasranama and Guptavati on Chandipatha) he
doesn't seem to be particularly anti-upasana.  He does argue for the
necessity of external worship though.  Obviously his understanding of the
terms kaulachara and samayachara are different than those described above
(which are those expressed by Shri Lakshmidhar I believe.)

So my questions for learned Shrividya Upasakas are:

1.  What is the understanding of the contemporary inheritors of the
sampradaya on the meanings of the words Kaula and Kaulachara?

2.  Whose views are to be preferred, those of Shri Bhaskararaya or Shri
Lakshmidhar?  Or both?  Or neither?

3.  Is Shri Bhaskararaya justified in maintaining that Kaulachara is
compatibile with Vedic Dharma?
