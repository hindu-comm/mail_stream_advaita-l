It is believed that the animals will go to heaven.  As animals have no
other means of going to heaven, from that viewpoint one is doing them a
favor.  Naturally this view came in for some ridicule.  In one Sanskrit
play (I forget which) a character asks if the sacrificial animals go to
Heaven than why doesn't the sacrificer offer up his own father!

BTW, from the Advaita point of view all kamya karma invovlves himsa.  Yes
it is better to "kill" flowers or akshata instead of some living thing but
even there you are adopting the view "I will destroy this thing in order
to create some favorable result."  And that is the heart of himsa.  So
only the karmayogi or the sannyasi can truly practice ahimsa.

Something similar as noted above.

I think there is definitely some truth to that.

He specifically mentions in his Autobiography the influence the 19th
century Jain layman saint Raichand (Rajachandra) had on him.  And in his
Gujarati environment, Jainism and Vaishnavism are very strongly entwined.

I was at a Punjabi restaurant just a couple of weeks ago where the menu
called vegetarian food "Vaishnav. Bhojan"

I think it is quite possible.  Here is an interesting quote from the
introduction to the Ramakrishna Mission edition of the Nyaya work
Bhashaparichheda.

"Vishvanatha[1] also wrote another work called Mamsatattvaviveka--an
interesting treatise on Smrti.  The work was written as a result of a
controversy with the Pandits of Maharashtra with a view to vindicating the
custom of meat-eating amongst the Brahmins of North India.  The work has
been published by the Sarasvati Bhavana of Benares.  The author shows
vehemence in his advocacy of the custom which prevails particularly in
Bengal, and ridicules the South Indian Pandits, who deprecate meat-eating,
as the followers of Buddhist tenets."

So evidently you are not the only person to have thought along those
lines!
