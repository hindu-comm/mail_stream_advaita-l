Hi Ashish,

     Well, if it's not for "everyone" then it's not for "anyone."

>Even told by a Guru, without adequate preparation, it would only lead to
confusion.

     That's OK.   From time to time, Consciousness "appears" to get
"confused."  Maharshi says that it's all a great game of pretending.  The
nature of the Self is to be what it is by pretending to become what it's
pretending to NOT be.

     Hmmmmm.   Well, even great old analogies (e.g. like the
"dream-and-the-dreamer" as well as the "world-as-a-movie") DO have their
limitations.   :-)

     You ask about the "one who is being dreamt of."   But, exactly "who"
would that be?  And, once again, exactly "who" is this Dreamer?  Isn't it
all just Consciousness?

    Yes, the dream and the dreamer appear to "exist"....but are they REALLY
real?

    Reality is perhaps best determined by looking for "that which
persists."    However, neither the dream nor the dreamer fit that category
since neither of them last indefinitely.

     Only Consciousness "continues" unabated.
