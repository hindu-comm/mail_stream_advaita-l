It depends on whether one considers God to be a seperate and external
entity or not.  If one believes there is a difference, the best one can
hope for is to be reborn in Vaikuntha etc. where presumably the
circumstances are more conducive to moksha.  The only direct way to moksha
is to realize that there is nothing other than Brahman and Brahman is your
own inner self.

The shastras describe various koshas or layers of the body of which the
physical one of flesh and blood is only the outermost.  As long as their
is any kind of a body there is a location for karma which is the actions
of the past and for all save the jivanmukta the potential for actions in
the future.

No even the Devas, Gandharvas etc.  whose bodies are different from Humans
can suffer from the notion "I am so-and-so, different from
others."  Brahman is that which is free of all such notions.

The reason a Jivanmukta is still attached to a body is due to the
lingering effects of his past karma.  He may know the details or he may
not.  But why would he care?  All that is behind him.

Because at the time of Birth we do not have the viveka to understand what
is happening.  But by the time we are old enough to die we hopefully
do.  In the Bhagavata Purana there is a section called Garbha Gita in
which the garbha (embryo) laments the fact he will be entering
samsara.  Most of us are not that smart!

Really everyone already has moksha.  But most do not realize
it.  Shankaracharya gives the example of someone who is tricked into
buying something made of mother-of-pearl instead of silver.  He is so
pleased because it is nice and shiny but lacks the knowledge to realize he
has something worthless instead of something real.

Unlike some other philosophies, Advaita Vedanta is optimistic that moksha
is real and something the sincere seeker is able to achieve.  For some it
may be easy, for others there may be a long road ahead but it is possible
for all because it is ones own nature.

For different types of men and women the Vedas prescribe different routes
but for all people, actually for all beings the possibility for moksha is
there .

In the shastras and the Guru parampara, we have a trusty guide to
understanding Atmajnana.  At first the sadhaka seeks understanding
as if it is external.  At that point it is necessary.  But eventually it
becomes unnecessary.

Doubt and ignorance are the enemies.  There is never any impertinence in
combatting them.

Your post reminds me I have to start up my postings of the Jivanmuktiviveka of
Swami Vidyaranya again.  It covers many of the questions you have raised.
