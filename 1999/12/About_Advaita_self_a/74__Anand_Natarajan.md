In the dream (that is avidya) you see the person you dreamt of (as you put it) as a separate entity. Once the avidya is removed, you do not see any difference between you and that other person. If you go back to the level of the dream , you will still see the other person as you saw him before, again rising up to the level of Vijnana you as an entity do exist separately from him as an entity.
Perception is based on one's impression. Therefore the first rule of spiritual practice is what we see with our senses is only the mind's impression. It does not exist in the same sense as we see it. As the seer changes the seen will also change correspondingly.
