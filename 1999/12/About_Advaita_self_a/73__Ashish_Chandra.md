Ok. So all is consciousness. But, at least at the vyavahaarik level, you and
I *appear* to exist. You and I are the dream of one and the same One,
correct? Then taking that to be the premise, once whether you or anyone else
realizes that this is all a dream and truly "awakens" to your real nature,
all this, including me, should vanish and become realized at the same time
because its the same one that is dreaming this and we are just all
characters in the dream. So as soon as the dreamer awakens, we should all
become aware of our true self. But this is clearly not true and, if I
remember correctly, I read a similar such argument against Advaita which is
often used by other (Hindu) schools.

>From this, we deduce that *something in me* itself has to become aware of
*my* true nature which "I" clearly am not aware of right now.

Perhaps at the end of 100 Days of Brahma, this dreamer will awaken and suck
everything into itself (so us poor jivas enjoy the bliss temporarily) and
then project the illusion once more, meaning, go to sleep once again ? :-) ?

Would appreciate any corrections (and there should be plenty).

Thanks
ashish
