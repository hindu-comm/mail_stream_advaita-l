This would seem quite awkward to a novice (and they do exist). The idea that
I am all there is is not for everyone. Even told by a Guru, without adequate
preparation, it would only lead to confusion.

Many people have compared the illusary nature of this world, and existence,
with the dreaming state. That the One who awakens realizes the unreal nature
of the thing called existence (yours and mine).

I think an example was cited wherein Sri Sureshwaracharya gives the analogy
of the Gyana (which is in the realm of Avidya ?) acting like a tiger in a
dream that causes the sleeper to wake up.

Seems to me, that Gyana causes the Brahma in us to become aware of its own
existence/nature as Ayam Atma Brahma.

But here is my confusion. The dream causes the one who is chased by a tiger
to wake up. Gyana  directly causes the removal of Avidya. THAT IS ONLY TO
THE PERSON IN THE DREAM (as also to the person in the realm of avidya). To
the realized Self, there is no awakening. But what to the one who is being
dreamt of ? To say that he doesn't exist just doesn't cut it. Seems like one
does have to *get* to a stage to say something like I alone exist.

thanks
ashish
