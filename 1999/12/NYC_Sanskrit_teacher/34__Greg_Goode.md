Greetings to Advaitins!

Friends of mine at a yoga center downtown in New York City are mounting a
yoga teacher's training course.  I am helping out, and we are looking for a
knowledgeable person to teach the Sanskrit alphabet, sounds, esoteric
correspondences, basic verses, chants, mantras, etc.  The schedule will
start in January, and the teacher would be needed for an hour or two each
week or two, perhaps for a period of 6 months.  Perhaps we could compress
the schedule some more.  Any suggestions?  Knowledge of Vedanta or
Patanjali-yoga-sutras very helpful, but not necessary.  Compensation
offered, but I'm not sure of the terms yet.

Reply to Greg at <goode at dpw.com>, or call 212-734-6289.

Thanks!!

--Greg
