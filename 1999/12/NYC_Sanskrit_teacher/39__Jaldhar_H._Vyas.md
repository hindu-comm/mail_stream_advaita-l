That's not that one on Chambers Street is it?  I walk past there often.

If that's all, you could probably get a Columbia U. student to do it.  The
person who gets hired should have good pronounciation.  (The world doesn't
need more people who say Daaarrrma!)  This is especially important for
mantras which depend on proper pronounciation for their effect.

If anything you should double or triple it.  I can't imagine much progress
happening in a shorter time.  And the last thing the world needs is more
teachers without a clue.
