namaste,

Greg, I am replying to your query on Sanskrit teacher. There is an organization
called Samskrita Bharathi. The URL is

http://www.samskrita-bharati.org/

We have sanskrit classes going on on a regular basis in Bay Area, CA under the
auspicies of Samskrita bharathi. This organization is dedicated to bring
Samskrita into regular day to day lives. We had a class few months back in the
Bay area which was conducted by one of the full time volunteers of Samskrita
Bharathi. The teacher's name is Vasuvaj. He can be contacted at
vasuvaj at hotmail.com. Please check with him if he could be of some help to you.

DhanyavAdaH
Sreekanth
