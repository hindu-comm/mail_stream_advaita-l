Where did you get these ideas? That if one doesn't feel that he is not the spirit, he
should practice dvaita so that he can "slowly" reach advaita ? dvaita philosophy says
that jIvas, jada (insentinet matter) and Ishwara (Lord Vishnu) are eternally different
from each other and that jIvas and jada are eternally dependent on Ishwara and there is
taratamya (heirarchy) among jivas who are infinite in number. Advaita says that there is
only one entity- Brahman and that this world of matter and multiple jIvas is mithya.

FYI, Dvaita doesn't lead to advaita and a dvaitin doesn't mean one who identifies himself
with the body. It is not my intention to advertise the dvaita site here but you may want
to visit www.dvaita.org to get a *correct* understanding of dvaita philosophy or
tattvavada as propounded by Sri Madhwacharya.
