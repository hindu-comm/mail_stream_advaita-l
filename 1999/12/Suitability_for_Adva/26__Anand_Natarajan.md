I saw all these mails coming on Kaulachara, vamachara and I thought we should'nt be discussing these things in the first place.
There are 3 types of tendencies in the mind, the animal , the human and the divine. To my knowledge, the tantra philosophy  caters to all three types of people.
Sri Ramakrishna practised all types of Tantra. However  in none of his teachings does He recomend people to practise them in this age.
The basic suitability for advaita is this , "Do you feel you are the spirit and not the body ?". If so you  are fit for being an advaitin.
If you dont feel you are the spirit , then  practise dwaita  and you will slowly reach advaita  but  dont go below the level of a human being.
