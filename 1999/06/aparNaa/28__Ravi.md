namaste

The name aparNaa has different possible interpretations. I
thank the members for pointing out some of them. I referred
to the translations I have on saubhAgyabhAskara (commentary
on lalitAsahasranAmam by shrI bhAskararAya) and most of what
was written on the name is correct. Only the interpretation
I wrote did not have a  support there. I will write the
complete commentary on this name when I have time.

Ravi
