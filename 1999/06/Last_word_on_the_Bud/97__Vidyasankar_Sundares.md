As always, Sri Sringeri Mahasannidhanam easily leads one to the crux of the
issue. The Vedantin attempts to resolve the apparent contradiction in the
Veda. The other holds up the apparent contradiction as real and rejects the
Veda.

Indeed. This grounding of action in desire is a fundamental insight of
advaita vedAnta that has often been ignored. This is something that Sankara
and his successors repeatedly point out. Most objections raised against
advaita by well-meaning orthodox people overlook this basic issue.
