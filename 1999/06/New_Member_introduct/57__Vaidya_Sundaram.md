namaste

With regarding thyself, I am interested in the Knowledge of Advaita
philosophy by all means to liberation. I don't know much about Advaita except
reading some books by Swami Vivekananda. But my main aim is to know more
about Advaita philosophy as a shila(student) which may help  to adapt in my
day to day life. I am in know  way to discuss Advaita without knowing about
It.

I also like you to  recommend some Advaita books  which will help me to
expand my Knowledge(with book name and author)

respectfully,

r.lakshmi narayanan
