Hi.

  Thanks (Ramakrishnan) for your long e-mail explaining some things. I am
presently reading the translation of the UpadeSasAhasrI by Sengaku Mayeda,
hoping it will clear things up. I have some general things I am wondering
about. Hope you can clarify it, or at least point me to books where I can
find the details.

I understand this.

Buddhism does not accept shruti as a

make shruti subsidiary to logic, but

I have a question on this. According to Mimamsa and Vedanta, Sruti is
apaurusheya, one of the meanings/implications of which is that it is not
composed by any person. How is Sruti then "seen" by the Rshis? By mystic
meditation (yoga?)? Or devotion to the Lord? If that is so, is Sruti or
the equivalent truths "accessible" to anyone who performs the
corresponding meditation with the same devotion, like Christians,
Buddhists, Jains, etc.?

Thanks in advance for your reply,
Ganesh.
