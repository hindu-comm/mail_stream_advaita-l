That's a useful rule of thumb. Thanks very much!

However, in this particular case (taking abhavitA as correct), the
two words should then NOT be written with a space separating them
(as I have it in several editions).

> According to SankarAcArya's commentary, the reading should be abhavitA,

Accepting the master's reading over the printed form, I explored
the word abhavitA further, and was delighted by the discovery.

I first assumed that bhUtvA is a participle forming a subordinate
clause and expected a main clause containing a finite verb, and
thus read bhavitA as bhU+luT.  But na~n is not an upasarga, and
therefore cannot be prefixed to the verb, thus bhavitA must be
prathamA of bhavitR.  The dictionary entry for that (M-W 749c)
mentions that the form bhavitA is "also used as a future tense
with or without /as".  So, taking asti as the implied finite
verb in the sentence, na~n may again be prefixed to bhavitA.
This construction prevents the reading of bhU+luT (anadyatane),
which is particularly inappropriate given the imminent battle,
and allows reading the sense of bhU+lRT (indefinite future),
which one would have expected here anyway.  So this na~n is
essential for the grammar, syntax, and semantics.

The wonder of it is that, due to saMdhi, this essential "a"
is not evident.  Silence is extraordinary.

Another brilliant one-liner!

It does illuminate how one's thinking is so often 180 degrees out:
the fact is, I have difficulty dissociating /bhU from the Immutable!

Context!  Context!  Context!  I habitually get bogged down in the
details (as with bhavitA) - thanks for lifting me out!

And putting me back in the main flow of the argument.

It shines through your posts!

Oops! Yes, that is what I meant.

Ah, yes!  I can appreciate the emotional impact of a change in rhythm
from English poetry.

Keen means enthusiastic, rather than incisive, in my case.

Daunt: to tame, subdue  <--  L. domare, to tame  <--  Skt. damu upaSame.

Daunting task  -->  tranquil mind.  That's a problem ?
