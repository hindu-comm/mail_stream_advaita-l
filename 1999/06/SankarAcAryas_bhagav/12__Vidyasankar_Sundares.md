Perhaps some manuscripts do have a space here. As Anand has pointed out,
Sri Madhusudana Sarasvati has given a commentary taking the reading to be
bhavitA. The case must have been even more complicated in the distant past
when the text was being handed down mainly as an oral tradition!

I did not consider the luT case at all, and assumed bhavitA to come from
bhavitR. The commentary helped - yo hi bhUtvA na bhavitA sa mriyate ity
ucyate loke - here bhavitA goes clearly with yaH and saH, ergo bhavitR. I
can't remember any other instance of this word from my admittedly limited
knowledge of Skt. literature.

True! I find that I cannot do justice to the work when the mind is not
tranquil. It is maintaining that tranquility that is difficult!
