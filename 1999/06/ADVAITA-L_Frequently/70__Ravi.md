FAQ 1: What are the List policies?
----------------------------------------------------------------------
LIST POLICIES

1) Advaita-L is a open, unmoderated list to discuss advaita-vedanta as
taught by shrI shankara. By advaita-vedanta, the tradition established
by shrI shankara and the maThas created to is referred.

2) Even though the major emphasis is on advaita-vedanta taught by shrI
shankara, topics related advaita-vedanta are welcome. Purpose of other
related articles should be to aid the understanding of
advaita-vedanta.

3) Articles promoting bhakti within the framework of vedAnta are most
welcome.  The articles should be acceptable to the framework of
advaita-vedanta.  Even though advaita-vedanta holds that liberation
is through AtmajnAnam, bhakti is always emphasized.

4) Items 2 and 3 are vague, as the maintainers of the List, We reserve
the right on acceptability of articles. In the case the articles are
unacceptable, it will be informed in private and resolved in private.

5) Discussion of nAstika traditions and their philosophies are not
allowed. By nAstika traditions,  traditions like buddhism and
jainism are meant . But scholarly articles comparing these traditions
with advaita-vedanta will be accepted. These articles should be sent to
the list administrators and not to the list.

6) Posters should not be disrespectful to towards saints and sages of
other traditions, and should show respect towards each other as well.


7) Administrators of the list reserve the final word on issues like
acceptability of posts. These decisions will be based on the list
scope. In case of doubt, knowledgeable members of the list will be
consulted.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
FAQ 2: Where are the archives of the list? How can I access them
----------------------------------------------------------------------

There are two ways to access the archives. Easiest way is to use the
WWW interface. To do that point your Web browser to
http://lists.advaita-vedanta.org/archives/advaita-l.html At present
there is no search facility (Listserv Lite does not come with a search
engine).

The second method is to use the GET command. This method is very
useful when you want download the messages say for a month and print
them. For this send a mail to listserv at lists.advaita-vedanta.org and in the
body of the message

INDEX ADVAITA-L

As a response to this LISTSERV will return you the index of all the
files. The archives is in weekly format. Say I want to get the file
LOG9605C ( 3rd week of 5th month of 1996). Then send a mail to
listserv at lists.advaita-vedanta.org with the body of the message containing

GET ADVAITA-L LOG9605C

Vidyasankar Sundaresan. You can access the FAQ from

out of town, etc. When you are back, send a mail again to
listserv at lists.advaita-vedanta.org with body of the message containing

Please use the NOMAIL option when you go out of town. Do not use
auto-reply as it may end up flooding the mail box of the members.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

FAQ 9: Removal from Advaita-l due to mail delivery errors
----------------------------------------------------------------------

The way the LIST has be set up is, if there are mail
delivery problems to your address, after the tolerance level, the
List Server software will automatically delete your name. The
tolerance level is: error for 20 consecutive messages or 4 days,
whichever happens first.

In case you are not receiving any mail for few days, please check
the Archive Web site. If the WWW site shows messages on those
days, please contact me, I will add you back to the list. This
has happened once or twice in the past.


----------------------------------------------------------------------
FAQ 10: No HTML and binary files
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Archives at present cannot handle HTML formatted messages and binary files
like gif/jpeg etc. Please send only plain text messages to the list.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Support for advaita-L is provided by Jaldhar H. Vyas

Lite software is used for running the list.

namaste

There is a detailed explanation for this verse in shrI paramahansa
yogAnanda's commentary on shrImad bhagavad gIta.  I find svAmi
yogAnanda's commentary very fascinating and one of the best (and  quite
unique). Please refer to that. You may find the complete bibliographic
record of the book at this site,

http://www.yogananda-srf.org/catalog/gita.html


Thank you.

Ravi
