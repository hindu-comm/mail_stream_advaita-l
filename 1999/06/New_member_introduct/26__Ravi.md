 Greetings,
            i am currently studying for a B.A. in Religious studies
at the University of Wales,Cardiff  and  am learning Sanskrit among
other things. My family  is from Mauritius and i am
familiar with popular and devotional Hinduism of most types.My
interest in Advaita Vedanta is both personal and academic. I am
particularly interested  in  the  philosophical aspects of Advaita
and Indian philosophy, such as use of logic and epistemology, and am
keen to discuss these areas.
                                Best Wishes
                                       Roshan Kissoon
