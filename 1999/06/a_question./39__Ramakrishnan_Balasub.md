My feeling is that the statements like no one else will be born in his
family who is ignorant is arthavAda in praise of brahmaGYAna.
Doubtless, being born in the same family a GYAni was born requires a
lot of previous puNya, but I don't see why that translates into Atma
GYAna.  If these statements are not treated as arthavAda, it becomes
very problematic w.r.t avidyA/mAyA.
