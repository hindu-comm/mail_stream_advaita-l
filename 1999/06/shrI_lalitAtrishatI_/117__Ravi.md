O Lord hayagrIva, you are a Ocean of Mercy and affectionate towards
your disciples, from you I have heard what all that needs to be heard.

rahasya nAma sAhasraM api tvattaH shrutaM maya |
itaH paraM me nAsti eva shrotavyaM iti nishchayaH || 2 ||

I have even heard the secret 1000 names on shrI lalita devI from you.
Thus I am sure  that there is nothing greater than this to be heard.
