namastE,
When She, as PArvatI, was performing penance to appease Lord Shiva, She did
not even take leaves for food. Since She did not eat leaves, She was known
as aparNA.
Learned members can elaborate on this.

Raghavendra.

 I have heard Sri anantarAma dIkshidhar splitting aparNa as apagatham + rNAm
=>
one who alleviates all the debts of the devotees. The debts have in general
been
equated with the three kinds of debts a human is born with (deva rNam, rishi
rNam and pitru rNam); this means that one who prays to Her is absolved of
all
mundane debts as well and hence the devotee attains to Her without further
encumbrances due to karmic action.

aum aparNAyai namaH
