Are there any references which link shashi varNam (white color) with
shrIman nArAyaNa? Is not His color referred to as megha varNam?  DhyAna
shloka-s in sahasranAmam points to this. Also it refers to Him wearing
pItAmbaram.

I was under the impression that it was a shrIvaiShNava prayer. Please
correct me if I am wrong. Do smArta-s also use this?


Thank you.
