|| AUM namo bhagavate rudrAya ||

  The Rishi of this mantra as well as the devatA is BhagavAn rudra (Shiva),
  and the meter anuShTubh.

  yA te hetirmIDhushhTama haste babhUva te dhanuH |
  tayA-smAnvishvatastvamayaxmayA paribbhuja      ||

                      (Shri Rudram: anuvAka 1; Rik 13)

  yA - that
  te - Your
  hetiH - weapon
  mIDhushhTama - O Showerer of desired things
  haste - in (Your) hand
  babhUva - becomes (became)
  te - Your
  dhanuH - bow
  tayA - by that
  asmAn.h - us
  vishvataH - everywhere (and all times)
  tvaM - You
  ayaxmayA - by the non-harmful
  paribbhuja - protect

  The weapon of Yours, (such as the sword), becomes the bow in Your
  hand, O Showerer of desires! With that non-injurious (bow), do You
  protect us everywhere.

  sAyaNAchAryabhAShyam.h   (Commentary of sAyaNAchArya)

  he mIDhushhTama-atishayena kAmAbhivarshhaka yA te hetistava saMbandhi
  khaDgAdirUpaM yadAyudhaM yadapi te tava haste dhanurbabhUva | ayaxmayA
  anupadravakAriNyA tayA hetyA tayAvidhena dhanushhA cha tvam-asmAn-
  vishvataH paribbhuja sarvataH paripAlaya ||

  O One who abundantly showers  the desired things (of the devotees)!
  Your weapon, although such as the sword, became a bow in Your hand.
  With such a bow, which does not cause harm, You protect us on all sides,
  everywhere.

  Notes:

 The previous verses prayed for the withdrawal of Rudra's weapons. This
 verse goes further and prays that the weapons may actually turn out to
 be beneficial for the devotees.
