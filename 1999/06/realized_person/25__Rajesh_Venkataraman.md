Yes, I think so... All his actions adhere to dharma effortlessly.

Also, as the existential self is only a super imposition on the essential
self, it can never exist independent of the AtmA. Like the rope-snake story,
the object has been correctly identified as a 'rope'  and the long held
misconception that it is a snake has been discarded. The body is no more an
appendage...
