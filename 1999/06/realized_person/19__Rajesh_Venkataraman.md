He is not equivalent to God. He IS god himself. When we say that he IS God,
we
mean that God and Jiva are essentially made of the same material (Brahman).
He
does not become the controller of the world here.

There are two kinds of IsvarAs(saguNa- with attributes and nirguNa - without
attributes and hence formless). As it is not possible to conceptualise a
nirguNa IsvarA
viz. Brahman, IsvarA in the beginning stages of a person's spiritual growth,
Isvara is said to
have such and such form, that he will punish you if are adhArmic etc. As the
person
progresses he is naturally introduced to the concept of nirguNa IsvarA
(Brahman).

Technically saguNa Isvara is Brahman with mAyA and nirguNa Isvara is Brahman
independent of anything.

Another explanation of saguNa Isvara can be as a 'karma phala dAtA' i.e. one
who
just distributes the results of actions(karma) of every individual. He does
not make
any decision of his own accord. If he does then he will be a partial
Isvara!!
When it is said that he is the controller of the world he does not do
anything out of his
will!

To answer your question a jiva can only be equivalent to nirguNa Isvara and
NEVER to
saguNa Isvara.

Omniscient should not be taken in the literal sense of the word. Since
Brahman pervades
all that is in the universe, it is the supporter of the whole world i.e. no
object in the world
exists independent of Brahman. It is the substratum of everything.

Therefore when a brahmajnAni is supposed to be omniscient it means that he
knows the
substratum of all that IS, in the universe. A jnAni knows the essential
nature of
everything. The effects(nAma rUpa) are only modifications
which do not have any reality. They are mAyA. For details refer Sankara's
B.G. Bhashyam
on na jAyate mriyate vA kadAcit & nAsatO vidyate bhAvaH (B.G. 2.16)

A brahmajnAni cannot be expected to know about Quantum mechanics or
satellite technology.
For him they are just nAma rUpA and Brahman is the only reality. The outward
representations do not matter.

Every jIvA is essentially the same Brahman(there are no differences in
Brahman).
So when Ramana Maharshi was talking about Brahman and Sankara was talking
about Brahman they were referring to the same vastu(object). So the teaching
could not
have been different.

Hope these have been answered...
