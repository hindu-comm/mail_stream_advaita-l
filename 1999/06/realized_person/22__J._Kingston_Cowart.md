"Ontological substance" in this sense refers to "essential being."

Those who have not yet realized their true nature are attached
to desire for continued existence, utterly unable even to truly
imagine their own end, for even in the imagining, there they
are--imagining.

The one who has realized is no longer so attached, and therefore
accepts that the jiva has no perduring qualities at all--for it has
no ontological substance, no essential being, to which they might
pertain.

Is this correct (in terms of language)?
