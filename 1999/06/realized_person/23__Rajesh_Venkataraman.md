Yes... But I would also like to state the following...

When a jiva is liberated, he is definitely not attached to any 'external
object' (anAtmA) he fully well realises that he is only the AtmA which *IS*
a reality nevertheless. AtmA eternally exists without qualities though i.e.
he realises he is not SUnyam like the Buddhistic view point. So, though
after realisation a jiva is NOT *attached* to AtmA he fully realises the
existence part of it.

Even the anAtmA rests only on Brahman but only the ignorance of the
substratum causes bondage!

Please refer Sankara's Bhashyam on B.G (2.16) at

I hope I have understood your question right and done justice to it...
