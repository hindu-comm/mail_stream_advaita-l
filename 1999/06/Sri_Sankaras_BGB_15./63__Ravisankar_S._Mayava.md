namaste

There is a detailed explanation for this verse in shrI paramahansa
yogAnanda's commentary on shrImad bhagavad gIta.  I find svAmi
yogAnanda's commentary very fascinating and one of the best (and  quite
unique). Please refer to that. You may find the complete bibliographic
record of the book at this site,

Thank you.
