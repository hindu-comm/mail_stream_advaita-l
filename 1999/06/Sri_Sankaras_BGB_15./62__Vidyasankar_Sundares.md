I had written:

A few more references -

Swami Nikhilananda's translation mentions a widespread agricultural custom
of sowing wheat and rice seedlings in moonlight, based on the belief that
the moon imparts the life essence to plants. Winthrop Sargent's translation
refers to the moon, but footnote refers to the soma juice in Vedic yajna.
Juan Mascaro's translation refers to both the moon and the soma juice.

Even more interestingly, the brAhmaNa literature explicitly draws a
correspondence between the moon and soma, the juice of the yajna (re:
Satapatha brAhmaNa 1.6.4.5). As such, one seems to be implied by the other.
I would presume that SankarAcArya must have also equated the two. In other
words, my earlier surmise that the reference to the moon in BG 15.13 goes
back to an ancient belief seems to be correct.

Regards,
Vidyasankar

The moon symbolizes the mind. The sap is that stuff that maintains
consciousness of identity.
Plants and herbs are those entities that provide sustenance for the mind.

Or so it seems to me, at this time, in this place.
