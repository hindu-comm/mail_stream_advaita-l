Correct me if I am wrong, but I had the impression that brahman is
anirvachanIya.  Per upanishads,  that one which the mind cannot grasp
and the words cannot describe, that is the brahman.
This world as we see is a vyavahArika sathyam whereas the anirvachanIya
brahman is the paramArthika sathyam and this is the bone of contention
between buddhism and advaita.

Sankar.
