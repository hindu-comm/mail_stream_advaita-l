A very perceptive comment from Vidya (as usual!). In the foreword to
David J. Kalupahanas, "Buddhist Philosophy: A historical Analysis," U.
of Hawaii Press, 1999, G.P. Malasekhara writes in the foreword: "But,
perhaps the most provocative chapter in the book is the seventh, which
deals with nibbAna (nirvANa). This is a subject on which countless
treatises have been written recently, especially by Western savants,
many of whom tend to interpret nibbAna as transcendental and absolute"
and goes on to criticize that view. We should remember that the Sri
Lankans have a living tradition of Buddhism almost from the time of
Buddha himself (from Ashokas time?). Their interpretations should be
taken seriously.
