Hi,

Correct me if I am wrong, but I don't think the above argument is valid.
The question of the truth in Sureshvaracharya's attacks on
logic/metaphysics of opposing systems is one of logic/philosophy, but any
claims/accusations of copying, are historical claims, and do not have the
same validity. They are to be settled by historical research, not by any
extension of valid philosophical criticism by Sureswara on mImAmsA or
Buddhism, right?

Ganesh.
