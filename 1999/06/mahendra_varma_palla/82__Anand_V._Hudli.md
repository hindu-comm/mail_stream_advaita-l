  This does confirm that he ruled about 1500 years ago.

 The birth of Shankara is usually accepted as 788 CE(AD) which
 is after Mahendra Varma. GauDapAda is also accepted usually
 as living in the early part of the same century as Shankara.

 He may have attacked Jainism or Buddhism. But does this
 necessarily mean what he wrote about them is false? Was there a
 basis in reality for what he wrote about them? Even Sureshvara,
 the direct disciple of Shankara, was a mImAmsaka before he "converted"
 to advaita. And he wrote criticisms of the mImAmsakas themselves after
 his "conversion."  We do not take such criticisms of Sureshvara as lacking
 in truth and substance just because "he had reasons to attack mImAmsA."
