Here is something that I read in HH Sri Chandrasekarendra Sarasvathi's
discourses.  He says Sruti indeed is the breath of brahman and it
certainly makes sense.  So they should have come into being, if we can
use that word, simultaneously.  In that case both brahman and Sruti are
existing since time immemorial, or should I say they transcend time.  I
will get that portion of his discourse transliterated and post it soon.

Namaskaar All,

Could someone please direct me to the Nahusha episode in MBh. I might be
able to put it to some immediate good use.

Thanks
