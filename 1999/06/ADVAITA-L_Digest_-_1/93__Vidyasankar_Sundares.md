What Swamigal is doing here is quoting from the bRhadAraNyaka upanishad,
which says that everything is breathed out of Brahman. Along with the Sruti,
what is breathed out of Brahman includes a whole lot of other things that
make up the perceptible universe. We cannot conclude that all that is said
to be breathed out of Brahman is eternal.

ps. Someone asked me about the usage of "Swamigal" by south Indians.  The
suffix -gaL in Tamil (-gaLu in Kannada) is analogous to -jI in Hindi, a
means of showing respect.
