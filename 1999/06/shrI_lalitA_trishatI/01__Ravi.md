Dear Members,

As you may have noticed, the last two names of trishatI was
posted with original sanksrit and my translation, not
relying on Dr. Chaganti Murthy's work. After I seeing the
copyright postings, I realized my using his translation will
not come under a fair use. Even though my intentions were
good, I should not continue that any further.

Hence, I am discontinuing the old series (reached upto 170
names) and I am planning to start it all over again, this
time with original text of shankara and my translation
(except occasional references to Dr. Murthy's work).   I
will begin the new series today. This will include also a
both pUrva and uttara of the trishatI with the original
text.

BTW, you can see the trishatI on WWW with my one-line
meanings based on shankara bhAShya (completed upto 160
names) at

http://www.geocities.com/Athens/Atlantis/7587/meenakshi/

I will post the new series at an average rate of 1 post per
week.

May my mind contemplate on the lotus feet of shrImAtA and
may She guide me in whatever I do.


Thank you.

With respects,

Ravi
