 The story occurs in the AraNyaka-parvan of the mahAbhArata, while
 the Pandavas are exiled to the forest. BhIma is caught in a deadly
 grasp by a large python (boa). As usual, YudhishhThira is asked to
 answer some tough questions in order to save his brother's life.
 The python is none other than King nahushha who has fallen to this
 condition because of a curse. He is freed from the curse after
 YudhishhThira's answers. See the translation by van Buitenen (sp?)
  for more details or any good translation. In van Buitenen's translation,
 I think it is Volume 2.

archives....wrong question, will check myself but if they aren't there,
could someone please direct me to a source/site.

Namaskar All,

Didn't see a search utility for the archives on the web interface. Is there
one ?
