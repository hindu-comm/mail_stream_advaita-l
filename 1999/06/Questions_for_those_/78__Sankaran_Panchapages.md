Yes, you're right in the last statement, but I think all the resulting
caste associations are fully explained by the dharmaSAstras. i.e. the
caste of a person who is conceived by the (niyoga?) fasion in which Vyasa
begets Dhritarashtra, Pandu and Vidura, is completely determined by the
mother's caste, according to the dharmaSAstras, I think.

But one thing: it is certainly true that the Buddhists are more likely to
argue for brahmin-by-conduct than the brahmins themselves. In the life of
the Buddha and Mahavira, there are numerous instances where they argue
against brahmins who claim brahminhood by birth, while the instances in
the Mahabharata aren't that many.
        Of course, in that case, if the influence were Buddhist in nature,
what reason would the brahmin(s) who composed the epic (historically
speaking) have, to incorporate the brahmin-by-birth concept?
        Is it possible that the two were entirely independent
formulations? Unless the verses in the Mahabharata and the Dhammapada are
almost identical.
        What do the dharmaSAstras say on this issue? Birth or conduct?

Regards,
Ganesh.
