 This is an excellent observation. Every key character in the MahabhArata
 has something that seems to conflict with established notions of caste or
 other orthodox ideals. In fact, the point that conduct determines whether
 one is a Brahmana or not is one of the important themes that runs through
 the whole epic. In some episodes, such as the nahushha episode, the point
 is made explicit. YudhishhThira points out that intermixing of castes
 based on birth alone is inevitable, and so it is the conduct that really
 determines whether one is a Brahmana. His birth alone does not guarantee
 BrAhmaNatva.

 Also, droNAchArya who is born a brahmana is shown to have accepted
 the profession of a Kshatriya. But Vidura born of a Sudra mother is
 shown to be a true jnAnI. Also, the DharmavyAdha episode makes a mockery
 of orthodoxy of Brahmanas and depicts a butcher as being more knowledgeable
 than a brahmana in matters of Dharma.

 KarNa who is born of a Kshatriya mother, Kunti, out of wedlock, is
 brought up by a charioteer and his wife. For the most part of his life,
 he thinks that he is a only a "sUta-putra." BhagavAn Krishna Himself is
 born a Kshatriya but grows up as a Vaishya in the house of Nanda.
 And BhIshhma undergoes a kind of self-imposed, life-long brahmacharya,
 quite uncharacteristic of powerful Kshatriyas who always had easy access
 to women.

 Someone like Buddha who looks for ways to criticize Brahamana
 orthodoxy and caste-ism, will find plenty of support in the MahabhArata.
 So it is hard to believe it when someone, scholar or otherwise, says
 that parts of the Mahabharata were added under Buddhist influence.
 Also, we should remember that as an itihAsa, the epic enjoys a higher
 position than the purANa's. The MahabhArata is also regarded as the fifth
 Veda. As such, it is not as easy to tamper with the 'bhArata as it would
 be with some of the PurANas where one would not be surprised to find
 anything!
