namaste

This list is indeed very fortunate to have Vidyasankar and Anand. I
thank them both sincerely with immense gratitude for educating many
like me. I hope God will bless this world with many such knowledgeable
Vidyasankars and Anands.


\aside
I believe that one will be better off approaching advaita-vedanta from
the side of dvaita and vishiShTaadvaita rather than from buddhism. It
may be quite disconcerting to face their offense especially for guys
like me who does not have a sound theoretical background. But I think I
approaching from that side is quite fruitful. This way we will be
closer in our discussions to the traditions of sanAtana dharma. My 2
cents. Please feel free to tear it apart ;-)

Thanks again.



Ravi
