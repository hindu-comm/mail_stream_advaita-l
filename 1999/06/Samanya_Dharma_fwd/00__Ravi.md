Subject: Samanya Dharma

  I was going through the recent postings in
  advaita-l on Samanya Dharma. I came across an
  interesting article in tattvaloka magazine
  online (Probably accessible from
  www.advaita-vedanta.org) related to the topic.

  The URL is:

http://www.vidya.org/tattvaloka/english/98sept/values.htm

  It can also be accessed in the article titled
  "Values in Life-I" in the "September 98" issue
  of Tattvaloka magazine online at:

http://www.vidya.org/tattvaloka/english/default.htm

Regards,
Suresh.
