It's best to ignore Zukavs book. He misinterprets much of the quantum
mechanics in his book. Not surprising, since he is a journalist. Even
some physicists can get into some weird reasonings. The famous Fritjof
Capra, in his Tao of Physics, claims that Eastern religions in general
say that the ultimate truth is beyond words. Then he quotes Heisenberg
(or some other famous physicist) on how the electron is beyond
description as it is neither a wave nor a particle. This is apparently
supposed to show that Eastern religions and modern physics concur with
each other. Complete nonsense, to say the least. I don't know where
they get all these guys.

Some authors manage to combine philosophy and physics and still point
out accurately the role of both. Schrodingers "What is Life?",  "Mind
and Matter" and "My view of life", especially the last book, are
excellent. There are a few errors here and there where he
misinterprets (just a little bit) some concepts in the upanishhads.
Overall, however, they are excellent pieces. Heisenbergs "Physics and
Philosophy" is also an excellent book.
