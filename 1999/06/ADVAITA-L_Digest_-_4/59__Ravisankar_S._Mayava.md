namaste Ashish,

I did not know that the past will come and haunt in the form of archives ;-)).
May be this should
be added  to prArabdha and sa~nchita, as Archive karma!!  Gary Zukav makes many
mistakes in his philosophy and this is one among them. I am able to catch these
mistakes better after three years of training in advaita-L.
