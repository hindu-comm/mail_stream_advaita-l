See Paul Williams's "Mahayana Buddhism: The doctrinal foundations" in the
Library of Religious Beliefs and Practices Series published by Routledge.
It's an almost impossible achievement by the author, to have presented a
vast subject in just about 300 pages, and yet to have succeeded in being
almost encyclopedic in his coverage. There is no discussion of
upanishadic/vedAntic influence, but one can get a very good idea of the
original source material of the Mahayana.
