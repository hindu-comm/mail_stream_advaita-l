Hi.
  I'm sorry I didn't remember that Sri Nanda Chandran had already written
on Nagasena and the Milinda Panha in his post. He says it's a very early
Buddhist text (probably Hinayana?).

        I just wrote what I wrote on the episode to see whether I had
understood it correctly in comparison with the Upanishadic philosophy. I
request to be corrected if I have misunderstood anything.

Thanks,
Ganesh.
