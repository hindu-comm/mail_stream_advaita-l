Thanks for bringing this to notice. Even though I receive my posts as
digest and individual mail, I thought  I saw my trishati posting on the
digest, I will be little careful.

This complaint, I did receive even when the list was in TAMU server (in
1996 I think). I asked the LIST Manager at A&M, he told me that should
not happen. We will look into that.

Another nice thing, people may not be using is, you can receive the
digests in HTML format, it is quite easy to read using Netscape
Messenger.

Thank you.

Ravi
