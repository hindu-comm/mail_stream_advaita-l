Greetings,

Some posts are not appearing in the digest distribution.

For example, from the archive of June 1999, week 3, the
following were not received:

From: Anand V. Hudli <anandhudli at HOTMAIL.COM>

shrI lalitAtrishatI bhAShyam.h - 4 (59 lines)
From: Ravi <miinalochanii at YAHOO.COM>

I am posting this to the list rather than directly to the
administrators, so that others receiving the digest format
may be warned to check the archives for missing responses.
This does assume that this post makes it to the digest :-)

Regards, Charles.
