1.shrutvA dharmAna-sheSheNa pAvanAni ca sarvashaH
   yudhiShTiraH shAntanavam punar-evA-bhyabhAshata

After hearing all forms of Dharma capable of effecting complete
purification, YudhiShTira, still unsatisfied, questioned the son of
Shantanu as follows:

shri yudhiShTira uvAca -
2.kimekam daivatam loke kim vApyekam parAyaNam
   stuvantaH kam kamarcantaH prApnuyur-mAnavAH shubham.

Shri YudhiShTira asked :
"In this universe who is the one Divinity (at whose command all beings
function)? What is that one supreme status which one should seek to
attain?  Who is that Divinity by praising whom and worshipping whom a
man attains good?

3.ko dharmaH sarva-dharmANAm bhavataH paramo mataH
   kim japan mucyate jantur-janma-samsAra-bandhanAt

Which according to you is that highest form of dharma (capable of
bestowing salvation and prosperity on man)? What is that by uttering or
reciting which any living being can attain freedom from the cycle of
births and deaths?"
