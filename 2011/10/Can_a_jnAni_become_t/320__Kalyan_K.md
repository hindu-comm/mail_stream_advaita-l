Namaste,

We know that once when Lord Shiva took the form of a chandala and stood in
the way of Sankara, the latter asked him to step aside. Of course, Lord
Shiva made Acharya realize his mistake, but based on this incident, I have
a question - Is it possible for a jnani (like Sankara) to become
temporarily deluded by maaya? If no, then how is this incident possible?

Regards
Kalyan
