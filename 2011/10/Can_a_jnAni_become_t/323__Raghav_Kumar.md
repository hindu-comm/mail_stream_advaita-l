Namaste
In addition to the above links of posts of SrI Anand ji which are very helpful
there is also the post of Sriram Sharma ji -
http://www.advaita-vedanta.org/archives/advaita-l/2010-July/024949.html
Quotation from Sriram Sharma ji's post:Swami Ramatirtha on Upadesa
Sahasri commentary (Chapter 18, Verse 99 inthe padya-bhAga, "brahmA
dAsharather..."):
"brahmeti -- dAsharathinA rAmeNa *devakAryasiddhaye manuSyAvatAra-nATyena*
sva-mAhAtmyAcchAdanaM sa^nkalpa-pUrvakaM yatkRtaM tad-iha 'tamaH' shabdena
ucyate. *na tu Ishvarasya sammohaH sambhavati.*"
Translation -- "What is said here as 'tamas' is actually the *mock-act
played by Rama* as a human being, which He did by veiling His greatness, in
order that the task that He took up for the benefit of the Devas will be
fulfilled. Surely, Isvara cannot become deluded."

Quotation from old post of SrI Anand ji :
(he rAma, tvaM viShNurasi na dasharathaputramAtrasya ityuktyaiva
brahmA dAsharatheH
saMkalpamAtrakR^itaM tamo viShNutvAchchhAdanarUpamapAnudat.h).
This tamas or ignorance, that was created solely by the will of ViShNu
Himself, was
removed by the upadesha of BrahmA, "You are Vishnu." The AcchhAdana or
concealment of shrIrAma's being ViShNu (ViShNUtva) was done by the
volition or will (saMkalpa) of ViShNu Himself. In other words, He
willed that His identity be concealed from His avatAra for *some time*
in order to destroy the wicked rAkShasas.


(End of quotes)

My doubt:

The word "deluded" seems to have a considerably different meaning and
implication when it comes to aa avatAra as compared to an aj~nAnI. In
the former's case, it is being called self-chosen or self-willed.  Is
that the idea ?

In the sentence quoted, of SrI Anand  ji  - "In other words, He willed
that His identity be concealed from His avatAra for *some time* in
order to destroy the wicked rAkShasas."
the question arises - He i.e., Ishvara (viShNu) who willed that His
identity be concealed from His avatAra (rAma), has to be free from any
concealment or delusion Himself. The "willer" i.e., Ishvara, has to be
always nitya-shuddha-buddha-mukta, surely? (Even if we grant that
Rama, an aspect of viShNu, was put under a temporary spell by viShNu's
will). That is my doubt.

If even Ishvara, the source of avatAra-s, can become deluded, by whose
will does it occur? Is there not infinite regress, unless we posit one
Reality who is never deluded even by mAya?

Thank you
Raghav
