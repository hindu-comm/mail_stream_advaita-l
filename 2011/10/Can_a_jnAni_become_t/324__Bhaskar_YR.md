The word "deluded" seems to have a considerably different meaning and
implication when it comes to aa avatAra as compared to an aj~nAnI. In
the former's case, it is being called self-chosen or self-willed.  Is
that the idea ?

Hare Krishna

But it seems it is better to say 'in the former's case (avatAra) it is 
self-chosen but 'forgotten' due to mAya's influence in that avatAra :-)) 
You can see this in varaha avatAra, where vishnu was very much happy with 
this varAha body & happily living with his 'family' without thinking about 
his original body & abode :-))  And same is the case with shankara 
bhagavatpAda (provided biography in mAdhaveeya is a true incident) after 
parakAya pravesha, shankara forgotten the  purpose of parakAya pravesha, 
happily enjoying the royal life...His disciples had to remind him his 
'own' svarUpa to make him come back to his original saNyAsi deha. 

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
