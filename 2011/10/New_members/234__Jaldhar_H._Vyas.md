I have a general interest in knowing and understanding more about Indian 
philosophy. From past few years I have been reading about Advaita and am a 
member of Advaita yahoo group.

Through this list, I hope to learn more and develop a better understanding.

appreciate the msgs being shared.  I travel to various countries including USA 
for talks.
