Namaste Dear Members,

There is a sloka from bhartruhari’s vAkyapadIyaM which says:

////

anAdinidhanaM brahma sabdatattvaM yadakSharaM
vivartatE(a)rthabhAvEna prakriyA jagatO yataH

//

The above verse determines the eternality of the sabda-brahma 
ie., nityatva of sabda-brahma. This also states that sabda-brahma
is both kArya & kAraNa 

To support the above statement, the reference “sabdabrahmaNi niShNAtaH 
parabrahma adhigacchati” is cited. 

Does this sabda-nityatva vAda of vAkyapadiyaM supports
vivartavAda or pariNAmavAda?

Kindly explain.

Regs,
Sriram
