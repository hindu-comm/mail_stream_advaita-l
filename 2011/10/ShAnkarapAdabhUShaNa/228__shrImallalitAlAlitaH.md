Quoting one or two persons or incidents is not enough. There are some
liberal persons everywhere.
digambarashAstrI is talking about whole community of madhva-s and their
attitude towards shiva. I don't know too much about them. But, if you can
tell us about their attitude as whole then it will help us understand
position of both madhva-s and digambarashAstrI.
