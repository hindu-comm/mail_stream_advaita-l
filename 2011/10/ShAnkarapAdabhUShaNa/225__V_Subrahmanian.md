A book with the above title was published by Anandashram, PuNe, in 1932.  It
is authored by Vidwan Raghunatha Suri.  It is apparently a critic of the
Madhva school.  The book has a foreword by Vidwan Digambara Sastry who was
born in a Madhva household and later 'converted' to smArta tradition after
having studied and convinced himself of the shAnkaran vedanta.  Here is a
link to the foreword, about 8 pages, downloadable too in pdf:

Here is the link to the Vol. I of the book from DLI:

I understand the whole  book, in a single volume, was also printed.
