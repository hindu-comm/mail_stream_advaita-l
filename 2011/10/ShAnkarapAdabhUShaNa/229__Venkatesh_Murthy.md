Namaste

Even though there is Taratamya of Gods in Dvaita Siddhanta they give a
high status to Siva and not hate him. In Mantralaya near Andhra
Karnataka border there is Raghavendra Math.  They have a big Siva
Linga there . There are lakhs of devotees going to the Matha every
year. There is a Samadhi of Madhva Samnyasi Raghavendra Tirtha.  True
they don't say Siva is equal to Vishnu. But they don't hate him. There
is a town of Dharmasthala. Here the God is Siva and Archakas are from
Madhvamata.

There is one scholar here in Advaita,  Shrisha Rao . He can give
correct position of Dvaita on Siva Puja.
