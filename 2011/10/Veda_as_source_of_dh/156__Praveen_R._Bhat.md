I'm just wondering about what the terminology "people who know dharma"
means. To my understanding it perhaps means those that follow the tradition
(of dharma). Then naturally, the question would arise as to where did they
learn the dharma from? Tracing back in the tradition, I'd assume that it
would lead to one rishi or another, which would mean shruti.

mImAMsakAs hold that even smritis are based around a lost/untraceable Vedic
injunction and equally valid source of dharma. When they are 'perceived' to
be opposing, they prefer the shruti.
