These injunctions are apparently contradictory. Apparently, because their
subject is directed to different people and different results.

Although he mentioned after counting two pramANa-s, this sUtra is not
pointed at conflict of two pramANa-s having different strength. So he says
tulyabalavirodhe. Otherwise he must have said virodhe.
And if he had said that he must get attacked by opponents who can prove that
only conflict is not enough to consider two sentences authentic. As is in
the case of knowledge of rope and snake. We don't say that both are
authentic. So is here.
