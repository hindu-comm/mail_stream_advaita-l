Now, by extension, even this could be said to have its source in the Veda
itself:
आत्मनस्तुष्टिरेव च।      मनुस्मृति 2.6

Kalidasa's words
सतां हि संदेहपदेषु वस्तुषु प्रमाणमंतःकरणप्रवृत्तयः।

For in the Taittiriya words quoted below, we have what precedes these words
is:

अथ यदि ते कर्मविचिकित्सा वा वृत्तविचिकित्स्ता वा स्यात्
'[In case you have a doubt as to how you should perform a particular action
or as to how you should conduct in a particular situation] then the
conduct/behaviour of the noble minded living in that place/time will be your
guide.'

Now, when someone consults these 'sat' puruShas it is most likely that
their  advise will contain, among other things, with reference to certain
situations, 'I would listen to my inner voice' and go ahead with the
situation.'  सतां हि संदेहपदेषु वस्तुषु प्रमाणमंतःकरणप्रवृत्तयः has a one to
one correspondence in the Taittiriya to the extent that : those people the
Upanishad asks one (the graduating student) to consult/observe are 'sat
puruShas'.  In the course of life, in day to day matters, even those sat
puruShas will encounter situations where doubt arises as to a particular
method of conduct and they are unable to get clarification through the other
sources and finally settle for the guidance of the inner voice. The word
'विचिकित्सा’ of the Upanishad is 'सन्देहः/संशयः’.
