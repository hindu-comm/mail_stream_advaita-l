namaste,

Members (still) interested in this thread may look at the first first
couple of pages of Kane's treatise (with the footnotes including the
references to anushaana-parva, vanaparva and shaanti parva from
mahabhaarata)

One may find the even the three fold classification in by baudhaayana
in Kane's book.

Here are the references from mahAbhArata:
http://sanskritdocuments.org/mirrors/mahabharata/itrans.htm

>From anushaasana-parva:

vedoktaH paramo dharmaH smR^itishAstragato.aparaH .
shiShTAchIrNaH paraH proktastrayo dharmAH sanAtanAH .. 5..\\

Almost the same reference appears in vana-parva:

vedoktaH paramo dharmo dharmashAstreShu chAparaH .
shiShTAchIrNashcha shiShTAnA.n trividhaM dharmalakShaNam .. 78..\\

and shaanti parva as well.

namaste
Ramakrishna
