Sureshvara provides logic to support his views. Even then considering him
biased shows bias in questioner.
Apastamba's sUtra-s are not very clear because they are alpAxara and he is
not producing any logic too. So, considering his unclear statements more
appropriate is only useful if one has bias towards AchAra-s(definitely free
of veda-s are constituents of it as veda-mUlatvam was not accepted by
poster). Now motive behind bias should be checked.
