Actually they are.

That's just because it's easy to follow others. Study of dharma is not so
impressive. When we see studied dharma in practice, we easily follow them.

No text torturing.
But, understanding commentary is essential.
Even if you don't want I present it here for others :

1)
pauruSheyI vyavasthA samayaH...........samayamUlA AchArAH samayAchArAH.
teShu bhavAH sAmayAchArikAH. evembhUtAn dharmAn.
(Arrangement made by human is called samayaH. Conduct arising from it is
samayAchAra. And the dharma arising from it is sAmayAchArika-dharma.) Here
is no difference in us.

2)
kiM nu bhoH samayo yadi pramANam idamapi pramANaM bhavitumarhati - 'chaityaM
vandeta svargakAmaH', 'prAgeva bhu~njIta', 'keshAn lu~nchet', 'tiShThan
bhu~njIta', 'na snAyAt'- iti.
tatrAha - dharmaGYetyAdi. n brUmaH samayamAtraM pramANamiti. kiM tarhi.
dharmaGYA ye manvAdayaH, teShAM samayaH pramANaM dharmAdharmayoH.
(If samaya=arrangement made by human is pramANam=valid mean of knowlede of
dharma-adharma, then words of every human will become pramANam. So,
bauddha-Agama-s as 'one who longs for svarga should worship chaitaya', etc.
will become source of dharma.
To avoid this Apastamba says- Arrangement made by humans, manu, etc. who
know dharma, is pramANam and not of others. So source of knowledge of dharma
are 'arrangements made by knowers of dharma'.)
Here is clear that me and you are not taken as source of knowledge of
dharma.

3)

(Q. How did you know that manu, etc. are knowers of dharma and buddha, etc.
are not ?
If you say that buddha, etc. can not know dharma because it's out of reach
of senses.
Then it's true for manu, etc. too.
If you say that manu, etc. can know transcendental things because they know
dharma.
Then it's true for buddha, etc. too.
As is said :
If buddha knew dharma, then how could you say that kapila didn't ? If both
knew then why did they differ?
So, you have to propound difference of manu, etc. and buddha, etc.
So he say - vedAshcha.
cha shows determination.
Only veda-s are original authority on dharma and adharma.

Here again commentary says that :
If two things have same force and a conflicts arises between them,
then you can choose any one of them.
Words or AchAra of manu, etc. are in no way have same strength as words
called veda-s possess. Why ? Because they are apauruSheya.
