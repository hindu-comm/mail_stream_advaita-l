No.
It is true that no other pramANa has same force as veda-s.
Even in this condition 'tulyabalavirodhe vikalpaH' is not uselss.
How ?
It is useful when we see conflict between two shruti-s, or two smR^iti-s or
two shiShTAchAra-s.
As 'atirAtre ShoDashinaM gR^ihNAti' and 'nAtirAtre ShoDashinaM gR^ihNAti' -
shruti-s have conflict and they have same strength. So, we get that both
case are valid options.
So, sUtrakAra didn't commit any error by writing this sUtra and commentator
was showing use in this specific sense which can be logically supported.
