Well, this puts the charge of mutually contradictory injunctions to this
infallible
source of dharma i.e., veda. No reply why this infallible and apaurusheya
veda
shoud give mutually contradictory injunctions.

Besides Gautama mentioned immediately before this sutra two pramanas,
Veda and sistachara. From context it is reasonable to assumed that he is
taking
about a conflict between them.

Sarma.

So, sUtrakAra didn't commit any error by writing this sUtra and commentator
