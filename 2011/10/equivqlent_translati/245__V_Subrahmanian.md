The term 'shraddhA', generally connotes 'faith', 'vishvAsaH'.  However it
takes somewhat different meanings, shades, in different contexts.  For
example 'sharddhA' is a member in the शमादिषट्कसम्पत्तिः which itself is a
member of the साधनचतुष्टयसम्पत्तिः.  In this context the term gets a very
precise definition:

शास्त्रस्य गुरुवाक्यस्य सत्यबुद्ध्या अवधारणा |
सा श्रद्धा कथिता सद्भिः यया वस्तूपलभ्यते ॥

// Acceptance by firm judgment as *true* of what the Scriptures and the Guru
instruct, is called by sages Shraddhaa or faith, by means of which the
Reality is perceived.//

Thus shraddhA in the context of the shAstra is the firm conviction that what
the scripture and the Guru say is indeed true; it cannot be otherwise.  That
'satya buddhi' (satyatva buddhi)  in their words is shraddhaa.


The vyAkhyA on this Vivekachudamani verse itself by Sri Chandrashekhara
Bharati SwaminaH glosses 'avadhAraNA' as nothing but ''dRDha-vishvAsaH'. It
also expounds ... "guruNA vedAntaishca bodhyamAnam vastu vishvasiti --
idam evam eva -- iti".  Gita 9.3 is also quoted, and bhAShyakAra
glosses 'ashraddhadAnaH' there as 'AtmaGYAnasya dharmasya asya svarUpe
tatphale ca nAstikAH'. This again, is in line with the
kaivalyopaniShad where Swami Shankarananda glosses 'shraddhA' as
'AstikyabuddhiH'.


In the context of the mantra/Rudra, the firm conviction that the chanting of
the mantra will indeed bless me with chitta shuddhi by cleansing me of the
sins forms the basis for the person's taking it up for japa.

Finally, Apte gives the following meanings: 1. Trust, faith, belief,
confidence;
2. Belief in divine relevation, religious faith; 3. Sedatenss, composure of
mind; 4. Intimacy, familiarity; 5. Respect, reverence; 6. Strong of vehement
desire; and 7. The longing of a pregnant woman. And, Monier Williams: faith,
trust, confidence, trustfulness, faithfulness, belief in, ..., trust,
confidence, loyalty, ..., wish, desire, longing for, desire of eating,
appetite,
the longing of a pregnant woman, curiosity, purity, respect, reverence,
calmnes
or composure of mind, intimacy.

Hope this makes it clear that SraddhA means faith.

I have only culled out relevant portions from earlier discussions in this
List and presented them here.

Other meanings for the word 'shraddhA' can be seen from '*अश्रद्धया
हुतं*दत्तं तपस्तप्तं कृतं च यत् । असदित्युच्यते पार्थ न च तत्प्रेत्य
नो इह ॥ २८ ॥


श्रद्धया देयम्, अश्रद्दयाऽदेयम्....(तैत्तिरीयोपनिषत् शीक्षावल्ली)
etc.
