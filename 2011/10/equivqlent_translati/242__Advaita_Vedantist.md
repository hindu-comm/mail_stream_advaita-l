First of all my prostrations to the Adhi Guru!


With my limited understanding, let me try to translate.


shraddA - It can be roughly translated to "Devotion".

The word "Shrardham" is derived from "Shradda" which means one has to
perform this duty with utmost devotion. The rough translation for
"Shrardham" is "annual obsequies".




Regards,
Advaita Vedantist
