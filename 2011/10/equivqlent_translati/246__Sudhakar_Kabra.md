Namaste,
There is no exact english translation of the meaning of the word Shraddha in english.
It is loosely defined nearest as faith, but actually implies much more.

Rabindranath Tagore defined faith as: 
A bird that feels the light and sings while the dawn is still dark.

Joe Goldsmith defined faith as:
A belief in a thing which you don't know until you come to know of it.

In other words faith is a sort of a belief but shraddha is more in the sense that it has a part of becoming in it along with the belief.
Regards
S.Kabra
