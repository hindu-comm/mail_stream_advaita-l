// All the pain of longing and all the bliss of fulfilment are mirrored in
its glowing symbolism. The perfection of Knowledge is combined with the
ecstasy of devotion. And yet this most heartfelt of poems was composed from
the standpoint of the devotee, of one who is still seeking.//

//Only Brahmacharis of the most ardent nature and ascetic people like Suka
Maharshi, who described it to Parikshit and in the recent years Ramakrishna
Paramahamsa can appreciate that relationship and pronounce upon its
uniqueness. //

Any 'bhAva' is only induced.  BrahmabhAva is alone natural to a being.  All
such induced bhAva-s only aim at some or the other level in the
recognition/realization of one's natural BrahmabhAva.  And it is only the
latter that obtains for ever.  Advaita does not recognize or postulate any
'loka' after the death for the Jnani where one or several of these
cultivated bhAva-s persist.  For all non-advaitic schools the survival of
duality compels the postulation of loka-s like Vaikuntha, Goloka, etc.
Advaita has no such compulsion.  Brahmavid Brahmaiva bhavati.  The knower of
Brahman remains as Brahman.
