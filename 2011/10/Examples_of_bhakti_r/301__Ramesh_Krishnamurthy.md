Response:

The moment you talk about "nature of brahman", you are talking about
sopAdhika brahman only.

>From a pAramArthika standpoint, there can be no inherence of names and
forms. If names and forms were inherent, duality would be inherent too, and
then there would be no way of being liberated from duality.

>From a vyAvahArika standpoint, you can say that names and forms are
"inherent", but than that pertains to sopAdhika brahman or mAyA shabalita
brahman that is abhinna nimitta-upAdAna kAraNa of the jagat.
