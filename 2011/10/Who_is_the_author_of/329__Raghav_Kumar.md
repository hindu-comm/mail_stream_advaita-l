Is it shrI sadashiva-brahmendra svAmI or is it shrI sadashivendra sarasvatI ?

We have
1. The composer of popular songs like "mAnasa sanchara re, brahmaNi",
"pibare rAma rasam" etc., composed by Sri sadashiva-brahmendra svAmI
who was an avadhUta

2. The author of yoga-sudhAkara vRtti on the pAtan~jala yoga sUtra-s.

3. The author of a brahma-sUtra-vRtti, and treatises like
siddhanta-kalpavalli on appayya-dIkShita's siddhAnta-lesha-sangraha.
etc.

Are they all the same ?

Thanks in advance
Raghav
