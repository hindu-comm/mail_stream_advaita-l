I don't know what is written there by other people or what is your ability
to grasp. But, if you read different posts, then it is clear that
apauruSheyatva is proved by anumAnam. anAditvam too is proved by anumAnam.
And validity of any knowledge was tested there. We went to test meaning of
validity and means to determine it. At least I told all these things in
different threads(which branched from that) in reply to different people.
Although people say it was cryptic.
