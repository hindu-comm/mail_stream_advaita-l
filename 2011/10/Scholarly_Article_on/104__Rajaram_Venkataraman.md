Dear Shri Ramesh, I respect your faith but your assertion that Vedas
are the authority in matters related to dharma and moksha is just
that. You can believe that it is a pramana like pratyaksha. But the
opponent will say no because Vedas are learnt through pratyaksha and
interpreted through anumana. Ours is an attempt is to see if we can
establish Veda as pramana using principles of logic.
