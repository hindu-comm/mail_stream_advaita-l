Shri Omkar, while Prof. Witzel, Prof. Madhavrao Deshpande are
anti-Hindu and work with missinary agenda, there are a number of
academicians who are objective and even pro-Hindu. There are
academicians at Oxford who are Hare Krishna devotees.

But even for those who are objective, there is no scholarly paper
defending the traditional position that Vedas are valid as a source of
knowledge and not just the opinion of few rishis in the past.
