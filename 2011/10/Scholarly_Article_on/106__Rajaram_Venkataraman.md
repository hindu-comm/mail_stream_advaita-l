Dear Ramesh, I started this thread to know if there is a scholarly
approach to establish Vedas as valid. The best argument I saw was Sri
Vidyasankar's that  it is axiomatic truth. Sri Ragahv's arguments help
in expanding it. Of course, one could take a statement in the Vedas
and say it is not true as per pratyaksha or anumana. We may need a
case by case defence. Sri Lalitalalita believes it is defendable using
pratyaksha and anumana. If it is postulated in clear terms, that will
be better than axiomatic truth approach. Regarding your stand that it
is a pramana like pratyaksha or anumana, a traditional position that
we all know, will work when you preach to the choir. An opponent will
easily dismiss it saying that Vedic ideas were opinions of different
rishis and learnt through pratyaksha and interpreted using anumana. If
you can show that they are wrong, I will happy to hear.
