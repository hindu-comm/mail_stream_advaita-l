In principle, I am not saying anything different from what Vidyasankar said,
both in this thread as well as in the other one on apauruSheyatva. In fact,
what Vidyasankar said was merely a restatement of the traditional position
using different terminology and imagery.

Now, if you understood what Vidyasankar said, then your quest is futile. If
you did not understand it, well, we cannot say anything more.

Thanks
