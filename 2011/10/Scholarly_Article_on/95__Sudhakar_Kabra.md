Namaste shri Raghav ji.

Whatever may be served by these devatas, other egyptian / tantrika philosophy may have their own means and vaidikas have their own.So, I think the end result is what matters rather than the existence of the same or different devata and with the same name or other.
An equivalent of Hapy could be Indra who brings rain (instead of flood) and fertility to agriculture.

Our Indian philosophy is full of innumerable devatas, so much so that it cannot be visualized. (Some say 33 crores devi devata) There can be an equivalent but with a different name and form, who knows. The research of devatas residing in deva loka is a deviant from the results what the scriptures ultimately proclaim to say- ekam, advitiyam.

S.Kabra

SrI Satish Arigela ji
Namaste

I have a question for you. Devata-s like gaNapati are found in Tibet,
China etc., and let us assume that they were independently arrived at/
communed with, by adherents of those respective cultures and did not
get there as a result of cultural effusion.

My question is regarding the vice versa : what would be the attitude
of a vaidika/tantrika towards devata-s from other cultures who do not
seem to have any obvious counterpart within the Vedic scheme of
things.

For example:
http://www.ancientegypt.co.uk/gods/explore/main.html

An example: "Hapy" was a god represented as a man with a pot belly,
shown with water plants on his head; he was especially important to
the ancient Egyptians because he brought the flood every year. The
flood deposited rich silt on the banks of the Nile, allowing the
Egyptians to grow crops.

Will such a "god" be accepted as valid devata-s ? Or is he merely a
cultural artefact corresponding to the annual flooding of the nile and
such a "god" has no ontological significance ?

For the record : I am basically sympathetic to the idea of such
devata-s from other cultures. But then what would be the appropriate
position on this question for a vaidika ? For a tantrika ?

Hari Om
Raghav.

Because people from other cultures and Hindu-like religions experience some of the devata-s in similar, if not in the same manner as upAsaka-s from the Hindu world. And the best part is, the experience of the deities as also the effects of rituals involving the invocation of these deities can be repeated with same or similar results.
