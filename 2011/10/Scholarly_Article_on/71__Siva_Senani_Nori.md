>The argument is that Vedic view is primitive on objects that the senses can perceive. Vedas are not blamed for silence on a subject such as computer science. They are accused of being wrong on a subject such as astronomy.

- Can we have the specific instances? To my knowledge, the Vedas do not say anything wrong about astronomy; nor is the word maanasa-putra used in the Vedas. Both these instances are from outside the Vedas - from books on Jyotisha and Puranas / smritis, which are not Vedas.

>It is not only the Christian missionary scholars who said this but nitya agnihotirs such as PV Kane and Ganapati Sastry. 


- This is a different topic altogether: Times Make the Man or Man Makes the Times.

- Even if an Indian, a nitya-agnihotri (? - I doubt Kane was one in a strict sense) to boot, says these, the answer that we are only dealing with a sample is valid.

> of scrutiny. I am discussion with an expert on astrology on predicting share prices. He says he is able to achieve 70% accuracy. I want to get it to the levelof 100% accuracy.


- I do not think it is possible* or desirable. The traditionalists say that Vedic rituals today do not yield results with that level of accuracy due to errors in procedure.

* It is said Parvati devi has cursed those capable of 100% true prediction with instant death, if the future were revealed. They might know, but are forbidden from speaking it out.
