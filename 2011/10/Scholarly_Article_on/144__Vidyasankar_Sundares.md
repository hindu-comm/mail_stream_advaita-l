However, every time somebody gets married in front of a fire, using the veda
mantra-s, every time a child is named using a vaidika ritual, every time a
cremation is done, the major and minor gods of the veda are worshipped.

That may be so, but on the flip side, do consider that even after Alexander and
his army came all the way into north-west India, no one, either on the Greek side
or on the Indian side, thought of the gods of the Greeks as being essentially the
same as the deva-s of the veda. For the Indians, the Greeks were yavaNa-s and
they were alien avaidika people, while for the Greeks, the Indians were distinctly
alien too. The world had to wait for about 2000 years after Alexander, for the
idea to emerge that the ancient Greeks had a lot in common with the vaidika
heritage of India. 

The point I'm making is that if ritualistic Indians have changed a lot from the age
of large rAjasUya-s and aSvamedha-s, that is something that has been intrinsic to
the religious and ritual reality of the said people, not something that was imposed
on them extrinsically.
