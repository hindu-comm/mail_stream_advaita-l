**  I am afraid you have totally misunderstood my post. At no point did I
accept your contention that sRShTi dRShTi vAda (SDV) in general faces any
"aggressive questions" from science or any other source. Also, I mentioned
dRShTi sRShTi vAda (DSV) only as a radical example to illustrate the
flexibility inherent in advaita-vedAnta with regard to using various
prakriyA-s in accordance with the needs of the student.

SDV also is not a monolithic method and can be expressed in many different
ways, and so I don't quite agree with the way you characterize SDV.

Anyway, since we have deviated from the topic of validity of the veda to
causation theories in vedAnta, I will respond soon in a separate thread.
This is turning out to be a good discussion :-)

Thanks
