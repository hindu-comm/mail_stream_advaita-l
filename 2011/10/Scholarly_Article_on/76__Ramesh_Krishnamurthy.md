Namaste Raghav-ji,

One more point regarding your "red lines" B & C. To be frank, I don't even
remotely relate to what you are talking about. Please note that the Indian
philosophical tradition in general (vedAnta included) considers the mind to
be "material" only. If you don't consider the mind to be "material", you are
already outside the realm of Indian philosophy. One may differentiate in
terms of sthUla, sUkShma, etc but it is matter nonetheless.

Thanks
