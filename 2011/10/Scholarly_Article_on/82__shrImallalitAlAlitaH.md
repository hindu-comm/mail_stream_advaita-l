Sorry for not being clear.
I've no post regarding apauruSheyatva of veda-s on my blog.
That's correctly pointed by your friend.

But, I didn't ever say that I've those.
I said that there is a big essay (book) by swAmI hariharAnanda saraswatI jI
(karapAtri ji) on these subjects. It was published in two volumes, each
containing 700+ pages. You can see that for logic supporting apauruSheyatvam
of veda-s and refutation of dayAnanda(Arya-samAja), max muker, etc.
