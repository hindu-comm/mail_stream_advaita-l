Namaste.

In the Book 'sridakshinamurtistotram' Vol.1 we have  considerable material
on the topic of 'Veda' from p.446 to 470 with copious quotations from
shruti, smrti and bhashyas and other rare traditional commentaries.  The
subtitles found are:


   1. Veda vAk

      2. Eternality of Vedas - apauruSheyatva
      3. Veda - vivarta of Brahman; Chit aspect predominant; Basis of all
disciplines.
       4. Veda - Consciousness delimited by modes of the mind
       5.  Eternality of Veda in the primary sense
       6.  Veda - Ananta, Nitya, Svatahpramana, Consciousness Itself.
        7.  Fantastic theories about Vedas set at rest
        8.  The One endeavor of Veda - Revelation of Brahman-Atman
        9.  Veda is Bahmavidya, Upanishad, Mahavakya

This formidable array of topics dealt here could certainly make for a
'scholarly article' on Vedas.
