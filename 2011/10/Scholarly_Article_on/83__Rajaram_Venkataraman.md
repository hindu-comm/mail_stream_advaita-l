I was perhaps not clear on what I wanted. It is easy - sort of of - to
establish pratyaksha and anumana as pramanas. Empiricism relies on
observation of facts about the external world and logical inference. For
objects that cannot be seen with naked senses (e.g. electrons), one can come
up with a hypothesis which can be validated through experimentation
(observation) and it becomes a theory. We can build on theories to come up
with complex theories.

Now, there are unseen entities (devas, isvara, results of karma, other
worlds etc.). The existence of these and theories about them are based on
Vedas, which have been accepted as axiomatic truths. I am less concerned
about apaureshyatvam or anaditvam of the Vedas. I am concerned with

How do we logically establish?


   1. There are super-sensuous entities such as the Devas
   2. Vedas are pramana for studying these super-sensuous objects
