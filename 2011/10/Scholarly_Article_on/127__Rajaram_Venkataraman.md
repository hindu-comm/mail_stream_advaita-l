I already agree that we can treat vedic statements as axiomatic truth
and defend dharma. I also agree with your inference that one cannot
assign authorship to rishis against their own claims. Of course, the
logic of the opponent in assigning authorship has to be logically
refuted, which is fine.

Now, you mentioned that we will re-interpret the sastras in the light
of new data. How is this a genuine intellectual approach? The
knowledge conveyed by Vedas yesterday cannot be different from the
knowledge conveyed today or tomorrow. It is like Christians saying
that Bible talks evolution (intelligent design) only and we
interpreted incorrectly all along.
