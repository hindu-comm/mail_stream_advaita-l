Namaste Rajaram,

It's good that you have mentioned the underlying reasons for your quest. In
principle, I think many on these forum will appreciate and even share your
concerns. That includes me. However, any approach that you take needs to be
in consonance with the systems you are trying to defend. The approach you
have been taking so far is technically flawed as we have tried to explain.

Now, this does not mean that nothing can be done to address your concerns.
However, I don't think the issue of pramANatvam is relevant to your
underlying concerns, at least not in the manner you have approached it so
far. As Vidyasankar suggested, if you come up with a more specific set of
issues that you would like to be addressed, it may be possible for the
members here to offer some useful suggestions.

Thanks
