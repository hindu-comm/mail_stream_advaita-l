I didn't think what was being asked pertained to a statistical analysis. It
is up to those who want to go down this line about the veda-s, to clarify
exactly what it is they expect.

A scientist thrives on coming up with multiple hypotheses to explain an
observation and goes with the one that makes most sense. Now therein
lies the crux of the issue. What makes sense to one depends a lot on
what one's assumptions are.

There is science and there is technology. What keeps humanity happy
is technology. More often than not, science leads to sleepless nights
for a negligibly small percentage of that humanity! There is a sort of 
arthakriyAkAritva involved in how people relate to science and its
effects on human society.

Yes, which is why, at least to me, focusing on the apaurusheyatva or
otherwise of the veda-s and talking about their status as a pramANa
for right knowledge, and addressing everything at only a philosophical
or an intellectual level is a futile exercise for the kinds of purposes that
people seem to want. Addressing the weakening of the kalpa tradition
and other such ends are not achieved through a lot of talk and lengthy
essays on why the veda is valid. It requires people to take the veda as
valid, as a given, and then to work to strengthen those aspects of its
ancillary traditions that are within their ambit. This cannot be achieved
through a constantly defensive attitude towards what exactly Sruti
addresses and how it relates to our lives today.
