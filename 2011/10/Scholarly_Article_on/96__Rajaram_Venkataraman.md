I re-read the posts on apaureshyatva of vedas thread. The crux of the
mainstream argument is that apaureshyatva, anaditva and validity of the
Vedas are axiomatic truths. It is beyond logical proof. This is akin to the
argument in ISKCON.

Q: How do you know "Krishna is God"?
A: "Scriptures and saints" say so. More importantly "Krishna" says so.
Q: Is it not circular logic?
A: No. It is not. It is beyond logic.
Q: Well ... all claims will be equally valid. Is it not?
A: If you are sincere, you will not believe any claim. You will only accept
the truth as that alone will produce real effect (bliss).

You can replace what is within quotes with different beliefs. IMO, it would
be worthwhile to go deeper in to the Mimamsa argument on eternal association
of word and its meaning. I would like to understand what the commentaries
say. I say this because if it can be showed logically that an object is
nothing but information, then it is matter of showing that there is a
logical argument for existence of undistorted information. To show that
Vedas are such knowledge or how to test if a particular knowledge is truth
are important but secondary problems. Any thoughts?
