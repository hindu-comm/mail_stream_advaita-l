You said about article. It's like a book.
Anyway, consider to have a look at vedArthapArijAta (2 volumes) of swAmI
hariharAnanda saraswatI (karapAtri jI). It will be enough for you as he has
collected views of mImAMsaka-s, bauddha, naiyAyika-s, all.
He has other works in hindi too to support validity of vedas. I don't
remember their name as I never read hindi works.
In all his works related to veda-s, he attempted to refute bauddha-s,
naiyAyika-s, etc. as well as Arya-samAja, max muler, etc.
