Opponent: "Do Vedas have any authority? They are just the opinions of
ancient poets". We dont accept the imaginations and thoughts of modern poets
and writers as an truth or sacred. Of course, we recognize the value of
their thoughts. Then why should we accept the opinions and writings of the
Vedic seers are sacred truths? If it is down to belief, then it is like any
other belief system.
