Namaste Raghav-ji,

Your presentation is quite misleading. None of the three so-called "red
lines" you mention is in any way a red line.

vedAnta negates the idea of causation, or rather, it aims to get us out of
our tendency to think in terms of objects and their causes. In the interim,
it may favour one method over another for pragmatic reasons, but that does
not make any of them a red line.

Secondly, on the issue of consciousness, there is a significant variation
among various thinkers (scientists and philosophers alike, both past and
present) at the problem definition stage itself. Very often, what they mean
by consciousness is similar to what an advaitin would mean by terms like
manas, buddhi or antaHkaraNa. Scientific study relies on objectification and
causality. Obviously, the AtmA which is unobjectifiable cannot be studied
through scientific means.

Trying to understand advaita using more of the "via negativa" tools may
bring more clarity on these matters.
