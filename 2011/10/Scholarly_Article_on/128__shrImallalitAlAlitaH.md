Not like this.
veda-s are pramANa for dharma and brahma only.
Because they are pramANa-s, they can't conflict any other pramANa.
But, if you insist that they propound other things too...
then as long as they don't conflict they are treated as valid and not
otherwise.

Show me bias to prove it malicious.
I already said that I don't discover any rule for my comfort. I get data and
deduce them. I don't create data.
So, from such reading I know that we treat a pramANa valid till it is not
negated. So, where is error in my approach.

Correct.

Not so is the case of veda-s. You can understand now.
We never said that any conflict is possible.
Why ?
You know now.
