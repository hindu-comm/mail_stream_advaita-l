*The argument is that Vedic view is primitive on objects that the senses can
perceive. Vedas are not blamed for silence on a subject such as computer
science. They are accused of being wrong on a subject such as astronomy. *
**
*If the theory of evolution is true, then there is no room for saying that
Brahma created manasa putras such as Narada, Sanat Kumara and Sapta Rishis.
This means that we cannot claim to belong to the gotra of a particular
rishi. *

*If someone pays for IVC treatment, they will expect certainity in getting
the child. If someone spends on creating artificial rain using modern
techniques, they will expect certainity. The question of the sceptics is why
cannot Vedic Yajnas be subjected to the same level of scrutiny. I am
discussion with an expert on astrology on predicting share prices. He says
he is able to achieve 70% accuracy. I want to get it to the level of 100%
accuracy. *
