I don't think so.
As long as you have faith(as is of a specific poster) because of habitual
use of eyes, etc., you feel like this.
As soon as you go to determine definition of pramANa, you start feeling
difficulties in establishing eyes, etc. as pramANa-s.

That's where it's a faith-system.
The observation on which this Empiricism relies is to be attacked first. Why
should we consider that observations are correct ? Why are you so faithful ?

Repetition is not a way to determine validity of observations. Even wrong
things are seen to be repeated and right ones neglected.

I don't think that hypothesis comes first, i.e. without or prior to
observations.

True for our system too.

Unseen = Not experienced by eyes only ?
Then count smell, sound, softness, etc. too. Why are you going so far to
deva-s, etc.

What do you say about existence of smell, etc. ? And theories based on them
?

For now it's OK. It's not needed at present.

Remove "logically". Logic is not needed to determine colors, etc. Eyes, etc.
are enough. Logic comes to support when one gets doubt about them.

As we establish entities as smell, etc.

As we establish nose, etc. as pramANa-s for smell, etc.
