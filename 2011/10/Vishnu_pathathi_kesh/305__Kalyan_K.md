Respected members,

According to tradition, Sri Adi Sankara visited Tirupati temple and composed
the *Vishnu pathathi keshanta stotra* that describes Lord Venkateswara from
the foot to the head (source: www.kamakoti.org). I want to know where I can
get this stotra and its translation.

Thanks
Kalyan
