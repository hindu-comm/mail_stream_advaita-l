Dear Sri Venkatesh-ji,

> There is no story of Adi Sankara visiting Tirupati in the Sankara Dig Vijaya.


I borrowed a copy of the Sankara-vijayam of Sri Madhavacharya. The book has
a commentary in Telugu by Sri Devalapalli Sivaramayya. In the panchadasa
sarga, it mentions that Sankara visited Venkatachalam. Here is the part of
the sanskrit sloka that mentions this - "anugruhya sa venkatachalesam".

I do not know sanskrit to understand what this exactly means (though it is
easy to see the reference to tirupati), but the commentator Sri Sivaramayya
(roughly) says that Sri Sankara performed ekantaseva for Vishnu in
Venkatachalam (tirupati) and he wrote the Vishnu sahasranama bhashyam at
that place. However, there is no mention of the Vishnu pathathi keshanta
stotra here.

Regards
Kalyan
