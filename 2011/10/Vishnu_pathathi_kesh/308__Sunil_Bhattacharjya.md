Om Namo Bhagavate Vasudevaya

Dear Kalyanji,

I think the "Visshnu padadi keshanta stotram" describes Lord Vishnu though Lord Venkateswara is also Lord Vishnu. The following part appears to show that this stotra is not describing the particular attire in which Lord Venkateswara is adorned.

दिक्कालौवेदयन्तौजगतिमुहुरिमौसंचरन्तौरवीन्दू
त्रैलोक्यालोकदीपावभिदधतिययोरेवरूपंमुनीन्द्राः।
अस्मानब्जप्रभेतेप्रचुरतरकृपानिर्भरंप्रेक्षमाणे
पातामाताम्रशुक्लासितरुचिरुचिरेपद्मनेत्रस्यनेत्रे॥४०॥

May the eyes of the lotus-eyed (Vishnu) protect us; the eyes which the sages say are the Sun and the moon who circle this world day and night and give us the sense (knowledge) of space and timeand provide the three worlds with light, which shine like the lotus, the glances from which are full of compassion and which are beautiful with light red, white and black colours

Namaste Sunil-ji,

Thanks a lot for the link.

I have a question regarding the stotra - Is Sri Shankara describing the
general form of Vishnu or is he describing the murti of Lord Venkateswara
here?

Best Regards
Kalyan
