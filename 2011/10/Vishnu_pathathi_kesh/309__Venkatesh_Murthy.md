Namaste

There is no story of Adi Sankara visiting Tirupati in the Sankara Dig Vijaya.

There was a dispute about Tirupati if it was Vishnu or another God
like Devi or Subrahmanya.

Ramanuja settled to dispute and said it is Vishnu. But Adi Sankara
lived before Ramanuja.

If Adi Sankara knew it was Vishnu and said that in the stotra why was
there a dispute in Ramanuja's time? What did Ramanuja do?
