Namaste Sunilji,


*********************

Will you like to see what the fifth Veda says. 

Lord Vishnu tells Manu in Matsya purana (52.6) "Jnana arises from Karma and that is why it (karma) is parampada. Realization of Brahma comes from Karma-Jnana and Jnana cannot arise from Akarma." Therefore the Lord asked Manu to become Yuktma in 
karma in order to understand the principles of spirituality. 

The transliterated Sanskrit verses are as follows:

////

KarmayogodbhavaM JnanaM tasmattat paramaM padam
KarmajnanodbhavaM Brahma na cha JnanamakarmaNah

//

Pls re-check the above translation of the verse. I smell something wrong here. 

How can Jnana arises from Karma. Jnana-karma samucchaya vada has been refuted by Sankara & it's parampara. 

The sloka takes off with"karmayogodbhavaM". So, the translation should be 
inline with this.

regs,
sriram
