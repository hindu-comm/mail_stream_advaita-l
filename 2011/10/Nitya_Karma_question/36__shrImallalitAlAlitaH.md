non-performance by anyone, either saMnyAsin or others, is abhAva. And both
are addressed by sha~Nkara.

As saMnyAsI are not bound to do karma, so non-performance itself doesn't
exist in their case.
Only those, who are adhikArI of karma and don't perform, can be said to be
non-performing.

Let us take some laukika examples to understand the matter.

There are differences.
In case of karma and pratyavAya :
that truck = pratyavAya was left by you
and you gave speed to car
So, abhAva of brake is not the cause of accident, but your deeds.

On the other hand, if there was no need to brake in the first place (because

No need just means that you have no pratyavAya.
But, even saMnyAsI-s can say that they have no pApam left.
Only those pApam-s, which bar shravaNa, etc, are accepted as absent in them.

Police officer can't work 24 hours and he surely doesn't. So, are you going
to punish him for every minute ?
Definitely not.
Whenever, he knowingly lets bad things happen, he is punished. So, it is not
his non-performance of karma again. He is punished for letting bad things
happen. He is actively involved.

Yes, it's logical.
non-performance leads to pratyavAya and doesn't generate.
When we don't perform nitya-karma in prescribed time, we indulge in useless
talks or other bad things. So, it will result in pApam
And according to sha~Nkara : as we don't perform nitya karma at times, it
will not destroy our sa~nchita-pApam and hence we will face duHkham.

That's not true.
It is abhAva even then.
abhAva can't become bhAva for specific people.

Correct.

It applies to others too.
