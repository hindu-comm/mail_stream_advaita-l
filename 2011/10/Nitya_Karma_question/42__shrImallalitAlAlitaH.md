What have you given him, which makes him indebted ?
For any transaction, you give services to others, and they pay money. Both
are positive.

That's OK.
But, there is some difference in case of karmas.
I leave it on you to find.

And even if I accept you view :
Even then ,
we are talking for a karmin
he does karma because he wants lokas
so,
from his point of view non-performance is not positive entity
and
hence it will not get him positive entity called pApa.

To show shama, dama, etc. as nivR^itti, shrI vArttikakAra says this too.
sarvaGYAtmA points it as accepted view. That's because they assume that
kAma, krodha, etc. are natural to us.
In the same way nitya-karma-s belong to loka-kAmin by default. So, if he
doesn't perform them, it's abhAva of dharma.

I don't recollect anything like that.

Haven't seen anything like this.

There are, clearly, which are said in smR^iti-s, purANa-s, etc.
smR^iti-s say how should a woman and shUdra live. They tell fruit of this
too.

Your talk gives impression that there are no puNya-pApa other than that is
collected in this birth.

That's not true.

Because,
jIva-s are anAdi,
they do karma-s and get puNya-pApa,
they got accumulated,
of these puNya-pApa which are collected over many births only a part which
is ready to bear fruit comes and determines next birth,
not all karma-s become prArabdha for other birth because agnihotra, which
has svarga as result, and brahma-hatyA which has naraka as it's result can't
bear fruit in a single life,
moreover, there will be no sa~nchita in this case,
and
if you think that total puNya-pApa cause next birth, then you should count
puNya of AchAra too here and it will being you to aikabhavika-matam which is
well refuted by AchArya.
