Any proof for supporting ekAgratA ?
We have no veda-vakya to support your view.

nitya-karma result in pApa-xaya according to 'dharmeNa pApamapanudati' and
in pitR^iloka according to 'karmaNA pitR^iloka'. So, my views have strong
support.

yaGYena vividiShanti- shruti doesn't say that yaGYa, etc. are done for
ekAgratA. It says that they are done for jiGYAsA or GYAna.
So, sadananda's views are not correct.
For upAsanA too, he presents 'tapasA kalmaShaM hanti'. It also disapproves
his view about result of upAsanA. upAsanA is meant to destroy pApam.
Remember, words say what they say. What you understand other than their
meaning is inference and that can not be presented as scriptural evidence.

I can understand that pitR^iloka-prApti, vividiShA and pApa-xaya, all are
results.
But, from where comes avAntara, mukhya differentiation ?
This definitely depends on kartA.
If he performs nitya karma to generate vividiShA.
If not, then pitR^iloka-prApti is destined.
If he doesn't care both, then sa~nchita-pApa-xaya is result.
So, you can say that there are three different results and they can be
obtained by performing same karma by people with different motives.
There is no case of avAntara, mukhya here.
