The comparison of debt and loan to bring up a kid is pretty bad.
If a parent is expecting to get back what all he did to a child to bring him
up and more (shradha) that is a business transaction just like a bank. Love
does not
expect anything back, in bakti also loving God with out expecting any thing
back
is the big principle.

So if you are going to demand the next generation to do Shradha that it self
is pApa,
you will incur sin. I have read in many places that you do your duty and
whatever you get is a prashad from Ishvara. So if the parent consider giving
birth and bringing up kids is a debt, they are not worth it IMHO.
