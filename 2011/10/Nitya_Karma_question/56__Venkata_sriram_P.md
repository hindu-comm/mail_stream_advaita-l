Dear Vidyasankarji,

////

I don't have an edition of the Matsya Purana with me, but I suspect the last quarter
of the verse quoted above should be "na cha jnAnam akarmaNaH". 

//

You are right. The sloka runs as:

karmayOgOdbhavaM jnAnaM tasmAt tat pramaM padaM
karmajnAnOdbhavaM brahma na cha jnAnaM akarmaNaH

This is in-line with Sankara Hridaya. 

Which is why Bhagavatpadais extolled as:

shruti-smriti-purANAnAM AlayaM karuNAlayaM ...

regs,
sriram
