Namaste

In addition Shankara makes the following points about nityakarma:

1. non performance of nityakarma will not cause papa (introduction to
Taittiriya Upanishad Bhashya)
2. performance of nitya karma will remove papa and jnana will emerge
(introduction to Taittiriya Upanishad, Taittiriya Upanishad Bhashya 1.11)
3. performance of nitya karma will lead to mukti via mental purification
(Taittiriya Upanishad Bhashya 1.11, Bhagavad Gita Bhashya 3.19)
