KK: I am sorry I don't know of any from the shruti. I don't have as much
references from the karma kanda too. I would be glad to know if there is
shruti pramana to show the disagreement with Shankara's view.

OK.

KK: While it is a mandate for people of the 3 varnas to perform nitya karma,
there are also others like Shudras, women and nastikas who seem to be very
comfortable facing their pratyavaya. As long as one is a ashrami, one should
not abandon the nitya karmas.

KK: The keyword is 'especially'.
