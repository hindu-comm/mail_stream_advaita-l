I don't have an edition of the Matsya Purana with me, but I suspect the last quarter
of the verse quoted above should be "na cha jnAnam akarmaNaH". This verse says
that jnAna arises from karma-yoga (not from karmA directly; there is indeed a vast
difference between being a karmI and being a karma-yogI) and that jnAna does not
arise merely from the non-performance of karmA. This is all quite in keeping with
gItA 4.18 teaching of the karmA that is there in inaction and the freedom from karmA
that can be there in action.
