Namaste ji,

I find your views consistent with mine generally, except the following which
I would like to clarify:

1. karmaNA pitR^ilokaH - is the shruti which says that karma result in
achievement of pitR^iloka. This is opposed to sha~Nkara's view apparently.

KK: Why is there a compulsion to confine the above reference to 'karma' as
nitya karma exclusively? Why can't it be generally seen as it encompassing
all karmas including kamya karmas? Shankara mentions generally 'karmas such
as the agnihotra' for the above quotation of yours. (see Brhadaranyaka
Upanishad bhashya 1.5.16).

2. You are supporting view of sha~Nkara that non-performance doesn't harm.
So, how could you hold this ? You need to explain- is what I meant.

KK: I am supporting the view of Shankara because it is logically tenable and
consistent with the Upanishads (Shankara quotes Chandogya mantra 4.2.2 for
his support). The non-performance of nitya karma will allow the pratyavaya
to manifest. Therefore, the non-performance DOES no harm. However, we can
take the view that the non performance does harm PASSIVELY in that it does
not mitigate the manifestation of pratyavaya. So Shankara is not wrong.
Please reconsider your position.
