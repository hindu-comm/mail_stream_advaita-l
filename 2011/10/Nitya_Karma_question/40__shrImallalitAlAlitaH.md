Nope.
animitte vihitaM nityam karma.
nitya karma is that which is prescribed (by veda-s) independent of any
trigger.
as 'aharaH sandhyAmupAsIta'.

Now, 'jAyamAno vai brAhmaNastribhirR^iNavAn jAyate' - shruti which says that
traivarNika-gR^ihastha has three R^iNa-s is not a vidhi-vAkyam. So, nitya
karma are not done by it's effect.

R^iNa is abhAva because it is counted as negative.
You have R^iNa - this doesn't mean that you have some positive entity. It
means you don't have that much amount.

pitR^i-R^iNa is abhAva of putra, R^iShi-R^iNa is abhAva of svAdhyAya and
deva-R^iNa is abhAva of yaGYa.
How ?
Same as debt of Rs. 10 means lack of that amount.

Women, shUdra have no debt ?
Not these one, at least. It comes to you because you follow a system which
takes you higher and you have more responsibilities.
Women, etc. have limited reach to this system. They have other rules to
follow and different responsibility.
You can see this type of division in daily life too.

such a RNa is the cause for pApa-phala accruing to us because of

>From where you learnt that R^iNa causes pApa ?
You will need some scriptural proof.

R^iNa being abhAva of son, etc. can't produce pApa. It being abhAva of
sAdhana=means(son, etc.) bars achievement of lokas(pitR^iloka, etc.) which
are acquired by those means.

shruti saying 'karmaNA pitR^ilokaH' says that son, etc. are means of
pitR^iloka, etc.

Even accepting that our "worthy" meritorious

You can now understand that lack of specific means is called as debt. So, it
is not some positive entity which we possess.
These debts are accepted for traivarNika-gR^ihastha only.
Why ?
Because brahmachArI, vAnaprastha and saMnyAsI-s have no right to produce
progeny, etc.

My question is : Is the concept of

This is for sakAma-gR^ihastha-traivarNika and it comes to him because of
desire to win loka-s, 'putreNaiva jayyo',etc.

Another question on karmaNa pitR-lokaH  : What happens if a gRhastha is

Lack of agnihotrAdi will give room to pratyavAya-s to bear fruit.
AchAra, etc. will bring their fruit as puNyam. That puNyam will cause
svargAdi.
But, which will come first depends on force of pApa and puNyam.

The following somewhat extreme reference comes to mind -  Manu smriti XI.41

Knowingly neglecting shows that he is not sincere. So, it is so.

Although it seems like this here, there are vidhi-s which prove that karma
one can take you to pitR^iloka. So, that too is true. For pUrtta and dattam,
I'll need proof to say that they too can do it independently.

What about those who do not have eligibility

If scriptures say then yes. If not then no.

If so it does seem to impose a greater burden on traivarNika-s seeking to

This is the question which is raised by tAntrika-s mostly.
They say that leave vaidika-path and come to us. Ours is easy path.
But, that's not true. Being against shruti is enough to reject them. And the
part in which they don't against veda-s, they are accepted to bear fruit but
with more burden.

Can a person attain pitR-loka without doing agnihotra provided he has good

You will need some scriptural proof.

They are not shiShTa, hence they are not example for vaidika-s.

mAnasam karma is mainly prescribed for those who don't have money, etc. but
want to get same result as with karma.
As ashvamedha-upAsanA.

P.S. As an aside - bhAShyakAra indicates that a gRhastha who performs

Wrong.
AchAra which has died can't give birth to anything.
So, you must accept that puNyam generated by them does it.

AchAra is accepted by us as generating puNyam and hence is a part of
religion. So, you may reconsider use of word secular.
