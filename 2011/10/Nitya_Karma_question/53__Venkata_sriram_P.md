Namaste,

So if you are going to demand the next generation to do Shradha that it self
is pApa,

//

Let us not bother about pitru karmas & shraddhas as of now. 

Whatever be those rituals, ultimately it boils down to "feed the hungry" parents.
Am I right? Can't we do this much justice to our parents, 
being born as responsible sons? 

Our 365 days (1 year) is equivalent to 1 day for pitrus. And the poor people,
wait in hunger for 3 morsels of rice !! By doing shrAddha every year, we are feeding
our hungry departed parents everyday. 

If a son is sensible enough to understand the pangs of hunger, he would never fail to
perform shrAddha. 

I think, the thread of pitru karyas should be stopped. 

sriram
