I hesitate to bring up this topic again, but it is clear that you are completely
missing the point, so here is one last effort.

Whose pApa? Simple question - most probably, your great grandfathers and
grandfathers performed SrAddha for their ancestors and expected their next
generations to do it too. In your eyes, were they therefore sinners?

Forget about your children, focus on YOU for the purposes of this discussion. 
The point is not that you bring up a child expecting him or her to repay the
debt to YOU. The point is that YOU are indebted to a long line of ancestors,
starting from YOUR parents. A ritual observance such as a SrAddha is a
means to acknowledge YOUR indebtedness.

YOU inherited your name and property from your parents. YOU got a body
because of your parents. By giving birth to YOU and bringing you up, they
did not actively put you in debt, but you are nevertheless indebted to them.
Think of it as a gift, not a loan. In either case, it involves something that is
GIVEN to YOU, for which there is a way to express thanks. 

If you have read in many places that you do your duty without worrying
about results, please go back to those same many places and find out
WHAT your duty is in the first place, when it comes to your ancestors. 
No man has just one duty to fulfil and when it comes to a dhArmika duty,
if you care about dharma at all, go to the dhArmika sources.
