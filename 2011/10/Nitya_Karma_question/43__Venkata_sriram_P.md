Namaste,

/////
1. karmaNA pitR^ilokaH - is the shruti which says that karma result in
achievement of pitR^iloka. This is opposed to sha~Nkara's view apparently.

KK: Why is there a compulsion to confine the above reference to 'karma' as
nitya karma exclusively? Why can't it be generally seen as it encompassing
all karmas including kamya karmas? Shankara mentions generally 'karmas such
as the agnihotra' for the above quotation of yours. (see Brhadaranyaka
Upanishad bhashya 1.5.16).

I don't think the shruti vAkya "karmaNa pitrulOkaH" is opposed to shankara's view.

It is avAntara (gauNa) phala and the mukhya phala is chittEkAgrata. 

In vedantasara, while explaining the vAkya "karmaNa pitrulOkO vidyayA dEvalOkaH",
Sadananda yogi says that:

nitya-naimittikayOH pitrulOkaprAptiH avAntara phalamupAsanAnAM satyalOka prApti
iti vivEkaH

While explaining this an example is given as:

There is a mango tree. The person can enjoy the cool shade under the mango tree
and thereby save himself from scorching sun. However, this is not the objective 
while planting the mango tree. The objectiveis to taste the sweet mangoes.

So, to seek the shelter under the mango tree is avAntara phala and to taste the
sweet mangoes is mukhya phala.

Similarly, pitrulOka prApti is avAntara phala and chitta shuddhi is mukhya phala.

regs,
sriram
