Yes the last quarter of the verse is "na cha JnanamakarmaNah" and not "na cha JnanakarmaNah". There was a typo, which was corrected immediately but unfortunately it escaped everybody's attention. The Lord explains what the Karma yoga is by revealing the eight types of karmas and spelling out the "dos" and "don'ts" in the Kriyayoga. Reading of this chapter on Kriyayoga should be useful to one, who wants to know the Kriyayoga as explained by Lord himself. In the Hhagavad Gita the Lord did talk on it in short but we have to remember the exhortation that reading that the puranas for explanation helps.

I don't have an edition of the Matsya Purana with me, but I suspect the last quarter
of the verse quoted above should be "na cha jnAnam akarmaNaH". This verse says
that jnAna arises from karma-yoga (not from karmA directly; there is indeed a vast
difference between being a karmI and being a karma-yogI) and that jnAna does not
arise merely from the non-performance of karmA. This is all quite in keeping with
gItA 4.18 teaching of the karmA that is there in inaction and the freedom from karmA
that can be there in action.
