Namaste,

What according to you the translation should be?

//

The 52nd chapter of Ma.Pu. is about Karma Yoga. 

The assembled sagespose the question to Suta Muni asking him to
reveal the secrets of karma yoga.

karmayOgaM cha vakShyAmi yathA viShNuvibhAShitaM
jnAnayOgasahasrAddhi karmayOgaH praShasyatE 

karmayOgOdbhavaM jnAnaM tasmAt tat paramaM padaM
karmajnAnOdbhavaM brahma na cha jnAnakarmaNaH 

tasmAt karmaNi yuktAtma tatvamApnOti ShAshwataM
.........

So, this chapter describes the importanceof karma "yOga" and not
karma, per se.

Hope you could make out the difference. I am not pointing any blunder
in your translation. Only a single word "yoga" is missing and which makes
a hell lot of difference.

regs,
sriram
