Namaste Sriramji,

I find it difficult to have total agreement with you on the meaning of this veree. A man, who is devoted to Karma sooner or later comes to the realization 
that any Karmaphal cannot give permanent escape from the birth and death cycle and no Karmaphal lasts for ever. Even if one attains the heaven 
by means of good Karma, the happy stay in the heaven is only for a 
limited period. So is the limitation of the Vedic rites without the change of attitude. The only permanent deliverance lies in not working for 
the temporary gain through Karmaphal but in controlling and eventually giving up the desire for the short-term gains. Lord Vishnu goes on to say what are the eight types of "dos" and "don'ts" in the Kriyayuoga and also mentions about the five nityayajnas etc. That is how the Jnana dawns through Karma and that is the purport of the "KarmayogodbhavaM JnanaM". That is the way of doing Karma, which eventually leads to acquisition of Jnana, without of course accruing any karmaphal to bind the karmayogi turned karma-Jnana yogi. That journey starting from Karma ends in the attainment of the Parampada, via the attainment of Jnana. "tasmAt tat paramaM padaM". 


Regards,

Sunil KB

Namaste,

///

What according to you the translation should be?

//

The 52nd chapter of Ma.Pu. is about Karma Yoga. 

The assembled sagespose the question to Suta Muni asking him to
reveal the secrets of karma yoga.

karmayOgaM cha vakShyAmi yathA viShNuvibhAShitaM
jnAnayOgasahasrAddhi karmayOgaH praShasyatE 

karmayOgOdbhavaM jnAnaM tasmAt tat paramaM padaM
karmajnAnOdbhavaM brahma na cha jnAnamakarmaNaH 

tasmAt karmaNi yuktAtma tatvamApnOti ShAshwataM
.........

So, this chapter describes the importanceof karma "yOga" and not
karma, per se.

Hope you could make out the difference. I am not pointing any blunder
in your translation. Only a single word "yoga" is missing and which makes
a hell lot of difference.

regs,
sriram
