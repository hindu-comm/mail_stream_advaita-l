*Namaste.

In the Vivekachudamani verse 406 we have this:

मायामात्रमिदं द्वैतं*, अद्वैतं परमार्थतः|
इति भ्रूते श्रुतिस्साक्षात्सुषुप्तावनुभूयते ॥

In the commentary, Sri Chandrashekhara Bharati SwaminaH also says that the
above quoted first line is a  shruti vAkyam.  Is there any reference
available as to which shruti says so?  For, we are familiar with this line
from the GaudapadakArika, Agama prakaraNam, which is the First chapter.
However, the Madhva school holds this entire chapter as shruti.  In advaita
tradition this chapter consists of both shruti and Gaudapada's kArika-s.

Any clarification on this is welcome.

Regards,
