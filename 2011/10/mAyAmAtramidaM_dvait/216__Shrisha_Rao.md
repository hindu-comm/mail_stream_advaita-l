This is also cited by Sayana in the form:

मायामात्रमिदं द्वैतं अद्वैतं परमार्थतः |
इति माण्डूक्यशाखायां श्रुतिवाक्यमुदाहृतम् ॥

The location of the citation is found in Vidhushekhara Bhattacharya's book on Gaudapada.  These verses are also cited as श्रुति by, among others, Vidyaranya (Jivanmuktiviveka) and by Appayya Dikshita (cf. his sub-commentary under लोकवत् तु लीलाकैवल्यम्, २-१-३३), as also by both sides of the Nyayamrta-Advaitasiddhi debate.
