I would hesitate to make a sweeping accusation against Ramanuja, and at the least do not believe the instance cited is to be considered a mistake, however, because the BU's अहं मनुरभवं सूर्यश्चेति is indeed a pointer to the longer text of the RV, according to all scholars.  In contemporary editions the material from the two sources would be offset with a comma or at least a daNDa, but manuscripts and older publications do not require this, and classically well-trained scholars are quite capable, in my experience, of parsing text correctly even in the absence of punctuation.

There are a large number of manuscripts of the माण्डूक्य even now in various manuscript libraries (e.g., Tanjore) which give the extant of the same as 16 prose passages + 29 verses, and there are also commentaries in that fashion (e.g., by Kuranarayana of the Ramanuja tradition) besides quotations of individual verses or parts thereof as श्रुति.  It is hardly a matter resting on this Puranic quote.  The purpose of said quote is to answer the question of why the prose passages, which is itself श्रुति and thus completely authoritative, should cite verses in support.

I believe so by Hacker and contemporary Indologists, but I am not so sure about the classical tradition.  There is also a vicious circularity in the argument, though -- first the verses are rejected as not being श्रुति because Sankara has not cited them (आप्तकामश्रुतेः in his BSB under 2-1-33, his VC, his VSN commentary, etc., be damned!), and then they turn around and reject the VSN commentary, the VC, etc., as not Sankara's because the verses are cited in them as श्रुति.
