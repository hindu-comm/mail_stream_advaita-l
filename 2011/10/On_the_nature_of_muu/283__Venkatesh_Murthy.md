But what is there in Darkness to experience. Nothing. I don't see any
object. Only I am there.  Why say there is Dvaita ?

Same in Sleep. I am only there. No dream and no object is seen. There
is Advaita. When awake I see all objects.

> With the knowledge that I am that Brahman, the light of consciousness, the substantive that is illuminating even the darkness (or ignorance), the triad is reduced to mithyaa - and therefore ontologically of lower order of reality to count as real dvaita. Apparent duality is only apparent but not real. That understanding is realization of the advaita that is there all the time even when there is apparent darkness or ignorance. Without that realization, even though it is advaita, the apparent dvaita has mistaken as real. This gets further confirmed with the theories that says this apparent dvaita is real, as in the evolution theory that is being discussed.
