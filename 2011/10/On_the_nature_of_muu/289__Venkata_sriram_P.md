Namaste,

The nature of mUlAvidya has been beautifully explained in "tripAdvibhUti mahAnArayaNa upanishad". 

//
A few years ago a scholar in Sringeri told me that a certain person (name
withheld) has been propagating among his followers the misconceived idea
that 'tamas' (darkness) is 'tejo'bhAvaH' *तेजोऽभावः *(absence of light) and
that such is not the view of the traditional Acharyas
//

The above upanishad while detailing out the aspect ofmUlAvidya defines tamas as avidya"tamas shabdEna avidyA". 

regs,
sriram
