Namaste.

A few years ago a scholar in Sringeri told me that a certain person (name
withheld) has been propagating among his followers the misconceived idea
that 'tamas' (darkness) is 'tejo'bhAvaH' *तेजोऽभावः *(absence of light) and
that such is not the view of the traditional Acharyas.  I am reminded of
that when I read your above clarification.
