This is logical and makes sense to me.

>In addition Shankara makes the following points about nityakarma:

>1. non performance of nityakarma will not cause papa (introduction to
>Taittiriya Upanishad Bhashya)
>2. performance of nitya karma will remove papa and jnana will emerge
>(introduction to Taittiriya Upanishad, Taittiriya Upanishad Bhashya 1.11)
>3. performance of nitya karma will lead to mukti via mental purification
>(Taittiriya Upanishad Bhashya 1.11, Bhagavad Gita Bhashya 3.19)
