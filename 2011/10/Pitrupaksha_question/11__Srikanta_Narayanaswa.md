I have already answered for these statements in my posting.You are also a party to the repitition of the same in your Emails.I see that there is not only repitition in your postings,but also futility in understanding other's view points.We can only wake up a person who is sleeping,but not the one who pretends to sleep as a well known Tamil saying goes!I want you to study more deply ansd sincerely the scriptures and commentaries of SriShankara Bhagawathpada.
N.Srikanta.
