>>This is the starting point of knowing Jnana that Karmas cannot produce any result.The mundaka shruthi also substantiates this to one whao wants to know as;

It is strange, Shri Shrikantaji that you come to a conclusion that karmas cannot produce any result, and insist that upon others. 

The point proved is only that karmas cannot produce mokSha as their phala. 

Of course, everyone is aware that nitya-naimittika-karmas do not directly give mokSha but are indirect causes. Please read the naishkarmasiddhi if you want to know how niyata-karma anuShThAna (BG words) lead to moksha. nitya karma anuShThAnAt.....evam paaramparyeNa karma eva  syaad avidyaa nivR^ittaye; j~naanavat na avirodhitvaat karma avidyaa.n nirasyati. Hence jnAnavat karma api pAramparyeNa avidyA nirasyati.  

By shunning karma, you will only become akarmi and how come you see karmani akarma. akarmanaH karma jyAyaH. 

Do nitya-naimittika karmas, attain chitta-shuddhi and then start understanding things in proper perspective.
