First of all my prostrations to the Adhi Guru!


Per my understanding, the following are the key ceremonies in Vivaha (who
follows South Indian Smarta tradition):

1) Kanniha Dhanam
2) Paanigrahanam
3) Sapta Pathi
4) Mangalya Dharanam


What are all the ceremonies in Sama Veda Vivaham (based on Drahyayana
sutra)? Is there an authentic book on this subject (English/Tamil/Sanskrit)?



Regards,
Advaita Vedantist
