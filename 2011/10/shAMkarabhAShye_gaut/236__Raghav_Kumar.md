Rough translation:
Here in the (shAnkara) bhAShya, Rishi Gautama, the composer of the
NyAya sUtra-s is referred to most respectfully as "AcArya". Although,
from the point of view of philosophy, it (nyAya philosophy) is refuted
(by SrI Sankara) at various places, (yet) in accordance with the
aphorism "paramata vipratiShiddham anumatam bhavati" , "that
(particular) view of the opponent which does not contradict (our
view), is acceptable (as our own view itself.)", it can be observed,
in this context, that there is appreciation (i.e., praise) of that
portion of the opponent's philosophy which is not in conflict (with
the advaitic position).

My question: Is there any traceable source of the aphorism, "paramata
vipratiShiddam anumatam bhavati" ?

Thank you
Raghav
