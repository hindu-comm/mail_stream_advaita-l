According to wikipedia, in 1966 one of the Shankaracharyas fasted to bring
in ban on cow slaughter. Is that so? I am keen to know if Shankaracharyas
have, if at all, voiced concern about cow protection. I know that Shankara
Mutts have goshalas. But I am no sure if there is an serious official
position by the mutts on this topic.
