Your comment is quite pertinent.  I also banked upon the adhyAsabhAShya
sentence '.....sarvANi cha shAstrANi vidhi-pratiShedha-mokShaparANi.'  For
this sentence the RatnaprabhA vyAkhyA says:  //tatra vidhi-niShedhaparANi
karmashAstrANi RgvedAdIni, vidhi-niShedha-shUnya-pratyagbrahma-parANi
mokShashAstrANi vedAntavAkyAni iti vibhAgaH.//

Dear Balasubramanian,

The Amrtabindu upanishad contains the second quoted passage even as the
Brahma bindu upanishad (?) has this passage.  These two upanishads seem to
be the same, with two different names. However, the first quoted passage  -
यथा ह्ययं ज्योतिरात्मा विवस्वानपो भिन्ना बहुधैकोऽनुगच्छन् ।
  उपाधिना क्रियते भेदरूपो  देवः क्षेत्रेष्वेमजोऽयमात्मा । इति । is not there
in the Amrta/brahma bindu upanishad.
