Dear Sri Harsha,

There are no universal answers to these kinds of questions. In general,
the considerations to be applied would relate to the sa-gotra and sa-piNDa
relationships with the deceased, but every community and region has its
own customs that they follow when it comes to weddings. The best people
to ask such questions of would be the elders in the families (older women
typically tend to be the most informed and informative in Indian families)
and/or the priests who have historically been employed by the two families.
