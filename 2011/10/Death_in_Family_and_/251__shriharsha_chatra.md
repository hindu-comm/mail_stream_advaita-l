Dear Members,

What is the custom followed if there is a death in a family and marriage to
be performed.
I understand the rule of arranging a marriage of a daughter with in a year
and Son after the year of their parents death.
Does the same rule holds for other family members, whiz paternal uncle,
uncle's wife and others.

Thanks in Advance for your feedback.

Thanks,
Harsha
