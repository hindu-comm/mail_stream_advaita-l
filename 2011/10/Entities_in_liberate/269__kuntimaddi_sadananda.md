Shreee Rajaram, PraNAms

First jnaani does not become Brahman - a finite cannot become infinite - mathematically impossible. 

What scripture says is you are Brahman. Becoming is has to be understand as understanding that I, who think I am finite by identifying with upaadhiis, am indeed is Brahman, the infinite. It is just clear understanding of a fact. In that understanding, I understand the world of objects that I see is mithyaa has not real existence as in dream state. The jiiva-jagat-Iswara the multiple entities all reduce to mithyaa only and therefore one plus many apparent are one only. The appearance due to mithyaa is also understood as vibhuuti - first as that of Lord and with the understanding of oneness sinks in as vibhuuti of myself since myself is the self in all. sarva bhuutastam aatmaanam sarva bhuutanica aatmani.

If a jnani becomes Brahman but not Isvara, then there is a contingency
that there are multiple entities (Isvara and Brahman) in the liberated
or transcendental state. Or Isvara, who can bestow liberation, is not
liberated because He is different from Brahman. How is this resolved?
