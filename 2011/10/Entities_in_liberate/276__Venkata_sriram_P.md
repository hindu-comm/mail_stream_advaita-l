Namaste,

/// Ishvara is independant of jiva:
According to advaita, jiva is indeed ishvara. //

Accordingly to Advaita, even the Ishwaratva is also a "bhrama".

Lakshmidhara Kavi in Advaita Makaranda says:

//
upashAnta jagatjIva shishyAchArya-Ishwara-bhramaM
svatasiddha manAdyantaM paripUrNa mahaM mahaH
//

There is only brahman. "brahma satyam jagat mithya / jivo brahmaiva na parah"

This is the only truth in Advaita.
