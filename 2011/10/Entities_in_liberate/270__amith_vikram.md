According to your view, your question should be: If a jnani becomes
Brahman but not Isvara, then there is a contingency
that there are multiple entities (Isvara and Brahman and jnani). In
the liberated state, if you take out jnani, then ishvara is also
discounted because the locus of ishvara is jnani/jiva.
