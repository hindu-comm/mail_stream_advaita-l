Correct.
It's aha~NkAra or chit-jaDa-granthi.

Correct.
He has no veil of mAyA, so he is treated as knower.

Here you got the point. This is what we are saying.
Actually brahman alone is knower. Although, he is called jIva, Ishvara, etc.
due to upAdhi-s.


> But Brahman is neither a knower nor otherwise.


This statement is correct for only shuddha-brahman and not for
upahita-brahman.

Nope.

I don't think that shruti can say anything opposed to logic. So, she also
says knowing = becoming.

Yes.

True.

Thinking is not knowing.

Having no ignorance is called knowing in case of brahman.
It happens in waking state, true.
Knowing destroys aGYAnam and no sleep is possible for mukta.
sleep, etc. are seen in jIvanmukta-s. But, that is because avidyA-lesha is
accepted till prArabdha-xaya.

No bond is possible for jIva.
Why ?
Because, mAyA is bond and jIva is creation of mAyA.
So, who is bound ?
Brahman apparently.

mAyA is bond and it's destruction is called liberation and both of them are
of brahman.
You or janaka are said as bound or released because both are brahman.

Different from GYAni ?
Are you saying that :
Are there two brahman-s ?
If not, then they are one.
If yes, I'm sorry to say that this problem is not related to
advaita-vedAnta.
If you want to say that :
there are two upAdhi-s, antaHkaraNa and mAyA ,
then yes unreal difference is accepted. But, remember - unreal difference
can  not be said to existing.
