Why not look at it another way? Whether you think you have only one janma or an
infinite set of pUrva janma-s, within this current janma, you can only worry about
this current janma. It is a fallacy to think that moksha is not possible in present life
itself. If this were the case, then we could never talk of jIvanmukti. saMskAra-s
are nothing more than a shorthand descriptive mention of things we think, say and 
do, they are not prescriptive nor restrictive. 

I don't see why a question of multiple pUrva janma-s vs. single janma defeats the
place of karma and jnAna in a moksha mArga. Please elaborate.

Everyone wants an easy way out and there is no dearth of organizations to provide
the semblance of one. Go with the true and tested and you won't get misguided.
