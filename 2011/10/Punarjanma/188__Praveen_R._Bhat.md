Hari Om,

One should be thankful that Ishvara as a karma phala dAtA has been kind in
letting us be affected by only the prArabdha part of our karma in this life
of ours and not the entire sa~ncita! That should give us hope that
jivanmukti is here and now in this life. Why worry of past and future lives
& piles of karma since they don't affect this life?

praNAm,
--Praveen R. Bhat
