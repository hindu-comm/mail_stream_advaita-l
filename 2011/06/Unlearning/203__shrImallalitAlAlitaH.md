That attempt was to say that shAstra-prAmANya doesn't need to be validated
by laukika-experiences everywhere. It was a reply general to all attempts of
explaining shastra out of it's context and free will.

The word 'YOU' was for a person attempting to seek relaxation by explaining
it accordingly. It was not particularly for you.
The word 'imagination' was to show options regarding your views and not you.
It was not used to show any decision about you. Moreover saying one's views
imagination is not an insult.
Again 'non-believer' was used for a person going for sagotra-vivAha and not
for you. You were the person suggesting flexibility for him only.

I don't think asking questions regarding one's views is against any maryAdA.
For uses of particular words, I've already provided my explanation.
If saying my views strongly is wrong, I'll be amazed.

I think the word 'blindly' will be against sabhA-maryAdA if the word
'imagination' was ???!!!

This post is to make my stand clear and not to continue any useless and
hurting debate.

I don't want to hurt you. So, sorry for that which I caused.
