Thus, the jiva is essentially free from all three guNas.  However, as long 
as he is alive, the
play of the guNas is unavoidable as the body-mind complex is itself a 
product of prakRti.  In the liberated state however the Atman is ever free 
of all guNas.

Hare Krishna

So, the absolute liberated state (triguNAteetatva)  can possible ONLY 
after 'maraNa' of this bhautika shareera (physical body) is it?? mukhya 
mukti can happen ONLY after shareera pAta & whatever mukti we get when 
jeeva is sashareeri is kevala gaUna !!??  I think this is what the 
impression we get from the above statement.  But we have to note that when 
krishna says : guNa guNeshu vartante, nishtraiguNyO bhavArjuna etc. his 
intention was not to explain the state of maraNOttara or dehAntara...A 
jnAni is ashareeri, guNAteeta (ever detached from prakruti) only though he 
is looking alive with body-mind complex.  ihaiva brahmaiva san 
brahmApyeti, na shareera pAtOttarakAlaM clarifies shankara in bruhad 
bhAshya. 

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
