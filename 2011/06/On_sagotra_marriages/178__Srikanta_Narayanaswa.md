With reference to sagotra marriages,many marriages are sanctified now a days without properly verifying the Rishi lineage.for example,the pravara has three rishis in the chanting.for Ex.Angirasa,Barahaspatya,Bharadwaja.....Some times other pravara may start with Angirasa but with some other gotra.even these marriages are prohibited on the same lines.But,now a days this has been overlooked many a time.
N.Srikanta.
