The gItA bhAShya gives some clues on his hostile attitude towards some 
devata-s 
widely worshiped in shaiva, smArta and to some extent in vaiShNava 
circles.

Hare Krishna

Yes, shankara says worshipping vinAyaka & mAtru gaNa (sapta mAtruka-s) is 
'tAmasik' in nature.  However, elaboration & further explanation of these 
bhAshya vAkya-s by saMpradAyavit-s is that shankara refuting here only 
tAntrika devata-s which have been worshipped by sAdhaka-s in vAma mArga. 
But unfortunately no bhAshya support for this...but there are various 
beautiful hymns on vinAyaka & devi attributed to shankara bhagavatpAda.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
