Namaste:


You may very well be correct, but History of Dharmashastra P.V. Kane, 
Mahamaaopaadhyaaya citravashastri, mahamahopaadhyaa lakshmanshastri as 
well as Mahaadeva shastri Joshi attribute the pa~nacaayatana puujaa to 
Shankaara.


It is possible that this case may be similar to attributing all puaraaNaa's to Sage Vyasa.

Any authentic or authoritative references would be certainly be helpful.and appreciated.

Having said all this one cannot help but appreciate the efforts of "advaita" followers who depersonalized the conventional iconic humanized representation with various deities using stones from gaNDaki, narmaada ......... etc. 
Does this not contribute towards the use and practice of advaitic principles for creating a harmonious society?

Udasi sect also follows something similar philosophy:

The Udasi sect follows the Panchayatana traditions. These followers, like mainstream Sikhs, believe in Sri Guru Granth Sahib (Sacred Text of the Sikhs) which the Udasis interpret according to Vedanta philosophy and therefore take part in both Nirgun Pooja (of reading 
Gurbani from Sikh texts and fixing the mind on the omnipresent, 
indescribable and infinite God,

Shri Jaldhal Vyas had provided the associated shloka for various pa~Nacaayatana puujaa:

i seriously doubt shankara's relationship with pa~nchAyatana. Most likely this came after shankara.

There is no evidence to say he united various cults.
