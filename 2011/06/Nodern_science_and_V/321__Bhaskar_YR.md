How different are those who take the claim of him being a 
ShaNmatasthApanAchArya?

praNAms
Hare Krishna

If shankara bhagavatpAda is indeed shaNmatasthApanAchArya, why he 
advocated worship of ONLY 5 deities in paNchAyatana pooja??  Why he 
omitted shaNmukha, though he has taken three members of the same family 
(devi, shiva, gaNapati) for the paNchAyatana pooja!! Kindly note, I am not 
sarcastic here.  I really donot know the answer for this, would be 
grateful if anyone clarifies this doubt.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
