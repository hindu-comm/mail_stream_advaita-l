Dear Sriram garu,

>I remember telling you that it is saguNa murti nirAsana.

If it is saguna mUrti nirAsana, then why pick tumburu rudra/shiva, mAtR^ika-s 
and vinAyaka in specific?

Furthermore, if we see the context, it is clear that the discussion is not 
saguna vs nirguna at all

>Had he developed hostile attitude
>towards vinayaka, why the ratnagarbha ganapati is being worshipped in sringeri?

That is because the worship of various devata-s like shrIvidyA etc were 
incorporated at a later time as can be inferred by his comments in the bhAShya.

By hostile attitude I mean belittling the worship of the above mentioned 
devata-s or in other words painting those devata-s as tAmasik.

Regards
