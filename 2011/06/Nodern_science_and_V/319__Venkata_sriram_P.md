Namaste,

/////

i seriously doubt shankara's relationship with pa~nchAyatana. Most likely 
this came after shankara. There is no evidence to say he united various cults.

//

Can you explain the meaning of "ShaNmatasthApanAchArya" or
it is another adjective that was coined by later indologists.

You say that he developed hatred towards one of the deities in panchayatana and
i can make out that which according to you is shakti. 

Doesn't Sankara respect pariNAmavAda in BSB as the step to reach upwards.
