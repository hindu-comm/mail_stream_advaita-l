Precisely. The "explaining away"(opposed to offer an explanation) that happens 
when observed seems to come from an urge to show there is no difference of 
opinion. 


The readings of tAntrIka devata-s, vAma mArga etc., into the bhAShya at this 
juncture is completely out of context and is wishful thinking at its best.

Nothing need be said about the stotra-s, when authorship of far more imp works 
itself is doubtful.
