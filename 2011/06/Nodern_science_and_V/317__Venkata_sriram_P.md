Namaste Dear Satish,

/////

The gItA bhAShya gives some clues on his hostile attitude towards some devata-s 
widely worshiped in shaiva, smArta and to some extent in vaiShNava circles

//

Before pressing the "send" button, i would request to re-consider and study the statements or else the statement like the above would send wrong signals 
among the circles.

What do you mean by hostile attitude, BTW. 

I remember telling you that it is saguNa murti nirAsana. Had he developed hostile attitude
towards vinayaka, why the ratnagarbha ganapati is being worshipped in sringeri?

bhava sankara desika me sharanam...

regs,
sriram
