Pranams It is quite interesting to know that in a family there could be two but not three brahmacharis.  Will the custom and tradition permit more than four brahmacharis in a family? This is only an hypothetical question and rarely a situation like this happens.  Will be grateful if this doubt is clarified. Have another doubt: that in Tamil Nadu among the brahmins the married ladies (sumangalis) don't cut and stitch the two ends and perhaps this applies to a grahastha as well in respect of the 8 or 9 yard dhoti one wears besides the anga vastram.  In north India, where I spent four decades, the ladies including married ladies from south who are settled there opt to trim both the ends and get it stitched (what is known as piku/peeque).  Is there a rule/convention on this please? With profound regards,

> Well, I did hear this that there should not be three brahmacharis in a house - though I do not yet know the basis. My father (we are Apastamba sutra followers) had three brothers, so I had asked whether my youngest uncle was upaneeta only after my eldest uncle got married, but I am yet to get a clear answer. Anyhow, nowadays it is rare to have four children, let alone four sons, so the question is not much tested in practice, I guess.
