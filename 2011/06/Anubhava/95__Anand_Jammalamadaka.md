What are the steps we initiate for  experiencing  the concept of Advaita

Is it possible to make a begining with this panchendrias. If so how !

Like one tries to imagine on outer circumference while being within a circle
!

Is it for mere knowledge we are discussing Advaita

What are the mental projections required to go beyond mind and manas but
taking their help at the start

How do we integrate Mahavakyas given by Sankaracharya from upanishads to
wards advaiata !
