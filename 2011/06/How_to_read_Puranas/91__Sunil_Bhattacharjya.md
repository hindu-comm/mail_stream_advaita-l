The best equivalent word for "Mimansa",I think, will be "conclusion", which one arrives at after going through the relevant scriptures.

To add to this, mImAMsa derives from the dhatu man - to think. It is the process of arriving at correct knowledge by inquiry (jiGYAsa from GYa - to know.) conducted in a logical fashion. The duplication of man indicates it is by "thinking back-and-forth" i.e. debate that this enquiry is to be done. The two mImAMsAs differ in subject matter (dharma and brahman respectively) but their intellectual approach is the same.

Just to clarify, it is at the end, the 40th and final adhyaya of the vAjasaneyi saMhitA of the shuklayajurveda.
