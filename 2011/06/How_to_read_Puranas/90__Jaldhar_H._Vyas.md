To add to this, mImAMsa derives from the dhatu man - to think.  It is the 
process of arriving at correct knowledge by inquiry (jiGYAsa from GYa - to 
know.) conducted in a logical fashion.  The duplication of man indicates 
it is by "thinking back-and-forth" i.e. debate that this enquiry is to be 
done.  The two mImAMsAs differ in subject matter (dharma and brahman 
respectively) but their intellectual approach is the same.

Just to clarify, it is at the end, the 40th and final adhyaya of the 
vAjasaneyi saMhitA of the shuklayajurveda.
