When Indians say Indian National Anthem, especially the expression "bhaarata bhaagya vidhaataa". This vidhaatha is not some one else but he himself has to decide and become responsible for destiny of the Nation. This includes practicing the concept of National hygiene, corruption and the responsibility of every citizen in every walk of life. Then only the country is likely to succeed other wise it will remain gloating in the golden concepts vedanta, which gets locked into the ivory towers of ego.
_______________________________________________________________________________-we are seeing very great "bharatha bagagya vidhaatas'now a days especially in the creation of National hygiene,elimination of corruption etc.when they cannot hold together in a commitee to root out corruption,and every politician pokes his nose to prevent itfrom taking off.God alone should descend on India to salvage it.
N.Srikanta.
