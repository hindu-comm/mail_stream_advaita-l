Kman - praNAms. I know you are not con-man. 
Just wanted to say I enjoyed reading your post. What you say is correct - in the viswaruupa darshanam,Lord shows to sides - one side all gods and the other side allrakshasaasa. These aredvandvaasand liberation from them is true liberation - says Krishna. 
Hari Om!

Most of the Advaita group members know that the nature of the world is "Yin
and Yang", that is dualism in everything, good/bad, light/darkness,
beautiful/ugly etc.
So there is no escaping whether you do science or veda or varnashrama
dharma. There is always a good side and a bad side, so it is the human
practisioners who have to be humane and vigilant to make sure that a good
thing/theory is used for good and not for bad. Some times it is difficult to
know immediately what is good what could be bad, but we need to look at
history and make course corrections where it is needed.
