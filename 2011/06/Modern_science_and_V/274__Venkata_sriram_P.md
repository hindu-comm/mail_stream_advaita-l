Dear Subbuji,

/////////////////////////////

Who is 'vinAyaka'?

There is a popular composition of Sri Muthuswamy Dikshitar in the rAga
'suraTi' with a commencement as under:

श्रीवेङ्कटगिरीशमालोकये विनायक-तुरगारूढम्...
shrIvenkaTagirIshamAlokaye vinAyaka-turagArUDham...

[I behold the Lord of Venkatagiri who is mounted on a horse...]

What is the meaning of the word 'vinAyaka' here? Does it refer to
someone/something that has no lord (vi-nAyaka)? Does the word go with the
horse or with the Lord Himself?

Regards,

Vishnu is also called vinAyaka. viH indicates pakShi (bird) which is garuda. One who
is alighted on garuda pakshi is vinAyaka. 

BTW, i am busy with my official pressures. I will get back shortly what is vinAyaka,
mAtrika gaNa & chaturbhagini svarupa in BG. 

gaNa is called samUha or cluster. mAtrika varNa mAla is a gaNa and the adhiShTAtrudevata of mAtrika is gaNapati. mAtrika varNa is classified as 
a, ka,cha,Ta,ta,pa,ya vargAs respectively who are sapta-mAtrikAs. The upAsana
of these are followed with lAja bali, tila, haridrAnna, dadhyanna etc. which is 
tamo maya. 

It is the nirAsana of such upAsana.

sriram
