with reference to the above,I have these observations:it is a well known fact that 'Inhumanism"has grown along with science.on the one hand it professes to cure and ameliorate all the sufferings of humanity,and on the other hand devises all arms and ammusnitions to destroy the human race.Though the cell phone is useful in one way,it has fallen into the hands of criminals.The scientists alos claim that it can cause cancer.
The facrication of Atom bomb is a concrete example of modern day destruction.The Chernobyl and Union carbide are further examples of what human callousness can do.
For the above,I can only quote the Isavasyopanishad.:
Hiranmayena patrena satyasyapihitam mukham!
Tatvam Pusan apavrunu satyadharmaya drstaye!!.
We are all seeing all these destructions in "Pratyaksha".It is well known now that all these cannot save India.Every one has seen what it has done to our country!.Then are we on the way to 'charvaka"vada?
N.Srikanta.
