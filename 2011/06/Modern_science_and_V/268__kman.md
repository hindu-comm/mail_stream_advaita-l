Srikanta Ji,
      Regarding inhumanism, you probably did not read Dr. Mohrir's question
on Mahabharat war and Krishna asking Arjun to fight resulting in mass death.
Is that not
"Inhumanism"?  You site Atom bomb for Science's inhumanism, remember it was
invented to stop the "inhumanism" of world war 2, perpetrated by
Japanese and German. Since then it was not used for humane reasons but for
deterrent purposes only. Remember all our Gods are depicted with a deadly
weapon?
We do not take that as "inhumanism" as we know that is intended for bad
people!

Most of the Advaita group members know that the nature of the world is "Yin
and Yang", that is dualism in everything, good/bad, light/darkness,
beautiful/ugly etc.
So there is no escaping whether you do science or veda or varnashrama
dharma. There is always a good side and a bad side, so it is the human
practisioners  who have to be humane and vigilant to make sure that a good
thing/theory is used for good and not for bad. Some times it is difficult to
know immediately what is good what could be bad, but we need to look at
history and make course corrections where it is needed.
