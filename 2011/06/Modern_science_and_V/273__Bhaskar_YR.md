Does the word go with the horse or with the Lord Himself?

praNAms
Hare Krishna

Do you mean to say shankara saying in geeta bhAshya worshipping of horse 
is tAmasik not vinAyaka as the lord??  what about the mention of sapta 
mAtruka-s ?? is there any symbolic meaning for this also??  Kindly note, I 
am not questioning this having  'my' own answers in mind, just interested 
to know how these bhAshya vAkya-s have been interpreted in the books of 
later vyAkhyAnakAra-s in advaita saMpradAya.  BTW, what gUdArtha deepika 
says here on this verse is something different I believe.  Sri Ananda 
Hudli prabhuji, any help to resolve this??

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
