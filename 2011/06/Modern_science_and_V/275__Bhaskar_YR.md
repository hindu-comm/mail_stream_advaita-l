The upAsana of these are followed with lAja bali, tila, haridrAnna, 
dadhyanna etc.  which is 
tamo maya.  

praNAms Sri Sriram prabhuji

I shall await for your detailed reply on this.  But do you mean to say 
upAsana with haridrAnna ( rice with turmeric powder) and dadhyanna (curd 
rice) etc. is tamO maya?? In that case upAsana of lalita tripura sundari 
devi is also tamO maya is it not??  Because in sahasranAma you will find 
the reference of both these anna-s.  (haridrAnnaraika rasika hAkini rUpa 
dhAriNi, dadhyAnna sakta hrudaya...etc.)  Please clarify with more 
elaboration please.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
