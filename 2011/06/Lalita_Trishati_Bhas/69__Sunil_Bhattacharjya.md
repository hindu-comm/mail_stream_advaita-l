-Dear friends,

I have been looking for the book "Lalita Trishati 
Bhashya" of Adi Sankaracharya, as translated by Chaganti Suryanarayana 
Murthy and published by the Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan.
 This book was published about 25 years ago and it is out-of-print for 
more than a decade. In fact an English translation of the 
Lalita Trishati Bhashya has been published recently from Mumbai but C. 
Suryanarayana Murthy's book is special as there is a valuable 
introduction and also added to it is the Sreevidyadeepika of Agastya, 
which is also a desirable book for the readers of the Lalita Trishati 
Bhashya. Does any member know how to get a copy of the same.

Regards,

Sunil KB
