Dear Sadaji,

///

May be it is possible to interpret modern science in terms 
of advaitic principles and gradually evolve reading matter on 
advaita more attractive for young readers.

I don't remember the exact name of the nuclear scientist. 

It was he who wrote a book on the mystic dance of Siva and compares 
the subtle vibration of atoms that are rythemic in nature with
the mystic dance ofardhanarishara (siva's tandava & devi's lasya).

Later the same scientist, while sitting on a rock nearby a seashore, contemplates
on the rythemic dance of Siva and experiences a divine vibration within himself
that is inline with the rythm of waves of sea, rythm in atomic vibration, rythm in 
cosmos. In ecstasy, he defines this as the cosmic & mystic dance of Siva. 

Later comes to India, becomes a devotee of Lord Nataraja of Chidambaram and writes 
the book on the mystic dance. 

Any clues on the name of this nuclear scientist, i would be grateful to know.

regs,
sriram
