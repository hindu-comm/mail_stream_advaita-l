Dear Sunil Bhattacharyaji,

///

It seems even the followers of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu forgot that the guru of 
Mahaprabhu was none other than Jagadvijayi Keshav Kashmiri Bhattacharya,
who gave him (Chaitanya Mahaprabhu) the Shodashakshari mahamantra. K
eshav Kashmiri Bhattacharya in turn was a disciple of Nimbarka Mahaprabhu, the exponent of Dvaitaadvaita as against Sankara's Kevalaadvaita. 
To my knowledge Chaitanya Mahaprabhu did believe in oneness with 
the Lord also. That relationship is achintya.

A bengali scholar by name Sarat Chandra Chakraborthy wrote a book in bengali
by name "bhArOtE shakti pUjA" (eng. transl. Sakti Worship in India). 

He says Nimai Pundit (childhood name of chaitanya mahaprabhu) was a worshipper 
of Mother Annapurna and was a shakta. In order to preach the bhakti for common people,
he propagated hari sankirtana. 

BTW, today's ISKON's bhakti movement is the corrupted form of Nimai Pundit's vision 
which is more of criticism on Sankaracharya and Lord Siva. It has been reduced 
to screaming & dancing on the streets. The real saints are away from pomp & show-off. 

regs,
sriram
