In Mahabharata Santanu became mad in love with Satyavati. Before that
Parashara Maharshi  had intercourse with her and gave birth to Vyasa.
How is it possible the Kanya was not mature? How can Santanu become
mad seeing a 8 year old girl?

She married Santanu after maturity only.   In Svayamvara also if the
princess did not have physical nicely developed female signs the Kings
were not mad to win them. If the Kanya is before maturity she will not
have the physical development to attract men.

In love stories of Mahabharata Ramayana and Puranas the heroines are
mature people but not 8 year children.



> Now coming to the point, kanya is defined as the girl of 8 years (ashTa varShA bhavEt kanyA). Right from the birth for 2 and half years, she is under the custody of varuna devata; next 2 and half years under the custody of gandharva and next 2 and half years under the protection of Agni Devata. So, totally, it comes to 7.5 years. So, till 7.5 years, the girl is under the protection of 3 devatas and hence kanyAdAna is performed by the father of the girl so that the 4th person would take the "responsibility of the protection" of that kanyA and the ritual ofhanding over the girl that "facilitates the transfer from Agni to the vadhu" is called pradhAna hOma which is immediately done after the kanyAdAna. Here, the bridegroom's family does the gOdAna.

The bride grinds the paddy and prepares the rice in a vessel and makes it ready for her husband's vaisvadevam. Thus, starts the sthAlipAka and grihastha dharma. They don the diksha vastrAs for 3 days and undergo brahmacharya vrata. Thus, both the bride & bridegroom pledge themselves to perform the Agnihotra without fail (yAvat jIvaM hOShyAmi).

To demonstrate this, "yugavatchidrAbhisheka" is performed ie., artha & kAma are tied with dharma only and utter the pledge "dharme cha; arthe cha; kame cha nAticharAmi".
