Knowingly this should not been done. If done unknowingly this should be condoned. However biologically ill effects may still be there if the separation is less than by seven generations.

It is also said that sometimes a girl is taken in 'adoption' by someone
belonging to a different gotra and thereby she gets that new gotra. After
that she is even married to someone who has the same gotra that she was
actually born into.

Will someone comment on the appropriateness of this practice?
