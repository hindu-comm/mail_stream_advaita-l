Then the father replied that that was the order of the day. later on that boy became a great rishi and he introduced the concept of one husband for one woman. Of course there has been exception to this rule in subsequent history but the stricture stil remains that woman should not marry more than five man otherwise she would be considered a fallen woman. I forgot the name of that rishi but some members may remember that.

> To have a clear vision of advaitic truth only, one needs to approach a competent teacher and study Vedanta for a length of time until there are no more doubts such as these you have asked.
> Advaita by definition cannot be a anubhava. It is a clear understanding that -what I am looking for is what I am already - where the seeker and sought have become one - not at physical or transactional plane- but from the plane of understanding. Going beyond etc are all figurative terms used to indicate that the truth that I am cannot be objectified; yet intensely experienced all the time, whether one knows it or not. What do I have to do to experience myself as myself? I am myself all the time, even though I take myself something other than myself. It is an understanding that I am the substratum of both the subject-object duality that is perceived or experienced in all my transactions. That is the advaita, in spite of apparent dvaita or experiencer-experienced-experiencing triad.
