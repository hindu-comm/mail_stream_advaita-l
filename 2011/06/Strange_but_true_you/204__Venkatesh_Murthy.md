We are seeing lot of marriages the Purohita is saying all Mantras of
Vara bridegroom and he is doing everything.  Vara is dumbly observing.
 Then the Vadhu bride will become Purohita's wife. One girl  from
orthodox family said the same thing when her marriage was going on and
she cannot be  bridegroom 's wife .   She caused big issue and elders
comforted  her.    All this happening  because Brahmin boys are not
learning necessary Mantras. They must learn Mantras.
