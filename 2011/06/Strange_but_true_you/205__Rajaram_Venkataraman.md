If you know the meaning of the mantra, it is said to be fully
effective. Otherwise, only half effective. If one recites the mantras
properly but does not know the meaning, then is she half-wife? Does he
have to marry the second time to "get the other half"? :)

We should learn veda karma with sraddha and out of love for dharma but
no need to go on a over drive.
