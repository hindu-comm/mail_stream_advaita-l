Dear Krunal,

My only point of critique with respect to an academic article would be with
respect to the date. With the exception of a few scholars like Kunjunni Raja,
contemporary academia does not in fact hold to the 788 CE date. Rather, the
period is left loosely defined as being somewhere between 650 and 800 CE.
Different researchers tend to place Sankara bhagavatpAda either earlier or
later within these broad limits, while allowing that one cannot get down to
more exact dates than these.

Regards,
Vidyasankar
