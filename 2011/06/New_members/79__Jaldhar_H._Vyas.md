Anand Jammalamadaka
--------------------

I am a person spiritually inclined, in search  for an alliance with related
forums.

I would like  to  jointly explore eternal truths. To seek answers without
conflicts  on this journey towards non duality. Answers I seek are  about
lateral connection between  Idoltry and Advaita ( both coming from Sage
Sankara ); real and not so real world ( Midhya )
