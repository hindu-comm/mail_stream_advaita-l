There are some Tamil books in this collection.  I downloaded three tamil
books and I liked the one on iishvAsyopanishad bhaashya and
naishhkarmyasiddhi.  upadeshasaahasri and  iishvAsyopanishad bhaashya are
written in old style tamil (will be pretty tough for people less than 50 and
exposed only modern tamil style)
