It  should be bhakti marga (bhajana) vs. jnana marga (manana on aham 
brahmasmi etc.)? The Lord clearly says that the best is bhagavat bhajana. 
Is it it not?

bhajana, upAsana, dhyAna are all auxiliary sAdhana-s prepares the mind to 
do 'direct' sAdhana-s like shravaNa, manana & nidhidhyAsana.  As per 
advaita, there is no substitute for vedAnta vAkya shravaNa, manana & 
nidhidhyAsana.  sAkshAdeva cha kAraNatvAt shravaNa manana nidhidhyAsanAnAM 
clarifies shankara in taitireeya bhAshya.  And shruti also says AtmA vA 
are drashtavyaH shrOtavyO maNtavyO nidhidhyAsitavyaH...As far as I know, 
there is no compromise on this stand among advaita vedAntins.  Sri 
chandrashekhara bhArati mahAswaminaH has talked about bhajana & nAma 
smaraNa etc. at the cost of 'svadharmAcharaNa' in the work, 'dialogues 
with jagadguru'. 

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
