Pranams. Your title I humbly submit is fallacious. Bhakti without Jnana is 
incomplete. Jnana without Bhakti is impossible. At their culmination the 
two are homologous.

praNAms
Hare Krishna

I was about to tell this :-))  The subject  line drafted in such a way 
that bhkti & jnAna are poles apart :-)) bhakti & jnAna is not mutually 
exclusive paths...Both karma & jnAna (sAnkhya),  which are the two mArga-s 
 as enshrined in the geeta have the blend of bhakti. 

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
