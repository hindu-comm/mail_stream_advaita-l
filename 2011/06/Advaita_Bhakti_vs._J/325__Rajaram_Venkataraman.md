Hare Krishna. A devotee (with dualistic or unitary vision) is absorbed
in bhakti. In BG 9.13, Lord Krishna says says that a noble minded one
worships Him, the Isvara. In 9.14, he talks about those "others" - not
so noble ones -who have the jnana that there is only Brahman. If we go
by what the Lord says here, is it not crystal clear that worshipping
(bhajanti) as bhagavan is the best, better than jnana?
