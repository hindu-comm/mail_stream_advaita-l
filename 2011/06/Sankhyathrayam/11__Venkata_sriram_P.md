Dear Mahadevan Ji,

A couple of years back, i had a similar doubt but when asked Shri Bharati Tirtha Swamigal, His Holiness clarified the sankhya-traya as:

1) ni-rIshwara sAnkhya
2) sa-Ishwara sAnkhya
3) sAnkhya (jnAna) yOga (vide jnAna yOgEna sAnkhya buddhiH...)

Also there is another birudAvaLi that comes in the 1st line itself ie., pada vAkya pramANa.

His Holiness clarified this as:

pada = vyAkaraNa
vAkhya = mimAmsa
pramANa = nyAya

Hope it is clear now.

regs,
sriram
