The wording found in the Panchaangam is:

सकलनिगमागमसारहृदय-सांख्यत्रयप्रतिपादक-
(as found in the sringeri mutt website
http://www.sringeri.net/2009/12/29/stotra/guru/guru-vandanam.htm)

This is a guess:

I think this refers to the prasthAnatraya consisting of the Upanishads, the
Brahmasutras and the Bhagavadgita.  These constitute the essence, the heart,
of the entire Vedic lore.  'Saankhya' refers to Vedanta jnAna as is found in
the 2nd chapter of the Bh.Gita: sAnkhyayogaH.

Maybe more appropriate explanations will be given by others.
