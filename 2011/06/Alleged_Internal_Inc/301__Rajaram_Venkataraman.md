Shyam, this is an excellent response. Sankara's works are like the
Vedas. It is simple and direct but allows for multiple readings
because it is packed with meanings.

I  agree with Vidyasankar's point on strong disagreements within a
tradition is not a sign of weakness but vibrancy and non-dogmatic
approach. Every sampradaya has internal differences. Baladev explains
a verse with a meaning completely different from what his guru
Visvanath does. My respect for a tradition increases when it is NOT
"my way or high way" and "one shoe fits all".

BTW, my question is aimed at learning how the sampradaya explains
internal inconsistencies - e.g. one jiva or many.
