A good piece of expression in a good English. Nice to read and imbibe into.

Thanks & Regards,

"........phantasmic representation of an amalgamation fashioned of the nothingness 
of name and form alone. Understanding this is not extraordinarily difficult, but 
owning up to this is extraordinarily daunting - the majority of us who do not, 
find it safer instead, to take cover in the impregnable fortress of a 
perennially self-imposed incomplete understanding, a passport that permits us to 
stay distracted in the samsaric shabdajala, of prodigious polemics and 
perplexing prakriyas."

BTW, my question is aimed at learning how the sampradaya explains
internal inconsistencies - e.g. one jiva or many.
