Dear Moderators,

Are there any notes available by Shri Himanshu Dave on Rg Veda Mandalas?
Is he maintaining any blog. Long time back, i saw his analysis on Devi Sukta &
Ratri Sukta but now it is not to be seen.

Pls let me know if any thesis papers of Himanshuji are available online.

regs,
sriram
