Namaste Rajaramji,

I wonder if material success or failure is a precondition.

//

Material Success doesn't necessarily mean rolling in wealth, moving
in BMW cars & living in AC rooms. 

Basically, it is the contentment & mental satisfaction which is most important. Nevertheless, certain amount of monetary help is also required to support their
family but not at the cost of sadAchAra. 

Monetary benefits either in cash or kind, if exists more than that is required for 
self-sufficiency, may lead to perversion. 

So, even though spirituality has nothing to do with materialism, monetary support 
for sustainenance is most important. You can't preach brahmasutra sankara bhashya to a hungry person whose immediate requirement is a morsel of food. 

That said, there are some exceptional people who don't care the least for a single
penny. They are truly mahapurushas on this earth. 

regs,
Sriram
