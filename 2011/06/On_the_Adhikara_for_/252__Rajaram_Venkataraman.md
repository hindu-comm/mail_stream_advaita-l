It is an interesting proposition but I wonder if material success or failure
is a precondition. First of all, the material life is like a drop of water
on a lotus leaf, always shaky. Even if one is successful, one cannot be
guaranteed that the success will last the next moment.  Let us say one has
earned wealth but that  may be lost due to theft. Let us say one has earned
health but that may be lost due to passage of time. Let us say one has
earned fame, that may be lost due to the influence of changes in time. Let
us say one has earned education but that may be proven wrong by one who is
wiser or it may be altogether lost due to disease. Let us say one has gained
friends and relatives but that may be lost due to separation and death.
There is not even one success that I can  think of that will give me a firm
foundation on which to pursue Vedanta. Arjuna pursued Vedanta, "kim tad
brahma, kim adhyatmam kim karma purushottama" in the middle of a yuddha
kshetra that was paradoxically also a dharma kshetra. The lord may arrange a
birth in the family of yogis or aristocrats to give a stable environment but
like suka or kulashekara, it seems the dawn of knowledge is characterized by
renunciation internally and externally. And fearlessness to live accepting
whatever comes unasked for accepting food, shelter and cloth as we accept
inevitable death. Until then, it is only an intellectual exercise perhaps in
the mode of goodness - good but not great enough. I am happy to corrected -
just thinking aloud.
