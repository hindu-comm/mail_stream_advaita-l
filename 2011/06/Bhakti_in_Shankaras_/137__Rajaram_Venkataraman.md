   3. What are the types bhakti?
   4. Is bhakti a modification of the mind?
   5. Is bhakti a product of avidya or is it of the nature of jnana?
   6. What is the meaning so'ham, sivoham, gopalaham etc.?
   7. Can a devotee identify himself with saguna brahman in upasana or in
   samadhi?
   8. Can a devotee identify himself with sakara brahman in upasana or in
