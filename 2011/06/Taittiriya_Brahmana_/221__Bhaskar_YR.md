Visishtadvaitis give this Sruti to say Brahma is the Material Cause
for the Worlds. What is the Advaiti explanation?

praNAms
Hare Krishna

In the light of mAya satkArya vAda, advaitins too say that brahman is 
abhinna nimittOpadAna kAraNa (material as well as efficient cause) of this 
jagat. brahmaivedaM purastAt brahmaivedaM vishvaM asserts mundaka. 
satyamabhavat yadidaM kiMcha declares taitireeya.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
