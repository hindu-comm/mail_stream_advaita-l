Whatever I'm saying is just examination of your view. I'm not advaitin here.
Shruti just says 'brahma vanam' means brama and vanam are same. It doesn't
say that brahma is cause or anything else.
Moreover, how could dyAvA-pR^ithivI get birth from forest and tree.
Existence of both stands on pR^ithivI, etc.

There is no word for wood in shruti and brahma was not equated with wood
anywhere.
Tree is not made of only wood. It has fruits, flowers, leaves, bark, etc.
So, saying 'like wood' will prove that brahma and some other things make
tree.
Forest is a group of trees and not same as trees. But shruti says that vanam
is brahma which is again tree. So, we must see whole chapter to say
something useful.
brahma = wood. wood + something = tree. tress + other trees = vanam. So,
tree = vanam = brahma is not justified.

Brahma is material of trees and forest.


as wood ?
But, shruti doesn't say anything for wood.
shruti says tree = brahma = vanam and not that brahma is material cause of
anything.

We can't break or mold brahman. We can make designs. So, this example is not
correct.
