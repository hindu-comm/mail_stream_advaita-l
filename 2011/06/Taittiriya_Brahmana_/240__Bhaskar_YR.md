I dont know what exactly is this unicode character.  If you are talking 
about the 'language' other than English.  I can able to read the mails 
written in Kannada or Sanskrit in my computer..But I dont know how to 
write my mails in that language :-) ..But most of the mails in this thread 
having the 'possible spam' tag in the subject line.  I cannot explain all 
these things to my system administrator as my ID is meant only for 
official communication.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!

I think your email client needs to be set up to handle Unicode characters.
Please ask your system administrator to do this, since I realize you don't
have Internet access.

Anyway, here is a link that can help you:
