Namaste

Because Brahma is the material of all trees and forest . Like wood is
the material for every tree and and forest is only group of trees.
Brahma is material of trees and forest. Another case is with gold we
can make many parts of necklace. Join all parts to make necklace. But
Gold is material for parts and necklace also.
