One case that is quite well known is Arjuna marrying Subhadra (Krishna's
sister) who is his maternal uncle Vasudeva's daughter.

In the Tamil culture Parvati is said to be Vishnu's sister and her son
Subrahmanya's one wife is Vishnu's daughter.  That is why he is called
'TirumAl marugan' (Vishnu's son-in-law).
