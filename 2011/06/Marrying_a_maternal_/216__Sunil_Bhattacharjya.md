It seems that the cousin marriages are not as bad as one thought. Genetic research in Otago university New Zealand shows that. In the ancient times he social out-reaching could have been probably considered more important than the other considerations.

One case that is quite well known is Arjuna marrying Subhadra (Krishna's
sister) who is his maternal uncle Vasudeva's daughter.

In the Tamil culture Parvati is said to be Vishnu's sister and her son
Subrahmanya's one wife is Vishnu's daughter. That is why he is called
'TirumAl marugan' (Vishnu's son-in-law).
