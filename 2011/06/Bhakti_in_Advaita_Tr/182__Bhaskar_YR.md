How come Sankara Bhagavatpada, whose vision reverberates with shruti vakya
"EkaM sat viprAH bahudhA vadanti", is labelled as vaishnava?

praNAms
Hare Krishna

One line of argument to call shankara as vaishNava is that shankara 
whenever talks about 'pratikOpAsana' he invariably refers to 'vishNu 
sAligrAma' & nowhere he gives the example of  shiva lingam.  And another 
line is, since shankara is himself an incarnation of bhagavAn shiva, he 
always contemplates & prays vishNu.  It is just  like shiva who is  parama 
bhAgavata, always immerse himself in rAma dhyAna !!  IMO, these are all 
some fanatic observations of some staunch vaishNavaites.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
