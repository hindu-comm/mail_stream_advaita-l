Dear Bhaskarji,

//
I think in vAdAvaLi same example and explanation have been given to refute 
the advaitic claim 'ahaM brahmAsmi'. I think Sri subbu prabhuji had 
written something in reply to this objection. But I dont remember it. 
Sorry for this digression prabhuji

It is from nyAyAmrita of vyAsarAya tirtha.
