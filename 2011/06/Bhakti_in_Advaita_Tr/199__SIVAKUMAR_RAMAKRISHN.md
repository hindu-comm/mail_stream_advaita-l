SAdara pranAmam,
There have been many jeevanmukthAs who could guide us on intriguing
problems like this.Sri Ramana maharshi,Jagadgurus in the Sringeri and Kanchi
paramparAs
are example. From there own 'experiances' of the absolute they have already
given
clear answers to many of these questions.Is n't it enough to give ear to
what
they have said just out of compassion to the ignorant one like us?
