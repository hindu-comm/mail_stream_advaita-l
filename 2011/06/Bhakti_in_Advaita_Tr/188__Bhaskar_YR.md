Have you noticed that Lord Vishu has the names of Lord Shiva in the 
Vishnusahasrama, and Lord Shiva has the names of Lord Shiva in the 
Shivasahasranama.

praNAms
Hare Krishna

And in skanda mahApurAna (??) it is said that shivaya vishuNu rUpAya, 
shiva rUpAya vishNave, shivascha hrudayaM vishNu, vishNoscha hrudayaM 
shiva, yatha shivamayO vishNu, evam vishNumaya shivaH. this is the shloka 
daily we recite during saNdhyAvandanaM along with another shloka 
AkAshAtpatitaM tOyam yaTha gacchati sAgaraM, sarva deva namaskAraH 
keshavaM pratigacchati..In short, it is like dual character played by the 
same HERO (truth) :-))

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
