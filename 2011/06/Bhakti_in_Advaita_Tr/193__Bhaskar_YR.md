Therefore, the Brahman being spoken of here is not the same as
ViShNu and must be shiva. Besides, shankara bhagavatpAda has used the word
"Parameshvara" to refer to God in his sUtra bhAShya, for example in 
1.1.17.
The term Parameshvara generally denotes shiva more than ViShNu.

You are absolutely right prabhuji.  Moreover, here, in South India, as you 
know,  whenever we say the word 'Ishwara' to denote god, we habitually 
think that it refers to shiva bhagavAn only.  For us, Ishwara devasthAna 
is nothing but shiva temple.  Sometime we  argue with our friends like 
'hey, that is not Ishwara temple, that is vishNu temple' etc. :-)) Anyhow, 
being an advaitin, we should not differentiate between shiva & 
vishNu..Whether it is vishNu or shiva, it is ekamevAdviteeya parabrahma, 
i.e our own Atma svarUpa only...sOhaM bhAvena pUjayet..if any one do not 
do that, devata-s would kick that person out :-)) devAH taM parAduH
