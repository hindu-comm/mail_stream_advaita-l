For example, when we say, "the warrior is like a lion", the warrior's 
fierce fighting is being compared
with that of the animal, the lion, which fights fiercely. It does not mean 
the warrior is the lion.

I think in vAdAvaLi same example and explanation have been given to refute 
the advaitic claim 'ahaM brahmAsmi'.  I think Sri subbu prabhuji had 
written something in reply to this objection.  But I dont remember it. 
Sorry for this digression prabhuji.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
