Dear Bhaskarji,

I think it is from Skandopanishad and not from Skanda Purana. 

praNAms 
Hare Krishna

You may be right prabhuji as I am not sure about the source. Interestingly 
in mahAbhArata, anushAsana parva or shAnti parva (not sure)  it is said 
this shiva is the srushti karta of trimurthi.  vishNu's birth happens here 
in this parva from left eye of shiva bhagavAn :-))

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
