Sriram,  Madhusudana was not a contemporary of Sri Narayana Tirtha. He lived
a century before and could not have met the latter - except in dreams.
Jaladhar, of course, you do not say that the story of Madhusudana waiting to
meet Caitanya is implausible but improbable. I dont want to discuss
probability as it is hypothetical but evaluate plausibility. Let us say
Caitanya and Raghunatha Tarkashiromani were class-mates in nyaya school from
around 1480 to 1505. Let us say, Madhuranatha was Raghunatha's student from
around 1505 to 1530. If Madhusudana went to Naavadvip at the age 10, he
could have learnt from Madhuranatha from after 1530 to 1540.

He was a contemporary of Raghunatha Dasa Gosvami, Sanatana Gosvami, Jiva
Gosvami, Vallabhaharya and other prominent saints of bhakti cults. In none
of his works, does he criticize their conclusions or quote them. The only
school that he argues against is the Madhwas. To explain this, one of my
friends who is doing research in to Madhusudana Saraswati's works says that
there is a theory that he hails from South India! As a Tamil, I dont mind
taking credit for Dravida Nadu producing this genius saint but conscience
asks me to look for data!

One professor said he will send me references to show that Madhusudana's
scheme of bhakti classification is based on Sridhara Svami's, which in turn
is based on Srimad Bhagavatham. Assuming he is correct, your position is
plausible.
