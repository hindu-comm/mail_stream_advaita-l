Hare Krishna. Madhusudana Saraswati defines three classifications of bhakti
- karma misra bhakti, pure bhakti and jnana misra bhakti. He says in his
commentary to Gudartha Dipika that the three sections of Gita refer to these
three types of bhakti. This is exactly the same classification that Sri Jiva
Gosvami defines in Bhakti Sandarbha. Was Madhusudana Saraswati influenced by
Gaudiya Vaishnavas?I would like to know if there is any reference to such
classification of bhakti by an advaita acharya prior to Madhususdana
Saraswati.
