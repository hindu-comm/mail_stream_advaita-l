Dear friends,

I have been looking for the book "Lalita Trishati Bhashy" of Adi Sankaracharya, as translated by Chaganti Suryanarayana Murthy and published by the Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan. The book was published about 25 years ago and it is out-of-print for more than a decades. In fact there is an English translation of the Lalita Trishati Bhashya, published recently from Mumbai butC. Suryanarayana murthy's book is special as there is a valuable interoduction and also added to it is the Sreevidyadeepika of Agastya, which is also a desirable book for the readers of the Lalita Trishati Bhashya. Does any member know how to get a copy of the same.

Regards,

Sunil KB
