Namaste,

According to the accounts of his life, the young Kamalanayana Mishra who 
came from a village in what is now Bangladesh, heard of the fame of 
Chaitanya and at the age of 10 decided to travel to Navadvipa to meet him.

There is another account regarding M.S from my elders. 

Shri Sadananda Saraswati, of "Vedantasara fame, was the contemporary of Shri MS.
Shri Sadananda took sanyasa from Sri Nrisimha Saraswati. Sri Nrisimha Sarasati took 
sanyasa from Shri Krishnananda Saraswati. And the lineage of Shri Krishnananda Yati 
can be traced back to Shri Vidyaranya Muni (from the list i have). This vidyaranya is not to be confused with the Sringeri Muttadhipati. 

Now, Sri Sadananda Saraswati& Sri Madhava Saraswati were guru bhais who took initiation from Sri Nrisimha Saraswati. AndMS took sanyasa from Sri Madhava Saraswati.

Moreover, Shri Narayana Tirtha of Krishna Leela Tarangini fame and Shri MS both met each other on several occassions. Needless to mention both were stallwarts in Advaita Vedanta. Shri Narayana Tirtha was also a Srividya Upasaka and votary of Srividya Rajagopala Mantra and worshipped Krishna as Srividya Rajagopala.

So, even though, their iShTa devata was Krishna and were influenced by Madhura Bhakti, internally, they were staunch advaitins.

regs,
sriram
