What is quite likely is that Madhusudana was influenced by the Bhakti
movement in a general sense, but his philosophical views were clearly in
line with the other AchAryas of the advaita school.

praNAms Sri Ananda Hudli prabhuji
Hare Krishna

prabhuji, IMHO, to advocate 'bhakti mArga' in his upadesha, madhusUdana 
might have found abundant 'bhakti rasa' in his mUlAchArya bhAshya itself. 
I think there is no need for him to get influenced by bhakti movement as 
propagated by vaishnavaites,  who are hard core dualists.  IMO, in 
Shankara's geeta bhAshya, 'bhakti rasa' is Ota prOta.  This one work 
itself  is more than enough for Acharya-s in advaita saMpradAya  to 
advocate bhakti in their svatantra grantha-s.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar

PS :  Kindly let us know whether Sri Madhusudana agrees with 'dvaita vidha 
bedha bhakti' anywhere in his works??  Is there any reference with regard 
to this in his works such as 'bhakti rasAyana' or 'advaita siddhi'??
