RV: yes. madhusudana defines highest bhakti in non-dual and vedantic.  he
refers to his own work bhaktirasayana to get more details. he also says that
bhakti is the fruit of both jnana and karma. he is not deviating from the
tradition because he says that as his statement is based on nyaya. please
refer my other post or better bhaktirasayana directly to understand why he
says that. *

RV: madhusudana, a traditionalist, does not deny that there is krama mukti
or that there is moksha through atma jnana.  in 12.5 that you quoted, he
says that a devotee attains brahma jnanam even without the instruction of
the teacher and  sravana, nidhidhyasa etc. by the grace of the lord.  this
may seem to be at war with  the commonly held opinion but that does not mean
he differs from what sankara said. but you may say that jivan mukti is not
possible through bhakti because krama mukti means going to another realm of
existence and experiencing a particula kind of glory (a golden cage). does
it have to happen only in a different world or can a devotee experience
brahma-jnanam here itself? madhusudana's answer is in the next verse. he
says that those who total devotion, I become ***in that very life itself***
the agent holding them up with ease in the pure brahman. this is the result
for one who worships Lord Vasudeva, the repository of the essence of all
beauties, the embodiment of absolute bliss, as having two arms or four arms
or as filling the flute that captivates the minds of all people with the
seven enthralling musical scales or as one whose lotus like palms are
adorned with a conch, a lotus, the mace Kaumodaki and a chakra or as having
the form of a man-lion or of Raghava (Rama) or of others or as having the
cosmic form as already revealed. through the yoga of absolute devotion.

*RV: madhusudana does not talk about any influence by vaishnava acharyas.
without positive evidence, there is no basis to such statements. in fact, I
increasingly tend to think that he was a south Indian and hence spent a lot
of time in polemics with Madhwas. *
