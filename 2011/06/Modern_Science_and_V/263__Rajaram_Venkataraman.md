The philosophy of modern science is perhaps closest to vaisheshikas? There
is a lot of intelligent work done in modern science to establish objective
knowledge and avoid all subjective experiences. There are merits and
demerits with the approach. It would be good to discuss that from the point
of view of how our acharyas dealt with this.

Few good points of modern science:


   - We have to test an hypothesis of how things work and upgrade it to a
   theory after we have "sufficient" evidence and no evidence to the contrary.
   This separates knowledge from "opinions" and "beliefs".
   - A theory should be "falsifiable" meaning that it is testable. This
   allows you to verify empirically.
   - A mathematical theory should be based on deductive or inductive logic -
   so builds on data as a founddation and valid as long as underlying
   assumptions are valid . This allows you to speculate about unseen entities.

Few bad points of modern science:


   - It is not possible to accept subjective experiences (e.g. vision of a
   divine being)
   - It is not possible to accept non-repeatable events (e.g. astrological
   prediction that may work sometime but not always)

The "bad points" are not aimed at removing delusions and intentional
cheating but nevertheless limit knowledge.
