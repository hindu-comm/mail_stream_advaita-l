शिवाय विष्णुरूपाय शिवरूपाय विष्णवे ।

शिवस्य हृदयं विष्णु: विष्णोश्च हृदयं शिव: ॥
_____________________________________________________________________________
we also daily recite the following verse during our Sandhyavandanam:
"virinci Narayana Shankaratmane".
There is a famous saying in Tamil;
"Ariyum shivanum onru,ariyadavarhal vayil mannu".

There is a song composed by Late M.D.Ramanathan,the famous carnatic musician,the disciple of Late.Tiger Varadachariar,in the raga Atana:

'Hariyum Haranum onre enru ariyadavar ullaro!
sariparthu solvare sadhu janangal sanmathiyile!(Anu)
pannaga sayanan Hari,pannaga bhushanan Haran!
Sow Bhagyalakshmi piriyada Hari,padi Umai bhagan Haran!
Pandavarkku sarathi Hari,Pasupatham kodutthan Haran!
Vendinal arulvar iruvarum,Varada dasan sol tattadu(Hariym Haranum)
onre enru ariyadavarum ularo,oru silar ulare!!

Hari and Haran are both one.Are there any one who know not.
The sadhus will findout and confirm this by their virtuous mind.
The Hari has the snake as his bed,but the Hara has it as a an ornament.!
The Hari has the goddess of wealth Lakshmi in his very heart,the hara has given his very half.!
The Hari is the charioteer for the Pandava,the Hara gave him the Pasupatha astra!
On Praying both will bestow the boons,this saying of Varadadasan will not falsify!
Who doesnot know that the Hari and the Hara are one ?But alas!a very few remain!

N.Srikanta.
