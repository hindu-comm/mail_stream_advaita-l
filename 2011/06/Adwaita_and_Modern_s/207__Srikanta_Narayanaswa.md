As the central theme of our forum is advaita , is it not posiible to
integrate various concepts , aadhyatmic thoughts , philosophies ,disussed in
our forum,into our central theme !

May be it is possible to interpret modern science in terms of advaitic
principles and gradually evolve reading matter on advaita more attractive
for young readers.
__________________________________________________________________________--The approach to Modern science is by Logic and experimental observation.the results of modern science undergo many changes and even theycan be falsified.For instance Einstein didnot get his nobel prize for his 'theory of Realativity",but for his discovery of the 'photoelectric effect".But,the knowledge of adwaita has a different approach,the insight that results from intuitive understanding.One has to approach a Guru,and must do 'sravanam,mananam and nidhishyasana.Though logic is necessary for its understanding,even logic stops at some point.the knowledge of adwaita comes from 'anubhuti'rather than anubhava.
