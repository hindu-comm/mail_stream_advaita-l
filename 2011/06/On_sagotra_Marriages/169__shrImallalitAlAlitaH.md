OK. I think the cause of niShedha is well described by shAstram. Shastras
take paraloka, puNya, pApa, etc. as real things. New generation of
commentators either negates or neglects them. Now their explanation can't be
according to original spirit and context.

If you are saying this for a non-believer of smR^itis, then it's useless. He
is free to do anything. There is no need of flexibility for it is desirable
only for a person tied with ropes of shAstram.
If it's for a faithful person, then he will chose to go according to old
explanations. He will seek flexibility according to shAstras.
parAshara-smR^iti gives relaxation at many places for people living in
kali-yuga. He will never go for any explanation arising from lust, etc.

Yes. Every flexible rule is clearly said as 'flexible' by shAstram itself.
We only need to discover. There is no need to create flexibility. Better
leave shAstram alone and go on as your mind drives.

Flexibility according to smR^itis is accepted. Any flexibility created to
make room for lust is not acceptable.

Is this your imagination or is it backed by any proof from shAstram itself ?

If you don't want to quote scriptures, then there is no need of any
discussion on these subjects as these subjects are explicitly subjects of
shAstram only.
