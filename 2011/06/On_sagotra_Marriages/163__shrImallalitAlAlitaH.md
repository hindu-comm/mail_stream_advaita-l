Well said. Describing old scriptures, which never show any sign of being
based on experience of newer genaration, is not a good habit. Same is true
for scientific explanations of vedas, etc. If any explanation of new
generation fits, then it's mere a case of utilization as it quotes only
parts of shAstram and mostly out of their original context. Vedas, etc are
well explained in their context by old people. They don't need to be turned
according to wish.

You may need to provide original text confirming it.

Yes. If any rule of shAstram doesn't fit a person, he should declare himself
as a non-believer. What's need of any explanation boosting your kAma ?
