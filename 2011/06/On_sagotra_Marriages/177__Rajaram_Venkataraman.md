If two people make their own decision to marry it is only based on
human love. It is not based on vaidhika dharma, which includes genuine
love but is mainly based on lifetime commitment to our sastras. If
families don't even know their gotra, they have not been performing
nitya karma for generations. They have no right to vaidhika karma
including marriage.

I'm not saying they cannot marry or that they are out of vedic fold.
They can marry according to procedures allowed for them. There 8 such
procedures, afaik. Sri Rangan of Webolim, if I remember right, has
captured it in his articles.
