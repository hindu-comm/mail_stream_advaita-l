Namaste,

////

Seriously speaking, there is no SAstric rule that 
prohibits a marriage where the gotra-s of 
both bride and groom are completely unknown. The formal
recitation of the pravara-s and transfer of bride's gotra

//

It is a shiShTAchAra which is followed from rAmAyaNa.
Both Janaka & Dasaratha introduce themselves and their
lineage in the presence of their family priests Viswamitra
& Vasishta. 

Basically, it is a form of introducing oneself and their
lineage so that both bride & bridegroom would get
to know the greatness of their family tree, lineage & 
the respective ancestors. 

Apastamba & several other dharma sastras insist the 
brideâ€™s father to enquire about the kula, gotra, health, 
assets of bridegroom. 

Regs,
Sriram
