Namaste Dr. Yadu,

I completely understand your frustration with the state of affairs when it comes 
to
practical application of veda-s. But things are changing.

I have discussed this topic multiple times in this list. Here are some brief 
inputs:

1. Let us discuss "Science and Spirituality" or "Science and Veda", if you start 

   discussing about "Science and Advaita" you will get diverted into unnecessary 

   discussions as you can see from the responses to your posts.

2. Modern Science takes a completely materialistic approach - has place only for
   observable "Material" - which includes matter and energy, in it. Spirit, or
   Consciousness are at best abstractions of "Material" interactions.

3. The first step to take is postulate Consciousness as another entity in 
addition
   to "Material".

4. Next we start understanding how "Material" and Consciousness affect each 
other.
   Property1: That Consciousness is affected by "Material" is obvious.
   Property2: That "Material" is also affected by Consciousness is slowly being 
recognized.

5. The logical next step is asking how Property2 may be harnessed to expand the 
   horizons of applications of Modern Science. This is where sooner or later one
   realizes the need to have a much more systematic understanding of the 
Consciousness.
   Here enter the tattvas as expounded in different ways by different RSi-s. 

6. Next we have to start asking how can the knowledge of tattva-s be applied to
   our daily lives. I think this is the knowledge that is more or less lost 
today.
   These are the innumerable vidyA-s expounded by different RSi-s. This 
collection
   of vidyA-s is what I would call veda in the most general understanding of 
this term.

7. Today if we somehow rediscover vidyA-s and ask how our understanding of 
Modern
   science can further enrich these vidyA-s or even better formulate new vidyA-s 
- that
   is the GRAND GOAL that I think we should strive for. Enrich veda by 
contributions
   from Modern Science.

   Here ends the description for an applied scientist. Next points are where
   vedAnta enters into picture.

8. After one learns about this vidyA, and that vidyA, and that another vidyA, 
and 

   yet another vidyA and so on ..., one may start asking, this surely is a 
wonderful
   wealth, but I see no end to this. Is there one vidyA knowing which all other 
   vidyA-s are known. This is the brahma vidyA. This is where vedAnta enters.

9. The one tattva to know which when known everything else is known is saguNa 
brahma.

10. The quest to realize, attain saguNa brahma itself is an unending quest. This 
is
    when one finally asks - what did saguNa brahma know that he became saguNa 
brahma.
    The answer to this is nirguNa brahma. This where advaita enters. 

Regards,
Shrinivas

hari Om.

I am not aware of any living "videhamukta" individual who practices 
advaita, including the any of the living Shnakaraachary's of any Matha? 


Let us take the practical example from vedic literature about "malaria" (known 
as takman).

Suuktakaara expresses his desire to drive out the maleria (takman) in the 
direction of "baahlika" (some archaeologists identify this are Bactria province 

near AfagaaNisthan).


This tells us that 
Maleria was there and they had a desire to drive it our of their country / 
community.  Has chanting the suukta with correct udaatta, andaatta, 

svarita  ....... etc helped the situation for 1000's of years? Answer is no. 
Here, Advatic Vedaanti would say that is vyavahaarika dvaita and we have nothing 
to do with it we are only here to talk about advaita only.

It is the scientist who 
recognized that Chinsona bark contains Quinine. So when British came 
that quickly realized and creating a drink "Jin & Tonic" that can 
possibly prevent malaria.  So this is practicing advaita as well.  Here, 
knowledge of malaria and quinine is acknowledged and that was consumed 

for prevention.  This is the practical viniyoga of paata~Njala Yoga SÃ¼tra(2.16) 
heyaM duHkhama anaagatam,
which literally means avoiding the misery that has not yet manifested.  
Is that not what Acharya also advocates to become ONE with the outside 
knowledge. yaH saakshata kurute porabodha samaye svaatmaana mevo dvayam ?


If one performs the yaj~na using anti-malarial ingredients as smaidhaa may be 
helpful, not the academic chanting.


All problems exists because of our ignorance, only if they are acknowledged and 
possible solution implemented toward making 

life little bit more bearable !?  Knowledge needs to advance for the 
continuous perpetual refinement. vij~naanam yaj~nam tnute karmaaNi 
tan'ute pi ca || taittariiya 2.5.5.1 ||


The only constant thing that is trikaalaatiita is the "CHANGE" itself.


My question is whether Vedanta helped our country in any shape or manner 
except for gloating with ahaMkaara that I have understood Vedaanta !?  
This why I had used the analogy of a ladle that is incapable of enjoying the 
flavor of the soup. 



Best regards,

Dr. Yadu
