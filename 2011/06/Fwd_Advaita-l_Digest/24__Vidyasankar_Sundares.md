I believe it will be useful for you to think of this issue in terms of "description"
rather than "definition". The definition of a jnAnI is devastatingly simple - one
who knows Brahman as one's own Self, one who sees only the Self (sarvam
Atmaiva abhUt), one who sees Brahman everywhere and all things in Brahman
(yo mAM paSyati sarvatra, sarvaM ca mayi paSyati). There is nothing more to
be said really, as far as a definition is concerned.

A description, on the other hand, can be more elaborate and take into account
other factors. These can include descriptors such as prasanna-vadana, sarva-
bhUtahita, bhagavad-bhakta, Atmarata, AtmakrIDa, AptakAma, kRtakRtya, etc.
