I know some families of my close relatives (combined families from a
village) where there were 3 brahmacharis in the same family. These
families believe it is a sin not to initiate a boy at the age of 8
into brahmacharya!

a point of view:

Brahmacharya is a practice for individual. It is the duty of parents
to initiate one into brahmacharya as soon as possible.
8 may be a good age (before they have to join foundation IIT courses
and other tuition!).

It will also help if parents, with the help of their spiritual guru,
get the boy understand the objectives of the brahmacharya from the
kind guru -- what is praanayaama, meaning of Gaayatri mantra, right
method of meditation, overall goal of attaining brahmajnana... we know
It takes several years of disciplined practice to get to the meaning /
experience.

with regards
Ramana

> Subject:Re: [Advaita-l] Three bramhacharis in one home
>
> Pranams It is quite interesting to know that in a family there could be two but not three brahmacharis. Will the custom and tradition permit more than four brahmacharis in a family? This is only an hypothetical question and rarely a situation like this happens. Will be grateful if this doubt is clarified. Have another doubt: that in Tamil Nadu among the brahmins the married ladies (sumangalis) don't cut and stitch the two ends and perhaps this applies to a grahastha as well in respect of the 8 or 9 yard dhoti one wears besides the anga vastram. In north India, where I spent four decades, the ladies including married ladies from south who are settled there opt to trim both the ends and get it stitched (what is known as piku/peeque). Is there a rule/convention on this please? With profound regards,

>> Well, I did hear this that there should not be three brahmacharis in a house - though I do not yet know the basis. My father (we are Apastamba sutra followers) had three brothers, so I had asked whether my youngest uncle was upaneeta only after my eldest uncle got married, but I am yet to get a clear answer. Anyhow, nowadays it is rare to have four children, let alone four sons, so the question is not much tested in practice, I guess.

The eldest had his upanayanam done in 2010 and for the second one it happened this month. It will be atleast another 10 to 15 years before the eldest one gets married.
