what is the definition of jnani as per advaita tradition?

praNAms
Hare Krishna

Unfortunately, definition varies from individual to individual, school to 
school, from one understanding of jnAni to another :-)) Since there 
accepted a gradation in jnAni's jnAna (brahmavidvara, variya, varishTa 
etc.) we have to be specific about the jnAni before asking for the 
definition of jnAna in him.  In short, there is no standard & universally 
accepted definition of the jnAni...'prArabdha' would play a vital role 
here !!??

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
