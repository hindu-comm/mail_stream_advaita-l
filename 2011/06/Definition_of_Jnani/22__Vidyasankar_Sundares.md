Yes, a description is not a definition, which is why I am asking you to think a
little about what you are looking for.

Also, to clarify, the definition I ventured to give has nothing to do with dRSya
and dRshTa objects or their absence in different states of samAdhi. It has to
do with jnAna that pervades and goes beyond all states, samAdhi included.
I thought it would be obvious that the word "seeing" is used only figuratively
in this definition.
