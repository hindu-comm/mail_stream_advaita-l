Right but what does "knowledge" of a mantra mean? As you know in our pathashalas, a brahmachari is taught the correct pronounciation above all. To know the rshi, devata, chhanda, and viniyoga of a mantra is also important. Literal meaning is usually omitted altogether unless the student goes on to learn bhashya which most do not.

Namaste Jaldhar-Ji:

I have been collecting references to "Viniyoga". Most of them I fond them in various BrahmaNaa's. I would appreciate if you could share specific references from praraaNa or from any other source for that matter.

If this is beyond the scope of this list please communicate off-List.

Thanks you in advance,

Dr. Yadu
