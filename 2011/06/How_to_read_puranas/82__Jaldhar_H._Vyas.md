Brahmana is in its widest sense any part of shruti which is not mantra. 
Most of the historically earliest upanishads are part of a brahmana.  For 
instance brhadaranyaka (note the name) is the concluding parts of the 
shatapatha brahmana.  In fact its chapters are called brahmanas. 
Taittireyopanishad is the concluding part of the Taittireya Aranyaka which 
itself is the concluding part of the Taittireya Brahmana and so on.

See above.  Now one place where Vedanta and purva mimamsa part company is 
that the former do not accept the latters analysis of the jnana kanda. 
(Wherever in shruti that might occur.)  But suryanamaskara etc. definitely 
fall under the purview of karma and therefore PM.

On the contrary, Shruti often does.  We recently discussed such a case.
See: http://lists.advaita-vedanta.org/archives/advaita-l/2011-April/026965.html

And there are many instances where puranas state something unequivocably 
and these statements are treated as authoritative in dharmashastras.

Smrti has authority only insofar as it is based on shruti.  But when it 
is, the same principles can be applied to their analysis.

Can you give an example of what you mean by this.

Do you believe the injuction to celebrate Holi (which is not mentioned in 
Shruti) has any force or is it the opinion of some smrti-kara?
