Right but what does "knowledge" of a mantra mean?  As you know in our 
pathashalas, a brahmachari is taught the correct pronounciation above all. 
To know the rshi, devata, chhanda, and viniyoga of a mantra is also 
important.  Literal meaning is usually omitted altogether unless the 
student goes on to learn bhashya which most do not.

And for puranas and other smrtis too as they owe their authority solely to 
being founded on, and an amplification of the Shruti.

Not necessarily.  Take for example the puranic geography where the Earth 
is being described as a flat or concave disk with Mt. Meru in the 
middle set upon four elephants which themselves rest upon a tortoise.  One 
of my research interests is panchanga ganita and let me tell you, if we 
were to take the puranic account literally, the tithis and muhurtas we 
rely upon for the practice of dharma would become impossible to calculate. 
Jyotish shastras don't do that.  They assume the Earth is round.  Meru is 
interpreted as the Earths axis.  (Sumeru being the North pole and Kumeru 
the South pole.)  Are the jyotish shastras not also Arsha and hallowed by 
tradition?
