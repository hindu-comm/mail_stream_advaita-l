>*From the quote below, it seems Jnaneshwar says that jnana consumes itself
*but that the bliss of bhakti (bhakti-rasa) continues though the difference
between the devotee and the lord is non-existent on liberation.
Interestingly, it is the >position taken by Madhusudana.

It is important to note that Jnaneshvar distinguishes between relative
knowledge and absolute knowledge. Relative knowledge is that which destroys
ignorance and annihilates itself. Absolute knowledge is nothing but the Self
(vide satyaM jnAnam anantaM brahma). The Self is eternal.

>From Chapter 9:

God Himself is the devotee;
The goal is the path.
The whole universe is one solitary Being.

It is He who becomes a god,
And He who becomes a devotee.
In Himself,
He enjoys the kingdom of Stillness.

No matter where he goes,
That sage is making pilgrimage to Shiva.
And if he attains to Shiva,
That attainment is non-attainment.


Anand
