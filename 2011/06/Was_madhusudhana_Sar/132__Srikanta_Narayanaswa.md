While it is certain that the impact of Bhakthi is discerned from Madhusudhana Saraswathi's commentary "gudartha deepika"on Bhagawad Gita,we can also see a clear and discernible
departure from the "Prasanna gambhira"style of Shankara's Brahma Sutra Bhashya and the uncompromising style in Sureshwara's "Naishkarmya siddhi"in his Adwaita siddhi.To be impartial there are certain sections in "Adwaita siddhi"which is hard to understand if not difficult and sounds post -Ramaunujacharyan and Madhwan influence on some of the Adwaitins of that day.Even now there are some Adwaitins who vouch for Ramanuja like Swami Paramarthananda Saraswathiji.Definitely,there was a transition stage in Madhusudhana saraswathi who tended to reconcile the Bhakthi and Jnana.
N.Srikanta.
