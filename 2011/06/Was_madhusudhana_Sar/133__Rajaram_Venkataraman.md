Madhusudana is very reverential to Sankara, who he often refers to as the
"venerable one". Otherwise, one cannot fault his conclusive style. What
really irks me is advaitins  saying he was influenced by other schools (did
not use vaishnavas because if properly understood it best describes
advaitins).  I am okay with any claim but please provide proof not just an
opinion. i can understand other schools claiming he was influenced by them
to take up bhakti.

We all know Madhusudana debated Madhwas. In the case of Ramanuja, he even
finds fault in his ability to deconstruct compound words. For e.g. in
sarvabhutatmabhutama, he says how the construct leads to redundancy.
