Feel free to have the last word on this topic but above does not make any sense.

vaiShNava-s in the form of vaikhAnasa-s and pA~ncharAtrika-s(in various forms as 
sAttvata-s, shikin-s, mUlaka-s, ekAntin-s etc) have existed long before 
shankara.

vaikhAnasa vaishNava mata was by vikhanasa puruSha and pA~ncharAtra was revealed 
to various(actually 5) devata-s. 


shankara is completely out of this picture and had nothing to do with vaiShNava 
mata.

I will say no more on this unless there is something substantial.
