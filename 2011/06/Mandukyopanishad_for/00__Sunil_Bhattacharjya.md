What does the Acharya say about the paroksha meaning (ie. the inner sense) of this Vrata?

Dear Mahadevanji,

/////
If it is MundakOpanishad, in a way, this is may be according to one sampradaya. I believe this Atharva Veda Upanishad got this name, because, the seeking disciple who wishes to learn this truth, needed to remain Vrath by remaining shaving his head (Mundaka:) and on completion of the Vrata, hee needs to approach the teacher with a Mud Pot containing coal ambers in his Head and prostrate to the Guru, expressing his desire to learn this ultimate truth.

May be he wanted to observe a bit of this sampradaya

//

This is the "sirOvrata" of Atharva Veda.I think, this vrata in its literal sense has been
refuted by Acharya Sankara in his Brahma Sutra Bhashya (somewhere in 3rd Section).

regs,
sriram
