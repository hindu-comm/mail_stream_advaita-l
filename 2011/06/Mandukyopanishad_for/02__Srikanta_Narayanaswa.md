Dear Srikantaji,
I think you are referring to MundakOpanishad and not MANDUKYA Upanishad.

If it is MundakOpanishad, in a way, this is may be according to one sampradaya. I believe this Atharva Veda Upanishad got this name, because, the seeking disciple who wishes to learn this truth, needed to remain Vrath by remaining shaving his head (Mundaka:) and on completion of the Vrata, hee needs to approach the teacher with a Mud Pot containing coal ambers in his Head and prostrate to the Guru, expressing his desire to learn this ultimate truth.

May be he wanted to observe a bit of this sampradaya,

Hari Om

Mahadevan Babuji,
It is not "Mundaka Upanishad",but Mandukyopanishad,and I am right in saying that it is specially for the Sanyasis.The Mandukyopanishad has nothing to do with the 'shirovrath"
meant for the Mundakopanishad.The Mandukyopanishad along with Gaudapada karikas is the most difficult of all the Upanishads.Many controversies have been raised on the Mandukyopanishad and the Gaudapada karikas and are still being raised even today.To understand the Mandukyopanishad,with the Gaudapada karikas and the Bhashya of Shankara,it requires a throught understanding of the concepts in the Upanishad.
N.Srikanta.
