Both Baudhayana and Gautama reject this practice of intermarrige between cousins, while noting that it occurs in South India. Apastamba's own verses if read carefully may or may not support the practice. Kumarila argues against the custom, citing this as an example of how not all local customs can be considered Dharma.

This is an instance of what I would consider to be on the "Boundary" of Dharma - it can be said that the practice is "tolerated".

Here's another:

I respect the defense of traditional practices, but sometimes tradition itself has more than one voice on an issue. It may be useful for an individual to listen to all the inputs and then come to a conclusion for oneself.

Here's a continuation to the letter I posted a while ago [1]:

 "The [Surya] Namaskara is commonly performed after every Hanas.
 The division of Veda Vakyas into Hanas is purely for the
 sake of memorization and has nothing to do with usage.
 Sometimes a Hanas begins at half a Mantra, sometimes a Hanas
 ends at three-quarters of a Mantra!"

Thus there are two reasons for the non-acceptance among some scholars regarding the usage of the Aruna Prashna for Surya Namaskara as generally performed in South India:

1) It contains Vidhis (inter-mixed with the Mantras), which are not recited during an Anushthanam.
2) There are cases where a Mantra is broken after a fraction of its recitation, which is "strange" for an Anushthanam.

I discussed this with a Mimamsa scholar and here's how the dialog (roughly) went:

Me: "The Aruna Prashnam is usually recited while performing the Surya Namaskaram".
Scholar: "Yes, it is very commendable! One should follow it!"
Me: "There are Vidhis in the Prashnam..."

Immediately, the scholar broke into a smile! :-) He paused a bit and said, "The person who told you this must be a Maha-Pandita, since seldom do people know that a Vaidika Anushthanam does not involve the recitation of a Vidhi. You are an engineer, and there may be technicians working under you. Sometimes the technicians do things without listening to the engineer. So too have people begun using the Veda in ways that Vedic scholars don't always agree with. Since Vaidika Dharma is not practised in a strong manner nowadays, we have let people go ahead with their ways. If you are aware of which statements are Vidhis in the Aruna Prashnam, DO NOT RECITE THEM DURING THE ANUSHTHANAM."

Later, he explained a bit more about how the ONLY exception for the rule is the Brahma-Yajnam [2].

Also, the term "Lokachara" is perhaps a better fit for some practises than "Sishtachara".
