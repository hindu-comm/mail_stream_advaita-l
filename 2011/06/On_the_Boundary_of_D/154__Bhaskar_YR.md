"What I object to is to brand the set of mantras as "durgaa suuktam.h" 
where only one mantra, as a freak, refers to durgaa." --> This is a purely 
theoretical stance, where the practice of worshipping Durga using these 
Mantras is not objected to, only the naming or title of the 
Sukram. /// Very true.  This was also called Agni Sukta.Durga is 
contemplated as the effulgence of Agni.Shri Vidyaranya Muni mentions this 
sukta rahasyain “Vana Durga Kalpa” and derives the esotericessence of Vana 
Durga from this Agni (Durga) Sukta.

There is agni sUkta (specifically named as 'agni' sUkta) also in Rigveda. 
In pratimAshuddhi, kalashasthApanAdi vidhi we chant this sUkta with agni 
pada sahita & agni pada rahita.  And also there is rIgveda durga sUkta as 
well (apart from devi sUkta).
