The scholar never said Durga Sukta should not be used to worship Durga, but only that the NAME "Durga Sukta" is not a suitable one for the set of Mantras beginning with "Jaatavedase...".

As a matter of fact, the scholar himself uses the Sukta to worship Durga, but insists that the Sukta could be BETTER NAMED.
