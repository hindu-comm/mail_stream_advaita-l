Dear
Sri Vishnu as depicted in the Dhyana slokas is very much a true 
representation.He is in that form in Sri Vaikuntha.Same applies to Lord 
Shiva also.The lokas are very much reachable/seeable but the soul should be 
qualified for that.The avatharas are true and they had taken place from yuga 
to yuga.During the avatharas the Gods do display emotions as human 
beings/animals.
If you want to learn more about Hindu Dharma you can start with Sri Ramayana 
,Sri Mahabharatha and Srimad Bhagavatham.Lastly devotion is a must.You can 
use your logic/analysis to understand the Hindu Dharma and you will get 
satisfactory answers.All the best for your learning about 
Hinduism.R.Krishnamoorthy.
