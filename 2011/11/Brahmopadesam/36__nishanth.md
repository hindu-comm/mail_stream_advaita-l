* THE MASTER Nan-in had a visitor who came to inquire about Zen. But
> instead of listening, the visitor kept talking about his own
> ideas.*
>
> * After a while, Nan-in served tea. He poured tea into his visitor's
> cup until it was full, then he kept on pouring.*
>
> * Finally the visitor could not restrain himself. "Don't you see
> it's full?" he said. "You can't get any more in!"*
>
> *"Just so," replied Nan-in, stopping at last. "And like this cup,
> you are filled with your own ideas. How can you expect me to give
> you Zen unless you offer me an empty cup?"*
