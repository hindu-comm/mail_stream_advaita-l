Namaste

The word brahmopadesha refers to initiation in to vedic study and not
initiation directly in to Vedanta. The word "brahma" is often used
synonymously with the word "veda".

As in the gItA shloka 3.15 "karma brahmodbhavam viddhi
brahmAxara-samudbhavam"  (know that karma origniates from brahma
(i.e., veda) and this brahma (i.e., veda) orinigates from akShara
(i.e., Brahman)"

We can clearly see that the word brahma means veda, and not Brahman.

A similar meaning holds good in the context of brahmopadeSha - the
first contact of the student with the veda-mantra, i.e., gAyatri
mantra.
