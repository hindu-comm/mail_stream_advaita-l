Namaste
Your line of thought may not be within current traditional discourse.
Nevertheless, you may like to look at the idea that dhvani is
continuous/analog while all communication and information is discrete,
much like discrete varNa-s. Even an analog carrier is modulated with
discrete sound syllables to carry meaningful information. Music of a
veena may produce rasa in the hearer  but it cannot be said to
inherently be a carrier of information unless discrete svara-s and
sAhitya are superimposed upon it . All information is discrete.
Therefore dhvani by itself cannot be the basis for storing and
communicating information.
