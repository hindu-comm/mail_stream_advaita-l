> Here is my long-delayed response to your post.

The points raised here seem to wander far afield of both (a) the perceived need
to articulate the validity of the veda-s in a contemporary context, and (b) relevance
of the validity of the veda to advaita vedAnta in particular. So, I'm going to try and
keep my responses brief.

My general point is that one's expectations need to be based on what one thinks of
"vedic religion" vis-a-vis "purANic Hinduism" and the current practice of Hinduism.
Therefore, all I meant to convey was that if one wants to compare the big temples
dedicated to Siva and vishNu to the lack of temples to indra, agni and vAyu, one 
should have clear ideas of what these various versions of the religion are.

> 1. Can you say that purusha is a major rig vedic god due to purusha sukta?
> 2. Can you really say that Indra and Agni are minor vedic gods?

Neither, and I don't claim either of the above. I don't subscribe to the minor vs.
major distinction among the vedic gods as commonly understood today. But that
is a topic for another completely different discussion, outside of this list perhaps.

But Shirdi Sai Baba was a recent historical person. In a land that just gave birth
to the world's 7 billionth human being, popularity is easy to come by. Here is a 
simple calculation to consider - every birth, every marriage and every death in
a Hindu household, of whichever caste/sect you want to pick, involves certain
religious rituals. In how many of these is the name of Shirdi Sai Baba invoked?
In how many of these are Siva, vishNu, durgA, gaNapati, lakshmI and sarasvatI 
invoked? Can you really compare the "popular worship" of Shirdi Sai Baba with
the worship down the ages of the gods of Hinduism?

Whatever date you accept for the yajurveda, the conclusion invariably follows
that a god who deserved more than a hundred names with a namaH after each
one was definitely a popular god of that date. Whatever date you accept for the
Rgveda, the god who measured out the earth, the heavens and everything in 
between in three steps was clearly a popular god of that date. These gods are
still the popular gods of today too. That is the only point I wish to make. All
other historical, sociological, anthropological, psychoanalytic or any other kind
of notion about the numerous gods is a matter of personal opinion, and of these,
there are millions, so there is really nothing to privilege any one opinion over 
the others.

Harappa, Mohenjodaro, Indus Valley, Vedic Aryans, non-Vedic Aryans,
Dravidians, popular public, elite few - none of these is really relevant to a
philosophical statement of the validity of the veda. They are all grist for the
mill of other kinds of scholarship maybe, but may I point out that you are
relying on a false dichotomy of what it means to be popular and what it
means to be elitist? Popular among whom? Elitist with respect to whom?

On the one hand, you want to go by the methodology of counting the number
of hymns addressed to a god, which would make indra THE popular Rgvedic
god. On the other hand, in order to make sense of why indra never got to be
popularly worshipped through the ages like vishNu or Siva, you then want to
confine his popularity to the elite few by saying that the veda itself was limited
to an elite few. If so, vishNu as urukrama and Siva as rudra in the veda were
also limited to the same elite few. It follows that these elite few who supposedly
considered upendra and rudra considered to be minor in the time of the Rgveda
and yajurveda somehow elevated them and downgraded their own major gods
like indra, agni and vAyu over time. Why? Which people in the history of the
ancient world has behaved that way, unless they were conquered by an alien
group of people who forced other gods upon them?

No hindsight involved here at all. In all the texts available, indra or varuNa
are never equated with the yajna the way vishNu is. In all the texts available, 
no long litany of names is addressed to indra or agni or vAyu or varuNa, only
to rudra. And as far as I am concerned, the "early vedic" and "late vedic" 
distinction is completely irrelevant to any view that anyone wants to take
about the validity of the veda as religious scripture or as a pramANa in a
philosophical sense. If one wants to accept the veda as an authority, early vs.
late is of no consequence. If one wants to reject the authority of the veda, a
chronology argument is perhaps the weakest thing one could come up
with, as a reason to reject the veda as a whole.

The brAhmaNa statement about agni and vishNu is a purely factual statement,
as fire is accessible on earth and is in fact generated by human endeavour,
whereas vishNu is a more conceptual presence, not a concrete material reality
on earth. Ultimately, the very name vishNu indicates He who has entered all
there is and is therefore invisibly present everywhere and therefore THE
abstraction of all abstractions. Naturally, all the deva-s are in between. It
makes perfect sense in all time, whether in 2011 or in the Rgvedic age,
whenever that may have been.

Since when did a historical understanding of the Rgveda became crucial to a need
to articulate the validity of the veda for philosophical, religious, ritual and spiritual
purposes in today's world. And since when did the "later vedic literature" become
irrelevant to the "early vedic literature" if one does want to take a historical position
one way or the other? No matter what angle one approaches the Rgveda from, it
is the height of intellectual hubris to reject the "late vedic literature".

Count away, but factor it with the attitude expressed towards each god and
with what is the relationship between the god and humans.

It is well-known how? If his importance has already "reduced drastically" from
whatever position he had earlier, why is it that the mahAbhArata abounds with
descriptions of his svarga? I would suggest that you read the epic and its
references to indra without ANY preconceptions and evaluate these independently.

A lot of water has flown down the ganga between the epic period and today.
You miss my point. I am not asking you to judge the importance of indra to
the Rgveda based on the mahAbhArata. I am asking you to look at the attitude
towards indra in the epic exhibited by kshatriya heroes as opposed to their
worshipful attitude towards Siva or vishNu. indra is by no means a drastically
diminished god in the epic, in my opinion. He is the father of arjuna, the most
central hero of the bhArata. He is the one who takes away karNa's armor and
ear rings, thereby ensuring arjuna's victory at a crucial point. He is the one
who comes in person at the end, to escort yudhishThira to heaven. He is the
one who artfully manages urvashI's curse, enabling arjuna to use the curse
to disguise himself for a year. His hand, and the hands of vAyu, sUrya and 
other vedic gods are constantly seen in the background, manipulating human
events. So, when a kshatriya in the epic boasts that his might on the battlefield
is such that he can beat even indra, it is not because indra is a "reduced" god.
Rather, it is because the said kshatriya thinks of himself as vastly superior to
other human fighters and thinks himself comparable to indra.

Here we go again with "popular religion" and "elite few". Yes, the veda has
nothing to say about a Shirdi Sai Baba who lived less than 200 years ago and
is today worshipped by millions. But the veda, unlike other scriptures, does 
NOT prohibit the rise of a Shirdi Sai Baba to such popular status too. And in
temples that are built today, with an idol of Shirdi Sai Baba at the sanctum,
the veda (at least some portion of it) is always recited. Where should one
draw the line between esteem and popularity?

Ultimately, coming back to this list's focus and a perceived contemporary
need to set out the religious and philosophical validity of the veda, how does
any of the above matter? Would it somehow be accepted as more valid if it
did reflect whatever one thinks of as popular religion? Would it be seen as
more valid if it did not exhibit "early" and "late" portions based on a linguistic
analysis? Would it be more valid if its contents were anything other than 
what they are?
