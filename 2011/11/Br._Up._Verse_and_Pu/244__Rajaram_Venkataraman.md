The other thread got derailed. In Br. Up. there are a series of verses that
talk about begetting a child well verses in one, two, three or four vedas.
The description does not match with Putra Kameshti described in Ramayana
probably because that is for kshatriya. Does any one know the ritual
referref to in the Br. Up. verse?
