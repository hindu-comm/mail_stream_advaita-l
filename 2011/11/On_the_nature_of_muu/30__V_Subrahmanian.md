Namaste Sri Subhanu ji,

In the Vedanta, prakRti, or mAyA, is admitted as the upAdaana kAraNam for
the universe.  In the Bh.Gita itself we have several verses where the Lord
says that the world is created with the Lord as the 'adhyakSha' by
PrakRti.  All creation comes out of this prakRti and lapses back into it,
only to re-emerge from there in the next cycle.  The abode of origin, stay
and dissolution is the upAdAna kAraNam as admitted in (Advaita) Vedanta.

The last verse of the BG 13th chapter talks of the bhUtaprakRtimoksha which
is explained by Shankara as the bhUtAnAm prakRtiH kAraNam, avidyAlakShaNA,
and its abhAvagamanam.  Only that which has been imagined to be real can,
upon the rise of right knowledge, can become sublated.  The
jnAnanivartyatvam of this prakRti is very clearly stated in this bhashyam.
In fact this knowledge, that is, of the prakRti's abhAvagamanam, is one of
the two requisites of liberating knowledge; the other one being the
distinctly knowing the kShetra and the kShetrajna.

In the commentary of Sri Madhusudana Saraswati for the BG verse 9.10 we
find a quotation and his concluding comment :

तदुक्तम्—

अस्य द्वैतेन्द्रजालस्य यदुपादानकारणम् ।

अज्ञानं तदुपाश्रित्य ब्रह्म कारणमुच्यते ॥ इति ।


श्रुतिस्मृतिवादाश्चात्रार्थे सहस्रश उदाहार्याम् ॥१०॥


[I would like to know the source of this verse.  Someone told me that
Sureshwaracharya has quoted or said this in his work/s.  Kindly confirm.  I
find a word द्वैतेन्द्रजालस्य in the NS 2.112, however.

स्वतस्सिद्धात्मचैतन्यप्रतिबिम्बिताविचारितसिद्धिकात्मानवबोधोत्थेतरेतरस्वभावापेक्ष-
सिद्धत्वात्स्वतश्चासिद्धेरनात्मनो  द्वैतेन्द्रजालस्य ..
>From this sentence of the NS it is clear that Sureshwara admits:


   - That the ignorance is a vishaya for the Self.
   - It is superimposed in the Self as it has to have a support to exist
   and function.
   - This ignorance is of the nature of 'not knowing the self'.

>From the above quote of MS in the BG and what the NS says it is to be
concluded that this variegated world projection has the above stated
ignorance as its  material cause.  In advaita the entire kShetram, the
manifestation of prakRiti.

Shankara says in the BSB 1.4.3:

//"Such a causal state must necessarily be admitted - aavashyaupagnatavya
-, since it is according to sense and reason arthavati hi sa. For without
it taya vina the Supreme Lord Parameshwarasya could not be conceived as
creator - srshtratvam sidhyati, as he could not become active
pravrttiyaanupapatte if he were destitute of the potentiality of action
Shakti-rahitasya. The existence of such a causal potentiality beejashakti
renders it moreover possible that the released souls muktanam should not
enter on new courses of existence, as it is destroyed by perfect knowledge
vidyaya."//


  tarati avidyAm vitatAm hRdi yasminniveshite
  yogI mAyAm ameyAya tasmai jnAnAtmane namaH [Mahabharatam]

  [By enshrining That Lord in his heart a yogi (aspirant) crosses over the
  vast (pervasive) avidyA (which is) mAyA. To such a Lord who is verily
  Consciousness and (therefore)cannot be objectified, I offer my
  obeisance.]

  This verse has been quoted by the VivaraNa AchArya to substantiate the
  scriptural position that avidyA and mAyA are non-different. In this
  verse the two terms are used in the objective case, in sAmAnaadhikaraNam
  (in apposition). Shankara has quoted another verse of this very group
  (BhiShma stuti) in the BSB 1.2.25. One can also see the very word
  'taranti' of the Bh.Gita 7.14 (mAyAm etAm taranti te) echoing in the
  Mahabharata verse as 'tarati mAyAm / avidyAm'. The author of 'both' is
  Veda VyAsa.

That a mithyAvastu is not existent in all periods of time is the ultimate
siddhAnta in advaita.  That it exists and produces an effect is well
admitted by Shankara.  For example in the ArambhaNaadhikaraNa bhashyam
Shankara has very well admitted the 'kArya janakatva' of the 'unreal' Veda
and argued at length on this. What Sureshwara says in the above places is
only the well-admitted parama siddhAnta pertaining to a mithyA vastu in
advaita.  Sureshwara's words do not vitiate the stand regarding the mithyA
ajnAnam's upAdAnatva for the jagat.  That the
avidyA/ajnAna-non-different-prakRti's material causehood is quite shAnkaran
and scriptural is well established in the earlier stated quotes.

The term 'nimitta' in 'mithyAjnAnanimitta' in the adhyAsabhAShya can very
well be, without defying the rules of grammar, explained as 'upAdAnam'.
'nimitta' is a synonym of 'hetu'.  What Shankara says there is that it is
having mithyAjnAna as its cause. This generic word can be explained with
the specific meaning of upAdAna, material (cause).

Advaitins very well recognize that there is no 'actual entity'   called
anAtman.  Yet it has been elaborately dealt with in the scripture and in
the bhashya and other works by treating  it 'as if' it is.  For example
Krishna chooses just in one single verse 'daivi hyeShA guNamayI...' to
'posit' its existence/experience  'duratyayA' and its ultimate
non-existence 'mAyAm etAm  taranti te'.  Here the 'jnAnanivartyatvam' of
mAyA and its kAryam is very explicit. In BG 2.16 the word 'asat' is also
explained only as something that does not ultimately matter but temporarily
countable.  The very method of the 2.16  is most visibly appreciable in the
last verse of the BG 13 th chapter.  That it is something deserving
'dealing with' is itself incontrovertible proof in Advaita for its 'sad
asad vilakShaNa' nature.

Everyone agrees and recognizes that the projected universe is nothing but
name and form.  It is this name-form nature of the universe that engages
the attention of the scripture and the bhashyakAra to treat it as something
to be got over/eradicated.  The indeterminacy is also spoken of as
'sattvena asattvena vA nirvaktum ashakyatvam' through the words
'tattva-anyatvAbhyAm anirvAchyam'.  Here the word 'tattva' refers to
'existence'/'reality' and the word 'anyat' refers to the opposite of the
former: total non-existence/unreality.   .

Yet Shankaracharya, through that dialogue in the BG 13.2, establishes it by
svAnubhava pramANa. Here He makes the questioner realize that it is
sAkShi-vedyam: 'jAnAsi..?'.

It has been described by the Shruti as 'devAtmashaktiH' , the shakti of
Brahman the Conscious Being. Shankara too calls it a shakti.

That which is common experience also needs to be 'shown to be so' by the
scripture and the Acharya.  That is why the most common experience of 'I
am' is also 'pointed out' by the Acharya.  It is only then that one nods
recognizing its undeniability.  So, AptavAkya becomes a pramANa even in
getting across this message, whether it is about one's Brahman nature or
about one's  bondage.  In fact in the BG 13.2 dialogue it is the
'kAryAnumeyatvam' of avidya (VivekachUDaamaNi)  that plays the key role in
helping the questioner recognize this.

That 'jnAna abhAva' causes confusion is the reply that comes only after
asking the question 'what causes adhyAsa?'.  The svaprakAsha Atman cannot
get into an adhyAsa-caused samsara without anything that obstructs the
self-effulgence.  That obstruction, AvaraNa, needs to be identified and
addressed.

We see Shankara going with the Lord who caters to the aspirants of the most
preparatory stage.  'api chet sudurAchAro', 'atha etadapyashakto'si' are
all not shunned by Shankara as those not belonging to His tradition.  In
fact the Shruti itself says 'asti iti eya upalbdhavyaH', 'asanneva sa
bhavati' etc. to teach the starting point for spirituality.

This is very true.  The seeking for the cause is no life-long engagement by
itself.  The very answer to this question is easily available in the
scripture and the bhashya.  So there is no seeking for this cause as a
specific sadhana.

I think all the trouble arose/arises only when the traditional teachings
about avidya happen to be questioned.  It is only the consequent reaction
that goes by the name of above dialectic.  I would think that the dialectic
is only a result of the initial triggering.

The Scripture, the Brahmasutras and the BhAshya do not subscribe to the
above thought.  The aim of the Scripture is to enable the separating of the
puruSha from the prakRti.  In that effort the Scripture has to show what
this prakRti is to the aspirant and thereby make him see reason as to why
he should engage in serious discrimination, prakRti-puruSha viveka.

This perception is also not in tune with the method of the
shAstra/bhAshya.  It is exactly to explicitly answer the question “well,
why am I confused and see the world?”, that the entire lore of the
scripture and bhashya exist. Instead of turning away such an aspirant the
scripture shows ways and means to prepare the him and enable his
appreciation of the teaching.  That is why we have the 16th chapter and
similar portions in the BG, for instance.

That Sureshwara's works are not studied extensively is a point that has to
be addressed.  However, the remark that he may have differed from
subsequent vedantins is always debatable.  There are those who point out
that Sureshwara himself has differed from Shankara.  Even if there are
differences among Vedantins it does not harm the aspirant who is under a
truly qualified teacher.

Surely Prof. Alston's observations reveal his complete unfamiliarity with
the method and facts of the Scripture.  For example there is a large volume
of discourse in the BG on the cosmos: Chapters 7.8.9,10,11,13, 14, 17 and
18 have so much of teaching on the world and its nature. The Mandukya
Upanishad has a whole description of the Cosmos, both micro and macro, in
the mantras up to the 7th where the culmination comes in the way of
'prapanchopashamam'.  Almost every Upanishad engages elaborately in the
delineation of sRShTi.  The Brahma sutras do not lag behind.  They have
their own share and content on cosmology.  Discussions on bhUtas,
indriya-s, prANa, etc. are quite common there.

And regarding Panchadashi, the chapters are so nicely arranged that the
entire gamut covers the pancha-kosha, avasthA traya, AtmAnAtmaa,
prakriya-s.  In fact what comes to mind, even to the Dvaitin, about
Panchadashi is: mAyAkhyAyAH kAmadhenoH vatsau jIveshwaravubhau. yathEccham
pibatAm dvaitam tattvam tu Advaitameva hi'.  What greater testimony is
needed for the Panchadashi than this singularly outstanding teaching of
Advaita?  In effect, every work of importance in the vedantic lore caters
to all types of adhikArin-s.  Each will find what is required for him.
Since each person comes with his own stock of samskara-s, it is but
necessary to seek what one needs.  And the Guru and Ishwara are the guides
that help in this identification of what is needed and get past what is
not.  For, there are always people who need what one may not need.
