It is quite clear that avidyA which is mAyA that projects the universe in
the form of names and forms.  That is the meaning the above verse gives.
That such avidyA/mAyA is asat, unreal, is also understandable.  That such
an entity is jnAnanivartya is also explicit from the vArtika quoted already:

tattvamasyAdi-vAkyottha....In this verse avidyA is indicated in its two
states: kAraNa avidyA and kArya avidyA by the words 'avidyA saha-kAryeNa'.
Since this avidyA is said, in the verse, to be known as not existing in all
three periods of time, just like the superimposed sarpa, upon the dawn of
AtmajnAna, it is undoubtedly a sad-asad-vilakShaNa entity.  Such an entity
can not be admitted to be a 'abhAva' vastu.  Just as Shankara has admitted
the unreal Veda as producing the necessary effect of Jnana, this avidyaa,
being unreal, too produces its effect of samsAra: the
nAmarUpaprapancha/samsara.

Further, this verse, just as the Vartika verse quoted above, also admits
avidyA and mAyA to be non-different.  The two words are in the dvitIyA -


tarati avidyAm vitatAm hRdi yasminniveshite
  yogI mAyAm ameyAya tasmai jnAnAtmane namaH [Mahabharatam]

  [By enshrining That Lord in his heart a yogi (aspirant) crosses over the
  vast (pervasive) avidyA (which is) mAyA. To such a Lord who is verily
  Consciousness and (therefore)cannot be objectified, I offer my
  obeisance.]

This quote is also proof of avidyA/mAyA/prakRtiH being a shaktiH.

In the BG bhaShya Shankara says:

इतीयं यथोक्ता प्रकृतिः मे मम ऐश्वरी मायाशक्तिः अष्टधा भिन्ना भेदमागता।
।।7.4।।
प्रकृतिद्वयद्वारेण अहं सर्वज्ञः ईश्वरः जगतः कारणमित्यर्थः।। 7.6 ||

So, whenever Brahman is said to be the cause of the universe, it is the
mAyA-shabalita Brahman, the saguNa Brahman, that is the cause.  And when it
is stated that by knowing the effect the Cause is known, it is Brahman
without the upAdhi of mAyA that is intended.  From the first quote it is
clear that it is this shakti that transforms into the world.  Thus the
material cause of the world is this shakti, mAyA, with, of course, the
support of Brahman.

Madhusudana might be quoting this verse from a source other than the
Vartika.  In any case the meaning / translation given by Anandagiri appears
to be quite in order.  It conforms exactly to the BGB 7th ch.Shankara
bhashya quotes shown above.

We have another instance where Sureshwara explicitly mentions the word
'upAdAnam' with reference to ajnAna.  In the NS III.15 sambandhokti, for
instance, he says:

यस्मादज्ञानोपादानाया एव बुद्धेर्भेदो नात्मनः, तस्मादेत्सिद्धम् -...[Since
the (above mentioned) distinction arises for *the intellect alone which is
a product of ignorance*, and not for the Self, this is established.].

Here it is very clear that Sureshwara is talking of ajnAna as the material
cause of the intellect.  If one could cleverly read the meaning
'precondition' for the word 'upAdAnakAraNam' with the sole intention to
preclude the root-ignorance idea, then it can be quite within one's right
to read the meaning of 'upAdAna' in the word 'nimitta' of the
adhyAsabhAShya (mithyAjnAna-nimittaH..).  Where do we end up with this kind
of text-torturing?  Also it is to be noted that while Sureshwara questions
the need to look for a cause for this smasAra-adyAsa, he himself talks of
such a cause in several places, two of which we have seen above.  From that
it is clear that Sureshwara, like the other Acharyas, also resorts to
specify the cause of samsAra-adhyAsa only to enable the prakriyA to
operate, though in the ultimate point of view there is no samsara at all
and hence no need to specify such a cause.

The 'anirvachanIyA' tag attached to avidyA/mAyA or avidyA/mAyA kAryam does
not need special mention in Advaita for the very fact of jnAnanivartyatva
is enough to imply this.  In the VivekachUDaMani is the famous verse:
सन्नाप्यसन्नाप्युभयात्मिका नो.....भिन्नाप्यभिनाप्युभयात्मिका
नो.....अनिर्वचनीयरूपा clearly echoes the Shankara BSB 2.1.14 passage:

Sarvajnasya Iswarasya AtmabhUte ivAvidyAkalpite nAmarUpe
tattvAnyatvAbhyAm anirvachanIye samsAraprapanchabIjabhUte sarvajnyasya
Iswarasya mAyA , shaktih, prakrtih iti cha shrutismrityorabhilipyate | [BSB
2-1-14]

Here one should note that the 'nAmarUpe' that is said to be the bIja for
samsAra is the jiva's imagined avidyA kArya that is the cause that triggers
his karma and the phala thereof that forms the bija, basis, for Ishwara to
create the next prapancha.  That is why we see that Shankara, though
mentioning the nAmarUpa as bIja in one place, does not mention it to be so
in the other places, as for example, in the BGB 7th chapter quote we saw
above.

That 'sAkShitA' is also not pAramArthikI is well known.  The Shastram
itself posits this 'witnesshood' on the Self for the purpose of easy
apprehension: साक्षी चेता केवलो निर्गुणश्च. Of course what Sureshwara is
saying above is: the shAstram does an 'adhyAropa' of sAkShitva on Atman for
the sake of the dull witted who are under delusion.

True.  This is also stated well in the 'hastAmalakeeya' as 'ghanacchanna
dRShTim ghanacchaannamarkam manyate'.  One's vision is what is obstructed
by the cloud.  Yet one thinks that the Sun is obstructed by the cloud.

The particle 'iva' only means that it is 'not factual' just as 'the rope
appears as though it is a snake.'  Still the sad-asad-vilakShaNatva nature
is kept in tact.

True.  AvidyAnAsha by jnAna is exactly like rajjvajnAna nAsha by rajju
jnAna.  Hence this ignorance is some bhAvarUpa entity, else its nAsha is
impossible/absurd.
Shankara has also said: रज्जावादिबुद्धय सर्पादिबुद्धीनां बाधकत्वं
संपादयन्ति  which shows that according to Shankara the ignorance is
undergoing sublation.  Only that which is experienced as 'some thing' can
undergo sublation.  One cannot talk of the sublation of a hare's horn, an
abhAva padArtha.  So, the 'tattvamsyAdi vaakyottha....' verse of Sureshwara
decisively implies the anirvAchyatva/sadasadvilakShaNatva of avidya/ajnAna
in both its kAraNa and kArya versions.

All said and done we see Sureshwara himself talking of such a cause in
terms of 'sat', in the two examples of his usage of the term 'upAdAnam'
that we have cited above.  Also, that it is 'asat' in the final analysis is
also known from his well-known 'tattvamsyAdivAkyottha..' verse where the
त्रैकालिकात्यन्ताभावप्रतियोगित्वम्’ nature of avidyA/avidyAkArya is
explicitly spelt out by him.  So, Sureshwara is only saying that in the
ultimate analysis it is of no use to look for a cause of samsara.  'na
vedmi' itself shows how one's svaprakAsha Atman is enveloped by a certain
ignorance so as to result in the projection, vikShepa, of the variegated
universe.

I endorse your above views and would encourage anyone to take up such a
