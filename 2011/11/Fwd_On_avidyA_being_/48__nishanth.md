There is a metaphor which talks about putting pure water in a colored

> spectacles. It is as though the truth is being ‘obscured’ by viewing the
> world through a covering of ignorance. But there is not really something
> positive here, in the same way as the colored glass. What is happening is
> that we have accumulated various opinions and beliefs from books and
> parents etc and these are ‘coloring’ our judgment. Even the word ‘coloring’
> is forcing us to uphold the metaphor and believe that it refers to
> something real. But what this actually means is that they are influencing
> our judgment; there is no physical medium in place.

>  Accordingly, one has to wonder if the problem here is simply one of
> language. A new word ‘ignorance’ was introduced to refer to the state of
> ‘not knowing’ but then, because the word became so much a part of everyday
> usage, we started to think that there was an actual *thing* called
> ‘ignorance’. I am reminded of the Alan Watts’ talk which discussed the idea
> of cause and effect and suggested that so-called ‘causes’ were often

> ‘gravity’ being described as the ‘cause’ for objects falling to the earth
> when dropped. And he said that, if we dropped a particular object and,
> instead of falling to the ground, it rose up into the air, then we would
> have called it a ‘balloon’ and not a ‘stone’. Clever though this sounded

> object. I make a fundamental mistake when either I see one thing and think
> it is something else (e.g. I see a rope and think it is a snake) or I think
> something has an attribute that it does not really have (e.g. I think that
> the mirage is actually a lake). There is always something real (the rope or
> the sand with shimmering air above it) and something illusory. The real
> part is unaffected by our superimposition. What is effectively happening is
> that we partially see the real part, the substratum such as the rope, and
> then overlay it with some recollected memory of something else, such as the
> snake.*” There is no immediately apparent reason as to why we should say
> that this happens because of something called ‘ignorance’.
