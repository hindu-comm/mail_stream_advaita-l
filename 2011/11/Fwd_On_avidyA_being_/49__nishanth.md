> In his works, SankarAcArya takes a direct approach to the problem of human
> liberation, and declares that *moksha* consists in realizing the identity
> of Atman with the One brahman. This brahman is in fact, all that really IS,
> and there is no change or multiplicity in It. As for the question, how does
> the perception of multiplicity arise in the first place, Sankara points to
> *avidyA* and *mAyA*. He does not attempt to explicate *avidyA* too much,
> and tells the student not to worry about the logical status of this *
> avidyA*, except to recognize that it is responsible for desires (*kAma*)
> and action (*karma*) which lead to bondage (*bandha*). Therefore, getting
> rid of the *avidyA* leads to *moksha*, which is really not different from
> the *brahman* itself.
>
> After his time, *avidyA* and *mAyA* became a tough problem for his
> followers. Sankara described *avidyA* as *anAdi* - beginningless. His
> approach was informed by the well considered notion that searching for the
> roots of *avidyA* was itself a manifestation of the very *avidyA* one was
> seeking to remove. However, in order to work out the logical implications
> of various advaitic doctrines, his followers had to pay greater attention
> to this issue. In course of time, two sub-schools, known as the bhAmatI and
> the vivaraNa schools emerged within advaita vedAnta. The bhAmatI school
> takes its name after vAcaspati miSra<http://www.advaita-vedanta.org/avhp/later.html#vac>'s
> commentary on Sankara's *brahmasUtra-bhAshya*, while the vivaraNa school
> takes its name after prakASAtman<http://www.advaita-vedanta.org/avhp/later.html#pra>'s
> commentary on padmapAda's *pancapAdikA*, which is itself a commentary on
> Sankara's *brahmasUtra-bhashya*.
>
> The most important commentaries and sub-commentaries that define the *
> bhAmatI* school are the following.
>
>    SankarAcArya - *brahmasUtra bhAshya*
>       vAcaspati miSra - *bhAmatI*
>          amalAnanda - *kalpataru*
>             appayya dIkshita - *parimala*
>             lakshmInRsimha - *Abhoga*
>          allAla sUrI - *bhAmatI tilaka*
>          SrIranganAtha - *bhAmatI vyAkhyA*
>
> There are a large number of texts in the *vivaraNa* school. The important
> commentaries are:
>
>    SankarAcArya - *brahmasUtra bhAshya*
>       padmapAda - *pancapAdikA*
>          prakASAtman - *vivaraNa*
>             akhaNDAnanda - *tattvadIpana*
>             citsukha - *tAtparyadIpikA*
>             AnandapUrNa vidyAsAgara - *vivaraNa TIkA*
>             sarvajnavishNu - *RjuvivaraNa*
>             rangarAja dIkshita - *darpaNa*
>             nRsimhASrama - *bhAvaprakASikA*
>             yajnanArAyaNa dIkshita - *ujjIvinI*
>          amalAnanda - *darpaNa*
>          nRsimhASrama - *vedAntaratnakoSa*

> root *avidyA* (*mUlAvidyA*), which is universal, and is equivalent to *
> mAyA*, and an individual *avidyA* (*tulAvidyA*), which vanishes when *
