सदात्मध्याननिरतं विषयेभ्यः पराङ्‍मुखम् ।
नौमि शास्त्रेषु निष्णातं चन्द्रशेखरभारतीम् ॥

  Unattached to objects of the senses, Immersed in the Self day and night
Skilful in sacred lore, which He does live, My salutations to
Chandrasekhara Bharati.


Namaskaraa-s to one and all.

This is a follow-up to my earlier mail about the Maharudram event in the DC
area in April 2012  to commemorate the centenary year celebrations of the
coronation of  Shri Shri Jagadguru Chandrasekhara Bharathi Mahaswami of
Shri Shringeri Sharada Peeta.

Many of you had evinced interest to know more details. I have contacted
some and obviously missed others. So please patiently go over the flyer or
the website stated below.

is too big to be posted:
