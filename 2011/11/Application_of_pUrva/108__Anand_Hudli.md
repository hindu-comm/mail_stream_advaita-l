One of the conditions for applying the apaccheda nyAya is
"anyonya-nirapekShatA" of the two cognitions, i.e. mutual independence of
the two cognitions. In the example stated above, the first cognition is
really referring to the second cognition and negating it. When the second
cognition  arises, it is "dead on arrival". It is a case of "upakrama
nyAya", another maxim provided by mImAMsA (more on this later). In the case
of the apaccheda nyAya example, the two cognitions arise from two mutually
independent  and mutually non-interfering sources, perception and the
Veda.
