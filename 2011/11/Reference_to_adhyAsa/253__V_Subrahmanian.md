Namaste.

It is said that the औत्पत्तिकसूत्रम् in the शाबरभाष्यम् for the
जैमिनि-sUtras contains the sentence 'शुक्तिका हि रजतवदवभासते' that
Shankaracharya mentions in the adhyAsa bhAShya as an example for adhyAsa. I
request the learned members to give details as to the context in which the
sentence is found in this early mImAmsaka text.

Regards,
