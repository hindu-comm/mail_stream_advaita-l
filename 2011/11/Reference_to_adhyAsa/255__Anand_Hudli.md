I found a similar sounding sentence that describes "bhrama" in
pUvramImAMsA. It is from 3.8.24 where the shAbara bhAShya says, "यस्य
हि दर्शनस्य प्रमाणं नास्ति व्यामोहः सः। यथा शुक्तिकायां रजतविज्ञानम्।
" which describes erroneous cognition as a view that lacks the support
of a pramANa.

The context is:  In the darshapurNamAsa,  whether the adhvaryu directs
the Agnidhra or the Agnidhra directs the adhvaryu to perform certain
actions? The pUrvapakShin says it is the Agnidhra who directs and the
adhvaryu performs, whereas the siddhAnta is that the adhvaryu directs
and the Agnidhra
performs.
