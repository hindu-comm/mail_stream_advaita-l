I said nothing of the sort. I said that SankarAcArya does not talk of your
substitution. kaliyuga began with the end of kRshNAvatAra and of course,
SankarAcArya lived in kaliyuga. So your assertion of using goat meat in
this particular rite is without the backing of SishTAcAra or AcAryopadeSa.
At least, that is the case till you can quote some authority in support. 

What this also means is that in the times that SankarAcArya lived, the
practice, if it was followed at all, must have been exactly as described
in the upanishad text. No special appeal to ukshA and Rshabha being 
herbs and no substitution of goat - as per the bhAshya - that is all that
I am saying. Nothing more, nothing less.

The ritual of a husband and wife cooking rice and having a meal together
immediately after a monthly period is a kAmya rite. As such, there is no
"should" about it. Procreation is not dependent on this particular ritual.
One can choose not to do it at all.
