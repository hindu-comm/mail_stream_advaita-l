This is what I said also.

Nobody has said Shashtra is wrong. We have to take indirect meaning
when direct meaning is not correct.

I completely agreed with this earlier in Sanskrit 'Kaliyuge
Vrushabhamamsasthane Chagamamsam Prayujyate'. If Shastra Vakya is
asking to use Bull meat we have to substitute it in Kali Yuga by Goat
meat or for Brahmins only vegetarian substitute. This is what I am
saying but others are saying we have to use Bull meat in Kali Yuga
also. That is wrong. Kindly read messages from Vidyasankar and
Bhaskar.

Sri Vidyasankara is saying Adi Sankara lived in Kali Yuga. If he says
use Bull meat we must obey it. I say no. We should not use Bull meat
in Kali Yuga.

I agree 100% with this.
