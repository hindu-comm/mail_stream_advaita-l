Yes a Sista will consider Sankara Bhashya but he must also consider
Smruti and other references. If he does that he will 100% conclude
Sankara Bhashya cannot be taken directly because the direct meaning is
against other works. He must take the modfied meaning of Sankara
Bhashya and not eat Bull meat if he has desire to have a learned son.

Try this if possible. Anyone can ask Sri Bharati Tirtha Svami, Svami
Raghaveshwara Bharati of Ramchandrapura Math or Mani Dravid Sastrigal.
They will all say a man cannot accept Bull meat today if he has desire
for a learned son and he wants to follow the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad
ritual. They will all say a Brahmin has to substitute by vegetarian
meal.

Try this also. Look at Anandagiri or some other Vyakhya for Sankara Bhashya.

No I did not say interpret in any way you please but I am saying look
at Smruti, Purana and Sistachara before you jump to conclusion about
Bull meat. Is there anything wrong?

I am making a very important point but not seeing dichotomy. Adi
Sankara has agreed his Bhashya has to be examined according to Desha
and Kala. I am saying we have to examine his Bhashya looking at very
important things like Smruti and Sistachara, Desha and Kala Dharma. If
there is a problem with direct meaning we have to take indirect
meaning according to today's circumstances. That is all.  There is no
chance to modify interpretations will nilly.
