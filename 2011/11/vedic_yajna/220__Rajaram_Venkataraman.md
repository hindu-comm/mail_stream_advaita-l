RV: If you think Vedas prescribe meat eating in this age also, you should
be true to your convictions. However, any point has to be established with
references. According to Shri Haridas Sastry, who holds 14 traditional
degrees including ones in Nyaya, Vyakharana etc., the Br. Up. verses and
Shankara Bhashya both do not refer to young or old bull. His arguments are
in the public domain as part of "Review of Beef in Ancient India". I have
not seen any one countering it logically or independantly establishing
based on knowledge of rituals that the procedures involve killing a bull.
