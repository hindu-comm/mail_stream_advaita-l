If there are experts in rituals, I would like to know what ritual is
referred to in this passage of Brihadarnyaka Upanishad and the procedure
outlined there - whether it involves use of medicinal herbs or bull's
meat.  Without expertise in rituals, one cannot interpret these passages as
that will be superficial.
