I am repeating earlier statements. We have to follow Sruti keeping
respect for Desha and Kala Dharma also. 

praNAms
Hare Krishna

This is a general question, not anyway related to meat or beef eating.  If 
shruti vakya needs to be interpreted according to desha & kAla, then 
jnAna/dhyAna  mArga is not recommended for kali yuga and bhajans & naama 
saMkeertana are the only appropriate means for mOksha..there is plenty of 
references for this in other smruti and paurusheya texts..so, do we have 
to understand shruti vAkya accordingly??

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
