Fertility of modern males is going down because of pollution and
drinking alcohol, smoking and allopathic medicines. Alcohol can cause
impotence also. Naturally sex performance is poor. For females the
fertility decreases rapidly with aging. This is why in olden days they
used to get girls married very early.  Ayurvedic herbs like
Ashwagandha  and Shilajit for males and Shatavari for females may be
used. Kapikacchu is good for improving fertility of both males and
females.

>From science point also meat eating is bad because the animals are
high in the food chain. The effect of pesticides and dangerous
chemicals will get multiplied in higher food chain levels. From eating
vegetables at the bottom of the food chain the bad effect of
pesticides and chemical fertilizers will be minimized.
