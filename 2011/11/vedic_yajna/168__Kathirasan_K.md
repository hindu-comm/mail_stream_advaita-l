Namaste ji,

Hope the quote below from the manu smrti helps:

na maaMsabhakSaNe doSo na madye na ca maithune |
pravRttir eSaa bhuutaanaaM nivRttis tu mahaaphalaa || 5.56

There is no sin in eating meat, in (drinking) spirituous liquor, and in carnal
intercourse, for that is the natural way of created beings, but
abstention brings great rewards.

Kanchi Paramacharya , shastras, and common practice have accepted meat eating for many jaathis in the 4 Varnas. However, sanyasis, most Braahmana and Vaishya males are veg as per shstras. For others who are veg, it is not mandatory, rather choice but of higher merit. Just as using flour images instead of animals in yagna.
