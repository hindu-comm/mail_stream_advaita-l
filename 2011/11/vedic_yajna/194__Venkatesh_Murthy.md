Question- Do you say we have to use Bull meat in Kali Yuga? If Yes you
are in contradiction to Smruti and Sistachara. If Adi Sankara said
Bull Meat in Upanishad Bhashya we must and should substitute by Goat
or vegetarian diet because we are living in Kali Yuga. We cannot
disobey Smruti and Sistachara even though Adi Sankara said use Bull
Meat.

If answer for above question is No you must agree Adi Sankara's words
cannot  mean Bull meat directly even though he said Bull meat. We must
substitute by some other thing like vegetarian diet for Brahmins and
Goat for other Dvijas. This is only logical conclusion. No other
conclusion is possible.
