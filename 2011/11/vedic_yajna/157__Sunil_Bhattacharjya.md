Will the same happen if you consecrate the meat first (to the Lord in his Mrigendra roopa) as suggested by Manu?

Namaste. I have heard ISKCON too refer to the above dictum - one who
eats an animal's meat thereby is liable to be eaten by that animal in
a future incarnation in a retributive reversal of roles - "maam so
atti". But is there a specific dharma shastra shloka which clearly
enunciates the above dictum ? It would be nice if someone knows the
existence of any such shloka.
