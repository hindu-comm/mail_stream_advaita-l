Namaste Sri Vidyasankar

I want to make a simple point because I also want to  end  this long
debate. There is misunderstanding of my point. Sruti describes Brahma
and Dharma. But I firmly believe the Dharma Sastras must come to our
rescue when we read Sruti Vakyas on Dharma and Achara and Vyavahara
matters. If Vedanta is talking Brahma but not Dharma and Achara no
need to consult Dharma Sastra. But if Sruti starts to say something on
Dharma, Achara and Vyavahara we have a lot of Dharma Sastra sources
coming to our rescue. Because Dharma keeps changing. Sruti says
something but thing may not be Dharma today.

Take the example in Bruhadaranyaka Upanishad 6-4-7 it is asking the
man to strike his wife with a stick or hands if she is not yielding to
have sex with him to produce a son. He can strike her and make her
yield to sex desire. Can you follow this Sruti Vakya today? Many times
a wife is not interested in sex when a husband is asking. Should he
strike her for not being interested? I think if a man strikes his wife
for not having sex, he may be committing a wrong act. In cities and
foreign countries like USA, she can lodge a police complaint and they
will come to arrest him. If someone beats his wife for refusal of sex
and the police come he cannot say he has not committed any mistake
because he has followed Sruti. Can you try this argument with the
police? This is a good example here Sruti is talking Dharma not Brahma
and Dharma is changing. We have to be careful in following Sruti Vakya
here.

 We have to use Dharma Sastra and other laws of the country and modify
the Dharma, Achara, and Vyavahara points in Sruti to match our Desha
and Kala Dharma. If we don't do it we may not be doing Dharma but
Adharma only. Some parts of Dharma depend on Desha and Kala but others
are not and there is no issue with them. Meat eating is Desha and Kala
dependent. We have to carefully understand meat eating points in
Sruti. Beef eating is against Dharma according to Dharma Sastra. If
Sruti is saying eat Bull meat we have to modify it using a substitute
only. If Adi Sankara said Bull meat can be eaten we have to again
modify it to suit our times. Substitutions are already done for
Sraddha and Bali like in Navaratri. I am not saying something new.

I agree Adi Sankara may have accurate knowledge of matters for
interpreting Sruti. But he has allowed re interpretation of his
Bhashya if needed to suit Desha and Kala Dharma.

Simple question. Do you sincerely think Sistas of today will say we
can Bull Meat?

Misunderstanding. Rishis did not commit sin eating meat. I said Tapas
to show if we follow them in meat eating we should follow their good
practices like Tapas also. I am not saying Adi Sankara is not looking
at Aghniya but he is writing custom of some other Yuga in eating Bull
Meat. In Kali Yuga his statement has to be modified.

I am not saying that. They may have used in animals in other Yugas but
our Dharma Sastra granthas like Nirnaya Sindhu are prohibiting
Ashwamedha and killing Bulls now. Brahmins should not eat meat. Cows
were not killed because they are Aghniya. In Ramayana also they have
written Bull meat was used. But this was Treta Yuga.

The Upanishad and the Bhashya have to be modified for our Desha and
Kala even for the fifth possibility. No Sruti Vakya can ask us to act
against Yuga Dharma.

Even if a strict Agnihotri knowing all four Vedas today wants a
learned son he cannot eat Bull Meat because Dharma Sastra tells him it
is prohibited.

There is a problem in Principle. Even  the strictest Vaidika today
cannot eat Beef under any circumstances. He may eat other meat only in
a Yajna but he can avoid that also if Pashu made from flour is used.
Substitutions are necessary. This is according to Dharma Sastra.
