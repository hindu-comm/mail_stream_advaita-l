RV: I agree but Shankaracharya does not clarify what uksha and rshabha are.
According to Haridas Sastry (Review of Beef in Ancient India), uksha and
rishabha refer to medicinal herbs of the same shape still found in India.
He says that the first few verses in the chapter talk about the role of
medicinal herbs in producing high quality retas setting the context
for his interpretation. There are few otherarguments as well in the book.

I wanted to know the Vedic Yajna referred to in the Upanishad. I suppose
that the detailed procedure will be described in  Srauta Sutras. That will
tell us clearly what is meant by uksha and rishabha here.
