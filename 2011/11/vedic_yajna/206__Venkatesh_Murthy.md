Namaste

It is not impossible for people more knowledgeable than Nirnaya Sindhu
author to be available. But we have to see some evidence. Some person
X cannot come and say Nirnaya Sindhu prohibition of Beef in Kali Yuga
is not correct without giving evidence he is more qualified. I am
asking where is the evidence? He can also give a counter saying from
another scholar  more qualified. AFAIK no scholar has given evidence
why Nirnaya Sindhu must not be followed.

I already gave Vedic reference from Yajur Veda 'cows are not to be
killed' but people are ignoring it. The Vedas will not say do this in
Kali Yuga and do this in other Yugas. It is the duty of the Smrutis to
say that.

It is dumb to say our ancestors Rishis were eating meat so we can eat
it. The conditions and environment in those days were different. Now
it is different. If we say Rishis were eating meat so we can eat we
must be prepared to do other things they were doing also. They were
doing Tapas without food and water for many years. Are you prepared to
that? No. Then why say we can eat meat because Rishis were eating. If
you say our ancestors were eating meat in Yajnas. Are you prepared to
do Yajnas continuously for many days? Do you have stamina and patience
to do that? No. Then why say we can eat meat like our ancestors. It is
hypocrisy.
