Namaste

But there are many Srauta Yagas here the Pishta Pashu animal made from
food grains is used not a real animal.

Eating Mamsa is sin because Mamsa means Mam So Atti, He will eat me.
Who will eat whom? If you eat Mamsa today the animal will eat you in
next Janma. The eating is reversed in the next Janma. The knowers of
Dharma Sastra say this.
