The matter is not so simple to end there. Question- If a man living
today in 2011 wants to get a learned son and he sees Sankarbhashya
talking of Bull meat for getting a learned son, should he follow A the
Sankara Bhashya or  B should he follow the Sistachara and Smrutis
prohibiting cow meat and bull meat and make subsititution?

If your answer is A it is wrong because it contradicts Smruti and
Sistachara. Sri V Subrahmanian has said Sankara Bhashya allows
modifications or following Sistachara in case of doubt. If answer is B
you are correct.

There is a general permission to modify a ritual if it has meat
prescription. No particular permission is needed. Sankara Bhashya is
agreeing Dharma can be changing.  Even the eating Bull Meat becomes
Adharma now. Example in Navaratri the Brahmins will cut a Pumpkin for
Durga, not an animal. In Sraddha they are using Urad Dal not meat.
Like this whenever meat is prescribed we have to substitute by
vegetarian food for Brahmins. Some exceptions for Soma Yaga are there
but no Cows are used. Even there some use flour made animals.

He has allowed his own interpretation to be modified according to
Subrahmanian's mail. When there is conflict in Srutis we have to look
at Smruti, Purana and Sistachara. Vedas saying Cows are Aghnya is
conflicting with the Upanishad talking of Bull meat. Now we have to
look at Smruti and Sistachara only. There is no other way.
