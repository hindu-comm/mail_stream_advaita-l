praNAms Sri Venkatesh prabhuji
Hare Krishna

But if Sruti starts to say something on Dharma, Achara and Vyavahara we 
have a lot of Dharma Sastra sources
coming to our rescue. Because Dharma keeps changing. Sruti says something 
but thing may not be Dharma today. 

>  Whatever may be the issue here, imho, this is one of the basic 
misunderstandings of vedic saMpradAya.  For dharma jignAsa also shAstra in 
the only pramANa.  In the very first sUtra of brahma sUtra shankara 
clarifies how the dharma & brahma jignAsa different from each other. 
Interestingly during his explanation, shankara gives the example of pashu 
vadha krama in yagna where it has been explained how first heart and then 
tongue to be cut in a particular ritual.  So, IMO, there is not second 
opinion among traditionalists with regard to authority of shruti/veda in 
both dharma & brahma jignAsa. And there is no desha, kAla restrictions as 
such for the declarations of veda/shAstra.  Shankara himself clarifies 
this in his commentary somewhere, ayam dharmOyamadharmamiti shAstrameva 
vijnAne kAraNam, ateendriyatvAt tayOH, aniyata desha kAla 
nimitatvAccha..(reference in third adhyAya somewhere).  So, it is an 
erroneous thinking if we say shAstra can be substituted & modified by 
paurusheya grantha & AcharaNa. 

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
