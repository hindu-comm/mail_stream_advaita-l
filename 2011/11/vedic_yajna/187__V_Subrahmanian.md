Owing to a problem with my computer I am unable to compose and send
replies.   A series of semi colons get typed involuntarily. During one of
these bouts by mistake a 'reply' containing just semi colons got 'sent' to
the List.  Kindly bear with this.

This reply was possible when the computer miraculously permitted me to
compose this.

Regards,
v.subrahmanian.
