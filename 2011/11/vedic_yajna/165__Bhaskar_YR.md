In nirUDha-pashubandha, the pashu bali is there. 

praNAms Sri Sriram prabhuji
Hare Krishna

Is it work or a ritual, pls. clarify.  It reminds me anga nyAsa, kara 
nyAsa in shata rudreeya recitation.... nirUdha pashubandhAtmane 
anAmikAbhyAm namaH / kavachAya huM.  I was told that pashu bali would not 
take place exactly at the yAga shAla it will be done some nearby place 
some Ritvik would bring the essential part to the yAga shAla...??

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
