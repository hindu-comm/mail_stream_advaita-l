I agree with you we need Pramana for practice. But here the Shastra
says two contradicting things in two places. In Yajur Veda Samhita
Ishe Tvorje it has said cows are Aghniya and in Br Upanishad for
getting a learned son a man can eat Bull meat with rice. How to solve
this contradiction? Practice is the solution. In Practice there is no
beef eaten for getting a learned son. The Br Upanishad must be given
different interpretation to avoid Bull  meat consumption.
