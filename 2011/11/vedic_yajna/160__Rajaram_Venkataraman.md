I know animal sacrifice is part of many srauta karma and also know that
there are bhagavathas who interpret aja to mean seed etc. I am not even
going there because I know that animal sacrifice, whether we like it or
not, is part of vedic yajnas.

The intent of my post here is to understand the specific ritual referred to
in the Br. Up. verse quoted. And whether the procedure involves killing a
bull or taking medicinal herbs.
