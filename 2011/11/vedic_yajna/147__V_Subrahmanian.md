In all these cases Shankaracharya has Himself placed  a rider in His own
BhAshya-s.  For example in the sutra bhashya He says:  यस्मिन् देशे काले यो
धर्मो अनुष्ठीयते स एव धर्मः देशकालान्तरे अधर्मो भवति ॥ In the Taittiriya
bhashya too this occurs in a slightly different manner for the mantra अथ
यदि ते कर्मविचिकित्सा वा वृत्तविचिकित्स्ता वा स्यात्
'[In case you have a doubt as to how you should perform a particular action
or as to how you should conduct in a particular situation] then the
conduct/behaviour of the noble minded living in that place/time will be
your guide.'
Thus the interpretation of His own Bhashya-s are to be made in the light of
His own words above.
