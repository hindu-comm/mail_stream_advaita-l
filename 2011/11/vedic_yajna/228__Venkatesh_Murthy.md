No. What happens if a man wants to have a learned son and wants to
follow the ritual in Point 2. He must substitute by vegetarian diet.
He must take indirect meaning of Sankara Bhashya. Adi Sankara has
agreed we have to consider Desha and Kala Dharma not blindly follow
his Bhashya like sheep. Even though Adi Sankara said Bull meat but in
today's circumstance we must not follow it.
