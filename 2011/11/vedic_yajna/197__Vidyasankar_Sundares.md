Your question is superfluous, as I already gave you the answer to this. You
need to read before writing. In my opinion, your view of the SAnkara bhAshya 
vs. smRti and/or SishTAcAra is a totally false opposition. Any SishTa worth the
name today will consider and give due weight to the SAnkara bhAshya before
deciding on what should be done. That is, if such a question arises in the first
place. Your own personal opinions of what the smRti says and what SishTAcAra
should be is a poor substitute.

Not only the taittirIya SAnkara bhAshya, but the taittirIya upanishad itself
advises you to follow the example of learned people who are committed to
dharma.

Where? Provide an authoritative citation that makes a universal and general
substitution. Morevoer, you first substituted goat meat for bull meat. Now you
claim otherwise, in a more general sense, for all meat.

Please note, it is easy to mistake what I am saying, as you seem to have done
consistently. All I am arguing for is that you cannot interpret as you please, just
in order to satisfy your own preconceptions of what dharma is.

He has not. He has only advised you to take the advice of and emulate the
behaviour of learned SishTa-s in the case of doubt about dharma. That is
a far cry from saying he allowed his own interpretation to be modified willy
nilly. Do you think SankarAcArya was so ignorant of even "ishe tvorje" that
he would overlook the application of the word aghniyAH in that very first
yajur vAkya when he commented upon the bRhadAraNyaka reference to
ukshA and Rshabha? What nonsense is this?! I reiterate, the dichotomy you
see is completely false and of your own making. That is all.
