Dear friends,

You are so right. The sanyashi has to give up the fire as the fire is internalised by the sanyashi. To remind the sanyashi of that he has to wear the fire-coloured robes only.

Cows are holy no doubt and that is why the exception is made only in a special case. According to the Brihadaranyaka upanishad only that mother, who wants to have a child, who will go for mastering the four Vedas, could only take veal and not the others. Obviously the ancient people knew of some nutritional factors in veal that helps.

Regards,

Sunil KB

Namaste

We cannot follow SankarabhAshya for all matters like Yajnas. A
Sannyasin writing details of Yajnas is not the correct authority. He
said some remarks on Ganapati worship in Gitabhashya but all Smartas
worship him. Chief Message of Adi Sankara is Advaita Philosophy. There
he is highest authority.

Moreover there is authorirty of Smrutis saying गावो मे मातरः सन्तु
पितरः सन्तु गोवृषाः and तासां तु पूजया राजन् पूजिताः पितृमातरः When
the Smrutis are asking to worship Cows they cannot be killed. That is
why Cows are called A-ghnya in Vedas also. अघ्न्या means it cannot be
killed. In the dictionary you will see Aghnya means cow only.
