Ghee is a common element in all these cases - sarpishmantam aSnIyAtAm...
The specific additions to the odanam (cooked rice) are kshIra (milk), dadhi
(curd), udaka (water), tila (sesame seeds) and mAMsa (meat) of ukshA or
Rshabha.

SAnkarabhAshya says, "mAMsa-miSram odanaM mAMsaudanam. ... auksheNa
vA mAMsena, ukshA secanasamarthaH pungavaH, tadIyaM mAMsam. RshabhAs
tato'py adhika-vayAH, tadIyam ArshabhaM mAMsam".

Please note that Sankara bhagavatpAda lived very much in the kaliyuga and he
does not talk of any substitutions for ukshA and Rshabha here.
