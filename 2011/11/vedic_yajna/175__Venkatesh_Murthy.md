Yes Adi Sankara is greatest authority for Vedanta but he went from
Brahmacharya to Sanyasa. His knowledge of rituals would be theoretical
not practical. In ritualistic acts he can repeat what he heard from
others but not from personal experience.  In many texts they say
Madhuparka must have meat in it. But today in practice there is no
meat in Madhuparka. Theory is sometimes not same as practice. A
Brahmachari Sannyasi cannot be writing from experience how to eat Bull
meat and get a wife pregnant with a learned son. What about Vedic
prohibition of cow slaughter? He has to take it very seriously. We
have to take his writing of Bull meat not with direct meaning but
considering Sruti prohibition of cow slaughter. This is how we can
justify Goat meat not Bull meat. But we South Indian Brahmins are not
eating even Goat Meat today and we can use flour made Goat in its
place. Other Dvijas can use Goat meat. In North India Brahmins are
eating meat.
