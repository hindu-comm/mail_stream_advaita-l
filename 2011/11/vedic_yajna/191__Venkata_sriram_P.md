Namaste murtyji,

//
But here the Shastra says two contradicting things in two places.
//

Shastras never say any contradictory statements. Even if it seems contradictory like
"uditE juhOti / anuditE juhOti", it is said as per the adhikAra lakShaNa. 

//
In Yajur Veda Samhita Ishe Tvorje it has said cows are Aghniya and in Br Upanishad for
getting a learned son a man can eat Bull meat with rice. How to solve
this contradiction? Practice is the solution

//

Yes. Practice is the solution. It is the firm faith & conviction in vedas & shastras which is required. 

The father of Sri Sivabhinava Nrisimha Bharati Mahaswamigal performed "pumsavana" to his wife at the 7th month of pregnancy and he had firm faith in that karma that a male boy would be born. And thus, incarnated swamigal with the dakshinamurty kaLa. 

Our shAstras have decided the days for garbhAdAna saMskAras / punaHsandhAna etc. for thecouple who desire male / female progeny.Maithuna in odd & even days decide the gender of the progeny which is quite contradictory to scientific observation of x & y chromosomes. 

First practice the sAdhana prescribed in the shastras and they find the facts rather than 
brush aside the shAstra vAkya. 

As far as gO-mEdha & madhuparka are concerned, nirnaya sindhu has clearly defined this 
as:

madhuparkE pashOrvadhaH mAmsadAnaM tathA shrAddhE vAnaprasthAshramastathA
mahAprasthAna gamanaM gOmedhashcha tathA makhaH imAn dharmAn kali yugE
varjyAnAhurmanIshiNaH

ie., pashu vadha during madhuparka puja, usage of mamsa during shrAddha, gO mEdha yajna are prohibited in Kali Yuga. Which means, these were prevalent in other yugas. 

In parAshara mAdhavIya :

ashvAlaMbhaM gavAlaMbhaM sanyAsaM palapaitrukaM
dEvarAccha sutOtpattiH kalaU pancha vivarjayEt

ie., in kali yuga these 5 are prohibited :
a) ashvamedha yajna b) gomedha yajna c) usage of meat in shraadha
d) begetting child through devara (husband's brother) & tridanda sanyasa

Which means, these were prevalent in some other yuga. 

regs,
sriram
