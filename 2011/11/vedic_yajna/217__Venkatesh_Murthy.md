This is the Iskcon message very efficiently delivered. But we have to
see Sistachara. We find many Sistas like Sri Bharati Tirtha Svami Sri
Raghaveshwara Bharati Svami and others like them are going in the
Jnana Marga. Jnana Marga is not Nishiddha for Kali Yuga. Even
Taittiriya Upanishad had asked to see the Sistas and follow them if we
have a doubt.  But we cannot find Sistas like them eating Beef. Beef
eating is Nishiddha. This is the Vital Difference.
