Though this thread has spun off into other directions, I wanted to
return to the original question for a minute. Those who are truly
interested in the details should look at the annaprāśana ritual found
in the gṛhya sūtras. There are strong similarities.

For example, we can look at the āśvalāyana gṛhya sūtras.

आजमन्नद्यकामः।
तैत्तिरं ब्रह्मवर्चसकामः।
घृतौदनं तेजस्कामः।
दधिमघुघृतमिश्रमन्नं प्राशयेत्।

The prayoga texts provide additional details.

With regards to the current discussions (which I have little interest
it), here is something of note: haradatta miśra has commented on both
the āśvalāyana and āpastamba gṛhya sūtras. On the former, he says
"तित्तिरेः विकारं तैत्तिरं तित्तिरिः पक्षिविशेषः तन्मांसम्". On the
later, he says "मांसं व्यञ्जनम् ओदस्य। अन्ये तु मांसम् एव"

sasneham,

    ajit
