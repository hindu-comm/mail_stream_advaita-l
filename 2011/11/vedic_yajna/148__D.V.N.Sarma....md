What happence to the purva mimamsa position
tht smritis are valid so long as they do not go against sruti and
sishtachara is valid only as long as it does not contradict sruti
and valid smriti? How can smriti which prohibits gavalambham and
palapaitrukam be valid vis a vis sruti 's injunction?

Sarma.
