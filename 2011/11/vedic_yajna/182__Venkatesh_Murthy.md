One lecture I remember from Kutumba Sastry a learned scholar in
Sanskrit. He said even the sutra literature was the final point of the
experience in that field. Many times practice is there from the
beginning and theory comes afterwards. For rituals also the practice
comes first and theory afterwards.

Yes Viruddha Acharana may happen but the original Acharana is correct
one. It will be preserved and practiced by the knowledgeable people.

Shastra is saying in another place that is first Yajur Veda Mantra
"Ishe Tvorje" the cows Aghniya cannot be killed. Then how can Shastra
say eat Bull Meat in another place like Br Up. Are you saying cows
cannot be killed but bulls can be killed? This is meaningless.

If studying hard makes him learned why is Shastra asking to eat meat?
If Shastra is giving results we can get from another source it will
have no authority.

Mandana Mishra argued with Adi Sankara on a different point. Is Veda
authority for Karma only or does it have authority for Jnana matters
also? The discussion was on Shastra only not practice. His wife was
asking for experience in sex matters.
