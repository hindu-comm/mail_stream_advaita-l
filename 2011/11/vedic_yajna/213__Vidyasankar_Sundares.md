The last part of my previous post got truncated.

I meant to say: Therefore, there really is no contradiction in the fact that the meat
of bulls is to be consumed as per the upanishad, for a specific ritual context, and
the general Hindu orientation towards privileging a vegetarian diet. When you take
things out of their proper context and start arguing about what is sin and what is
not, you will soon end up in contradictions. Intellectual honesty demands that we
accept the past for what it was, understand that the present is different and not
make unnecessary judgements in the process.
