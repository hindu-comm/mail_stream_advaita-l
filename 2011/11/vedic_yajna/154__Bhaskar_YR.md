Without expertise in rituals, one cannot interpret these passages as
that will be superficial.

praNAms
Hare Krishna

AFAIK, wherever the meat is suggested in shrauta yAga vidhi-s, without 
interpreting these injunctions in a peculiar way the Acharya would follow 
as it is..I myself have seen this ritual in sOma yAga held at Mattur some 
year back...Interestingly,  it is the part of the ritual in these shrauta 
yagna-s that adhvaryu will have to taste the meat..Though he is not taking 
it in quantity (just as we do in pongal, rasAyana, panchAmruta etc. :-)) 
he will just touch the meat with the index finger and taste it at the tip 
of the tongue to complete the formality.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
