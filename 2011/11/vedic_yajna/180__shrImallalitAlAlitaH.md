Take help of vAkya-shAstra. It will help you deduce correct meaning. It
will help you determine area of application of one vAkya and it will also
tell you where a vAkya is not applicable.

Practice is no solution on it's own.
It's based on deductions of vAkya-shAstra, i.e. mImAMsA.

That's wrong way of thinking.
I ask the basis of lack of practice of eating of beef ?
What will you say ?
If shAstra, then you must not blame theory-part. Give it proper reverence
and hence don't tell what you told about shrI-bhagavatpAda.
If you say that basis of lack of eating beef is practice itself, then read
again previous replies which shatter away this stand.

Sometime ago a person started a thread saying that AchAra is independent
pramANa in dharma. He quoted some sUtra-s too. See our replies there. They
are applicable to your present view.
