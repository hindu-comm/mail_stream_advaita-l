Dear Rajaramji,

I expected a more knowledgeable discussion from this forum with reference to actual ritual procedure.

It will be nice to hear the details of the rituals if anybody has the same. However in the Kaliyuga the performing a Yajna 

may not necessarily be the recommended way or the preferred way of Sadhana.

Regards,

Sunil KB

Subject: Re: [Advaita-l] vedic yajna

So, if I want a brahmana son learned in the four vedas should I
slaughter a bull and eat that meat with rice for dinner? Should I kill
it myself or ask someone to kill it? Should I eat the meat be raw or
cooked? Is there any restriction on the quantity or should I eat to my
heart's content? Should I kill a bull every day until conception or
can I refrigerate and reuse? Is there any ritual to be performed at
all or chanting of any mantras? Muslims chant their mantras to get rid
of the sin of killing in halal.

It may be hard to convince my wife who will quote Lord Krishna's words
about eating only the remnants of a yajna to avoid sin. She will quote
what Kanchi Mahaperiyava says about restrictions that Brahmanas
should eat only pea nut size of meat from specific soma yajnas. She
will quote the existing practice among learned elders where meat is
not offered even in sraddha ceremonies. She will ask if Upanishads
should be followed in regard to karma khanda without reference to
grhya or kalpa sutras that describe the procedure. One thing that is
certain is she will vomit the dinner and I probably will think it is a
precursor to pregnancy days :)

I expected a more knowledgeable discussion from this forum with
reference to actual ritual procedure.
