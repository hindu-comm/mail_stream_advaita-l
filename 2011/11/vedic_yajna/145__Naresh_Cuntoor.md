The original text and the commentary are quite clear. Unless you redefine
the words mAMsa, puMgauH, RShabha, sechana, vayaH, etc., I don't see how
can see herbs and medicines here. And no, I haven't read the book you
quoted. After reading the fanciful interpretations mentioned here, I am not
going to run out to get a copy either.

Best,
Naresh
