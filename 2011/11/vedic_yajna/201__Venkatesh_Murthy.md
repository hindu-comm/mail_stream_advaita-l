Because the Yuga boundaries are given in general headings like Nirnaya
Sindhu gives. If they give in general heading they will not keep
repeating in Kali Yuga do this don't do this.

Not correct. Beef is prohibited  by Vedas, Smruti and Sistachara. What
more do you want? Other meat can be eaten by non Brahmins but Brahmins
cannot eat even other meat. This is for South Indian Brahmins. For
North Indian Brahmins beef is prohibited. We have to respect Desha and
Kala in Dharma discussion. There can be changes because of Desha and
Kala.

Not correct. Husband and Wife cannot eat prohibited items like beef in
special occasions. If they eat saying Adi Sankara has said it they
will commit sin.
