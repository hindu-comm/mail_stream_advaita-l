This line of argument is faulty.  If only theory is known and practice
is different from theory there is no use of this theory. If theory is
saying Madhuparka must have meat and practice is saying Madhuparka
does not have meat it is clear practice is the winner of the contest.
Adi Sankara may have studied Mimamsa theory but when practice is
different we cannot take the theory words as direct meaning. We have
to take indirect meaning to satisfy the practice. He said Bull Meat
but in practice there is no Bull meat. Also in practice we know to
make son learned he must study hard. He will not become learned
because his father ate meat and impregnated his mother.

That Parakaya Pravesha incident was later than writing the Bhashya.
But the Parakaya Pravesha proves experience is the best teacher.
