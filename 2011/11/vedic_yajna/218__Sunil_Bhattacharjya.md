Then why not see the Dharmasundhu, which was written two centuries later than the Nirnayasindhu and specially because it is even nearer to our time and if you think that nearness to our time is the most important thing tyo be onsidered ? Following your logic probably Kane's work also can claim to have a higher status than both the Niraayasindhu and the Dharmasindhu. This will show the fallacy in your argument. I find your equating the Nirnayasindhu with the original Darmashastra texts somewhat strange.

Nirnaya Sindhu prohibition of Beef need not have to be substantiated
at all because a Dharma Sastra book is based on Sruti, Smruti, Purana,
Itihasa and Sistachara only. Otherwise no one will call it as a Dharma
Sastra book. Any person challenging it will have to produce evidence
to show it is wrongly prohibiting Beef. No body in this list has done
it so far.

I am repeating earlier statements. We have to follow Sruti keeping
respect for Desha and Kala Dharma also. If Brihadaranyaka has beef
eating rituals we have to respect Desha and Kala Dharma from books
like Nirnaya Sindhu and avoid beef in that ritual. It does not mean we
have to not perform the ritual but it must be changed to suit our
times.
