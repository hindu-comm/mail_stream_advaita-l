You may be referring to the verse III.1.2.21 in the Satapatha Brahmana.

Not correct. Beef is prohibited by Vedas, Smruti and Sistachara. What
more do you want? Other meat can be eaten by non Brahmins but Brahmins
cannot eat even other meat. This is for South Indian Brahmins. For
North Indian Brahmins beef is prohibited. We have to respect Desha and
Kala in Dharma discussion. There can be changes because of Desha and
Kala.

No, on the other hand, as I told you earlier, there are plenty of 
maNtra-s in rig veda, shatapata brAhmaNa, manu smruti etc. where you can 
find (unless there is a 'special' interpretation to this as per yuga 
dharma) meat/beef eating is well within the vedic saMpradAya. During the 
course of the discussion in some group, I was told that in shatapata 
brAhmaNa rishi yajnAvalkya admits of beef eating by him coz. it is soft 
and tasty :-))...but I donot remember any reference to this. And shankara 
himself in bruhadAraNyaka without going to interpret br. mantra in a 
superfluous way simply says uksha is rishabha..and manu smruti too talk 
these things in a clear way without room for any ambiguity. But I do 
agree that now the practice of these rituals/injunctions drastically but 
does not mean there is lack of reference in our ancient scriptures. 

Since I see no further benefits from this discussion & non-veg items are 
not in my menu card, I shall stop my discussion in favor of 
non-vegetarianism:-)) 

Thanks for your patience & time. 

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
