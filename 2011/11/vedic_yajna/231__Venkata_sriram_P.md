Dear Sarma Garu,

///
Dear Sri Sriram,

I tried to put in Telugu lipi, what you had quoted is from abhinava
Sankara's SrI SatarudrIya bhaashya. Please check if this is correct?

//

Yes. The telugu script is verily the transliteration of the english version.

If my explanation is differing anywhere and if i have crossed my limits, 
kindly correct.I stand corrected.

regs,
sriram
