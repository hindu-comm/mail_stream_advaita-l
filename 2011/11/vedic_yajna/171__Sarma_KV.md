To *add* to what Sri Sriram told:

*Satarudreeyam* occurs in *yajurvEdam* which is the central of the vEda-s
which specifically has the *swarUpa* of all yajna karma-s. Siva is vEda
swarUpa and *Satarudreeyam* extolls His Glory. Hence the *nyaasam*
*invokes*Rudra as the
*swarUpa* of the 6-fold essentials of *yajna-karma*-s as follows:
1. *agnihOtraatmanE* - the central aspect of all *Srouta karma*-s viz. *
agnihOtram* (implying/indicating nitya *agnihOtram* that is agni-dEva's
essential existence.)
2. *darSapUrNamaasaatmanE* - *darSapUrNamaasa* is name for the special "*
ishTi*-s" which are performed on *amaavaaSya* and *pUrnIma*, in addition to
nitya *agnihOtram*.
3. *chaatRmaasyaatmanE* - *chaatRmaasya*-s are performed once in every 4
months. These are also *ishTi*-s but bigger than the fortnightly ones.
4. *nirUDha-paSubandhaatmanE* - *paSubandha* is being mentioned here (the *
swarUpa* of which is also Rudra.) *paSubandha* is not a *yaaga/ishTi* on
its own; for example like *nitya agnihOtram*, one doesn't perform a
periodic *paSubandha*. It is a constituent of another bigger *kratu*-s like
*jyOtishTOma*. As per "*vasantE vasantE jyOtishaa yajEta*" (perform
jyOtishTOma every year) it occurs annually.
5. *jyOtishTOmaatmanE* - *jyOtishTOma* or the first of the "major"
jaagam-s; also called *sOmayaagam*. This (and other higher yajna-s)
involves a prescribed number of *paSu-bandha*-s. Highest among them is *
vaajapEyam*.
6. *sarva-kratvaatmanE* - the last of the nyaasa-s mentions that rudra is
the swarUpa of ALL kratu-s.

Please note the gradual expansion of the gamut of the kratu-s as the
nyaasam proceeds - starting with the most basic aspect, the agnihOtram and
culminating in the summation of all kratu-s.

I doubt that the nyaasam means in some way that Satarudreeya paaraayaNa (or
otherwise its utilization) "confers" the benefit of performance of these
kratu-s. nyaasam is invocation of the respective aspects of the dEvata.
For example, in other mantra-s, say *gaayatri* when we say "*varENyam
vishNvaatmanE*" - does it "confer" vishNutva on the one who performs the
japa?

Satarudreeya has got *its own benefits*. Veda-s are devoid of redundancy;
if one ritual gives results of another, the vaidika mata would not hold the
two!
