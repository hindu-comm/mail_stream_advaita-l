Namaste

Why do we worship Gods like Vishnu, Siva, Durga and others? Because
they are all praised in the Puranas and Vedas also.

The cows are also praised in Puranas, Vedas and Smruti literature. In
Samudra Manthana Kamdhenu came out like the Moon and Lakshmi.
The Kamadhenu is well known for giving all boons to everyone. The
daughter cow Nandini of Kashyapa and Surabhi lived in Vasistha's
Ashrama. We know in the battle with Vishwamitra the cow brought out
soldiers and defeated Vishwamitra.

Like these there are many stories praising cows. In Vedas also cows
are praised. That is why we worship cows. Goats buffalos and camels
also give milk. We must respect them also. But there are no stories of
them in our sacred texts . No need to worship them.
