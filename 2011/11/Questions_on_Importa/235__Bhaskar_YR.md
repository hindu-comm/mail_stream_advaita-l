praNAms 
Hare Krishna

1 He is saying even Sandhyavandana has Tantric influences. What are they? 
Nyasa?

nyAsa-s we do by  reciting veda maNtra-s as in laghu nyAsa & mahA nyAsa

2 He is saying Advaita of Adi Sankara has Tantric influence. How?

if you link advaita siddhAnta with kundalini perhaps awakening of it may 
require some tantra based ( or haTha yOgic) practices.  And it is scholars 
opinion that prakaraNa-s like prapancha sAra, soundarya lahari etc. works 
in the name of shankara have strong tAntric influence. 

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
