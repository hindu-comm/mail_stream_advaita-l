Sandhyavandanam does seem to have some aagamic influence, does it not ?

For example -
1. The tarpaNam includes the names of keshava, naarayaNa, maadhava,
govinda, viShnu etc. While each of these names, had they occured in
isolation, say, in an upaniShad, could have been justifiably
interpreted as referring to Brahman, directly or indirectly ; their
being mentioned one after the other in sandhyaa seems to point to a
bhAgavata influence.

A related question would be, whether there is any evidence to show
that sandhya-vandanam has evolved in some manner, since vedic times.

2. The nyAsa done with aacamanam to has the same names as the above.
