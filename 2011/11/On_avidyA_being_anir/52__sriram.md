Dear Members
I just tried to understand the concepts of jnana,ajnana,avidhya and 
anirvachaniya etc.The logical analysis appears to be on not on firm 
grounds.These things exist not as entities but as qualifiers.Jnanam of 
something which is different from the concept of jnanam is 
understandable.There is no jnanam of  jnanam.So when I say I donot know I 
mean I have some inputs but these inputs are not adequate to establish this 
is that.So to correctly know the object I do a google.This is Vidhya.Avidhya 
literally means absence of study-say mananam/nidhidhyasanam-.A guru helps to 
get rid of avidhya.I donot think avidhya is anirvachaniya except in the 
context of using it as anadhi or as an axiom.This is not to belittle the 
research done by some of our posters.
Just my views on these concepts.R.Krishnamoorthy.
