Dear Sri Raghav Kumar
The word google used was to indicate the search through immediately known 
source or repository of knowledge/information.It is for us to go through the 
stored /updated information to finally arrive at what is correct.As it is it 
is nothing to do with Google search engine.R.Krishnamoorthy.
