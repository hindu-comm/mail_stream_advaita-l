In support of jIva being the support of avidyA the following verse/mantra
is apparently stated in the Advaitasiddhi:


स्वेनैव कल्पिते देशे व्योम्नि यद्वद्घटादिकम् ।
तथा जीवाश्रिताऽविद्यां मन्यन्ते ज्ञानकोविदाः ॥

A pot for example, comes into being in the vast space and occupies a place
even while containing (pot)space within it. In the same way the jiva comes
into being and occupies a place in avidyA even while containing avidyA
within itself.  Thus do the wise hold.

Would anyone please provide the reference of the above verse/mantra?
