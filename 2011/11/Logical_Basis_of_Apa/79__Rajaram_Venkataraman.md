*I think he suggested it as a good translation not as an alternative to
traditional learning. He, like most Hindus, may not understand the politics
behind sponsoring academic positions to research in to Vedic traditions,
which leads to such good translations. It is four-fold - *
**
*1) understand and destroy through counter arguments (e.g. attack on caste
system without explaining the Hindu rationale)*
*2) understand and misinterpret (e.g. introduce new concepts alien to Veda
dharma such as Dalit) *
*3) understand and neutralize (e.g. show that amman worship is similar to
mother mary worship) and *
*4) understand and enrich (e.g. include kavadi, bharatha nattiyam, yoga,
saffron etc. in to christianity) so that christians dont leave the fold for
better variety outside. *
**
*There is no room in Christianity to accommodate other religions. Jesus is
the ONLY way, truth and life. And Bible is the revealed word of God. A
Jesuit priest such as Clooney cannot accept revelations outside the Bible
and without vatican support he will be ex-communicated leave alone get a
job in Harvard. *
