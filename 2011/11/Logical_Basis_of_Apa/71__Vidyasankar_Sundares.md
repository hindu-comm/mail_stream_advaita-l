The short comment to the above:

I will only say this much. Do not believe all that you hear; judge for yourself.

The long comment:

Prof. Clooney is a scholarly and very insightful writer on multiple Hindu
traditions. Yes, he is a Roman Catholic, a Jesuit priest to boot. That only
makes him not-Hindu; he can by NO means be described as anti-Hindu.
One could perhaps disagree with his observations/conclusions for valid
scholarly reasons, but to merely dismiss it all as somehow "anti-Hindu"
just because of his commitment to his own religion is a grave injustice
to the man and his scholarship.

Someone else could lay the same charge against Prof. Lance Nelson too,
who teaches at the Catholic University of San Diego. But I think you know
that calling Prof. Nelson anti-Hindu would be a grossly unfair description
of the person.
