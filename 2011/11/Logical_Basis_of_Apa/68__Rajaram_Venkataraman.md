*I met him this summer and he is open to teach me. And plan to reach out in
December when I will be there. My intent of learning from his was to
present the gist traditional defenses in a historical context.  However,
from my reading so far, I do not think Mimamsa reasoning will apply in
modern context because it is based on premises that are not acceptable to a
modern mind (e.g. eternal varna). Hence my attempt to create a logical
defense. I am happy to be corrected. *
