He will give bookish answers and wrong answers. If you want to study Chemistry you can go to a college to learn from Professors practicing in labs.

What should matter most is not the issue of learning from westerners. 

What matter most is their dedication, perseverence, hard work & commitment 
towards learning a new language & subject which is entirely foreign to them.
Their mastery of sanskrit, shastras & puranas are simply amazing. 

We young hindus should first learn these from them and i concur in this matter
with Vidyasankar Ji. I am a student of shakta philosophy and especially tantra shastra. 

I used to refer theworks of Sir John Woodroofe, Prof. Alexis Sanderson & Prof. Mark Dyczkowski (currently a professor of philosphy in Banaras Hindu University with specialization in Kashmir Trika Siddhanta) and i found them mind blowing. 

So much of depth in their writings & what a deep understanding into the subject !!

Whereas, we indians, even though sanskrit is accessible to us with goodscholars
around us, we fail to utilize our time optimally.

sriram
