But if we want to learn Mimamsa why should we go to a Christian
Priest? Better to learn from a Brahmin.  The Christian Priest cannot
be trusted because he has secret agendas. He is not living like a
Vaidika practicing Vedic religion.  He may be eating  beef drinking
wine and writing.   He will give bookish answers and wrong answers.
If you want to study Chemistry you can go to a college to learn from
Professors practicing  in labs. If you want to study law you have to
learn from law college professors practicing law. You must not learn
from books by non practicing person.
