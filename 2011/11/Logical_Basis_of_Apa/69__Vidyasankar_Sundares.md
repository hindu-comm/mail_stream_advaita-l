In which case, I would provide my best wishes and encourage you to make the
most of the opportunity to learn the subtleties of Mimamsa reasoning from the
learned Sastrigal. You might also, if your studies with him progress quickly, want
to ask him to explain how the pUrva and the uttara Mimamsa perspectives differ
on sound and the veda, keeping in mind the sphoTa angle of the grammarians
that is in the background. I think you will be pleasantly surprised how "modern"
the opinions and conclusions of some traditional thinkers can be!

My angle is this. Any contemporary reconstruction that you may want to do
regarding the veda's status as apaurusheya texts will have to take into account
the contemporary ideas about the origin of the universe, origin of life (if there
was a temporal origin for life post Big Bang) and evolution of human beings.
Unless of course, you only want to address creationists from other religious
backgrounds. Given that human beings with human ears to perceive sound
were not around at the origin of the universe (even in the brAhmaNa and
AraNyaka descriptions, the universe began before men and women were
born to perceive it), you will have a lot of perspectives to cover and tackle.

Best wishes,
Vidyasankar

ps. If you are interested in pursuing further thinking on the Mimamsa aspects of
Vedanta, one English language author you absolutely need to read is Francis X.
Clooney. He has written a number of papers and books on Mimamsa and I think
you will find a lot of it useful.
