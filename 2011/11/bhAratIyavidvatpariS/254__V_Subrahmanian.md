Namaste.

Thank you very much for the extensive references and explanations.  From
your quoted portion I am able to see one more close similarity  between the
mImAmsA shAstra and Shankara bhAShya:
 तत्रापरीक्ष्य प्रवर्तमानो अर्थात्  विहन्येत अनर्थं चाप्नुयात् कदाचित्.|
 [This is the pUrva mImAsA sentence from the shAbara bhAshya]
 At the end of the bhashyam for the first vedaanta sutra 'athAto
brahmajijnAsA' we find this sentence:
अत्राविचार्य यत्किंचित्प्रतिपद्यमानो निःश्रेयसात्प्रतिहन्येत अनर्थं चेयात्
।
This sentence is available in the shAnkara bhAShya (adhyAsa bhashya last
sentence):
अस्यानर्थहेतोः प्रहाणाय आत्मैकत्वविद्याप्रतिपत्तये सर्वे वेदान्ता
आरभ्यन्ते ।
Anyone interested in an English version of a discourse by the eminent
Vidwan Dr. Mani Dravid SastriNaH on the adhyAsa bhAshya can read the same
which is available for free download:

Warm regards and thanks,
