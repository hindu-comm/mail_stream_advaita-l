Dear Advaita Forum Members,

I read on the advaita forum about the explanations for Saundarya lahari rendered by Prof Ramanathan along witht the explanations given by Thethiyur Subramanya Sastrigal. If some body has it and can share a copy please let me know. I have been seeking to get a copy for some time.

Thanks
Ramani
