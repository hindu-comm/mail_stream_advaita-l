I would like to know if there is any text, Tantric or otherwise, that
describes  mahAlasA or mhALasA devI, as She is called in Maharashtra. She
is the consort of the mallAri who is believed to be an incarnation of Shiva
to fulfill the purpose of killing the demons maNi and malla. mallari is a
popular deity in Maharashtra/Karnataka and has many temples dedicated to
Him, the most famous temple being the one in Jejur. There is a Sanskrit
work called the mallari mAhAtmya or the mallari saptashatI which also forms
the basis of the mallari homa.  Currently, we are observing the mallAri
ShaDrAtrotsava, and a question related to mhALasA came up. According to
some accounts, She is an incarnation of both Vishnu/Mohini and ParvatI.

Perhaps, Shri Sriram-ji or others know of this Goddess.
