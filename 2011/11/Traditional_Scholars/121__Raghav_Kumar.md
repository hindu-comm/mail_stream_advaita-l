I am surprised to see people dismissing even sympathetic and scholarly
expositions coming in from western scholarship, by advancing ad
hominem arguments. There is palpable angst caused by other factors.

Certainly yes, that goes without saying.

But as far as I am able to see, only an advaitin  is permitted and
encouraged to do the kind of questioning and analysis of everything
under the sun, including his own underlying assumptions and cultural
conditioning, which alone makes the dictum quoted above, truly
meaningful. Conversely, anyone who is able to empathetically
understand other traditions without distortion and misrepresentation,
*including especially advaita vedanta*, is willy nilly an advaitin,
whether or not he choses to describe himself in that manner.  My
facile position is that once the vedanta-pramANa works through
receptive study of Advaita, we cannot unlearn advaita vedanta since it
is not another set of concepts and beliefs to be believed in and
subscribed to or set aside by choice; the effect of the study of
advaita vedanta being very similar to "growing up" ; an adult cannot
regress back to childhood.

His (vAcaspati miSra's) position is surely the traditional position that the conclusions of Vedanta on Advaita etc are true and the rest of the schools are only provisionally true (for some adhikArI-s) to the extent that they fill in the details of various sAdhana-s (yoga) and upAsanA (mImAmsa) and nyAya (yukti-s employed in various contexts).
