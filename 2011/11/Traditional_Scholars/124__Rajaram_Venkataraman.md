Regarding other posts on this topic, I am not saying that the modern
scholars (not specifically pointing to western scholars) cannot understand
because they do not practice but because they do not know. You can
understand a sentence only if you knwo it. In the same way, you can
understand a text, only if you know it. You can read here and there, talk
to a few people around and then claim to be a scholar. You (Clooney etc.)
can definitely claim to be a student.

Now, even the traditionalists may not know all the texts by heart. They
dont claim to know but that they agree with their preceptor. Even Bhrgu
Maharishi, smrti says, did not know all of Vedas. It does not mean that
there are none. In his commentary to Vishnu Sahasranama, Shankara says that
Kapilacharya envisioned all of Vedas.

I am not talking about realization but scholarship alone.
