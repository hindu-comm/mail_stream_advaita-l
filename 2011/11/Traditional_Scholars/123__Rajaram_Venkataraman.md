*Let us say, you want to know the opinion of Madhwacharya on a topic, will
you go to A or B? You may disagree with A's conclusion because it
contradicts with what you know from B. But as far as Madhwa is concerned,
you will consider A to be an expert not B. All I am asking is that you
apply the same standards in judging a western scholar. If he does not know
the texts, please do not advertise him as an expert. *

*Now A might, in addition to his deep knowledge in Madhwa's works, might
also gather summary knowledge in other subjects through experts in the
respective fields. Due to the combination of depth in his tradition and
breadth in other schools of thought, he will still score well above B. *
