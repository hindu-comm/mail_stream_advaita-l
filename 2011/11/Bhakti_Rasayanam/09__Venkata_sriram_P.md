Namaste,

The works of MS I have are (in telugu) commentary on Siva Mahimnah Stavah,
BG Gudartha Dipika, Bhakti Rasayana, Advaita Siddhi. Apart from these, Shri MS composed a melodious hymn on Bhagavan Krishna called “Ananda Mandakini Stavah”. A copy of the same was edited in Telugu and is recently published (no idea about other languages). 

Historical records say that Sri MS was born in Faridpur in West Bengal. Born in the Lineage of famous tarka scholar Sri Ramachandra Bhattacharya. Learnt tarka under Harirama Tarka Vagisha & Kamala Nayana (S/o Purandara Misra) in Navadvipa. Took turiya ashrama from Visveshwara Saraswati. 

Among the several disciples of Shri MS, one was Shri Sesha Govinda Pandita who 
Wrote commentary on Sarva Vedanta Siddhanta Rahasya. He was the son of
Sesha Krishna Pandita. Sesha Krishna Pandita was the guru of the father of
Jagannatha. 

Shri Madhusudana’s cardinal principle in “Bhakti Rasayana” & “Ananda Mandakini Stotra” are based on the rasa siddhanta of Alankara Shastra. Shri Madhusudana, for that matter, stands a class apart from traditional advaitic scholars as far as “rasa siddhanta” is concerned.

As per the Shri MS, the “ananda” aspect of Brahman is the only rasa which is also Shanta rasa. Thus, MS equates all 3 ie., ananda, shanta & bhakti . 

Bhagavan Krishna is the personification of all the above 3 aspects which is 
brought out beautifully in his hymn “Ananda Mandakini Stavah”.

Regs,
sriram
