RV: When dealing with a complex subject much care has to be taken to not
group them and generalize. I am sure Muslims and Christians would object if
they were grouped with Jews and their beliefs are treated as one religion -
"The Abrahmic Cult". In the same way, the Hindus have the right to object
to if their diverse traditions are grouped in to one religion - "The Hindu"
- just because they accept the Vedas. As you know, the different traditions
accept the Vedas in different ways. It is within one's human rights to
expect that schools and colleges conform to the different traditional view
point when teaching Nyaya to Vedanta. This is what is done in the portrayal
of Judaism, Christianity and Islam.

RV: CAPEEM and other law suits were based on discriminatory and derogatory
treatment of Hinduism in the US schools and colleges. If you are interested
in the evidence for discrimination, Kalavai Venkat will be happy to walk
you through that.

RV: I agree that Brahman transcends even the Vedas. But the term Sabda
Brahman for the Vedas is used by the Lord in Bh. G. 6.44 to the
Vedas. Madhusudana explicitly says Sabda Brahman refers to the Vedas.
