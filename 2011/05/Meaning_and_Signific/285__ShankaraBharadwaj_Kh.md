The steps in Mantra-anusthana are usually arranged in line with shadanga/astanga 
yoga. The last leg of dharana-dhyana-samadhi is supposed to be achieved with 
nyasa-dhyana sloka-mantra japa.

Namaste!  Could the learned members kindly explain the meaning and significance 
of nyAsA such as anga-nyAsA and kara-nyAsA, that one performs before japa such 
as the gAyatri-japa ?  Thanks and Regards gautham.
