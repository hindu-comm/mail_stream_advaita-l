Yes.

Sarva mean sarva, "all" not "almost all" or "all except".  you cannot give 
up all the dharmas (actions) until you give up the notions of subject and 
object.  Now when you remove all such concepts from your 
sagunatmaka understanding of Bhagavan what is left?  Brahman without 
gunas.

In conversing with Vaishnavas some have expressed that they they avoid 
nirguna concepts because "for a bhakta, seperation from his beloved is 
unbearable."  This is quite alright but is based on misunderstanding.  The 
jnana of Advaita Vedanta takes nothing away.  Rather it is the realization 
of pUrNatA, "fullness."
