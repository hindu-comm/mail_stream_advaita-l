Thanks a lot for indicating this and i referred the Sankara Bhashya which is 
exactly the same. 

But Shri Paramananda Bharati slightly differs with the concept of "AlaMbana" &
"pratima" in his work "vedanta prabodham". His Holiness says "AlaMbana" 
is the "AdhAra" or "pratiShTA" that defines saguNa brahman whereas 
pratima in the form of sAlagrAma / linga etc. is the representation on which kArya brahma tattva is superimposedfor chitta ekAgrata. 

AlaMbana leads to "Chitta Shuddhi" whereas pratima leads to "Chitta Ekagrata". 

The vidyAs described in Chandogya Shruti are AlaMbana whereas the mUrti pUja is pratIka. 

BTW, His Holiness further states that praNava can be contemplated both in terms of 
AlaMbana & pratIka as the shruti says "yO vEdAdau svaraH prOktO vEdAntE cha 
pratiShTitaH....." and also as the parabrahma-vAcaka which is a pratIka. 

Any mistakes in my understanding, i stand corrected.

regs,
Sriram
