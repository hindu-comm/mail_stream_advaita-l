Dear Sri Srikanta,

Sankara-advaita is not the only version. There was Sankara-pUrva advaita, there 
is the Saiva-Sakta version of advaita which has quite a few differences from 
SAnkara darsana. 



Coming to pariNAma vAda it is not just Ramanuja or Madhva darsana, but almost 
all (in fact all except nyAya and vaiseshika which are Arambha vAda) the 
non-Sankara darsanas are pariNAma vAda in nature - Mimamsa, Yoga, Sankhya, 
Pasupata, Vallaba, Nimbarka, Gaudiya, Rasesvara, Ramanuja, Madhva are all 
pariNAma vAda in one way or the other. 


"Shankara's Advaita is no doubt Advaita.There ar no Shankara's Advaita or any 
other Advaita."

This is the feeling I get from many of the postings, and I do not think that is 
correct. Moreover, not all advaita schools are vaivarta. 


"If parinama vada is the real one "

There is no question of real or incorrect. That is one way to explain the world. 




Shankar

 There is no division in Advaita.there are no Advaita of variou types as the 
questioner above has raised.-Shankara's Advaita is no doubt Advaita.There ar no 
Shankara's Advaita or any other Advaita.The Vivarta Vada in Shankara Siddhanta 
as opposed to parinama vada has ben discussed by many scholars.If parinama vada 
is the real one then the reality "Brahman"in the Ramanuja theory cannot be 
without change.Then it is contradictory to what Ramanuja claims as "Brahman"is 
real with real attributes in "Satyam.Jnanam Anantam "Brahma". N.Srikanta.
