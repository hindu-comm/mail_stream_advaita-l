What I meant to say is that the uniqueness of Sankara darsana lies not in
non-dualism itself but in the vivarta vAda. So the moment we bring in
vivarta
concept most of the criticism on Sankara darsana does not hold ground.>>


Dear Shankar,

The uniqueness of advaita-vedAnta lies in the understanding of the ***mithyAtva
of causation*** and not in vivartavAda. What advaita-vedAnta provides is a
lot more than just another theory of causation.

"Non-dual" in advaita-vedAnta is not another "ism" or "vAda". It implies, at
the very least, an understanding of the falsehood of pramAtR^itva itself.
There is no question of the satyatva of a view, position or vAda when
pramAtR^itva itself is not satya.

Ramesh
