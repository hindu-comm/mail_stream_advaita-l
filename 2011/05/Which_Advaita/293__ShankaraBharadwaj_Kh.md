Thank you. Both dual and non-dual positions are stated by various dArsanika-s. 
What I meant to say is that the uniqueness of Sankara darsana lies not in 
non-dualism itself but in the vivarta vAda. So the moment we bring in vivarta 
concept most of the criticism on Sankara darsana does not hold ground.

________________________________

  This list is primarily meant to focus on Sankaran advaita vedAnta.  There is a 
kind of advaita within the broad rubric of mahAyAna buddhism, as also many 
contemporary variants of monistic/non-dualistic thinking. And there are many 
variants of vedAnta, which are not non-dualistic in nature.   These are not the 
primary focus of this list, but thoughtful and insightful comparative 
discussions are welcome. So long as a discussion doesn't degenerate to 
meaningless levels and doesn't get derailed by someone wanting to have the last 
say ...   Regards, Vidyasankar
