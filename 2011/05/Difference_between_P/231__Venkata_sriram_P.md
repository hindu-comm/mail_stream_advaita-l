Namaste,

///

When we speak of that enduring atman while 
still embodied we use the term pratyagatman

//

Just a side note to above.

pratyagAtma splits itself as "pratyak+Atma". 

Now, "pratyak" is further understood as "prati+aMch". The author of Ratnaprabha defines
this as:

"prAtilOmyEna asatjaDadukhAtmakahaMkArAdi vilakShaNatayA satchitsukhAtmakatvEna 
aMcha iti" which implies that which shines in the innermost space.

So, "pratyagAtma" is that which shines in the innermost Self.

IMHO, Atma, pratygAtma, paramAtma are all one and the same. The only difference is in the upAdhi.

regs,
sriram
