Both sAnkhya and Sankara Advaita include jnAna mArga. Here are the most
important differences 

- sAnkhya is pariNAma vAda and advaita is vivarta vAda
- The multiplicity of phenomenal world is explained by sAnkhya in terms of
multiplicity of Purusha. Advaita limits the multiplicity to phenomenal world
