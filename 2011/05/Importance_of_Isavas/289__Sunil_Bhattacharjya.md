I think the Mundakopanishad is for the sanyashis as the name suggests and sanyashis do the mundana.

Dear Srikantha,

//

The "Isavasyopanishad"is right in the middle of the Samhita.
That is the reason why it is given a prime importance among the Upanishads.

//

But in Muktika Upanishad, Bhagavan Sriramachandra says:

"mANDUkyaM EkamEvAlaM mumukShUNAM vimuktayE"

which says that mANDukya upa. is more than enoughby
mumukshu for serious study.

reg,
sriram

The "Mandukyopanishad"is meant for only sanyasis.It is difficult to understand the "mandukyopanishad"in total,and even well verses Pundits feel it is difficult to understand the concepts.But,the "Isavasyopanishad'can be easily understood with the Bhashya of Shankara.
N.Srikanta.
