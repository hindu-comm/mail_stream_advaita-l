Dear Jaladharji,

Thanks a lot Jaladharji for uploading the same.

I was hoping to make this announcement on Shankaracharya Jayanti day but unfortunately other events intervened but perhaps it is just as well. In truth every day is
the right day to pay respects to the Guru.

Doesn't matter if it is not announced on Sankara Jayanti. Incidentally, today (Vaisakha Shuddha Saptami) is Shri Vidyaranya Jayanti and GangOtpatti Dina.

And Vidyaranya is no less scholar who is on par with Sankara and ascended Sringeri Pitha. 

So, it is just another coincidence !!!

regs,
Sriram
