I am subscribed to dvaita list and advaitin groups and some good discussion 
groups. As a student of various schools of Indian philosophy I would like to 
keep myself informed about the various nuances of dvaitadvaita discussions. 
Please confirm my membership. Thank you.

I am interested to know the points to counter the 7 non entinels of 
anupapatti given by Sage Ramanuja in his Sri Bhasshyam which negate the 
theory of Adhvaita. Please help me in this regard, so as to enable me to 
know the real picture whether the doctrine of Adhvaitham is non fallacious.
