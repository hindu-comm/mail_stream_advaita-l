So, you mean that everything opposed to your AchArya and philosophy should
be thrown away from your texts ?
Or, you want to throw away any text in whole which teaches like this, even
vedas ?

Can't say now. People holding different views should come to think upon it
according to shAstram. I don't have faith in so called 'free inquiry'.

Agreed.

How was it that direct disciples of buddha were unable to understand his
teachings, even when dhamma-pada was there ?

I'm curious to know which buddha was indicated in our texts ? After
confirmation it will be easy to direct my shraddhA ?

Agreed. Vedas themselves tell such things.

because we couldn't identify buddha of purANas ? and because we are unable
to conclude that he was not totally against veda.
