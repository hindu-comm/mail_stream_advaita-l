श्री प्रह्लाद उवाच—
श्रवणं कीर्तनं विष्णोः स्मरणं पादसेवनम्
अर्चनं वन्दनं दास्यं सख्यमात्मनिवेदनम्।
इति पुंसार्पिता विष्णौ भक्तिश्चेन् नवलक्षणा
क्रियते भगवत्यद्धा तन् मन्येऽधीतमुत्तमं॥
— श्रीमद्भागवतम् ७-५-२३
śrī prahlāda uvāca—
śravaṇaṁ kīrtanaṁ viṣṇoḥ smaraṇaṁ pādasevanam
arcanaṁ vandanaṁ dāsyaṁ sakhyamātmanivedanam|
iti puṁsārpitā viṣṇau bhaktiścen navalakṣaṇā
kriyate bhagavatyaddhā tan manye'dhītamuttamaṁ||
— śrīmadbhāgavatam 7-5-23

Prahlāda Mahārāja said: Hearing and chanting about the transcendental holy
name, form, qualities, paraphernalia and pastimes of Lord Viṣṇu, remembering
them, serving the lotus feet of the Lord, offering the Lord respectful
worship with sixteen types of paraphernalia, offering prayers to the Lord,
becoming His servant, considering the Lord one's best friend, and
surrendering everything unto Him (in other words, serving Him with the body,
mind and words) — these nine processes are accepted as pure devotional
service. One who has dedicated his life to the service of Kṛṣṇa through
these nine methods should be understood to be the most learned person, for
he has acquired complete knowledge.
