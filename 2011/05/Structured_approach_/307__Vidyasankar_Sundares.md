The distinction is between whether a little knowledge of the Sanskrit language is
useful or a deep, thorough grounding in the language is needed. I think  what Sri
Shyam is saying is that the latter is not essential, and I agree. Some familiriazation
at a basic level with Sanskrit terms is nice, but one does not have to be able to 
read Kalidasa and Bhasa in the original Sanskrit, if one's goal is to study advaita
vedAnta at a personal sAdhana level.
