>From : H.N.Sreenivasa Murthy
Pranams to all.

Dear Sri Venkata Sriram,

    What Sri Shyamji has stated is 100% correct.

      To know Vedanta Sastra Knowledge of Sanskrit is absolutely essential
because the goal of the learner is to become a mantravit or a pandit.

      For one whose goal is to become Atmavit knowledge of Sanskrit is not
at all required.The Truth about one's TRUE NATURE /ATMAN can be conveyed in
one's own mother tongue . What is required is the presence and guidance of a
kaunaguru who has realized or knows what he is teaching. Finally Atman is
not in books or in Sanskrit language. It is within you and is prior to the
formulation of doctrines.

   DO YOU WANT TO BE A KNOWER OF SHASTRA
                                   OR
   DO YOU WANT TO BE A KNOWER OF ATMAN?

        The choice is left to the person.

With respectful namaskarams,
   Sreenivasa Murthy.
