Dear Shyamji,

I beg to disagree with the statement below:

/////

If the goal is to become a teacher, or a well-versed scholar,or perhapsenjoy reading raretexts of Masters which have yet to be translated or even enjoy the beauty of the original prose- it is certainly useful, but if self-knowledge is the only goal for study - as it 
should be - I dont see any need whatsoever for a thorough study of Sanskrit

//

IMHO, the lack of sanskrit knowledge is always a handicap. 

regs,
sriram
