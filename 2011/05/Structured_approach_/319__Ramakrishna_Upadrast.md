namaste,

Could you please read a little book titled "Elements of Style" by
Strunk and White?  Here are a couple of free links:

http://www.crockford.com/wrrrld/style.html
http://www.bartleby.com/141/

It could improve some of the deficiencies in the form of what you are
writing, though not in content.

> _____________________________________________________________________________-With reference to the above Email,it is like a school going student who complains of not studying his text books,because the lessons are lengthy.Insead,he wants to be content studying poorly written bazzaar notes with lot of printing mistakes.it seems Sri.shankara Bhagawadpada had anticipated these weaknesses of the seekers and has prepared a well-structured bhashyas which are having noparallel in the Adwaita.There are many who are having half-boiled understanding of Adwaita,but Brahmasutra Bhashya is inevitable for the study of Adwaita.
