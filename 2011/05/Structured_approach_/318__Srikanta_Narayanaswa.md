Pranams
While certainly every one is entitled to his or her own formula for what a 
structured approach to advaita is, IMHO one thing that is best avoided is 
starting with the Brahmasutra - it is a very lengthy andterse text with nuanced 
subteleties best reserved for handling, if oneso desires,once a thorough 
grounding in advaita is already accomplished. 
_____________________________________________________________________________-With reference to the above Email,it is like a school going student who complains of not studying his text books,because the lessons are lengthy.Insead,he wants to be content studying poorly written bazzaar notes with lot of printing mistakes.it seems Sri.shankara Bhagawadpada had anticipated these weaknesses of the seekers and has prepared a well-structured bhashyas which are having noparallel in the Adwaita.There are many who are having half-boiled understanding of Adwaita,but Brahmasutra Bhashya is inevitable for the study of Adwaita.
N.Srikanta.
