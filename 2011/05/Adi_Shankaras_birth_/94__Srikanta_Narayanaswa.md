Max Muller was honest. As soon as he realized his mistake in the AIT time-line he stopped supporting it. All are not equally honest.

BTW does anybody have the verses which Sundara Pandya reportedly lifted from Sankara's Sutrabhashya or even if some may think the reverse to be the case.?

With reference to the above,H.H.Sri Sri Sachidanandendra Saraswathiji of Holenarsipur in his publication of Adhyatma Prakasha Karyalaya at Holenarsipur has mentioned that these verses are from Sundara Pandya which is in the Brahmasutra bhashya.

Max Muller is far removed from either Buddha or Adi Shankara to warrent any placing in the history of these two personalities.
