Namaste

Adi Sankara has referred Sundara Pandya Karika in Bhashya of the 4th
Sutra. Page 45 in Thibaut's translation-

http://www.archive.org/stream/vedntasutrastr01bdar/vedntasutrastr01bdar_djvu.txt

' When there has arisen (in a man's mind) the knowledge,
" I am that which is, Brahman is my Self," and when,
owing to the sublation of the conceptions of body, relatives,
and the like, the (imagination of) the figurative and the false
Self has come to an end^; how should then the effect^ (of
that- wrong imagination) exist any longer? As long as
the knowledge of the Self, which Scripture tells us to search
after, has not arisen, so long the Self is knowing subject; J
but that same subject is that which is searched after, viz.
(the highest Self) free from all evil and blemish. Just as
the idea of the Self being the body is assumed as valid (in
ordinary life), so all the ordinary sources of knowledge
(perception and the like) are valid only until the one Self
is ascertained.'

But there is no name Sundara Pandya mentioned in the Bhashya at all.
How do we know it is in Sundara Pandya Karika? Where is this Karika
found? Any comments?

It will be nice if any of our learned group members can enlighten us on this, preferably by quoting the verses. Otherwise it is going to take time for me to go through the works of Sundara Pandya.
