Dear Vidyasankarji,

With a quick look at the literature I find that the date of Sundara Pandya is linked to the date of Kumarila Bhatta, who was a contemporary of Lord Mahavir, who lived in the 6th century BCE and that explains how Adi Sankaracharya could know about the contribution of Sundara Pandya , who was a big scholar.

Regards,

Sunil KB.

Dear Vidyasankarji,

My intention is to express my surprise that was there really such an exact occurrence of the same verses in Adi Sankaracharya's Brahmasutrabhashya as well as inthe some work of Sundara Pandya. It will be nice if any of our learned group members can enlighten us on this, preferably by quoting the verses. Otherwise it is going to take time for me to go through the works of Sundara Pandya.

Regards,

Sunil KB

Sunilji,

I would request more careful wording from you. It is well established that Sankaracharya
quotes Sundarapandya and not the other way round. Usage of the term "reportedly lifted"
carries unsavoury implications of plagiarism, which is absolutely not the case. Perhaps it
is unintentional on your part, but that is all the more reason to be careful in word usage!

There are quite a few thorough studies of whatever meager textual evidence we have for
pre-Sankaran Vedanta. Please see the references mentioned with respect to this, in
http://www.advaita-vedanta.org/avhp/biblio.html.

Regards,
Vidyasankar
