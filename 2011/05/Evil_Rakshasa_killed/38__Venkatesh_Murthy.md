Namaste

Expert comment:

'Congratulations to USA. The US has killed the evil Rakshasa, bin
Laden while the impotent Indian Government, with its minority
appeasement policies, is yet to bring the perpetrators of the 26/11
attack to justice, and while hundreds of thousands of Kashmiri Pandits
have been driven out of Kashmir by terrorists in ethnic cleansing and
live as refugees in their own country. Well done, USA! Shame on you,
India!'
