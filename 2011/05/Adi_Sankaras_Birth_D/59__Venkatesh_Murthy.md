There is added value in discussing Purva Paksha arguments. What are
other positions and how our position is tackling them?  If you pick up
a Grantha like the Sankara Sutra Bhashya it is full of Purva Paksha
arguments. Without Purva Paksha there will not be a desire to know
Siddhanta. Athato Siddhanta Jijnasa.
