The famous astrologer BV Raman has given Adi Sankara's birth date and
horoscope in his book Notable Horoscopes.

http://books.google.co.in/books?id=sXJ02csFd5kC&printsec=frontcover&dq=notable+horoscopes&source=bl&ots=HVggcAceqm&sig=69-2i0wAN0FuO-K-5LQbLdOrs1g&hl=en&ei=wiTBTZiZGofwrQfq5N3tBw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=2&ved=0CCEQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q&f=false

 According to him he has concluded like this-

'As Prof. B. Suryanarain Rao says: According to the records of the
Sringeri Mutt (Guru Parampara Patti) which are well preserved and
reliable, Sankara was born on the 5th day of the bright half of the
lunar month of Vaisakha of the cyclic year of Eswara in Vikrama 14.
This corresponds to 25th March 44 BC.  I am inclined to give greater
weight to the reliability of this date as it is given in the lists
preserved by the Gurus of Sringeri and consequently, there was no
chance of their having been tampered with. Sankara's Guru was
Govindapada, who is said to have begotten by his Kshatriya wife, the
great Vikramaditya. Sankara must therefore have lived about the time
of Vikramaditya.'

If Sringeri Matha has said Adi Sankara's birth date is in 44 BC why
did they celebrate 1200 year anniversary in 1988?

BV Raman says- 'Jupiter's aspect on the Moon denotes profound
spirituality, while the Martian aspect shows a vivid emotional
temperament which animated his philosophical expositions with
matchless charm and dignity.'
