I could not find the answers, That is why  I am asking the list. If
someone knows the answer he can answer. I am still waiting for the
answers.

If  I can easily find the answers I will not ask such questions. You
can say the same thing to Vedanta Desika. Why he asked questions and
objections? He can read the Bhashya and other Granthas and get the
answers. And we can happily ignore him. But this is not the way of our
Advaita Acharyas. They will answer these questions.
