Pujya Sadaji,

CanBhagavat Gita be considered as prakarana grantha ?. I am afraid. It comes under prasthana traya.

BTW, to study the Advaita Siddhanta, per se, Bhagavat Gita "sans" Sankara Bhashya 
is a flavourless recipe.And Sankara Bhashya of BG for a layman is a hard nut to crack.

As regards Dakshinamurty Stotra, one need not go thru the Manasollasa to understand
the basic tenets of Advaita. A simple explanation of the stanzas alongwith pratipadArtha
gives the basic idea of what the underlying principle is and the relation between Jagat-Ishwara-Jiva and the mahavakya "tat tvam asi". 

Any comments, i stand corrected.

regs,
sriram
