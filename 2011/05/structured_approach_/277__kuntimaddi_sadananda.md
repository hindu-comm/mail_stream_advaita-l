Sriram - PraNAms

If I have listed along with prakaraNa granthaas then I am wrong. 
The rest I agree with your email. 
About Ramagita, I still would not recommend that for beginners. It took me several hours of class time to unravel the first sloka - vishvam darpaNa. Basic definitions are taught using tatva bodha text as I know. 

Even for Gita Discourses Swami Chinmayanandaji used to take one or two classes in the explanation of his famous BMI chart - which is essentially a pictorial representation of the tatva bodha text. 

Hari Om!
Sadananda

Pujya Sadaji,

CanBhagavat Gita be considered as prakarana grantha ?. I am afraid. It comes under prasthana traya.

BTW, to study the Advaita Siddhanta, per se, Bhagavat Gita "sans" Sankara Bhashya 
is a flavourless recipe.And Sankara Bhashya of BG for a layman is a hard nut to crack.

As regards Dakshinamurty Stotra, one need not go thru the Manasollasa to understand
the basic tenets of Advaita. A simple explanation of the stanzas alongwith pratipadArtha
gives the basic idea of what the underlying principle is and the relation between Jagat-Ishwara-Jiva and the mahavakya "tat tvam asi". 

Any comments, i stand corrected.

regs,
sriram
