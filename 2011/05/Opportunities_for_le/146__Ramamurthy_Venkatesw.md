Pranam

Shri V Subramanian has mentioned about learning of Sanskrit (by correspondence) and Advaita Philosophy (thro' Skype) (medium of instruction would be either in Kannada or Sanskrit).  I have visited the website of Rashtriya Sanskrit Sansthan and getting enrolled.  If there are scholars who could teach Advaita philosophy either through Tamil/Telugu/English, I will be interested.  I am currently based in Bengaluru.

Please help me.

With profound regards,

Sincerely,



R. VENKATESWARAN

> During my recent participation at the 'Shaankara BhAShya pArAyaNa sattram'

> Asst. Professor, Mukta svAdhyAya Peetham, Rashtriya Sanskrit Samsthan, New

> 
> http://www.sanskrit.nic.in/dis.htm
> 
> He told me that currently there are three popular courses: prAk Shaastri,
> ShAstri and AchArya.
> 
> Anyone interested in starting afresh or furthering their knowledge in
> Sanskrit could make use of the various programmes available with the above
> institution.
> 
> Apart from this, I came across another vidwan, Shri Vasudeva Bhatta from
> Kollur. He studied Rg Veda and Vedanta Shastra at Sringeri years ago and is
> now settled at his native place near Kollur. He too gave a couple of
> presentations at the recent meet. While talking to him, I expressed my
> desire to make his Advaita vedanta knowledge available to those who would
> like to learn. He said he can teach the various works of Advaita in the
> medium of Kannada and Sanskrit.
> 
> It is my intention that if anyone who is seriously wanting to take up

> from him through skype. He does not have the basic infrastructure yet but
> if two or more aspirants come together to provide him the same, he can teach

> 
> There is another scholar in Advaita Vedanta, Vidwan Shri Vasudeva Karanth,
> also taught by Sringeri pandits, residing on the outskirts of Mangalore
> city. He too is willing to teach (in Kannada/Sanskrit). Anyone in the
> periphery of Mangalore can make use of this scholar's knowledge.
> 
> Since this is a traditionally based study, the aspirant is expected to have
> the minimum requirement of having been initiated into upanayanam and doing
> sandhya vandanam regularly. A basic knowledge of Sanskrit would be a great
> advantage.
> 
> Interested persons may please contact me by email to take this initiative
> forward.
