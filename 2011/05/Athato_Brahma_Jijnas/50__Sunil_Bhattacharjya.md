Namaste Venkateshji,

Do you mean to say that Vedantadeshika did not understand the Kenopanishad ?

Then again why not consider Mother Sita's response when she was asked which of the four brothers was her husband?

Regards,

Sunil KB

Namaste Sri Sriram

Good explanation but there can be some counter arguments.

The Sutra Athato Brahma Jijnasa is the first. It is explaining why we
must study Vedanta. Before studying Vedanta if someone tells the
Brahman of Vedanta cannot be known like an object of enquiry and it is
Neti Neti how is it possible to start the studies? This is Vedanta
Desika's question.

Then Visishtadvaitis argue the Sruti is not explaining Nirguna Brahma
will replace Saguna Brahma. We cannot give up Saguna Sruti and take
only Nirguna Sruti as correct. This is the Advaiti position. We have
to take both and explain properly. It is like this.

Draupadi was playing with her friends in the garden. They see
Sahadeva, Nakula, Arjuna, Bheema, Yudhisthira there. The friends asked
her to show her husband. But Draupadi was shy to point out. The
friends point to Sahadeva and Draupadi says Yes. They point next to
Nakula and Draupadi says Yes. They point to Arjuna and Draupadi says
Yes. They point to Bheema and Draupadi says Yes. They point to
Yudhisthira and Draupadi says Yes. But they are all Pandava brothers
and there is no enemity between them. No brother will eliminate
another brother. They all must be taken as Draupadi's husbands.

I hope you see this point.
