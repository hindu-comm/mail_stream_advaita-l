In Satadusani Vedanta Desika has criticised the Nirguna Brahma theory
in the Vedanta Sutras. In the first Vedanta Sutra Athato Brahma
Jijnasa enquiry about Brahman has to be done. About what is the
enquiry to be done? If it is Nirguna Brahma it is not correct because
the Advaiti has said Nirguna Brahma cannot be Jnana Vishaya at all. We
cannnot know it like some object. If it is known like object it is not
Nirguna at all.  Yato Vacho Nivartante says words and mind cannot
reach Brahman.

Then what is the enquiry? This Brahman is explained in Sruti by using
Brhati and Brmhayati. It grows and causes to grow. This becomes
meaningless if Nirguna Brahma is the object of enquiry. It cannot grow
and cause to grow because it cannot have any qualities like growing
and causing to grow. Na Hi Nirviseshataya Abhimate Suddhe Brhati
Brmhayati Iti Srutyukta Nimittam Asti.

If Advaiti Nirguna Brahma is accepted the first Vedanta Sutra becomes
meaningless.
