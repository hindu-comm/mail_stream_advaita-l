Dear Sriram,

As mahaswamigal was completely absorbed in Brahman, he was non-different
from Ambal and her devotee. Ambal was responding to her devotee's devotion
in the form of mahaswamigal. Is that right? I don't know if it is possible
to speculate on the activities the lord or jnani accurately but it is what
it appears to be.

My questions is what happens to karma, yoga and bhakti on attainment of
jnanam. If it is sublated why does the Lord and acharyas define the highest
bhakta as jnani and jnani as a great bhakta?

Best Regards
Rajaram V.
