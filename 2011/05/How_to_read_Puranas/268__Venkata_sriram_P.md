Dear Srikantha,

//

The "Isavasyopanishad"is right in the middle of the Samhita.
That is the reason why it is given a prime importance among the Upanishads.

//

But in Muktika Upanishad, Bhagavan Sriramachandra says:

"mANDUkyaM EkamEvAlaM mumukShUNAM vimuktayE"

which says that mANDukya upa. is more than enoughby
mumukshu for serious study.

reg,
sriram
