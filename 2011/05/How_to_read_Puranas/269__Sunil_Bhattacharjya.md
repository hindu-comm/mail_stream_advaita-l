With Pranam to Lord Ram may I say that the 109th Upanishad in the form of the Bhagavad Gita, which appeared in the Mahabharata at a later date, was not there in Lord Ram's time. The Prasthanatraya takes the Bhagavad Gita along with the upanishads.

Then again the Kenopanishad is so important that Adi Sankaracharya had written two bhashyas on it and that was not for nothing.

Dear Srikantha,

//

The "Isavasyopanishad"is right in the middle of the Samhita.
That is the reason why it is given a prime importance among the Upanishads.

//

But in Muktika Upanishad, Bhagavan Sriramachandra says:

"mANDUkyaM EkamEvAlaM mumukShUNAM vimuktayE"

which says that mANDukya upa. is more than enoughby
mumukshu for serious study.

reg,
sriram
