Have you any proof of that ? How could you say this ?
Direct disciples of buddha were unable to understand him and you can tell
what he wished without having direct contact with him. I can't believe. You
must have some extra organ for perception of these things which are out of
our range.

I don't think he thought anything positive about The Veda. A person
respecting them can not generate a society of people opposed to that.

Nice. After understanding truth and not before that. Take note.

How could I, a follower of The Veda ?
Only for viGYAnI it was said and not for those who are inquiring as you were
trying to propound.

For any doubt see my previous post.
