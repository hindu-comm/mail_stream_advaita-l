Okay. We have different perceptions as one cannot talk about only one type of bauddha mata when Lord Buddha himself had given the basic Hinayana teachings at Sarnath, where he did not talk about the five koshas nor about the Shunyata, to begin with and later on he gave the Mahayana teachings at the Vulture peak, where he did talk about the five koshas as well as about the Shunyata.

I think the Buddha-mata is not a topic of great concern for the Advaitins and once in a while only the talk about Lord Buddha's silence, such as metioned by Gaurapadacharya, pops up.

Sunil, there is only one person who knows the answers to these questions and that is Shakyamuni who is not a member of this list! What we do have is the 2500 years of controversy between astikas and bauddhas who strenuously disagree that their sides are related. Going by that, you are wrong. So why don't you stop beating this dead horse? It is irrelevant for
this list anyway.
