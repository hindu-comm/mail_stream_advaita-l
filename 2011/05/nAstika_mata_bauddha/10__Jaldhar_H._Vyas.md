Sunil, there is only one person who knows the answers to these questions 
and that is Shakyamuni who is not a member of this list!  What we do 
have is the 2500 years of controversy between astikas and bauddhas who 
strenuously disagree that their sides are related.  Going by that, you are 
wrong.  So why don't you stop beating this dead horse?  It is irrelevant for
this list anyway.
