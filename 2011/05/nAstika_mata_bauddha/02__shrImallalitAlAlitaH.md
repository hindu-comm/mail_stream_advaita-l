What do you mean by "go beyond" ?
If "we have to perceive more than what is propounded in shAstra" , then tell
me the mean by which you will do that. Not with your mind, as it is not
pramANam. Not with meditation, repeating vR^itti of one AkAra only produces
concentration and nothing more. And if it produces something it means you
mind was deviated from that. Moreover, mind is not pramANam too.
And what is the basis of you words. Your free will or any word of shAstra
itself.
You are not someone with extra organs for perception of things which are
beyond grasp of others. Moreover, there is always chance to doubt you as
fraud, etc. So, "one has too.." is of no use.
If words have origin in shAstram, then you have to get it's meaning so that
it is not contradicted with other parts of it as "तं त्वौपनिषदं पुरुषम्"
etc.

If this was meant by first part of your sentence, then we have no conflicts.

Free inquiry ?  Free from Apta and shAstram you mean ? Then why you said
that "they are meant to aid".

What matters is one's own realization.  Lord Buddha never said that there is

Own realization is OK. But if you mean own realization originating from
"Free inquiry", then I've to  say something. How would you determine
whatever you realize is truth and not imagination. Same for meditation. One
who is doing "free inquiry"can not have knowledge of truth. So the thing on
which he meditates is not truth too. Now tell me the mean by which you came
to know that there is a relation between meditation and realization , i.e.,
meditation on an unreal thing will lead you to realization of real.
