I believe I have mentioned this before but for the benefit of newer 
members:

The Vishishtadvaita sage Venkatanatha called Vedanta Deshika produced a 
comprehensive catalog of criticisms of Advaita Vedantic theories called 
shatadushani (100 faults.  There are actually 66 altogether.)  In the 20th 
century, the stalwart Advaitin scholar MM. N.S. Anantakrishna Shastri 
wrote a refutation called Shatabhushani.  (100 merits.)  This book is in 
Sanskrit and was published by Khemraj Shrikrishnadass.  I am not aware of 
any translations.

I agree that it might be a good idea if you, Venkateshamurthy or someone 
could post these objections here and we can discuss them one by one.
