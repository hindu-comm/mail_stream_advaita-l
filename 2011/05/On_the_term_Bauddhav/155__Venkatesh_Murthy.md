Namaste

Bauddhavatare means a time reference only. We don't worry what Buddha
did. It is not important for us when we are discussing time reference.
In Puranas Buddha came after Krishna Avatara and before Kalki. Krishna
Avatara happened in Dwapara. In Kali Yuga there are two Avataras
Buddha and Kalki. Buddha has come but we are waiting for Kalki. This
is why we say Bauddhavatare. In Dwapara Yuga probably people were
saying Ramavatare in Sankalpa. From this it is wrong to say Rama was
against rituals and Mimamsakas added it purposely.

Bauddhavatare simply means that the (relatively) most recent of the 10 major avataras was Buddha as Venkateshmurthy pointed out.

I really doubt the Mimamsakas would have inserted it given that they themselves were implacable foes of Buddhism and other types of nastikata.
