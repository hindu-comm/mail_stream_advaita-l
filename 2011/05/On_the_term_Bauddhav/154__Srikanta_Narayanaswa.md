I don't know why Advaita-L keeps getting on the topic of the Buddha but it is not necessary to have any views on him pro or con to understand the reference in the samkalpa. Bauddhavatare simply means that the (relatively) most recent of the 10 major avataras was Buddha as Venkateshmurthy pointed out.

Given that the actual injunction in dharmashastras is only deshakalau samkirtya ("recite the place and time"), the actual form of the samkalpa varies quite a bit by region, jati and sampradaya but bauddhavatare is fairly common across Bharata. I really doubt the Mimamsakas would have inserted it given that they themselves were implacable foes of Buddhism and other types of nastikata.

I very much doubt about this term which means during "Bauddhavatare".It is common knowledge that karmakhanda pundits starting from Kumarila Bhatta,Prabhakara Mishra down to Jayanta Bhatta spared no means to denounce Buddhism.
