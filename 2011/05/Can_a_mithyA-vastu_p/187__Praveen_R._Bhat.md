Hari OM, Venkateshji,

Your posts on this thread has thrown a lot of light on Vishishta advaita
angle on crucial things. I've some comments inline and would be glad if you
could elaborate there.

Since you mentioned Chhandogya, another Sruti, to prove that everything is
in everything, why wouldn't simple kuSha grass do instead of soma here?
Clearly, Chhandogya has as much of soma in perspective as it has silver in
nacre in small qty.

Why can't one see those gold, diamonds or platinum instead of silver in
nacre, why only silver? I'm hoping that the answer is not that there is more
qty of silver that other things.

Shouldn't this 'everything in everything' make one wonder why can't one see
silver in rope and snake in nacre, etc?
