The Badhaka Jnana will be negating the object Jnana Vishaya but not
Jnana.  The silver is false but nobody can  say I did not have
experience of seeing silver. Nobody can say I did not have experience
of seeing snake. The snake is false. The dream object like elephant is
false but nobody will say I did not experience seeing the elephant in
my dream.  The negation Badha is of Jnana Vishaya only and it can be
Mithya but Jnana is Satya. Sribhashya- Tatra Hi Vishayanam Eva
Mithyatvam Tesham Eva Badho Drushyate Na Jnanasya and Na Hi Maya
Svapnavelayam Anubhutam Jnanamapi Na Vidyate Iti Kasyacidapi Pratyayo
Jayate and Darshanam Tu Vidyate Arthaha Na Santi Iti Badhaka
Pratyayaha.
