There are two ways. One Advaita says all is Mithya. But another is all
is Satya. This is also correct because all is Brahman only. There
cannot be a second thing. Visistadvaita is agreeing Brahman is only
thing here. But difference is Brahman is Savisesha not Nirvisesha.

Everything is part of Brahman everything is Satya.

This logic is very strange. A person may feel giddy because of some
illness. Then he will say the world is rotating. But he is correct.
The world rotates on its axis.  The normal person cannot feel world is
rotating but the giddy person feels it. Will you honour the Giddy
person as a great scientist because he can feel world rotation? Will
you employ him in a high position because he has special powers? Like
that the person seeing silver in shell is not a special person. He is
seeing silver because of a defect. He cannot have special power of
seeing silver.
