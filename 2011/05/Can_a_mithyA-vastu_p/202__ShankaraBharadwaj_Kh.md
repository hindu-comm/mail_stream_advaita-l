While the Visistadvaita position is internally consistent, its refutation of 
Advaita is flawed because it misstates Advaita position before setting out for 
refutation. 



For instance, Sri Ramanuja states Advaita position in his VedArtha Sangraha as 

"brahmaiva ajnam, badhyate, mucyate ca"

this is clearly not Advaitic position.
