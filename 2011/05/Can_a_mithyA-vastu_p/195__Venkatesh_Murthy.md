Yes it holds good. The mirage is true Jnana. The water is there in
light and earth. But because of defective eye and Adrushta the light
and earth are not seen. The water only is seen. This is the mirage.
Page 122. There is a Sribhashya Vakya Maricikajalajnane Api Tejaha
Prithivyorapi Ambuno Vidyamanatvat Indriyadoshena Tejaha Prithivyoho
Agrahanat Adrushtavashacca Ambunaha Grahanat Yatharthatvam. The mirage
water is real water.
