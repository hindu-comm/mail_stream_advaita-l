You mean that bAdhaka-GYAna will prove object prAtibhAsika. GYAna is
vyAvahArika. And vyAvahArika GYAna causes vyAvahArika pleasure, etc.
Now tell me whether vyAvahArika-GYAna causes it independent of object or not
?
Not the first option as we say I have pleasure of food, sweets, etc.
So, second comes. If GYAna is not able to cause pleasure,etc. without its
object ; then it comes that object caused that. So, mithyA can produce
effect.
