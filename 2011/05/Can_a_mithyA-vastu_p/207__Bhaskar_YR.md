Actually this "brahman 'thinks' due to ignorance" is what advaita-critics 
really 
complain about.

praNAms
Hare Krishna

brahman thinks,  brahman walks, brahman does this, brahman does that, 
statements like this are there in shankara vedAnta just to drive home that 
point that there is no 'other' (second) chaitanya apart from brahman.  In 
this sense we can say avidyA is brahmAshraya.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
