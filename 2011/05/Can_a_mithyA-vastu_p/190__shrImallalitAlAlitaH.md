But why did veda prescribe it ?
Because  everything is everything due to trivR^itkaraNam.

Defective eyes reveal silver in shell because it is there.
Both are true. see evidence :
Everything is in everything because of trivR^itkaraNam. and trivR^itkaraNam
is proved by shruti.
defect of eye is necessary because silver residing in shell is not revealed
by common eyes. so, it is proved by anyathAnupapatti.
