"इदं शरीरस्थं यद्गृह्यतेऽग्रे प्राक्प्रतिबोधादपि ब्रह्मैव आसीत्सर्वं    चेदम् । 
किन्तु अप्रतिबोधात् अब्रह्म अस्म्यसर्वं च इत्यात्मन्यध्यारोपात्कर्ताऽहं    
क्रियावान्फलानाञ्च भोक्ता सुखी दुःखी संसारी इति च अध्यारोपयति"


Actually this "brahman 'thinks' due to ignorance" is what advaita-critics really 
complain about. This is also why they acknowledge a second principle which is 
the abode of ignorance, to "relieve brahman from that defect". I think it needs 
a little more explaining on this, because  when we say everything is Brahman, 
the "it" is a little confusing. 


"Non-advaitins think that Advaita holds that there is a real transformation of 
Brahman as jiva."

Because they are essentially pariNAma vAdin-s. That the world is brahma vaivarta 
and not brahma janita, is not merely an alternate explanation but introduces 
another frame of reality.
