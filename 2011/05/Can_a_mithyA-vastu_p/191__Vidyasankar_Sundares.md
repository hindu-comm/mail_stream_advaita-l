"Everything is in everything" is an absolutely wrong interpretation of the Sruti
that teaches trivRtkaraNa. 

What trivRtkaraNa teaches is that every object has components of tejas, ap
and pRthvi in its make-up. It only means that tejas, ap and pRthvi are in this
thing, that thing and the other thing, therefore tejas, ap and pRthvi are in
everything. It further indicates that because tejas, ap and pRthvi are taught
as having arisen from that ekaM sat, knowledge of everything (savarjnatA)
consists in knowing that one ultimate reality. tasmin ekasmin sati vijnAte
sarvam idaM vijnAtaM bhavati iti sUktaM - so concludes this section of the
chAndogya bhAshya by Sankara bhagavatpAda.

The Sruti teaching of trivRtkaraNa does not say that gold has "large quantity"
of gold and "small quantities" of silver, platinum, mud, lead, you, me, another
reader of this list, our departed ancestors, yet-to-be-born descendents and
all other things that are NOT gold. 

I would hope that on a list such as this one, list members would take the
time and effort to appreciate and try to emulate at least some of the many
subtleties in the stances taken by various Indian darSana-s, whether Astika
or nAstika.
