Being less in quantity doe not causes its extraction impossible. You must
extract that 'very small' quantity.
Moreover, if defective eyes see correctly, means silver, then they must see
correct quantity too. How is it that they see whole thing as silver and even
then are pramANa ?

Leave mud. Extract from shell. That will be easier for you.

These are words of a man blind with faith and lacking pramANas. Even those
rules of physics are shown in work at places. So, you can't compare with
them.

If shruti tells about a pAralaukika thing, then I accept it. But existence
of silver in shell is not like that. So, shruti must be tested. Even
hundreds of shrutis can't make or prove a pot a cloth.

Sorry, it is yet to be proved.
