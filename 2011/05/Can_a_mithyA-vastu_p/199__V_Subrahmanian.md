There can't be a greater proof for the fact that the dream is the jiva's
imagination than the test: upon waking if the 'other' members of the dream
are consulted for testifying the dream event, none would.

Advaita is not against the vasana theory.  Gaudapada has proved the falsity
of dream objects thru several yuktis. Being bound in samsara is a boon for
creation.  The jiva, owing to avidya > kAma > karma produces enough inputs
for Ishwara to create the bhoga/bhogya vastu not just for himself but for
others also. In the recent past I have posted verses from the Bhagavatam on
the topic of dream, dream objects and their unreality.  This only
corroborates the Advaitic interpretation of the 'na tatra rathaaH' of the
Br.Up.

Here the case is one with the perverted behaviour of the man.
