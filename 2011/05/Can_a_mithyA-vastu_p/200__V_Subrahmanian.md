I think the soma-analogy should not be invoked to prove 'everything is in
everything'.  There is a requirement during apara karma for giving rajata
dAnam.  Supposing one is unable to procure silver for any reason it, would
be proper to give a certain quantity of shell as dAnam and accomplish the
rajata daanam.. In fact this alone would be the proper application of the
analogy.   That is how a mimamsa nyaya is applied.
