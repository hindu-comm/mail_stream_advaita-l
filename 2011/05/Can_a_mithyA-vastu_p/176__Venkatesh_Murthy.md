Sribhashya has said Yathartha Sarva Vijnanam Iti Vedavidam Matam
SrutiSmrutibhyaha Sarvasya Sarvatmatva Pratititaha means all Jnana in
this world is true Jnana only. There is no false Jnana because we know
from Sruti and Smruti everything contains everything. Shell will have
silver silver will have shell iron will have gold and diamonds and
platinum. Even mud will have gold silver and platinum. Why it is like
this? Chandogya Sruti has said Tasam Trivrutamekaikam we see by
Pratyaksha the Trivrutkarana of elements in combining. All things in
the world have the same basic elements.  Even our body has the same
elements like Carbon. So everything contains everything. But the
question is how much? Even mud has gold and silver but they will be
there in very small quantity. We cannot get gold and silver from mud
lying in front of our house because the quantity is very small. We may
get only some Nano grams of gold from tonnes of mud. We may spend more
than the gold value to get it from mud.

In Physics we know every action has equal and opposite reaction. If a
boy is pressing the ground and jumps up he is putting some force on
the earth.  Earth puts back same force on him makes him jump. But what
about the Earth? What happened to force the boy put on it? The Earth
moves also but the movement is very small even the best measuring
instrument will not show it. But you conclude Physics law is wrong?
There is no equal and opposite reaction. This is wrong conclusion.
Like this everything in the world contains everything but we cannot
measure it.  But the law everything contains everything is correct. It
cannot be tested always. It is coming from Chandogya Sruti.

Ato Yathartha Rupyadi Vijnanam Suktikadishu. The Jnana of Silver in
Shell is true. Page 120.
