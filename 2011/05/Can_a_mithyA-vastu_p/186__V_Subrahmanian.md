Is the defective indriya responsible ONLY to reveal the silver, that is
yathaartha rajatasadbhAvaH, in the shell but also the accurate quantity,
yathaartha rajataparimaaNa?  If it is just the former and not the latter,
then there is ayathArtha jnAna with respect to the parimANa and the theory
'all jnana is yathArtha' is contradicted.  rajatasadbhaave yaathaarthyam api
tu tatparimANAmshe ayathArthatvam.

It  would be interesting to know what is the anubhava of the one who has had
the prior rajataanubhava and the subsequent tadabhAvAnubhava.   Does he feel
'There is indeed silver in this shell but not that much as i initially
perceived'?  or is the very first anubhava is of this manner:  idam
(etat)parimANakam rajatam' (instead of 'idam rajatam' as articulated by one
who spots silver in a shell erroneously).  Does someone who gets silver
perception in a shell wait for Ramanuja's correction to base his anubhava?
  Does Ramanuja aim at proving Shankara's theory of error wrong or
everyone's experience about an erroneous experience wrong?
