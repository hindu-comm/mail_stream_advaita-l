But they both are not happening at the same time. First Jnana this is
silver happens before and second Jnana this is not silver happens at
later time. The first Jnana is not false because there was experience
of silver at earlier time. Nobody can say there was no experience
earlier. The second Jnana will say this is not silver but it cannot
negate the first experience. It is like this. A man may enjoy a woman
in dream and  has a climax.  A boy may see a tiger in a dream and wet
his bed. When he wakes up can he say I know the woman was unreal.
Nothing happened to me?  The woman was unreal and there was no real
experience? How can he say nothing happened to him and to his body?
How can the boy say I saw  unreal tiger and nothing happened to me
because I know the tiger is unreal. The silver is unreal but both
Jnanas this is silver and this is not silver are real but not at the
same time. There is no confusion.

This whole discussion has a purpose of making only real vastu cause
real effect but unreal vastu cannot cause real effect.

But you cannot call any Jnana as unreal because it has a real
experience with it.

Here the Sribhashya Page 120 has arguments for actually silver-ness in
a shell.  In Purva Mimamsa they say when Soma plant is not available
Putika sprouts can be used Somaabhave Putikagrahanam Sruticoditam
because in Putika there are parts of Soma plant in Putika
Somavayayavasadbhavaditi Nyayavido Viduhu. Like this there is silver
in shell. This is known from Sruti only.  Suktadau Rajatadesca Bhavaha
Srutyaiva Bodhitaha.  There is actual silver in shell. But it is small
part. There is large part Bhuyastva of shell.  Because of defect in
eye and so on sometimes we see only silver part in shell and not see
shell part.  But the Jnana of silver in shell is true - Page 120.

All this objection is answered like in Page 120. The silver is really
there.  Not seeing small part of silver and seeing large part of shell
but large part of silver only. This happened. When you see shell in
bright light large part of shell is saying it is shell.  The Advaiti
calls silver Mithya but the Visishtadvaiti says it is not Mithya at
all.

By now you see the big objective of the author of Sribhashya. He is
proving if Sastra can reveal real Brahman it cannot be unreal. No
Mithya Vastu can reveal a Satya Vastu. Sastra is real. Brahman is
real. But Advaiti is saying Sastra is unreal and still it reveals
Brahman. This is the mistake according to the Sribhashya.
