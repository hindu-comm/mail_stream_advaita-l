The dream woman will be true only according to Sribhashya. God only
creates all dream objects for every Jeeva according to Papa and Punya.
That Jeeva experiences the dream objects created for him.

स्वप्ने च प्राणिनां पुण्यपापानुगुणं भगवतैव तत्तत्पुरुषमात्रानुभाव्याः
तत्तत्कालावसानाः तथाभूताश्च अर्थाः सृज्यन्ते ।
He is referring  Bruhadaranyaka Sruti Na Tatra Rathaha to prove God
creates the dream things. The Jeeva cannot create them because he has
is bound in Samsara.

There is no way to prove dream objects are false.

The dream woman is real. The union of man and dream woman is real.
Recently there was one case. The wife went for divorce because husband
was doing bad things online. You cannot argue the husband was innocent
because woman on screen is Mithya and the union with her was Mithya.
Bad thinking.
