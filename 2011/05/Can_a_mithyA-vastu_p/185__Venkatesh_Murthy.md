'You don't look much like a fly or a worm. But believe it or not, you
share genes with both of themâ€”and with every other living organism.
Scientists study the genes in bacteria, fish, chimpanzees, and other
living things to learn more about humans.'

Human and fruit fly have 36% DNA common.  With Chimpanzee it is 98%
with Zebra Fish 85% with Bacteria 7% Mustard Grass  15% Round Worm
21%. It proves Ramanuja theory there is little bit of everything in
everything.

A person can see the hidden silver in shell. But he may see large
quantity instead of small. That is the error in quantity only. But
silver is there in shell. The snake is there in rope. The Man is there
in pillar.

This logic is very strange. A person may feel giddy because of some
illness. Then he will say the world is rotating. But he is correct.
The world rotates on its axis.  The normal person cannot feel world is
rotating but the giddy person feels it. Will you honour the Giddy
person as a great scientist because he can feel world rotation? Will
you employ him in a high position because he has special powers? Like
that the person seeing silver in shell is not a special person. He is
seeing silver because of a defect. He cannot have special power of
seeing silver.

There may be minute quantity of so many things in me but I cannot
detect them. What is wrong in this? Positive side is also there.
Nobody has disappointment. He can think he has all famous people like
Adi Sankara in him only.

Why? What is wrong here? How can you measure Earth's movement because
of the boy's force?  You can't. But you cannot say the Physics is
wrong because you cannot measure.

I am studying Advaita and other  philosophies. But we must have
critical approach. Otherwise our own philosophy Advaita will not be
understood.
