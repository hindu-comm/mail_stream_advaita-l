Advaita has no problem with those objections.  What we say is this:
knowledge had in one level of reality can be the cause of producing
knowledge of another level of reality.  Thus, a knowledge had in a dream,
like for example the solution to a mathematical problem (a  very common
occurrence in the life of S.Ramanujam) can remain unsublated/unfalsified,
valid, in the waking.

In the present context, the knowledge caused by the unreal inputs like the
Veda, upadesha, the body/mind in the vyavaharika can bring about the
knowledge about the pAramArthika satya that remains unsublated.

As per the Chandogya Up. mantra quoted by Shankara in the BSB, the sighting
of a woman in a dream, when the dreamer is engaged in a karma, an endeavor,
in the waking, is indicative of success in the endeavor.  This is a case of
a knowledge obtained in the unreal dream state forming the basis for
indicating/informing something pertaining to the waking state.
