Hari OM,


Simple. Because veda didn't prescribe it as an  alternative of soma.

Precisely so; its not because everything is in everything, but only because
veda says what is an alternative to soma.

Because the defect of eye is not able to reveal gold, etc.
>

Again, not because everything is in everything but the defect of the eye (as
per vishishTa advaita as I understand from the above) reveals one thing
instead of the other. It can't surely be both.


praNAm,
