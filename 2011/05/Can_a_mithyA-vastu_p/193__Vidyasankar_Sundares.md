Yes, I'm aware of what you wrote earlier, but sometimes, cryptic statements
need elaboration by one or the other person.

My point is, if some potential quality of "silver-ness" arising from the pRthvi
component of shell is responsible for an error, then the so-called "defective
eye" is actually a blessing, as it would be really a very subtle eye, capable
of seeing things that are there but not obvious to the "normal vision" people!

Seen in that light, seeing silver in a shell is not an error at all. It is a rare
window into ultimate reality. Nothing would really be an error, by logical
extension. 

And speaking of properties of kArya and kAraNa, is it really tenable to hold
that every single property of a kArya is hidden in the kAraNa?
