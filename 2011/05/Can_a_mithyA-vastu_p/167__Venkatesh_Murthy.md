The Mithyatva of Advaiti is not accepted by Visishtadvaiti. He says
the Advaiti Mithya Vastu is not Mithya. It is real. In shell there is
actually silver. But it is in small quantity.  If somebody sees silver
it is because of defective eye.  He wants to pick up the silver. But
if there is no defect in eye he will see shell part. He will not pick
up the shell.  But the Jnana of Rajata in Sukti is true Jnana. Page
