Why can't it be the other way round?

We find in the Brahmasutra bhashya of Adi shankara certain Slokas said to be from Sundara Pandya.Thus it may be surmised that Adi shankara's period may be after Sundara Pandya.

_____________________________________________________________________________
If Sundara pandya is after Adi shankara,How could the slokas be found in his bhashya,it should have been found in Sundara pandya's grantha.it is not so.hence,scholars opine that he is after sundara pandya.Moreover,many statements of Dignaga and dharmakirti are found in the shankara Bhashya.Hence he belonged to the 8 th centrury around 750 AD.
