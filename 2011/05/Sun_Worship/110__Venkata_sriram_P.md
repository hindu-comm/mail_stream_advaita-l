Dear Ramakrishna,

The concept of surya / aditya is the basic foundation of sanAtana dharma. When time
permits, i will post a series of mails on sun worship and how it has become an
integral part of our vaidika dharma. 

Just wanted to tell you that the name "bhArata" has been derived from aditya upAsana.

The vaidika nighantu says that the word bharata is a synonym for Aditya. 
Yaska says "bharata AdityaH, tasya bhAH bhAratI".

In Rg Veda, the word "bharata" has been equated with Agni as:

// tasmAt agnirbhArataH sharma yaMsat //

// agnirgAmi bhAratO vritrahA puruchEtanaH //

// udagnE bhArata //

// bhArataH haviShO bhartA agniH //

So, bharata is aditya and its effulgence ie., bhAH is bhAratI. Also, bharata is Agni
and its effulgence is bhArati.

So, the desha (country) where peopletake delight in worshipping
Aditya / Agni is worshipped is "bhArata" and such upAsakAs are called
"bhAratIyaH". Basically, bhAratI or bhAH indicates the worship of 
savita which is the upAsya devata in Gayatri mantra and meditated
amidst solar orbit (Aditya Mandala).

namAmi vEda mAtaraM.....

regs,
Sriram
