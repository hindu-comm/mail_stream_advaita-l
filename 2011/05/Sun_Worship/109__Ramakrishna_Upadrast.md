Namaste,

[This mail should have been sent earlier, but it got delayed. My apologies.]

Shri. Pranipata Chaitanya-ji forwarded me the following articles from
"Tapovan Prasad" which I found interesting to this topic.

"Through the eyes of the Sun by Swami Chinmayanandaji and Worship of
Surya by Brni. Shruti Chaitanyaji and the cover page of January 2011
issue depicting Lord Surya at Puducherry center."

namaste
Ramakrishna
