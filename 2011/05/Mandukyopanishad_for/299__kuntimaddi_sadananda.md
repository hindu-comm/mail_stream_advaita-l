Chetanji - PraNAms

Upanishad's teaching become fruitful when one gives upor sanyaasa to the notion that I am the waker, I am the deamer, I am the deep sleeper and thereby get established in the truth that I am the turiiyam that is pointed out in the mantra 7 - naantaH prajnam ...That is the real sanyaasa - tyagenaike amRitatvamaanasuH.

After that one can live like mandUka - both in the water and on the shore without getting drowned - that is in the state of realization as well as in the world of plurality. 

Hari Om!

 In my opinion, Mandukya upanishad is not just limited to
sanyasis. I do not see that there is any proper validity of this
conclusion.
