Dear Srikantaji,
I think you are referring to MundakOpanishad and not MANDUKYA Upanishad.

If it is MundakOpanishad, in a way, this is may be according to one sampradaya.  I believe this Atharva Veda Upanishad got this name, because,  the seeking disciple who wishes to learn this truth,  needed to remain Vrath by remaining shaving his head (Mundaka:)  and on completion of the Vrata,  hee needs to approach the teacher with a Mud Pot containing coal ambers in his Head and prostrate to the Guru, expressing his desire to learn this ultimate truth.

May be he wanted to observe a bit of this sampradaya,

Hari Om

M.Babu
