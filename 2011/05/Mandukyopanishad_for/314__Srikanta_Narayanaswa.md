Dear Sirs,
    In my opinion, Mandukya upanishad is not just limited to
sanyasis. I do not see that there is any proper validity of this
conclusion. I have personally studied and keep studying this small
upanishad, which I believe encompasses all the philosophical tenets of
Advaita in a concise way. It contains only 12 verses - but the depth
is immense. All the upanishads are for the seekers of the truth - if
he is a householder or a sanyasi, it is the choice of way of life and
it has nothing to do with the seeking truth.
For me this upanishad was enlightening(not literally), especially the
commentary by Sri Sri Sri Shankaracharya and also the one by Sri swami
Chinmayananda.
regards,
Chetan

I was told by one of the trainees at the Sandeepany sadhanalaya that HH
Chinmayanandaji used to warn the aspirants to glow slow in the study of the mandukyopanishad,and some times he used to lock them up in order for them to slowly 
study and practice the mandukyopanishad.
