Dear Sriram,

I do not exactly remember but it was around how appropriate Surya Namaskara 
asana-s are along with the namaskara mantras from Aruna Patha, whether those 
mantras are associated with kriya or not according to Mimamsa principles.

Dear Sankar Bharadwaj,   Thank you for correcting me.  I overlooked that aspect 
of argument / discussions.   But may i know the point of discussion regarding 
the dharma mimamsa with respect to Surya Namaskara?    regs, sriram
