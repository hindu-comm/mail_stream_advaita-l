Sankhya is Jnana yoga and gives us the Jnana of the prakriti and purusha. But it does not talk about Brahman and it also does not resolve the issue of plurality of souls. The Vedanta takes us a step further where these issues are resolved.

Pranamas to All,

I am simple seeker to know more about Advaita.

I want to know what makes Advaita different from Sankya Yoga. And second
questions is, why Sanya Yoga along with Advaita referred as Jnana Yoga
invariably.
I am asking in regard with Bhagavad Gita interpretation of Jnana Yoga with
Sankya and sometimes of indirect interpretation of Advaita philosophy( many
times during third to 6th chapters).
Hope some learned memebers throw a light on it and help me clear my
understanding of the same of which I have less knowledge of.

Thank You All,

Harihi Om!
Shriharsha
