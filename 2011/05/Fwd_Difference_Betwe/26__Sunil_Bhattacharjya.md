Sankhya does not disbelieve in an Ishvara (God) either. Sankhya says that Ishvara is asiddha, ie. the existence of Ishvara cannot be proved.

Namaste,

Both sAnkhya and Sankara Advaita include jnAna mArga. Here are the most
important differences 

 - sAnkhya is pariNAma vAda and advaita is vivarta vAda
 - The multiplicity of phenomenal world is explained by sAnkhya in terms of
multiplicity of Purusha. Advaita limits the multiplicity to phenomenal world
