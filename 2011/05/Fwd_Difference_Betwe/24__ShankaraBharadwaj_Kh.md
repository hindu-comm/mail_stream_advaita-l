Namaste,

Both sAnkhya and Sankara Advaita include jnAna mArga. Here are the most 
important differences 

 - sAnkhya is pariNAma vAda and advaita is vivarta vAda 
 - The multiplicity of phenomenal world is explained by sAnkhya in terms of 
multiplicity of Purusha. Advaita limits the multiplicity to phenomenal world
