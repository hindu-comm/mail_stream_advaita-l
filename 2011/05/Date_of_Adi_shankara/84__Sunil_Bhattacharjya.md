Dignaga was in the 8th century BCE and Dharmakirti was in 6th century BCE. Dr. Narahari Achar's astronomical dating of Lord Buddha in the 19th century BCE clears such doubts.

The majority of the scholars and historians confirm that A di shankara's period is 750-800.AD.he lived after Dignaga and Dharmakirti and possibly after Kumarila Bhatta.the quotations from theirbooks amply confirm this.
