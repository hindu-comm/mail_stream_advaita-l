We generally don't say complete sankalpa in the pancaayatana puja
either. But when I checked the Sringeri book on the panchayatana puja,
the complete sankalpa was given. I have noticed that the complete
sankalpa is not said in the nitya karmas, but in the naimittika (e.g.,
shivaraatri) or the kaamya karmas the complete sankalpa is used.
