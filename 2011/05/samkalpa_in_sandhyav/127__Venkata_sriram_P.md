Dear Jaladharji,

////
Which is roughly what I would expect. But my question is specifically 
about sandhyavandana. Do you use the same samkalpa then?

//

Anykarma without sankalpa sans desa / kala sankirtana is a dosha because desa & kala niyamas decide the day'sPanchanga (tithi, vara, nakshatra, yoga, karana). Moreover, desa & kala decide the locus / position of the upAsaka at the time of performance of karmAnuShTAna. 

After sankalpa, udaka is touched which acts as a medium between the upAsaka and karmaphala pradAta. The udaka indicates karma phala bIjA that has the potential of bestowing karma phala because shruti says "Apo vai nArAyanaH". Udaka is the symbolic representation of sankalpa bala and hence our ancient sages used to take water and sprinkle while giving the shApa / anugraha. 

Now, as regards the sankalpa paddhati,we andhraites follow 3 types of Sankalpas:
1) Mahasankalpa 2) Sankalpa 3) Laghu Sankalpa

1) Mahasankalpa is chanted at the time of Kanyadana during marriage

2) Sankalpa with desa, kala & panchanga is chanted before nitya/naimittika karmas

3) Laghu Sankalpa is chanted before commencement ofavAntara karma / commencement of karmAnga for instance arghya, tarpana, gayatri mantra japa etc. with the performance of srauta achamana. 

regs,
Sriram
