Recently on another list a discussion came up about the samkalpa that is 
said before pujas.  It was mentioned that in Tamil Nadu the practice is 
not to mention desha and kala during samkalpa or even omit it altogether. 
By contrast they are included in the usage of most other parts of the 
country.  Which doesn't necessarily make the TN practice wrong, just 
different hence my curiosity.  Can anyone comment?
