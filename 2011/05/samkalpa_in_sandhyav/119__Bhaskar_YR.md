Thankyou.  Any theories on why this so?

praNAms
Hare Krishna 

Donot know the exact reason..but I can say, it is the practice prevalent 
in our saMpradAya.  But in pUja vishesha saMkalpa, we do religiously say 
'saMpUrNa saMkalpa' with exact vAra, tithi, nakshatra, yOga & karaNa..and 
each & every details of pUja, hOma.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
