Which is roughly what I would expect.  But my question is specifically 
about sandhyavandana.  Do you use the same samkalpa then?

praNAms
Hare Krishna

No, here in our circle, we dont say complete saMkalpa in 
saNdhyAvandana...we just say : mama upAtta samasta duritakshayadvAra sri 
parameshwara preetyartham prAtaH/mAdhyAnhika/sAyaM sandhya upAsate...thats 
it...but in vishesha pooja, hOma etc. we do say complete saMkalpa.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
