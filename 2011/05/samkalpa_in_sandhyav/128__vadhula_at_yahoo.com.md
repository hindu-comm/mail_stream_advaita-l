Dear Jaldhar and all,

I am a Sankethi Braahmana. Sankethis are Vadama Iyer Smaartha Braahamanas from TN who migrated to Karnataka few hundred years ago.

I belong to Krishna Yajur Shakha (prob Taitreya). We don't recite complete sankalpa for sandhya-vandana but for puja we do. But I have seen books that describe full sankalpa before SV.

Recently on another list a discussion came up about the samkalpa that is said before pujas.  It was mentioned that in Tamil Nadu the practice is not to mention desha and kala during samkalpa or even omit it altogether. By contrast they are included in the usage of most other parts of the country.  Which doesn't necessarily make the TN practice wrong, just different hence my curiosity.  Can anyone comment?
