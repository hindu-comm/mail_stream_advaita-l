Namaste Jaldhar Ji,
for Sandhyavandana we do achamana followed by Shuklambaradharam then
Prananayamya followed by the Sankalpa
Mamopatta samasta durikshayadvara shree parameshwara preetyartham
Pratah/madhyahnikam/ sayam/ sandhyam karishye

thats it..

Sri Maha Sannidhanam Sri Abhinava Vidyatheertha Swamigal in his
Sandhyavandam commentary also  writes same  Sandhyavandam Kannada commentary
which was translated into Tamil.

The beauty of Sandhyavandam is it starts with Parameshwara Preetyartham and
ends with Narayayana Eti Samarpayayami showing Harihara abhinnam

Thanks and Regards,
Sriram
