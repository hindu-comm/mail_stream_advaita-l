In BG 7.17, the lord defines a jnani as nitya yukta eka bhakti (always
engaged or steadfast in one pointed devotion). Explaining this bhakti,
Sankara says the jnani "adores" and  Madhusudana says the jnani "loves"
Vasudeva. Is this bhakti with respect to saguna brahman or nirguna brahman
or both? Are there other definitions of jnani in advaita tradition.
