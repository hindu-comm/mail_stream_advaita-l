It is always "pada-s" (word) and NOT "paada-s" (quarter-of-a-verse.)
The words are to be pronounced exactly as done in the pada-paatha (in case
of a group of words, the last one will have the exact form as in
padapaatha.) The swara also has certain rules when a sandhi is broken.

When a praSna (a chapter, with the mantra-s grouped as anuvaaka-s; for
example, KY vEda taittirIya samhita first kaanDa has 8 praSna-s) is
initiated, groups of pada-s are recited by the guru with proper breaks
(following correct grammar rules for sandhi break and swara break.) After
10-12 such sessions the student will be able to recite the mantra-s with
supervision from the guru, each group of 50 pada-s. Every such group of 50
pada-s, is chanted 10 times under supervision by the guru. After 10-12 such
sessions, he will be able to memorize the entire pancaaSat groupings
correctly, as also the sequence for the entire praSna. The re-joining of
'phrases' broken for ease of recitation happens almost effortlessly. In case
of any doubts, the teacher helps.

In braahmaNam, instead of 50 pada-s, it will be 10 vaakya-s
(phrase/sentence.) In the case of last grouping of the anuvaaka, the count
of words may be sometimes less than 50, sometimes more.
