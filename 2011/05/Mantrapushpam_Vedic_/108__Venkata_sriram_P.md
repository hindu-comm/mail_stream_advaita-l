Namaste Dear Larios,

////

technically called "pañcāśat" (Skt for 50), but instead of "words", my
informants say it refers to 50 pādas (quarter of a verse) and not to words.
We must remember that in the saṁhitā text the words are joined by sandhi, so
that it becomes difficult for the pupil to count the individual
words.

First of all, please accept my humble pranams because your profile is quite interesting for me. Being a westerner, you have such a good interest towards veda and its anuvAka paddhati.

As regards the panchAshat paddhati, it is not followed in Rg Veda but only in Yajur Veda.

If you want i can introduce you to a great rg vedic scholar who is a maharashtrian. 

His name is Brahmasri Narendra Kapre Ji who happens to be my Rg Vedic Teacher. 

I can give you guruji's no. offline to protect the privacy. 

regs,
Sriram
