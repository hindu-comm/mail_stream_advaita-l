The yajur veda does not have padas, being prose. pa~ncaashat is
actually 50 syllables. When teaching, the pa~caashat divisions are not
followed. Neither are they followed during recitations. They are
present to as en "error control" mechanism. The traditional grantha
texts break the svara at the end of each pa~ncaashat, but during
recitation it is continuous and the svara changes because of that.

The other thing is there are various levels of pratiika mantras. I
believe this is the case in the braahmaNa and the aaraNyaka. Here the
beginning and and end of each chapter are usually recited pratikena,
there are also various levels of pratiikena mantras at the end of each
anuvaaka. There are other types of useful mnemonic aids, especially in
some chapters like the kaaThakam. I have learned only very miniscule
parts of the samhitaa. I don't remember it having these mnemonic aids.
These are called "kovai" by Tamil speaking vedic reciters. Remember,
the samhitaa has something much better, pada and krama texts. I'll
check with my printed samhitaa later today and let you know.
