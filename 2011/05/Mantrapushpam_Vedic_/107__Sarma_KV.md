Sri Vidyasankar,

Many thanks for explaining questions put to me also. Somehow I was not able
to check my email for the past few days.

Dear Sri Maitreya, you quoted a portion of my mail as below:
===*
It is always "pada-s" (word) and NOT "paada-s" (quarter-of-a-verse.)
> The words are to be pronounced exactly as done in the pada-paatha (in case
> of a group of words, the last one will have the exact form as in
> padapaatha.) The swara also has certain rules when a sandhi is broken.
>

This would imply that the student has learned fist the padapāṭha before the
Saṁhitā recitation. Which is usually not the case (at least in Maharashtra).
One must also bear in mind that (as far as I know) there is no padapāṭha for
Brāhmaṇa or Āraṇyaka, but only for the Saṁhitā text.
===*

My answer is: What I said is, as Sri Vidyasankar explained, for ease of
listening and repeating the mantra-s, they are broken into small "phrases"
and uttered by the guru. The student then repeats twice the phrase uttered
by the guru. The pada at end of the phrase will get the padapaaTha rules
applied to it. Rest of the pada-s are as in samhitaa paaTha only.
So, the student would only get a glimpse of padapaaTha (without actually
knowing that it is so) but doesn't not learn padapaaTha.
