Sunil, it is impossible to take your extravagent claims as to what the 
Buddha supposedly did seriously when you flub basic concepts.  Naimittika 
karma _is_ ordained.  Shradda is a naimittika karma.  So "Buddha did not 
want the naimittika rituals to come in the way of Dharma but he did 
perform rituals, which are ordained." is nonsense.
