When anyone says anything against our view (advaita), we never do so.

Then you must find some way to make us understand. This is your problem and
you must solve it to be effective.

We refute even opponents and propound our view. We do not expect every one
to be our shiShya.

I already said there that your every pramANa is just a story in similar way.

What do you want to prove by it ?
Every darshana is there in shrI-chakra and devI has taken form of every

vaidika too in your way of thinking because they are also there and are also
a form of devI.
