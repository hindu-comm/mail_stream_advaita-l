What you said is reasonable. But I would like to add that one cannot expect to 
transfer all the 

base research that is done to arrive at some conclusions, by a couple of 
postings in a forum.

This can be done if the other person, has some reasonable knowledge on the 
subject or atleast is willing to know/learn...but otherwise it is very time 
taking for the other person. This becomes especially hard when the candidate has 
an attitude where she/he takes everything including stories(however nonsensical 
or fanciful they may be)in their tradition as being true and tries to use 
thosestoriesas some sort of pramANa to invalidate a similar story in another 
tradition.. It islike disproving obscurum per obscurius.

This is also one of reasons, I did not continue with you further on the other 
thread related to similar topic.

I will not say more except for the following:

..bauddha darshana rUpA cha mahAtripura sundarI -from the bAlA tripura sundarI 
sahasranAma

Likewise think about the the clear invoking of buddha in lalitA mahAtripura 
sundarI trailokyamohana kavacha - These are there for a reason... it is 
betterknown through one's own study than being spoonfed on this.
