You can go there again and enquire.

None.
Lord Buddha stopped doing the Naimittika karma

Evidences which I asked and list to books to be read please.

First means first. Don't try to make first the second. First you have to read up on that . Go to a library or a good bookshop nearest to you and you may get some books there and at least you can make a beginning and from that itself you will know what other books to read. You may try the Internet also on the details of the book available on Lord Buddha,. Motilal Banarsidass also has many books on that subject.

I already said that treat me as a person opposed to or testing validity of
your view. I'm just that for you.

I am not overly interested in knowing about you. I think you could have given that much information as was released while introducing you to the group. If you want some people like me not to know about you at all, it is okay for me and I shall try to remember that.

Are you claiming ? Wow.. a sign of sarvaGYtvam !!!
Common sense. You did not know that Lord Ram and MotherSita stayed in Nasik and there is the Ramkund in Godavari where Lord Ram gave Pinda.
