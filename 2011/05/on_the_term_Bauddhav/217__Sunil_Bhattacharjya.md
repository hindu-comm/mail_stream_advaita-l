1)
Now I understand that you went to Gaya but did not hear about the tradition that Lord Buddha was the first person to offer Pinda there.
2)
Do you know which of the two (ie. the Nitya and the Naimittika karma) includes Kamya-karma?
3)
You said "I'll try to not blame buddha if you are ready to provide proof." You have to read up about Lord Buddha and his philosophy first before entering into discussions on that. Of course if you want to blame Lord Buddha without knowing about him and his philosophy who can prevent you?
4)
Once before I requested you to give your introduction and you shied away. If you are shy to give in public you may send that to me by private mail. You might have given that in the group before I joined the group.
5)
You have never visited Ramkund where Lord ram offered Pinda.

Yes. I went there.

No. I've not.

1. What do they say about buddha's shrAddha ?
2. How could you believe those which are written by later-bauddhas ?
3. If you believe them, then why don't you have faith in their texts
refuting veda and it's followers ?


 No Lord Buddha was not confused at all.

OK. So, he didn't want people to do kAmya-karma.
Did he expected this from all people or from those who are desirous of
mokSha ?
If first, then it was in vain. Not all people lack desire of world.
If second, he must have said that clearly. Atleast, our Veda and AchAryas do
that.

 He wanted one to perform only those rituals where no self-interst is

So, he was not opposed to nitya and naimittika karma. How could you say that
? A person who denies authority of a shAstram in a portion is actually
denying it in whole. remember 'ardhajaratI-nyAya'.
Another thing, you said in previous post that he didn't want
naimittika-karma to come in way of dharma. Now you are saying that he was
not opposed to that. Do you know definitions of karma ? Or, are you saying
anything which suits you ?
naimittika-karma is also dharma. So, what do you mean by saying 'come in
way' ?

If my language did not convey that then you can attribute it to my lack of

I think you've never visited gayA and asked people there about this.
