Had you been to Gaya? Had you read the Buddhist suttas?

No Lord Buddha was not confused at all. Lord Buddha did not want one to go on accumulating karmaphal by doing work for one's own self-interest. He wanted one to perform only those rituals where no self-interst is involved. If my language did not convey that then you can attribute it to my lack of linguistic profficiency but please do not cast aspersion on Lord Buddha.

I have not heard that Lord Ram and Mother Sita want any time to Gaya to perform Shraddha. To my knowledge they gave Pinda only at Ramkund in Nasik.

In which tradition ?
At least we heard that rAma and sItA went gayA for piNDadAnam. And they went
because dharma-shAstra says so and their ancestors did same. So, buddhA was
not 'first'.
If bauddha-tradition tells such things, then .. !!!???

So, he was confused !!!
