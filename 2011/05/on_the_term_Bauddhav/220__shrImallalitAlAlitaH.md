OK. Sir, I'll do as you said.
But a person well versed in things related to buddha is expected to propound
any theory in a manner that others can understand and check its validity.
Whenever we talked, you always skipped to reply my objections and told me to
read. I'll do that. But, this is not what we expect from a learned person.
At least, we at group deserve to know the basis of your theory. We are
always taught : लक्षणप्रमाणाभ्यां वस्तुसिद्धिर्न प्रतिज्ञामात्रेण .  So, I
asked about pramANa always after you did pratiGYA.
Anyhow, you are not providing any solution or evidence and study is last
remedy and that is personal. So, I'll refrain from replying your posts from
now.
