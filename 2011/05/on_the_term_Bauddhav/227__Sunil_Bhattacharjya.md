Dear friends,

Among the ten Mahavidyas the four Mahavidyas are (1) Kali, (2) Tara, (3) Shodashi (or Tripurasundari or Kamakshi)) and (4) Bhavaneshwari.

Kali Tara Mahavidya Shodashi Bhuvaneshwari 

Regards,

Sunil KB

Dear Satish,

//////
..bauddha darshana rUpA cha mahAtripura sundarI -from the bAlA tripura sundarI 
sahasranAma 

////

The name "bauddha darshana rupa" in Bala Sahasranama refers to Goddess Tara who is worshipped in Tantric Buddhism. 

////

Likewise think about the the clear invoking of buddha in lalitA mahAtripura 
sundarI trailokyamohana kavacha -

//

Bauddhas have adopted our tantric concepts and made an amalgamation so much so that one gets the benefit of doubt whether hindu tantric ritualists adopted bauddha tantra or vice versa. 

The srichakra navavarana archana in Gandharva Tantra do mention and invoke the Buddha at prathama avarana near Bhupura. The mantra used to invoke is "buM buddhAya namaH". But needless to mention that bauddha tantrics worshipped Vajra Tara, Manjushri, Vajra Sarada etc. and Jaina tantrics worshipped Padmakshi. 

I have seen a wonderful image ofPadmakshi in Warangal district of Andhra Pradesh at a village called Kolanupaka which is also famous for an ancient vira saiva pitha and birth place of virasaiva saint Renukacharya.

regs,
sriram
