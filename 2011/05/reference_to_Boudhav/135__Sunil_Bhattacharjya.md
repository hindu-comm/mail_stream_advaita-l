It is not true that Lord Buddha banned all Vedic rituals. He advised Bimbisara to continue the Yajna without animal sacrifice.

Is not Lord Buddha an avatara in the Kali yuga? He gave the moral code to the Nastikas and and he also gave metaphysical truths from the Sankhya and beyond (Sankhya) to the elevated jijnashus. He was not permitted to teach jnana like a brahmin does yet he demolished the concept of Sankhya's plurality of the souls in an unconventional way. He went beyond the individual identity (through the five koshas) and talked about the Tathagatagarbha, the all-encompassing-awareness or the Dharmabody. Thanks to Adi Sankaracharya that we the advaitins can understand Lord Buddha's frustration with the concept of the plurality of the souls.

with reference to the above,it is not clear why the word Boudhavatara is introduced in the sankalpa.Given that Buddha was a jnani,why the name of Boudhavatara was introduced in a ritual which is purely in karmakhanda.I think this reference is derogatorily introduced by the mimamsakas,I donot know when.But,in some parts of the country this reference is not there.I think this means that since Buddha was responsible for banishing all Yagas and yajnas,in the Bouddhavatara in kaliyuga,this pertains to evil which are due to the non-performance of all yajnas.
