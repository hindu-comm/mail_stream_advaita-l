I don't know why Advaita-L keeps getting on the topic of the Buddha but it 
is not necessary to have any views on him pro or con to understand the 
reference in the samkalpa.  Bauddhavatare simply means that the 
(relatively) most recent of the 10 major avataras was Buddha as 
Venkateshmurthy pointed out.

Given that the actual injunction in dharmashastras is only deshakalau 
samkirtya ("recite the place and time"), the actual form of the samkalpa 
varies quite a bit by region, jati and sampradaya but bauddhavatare is 
fairly common across Bharata.  I really doubt the Mimamsakas would have 
inserted it given that they themselves were implacable foes of Buddhism 
and other types of nastikata.
