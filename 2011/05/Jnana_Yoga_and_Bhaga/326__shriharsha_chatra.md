Dear Learned Member,

First and foremost I want to let you know that I am a novice when it comes
the interpreting Bhagavad Gita, so I am here to clarify one of those
doubts.

Whenever lord Krishna refer to Jnana Yoga and Jnani does lord refer
interpret as  Advaitic principle, or in other worlds Jnana in Bhagavad Gita
can be termed as Atma Jnana.

Thank You,

Harsha Chatra
