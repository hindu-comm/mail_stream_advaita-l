As far as I know, there is none. There is original sanskrit available
at jayalakshmi store (?) opposite madras sanskrit college. His
language is simple and straight forward. If you know some sanskrit
scholar learned in advaita and vaishnava vedanta schools, I would like
to set up a fund to translate it. If there is already one, Ill be
interested to get it.
