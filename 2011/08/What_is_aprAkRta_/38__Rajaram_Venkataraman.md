RV: As Madhusudana pointed out His body is not material and He instructed
Vivasvan long ago with the SAME body. For Devaki, He manifested a child
form, for Gopis the Youth form, for Krishna and Vivasvan a Teacher form etc.
at different times. As Madhusudana pointed Maya makes the impossible
possible.

RV: Yes - the scriptural position has been well stated long ago by
Madhusudana and long long ago by Sridhara, Anandagiri and Sankara. It needs
no re-interpretation in twenty first century especially without supporting
evidence.

RV: You can pray to any form you like even manjal pillayar (turmeric
ganapathi) and para Vasudeva will be the benefactor through that form. The
point will remain that Krishna's form being para mayika is eternal and
exists as long as time exists. A jivan mukta's body is created using
material elements due to prarabda karma. It does not exist after videha
mukti. Having said that in BS 3.3.32, Sankara talks about adhikara purusha
who continues to remain after death and gives the example of Vyasa, Narada
and Sanatkumara.
