One logical flaw I can point out in the above is that if by 'Lord' we mean
Satchitanandaghana, Brahman, then it cannot be/have a body.  Everyone was
witness to the baby krishna growing up to an adult and an aged one.  Brahman
has no vikAra-s.  The body has.  Only that which is in some way or the other
connected with prakriti can have modifications of whatever type.
