'mAyA-shabalitam Brahma' for the word
the 'Lord'.  This is in perfect synchronization with the Mandukya 6th mantra
on Ishwara and the bhashya.
Since such a Brahman, in association with maya, is called Ishwara, his
'body' that we referred to earlier and
the 'body' as an avatara are definitely inseparable from maya/prakrti.  That
is what is meant by 'My own maya' which
Shankara has explained very well.  That explains the statement 'The Lord and
His body are non-different' (both being maayic). There is no ambiguity here.
 He 'comes into being' 'sambhavAmi' by controlling His maya/prakriti.
'ajAyamAno bahudhA vijAyate' says the purusha suktam.  The birthless one
takes birth in so many ways/forms. All this will be impossible
unless maya/prakriti is brought in in some form or the other.  That is the
final word in Advaita on this matter.

It is quite well known through the sources such as the Mahabharata that
Krishna was over 120 years old at the
time of the avatara-ending.  Yudhishtira was a little older than Him.
 Arjuna was younger and so on.  There was certainly a modification
in His bodily appearance.  He no longer could be carried by Devaki and
cuddled by Nandagopa.  He had married and given birth to sons and grand
sons.  All these are pointers to vikara.

I think we are not adding anything new to this discussion.  The scriptural
position has been well stated long ago and needs no reiteration.

It would be incorrect to say that.  Just like the Ishwara's avatara has a
beginning and end on the physical plane and yet the devotee several
centuries later too can pray and be blessed by that avatara, a jivanmukta
too can be prayed to and his blessings and guidance got by devotees  long
after his physical death.
