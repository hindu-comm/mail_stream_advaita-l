namaste,

Vishwamitra was indeed a historical figure. He lived in the 74th century BCE as found out by Dr. Vartak from precessional data. The Rishis are named as they were the persons through whom the revelation of the eternal truths occurred. In other words they discovered the truths and not invente them. They deserve credit for their discovery and not for inventing something eternal..

Regards,

Sunil K. Bhattaharjya

namaste srikanta ji
can you please inform us of the source of this particular question and
answer quoted by you?
in another thread, shyam ji and subrahmanian ji said something related to
this question.

"v)Objection:The "Ruks"of the veda have the names of the "Rishis".The
"Rishis"are also mortals ,therefore the "Ruks"created by them are
non-eternal!
Answer:The "Ruks"are not created by the "Rishis".They are the
visioneries(drastarah).They are not mere names(nama),they are universal
nouns(sarvanama).Vishwamitra is not a historical figure.Vishwamitra means -a
friend of all.Since the universal nouns(sarvanama)have no adjuncts(upadhi)of
time(kala),place(desha) and count(ganna),they are eternal!."

thank you
raghav
