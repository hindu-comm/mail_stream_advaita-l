Vishwamitra was indeed a historical figure. He lived in the 74th century BCE as found out by Dr. Vartak from precessional data. The Rishis are named as they were the persons through whom the revelation of the eternal truths occurred. In other words they discovered the truths and not invente them. They deserve credit for their discovery and not for inventing something eternal..

It is not possible to say by research who was Vishwamitra and when he lived?Is he later than Buddha and Mahavira?It is well known that Gayatri mantra was revealed by Vishwamitra.Moreover,there may be many Vishwamitras. The Vedas are not revelations.They are the visions.The mantras are eternal.There is a lot of difference between a vision and a revelation.Revelation is from secondary source.Vision is original.It is said that Newton fomulated gravitational laws and said by seeing a falling apple that,there is a "gravitational force".But,that doesnot prove that it was Newton who first saw a falling apple.It is only a formulation.Similarly,one cannot say that Viswamitra discovered "Gayatri mantra".He only revealed it.or that it is eternal.
