In my previous post, I missed a not totally "As far as I remember,
Gaudapada's point is that clay and gold are not totally equivalent analogies
to understand Brahman which is pure intelligence.
__________________________________________________________________________________________
In the above illustration of clay and Gold,the karika goes as follows:
Mrlloha vispullingadaih sruthishu choditanyatha!
Upayah soavataraya nasti bhedhah kathancana!!
"In the sruthis of Chandogya(vacarambhana vikaro namadheyam) and agni vispullinga(Mundakopanishath),the llustrations are merely to teach that the "raw material"in this case 'Brahman"is same as its products,clay product pot of mud,an ornament product of Gold,are like its raw materials.That is why the illustrations are meant to understand the "upaya'of the sruthis.there is no 'Bhedha'between the products and their raw materials.Similarly there is no difference in the 'Chaitanya"or intelligence,Brahman.
