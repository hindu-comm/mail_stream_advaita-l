If you listen to Velukudi,it will be monotonous with no stuff.He doesnot have knowledge of his own Acharya.Shankara's Vishnushasranama Bhashya is the oldest and the first among other bhashyas including Parasara Bhatta Bhashya.Shankara's Bhashya contains not only word by word traslation,but also explanation of the words,and origin of those words,substantiated by Vedantic interpretation.Parasara Bhatta's bhashya is without these interpretations,it reads like a mere slokah.Uv.Velukudi's expalanation is even more insipid.I donot know why they are telecasting his monotonous rhetorics.
N.Srikanta.
