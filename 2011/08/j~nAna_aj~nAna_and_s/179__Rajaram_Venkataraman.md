 How is this possible? If Ishwara is sarvanja, He knows the underlying Self.
Then He cannot know anything else in particular because there is nothing
else to be known. If He knows everything in particular, then He cannot know
the underlying Self. But this is possible because (BSBh 2.1.14)  'He who is
called ether is the revealer of all forms and names; that within which these
forms and names are contained is Brahman'. 'He, the wise one, who having
divided all forms and given all names, sits speaking (with those names)'
(Taitt. Âr. III, 12, 7); 'He who makes the one seed manifold' (*S*ve. Up.
VI, l2). He does this through the instrumentality of Maya, which is
non-different from Him: 'Belonging to the Self, as it were, of the
omniscient Lord, there are name and form, the figments of Nescience, not to
be defined either as being (i.e. Brahman), nor as different from it, the
germs of the entire expanse of the phenomenal world, called in *S*ruti and
Sm*ri*ti the illusion (mâyâ), power (*s*aktî), or nature (prak*ri*ti) of the
omniscient Lord.'

It is not possible for some to attain the state of Vishnu but be less than
Vishnu in any respect.  As you know, this is what is said by Shankara with
respect to an aparoksha jnani in BG 15.19. sah, he; is sarva-vit,
all-knowing- he knows everything through self-identification with all-, i.e.
(he becomes) omniscient.

What is the meaning of jnapti? Has Shankara defined it anywhere?
