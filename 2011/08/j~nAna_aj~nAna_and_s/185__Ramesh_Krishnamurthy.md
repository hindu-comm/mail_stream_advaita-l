Two corrections in my previous post:

<< Attains brahmaj~nAna is not going to turn a jIva into a sarvavid.>>

The above should read:

Attaining brahmaj~nAna is not going to turn a jIva into a sarvavid, in the
sense of a knower of all specifics of vyavahAra

<<If every brahmaj~nAnI knew the method of the shAstra, there would be no
need to emphasize shrotriyatva separately.>>

The above should read:

If one insists that a brahmaj~nAnI would know all specifics of vyavahAra,
then every brahmaj~nAnI would know the method of the shAstra by default, and
there would be no need to emphasize shrotriyatva separately.
