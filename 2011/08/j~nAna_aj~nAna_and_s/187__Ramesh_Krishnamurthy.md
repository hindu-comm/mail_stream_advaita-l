Response:

Actually, all these issues have already been addressed in my previous posts.
In fact, the questions are based on deeper misunderstandings you seem to
have.

Moreover, even if you had clearly understood your own earlier statements on
sAkShI, some of these misunderstandings would not have arisen.

Anyway, if possible, please read the previous posts again. All the answers
are already there. Here is a clue. Since you talk of prArabdha, what is the
cause of prArabdha? Who is affected by prArabdha? What is a brahmaj~nAnI's
view of prArabdha? Is prArabdha mithyA or satya? If an aparokSha j~nAnI is
brahman, how can he be affected by prArabdha?

Anyone who understood the previous posts should be able to answer the above
questions, and vice-versa as well. (I am not suggesting that you should post
the responses here. That is your choice.)
