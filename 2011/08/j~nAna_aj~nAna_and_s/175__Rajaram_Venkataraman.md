RV: I am sorry but it only means that. If it is undifferentiated knowledge
or non-dual knowledge, it is called jnapti or advaya jnanam. With reference
to Isvara, when we say He is sarvajna, Sankara clearly says it is an
attribute due to maya (BSBh 2.1.14). Even before liberation, one gains
sarvajnatvam. Upon realization, one attains advaya jnanam. Madhusudana
clarifies this in his commentary to BG 6.15 with reference to smrti, which I
have quoted. "To one who has only the realization of the difference between
the intellect and the Person comes rulership over all things and knowledge
of everything. From the renunciatio of even that comes Liberation following
the destruction of the seeds of evil (P.Y.Su <http://p.y.su/>. 3.51)".
Someone has quoted sruti (Pippalada) also to substantiate this view, which I
was not aware of.

An Atmaj~nAnI is said to be sarvaj~na in the sense that he identifies
himself with the j~nAnasvarUpa AtmA and not with the limited and changing
pramAtA. However, the AtmA is akarta and does not write grantha-s. When we
talk about AchArya-s writing grantha-s we are not talking at the level of
the AtmA but at the level of the jIva.

RV: Yes. But if he is just expressing his opinion based on his knowledge of
subject, grammar and words, his ideas will have errors. And erroneous
knowledge is not beneficial and sometimes dangerous for blind followers.
Sastras are beneficial because they are the eternal truths. In the same way
an acharya's words are valuable becausethey are devoid of faults. We have
examples of faultless presentation in Sankara and Madhusudana, for example.

RV: He does not make special efforts to remove Visesha - ajnana or gain some
Visesha - jnana so that he will be recognized for solving P vs. NP problem.
But even as tamas (covering) and rajas (distortion) go and sattva
(revealing) predominates, he attains these. As Madhusudana says, he
renounces even this and attains atma-jnana in which every thing contained in
undifferentiated form.

RV: I wouldd check Sankara's commentary before forming an opinion because
there are multiple translations of shrotriya and brahma nishta. One is one
who is insightful and established in brahman. And the other is one who is
well verses in Vedas and devoted to Brahman.

RV: Yes. I am not saying that a jiva becomes a particular form of Isvara but
when he becomes Brahman, he does become Isvara, devoid of attributes. There
is nothing that is known or unknown to Him because He is the Self of all. We
cannot say that water is distinct from the ocean or the wave either.
