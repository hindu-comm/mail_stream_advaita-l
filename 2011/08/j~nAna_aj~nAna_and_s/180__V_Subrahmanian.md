The word jnaptiH is used by Shankara in the Taittiriya Upanishad in the
context of the mantra 'satyam jnAnam anantam brahma'.  Here for the word
jnanam of the mantra Shankara says: jnAnam = jnaptiH = avabodhaH.  He
distinguishes this jnaanam from any functional knowing and obtaining any
knowledge. One can read this portion in the Upanishad bhashyam for the very
first anuvAka of the AnandavallI.
