The arguments are logical but a two questions remain.


   1. In the case of diseases of the body and mind, it is due to prarabda
   karma. It is exhausted through experience though changeable through
   prayascitta karma, bhagavat bhakti etc. But visesha-ajnana is due to avidya.
   If avidya is destroyed with respect to the jiva, then what is the cause of
   visesha-ajnana in a brahma-jnani?
   2. An aparoksha jnani is identical to brahman. Brahman is neither a
   knower nor ignorant but pure knowledge itself. Given that, how can any thing
   remain known or unknown to Brahman?
