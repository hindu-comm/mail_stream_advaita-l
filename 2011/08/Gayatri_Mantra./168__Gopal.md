Dear Sri Srikanta,

I am intrigued by your explanation of Gayathri manthra, to say the least.
kIndly send me the reference to your unique interpretation of some padaa-s
of the mantra.
Also kindly explain, citing references to undo my ignorance, how you
correlate 'hridaya' with  'yoni'.  Also Sri Ramana was not referring to
anything extra (physical part or conceptual entity) in the Guha when he
pointed to Heart as the abode of Self.   Based on your unique
interpretation, I can't wait to see how you would explain 'prachodayaath'
although I am not holding my breadth.

Namaskaaraa,

-gopal
