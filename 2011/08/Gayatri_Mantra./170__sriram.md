Dear
My intervention was necessitated to set right the padha chedham for the 
words-Dhiyoyonah Prachodhayat-as some yoni was mentioned which is not 
correct.Thank you for the other references in MU/ISA.I had given the 
reference of Sri Paramarthanandha who has dealt with the whole Gayathri 
manthra as I felt that I am not very competent to deal with the full meaning 
of the great manthra,R.Krishnamoorthy.
