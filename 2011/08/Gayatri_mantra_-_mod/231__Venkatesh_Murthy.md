We have to bow to these great Bhaktas. But when the same Bhaktas talk
against Advaita we have to fight back. Because Advaita is dearer than
any one in the world. Atma is dearer than even the wife. The Upanishad
says that.  We have to reply to  Atma criticisms from anyone whoever
they are even if they are greatest Bhaktas on earth. All the Dvaita
Bhaktas are committing mistake by making Atma  small and weak and
helpless. But Atma is Brahman not anyone. Atma is God himself.
