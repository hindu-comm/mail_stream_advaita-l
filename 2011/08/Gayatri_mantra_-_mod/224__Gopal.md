Dear Administrators,

I personally know Sri Venkata Sriram and have met with/ communicate with him
even normally separated by 1000's of mails.  I am thankful to my good luck
for that.

One has to be humble not point out in public somebody else's mistake. In
that sense humility is a virtue.

But...  in a public forum/ public debate/ public discussions,  IF
self-declared 'advaitins', 'saastraakaaraa-s', 'pundits' start
misrepresenting, misinterpreting, mistreating our  sruthis and bhaasya
kaaraa-s, then it is equivalent to someone dishonering our own mothers -
because Shruti is our Mother, the Real One, who nourishes without asking
anything in return.

Sri Venkata Sriram has/had full right to word his opinion the way he stated
it because the misinterpretation was done, knowingly or unknowingly, to that
very essence of Shruthi - Gayathri mantra. She is the one who has been
protecting this sanathana dharmaa, She is the one we all "wake" up to  in
our search, She is the one who is the conduit between Athidaivika,
adhyaatmika and athibouthika in our lives... I am sure many in the list
would feel such a personal connection with Gayathri - both the manthra and
Shakti. I am really surprised that there was no outrage of larger scale to
the individual poster's efforts to do utmost dishonor to Her.

If someone -  even when being  learned/ scholarly,/with pedigree chose
repeatedly stuck to wrong translation and ill-treatment of the Mantra
WITHOUT giving any proof - then it is duty of every person to defend
Shruthi.

In Tamil Nadu and other places, laxity and
I-dont-care-what-you-say-of-vedas-I-am-blissfully-isolated-in-my-personal-spiritual-quest-attitude
has brought about destruction of the very values propounded by Shruthis. We
do not need foreign culture, races or a democratic government  to damage our
roots.   Indifference to non-sense from our 'own' people has been sufficient
to establish a 'culture of irreverence to anything vedic' as obvious in our
times.  If unchecked by passionate Dheera-s like Venkata Sriram in
correcting it in this list, then the attitude of indifference and ennui
about Shruiti will pervade in this list too.

Also, previously on a mail thread on advaita-dvaita aachaaryas, I did write
to the same poster not to indulge in mud-slinging etc. on bhaashyakaaraa-s
of any hue and flavor.   If someone wants to do service to our Shruthis and
Sanatana Dharma in these difficult times, it is enough to remain silent and
be willing to learn properly instead of calling dead and alive minority of
scholars and bhasyakaaraa-s 'stupid, arrogant, intellectually inferior'
etc.

Age, pedigree/paaramparya, material prosperity, scholarship, authority etc.
do not empower a person to insult Shrutis by continuous misinterpretation
and illogical statements.

apologies to the administrators if I have made any provocative statements.
