Namaste,

It is very disturbing to see such a rude message addressed to 
Shri Sriram who has been enlightening this list with wealth of
knowledge on various aspects of upAsanA. 

In recent months this list is seeing too much traffic with
messages that border on nuisance messages. Can moderaters
consider temporary moderation on some specific poster's messages?

Regards,
Shrinivas

Mr.sriram,let there be temperance in your speech.Doesnot matter if you state something wrongly.How doyou know my age to give me respect.I donot care for it.What do you know about "vyakarana"?It seems by the way you write, you are unfit to discuss Advaita.The confusion is within you.You accept what others say without verifying yourself.
N.Srikanta.
