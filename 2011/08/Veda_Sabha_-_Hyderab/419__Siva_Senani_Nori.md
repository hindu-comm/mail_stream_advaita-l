7th Bhagyanagar Veda Sabha
Sankar Mutt, Nallakunta, Hyderabad
4th Sept. 2011, Sunday. 8:30 am to 7:30 pm

The Nori Narasimha Sastry Charitable Trust is pleased to announce that the 7th Bhagyanagar Veda Sabha would be conducted at Sankar Mutt, Nallakunta, Hyderabad on 4th September 2011, Sunday, from 8:30 am to 7:30 pm with a 2 hour break for lunch starting from 12:30 pm. All are welcome.

The parīkṣa method is followed wherein in each round, the President and Vice-President of the sabha start reciting a panasa(roughly fifty words) from a random point in each kāṇḍa; the next pair of scholars continue from where the President and Vice-President stop; thereafter the third pair continue from where the second pair stop; and so on till all the scholars present complete chanting one panasaeach in pairs. There would be seven rounds to cover the seven kāṇḍas of the samhitā part of theKrishna Yajurveda and three rounds to cover the Brāhmaṇa, and one to cover the Āraṇyaka and Upaniṣat portions. 

Ghanapāṭhiswould recite the ghanapāṭha of the panasasin the samhita; Kramapāṭhs would only recite the mūlam (not the kramapāṭha). Scholars of other branches of Veda, if present, would recite at the beginning or end of each round from the relevant portions of the particular branch.

At the beginning, there would be puja (10 minutes or less) to the Vedamātā, and at the end Āśīrvacana (30 minutes), followed by felicitation of Vedic scholars (30 minutes) and distribution of prasādam. Lunch break is between 12:30pm and 2:30pm.
