Namaste,

“shrAvaNa” derives itself from “shravaNaM”.
Amarakosa says “shrutiH strI shravaNaM shravaH”.
So, it indicates, “shruti” ie., Vedas. 

Also, “shravaNaM” is defined as dharmAdharmAdikaM anEna
shrUyata iti shravaNaM ie., that from which the veda (shruti) in the 
form of dharma & adharma is heard is called shravaNaM. 

It is also said that Vedas descended on earth through the 
medium of nakShatra called “shravaNa” which 
was eventually propagated by guru to sishya. 

The Seers heard this vEda nAda through
shravaNa nakShatra and hence 

The Rg Veda extols this as:

“shruNvanti shrONAM amritasya gOpAM
puNyAmasyA upashruNOmi vAchaM”

During the shrAvaNa mAsa (month), the mEgha garjana (roaring of 
Clouds) is extolled as vEda-nAda. This vEda nAda is of the form of
Amrita (Nectar). Such an Ambrosia is called “gOpa”. 

This form called “gOpa” is the protective shield for the 
entire creation in the form of “chandas” 
and hence it is called “shrONa”. 

To commemorate this descend of “gOpa” on earth 
and to honour the shruti-mAta (vEda mAta), 
the upAkarma is prescribed on “shrAvaNa pournami”
which is followed by “rakSha bandhana”.

The rakShA bandhana should remind us the 
vAkya “dharmO rakShati rakShitaH”. 
If one protects the dharma in the form of
Shruti, which would inturn protect him from
Sat buddhi & sadAchAra. The importance of
rakShA bandhana is said as:

upAkarmaNi kartavyaM riShINAM chaiva pUjanaM
tatO(a)parANHnasamayE rakShA pATalikAM shubhAM
tadanu purOdhAH vaTvOscha rakShAM badhnIta mantrENa
kArayEdakShataiH shastraiH siddhArthaiH hEmabhUShitaiH

After the ceremony of Upakarma, one should worship 
Rishis. This is followed by rakShA bandhana ceremony.
Incidentally, “shrAvaNa pournami” is also celebrated
as “hayagrIva jayanti” who incarnated for
vEdOddharaNa.

Such a shruti rUpa “gOpa” is protected by
Ishwara and hence Ishwara is called “gOpaH”.
“gAM pAtIti gOpaH” is the vyutpatti. 
“gO” also denotes shruti, cows, bhUmi etc.

Such an Ishwara who is ever intent in 
protecting the shruti is called “kriShNa”.

The shruti is the form of mantra brAhmaNa &
Upanishad took the form of cows & gopalAkAs
In Brindavana dhAma. The gOpikAs (strIs)
are the form of Rg Manta bhAga.

sEShanAgO bhavEt rAmaH kriShNO brahmaiva sAshvataM
aShTAvaShTasahasrE dvE shatAdhikyaH striyastadA richO
paniShadastA vai brahmarUpA richaH striyaH.

The anantasesha took the form of Balarama;
the Paramatma took the form of Krishna;
the shruti in the form of mantras & Upanishads
took the form of gOpikA strIs. 

Having assumed the above forms, the vaikunTha
came down as Brindavana dhAma. 

The rOhiNi nakShatra is said to be dayA and
bhUdEvi is satyabhAma; sridEvi is Mother 
Rukmini; gOkula is “prajnA sthAna” &
gOsthAna is vEda mantra maNDala rUpa.

The shruti says:

vrajaM gaccha gOsthAnamityaha chandAmsi vai vrajO
gOsthAnaH chandAmsyEvAsmai vrajaM gOsthAnaM karOti

So, vraja bhUmi / brindAvana dhAma is the vEda maNDala svarUpa;
Which is the repository of mantra / brAhmaNa & upaniShad bhAga 
in the form of cows, gOpikAs & gOpabAlakAs. 

Bhagavan Krishna’s abode is vraja bhUmi who is Upanishad-pratipAdya
Tattva and protects / controls the shruti & dharma shAstrAs. 
And hence, kriShNastu bhagavAn swayaM……

kriShNaM vandE jagatguruM…..

Regs,
Sriram
