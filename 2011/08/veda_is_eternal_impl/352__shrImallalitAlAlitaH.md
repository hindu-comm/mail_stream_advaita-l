 veda-s are infinite. It leaves no room for laukika words. It is not
acceptable.
Q : Words are infinite and their are two sets of infinite words, i.e.
laukika and vaidika. So, there is no problem.
A : You can not divide infinite in two sets. As soon as you divide infinite
words in two sets, it limits both sets to limited numbers even if you can't
count them. Whenever you are asked about a vaidika-vAkya, you say that it's
definitely not a laukika-vAkya, it's a vaidika one. So, you are limiting
both sets of words.
Remember about svagata-bheda and vastu-pariccheda.

The above logic needs revision.

Don't you think that this is your problem ? Your assumption created this.

Leave it to indra. There is no rule that one must follow proportion.
Indra has to do his work and he did.
Again, this is arthavAda, a nindA-arthvAda. I think you and others saying
opposite can understand.

 This is the key question. Did Ishvara have other knowledge than Vedic

If not then he is not sarvaGYa and sarvavit.

I'll see that there.

Knowledge is not veda.
And what do you mean by word apauruSheya-knowledge ?

There is no proof and no need. If these words are from some AchArya, quote
it in full, I will reply.
