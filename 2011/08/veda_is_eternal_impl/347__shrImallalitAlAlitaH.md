Wrong interpretation. I just said that veda-s were not created after these
events.
Saying this doesn't mean that anything with same name,etc.never existed.

That's wrong.
mImAMsakas accept GYAna and mokSha, though they are not alike those of
vedanta-system.
See vedAntakalpalatikA for it @ http://bit.ly/pF7cjz

No.

'go'-shabda doesn't say a specific cow, but jAtI. So, if you say that
Ishvara created cows by saying 'go'-shabda ; I'll have no problem.

Saying 'template' you are making clear my views.

As far as I know, a pramANa is that which produces GYAnam of things which
are not subject of any other mean of knowledge. That is why mImAMsakas say
dharma is subject of veda-s. uttara-mImAMsakas add brahman as it's subject
too. No one says that their purpose is to create world. It's a new view for
me. I'll need some scriptural proof to generate faith in it.

If you say that for Ishvara veda-s are tool of creation and for us tool of
knowledge, then it will prove either veda-s of Ishvara and different.
Different, because tattvamasi is definitely not useful for creation.

Just said that, it will make veda apramANam as it's main purpose will become
to help Ishvara to remember and create things.

Not a specific cow- to be clear.
Now, from where you received this knowledge of 'gradual manifestation' ?
Supporting words from scriptures are needed.

Any proof ?
I heard it just now.
It will prove that veda-s which are revealed in different kalpas are
different.
Ishvara gave brahmA veda-s - is known to all, but he gives specific part in
specific kalpa is a new idea.
Moreover, if different veda-s(mantra-s for your clarity) are revealed in
different kalpa-s, they must create non-identical kalpa-s and each kalpa
must miss some entities, as some specific animals, etc., to be different.



> In this manner even if the
> situations are actually historical,


Cow has a jAtI and the word 'go' denotes that. So, it created cow in a
kalpa.
Now, ' janakatvam', 'magadhatva' , etc. are jAtI and are revealed and
created by word magadha and janaka, etc. :- this will be position according
to your view. No one accepts such jAtI. You will say to imagine, but we will
not. We have no genuine word from shastram for it.

I already said that if janaka, etc. are seen after creation of veda-s, and
same thing happens with them, even then it just happens by kAkatAlIya-nyAya.

Because, if in any case it doesn't happen, veda-s will be proved false and
useless for Ishvara.

Already asked source of knowledge.

If Ishvara created veda-s, then they are not eternal and apauruSheya .
He is not like pANini. So, don't compare him with pANini.

this can be seen in conjunction with the

vAchArambhaNam doesn't say that name creates objects. Ask V. Subrahmanian,
he has done more research on it.
Even if I accept that anyhow to please you, it will create problems. Now
every word, including laukika one, will become equal to veda as it helps
creating objects.

Amazing.
You are saying something which is unacceptable by all, even mImAMsakas.

Already questioned this view.
