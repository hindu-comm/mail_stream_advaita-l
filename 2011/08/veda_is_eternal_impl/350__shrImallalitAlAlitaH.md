OK. I saw. It also says:
Brahma, the Creator, alone knows the Vedas in their entirety.

Now,
We know that we are not as capable as brahma. So, brahma gave different
shAkhAs to different R^iShis. I don't have any cause to believe that he kept
some in his stock.
If you say that shAkhAs are lost now. Then it's OK. Every one starting
shabara swAmI and pata~njali accepts it.

For ' anantA vai vedAH ' :
It occurs in taittirIya-brAhmaNam as :

 *bharadvAjo ha vai tribhirAyubhirbrahmacaryamuvAsa. taM ha jIrNaM sthaviraM
shayAnamindra upavrajyovAca. bharadvAja yat te caturtha(?)mAyurdadyAM kim

sa hovAca bharadvAjetyAmantrya. vedA vA ete. anantA vai vedAH. etadvA
etaistribhirAyubhiranvavocathAH. atha ta itaradananUktameva.*

The context is to destroy shAstravAsanA and ego of bharadvAja - as
says*shrI-vidyAraNya
*. It can be done by saying that veda-s have many shAkhAs which are
impossible to study by a person. So, according to me the word vedAH means
shAkhA-s of veda-s.

Showing three mountains as three veda-s, clearly shows that veda-s are
three. Fixed in number.

You may say number of mantra-s is infinite. If one veda has infinite number,
then other will have no mantra at all.

Again showing mountains as heap of mantras clearly says that a few mantras
or shAkhA-s were studied by bharadvAja out of many-many(but not infinite)
mantras or shAkhA-s.

So, the meaning of veda is either mantra or shAkhA of veda-s and that is
very large, out of reach of study-capacity of a single man.

In jIvanmuktiviveka shrI-*vidyAraNya *doesn't make clear that what does it
mean.

I'd no access to sAyaNa-bhAShyam, so the reply delayed.
Now with grce of shri siva senani, I've found bhAShyam :
*सायणभाष्यम्*
ततः सर्ववेदाध्ययनकृतयत्नं तं भरद्वाजमुद्दिश्य सर्वाध्ययनस्याशक्यत्वं
बोधयितुमृग्यजुःसामवेदानां त्रायाणां स्वकीययोगसामर्थ्येन पर्वताकारत्वं
सम्पाद्य
So, three veda-s were shown as mountain. They were not infinite. Their names
are also given.
गिरित्रयरूपान्पूर्वमविज्ञातानेव वेदानस्मै दर्शयामास।
They were unknown to bharadvAja. It doesn't proves that they were not
revealed. At least Indra knew all. Human have limited knowledge, of one or a
few shAkhA-s. That is seen even today.
ततस्तेषां पर्वातानां मध्य एकैकस्मात्पर्वतान्मुष्टिना पांसूनाददे। आदायैवमुवाच
--  हे भहद्वाज, एते त्रयः पर्वता वेदा एव।
He says three mountains as veda-s, not infinite.
तत्रैकैकः पांसुरेको वेदः
Every particle of them was veda. It shows that he is referring mantras or
shAkhA-s as veda here.
तस्मादनन्ता वेदाः
These mantras or shAkhAs are numerous
तेषां मध्ये त्वमेतैस्त्रिभिरायुर्भिरेतन्मुष्टित्रयपरिमितं वेदजातं
गुरूपदेशमन्वधीतवान् असि।
Only one shAkhA(if one muShTi = one shAkhA) or a few shAkhA-s were studied
by bharadvAja in 300 years.
अथानन्तरं तवेतरद्वेदजातमनधीतमेव।
Rest shAkhA-s or mantra-s of veda were not studied by bharadvAja.
तस्मात्सर्वंवेदाध्ययनमशक्यमेव।

I will say this says almost same as previous.

Both of these are not clear about the word ananta.

Even if no one makes clear the meaning of word veda-s there, let us think of
it :

If vedA-s are ananta. It will make even our words veda. How ? because veda-s
are words. And if all possible words(including sentences) are veda, then
what I utter is veda too. (because anantA vai vedAH)

If you say that GYAnam is veda, then GYAnam of ghaTa, paTa, etc. will become
veda. (because anantA vai vedAH)

So, you have to accept that special set of words is veda. And that can not
be unlimited.
That's why I said that word vedAH means shAkhA-s of veda. Taking this
meaning will not contradict the context in anyway.

Just shown above.

True. No one says so. we accept that many shAkhAs are lost now.

That's a different thing. Comparing with pANini proves Ishvara
adhikatraGYAnavAn and nothing more.
Q: If Ishvara has more knowledge than veda-s then it proves that veda-s are
more.
A: Surely not. One can not say that whatever pANini knew other than
vyAkaraNam is essentially vyAkaraNam. In the same way whatever Ishvara knows
is not essentially veda.
Moreover, I saw people using veda as divine or some type of knowledge.
That's wrong.
veda-s are specific words without puruSha as origin. Knowledge is produced
by them. They themselves are not knowledge.  Remember 'apauruSheyam vAkyam
vedaH'.

Moreover,
*yadyat-vistarArtham shAstram yasmAt puruShAt sambhavati, yatha vyAkaraNadi
pANiNyAdeH jneyaikadeshArthamapi, sa tato'pi adhikataravijnAnaH kimu
vaktavyam aneka-shAkhAbhinnasya RgvedAdeH*--- this bhAShyam only says that
origin of R^ik, etc. veda-s, i.e. Ishvara, has more knowledge than revealed
in veda-s. It doesn't say that Ishvara has more veda than revealed veda-s.

 2. Regarding the example of pANiNi, in shAstra-yonitvAt bhAShya, we see

Not all knowledge which exists in Ishvara is veda.

it's OK.

I've cleared that anantA vai vedhAH and bhAShya-vacanam, both are not
showing any sign of unlimitedness of vedas.

Actually, they accepted it as abhyupagama and came near to vedAnta. Even
shloka-vArtikam has some hints about it.

Nothing different from my view is meant here, I think.
Otherwise, make clear so that I'll be able to reply.

What is the meaning of mantra-draShTA ?
If you accept mediation of RiShis, it will prove that
svAdhyAya-adhyayanam(study of veda) is not anAdI. In that case it will be
impossible to prove them apauruSheya.
Moreover, mImAMsaka-s don't accept sarvaGYas or any other people with
reveletion-type knowledge. If you accept, you will have to accept
bauddha-matam as pramANam.
