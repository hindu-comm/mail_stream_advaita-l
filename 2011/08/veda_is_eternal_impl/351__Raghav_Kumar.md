in dealing with infinite sets, we have to be a bit careful. There can be two
infinite sets which do not overlap, like "the set of even numbers" has
infinite members in it. But then there should be no non-even numbers left.
Yet there are non-even numbers called odd numbers.

If the above logic is right then we can say,
1. Laukika words are infinite. (because there are countless samAsa pada-s
possible)
2.Therefore "laukikatvam' pervades 'words"
3. Veda-mantras are words.
4. Veda-mantras are laukika words
I think you can see there is a problem in step 2.

The dRShTAnta is comaparing a fistful with a mountain. The almost-endless
mountain cannot stand for the shAkhAs. The number of shAkhas is - Yajurveda
with 101 recensions, Saamaveda with 1000 recensions, Rigveda with 21
recensions and Atharvaveda with nine recensions, that means a total of 1131
shakhas. Even if bhAradhvAja maharShi had studied say 11 shAkhas in all.
The proportion of what he studied in comparison with that he did not, is not
so large as to necessitate comparison with a tall mountain. Maybe a small
mound would have been more appropriate.

This is the key question. Did Ishvara have other knowledge than Vedic
knowledge? I am trying to understand this aspect better. In the other thread
on anantA vai vedAH, I suggested that we cannot say that
शास्त्रयोनित्वात् ....ब्रह्मण: सर्वज्ञत्वम् सिद्धम्
unless all knowledge in derivable from Vedic mantras by purusha-prayatna.
Such knowledge ofcourse become paurusheya. But thats ok. Because there is
always other knowledge derived from the Veda like karma, upAsana and
aikya-j~nAnam which remain apaurusheya always.
I am suggesting that we have to accept that pANiNi etc got their
vyAkaraNa-j~nAnam only by expansion/tapas on Vedic mantra-s, otherwise there
is हेत्वाभास in  शास्त्रयोनित्वात् sUtra. Is there any other way of
understanding

वेदे ही सर्वार्थप्रकाशनसामर्थ्यम्  ?
