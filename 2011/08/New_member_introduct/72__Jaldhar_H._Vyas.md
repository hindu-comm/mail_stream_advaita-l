Pranams respected group members. Hari Om Jai Sri Rama

I am a humble new student trying to understand the teachings of 
traditional advaita vedanta. I would especially like to understand the 
refutations or responses by advaita scholars to anya mathas especially 
visishtadvaita & dvaita sampradayas. I read some of the threads with 
interest & noted the high quality of knowledge possessed by many of you & 
would like to learn more.

I am a developmental neuropsychiatrist by profession in Australia
