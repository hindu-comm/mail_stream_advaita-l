Dear
My intervention was necessitated to set right the padha chedham 
for the words-Dhiyoyonah Prachodhayat-as some yoni was mentioned which 
is not correct.Thank you for the other references in MU/ISA.I had given 
the reference of Sri Paramarthanandha who has dealt with the whole 
Gayathri manthra as I felt that I am not very competent to deal with the
 full meaning of the great manthra,R.Krishnamoorthy.

I donot know why there is a falareup for my mentioning "yanah"in the Gayathri mantra.In Mundakopanishath there is a word"Bhuthayoni"and shankara gives the meaning of Bhuthayoni as the "Karana of bhuthas'.Refer to the Mundakopanishath.By this i have not committed any sacrilege and there is no need to be so touchy about it.Even the word "brahmayonim"is also used in the mantras and the bhashyas.In writing his Bhashyas even the Bhashyakaras donot feel delicate to write them.
N.Srikanta.
