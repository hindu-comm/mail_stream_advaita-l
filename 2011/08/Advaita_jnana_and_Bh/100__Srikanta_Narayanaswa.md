In the Brahmasutra it is clearly stated that "Ishwara has no Vaishamya or Nairgrnya".He does not have Hate or partial.
In the Bhagawadgita also it is stated":
"Na datte kasyacit paapam na chaiva suhrtam vibhuh
Ajnanenavrtam Jnanam tena muhyati(ajnanena) jantavah!!"
The delusion is by the "Jiva"himself.That means Ishwara has no likes or dislikes.
RV: He is beyond likes and dislikes but He considers His jnani-bhakta dear because of identity

In the above statement of the BG Krihna says "tesam jnani is mama priyah"because he is of his own nature,which means of the form of "Jnana".So,the word "Bhkthi"means not mere repetition,but taking his own form.That is why He says,Yah sarvidabhajathi"
