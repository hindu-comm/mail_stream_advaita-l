You are talking about the effect of arpana buddhi as definition of bhakti
and citta suddhi as its effect but let us understand the cause of arpana
buddhi as well because it will help us understand what is bhakti. We will
sacrifice something if it

a) solves a problem (give money to get medicines)
b) we have been asked to by a higher authority (pay taxes to the government)
 c) gets a better result (invest in stocks to get richer)
d) we give a gift to some one we like
 e) we understand it is not ours (return a breifcase you wrongly picked up
in the train)


a) is like offering someething to god to solve a problem. b) is like doing
all the mandatory yajnas or sacrifices because vedas say so. c) is like
doing the non-mandatory yajnas because it is beneficial to us in this life
or after-life. d) is like giving doing some work for god because we like
divinity. e) is like offering everything to god because understand that
nothing belongs to us. This is jnana.

Now, consider this. A wife has offered herself to her husband at the time of
wedding. Then she buys him a gift out of love. Now, she and the money from
which the gift were bought both belong to her husband in the first place.
They are one entity but still there is happiness in this apparent exhange.
There is no real exchange because there is only one entity. This is bhakti,
non-different from jnana. It is not different from e) because it is also
based on the understanding that it does not belong to me but it appears to
be different because love is stressed in the second case. It makes it, well
lovely. This is what Madhusudana is trying to underline in Bhaktirasayana
and Gudartha Dipika when he stresses on bhakti / jnana treating them as two
sides of the same coin. I am really surprised that a traditionalist should
attack this position.
