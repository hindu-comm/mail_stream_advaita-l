Yes, this is precisely what I am also saying. Ultimately, the AtmA alone is
priyam.

If one thinks of Shiva as Ishvara and as separate from the AtmA, then Shiva
becomes anAtmA and AtmA becomes limited. When one removes both jIvatvam and
Ishvaratvam through shodhita tvam padArtha and tat padArtha, the non-duality
of the AtmA is realized.

The distinction between vAchyArtha and lakShyArtha applies not only to tvam
pada but also to tat pada.
