Namaste,

Shankara Bhagavatpada says in Vivekachudamani as:

durlabhaM trayamEva Etat dEvAnugrahahEtukaM
manuShyatvaM mumukShatvaM mahApuruShasaMshrayaH

This sloka is in continuity of the previous one and states that
it is due to the grace of Ishwara that one gets the human birth,
desire for liberation and the company / satsanga of mahApuruShAs.

As Shri Sadaji said, instead of searching for shrOtriya & brahmaniShTa 
Gurus, one should strive to become better disciples. 
The grace of such gurus would eventually come. 

That said, sishya should also exercise his own
viveka jnana while accepting the acharyas. 

Aren’t we mature enough to see & decide the anuShTAna & sAdhana
of Acharyas like Shri Bharati Tirtha Swamigal, 
Shri Paramananda Bharati, Swami Paramarthanandaji,
Swami Tattvavidananda ji, Swami Dayananda ji on one hand
andthe rAsa lIlAs of nityananda on another hand.

Still if one is attracted towards the later one, it is his
prArabdha which should remind us the vAkya
“vinAsha kAlE vipareeta buddhiH”.

Regs,
Sriram
