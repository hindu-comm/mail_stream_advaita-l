Yes, one should not atempt to certify another person as it is not an easy thing to do. When Vishvamitra wanted a certification from Vasistha that he (Vishbamitra) attained Brahmajnana, Vasistha was unwilling to give that. Viswamitra was fed up and in fact he decided to assassinate Vasistha for not declaring him (Vishwamitra) as a Brhmajnani. and for that purpose he went to Vasistha's place. When he reached Vasistha's place he heard Arundhati pleading before Vasistha sayiung that if he did not recognise Vishvamitra the latter would kill him.Vasistha said that he loved Vishvamitra ( mind that inspite of Visvamitra killing his one hundred sons).and he is prepared to die for that. That is also the reason why he does nort want to tell Vishvamitra that he is a brahmajnani. He wants Vishvamitra to have the enjoyment of knowing it himself. Rest is history.

Te detailed story may vary but to my knowledge the above carries the idea.

Regards,

Sunil KB
