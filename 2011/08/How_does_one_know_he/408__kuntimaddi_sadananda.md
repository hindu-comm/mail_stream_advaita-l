Shree Rajaram PraNAms

It is important that disciple should consider his guru is jiivanmukta so that he has full faith in the teaching, whether the teacher is jiivamukta or not. Aright teacher is one who directs the disciple to the scriptures as authority and not the individual per sec.

As for the teacher is concerned for his self-evaluation, I discussed recetly the best litmus testsfor self-realization. In the language of Swami Paramarthanandaji it is called FIR reduction, as one firmly abides in the knowledge.

Hari Om!
Sadananda

Disciples often consider their guru to be a mukta. Sometimes, its
bvecause it makes one feel good. How does one know that he is a mukta?
