Namaste

One scholar Prof. S. K. Ramachandra Rao was from Madhwa family but he
was very learned in Advaita.  He has written books about Sringeri
Acharyas respectfully and Adhyasa Bhashya.  He was a good Madhwa.

Some Madhwas become interested in Ramakrishna and Vivekananda.  My
wife is from Madhwa family but they are moderate. After marriage she
is living like a Smarta not doing too much Madi and fasts till sunset
on Monday.  The Madi of Madhwas is very much irritating it has no
meaning.
