bhaskar :

Fortunately, Sri Subbu prabhuji is meeting all 'good' madhva-s who are 
open and ready to think in a new channel.  But for me, unfortunately, 
madhva-s whoever I met sofar, are quite stubborn and never ready to 'turn' 
their eyes  to atleast have an amicable look at advaita vedanta :-)) They 
say, "bring anything under the name of advaita, I will prove it wrong" 
:-))  And you are right in your observation that 'accepting advaita as a 
vedAntic school' is not an official memorandum in dvaita school.  OTOH, 
trend is that almost 99.99 percent of dvaita vedAntins ( who are familiar 
with shAstra grantha-s & their Acharyas' works) are in no mood to concede 
anything in favour of advaita.
