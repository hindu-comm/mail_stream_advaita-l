I would say there is a qualitative difference between "bashing" and 
criticising the basher.

This is not to say the Advaita camp are free of any taint.  By and large 
we don't engage in the blatent slander some others do, but we often engage 
in condescension which is also bad for adhyatmic progress.  For instance 
the assertion "Madhva literature have no intellectual value" is absolutely 
ridiculous even if you believe as we do that it is ultimately misguided. 
In fact the contributions of Vyas Tirth and his followers is one of the 
pinnacles of Indian thought.  Moreover by vigorously challenging Advaita 
doctrines, they forced us to reach new pinnacles.  I think a basic 
understanding of Dvaita thought and the Dvaita critique of Advaita 
Vedanta should be a required subject for any advanced sadhaka.

In the past there have been some Dvaitins who have joined this list just 
to start arguments but there have been yet others who are comfortable in 
their own beliefs but want to learn Advaita teachings to enhance their 
understanding of their own philosophy.  I applaud such people for their 
open-mindedness and think we should show them some hospitality by 
refraining from egregious attacks.
