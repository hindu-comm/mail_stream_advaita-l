As is quite natural, there are many Madhvas who do not approve of the
contents of the Mani Manjari.
They feel it is a dark chapter in their philosophy. Several Madhvas, even
scholars, harbour a reverential
attitude towards Shankara.  I have heard that a Madhva scholar remarked: I
have been discoursing
for the last over two decades on the various topics related to the Madhva
school.  I have in the past said many things
that are disrespectful to Shankara and Advaita. I have now come to an
understanding that before I could say something like that
I would think twice.
