Infact this has ben continuing from many centuries.The contents of Mani manjari is to say the least equal to Porno-yellow literature.Even though the Madhwas cannot contest with the advaitins on Brahma siddhanta,they indulge only in such types of attacks which to say the least helplesness.Several scholars have reverential attitude towards Shankara because Madhwa literature have no intellectual value.he has not written any Bhashyas worth the name,and it is said he discoursed only on "Aitareyopanishath".
