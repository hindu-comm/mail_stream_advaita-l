Namaste,

Here is what sAyaNa bhAshya says:

yaH - savitA - dEvaH ; 
naH – asmAkaM ; 
dhiyaH = karmANi / dharmAdiviShayA vA buddhiH;
prachOdayAt = prErayEt ; 
tat = tasya dEvasya savituH ; sarvAntaryAmitayA prErakasya ; 
jagatsraShTuH –paramEshwarasya ; 
varENyaM = sarvaiH upAsyatayA jnEyatayA saMbhajanIyaM;
bhargaH = svayaMjyOtiH ; parabrahmAtmakaM tEjaH ; 
dhImahi = vayaM dhyAyAmaH 

Now, I don’t have the patience to write sankara bhashya.

Niruktakara has also given an explanation to the mantra
which is inline with sAyaNa bhAshya. 

Rather than doing vitanDa vAdana, try to understand the
above explanation with peaceful mind. 

When the basic foundation itself is wrong,
there is no use in studying vyAkaraNa & Sankara Bhashyas.

If you think you are greater than yAska, sAyaNa, Sankara in terms of
sAstrAs, thenmy prostrations to you. 

Your well-wisher,

Sriram
