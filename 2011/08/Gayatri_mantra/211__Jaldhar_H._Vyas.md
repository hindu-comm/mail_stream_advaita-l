This is not an example of Sanskrit scholars "goofing up the meaning" this 
is a case of you trying to insert your crackpot theories by making excuses 
like "misinterpreting"  This is what you get when you abandon objective 
standards like vyakarana and history, random subjective and unsupportable 
pet theories of no use to anyone except their author.

Advaita-l is not a social club for people to pontificate at each other. 
Stop wasting hundreds of peoples time with this nonsense.

These are the words of someone who quite obviously has never even read a 
book on vyakarana.  I am not even going to bother telling you why you're 
wrong.  Your homework is to figure out for yourself why you are wrong. 
Do not bother responding until you understand why.

I am beginning to wonder if those who ask for more hands-on moderation are 
right.  It's sad really.
