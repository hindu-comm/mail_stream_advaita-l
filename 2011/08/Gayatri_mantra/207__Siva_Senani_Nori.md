Sir

I have elsewhere on the internet (http://www.hindupedia.com/en/Vyakarana)stated that "Great as Pāṇini was, the grammar in its final form is most likely a culmination of the efforts of generations of grammarians over a few centuries. It is equally true, contrary to general perception, that grammar evolved after Pāṇini as well, incrementally in its rules, application and interpretation of rules; and dramatically in pedagogy – method of teaching."

The tradition of grammarians is that the final rupa should not differ but that the prakriya which obtains that rupa might differ. As long as bhavati remains the present tense singular third person of bhoo dhaatu, grammarians are okay whether we use a ti~N and a vikaraNa pratyaya or achieve the same result through other means. In short, even Paninians do not hold Paninian grammar to be the only valid grammar.

Regards
N. Siva Senani

>Thank you Siva Senaniji. Yes Vyakarana is one of the six Vedangas. Do you think that during the Vedic times there might have been one or more original Vyakaranas, which were not extant during the later times of Panini and that prompted him to fill up the gap? There is no doubt that Panini did that job brilliantly.

In my opinion the Vedic Sanskrit was beyond the scope of panini, though Panini derived help from that it formulating his grammar. Now my worry is whether we should or should not apply Panini's grammar very strictly for interpreting the Gayatri mantra. I shall be grateful if the learned and experienced Sanskrit scholars in the forum throw light on this aspect.

>Panini's vyakarana is a vedanga. It is an anga because it helps to protect andunderstand Veda better and to apply that knowledge. For those who seek a pramaana for the above statement, please see the PaspaSaahnikam in the Vyaakaranamahaabhaashya written by Patanjali. It starts with the sentence "atha SabdaanuSaasanam", followed by the question (after discussing 'atha'): keshaam Sabdaanaam? The answer is given: "laukikanaam vaidikanaam ca".

>Panini cannot make any changes in Vedas retrospectively, and he did not. What is the pramaana?One's teacher and the Vedas themselves. Vedas abound innon-Paninian usages. They are expalined by the praatiSaakhyas. Both grammar and praatiSaakhyas apply toVedas, which explains why we meet with some un-Paninian usages in Vedas.

>To know the meaning of a word, we need Niruktam in addition to vyaakaranam. Gayatri mantra has been interpreted by many great people using those two and we do not need to do it afresh.
