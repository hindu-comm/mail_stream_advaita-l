It has been a longstanding tradition at the Sringeri Sarada Peetham to round off the annual
Chaturmasya with a gathering of scholars on various Sastra-s. This assembly begins on the 
day of Ganesha Chaturthi and proceeds for two weeks, till the end of the Chaturmasya
Vratam. Typically, between thirty and fifty scholars specializing in various traditional Sastras
congregate at Sringeri for this assembly. The Jagadguru Sankaracharya of Sringeri personally
chairs every day's deliberations, asks questions and leads discussions, suggests solutions to
unclear issues, etc. All discussions are conducted in Sanskrit, with very minimal use of other
Indian languages. In recent times, the discussions are also being published every year in a 
bound book form by the Sringeri Peetham.

This year's Mahaganapati Vakyartha Sadas at Sringeri begins on Sept 1, 2011, and focuses
on Vedanta, Mimamsa, Nyaya and Vyakarana. The scholars who will be attending hail from
such widely spread places as Puri in Orissa, Pune and Satara in Maharashtra, Rajahmundry
and Tirupati in Andhra, Sringeri, Bangalore and Mysore in Karnataka, Kaladi, Changanacherry
and Payyanur in Kerala and Chennai and Kanchipuram in Tamil Nadu. Vyakarana and Nyaya
issues are going to be discussed by more than ten scholars each, while Mimamsa will be
handled by five and Vedanta by ten scholars. Full details are available online at the Sringeri 
Peetham's website www.sringeri.net

The sessions are open to the public, so those of our list members who are in India might
want to plan and spend at least a day in Sringeri during this time, and absorb some of the
flavor of traditional Sanskritic and Sastric learning.
