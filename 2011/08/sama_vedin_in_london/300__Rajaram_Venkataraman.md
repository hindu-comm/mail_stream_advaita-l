Hare Krishna. Is there any sama vedin in London? I check this two weeks
before upakarma but so far have not found one. If anyone knows, please let
me know through a private mail to rajaramvenk at gmail.com Sama vedins are rare
even in Chennai and the ritual is very complicated - cannot be done by
yourself.
