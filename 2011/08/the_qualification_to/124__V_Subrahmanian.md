 Anandagiri in the gloss says at this juncture:

तर्हि श्रवणादिव्यतिरेकेणापि प्रजापतेर्ज्ञानं स्यादित्याशंक्याह -  वेदान्तेति
(this word is from the bhashya) continues Anandagiri:  न तैर्विना कस्यचिदपि
ज्ञानं स्यात्, प्रजापतेस्तु जन्मान्तरीयश्रवणवशादिदानीं अनुस्मृतवाक्यात्
तदुत्पत्तिरिति शेषः ।
It is not that Prajapati did not go thru shravaNa, etc.  It could be a case
like this:  He did shravaNa, etc. and did not get the jnanam in that birth
itself.  However, owing to his very great tapas, shraddhA, etc. he attained
an exalted loka, like Brahmaloka, and there, as his mind was rendered
extremely pure, free of obstacles (pApa), the earlier studied vedanta vAkya
became remembered, anusmRtam, owing to Ishwaranugraha.  This resulted in his
becoming enlightened.
