No offence meant whatsoever, but it seems you have a misunderstanding
regarding the meaning of the term sarvaj~na. It is surprising that you talk
about sAkShI being a prerequisite to visheSha aj~nAna without understanding
this.

Please note that sarvaj~natvam of a mukta does not mean specific knowledge
of all things in vyavahAra. It means an identification with brahman and
concomitant mithyAtva nishchaya regarding vyavahAra.

I will address this in more detail in a separate thread.
