And Bhaskarji - The truth is a path-less land is the famous quoted declaration of JK. In fact, that statement is true too; the infinite cannot have a path; is it not? - Nor a subject can be found by any means- that is also true; That is the reason why we need scriptures and a sampradaaya teacher to point out to us to see what cannot be seen or overlooked to see that isdaringly obvious and as though masked by a vail of ignorance for us to seeotherwise.

Just for a thought, before getting confused in terms of role(s) of bhakti and/or jnaana - reminds me of thesloka that ends -.... kRitvaa jnaanam swayam nasyat, jalam katakarenu vat| 

Krishna said - lokesmin dvidhaa niShTA.... where karma and jnaana are only specified - not bhakti separately, since it is the underlying principle in both. 

Just my 2cents!

Hari Om!
