The use of the word "kalpa" is in the bhAShya itself not in Shruti. The
sambandha-bhAshya (introduction) to the first verse to prashnopanishat has
the sentence -" vidyA....pippalAdivat-sarvajna-kalpair-AcAryair vaktavyA na
sA yena-kenacit iti..." (this BrahmavidyA can be expounded only by acharyas
like Pippalada  who are almost omniscient, not by anyone or everyone.) It is
part of the bhAshya itself not in the original shloka. The first shloka does
refer to Rishi PippalAda as "BhagavAn".
