What sastra did TINNAI SWAMY of Tiruvannamali study.  The one single word 
from
Bhagavan Ramana ie., SUMMA IRU transformed Tinnai swamy into a full blown 
jnani.
What sastra did Muruganar study and what sastra did Annamali Swamy 
studied.

Hare Krishna

This also reminds me the 'silent teaching' of brahmanishta guru 
dakshiNAmurthy...gurOstu mouna vyAkhyAnAm shishyAstu chinna saMshayAH...

And the question is can a mere shrotreeya guru can prepare a shrotreeya 
brahmanishTa jnAni with his mere 'shrotreeya' jnAna of shAstra-s?? if this 
is true then only brahmajnAni can impart brahma jnAna to another is a 
'myth'.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
