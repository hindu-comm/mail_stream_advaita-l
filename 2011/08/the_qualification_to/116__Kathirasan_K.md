Namaste Bhaskarji,

Pertaining to the following doubt:

<  and one more doubt here...can a person become brahmanishTa without any
knowledge of shAstra??  As per shankara, shAstra is the ONLY pramANa to
become brahmanishTa or brahmajnAni...how can a person become brahmanishTa
without the aid of antya pramANa??  or to become brahmanishTa,
shAstrAdhyayana, shravaNa, manana & nidhidhyAsana not a necessary
sAdhana??.>

Perhaps you can read Brahma Sutra Bhashya 1.3.38 where Shankara says that
the rise of jnana cannot be prevented if preparation was sufficient in
previous lives. And also Brhadaranyaka Upanishad Bhashya 1.4.2 where again
he mentions that the removal of obstacles can result in Jnana if Jnana had
not been the direct cause. Hope this helps.

Kathirasan
