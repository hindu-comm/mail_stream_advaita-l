RV: No offense taken. It is only a discussion not like the riot in London :)
Madhusudana clearly says that before liberation, on realzing the difference
between Purusha and Buddhi, one attains knowledge of every thing and
rulership over everything.  It is not his opinion because he quotes smrti.
As someone quoted even Upanishads say that Pippalada is omniscient in the
sense of knowing everything. We cannot reduce the standard of an advaita
guru. Please note that I am not saying that Brahman is sitting there
"thinking" of Mathematics, History etc. All I am saying is that all names
and forms in in Brahman as undifferentiated knowledge (jnapti). I have given
quotes for this from Sankara bhashyam and upanishad.
