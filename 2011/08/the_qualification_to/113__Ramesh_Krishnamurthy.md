Of course, but in the sense that the Atmaj~nAnI knows his svarUpa to be the
limitless brahman, which is also the svarUpa of all phenomena. In other
words, the Atmaj~AnI knows himself (as brahman) to be the self of all things
(sarvo'ham) and is, in that sense, unaffected by vyavahAra.

It does not mean that the specific jIva who is able to claim "aham
brahmAsmi" attains rulership over everything within vyavahAra or becomes
knowledgeable about everything within vyavahAra.

Come to think of it, if what you are saying is correct, then AchArya
madhusUdana should have known that we would be having this debate today!
