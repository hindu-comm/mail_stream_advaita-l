This is very important. Madhusudana says that a bhagavat-bhakta can attain
brahma-jnana by Isvaranugraha without the need for a guru or having to go
through Shravana etc! It is indeed a very radical statement. It is
interesting to see that Adi Sankara Himself gives room  for exceptions. I
would like to know if there is sruti and smrti pramana to support this view
in the tradition.
