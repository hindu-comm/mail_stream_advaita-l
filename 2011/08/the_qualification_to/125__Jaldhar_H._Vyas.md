I am reading that text and I don't think that's right.

No there is a subtle difference.  For Shankaracharya alternative means of 
perceptions are still just perception.  Just as seeing through a telescope 
is still just seeing.  The purvapakshi wants to claim them as being in a 
class by themselves.  It is the same with shabda pramana.  Viraj had a 
perfect celestial body beyond the capabilities of a human body but he used 
it in the same way a human Vedanti would have to use his.  (Incidently 
it is noteworthy that Shankaracharya quotes the Vayu Purana here.  It's 
one of the few places he refers to the Puranas.) In fact it is manana 
which is the topic of the shruti text being commented on.  sa hAyamIkShAM 
chakre yanmadanyannasti kasmAnnu bibhemIti  "He thought 'If there is 
nothing other than me, what am I afraid of?"  It is not tapas or shraddha 
etc. but jnana alone which he "sees."  In every kalpa the "see-ers" 
(Rshis) rediscover this knowledge and pass it down to us.

Actually he mentions this in the bhashya on the previous kandika.  He says 
prajApateH phalabhUtasya sR^iShTisthitisaMhAreShu jagataH 
svAtantryAdivibhUtyupavarNanena GYAnakarmaNorvaidikayoH phalotkarSho 
varNayitavya ityevamarthamArabhyate | "This [4th brahmana] is put forth to 
describe the results of Vedic knowledge and action by describing the 
powers such as independence etc. of Prajapati won by his creation, 
maintainence, and destruction of the world [in the previous kalpa-cycle.]"

[note: Prajapati is a synonym of Viraj.]

Then explaining the shruti text sa yatpUrvaH "because he was first" he 
says sa cha prajApatiratikrAntajanmAni samyakkarmaGYAnabhAvanAnuShTAnaiH

his previous life was a sadhaka who perfected the practice of action and 
knowledge and because of that perfection of action and knowledge 'was first' 
-- first amongst those who attained the position of Prajapati by that 
method."

Leaving aside the issue of whether all the saints who are retroactively 
labeled Advaitins actually belong in that category or not, yes there have 
been many who did not engage in formal study of shastras.  But they lived 
in an environment steeped in Vedantic concepts.  They thought about those 
concepts and they put them into practice.  So it is still 
shravana-manana-nidhidhyasana only by a different medium.  Just as if you 
try and understand the teachings of your guru which you hear in an mp3 it 
is just as much s-m-n as if you heard it by sitting in front of him.
