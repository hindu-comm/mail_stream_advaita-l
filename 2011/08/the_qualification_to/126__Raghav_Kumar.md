Namaste

I would only like point out the following. Tthe whole context was that a
brahmaniShTha can emerge without any fresh upadesha or shravaNam in this
birth.

Prajapati (Viraj) was not possessed of aparokSha brahma-jnAnam at that
beginning of the sriShti cycle. (BhAShyakAra hmself says as much.Else the
prospect that someone will be reborn inspite of jnAnam arises.)
And that jnanam did dawn on him without any fresh upadesha from any other
being or Guru. Yes he did have vedic and vedantic mantra and sabdArtha
jnAnam since the vedas etc are said to have emerged effortlessly from him
(yasya nishvasitam veda etc.)

In such an event, when we say aparokSha jnAnam arises in a time-delayed
manner - shravaNam, tapas, upAsanA etc. taking place,in one birth and the
aparokShajnAnam in another. (like jadabharata too for example), what can be
called the cause for the arising of aparokSha jnAnam? bhAShyakAra does not
insist in this particular conext that past shravaNam alone is the immediate
cause for the jnAnam - rather he rounds off his discussion in a more general
tone - " pApAdi pratibandhakShaye cha atmamanasorbhUtArtha jnAna
nimittasvAbhAvyAt" while earlier pointing out that "anupadiShtam eva ekatva
darshanam prajApateH" (for such an exalted Being, jnAna arose spontaneously
without (fresh) upadesha, due to the exalted dharma,jnAna, vairagya, and
aishwarya.)

Also, the distinction between shravaNam and jnAnam also has to be borne in
mind. The jnAna-vRtti has to arise, that alone removes ajnAnam. the point is
that the immediate cause for this jnAna-vRtti to arise need not always be
elaborate upadeSha by a Guru. MadhusUdana Sarasvati says that even a
kAkUkti, ( a  gesture or exclamation of aggression/reprimand)  may be enough
in some cases for this jnAna-vRtti to arise doing the job of a tiger in a
dream to wake us up.

This entire discussion arose in the context that such a possibility of jnAna
arising in certain exalted beings in such a a manner is very much admitted
by bhAShyakAra, and the tendency amongst a small minority of people to look
condescendingly upon those sages (like Sri Ramana or Sri Ramakrishna) who
have not undergone extensive study of bhAshya etc is misplaced, to say the
least, And the idea that a shrotriya-only is superior to a
brahma-niSTha-only (who has not undertaken extensive shAstra study) needs
reconsideration, Perhaps the best way forward is to be receptive and try to
carefully understand what any Guru says, be he of any type without any
pre-conceived notions of who a shrotriya is and who a brahma-niShtha is.

with regards and thanks
raghav.
