With reference to the above,It is said in this list by some that giving jnana also is under the governance of Ishwara.then,that means Ishwara is partial to some and not partial to some.Only if some prays to him he will give whereas he will not bestow to some who does not pray.Which means it is completely under his "Suzerainty".Like the present day leaders and politicians,or offices,only if one grease his palm he will give.That is too bad.should some one appoint a "Lokpal"or "Lokayukta"to check on Ishwara?
In the Brahmasutra it is clearly stated that "Ishwara has no Vaishamya or Nairgrnya".He does not have Hate or partial.
In the Bhagawadgita also it is stated":

"Na datte kasyacit paapam na chaiva suhrtam vibhuh
Ajnanenavrtam Jnanam tena muhyati(ajnanena) jantavah!!"
The delusion is by the "Jiva"himself.That means Ishwara has no likes or dislikes.
N.Srikanta.
