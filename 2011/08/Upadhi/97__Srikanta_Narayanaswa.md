Gaudapada says in the
kArikA all the teachings of creation with the various examples of gold,
iron, etc. are only an 'upAya', a trick really, adopted by the scripture to
drive into the aspirant's head the true nature of Brahman. And this trick
extends to all the infinite glories attributed by the shAstra to Brahman.
____________________________________________________________________________________________
In the above karika of Gaudapada,the examples of Gold,iron,etc.the illustration has to be confined only with regard to the material cause.That means,the mud,gold ,iron etc,is to say that any product like a gold chain,mud pot,or nail cutter are made of their material,but in essence they are the material themselves.Similarly,the world is made from Brahman only.
The Karika says:
"Mrlloha vispullingadaih(sparks from a fire)choditah anyatha!
upayah so avataraya nasti bhedah kathancana!!

Here we find the echo of the sruthi of Chandogyopanishath:
"Vacarambhana vikaro namadeyam!
Mrttike iti eva satyam!!
The above "drstantah"should not be extended to any mysterious explanation.
N.Srikanta.
