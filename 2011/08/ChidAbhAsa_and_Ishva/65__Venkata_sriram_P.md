Namaste,

//
cidAbhAsaH is relevant at the samashTi level or not.

/

Shri Vasudevananda Saraswati denies the chidAbhAsa tattva at samasShTi level.

chidAbhAsa lakShaNa leads to adhyAsa-tAdAtmya & chit-jaDa granthi which is the 
avidyA lakShaNa ofJiva.

Moroever, as discussed earlier, AbhAsa means "IShat bhAsamana lakShaNa" ie., 
the luminosity of Chit gets "diminished" which leads to "kinchit" lakShaNa in Jiva. 

At samaShTi level, there is no "kinchit" lakShaNa.

regs,
sriram
