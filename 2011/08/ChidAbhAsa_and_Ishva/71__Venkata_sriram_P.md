Namaste Subbuji,

////

The आभासः reflection of चित् Consciousness (चिदः आभासः प्रतिबिम्बः
चिदाभासः). With this vyutpatti we can, without flaw, say that the samaShThi
shareeraabhimAni has/is chidAbhAsaH

//

Shri Bellamkonda Ramaraya Kavih while referring to pratibimba tattva refers to Jiva and 
gives references from Siddhanta Lesha Sangraha.

Imagine a Sun in the Sky to be Chit; it's reflection inPond (Ishwara) is said to be Bimba.

When we collect the Pond's Water in a Jar / Pot (Jiva), the reflection of the Sun in the 
Jar / Pot is "pratibimba". 

So, the reflection of consciousness in the Jiva (pratibimba) is also called chidAbhAsaH.

regs,
Sriram
