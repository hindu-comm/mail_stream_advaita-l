Thank you Sriram ji for the clarification of the word cidAbhAsaH as
"IShat-BhAsate..." for the word AbhAsaH etc and Sri Subramanian ji about
Swami Paramarthanandaji's teaching..

Sriram ji, you have written - "prajApati & Ishwara can never be a
chidAbhAsaH as their attributes'. Can you please distinguish between the
two? In making this distinction, is it acceptable to introduce the
2 following words -
kArya-brahma = prajApati (who was a jIva in an earlier kalpa and is now an
AdhikArika purusha)
kAraNa brahma = Ishwara  (who was never a jIva at anytime and is the cause
of even PrajApati as can be concluded from the shvetAshvataropaniShad 3.7,
4.12 etc).


Raghav
