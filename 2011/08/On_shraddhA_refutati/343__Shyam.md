Pranams dear Sri Raghav,

Just to briefly clairfy.

I never said anything about "rebirth takes place only for those who are under the ambit of the Veda" nor is this what I think your learned friend - whom you earlier alluded to - meant. That there is a "spirit" that survives the physical death of the body is a given - accepted by almost all except perhaps the lokAyata. What the excerpt from the Skanda Purana seems to suggest, is that non-Vedic Scriptures - of the Abrahamaic religions for example - that promise a particular result - typically a place in Heaven - in return for a lifestyle that is committed to be in conformity to their own enjoined precepts - will have validity for the devout that find themselves born into that particular sampradaya - because they may been fashioned by the All-knowing All-merciful as being the best preparatory ground from the standpoint of that particular jivA's temperament. 

Now terms such as eternal that those Scriptures allude to - as it applies to Heaven and Hell may not mean the absolute eternal - but only relative eternal - our own scriptures too mention these types of stations that may hint at eternality - vid. Shankara bhasya for BG 16.20 for what almost seems like eternal damnation and one can take, among many examples - the NAchiketa sacrifice as something that is in a sense an "eternal" heaven - though in both instances it is clear that really speaking what is meant to be "eternal" is only from a relative sense and not an absolute sense. 

Hence one can see that this postulate does not detract in anyway from the fact the kshine punye martyalokam vishanti of the GitA. In any case such speculative exegesis is both needless and, imo, beyond the parametric ambit of an AstikA. 

This also is irrelevant to the title of this thread - about refutation of (Abrahamic) theology.

Thank you for a very stimulating discussion.

Hari OM
Shyam
