> If the meaningis ,dhiyoyonah=dhiyah+yah+nah,which means "let my
 intellect not be illumined!The entire mantra has to be seen totally to 
know its significance.dhiya may mean intellect.No one will split while 
chanting the mantra as "dhiyah,yah nah",but simply as "dhiyoyonah 
prachodayath".


Dear Shrikantaji,

Several list members 
have pointed out that you have made huge blunders in your 
interpretations. It is time to concede the point and stop posting on 
this topic.

Dear jaldhar vyasji
I would like to point out that there are no bluders in my interpretations.this is another way of interpreting a sanskrit sentance along with many others.there is no need to be touchy upon this.There are words like "Bhuthayoni',"Brahmayoni"etc.in the Upanishaths and Shankara Bhashyas.I as a well wisher to this list wish that it be examined with a calm mind,without having the preoccupation that they are the only interpretations.There is no bluder in this interpretation.The purpose of this list is to study Advaita than searching for bluders.It is high time it is stopped.

N.Srikanta.
