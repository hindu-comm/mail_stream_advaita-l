RV: If you accept one secondary source (Michael Comans), you have to accept
others (Paul Hacker). According to the latter's research, Brahman and
Ishwara are interchangeably used everywhere in Sankara Bhasya! To be fair,
Ramanuja resolves the objection of selective attribution of qualities  to
Brahman by classifying the locus of attributes - Ishwara, Nitya Siddha and
Baddhatma. As I mentioned in an earlier mail, the problem in his approach is
that the relationship between the attribute and the object is ill-defined.
This is resolved by Madhwa but he cannot define the locus of the
relationship itself as it is a real entity and cannot exist in two
substratum. Sankara resolves it the best by denying all particularities in
Brahman, which is Infinite. It is like white light which is none of the
colours but is the sum of all colours present as white manifested
individually through the prism of maya.

Adi Sankara will say Isvaratva of Isvara is illusion. If Madhusudana or
anyone says opposite he is not agreeing with Sankaracharya.

RV: He refers (cf. BG 15.14 - 18) to Nirupadhikara Brahman as Ishwaranila
(by nature Ishwara). It is because Ishwara is not Rulership. When the river
merges in to the ocean, the ocean does not sublate but the river does and
along with that the river's perception of the ocean. From the Ocean's
perspective, there is none other than itself.

But there is one objection. If Krishna has Prakruta Sharira like us how he
could at once enjoy and impregnate 16000 wives and have so many sons. How he
could lift Govardhana with one finger and how could he kill so many demons
in Gokula? Only superhuman can do this.

RV: You can acquire siddhis to operate multiple bodies or play around with
material laws. The main point is what Madhusudana says. It cannot be gross,
subtle, limited or cosmic because all of them belong to someone and He is
already in them as the Inner Controller. It has to be maya rupam and
aprakrtam as Sankara says.

RV: As quoted earlier, an adhikarapurusha can do it. That a jivan mukta's
body is a product of prarabda karma is well known and its nature is distinct
from that of the Lord.
