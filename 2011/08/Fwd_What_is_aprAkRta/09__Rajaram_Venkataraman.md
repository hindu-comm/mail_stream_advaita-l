Sri Subrahmanian had perhaps forgotten to reply and when prompted sent a
reply to me individually. If no one disagrees, I will take it as the
official position.

It is not the Lord's names and forms that forms part of Brahman in that
Upanishadic mantra.  In the final analysis, all the material worlds and the
bodies are merely names and forms with their substance being Brahman.  In
other words,. Brahman alone appears as those very many names and forms.
 That is what is called vivarta.

This is exactly what is meant by vivarta.
