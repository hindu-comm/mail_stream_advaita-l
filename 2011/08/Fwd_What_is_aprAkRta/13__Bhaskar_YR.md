> RV: Madhusudana says that the Lord's form is NOT CREATED at all. He also
supports the view that the Lord and His form are non-different.

And shankara says lord's form (upAdhi) and his omniscience, omnipotence 
etc. holds good only in transactional reality where avidyA holds sway. So, 
as per shankara, empirically speaking para brahman conditioned by name and 
form which have been set up by avidyA becomes Ishwara or Lord, just as 
universal ether limited as it were by jar space, pot space etc.  I think 
the statement : ' Lord and his form or body are non-different'  is the 
stand of vishishtAdvaita. 

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
