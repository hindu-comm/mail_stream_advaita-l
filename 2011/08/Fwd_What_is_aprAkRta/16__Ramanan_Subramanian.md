My two cents on this issue:

//

It would be incorrect to say that.  Just like the Ishwara's avatara has a
beginning and end on the physical plane and yet the devotee several
centuries later too can pray and be blessed by that avatara, a jivanmukta
too can be prayed to and his blessings and guidance got by devotees  long
after his physical death.

I would refer to Bhagavatam and Sridhara Swami's commentary on the same. It
adds credence to RV's position:

lokābhirāmāḿ sva-tanuḿ dhāraṇā-dhyāna-mańgalam
yoga-dhāraṇayāgneyyādagdhvā dhāmāviśat svakam (11.31.6)

Sridharaswami's commentary:

योगिनामिव स्वच्छन्द-मृत्यु भ्रमं वारयति -- लोकाभिरामं इति । अयम् अर्थः -
योगिनो हि स्वच्छन्द-मृत्यवः, स्वां तनुं आग्नेय्या योग-धारणया दग्ध्वा
लोकान्तरम् प्रविशन्ति । भगवांस्तु न तथा, किन्त्वदग्ध्वैव स्व-तनु-सहित एव
स्वकं धाम वैकुण्ठाख्यं अविशत् । तत्र हेतुः -- लोकाभिरामम् । लोकानां
अभिरामोऽभितो रमणं स्थितिर्यस्यां ताम् । जगदाश्रयत्वेन जगतोऽपि दाह-प्रसङ्गाद्
इत्यर्थः । किञ्च, धारणाया ध्यानस्य च मन्गलं शोभनम् । विषयं इतरथा
तयोर्निर्विषयत्वं स्यात् । दृश्यते च आद्यपि तद्-उपासकानां तथैव
तद्रूपसाक्शात्कारः फलप्राप्तिश्चेति भावः । इच्छाशरिइराभिप्रायेण वा यथाश्रुतं
एवास्तु, तत्रापि तु लोकाभिरामां इत्यादिइनां विशेषाणामानर्थक्य-प्रसन्गात्,
तदप्यदग्ध्वा तिरोधाय निर्गत इत्येव साम्प्रतम् ॥
Here is a relevant quote from Vishnu Sahasranama Bhashya of Shankara

"mRutaM maraNam , tadrahitaM vapurasyeti amRutavapuH" ('amRutavapuH' is He
Whose body is free from death)
