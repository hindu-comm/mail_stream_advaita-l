In the former case, however, the effects exist in the cause prior to 
manifestation
AS the CAUSE ITSELF.

praNAms
Hare Krishna

And it is also better to be noted that cause does not 'become' effect at 
any point of time to say in srushti cause has become effect.  brahmA 
KaraNa vAda is just there to strengthen the vedAntic ultimate truth that 
is ajAta vAda and to refute other vAda-s like pradhAna kAraNa vAda, 
satkArya vAda, asatkArya vAda etc. propagated by other schools.  kArikA 
bhAshya of shankara confirms this.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
