Just adding a clarification: This is what is called the vedAnta sat-kArya
vAda as opposed to the saankhya sat kArya vAda.  In the latter the effects
exist in the cause prior to creation/manifestation as the effects.  In the
former case, however, the effects exist in the cause prior to manifestation
AS the CAUSE ITSELF.
