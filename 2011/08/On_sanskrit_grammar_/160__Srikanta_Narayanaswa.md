Guna sandhi is an ach-sandhi not a hal-sandhi.

What I said about the website on the ongoing lectures in sanskrit grammar sent by Ramakrishna,that the lectures could have been better organised from fundamentals than presenting at random as in the web starting from 'Halantha"without proper explanations.
The word "Chidabhasa'is a "Gunasandhi"since the "ta"in Cjth is replaced by "da"as per 'Gunasandhi".
similarly,the word ending with "E"can be replaced by 'Ae".
