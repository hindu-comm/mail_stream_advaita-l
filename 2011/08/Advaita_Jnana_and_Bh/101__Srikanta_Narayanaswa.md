With reference to the above discussion,the B.G clearly differentiates between "Jnana and Bhakthi".

The B.G 12.12 states:
"Shreyo hi Jnanamadhyasa Jnanadhyanam vishishyate!
dhyanat karmaphalastyagatyagascchantiranantaram!!"The B.G 11.55 states:
Matkarma krtmatparamo madbhaktah sangavarjitah!
nirvairah sarvabhuteshu yahsah mameti Pandava!!-11.55.
Mayyeva mana adhastva mayi buddhim niveshaya!
nivasishtasi mayyaiva ata urdhvam nasamshayah!!--12.8.

This is superior to all mukthisadhana in Gita(9.34,11.55,B.Bhasya 723,18.65.bb 1121)
since this "Sagunopasana"has to be performed only dependent on the imagined "atmaishwara Bhdha"(12.12.Bb743),only through the "nirupadhika"Brahma Jnana there occurs mukti directly(13.12.Bb792,13.14,13.15,13.17,13.18.Bb799 to 809)
Therefore what is performed from the point of view of Karma,it is from the point of view of Karma pradhana is called "karma Yoga"That from the point of iew of 'ishwara pradhana"is called 'Bhakthi yoga".The karma is a an external tool for the "dhyana yoga"(6.3,Bb385).One who "Bhajati'Vasudeva is greater than all Yogis who worship other Devatas.One who worship the devatas are also Sathwikas(!7.4.Bb794).For them they get the "sayujya of that devatas"(9.25;Bb585).But, those bhaktas of other devataswho worship Vasudeva who is the Atma of other devatas,but they know not,hence they obtain that 'Phala"(9.23,(.24.Bb583;7.23.Bb487)

"antavattu phalam trsam tadvatyalpa medhasam!
Devan devayajo yanti madbhakta yanti mamapi!1--11.23.
But,the fruit they obtain from this has an endThat happens for them who have'alpamedhas"One who worships the devatas reach the devatas.My Bhaktas will reach me also.
Artha Jignasu ,artharthi ,Jnani--these fouldfold Sukrtinoh worship(bhajati)me(7.16.Bb 475)
Tose who have no nimitta of Artha who worship me with Love,He gives the "Buddhiyoga'and dwelling in their hearts,with the light of Jnana dispels the darkness of ignorance.
The Bhagavath tattva by all its Yoggaishvarya and SarvaJnana shakti are two:Sopadhika saguna rupa,and nirupadhika nirvishesha rupa.(12.1.Bb724)among these two to worship(bhajathi) the Saguna rupa is more easier(12.7.734)Therefore,placing the Manobuddhi on the "Bhagavan"and performing his actions one has to be his Bhaktha.(11.55.Bb723,17.8.Bb736)
This is shresta of all the Gitoktha mukthi sadhana.(9.34.Bb600,11.55.723,18.65.Bb1121).But,this "sagunopasana"
is based on the division(bhdha)on the Atmaishwara bhdha,and has to be performed based on this division(12.12.Bb743),only through the knowledge of the "Nirupadhika Brahma"the Mukthi is attained directly(13.12.Bb792;13.14,13.15,13.17,13.18:Bb from 799 to 805).
In the above the slokas refer to adhyayas in the B.G and the Bb refers to the Bhashya of Shankara.

N.Srikanta.
