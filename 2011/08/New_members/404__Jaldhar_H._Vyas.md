Nataraja
--------

Hello, I am Nataraja, an earlier member of the list; I am 29 yrs old, 
studied Rigveda and Yajurveda.


Lakshminarayan
--------------

I am a believer of advaita vedanta propogated by Adi shankaracharya. My 
gurudev is H.H Sringeri Jagadguru Anantha vibhushitha Sri Sri bharathi 
tirtha maha samiji. I am practicing my sadhana as guided by H.H.

What attracted me towards adi sankara was the following:

Who lived like what he preached

Whom i believe was the first person in india the concept of national 
integration by appointing peetadipathis who are not from the same region.

Who with his excellent intellect and logic demonstarted what the vedas 
preached

What ever modernday reformers say was well told by Adisankara


Reid B. Locklin
---------------

I am a scholar in the field of Hindu-Christian studies.  I have published 
several articles and two books related to Sankara and the Sankara 
hagiographies; I am particularly interested, however, in broadening my 
understanding of the post-Sankara Advaita scholastic tradition.
