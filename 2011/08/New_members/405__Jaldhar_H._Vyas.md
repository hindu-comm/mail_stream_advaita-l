BN Dinesh
---------

i am a 30 year old seeker of Truth.  my turn to Vedanta, was after a 
medic declined to treat my anxiety disorder in 2008.  Madhusudana 
Saraswati's "Bhagavad Gita" cured my suffering.  Today i am a believer. 
"Vishnu Sahasranama" is a routine.  i no longer try to control my life, 
instead have passed on the burden to the Lord.  Presently reading "Katha 
Upanishad"
