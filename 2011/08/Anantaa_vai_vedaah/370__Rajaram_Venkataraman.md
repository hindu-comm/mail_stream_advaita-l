A Brahma Jnani is sarvajna but this jnanam is undifferentiated because it is
an hindrance to the experience of bliss. His state, the state of Vishnu, is
beyond the known and unknown. Just as we cannot say with respect to Brahman
that it knows or it does not know, so is it with respect to a Brahma Jnani.
He is identical with the Nirupadhika Ishwara.  However, the question arises
because it is hard to see some one who is a sarvajna though we hear that
with respect to few. This is because, as you know, there are four stages of
jivan mukti and it is in the the highest stage that this is irrefutably
true. In the previous stages, though the ajnana associated with the jiva is
destroyed, the mental modifications continues to exist, which is the cause
of error. Even in these stages, if the mental modifications have been
destroyed through practice of yoga, then there is no possibility of error
because the mind becomes fully transparent to knowledge in Brahman. All that
we see in the Universe is particularization of Brahma Jnanam through Maya.

Vedas are ananta because they transcendental to space, being the breadth of
brahman, not because they have mathematically infinite number of mantras.
Mathematics itself is finite evne if it deals with the infinite.
