I think there will be some questions that will come up in this regard:


   - There is a method of deciding what one's sva-shakhA is: the one that
   his father studied and the one his father and so on.  I do not know how the
   latest 'veda' will be treated.  In other words, who will be the students
   that will be studying it (adhyayana)?
   - I have heard that there is a vidhi: '....anya shiShyAn na bodhayet' - a
   vedic Acharya should not teach someone who belongs to a shAkhA/veda that is
   different from his own veda/shAkha.  The reason is that by doing so he will
   be disrespectful to the Acharya of the other veda/shAkha. There is a method
   of taking his permission and ceremonially inducting the student of the other
   veda into this veda for study.
   - Who will decide as to which shAkhA or veda the newly discovered mantras
   belong?
   - First of all, is there any provision in the Veda or sampradaya for
   inclusion of newly discovered mantras into the existing vedic fold?
   - There might be other technical issues that I am unaware of.
   - Have any of the Acharyas of the vedic sampradaya recognized these newly
   discovered mantras?  Do they have the authority to get the general eligible
   public to do adhyayana of them?
   - Who has learned them methodically from whom?
   - To your question on the Vedic seers of the Vedas and the present two I
   can only say that we have no yardstick to make such a comparison.


I have nothing personal for or against the particular two persons involved
in the mantra darshana here.  I am only expressing the general views on
this.
