Dear Shrinivas Ji,

///
I am suggesting let us be open to the claim that 
brahma vidyA also opens doors to all vyAvahArika 
sciences and arts. Those few who want 
//

This is not true.  One cannot expect a brahmajnani to
write Java Applets & Oracle Programs in a jiffy.

I don't remember the exact source now but when a devotee asked 
Bhagavan Ramana that "does a jnani knows everything" to which
Bhagavan replied a jnani "knows everything worth knowing".
But yes, there are certain instances where yogis have mastered the parA vidya 
in a very short span because of their mEdhA, dhAraNa shaktis. But then it is a yogic feat.

On certain day in Chennai, Shri Chandrasekhara Bharati had to give discourse in Tamil one evening. Till that day, His Holiness didn't know Tamil. The same day in morning, He prayed to Mother Sharada and contemplated on His gurunatha Shri Sacchidananda Nrisimha Bharati Mahaswamigal.  In the evening, His Holiness spoke extempore in Tamil.    
Bhagavan Ramana mastered Sanskrit in no time with the help of Shri Ganapati Muni. 

So, these are the rare siddhis exhibited by great souls. So, when Brahmavidya has been mastered, rest of the vidyas are just a small fry for them which is not impossible.

regs,
sriram
