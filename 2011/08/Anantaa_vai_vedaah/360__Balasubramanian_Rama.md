That's an interesting question.

The arthavAda is the praise that the knowledge of the sAvitracayanam
is equal to the knowledge of all the vedas, the arthavaada is not on
the "anantaa.h" characteristic of the vedas. The text says
"avi~jnaataan **iva* darshayaan cakaara". The parable is that the
mountain was so big and at such a distance, that it's size could not
be comprehended by the human intellect, although not "infinite" in the
mathematical sense of the word. Bhaaradvaaja with 75 years of study (3
lifetimes, 1 lifetime = 25 years) in comparison had mastered portions
in comparison to the large mountain, was 3 small lumps of mud. So as a
practical matter, the sentence can be taken literally.

There is an parallel adage in Tamil "kaRRatu kallaLavu, kallaatatu
malaiyaLavu", although not applied to the veda in particular.
