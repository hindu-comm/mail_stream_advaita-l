I am not referring to the possibility or otherwise of the existence of a sarvajna.
I am talking about the problems behind the notion that all human knowledge
is encapsulated in the veda mantra-s. I hope the distinction is clear. To amplify,
I am talking about the potential problems behind this, viz. wanting to go a step
further and "discover" new "veda" texts that cover everything: from things like
"Esorvedam" to aeronautical engineering and outer space exploration to genetics.

The beauty of advaita vedAnta, which I can see is not appreciated well, is that
even when an obstacle to a particularized knowledge appears, he is still the same
as That in reality. He is, most definitely, NOT different from Him who is That. 
If he is definitely, really different, nothing can make him That.
