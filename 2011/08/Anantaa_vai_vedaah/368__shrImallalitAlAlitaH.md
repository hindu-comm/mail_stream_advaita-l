Definite number of shAkhA-s doesn't comprise of unlimited mantras. This is
also generally believed.

Nope.

They are finite and reveal finite knowledge. Cause ? Revelation of things
known by other pramANas by veda-s will make them apramANa. Either accept
them apramANa or finite. Both are not possible.

anantA is used for veda-s and not anything else.
Word don't say anything which they don't say.

mImAMsaka-s and vedAntins, both accept that veda-s are learned by
guru-shiShya-paramparA. There is no such revelation in samAdhi for both.
mImAMsaka-s even not accept any sarvaGYa puruSha.
Moreover,
meditation or samAdhi are just repetition of same vR^itti. They are not any
mean of knowledge. So, they can't produce any new knowledge.
Even if I accept that some knowledge is produced, I'll like to know the
cause to label them as veda. Is vedatvam of that knowledge is also revealed
in samAdhi ?
I've already said that knowledge is not veda. Specific words are veda.
I already asked you about R^shi-s. Can you tell me about the source where it
is said that veda-s were first revealed to R^iShis in samAdhi ? The meaning
gained by vyutpatti, i.e. "R^iShayo mantradraShTAraH", is not enough to
prove this.
Accepting sarvaGYa puruSha and revelation in samAdhI will make scriptures of
bauddha, jaina, muslims, etc. veda and everyone of them a R^iShi.

I don't think a lamp illumines all things of this world and so veda-s.

No commentary can prove this.
Writing in Sanskrit is not enough to negate pramANas.
manu knew all veda-s. He taught others. See a sentence from parimala
indicating this :
सर्गादौ सर्वान्वेदानध्यापितेष्वीश्वरवत्सार्वज्ञ्यरहितेषु मन्वादिषु ....
Do you want to say that through veda he also knew about dna, computers,
internet, etc. ? I've no cause to believe you even if you say 'yes'.
The above sentence also proves that veda-s are not ananta. If they were
ananta, it would be impossible to study and teach them for anyone, including
Ishvara.

Impossible for the given reason.
The problem is that words of AchArya are proved baseless. To prove them true
some follower of AchArya should come and show the correct meaning.
I'm not interested in a branching discussion dealing with 'sarvaGYatvam of
Ishvara derived from kAraNatvam of veda-s'.

Your reasoning actually proves it flawed.
