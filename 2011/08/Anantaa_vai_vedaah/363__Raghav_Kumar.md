Namaste Sri Subrahmanian ji,  Rama ji and all other friends,
In trying to better understand "anantA vai vedAH", (the Vedas are
limitless),  the following points/questions come up.

1. The word vedAH quite clearly refers to the "veda mantra-s" and not to the
shAkha-s (recensions) which are generally agreed to be a definite number.

2 The question is, does anantA mean "the Veda mantras are numerically
infinite (and accordingly encapsulate limitless knowledge)" or whether "a
fixed and finite number of Veda mantra-s alone exist which are faithfully
reproduced but still can enfold limitless knowledge"

To elaborate :let us take it that the mantra-s are finite in number,  the
word anantA can possibly accounted for by taking it to mean that "analysis,
elucidation and cogitation (mImAmsA, vistAra, tapas ) based upon the
original veda mantras leads to an infinite multi-layered depth and also
breadth of knowledge (vij~nAna) enfolded in the Vedas which can thus be
gradually unfolded" ,.
(the unfoldment which takes place due to Ishvara - (IshvaraH .. kArayAmAsa)
- will naturally be termed 'paurusheya' - knowledge born of human
insight while the original mantras which enfold (encase) it are apaurusheya
- since in the Veda mantras the knowledge (shabdArtha-j~nAna) and the words
(shabda) are simultaneous.)
In the brahma sUtra-s,  शास्त्रयोनित्वात (BSB 1.1.3) - "Brahman is
all-knowing because he is the manifester/source of the Vedas"  is given as a
**complete and sufficient** reason for Brahman's All-knowledge
(सर्वज्ञत्वं).  In the bhAShya on this sUtra, it is clear that the word
shAstra refers only to the Vedas and bhAShyakAra says that the Vedas have
the capacity to bring to light ALL objects (i.e., give us their
knowledge), saying
महत:  ऋग्वेदादे: .... प्रदीपावत् सर्वार्थावद्योतिन: सर्वज्ञकल्पस्य योनि:
ब्रह्म
(Brahman is known as All-knowledge BECAUSE it is the source of the Vedas
which have the capacity to illuminate all objects, like even a lamp brings
to light all objects; the Vedas although 'acetana' themseles are thus no
less "all-knowledge" - they are termed सर्वज्ञकल्प: being pervaded by the
power of Ishvara)
Moreove, the sub-commentary also echoes this and says -
 वेदे  हि सर्वार्थप्रकाशनशक्तिरुपलभ्यते (bhAshya ratnaprabhA) (In the Vedas
lies the power to illuminate all (objects) that exists.), and after asking
whether Brahman's सर्वज्ञत्वं (omniscience) can be established purely on the
ground that He breathed out the Vedas or is there anything called
"knowledge not derivable from the Veda', in which case, just because He
breathed out the Vedas, we cannot rush to the conclusion that He is
omniscient, after asking this question, shrI govindAnanda indiates that "वेद
हेतुत्वेन ब्रह्मण: सर्वज्ञत्वं साधायति" ,  we conclude therefore that
"ALL knowledge, past, present, and future, (both known and unknown)  lies
encapsulated (needs only mImAmsa and upadesha) or
atleast enfolded (additionally needs tapas), in the Veda mantras". (not to
speak of that brahman-knowledge which of beyond both.)
 If we say, "No", and that there is other "secular" knowledge available in
this world, such as व्याकरणम् (grammar) logic etc., which has
no (in-principle)traceable connection to the Veda, and that such other
knowledge cannot be accordingly traced back to a Vedic source, then there is
a flawed hetu (reason) in saying that "Brahman is all-knowledge BECAUSE He
is the source of the Vedas." . The mere fact of the existence of any
non-vedic knowledge which can be derived independent of any elucidation by
tapas/cogitation/upadesa etc of the Veda would negate the possibility of
Ishvara's sarvaj~natvaM being premised on the all-knowledge that is the
Veda. But since, the hetu (reason)  is not flawed we have to contend that
"All knowledge secular and sacred is enfolded in the Veda mantras. By
gradual unfoldment, knowledge of all objects can be revealed, right from
grammar and logic to the knowledge of the basis of all knowledge which is
advitIyam brahma."
Is this acceptable? Can't this be asserted even at the vyAvAhArika
(empirical) level without invoking the brahmAstra viz.,at the pAramArthika
(absolute) level of understanding/unfoldment brahma-vidyA is most certainly
sarva-vidyA pratiShThA ?

Om
Raghav

P.S. Here the Vedic "capacity to bring to light all objects". I take this to
mean the capacity to produce in the antaHkaraNa, under suitable
unfoldment,(mImAmsA),  born of upadesha and most importantly tapas, ALL
possible types of pratyaya-s (corresponding to the respective objects of the
jagat (World) being brought to light during the mantra unfoldment process
.)  In such an arrangement,the original mantras remain apaurusheya
(revealed) but the later unfoldment can well be called paurusheya (by human
insight meditating upon the Veda or its derivatives.).
Also, it goes without saying that the uniqueness (alaukikatA) of the Veda
rests not on its ability to replicate the knowledge derivable from other
pramANa-s, nyAya etc.; in such cases such vedic vAkya-s are
ofcourse anuvAdArthavAda (tautological). That is well-known. But the point
is that the Vedic mantras form the basis of ALL vishesha (particularized)
knowledge even at the vyAvahArika level.  In other words, all laukika
vidyA-s (empirical knowledge) is merely a paurusheya (born of human insight)
unfoldment of Veda mantra-s. That is the contention being examined.
