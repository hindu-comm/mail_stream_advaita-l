If you are not following a single school of thought, then you will never
reach a conclusion.
Moreover, सूर्याचन्द्रमसौ धाता यथापूर्वमकल्पयत् proves creation of specific
things (and not all) in same manner.

They don't tell that it's 'not an arthavAda'  . So, it will prove it
arthavAda. This is according to your nyAya.
Not negating a thing doesn't prove a thing true. And, not all thing is
mentioned by commentators. There are limits. Otherwise after bhAShyam of
sha~Nkara there must not arise any doubt.

Even if shAkhAs of three veda-s are numerous, it will be impossible for us
to study all shAkhA-s.
So, there is no need to accept their limitlessness. I've shown other
problems in original thread.

See original thread.

We say that whole veda is given to brahmA and he gives different shAkhA-s to
R^iShis.
We have never said that un-breathed  veda-s even exist.

LYV uses stories to convey it's idea.
Moreover, janakatvam is not a jAtI, because manuShyatvam is enough to do all
work.

  The possibility of a change in the name of

How ?
Even now people repeat veda-s as 'gramophone record'. Any change in that is
not accepted.

Any change in veda expects AyAsa. So, it will be pauruSheya.
Even if a portion is changed, the whole is changed.
Leave nityatvam. mImAMsakas accept that. But, a person talking Ishvara as
origin of veda must know that they are not nitya. Anyway they are made
pauruSheya by your assumptions.

mImAMsakas and vedAntins, both say that veda-s are coming from
anAdi-paramparA. No one accepts any R^iShi as starting point. If you think
so, you are not talking according to mImAMsA or vedAnta. I leave it on you
to resolve.

According to mImAMsakas, it didn't start at specific time.
Vedantin's accept their start at sR^iShTi or kalpArambha, etc.
We don't accept Darwin's theory or modern science's theory of creation.
If you accept then don't talk of veda-s as pramANa, apauruSheyatva, Ishvara,
etc. It will be impossible to prove.

I know it.
But, as you check every assumption of mImAMsaka-s, vedAntin-s, we expect you
to check every assumption of theories which you have borrowed from anywhere
else, including pratyakSha, anumAna, science, etc.

You are free to accept them as real, but only after leaving apauruSheyatva,
Ishvara, dharma, etc.

That's because we lack study according to single school.
We also fail to check where we are mixing other theories without checking.

We never heard it from any purANa, etc.
LYV is not a pramANa as veda, purANa, etc.

True.

True.
