Vishyji PraNAms

It is simple, immediate and yet profound truth - The very subject seeker is the sought - The recognition of I am that what I am longing for takes clear understanding and constant shifting of attention from dissipating objectification process to that because of which even the objects are revealed or known. In the process all objects are recognized as vibhuuti of the Lord - Nay of myself. Iswara as though merged as Me - no paaramaarthika/vyaavahaarika differentiation. It is Me and my vibhuuti nothing else.

with Best wishes 
Sadananda

Poojya swami Virajeshwara , once discussing these things said, " as long as you (I) are there HE is not there, but once HE is there YOU are not there" so simple but so beautiful it was. I took time to understand this too , but once I understood
rest was so easy.
