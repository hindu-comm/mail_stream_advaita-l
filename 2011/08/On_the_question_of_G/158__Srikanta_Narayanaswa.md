Al the sciptures on dvaita unequivocally state that the "Guru is within You".there are two kinds of "Gurus"one is 
"Chodaka Guru(the Upadesha Guru),another is Prachodaka Guru which is within ourselves.That is why,Gayatri mantra says 'Diyoyonah Prachodayath".It is "diyoyoni"which is in every one's heart.as the Mundaka sruthi states'Nihitam Guhayam".Ramana also says "Hrdaya kuhara madhye".That is why skandan or Subramanya is given the name,"Guhan".Vishnushasranama chants,"gahano guhah".The B>g has a chapter,:"ajayoga Raja Guhya yoga".
