Perform intense devotion to Visnu by remembering Him as your omniscient Lord
who is always present with you as your innermost Self etc. Pl. note that
even if you were born in an orthodox brahmin family, you still need bhagavad
bhakti. We are all dependant on Isvaranugraha for Self realization anyways.
Sastras  gave restrictions because if one does not have citta suddhi and
inclination for jnana through purva janma karma, atma jnana is a hindrance
to normal life.
