Dear All,

Please receive by this medium a cordial salute ยก

I have a cuestion on the word "brahma"

I found that the commontranslations of the Rig Veda take it as meaning "prayer"

with the accent on the first letter a,

And that it means "priest clan" with the accent in the last a,


Is this correct?

Moreover I pose the question: what would be the impediments of translate the word "brahma" as "the absolute" directly in the Rig Veda ?

Or at least translate it as the "growing one" or somethin like that?


I hope not to be inoportune,

Thanks before hand,

ATT

Anselmo
