I admit that these questions are somewhat metaphysical and can never be answered to 100% satisfaction. But I also would suggest it is worthwhile to look into them without bringing in the idea that Vedanta tatparya is not in srishti but in ajati. While dealing with questions at the adhyaropa stage, it may be worthwhile to answer such questions as best as possible without jumping to apavada and saying that jagat is mithya, anyway. ( I got thisresponse toofrom some friends, I talked to.)

Thank you

Raghavji

As for the word"ajati"i think this list is far from discussing what is Ajati as you have mentioned.
Thank You,

In fact the purpose of any Vedantic enquiry whether it is Advaita,Vishishtadvaita and Dvaita is to find the truth.naturally the question comes what is 'shristi"?Also we donot know what is "ajati".If we simply accept that 'shristi"is a mere creation without looking into what it is.Then there is no need into rack our brains into it.It just concerns in our eating,sleeping etc,which are mundane activities.we can also console our selves with the idea that Vedanta tatparya need not concern with "shristi".What is "adhyaropa"?What is "apavada"?we cannot form from this that jagat is "Mithya".All questions will remain to be in metaphysical state until they are understood.
