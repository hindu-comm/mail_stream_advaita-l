Namaste,

bhAgavatam contains multiple descriptions of evolution of 
tattva-s. Recently was reading the description in Book2, 
Chapter 5 (2.5.24). While describing the vaikArika, taijasa, 
and tAmasa ahamkAra, jnAna, kriyA, and dravya shakti-s are 
listed. While, jnAna, and kriyA shakti-s are mentioned in 
many places in literature, dravya shakti is hardly mentioned. 
Would appreciate if some list members can shed some more light 
on dravya shakti.

(Also mentioned in dAsabodha 17.9.6, where rAmadAsa swami 
lists kriyA, dravya, icchA and jnAna as the fourfold shakti.)

Is it likely that what are termed as AvaraNa shakti and 
vikSepa shakti in vedAnta, are jointly referred to as dravya 
shakti elsewhere?

Regards,
Shrinivas
