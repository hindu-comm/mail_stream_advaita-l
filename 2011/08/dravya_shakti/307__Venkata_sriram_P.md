Namaste,

This is taken from “kaivalya navaneeta”, which is a treatise based on
Sakta Advaita which is authored by a great srividyOpAsaka in Andhra 
Pradesh.

There is an elaborate chapter on PanchikaraNa vidhAna with
2 sections as sthUla panchIkaraNa and sUkShma panchIkaraNa.

These are the excerpts from sthUla panchIkaraNa paddhati.

///////

There are 2 aspects of mUla-prakriti. 1) Amala 2) malina 

This malina is of 3 categories: malina sattva, malina rajas 
and malina tamas.

Among these, malina sattva guNa is called mAyA. The parabrahma that is
reflected in this mAyA is called "Ishwara" . This "mAyOpAdhika-IshwarA" 
is called " avyAkrita / antaryAmi”. 

Malina Rajo-guNa is called Avidya. The parabrahman that is reflected in this
Avidya is "Jiva". 

Malina Tamo-guNa is called "AvaraNa sakti" . The reflection of parabrahman in
AvaraNa sakti is called "VikShepa sakti". 

>From this vikShepa sakti, originates the AkAsa tattva with 
"sabda" (sound) as essence. This is presided by parAshakti. 
Among the 5 face of Shiva, this represents “IshAna mukha” 
that represents “ya-kAra bIja”

>From akAsa with sabda tanmAtra, evolved the vAyu having sabda & sparsha (touch)
tanmAtrAs. This is presided by adi-sakti. Among the 5 faces of Shiva, 
this represents “tatpuruSha mukha” that represents “va-kAra bIja”. 

>From Vayu with sabda, sparsha tanmAtrAs, evolves Agni having 
sabda, sparsha & rupa (form) guNas. This is presided by “Kriya Sakti”. 
Among the 5 faces of Shiva, this represents “aghOra mukha” that 
represents “si-kAra bIja”. 

>From Agni with sabda, sparsha, rupa guNas, evolves jala 
with sabda, sparsha, rupa & rasa (taste). This is presided by 
“Jnana Sakti”. Among the 5 faces of Shiva, this represents 
“vAmadEva mukha” that represents “ma-kAra bIja”. 

>From jala with sabda, sparsha, rupa, rasa, evolves the prithvi having sabda,
sparsha, rupa, rasa & gandha (smell) guNAs. This is presided by
“Iccha Sakti” that represents the “sadyOjAta mukha” of Shiva. The bija mantra
That represents this prithivi (bhU) tattva is “na-kAra bIja”. 

This is sthUla-panchIkaraNa vidhAna that evolves pancha (5) bhUtAs
that represents5 faces of Shiva. Each is presided by corresponding 
Sakti and bIja viz., na, ma, si, va, ya respectively. When
joined becomes panchAkShari mahAmantra ie., namaH sivAya.

Since, the dravya sakti contributes itself in the evolution of 
pancha bhUtAs & pancha tanmAtrAs, so, 
IMHO, it can be compared with the vikShEpa sakti.
