namaste,

In dashaka#5 of naarayaNIyaM, the creation process has been
summarized, and Shri Sastri-ji, the translator, has written that this
dashaka is a condensation of that particular section you have referred
to from bhaagavatam.

There does not seem to be a reference to the dravya shakti in there,
but reading shlokas 5-8, seems to suggest that dravya-skakti may be
tAmasik and associated with the source of shabda and further
tanmAtra-s (my interpretation)?

namaste
Ramakrishna
