Shree Rajaram - PraNAms

Beautiful explanation. I enjoyed reading this. God bless you and thanks. 

Vedas start with Dharma - Gita starts with Dharma. What I do not want others do to me, I should not do to others and what I expects others do to me I should do to others - is simple yet profound dharma to be followed. Gita is full of instructions of what human being has to follow to be worthy of a human form. 

Hari Om!
Sadananda

The human conscience tells us to speak the truth, not to be violent to other
living beings, be impartial in our judgement, ensure welfare of all living
beings in our dealings, remove suffering and enhance happiness for all etc.
We do not derive our morals from textual sources but from our own inner
voice. Even total atheists have high morals if they listen to their inner
voice. We silence this inner guide to fulfill our desires. In this
endeavour, certain religious texts and interpretations thereof come handy.
Those who are on the path of knowledge wherever they are on the journey will
accept the divine guide. Those who are on the path of destruction will
reject it.
