"if a fundamentalist muslim or christian were to claim similar infallible
apaurusheya status for their respective scriptures, we should be able to
logically show a fallacy in such claims without invoking the need for
"faith" and "belief" 

My question is "why?"
Is logic both sufficient or necessary to legitamize shraddhA, when the latter relates to a realm that is beyond the range of ordinary human experience and investigation??

Is there something inherently incorrect or incongruent, about the shraddhA itself of a devout Sufi's "Islamic" Shraddha" - that we need to differentiate "Vedic" ShraddhA from?
