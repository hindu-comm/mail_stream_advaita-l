If you know that veda-s are eternal and apauruSheya, it is inevitable to
accept that those people or places said in veda were not essentially
existent at any time. If you say that those existed and veda-s were written
after seeing them, it will make your veda-s pauruSheya. Even if you say that
they evolved after veda-s because veda-s are true, then you have to show any
other pramANa for their existence other than veda-s.
So, I think it is better to relate your question to people of history or
purANa.
