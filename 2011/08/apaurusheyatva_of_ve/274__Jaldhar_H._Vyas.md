The alternative which is discussed elsewhere in this thread is that those 
people mentioned are not historical.  After all, the film "Star Wars" 
mentions human relationships but we have no reason to believe people 
called "Luke Skywalker" or "Darth Vader" actually exist.

I think your friend is grabbing at straw men a little.  The idea that the 
Vedas mention animal sacrifices and meat eating is not at all 
controversial to any Vedic scholar I know atleast among the Smartas. 
Vegetarianism is a shishtachara among certain castes and a voluntary tapa 
to others.  The kind of Hindus who get outraged about this are typically 
the revivalist types who don't understand concepts like apaurusheyatva 
anyway.
