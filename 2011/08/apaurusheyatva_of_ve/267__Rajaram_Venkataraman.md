Srila Prabhupada, the founder of ISKCON gives these arguments. "The child
does not know that the fire will burn and perhaps thinks it is something
dazzling. Nevertheless, fire will burn the child if it touches it. If you do
not know the laws of country, that is not an excuse to escape punishment as
per the laws of the country. Like that one cannot say that I dont know the
Vedic laws of karma and commit sins in the name of materialism or sins. The
reaction will nevertheless be there."

The human conscience tells us to speak the truth, not to be violent to other
living beings, be impartial in our judgement, ensure welfare of all living
beings in our dealings, remove suffering and enhance happiness for all etc.
We do not derive our morals from textual sources but from our own inner
voice. Even total atheists have high morals if they listen to their inner
voice. We silence this inner guide to fulfill our desires. In this
endeavour, certain religious texts and interpretations thereof come handy.
Those who are on the path of knowledge wherever they are on the journey will
accept the divine guide. Those who are on the path of destruction will
reject it.
