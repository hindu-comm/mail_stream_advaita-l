PraNAms

While Vidyaji has explained this in clear terms, I am even surprised why there is confusion to start with. The whole creation which we call is Iswara sRiShTi is obviously not purusha tantrain the sense of manushya tantra. The creation includes all that is created including the laws governing all the phenomena in the creation. A scientist only discovers the laws or deduces based on controlled experimentation, but he does invent the laws. That the classical mechanics led later to quantum mechanics is clear indication of the evolution of the human mind in trying to formulate the existing laws governing the phenomenal universe. What is purusha tantra and what is vastu tantra is obvious here. 

PramANa - is the means of knowledge and all the pramANas meant forunderstanding the nature of the reality which isthe truth about the creation. Pratyaksha and anumaanathat is used tounderstand the objectifyable universe and thereforecannotwork forunderstanding of thetruth that transcends cause-effectbound objective world of plurality, which is time-space bound. To know that which is beyond the time and space where no pramANa bounded by the time and space can become avalid means. Vedas become pramANa only for the reason that it points out to the truth that is beyond the other means of knowledge - obviously it is not meant for the knowledge of that which can be known otherwise. That forms the verydefinition of pramANa.The faith that they are unauthored by a human being is indicative of that it is not a knowledge that can be deduced by other means of knowledge or pramANa. It points to the fact that what we are looking far in all
 our pursuits is what we already are. tat tvam asi - is the essential teaching of the Vedas which is passed on by guruparampara, starting from the Lord, himself. It validity comes not that they areapourusheya, per secbut points to the truth that is beyond any other means. Since there is no other means of knowledge to know the absolute truth that transcends the space and time and Vedanta which although operate within the real of time and space, however points the direction that one has to look for to discover that truth. 
The truth is, we are indeed blessed to be born in a culture and tradition to inherit this teaching from the lineage of teachers with all the appropriate commentaries to understand the truth that is being pointed out. Obviously anypramANa becomes a valid pramANa only for those pramANas who can make use of it.Vedanta is no exception. 

Everyone is eligible to know this absolute truth, but only those who are qualified will gain that knowledgeas Krishna emphasizes in the sloka- manushyaanaam sahasreshu... 

In the ultimate analysis - it is not whether one is qualified to study Vedanta or not but whether one is qualified to discover the truth that is being pointed out even when the teacher is ready to teach that truth.

Hari Om!
