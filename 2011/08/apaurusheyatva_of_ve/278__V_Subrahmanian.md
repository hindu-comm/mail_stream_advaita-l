I am reminded of what prevails closer at home:

.In his entire Bhagavat-tatparya-nimaya (*Madhva's* commentary on the
Bhagavata Parana) , for example, *Madhva* *...* says twenty times "those who
hold *Advaitin* views *will go to hell*."

//Andah tamas is linked to avidya. The following Upanishad quote mentions
the link between andah tamas and avidya.

Ishavasya Upanishad 1.1.9

andham tamah pravisanti ye&8217;vidyamupasate

tato bhuya iva te tamo ya u vidyayam ratah 9

andham tamah = relentless, blinding darkness; pravisanti = enter into,
obtain; ye = those who; avidyam = with incorrect understanding, having
failed to grasp correctly; upasate = worship, meditate upon; tatah = and
then, than that; bhuyah = greater; iva = undoubtedly; te = they, those who;
tamah = darkness; ya = who; u = but; vidyayam = proper knowledge; ratah =
engaged in, devoted to.

Those who worship [Visnu or others] with false understanding enter dense,
unrelenting darkness; to a greater darkness than that go they, who are
merely devoted to the correct understanding (but do not care to criticize
incorrect understanding).

We may say, therefore, that &8220;a great responsibility rests with him who
knows; he is bound to teach others, [else] his lot is even worse than those
of the ignorant.&8221; [SCV11]

Not only is it the case that one must condemn false knowledge in order to
avoid the greater suffering that would ensue if one did not, but one must
also do so because the two things, correct understanding and condemnation of
incorrect understanding, each have their own separate result that one should
seek//

According to Madhvas, Advaitins are the ones who hold the incorrect
knowledge and deserve to be condemned.  It is their bounden duty to condemn
Advaita at every opportunity in order to abide by the above quoted Shruti.
