Namaste

In some Sruti they have said Tatra Veda Aveda Bhavanti. In which Sruti
is it?  For Jnani even Vedas become not Vedas not useful. Because he
has realized Brahma.
If you will ask that Jnani are Vedas Paurusheya or Apaureshaya he will
say it is not a relevant question. In some text Sureshwaracharya said
almost same thing.
