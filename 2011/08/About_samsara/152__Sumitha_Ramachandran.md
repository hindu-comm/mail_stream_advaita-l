Subject: Re: [Advaita-l] About samsara
I sincerely think, the REAL & serious sAdhana with the 'teekshNata' 
(intensity) & ( ananyA chinta) for the mOksha is miserably lacking in 
the sAdhana of most of the saMsAri-s like us. I dont know how many of us 
ready to straightaway leave our saMsAra when bhagavan appeared and offered 
us instantaneous mOksha :-)) I dont know when we are going to get that 
REAL vairAgya to do any meaningful sAdhana. 
Just thinking aloud!!
Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
