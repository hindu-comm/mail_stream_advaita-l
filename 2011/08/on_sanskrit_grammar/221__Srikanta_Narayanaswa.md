Sri Srikanta,

Can you explain how cit+AbhAsa becoming cidAbhAsa is guNa sandhi ? Where is the guNa here? As has been pointed out, guNa sandhi can only be ac-sandhi (or svara sandhi) since guNa (by the very second sUtra "ade~N guNa:" in the ashTAdhyAyI) refers to "a,e,o". cit becoming cid is due to "jhalAM jaSonte" which, incidentally, is in the hal-sandhi prakaraNa in the laghu-siddhAnta-kaumudI.

Regards,
Shyam

Here two words make a sanndhi.1)chith+abhasa_chidabhasa,in this word,"abhasa"makes a svara sandhi combining with one "a"and another "a"starting for the word "abhasa'
2)The word chith+abhasa becomes 'Chidabhasa'replacing th with Da which is called 'jasthva sandhi".
N.Srikanta.
