I admit that these questions are somewhat metaphysical and can never be answered to 100% satisfaction. But I also would suggest it is worthwhile to look into them without bringing in the idea that Vedanta tatparya is not in srishti but in ajati. While dealing with questions at the adhyaropa stage, it may be worthwhile to answer such questions as best as possible without jumping to apavada and saying that jagat is mithya, anyway. ( I got thisresponse toofrom some friends, I talked to.)

Thank you

As for the word"ajati"i think this list is far from discussing what is Ajati as you have mentioned.
Thank You,
N.Srikanta.
