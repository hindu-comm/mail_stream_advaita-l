New definitions? I think the conventional definitions are : Chit is awareness (Sacchidananda is existence, awareness and bliss) and Abhasha is glimpse or partial reflection (of the divine awareness). Any comment?

This is with reference to the meaning of the word "Chidabhasa".The word is made of two words,Chth+abhasa.It is called Savarna dirgha sandhi.Actually the word chith means "Mind".Abhasa means not reflection but "distortion" or "aberration",which means it looks as if it is "reflected"or "distorted".
