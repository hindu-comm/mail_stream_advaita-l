This is with reference to the meaning of the word "Chidabhasa".The word is made of two words,Chth+abhasa.It is called Savarna dirgha sandhi.Actually the word chith means "Mind".Abhasa means not reflection but "distortion" or "aberration",which means it looks as if it is "reflected"or "distorted".
N.Srikanta.
