Yes, I too hope incorrect Sanskrit grammar will be avoided on this list! Like it or not, we tend
to use quite a bit of the language here and it behoves our members to acquaint themselves
with its grammar. At the very least, members who want to include a grammatical point in
their posts should proof-read their writing before sending to the list, so as to avoid misleading
other readers.

"savarNa dIrgha sandhi" is not in operation in the word cidAbhAsa, but not merely because
Panini does not use such descriptive labels. savarNa dIrgha refers to the phenomenon where
one short vowel adds to itself and becomes long, e.g. paTTa + abhisheka = paTTAbhisheka.
Here, the first word ends in short "a", the second word begins in short "a" and the resultant
combination is a long "A". Such a phenomenon does not occur in cidAbhAsa, because the
second word in this combination, AbhAsa, itself supplies the long A.

> A gentle pointer to other readers. There is no savaraNadeergha sandhi here. While grammar is not out of bounds on this list, I hope incorrect grammar would be avoided. Panini does not favour descriptive lables like savarNadeergha sandhi, but many pandits say there is something called a saralaadeSasandhi at work here. The names differ across regions, but the effect remains the same: the parusha 't' of chit gets replaced by the sarala 'd'.
