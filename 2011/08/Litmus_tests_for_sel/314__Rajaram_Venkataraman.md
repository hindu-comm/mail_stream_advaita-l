I did not say neurological problem but re-wiring. Some studies in the
military have shown that human beings are capable of dealing with extreme
conditions without being least perturbed.You might have seen buddha boy
documentary on discovery channel http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29clGMWU84 He
goes without food or water for months, recorded live for days.

While I agree that equanimity (FIR Reduction) is a sign of being dependent
on the Self as opposed to external objects, I am asking why it cant be just
neurological rewiring.
