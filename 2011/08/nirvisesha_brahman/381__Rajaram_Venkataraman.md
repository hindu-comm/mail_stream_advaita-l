The term nirguna brahman and saguna brahman are used repeatedly in sastras.
I have heard that the term nirvisesha brahman is also used in the
upanishads. Can someone please point me to that and shankaracharya's
commentary to that? If possible, I would like to know how Ramanuja and
Madhwa comment on the term nirvisesha.
