Please note that Ishvara as the AtmA is nirvisheSha brahman. One cannot say
that Ishvara is kalyANaguNasampanna etc and also say that Ishvara is satya.

Only nirvisheSha brahman, which is the same as the AtmA, is satya. If this
is what one means by Ishvara then Ishvara is satya.

The situation actually is no different from that of the jIva. Just as
jivatvam is mithyA, so is Ishvaratvam. nirvisheSha brahman is the truth of
both jIva and Ishvara and in that sense both jIva and Ishvara (when
understood in terms of their true svarUpa as nirvisheSha brahman) are satya.
