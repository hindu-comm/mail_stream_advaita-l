RV: We cannot assign same level of reality to Isvara, Jiva and Jagat. In the
aprakrta thread, we did see that Isvara's form is not made of material
elements whereas a jiva's is according Sankara and Madhusudana. There is
difference in names and forms in advaita. I hope modern advaita
teachers dont contradict what Madhusudana and Sankara say. If they do, let
us not change advaitam taught by Sankara and Madhusudana due to emotional
attachment to modern advaita teachers.

 I have given clear evidence from Sankara to show that Isvara can be without
any limiting adjuncts and still be Isvara (BG 15.17, BG 14.27). You are not
disagreeing with me but with them. I have also explained that Isvara's
existence is NOT dependent on Maya. His omniscience with respect to creation
is obviously relative. But His omniscience (actually undifferentiated
knowledge or jnapti) is non-relative because all names and form are in
Brahman as Brahman. I am reposting that.

 But the "omniscient Lord" is different from the names and forms. Sankara
asserts, "Different from them is the omniscient Lord himself, as we learn
from scriptural passages such as the following, 'He who is called ether is
the revealer of all forms and names; that within which these forms and names
are contained is Brahman' (Kh. Up. VIII, 14, 1);" This is because all the
names and forms are in Brahman as Brahman.  He is jnapti or undifferentiated
knowledge.
