> I wanted to add this argument. Isvara, in advaita, can be bound, or
> liberated or never bound. He is not bound. If He was bound and now
> liberated, there is a question of who liberated Him. We are only left with
> the third option that He was never bound, which means He is transcendent and
> independent. There cannot be two entities Brahman and Isvara, which are
> independent and transcendent. So Isvara has to be devoid of all limiting
> adjuncts as stated in 15.17. He cannot alternate between liberated and bound
> states. So his upadhi has to be special that it does not bind. Jiva is
> dependent on Isvara when bound. Jagat is dependent on Isvara. So, they dont
> have the same level of reality.
