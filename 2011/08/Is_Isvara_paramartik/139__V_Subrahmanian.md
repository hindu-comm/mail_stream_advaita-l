Swami Paramarthananda would raise this question: Is Ishwara too, then, in
Advaita, mithyA along with everything else?
A very uncomfortable question to answer, indeed.  We would ask a
counter-question: What is your understanding of the concept of 'Ishwara'?
Is He an object like any other thing in the world or the very subject of the
questioner?  If it is the former, without any hesitation we would say, 'Yes,
such an object called Ishwara is also mithyA'.  If on the other hand you
hold Ishwara is the very subject, non-different from the Self, then, thank
God !  Ishwara is saved: He is satyam.
