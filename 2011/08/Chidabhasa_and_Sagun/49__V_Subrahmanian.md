Swami Paramarthananda  Saraswati known to be an excellent exponent of
Vedanta for the last three decades presents the above concept thus:

There is one Original Consciousness (OC).
This OC gets reflected in six reflecting mediums (media) RMs
By virtue of the presence of these RMs, we have six reflected
Consciousness(s) RCs

The Mandukya scheme is very helpful in understanding this.  There are three
states and we have a SamaShTi upAdhi and a vyaShTi upAdhi in each state
called the macrocosm and the microcosm respectively.  These are:

Waking: virAT and vishva
Dream: Hiranyagarbha and taijasa
Sleep: Ishwara and prAjna

All these 'six' are conscious entities and as such are endowed with a
reflecting medium RM each.  Hence we have six RCs making these entities
conscious ones.  In this way all the six have/are chidaabhasa-s.  They are
and have to be conscious entities because they have their respective worlds
in those three states for experiencing, abhimAna.  Thus, these RCs are the
viShayi-s and the respective inert worlds in those states are the
viShaya-s.

It should also be remembered that in the ultimate analysis there is only one
Consciousness, OC which alone gets reflected in the available RMs and
'becomes' RCs.  When the upAdhis are negated by the understanding gained by
the study of the upanishad that teaches the first three paada-s and the
Fourth, Turiya, pAda, by the words 'nAnataH prajnam......prapanchopashamam'
one realizes that there is only one Consciousness that appeared as these
very many vyashti and samashti chidAbhAsas and the inert world.
