Well to be fair, I don't think this is what those who make the scientific 
analogy are claiming.  The point is Newton didn't "invent" gravity but 
only pointed out and described something which was already there and would 
have continued to be there even if a 17th century Christian Englishman 
named Isaac Newton had never existed.  In the same way, Rshis "saw" the 
mantras.  They did not create them.

The converse of this is also true.  As the Vedas talk only of dharma and 
moksha, you cannot mine them for "historical" or "scientific" 
knowledge as our modern bandhus are wont to do.

You are falling into the error of assuming that Vedas only refers to the 
mantras and brahmanas.  Because the smrtis, Puranas and Mahabharata, 
Ramayana etc. are based on the Vedas they too are "Vedic".  They too 
contain injunctions, knowledge etc. which can be analyzed by Mimamsaka or 
Vedantic means.  While they too are often restricted in various ways, some 
of them are also of universal validity.  Shistachara because it is the 
conduct of the knowers of the Vedas is also "Vedic" and shista are capable 
of communicating Vedic concepts to non-Hindus.

This is a false dilemmna.  What is being asked is to follow the Vedic 
injunctions as well as possible.  And if anything, the modern world makes 
it more possible than the "good old days".
