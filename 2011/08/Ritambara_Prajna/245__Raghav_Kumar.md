Namaste Sriram ji
Thank you for your explanation of the connection between gAyatrI and
RtambharA prajnA. My doubt is that you have included "ordinary ...vedanta
jnana" as inferior to the insight offered by the RtambharA prajnA. This is
quite interesting. Could you elaborate on the difference between "ordinary
vedantic jnana" and the deeper subtler jnanam born of RtambharA prajnA ? My
personal view is that what you said makes perfect sense. But can we justify
the idea of Patanjali's idea of RtambharA prajnA as being crucial in
attaining to true mahavAkya jnAnam in the more orthodox vedantic tradition?
Has any of the later Acharyas in the Shankara-paramparA also talked in a
similar vein? (Given the fact that nirvikalpaka samadhi is not given such a
great status in the vedantic tradition as in Yoga.)

Thank you
Raghav
