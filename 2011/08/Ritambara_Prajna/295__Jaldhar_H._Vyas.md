I wasn't refering to the principle of paurusheyatva.

Yes because it is based on and consonant with the teachings of the Vedas. 
(The second qualifier is necessary because the smrtis of samkhya and Yoga 
are also based on the Vedas but do not accurately reflect their teaching. 
See the bhashya on B.S. 2.1.1-3)

I do not deny that Yoga is useful and practical.  Only that it is 
necessary.

The very last brahmasutra anAvR^itti shabdAt (it is repeated twice because 
it is last.) says those who pass along the devAyana (by due dilligence in 
karmayoga) do not return to saMsAra at all.  This is what the Gita teaches 
as well.
