Namaste,

It requires a pure & untainted intellect to understand
sAstra pratipAdya tattva. 

This “untainted” intellect that is “free from perversions” 
which is capable of understanding cosmic law is 
called “ritaMbarA prajna”.

Upasana of Gayatri Mantra bestows this “untainted”
Intelligence and intuition that is free from 
perversions. With the help of this “ritambarA prajna”,
the sAdhaka moves ahead in the path of spirituality.

One of the sUtrAs of Patanjali while describing
this ritambarA prajna states that:

“shrautAnumAnaprajnAbhyAM sAmAnya viShayA 
vishEShArthatvAt”

With the help of this ritaMbarA prajna, the sAdhaka
is able to grasp subtle aspects of the sAstra
and is able to contemplate on the essence of the
sAstra. This ritaMbarA prajna (untainted 
intelligence free from perversions) is 
more refined than ordinary intellect which is capable of penetrating 
into the divine secrets of nature and unravels the mysteries. 

This ritaMbarA prajna is highly superior than
the “shruti” prajna & “anumAna” prajna. 
Shruti prajna is related to ordinary vaidika / 
vedanta jnAna and anumAna is related to
the nyAya. 

It is this ritaMbarA prajna which is 
instrumental in turning the sAdhakA’s
mind “inwards” for introspection. 
and bestows “antarmukha sthiti”

It is this “ritaMbarA prajnA” 
we are seeking from Mother Gayatri. 

These are the words of my guruji as well as
a great gAyatri upAsaka & shatAvadhAni of 
Andhra Pradesh Brahmasri Veluri Sivarama Sastry.

Regs,
Sriram
