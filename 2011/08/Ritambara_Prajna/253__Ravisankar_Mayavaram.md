In the context of mahaavaakya-s, it is the vivaraNa school that refutes
prasankhyAna vAda. However, I think this should be OK from the point of view
of bhAmati. Of these, vivaraNa emphasizes on shravaNa as the means and
bhamati emphasizes nididhyAsana - there comes the difference.  May be,
prasankhyAna vAdins can use something like R^itambhara pra~jna as their
defense, as it produces "shrutAnumAna pra~jnAbhyAm anya viShaya
visheShaarthatvAt"
