Namaste Sri Vidyasankara

This is my last response on this kindly excuse me. I got one final
reference from my friend to prove both you and Sri Saxena are totally
wrongly interpreting Adi Sankara and Sureshwara also.
Kindly see the Dvivedaganga Dipika of Bruhadaranyaka 6-4-18. He is
saying clearly-
अयं तु मांसनियमो देशकालविशेषापेक्षया अवगन्तव्यः गोमांसस्य
निषिद्धत्वात् कृष्णमृगविषयं छागविषयं वा उक्षादिवचनमत्र ग्राह्यम् He is
saying this Bull meat eating rule of 6-4-18 must be understood
depending on Desha Place and Kala Time. Because Beef is prohibited
meat we have to take Uksha and Rishabha in 6-4-18 as Black Deer or
Goat Meat.
तन्मांसमपि अनुपहृतं क्रीत्वा संपाद्यं हिंसायाः प्रतिषिद्धत्वात् He is
saying even that Black Deer Meat or Goat Meat  he must get by
purchasing but not killing the animal because killing  is prohibited.

This is the correct interpretation for 6-4-18 and Adi Sankara Bhashya
and Vartika also.  It is  unfortunate both of you miss the point by
twisting the texts. Others like Sri Bhaskar and Sri Sarma are blindly
following your side.
