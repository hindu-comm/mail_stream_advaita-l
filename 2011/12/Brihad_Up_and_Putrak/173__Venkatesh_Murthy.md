About 6-4-18 I said on Nov 21 - एवं पूर्वं आचार आसीत् । किंतु कलियुगे
वृषभमांसस्थाने छागमांसं
प्रयुज्यते । गोमांसस्य सर्वत्र निषिद्धत्वात् ।

Many times I tried to convince the people here we have to substitute
Bull meat by Goat meat today because  Beef is prohibited  but they
were adamantly refusing to listen. Now you have posted from
Sureshwara's Vartika it will be easy for them to accept the same
coming from him. Thank you. But for Brahmins in South India even Goat
meat outside Yajnas is prohibited. They will do substitution of Goat
meat also and take vegetarian meal only. North Indians may still eat
meat.
