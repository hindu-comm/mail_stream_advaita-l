Because they were engaged in a different conversation than the one you 
seem to be in.  There will be no outbreak of beef eating because the 
putramantha brAhmaNa was discussed on advaita-l.

LOL so what happened to "A Sannyasin writing details of Yajnas is not the 
correct authority"?  Look, your heart is in the right place but you cannot

defend dharma effectively.  If you don't know the correct methods of 
interpretation, it is better to concentrate on learning them and leave 
this topic alone.
