Namaste Sri Bhattacharya

Kindly look into the archives of messages. You will see how people
were giving references from Mahabharata and other books about cow
sacrifices. You will see how people were saying Yajnavalkya finds
eating tender beef is fine. You will see how people are saying Adi
Sankara is saying Bull meat is required for ritual in 6-4-18 and Bull
meat cannot be substituted by other things. You will see how people
are saying eating veal by pregnant woman is fine. All these statements
are cancelled by Sureshwara's Vartika and our Dharma Sastra texts like
Parashara Smruti.

But you are wrong about Chaga Mamsa. Non Brahmins are allowed to eat
it today. In Yajnas  Brahmins also can sacrifice the Goat and eat it.
But even in Yajnas some Brahmins will not use Goat meat but use Goat
made of flour.

> That is wrong. No meat is to be sacrificed at all, not even the Chagamamsa in the Kali yuga, as nobody should entertain the hope of making a child master all the Vedas in this age after Vedavyasa separated the four Vedas, considering the fact it would not be possible for one to master all the Vedas. May be Adi Sankaracharya, the incarnation of Lord Shiva, was the only person to do that in the Kali yuga. Moreover you have to consider a sizable portion of the veda has been lost due to the vagaries of time in the Kali yuga. So the question cannot arise about teaching all the Vedas.
