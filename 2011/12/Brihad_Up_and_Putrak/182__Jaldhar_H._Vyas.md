Then you have probably not seen the message from the admins closing this 
thread.  Well anyway while we are here let me make some observations.  I 
request that anyone responding please stick to the texts under discussion 
and not go off on wild tangents about eating or not eating beef etc.

It is not clear that the upanishad in question is the bR^ihadAraNyaka. 
Apart from being in the wrong shakha, the bR^ihadaAraNyaka names these 
vidhis, shrImantha and putramantha -- terms which are not used by 
ashvalAyana.  nArAyaNa the commentator on ashvalAyana also does not make 
the connection.  On the other hand sAyaNAchArya commenting on the 
madhyandina version of the text does equate it with garbhAdhAnam, 
soShyantikarma, jAtakarma, AyuShyakaraNa and stanyapradAna, in other words 
the full range of saMskAras for an infant.  Thus it would seem to be a fit 
topic for gR^ihyasUtras.

Nowadays puMsavana saMskAra is performed perfunctorily if at all but the 
method specified in the shuklayajurveda prayogas seems nearer to that in 
the bR^i U. (where nearer means not very near) than the method described 
above.

I shall write separately about this.
