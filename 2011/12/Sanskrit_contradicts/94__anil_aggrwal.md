Dear fellow virtual Advaitins,



I have found two opposing translations of Bhagavad Gita VII,24. I am not a
Sanskritist and would appreciate some philological insightsufficient to
humble a BhaktiVedanta devotee in the airport.


"Those who lack discrimination, not knowing my limitless,changeless nature
beyond which there is nothing greater, look upon me who isformless as one
endowed with a manifest form. " -Swami Dayananda


"The unintelligent, unaware of My supreme state which isimmutable and
unsurpassable, think of Me as the unmanifest that has becomemanifest. "
-Swami Gambhirananda


At your collective feet,
MichaelChandra Shekar Cohen
