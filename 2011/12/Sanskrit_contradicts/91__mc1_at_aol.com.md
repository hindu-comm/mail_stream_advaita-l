Dear fellow virtual Advaitins,



I have found two opposing translations of Bhagavad Gita VII,24. I am not a Sanskritist and would appreciate some philological insightsufficient to humble a BhaktiVedanta devotee in the airport.


“Those who lack discrimination, not knowing my limitless,changeless nature beyond which there is nothing greater, look upon me who isformless as one endowed with a manifest form. “ –Swami Dayananda


“The unintelligent, unaware of My supreme state which isimmutable and unsurpassable, think of Me as the unmanifest that has becomemanifest. “ –Swami Gambhirananda


At your collective feet,
MichaelChandra Shekar Cohen
