This is the Iskcon message very efficiently delivered. But we have to
see Sistachara. 

praNAms Sri Venkatesh prabhuji
Hare Krishna

Kindly pardon me prabhuji, it is not ISKCON slogan!!  it is a quote you 
can find in manu or parashara smruti.  Though adhyAtmika sAdhana in the 
form of nAma saMkeertana has been propagated mainly by ISKCON, the greats 
like chaitanya mahAprabhu, gOndAvaLi brahma chaitanya maharaj, 
bodhAnandendra saraswati etc. have insisted this mArga for the kaliyuga. 
And you can find reference with regard to efficacy of nAma smaraNa in 
minor upanishads as well such as kalishAntaraNa.  So, nAma smaraNa 
sAdhaka-s have every good reason to believe that in kaliyuga mOksha mArga 
in only nAma smaraNa & nAma saMkeertana.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
