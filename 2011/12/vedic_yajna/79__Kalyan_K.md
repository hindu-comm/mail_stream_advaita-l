Bhaskar-ji,

Please rest assured that my feelings are not hurt in any way. I also want
to apologize to you for my over eagerness to prove you wrong.

I would like to thank you and Venkatesh-ji and other learned members for
this interesting discussion. The good thing is that this discussion helped
me increase my knowledge about of our vedas.

Bowing to the moderator's wishes, I am no longer posting on this thread.

Regards
Kalyan
