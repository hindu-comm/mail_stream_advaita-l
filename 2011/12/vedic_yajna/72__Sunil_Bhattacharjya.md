Shri Venkateshji,

The very statement that Adi Sankaracharya was asking us to eat beef appears to be malicious. Neither Adi Sankaracharya nor the Brihadaranyaka upanishad gave a general licence to eat beef. One must remember at all times that exceptions don't make a rule. None can plan to have a child, whom one can send to four different schools of Veda. Adi Sankaracharya also knew that one school has to specialize in one Veda. Each of the four mathas established by him was to specialize in teaching one Veda, though there may be scholars in these maths, who may specialize in more than one Veda.

Then coming to Parashara Smriti it cannot surpass the authority of the Vedas. It is said that if there is a conflict between the Shruti and Smriti, the views of Shruti prevails and we have to keep this mind. To my knowledge Madhava did not say that Shruti cannot be brought in because Parashara Smfriti made a statement.

Regards,

Sunil KB

Parashara Smruti was there in Adi Sankara's time. This is why I am
saying when Sankara Bhashya is saying a man has to eat Bull meat in
6-4-18 we have to take the meaning properly after looking at Parashara
Smruti, Katyayana Srauta Sutra, Sathapatha Brahmana and other books
also. It is not correct to take the direct meaning of the Upanishad
Vakya or Sankara Vakya. Madhava knew about Adi Sankara and he has
still written commentary on Parashara Smruti. If he is thinking Adi
Sankara is asking us to eat Bull meat why is he writing Beef is
prohibited? We have to consider all this information instead of
jumping to conclusion Bull meat is recommended in 6-4-18.
