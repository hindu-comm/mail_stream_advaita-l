I am not a fan of Venkatesh Murthys bizarre line of argument to put it 
mildly and I'm going to respond to it at length over the weekend but you 
are misrepresenting him by ascribing to him a view he is actually arguing 
against and in a foul-mouthed way unbecoming to the decorum of this list. 
Stop it.

Even more unforgivingly, you are not clearly explaining your own thoughts. 
What is the source of morality (such as ahimsa) if not the shastras? 
Since when does one need the sanction of a book to eat meat?  I bet you 
walk past McDonalds and Burger Kings all the time.  Do you think the Vedas 
are consulted by the patrons of such establishments?
