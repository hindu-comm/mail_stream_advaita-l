Dear friend ,

You are sadly mistaken when you said as follows:

Quote
We can bring down any one for that matter, How about Lord Krishna?
You forget about Krishna Lila, dont you? (30,000 wives)
Trckeries used by Krishna to win the war, motivating Arjuna to kill
his own kith and kin.

Unquote

Lord Krishna had nine wives and those nine wanted to marry Lord Krishna of their own accord.

Secondly Lord Krishna married the 11,000 women, whom he had to rescue from captivity under Narakasura. This he did at the behest of Narakasura's mother so that these women could get social status and not get kicked around like women from king's harem.

Hope this clarifies,

Sincerely,

Sunil KB

You are pathetic. I was resisting myself not to respond to your "Bull
crap" e-mail. Now I lost it.

Shame on you to disgrace Mahatma Ghandi and call yourself a spiritual
seeker (since you are in this list, I assume you are a spiritual
seeker)

We can bring down any one for that matter, How about Lord Krishna?
You forget about Krishna Lila, dont you? (30,000 wives)
Trckeries used by Krishna to win the war, motivating Arjuna to kill
his own kith and kin.

Ofcourse you are against Ahimsa as you will kill and eat any crap for
a son if it is listed in Vedas or whatever religious book.
