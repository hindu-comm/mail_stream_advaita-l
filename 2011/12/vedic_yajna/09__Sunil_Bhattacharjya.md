Dear Bhaskarji and Venkateshji,

That is why the shruti says that Shruti likes the paroksha (indirect or deduced) interpretation of its verses. Moreover one has to take the help of the Fifth Veda to really understand the meaning of Veda. Unfortunately today's Vedic experts do not pay attnetion to the exhortaion in the Mahabharata that the Vedas are afraid of one not well-versed in the Puranas and the Itihasas.

Regards,

Sunil KB

Then you have agreed we cannot follow everything said by Sruti today.
Some Sruti Vakyas on Dharma will not be correct in some Yuga, Desha or
Kala. Why is this? Dharma depends on Yuga, Desha and Kala. How do you
know what is the Dharma for your time? Look at Sistas. Follow them.
This is also said in the Taittiriya Upanishad.
