RV: I understand the administrative constraint. The lesson learnt is
one has to be extremely careful about what is written as much as what
is spoken.

The essential conclusion of discussion with Shri Mani Dravid Sastrigal
that I can share is "Cow cannot be killed". For details on each point
raised here, I request the interested members to contact him directly.
He is available in person, over e-mail and phone.
