Kindly write something about Bruhadaranyaka 6-4-7 asking a man to
strike his wife with a stick. Do you feel we can take direct meaning
of Sruti and do it? Is it proper conduct today? If it is not proper
conduct what is the hidden meaning of the Sruti Vakya? Do you not feel
today we have to take a modified meaning of the Vakya like scolding
his wife instead of striking her? In earlier days the teachers  used
to beat kids in school. Nowadays they are only scolding but not
beating. If they hit kids parents will quarrel with the teachers.
