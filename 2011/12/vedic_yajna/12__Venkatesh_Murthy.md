The named Sistas will not ask anybody with any qualification like
knowing Vedas with desire to have learned son to eat Beef under any
circumstance. This is first point. Second point is what is wrong if we
follow Nirnaya Sindhu prohibition of Beef for all irrespective of the
Varna, qualification, desire and other things. It is like Samanya
Dharma in Kali Yuga. Nobody can eat Beaf in this age. It is simple. It
applies to all. Kindly say if there is something wrong in this. Why
should we not simply accept Nirnaya Sindhu prohibition instead of
finding some escape from  Sruti Vakya asking to eat Bull meat?  You
are trying to find escape exit from Sruti Vakyas asking to do
prohibited things in our times. I am saying take a simple approach
because books like Nirnaya Sindhu are guiding us. I will show how you
are trying for escape exit now.

In the case of Bull meat Sruti may be saying if you have such and such
qualification and such and such desire to have learned son and such
and such conditions are satisfied you should eat Bull meat with rice
and other ingredients. But Nirnaya Sindhu is saying don't eat Beef
under any circumstances irrespective of who you are your
qualifications, desires, and any conditions. You are looking at Sruti
Vakya and finding escape exit saying if I don't have the desire I
don't have to eat Bull meat. I will not eat it.  But I am saying
looking at Nirnaya Sindhu I will not eat Beef. The result for both is
the same for this case but the reason given is different. It is
strange we have to find escape exit when important books like Nirnaya
Sindhu are available to help.

Above point applies in this case also. Why take escape exit? There is
a direct way. Respect the law of the country.

But what is position of Dharma Sastra books like Nirnaya Sindhu in
your opinion? You think they cannot prohibit things not prohibited by
Sruti? Kindly answer this.
