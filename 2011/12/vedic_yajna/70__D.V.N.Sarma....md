Sri Venkateshji has written

>What happens to Sruti and Smruti Vakyas appearing to allow beef also
>Sankara Bhashya 6-4-18? There we have to take the indirect meaning
>only not the direct meaning respecting Dharma Sastra.

Were these Dharmasastras written before Sankar's commentary or after
he has written his commentary? Do not forget that Sankara was born well
after
Kali age has started. Madhava's commentary on Parasara Smriti is written
hundreds of years after Sankara.
