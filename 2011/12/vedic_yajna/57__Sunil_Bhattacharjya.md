Dear Bhaskarji,

In a way you are right. There is a belief that if meat is offered to one he or she need not refuse it as the dead animal may feel bad that one hates its meat. So the best course is to eat the meat and pray for the good of the soul of the animal, which had sacrificed its life. Lord Buddha allowed the monks to eat meat when offered but the the monk should not eat the meat if the animal is sacrificed for him nor he should see the animal being killed nor he should hear its death-cry. However Manu says that meat has to be of the permissible type. There is also the understanding that one should not eat the meat of the carnivorous animal as that animal may want to eat one's meat in the next birth.

The views of Manu as given in Manusmriti (5 / 35) : When a man who is properly engaged in a ritual 
does not eat meat, after his death he will become a sacrificial animal during twenty-one rebirths, may be a corollary of this. 


Regards,

Sunil KB

One of my cybernet friends (ofcourse a strict shAkhAhAri like me :-)) 
yesterday sent me the following piece of information from various sources 
picking from some website. I have neither patience nor interest to know 
the credentials of this quote (except shankara's quote in bruhadAraNyaka 
and yAjnAvalkya's food preference which I heard earlier also:-))...But 
anyone interested please check the quotes.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!

Manusmriti (Chapter 5 / Verse 30) says, “It is not sinful to eat meat of 
eatable animals, for Brahma has created both the eaters and the 
eatables.” 

Manusmriti (5 / 35) states: When a man who is properly engaged in a ritual 
does not eat meat, after his death he will become a sacrificial animal 
during twenty-one rebirths. 

Maharishi Yagyavalkya says in Shatpath Brahmin (3/1/2/21) that, “I eat 
beef because it is very soft and delicious.” 

Apastamb Grihsutram (1/3/10) says, “The cow should be slaughtered on the 
arrival of a guest, on the occasion of ‘Shraddha’ of ancestors and on the 
occasion of a marriage.” 

Rigveda (10/85/13) declares, “On the occasion of a girl’s marriage oxen 
and cows are slaughtered.” 

Rigveda (6/17/1) states that “Indra used to eat the meat of cow, calf, 
horse and buffalo.” 

Vashistha Dharmasutra (11/34) writes, “If a Brahmin refuses to eat the 
meat offered to him on the occasion of ‘Shraddha’ or worship, he goes to 
hell.”

Also, comments of some great scholars of Hinduism are also worth noting:
· Hinduism’s greatest propagator Swami Vivekanand said thus: “You will be 
surprised to know that according to ancient Hindu rites and rituals, a man 
cannot be a good Hindu who does not eat beef”. (The Complete Works of 
Swami Vivekanand, vol.3, p. 536).


· Mukandilal writes in his book ‘Cow Slaughter – Horns of a Dilemma’, page 
18: “In ancient India, cow-slaughter was considered auspicious on the 
occasions of some ceremonies. Bride and groom used to sit on the hide of a 
red ox in front of the ‘Vedi’ (alter).”


· A renowned scholar of scriptures Dr. Pandurang Vaman Kane says, 
“Bajsancyi Samhita sanctifies beef-eating because of its purity”. 
(Dharmashastra Vichar Marathi, page 180)


· Adi Shankaracharya’ commentary on Brihdaranyakopanishad 6/4/18 says : 
‘Odan’ (rice) mixed with meat is called ‘Mansodan’. On being asked whose 
meat it should be, he answers ‘Uksha’. ‘Uksha’ is used for an ox, which is 
capable to produce semen.


· The book ‘The History and Culture of the Indian People’, published by 
Bhartiya Vidya Bhawan, Bombay and edited by renowned historian 
R.C.Majumdar (Vol.2, page 578) says: “this is said in the Mahabharat that 
King Rantidev used to kill two thousand other animals in addition to two 
thousand cows daily in order to give their meat in charity”.
