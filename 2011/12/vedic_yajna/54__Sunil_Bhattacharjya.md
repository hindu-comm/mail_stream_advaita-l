Dear Venkatesh Murthyji,

You said
Quote
Parashara Smruti has prohibited cow killing in any and all forms in
Kali Yuga. We have to obey it. Simple. It does not matter if 100
Srutis and Smrutis are inviting you to taste beef. They are all wrong
in Kali Yuga.
You have given Mahabharata references. How many things in Mahabharata
we are following? Draupadi had five husbands and Arjuna had multiple
wives. Are we following this system? Why do we want to follow only
beef eating system?
Unquote

You got emotional and got it all wrong. Nobody here is advocating cow-killing nor is advising anybody to eat beef . I do not eat beef myself but I do not condemn what was written in the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad, as that had an exceptionally special purpose, valid only for those times.

Regards,

Sunil KB

Namaste

Anybody can give references from Vedas, Manu Smruti and other places
but the opposing camp can also give a lot of references contradicting
that. If some people give references to prove meat eating and another
group gives references to avoid meat eating, especially beef what can
we do? The wise man must know how to solve the contradictions but the
fool gets confused with all the references. The big challenge is How
do you do Samanvaya of all the statements from Sruti and other
Sastras. As a matter of fact this Samanvaya is the heart of the
solution. This is why the first Adhyaya in Brahma Sutras is named
Samanvaya Adhyaya. There is one whole chapter to do only Samanvaya.

When two or more Sruti Vakyas are clashing against each other we have
to consult Smruti to see how it has solved it. But if two or more
Smrutis are also clashing what can we do? The wise man will look at
the Smruti that is most powerful in that Yuga when he is living. In
Vaidyanatha Dikshitiya it is said the most powerful Dharma Sastra book
in Kruta Yuga is Manu Smruti. In Treta Yuga it is Gautama Smruti. In
Dwapara Yuga it is Shankha Likhita Smruti but in Kali Yuga it is
Parashara Smruti.

Parashara Smruti has prohibited cow killing in any and all forms in
Kali Yuga. We have to obey it. Simple. It does not matter if 100
Srutis and Smrutis are inviting you to taste beef. They are all wrong
in Kali Yuga.

You have given Mahabharata references. How many things in Mahabharata

Another problem with strict vegetarian but accepting meat eating is
big one. If you are not convinced meat eating is prohibited but think
it is allowed what will you tell your children? They may come and say
'I want to eat meat'. You will tell them 'Meat eating is not bad. It
is allowed in our books. But you should be vegetarian like me. Don't
eat'. Will they get convinced?
