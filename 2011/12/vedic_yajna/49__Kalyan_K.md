Namaste Venkatesh-ji,

>Some kinds of animals were used in sacrifices in earlier Yugas but not
>cows.

I am not aware of cow-sacrifice, but killing of cows is explicitly
prohibited in Rig Veda 8.101.15

RV 8.101.15  Translation by Wilson (in the context of saayaNa bhashya) -

"(she who is) the mother of the rudras, the daughter of the vasus, the
sister of the adityas,
the home of ambrosia - kill not her, the sinless inviolate cow"

Lest there should be any doubt, saayaNachArya mentions that the deity of
this verse is the cow. So this is not referring to any other devata.
Further, just for info, the rishi is Jamadagni of the family of Bhrigu.

Also, here is the translation of Ralph Griffith for cross-reference -

"The Rudras' Mother, Daughter of the Vasus, centre of nectar, the Ādityas’
Sister-
To folk who understand will 1 proclaim it-injure not Aditi, the Cow, the
sinless"

And just to add - The Rig Veda also extols the cow at many places.

I have also referred to the Nighantu and Yaska's Nirukta. It clearly
mentions that the cow is called Aghanya because it is not to be killed.
yAska, is supposed to have preceded even pANini, and his nirukta commentary
on the nighantu can be considered to be the best existing authority on
matters of interpreting vedic words.

Best Regards
Kalyan
