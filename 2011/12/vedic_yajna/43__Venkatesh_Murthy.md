Namaste

The Cow Dung is used in preparation of 'Pancha Gavya'. It is a mixture
of Cow Urine, Cow Dung, Cow Milk, Curds and Ghee, and also Kushodaka.
The best of Brahmins drink this Pancha Gavya to burn all the sins. Cow
Dung called as Bull crap by westerners is sacred to us.

They say the only unclean part of a cow is the mouth. That is why we
should do Puja to the hind part not the front.
