As the one who started this post, I request that the entire thread be
removed from the forum. I had a long discussion with Shri Mani Dravid
Sastrigal and am quite clear on the topic. I am concerned that my post
has lead to so many dangerously wrong views being aired in this forum.
I will be obliged to the moderators if my request is favourably
considered. Hare Krishna.
