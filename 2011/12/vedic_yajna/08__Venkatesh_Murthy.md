Namaste

I am sorry for statement on Adi Sankara but it was misunderstood. I
always said he is greatest authority in Vedanta. There is no doubt
about it. I also said his statement on 6-4-18 has to be taken in
indirect meaning not direct meaning keep respect for Desha and Kala
Dharma. Same for Sruti Vakya. Adi Sankara's Vakya is same as Sruti
Vakya. There is no difference. That is all.
