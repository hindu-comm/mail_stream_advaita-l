Dear Shri Rajaram,

All the participants in the thread as also the silent readers are anxious to know the reply given by Sastrigal. At the start of the thread you had requested participation from all knowledgeable members, and I think it would be fair to share the knowledge you gained from Sastrigal in detail.

Of course, if the Sastrigal has exhorted you not to give his opinion in open forum or some other restrictions, it would be the correct thing to be quiet.

Regards,

narayan.

Dear Shri Venkatesh, you were and are right that cow should not be
killed. I suggest you leave it at that instead of using Satrigal's
words to silence others. What if you were also wrong on many details?

I dont think that there is a beef appreciation group here. They were
only sharing the textual evidence in support of beef in ancient India
and rituals. I thank them for that because it enabled a meaningful
enquiry.

If someone is interested in the details, let he or she enquire
directly from Sastrigal. I am neither allowed to nor adept enough to
share the contents.

Unfortunately, I started this thread without anticipating the
consequences and hope it ends sooner than later as it cannot be
removed.
