Namaste

There is one Katyayana Srauta Sutra saying Dhenvanaduhayornashniyat
the cow and bull must not be eaten by anyone. It is supporting the
Sathapatha Brahmana para you have referred.

The two are from same Sukla Yajur Veda of Brihadaranyaka Upanishad
with Sankara Bhashya. We have to take Sankara Bhashya 6-4-18 with
Sathapatha Brahmana and Katyayana Srauta Sutra and then give its
meaning. It cannot be a man desiring a learned son must eat bull meat
for it like the English translation is saying. Then there will be no
meaning in Sathapatha Brahmana and Katyayana Srauta Sutra. Bull meat
in 6-4-18 is not Bull meat but something like Bull meat. This can be
vegetarian material for Brahmins and goat meat for others allowed to
eat meat.
