Namaste Venkateshji,

Why are you silencing yourself and not telling us how Shastrigal condemned the views expressed by the various members here on the verses given in the Brihadaranyaka upanishad?

Namaste

I feel good Sri Sastri has given the opinion 'Cow cannot be killed'.
It will silence the Beef Appreciation Group we have here. What is he
saying about Sankara Bhashya 6-4-18 on Uksha and Rishabha? It is
definitely relevant for this list because it is for discussing Sankara
Bhashyas. The moderators can take a decision.
