Namaste Sri Kalyan

Atharvana Veda Mantra 1/16/4 has said cow killing is same as man
killing as horse killing.

Yadi No Gam Hamsi Yadyashvam Yadi Purusham |
Tam Tva Sesena Vidhyamo Yatha No So Aveeraha ||

This Mantra is warning a person if he kills a cow or horse or man they
will shoot lead bullets at him as punishment. Then he cannot kill our
sons.

Important point- Killing a cow is equal to killing a man and horse
killing  is also equal to killing a man.

Aveeraha means 'Not killer of Veeras.' Veera is a son because he is
born from Veerya that is sperm.
