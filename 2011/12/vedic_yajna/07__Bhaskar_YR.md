praNAms Sri Venkatesh prabhuji

Though I am not able to read the contents of above link, it seems you are 
telling us that 'mahAtma' gAndhi was a sex maniac hence he is not an 
authority to teach anything on shishtAcharaNa.  And you have already 
discarded bhagavatpAda due to his non-exposure to 
saMsAra/gruhastAshrama..So, according to this,  even our present day 
Amnaya peetAdhipati-s and rAghaveshAnanda swamiji too are not eligible to 
suggest / comment anything about shAstra vAkya with regard to sex & 
related matters.  So, prabhuji, I am just curious to know who is that 
shreshTa/shishta according to you who can adjudicate this issue without 
any controversy?? 

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
