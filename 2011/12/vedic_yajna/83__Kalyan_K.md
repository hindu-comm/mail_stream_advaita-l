Namaste Sunil-ji,


Thanks for responding. While on the subject, I think Yagnavalkya, being a
brahma-jnani, the normal vedic rules/injunctions do not necessarily apply
to him.

Regards
Kalyan

Dear Kalyanji,

>You might have missed my mail sent quite early in the discussions as to what Bhishma told in the Mahabharata. Cow-sacrifice is not endorsed in the Veda. The mention of the >meat of calf / bull in the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad is also to be interpreted as a very special case applicable for a very special purpose and there too there is a paroks>ha interpretation and the Vedas say that. One should not lose sight of the fact no cow (male of female of the species was offered in a sacrifice, even Vedas prefer paroksh>a interpretation. One should not lose sight of this fact, even if if one discusses about the practice  of eating beef by the ancient rishis.
