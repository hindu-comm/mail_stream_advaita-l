As part of the saprayoga shAnti chandrikA, a manual of shAnti karmas,
there is a putra-kAmeShTi ritual described for R^ig Vedins. The
pradhAna deities of this homa are agni,varuNa, Vishnu, soma, and
sUrya. The dravya or material used for the offerings is pAyasa-charu.
There are 15 offerings in all to the various deities and the
hutasheSha (remnants of the offerings) is consumed by the couple
desiring a child.

Obviously, this ritual is different from the one described in the
BrihadAraNyaka upaniShad.
