This thread does not have a chance of ending. Even in the face all the
evidence
that vadic rishis were meat eaters ( including beef) and did animal
sacrifices,
they will go on insisting that it is not so. Sometimes they see there are
conspiracies out to malign their extraordinarily pure(!?) and hygienic
religion.
(Every one of these has his own conception what that pure hindu religion
is.)
While the popular culprits are western indologists, lately even the hindu
skeptics
are severely condemned as polluted with western ideas and
psuedointellectualism.
