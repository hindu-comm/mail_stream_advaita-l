Parashara Smruti was there in Adi Sankara's time. This is why I am
saying when Sankara Bhashya is saying a man has to eat Bull meat in
6-4-18 we have to take the meaning properly after looking at Parashara
Smruti, Katyayana Srauta Sutra, Sathapatha Brahmana and other books
also. It is not correct to take the direct meaning of the Upanishad
Vakya or Sankara Vakya. Madhava knew about Adi Sankara and he has
still written commentary on Parashara Smruti. If he is thinking Adi
Sankara is asking us to eat Bull meat why is he writing Beef is
prohibited? We have to consider all this information instead of
jumping to conclusion Bull meat is recommended in 6-4-18.
