I am not interested in what happened in earlier Yugas. What is our
duty now in this Yuga? This is important. In earlier Yugas animals may
have been sacrificed. I have not done a deep study. I cannot say if
that is correct or a corruption of Sastras like Haridas Sastry says. I
am not qualified to make a judgement on that. But I understand Smrutis
are prohibiting such sacrifices in this Yuga very clearly. The Veda
Vakyas talking animal sacrifices must be revised for our Yuga after
studying the Smrutis. I am not saying we should revise Sruti Vakyas in
any way we think. The revision has to be done by consulting Smrutis
and Sistachara only.

I cannot comment what happened in other Yugas is correct or a
corruption. I think people must concentrate on what we should do now
in this Yuga instead of debating what was correct and what was corrupt
in other Yugas. We have to respect Dharma Sastra books like
Vaidyanatha Dikshitiya and Nirnaya Sindhu. They have a lot of
importance.
