I am trying to show the ancient practices and today's practices may
not be same . Already I gave one example from Mahabharata. We have
some Smruti Vakyas prohibit Beef eating. We have to know as common
sense the Smrutis will consider the Vedas and then only give the
verdict of Beef prohibition in this age. Do you think the Smruti
author was so ignorant of Vedas and meat eating he did not bother to
consult it?  What is the point in stubbornly following ancient
practices when we know they are corrected for today's people.

The direct meanings if they are according to Smrutis rules and
regulations are correct. Otherwise we have to take the indirect
meanings only to avoid absurd results.

I agree but we have to know what the Vedas are saying exactly.
