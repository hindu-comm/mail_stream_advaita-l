Direct and inner meanings-

Sometimes we have to take not the surface meaning of words but inner
meaning in sacred texts. There is a book 'Shakti and Sh√¢kta'. Here
these examples are given.

'There are expressions which do not bear their surface meaning.
Gomamsa-bhakshana is not "beef-eating" but putting the tongue in the
root of the throat. What some translate as "Ravishing the widow"
refers not to a woman but to a process in Kundalini Yoga and so
forth.'
