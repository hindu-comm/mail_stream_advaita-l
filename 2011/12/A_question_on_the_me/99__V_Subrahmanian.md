Namaste.

The pUrva mImaamsA sutras start with 'अथातो धर्मजिज्ञासा' ।  There is the
popular saying 'वेदमूलोयं धर्मः' ॥  It is generally understood that the
pU.mI.shastra deals with karma enjoined in the Veda. Now in the second
quoted sentence do we strictly separate 'dharma' from the karma of the
veda?  Is there a real difference made between the word 'dharma' found in
the two quotes?  The pU.mI. sutra also states: चोदना लक्षणो अर्थो धर्मः
which appears to be defining the word dharma in terms of chodanaa,
enjoining, or vidhi.  Further, does the pU.mI. shastra also deal with
'dharma' as it is generally understood: appropriate conduct?  Learned
members may pl. clarify on this.
