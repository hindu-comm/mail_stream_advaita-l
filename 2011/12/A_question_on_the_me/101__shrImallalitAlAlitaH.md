OK. Both words are from different scriptures.

Correct. But, as the first sUtra says pUrva-mImAMsA is dedicated to dharma.
So, if someone says that karma is subject of pUrva-mImAMsa, he says it
knowing that karma is dharma.

No.

 Is there a real difference made between the word 'dharma' found in

No, because both are talking about dharma which is said in veda-s.

And vidhi is a type of veda-vAkya or veda.
So, it comes that pUrva-mImAMsA is talking of the dharma according to
veda-s.

appropriate conduct is known as Achara. It is mainly a subject of smR^it-s,
i.e. dharmashAstra-s. And smR^iti-s go according to veda-s. To know more
about prAmANyam of smR^ti-s you may look at commentary of mAdhava on
pArAshara-smR^it.
