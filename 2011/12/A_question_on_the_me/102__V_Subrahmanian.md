Thanks for the response.  In fact the Taittiriya Upanishad itself has
specified thus:

अथ यदि ते कर्मविचिकित्सा वा वृत्तविचिकित्सा वा स्यात् where both 'karma'
and 'conduct' come into the picture.  For doubt in regard to both one is
asked to consult the 'brahmaNas' in that locality for clarification.  So
'karma' and 'dharma' (conduct) seem to be treated in like manner and
guidance from shiShTa-s is what is expected to be sought with regard to the
performance of both, in case of doubt.  And 'doubt' could take the form:
'whether to do or not' and 'how to do'.  This Upanishadic injunction
addressed to the graduating student implicitly instructs that matters of
karma and dharma are not universal and uniform; they take different forms
in different climes and times.  And normally for someone who has a vedic
background a doubt will not arise owing to complete ignorance; there
appears a sandhigdha where he is unable to decide this way or that.  It
could well be a glaring 'clash' of the vedic pronouncement and a smRti
statement on a particular issue.  Such would be an ideal situation when the
Upanishad instructs one to take the guidance of shiShTas.
