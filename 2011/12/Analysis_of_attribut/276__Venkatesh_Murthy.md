If the person is suffering I understand he can get temporary Vairagya
like Arjuna on the battlefield. But Krishna scolded him for this
useless Vairagya. The sufferer can have a feeling I want to give up
everything in life because it is not pleasing. But this is temporary
Vairagya, it will not help much. He can also have a feeling I am
suffering but everybody is enjoying life. Why should I not enjoy also?
Like this he may get Bubhukshutva desire to enjoy instead of
Mumukshutva desire for liberation. A cancer patient is told he has six
months of life. He may take decision to enjoy to maximum extent before
dying. He may get very strong Bubhukshutva but not Mumukshutva.

I think a middle class person having some comforts in life but not too
much and some suffering but not too much is the best person for
getting Mumukshutva. The others may also get it but it will be
difficult for them. It is easy for middle class person but rich class
person will be distracted by more riches and big enjoyments. He will
think I have a BMW but he has a BMW and a Benz car. How to get a Benz?
More and more Bubhukshutva.  The poor class man will  get strong
desire to enjoy at even a small opportunity for enjoyment. If
somewhere free food is given he will run for it. The middle class man
will not be distracted by BMW and Benz because he cannot buy them even
in dreams  and he is not interested in free food also.
