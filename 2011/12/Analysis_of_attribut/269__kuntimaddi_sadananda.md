Shree Venkatesh Murthy - PraNAms

There is no disagreement here - I notice in essence we concur. 

As a note: advaita is not a practice since any practice involves dvaita, but the truth that has to be understood. and YES it requires a mind that is qualified - if that is what you mean by strong mind. No disagreements here. 
I remain.
Hari Om!
Sadananda

The Atma cannot be won by the weak person with no
strength. We have to be physically and mentally strong to practice
Advaita. For Advaita practice Yoga and physical endurance is very
essential. Physically and mentally weak people are not eligible. Adi
Sankara was physically and mentally very strong. He walked everywhere
in India and did some many physically hard things. Weak people can
understand Advaita only when they become strong.
