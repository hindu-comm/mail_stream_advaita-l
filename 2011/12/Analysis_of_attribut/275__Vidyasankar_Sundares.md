Yes and no. A materialistically happy person typically will find it hard to let
go of attachment and get mumukshutva. However, a suffering person gets
ample opportunity to realize that at the root of physical/mental/emotional
pain lies the deeper problem of saMsAra. Because the AtmA IS Ananda,
the tension/contradiction between one's permanent intrinsic nature and
one's temporary experience of duHkha will eventually pull one away from 
the pain of suffering. In most cases, that is a key stepping stone towards
mumukshutva.
