But the suffering people can think of reducing the suffering
immediately only. Advaita demands them to think very radically and it
is not possible do that. They are thinking how to reduce suffering
immediately.  They can't think of other things. Advaita is not for
person happy with his life and lazy and not for the suffering person
also. It is for the middle person. He is not suffering very much and
he is not happy with his life 100%.

One lazy person and was wasting his time. They asked why don't you
study Vedas, Vedanta and Advaita philosophy? He asked what will I get
studying all that? They said You will know who are you. He said what
will I get if I know who I am. They said if you know who you are you
will become happy always. But the lazy person said I am always happy
now enjoying food and drink and sleeping when I want. I am happy now
and I don't want to study hard for more happiness. If there are
materialists like this always finding happiness in the small things in
life they will not be interested in Advaita.
