I think a middle class person having some comforts in life but not too
much and some suffering but not too much is the best person for
getting Mumukshutva.

I dont think the social status (poor/middleclass/rich)  of a person would 
play a vital role in deciding/getting mumukshatva.  I think saMskAra of 
that person would lead him in an appropriate direction.  there is no 
guarantee that middle class person is balanced in his mind and does not 
thrive to get rich...A two wheeler middle-class person may some how wants 
to get his hands on atleast a second hand car, instead of developing 
mumukshatva :-)) OTOH, the born rich owner of BMW instead of striving to 
get benz, one fine day, may realize the futility in acquiring material, 
get vairAgya and mumukshatva to attain everlasting wealth. (gautama buddha 
for example).    Its all depend on the 'pUrva janma saMskAra' that 
particular person has in his/her current janma.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
