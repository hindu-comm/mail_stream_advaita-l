You will tell Mr. Shourie his son Aditya with cerebral palsy and his
wife with Parkinson's disease is attribute of mind? There is no
suffering for him or  son or wife? How can he believe it? For Shourie
his wife and son the suffering is very real. It is here and now.
Advaita is not for suffering people. AFAIK advaita is for strong
people only not for the weak because the Upanishad has said Nayam Atma
Balaheenena Labhya. The Atma cannot be won by the weak person with no
strength.  We have to be physically and mentally strong to practice
Advaita. For Advaita practice Yoga and physical endurance is very
essential. Physically and mentally weak people are not eligible. Adi
Sankara was physically and mentally very strong. He walked everywhere
in India and did some many physically hard things. Weak people can
understand Advaita only when they become strong.
