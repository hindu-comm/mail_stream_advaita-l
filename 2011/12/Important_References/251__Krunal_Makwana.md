This is the first time I have heard that a commentary was given on Visnu
Purana. Please enlighten me about this. The only work which I would
consider as being majorly influenced by vaishnava puranic thought would be
the prabodha sudhakar, which unfortunately is a matter of debate for it's
authenticity being attributed to Shankara,
