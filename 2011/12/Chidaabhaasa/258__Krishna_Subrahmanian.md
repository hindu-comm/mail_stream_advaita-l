Dear Members,

I read the following in a book called "Spiritual Teachings of Ramana Maharshi" published by Shambala Dragon Editions. Can anyone help me understand what "Chidaabhasa" means?

Q: How do the triple factors (knower, known and
knowledge), which are absent in deep sleep, samaadhi, etc., manifest themselves
in the Self (in the states of waking and dreaming)?

A: From the self there arise in succession: Chidaabhaasa (reflected consciousness), which
is a kind of luminosity; jiva (the individual consciousness) or the seer or the
first concept; phenomena, that is, the world.

Any help is appreciated.

Regards,
K
