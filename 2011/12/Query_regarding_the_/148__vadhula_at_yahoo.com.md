We Also recite protection from snakes, invoking Astika's name, nephew of Takshska, during sandhyAvandana in NE direction.

I have heard of Sourashtran Brahmins of TN. Unlike Gujarati Brahmins, many are non veg and are into silk weaving. Paradoxical ? Perhaps Jaldhar Vyas can comment. They do undergo upanayana and many have taken Iyer surname.

Sankethi has no formal lipi (although there are attempts to use Kannada lipi) and is a mixture of Sanskrit, Kannada, Tamil, and a few Hindi-Urdu words along with Malayalam. We also do namaskara to Narmada Nadi during sandhyAvandanam.
