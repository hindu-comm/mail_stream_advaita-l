Even I have heard of the above story behind Bhaskararaya taking a Madhva
bride.  With regard  to Appayya Dikshita it is said that either his mother
or grandmother was a VishishTAdvaitin and that was one reason why he
developed a special devotion for VishNu/Vaishnava godhood.  I have not
heard about his taking a Madhva bride.  The book 'Sri Appayya Dikshita'
authored by Dr. N.Ramesan, IAS, records the former incident but does not
 say anything about Dikshita's marriage to a madhva bride.
