The Bhaskaravilasa says he is the descendant of Eknath who popularized the 
worship of Vitthal Bhagavan at Pandharpur so that would definitely make 
him of Marathi origin.

No I think you are confusing that story with Appaya Dikshita.

This is true.  Given that as well as the facts mentioned so far, he had 
his Upanayana in Kashi, his diksha in Gujarat and visited such tirths as 
Pashupatinath in Nepal and Kamakhyadevi in Assam he should be considered 
like Shankaracharya as belonging to all of India.
