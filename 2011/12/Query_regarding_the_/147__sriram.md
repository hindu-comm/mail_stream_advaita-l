Pranams
Addition to Narmadha vandhanam there are two more stanzas praying for 
protection from snakes remembering the name of Sri Janamejaya son of 
Pariksheeth.These are uttered facing the western direction.I donot know why 
it is not part of Sandhya Vandhanam for Southern smarthas.About 
Sourashtras -the word Sou indicates 100 in Hindhi-Rashtras indicate princely 
states.These states were integrated into Indian Union by Sri Sir Vallabhai 
Patel.There were 562 princely states in our country and it is to the credit 
of Sir Vallabhai Patel that these states joined the Indian Union.The 
Sourashtrians then migrated to South and are concentrated in Madurai 
District.They are known as pattu nool-silk thread- dealers.R.Krishnamoorthy.

I am a Sankethi Brahmin, Sankethis are descendants of Vadamas from 
Tirunelveli Dist who settled in Karnataka 500-1000 years ago. Sankethi has 
no formal lipi (although there are attempts to use Kannada lipi) and is a 
mixture of Sanskrit, Kannada, Tamil, and a few Hindi-Urdu words along with 
Malayalam. We also do namaskara to Narmada Nadi during sandhyAvandanam.

Regarding the word 'vaDama' I agree that they have a 'northern' ('vaDakku'
in Tamil means 'north') origin. These people, during sandhyAvandanam, do a
namaskara for the river Narmada which practice is not there in the
non-vaDama smarta Tamils. In Rameswaram too there are some families who
migrated from the North especially Gujarat/Maharashtra regions and settled
doing paurohityam.

Interestingly, too, there is sect called 'saurAShTra' who came from the
North and settled in the Madurai surroundings. There are many Brahmins too
among them. Many are into weaving trade. The famous Tamil singer
T.M.Soundararajan is from this community. I personally know of some other
people too of this sect. They speak a kind of Tamil.
