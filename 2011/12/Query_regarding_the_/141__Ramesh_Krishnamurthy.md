Well, this is what I remember having gathered from at least 3 sources. In
fact, even the names were mentioned. One was pArvati, the daughter of a
mAdhva scholar who was defeated in debate by bhAskararAya, and the other
was Anandavallii or Anandii from Thanjavur.

These sources may well be wrong, but it is not a confusion with Appayya
Dikshita.
