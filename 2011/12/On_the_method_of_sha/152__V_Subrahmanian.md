You are right.  There is an old saying: विद्यावतां भागवते परीक्षा which
means 'to test real scholarship one has to be subjected to a quiz in the
Bhaagavatam'.  The method of shalAkA parIkShA was designed keeping in mind
the need for a thorough study of a text in all its dimensions.  Since one
will be questioned on the special aspects too the preparation requires the
student to be thorough with the subject apart  from merely committing the
text to memory.  It took three months for the student to memorize the
Vivekachudamani and a committed study of the commentary to become familiar
with the finer aspects of Advaita Vedanta.
