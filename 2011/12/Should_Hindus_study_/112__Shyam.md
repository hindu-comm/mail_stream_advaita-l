Pranams everyone.

There is an interesting short opinion post by a leading academician/author
Deepak Sarma in the Huffington post by this title.
Here is the link.

Would encourage like-minded friends to read and either add comments or "like"
the post which may enable it to stay in the forefront and encourage more
dialogue about this important subject in the popular media.
