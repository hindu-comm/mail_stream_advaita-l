Thank you for a very nice post on the topic.  Some Acharyas have shown that
every question can be addressed by taking the dream analogy.  Just as one
would upon seeing an ancient monument in the waking and  think 'this is
said to be 800 years old' , one can have a dream where one sees a monument
and think similarly.

The eka-jiva prakriya is the refinement of the Vedanta itself and not
necessarily to be termed 'the pre-eminent' one.  In the Mandukya
kArika/bhashya of the verses 4.61 onwards several of them are about the
entire samsara being the experience of one perceiver.
