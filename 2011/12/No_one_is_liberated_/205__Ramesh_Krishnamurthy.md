It is anybody's guess as to why the word "pre-eminent" is used, but
certainly, "pre-eminent" need not mean "most commonly used". The strength
of the DSV is that it eliminates most of the assumptions required by the
SDV, and presents a short-and-sharp path to ajAtivAda. This is the
principle of lAghavatva as explained by Sri Anand Hudli.
