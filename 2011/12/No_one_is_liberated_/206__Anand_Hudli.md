 Madhusudana has referred to eka-jIva vAda as "mukhyo vedAntasiddhAnta
ekajIvavAdAkhyaH" in the siddhAnta bindu. It is not clear whether it is his
opinion that it is "mukhya", the chief doctrine of vedAnta, or he is
quoting or paraphrasing another work. In any case, the commentator
BrahmAnanda appeals to the principle of "lAghavatva" or economy while
explaining the concepts of jIva, Ishvara, and jagat. Looked at from this
angle of economy, it is possible to rule out the multiplicity of jIvas,
admitting only one jIva. This leads to the theory that there is exactly one
jIva in the whole universe and it is this jIva that aims for liberation.
All other beings, including the Guru, and the shAstra are only imagined by
this jIva. When this jIva gets AtmasAkShAtkAra through the instructions of
the Guru and the study of shAstra, it gets liberated.
