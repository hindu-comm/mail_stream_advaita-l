Rajaram: I too thought it is a rarely used prakriya but as stated in my
mail, in Satasloki verse 81, translated and annotated by Shri S.N. Sastry
for which Shri Krishnamurthy Sastrigal has written the foreword, it is
said, "This is also known as the Theory of Single Jiva. Sri Madhusudana
Saraswati says in his work Siddhanta Bindu, which is a commentary on Sri
Sankara's Dasasloki, that *this is the pre-eminent Vedantic view.*
