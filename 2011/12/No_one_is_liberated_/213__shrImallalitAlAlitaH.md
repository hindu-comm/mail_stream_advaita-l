Although *brahmAnanda* doesn't say anything about *mukhyatvam* of this view,
* nArAyaNI (laghuTIkA)* says that this view is of very old people
-*atiprAchInAbhimataH
*. And it is *mukhyam* because it is supported by shruti :
मुख्यत्वं च तद् एतत् त्रयं स्वप्नमायामात्रम् - इत्यादिश्रुत्या
स्वप्नत्वसमर्थनेन स्वप्नदृष्टान्तसलिलधारया समस्तशंकामलप्रक्षालनात् ।
*mukhyatvaM cha tad etat trayaM svapnamAyAmAtram - ityAdishrutyA
svapnatvasamarthanena svapnadR^iShTAntasaliladhArayA
samastashaMkAmalapraxAlanAt*.
And maNDukya-kArikA supports it - as said shrI V. Subrahmanian.
