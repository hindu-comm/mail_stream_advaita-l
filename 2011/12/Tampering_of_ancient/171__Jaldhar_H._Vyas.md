I agree 100%.  The problem is that nowadays in India history is only a 
branch of politics which is why much of the serious scholarship is being 
done elsewhere.  The only defense is for those who care to redouble their 
efforts to see that high standards are kept up and resist the 
bowdlerizers.  Complain if you see books like this.  Publicize the name of 
inferior editions so others are not fooled.  Satyamevajayate is more than 
just a slogan.
