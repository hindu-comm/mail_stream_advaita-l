Namaste Subhanu ji,

I think by saying // Therefore the true nature of ignorance is that it is a
false notion, not an entity of any
kind // you are implying that the orthodox or sampradaya-Acharyas are
admitting a* real entity* (called 'ignorance').  That such is even the
misunderstanding of Sri SSS is proved by his own statement:

   The following is what Sri SSS says in the ‘Reply’ (to a scholar who
objected to the former's views on mUlAvidyA):

// *AdhyAsa*, of course, presupposes ignorance or want of true knowledge.
But this is a logical presupposition, a necessary implication of thought.
No positive entity like the unfortunate *MUlAvidyA* can claim precedence in
time over *adhyAsa; *for, as already said, time itself is its product.
Vedanta which predicates the unity of Brahman will be shattered to pieces,
if a second entity not subjected to or originating from *adhyAsa* be for a
moment conceded to exist. The reality of the not-self (*anAtman) *follows
necessarily from its not being *adhyAsa, *superimposed. I submit this vital
aspect of the system to the learned Professor for his deep consideration.//

>From the above it is clear that SSS admits of an ignorance presupposing
adhyAsa. It is also clear, from the concluding remarks above, that SSS has,
erroneously, equated the bhAvarUpa status of mUlAvidyA with the Reality of
Brahman. He says that accepting a condition of ignorance prior to
superimposition is *a logical presupposition, a necessary implication of
thought. *What prevents him from extending this privilege of logical
necessity to the Acharyas who have found it necessary to posit a condition
preceding adhyAsa and naming it ‘mUlAvidyA’?

And Sri SSS by charging the traditional Acharyas with postulating something
'prior' to adhyAsa as an illogicality since 'time' itself is a product of
adhyAsa, strangely allows himself the privilege of  this 'logical
presupposition as a necessary implication of thought.'  While his very term
'pre-supposition' is pregnant with the notion of time, the concept of
mUlAvidyA, in the eyes of Sri SSS, is illogical if proposed as a
presupposition for adhyAsa.

It is clear that Sri SSS has misunderstood the traditional Acharyas when it
comes to the status they accorded to this causal avidyA.  From Sri SSS's
fears of 'Brahman being shattered to pieces if a second entity is admitted'
it is undisputably proved that he is attributing a position to his opponent
something that the latter himself does not admit.  How do we say this?  In
the adhyAsa bhAShya we have the term 'mithyAjnAnanimittaH' for which it is
well known that the parsing of the compound as admitted by the traditional
Acharyas is: mithyA cha tadajnAnam cha.. where it is beyond doubt that the
ajnAnam is admitted, qualified, to be mithyA.  It is well known that
anything  mithyA  cannot be really counted as second along with the
pAramArthika satya Brahman.

It is untenable also that Sri SSS should place a condition that only that
emerging AFTER the first adhyAsa alone should be mithyA.  While for him the
// a condition of ignorance prior to superimposition is *a logical
presupposition, a necessary implication of thought.// *such a condition is
not a threat to Brahman's advitIyatvam,  a condition, which the others hold
'as a logical presupposition as  a necessary implication of thought'
becomes a threat to Brahman by holding out the prospect of 'shattering It
to pieces'.

I think this fundamental misunderstanding lies at the foundation of Sri
SSS's edifice of objection against the traditional Acharyas.  In the
absence of this fundamental misunderstanding I think there will be nothing
for Sri SSS to object.

Don't you think the 'innocent' phrases such as 'mithyAjnAnanimittaH' and
'evamlakShaNam adhyAsam....avidyeti manyante' are 'inferred' to give
meanings that are supposed to contradict the meanings given by the
traditional Acharyas and to suit one's own line of thinking?
