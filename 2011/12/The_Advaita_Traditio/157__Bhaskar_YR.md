praNAms Sri Subhanu prabhuji

>  thanks for taking time to write this erudite article on advaita tenets. 
I've small doubt here with regard to your below point, hope you would 
clarify.

Second, whenever the mind is said to operate, ignorance is simultaneously 
said to operate. When there is no
mind there is no ignorance and vice versa.

>  you seem to say here wherever mind is in operation, ignorance 
invariably/simultaneously in action.  When there is no mind there is no 
avidyA.  Is this true in the case of Atma jnAni also prabhuji??  Because 
we have been seeing jnAni operates through his antaHkaraNa!! does it mean 
that jnAni too have this ignorance prabhuji??  One may argue since jnAni 
too operates through upAdhi-s/antaHkaraNa, in him too ignorance is 
operating!!??  Pls. clarify whether his 'association' with upAdhi 
(antaHkaraNa/mind) is avidyA or 'operation/utilization' of his antaHkaraNa 
is avidyA?? 

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
