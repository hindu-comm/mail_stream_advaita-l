The jIva himself is, according to the bhAmatI, the superimposition of the
non-Self consisting of things such as the mind, body, senses, intellect,
etc. on the Self. In the final analysis, of course, the jIva is not
different from Brahman and avidyA is not really existent! What I am trying
to say is that the locus of avidyA, whether it is taken to be the jIva or
the Brahman, is only for empirical purposes , a courtesy (aupacArika).
