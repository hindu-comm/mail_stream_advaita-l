Among the schools of advaita, the bhAmatI school has accepted the theory
that the locus of avidyA is the individual soul, jIva. VAcaspati says
in his bhAmatI (1.1.4), "na avidyA brahmAshrayA kiM tu jIve." The quote
is probably from a later work, since I have seen a similar shloka in
prakAshAnanda's Vedanta siddhAnta muktAvalI. amalAnanda, the author of
the vedAnta-kalpataru commentary on the bhAmatI, also has defended
vAcaspati's position. It is often pointed out that vAcaspati's position
is similar to that of maNDana mishra in his brahmasiddhi, where he says,
 "yattu kasya avidyeti, jIvAnAm iti brUmaH".

Anand
