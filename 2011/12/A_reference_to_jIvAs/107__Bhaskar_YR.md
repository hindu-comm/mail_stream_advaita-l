the bhAmatI school has accepted the theory that the locus of avidyA is the 
individual soul, jIva. VAcaspati says in his bhAmatI (1.1.4), "na avidyA 
brahmAshrayA kiM tu jIve."

But does not jeeva as a vishayi seeing both vidyA & avidyA as 'vishaya'?? 
If yes, then how can we say jeeva dharma or jeevAshraya is avidyA?? Will 
it be appropriate to say jeeva's shareera dharma is vidyA & avidyA?? coz. 
both are jneya only is it not??  Hence, shankara too in geeta bhAshya 
(13.2?? not sure) says that there is no avidyA in kshetrajna, it is mere 
antaHkaraNa dOsha. 

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
