Namaste,

I couldn't understand the question.  What is the relation between
dhanurmAsa and sathyanArAyaNa vrata?

praNAms Sri Sriram prabhuji
Hare Krishna

During dhanurmAsa (sUrya pravesha to dhanur rAshi ) temples will observe 
pooja very early in the morning and prasAdaM will be distributed around 
6AM and after that temples will be closed for darshan.  Hence I asked, 
whether at home, can we do satyanArAyaNa vrataM during day time.  BTW, 
traditionally, in my family we have been doing this vrataM at day time 
only and in evening we do Arati,  chant vishNu sahasranAma, punarAradhana 
etc.  But I do observed in some houses vrata will be done at ekAdashi 
pradOsha or pUrNima day. 

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
