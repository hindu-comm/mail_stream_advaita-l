Namaste,

////

I wonder if it is because the ocean (abhdhi) is fixed in one place but the waves come and go

//

It is not the waves that are chanchala. 

srIsUkta-rahasyArtha chandrika says that the vikArAs of ApaH are prithivi & anna. And 
the vikAra of anna is kAma / sankalpa. Since, manas (mind) is sankalpa-vikalpAtmaka, 
She is said to be of chanchala swabhAva. 

Interestingsly, manmatha / kAmadEva is also said to be the son of Vishnu & Lakshmi. 
His other names are chittaja, manOja etc which implies born from antaHkaraNa.

regs,
sriram
