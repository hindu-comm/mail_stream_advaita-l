Hello to all learned members,

Though Vedic Yajnas may or may not involve sacrifice of cows. One may get
what one wishes from such a yajna but will have to accept any negative
karma from the action of sacrifice of living being as well. So it is not
that you sacrifice anything that  the books tell you but whether you have
the capacity to cope with the negative and positive karma phala of all your
actions during the yajna.
