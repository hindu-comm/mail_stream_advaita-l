I am reproducing a notification that appeared on the bharatiya vidvat
parishad group:

knowledge of Vedic Philosophy to one and all has been conducting
programmes on various topics periodically giving opportunity to interested
persons to experince the traditional vedic learning.

Mahavidyalaya has facilities including accommodation and boarding to have

I am forwarding the Chairman's letter requesting for expression of interest
for the proposed programme, which will commencing from * January 17, 2012

*This program will be conducted with Sri Dakshinamurti stotram (with
bhashyam) and the VivekachUdamani.  It will be an interactive one in Telugu
language chiefly with Sanskrit and English used sparingly.  So those who
are comfortable with Telugu can derive great benefit from the program.  *

In case if you or any of your acquaintances have interest, please write to
us for making necessary arrangements. Since the  participants number is
limited to only 15 we request send your interest well in advance to avoid
