Dear Shri Omkar,

I am sure you are aware of the dark history of christianity and schemes of
the church until today. Based on that, do you think that they have agents
in academia or not? Once you answer that, identifying specific agents is
relatively easy.

Best Regards

Witzel has written a book on World Mythologies. There is no special place
he has given to the Christian myths. Where are you getting this idea that
he is an agent of the Church who wants to get converts to Christianity?

Clooney. Since they're his words, they can be cited as evidence. If they're
not his words, they cannot be used as evidence against him, regardless of
who maintains the site or sponsors it. By the way, what would be the
rationale for a Church-sponsored newspaper (if it actually is one) to
publish an interview of Clooney in which he makes a statement that he
disagrees with the Pope that inter-religious dialogue is a part of
evangelisation? They (or at least the priest maintaining the site) could
have edited it out.

courses - consider Edwin Bryant or Paul Sherbow at Rutgers (who directly

Deepak Sarma has written a textbook on Hinduism, and another specifically
on Madhva Vedanta. There are many other examples of practitioners teaching
Hinduism courses. And even when non-practitioners teach, they recommend
books by practitioners as well for reading. There sure are examples of
professors like Wendy Doniger who follow a very different approach to the
subject, but by no means is this representative of religious studies as a
whole, which has many examples of the other kind.

will not go into details -- in one of the courses I took as a student, the
professor (her name is Linda Hess) was following interpretations of the
Bhagavad Gita and Upanishads that were quite different from the one that I
strongly accepted that time, as a practitioner of one of the Vaishnava
traditions. When I repeatedly protested against her interpretations, she
invited me to deliver a lecture from the standpoint of my tradition, which
I did. She also asked a friend of mine, who was from the Srivaishnava
tradition, to present his tradition in the class. In a different quarter,
the president of the Hindu Student Council (an undergraduate Kashmiri
pandit girl brought up in the US), who was quite interested in spreading
awareness of Hinduism, got me to teach a student-initiated course on
Bhagavad Gita, which I taught as per the tradition I was affiliated to,
under the guidance of my
>  guru. There was no monitoring, and no constraints on what I taught, and
how I taught. The only requirement imposed by the overseeing faculty was
that students had to write a paper at the end of the quarter comparing the
interpretation I had been teaching with any other interpretation of the
Gita. I should emphasise here that the course was student-initiated, which
allows students to float courses on their own topics of interest (with the
help of a faculty member) if they find a lacuna in the curriculum, or if
there is no faculty member to teach that subject. I could have continued
teaching other student-initiated courses if I really wanted to, with
support from the faculty. My experience of religious studies in the
academia is quite the opposite of what has been said against it here.
