Namaste Venkateshji,


Brihadaranyaka is not asking all of us to eat beef. Never. I explained that in my mail. Can the children of all of us be expected to master all the four Vedas? You have to seek the answer to that first. The very fact that Vedavyasa classified the Vedas at the Sandhi period of the Dwapara yuga (ie. at the fag-end of the Dwapara yuga) shows that he had the Kali yuga in mind when it would not be possible for an individual to master all the four Vedas. In fact Parashara wrote the Parashara Smriti only when Vedavyasa requested him (Parashara rishi) to do that. This is mentioned in the beginning of the Parashara Smriti. That is also the reason Adi Sanklarcharya specified one Veda for one Matha.

Namaste Sri Bhattacharya

If you say Sruti I can say Sathapatha Brahmana is also Sruti. It is
telling us Sa Dhenvai Ca Anaduhasca Nashniyat. Dhenu means cow and
Anaduha means Bull. They both help us a lot. We should not eat them.
Nashniyat. Even in Yajna Cow and Bull must not be eaten. Then how can
we eat them if Brihadaranyaka is asking us to eat. The correct
conclusion is Brihadaranyaka 6-4-18 must be taken with indirect
meaning only. Same with Sankara Bhashya.

 times that exceptions don't make a rule. None can plan to have a child, whom one can send to four different schools of Veda. Adi Sankaracharya also knew that one school has to specialize in one Veda. Each of the four mathas established by him was to specialize in teaching one Veda, though there may be scholars in these maths, who may specialize in more than one Veda.

It is said that if there is a conflict between the Shruti and Smriti, the views of Shruti prevails and we have to keep this mind. To my knowledge Madhava did not say that Shruti cannot be brought in because Parashara Smfriti made a statement.
