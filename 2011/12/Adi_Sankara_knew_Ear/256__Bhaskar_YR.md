But if we know our place in Earth is going from Day to Night we can
easily say Sun is not rising and setting but we think Sun is rising
and setting.

I do agree, but I was just talking about the saNdarbha of that bhAshya 
vAkya nothing else. But if we see the astronomical siddhAnta-s as 
accounted in works like sUrya siddhAnta etc. our pUrvaja-s were of the 
opinion that earth is stationary, a fixed object in the space and other 
planets, including sUrya doing rounds around earth :-))  I think jyOtisha 
shAstra too is based on these assumed planetary movements.  And if we see 
the taitereeyAraNyaka pratha prashna maNtra-s (aruNa prashna) and 
Rigvedeeya mahA saUra and atharavaNi sUryOpanishat etc. even our veda-s 
too believe the mobility of Sun around the earth and sUrya is a 
personified God in vedic lore.  More details can be found in  Aditya 
hrudaya, atharvaNi sUryOpanishat, purANokta sUrya stOtra etc.

Hari Hari Hari bol!!!
