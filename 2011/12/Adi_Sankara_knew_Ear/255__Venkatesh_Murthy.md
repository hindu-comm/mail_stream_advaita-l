Namaste

But if we know our place in Earth is going from Day to Night we can
easily say Sun is not rising and setting but we think Sun is rising
and setting. Adi Sankara knew this. He is saying the word
Paramarthataha but it must be taken as Vyavaharataha only. Why?

He is not saying Sun is there from Paramartha Drushti like Brahman.
Because from Paramartha Drushti only Brahman will be there. The Sun is
not there Paramarthataha. Why is Sun not there? Adi Sankara knew
Bhagavad Gita 15.6- Na Tad Bhasayate Suryo Na Sashanko Na Pavakaha and
he knew Mundaka Upanishad also- Na Tatra Suryo Bhati Na Chandra
Tarakam.
