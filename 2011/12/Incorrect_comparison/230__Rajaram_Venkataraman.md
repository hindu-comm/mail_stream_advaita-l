I agree with you on poetic license. The question that remains is on the
correctness of the tamil translation.There is no word in Swami Vidyaranya's
verse that I saw which matches "sanchala subhavamulla" (of flickering
nature). There can be no poetic license in translation unless the argument
is that it is supported by commentaries and sub-commentaries, if any.
