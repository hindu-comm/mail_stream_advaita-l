Namaste.
 There are two reasons given in Narayaneeyam as to why Lakshmi is a fickle Godess
In Canto 2 ( The Formful Aspect Of The Lord), verse 4 and verse 5.

As she is so attached to Lord Vishnu's (Formful)beauty that she abandons her devotees.
She is unsteady in abiding with others including her devotees and not with thosewho sing Lord Vishnu's excellences.

We can see from Shankara's Prshnottara Ratna Malika that chapalam is assosiated with youth ( youvanam), dhanam( wealth) and lifetime( Ayuhu).

humbly,
smt.sumitha

I forgot to give the translation of the above and here it is:

Your 'wealth' is Lakshmidevi and Our 'wealth' is Narayana. It is best to
remember our Purandara Vitthala always.
