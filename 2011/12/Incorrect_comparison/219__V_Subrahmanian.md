Here is something to read:  http://www.gurbani.org/articles/webart70.htm

Maybe there was a widespread belief that such is the case.

Wealth has been compared to waves of an ocean for their unsteady nature.
 लक्ष्मीस्तोयतरङ्गचपला  is an expression in Shankaracharya's
shivAparAdhakShamApaNastotram.  Sri Purandara Dasa, a great composer of
songs on Lord Vitthala primarily, has this song to his credit:

In this song he compares the wealth of those who have turned God-ward with
the others who are devoted to the world and finally concludes:

ನಿಮ್ಮ ಭಾಗ್ಯ ಲಕ್ಷ್ಮೀ-ದೇವಿ ನಮ್ಮ ಭಾಗ್ಯ ನಾರಾಯಣ
ನಮ್ಮ ಪುರಂದರವಿಠಲನ ಅನುದಿನ ಸ್ಮರಿಸುವುದಯ್ಯ ||

He is invited by the King Krishnadevaraya and in the course of their
conversation this song gets expression.

In effect, that which is ephemeral is prakRti (Lakshmi) and mind is perhaps
the most telling example of this phenomenon.
