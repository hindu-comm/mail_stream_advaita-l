Namaste,

My last post on this thread. 

yajnO(a)gnirmriga rUpENa dhAvati sma purAdhvarE
rudrastvAkriShya tat shakti mrigeeM jagrAha vaiShNaveeM

At the time of daksha yajna destruction, yajna purusha in the form of
male deer (none other than Vishnu) fled away out of fear. Lakshmi
assuming the form of female deer was following Vishnu. Then, Siva caught hold of 
the She Deer (Lakshmi) and arrested Her in His hands. 

She is called hariNi. And the hariNa lakShaNa is chapalatva & chanchalatva.

In my earlier post, there was a typo in the rik. It is actually, 

ApaH srijantu snigdhAni.........shriyaM vAsaya mE kulE

regs,
sriram
