Lakshmi is identified as Prakriti and Prakriti always changes, so Lakshmi
might be said as Chanchala. Also in many names of Lakshmi and mantras
connected with Sri sookta , she is said to be Moksha dayini,
Apavargapradhatre (Giver of the fourth  purushartha). In the story of
Prahlada, Lakshmi herself says that she never leaves the place where Dharma
stands. Regarding unsteadiness, It is only in the mind of person who is
attached to pleasures. In fact Lakshmi. the very name denotes Siddhatva i.e
Lakshya or goal. Laskhmi the name itself denotes steadiness.
