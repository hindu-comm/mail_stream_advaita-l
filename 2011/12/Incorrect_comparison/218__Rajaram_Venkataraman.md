In satasloki, Sankara compares the guru with the sandalwood tree saying
that like the sandal wood tree which makes the nearby trees also fragrant
with its own good fragrance, the guru also makes those around him free from
sorrow. As you know, sandal wood tree does not emit any fragrance in its
natural state but only when it is cut and made in to a paste.  So, how is
this correct?

In Swami Vidyaranaya's Sankara Digvijayam introduction, he says "those who
are proud due to the wealth that is attained by the dancer of unsteady
mindlakshmi, who appeared in the milk ocean". Lakshmi devi cannot be said
to be of unsteady mind because when the milk ocean was churned and the
svayamvara was conducted she naturally chose Vishnu as her husband ignoring
other forms including Indra and Siva. In her incarnation as Sita, she was
always fixed on Lord Rama even when Ravana kidnapped her and tortured her
with rakshashis who were expert in creating illusions in the mind. So how
is this correct?
