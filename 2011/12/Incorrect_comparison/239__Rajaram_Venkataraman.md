> Rajaram: There is only one question and that is about the appropriateness
of the use of sanJala subhavamulla  with regard to Lakshmi in verse 4
(upotghAta). There were responses on why the scholars felt that this is
appropriate coparison. Yours is a unique position that saMchhalA pertains
to the word natI and I confused ca~ncalA and saMchhalA. I did not and do
not yet think so because my question was simply about saNJala in the
translation. As evidence I showed that the translator uses the same Tamil
word saNjala in verse 118 (saMnyAsagrahanam) as well. In verse 4, for
lakshmi (wealth) and in verse 118, for lightning.
