It would be nice to see the classical commentary if any.  However, अब्धि simply means "ocean" (or by extension any large body of water, or any large quantity that can be described as ocean-like).  It does not mean "unsteady."  There is hardly any obvious reason, other than literal proximity, to take अब्धि as an adjective for कन्या at all, or to take कन्या (with or without that adjective) as an epithet of Lakshmi (it is, after all, not a common epithet).  Perhaps we could instead take कन्या-नटी-नृत्य, etc., as causes of intoxication among the worst of humans (नराधम) who are called विवेकशून्य and languish in the ocean (of saMsAra), are given to worthless/evil discourse (अधमकथा), and suffer greatly because of the bad filth (दुष्कर्दम) of worldly existence.
