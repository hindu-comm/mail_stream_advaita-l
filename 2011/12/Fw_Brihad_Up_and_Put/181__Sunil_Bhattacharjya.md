Namaste Venkateshji,

Just because the discussions are held now in the Kali yuga it does not mean that learned members are asking one to implement beef-eating in the Kali yuga what was prevailing in the Dwapara Yuga. We are all matured people here and we all know about the period we are talking about. It is not necessary that everytime one need to be reminded that the discussion is about the Dwapara yuga practice. In this group nobody advocated beef-eating in the Kali yuga. One can definitely write about a past practice and its rationale at that time.

Let me tell you a story and that will show as to why one should discuss about the past practice. In one family a toy cat was always kept in puja room, generation after generation. An inquisitive boy investigated about this practice and found that a few generations ago there was a rat menace and rats used to come to the puja room and take away some of the naivedyas. To prevent that an ancestor brought in a cat and the meance disappeared. But the later generations did not know as to why the cat was kept in the puja room and that is why they started keeping the toy cat in the puja room. When the inquisitive boy found out the reason for bringing in the cat by his ancestor, thenceforth the family dropped the practice of keeping a cat in the puja-room,. This story is only to draw your attention to the need to know the reasons as to why a certain exceptional practice prevailed at some time in the past.

Namaste Sri Bhattacharya

Kindly look into the archives of messages. You will see how people
were giving references from Mahabharata and other books about cow
sacrifices. You will see how people were saying Yajnavalkya finds
eating tender beef is fine. You will see how people are saying Adi
Sankara is saying Bull meat is required for ritual in 6-4-18 and Bull
meat cannot be substituted by other things. You will see how people
are saying eating veal by pregnant woman is fine. All these statements
are cancelled by Sureshwara's Vartika and our Dharma Sastra texts like
Parashara Smruti.

But you are wrong about Chaga Mamsa. Non Brahmins are allowed to eat
it today. In Yajnas Brahmins also can sacrifice the Goat and eat it.
But even in Yajnas some Brahmins will not use Goat meat but use Goat
made of flour.

No meat is to be sacrificed at all, not even the Chagamamsa in the Kali yuga, as nobody should entertain the hope of making a child master all the Vedas in this age after Vedavyasa separated the four Vedas, considering the fact it would not be possible for one to master all the Vedas. May be Adi Sankaracharya, the incarnation of Lord Shiva, was the only person to do that in the Kali yuga. Moreover you have to consider a sizable portion of the veda has been lost due to the
 vagaries of time in the Kali yuga. So the question cannot arise about teaching all the Vedas.
