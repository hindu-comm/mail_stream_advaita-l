Namaste

In Ayyappa temples we see 'Tattwamasi'  Upanishadic statement
prominently displayed but there is no Advaitic statement like that in
Siva and Vishnu temples. Is Ayyappa teaching Advaita to us? Whom did
he teach Tattwamasi? If he is teaching Advaita why he is not accepted
in and worshipped in Sringeri? Many of his Bhaktas are non Brahmins.
