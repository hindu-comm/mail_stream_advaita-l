Namaste.

Here is a verse popularly known as Duryodhana's expression of his state of
mind.  I would like to have the reference number of this verse in the
Mahabharatha:

जानामि धर्मं न च मे प्रवृत्तिः जानाम्यधर्मं न च मे निवृत्तिः |
केनापि देवेन हृदि स्थितेन यथा नियुक्तोऽस्मि तथा करोमि ॥

This verse is quoted by Swami Vidyaranya in the Panchadashi 6.76.

Best regards,
