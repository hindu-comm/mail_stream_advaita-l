Namaste.

Thank you Sri Rao for the reply.  Is it possible that the verse(s) could be
traced to some 'champU' kAvyam?  In the case of the 'duryodhana' verse, it
is *quoted* in the Panchadashi (6.176 and not 6.76 as I had earlier stated),
a work that is at least over five/six centuries old.

A member informed me by private email that the 'duryodhana' verse is found
in 'PAnDavagItA' and gave a URL:

http://www.hindujagaran.org/Scriptures/Gita/PandavGita.html

Verse 20 is the one there. But then, is the above 'gItA' a part of
MahabhAratha or any other work?

Regards,
subrahmanian.v
