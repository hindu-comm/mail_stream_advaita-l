It is a well-known verse and is cited often even today, but it is not found in the BORI edition, or to the best of my knowledge, even in other common editions (Kumbakonam, Gita Press).  Its status is thus somewhat similar to another well-known verse:

अपि स्वर्णमयी लङ्का न मे लक्ष्मण रोचते ।
जननी जन्मभूमिश्च स्वर्गादपि गरीयसी ॥

-- which cannot be traced in the extant Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa.
