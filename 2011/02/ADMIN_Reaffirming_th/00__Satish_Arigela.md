AchArya's prapa~nchasAra : Is it shruti, smR^iti or purANa?
In shankara's(what is our list? :-))lalitA trishatI bhAShya we have a quote 
from the bhuvaneshvarI kalpa which apparaently does not belong to the category 
of shruti smriti purana

>smruti-s, purANa-s and itihasa-s have been considered as pramANa granTha-s in 
>the advaita vedAnta >tradition.


The purANa-s have lots of material lifted from the tantra-s sometimes without 
even a change in the shlokas.

Furthermore, you are aware that the nirNaya sindhu whichyou probably know is a 
comprehensive work on dharma shAstraquotes freely from the tantra-s like 
rudrayAmala and other ancient tAntrika works along various smriti-s & purANa-s?

Or why not think about the statement in the devI bhAgavata where it clearly says 
that some tantra-s can be adopted?
