We use Nyasa and Mudras from Tantras.  Saundaryalahari is the best
stotra ever written. It contains many Tantric ideas.  Smarta Tradition
contains many Tantric practices. Tantra should be discussed here. It
is not correct if you avoid it. We can be careful to discuss
Vamachara. One more source is Agamas. Aa No Bhadra Kratavo Yantu
Vishvataha.
