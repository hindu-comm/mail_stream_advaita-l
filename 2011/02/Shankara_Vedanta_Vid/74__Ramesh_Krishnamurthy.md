Your observation is indeed correct. Unfortunately, many 'South Indian'
participants in the Vedanta tradition, who consider themselves to be
representatives of the 'orthodoxy', are barely aware of the richness of the
tradition in the Himalayan belt.

Apart from Varanasi and the Himalayan belt (mainly Rishikesh and
Uttarkashi), there is also a fairly active tradition in the Narmada Valley,
centred around the town of Omkareshwar in MP.
