Om
there is an interesting meet of pandits and swamis being organized at 
holenarsipur, karnataka, to deliberate on shAnkara vedanta with emphasiis on 
specific issues raised in the bhashya. 

the attendees include sannyasis from uttarkashi and rishikesh among others. 

there is a very active 'north indian' vedanta tradition of unfolding bhashya in 
hindi with dakshnamurthy math, varanasi, kailash ashram, rishikesh and 
uttarkashi, swami kashikanandaji of mumbai, etc., with the northern sampradaya 
being supported almost entirely by sannyasis rather than grhasthas. On the 
other 
hand the 'south indian' sampradaya is actively nurtured more by pandits and a 
sprinkling of sannyasis. 

This vidvad-goshthi is conference of members from both these respected groups 
and offers an interesting perspective on shAnkara vedanta teaching as it exists 
today. 

the well-known topic of whether avidya is bhAva-rupA or abhAva-rupA etc will 
also be discussed among several others. 

there are interesting references to bhashya etc in the list of topics which i 
thought may interest people.  please see the link below  to see a scanned copy 
of the details of the vidvat-goshthi and the topics to be discussed.
