Dear Sri Vidyasankar 

Thank you for your email. I was unable to spot where I was getting carried away 
by Potter - I was just too busy admiring the scholarship and the scope of this 
series. A 100 years back, Ganganath Jha attempted this kind of survey in his 
Indian Thought series;apart fromhim, scholars seemed reluctant to take on such 
a task. Ifully agree with both of what you said. The one about no judgements is 
certainly new-agey.

There are a few more provocative stances which I hope to post over the next few 
days or weeks.

Dhanyo'smi
N. Siva Senani

Subject: RE: [Advaita-l] Karl H. Potter - Encyclopedia of Indian Philosophies - 
Vol III: Advaita Vedanta upto Samkara and his pupils


Potter's encyclopedic volumes on the Indian darsanas are typically at a high 
level of
scholarship. Even when I first encountered them, while I was impressed with the
overall quality of these volume,I could not help taking issue with some of the 
views
and conclusions in the volume on Advaita Vedanta. I find that my take on these 
has
not changed after more than a decade.

For example,

I have a problem with the above.To state that"truth is not to be found in 
judgments"
and "one cannot attain ... through the pramANas" are the most superior views and 
to
present theseas a standard corollary of traditional advaita vedAntapresents 
major
problems. For one thing, presented as such in English, it sounds too New Age-y 
and
doesn't truly capture how the advaita tradition talks of the pramANa-s. If by 
"truth"
one means Brahman, yes, we deny that one can "understand" Brahman through any
pramANa, but we do NOTdeny the operation and validity of the pramANas for all
vyAvahArika truths. 

The above viewalso misunderstands svataHprAmANya in a crucial way, as also the
manner in which it has been applied in the advaita vedAnta tradition. It is not 
as if
only "true knowledge" justifies itself, as if "false knowledge" never justifies 
itself.
Rather, the point is that *ALL* knowledge, whether true or false in an ultimate
sense, always justifies itself. The flip side of the coin of svataH prAmANya is 
that
of parataH apramANa and the material of this coin, as it were, is the operation 
of
bAdha.

That is, *every* cognition is self-validating, but a later cognitioncan negate 
(bAdha)
an earlier one. Till such time as the self-validating later cognition arises, 
which
negates an earlier cognition, the earlier cognition stands self-validated *for 
that
cognizer*. That is the only way the rajju-sarpa nyAya is utilized by all advaita
authors. The perception of the sarpa is a pramANa in and of itself (svataH); it 
is
negated by another (parataH) cognition that the object is not sarpa, only rajju. 
The
cognition that it is rajju,in turn, is pramANa in and of itself (svataH). There 
is a
reason that Sankara bhagavatpAda often uses the term "antya pramANa" in the
context ofbrahmavidyA, for the ultimate a-bAdhya (or a-bAdhita) realization.

To recognize and accept that all pramANa-s presume a dualityis notthe same as
giving up the principle of svataH prAmANyaon thefinal step to non-duaity. As 
a
matter of fact, for a true knower of non-duality,the aparoksha jnAnI, the 
brahmavit
who is brahmaiva, the knowledge "ahaM brahmAsmi" IS valid in andof itself 
(svataH)
and continues to be valid through the rest of his or her natural life in this 
birth,
because it is never subject to negation or bAdha. 

For the paroksha knower, the knowledge "ahaM brahmAsmi", as conveyed through
Sruti or AcAryopadeSa or both, is also svataH pramANa.While regular life in 
duality
may seem to differ, there is always at least an implicit hierarchy of pramANa-s 
at
work and it is for the paroksha cognizer to work out the bAdha aspect for 
himself
or herself.

The question of giving up svataH prAmANya in favor of "non-judgment" does not
even arise for anybody, eitherfor the aparokshaor the paroksha knower.

This, again, is a stretch. In my view, this is an adhyAsaof a view conditioned 
by
centuries of monotheism on to the logic, culture and milieu of traditional 
advaita,
which has never had any problems with polytheism and jumps directly to monism
(or non-dualism if you will), without building up a monotheism as being superior
to polytheism. In fact, the view that ISvara, who is really nirguNa brahman,can
take on an infinite number of guNa-s, leads directly from the monism of nirguNa
brahman to the happy polytheism of India, whether one wants to call it Vedism
or Brahman-ism or Hinduism. It completely bypasses the monotheistic insistence
upon one GOD,with numerous attributes.The one Brahman in advaita vedAnta
is without attributes, but the minute you admit of attributes, there is no 
reason
to deny multiple Gods or even to state that a view of multiple Gods with 
multiple
attributes is inferior to a view of one God with multiple attributes.The last 
view
is completely alien to the logic of advaita vedAnta. Throughout the centuries of
advaita vedAnta, not a single leader ofour tradition has felt it necessary to 
do so.
Not a single leader of our tradition has felt it necessary to denounce the 
"false
gods" of others, asopposed to the "true God" of our own. This is in complete
contrast to the prophets ofthe monotheistic religions.

That is true, indeed. Certainly, the above points about pramANa-s and polytheism
are two of those seeming paradoxes in how we understand advaita vedAnta in
contemporary times!
