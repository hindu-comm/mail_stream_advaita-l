Dear Venkatram
Your interpretation of the word according to Yaska,Shakapuni and Durgacharya may 
be right,but they are not the only interpretation."Vishwa"is a compound 
word.Shwa means to breath.Shwasa is an example.I am basing my meanings in the 
texts.One word may have different interpretations,and no one can say they are 
the correct interpretations.In 'Vi"we have the word "Vihangama" which is 
connected with a "bird's sight".Iam basing the meaning on one way of looking at 
the word,"Vishwa".
Moreover,it is not correct to say the ritual,"Vaishwadevam"is connected to 
"Vaishwadevas".Who are these "Vaishwadevas".?They must be on earth representing 
the rituals.Just like the "Dharmadevatas"as Indra,Agni,Varuna,Yama they must 
also be represented by earthly elements.Otherwise this ritual has no meaning.

Any how,since you want to refrain from discussing this further,I shall end my 
posting on this topic.
Regards,
N.Srikanta.
