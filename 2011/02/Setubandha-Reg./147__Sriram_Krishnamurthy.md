Dear Sriram,
I agree with you that translations lose their intrinsic concepts. I have the
'Sethubandha' in the original and the 'Yogini hridaya' commentary.
Sri Bhaskararaya Makhin's 'Ganapathy Sahasranama Bhashya' is also of a high
calibre. He is known to have composed the Shakthi Upasaka's Prasthana thraya
'Sethu Bandha'(a commentary on Nityashodashikarnava of Vamakeshwara Tantra),
'Varivasya Rahasya' and 'Saubhagya Bhaskara'(Lalitha Sahasranama Bhashya).
Though 'Varivasya Rahasya' and 'Saubhagya Bhaskara' are available in Hindi
translations, 'Sethubanda' is still not translated as far as I know.


Om Tat Sat,
Sriram
