Dear Sriram,

I haven't seen "Setubandha" of Bhaskararaya in English. 

There is one tantra called "Vamakeshwara Tantra" which consists of 2 parts. One is Nityashodasikarnava and the second is Yogini Hridaya. 

Sri Bhaskararaya Makhin wrote commentary on the 1st part under the name "Setubandha" and the 2nd part was written by Sri Amritanandanatha called "Dipika". 

The 1st one was printed by Sampurnananda Sanskrit University and the 2nd one was printed by Chowkhamba. Both the texts are available with Sri Goda Sastrigal of Chennai. 

Don't go for english translations. I have studied english translations of Lalita Sahasranama, Kamakalavilasa, Varivasya Rahasya. They lack originality and some of the intrinsic tantric concepts have been omitted. 

regs,
sriram

Setubandha is the commentary on consists of 2 parts : One is Commentary on Nityashodasikarnava and other is Yogini Hridaya Dipika
