All of shiva purANa is enjoyable but the vAyavIya saMhita is especially good. It 
may look blasphemous to some traditionlists but I along with many would 
seriously doubt if vyAsa ever authored this purANa. But one can always hide 
behind tradition no matter how illogical and irrational it be.

Examining its contents will surely show that the shiva mahApurANa seems to be a 
great work probably authored** by accomplished 
shivAchArya-s(saiddhAntika-s),vaidika/smArta brAhmaNa-s who were great 
shivopAsaka-s andalso by ancient pAshupata teachers.

**The inspiration of-course for such great men certainly comes from the devata 
and hence can be seen as equivalent to, devata dictating it.
