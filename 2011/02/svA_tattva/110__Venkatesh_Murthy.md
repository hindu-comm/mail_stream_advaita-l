This is told in the Sivamahimna Stotra-

'O, Protector! Once Brahma became infatuated with his own daughter .
When she fled taking the form of a female deer he also took the  form
of a male deer and chased her . You took the form of a hunter  and
went after him, with a bow in hand . Struck by your arrow and  very
much frightened, Brahma fled to the sky taking the form of a  star .
Even today he stands frightened by you . '            (22)

But there is another story- Siva cut one of Brahma's head but it
became stuck to Siva's hand as Kapala. There is a Kapala Mochana
Tirtha to wash away sin of even Brahmahatya. Siva could free his hand
from Brahma's head by taking bath there. Some people say this is
Bindusarovara in Kashi.
