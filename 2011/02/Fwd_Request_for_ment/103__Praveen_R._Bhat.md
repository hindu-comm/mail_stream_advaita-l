Subject: Request for mentioning Sanskrit as your second language in the
census
To: bhatpraveen at gmail.com


 Dear Devotee,

   - The Census of this country has started from 09.02.2011. In their
   questionnaire, they will ask our mother tongue and also 2nd language. As far
   as possible, in this census, please show Sanskrit as your mother tongue
   or 2nd language. We may say that Sanskrit is the base for all Indian
   languages. It is the unifying Language in which our Cultural and Spiritual
   Traditions are enshrined. Remove and eliminate this Language and you can
   destroy our Culture.

   Mentioning of Sanskrit by more people will enable the language get bigger
   slots in Doordarshan and other benefits from the Central Government.
   Otherwise we will lose out and hence our culture will lose out.

   Please also pass on this information to as many as possible.
