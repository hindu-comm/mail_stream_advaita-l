Namaste.

Listening to devotional songs and participating in the singing is held to be
a very effective practice of developing devotion to God.  Acharyas of all
sampradayas have stressed the need for cultivating devotion
that cleanses the mind and enables purposeful Vedantic sadhana.  A group of
devotees of the Sringeri Peetham have been conducting bhajans for the last
25 years with sincere devotion and commitment.  Sri Swaminathan is leading
the bhajans by singing the songs with the Harmonium and his brother Sri
Balasubrahmanyam plays on the tabla for accompaniment.

The session is held every other Sunday evening from 6.15 pm to 8.15 pm
(IST).  It contains songs in Sanskrit, Tamil, Hindi, Marathi and
occasionally Kannada.  Popular songs in the sampradaya and other unique
compositions are included and a lot of variety is there.  They have a
repertoire of over 600 songs and constantly add new songs.  The sequence is:
First on the Acharyas of the Parampara, including Adi Shankaracharya, then
on Ganapathi, Subrahmanya, ayyappan, Devi (Sharada, Parvati, Lakshmi,
Saraswati, etc.), Shiva, VishNu, Krishna, Rama and Hanuman and ending with
mangaLam on Guru.

Those in Chennai can happily participate by going to this venue, the
