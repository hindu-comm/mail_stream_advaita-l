In continuation of the topic above,the term "Vishwa"means the world inhabited by 
birds and the four legged animals."Vi"means which fly,the birds which have two 
legs(bipedal),and "Shwa"means the four legged creatures.Man who has two 
legs(bipedal)is also included in the world of creatures.The 
"Vishnusahasranama"states,"Om. Vishwam Vishnuvashatkaro Bhuta,Bhavya Bhavat 
Prabuh".The world is an utterance of the Lord Vishnu.The realised man (Jnani) is 
also called,"Dvija",born twice.In that sense he is also a bird,which is born 
twice,first when it is hatched,and next ,when it comes out of the egg.

At the end of the Vishnusahsranama there is a beautiful shloka which summarises 
the Advaita Vedanta:

"Eko Vishnuh Mahatbhutam prthagbhutananekash
TenaTrilokanvapya bhunkle vishwabhugavyayah"

The one Mahabhuta,Vishnu became many bhutas(beings),and that pervades the three 
worlds.

Regards
N.Srikanta.
