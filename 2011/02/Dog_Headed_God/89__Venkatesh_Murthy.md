Reference Book - Shankara and Indian Philosophy page 88

'According to the living Hindu tradition, it was Sankara, for
instance, who brought to an end the practice of worship of the
dog-headed Siva in one of the most popular centers of pilgrimage, the
city of Ujjayini. '

Which temple in Ujjaini has dog headed Siva ? Why Adi Sankara stopped
worship of this God? How can Dog be God?
