Sir,

I don't have much knowledge about anything you are discussing. But, I would
like to put forward a thesis for the members consideration. If the members
find anything to be wrong or inaccurate or substandard, please accept my
apologies and I am open to correction.

Veerabhadra who is supposedly the member of Shiva's Prathama Ganas could
have been the God mentioned in your discussion. He is often linked with Dogs
and is considered to be ferocious and could have been worshipped. It also
could have been that the very god shiva (Pasupati) worshipped with dog head
could have been later demoted to Veerabhadra after the intervention of ones
such as Sri Sankara.

He is often invoked in dances such as perini sivatandavam which was made
popular by Kakatiyas ruling in Andhrapradesh Region. It was performed before
the warriors in the times of war. Many artifacts unearthed in these areas
refer to worship of veerabhadra and Kali in the region. They can be seen in
the Birla Museum in Hyderabad. Curiously, I do not remember to have seen any
artifact with Dog head though. May be these artifacts are of later dates.

Thanks and Regards,
Saikrishna Budamgunta
