Saguna Brahma plays  important role in creation of the Universe. Adi
Sankara argues against Sankhya saying it is not Pradhana but Saguna
Brahma.  But the Universe is illusion. Adi Sankara accepts this. If
the illusion is gone Nirguna Brahma is left. This is Sat Cit Ananda
only without qualities and activities. I believe Gaudiyas cannot
accept  this. They think Saguna Brahma will continue his activities
for ever after.

Maya for Advaita is different  Maya for Gaudiyas is different. They
say if a thing is seen in itself it is Maya.  But if it is seen
related to Krishna it is real. Krishna continues his activities
explained in Bhagavata for ever. There will never be Krishna's absence
and his activities. Never.  Correct me if wrong.

But the Gaudiya Maya may not be same as Advaita Maya.

There is one Brahman only but for creation of Universe that Brahman
appears as Saguna Brahman. But the Universe is illusion. How can
Duality be there?

Question - Can Saguna Brahma continue his activities like creation
protection dissolution,  Krishna Leela for ever?

Advaiti says No. After you get Moksha Saguna Brahma is absent.

I think Gaudiya says Yes, after Moksha Jeeva enjoys these activties
with Saguna Brahma.  Correct me if wrong.
