Pranams.
In my earlier posting regarding the above,what I mean is,"the sentence,"tatha hi 
sampradaya vidam vacanam-Adhyaropa-apavada nyayena nishprapancam 
prapancyata"-this sentence is not found in any of the scriptures,though this 
method of Adhyaropa-apavada is adopted in these texts.
Regards.
 N.Srikanta.
