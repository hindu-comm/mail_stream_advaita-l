Re: World Muslim Pupulation doubling

Yes it is true that Muslims are multiplying population. That too at bottom
of pyramid. Educated and well to do muslims are not having more than two
children is also mostly true. And vote bank lies in bottom of pyramid of
muslim population. In view of Islam the world is divided in two parts (1)
Darul Islam (world having muslim rule) and (2) Darul Harb (non muslim world)
and it is ultimate aim of all muslims to convert Darul harb to Darul Islam.
This is basic answer to the multiplication of muslim population.
