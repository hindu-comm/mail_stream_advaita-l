Pranams.
This is with reference to the posting of Sri.Siva Senani Noriji regarding the 
above topic.Karl H.potter has been recently awarded the "Padma sri" award during 
this year Padma awards.he has published around 10 volumes 
,entitled,"Encyclopedia of Indian Philosophies"on all the Indian 
philosophies,Nyaya.vaisheshika,Buddhism,and the "Adwaita vedanta -Vol III,upto 
shankara and his pupils.The excerpts of all the Encyclopedias are accessible on 
the web.I found the Encyclopedias eminently readable,both in their presentation 
and analytical approach.As it is to be expected there are certain errors and 
wrong ascriptions on Shankara.

Bhava Shankara Desika me 
sharanam.                                                               
N.Srikanta.
