Namaste Venkatesh Ji,

The Verse is in Maha Narayanopanishad and its meaning  is
"All this verily is Rudra. To Rudra who is such we offer our salutation. We
salute again and again that Being, Rudra, who alone is the light and the
Soul of creatures. The material universe the created beings and whatever
there is manifoldly and profusely created in the past and in the present in
the form of the world, all that is indeed this Rudra. Salutations be to
Rudra who is such."

Thanks and Regards,
Sriram
