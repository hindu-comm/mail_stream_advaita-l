Ramana Maharishi read the first sloka, in which the Lord himself has 
written about the prominence of Arunachala Kshetra.  Within three stone 
(20 miles) distance from Arunachala Kshetram, I (Lord) will release anyone 
from all bondage without sanyas.

Hare Krishna

I'd like to read the above in the light of 'kshetra mahima or pAvitrata' 
of aruNachala and it is noway a pramANa vAkya on 'saNyAsa'. 

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
