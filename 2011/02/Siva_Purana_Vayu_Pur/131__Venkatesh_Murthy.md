Some people say Siva Purana is one of 18 Maha Puranas but other people
say Vayu Purana is a Maha Purana. Undoubtedly Linga Purana is a Maha
Purana.

Request learned members to give comments on this matter.

Brahma Murari Sura archita Lingam
Nirmala Bhasita Shobhita Lingam
Janmaja Duhkha Vinashaka Lingam
Tat Pranamami Sadashiva Lingam.
