Pranams.
Perhaps,my earlier posting is misleading regarding the above topic.I am not 
saying that the nyaya is an invention of Sri.Shankara.What I said was,the exact 
statement "Iti sampradayavidah vadanti-Ahyaropa-apavada nyayabhyam nishprapancam 
prapancyata"--this statement is not found in the scrptures,though this nyaya is 
adopted.
In his translation of the Upanishad bhashyas,Brahmasutra bhashya and the 
Bhagawadgita bhshya, His Holiness Sri.Sri.Sachidanandendra Saraswathi Swamiji of 
Holenarsipur,hs put a question mark(?) after this statement.I request the 
respectable readers to note this.

Regards,
Bhava Shankara Deshika me 
sharanam.                                                              
N.Srikanta.
