This means that the original source of this quotation is unknown; that is all.
Being attributed to a sampradAyavit, it is obviously a statement of some
unknown pUrvAcArya, in some text that has not survived. There are many
other such instances in the history of the darSana literature - the source
texts have not survived, but we know of them via quotations in texts that
are still available.
