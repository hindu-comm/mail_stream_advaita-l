No you don't understand it.  saguna and nirguna Brahman are one and the 
same.  It is the perspective of the observer which is different.  And 
measurement depends on scale and after jnana the whole scale has changed. 
It would be like saying "is an inch higher than a centimeter?"  One cannot 
answer that question because it is logically meaningless.  Thus also from 
the perspective of a jnani "is saguna brahman higher than nirguna brahman" 
is an illogical question because for him there is no duality of high and 
low.  But the upshot of that outlook is that no gunas can be superimposed on
Brahman and _this_ is the reason that jnani talk of nirguna brahman.
