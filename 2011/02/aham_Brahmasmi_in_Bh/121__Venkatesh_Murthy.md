This is not correct. If you say Nirguna Brahma and Saguna Brahma are
one the same I say Nirguna Brahma and a stone are one and same.
Nirguna Brahma is there in stone also because the stone is.  Adi
Sankara never said Saguna Brahma with his divine qualities is true but
the Universe is a illusion.

The qualities of Saguna Brahma also are false like the qualities of
men.  It is  a dream with Saguna Brahma as King and Jeevas as
subjects. In the dream King can command subjects but after the dream
ends where is the King? After Moksha Jeeva is not there. Saguna Brahma
is not there also.  We can say also both Jeeva and King have become
Nirguna Brahma. From Paramartha Nirguna Brahma only exists.  He is
higher than Saguna Brahma.
