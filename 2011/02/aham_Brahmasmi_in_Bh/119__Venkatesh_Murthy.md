Kindly do that.

But where Adi Sankara said Saguna Brahman is highest?  This is Advaita
discussion list. Many learned members think he said Nirguna Brahma is
higher than Saguna Brahma. Many members can give reference where he
said it in his Bhashya.  Sadeva Somya Idam Agra Asit Ekameva Advitiyam
Vakya gives a good explanation.  If Saguna Brahma and his qualities
and activities is the Sat of this Vakya it is not correct.

Advaita gives the best answer. Other shastras may give answers but
they cannot convince.

I hope you are familiar with them. You have given the Krama Sandarbha
reference. I think Gaudiyas believe that God's activites and qualities
are not same as our activities and qualities.

Only Advaita Srutis are correct. The duality and other Srutis are
subordinate to the Advaita Sruti. This is the message of Vedanta.

If you think Adi Sankara said Saguna Brahma is higher than Nirguna
Brahma the burden of proving this is with you. Here we believe he said
Nirguna Brahma is higher.  Saguna Brahma also is Maya only and finally
not Sat. Take this as Prima Facie position and prove your conclusion.
