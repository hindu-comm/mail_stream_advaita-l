      Dear friends,

There is a great confusion still continuing due to the misinterpretation of theMahabharata verses related to Bhshma-Ekadashi and Bhishmastami. 

Bhishma says that these (fifty eight nights on the bed of arrows) appear like a century and that Tribhagashesha is remaining to become Shuklapaksha. This means tribhagashesha (or tribhagashya shesha-bhaga), ie. the last part of the three parts or the last five tithis of the fifteen tithis of this Krishna-paksha are remaining for the start of the Shukla-paksha. The he recites the Vishnusahasranama before lord krishna and the pandavas and then departs. That tithi is called the Bhishma Ekadashi. 

According to the Manu Smriti the kshatriyas have to observe twelve days of mourning and this means the mourners get cleaned after the having bath on the thirteenth day. On the thirteenth
 day of the death of Bhishma it is the Shukla-ashtami tithi and at noon-time on that day his last rites were performed (so that he could assume the divyadeha and proceed to the Vasu-loka, to which he belonged). This Shuklastami is called the Bhishmashtami.

Regards,

Sunil K. Bhattacharjya

BhishmaAshtami and  BhishmaEkadasi (11th & 14th) greetings to our

Advaitin group. 



Bhishma ekadasi is a very auspious day. He waited for 'Uttarayana punyakalam' to merge himself with lord Krishna. Bhishma Ashtami is  the day of Bhishmaniryanam and the immediate Ekadasi is named as BhishmaEkadasi in respect of Bhishma pitamaha. All the Brahmins are supposed to give tarpanas to Bhishma. We celebrate BhishmaAshtami and BhishmaEkadasi by reciting Vishnusahasranamam and listening to Bhagavatapurana.

	Bhishma or Bheeshma or Devavrata is one of the strongest characters of the Mahabharata. He was the grandfather of both the Pandavas and the Kauravas. An unparalleled archer, he once vanquished the mighty Parasurama.

	 Using Sikhandi as a shield, Arjuna shot arrows at Bhishma piercing his entire body, thus finally did Bhishma give up the fight, focusing his life force and breath, sealing the wounds, and waiting for the auspicious moment to give up his body.

	I request you to listen to the Bhishmaniryanam episode from Sri maha bhagavatam in Telugu and celebrate Bhishmaashtami and  BhishmaEkadasi.
