Dear Sriram,
                 For Maha Puranas to be 18 the Pramana is
Shivapurana, Uttarakhaanda,Madhyameshvara Mahatmya. Shaktas may replace
Bhagavatha with Devi Bhagavatha.
                  Only the Gaudiya(Bengali) rescencion of Padma Purana has
mischievous comments on the Shiva Avatara Bhagavatpada Sri Shankarachaya.
This was discussed before in this list before. Hence I will not delve into
it.
                 Sri Sri Abhinava Nrisimha Bharati Mahaswaminah(1600 - 1623
CE) who was  the 24th Jagadguru Shankaracharya of Sringeri Sharada Peetam
had written a commentary on the Holy Shiva Geetha.


Om Tat Sat
Sriram
