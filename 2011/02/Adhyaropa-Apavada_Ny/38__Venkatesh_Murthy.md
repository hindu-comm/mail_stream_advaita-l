If Neti Neti is only method available in Sruti what is the use of
positive Mahavakyas like Tattwamasi, Aham Brahmasmi,  Ayam Atma
Brahma. Is it right to say Neti Neti removes the Adhyaropa and
Tattwamasi points to remainder after the Dvaita Prapancha is removed?
Otherwise we may think Neti Neti results in only Sunya like the
Sunyavadis.
