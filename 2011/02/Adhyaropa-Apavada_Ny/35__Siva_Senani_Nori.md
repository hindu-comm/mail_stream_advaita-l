Because of the limitations of language (yato vAco nivartante aprApya manasA saha 
- Tai. Up.), we cannot describe Brahman in a positive way. Language presupposes 
karta, karmA and kriyA or at least two of them, and hence the problem in 
describing the One without a second. So adhyAropa apavAda is not merely enough, 
ultimately it is the only method we have to know Brahman.

Namaste

If Beeja is not destroyed in sleep is it right to say Adhyaropa
Apavada will destroy Projection but Concealment of Brahman is not
destroyed. There was one mail on Vikshepa and Avarana Saktis.
Adhyaropa Apavada is a negative method. By using it how can a
Positive thing like Brahman come out? Neti Neti will negatively remove
Projections. But will it remove Concealment? The question - is
Adhyaropa Apavada enough for Brahma Jnana? Or some other method also
is required?
