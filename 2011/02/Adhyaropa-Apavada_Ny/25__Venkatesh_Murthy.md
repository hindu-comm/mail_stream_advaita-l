Namaste

If Adhyaropa - Apavada Nyaya works why you do not get Moksha in sleep?
In Sushupti sleep there is Apavada of Adhyaropa which is Dvaita
Prapancha.  There is no duality in sleep.  Neha Nanasti Kinchana.  It
is not Moksha.  You wake up and suffer in the Dvaita Prapancha. This
happens every day. Why?
