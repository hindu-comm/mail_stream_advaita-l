Pranams.
With reference to the above topic,though Sri.Shankara has stated in his Bhashyas 
that,"Adhyaropa-apavada nyayabhyam nishprapancam prapancyata"this part belongs 
to the pedagogical tool of teaching Adwaita vedanta.We donot find that this 
approach or method is adopted in any of the earlier Adwaitic texts,either in the 
Upanishads ,Brahmasutras,or  the prakarana granthas like Gaudapada 
karikas.Though we can understand from the Upanishads Bhashyas and the 
Bhagawadgita bhashya of Sri.Shankara that this approach is adopted,it is not 
explicitly stated  in the Upanishads,Brahmasutras,or the Bhagawadgita.

Bhava Shankara Deshika me 
saranam.                                                              
N.Srikanta.
