I was just thinking that after studying tarkabhAshA I am getting some hang of 
nyAya, but I was unable to understand the above statement of yours. Could you 
please explain the sense in which you use 'anvaya vyatireka' - specifically, if 
you are using tarka terminology 


a) what is the sAdhya here?
b)what is the vyApti?
c)what is the hetu? 
d) what is the paksha?, and
e) how does parArthAnumAna get established in this case?

If you are not using the expression as used by tArkikas, I am keen to know how 
else it is used.

Best regards
N. Siva Senani
