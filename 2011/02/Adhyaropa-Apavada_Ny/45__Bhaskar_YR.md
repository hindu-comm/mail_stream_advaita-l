If Sastra had only talked of apavAda through the neti-neti-Atma idea, the 
possibility of arriving at Sunya may have been a possible pitfall of the 
teaching method adopted by the sAmpradAya

praNAms 
Hare Krishna

Those who follow shankara saMpradAya's teaching, for them no fear of any 
'possible pitfall', because as said earlier bhagavatpAda himself clarifies 
what exactly is neti neti.  In sutra bhAshya he says : neti neti ityasya 
kOrthaH??  na hi etasmAd brahmaNa vyatiriktamasti ityarthaH.  Here it's 
been said that negation means there is nothing apart from brahman. 

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
