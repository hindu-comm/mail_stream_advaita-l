If Sastra had only talked of apavAda through the neti-neti-Atma idea, the 
possibility of arriving at Sunya may have been a possible pitfall of the 
teaching method adopted by the sAmpradAya

But adhyAropa is as important as apavAda, and that alone saves the day. 
Otherwise the Nagarjuna-type of constant negation would have led to Sunya 
instead of Brahman. It is noteworthy that those Buddhists who use purely 
negation, do not accept anything like the abhinna-nimitta-upadana-karanam 
(Ishwara) to start with. And adhyAropa, consisting of ideas related to 
jagat,Ishwara etc., is done appropriately by a sAmpradAyavit, the subsequent 
apavAda does not negate what should not (or for that matter, cannot) be negated 
i.e., Brahma-Atman.
