AdhyAropa-apavAda is a teaching methodology adopter by a teacher.

In no philosophy, you hear some discourse and go sleep and get mokSha in 
deep-sleep.

The question should be asked is not why I do not get mokSha in sleep but why 
I get samsAra in waking and dream states.

You will get the answer because of adhyAsa. That adhyAsa has to be negated. 
sva-adhyAsam nirAsam kuryAt OR sva-adhyAsa apanayaM kuru.
