If Para Brahma the end result of advaita is described negatively only
how can it appeal to average man? He cannot even think of it because
thinking is ideas and words Nama Rupa only. Brahman is not captured in
words and ideas. Why must he put effort for Brahman? Why not try for
heaven where he gets many pleasures like good food and hundreds of
girls? Because Anandavalli of Taittiriya Up - Brahmananda is bigger
than the other pleasures? But how can he imagine it? There is no
example to show Brahmananda is a bigger pleasure.
