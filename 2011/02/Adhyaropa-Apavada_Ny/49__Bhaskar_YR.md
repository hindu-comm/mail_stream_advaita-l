aham brahmaasmi comes with inclusion of even iti -iti that I negated in 
the neti neti. 

praNAms Sri Sadananda prabhuji
Hare Krishna

Aha!! this is indeed a very refreshing thought from your goodself 
prabhuji.  AFAIK, you have been arguing althese days at advaitin list that 
jnAni realizes that  ahaM brahmAsmi and jnAni by sitting in witness box, 
as a sAkshi, would  witness the jagat 'as mithya' by detaching himself 
from it...But here you are saying neti neti would become iti, iti...And 
this is what I've been telling as 'Atmaikatva darshana' or samyak darshana 
without any trace of duality.  And this is what shankara also says : 
pUrvaM avidyayA asarva Aseet punarvidyayA avidyApanaye sarvO bhavati & 
sadAtma vijnAne tu sati idAneeM svAtmata eva saMvruttau, taThA sarvOpyanyO 
vyavahAraH Atmana 'eva' vidushaH.  So, as I have been telling & now you 
are accepting, it is jnAni's satya darshana only and NOT mithyAdarshana.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
