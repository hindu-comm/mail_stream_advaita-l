I think Srikrishnaji wants to write the name in an Indian language as well. If 
Telugu is what he has in mind, in a stand alone form the ameyA of Sanskrit is 
written as ameya in Telugu - all deerghas of females names are converted to 
hrasvas; however in a samastapada of the nature ameyASruti the earlier member of 
the compound would retain the deergha - even in Telugu.

Another problem is that people have stopped using the compound word for names. 
Each member of the compound is written separately much like the English "civil 
servant" and unlike the German "staats-deinst". I used to write my own name with 
a space asa child and now continue that. (by force of habit?!)

Regards
Senani (so that I stay true to the earlier practice and not commit a dosha)

It is true that names and spellings and pronunciations have often puzzled
people using them. In my office there was the name 'AruNa' shared by a male
and a female, with the same spelling. I have a relative, from a Madhva
family, whose name is AruNa, a woman. It is common to see names 'SuguNa,
Vimala, Shobha, etc.' all of females written even in Kannada without the
deergha at the end. However, in Tamil these are written with the
elongation. The famous Jayalalitha added an 'a' at the end in later years
upon numerological or 'name-ological' advice.
