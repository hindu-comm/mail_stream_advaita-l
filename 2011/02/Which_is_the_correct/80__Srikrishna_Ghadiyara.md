Thank you all for attending to my doubt.

As pointed out by Sri Sivasenani, I indeed needed to write the name in Telugu 
and English. I wanted to be clear that the child does not forget our Indian 
language differences as written in Siva, Shashthi, Sita. 


As Sri Sivasenani pointed out, in Telugu the feminine names end with short vowel 
a, i etc. This caused the real problem in deciding which method to follow, as 
there are two words in the name that is proposed; to follow Sanskrit convention 
or Telugu convention.

I do realize that people shorten the name in practice / real life. So, to insure 
against such confusion, I would encourage the parents to write it as one word. 


This problem is compounded by a probable error in Monier-Williams dictionary. 
Please see the following two entries.

a-meya, mfn. immeasurable, MBh.
viii, 1975; Kathas. Amey&tman, mfn. possessing
immense powersofniind,magnanimous,MBh.; Ragh.
x, 1 8 ; (a), m., N. of Vishnu, MBh. xiii.

a-moaha, mf(a)n. unerring, unfailing,
not vain, efficacious, succeeding, hitting the
mark ; productive, fruitful

In case of a-mogha it is written mf(a)n, and in case of a-meya it is written as 
mfn. So, it raised as to what is the correct feminine form for a-meya.

Would someone please comment if it is a typo in the dictionary.

Thank you all.

Regards

Srikrishna

I think Srikrishnaji wants to write the name in an Indian language as well. If 
Telugu is what he has in mind, in a stand alone form the ameyA of Sanskrit is 
written as ameya in Telugu - all deerghas of females names are converted to 
hrasvas; however in a samastapada of the nature ameyASruti the earlier member of 

the compound would retain the deergha - even in Telugu.

Another problem is that people have stopped using the compound word for names. 
Each member of the compound is written separately much like the English "civil 
servant" and unlike the German "staats-deinst". I used to write my own name with 

a space as a child and now continue that. (by force of habit?!)

Regards
Senani (so that I stay true to the earlier practice and not commit a dosha)

It is true that names and spellings and pronunciations have often puzzled
people using them.  In my office there was the name 'AruNa' shared by a male
and a female, with the same spelling.  I have a relative, from a Madhva
family, whose name is AruNa, a woman.  It is common to see names 'SuguNa,
Vimala, Shobha, etc.' all of females written even in Kannada without the
deergha at the end.  However, in Tamil these are written with the
elongation.  The famous Jayalalitha added an 'a' at the end in later years
upon numerological or 'name-ological' advice.
