Respected learned members of the group 
 
There are a few clarifications which I request the group to throw some light. 
Dream is a state without any activity of gross body.(Considering normal cases) 
 
1.Some people say that in this state also karma kshaya take place without the participation of gross body. Is it true and any reference in scripture? 
 
2.Some people say that in Kaliyuga the effect of mental thought does not constitute papa or punya where as in other yugas it does. Is it true and any reference in scripture? 
 
3.At death, the physical body falls off. In between the time period before it acquire a new body, can it be treated as a state like dream without an activity of physical body. 
a) If yes, then can we call it pratibhasika satyam. Any references? 
b) If no, then why? What is the level of satyam that is assigned to it in the scriptures. 
 
4. Any reference or comparison between dream and transmigration period is requested. 
 
Thanks and regards in advance.
