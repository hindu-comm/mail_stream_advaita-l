Yes, no voluntary actions only the involuntary ones such as breathing etc.

I do not recall references off hand but the dream state is wholly 
subjective so any pApa and puNya, karma and nishkarma only have 
consequences in that dream.

The body consists of 5 koshas of which the perceivable is only the 
outermost.  But the other four are "physical".  The pa~nchAdashI of svAmI 
vidyAraNyA covers this topic in detail.

Prof. Arvind Sharma has written two books albeit from an academic 
standpoint: "The World as Dream" (DK Printworld, 2006 ISBN: 
978-8124603659) "Sleep as a State of Consciousness in Advaita Vedanta" 
(SUNY Press, 2004 ISBN: 978-0791462515) which I haven't read yet (on my 
ever-lengthening todo list) but generally his work is well researched and 
interesting to read so perhaps this could be a starting point for you.
