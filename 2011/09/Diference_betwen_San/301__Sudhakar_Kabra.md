Could you please give some reference where in Patanjali yog darshana Kundalini is talked about, particularly the mentioning of these chakras. I have been searching but unable to locate.

Respected Sir,
I am talking about the Patanjali yoga sutra bhashya consisting of four padas. (The original sanskrit text) We had a discussion and nobody could show any yogasutra reference on Kundalini and chakras.

Kindly throw some light with reference to original text. It will be helpful.
Thanks and regards,
Sudhakar Kabra
