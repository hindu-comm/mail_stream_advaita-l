The above indeed is a sad commentary on the Jivanmukta AchAryas of the
tradition who have also headed muTTs.

The followers of the tradition hold such an opinion on SSS's views too by
quoting the very bhashya vakyam as above.

His 200 books are largely by way of explanations/elucidations of the works
of Shanakara, Gaudapada and Sureshwara.  Sri Appayya Dikshita is also
acclaimed as a great scholar with hundreds of works to his credit on several
shastras.  Vachaspati Mishra, the author of Bhamati and Sri Vidyaranya too
belong to such a category.  Why should they be denied the epithet of
'Shuddha Vedantin'?

Without reading it how could you conclude that it is a magnum opus?  Is it
not on hearsay?

If only originals of Shankara are to be studied, why should anyone study
SSS's commentary of the adhyAsa bhAshya?  Will not people be better off by
reading Shankara in the original and avoiding SSS's works?

This logic applies to the works of SSS too:
श्रीचरणानां रचनाः न पठितव्याः, शांकरोत्तरव्याख्यानत्वात्,
भामत्यादिव्याख्यानवत्  [The works of SSS are not to be studied.  Because
they are explanations to Shankara's works, coming at a date later than
Shankara.  Just like the BhAmati, etc.]

On the same count, even the vArtika-s of Sureshwara should not be studied as
they came as elucidations of Shankara's bhAshya (on the Taittiriya and
Br.Up.). Scholars have opined that Sureshwara differs from Shankara on
certain topics. Even Shankara's kArikA bhAShya should be rejected as it is
only on Gaudapada's kArikas on the mAnDUkya up.

The terms like 'ajAti', 'adhyAsa', 'adhyAropa', 'vyAvahArika',
'paramArthika' etc. are not found / used in the principal Upanishads.  Yet
Shankara used them in the bhashya.  So Shankara is to be blamed.

The objections against mUlAvidyA and other issues have been aptly replied by
scholars of the traditional school.  Even in the recently concluded
Holenarasipur meet scholars raised several points to which the followers of
SSS had no satisfactory answer, so I am told.

This is a very wild claim that anyone else too can risk making.

In fact  rAga for one's guru and dwesha for other AchAryas has already been
given expression to in the above allegations.  The comments made against the
Acharyas of tradition have been indeed made without any justification.
