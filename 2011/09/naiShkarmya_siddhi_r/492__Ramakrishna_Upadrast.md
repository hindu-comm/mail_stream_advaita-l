namaste Shri Subramanya,

I am a little surprised by the mail and it seems to me that more is
being read in it than what has been written in it (along with the
later clarification).

For me, the advaita is as much as a living tradition (saMpradaaya) as
it is a teaching whose import is jIva-brahma-aIkyaM.

The tradition includes not only Vasistha, Vishvamitra, Yagyavalkya to
Gowdapada to Adi Shankara, but *also* later luminaries (among many)
like Vachaspati Mishra, Swami Vidyaranya, Madhusudana Saraswati and
recent jIvanmuktas like Shri Chandrasekhara Bharati Swami-ji, Shri
Abhinava Vidyatirtha Swami-ji and the current Jagadguru H.H. Bharati
Tirtha Swami-ji.


The tradition is an unbroken lineage and have correctly interpreted
the message of Adi Shankara. The differences in the words that
teachers in the saMpradaaya employ to teach a particular aspect of
teaching, is only an apparent difference, and is a difference in
terminology (prakriya-bheda), and certainly not "against the meaning
of Adi Shankara" (using the words that you used).

My praNAms to Shri Satchidanandendrasaraswati Swami-ji  for being a
vedantin, an advaitin and most importantly for being a sannyaasin. My
praNAms to you as well for your bhakti in following the tradition
started by Shri SSS.

Hope this clarifies my understanding. I have not responded to many of
the points in the mail because it will need more time than the current
holy time of navaraatri allows.

namaste
Ramakrishna
