namaskaarams Shri Sriram Garu,

Only long time back, I studied naiShkarmya siddhi from the translation
and commentary eminent translator Shri Prof. John Grimes (a student of
Shri Prof. R. Balasubramanian), which I can wholly recommend. I do not
have the book with me around to answer the question at hand. On this
subject, and commentary, I have been told (by Puja Sastri-ji) to avoid
the one by SSS and his disciples, along with one by A.J. Alston.

Currently my focus has been to listen to lalitopaakhyaanaM using the
lectures of Brahma Shri Samavedam garu, along with my vyaakaraNa
lectures.

namaste
Ramakrishna
