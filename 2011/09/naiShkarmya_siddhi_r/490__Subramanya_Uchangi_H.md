Dear Ramakrishna,

It is very sad to read that one should avoid SSS vyakhyana of NS. Mr
Ramakrishna has not justified why it should not be read! Ask pooja shasthri
to clarify. Is she competent to comment on a Brahmajnani? A true Sanyasin to
the core, than who heads Mutts.

It is sad to read that a commentary of a British Author is better than an
Indian Sanyasi? How can they understand our culture, Samskriti, heritage,
Samskaras Sampradaya etc etc? Read Shankara's commentary in Gita 13-2(
 tasmat Shasthravidopi asampradayvit murkhavadeva upekshaniyah)

For your infn and infn of all the members of the list, you will  appreciate
that SSS is the only Shuddah Vedanti, a researcher, who lived for 96 years,
whose memory was intact till 96, who has penned about 200 books. Pl visit
their web site ; a link is given below my signature. you can download most
of the books and read them free in djVu format. You can comment only after
reading his books and not by hearsay.

Ask those who have read his master piece "Vedanta prakriya Pratyabhijna"
 about 900 pages in Sanskrit, the language no less than Shankara's.(Note: I
haven't read since it is in Sanskrit- now being translated into kannada). It
is a magnum opus.

Sri SSS has written a commentary of 119 pages for 3 pages of 'Adhyasa
Bhashya' of Shankara.
He also asks you to read only the originals of Shankara Bhashyas only and
not the  later followers of advaita who have penned commentaries against the
teachings of Shankara (Ex Mulavidya, Avrana, Vikshepa etc which words are
not used by Shankara which is challenged by late SSS and which is not
replied till today by anybody )

No body has understood Shankara and Gowda pada like him

I welcome more comments for my comments. As a budding Vedantin, I don't have
any Priya-Apriya (raga-dwesha) against anybody but I couldn't tolerate such
comments without justification
