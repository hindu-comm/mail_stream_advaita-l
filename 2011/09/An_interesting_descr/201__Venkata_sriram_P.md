Namaste,

A simple and nice post.

Just a side note to it:

If weobserve the letter "ga" in devanagari script, the left line resembles
the broken tooth and the right line represents "Eka danta". 

The same letter "ga" in greekis represented asgAmA. In gAmA, the
middle line resembles the trunk and the two curves on either sides
resemble the face of elephant. 

Moreover,gaNapati represents the bija "ga". The varNa ga & ja are interchangeable,
hence "ga(ja)Anana". 

If we reverse the word "gaja" it becomes "jaga". "jaga" (jagat)is the bahirmukha avastha
if we reverse it, the journey becomes inward. gaja-mukha is the antarmukha avastha.

On the similar stance, one of the scholars derived the word "rAdhA". 
The reverse of "rAdhA" is "dhArA" which implies the downward flow. It's 
reverse is "rAdhA" which is the upward force ie., the journey of kuNDalini
from mUlAdhAra to sahasrAra. This rAdhA tattva merges with Krishna in sahasrAra kamala. This sahasrAra kamala being the brindAvana dhAma. 

regs,
sriram
