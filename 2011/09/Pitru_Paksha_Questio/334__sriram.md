Yes.Srardhdh for pithrus should be done on the respective thithies of their 
departing yearly .Gaya/or Kasi srardhas may be performed in addition only 
and they are not once for all times to come.Ofcourse now a days these 
ceremonies are getting difficult to perform as suitable qualified Brahmins 
are not available and the samabhavanas are also becoming high.Today a 
srardha ceremony costs nearly 1600 in purohits fees plus cost of the 
shasthroktha food etc.Cook`s fees is around 1200/- Totally it is 3500/-for 
one ceremony.So people try to do Gaya srardham once and forget about it.And 
try other methods by paying some amounts as donations etc.But nothing can 
replace srardha ceremony.R.Krishnamoorthy.
