The father can perform it in 'hiraNya shrAddham' mode in case of inability
to perform in the detailed manner. There is nothing wrong for someone whose
father is alive to have the upaveetam in prAchInAvIti for specific
purposes.  In fact I have heard several learned vAdhyars clarifying that
even during the daily pitR tarpaNam as part of brahmayajnam there is
absolutely nothing wrong in  prAchInAvIti by those with fathers alive.  It
is only out of wrong notions people fear prAchInAvIti when the father is
alive.

In some cases it is seen that the purohit himself will officiate as one of
the two brahmins.

I think paNi homa is only for Rg vedis.  For yajur vedis homa is always
performed as far as I have observed.

This is mostly dictated by convenience and kula AchAra.  There are even
those who perform shrAddham for the father and the mother during the pakSha
on different tithis.  Some combine both by commissioning four brahmins
(apart from the purohit) on a single day.
