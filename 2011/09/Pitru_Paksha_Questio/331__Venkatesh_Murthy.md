Who is a son ? Punnamno Narakat Trayate iti Putraha . He protects
parents from the Hell 'Put'. He is Putra.

Jeevator Vakyakaranat Sraaddhe Bhuripradanataha
Gayayam Pindadanacca Tribhih Putrasya Putrata |

1 When they are living he obeys parents  wishes and looks after them.
2 When they are gone he performs all rites and Sraddha gives lot of
Dana to Brahmins without being stingy. 3 He gives parents Pinda balls
in Gaya and other sacred places. These three things make a worthy son.
