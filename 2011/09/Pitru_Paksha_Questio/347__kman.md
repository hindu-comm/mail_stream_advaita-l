Sorry I did not mean to disrespect any one.
I was trying to convey my understanding and get validation or learn some
thing new.
Thanks to all who responded.

I agree, So why create more reverse bondage. The kid did not have a choice
in being born
to these parents. We also know that acts of karma are done by an individual
for his/her own
selfish happiness, so this debt that your talking about is mithya, infact
imho the parents are
indebted to their kids for bringing them in to this bondage.

For a non advaitin what you say makes sense. Advaitin should be able to make
the discrimination, right?

>No the father is simply informing the progeny of the debt that is in place

As I said earlier IMHO parents are indebted to kids for bringing them in to
bondage. Logically I am not able to understand the indebtedness part. Yes,
for their love and making us worthy beings we takecare of them during their
old age well with love and affection. But knowing that
there is no birth and death, why sraardha,

>> and worry yourself after death will my kid do this or not!
>> Will I attain Moksha or not etc. (what if the kid dies immediately after
the
>> father's death?)
>>

>You definitely should not worry but do your duty to inform your children

How is this dharma?

I need to complete the responsinility to our kids, so until then I have to
keep my job, car etc as it helps in my pursuit of my spiritual growth
But the srarda part clashes with the idea of advaitha. I am trying to
understand why it was
prescribed this way.

I am trying to understand If it will help in my spiritual growth.

Thank you very much
