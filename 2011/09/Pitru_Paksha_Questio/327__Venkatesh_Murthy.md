Namaste

There is one Sraddha Jeevatpitruka must do without fail. It is
Matamaha Sraddha next day after Mahalaya Amavasya.

Mother is very important person for everybody. But Maternal
Grandfather gave birth to her. That is why we must do his special
Sraddha  after Mahalaya and other Pitrus. If father is no more
Matamaha will get his Sraddha in Mahalaya itself. But if father is
alive the  son must do it next day. They say it has to be done without
Pinda because if father is alive son cannot give Pinda. The son must
do Matamaha Sraddha even if his Maternal Uncle is alive and doing
Sraddha for his father.
