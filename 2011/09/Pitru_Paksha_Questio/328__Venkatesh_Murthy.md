Namaste

Question.

I observed some Srivaishnava websites are giving a different method
for Tarpana. We have to invite Pitrus from Father's side and Mother's
side in two Bhugnas made from Darbha. Then we give Darbha Asana and do
Archana. Then we give separate Tarpana to Pitrus in two Bhugnas with
Tila and water. If it is Mahalaya we have to put one more Bhugna in
the middle for Sarvakarunika Pitrus. Asmin Bhugne Sarvakarunika Pitrun
Avahayami Asanam Samarpayami Archanam Samarpayami. Then we give
Tarpana to Sarvakarunika Pitrus. In the end Avahita Pitrun Yatha
Sukham Yatha Sthanam Pratishthapayami and give them send-off.

In the beginning they say Darshashraddham Tilatarpanarupena Karishye.
They are doing this instead of Sraddha.

Is this same method followed by Smartha tradition also?  If no what
are differences? I have seen Tarpana but no Bhugnas used.

Question.

Is it compulsory to do Deva Tarpana and Rishi Tarpana before Pitru Tarpana?
