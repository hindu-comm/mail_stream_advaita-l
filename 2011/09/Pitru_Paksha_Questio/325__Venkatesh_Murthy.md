This is Pani Homa is Agnau Karana. Homa is done in Brahmin's right
hand. Kindly see how to do it on Youtube  -

Kindly see Brahmana Bhojana feeding food to Brahmins -

Kindly see Pinda Pradana video -

http://www.youtube.com/user/deshbhakta#p/u/109/NtJ30FeB8YQ

The three important parts of Sraddha are Agnau Karana , Brahmana
Bhojana  and Pinda Pradana .

I dont think Kulacara can be used.  Because the Sraddha is a Vaidika
Karma from Grihya Sutras. It must be followed like any Vaidika Karma.
We cannot use our family customs.
