What is Hiranya Sraddha? Kindly give details briefly. If father cannot
sit down due to arthritis can son do it?

praNAms 
Hare Krishna

I dont think our dharma shAstra allows a jeevanta pitru to do shrAddha 
karma to pitru devata-s on behalf of his father. If father is unable to 
sit, his brothers (preferably elder  if not younger) can sit and do it. 
hiraNya shrAddha means, giving saMkalpa pUrvaka  'yathAshakti' dakshiNa to 
a brAhmaNa for his 'svayaM pAka'.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
