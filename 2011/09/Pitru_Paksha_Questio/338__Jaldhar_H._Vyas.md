No the father is simply informing the progeny of the debt that is in place 
by the fact of human birth.  We are in debt to the Devas, Rshis, and Pitrs 
because it was due to all three that we were born.  The debt to the Devas 
is fulfilled by pujas, vratas etc.  The debt to the Rshis is fulfilled by 
learning shastras, and the debt to the pitrs is fulfilled by shraddha of 
which there are upto 96 occasions (though only the most dedicated practice 
all of them.)

What would be the point of not mentioning this?  Do you think we should 
not learn Vedanta?  After all if we didn't talk about bondage etc. then 
people would be unaware that they are deluded and ignorance is bliss 
right?  No actually ignorance is not bliss it is the cause of duhkha and 
ensnarement in samsara.

You definitely should not worry but do your duty to inform your children 
of dharma.  To the results you should adopt a feeling of equanimity.  Your 
duty is to the work not the results -- this is karmayoga.

As for the kid, why should he do anything.  Homework for instance?  After 
all he could be hit by a bus die on the way to school.  Giving up dharma 
will not make death any less inevitable.  It is the realization that life 
in this world is fleeting that makes a mind mature and ready to accept 
dharma not for any reward but simply as duty and an offering to Bhagavan.

It doesn't matter how loudly you proclaim the snake is a rope if you 
still keep treating it as a snake.  Actions speak louder than words.   You 
cannot selectively claim to renounce relgious karma while continuing to 
keep the karma of job, fancy house and car, computer etc.

How does one "use" a formula?  The formula is embedded in certain 
applications like nuclear power for which you better believe there are 
restrictions based on qualifications.

Learning is part of the practice.  Some rare people can change their point 
of view just like that.  Most however will need time.  The goal is 
sannyasa but the journey can still be beneficial even if the goal is not 
reached yet.
