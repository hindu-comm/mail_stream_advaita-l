In this day and age where abortions and invitro are so common, it is hard to
believe this theory.
This does not make any sense. "Child is the father of the man" concept I can
understand and appreciate. This again proved that child is not indebted but
the parent is for the child to bring Jnana to the parent. The child's debt
is only
for the good care and upbringing to their parents. we need not force them in
the garb of tradition to do shrAddha  after
death.

That is probably less than 1% of the whole population in India (for that
matter any where in the world)  that a parent actually approaches having a
kid with spirituality in mind that they are providing an opportunity for
another life. If that was the actual case we will not have this population
explotion. It was pure  selfish happiness. . How come usually large hindu
families are now becoming one or two kid only families now, It is thanks to
Birth control.

Since I question the basis of this you can please let me know what
scriptures I can read to understand this.

But knowing that

This is  taking out of context. We are talking about pitr that you cannot
prove that exists and I believe that merged with Brahman and so do not need
Sraddha, which you cannot dispute. A rule has to be universal, what happens
to pitrs of rest of the world?

This is again as I explined above out of context. I can see my kids, where
as I do not see my Pitrs. They live in memory
which as per my spiritual understanding is mithya. I do miss them and do
prayers and charity in their name which I deem
more appropriate than shrAddha. or what I do is shrAddha  in my mind. Some
one in our past started this ritual which was great for that time. We got to
evolve with the time also IMHO.

Not very convincing.
