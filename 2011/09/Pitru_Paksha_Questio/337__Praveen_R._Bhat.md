I find the above statement comical.

You seem to have used the phrase at a place where its not applicable, just
as you've used Advaita Vedanta's rope analogy to an existing snake, not
perceived snake in the rope!

One "creates" bondage for the progeny by the very act of creating the
progeny, so to say, because the pitru RNa/debt passes on! That debt lies in
opportunity provided for the jIva/progeny to realize.

If such worry was there when alive for the jIva, how will it suddenly go
away just because one/sthula sharIra is no more? pitru paksha is precisely
for that reason where even the ones whose shrAddha is not being done get
taken care of.

I urge you to kindly read Jaldharji's last mail on the topic once more,
especially his last paragraph to know why you've to keep "fearing" for the
debt you've taken. Why is the shrAddhA performed?

Scientist or where its applicable. I can't use that and say I will stop
eating matter and instead I can eat energy now, can I?

The Advaita Vedanta practice *is* following dharma, not giving it up!
