I find your words full of ignorance.
You don't follow advaita-tradition. So, you can't understand sayings of V.
Srirama.

Actually, that person didn't listen rAmAyaNa with attention or was of dull
wit.
This is not the case here.
Anything which Srirama said was told after hearing advaita tradition with
proper attention. His words following tradition prove him intelligent too.
So wrong comparison.

I don't know about your studies but can infer from your sayings that you
have no proper study of bhAShyam of sha~Nkara-bhagavatpAda.
Whatever was said here was just according to his bhAShyam.

You got it right.
Some of us are known as 'vaidiak-s'.

That's not the case.
We don't accept that brahma-GYAnam occurs without saMnyAsa. So in case of
gR^ihastha-s this fear is not unusual.
What about people who are said to be realized without samnyAsa ?
I can't say about everyone's condition. But, I lack faith in these
statements of enlightment .
What about those who are described in scriptures ?
We accept them enlightened.
But all of them were not saMnyAsI-s ?
They were.
When we say 'samnyAsa is essential for GYAnam', it means - 'both inner and
outer for unbarred' , and 'only inner for barred people'. If someone is
barred by scripture to take external one, only inner saMnyAsa will suffice.
In some cases saMnyAsa taken in previous births is accepted.

It is like saying I can use e=mc^2 only if I am a scintist.
>

I don't think E= MC^2 is of any use of layman for the purpose of feeding,
etc.
If you can't enjoy fruits of knowledge, then definitely it's not for you.
saMnyAsa is needed to enjoy fruit of advaita-knowledge.
How could you say ?
Because of shrutI :
shAnto dAnta uparatastitixu....
What if I've no faith in this shruti and Ashrama, etc. ?
Leave talks of advaita. You can never prove it without scriptures.

Yes and No.
Yes, because we practice it internally even in gR^ihastha-Ashrama.
No, because we don't show it externally.
Whatever is appropriate for an Ashrama is practiced and not otherwise.
