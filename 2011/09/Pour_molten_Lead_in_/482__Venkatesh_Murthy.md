There is a Vruddha Gautama Smruti. There is a lot of praise for
Brahmins in it. Like Krishna told Yudhisthira -

विप्रप्रसादाद्धरणीधरोऽहं विप्रप्रसादादसुरान् जयामि ।
विप्रप्रसादाच्च सदक्षिणोऽहं विप्रप्रसादादजितोऽस्मि ॥
By grace of Brahmins I hold the earth by grace of Brahmins I defeat
the Asuras by grace of Brahmins I get honour by grace of Brahmins I am
invincible.

Lot of praise for cows  -

पितरो वृषभा ज्ञेया गावो लोकस्य मातरः ।
तासां तु पूजया राजन् पूजिताः पितृमातरः ॥
Bulls are Fathers Cows are Mothers of the world. Worship of the cows
is worship of all Fathers and Mothers.

गावो मे मातरः सर्वाः पितरश्चैव मे वृषाः ।
ग्रासमुष्टिं मया दत्तां प्रतिगृह्णन्तु मातरः ॥
All cows are my Mothers all bulls are my Fathers. I am giving Go Grasa
food to cows. Let Mothers accept it.

It is the duty of Dvijas to give food daily to cows. This is Go Grasa.
One mouthful of cooked food is fed to the cow.
