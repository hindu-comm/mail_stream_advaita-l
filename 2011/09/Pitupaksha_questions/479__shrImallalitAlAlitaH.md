I think S. Narayanaswami is either talking about realized people or he
thinks himself realized.
If he is talking about people who have all qualities to shun karma, then no
one has problem.
If second, then there is no use of talking. Because, he need not talk to
karmin-s. And, karmin-s can not make him understand their position ever.
And about people supporting karma, they are talking about themselves. So,
they are not wrong too.
Just understand each other and leave useless talks, as both parties are not
hearing anything of others and words are becoming rough.
