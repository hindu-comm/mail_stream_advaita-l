What do you think of -

Deva Pitru Karyabhyam Na Pramaditavyam in Taittiriya Upanishad.

Do you think Mimamsakas inserted it?

Advaitis and Mimamsakas are brothers in doing Nitya and Naimittika
Karmas. There is no difference. Both do it.

Only difference Advaitis will not accept Karmas have to be done for
ever. If you take Sanyasa no Karma is required.
But if not there is Dosha in not doing it.

You cant be in Trishanku stage not performing Karma but not Sanyasi also.
