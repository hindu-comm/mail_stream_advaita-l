Apologies for this but I have been following this post for some time now and
although Srikantaji you are posting some thought provoking posts and with
relevant quotes from scriptures, commentaries, nonetheless your fundamental
statement regarding karma is flawed and hence everything else you try to
back it up with unfortunately is flawed.

akarma or the non performance of action can only apply to those who have no
sense of 'deorship'. Assuming everyone in this list is not yet a brahma
jnAni (he he :0) ), regardless of any philosophical background dharma
dictates we must perform our rituals for our three debts. There is no
getting out of this! Even the mere throught that I need not perform shrAddha
is if anything a firm affirmation that we consider ourselves kartA (doer)!

You can quote shankarAcArya until you go blue in the face, but this concept
remains ever true until brahma jnAna is attained and even then karma is
performed for the sake of society just like the present AcArya's now! I can
also see and share Sri Jaldharji's frustration in trying to explain this to
you time and time again.

No doubt your knowledge of the commentarial literature of shankara is
admirable but this area of karma should be looked upon as a holistic action
of dharma rather than on a ontological foundation

Dear Krunalji
I would like to know from you where I have flawed in my fundamental statement regarding karma and everything else is flawed.I want to know sincerly from you!
You say,akarma or the nonperformance of action can only apply to those who have no sense of doership.I would like to know whether any person can remain without a sense of "Doership"?
Coming to the question of doing one's dharmic duties,I would like to know from you whether you are doing all these duties?Donotreply as if you are in the crowd
,What is Brahmajnana.I am not mentioning the last stage of Brahmajnana or what it is like.All Iam saying is that if we halt or liger in the stage of performing only actions can we progress further?I donot know what the present acharyas are doing now.You need not share Jaldhar Vyasji's frustration in trying to explain this to me time and again.What I am saying is voice your views without intervening in my views.You have equal rights as sriVidyashankarjis has said.
You views on Karma shows how deeply with roots it has strongly embedded in your framework,and how difficult it is to uproot it.Vedantha,Jnanasiddhantha by SriShankaracharya and his predecessors is built on strong ontological foundation.Karma theory is only forced upon us and doesnot even on Epistemological foundation.I would ask you to study more on this and know for yourself.
N.Srikanta.
