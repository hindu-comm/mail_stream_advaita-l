Sri Srikanta,

All I can say is that I am amazed at the copious expanse of words that have poured forth
from your keyboard on this topic. The content of your was to be expected, but the quantity
shows the passion you have invested in it. All in vain, is it not?

> "Pitha rakshathi kaumare,bhartha rakshati yauvane
> rakshanti sthavire putrah,na stree svatantra marhathi!!"

This is Manu's verse about the absence of freedom (svAtantryam) for women (strI) in the
course of life. A woman was supposed to be protected by father, then by husband and then
by sons. In today's context, with the recognition of woman's rights as being independent of
the men in her life, this is indeed getting obsolete.

In any case, how does that fit in with pitR kArya and its observance?

Shows how well you understand either rituals in general or Hindu dharma in particular or
Sankara Bhagavatpada's teaching of the jnAna kANDa! All I can say is, read the verse "vedo 
nityam adhIyatAM tad uditam karma svanushThIyatAm ..."

The parasites are those armchair jnAnI-s who disparage karmA out of context and think they
understand Sankara well. They are the most gullible, who think they have understood it all.
The second chapter of kenopanishat comes to mind!
