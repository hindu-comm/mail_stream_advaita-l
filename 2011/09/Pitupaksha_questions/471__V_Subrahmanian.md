That mantra of the Mundakopanishat is only about kAmya karma.  The vedantic
position about vihita nitya karma is not covered by the above mantra.  This
category of karma has to be performed even by a mumukShu, if he is a
non-sannyasin.  Even for sannyasins various sampradayas have certain types
of rituals.  When Shankara says that even a jnani, if he remains a
grihastha, performs his Ashramochita karma, where is the question of the
Scripture and Shankara asking one to give up that kind of karma?  'shrAddha'
comes under 'deva pitR kAryAbhyAm na pramaditavyam'.

कायेन मनसा बुद्ध्या केवलैः इन्द्रियैः अपि |*
योगिनः **कर्म कुर्वन्ति **संगं त्यक्त्वा*, *आत्मशुद्धये || ५.११

The engagement of a mumukshu in vihita karma as karma yoga will not put him
in further samsara.  Shankara has said that the greatness of karma yoga is
such that: karma which is by nature binding becomes releasing in nature when
performed as karma yoga.
