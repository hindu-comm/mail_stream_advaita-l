Correct.
This is not for saMnyAsI for provided reason.
But, it is not for a person who wants to stick to gR^ihastha-Ashrama too.
The word parihAya shows that it saMnyAsa must occur before AtmaGYAnam.
Shunning karma is not accepted without shunning Ashrama connected with it.

I've not explained it according to any commentary, etc. I'm just following
your line.
