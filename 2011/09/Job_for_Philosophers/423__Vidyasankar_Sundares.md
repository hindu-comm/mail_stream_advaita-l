Another option in the UK would be the Hinduja foundation which funds students/scholars
(http://hindujagroup.com/hinduja-foundation/education.html). If it is only publishing that
is required, I would suggest contacting India based houses, such as Motilal Banarsidass,
Munshiram Manoharlal or DK agencies. The market for such publications is very small, as
people would rather turn on their TVs to one of the numerous "spiritual" channels than
sit down with a serious book! So, it is going to be an uphill task, but I'm sure this is not
new news to scholars.

Regards,
Vidyasankar
