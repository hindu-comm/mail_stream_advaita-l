Following can be the places where one can study as well as work:
1. "Chinmaya International foundation" in Kerala, Adi Shankara Nilayam , in
Veliyanad. there is a centre for study of vedanta - with special focus on
shankara philosophy.
2. "National Institute for Advanced Studies",  Bangalore (in Indian
Institute of Science campus) where there was a department of philosophy some
time back. here some good research studies have taken place in the area of
philosophy - both western and eastern.
3. several Hindu ashrams also run these types of centres- big and small.

The first two are very good and reputed places.
regards
vaidehi
