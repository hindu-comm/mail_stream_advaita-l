Dear Members,

One of my friends is in the final stages of compeleting his research in
Madhusudana Saraswati's Gudartha Dipika. Generally, philosophy students, who
do full time study like him, are lucky if they get a University posting. But
with public funding cuts, it is indeed hard to get one and would like to
know if there are Hindu institutions that support such doctoral graduates. I
would also like to know if there are publishers or established authors who
are favourably disposed towards printing works. The aptitude honed
through philosophical research can be used to retrain oneself to take up
another profession but his first line of attack would be to find work
aligned to his area of interest.

Best Regards
Rajaram Venkataramani
