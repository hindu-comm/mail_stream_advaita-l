I am working in South Africa.  I wanted to know more about Advaita.
I recently had Shrimad Bhagavatham in Telugu, and drive to hear more
 about atma(the Self) is increasing.

I am Sri Vidhya Upasaka and have been analyzing the great similarities
of Sri Vidhya with Shankaradvaitham and also Kashmir Shaivism.
I stumbled upon this group and found some great minds and discussions
and hence got interested in joining this group primarily to enhace my
understandingm of the philosophies.
