Namaste SrI Shankar ji

What you have written is quite interesting. Just to to clarify -

In your revised understanding, within each passage/sUkta/adhyAya (located be
it in either the mantra-samhita, brAhmaNa, Aranyaka etc of each Veda),  we
could have some portions containing mantra-s plus the passages explaining
the use of those mantra-s in karma  which together constitute mImAmsa's
sabda pramANa. while other portions/vAkya-s within the same section are only
to provide context and sangatIs and stuti (such passages not being sabda
pramANa per se). Is this right ?

My questions are - in your revised understanding,

1. how does mImAmsA's sabda pramANa parse a given upaniShad or a sUktaM
(maybe you could take a small exampe) ?

2.  In the SrI sUktaM, consider the portion from

A).  "hiraNyavarNAM hariNIM suvarNa rajatasrajAM, chandrAm hiraNmayIM
lakShmIm jAtavedo ma Avaha    ......yasyAM hiraNyam prabhUtam gAvo
dAsyo'ashvAN, vindeyaM puruShAnahaM" - this seems to be the
mantra-portion.
and then compare with the

B) The uttara-bhAga  giving details of the practice/use of the mantra and
also stuti of Devi with some almost-purANic sounding stuti like "SrI
rangadhAmeshvarIM" and "sarva-mangala-mAngalye-shive-sarvArtha-sAdhike"
etc., .starting with "yah shuchiH prayato bhUtva yuhuyAd AjyamanvahaM ,
shriyaH panchadasharcarcam ca shrI kAmaH satatam japet"
(On who purifies himself and offers Ajyam to Agni etc....) and ending with
"santatamRcA vashat-kRtyaM sandhattam sandhIyate prajayA pashubhiH"
Very often , we don;t even hear the latter part being recited, although the
latter portion too  has intonations (anudAtta, udAtta, svarita). Do both
these portions fall within mImAmsA's sabda-pramANa or are there some vAkya-s
within the above 2 portions which don't fall within the purview of mImAmsa's
sabda pramANa ?

Also could you post the link to the thread discussed earlier ?

Regards
Raghav
