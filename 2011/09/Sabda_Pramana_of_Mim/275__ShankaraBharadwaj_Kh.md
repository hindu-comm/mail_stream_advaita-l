Namaste Raghav ji,

Answer to #1 is in #2. Both portions of Sri Suktam are in the RV Khila. Though the second part is not chanted, it is not separated out in RV itself - it is part of Sri Suktam only. However as it is chanted, the question arises as of what part is merely chanted as brahmana, and what part is applied as mantra for homa. For this the best is to run through a complete Sri Sukta homam. 


To take another example, aruna pAtha of Taittireeya Aranyaka has both brAhmana and Aranyaka portions - when an Aruna homa is done, parts of sentence are applied for homa using svAhakAra, and part are merely chanted as brAhmaNa. And some parts of brAhmana do not even have to be chanted - they are instructions and yajamAni should just do them. 

There is no question of portions falling out of Sabda pramANa of mImamsa - just that some portions should be treated as mantra and some portion as brAhmaNa. 

Shankar

Namaste SrI Shankar ji

What you have written is quite interesting. Just to to clarify - 

In your revised understanding, within each passage/sUkta/adhyAya(located be it in either the mantra-samhita, brAhmaNa, Aranyaka etc of each Veda), we could have some portions containing mantra-s plus thepassages explaining the use of those mantra-s in karma which together constitutemImAmsa's sabda pramANa. while other portions/vAkya-s within the same sectionareonly to providecontext and sangatIs and stuti(such passages not beingsabda pramANa per se). Is this right ?

My questions are - in your revised understanding, 

1. how does mImAmsA's sabda pramANa parse a given upaniShad or a sUktaM (maybe you could take a small exampe) ?

2.In the SrI sUktaM, consider the portion from 

A). "hiraNyavarNAM hariNIM suvarNa rajatasrajAM, chandrAm hiraNmayIM lakShmIm jAtavedo ma Avaha ......yasyAM hiraNyam prabhUtam gAvo dAsyo'ashvAN, vindeyaM puruShAnahaM" - this seems to be the mantra-portion.
and then compare with the 

B)The uttara-bhAga giving details of the practice/use of the mantra and also stuti ofDevi with some almost-purANic sounding stuti like "SrI rangadhAmeshvarIM" and "sarva-mangala-mAngalye-shive-sarvArtha-sAdhike" etc., .starting with"yah shuchiH prayato bhUtva yuhuyAd AjyamanvahaM , shriyaH panchadasharcarcam cashrI kAmaH satatam japet"
(On who purifies himself and offers Ajyam to Agnietc....) and ending with "santatamRcA vashat-kRtyaM sandhattam sandhIyate prajayA pashubhiH"

Very often , we don;t even hear the latter part being recited, although the latter portion too has intonations (anudAtta, udAtta, svarita). Do both these portions fall within mImAmsA's sabda-pramANa or are there some vAkya-s within the above 2 portions which don't fall within the purview of mImAmsa's sabda pramANa ?

Also could you post the link to the thread discussed earlier ?

Regards
Raghav

Revisiting this thread, having done some learning. My reading that Mimamsa's sabda pramana covers only the Brahmana part and not Aranyaka/Upanishad was incorrect. It is also incorrect to put all non-samhita portions into Brahmana.

Thus, Samhita has Mantra and Brahmana portions, Brahmana has Mantra and Brahmana portions, and Aranyaka has Mantra and Brahmana portions.
