Revisiting this thread, having done some learning. My reading that Mimamsa's sabda pramana covers only the Brahmana part and not Aranyaka/Upanishad was incorrect. It is also incorrect to put all non-samhita portions into Brahmana. 

Mimamsa's analysis is not at the book level but at a micro level. The mantra/brahmana difference is applicable to each vAkya of the Veda, and is not applicable at a text/section level. Thus, Samhita has Mantra and Brahmana portions, Brahmana has Mantra and Brahmana portions, and Aranyaka has Mantra and Brahmana portions.

Most of the historically earliest upanishads are part of a brahmana.  For 
instance brhadaranyaka (note the name) is the concluding parts of the 
shatapatha brahmana.  In fact its chapters are called brahmanas. 
Taittireyopanishad is the concluding part of the Taittireya Aranyaka which 
itself is the concluding part of the Taittireya Brahmana and so on.
