In the course of reading the bhAShya on brahmasUtra 1.3.29 I noticed that 
the AchArya has quoted a R^ik one of the rare instances where he refers to 
the saMhita portion of shrUti.

yaGYena vAchaH padavIyamAyantAmanvindannR^iShiShu praviShTAm

"With sacrifice they[1] followed the footsteps of vAk[2], and found her 
dwelling within the R^iShis." (R.V. 10.71.3)

[1] the hotR^is or officiating priests in a shrauta yaGYA.

[2] Speech personified.
