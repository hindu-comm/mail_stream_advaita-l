Namaste Raghavji,

/////
Understandably, we have to exercise great caution in this respect because
anyone and everyone can go around claiming to receive vedic-mantras every
other night, including such hilarities like “IshorvedaM”.

The great Rg Vedic Scholar of Pune Mahamahopadhyaya Dattosarma Fotedar
exclaimed in ecstasy after going thru the work "chandodarshana" 
and saidthat after several thousands of years, again 
the Rg Veda was revealed to posterity through the medium of Daivarata. 

Ganapati Muni says as:

vEda draShTA sa bhagavAn brahmarishi brahmaNaspati
vAchaMsaMchO nayatvAshu vEdArthasyaprakAshanE
vEdamAtA bhagavatI shabdabrahma kAparA
tat tvaM prabOdhayatvAshu lEkhanI brahmachOdini
chandOdarshana vEdEsmin daivarAtarShi saMshrutE
vAsiShTAnvaya bhAShyaMvai mantrArthaM bOdhayEdalaM
namastE brahmaNI vAchaM sAkShAt vAchaka shaktayE
vAchyAtma vastu satvAya brahmaNaspatayE namaH

That said there were students in Gokarna Veda Pathasala who used to
learn the vedas & shastras from Daivarata (Hoseman Gajanana Bhatt).
A mahAsOmayAga was also conducted under the supervision of 
Daivarata in Gokarna. 

These people are unsung heroes of bhArata varSha who go unnoticed.....

regs,
sriram
