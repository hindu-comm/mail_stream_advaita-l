Aha I had a feeling this must have come from some other pen than that of 
Swami Sacchidanandendra.  I would be surprised if he used an infelicitous 
word like mere which suggests a negative comparison.

sAshtAnga praNAms Sri Jaldhar Vyas prabhuji
Hare Krishna

I dont think Sri SSS has meant in this way while talking about shAstra 
pramANa.  Anyway, he refutes the interpretation of vyAkhyAnakAra-s  which 
tells us  that some sort of unique experience ( like nirvikalpa samAdhi 
etc.)  is required APART from vedAnta vAkya janita jnAna to make one 
self-realized!!  However Sri SSS talks about shankara's comments in sUtra 
bhAshya (1-1-2)  where he explicitly says : shruti is not the ONLY pramANa 
like in dharma jignAsa but shruti & anubhava etc. are valid pramANa in 
brahma jignAsa.  But here Sri SSS has taken all the pain to explain why 
this 'anubhava' is not an unique experience of some individual at some 
particular point of time. 

Your humble servant
Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
