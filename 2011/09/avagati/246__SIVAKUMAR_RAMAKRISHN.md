SAdara praNAmam,
When you go through the sayings of all the well known realized
MahAthmAs, especially Tamil saints, it can be seen that they
are equivocal that "a scholar will not get moksha.".A scholar just means
that one who has just the mastery over the scriptures,ie.mere 'bookish'
knowledge.
In fact IsAvAsyOpanishath proclaims that those who knows enter
deeper thamas!
BhagavadpAda also says that "sabdajAlam mahAranyam chitta vibhrama
kAranam"in VivekachoodAmani.
