Viprabhandhava,

I am posing this question to all the knowledgeable members

The author Vachaspati mishra in his work Bhamati says

''Not mere knowledge alone is desired but that leads to Avagati or
Sakshataka(direct experience).That which
culminates in Avagati is the object of desire denoted by the suffix san

This is in the context of atman.All the sub commentators of shankara bhashya
did suggest direct experience
as a means of realisation not just mere vedantic knowledge of atman.

What are the means suggested by shankara and other acharyas for this
Avagati?



How does one
