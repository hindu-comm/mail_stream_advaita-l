Aha I had a feeling this must have come from some other pen than that of 
Swami Sacchidanandendra.  I would be surprised if he used an infelicitous 
word like mere which suggests a negative comparison.

It's like if someone said "A private island cannot be bought by a mere 
millionaire."  This does not imply a beggar can buy it right?  If it is 
hard for a millionaire how much more so for a beggar?  No the intent is to 
compare _up_ to, say, a billionaire, not down.

When one has assimilated all the concepts of the shastras, one must give 
them up but not a moment before.
