The following hymn on Ganesha by Adi Shankara proves amply that Adi shankara combined in his writings both poetry,scholarship and Philosophy of Advaita:
 
 Agaja anana padmarkam
 Gajananam aharnisham!
 Aneka dam tam Bhakthanam
Ekadantam upasmahe!!
Here,while chanting we chant "Anekadantam"(aneka dantam-which is actually Aneka dam tam)bhakthanam,which may be taken as 'Bhakthas"with many teeth(with many desires who pray to Ganesha to fulfill them),while Ganesha has only one "tooth"(vakratunda)-which means he is the "Advaita God".
N.Srikanta.
