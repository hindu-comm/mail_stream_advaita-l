vakratunda implies curved trunk not tooth.

praNAms
Hare Krishna

And aneka daMtaM is not exactly bhakta-s with somany teeth, it has to be 
interpreted as aneka = many, dam= bestower, tam= him or something like 
this is it not??  Or I dont know Sanskrit scholars & vyAkaraNa pundits may 
have something else to say on this shloka.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
