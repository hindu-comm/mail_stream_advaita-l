Subject: Re: [Advaita-l] The place of karma in a sadhaka's life (was Re: Pitrupaksha questions)

6)You say that prior to Jnana there has to be Jignasa.Exactly,but I see in this list only those who remain as karminah or those who donot want to think even of Jignasa or worse,not even an attempt is made.It is very easyy to quote from Karma granthas,but very difficult to understand Jnana granths.But,inevitable some one in the list when it comes to the question of Jnana,takes the position of Karmasiddhantin.Evidently they are glued to Karmasiddhanta.This has been proved by the reples of many subscibers in the list.In this way,they are against SriShankara Bhagawathpada under whose name this list has been setup.This is rather unfortunate.
7)You have said that there are many considering their age that SriShankara Bhagawathpada is signignificant for a 16 yyear old member.Infact,When the present generation,the older generation is no exception,whenever they hear of SriShankara Bhagawathpada's name,they consider him one among the Triyumvirates,along with Ramanuja and madhva,without knowing that his contribution called Advaitha is very significant.And,they treat him equal to Rmanuja and Madhva without realising the unique place of Advaita.They say that Vishistadvaita and Dvaita are also vedantha,without knowing the meaning of the term"Vedantha".
8)My intention on the Rituals which are performed by the Purohits as agents is not to denigrade the rituals,nor is it to cast aspersion on the performance of karmas to one's ancestors,but to emphasise that over the years the performaces are riddled with lack of knowledge by the representatives,they getting more avaricious putting the sraddhavans to lot of harassment and turmoil,and the growing apathy of the Dharma sahaya sabhas,and in general the Matadhipathis,whose duty is to guide the aspirants and seekers.This was not the case about say 50 years ago
But today the meemasaka matha is at crossroads..We may not get a handful who can guide a sadhaka to guide him towards realisation.What we see today is some who have an hotch-potch knowledge!In the absence of this,what we need today is to understand SriShankara Bhagawathpada's trachings in their proper persrective without corrupting them.
Finally,I would like to say as a devoted member of this list,it is not my intention to put a member in a fix,much less to put him to embarassment,but it is my sincere wish that the list may become more informative and Lively,without any reservations or inhibitions.I feel that it is our duty to take the Advaita to greater realms of understanding without making it commonplace.I do feel that every member is entitled to voice his views,and stating one's views as per the Advaita siddhanta of sriShankara Bhagawathpada does not in any is an infringement on their rights.
P.S:I would like to add here without the force of my ego,that I have devoted more than 50 years of study in Advaitha vedantha.It started from my own reading on Advaitha,then Swami Chinmayanandaji,J.Krishnamurthi,
Dayananda saraswathiji,Ramachandraji,Brahmakumaris,study groups in Chinmaya mission,Ramana Maharshi,
self study of scriptures,discussion with many so called gurus,and lastly U.G.Krishnamurti.
Regards,
N.Srikanta.
Sir

All very true. Very well said. Extremely elegant and eloquent.

I have been myself an I-think-I-can-grasp-the-essence-of-Upanishads kind of individual you portrayed with the exception of may be looking down upon one's family and so can relate very well to what you said. I changed a bit after those days and wish to thank this list, the moderatorsand all contributors forhelping me stay that way.

I see many in a similar mould and their tendencies being reinforced by most avenues open to them which proclaim to teach advaita, or talk of dharma/purana/itihasa/stotras while claiming to ultimately subscribe to Advaita: a) TV discourses (there are exceptions, but the major bias is towards smart-knowledge-spiritualism), b) Institutions which actively organise discourses and c) even some of the more accessible teachers. I know of a very learned scholar who taught prasthaanatraya bhaashyam spread over five years (with that kind of detail) - and repeated that in different cities / towns - with a decidedly dim view of karma like sandhyavandanam.

It is easy to identify the underlying forces which result in such a bias: the composition of the general public, a large majority of whom have, traditionally, no adhikaara for veda-adhyayana.

In such a situation, words like yours - and almost equallyimportantly, in the engaging manner put by you - need to be heard more.

Best regards
Senani

First of all,Nachiketas didnot go to Naraka where Yamadharmaraja rules because his father didnot give enough gfts to the priests.Nachiketas was determined to meet Yama,and wanted to know from him the secret of Death.Read Katopanishath carefully,and the questions nachiketas asked Yama.
2)You are wrongly quoting me in the choice of Purohits.You have just picked up sentences without seeing the context.When my father died 51 years ago,many samaveda pundits were available who were extrordinary scholars.My father himself A Samaveda professor from the sanskrit Pathasala,himself who was heading the department performed Yaga and Yagnas, expert in the Samaveda lakshana,and written many scholarly books,who was associated with "Svadhyayamandal"which was headed by Mahamahopadhyaya Sripada Damodhara Sathvalekhar at Chalisgaon in Maharashtra near Aurangabad.What I said was during my father's time many Samaveda scholars were available(infact he had trained many pundits),but when my mother passed away 10 years ago,not even one of them were available.I had to go Varanasi to completete the rest of the rituals.There also I could find the same situation.Lack of Shraddha,lack of expertise,only commercial transactions and no concern on the part of the
 Purohits.If some one says it is not so,I am only forced to say that he is blind.

3)What I said was the Manusmrithi now a days is no longer in the same frame as it existed then.
There is no "Bhinnarucih"as far as Jnana is concerned.Either you are there or not.
4)while it is the duty of the advaita list is to highlight Advaita siddhanta,I find there is more emphasis on only karma and the rituals,which will not take us further.So,there should be more space for discussing the topics on Jnana.
5)My discussions on SriShankaraBhagawath pada and the importance of studying and assimilating the books by Sri shankara Bhagawathpada stems from the reply of some of the list subscribers who stick to their point of view irrespective of me pointing out on the contrary.These list members seem to stick to their views even if it is brounght to their notice the Sri Shankara's upadesha on these relevant points.They seem to stick to only the Karma siddhantha which is not any where found in the Bhagawath pada's bhashyas.
