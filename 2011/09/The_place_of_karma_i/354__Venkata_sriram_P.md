//
You say that prior to Jnana there has to be Jignasa

//

Jignasa is not talking about vedanta byshunningsadAchAra & swadharma.

Among the ladder of sapta bhUmikAs, the first rung is shubhEccha. This shubhEccha
germinates vairAgya. This vairAgya should be strengthened withvedanta vichara.
This paves the way for 2nd rung called vichAraNa. Followed by tanumAnasaH, 
sattvApattiH, asaMsakti, padArtha bhAvana, turyagaH. 

To climb the 1st rung in this ladder itself, one should be equipped with sAdhana chatuShTaya. 

So, it is upto themselves to introspect where do they stand in terms of jnAna mArga.

regs,
sriram
