Does it not sound scandalous that somebody else (may be a jnani or ajnani)
certify that one is a jnani.

Ajnani's certificate is worthless. Jnani has neither desire nor the
motive to do it.

No jnani advertises himself. Yajnanavalkya when asked whether he was
the best brahma jnani out of all those present said " I bow to the person
who
is a brahma nishta. But I need the cows."

regards,
Sarma.
