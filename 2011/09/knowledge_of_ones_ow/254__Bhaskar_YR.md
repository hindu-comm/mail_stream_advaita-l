Hare Krishna

According to the book, a disciple may become deluded that he is liberated 
but it is the guru who
confirms that he is liberated. 

>  I would like to read it in this way, if shishya is deluded that he is 
jnAni then guru would come to the rescue of his deluded shishya & educate 
him that he is not yet realized!!  shAstra says, after realization there 
remains no saMshya (bhidyate hrudaya granthim chidhya 'sarva' 
saMshaya)..so, a really realized jnAni would not approach anybody for his 
jnAna certification, he is svAtmAnandaleena & krutakrutya. 

It quotes the case of Narada who though he had realized the absolute on 
realizing the Prana but SanatKumara corrected him.

>  correction required means it is not absoulte paramArtha jnAna, that is 
the reason why sanatkumAra had to teach nArada.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
