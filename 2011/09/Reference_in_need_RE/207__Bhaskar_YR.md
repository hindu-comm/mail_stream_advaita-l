Thank you so much for your reference. I did look into the source you had
referred to but I could not locate this verse in the work. Kindly cite the
actual verse Number and it would be of great help.

praNAms Sri Devanathan prabhuji
Hare Krishna

The translator (Vidvan Sri Ananta Sharma Bhuvana Giri)  gives this quote 
in his introduction.  He has not mentioned the source, he simply says, 
'thus, appaya deekshita says'.  I dont know whether it is in the original 
Sanskrit . Sri appayya deekshita  might have said this in the introduction 
of this same work or in some other works of his. 

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
