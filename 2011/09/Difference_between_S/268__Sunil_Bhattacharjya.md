It does appear that the Patanjali Yogasutra gives a faint indication about Kundalini during Kumbhaka. One has to learn this technique from an experienced guru and that could be the reason why Patanjali did not discuss it. Kundalini is mentioned in Veda and there is also a Yoga-Kundalini Upanishad.

Sir, 


"there is a wider reference or books", "The existence of Kundalini and the chakras are very much true"


is very vague. The question is not how true or valid kundalini yoga itself is - the question is whether pAtanjala yoga is centered on it. It is not.

I would like to know the following :
Patanjali's Yoga darshana contains not only the various padas,but also the explanation of them.You have torefer to the various commentarieson it,Vyasabhashya.It is not necessary that the Yoga sutra mention by the vary word.What we have now on Patanjali yoga sutras are only aphorisms.There is a wider reference or books which mention of the kundalini.I suggest that you refer to some old books.I have seen one published by the Theosophical society.It may bereferred in some Oriental library also.The existence of Kundalini and the chakras
are very much true.
