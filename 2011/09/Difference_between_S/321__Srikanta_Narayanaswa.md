Respected Sir,
I am talking about the Patanjali yoga sutra bhashya consisting of four padas. (The original sanskrit text) We had a discussion and nobody could show any yogasutra reference on Kundalini and chakras.

Kindly throw some light with reference to original text. It will be helpful.
Thanks and regards,
Sudhakar Kabra

What we see in the Yoga sutra is an abridged version that we find of Yoga darshana.With this you will never find the terms you are mentioning.What we find today as Yoga darshana is a set of excercises as Asanas.Infact,we donot find explanations on many aspects.
N.Srikanta.
