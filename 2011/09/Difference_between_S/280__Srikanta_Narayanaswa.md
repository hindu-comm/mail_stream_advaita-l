(Sunil Bhattacharjya in some other thread a while ago mentioned that
purpose of Yoga is to Unite. Sorry for posting this out of context
without giving the link. Actually the purpose of Yoga as in Yoga
Darshana is to *separate* puruSha from prakrti. It helps to achieve
this by integrating the scattered mind and eventually leading to
mano-nAsha)
____________________________________________________________________________________________
With reference to the above,the purpose of "Yoga"in Yogadarshana is to unite Prakrithi with Purusha.The definition of "Yoga"is "Yujyate iti yogah",it is to yoke or unite.The Kundalini shakthi which is in the 'Muladhara"traverses through the different chakras and finally unites with the Purusha in the "sahasrara"chakra which is a thousand petalled Lotus.

It is the "Sankya"(Samyak khyayate iti Sankhyah).It is by discrimination that the Prakriti is separated from Purusha,
through Tarka,and the Prakriti departs from the Purusha,as a "Nartaki"(dancer)moves away from the stage).
This is explained in the Sankhya Karikas by IshwaraKrishna.The manonasha is Budhistic.The difference between
Sankhya darshana from Advaita darshana is,the Sankhya is "nirishwara vada"where as Advaita darshana is "Saishvara vada".If it is by "manonasha"no one will try to perform yoga,because,no mind will be there.
N.Srikanta.
