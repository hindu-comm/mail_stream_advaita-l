With reference to the above,I would like to know from the writer the following points:
By the name,"Patanjala Yoga"what does the writer understand?I want an explanation on many aspects found in "Patanjala Yoga".
1)What is cittavrtti nirodhah?Can the cittavrtti be stopped? 
[Shankar] That is Patanjali's claim. 

2)Infact, Patanjala Yoga or its commentaries doesnot give any explanation on so many points.Can it be explained.?

[Shankar] What are they? 

3)How doyou know that the Patanjala yoga is not centred on Kundalini?

[Shankar] Because Patanjali explicitly mentions what his approach is centered around. 
And there is no mention about shat-cakras or kundalini. So unless one reads Kundalini *into* 
pAtanjala one would not find it. On the other hand, the definition of his yoga, its approach 
are clear and explicit. We need to understand that kundalini is not the only form of yoga. 

4)Unless the questioner know for certain that it is not centred on it,he cannot say that it is not.

[Shankar] I did not just say it, I showed you the difference - the onus of showing it is centered, 
if it is, lies on you. 

5)Can the questioner explain what does Patanjala Yoga is?

[Shankar] I did  - please read my earlier post. 

6)What is Samadhi pada?What is the "Ritambara"prajna foun in Samadi pada?

[Shankar] Please read my previous post - the state of dissolution of dhyAna-dhyeya-dhyatr is samAdhi. 

7)Unless these questions are answered,one cannot come to a definite conclusion.
8)Finally,why is it treated that Sankhya is the theoretical part and Patanjala Yoga darshanam is the practical part of it,and together they form a composite combination?Infact,this has been the view from the list.

[Shankar] Because Sankhya deals with worldview at great length and Yoga deals with methodology.
