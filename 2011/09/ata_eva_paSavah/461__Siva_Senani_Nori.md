Subrahmanian mahodaya

I half agree with you, specifically with the part: "I think a blade of grass is indicated by the word 'tRNam' "; but beg to differ on the other part, namely: "and not 'tRnaH'"

For support, I quote Panini, II.4.31: ardharcaah pumsi ca. 
English vritti given by Ram Nath Sharma: "Items enumerated in the list headed by ardharca 'half a hymn' are both neuter and masculine in gender"
English translation of S C Vasu: "The words 'ardharca' &c. are spoken of inmasculine and neuter." 

There isa gana called 'ardharcaadi gana' given in the ganapaaTha. There amongst many words, triNa occurs. The previous two and the latter two words are in this order: valaya, kusuma, triNa, pa~Nka, kuNDala.

Having said that, I agreethat a complete explanation of the exchange should include the mention of usage in neuter. Thanks for pointing out the same.

Regards
Senani

However, there is a problem: triNa, ending in a, takes the form'triNaah' in nominal plural (prathamaa-bahu-vacanam), not triNavah. paSu being a noun ending in u declines differently.Since theNaiyaayikaas do not grasp thisdifference, the VaiyaakaraNas retort:
