OK.
I was talking the same.

So, I was opposing.

Even then refutation of buddhism is useful because teachings of both
buddha-s are opposed to veda-s.

You are saying this because you think purANa-s are useless imaginations.
If this is so, then why are you considering buddha of purANa-s.
If that's not the case, then you can easily understand why those teachings
are there in purANa-s.

It clearly shows that you have no faith in words of purANa-s.
So, please don't engage in useless controversy of sameness of buddha-s.
You will either end in proving popular buddha imagined or devoid of it's
popular image.

See another thread dealing with paurANika-buddha. It was made clear there.
