Dear Sharmaji, 


God does not teach untruth though it may appear to be so to some. Way back in the mid-fifties when I was 15 my teacher taught me the Dalton's theory of the Atom according to which Atom is the smallest particle. In the late fifties I was taught the structure of the Atom with Neutrons, Protons and Electrons in it. In the early sixties I learnt about the other subatomic particles such as mesons, and neutrinos and also about radioactivityand the list has been expanding with time. Had I stoped learning further after I was 15 I would have remained with my knowledge that the Atom is the smallest particle. Does this mean that my teacher taught me false things at that time. No, never. He taught what was appropriate to my level of understanding. We have to appreciate that these two great persons Lord Buddha and Adi Sankaracharya taught to different groups of people at different times and the courses were not exactly the same. So "apple to apple comparison" is
 not really possible.


Regards,

Sunil KB

I think the people contributing to the discussion have been trying
to equate the two . If the puranic Buddha (the one enumerated in
dasavatars) is not the same one there is no meaning in bringing in
the Sankara's criticism of Buddhism. Neither is there any meaning
in saying that his teaching to discard vedic rituals is to decieve asuras.
By the way this is the only avatara in which God teaches untruth.
We have made the God teach untruth to suit our convictions and convenience.

If they are not the same the same the question arises who is this puranic
Buddha.

regards,
Sarma.
