Pranams,

Some people like A.P.Sinnett believe that Lord Buddha came back as Adi Sankaracharya. It could be that during the time he lived Lord Buddha probably did not want to teach Vedanta and only approached it and it was left to Adi Sankaracharya to tell us the Vedanta in depth.

It is this arihan as buddha is extolled in dasAvatAra stotra.

Hare Krishna

gautama buddha being an epitome of compassion, has been worshipped & 
adored for his sarva bhUta hita / daya. But when it comes to his 
siddhAnta and related matters, his school is pUrvapaxi for advaita. 
Shankara, in his sUtra bhAshya & kArika bhAshya, has vehemently argues 
against the proponents of vijnAna vAda, kshaNika vAda and shUnyavAda.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
