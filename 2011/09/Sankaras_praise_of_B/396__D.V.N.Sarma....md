What I was trying to point out is that Buddha is a historical figure
with incontrovertible evidence for his existence and ministry.
Trying to transport him into mythological story of Tripurasura
samhara to discredit his teaching is immature and naive.
Buddhism is the major religion of Asia and that itself is
sufficient vouch for its credentials.

We have to get out of the habit of thinking that only Hindus are
best in the world in every respect. Objectivity in thought is
really will help us.

regards,
Sarma.
