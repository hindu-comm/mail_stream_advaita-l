True but one common source of interpolation is when an independent work is 
hoisted en masse into another.  This type can be detected by abrupt 
changes in metre or anomalous literary features such as mangalacharana 
where none should occur etc.

Note this is all speculation to one degree or another.  Short of using a 
time machine we cannot prove these things with 100% certainty.  However my 
point is that we often reach too easily for the excuse of "interpolation" 
when our argument with a passage is ideological rather than text-critical.
