is one and the same as the one inducted into Dasavatars.
I think the people contributing to the discussion have been trying
to equate the two . If the puranic Buddha (the one enumerated in
dasavatars) is not the same one there is no meaning in bringing in
the Sankara's criticism of Buddhism. Neither is there any meaning
in saying that his teaching to discard vedic rituals is to decieve asuras.
By the way this is the only avatara in which God teaches untruth.
We have made the God teach untruth to suit our convictions and convenience.

If they are not the same the same the question arises who is this puranic
Buddha.

Sarma.
