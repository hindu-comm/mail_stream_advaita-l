Shankara's personal views about Shakyamuni are clearcut in his sutrabhashya:
" MOREOVER BuddhA exposed his own incoherence in talk when he instructed the

three mutually contradictory theories of the existence of external objects,

existence of consciousness and absolute nihilism; or he showed his malevolence towards all creatures, acting under the delusion that these

creatures would get confused by imbibing contradictory views. "

Note that this stotra was not included in the Vani Vilas edition of the complete works of Shankaracharya. I doubt if it is genuine. Even when Gaudapadacharya gives (albeit backhanded) praise to the Buddha in the Mandukya karikas, Shankaracharya does not follow suit and I'm not aware of any other place where he speaks of the Buddha in a positive way or even at all. (Most of his engagement with Buddhists is with much later philosophers.)

Neither as far as I know has this stotra been commented on by later Advaitins such as Anandagiri or Svayamprakasha. While not a clincher this would be very unlikely if this was an original work of Shankaracharya.

Radhakrishnan had some scholarly credentials but he was first and foremost a politician and this wouldn't be the first time he distorted the truth to fit his personal agenda.
