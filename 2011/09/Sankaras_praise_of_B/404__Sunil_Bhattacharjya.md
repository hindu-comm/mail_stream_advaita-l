Dear Jaldharji,

Many people believe, me included, that Lord Buddha was a real historical figure as real as Lord Krishna was.

Regards,

Sunil KB

Really? As I mentioned previously, Buddhacharita and Lalitavistara were composed many centuries after Shakyamuni. Even the Tripitaka was composed 200 to 450 years later. Perhaps they do nevertheless record the original sayings of the Buddha but you brought up the idea of objective thought. Well, we have no objective reasons to believe someone called Siddhartha Gautama existed only intuitions and surmise.

There are more Christians and Muslims in Asia than Buddhists. Does this mean anything? Should it? I don't think popularity is much of a standard for truth.

This story like all puranic kathas is to teach a point. That being that buddhist teachings are dangerous and likely to lead the sadhaka astray. It doesn't mean that they should not be studied and refuted in a more logical away anymore than the skull and crossbones warning on a bottle of poison means that chemists should not study poison.

I don't know about every respect but the Vedic tradition culminating in Advaita Vedanta is the best in the world at explaining dharma and moksha and it is the standard by which I judge Buddhism and find it wanting. This doesn't mean Buddhists aren't nice people or sincere or interesting. They are simply wrong on the subjects of dharma and moksha as so many others including many "Hindus" are. Employing strict and measurable standard like this firmly and fairly is the essence of objective thought.

In case I wasn't clear what I meant is both the puranic and hagiographical accounts are literary renditions of the life of a possibly historical figure. Neither are factual biographies and neither can be privileged over the other on objective grounds. Therefore we can say there are two Buddha-images to select from and we as a tradition are defined in part by our strong preference for the one where Buddha is a confuser of demons.
