Hare Krishna

gautama buddha being an epitome of compassion, has been worshipped & 
adored for his sarva bhUta hita / daya.  But when it comes to his 
siddhAnta and related matters, his school is pUrvapaxi for advaita. 
Shankara,  in his sUtra bhAshya & kArika bhAshya,  has vehemently argues 
against the proponents of vijnAna vAda, kshaNika vAda and shUnyavAda.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
