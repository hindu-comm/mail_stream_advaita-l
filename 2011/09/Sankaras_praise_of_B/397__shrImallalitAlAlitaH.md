Saying this proves one immature.
We definitely know that buddha of purANa-s and this popular one are not
same.
Purana-s have different stories. That doesn't match this buddha.
amara-koSha also counts two buddhas.
See both.
Now telling that both are same is of no use.
We have discussed it at many different forums and threads.
Forcing us to accept both as same will mean vyAsa came later. That's not a
talk of matures.

Why do you think that Hindu-s are not telling valid things and their
tradition is a non-genuine one ?

We must also get out the habit to think that every non-Hindu is best and we
should accept his views and respect them anyhow.

For us our scriptures are source of valid knowledge. We don't rely on those
proofs only which you know.
