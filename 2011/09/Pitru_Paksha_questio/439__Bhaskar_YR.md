Personally,I feel that if one has come to Vedanta which is the Jnana 
Kandha from the Karma Kandha,and is convinced of the Advaita siddhanta 
that the "Atman is Brahman and eternal",one need not continue to perform 
the shraddha to his ancestors.

I dont think so, one has to follow his svadharma and observe & follow veda 
vihita karma-s (injunctions & prohibitions as enshrined in scriptures)  in 
his respective Ashrama.  If not he will be treated as karma bhrashta. 
pitru karma / shrAddha is one of such karma-s that we should not skip 
saying that I am jnAni.  If this jnAni is gruhastAshrami, he has to follow 
gruhasthAshrama dharma irrespective of his vedAnta jnAna.  He cannot 
observe sarva karma saNyAsa being a gruhasthA.  sarva karma saNyAsa has 
been prescribed only in tureeyAshrama i.e. saNyAsAshrama. 

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
