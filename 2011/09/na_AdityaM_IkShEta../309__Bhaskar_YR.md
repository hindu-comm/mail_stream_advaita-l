Hare Krishna

However, interestingly, during the upanayana saMskAra there is a vidhi 
called 'Aditya darshana' During this vidhi we chant maNtra-s like AdityO 
vA esha etanmandalaM tapati tatra tA etc. from taitireeya AraNyaka / 
mahAnArAyaNa sUryOpAsana maNtra-s.  And in saMkalpa we say 'Aditya maNdala
