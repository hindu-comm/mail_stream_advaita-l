Namaste,

My guruji used to prohibit me from gazing the rising & setting sun and
used to refer the dharma sUtra "na AdityaM IkShEta". 
But i never asked the reason for the prohibit. 

Is this because, Sun fights with mandeha rakshasas or 
something else.

My 8 year old son was eager to take sun-set photos in Kanyakumari 
and when i prohibited him, he asked me the same question why we should 
not take the photos of sunset & sunrise. 

My guruji was very particular on this sUtra and used to offer arghya during 
sunrise & sunset.

Can anybody illumine on this aspect, spirituall & scientifically ?

regs,
sriram
