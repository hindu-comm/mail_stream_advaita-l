Namaste,

//
Does it apply universally?

//

Yes, it applies universally to brahmachArIs who have undergone
the upanayana.GrihasthAs also come in this category
who are desiring of brahmatEjas & Ojas shakti.

However, it seems, there is no dosha to watch the sunrise & sunset
when the brahmacharis are performing agni kArya. 

I was told that gazing the sunrise & sunset results in veerya hAni 
and hence prohibition. But, couldn't find any pramANa for this.

regs,
sriram
