Sri Ramakrishna,

Namaste.

I was talking to Sri Narendra Kapre last evening and he was briefly
explaining the significance of Gyana sukta, including your original question
about not finding the word 'Gnana' in the whole sukta but only 'vaak' in
almost each of the rik mantra.

Another  such co-incidence that you are posthing this email this morning.
Interestingly i have not seen discussed or even mentioned much in totality
(11-12 richaas). At some point would you mind posting your thoughts for the
benefit of all?

It would also help if others too comment on this sukta from Rig Veda.

thanks,

sincerely,
-gopal
