The three important parts of Sraddha are Agnau Karana , Brahmana
Bhojana  and Pinda Pradana .

As Sri Subbu prabhuji said, pANi hOma is in Rigveda saMpradAya  only. The 
yajurvedi-s (which is my sva-shAkha) would do it in agni after 
agnipratishTApana by following chatushpAtra prayOga.  And apart from 
above, tila tarpaNa to pita, pitAmaha & prapitAmaha is also an important 
vidhi in shrAddha karma.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
