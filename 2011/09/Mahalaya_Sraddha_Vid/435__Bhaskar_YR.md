But Tarpana is done only next day after Sraddha.

praNAms
Hare Krishna

We do tila tarpaNAm on the same day only after piNda pradAna & piNda 
visarjana.  We do Achamana, prANAyAma (after wearing the separate 
'pavitra')  do saMkalpa also on that day only before offering the tila 
tarpaNAm.  And during pitru paksha (now it is running till 27th) we offer 
only tila tarpaNa and out of these 15 days, one day we observe as paksha. 

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
