Krunal makhwanaji
When my question was what is karma,you have answered Law of action which is a mere English translation of the sankrit wordWhat are the implements of performing karma?Can you consider eating,drinking sleeping,walking,writing under Karma or does the word karma has a different and deeper significance.?Are these not obligatory as per your definition or do they have different meaning and significance.Are not the above desires?Is the performance of the karmas are as simple as drriving which you have answered?
I hope you bear in mind that I am not patronising you,but bringing the view point to attention.
N.Srikanta.
