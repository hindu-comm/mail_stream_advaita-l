"there is no pratyavaya incurred by its nonperformance"

This is true. 
Do you know if Sankara talks about what, if any, then is the effect of nonperformance of nitya karmas?

"The question is will the mere performance is enough or should it be with the realisation by Jnana as set forth in the BG and Sri Shankara."

In Shankara's view is perfornance of any karma compatible with Jnana?

Finally, in your opinion, based on your thorough and erudite learning of Shankara, can you tell me if a grhastha can continue to discharge his duties towards his family - earn a livelihood, own a house, have a bankbalance - with the abiding nishta of Oneness in Brahman, and avoid nitya/naimittika karmas as they serve him no end, and since mentally he is "akarta"?
