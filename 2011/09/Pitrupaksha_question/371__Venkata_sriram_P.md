If one wants to remain in darkness they only say that.What do they think/They are "sarvajnas"?There are no armchair jnanis I am talking.This is the way this "meemamsaka'mata have grown over the years.

When the people voluntarily joined the advaita-l list, it implies that they don't
want to remain in darkness. At least, i don't want to. Though i am not as knowledgeable as other members in this forum,don't think that i am an illiterate in advaita vedanta. 

They way you address the people and write the mails is highly disturbing & annoying.
Vidya dadAti vinayaM is the AryOkti. The more one is learned, the more humble he
becomes. 

My advice is try to maintain your dignity in this forum and try to follow mita bhAShaNa
& priya bhAShaNa.

ever at the feet of chaNDikA paramEshwari...
sriram
