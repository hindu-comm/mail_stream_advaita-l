Namaste,

The way you lift the referencesand misquote them, is really surprising. 

/////
Sri.Shankara Bhagawath pada says ,no dosha is incurred in this
//

For God's sake, don't misinterpret the Shankara Hridaya which gives a wrong signal.

Non-performance of nityakarma is abhAva and hence there is no 
pratyavAya dosha as pratyavAya dosha is of bhAva swarupa.

But,one cannot avoid the performance of karma be it nitya / naimittika / kAmya.

Since, the person has to perform karma in one form or another, 
even though non-performance of nityakarma doesn't produce any 
pratyavAya, he cannot avoid the performance of laukika karma. 

Moreover, he is likely to perform niShiddha karma accidentally.

So, accidental performance of niShiddha karma & performance of 
laukika karma leads to pratyavAya dOSha as performance of karma 
is bhAva padArtha which yields the result in the form of pApa.

So, nityakarma nullifies this dOSha arising out of the performance of niShiddha & laukika karmAs.

And hence, nityakarma is mandatory.

You are still in LKG level quoting from Garuda purana and other puranas,
//

Yes, i am a mandAdhikAri. Because, i still lack chitta shuddhi, i am into karma kANDa
unlike you who is a jnAna niShTa. For your kind info, the vAkya "jnAnAdeva tu kaivalyaM" 
is from Garuda Purana only so don't underestimate this purana.

One correction in your write up.HHChandrashekhara Bharathi was a Jivanmuktha and certainly,not an avadhutha.Read his life history from many sources available.If wedonot follow the instructions of SriShankara Bhagawathpada,

//

Thanks for reminding us this great jivanmukta and avadhuta as today being His aradhana 
(mahAlaya amAvAsya). We are very intimate with Sringeri Guruparampara and i am 
blessed with holy padukas of Shri Abhinava Vidya Tirtha Swamigal.

I will catch you later after navarAtri as i am into navarAtri vrata dIkSha and would
not engage in futile discussions which only aggravate rAjasika guNAs.

happy navarAtri...

sriram
