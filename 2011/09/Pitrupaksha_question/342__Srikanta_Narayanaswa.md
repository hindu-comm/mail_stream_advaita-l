In that case,will the ritual has validity,scripturally and vedically?

All those questions you put are covered in dharmashastras if you care to look.


> All these goes to show that these Priests follow "anukoola sindhu"for the purpose of extricating money!

This is the kind of jaundiced view that could come straight out of the mouth of a missionary. I am shocked and saddened you could be so cynical. Kindly keep such nastika views away from advaita-l.
Jaldhar vyas.

I am sorry to say that you have read my posting on the "Pitru paksha questions"rather disjointedly and without reading its implications.You have unfortunately mixed up reply with your overtones of karma Khandha and Jnana kandha and your preoccupations about them.your quoting of Jaimini or the Purva mimamsaka views donot have validity in the topic being discussed.I donot have the space to repeat what I have said in answer to sri Bhaskerji and sri praveen Bhattjis questions and views.I hereby entreat you to study them carefully.My views are very clear.what Iam asking is should we continue to take a return journey,when we are an onward journey?should we take an strenuous path when we can take a more easier path based on vedantha?
I hereby take exception to your observation:"This is the kind of jaundiced view that could come straight out of the mouth of a missionary.Iam shocked and saddened you could be so cynical.Kindly keep such nastika views away from Advaita list"

My answer:This is not a jaundiced view.If you consider one who follows Shankara and his upadesha as a misionary,I have no objection to calling myself a missionary,but with a vision.If you call me a nastika,a one who follows Shankara and Advaita siddhanta,it is a myopic view and a canard far from the truth.

PS:My sincere view is the list oflate consists of trivial topics than the Advaita for which it is I hope is meant.
N.Srikanta.
