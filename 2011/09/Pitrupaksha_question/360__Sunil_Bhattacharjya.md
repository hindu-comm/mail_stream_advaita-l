To me it appears as follows: The shraddha performed on the day of the assumption of the sanyasha will be for the purvashrami and not for the sanyashi. The sanyashi's shraddha has to be performed on the day he goes into samadhi, in memory of his departure.

The question asked was not about a person who has formally taken saMnyAsa and the answer was given accordingly. The Sringeri Acharya would have been the first to acknowledge that a saMnyAsin is not necessarily a jnAnin and that all jnAnin-s did not necessarily take to ritual saMnyAsa.

Mind you my pa~nchA~Nga does note that dvAdashI (12th) day of pitR^ipakSha is for shrAddha of sannyasis. (There is a fixed day because as you mention the exact day of death/renunciation might not be known.) Although there may not be a one-to-one correspondence between GYAna and sannyAsa I think in general it is assumed that a sannyAsi is (or ought to be) a GYAni. In any case the point was that contrary to Shrikantajis utilitarian argument Swamiji was arguing it had to be done out of duty whether it is "needed" or not.

To answer the original question, dharmashAstra considers sannyAsa to be legally death. So the shrAddha if it is to be performed would be from the date of assumption of that Ashrama.
