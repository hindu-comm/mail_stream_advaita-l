As you know, Shankara has talked about advaita siddhi and also krama
mukti. Vaishnavas only talk about krama mukti and their conflicting
philosophies inspire the respective followers to aspire for krama
mukti. They, at least the gaudiyas, accept advaita siddhi but equate
it to sayujya treating it as one of the possible experiences of a jiva
like saloka or sarsti. But there is a difference between sayujya and
advaita siddhi, which is attained on rejecting even desire for
sayujya, which itself is based on the ignorant position that there is
one entity that needs to merge in to another.  Bhagavatam says that a
devotee who rejects all desires incl. desire for saloka or even
sayujya attains the very state of Vishnu. For such a jnani (para
bhakta), there is jivan mukti or realization of vaikunta here. Even if
one has bhagavat saksharam, there is fear of separation but for one
who has attained the state of oneness with Vishnu, through atma
jnanam, there is absolute fearlessness.

Shankara establishes  transitive equivalence between maya, ishwara and
brahman and removes the fear of  absolute identity in a dualist
devotee. This fear of identity does not exist in one with sankhya
buddhi.

My 2p.
