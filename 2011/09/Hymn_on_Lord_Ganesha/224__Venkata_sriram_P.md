Mr. Srikantha,

agaja =Mother Parvati;
Anana = Face
Padma = Lotus
Arka = Sun

Just as, the Sun makes the Lotus flower bloom; in the similar way
Son Ganapati (who is compared here with Sun) makes the face of His beloved Mother
Parvati bloom in joy & bliss. 

With the sight of Her son Ganapati, the face of Parvati blooms in joy & hapiness 
because Ganapati is the apple of Her eye and His presence makes Her
delightful. 

As simple as that.

rgs,
sriram
