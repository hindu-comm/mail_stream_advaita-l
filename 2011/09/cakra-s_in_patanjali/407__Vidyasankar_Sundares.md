One should also note the upanishadic references to the nADI-s and
their being centered in the hRdaya in this context. 

However, what many find problematic is that all yoga is a means to
unite prakRti with purusha and that it is accomplished through raising
the kuNDalinI from the mUlAdhAra to sahasrAra. In all the centuries
of yoga and sAMkhya tradition, the emphasis has been that purusha 
and prakRti are two irreducible and separate principles. Liberation is
in the purusha realizing this fact and standing separate from being 
mixed up with prakRti (kaivalya). As such, it is completely novel, to 
say that yoga attempts to unite the two!
