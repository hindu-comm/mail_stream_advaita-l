Namaste,

Direct and indirect references to some cakra-s and atleast 
one nADI is found in yoga sUtra 3.30 (nAbhI cakra), 3.31 
(kaNTha kUpa cakra), 3.32 (kUrma nADI), 3.33 (some cakra 
related phenomenon in head), 3.35 (heart cakra).

But in general, yoga sUtra-s are not explicit about kuNDalinI
and cakra-s.

Another very important point that many people may miss is 
related to kriyA yoga. sAdhanA pAda, in the very first sUtra, 
talks about kriyA yoga. And, the ordering of rest of the sUtra-s 
in sAdhanA pAda can give an impression that the whole sAdhanA 
pAda is, in fact, an unfoldment of kriyA yoga. Then, vibUti 
pAda which is clearly a continuation of sAdhanA pAda, too, 
is an exposition of kriyA yoga. 

In this context, it is then important to realize that kriyA 
yoga, as is known to us today from what various disciples of 
kriyA bAbAji have written, is centered around kuNDalinI and 
cakra-s.

Then, one might suspect, that hidden under the hood of yoga 
sUtra-s, lies the kuNDalinI yoga.

Regards,
Shrinivas
