Namaste Shri Kabra,

I am including the relevant part of my original post, it has
the precise sutra numbers:

"Direct and indirect references to some cakra-s and atleast 
one nADI is found in yoga sUtra 3.30 (nAbhI cakra), 3.31 
(kaNTha kUpa cakra), 3.32 (kUrma nADI), 3.33 (some cakra 
related phenomenon in head), 3.35 (heart cakra)."

What I was suggesting is: The mention of kriyA yoga in the
very first sUtra of sAdhanA pAda may be very significant.
It may very well be that the entire sAdhanA pAda, and vibUti 
pAda together is patanjali's treatise on kriyA yoga.

And then I was suggesting that we try to correlate this
with modern understanding of kriyA yoga.

In keeping with the tradition of vedas, patanjali is, on
purpose, concealing the kuNDalinI yoga within his
yoga sutra-s. I suspect, the topic of kuNDalinI was 
strictly reserved for oral transmission in vedic times. 

Regards,
Shrinivas
