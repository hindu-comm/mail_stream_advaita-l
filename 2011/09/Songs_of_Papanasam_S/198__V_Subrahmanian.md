Namaste

Here is a couple of albums of Papanasam Sivan's (Tamil) selected songs very
nicely rendered by great artistes:

http://ww.smashits.com/gems-of-papanasam-sivan-vol-2/songs-7129.html

There are quite a few songs there in the two albums put together and one can
'select' particular songs or 'select all' and let the divine music go on
even as we are doing our household chores.
(The song 'sri valli devasenapathe' is also there)
