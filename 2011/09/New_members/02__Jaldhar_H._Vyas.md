Nathan
------

Nathan is an avid DIYer, painter and poet.  He currently teaches vedAnta in 
an unlikely setting, maintaining that spiritual life can transform a weekly 
Starbucks gathering into satsa~Nga.

Nathan's advaita path is largely inspired by the Italian master Raphael and 
the teachings of Sri Sringeri Sharada Peetham.

I am a retired professional and enjoy dabbling in philosophical schools and 
Advaita Vedanta is one of my favorites.
