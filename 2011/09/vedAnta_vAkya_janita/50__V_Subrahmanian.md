Jnana from the vedanta vakya is first paroksha and it becomes aparoksha only
when the nididhyasanam is completed.

No. The strong obstacles that have already started their course do not get
eliminated by shravana, etc.

The sutra 'aihikamapyaprastutapratiibandhe taddarshanAt 3.4.51.

The above sutra says that this sadhana will bear fruit only depending upon
the exhaustion, kshaya, of the pratibandha.

Shankara is quite careful when He comments on this verse.  He knows well the
difference He Himself has stated in the BSB between kartru tantra and vastu
tantra.  He gives out the nature of dhyana too in the BGB quote I provided -
'taila dhArAvat'.  The process of dhyana in upasana and Atman is the same;
only the dhyeya vastu is different.  In the former the vastu is something
within the creation, sriShTi and in the latter it is the nitya siddha
Brahman/Atman. In both ekAgratA is crucial. In fact it is only because of
this phenomenon that the shastra prescribes upasanas as a preparation for
the aspirant to finally find it easy when it comes to AtmajnAnaprApti.
