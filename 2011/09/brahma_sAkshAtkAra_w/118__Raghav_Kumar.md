What you have written Sri Vidya ji, is quite interesting. We have 3
alternatives for understanding how the mantra-darSana of the vedanta-vAkya-s
would have taken place for the Rishis -
1 The vAkya-s (just the words) come up chronologically first and then later
the words are understood  by even those very Rishis who uttered the words.
In others words, they themselves figure out/understand the meaning of the
words later ; the words just spontaneously emerge or arise in their minds.
Then the vAkya- (words) are definitely  apaurusheya since the Rishis
themselves cannot have composed them; they just spontaneously arose in their
minds; they themselves later understood what they had "heard" (done
shravanaM).

2. The vAkya and vAkya-janita-pramA arise together simultaneously in their
minds; there is no scope in this alternative for dwelling upon the words in
the form of mananaM etc., to later arrive at samyag-GYAnaM. In this
alternative too, the words of vedanta are apaurusheya. Since they were not
strung together or composed by the Rishis AFTER samyag-GYAnaM. This
alternative is supported by the author of the ratnaprabhA gloss on BSB.

3. The samyag-GYAnam was first arrived at by some means like pratyaxa,
anumAna, nirvikalpa samAdhi or "for no reason". Then this GYAnam was
 explained through mentally composed veda mantra-s. Then the veda mantra-s
can be called paurusheya. But this alternative would be TOTALLY unacceptable
especially for anyone strongly opposed to nirvikalpa samadhi as the means of
GYAnaM. As for the GYAnaM arising for no reason, or through pratyaxa etc.,
such alternatives are even more unacceptable. And if past janma-"shravanaM"
was the cause like VAmadeva etc., the we are back again to alternatives 1 or
2 implying apaurusheyatvaM for the vedanta-vAkya-s.

So, as Bhaskar Prabhuji suggested, since nirivkalpa samAdhi etc cannot at
all be the means to GYAnaM, the words of (alteast) the vedanta vAkya-s have
to necessarily be apaurusheya, especially for those who follow the teachings
of Sri SSS ji. That is nice.
