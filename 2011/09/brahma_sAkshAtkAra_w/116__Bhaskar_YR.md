sAshtAnga praNAms Sri Vidya prabhuji
Hare Krishna

Bhaskar, to me it seems as if you always deliberately impute unnecessary 
extra meanings
to sentences like that quoted above and always bring in a negative 
reference to nirvikalpa
samAdhi.

>  I dont know why you always see only negative intentions in my mails. I 
dont blame you prabhuji for that, it is only my misfortune.  I was just 
trying to say vAkyArtha jnAna or vedAnta vAkya janita jnAna is enough for 
the samyak jnAna & there is no interval between the jnAna & sAkshAtkAra as 
such and mOksha is ajnAna nivrutti only and not a special & afresh 
'darshana' of ever existing Atman. 

It is clear to most of the rest of us that what is meant by vAcaspati 
miSra is the following:

avagati/sAkshAtkAra/samAdhi = transcending the mere knowledge of the words 
and the
sentences as described below and abiding in brahman.

> IMHO, there is a possibility of reading more in these lines for those 
who know that bhAmati compares shravaNa & manana as 'dhAraNa' and 
nidhidhyAsana as dhyAna and darshana as 'samAdhi'.  Anyway, I myself do 
not know much about bhAmati vyAkhyAna prabhuji, but I think I have read 
Sri SSS correctly in vedAnta prakriya pratyabhigna with regard to bhAmati 
stand on this. (Sri SSS takes the bhAmati vyAkhyAnaM printed in nirNaya 
sAgara press). If I am wrongly interpreting these things in the name of 
bhAmati school, I am open for correction prabhuji. 

> Sri Devanathan prabhuji, I believe, is well versed in bhAmati prasthAna, 
if possible I request him to clarify these issues. 

Surely, you can see that there is a qualitative difference of description 
involved here and 
that you are raising a strawman argument and then debunking it. 

>  Again, frankly, I donot know whether these are all mere straw man 
arguments or it has the basis in the bhAmati works.. IMHO, scholars in 
bhAmati vyAkhyAnam, like your goodself & devanAthan prabhuji would be in a 
better position to throw more light on these issues.

Every discussion thread need not be an opportunity for you to reiterate 
the thesis that the bhAmati and vivaraNa
subschools misunderstand the SAnkara bhAshya.

>  I once again apologize if my observation gives you such an impression 
prabhuji. 

Vidyasankar

Your humble servant
Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
