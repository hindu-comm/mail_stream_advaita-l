 What is the difference between this stand and that of nyAya?? The only 
difference as I could see is absence of freedom while exhaling the veda-s 
& he has to act according to who?? which guidelines he would follow?? 
Moreover, this stand (i.e. Ishwara is veda karta)does not escape 
anyOnyAshraya dOsha..veda-s cannot be taken as to be the word of Ishwara 
before the existence of Ishwara is itself established is it not?? And if 
we say the veda-s are the pramANa to establish the Ishwara then it would 
be an argument within the circle of anyOnyAshraya dOsha. How to get rid 
of this problem to prove Ishwara's regulated exhalation of veda-s? Please 
clarify.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
