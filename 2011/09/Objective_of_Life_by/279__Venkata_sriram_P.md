Namaste Siva Garu,

Yes. The sloka you mentioned comes before the one i mentioned. The sloka is:

Namaste Sunil Ji,

Not sure about the original name of kalidasa. It is said that the 
name Kalidasa is the vyAvahArika name which stuck 
because of his intense devotion to Mother Kali. It is also said that 
some of the works of kula tantras and hymns were 
authored by Kalidasa.

Among the propagators of Kashmir Trika Siddhanta, 
Somananda (author of Siva Drishti) taught Kashmir Saivism to 
his disciple who is called Kalidasa. The work "Devi Panchastavi", 
a collection of 5 hymns on Devi is also authored by Kalidasa
but the author, infact seems to be Kalyanacharya.

The work "Chidganana Chandrika", a magnum opus on Kaula Tantra, 
is said to be authored by Kalidasa. He proclaims himself to be a
tAntrika mahApUrNAbhiShikta undergoing the rites & rituals of 
"krama kalpalatha" who has the "AnandanAtha" diksha name. 

He also hints that the word "kAlidAsa" is an adjective which 
is a sort of portfolioconferred to great poets (ref : kAlidAsa padaveem...).
so, what exactly is the name of Kalidasa is still an ambiguity. 

Whoever he may, has given wonderful sAhitya to lovers of literature.

regs,
sriram
