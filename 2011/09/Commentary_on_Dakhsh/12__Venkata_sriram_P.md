Namaste,

May I ask you if you have any information about another Andhra Pandit 
whose works I have come across called Peri Suryanarayana Shastri? (or 
Sharma I don't remember precisely.) He flourished in the 20th century and 
may perhaps be alive today.

//

The name of this great vyAkaraNa shAstra paNDita is Brahmasri Peri Suryanarayana Sastry. He hailed from Nandipilli Agraharam near Visakhapatnam of Andhra Pradesh. 

He has shed his mortal coil long back. 

He was conferred Mahamahopadhyaya in a Shastra Sabha by his gurunatha only. 
His gurunatha's name is Mahamahopadhyaya Peri Venkateshwara Sastry who was 
also a great vyakaraNa shAstra paNDita. 

Peri Venkateshwara Sastry learnt tarka, vyakaraNa, mimamsa & vedanta from Mahamahopadhyaya Tata Subbaraya Sastry of Vizianagaram Samsthanam. 

Subbaraya Sastry was a popular vyAkaraNa scholar in Andhra Pradesh who was also called Prativadi Bhayankara. Subbaraya Sastry's daugher's hand was given to Ganti Balakameshwara Sarma who later took sanyasa and held the yoga patta "Kalyananda Bharati Mantacharya" who established Sringeri Virupaksha Pitha in Guntur.

So. this is the history of Peri Suryanarayana Sastry.

Interestingly, my surname is also "Peri" and my name is Peri Venkata Sriram :))
But we are not their relatives.

regs,
sriram
