Sriram - PraNAms

Thanks for the link. Has he done any work on Adviata Siddhi of Madhusuudana Saraswati? 

Hari Om!
Sadananda

For telugu speaking members, there is a good commentary 
on Dakshinamurty Stotra by Brahmasri Maddulapalli Manikya Sastry Garu.

Here it is:

Shri Manikya Sastry Garu needs no introduction to the 
telugu scholars of Advaita Siddhanta who was a great
scholar of vyakarana, vedanta& tarka. 

It was he who was instrumental in refuting the book"mUlAvidya nirAsana" of SSS
in shAstra sabha in Vijayawadaalongwith Brahmasri Mudigonda Venkatarama Sastry.

Both the above scholars studied in Trilinga Vidya Peetha in Vijayawada under 
the supervision of Mahamahopadhya Vemuri Ramabrahmayya Sastry. 
Other disciples include Brahmasri Suri Ramakoti Sastry, 
BrahmasriKuppa Lakshmavadhani, Brahmasri Vireshwara Krishna Dongre Ji
and other stallwarts. 

The commentary on Dakshinamurty Stotra is under the name of Tattvarahasya Prabha
which is online here. 

Enjoy...

regs,
sriram
