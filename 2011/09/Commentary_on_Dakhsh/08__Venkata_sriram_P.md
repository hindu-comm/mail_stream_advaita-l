Pujya Sadaji,

As far i know, he has not done any work on Advaita Siddhi.

As far as Advaita Siddhi is concerned, there was a great Advaita scholar 
in Andhra Pradesh who was authority in that subject. His name is
Mahamahopadhyaya Rani Narasimha Sastry. I was told that
Shri Narasimha Sastry used to possess an old manuscript of
Advaita Siddhi. 

Shri Narasimha Sastry was such a great authority in Advaita, 
and it was told that he used to mutter unconsciously
Madhusudana's works Siddhi, AnandiyaM,& Advaita Siddhi in deep sleep.
He was such a authority in that subject.Moreover, he was a great srividya 
upasaka. He is none other than the father of our swamiji of Arsha vidya trust
Shri Tattvavidananda Saraswati Ji.

Shri Tattvavidananda Saraswati (whose purvashrama name is 
Shri Rani Ramakrishna Garu) is the elder son of Shri Rani Narasimha Sastry
and had undergone the study of Panini Ashtadhyi alongwith Mahabhashya,
Siddhanta Kaumudi, all the 82 pannAs of Krishna Yajurveda, Prasthana-traya
under his esteemed father Shri R.Narasimha Sastry Garu. 

We are fortunate to have Shri Tattvavidananda Ji among us who is also easily accessible
to us without any air of ego around him. His Holiness also hold Ph.D degree in
Organic Chemistry. So, swamiji has mastered both parA & aparA vidyAs 

Another authority in Advaita Siddhi is none other than Shri Goda Venkateshwara Sastry Ji.
And it seems Shri Godaji also wrote commentary & published it. 

So, as far as Advaita Siddhi is concerned, the above two scholars can be contacted
personally.

regs,
Sriram
