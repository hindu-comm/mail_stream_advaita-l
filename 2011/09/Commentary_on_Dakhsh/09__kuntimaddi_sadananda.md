Shree Sriram - PraNAms

In fact Shree Goda Sastriji was teaching me whenever he could, when I was in Chennai. He normally teaches in Tamil but took special classes for me in Telugu/English. I do not think he has written any book on it. I will be seeing him when I go there in the middle of October. I have to request him to resume the classes if he can. Shree Anand Hudli has written some but he stopped after the first definition of falsity. I have other books but all of them are difficult to read in the way theywere written.

Anyway thanks for the info provided. 

Hari Om!
Sadananda

Another authority in Advaita Siddhi is none other than Shri Goda Venkateshwara Sastry Ji.
And it seems Shri Godaji also wrote commentary & published it.
