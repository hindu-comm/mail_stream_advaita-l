May I ask you if you have any information about another Andhra Pandit 
whose works I have come across called Peri Suryanarayana Shastri? (or 
Sharma I don't remember precisely.)  He flourished in the 20th century and 
may perhaps be alive today.

He wrote a commentary on Khandadevas' Bhattarahasya in Mimamsa and 
Bhushanasara  in Vyakarana and possibly other works on shastras.
