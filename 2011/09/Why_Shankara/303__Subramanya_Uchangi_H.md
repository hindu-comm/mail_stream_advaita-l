There is a book titled " How to recognise  the Method of Vedanta" by Sri Sri
Sri Satchidanandendra Saraswathi Swamiji of Holenarasipur, which is
available on their web site by clicking the following link. It is in djVu
format . You can down load it.

further the link given in the mail takes to Satchidanandendra only and hence
the desired book may be same what is wanted and not that of Alston
