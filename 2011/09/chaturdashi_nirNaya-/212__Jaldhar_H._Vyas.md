According to nirNayasindhu quoting kAlamAdhava,

udaye trimuhUrtApi grAhyAnantavrate tithiH |

"The ananta vrata should be performed when the [14th] tithi is prevailing 
three muhurtas [144 minutes) after sunrise."

so it would seem Sunday is the correctt day in India.  In the USA sunrise 
is at 6:34am EDT and at 8:58am chaturdashi is already in progress so 
Saturday would be the correct day.
