Thanks for the clarification. 

Strange are the ways of karma & dharma jignAsa is it not??  just y'day 
night one of the local jyOtisha pundit categorically asserted that ananta 
padmanAbha vrataM can be observed on both days.  He explained,  if you are 
doing vrataM on Saturday you have to start the pooja in chaturdashi tithi 
i.e. after 11 AM and if it is Sunday Pooja should finish before 11.55 coz. 
chaturdashi lasts till that time only on Sunday.  And he said since the 
vyApti of chaturdashi is more on Saturday, it is preferable to do the 
vratam on Saturday :-)) 

 kAlAya tasmai namaH :-))

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
