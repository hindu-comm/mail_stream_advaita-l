Namaste,

The entire creation is a product of agni (fire) & sOma (moon) who 
represent bhOkta & bhOjya tattvas (ref: agni-ShomIyAtmakaM idaM jagat)
This sOma has nourishing nectar in itself that is responsible for 
anna (food) & auShadhi (medicinal plants) vriddhiwhich in turn result 
in sapta-dhAtu vriddhi. Thus, the sOma bestows ojas, virya, tejas.

The Shakta Tantra (Annadakalpa Tantra) extols this Agni to be Siva and 
Soma to be Mother Annapurna. Her form holding porridge in one hand and a spoon
in other represents Her benevolent nature who is ever intent in
nourishing Her children.

The most beautiful and enchanting forms of Mother Annapurna
are only in two places. One is in Kasi and other is in Hornadu
near Sringeri. 

Here are some hymns on Mother Annapurna from Sanskrit Documents
