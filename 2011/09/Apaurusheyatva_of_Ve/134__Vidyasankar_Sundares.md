Not so. apaurusheyatva pertains to the texts, not to the historicity or otherwise
of the seer of the texts. 

Even if one lived five hundred years ago, and believed that the earth came into
existence with human beings living on it from time t=0, one would have had to
accept that (a) human beings have finite lifespan, (b) some human beings saw
the veda and were the Rshis, and (c) the seers of the veda spanned many
generations. This is part of the traditional view itself. 

Accepting that the Rshis of the veda lived in time and space is not incompatible
with not accepting specific dates for the composition of the vedas. It really does
not matter when or where or how the Rshis lived. What matters is that they saw
the veda-s and yet the veda-s are not considered to be their own compositions.
