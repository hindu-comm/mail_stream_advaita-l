It is a brilliant explanation. But one can argue that the naturalistic
explanation for the formation of world (big bang) and life  (evolution) are
simpler and based on observed phenomena. So, one should accept scientific
theory instead of Purusha Suktam or Puranic descriptions, which involves
more complex and unseen forces. If one accepts the scientific theory, then
there is no evidence for God or eternal scriptures. These are simply recent
human inventions in the long span of time - just blind beliefs. How does
Shankara counter atheism based on scientific thinking? Which schools of
ancient thought are closest to the philosophy of modern science? It is
probably a separate thread.

Note: I know the Gaudiya Vaishnava counter to the philosophy of modern
science and their justification for the use of the products of scientific
thinking. It is good but not water-tight.
