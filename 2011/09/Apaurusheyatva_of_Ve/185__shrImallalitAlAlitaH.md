This is your thinking. We know him otherwise.
He doesn't want us to indulge us in 'useless arguments' .
And we are definitely not in any useless thing.

So, what do idiots do.

Commoners always blame scholars, because they can't understand them.

Just to people like you.

We know what advaitam is and what it needs to achieve.
We need not learn it from a 'commoner'.
How could a layman expect to teach correct path to specialists ?

Actually you failed to grasp subject of our 'noise'. We were making noise
about apauruSheyatvam and not about 'nothing'.

We can see your silence but it was out of reverence or ignorance is not
determined, even when you are telling.

Then please maintain your silence. Don't break it ever again.

Yea, you are a commoner, I remember.
You are great. You know that others are posing. I smell same with you. You
are posing as greater than scholars.

You don't know about pramANa, prAmANya, apauruSheyatva, etc. and their
importance in vedAnta and sha~Nkara's view.

Are you forcing us to teach you ?
We don't teach a person who just utters anything and understands nothing.

Don't ever try to waste time of scholars here with you useless words.
We better know what to do and what to not.

So, you have understood and taught us.
And you were posing to learn something from us.
See problems with in you.

I've to say one thing specially for you :
Keep away from such discussions and don't read them. We like minded people
know value of discussion and sha~Nkara too. We enjoy explaining his view and
testing his every statement. We are definitely not forcing you to read and
be disturbed.
And always remember that it's a discussion group of advaita vedAnta
according to veda-s and sha~Nkara. We have no interest in discussing
according to you.
