nirvikalpa samAdhi is not accepted by vedanta as a mean of knowledge or
emancipation. 

> "Though it is not a means of knowledge, the Atmaikatva jnAna what we 
gained through vedAnta vAkya shravaNa, would be 'literally' experienced in 
nirvikalpa samAdhi, then only you will come to know that you are one 
without second" so says some of the authoritative voices in advaita 
vedAnta.

See refutation in bR^ihadAraNyaka-bhAShyam itself.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!

PS :  I think we are digressing from the subject matter by discussing all
