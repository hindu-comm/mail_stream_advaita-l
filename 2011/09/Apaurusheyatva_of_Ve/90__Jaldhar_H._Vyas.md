Why?  All we need to know is the transmission occured.

In popular culture we have many notions about the Rshis but the Mimamsakas 
themselves are silent on how or why the they "saw" mantras.  They did 
that's all.

In theistic traditions (including "Hindu" ones like nyaya-vaisheshika as 
was pointed out.) _who_ does the revealing is of paramount importance. 
The key difference here is we don't particularly care.

Maybe some primordial molecules combined to form more complex ones which 
began self-replicating which became bacteria which became plants which 
became animals which became mammals which became primates which became men 
who saw mantras.  It's as good an explanation as any.
