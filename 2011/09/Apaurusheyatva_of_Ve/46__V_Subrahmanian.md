In the Bh.Gita Bhashya 11.54 the bhashyam says:

भक्त्या त्वनन्यया शक्यमहमेवंविधोऽर्जुन।

ज्ञातुं दृष्टुं च तत्त्वेन प्रवेष्टुं च परंतप।।11.54।।

 न केवलं ज्ञातुं शास्त्रतः, *द्रष्टुं च साक्षात्कर्तुं तत्त्वेन तत्त्वतः*,
प्रवेष्टुं च मोक्षं च गन्तुं परंतप।

In the Br.Up.mantra on आत्मा वा अरे द्रष्टव्यः श्रोतव्यो, मन्तव्यो,
निदिध्यासितव्यः..Shankara, while commenting, after explaining each of the
elements involved there: shravaNa, etc. says: एवं हि असौ दृष्टो भवति, न
श्रवणमात्रेण । (only when shravaNa, manana and nididhyAsana)..are performed
does the Atman become 'seen' and not by mere shravaNa.

We can see the word 'dRShTaH' of the bhashyam and the words 'draShTavyaH' of
the Up. and the word 'draShTum' of the Gita verse are in the same sense and
context.  From the two bhashyam quotes it is clear beyond any doubt that for
Shankara 'Atma darshanam' means nothing other than 'sAkShAtkara'.
