Who said you that vedAntin-s not reply this question and prefer to be silent
?
It was repeated many times that veda-s existed in seed form in Ishvara.
We don't fear to accept Ishvara, etc. which are naturally supernatural.

Now, the question is why are you trying to accept veda-s devoid of any
relation to supernatural ?

Another question you may ask to us is what is proof for Ishvara, etc.
supernatural things ?
The answer is again shabda, i.e. veda, purANa, etc. and supporting
inference.
Q : How could veda-s, etc. prove Ishvara before being proved as apauruSheya
?
A : veda-s, etc. don't prove anything because they are apauruSheya. They do
it because they are independent pramANa having innate validity.
Q : I've doubts about Ishvara, etc. supernaturals. So, veda-s can't be said
pramANa regarding those.
A : You can remove your doubts with inference used by naiyAyika-s.
Q : I don't see any supernatural. So, they don't exist.
A : When you say that something can be supernatural, you have to accept that
it will not be seen by you naturally. And do you not accept motherhood of
you mother because you didn't see him giving birth to you ?
etc.

Ishvara revealed to brahmA.


> and 'who' had supernormal vision,


If experience = vision. Then no one had this.
Exact words of veda-s are accepted to be remembered by Ishvara and then
transferred to brahmA. And then they were transferred to R^iShis by brahmA.

What other option is there in theory?


Shown above.

Oh god, thanks.

But, Revelation = transfer by teaching.
We have full faith in Ishvara.
We respect R^iShis too.
But this faith or respect is not a part of pramANa. pramANas generate
knowledge because they have innate capacity to do this.

I would keep the origin of life separate from evolutionary theory, because

That common decent is GOD. If anything else, it will difficult to prove for
anyone.
Another common thing among us may be pR^ithvi, etc.
