What about the words of a person who is saying something after seeing it ?


> It depends on the faith


Saying that a pramANa needs faith shows that you are not accepting it as
pramANa.
Don't say shabda as pramANa, instead use some other word for not confusing
others.
Moreover, every other pramANa needs faith in this way. What if you have no
faith in your eyes ?

Everyone knows that knowledge of conditions of Iraq is born of words. But,
words are based on pratyaxa of reporter.

Say 'in all pramANa-s' instead. I'm following your foot-prints, sir.

This shows that you have no idea of meaning of word pramANa according to any
tradition.

People who are not biased should not follow any faith without testing. And
faith on 'mere words' telling something alaukika is impossible for anyone
with a sound mind.

By saying 'not required', I think, you mean for you and people like you. If
so, then true. Believers don't need any test of anything, just like Muslims
and Christians.

GYAnam is called vastu-tantram. Saying it 'not puruSha-tantram' doesn't make
it apauruSheya.
apauruSheyatvam is a term used for denoting a special quality of pramANa-s
and it doesn't say anything about knowledge. This is what we use in
scriptural-talks. If you are using it for GYAnam, either you don't know what
it means or you have some free thoughts. I was expecting talk according to
scriptures.

These all were replied directly or indirectly in previous posts.
