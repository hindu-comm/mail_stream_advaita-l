<<<My argument is that the rishis separated by time and space, with no known contact between
each other, have come up with the same mantras.... I agree with the need to go beyond logic but
the attempt is to establish only using objective data and logic.>>>

Doesn't this claim (of there being multiple seers who saw the same mantras) itself require faith, not that different from the claims of the Buddha or Mahavira having some special vision? How does logic and objective data show the above?

<<<Indological research shows that over 60 generations of 423 rishis
have discovered many common mantras.>>>

I would appreciate some pointers to this,

Regards,

Omkar
