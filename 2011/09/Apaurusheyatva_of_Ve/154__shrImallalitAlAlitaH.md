Your words clearly say that you were unable to grasp the meaning of thread
and so imagined a new theory to question.
No one of us ever said that veda-s are apauruSheya because they are
svataH-pramANam.
Where will it lead you ? Let us see....
As we said that every knowledge is svataH-pramANam, so every knowledge will
become apauruSheya.
But, that was never said.
We only said that every knowledge is svataH-pramANam and apauruSheyatvam of
veda-s is a mean to sustain/maintain/hold/ it.
So, your question is wrong.

Now, the query which was actually meant by meant :
How could we prove that veda-s are apauruSheya ?
See a anumANa-prayoga by mImAMsaka-s :
veda-s are apuruSheya, because they are coming from anAdi-paramparA and
their author is unknown.
