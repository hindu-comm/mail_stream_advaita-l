Read portion of his post and then my post. You will be able to understand
the cause of my comments.
If you can't then I can't do anything more.

I can't exhaust myself anymore.


---------------
Sriman - with all due respects, I did study your post and frankly I do agree with Shree Bhaskarji comments in this regard. I was letting it go without making any further comments since I find a dead end, and was even surprised that shree Bhaskarji made the comment. 

In principle ifI say something wrong witha post, but I cannot explain it, and others who have not expressed their opinion can explain it, then obviously there is something wrong inmy statement. I have no interst in finding fault with anybody but if I am wrong in my understanding, I must know. 

If anyone elsecould find fault with the pratyaksha pramANa aspect that I mentoned and that Shreeman shreemallalitaalaalitaH says he finds it wrong but could not explain it what that is, I will be more than happy to know, since I have been examining the epistemological issues for some time and for that reason only studied Vedanta Paribhaasha and writing critical analysis of it. 

Hari Om!
Sadananda
