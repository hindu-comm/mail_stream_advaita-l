* I did not say that the words of Totakacharya are Vedas. My point is that
vedas, as sabda brahman, exist without ANY dependency on an external person
to know them and can be revealed to someone without formal means of learning
such as rote. We have contemporary examples of that and cited Totakacharya
as a classic example. If knowledge is not an entity, it cannot be given. All
knowledge will only be a memory of an experience as in mundane learning. *
