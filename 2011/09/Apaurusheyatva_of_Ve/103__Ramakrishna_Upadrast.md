Thanks for the nice explanation Shri Ramesh-ji and the kind words as
well. Thanks to Shri LalitalalitaH for starting with the thread and
sticking to the right stand from the beginning.

praNAms to all who participated in this discussion. Really made us
understand many concepts. Reading the threads on this topic would
clarify the topic on which we have misunderstandings, on a topic that
is as important and fundamental as this.

We cannot but be in awe at the genuis of pUrva-mImAMsakaa-s, who have
created such a flawless axiomatic system, which we vedantins are
using, almost assuming it to be given.

namaste
Ramakrishna
