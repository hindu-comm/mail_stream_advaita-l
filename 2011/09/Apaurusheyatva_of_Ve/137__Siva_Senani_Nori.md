>- Yoga approves of the three pramANas in sAN~khya, and within sAN~khya, the three pramANas of pratyaksha, anumaana and Sabda are accepted. They are not derived from pratyaksha. Interestingly,sAN~khya proves Prakriti and Purusha, the equivalents ofmaaya and Brahman of Advaita in a manner of speaking (note the qaulifier phrase; the 'equivalence' suggestionis only to draw attention: it is not my thesis), using inference, not Sabda pramaaNa, and it uses Vedas to believe in Indra, svarga and apsaras as they cannot be seen or inferred. So in a way,all the neo-Vedantins who do not need the Veda to know or understand the existence of Brahman, are nearer to the position of of sAN~khya on this point.(ज्ञानादेव कैवल्यम्, the concept so comforting for those who do not have patience for the karma-kaaNDA is the motive of sAN~khya as well - or, to start with #).The kaarika and the bhaashya of Gaudapaada with the
 translation of H. T. Colebrooke and H. H. Wilson* are given below:

># 'to start with' is applicable only for those who believe that Gaudapadaacharya is the first one to state / explain /defend / expoundthe Advaita philosophy; for those (including me)who believe that Advaita is the actual truth, that it is what is propounded by mantra-drashTas, that it is what is ackowledged by other Saastrakaaras like Yaaska, Paanini, Kaatyaayana, Patanjali and Bhartrihari (all pre-Gaudapaada as per modern historians), 'to start with' is inapplicable. I am inclined to believe in my present state of knowledgethat Sabdabrahman is a special way of presenting the parabrahman and that it has been criticised by Sankaraacharya to avoid roopabrahman, rasabrahman etc. (which all are equally special cases of presenting parabrahman).
