I will take these up in a separate, third, post and deal with the 
historicity or
otherwise of names and places mentioned in the vedas. 

sAshtAnga praNAms Sri Vidya prabhuji
Hare Krishna

Thanks for taking time to clarify these issues.   I eagerly await your 
clarifications prabhuji.   If possible, kindly address, why in veda-s 
places, rivers, mountains & names of persons/Rishi-s etc. that can be 
traceable only in & around the bharata khanda.  why there is no mention of 
other places at other parts of the world??  For example,  there is lot of 
mention about ganga, saraswati rivers in veda-s but  why there is no 
mention of nile river?? Kindly bear with me, I may, again & again,  ask 
stupid questions likes this with regard to this topic.

Your humble servant
Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
