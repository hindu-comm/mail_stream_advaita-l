In a separate post, I will take up a few other points and hopefully 
highlight the small ways
in which pUrva mImAMsA and vedAnta differ in their approach to the 
apaurusheyatva of the
veda. 

sAshtAnga praNAms Sri Vidya prabhuji
Hare Krishna

As always, you are crystal clear in your articulation of thoughts 
prabhuji.  I could able to follow & understand your presentation with 
regard to svataH pramANa and its intricacies.  But still to this dull wit, 
it is not clear how svataH pramANyata  would prove the vedas' 
aparusheyatva!!??  If this apaurusheyatva is not kevala shraddhAmAtra & 
commandment like " Accept it without any question or get lost" from the 
traditionalists, I would request you to clarify this in a simple language 
that can be understandable to novices like me.

Thank you very much for your help & patience prabhuji.

Your humble servant
Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
