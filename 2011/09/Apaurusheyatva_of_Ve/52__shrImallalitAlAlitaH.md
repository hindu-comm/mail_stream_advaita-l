Using words of purANa-s, etc. , as kalpa, breath of Ishvara, etc., confuses
us.
Are you talking according to scriptures or present evidences ?
If first, see scriptures for answer.
If last, There is no question of Ishvara, his breath, loka, kalpa, etc. So,
don't talk about them.

If you accept brahmA, then accept yugAdi-kAla-gaNanA too. As scriptures say
that it was transferred to manu, etc., in kalpAdi. So, there is no doubt
about time.

You will need to provide scriptural evidences to prove it. If scriptures say
that veda-s were taught to R^iShis by brahmA, then there is no room for your
theory.

What is this 'darshana' ? And how it happens ?
Please, provide only scriptural evidences.

Why are you sparing vedAntin-s ?
They too accept veda-paramparA running from kalpAdI...

I support you. But, you shouldn't try to stick to things like veda, Ishvara,
R^iShi, darshana, etc.
