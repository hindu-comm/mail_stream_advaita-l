If you think so please explain why.

But you can say that about anything.

And yet the Rshis did try to explain it in logical terms.  Why if only 
faith is necessary?

Note that both the Mimamsakas and the Vedantins agree that it is not just 
the ideas but the actual words of Shruti and their meanings which are 
apaurusheya and eternal.  (See brahmasutra 1.3.29 and the bhashya thereon.)

And by agree with Vedanta we mean agree with the jnanakanda of Shruti.  So 
even these secondary shastras depend vicariously on the apaurusheyatva of 
Shruti.

The mimamsakas anticipated this line of thinking.  The rejoinder is just 
because at any given point of time there might be confusion about the 
meaning of a particular word does not imply that there is no fixed eternal 
meaning.  The various sampradayas do disagree on some details it is true 
but what is remarkable is how much they _do_ agree on.  If the meaning of 
words were only transient conventions then there ought to be much more 
diversity of opinion than there actually is.  But note this is not an 
argument about apaurusheyatva at all which only means that shruti is 
"authorless" nothing more.

Also na vAka gachhati etc. do not mean words cannot reveal the truth but 
only the truth is not exhausted by words alone.  Even the famous neti neti 
is followed by a positive statement atha nAmadheyam satyasya satyamiti

The desire for liberation depends on shravana manana and nidhidhyAsana of 
the shastras.  When that desire has been kindled, one should approach a 
guru who is _shrotrIya_ and brahmaniShTha.  In other words the choice is 
not shastra or Guru it is shastra _then_ guru.

That knowledge is eternal is as much dependant on faith as apauresheyatva 
and eternality I'm afraid.  That's why logic is applied to support both.

One other thing...

No.  Here is a counter-example.  Shruti says the shrauta yajna called 
ishTi should be performed on the darSha (new moon) and pUrNimA (full moon) 
days.  However to know the phase of the moon one looks at the sky at night 
time not in a book or in other words uses pratyakSha pramana.  mImAMsa and 
vedAnta are the application of pratyakSha and anumAna pramanas to alaukika 
topics.  (See brahma sUtra 4.4.20 for example.)

apaurusheyatva is a logical attempt to explain why Shruti is "authorless" 
that's all.  Throughout this thread people have been making more out of 
this than is actually there.
