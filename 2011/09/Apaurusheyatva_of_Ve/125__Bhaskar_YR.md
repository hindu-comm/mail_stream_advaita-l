What is the basis of the belief that the Vedas are anadi and were not 
created by Isvara? An answer is contained in the Vedas themselves. In the 
Brhadaranyaka Upanishad(2. 4. 10) ---the Upanishads are all part of the 
Vedas---it is said that the Rg, Yajus and Sama Vedas are the very breath 
of Isarva. The word "nihsvasitam"is used here. 

It goes without saying that we cannot live even a moment without 
breathing. The Vedas are the life-breath of the Paramatman who is an 
eternal living Reality. It follows that the Vedas exist together with him 
as his breath.

As said earlier, the exhalation of Ishwara not only contains mere veda-s 
but also  itihAsa, purAna, vyAkaraNa, jyOtisha etc.  If we take 
nishvAsitaM is the only pramANa to prove apaurusheyatva then we have to 
say along with veda-s whatever text mentioned in that exhalation is also 
aparusheya.  But that is not the case here.  apaurusheyatvaM has been 
exclusively attributed to ONLY veda-s and we treat itihAsa, purANAdi-s as 
paurusheya grantha-s.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
