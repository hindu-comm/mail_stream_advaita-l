भक्त्या त्वनन्यया 
शक्यमहमेवंविधोऽर्जुन।

ज्ञातुं दृष्टुं च तत्त्वेन प्रवेष्टुं च 
परंतप।।11.54।।

 न केवलं ज्ञातुं शास्त्रतः, *द्रष्टुं च 
साक्षात्कर्तुं तत्त्वेन तत्त्वतः*,
प्रवेष्टुं च मोक्षं च गन्तुं परंतप।

>  I dont know what you have quoted above in Sanskrit except 11.54 
:-))...You can see your self above it is full of computer characters, 
atleast in future give English transliteration while quoting big big 
Sanskrit sentences. 

In the Br.Up.mantra on आत्मा वा अरे द्रष्टव्यः 
श्रोतव्यो, मन्तव्यो,
निदिध्यासितव्यः..Shankara, while commenting, after 
explaining each of the
elements involved there: shravaNa, etc. says: एवं हि असौ 
दृष्टो भवति, न
श्रवणमात्रेण । (only when shravaNa, manana and 
nididhyAsana)..are performed
does the Atman become 'seen' and not by mere shravaNa.

>  If you are talking about AtmA vA are shrOtavyaH, maNtavyO, 
nidhidhyAsitavyaH etc. in br.up. mantra and shankara's comment on that 'na 
shravaNamAtreNa' etc. then it is quite evident that in that bhAshya 
shankara saying that ekatva of all the three i.e. shravaNa, manana & 
nidhidhyAsana would fetch us the brahma ekatva or samyagdarshana..this is 
quite acceptable that those who are not uttamAdhikAri-s have to 
subsequently undertake sAdhana-s like manana & nidhidhyAsana.  But dont 
you know shankara also says elsewhere that iha paravidyA vishaye, 
'vAkyArthajnAnasamakAla eva tu paryavasitO bhavati' (is it in mundaka ?? )

We can see the word 'dRShTaH' of the bhashyam and the words 'draShTavyaH' 
of
the Up. and the word 'draShTum' of the Gita verse are in the same sense 
and
context.  From the two bhashyam quotes it is clear beyond any doubt that 
for
Shankara 'Atma darshanam' means nothing other than 'sAkShAtkara'.

>  Here Atma sAkshAtkAra/darshanaM does not mean, seeing Atma as an 
objective reality or experiencing the Atman in a mind inert state like 
samAdhi.  anAtmani Atmabuddhi nivruttAveva..na tu brahma jnAne yatnaH 
clarifies shankara...

>  Anyway, we can keep these things for discussion later...let us 
concentrate on the subject on hand..i.e. aparusheyatva of veda-s. 

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
