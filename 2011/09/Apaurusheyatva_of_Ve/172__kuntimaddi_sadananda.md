Shree shreemallallitalaalitaH - PraNAms

In response to your comments I suggest ou yto look into say Vedanta Paribhaasha where the nature of each pramANa is thoroughly discussed. 

Shabda is purely faith as far as the listener is concerned. From the point of the teacher, the prameya that is being communicated could depend on other pramANas including sabda depending on the nature of that knowledge he is communicating using the shabda. That is not part of the shabda pramANa analysis. Thus how the reporter found of the fact is still a faith on the part of the listener who is gaining the knowledge of the prameyam from shabda pramANa that is by listening to the reporter. In the courtof it is called hearsay evidence- not valid as direct proof of the fact. 

Shabda as a faith is acceptedas pramANa if the faith is strong enough. Even in Vedanta it requires a frame of mind to acceptit as pramANa. If it is accepted as true, everybody would have realized by now. Shravana and manana are required to establish faith in the statements of the pramANa since what is being said iscounter to the normal experience - hence the interpretation of even- atat tvam asi - too exists.

Sorry I am nottrying to confuse anybody nor intend to dothat. What I stated is what I understood based on PramANa analysis. If I am wrong, will be happy to change. I have discussed the pramANasextensively in the critical analysis of Vedanta paribhaasha.You can findthediscussion up toupamaana in the attached url

Hope this helps

What about the words of a person who is saying something after seeing it ?


> It depends on the faith


Saying that a pramANa needs faith shows that you are not accepting it as
pramANa.
Don't say shabda as pramANa, instead use some other word for not confusing
others.
Moreover, every other pramANa needs faith in this way. What if you have no
faith in your eyes ?

Everyone knows that knowledge of conditions of Iraq is born of words. But,
words are based on pratyaxa of reporter.

Say 'in all pramANa-s' instead. I'm following your foot-prints, sir.

This shows that you have no idea of meaning of word pramANa according to any
tradition.

People who are not biased should not follow any faith without testing. And
faith on 'mere words' telling something alaukika is impossible for anyone
with a sound mind.

By saying 'not required', I think, you mean for you and people like you. If
so, then true. Believers don't need any test of anything, just like Muslims
and Christians.

GYAnam is called vastu-tantram. Saying it 'not puruSha-tantram' doesn't make
it apauruSheya.
apauruSheyatvam is a term used for denoting a special quality of pramANa-s
and it doesn't say anything about knowledge. This is what we use in
scriptural-talks. If you are using it for GYAnam, either you don't know what
it means or you have some free thoughts. I was expecting talk according to
scriptures.

These all were replied directly or indirectly in previous posts.
