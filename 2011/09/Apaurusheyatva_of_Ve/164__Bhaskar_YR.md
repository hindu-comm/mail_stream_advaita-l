sAshtAnga praNAms Sri Jaldhar Vyas prabhuji
Hare Krishna

Sri Vyas prabhuji :

No more than the claim "The Republic of India became independant in 1947" 
requires faith.  I wasn't there.  It could all be a big lie but 
trustworthy people say they were there and confirm it.

>  I dont think testimony of 'AptavAkya' would be the authority to prove 
aparusheyatva.  This again, unlike '1947 independence' which has been well 
documented apart from eye witnesses, warrants a further verification with 
another pramANa.  For example, if some 'Apta-s'( who we trust)  say there 
is some celestial being playing chess with a villager on the other side of 
the world, the truth of the statement would have to be ascertained by 
actual perception or some other means of right knowledge.  Otherwise it 
would remain as 'belief' in aptA-s and conviction that they wont say 
anything wrong...IMHO, this is nothing but mere 'faith' in the words of 
someone who we deeply respect & trust & taking their words about the 
unknown & unverifiable issues without any verification. 

Historically we can see the Vedic tradition has been unbroken and the 
texts are preserved in a remarkably pristine state.  So barring specific 
instances where a breach is suspected, we can trust the parampara.

> so, prabhuji,  vedas' aparusheyatva  is the currency which is floating 
within tradition ??  Can this belief system within paraMpara would 
withstand the 'logical' attacks of outsiders to prove otherwise??  What 
would be the justification we provide to prove aparusheyatva of veda-s to 
outsiders, who would like to take this issue & debate outside the 
restricted traditional circle?? 

>  Kindly pardon me prabhuji, I know I am arguing this issue against my 
heart which beats in favor of aparusheyatva but my mind still quite 
curious to know if there is any possibility to prove this beyond any 
doubt!!

Your Humble servant
Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
