Do you mean to say that lesser time gap is an ingredient of prAmANya of
shabda ?

Doubting authenticity of sources is enough to destroy it's validity. Time
gap is not only thing capable of this.

I already said that he was only citing that shabda is a pramANa and nothing
else.

Correct. As long as you don't feel conflict, the first knowledge is taken as
valid. This is svataH-prAmANyam common to any pramANa.

They may not be essentially telling truth.
He already said that a doubt will be enough to destroy validity of those
records.
So is the case of veda-s.
So, both cases are similar and hence need of faith in not new to shabda
pramANa or is not a weakness. Moreover, faith is needed in eyes too. What if
you start doubting your eyes ? You just believe that your eyes are OK and
they only generate correct knowledge. Same faith thing.

No.

Thanks for providing this.

No.

nyAya and mImAMsA, both schools accept veda-words just repeated by R^iShis.

Authored by Ishvara and not R^iShis.
They are also refuted by mImAMsakas.

vaidika-s either accept them authored by Ishvara or un-authored. So, both
views are meant by word 'paramparA'.
