You are correct.
But, you were taught wrong thing.
Actually, svataH-prAmANya-vAda removes every barrier and apauruSheyatva is
just need to save it. So, apauruSheyatva is not the sole cause of prAmANyam.
prAmANyam is innate to pramANa-s.
Now, as authority of veda-s and every other pramANa is innate, when one
comes with a doubt about authority of veda-s it is removed by
apauruSheyatva, eternal relation of word and meaning, etc. to save the
innate thing.

And for our friend supporting view of faith as cause of prAmANyam :
I didn't wish to reply to shatter away your belief-system, but as you are
thought as an advaitin, I expect you to provide exact words from any
scripture(including your favorite vedAnta-paribhAShA) to support your view
that any pramANa(not only shabda) needs faith. Your free view have no value
as I already showed flaws in it. Reading my previous posts will be helpful.
