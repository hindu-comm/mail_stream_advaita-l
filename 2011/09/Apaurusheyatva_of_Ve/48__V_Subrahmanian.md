I thought you were able to read Devanagari on your computer.  At least so
far you have not complained about this.  This is the bhashyam, in part, for
the BG verse 11.54:

// na kevalam jnAtum shAstrataH, draShTum cha sAkShAtkartum tattvena
tattvataH, praveShTum cha mokSham cha gantum cha parantapa//

I showed this vAkyam for its containing the word 'sAkShAtkArtum'.

This is when there are no pratibandhaka-s.  If they are present, even if
vAkyArthajnAna takes place avidyAnivRtti rUpa mokSha does not come about.
He may have to wait for one or more births  for the pratibandhaka to end.
BSB is clear about this.

I have not claimed that it is an 'objective reality'.  I am aware of the
fact that Atma is not an object but one's subject. Despite that
clarification Shankara has happily commented upon the Gita verse: 'dhyAnena
Atmani pashyanti kechit AtmAnam AtmanA..' of the 13 chapter.  Here is the
translation of Sw.Gambhirananda for the relevant portion of the Acharya's
Bhashyam:

//13.25 Dhyanena, through meditation: Meditation means contemplation (on the
Self) after withdrawing into the mind with concentration the organs of
hearing etc. from the objects like sound etc., and then withdrawing the mind
into the indwelling conscious Self. Thus, from the citation of such
illustrations as, 'the crane meditates, as it were, 'the earth meditates, as
it were; the mountains meditate, as it were' (Ch. 7.6.1), it follows that
meditation is a constant and uninterrupted current of thought like a line of
pouring oil. Through that meditation, kecit, some yogis; pasyanti, realize;
the indwelling conscious atmaanam, Self; atmani, in (their) intellect;
aatmanaa, with the help of the internal organ that has been purified by
meditation.//
