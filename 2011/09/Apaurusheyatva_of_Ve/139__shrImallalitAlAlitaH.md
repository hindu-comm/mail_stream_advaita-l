Search for errors in each. If any one is devoid of errors, go with that. If
both have errors, leave them and search third one without that.

I'm amazed by use of words by you and some others. You and they appear to
suggest that some schools invented some theories to support their view
without having any logic behind it. They created theories to suit their
motives. They were either idiots or fanatics. They were not pursuing
knowledge devoid of errors. And, we people are without any bias. We know
more than them. We know that they were not logicians, etc. but
believers.etc.
That is not the case. As you people have tendency to follow truth, so was
theirs.

Now, answer to your question :
See reply to K. Sadananda's post which was posted by me.
