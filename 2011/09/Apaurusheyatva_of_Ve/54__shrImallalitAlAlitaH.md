Same way you don't need faith to say that you know svarga with veda-s.

It is self-evident there too.
Think again.

No.

No. Anything as such can be refuted easily by anyone.

You know the answer now.

Any pramANa, including veda, do no depend upon other.

They may conflict.
As dvaita perceived with eyes is opposed to veda-s.

As it has been cleared in other posts that faith in pramANa-s is innate and
it is basis of svataH-prAmANya-vAda, you have to accept same force in both
sentences, of that tradition and of veda-s.
Again, shraddhA is not weakenss of any pramANa and it is innate.
Now, how to prove that veda-s have more force and can refute other tradition
-
1. We will check claims of that tradition of being anAdi.
a. if it is truly anAdi,
then we will check it's origin and find faults.
If it is faultless, we will check faults in paramparA.
if it is faultless, then it has same force as veda-s and we will have to
search for such meanings that they don't get conflicted.
b. if it is not anAdi, then other tradition will loose points.
There is no need to be biased. Just follow as a logician does.

But, as no such tradition exists, any further claim of being anAdi will make
it subject of doubt of following lines of veda-s to show it's words
flawless. This is enough to show that it is tainted with ill will. And it
will prove it apramANa.

No.

Every pramANa is svataH-pramANam. We are not specific about veda-s. Do you
expect people like us to be biased ? We are definitely not.

Replied already.

They have no knowledge of veda-s, pramANa-s, prAmANyam, etc. according to
tradition. So, they are not Astika-s, but followers of Astika. Don't equate
both.
They accept because they have no way to test it or no ability to find errors
in it or they don't feel that this theory is in conflict with veda-pramANa.

Read purANa-s to know it.

Yea. That may be.

Yes.

OK.
I'm happy to see your post and your clarifications.

Not essentially in gurukulam of brahmA, but in of others R^ishis too.
So, they didn't study ???
Not everything can be expected to be told in scriptures.
