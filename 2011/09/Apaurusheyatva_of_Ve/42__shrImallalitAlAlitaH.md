No. You just need to take veda-s as pramANa for these things.

Yes. But, that's because we know that they are based on veda-s.
So, it means that pauruSheya texts have some problem while dealing with
alaukika things.
If you don't feel this, then you are full shraddhA in them and you must
check basis of your shraddhA so that it remains so.

Yes. Because it is impossible to believe words of man dealing with alaukika
things. Anyone can say anything. Anyone can declare himself a seer. etc.

Replied.
You say it's logically unjustifiable. OK.
Tell me your assumptions about pramANa, shabda, prAmANya, veda,
pauruSheyatva, etc.
How much of tradition you accept and why ? What are the problems which
indicate that apauruSheyatvam is unjustifiable ?

You can't be a sampradAyavAdin if you say apauruSheyatva unjustifiable.
Don't be confused and don't confuse us.
The answer to your question is :
Purpose of any pramANa is to generate valid knowledge. So, if veda-s, one of
pramANas, fail to do this without apauruSheyatvam, then it is clear that
answer to your question is YES. If not, then no.

There is no proof for it.
You can not show any R^iShi perfect, as someone said.
There is no proof that they were 'documented haphazardly'. You should try to
get to decision on the basis of facts provided by veda-s, purANa-s and
paramparA. Don't try to invent facts.
There are no claims in those scriptures where you heard about vyAsa doing
arrangement that vedA-s were 'first revealed' to R^iShis. Instead they say
that veda-s were given to brahmA by Ishvara and he gave to manu,etc.

We accept. But that's because they depend on veda-s.

If you have greater level of shraddhA in these, you don't need anything
else.
But, this discussion is not for pure-hearted people who have lot of
shraddhA.
We are here because we lack shraddhA in prAmANya of veda-s without
apauruSheyatva and in prAmANya of smR^itis without veda-s as their source.

You can not prove that vAmadeva, etc. were 'mahAGYAni-s'. It appears to
people other than you and alike that he was mad and uttering anything,
mostly opposed to pramANas.
This is the problem.
Anyone can explain it, so I leave it to them.
