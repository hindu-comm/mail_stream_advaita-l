<<<Apureshyatva of vedas I think was mainly intended to indicate that There isno Pouresheya Dosha. A book written by an individual may have his intention
along with it. May be over emphasis or if an injunction is given it may be
perceived as given out of greed or with ulterior motives. Such a dosha cant
be there in Vedas.>>>

Namaskara,

Since an apauruSheya text is lacking not only puruSha-doShas but also puruSha-guNas, it is not clear that apauruSheyatva helps in claiming the Vedas as flawless.

Generally, it makes sense to look at only "absence of an author's doShas" to consider the text an authority because absence of doShas implies the presence of guNas in the author. If we say the cause of flaws (ignorance, ulterior motives, etc) is absent, it's always the case that the cause of validity is present (knowledge, benign motives, etc in the author). This principle is derived from authored texts and can't be extrapolated (by induction) to unauthored texts, because in an apauruSheya text, not only are doShas of an author missing, but guNas of an author are also missing. So logically speaking, there is no guarantee that apauruSheyatva of a text implies flawlessness of its sentences.

Regards,

Omkar
