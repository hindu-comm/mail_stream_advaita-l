Shreeman - PraNAms

In a way yes. Shraddhaa gets ingrained since baby as she grows and develops faith in the words of the first teacher - the mother. That I cannot see, nor prove by the logic that I know, I tend to accept based on the trustworthyness of the teacher that is teaching me - is this not true? The mental frame to accept is essential ingradient for shraddha and therefore much emphasis on the four fold qualifications for brahma jignaasaa. 

Hari Om!
Sadananda

'words of shAstra nad gutu are true' - this determination is shraddhA.
But, tell me it's origin.
Again shraddhA is cause of such shraddhA ??
