It was already replied. svataH-prAmANyam is the answer.

There is no less logic used in establishing authority of veda-s.
Now, the change is that we are more and more dependent on 'now available
resources', as fossils, etc. As long as we have 2000 years old evidence, we
are not going to accept anything older than it existed. This is rigidness
and not logic.
And philological evidences were never out of doubt-area. Same is the case of
evolution theory. Search of internet about both will lead to many results.
Moreover, evolution theory is difficult to prove. It's mere a different
belief system for most of us.

So, for those who have faith in evolution theory, there is no Ishvara, no
anAdi and apauruSheya veda. So, trying to mix two different systems will
take you nowhere.

Sticking to one will at least provide mental peace as one of elderly member
of our group is enjoying(because of his faith).

They were with Ishvara in the form of seed, if you accept Ishvara.

Ishvara transferred veda-s to heart of brahmA, and he gave it to other
R^iShis through guru-paramparA. purANa-s may help you more.

If apauruSheyatva, Ishvara, brahmA and transfer of veda-s to R^iShi-s are
taken as mere case of faith, it will mean that they didn't exist at all. And
trying to justify them is a useless job.

So, what's the way ?
First of all determine that pramaNa-s do not need faith.
Second shabda is a pramANa.
Third svataH-prAmANyam.
Fourth apauruSheyatvam.
It will make you understand stand of mImAMsaka-s and vedAntin-s.
