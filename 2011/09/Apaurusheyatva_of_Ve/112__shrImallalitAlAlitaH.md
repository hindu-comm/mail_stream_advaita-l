nirvikalpa samAdhi is not accepted by vedanta as a mean of knowledge or
emancipation. See refutation in bR^ihadAraNyaka-bhAShyam itself.
Regarding sAxAtkAra,
as long as one doesn't clarify it's meaning and means, it will be just a
rumor for us spread by neo-vedAntin-s.
as soon as it is clarified, we will show how it is against tradition.
