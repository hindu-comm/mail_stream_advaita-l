I've actually nothing more to say.
I hope deep analysis of your own views will reveal problems and you will be
able to understand them.
I didn't fail to show errors at all. I told with clarity which is expected
at this level. If one can't understand my words while talking these things,
then he should blame his capacity and not me.
And what is amazing if I asked anothers too help you(yes, you and not me).
Difficult things were always explained by commentators for people lacking
proper understanding.
Bhaskar also comes in your category.
