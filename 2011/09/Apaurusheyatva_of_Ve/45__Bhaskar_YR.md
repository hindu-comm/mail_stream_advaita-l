Really, there ends the matter. In the pUrva mImAMsA system, the 
apaurusheyatva of the
veda and its validity as a pramANa that is independent of pratyaksha, 
anumAna etc are quite
axiomatic. You either accept the axiom if you want to get further into the 
system or you reject
it, that is all.

Kindly pardon me prabhuji I am hastening my reply without waiting for your 
subsequent mails. You have said above that 'apaurusheyatva of veda-s are 
axiomatic.  Is this the pronunciation of pUrvamimAmsaka-s  just to counter 
the arguments of nyAya & bauddha-s prabhuji??  Is this unconditional 
acceptance of the axiom (i.e. veda-s are aparusheya) necessary to move on 
further into the system prabhuji??  If one doubts & wants to question this 
axiom  but still wants to get further into the system treating it 
otherwise ( as we do in smruti texts), would saMpradAya allow him to do 
that prabhuji??  Is this rejection of apaurusheyatva (with all good 
reasons!!)  would anyway affect the sanctity of veda-s in sAmprAdAyik view 
& hamper the aspirant's progress in sAdhana based on veda mArga prabhuji?? 
 Pls. clarify.

Your humble servant 
Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
