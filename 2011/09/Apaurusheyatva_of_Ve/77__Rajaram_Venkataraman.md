It is indeed surprising that the apaureshyatvam of the Vedas is being
debated. It shows the adverse influence of indological research on even our
traditional scholars. As shabda brahman, the Vedas transcendental to
spacio-temporal limitations. The fact that they describe aspects within
spacio-temporal space does not make them subordinate to the latter. For
those traditions (incl. advaita) that accept Ishwara exists and that Vedas
are co-existent with Him, their eternality and non-authorship are a given.
