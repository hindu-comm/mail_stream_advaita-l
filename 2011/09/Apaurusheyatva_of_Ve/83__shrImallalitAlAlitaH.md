We can't come there, because if it is not pramANam we will be getting
nothing and wasting our life.

Sure, it will change.
Don't you start following elders when you determine that they speak truth
and wish your good ?
Same is in this case. Once veda-s are determined as pramANam (because they
are apauruSheya), we will start thinking meaning of it and following it.

Actually this question shows that you are a pure believer.

Traditionalists have different approach to veda-s than you. They are using
them in their daily life.
Your lack of knowledge doesn't prove that it's not used.
If you mean that veda-s are not used according to your view, then I will
like to say that there are very few chances that your view will get hold of
traditionalist.

Yes.

You will need to study vedAntam.

I don't know.

Who told. I don't think anyone who is a part of discussion said it.
veda-s are great, because they are apauruSheya and hence mean of valid
knowledge.

It may be. But, we have saved many.
I read your post somewhere about 'viniyoga'. I can't say that it was in
accordance to tradition.

That's not the case.
Those advaitins who say such are useless or else they mean something
different.

It doesn't appear that you want to know our stand. It feels that you have
reached determination already. So, plain answers for you is:
No use for you, sir.

We will come to vaikharI later.

If they really meant it then they are not aupaniShada-s. They are just
believers.
If they don't, then you were unable to understand.

If it is different from tradition, then definitely not ours.

Same is the case of traditional explanation of veda-s.

If you read before and after this part of verse, you will find many
evidences to oppose your own view.

We are doing according tradition. Sorry, that we are not following your
newer views.
