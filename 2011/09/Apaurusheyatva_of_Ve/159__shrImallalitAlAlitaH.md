One more thing to make clear for all :
When we say 'veda-s are devoid of puruSha-guNa and puruSha-doSha' then we
mean that as there is no puruSha = a person who first used words without
depending on words of that category.
As kAlidAsa said 'sa rAjyaM guruNA dattam', etc. without hearing same words
from any other source. So he is said creator of that word in this specific
sense.
When we negate entry of puruSha, including Ishvara, in veda-s , we mean to
say that even Ishvara didn't say veda-s without hearing it. So, he is not
it's creator. And if he is not creator of veda-s , he can't affect authority
of veda-s positively or negatively because of his guNa or doSha.
If a pramANa word is uttered by a man of low character, it will not become
apramANa. You may have doubts because of vaktA, but it's innate nature,
prAmANyam, is never affected or destroyed. It is just barred.
In the same way, repeating veda-s by Ishvara or shUdra doesn't affect it's
validity.

No doubt that pratyaksha is essential even for the shabda to operate.


There are two types of words,i.e. shabda - pramANa-shabda and
apramANa-shabda.
For birth of both pratyaxa is needed when it's subject is something
pratyaxa.
So, you can't say that pratyaxa is also cause of prAmANya residing in
pramANa-shabda. Because, it is also cause of aprAmANya of apramANa-shabda. A
common cause of two opposite things is not counted as 'cause'. Otherwise,
taking breath will become cause of moxa.
So, pratyaxa is not needed for prAmANyam of shabda at all. It is needed for
birth of substratum of prAmANyam, i.e of shabda, that too in specific cases.
