i dont think i need to respond for such acrimonius a bit boisterous and a
bit poisonous provocative , inciting and irritating  and exciting reply too
,as if the world is only for vedantins and scholars....rebuking and barking
on every sentence instead of admiring and correcting ....authoritatively
arrogant can not be the attitude of pundits,scholars and imposters....the
teachings of  "BajaGovindam" is lost in the wind with people like u ...am
sorry to say...that however great you are ....a pundit , a scholar, a
vedantin, or anything else, nothing travels ultimately during the Jiva
Journey to Brahmatvam....that is my gutsy feeling....you  might have or
delberately attacked me with your scintillating choicy words but you have
attacked only my body and  senses and not beyond that including my
intellect....i thought the intellectuals are fully accomplished persons  but
unfotunately you have prooved the other way about it...thanks i dont need to
respond and i resign form this membership of advaita fourm..which spoils the
the very purpose of my joining....good riddens for me....better to be in the
company of idiots and fools than arrogant pseudo intellectuals....
your explanation of :


We know what advaitam is and what it needs to achieve.---- am sure how you
are belittling the GREAT ADI.SHANKARACHARYA.... let me better stop at this
.

"Dharmo Rakshati Rakshataka " if you protect Dharma , then Dharma will
protect you ...
hence, please dont ever even attack others by your prowess on literature.and
vedanta
..is not intended for that ....LET GOD PUNISH THOSE WHO ARE ARROGANT TO THE
CORE..... thanks and bye but please do take care of your health.....dont
allow the blood to gush down your throat....with fire.....be cool as a
cucumber......sorry if i had hurt you unknowingly as am only an idiot in
your parlance ...thanks for the compliments....god bless.....
