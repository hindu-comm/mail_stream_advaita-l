replace 'auditory data' with 'validity of knowledge generated shabda'.
To be clear for further postings :
pramA : valid knowledge , i.e, anadhigata-abAdhitArtha-viShayakaM GYAnam.
pramANam : cause of pramA, i.e, eye, words, etc.
prAmANyam : Validity , a special quality of knowledge which makes it valid.

A bit of misunderstanding.
read : (i.e, mutual dependence of pramANa-s to determine prAmANyam in each
other.)

As I've made clear, I was actually talking of prAmANya-paratastva-vAda and
not svatastva-vAda. So, this part is not correct.

prAmANyam is made clear above. Please see.

Yes.
But, that is not important. We don't have any idea about future conflicts
while knowledge is generated and we do our works based on it, so we do our
works based on that knowledge without any problem. The 'non-finality' is
only revealed when we apply logic as we are doing here.
So, clearly any tradition, either of mImAMsaka-s or others, was talking
about pramANa-s which are useful to determine 'artha' for 'vyavahAra'. We
never specially talked about 'absolute' pramANa, prAmANyam, etc. We talked
in general which applied to 'absolute' pramANa, prAmANya, etc. too.
This is what Omkar is missing while saying - 'The observation in itself does
not prove that svataH-prAmANya is the 'right' epistemology.' He is expecting
to decide absolute validity and absolutely valid knowledge, while we were
talking about 'valid till refuted' knowledge and validity till refutation.
I expected him to point out. But, it's rAgahv who has given me a chance to
say that. Thank you again, rAghav, for reading my posts.

All knowledge derived from the

replave 'svataH-pramANa-s' with 'pramANas' .

(including pratyaxa) is provisional


provisional = valid till refutation

Very true.

Nice. Good observation.

Yes. We are talking about 'default' thing and not 'absolute'.

I hope traditional views and their logic is quite clear now.
