Also, experience (anubhava) has a role in exegesis of the shruti and not 
in
verifying it. Atmaj~nAna is not a particular experience but an 
understanding
that the non-dual Atman is the very content of *every* experience or
cognition. This is really what is meant by aparokSha j~nAna or
aparokShAnubhUti.

That is really well said prabhuji.  But I reckon, some school take a 
different step from the above.  According to them, mere vedAnta jnAna does 
not suffice this jnAna has to culminate in the 'experience' like 
nirvikalpa samAdhi / sAkshAtkAra  etc.  You might have noticed the recent 
thread on 'avagati' with regard to this.  I am quoting for your ready 
reference from Sri praveen kumar's mail :

//quote//

The author Vachaspati mishra in his work Bhamati says

''Not mere knowledge alone is desired but that leads to Avagati or
Sakshataka(direct experience).That which
culminates in Avagati is the object of desire denoted by the suffix san

This is in the context of atman.All the sub commentators of shankara 
bhashya
did suggest direct experience
as a means of realisation not just mere vedantic knowledge of atman.

Apart from this, I have myself heard from one of the respected members 
that veda/vedAnta-s are like operation & instruction manual !!??

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
