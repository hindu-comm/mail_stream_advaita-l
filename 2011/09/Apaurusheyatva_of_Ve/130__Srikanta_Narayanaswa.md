In the above topic two aspects are discussed,whether vedas are apaurusheya or paurusheya?
Ther are certains pramanas to decide whther they are paurusheya or apaurusheya.
Take for example a piece of Alum.It can be mistaken for a piece of "sugar piece".Unless it is verified it is not possible to know that it is not a piece of sugar,but Alum.The knowledge that it is Alum comes from the validity of knowledge that it is Alum.This is svatahpramanyam.To know that it is not sugar piece,but Alum is paratahpramanam.Any knowledge has to be selfexplanatory.All knowledge must result in final understanding or final validity.
N.Srikanta.
