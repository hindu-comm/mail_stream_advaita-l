The following is my argument for apaurusheyâ€‹atva of veda. Pl. correct me if
it is wrong. If vedas are apaurusheya, they should exist independent of any
purusha or person. That is they have to exist as an entity in their own
right with the same words and meter. Such an independent existence can be
proved only if two persons removed in space and time discover the same
mantra. Indological research shows that over 60 generations of 423 rishis
have discovered many common mantras. This is very different and unique in
human history. There are many instances of two or more people coming up with
similar ideas (e.g.  calculus by Newton and Leibnitz) but they are not
exactly the same in form and content. On the  other hand, some of the Veda
mantras discovered by different rishis are exactly the same to the meter.
