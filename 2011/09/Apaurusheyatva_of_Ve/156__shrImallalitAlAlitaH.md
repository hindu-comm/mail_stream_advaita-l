Ohh ! I missed it , the last sentence here.

If you accept that prAmANyam is naturally revealed,i.e, svataH-prAmANya-vAda
is true because it is observed to happen so; then there is no need to say
that it doesn't,i.e, prAmANya-paratastva-vAda is correct.
I'm just making clear by showing actual meaning of words. Observe closely.
