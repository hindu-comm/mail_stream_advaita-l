But regarding things that are beyond the reach of the senses, the Veda is 
the
authority.

praNAms Sri Ananda Hudli prabhuji
Hare Krishna

Yes, you are absolutely right prabhuji.  Shankara also says since 
veda/shAstra is the pramANa for the jnAna which can be 
attainable/realizable  here in this very life, it also holds as the 
pramANa for the lOkAteeta / indriyAteeta anubhava like svargAdi lOka. But 
for this do we have to invariably tie apaurusheyatva tag to veda-s 
prabhuji??  or is it individual preference without specific insistence 
from the tradition??  For that matter, indriyAteeta or ateendriya 
anubhava-s like aNimAdi siddhi-s in ashtAnga yoga's,  yOga shAstra/sUtra-s 
which is paurusheya grantha is pramANa and we have accepted it & somany 
other paurusheya grantha-s without any reservation is it not?? IMHO, just 
questioning the origin of the vedA-s donot harm the validity and authority 
that it carries since the time immemorial in veda saMpradAya.  And more 
importantly, it does not anyway mean that those who questioning the veda-s 
apaurusheyatva are trying to belittle the efficacy of it in the brahma 
jignAsa.  Kindly share your thoughts on this prabhuji.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
