Note that both the Mimamsakas and the Vedantins agree that it is not just 
the ideas but the actual words of Shruti and their meanings which are 
apaurusheya and eternal.  (See brahmasutra 1.3.29 and the bhashya 
thereon.)

Kindly clarify what are the justifications shankara provides for vedA-s 
apaurusheyatva, as far I remember here in this adhikaraNa shankara talks 
about veda nityatva (eternality)  and not about veda apaurusheyatva per se 
and adhikAra of devata-s in obtaining brahma jnana. 

One more doubt,   if all the words & its svara-s (intonations) of veda-s 
are apaurusheya why some say Rig veda is the 'oldest' among veda-s??  why 
the same maNtra with different svara-s??  rigveda maNtra svara-s are 
widely different from yajurveda maNtra-s.  For example gAyatri maNtra...we 
say gAyatri maNtra drashtAra is rishi vishvAmitra, which of the maNtra he 
has seen first??   is it rigveda gAyatri maNtra or yajurveda gAyatri 
maNtra??  Moreover, at the end of bruhadAraNyaka there is a big list of 
jnAni rishi-s (obviously jnani-s names,  which we know very well like 
shankara, ramaNa etc. missing here) with their father & grand father names 
and there is plenty of stories in veda bhAga & various diologues between 
shishya-guru, father-son etc. on various topics and there is a mention of 
tools like nail cutter etc. dont you think all these prompt us to think 
that veda-s composed at certain point of time & after all these incidents 
& characters. 

Kindly pardon me if my doubts are too naive.

Your humble servant
Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
