 I don't know basis of your statement. I'll need exact words from bhAShyam
of vyAsa or any other AchArya on yoga-sUtram to confirm it.

Anyway, I've asked some specialist and he said that 'pratyaxa is independent
and others depend on it' - is said yogin-s and nothing else. It doesn't mean
prAmANya too depends on pratyaxam.

What I know is :
sA~NkhyavAdin-s say that prAmANyam and aprAmANyam both are innate.
naiyAyika-s say both are regulated by other.
bauddha-s say aprAmANyam is innate and prAmANyam needs others.
mImAMsaka-s say opposite.

Anyway, I'm replying your question(by asking some questions).
Why pratyaxa is svataH-pramANa and others not ?
