Dear Sri Omkar,

Sri Vidyasankar is going to make three posts. Should you wait for him to
complete before responding? In the meantime, it may be worthwhile  for you
to research in to apaureshyatvam according to different schools of thought.
And compile your objections. It is just a suggestion to improve the quality
of discussion.

Best Regards
Rajaram Venkataramani
