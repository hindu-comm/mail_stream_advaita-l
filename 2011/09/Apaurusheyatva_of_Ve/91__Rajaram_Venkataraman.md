someone on this list equated sraddha in vedas with that in other
systems of thought or religions. I wanted to point out that the
existence of heaven and hell cannot be verified while living but jivan
mukti can be. this is a non-trivial difference. the second major
difference is that you cannot get the commandments or quran revealed
to you. but you can access vedic knowledge without the aid of books or
formal teachings. there are contemporaries who have done that and been
kind enough to share their experience. totakacharya is a classic
example.
