<<<someone on this list equated sraddha in vedas with that in other
systems of thought or religions. I wanted to point out that the
existence of heaven and hell cannot be verified while living but jivan
mukti can be.>>>

This goes back to my point that as in the Yoga school, it's experience of some kind that you're claiming as the foundation here, not shabda itself. I'm not objecting to such an epistemological stance,

Regards,

Omkar
