Shree Rajaram - PraNAms

Actually there is no logical error in your statements - other than the fact that the statements do not prove the apurusheyatva of the Vedas. They onlyestablish the consistency and preservation of the Vedas within the relative time frame that has been recorded, the slokas or mantras that were passed on by the word of the mouthvia guruparampara or by Veda adhyayanam, and which Veda vyaasa collected and codified into four volumes.

Now let me ask you whether your statements categorically establish without a question that the Vedas are apourusheyam and we do not have to relay on faith that they are? If you honestly can answer yes, my hats off to you. If you say not really, then we are back to the faith as the primary base.Once faith becomes the basis, logic becomes irrelavent for the apourusheyatvam aspect.



Hari Om!
Sadananda

Dear Sri Sadananda, could you please point out the logical error in my
proof? I don't see it. I agree with the need to go beyond logic but
the attempt is to establish only using objective data and logic.
