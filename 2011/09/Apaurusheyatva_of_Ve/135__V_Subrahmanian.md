In my understanding 'Ishvara jnanam or Ishwara pratyaksha' refers to all
that is concerned with 'dharma/adharma/karma' of all the jiva-s.  And of
course the created world.  While the Veda is the manual for 'how to live',
and whereby it teaches things that are beyond the ken of our senses, like
loka-s that are attained by specific karma-s (prohibitions included) and
Self-knowledge, Ishwara pratyaksham/jnana comes to play in the cosmic
management of the life that the jiva lives.  It involves giving the jiva the
appropriate karma phala by creating the appropriate environment.  While the
'AkhyAyika-s' in the veda itself about who did what and ended up as what,
there are more instances and elaborations in the Mahabharata and other
puraNas for these. It is hard to see how the MB could contain really what is
not at all there in the Veda either explicitly or implicitly stated. I think
that is what the explanation of Sri Jayatirtha also implies.
