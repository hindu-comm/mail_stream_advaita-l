You've been warned about this before.  The subjects of the Vedas and 
dependent shastras, the knowledge contained within them, concerns dharma 
and moksha.  Perhaps it also contains information on toothache remedies 
and the like.  Perhaps not.  In any case only dharma and moksha are 
relevant to this list.

If you are interested in dharma and moksha you are in the right place.

If you are not interested in dharma and moksha you are in the wrong place.

If you don't understand the need for dharma and moksha you are in the 
wrong place.

If you don't think dharma and moksha are important you are in the wrong 
place.

If you just want general chatter about whatever notions strike your fancy, 
you are in the wrong place.


So stick to the topic or risk being banned.
