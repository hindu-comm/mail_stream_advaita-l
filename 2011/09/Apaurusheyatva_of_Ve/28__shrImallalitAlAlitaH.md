It establishes nityatvam of relation of word and meaning. This is not
specific to words called veda.

One more doubt,   if all the words & its svara-s (intonations) of veda-s

Because they don't accept veda apauruSheya.

You must ask Ishvara for it. Because they are his breath.(according to
apauruSheyatvavAdin-s.)
Or, ask R^iShis , as they saw it differently.(according to you.)
Or, see prAtishAkhya-s for rules specific to each veda.

Wrong question. We don't accept first revelation to R^iShis.
You accept, so reply yourself.

If you say that it's not, then veda-s are pauruSheya(only because of you
insistence.)

Didn't you read bhAShyam of apauruSheyatvavAdin, called sha~Nkara, that they
are stories for vidyA-stuti.

Mention of nail-cutter proves veda-s created by people!!! Sure, for those
who accept evolution according to new people.
We don't accept that. We say that they are created by veda. See, bhAShyam of
adhikaraNa you mentioned.
