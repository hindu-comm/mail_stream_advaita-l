Shree Rajaram - PraNams

Just as a note - I must submit that your last assertion is not logical. Logic as a means of knowledge applies to loukikam only. apourusheyam aspect of the Vedas is aloukikam. Vedanta is not illogical but logic takes a secondary role and also follows only shaastriiya anumaana not loukika anumaana. You are using loukika dRiShTanta to establish aloukika saadhyam. Anumaana pramANa is only valid within its limits of applicability. Anyway if you are happy about it, so be it, since you believe in it. I rest my case.
Hari Om!
Sadananda

Unless one can point out the flaws in my logic, one has to accept my
conclusion that Vedas are apaureshya as true as long as one accepts logic as
a means of knowledge.
