Shri Srinivas, one way to learn advaitam is to read authentic books -
Shankara, Madhusudana and the works of contemporary advaitins such as
Sringer and Kanchi periyava. If you are able to, find a teacher who
can teach you but they have to be pure and to tell you what Shankara
says not their own concoctions as neo-vedantins do. Unfortunately,
this forum is not to designed to teach - wish it did. It is more for
exchanging views on topics and complement formal training.

Suggested reading (in addition to sadhana to purify the mind): Gita
Bhashya of Shankara and Gudartha Dipika of Madhususdana and
Vivekachudamani with commentary by Sringeri Mahaperivaya. Based on
Shri Subrahmanian's suggestion, I read "Yoga, Enlightenment and
Perfection". It is the most intimate account of any
transcendentalist's personal experience. It brings to life advaita
explained by Shankara and Madhusudana.
