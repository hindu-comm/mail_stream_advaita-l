So, what's the way ?
First of all determine that pramaNa-s do not need faith.
Second shabda is a pramANa.
Third svataH-prAmANyam.
Fourth apauruSheyatvam.
It will make you understand stand of mImAMsaka-s and vedAntin-s.
_______________________________________________
It is to be borne in mind that all pramanas are tentatively assumed.It is the exploring of the pramanas whether they are valid or not creates understanding.it is the going beyond this that creates understanding.
