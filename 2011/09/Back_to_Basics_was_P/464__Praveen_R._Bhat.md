Hari Om, Shyamji,

I hope that your reply to my mail was only incidental, since I'm inline with
you, in that, the preparation for gaining j~nAna starts only with
nitya-naimittika karma as a foundation. That being dharma, it helps in
securing shadsampatti, causing viveka-driven vairAgya and mumukshutva, a
ground for sarva-karma-sannyAsa. Only sannyAsa ashrama allows dropping the
nitya-naimittika karma, else its verily adharma.


(PS: As an aside, although its a good practice to clip source mail content
down to focus of reply even on lists hosted on common/public servers such as
Yahoo & Google, its quite necessary for this list as it is hosted &
maintained by admins themselves.)

praNAm,
--Praveen R. Bhat

Hence the need for a backtrack to the basics.
