I agree with you that apaureshyatvam can ultimately be established on
based on vedas only. But this will be dismissed as self-referential by
those who don't accept vaidhika dharma. Hence we need to establish
through only data and logic. This is not required for one who accepts
vedas as true.

With reference to the above,the Vedas are "apaurusheya"as they are not created by any mortal.They are the visions of the Rishis.Adi shankara Bhagawathpada in his "Brahmasutrabhashya"has raised this question with reference to the discussion on whether the statements and teachings of other "darshanikas' like Buddhists,etc.are 
truth or realisation?he has answered that the "statements of a Sarvajna can be established on the basis of his statements,but for his statement to be true he has to be established that he is a "sarvajna".In the above,the Vedas have no such requirement.The 'Vedas'are "Svatahpramanam",they are "Self-established".The "Paratahpramanam"statements have to be established from some other source.All the "laukika jnanam"have to be established on the basis of "Paratahpramanam"

The "Vedas"are "Abadhita"statements.The statements like "Tatvamasi","AhamBrahmasmi"require "Svatahpramana"statement from the Vedas.These statements remove the "ajnana"and reveal the Truth.Since the locus of "Ajnana"or "Nescience"covers the knowledge of the 'Brahman",it only requires to remove this "ajnana".
