I have no idea what you mean by the above. Every noun in the Sanskrit language
is puMlinga or strIlinga or napuMsaka. The word paramparA is grammatically
strIlinga (feminine). It is the object of the verb vande, therefore it takes the dvitIyA
vibhakti and becomes paramparAM. FYI, in English grammar, dvitIyA vibhakti =
accusative case. There is nothing *unnecessary* about the strIlinga here, nor is
there any negative meaning associated with the word "accusative." All of this is
very, very basic grammar of the Sanskrit language, as I mentioned in my posting.

If it is your contention that we should form some highly unique and personal views
about Sanskrit verses with absolutely no regard for basic grammar at all, then I 
can only say, good luck to you! If on the other hand, you agree that language usage
has an element of grammar to it, please re-read my posting with an open mind.
Nothing further to add...

Thank you,
Vidyasankar
