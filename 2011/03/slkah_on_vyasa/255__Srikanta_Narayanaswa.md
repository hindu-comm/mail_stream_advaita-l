Dear Sri Vidya shankar.
The vyakarana vyakkyana in your interpretations contains unnecessary stri-linga 
and accusative implications.Not withstanding that,my pointing out in the slokah 
is on the understanding of the word"madhyamam" instead of madhyagam.The 
madhyamam apart from understanding as one who is in the middle can also be 
interpreted as "madhyamam" of medium disposition.So,instead of giving rise to 
such interpretations,"madhyagam"is more apt.
Wiil that please sriramji?
Thank you,
N.Srikanta.
