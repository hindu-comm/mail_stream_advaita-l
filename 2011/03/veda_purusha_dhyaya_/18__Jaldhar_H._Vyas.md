Hmmm.  In my notes I have:

R^igvedaH shvetavarNasyAt dvibhujO R^iShabhAnanaH |
akShamAlAyutaH saumyaH prItashchAbhayOdyataH ||

R^ishabha is bull and rasabha would be donkey.  It seems either you or I 
have made a typo.  abhaya and vyakhya are harder to confuse so I don't 
know what's going on there.  Is your source also chaturvargachintamani or 
some other shastra?


As an aside, the six vedangas are iconically portrayed as six Goddesses. 
Of particular note is shikShA who carries a daNda (stick or club.)  This 
is to beat people who mispronounce the mantras!
