Dear Jaladhar,

/////

R^igveda

A divine being white-colored with a bulls head. In his right hand he
holds a rudrAkshamAlA and with his left hand displays the abhaya mudrA

//

A slight correction here. The head of the divine being IMO is donkey instead of bull and the left hand displays vyAkhyAna mudra and not abhaya mudra. 

Here is the pramANa:

rigvEdaH shvEtavarNasyAt dvibhujO rAsabhAnanH
akShamAlAdhara saumyaH prItO vyAkhyApanOdyataH //


with regs,
sriram
