If A gets Moksha do you feel he will continue to see the Leela
activities of Saguna Brahma after he dies? He will see them in
Jeevanmukti.

But definitely he will not see Saguna Brahma in Videha Mukti. He
becomes Nirguna Brahma only after he dies. There is no other thing
left.

Another man B with no Moksha will feel the Leela activities.

If A and B are on Earth this is correct. But if A goes and stays in a
far away Galaxy he will not see this sunrise. He knows also the
sunrise is illusion.

B will see sunrise everyday even when he knows Earth goes round the Sun.
