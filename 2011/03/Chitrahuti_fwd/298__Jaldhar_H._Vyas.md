From: Chandrashekar HR

I am fairly a new member. Can any learned members of the group guide me on
the following :
a. why the chitrahuti (during our bhojana vidhi) is generally / widely
observed during the day meals and not before the dinner ?
b. why chitrahuti is not given during a shradda bhojana ?

Thanks
- Chandrashekar.
