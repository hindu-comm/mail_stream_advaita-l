Namaste

Many free Ebooks-

http://swami-krishnananda.org/writings.html

http://www.dlshq.org/download/download.htm


But I feel it is better to buy books from Publishers of Adhyatmic
books. We must support them and allow them to survive.  What happens
if they close down their business? It is bad for Hindu Dharma.  I
personally purchased books for approximately Rs. 1,00,000. Support the
Publishers and Organisations publishing Dharmic and Adhyatmic books.
People spend money on costly TV, hotel, entertainment but they become
stingy to buy books.
