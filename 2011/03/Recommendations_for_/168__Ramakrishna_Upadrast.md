praNAms,

Thanks a lot to especially to Shri Yadu-ji everyone for the detailed response.
Shri Vaibhav on advaitin list had recommended the following, which I
am adding so that the thread becomes comprehensive when one refer to
the archives.


1. www.archive.org
2. www.dli.ernet.in
3. www.sacred-texts.com
4. library.du.ac.in

Shri Venkatesh-ji: I agree with you that buying books is good for the
samsthas as well. This question was about online availability.

But, let me please refine the original question. My question was about
books like "A Critical Survey of Indian Philosophy", which I studied
long time back and want to revise by reading some chapters (especially
the nyaaya chapters)
http://www.amazon.com/Critical-Survey-Indian-Philosophy/dp/8120803655

Or even "Yoga: The Indian Tradition" which has an must-read excellent
chapter by Shri Vidyasankar of our list.
http://www.amazon.com/Yoga-Indian-Tradition-David-Carpenter/dp/0700712887/

Is there a digital library which one can subscribe to and read these
books of "Indology variety"? One can find both of the books in
Questia.com, but are there similar ones?

For example, recently, I was looking for (for a scholar) the "History
of the Dvaita School of Vedanta and its Literature by B.N.K. Sharma"
in some online form and could not find it
http://www.amazon.com/History-Dvaita-School-Vedanta-Literature/dp/8120815750

The American library systems has a great way to order "Inter Library
Loans" bu which one can practically get to read books, many of which
are available only in rare places in India as well. Out of USA, one
really feels the pinch!
