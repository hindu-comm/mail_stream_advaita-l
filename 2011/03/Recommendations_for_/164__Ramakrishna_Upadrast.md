namaste,

Can anyone recommend online website with good collection of
Advaita/Vedanta/Philosophy/Indology books?

Till some time back, I was a subscriber of Questia
(http://www.questia.com/) which was not really a big collection. Is
there a similar website which some one of the group can recommend?
