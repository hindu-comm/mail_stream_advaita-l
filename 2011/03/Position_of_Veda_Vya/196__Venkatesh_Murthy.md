The Visishtadvaitis have not given any importance to Veda Vyasa Rishi.
They simply call him as Kashcit Rishihi. But the Dvaitis give a lot of
importance to him. They say Madhvacharya got instructions from him in
the Himalayas and he is living there even now. In the Mahabharata
Tatparya Nirnaya he is given lot of importance. He is Vishnu Avatara.

What is the position of Veda Vyasa in Advaita tradition?
