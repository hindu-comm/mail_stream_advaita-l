In Vishnupurana Parashara Samhita 3.3 a list of 28 Veda Vyasa's for each of 
the yuga-cycles of the current manvantara are given.  Krshna Dvaipayana is 
only the current Veda Vyas.

Shankaracharya also gives the example of the Rshi Apantaratamasa Gautama 
(or Dirghatamasa.  He is the Rshi of the Ishopanishad.)  being 
reincarnated as Veda Vyasa in the bhashya on sutra 3.3.32 as an example of 
an 'adhikari' or someone who assumes a divine office for the welfare of 
the universe despite being a jnani and beyond rebirth.
