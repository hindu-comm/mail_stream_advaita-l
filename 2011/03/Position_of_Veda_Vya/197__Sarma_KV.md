Dear Sri Venkatesh,

By "Advaita tradition" if you are referring to Saankara-advaita-tradition:

vEda vyaasa has a very central role in Saankara tradition. His is the most
prominent position in the guru-parampara.

A version of the guru paramparaa stuti SlOkam goes:

*"naaraayaNa/sadaaSiva samaarambhaam - vyaasa Sankara madhyamaam |
 asmadaachaarya paryantaam - vandE guruparamparaam."*

It was Veda Vyasa that appeared to Sankara and exhorted him to take forward
the work on brahma-sUtra-s by compiling bhaashya on them.

That is why, we always remember them both as *Siva-kESava* pair:

*"Sankaram Sankaraachaaryam - kESavam baadaraayaNam |
sUtra-bhaashya kRtau vandE - bhagavantau punaH punaH ||*"

The guru parampara pUja that the yateeSvara-s (the daSanaami samnyaasi-s of
Saankara tradition) perform on guru/vyaasa pUrnima is also called "vyaasa
pUja."

In summary:
Veda vyaasa is a Mula-stambha of "advaita tradition."

Interestingly, I heard some elders say that vEda-vyaasa was not (not just)
an individual, but it is a "padavi" (role) like vishNu, rudra. Hence, he is
ALWAYS there and appears at his own volition like he did to kavikula guru
kaaLidaasa, and Sankara.
