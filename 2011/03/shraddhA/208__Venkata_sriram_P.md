Namaste,

The meaning of the word “shraddhA” changes depending upon
the context to context. 

Nevertheless, AchArya bhakti & Astikya buddhi is called “shraddhA”, 
Shatapatha brAhmaNa says “ Etat dIkShAyai (rUpaM) yacchraddhA”.
Here, the shraddhA implies “kArya dIkSha”. 

Vajasaneya Samhita says “shraddayA satya mApyatE”. 
Also, “shrat dadhAtIti shraddhA” ie., satyaM dhIyatE yasyAM 
sA shraddhA. shraddhA is derived from “shrat” which implies
Satya (Truth). So, that which holds the Truth is called shraddhA.
Also, explained in other words as :

“that Astikya buddhi which helps in showing the Truth is shraddhA”.

So, based on the above meaning (ie., satyaM dhIyatE yasyAM 
sA shraddhA), the word “shrAddha” (the pitru karma) is also
derived “shraddha yA dhIyatE iti shrAddhaH”. 

The karma which is performed with shraddha ie., meticulously
with Astikya buddhi (belief in apara karma mantras & affection
towards their forefathers) is called “shrAddha”.

When the same “shraddha” is directed towards the Vedanta shravaNa, 
it is Acharya Bhakti & Astikya Buddhi towards the Sastras. 

regs,
Sriram
