The vyAkhyA on this Vivekachudamani verse itself by Sri Nrisimha
Bharati glosses 'avadhAraNA' as nothing but ''dRDha-vishvAsaH'. It
also expounds ... "guruNA vedAntaishca bodhyamAnam vastu vishvasiti --
idam evam eva -- iti".  Gita 9.3 is also quoted, and bhAShyakAra
glosses 'ashraddhadAnaH' there as 'AtmaGYAnasya dharmasya asya svarUpe
tatphale ca nAstikAH'. This again, is in line with the
kaivalyopaniShad where Swami Shankarananda glosses 'shraddhA' as
'AstikyabuddhiH'.

It is interesting to note that some editions of the bhAShyam gloss
'ashraddhadAnaH' in 4.40, while others omit it.

bhavadiiyaH,

 ajit
