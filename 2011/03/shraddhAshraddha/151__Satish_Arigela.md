Let us look at it closely:

शास्त्रस्य गुरुवाक्यस्य सत्यबुद्ध्या अवधारणा |
सा श्रद्धा कथिता सद्भिः यया वस्तूपलभ्यते ॥


So shraddhA is defined as avadhAraNA of shAstra vAkya and guru vAkya with 
satyabuddhi. avadhAraNa is according to dictionary meaning the following:
--ascertainment affirmation , emphasis ; stating or holding with positiveness or 
assurance ; accurate determination , limitation (of the sense of words) , 
restriction to a certain instance or instances with exclusion of any other --

so shraddhA is this avadhAraNa i.e emphasis(or any meaning above) of shAstra 
vAkya and guru vAkya with satyabuddhi. Regarding the words satya(true) and 
buddhi there is no confusion.

So if weexamine each word it looks like there is no place where the English 
word faith finds place here IMHO. One can say faith is almost the same or 
synonymous as one of the English meanings given for avadhAraNa but let us ask if 
indeed faith can be used to describe avadhAraNa why is it not used?

I am at this point after seeing this definition and also coupled with the fact 
that a very sanskrit influenced language Telugu the word shraddhA is not in 
anyway used to mean faith, I amcertain that the use of the word faith is a big 
leap.

The correct sanskrit word for faith is vishvAsa. Considering the usage of the 
word vishvAsa confirms this further. vishvasanIya i.e. trusted or something that 
can be trusted, andha-vishvAsa i.e blind faith.

Do we ever use the word shraddhA in normal Sanskrit literature to mean faith or 
trust? Any examples from the any kAvya or purANa? I would be interested in 
seeing them.

Regards

Namaste.

The word shraddhA has a definite meaning in the shAstra, as defined in the
vivekachUDamaNi:

शास्त्रस्य गुरुवाक्यस्य सत्यबुद्ध्या अवधारणा |
सा श्रद्धा कथिता सद्भिः यया वस्तूपलभ्यते ॥

// Acceptance by firm judgment as *true* of what the Scriptures and the Guru
instruct, is called by sages Shraddhaa or faith, by means of which the
Reality is perceived.//

Thus shraddhA in the context of the shAstra is the firm conviction that what
the scripture and the Guru say is indeed true; it cannot be otherwise. That
'satya buddhi' (satyatva buddhi) in their words is shraddhaa. In the
context of the mantra/Rudra, the firm conviction that the chanting of the
mantra will indeed bless me with chitta shuddhi by cleansing me of the sins
forms the basis for the person's taking it up for japa.

The meaning of 'attentiveness', etc. could be taken as accompanying the
fundamental shraddhA, usually translated as 'faith'.
