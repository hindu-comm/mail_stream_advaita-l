PraNAms to all

Just for info. A temple for Sun God was inaugurated on Oct. 26th, 2010,at Pondicherry, TN along with Chinmaya Surya - by H.H. Swami Tejomayanandaji, where he gave lectures on Ishaavaasya and Gita Ch.7.I am presenting aseries of articles on Ishaavaasya mantras 1 and 2 based on Shree Swamiji's discoursesat the Advaita Academy - 3 out of 5 parts have seen the day of light so far. 
Hari Om!
Sadananda
