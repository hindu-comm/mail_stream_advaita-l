Namaste,

Sorry for three mails in a row. Should have included this in the last mail.

There is no guarantee that what I say is true but the reason could be thatthere 
were no saura archaka-s in the South at that time.

Even if saura-s existed at that time in the South and even if they were 
submerged neck deep in tAntric practices, that still will not be an issue for 
sAmba. This is mainly because we did not have Christianity/Islam influenced 
neo-smArta-s during that time. :-))
