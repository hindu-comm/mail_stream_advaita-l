There is a chandrashekhara  ashrama near to my layout,  the Ashrama has 
built   shiva panchAyatana temple where in sUrya bhagavan temple is there 
at Agneya...I go there every Sunday during mAgha mAsa to chant trucha 
kalpa,  AruNa prashna & mahAsaUra.  It is a unique & serene place, worth 
visiting.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
