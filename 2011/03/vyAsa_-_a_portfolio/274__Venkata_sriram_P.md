Dear Srikrishna,

//
I also heard time ago that Ganapati Muni mentioned in his book, based on the 
same Vedic analysis, that Karna won in the battle against Arjuna, and Vyasa 
just altered the story so that the message that Dharma lost in the end. Is it 
true that Ganapati Muni wrote like that?

It seems to be so after going through his thesis. According to him, the 
original epic is "jaya" whose roots can be found in Rg Veda Mandalas.

Rg Veda mentions "ghora samgrAma" (the war) between"suShNa" & "kutsasa"
and that war was supervised by Indra. Indra became ratha-sArathi of kutsasa. 
It seems, kutsasa was defeated by suShNa. Then Indra becomes furious and
removes one ratha chakra of suShNa. 

Here sayana bhashya has been refuted by Ganapati Muni who says that he 
had distorted the Rg Bhashya for this particular rik mantra. 

regs,
Sriram
