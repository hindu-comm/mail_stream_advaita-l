Hello, Anand

Thank you for your help.

I would not have been able to figure out this difference in notation in 
Griffith's. 


In any case, how is one to resolve such differences? Does it mean, in 
Griffith's, the sUkta numbers are different, because some are missing, or 
because of some re-arrangement?

The other important question I wanted to ask was how is this sUkta addressed to 
Indra associated with Ganapati?

As an extension, how is Brahmanaspati sUkta associated and related to Ganapati?

As we see GaNapati-atharva-shIrSha-upaniShad is commonly employed for 
abhishekam. The upanishad itself teaches some upasana, and contains explanation 
of Ganapati as Brahman. Such teaching is not found in the above mentioned 
Ganapati sUkta and Brahmanaspati sUkta. So, how are these to be employed for 
spiritual sadhana? How are they prescribed to help a seeker in the material and 
spiritual pursuts? What is said about their efficacy? 


All and any comments related to recitation of these sUktas and understanding of 
those sUktas will be helpful.

Regards

Srikrishna

The translation that you posted corresponds to sUkta 8.92. I found out that
8.81 (Ganapati sUkta) is, in fact, 8.70 (LXX) in Ralph Griffith's
translation as presented on the Sacred Texts website. This sUkta's
Rishi-Devata-Chhandas is described thus by sAyaNa, based on the
anukramaNikA : A tu na indreti navarchaM prathamaM sUktaM kaNvaputrasya
kusIdina ArShaM gAyatramaindram.h. The sUkta containing 9 Riks, beginning
with "A tu na indra" is the first sUkta (of the 9th anuvAka of the 8th
maNDala). Its Rishi is the son of KaNva called KusIdI (Kuseedee), the metre
is GayatrI, and the deity is Indra.

This sUkta is indeed commonly employed in Ganesha worship. Another hymn is,
of course, the GaNapati-atharva-shIrSha-upaniShad.
