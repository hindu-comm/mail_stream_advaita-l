praNAms Shri Anand-ji,

Thanks a lot for beautiful writeup.

People interested in this subject could also read the beautiful book
by Shri John Grimes.

Also, I think Shri R L Kashyap too has a book on gaNapati and kumaara
sUktas basing his notes on the work on Shri Kapali Sastry.

namaste,

I have been told that this equation is not exactly correct. Could you
please provide why  Shri Chitrav Sastri considers them to be alternate
names?
