The translation that you posted corresponds to sUkta 8.92. I found out that
8.81 (Ganapati sUkta) is, in fact, 8.70 (LXX) in Ralph Griffith's
translation as presented on the Sacred Texts website. This sUkta's
Rishi-Devata-Chhandas is described thus by sAyaNa, based on the
anukramaNikA : A tu na indreti navarchaM prathamaM sUktaM kaNvaputrasya
kusIdina ArShaM gAyatramaindram.h. The sUkta containing 9 Riks, beginning
with "A tu na indra" is the first sUkta (of the 9th anuvAka of the 8th
maNDala). Its Rishi is the son of KaNva called KusIdI (Kuseedee), the metre
is GayatrI, and the deity is Indra.

This sUkta is indeed commonly employed in Ganesha worship. Another hymn is,
of course, the GaNapati-atharva-shIrSha-upaniShad.
