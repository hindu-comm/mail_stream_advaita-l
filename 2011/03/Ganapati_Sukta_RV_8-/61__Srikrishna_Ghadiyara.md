Dr. Yadu

Namaste!

This particular set of names are not referring to the Riks which are part of the 
brahmaNaspati sUkta. Any speculation on why the Riks containing these 
significant names are not part of brahmaNaspati sUkta.

Also, can you (or others) give some vyutpatti of these names.

Thank you

Srikrishna

namaste,

I have been told that this equation is not exactly correct. Could you
please provide why  Shri Chitrav Sastri considers them to be alternate
names?
