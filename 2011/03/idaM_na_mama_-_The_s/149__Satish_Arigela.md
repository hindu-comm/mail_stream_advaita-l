This is directly generic but also addressed to Subramanian ji

>However, I will give you two messengers, ashraddhA
>(absence of faith)

By the way shraddhA is not faith. That false equation of the word shraddhA with 
faith may be the main reason for contradiction.

I will not try to give an alternate English word for it..but here is what I 
suggest. In Telugu we use the word shraddha (apparently it was adopted from 
Sanskrit). But we never use it to mean faith in something.

Here are Telugu usages: shraddhA gA vinu - meaning: listen intently/attentively 
or with focus - Any Telugu people can correct me if I am being unreasonable 
here.

The first time my smArta teacher used the word shraddhA is whendiscussing 
detail of a mantra practice with me-- and thoughhe is very good at English and 
we are having the conversation in English, he never used the word faith or 
belief or anything similar but used the word shraddhA and everytime to indicate 
something done with focus/attention or something done with 
constancy/consistency(i.e. without slightest deviation from what was 
prescribed).

This is something to consider in understanding the shloka you quoted.

Regards
