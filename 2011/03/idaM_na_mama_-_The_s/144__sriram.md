I think a patient is happy that he is cured.He does not evaluate what was 
responsible for his cure.Whatever way the cure is undertaken,faith in the 
medicine and the doctor are essential from the patient`s side.One may 
attribute to the manthra another may to the medicine etc.We know how a 
medicine works but nobody can say how a manthra works.It is like a prayer 
and it is purely subjective.But there are instances where manthras have 
worked miracles.But to prove that it is so is a difficult 
proposition.R.Krishnamoorthy.
