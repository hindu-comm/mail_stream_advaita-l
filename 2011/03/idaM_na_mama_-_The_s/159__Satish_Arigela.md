Namaste

We do have people with good intentions and enthusiasm trying to prove how 
scientific these things, but unfortunately they adopt short cuts like the one 
you mentioned and it fails.

:-) I agree... we should critically question such pseudo science while at the 
same time keeping in mind that our processes are definitely "science- like" and 
are reproducible butthey are not "scientific". They need not be.
