By the way well educated mantrin-s do not beleive in miracles nor do they 
subscribe to any superstitions.

There were instances where I have seen them make fun of the miracles and the 
superstitions that religious people usually entertain.

I certainly cannot speak for them all.. so I limit by comments to only those I 
am acquainted with.

Anyway last post on the topic.

Srikanta says:

Sriram mentioned about the effect of a yAga intended for rain during some very 
difficult times. I will say nothing about it as I am not a witness to it and 
also since I do not know the people involved. Sriram, did not say everytime 
there is a rain somebody did a yAga to please varuNa nor did he say that rains 
come only when a yAga is performed. Please do nto put words in others mouths.

It is not the very best display of sanity on one's part of ask if the tsunami 
is a result of some yAga. Thesanity issueapart, your questions come in a very 
insulting and boorish tone.

I am saddened to see the tsunami dragged into the argument and talked about 
lightly as it is an event involving many deaths and agony to many more.

I will not continue this thread with you till you calm yourself a bit, and let 
go of the agitation.

Regards
