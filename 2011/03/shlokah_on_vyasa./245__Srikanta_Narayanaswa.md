As no one has commented on this yet, let me dare to jut in. Please rest assured 
that
I am fully aware of the context and significance of this discussion thread. 
madhyamA
and madhyagA would both be meaningful, so either reading is fine. However, I see 
no
reason to find fault with the word madhyamA here. 

First of all I would like to knowwhether the word"madhyagam"has been noticed by 
you,in other versions?If you have,then it is alright with me.If it has not ,has 
it not intrigued you?we
donot want "kaji'nyaya here.

The word,"madhyama"(it is not madhyamam) as you mean.in rudra namakam has a 
different meaning.it is the characteristic of the rudra.However,this is not 
relevant here.
N.Srikanta.
