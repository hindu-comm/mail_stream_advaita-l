Dear friends,

In my opinion Arambha or Samarambha can be noun. Any comment?

The word madhyagam has verbal sense in this context.The beginning,sadhashiva 
samarambham has the verb 'arambham" and the ending line,'asmadacharya 
paryantam'again has paryantam used as ending,therfore,in accordance with the 
context,"madhyagam' as the root "gamyate' is used.
