This is with reference to the Email of Sri.V.subramaniam,I have this to say:
If the meaning depends on the usage etc.then the verse should 
be,Sadashivasamarambham shankaracharyah madhyamah etc.if the stress is on the 
word madhyamam referring to shankara.Moreover,it is an adjective.Since sadhasiva 
samarambham refers to the "arambhana"which is at the beginning and the ending is 
with asmadacharya paryantam,in order to have the correct meaning of one who is 
in the middle,it should be "madhyagam".In sanskrit unlike in English every 
particle(nipata)has a meaning.
N.Srikanta.
