I am afraid this quote is not relevant here!! OTOH, it says whatever 
you do, do with brahma bhAva..It is not an outright rejection of 'karma' 
itself.  For kAmya karma some rituals have been recommended in veda-s. 
putra kAmeshti, sAngrahaNyeshti, jyOtishtOma are some of the examples. 
Most of the brAhmaNa maNtra-s suggests various rituals for the various 
kAmya karma. Having said this I should also add that these karma should 
ultimately lead us to karma-yOga, nishkAma karma, through which chitta 
shuddhi and then the aspirant would become eligible to persue jnAna mArga. 

na karmaNAmanAraMbhAnaishkarmyaM purushOshnute..says geetAchArya in 
geeta.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!

So,one has to remain in karma and suffer!That quote in BG has been 
oftrepeated 
without knowing to whom it is meant!

Hare Krishna

This is called reading / assuming too many things between the lines just 
to argue without point!!! When someone says do karma in the spirit of 
yOga, it does not mean 'remain in karma and suffer!!  karmayOga nishTAyAH 
parama rahasyaM Ishwara sharaNAgatiM' says shankara in geeta bhAshya.

BTW, next month at shrungeri they are doing Ayata chandi hOma, do you mean 
they are going to suffer due to this !!??

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
