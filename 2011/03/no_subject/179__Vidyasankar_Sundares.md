I don't intend to continue a discussion which seems pointless at this juncture,
but I would like to request you to use a little viveka when writing.

Your statements that I was reponding to, had little to do with transitioning from
karmA to jnAna. They implied that in your opinion, performance of a yajna by
an ajnAnI is a major waste of time and resources, because the said ajnAnI
could utilize these resources better and feed many thousands. That was the
peculiar mix up of religious and economic factors that I was talking about. You
further seemed to imply that if some jnAnI were to perform a yajna, that would
be more efficacious than an ajnAnI performing the same yajna. I don't know if
you actually meant to say that, but that is the meaning that you conveyed. To
which, a few of us pointed out that if one is a jnAnI, there is really no further
motivation to perform yajna-s. 

Yes, an individual who is desirous of jnAna should learn how to move away from
karmA, but a blanket statement that time, materials and effort spent in any yajna
could be better used in some alternative manner is certainly not representative of
moving towards jnAna in the vedAntic sense.

Thank you,
Vidyasankar
