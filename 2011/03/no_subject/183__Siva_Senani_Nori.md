-- Could you explain how madhyagam may be used as a verb?

-- Why have you brought up nipAtas here? There is no nipAta involved in 
madhyamaam or madhyagam. Or, if you mean that it is okay to have some words 
without meaning in slokas, please note that such an option is to be taken only 
when one cannot explain what is meant by the words and even there meanings like 
"indeed" or "verily" work well.

-- We respect saampradaayika Slokas, but if one is incapable of supporting them 
with relevant arguments, one must be quiet, not repeatedly assert their 
superiority - especially over other saampradaayika readings - without any reason 
or rhyme.

May there be more sense, and less non-sense in this list.
