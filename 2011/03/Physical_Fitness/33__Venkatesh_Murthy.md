What do Dharma Sastras say about Physical Fitness? When we read the
Ahnika books about the daily routines they have not said about any
physical exercises like walking, running and weight lifting. Why?
Mostly Indians today are physically inactive with no exercise. They go
to the office and sit for the whole day and come  home. Every person
has a vehicle. So there is no walking.   This is having a bad effect
on health. Many people are getting bad diseases like BP, Diabetes and
also heart attack when they are young.
