Dear Murthyji,

"ArOgyaM bhAskarAdhicchet" is the popular aryOkti. That is, if one desires good health, one must worship bhagavan suryanarayana. 

The suryanamaskara with tricha arghya pradhana alongwith aruna prashna bestows longevity, good health. Maha Saura Mantra Patha & Surya Sukta of Rg Veda have a set of mantras for curing heart problems, sugar, jaundice, eye problems, normal delivery without accidents like abortions etc. Akshi Upanishad wasfound to bepractically very useful for eye diseases. 

In puranas / itihasas, instances of village sports and malla yuddha (wrestling) werefound and were practiced for good health & physique. 

regs,
sriram
