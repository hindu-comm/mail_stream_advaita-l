Namaste Venkatesh Ji,
For the Hatha Yoga practises of Shankaracharyas, I request you to refer to
the book Yoga, Enlightenment and Perfection' published by Sri Vidyatheertha
Foundation in which the Hathya Yoga practises (apart from the spiritual
Sadhana leading to Nirvikalpa Samadhi) done by the Acharya of Sringeri
Acharya HH Sri Abhinava Vidyatheertha Swaminaha are recorded. The book is
also available in Amazon i think.

Om Tat Sat,
Sriram
