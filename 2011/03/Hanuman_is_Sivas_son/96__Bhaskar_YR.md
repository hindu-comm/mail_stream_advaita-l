The story is Vishnu's Avatara
Mohini was very beautiful.  Looking at her Siva discharged the seed.

I am just wondering whether we are lacking  better topics in shankara's 
advaita to leisurely talk about shiva's ejaculations or shiva-parvati's 
monkey form copulation to determine hanuman's birth ??  Instead of looking 
at adhyAtmik meaning of these incidents (ofcourse, if at all anything is 
there!!) I think we are dragging these episodes too literally  to decide 
the 'cause' of human's birth that too in a list which is specifically 
meant for discussion on advaita vedanta as taught by shankara :-))  Kindly 
pardon me if the moderators of this list think it otherwise.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
