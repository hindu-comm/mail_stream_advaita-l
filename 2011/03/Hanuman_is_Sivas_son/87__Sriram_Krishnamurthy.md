Namaste Venkatesh Ji,
Ashtothra of Sri Hanumantha Ji contains '*Om Rudhra-veerya-samudbavaaya
namah' which means he was born born from the energy of Sri Rudra Shiva.*
*Another interesting nama is 'Om Bhavashiyacchaturananaya Namah' which means
he would be the future Brahma. *

*Om Tat Sat,*
*Sriram*
