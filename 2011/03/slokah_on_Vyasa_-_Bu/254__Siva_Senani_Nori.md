By the way, the reason why the sarvaSUnyavAdins are called mAdhyamikAs in 
Buddhism is this. According to them, yoga and aacaara are the requirements from 
students (compare adhIti-bodha-AcaraNa-pracaara as the four stages of learning 
in Hindu circles). By yoga they mean acquisition of knowledge from the teacher; 
and by acaara is meant the application of knowledge so acquired. The 
sarvaSUnyavAdis recieve the learning sarvam kshaNikam kshaNikam,duhkham duhkha, 
svalakshaNam svalakshaNam,SUnyam SUnyam very well and hold everything to be 
SUnyam. Therefore in terms of yoga, there are uttama adhikArins; however they do 
not explain the worldly objects such as a tree which are very much present - so 
in terms of aacaara or application, these followers are considered to be 
adhamaadhikaarins. Since they are the best in one aspect, and the worst in the 
other, overall they are called maadhyamikas - so much for the Buddhist 
reference! 


By the way, the yogacaarins are the second school who hold external objects to 
be SUnya (but not internal objects) and are held as good in both acquisition and 
application.

(All this is generally from the sarvadarSanasamgraha, the early parts of 
bauddhadarSana (the second one to be explained after caarvaakamatam)).
