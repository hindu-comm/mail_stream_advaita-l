Namaste Sriram,

Thanks for your posts, it is always a pleasure to read posts from people who 
have
in depth knowledge of upAsanA.

This particular topic is a very interesting topic (to me). It is worth noting 
that 

bhAgavatam gives a special treatment to this topic and treats this knowledge
as highly sacred. This is among the two topics reserved for the very last 
section
of this text - the other being details of twelve Aditya-s.

viSNu purANa reserves the very last section of book-1 (which is the book that
covers most of the thoery in this purANa) for this topic and also makes it
quite obvous that this topic is a special topic.

viSNu-sahasranAma too places the names of mahA viSNu that relate to this topic 
at the very end.

Is there are specific reason you mention yatis, sanyAsis in this context? This 
should
be a topic that is most relevant to everyone.

Regards,
Shrinivas

Dear All,

The yatis (sanyAsIs) worship nArAyaNa tattva internally and perform daNDa pUja 
and daNDa tarpaNa regularly. The saguNa upAsana of nArAyaNa is internalized 
and His AyudhAs are contemplated as below:

savitrAtmanE tilakAya namaH
sabdAdi viShayAtmanE makara-kuNDalAya namaH
puruShAtmanE kaustubhAya namaH
panchabhUtAtmanE vanamAlAya namaH
