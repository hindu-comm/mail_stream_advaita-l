Dear All,

The yatis (sanyAsIs) worship nArAyaNa tattva internally and perform daNDa pUja and daNDa tarpaNa regularly. The saguNa upAsana of nArAyaNa is internalized and His AyudhAs are contemplated as below:

//

savitrAtmanE tilakAya namaH
sabdAdi viShayAtmanE makara-kuNDalAya namaH
puruShAtmanE kaustubhAya namaH
panchabhUtAtmanE vanamAlAya namaH
digAtmanE pItAmbarAya namaH
manOvEgAtmanE chakrAya namaH
ahaMkArAtmanE pAnchajanyAya namaH
AnandAtmanE padmAya namaH
Buddhi tattvAtmanE kaumOdakyai namaH

//

The tilaka of Narayana is contemplated as Savitra-rupa; the makara kuNDalAs (a sort ear rings) of Narayana to be sabda, sparsha etc (sound, touch etc.); the Kaustubha Jewel is contemplated to be Jiva; the garland of vanamala is contemplated to be of pancha bhUtAs (5 gross elements); the pItAmbara (cloth of Narayana) is contemplated to be the (Dik) Direction; the Sudarshana Chakra (Disc) is contemplated to be of Manas (Mind); the Panchajanya Conch is contemplated to be of Ahamkara tattva (Ego); the Lotus in the hands of Narayana is contemplated to be of nature of Bliss; the Kaumodaki is contemplated to be of the nature of Intellect. 

The yatIs contemplating on the saguNa & nirguNa aspect of nArAyaNa should perform 12000 japAs of praNava. As per their AmnAya karma, should contemplate on mahAvAkyAs. They should carry daNDa & kamaNDala atleast in the initial stages till they reach the paramahaMsa sthiti. The daNDa is entwined with 12 threads that denote dwAdashAnta sthala above brahmarandhra. The daNDa is divine into 3 parts as agra, madhya & adhO bhAgAs that are brahma, Vishnu & rudra granthIs respectively. This daNDa of yatIs is the upavIta (yajnOpavIta)and if lost, prAyaschitta karma should be performed by fasting till another daNDa is procured from a yatiwho should be of the equal status that of his guru who gave sanyAsa. 

Regs,
Sriram
