Namaste

One more point in  Visishtadvaita Vs. Dvaita debate . Brahman is the
cause of the World.  Janmadyasya Yataha. Is Brahman the efficient
cause Nimitta Karana of the World? Is he the material cause Upadana
Karana of the World? Visishtadvaitis like the pet theory of Sarira
Sariri Bhava. The World is the body of Brahma. They say Brahman is the
Nimitta Karana and Upadana Karana both. But Dvaitis will not accept
that. God is like a potter making the pot with clay. He does not make
the pot with himself but with clay. They say Brahman is the Nimitta
Karana only but not Upadana.

It is nice to assemble  the Tri Matasthas and hear the debate.  In
some points Advaita and Visishtadvaita agree some points Dvaita and
Visishtadvaita some points Advaita and Dvaita.
