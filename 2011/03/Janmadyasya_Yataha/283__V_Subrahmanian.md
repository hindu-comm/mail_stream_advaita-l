On the 9th of April a meet of the above type is organized at MannArguDi,
TamilnAdu, by a VishiShTAdvaita Mutt.  Dr. Mani Dravid Shastri and Dr.
Haridasa Bhattacharya are representing Advaita and Dvaita respectively at
that meet.

On May 12, at Udupi, there is going to be another meet on
'vAchyatvam/avAchyatvam' of Brahman.  I do not know if the Ramanuja school
is coming there.
