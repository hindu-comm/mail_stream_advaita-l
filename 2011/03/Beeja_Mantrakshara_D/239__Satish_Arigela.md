Not trying to be a spoil sport, but this stotra came later and is not really a 
requirement for saptashatI pArAyaNa. However, if the teacher from which one 
learns saptashatI instructs so, then it becomes a requirement for that student. 
IMHO, this stotra requirement is not a generic one but is limited only to some 
tradition(s).

As for kAtyAyanI tantra: The muktabodha site has a paper transcript of some 
chapters with the commentary of nIlakaNTha as a pdf file. It is not much... it 
is just 19 pages in total. 


muktabodha site is like a kAmadhenu for students of shaiva mata/mantra 
shAstra...for those who wish to study the Urdhva srotas i.e. shaiva siddhAnta in 
specific. It has some decent collection of those excellent 
vaiShNava-pA~ncharAtra saMhita-s too!

Regards

It's called siddhaku~njikA stotra and yes it should be recited at the end of a 
complete recitation of the ChaNDipATha.
