Dear Venkatesh,

I have seen this book and is with me.  An ancient copy of the same was preserved 
in 

Nepal National Library and it seems it was recorded in Champu Bhasha.  

Though there is no scriptural evidence for this bija-mantratmaka sapthasati, i 
have seen some of the upasakas chanting the same with samputikarana. 


As far as Chandi Sapthasati is concerned, the pramANa granthAs are Katyayani 
Tantra, Chidambara Samhita, Marichi Kalpa & Hara Gauri Tantra.  But none of 
these seems to mention the bijAtmaka sapthasati.  


Shri Narahari Bhatt, a great upAsaka of Srividya who family has been blessed by 
the acharyas of sringeri, is the current pItha devata archaka who performs the 
Srichakra Navavarana Archana and Chandramaulishwara Puja in the morning.  This 
morning puja can be seen in Narasimha Vana and it is a feast to the eyes to see 
Shri Narahari Bhatt performing Sriyantra Puja and Panchayatana Worship which 
involves Sphatika Meru Yantra, Nrisimha Salagrama, Ratnagarbha Ganapati.  


An old copy of Katyayani Tantra, edited by Nrisimha Bharati & Satchidananda 
Nrisimiha Bharati Mahaswamigal of Sringeri, is preserved by Sri Narahari Bhatt.  
This book lays down the rules & regulations of Chandi Parayana & Chandi Homa and 
Sringeri Pitha ONLY follows this book that was edited by HH Nrisimha Bharati.    


Even that book, there is no mention of Bijatmaka Sapthasati. So, I don't know 
exactly, how bijatmaka sapthasati originated and what was its guru parampara.  


If you are not initiated in Navakshari Mula Mantra, then you can only chant the 
Sapthasati sans the above shaDangAs.  Then it becomes only a part of Markandeya 
Purana and NOT a mAla mantra. Sapthasathi becomes a mAla mantra only if prefixed 
& suffixed with Navakshari Mula Mantra. 


But my advice is that without going too deep into the tantra rahasyas, one can 
enjoy the beauty of the poetic literature of Sapthasati and chant with devotion 
the 4 hymns ie., brahma krita devi stuti, shakrAditakrita devi stuti, aparajita 
stuti & narayani stuti.  


Afterall, we want devotion at the holy feet of Divine Mother and not tantrika 
siddhis.  


That is what was the advice of acharya Shri Bharati Tirtha Mahaswamigal. 

Hope it helps,

regs,
sriram
