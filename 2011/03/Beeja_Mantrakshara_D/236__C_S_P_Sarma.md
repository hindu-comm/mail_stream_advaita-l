Dear List mrmbers,
In this context I want to know about the Siddha Kunchka sthothram found in Rudra Yamalam Gowri thanthram during Siva and Parvathi Samvadha.
The stothra ends with a citation that without reciting the Kunchka stothram sathasathi Parayana has no siddhi just like crying in the Jungles!
With best regards,
Yours sincerely,
C S P Sarma
