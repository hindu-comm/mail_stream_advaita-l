Namaste Venkatesh Ji,
Devi Khadgamala requires initiation. Regarding initiation of any mantra the
usual practise is the Guru should mention the Rishi,Chandas and Devata after
the Sankalpa. He should repeat the Mantra atleast 3 times. The Shishya
should follow it after the Guru. Thus the initiation is complete.

Thanks and Regards,
Sriram
