Namaste Sri Sriram Venkat

Recently one Durga Saptashati book with Beeja Mantras is available in
Kannada script. Every Sloka of Durga Saptashati has Beeja Mantra
attached in the beginning.  The Uvacha Slokas have the Beeja mantra
also.

Mula Beejakshara Saptashati is included in this book. There are 13
Adhyayas but every Adhyaya has Beeja Mantras only no Slokas.

 Kindly  comment on this and explain what is this.
