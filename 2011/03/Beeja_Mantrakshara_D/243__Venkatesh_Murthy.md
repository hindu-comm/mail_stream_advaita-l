I have some questions.

I have one Meru Sri Yantra of Panchaloha . I do Puja with Durga Sukta
Sri Sukta and some Saraswati mantras. Is this sufficient? One book
mentioned you can do Puja with Devi Khadgamala Stotra also.

This book lays down the rules & regulations of Chandi Parayana & Chandi Homa and Sringeri Pitha ONLY follows this book that was edited by HH Nrisimha Bharati.

One day some Purohitas were doing Chandi Homa. They asked me to join
in saying Saptashati. In the beginning they were making offerings with
Navakshari Mantra also. I was saying the same with them. Now do I have
the initiation or not?
