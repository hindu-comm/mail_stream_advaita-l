What is Adi Sankara's opinion on Chandogya Upanishad 8:12 3 ? Dvaitis
> say this Upanishad Mantra gives how the Jeeva enjoys Moksha. In Moksha
> sometimes he has sex with women. Sometimes he dances. Sometimes he
> drives chariots and horses. Etc.

Even the Brhadaranyaka upanishad also says:jaksan kridan ramamanah,Stribhih 
modamano....'what the sruti means it is in the state of dream.But,Moksha is one 
which is devoid of any enjoyment on the dual plance.The Upanishath only 
says;Atmaramh,Atmakrida,etc."
