Words in any language have various shades of meanings, and this is
doubly true in Sanskrit. But, this does not grant anyone blanket
license to start with a dictionary, and then pick and choose meanings
based on whims. The dictionary entries themselves are based on usage.
prayuktAnAm idam anvAkhyAnam.

The usage "sha~NkarAchArya-madhyamAm" is straightfoward and
appropriate. Why? Native speakers and those skilled in the language
say so. And that _defines_ aptness.

In my experience, this kind of nitpicking (often with the best of
intentions) is done by the same groups of people who insist on
Samskrit as a perfect knowledge (samyak kRtam saMskRtam). All I can
say is, in my experience, apavAdamayam saMskRtam. And saying so does
not reduce the beauty of the language even one iota.

bhavadiiyaH,

 ajit
