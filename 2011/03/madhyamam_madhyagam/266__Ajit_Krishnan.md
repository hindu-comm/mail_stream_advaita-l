> But the aptness and the context of the usage.


Words in any language have various shades of meanings, and this is
doubly true in Sanskrit. But, this does not grant anyone blanket
license to start with a dictionary, and then pick and choose meanings
based on whims. The dictionary entries themselves are based on usage.
prayuktAnAm idam anvAkhyAnam.

The usage "sha~NkarAchArya-madhyamAm" is straightfoward and
appropriate. Why? Native speakers and those skilled in the language
say so. And that _defines_ aptness.

In my experience, this kind of nitpicking (often with the best of
intentions) is done by the same groups of people who insist on
Samskrit as a perfect knowledge (samyak kRtam saMskRtam). All I can
say is, in my experience, apavAdamayam saMskRtam. And saying so does
not reduce the beauty of the language even one iota.
