Sometime ago I posted some descriptions of the iconic forms of the Vedas 
from the vratakanda of chaturvargachintamani by Hemadri Acharya (an 
encycopedic dharmashastra work)  Here it is again.

R^igveda

A divine being white-colored with a bulls head.  In his right hand he
holds a rudrAkshamAlA and with his left hand displays the abhaya mudrA.

yajurveda

A divine being of yellow color with a goats head.  In his right hand he
holds a rudrAkshamAlA and in his left hand, the vajra or thunderbolt.

sAmaveda

A divine being of dark blue (nIla) color with a horses head.  In his right
hand he holds a rudrAkshamAlA and in his left hand a shanka or conch 
shell.

atharvaveda

A divine being of white color with the head of a monkey.  In his right
hand he holds a rudrAkshamAlA and in his left hand a club or mace
(khaTvA~nga)

But this source does not equate the samavedamurti with bhagavan hayagriva.
