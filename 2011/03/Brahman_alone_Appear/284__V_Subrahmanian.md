Namaste.

A new article on the above topic has been uploaded at this URL which those
interested may please visit:

http://adbhutam.wordpress.com/2011/03/27/brahman-alone-appears-as-jiva-jagat-and-ishwara/

As the essay is quite long I found it convenient to give just the URL
instead of making it into two or three parts and posting here.

Regards,
