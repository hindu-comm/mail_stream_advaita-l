Dear Murali,

The 11th skandha of Bhagavata says:

avyAkritaM anantAkhyaM AsanaM yad adhiShThitaH
dharmajnAnAdi bhiryutaM satvaM padmamahOchayatE //

The ananta-sesha on which rests Bhagavan Vishnu is the
“avyAkrita” tattva of prakriti. 

This “nArAyaNa” swarupa is also contemplated 
as bhuvaneshwari / nArAyaNi in Agama that 
presides over the bhuvaneshwari bIja “hrIm” (hreem-kAra bija).

As per the shAkta Agama, 

//
vyOmbIjE mahEshAni – kailAsAdi pratiShTitAM
vahnibIjAtsuvarNAdi – niShpannaM bahudhA priyE
tEnAyaM vartatE lOkO – bhUmanDalasamAsthitaH
turyaswarUpENa pAtALE – shESharUpENa dhAryatE
mahAbhUmanDalam – tasmAtvAlasyA(a)pi nAyikA
binduchandrAmritam dEvi – srAvayantI jagatrayam
dravarUpA bhavEt tasmAt – srujantI chA(a)rdhasUtrayA
ata Eva mahEshAni - bhuvanEshIti kathyatE

//

The Bhuvaneshwari Devi in the form of “hrIM”, holds like Kailasa 
In the form of “ha” which is also called vyOma bIja or akasa bija 
(vide refer the pancha puja “haM akAsa tattvAtmane….”; holds the 
bhUmaNDala (prithivi) in the form of “r” which is agni bIja 
(vide refer the pancha puja “raM agni tattvAtmane…”. ); holds
the nether words (pAtALa lOkAs) in the form of Adisesha in the form
of “ee” (ee of hreem). This “ee” is said to be the Turiya Swarupa. 
On this “turiya bija” in the form of Adisesha, rests all the higher worlds. 
This “ee” is the support for all the worlds. The Chandra bindu 
represents the Ambrosia (Nectar) that nourishes
the entire universe which represents the principle of sustenance &
Creation. This is “hreem” bija rahasya. This bija can also be derived
By putting nAda to the mantra “hari”. So, hari+nAda > harIm > hrIm. 
Srividya Tantra identifies this “ee” alongwith nAda to be “kAmakaLa mantra”
Which is also extolled in Srisukta as “tAM padminiM IM prapadyE”.


So, nArAyaNi & nArAyaNa tattvAs are both one and the same who 
are contemplated in similar fashion. 

The tantric script of “ha” bija is Circle; that of “r” is Triangle; when
“ee” alongwith nAda is added to the above two, looks similar to 
that of “Coiled Serpent”. 




Regs,
Sriram
