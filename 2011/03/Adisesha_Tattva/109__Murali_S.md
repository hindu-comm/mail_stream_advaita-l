In the Dhyana shlokas of Vishnu Sahasranaamam,the Lord is meditated in
two ways-'Bhu Paadou Yasya Naabhir' and also as 'Shaantakaaram
Bhujagasayanam'.I would be grateful if a devotee/sadhaka can
'enlighten' further.Honestly,I do not know whether I am 'ready' to
'receive' or even sure what I am seeking.Neverthless,making an
attempt.
