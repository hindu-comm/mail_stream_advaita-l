My question to learned members,

This is not about Advaita Vedanta.But something to do with Sakaara
Upaasana of Narayana.Our Acharyas give multiple scripture based
methods to do Upaasana of Ishwara.It is well known that Iswara as Lord
Narayana or Mahavishnu reclines on Adisesha in
Kshirasaagara/Vaikunta.Our Acharyas do not give particular importance
to this Form.Neverthless,they agree this splendid Rupa is the Highest
Manifestation of Saguna Brahman(Sri Chandrashekhara Bharathi
Mahasviminaha-Saint of Sringeri-Iswaranudaya Utkrishtamaana
Vibhuti-).Ofcourse,we all know HH was personally deeply devoted to
Lord Shiva.

I would be extremely thankful if learned members could 'explain' the
AdiSesha Tattva from the scriptures.
