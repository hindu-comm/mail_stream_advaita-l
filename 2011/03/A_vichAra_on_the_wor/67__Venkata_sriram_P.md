Dear Subbuji,

Further to the trailing mail, Muttuswami Dikshitar composed "kamalAmba navAvaraNa kritIs". The Goddess Kamalamba is visualized here a seated in Bindu Mandala of Srichakra. 

Also, in Maharashtra, there are three-and-half shakta pithas that are usually called "sADhe teen shakti peeth" in Hindi. They are Mahalakshmi at Kolhapur, Bhavani at Tuljapur, Renuka (Ekavira) at Mahurgad and the forth one is Ambaji at Vani (Sapthashringi near Nasik). These 3 and half saktha pitas correspond to the 3 and half coils of the Kundalini Serpent at Muladhara. Also, these sADhe-teen pIThAs are considered to be a-kAra; u-kAra, m-kAra and ardhamAtra respectively. 

Among these 3 and half saktha pithas, Kolhapur Mahalakshmi is considered to be the Mula Prakriti Rupini who is extolled in Devi Sapthasathi as AdyAlakShmi or Chandi. The mUti rahasya of Rahasya Traya extolls her as Adi Sakti. Interesting, Mahalakshmi of Kolhapur holds mAtulinga phala (a sort of lime fruit); gadA (mace), khETaka (shield) and pAna pAtra (a bowl containing madhu) in Her 4 hands and on Her crown are Yoni, Linga & Nagarespectively which is similar to the description of Mula Prakriti of Chandi.

Also,in “lalitOpAkhyAna”, at the time of the celestial marriage of Kameshwara & Kameshwari, kanyAdAna was performed by Vishnu, being Her sahOdara and She was addressed as “nArAyaNi”.
