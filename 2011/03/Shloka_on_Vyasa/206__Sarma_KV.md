I am also hearing/reading for the first time, "aguru" and "madhyagaam."

Understood what you had to say about "madhyagaam." I know "aguru" was a
spelling mistake - you meant just "guru."

Dear Sir,

Madhyagaam - what you said is quite true. But, when you say sadaaSiva
samaarambhaam - you correctly state that the guruparampara originates at
sadaaSiva.
Sankaraachaarya madhyagaam - Agreed, that "madhyagaam" would mean the
parampara has Sankaracharya as "medium."
But frankly, between sadaaSiva and your guru, is there only aadiSankara? Is
aadiSankara spanning the whole medium between sadaaSiva and your guru?

Whereas, "madhyamaam" would place Sankaraachaarya in the "center." A,
fulcrum and an epoch in the parampara.

I don't think we need to be picky about words, more so when the meaning is
not much different, especially being advaitins. The SlOkam that you learned
and use to do smaraNa of the guruparampara is great, and divine.
The SlOkam that I quoted and use, is also equally great and equally divine.

And then, could you please do a simple google search on this SlOkam? How
many are returning "madhyagaam??"

Finally, please read the SlOkam on this page:
