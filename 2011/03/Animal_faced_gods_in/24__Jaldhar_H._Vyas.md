As with so many Vedantic topics, it depends.  In chhandogyopanishad there 
is the story of devaraja Indra and daityaraja Virochana who both learned 
brahmavidya but only Indra understood it properly.  Virochana just 
understood it to mean "I am God so I can do whatever I like."  The Devas 
are the children of Aditi (infinity) while Daityas are the children of 
Diti (Finity).  The limited mind will see everything it perceives as an 
extension of ego and anything beyond its comprehension as "difference." 
But Advaita Vedanta shows us there is an alternative.
