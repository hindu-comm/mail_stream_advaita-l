---------------
I have been meaning to ask this question/clarification about animal faced gods 
and daemons in Hinduism. 

On the one hand we have Advaita based on logic with examples of "Hare with 
horns" on the other hand our
 puranas filled with animal headed gods etc. 
Can the learned explain this?  Is this to state that God is in every being? 
Or to highlight this character with the attributes of the animal? 
Or to discourage animal cruelty and hunting?
 May be something completely different.
