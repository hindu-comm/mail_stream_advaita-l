The following URL contains a translation of the three-part series of
benedictory addresses delivered by the Jagadguru Sri Bharati Tirtha
Mahaswamiji of Sringeri.  All the three parts can be read along with the
'related material' on the right panel:

Unless in an exclusively scholarly gathering, the Acharya never delves deep
on core Advaitic topics.  He always addresses the general audience on topics
of devotion to God, importance of adherence to sva-dharma, the practice of
moral values, etc.
