What that Universal awareness is difficult to say like we cannot describe Turiya. That is anirvacaniya. Kenopanishad had alone seems to have succeeded in telling us positively about the role of that awareness. The eyes can see because of that etc.

The Mahayana view means Nirvana is getting out of the five Skanfhas (five Koshas) so that one gets out of the birth and death cycle by following the prescribed path or way of life. The oneness with the universal awareness is achieved after leaving the individualistic body of five koshas. Nagarjuna boldly says that Shunyata does not mean non-existence.

But neither Nagarjuna nor any other Mahayana philosopher upto the Dalai Lama of today says anything positive about what this "universal awareness" actually is. At best you can say they are agnostic about it. By contrast even though there are negative statements in shruti such as "neti neti" even supposedly "Buddhist-influenced" Vedic philosophers like Gaudapadacharya unequivocally speak of an ultimate reality.
