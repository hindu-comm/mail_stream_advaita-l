But neither Nagarjuna nor any other Mahayana philosopher upto the Dalai 
Lama of today says anything positive about what this "universal awareness" 
actually is.  At best you can say they are agnostic about it.  By contrast 
even though there are negative statements in shruti such as "neti neti" 
even supposedly "Buddhist-influenced" Vedic philosophers like 
Gaudapadacharya unequivocally speak of an ultimate reality.
