SAdara praNAmam Sri Kamesh,


*“Amba, be pleased with me. I am a small child lying in your lap, I don’t
know
how to speak and even if I did know how to speak now, I could not now
because my
mouth is busy drinking milk from your breast.
 *
An unique expression of devotion indeed!
 let us have the reference and the sloka in sanskrit.
Namaste.
