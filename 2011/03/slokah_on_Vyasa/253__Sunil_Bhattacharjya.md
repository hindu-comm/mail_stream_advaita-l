Yes, for the novices what Adi Sankaracharya said in the Mohamudgaram may not apply.

I'm still a novice here, so kindly pardon this endeavor of mine.
IMHO, in this context I believe that hair-splitting is required.

Each one of us could have understood the shloka differently based on our
understanding of the intended purpose, context and grammar.
We could be happy with this understanding if we were in isolation.

But we are discussing this on a public mailing list, which is a platform
for many of us to interact. I suppose this is the purpose of joining the
list!

Hence when an interpretation for a particular shloka is given, it gives 
an opportunity for others to understand that interpretation, analyse it from
their perspective and even compare it with the interpretation that they
have. One would like to do this to see if the given interpretation

 a) Extends one's own interpretation in some way.
 b) Stands satisfiable independent of one's own interpretation.
 c) Contradicts ones own interpretation.

Even to understand if the case is a), b), or c) one has to implicitly do some
analysis.

If it turns out to be c), then one makes one's analysis explicit on the list.

In this particular case, the analysis was required because there was an
attempt to understand the shloka in a manner which seemed contrary to the
intended purpose of the shloka.

Now IIRC one tries to given an alternate interpretation when the primary
primary meaning in the context of the shloka is either inconsistent
or redundant or incomplete.
To know the primary meaning one has to take the aid of vyAkaraNa.
I believe this is what Sri Vidyasankarji has done here.

In fact I believe the contrary has been discussed by Sri Jaldharji
on this list sometime previously:

Because that interpretation does not fit in this particular context.
IOW if Lord Buddha is indeed an incarnation of Lord Krishna or not,
and did or not our acharya advocate moderation, does not seem to have
any significance in a Shloka that discusses the guru-parampara.

But then one needs to ask if anything goes ? You yourself say
"In Sanskrit there are many things...", but one still needs to analyse and
understand if _this_ particular thing is one of those many things
or not, right ?
