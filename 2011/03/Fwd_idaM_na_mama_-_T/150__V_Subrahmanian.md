Namaste.

The word shraddhA has a definite meaning in the shAstra, as defined in the
vivekachUDamaNi:

शास्त्रस्य गुरुवाक्यस्य सत्यबुद्ध्या अवधारणा |
सा श्रद्धा कथिता सद्भिः यया वस्तूपलभ्यते ॥

// Acceptance by firm judgment as *true* of what the Scriptures and the Guru
instruct, is called by sages Shraddhaa or faith, by means of which the
Reality is perceived.//

Thus shraddhA in the context of the shAstra is the firm conviction that what
the scripture and the Guru say is indeed true; it cannot be otherwise.  That
'satya buddhi' (satyatva buddhi)  in their words is shraddhaa.  In the
context of the mantra/Rudra, the firm conviction that the chanting of the
mantra will indeed bless me with chitta shuddhi by cleansing me of the sins
forms the basis for the person's taking it up for japa.

The meaning of 'attentiveness', etc. could be taken as accompanying the
fundamental shraddhA, usually translated as 'faith'.
