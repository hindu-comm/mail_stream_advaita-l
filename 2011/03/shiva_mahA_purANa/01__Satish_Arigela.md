Something does not become kutarka simply because the statement discomforts a 
person.

Some learned people both westerners and Indians are very doubtful about the 
existence of shaiva and vaiShNava mata-s as we know todayduring vyAsa's time.

If you see a sanskrit work styled sUta uvAcha or vyAsa uvAcha etc talking about 
some 18 th or 19th century happenings, I hope people are not so naive to accept 
them as authored by vyAsa. That is plain stupid if one asks me.

I suggest one grow's up and accept this instead holding onto stories meant for 
kids.
