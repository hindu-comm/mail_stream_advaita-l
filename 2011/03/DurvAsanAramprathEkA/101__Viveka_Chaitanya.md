Namaste,
There is an excellent discourse and commentary on "DurvAsanA prthEkAram of Sri Vidyaranya" by Swami Paramarthanandaji of Vedanta Vidyarthi Sangham, Chennai. The file is in two parts and contains the original sanskrit verses alongwith detail discoruses on each verse. It is in PDF format. You can search under "Swami Paramarthananda" or "Vedanta Vidyarthi Sangham, Chennai". 

With regards,
Vivekachaitanya

There is an English translation here:

http://www.celextel.org/stotras/other/durvasanapratekaradasakam.html

but it does not include the sanskrit text. They may have it in the files of the Advaitin Yahoo Group but it looks like you have to be a member to access it.
