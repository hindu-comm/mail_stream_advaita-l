Pranams

I read the thread on Chitrahuti and the question and answers gave some clarifications and I am grateful to Shri Sriramji for that.  I will further request that the source on which this information is gathered.  If this is not possible, may I further request that the procedure(s) the mantras to be recited before lunch and dinner.  Also, combining the relevant rules, the type of food to be cosumed for lunch and dinner, if mentioned it will greatly benefit the members, particularly persons like me.

With profound regards,

Sincerely,




R. VENKATESWARAN

> There are 2 category of pitrudevatas.  One category is created by Prajapati Brahma and the other category is presided by vasu,rudra & aditya who are the mentors of our own forefathers ie., pita, pitamaha, prapitamaha (father, grandfather & great-grandfathers).
>  
> Among the 1st category fall:
>  
> anala, soma, yama, aryama, agniShvAtta, barhiShada & somapa.  
>  
> Again, each one have their own 7 sub-categories.  
>  
> These 7 x 7 = 49 pitru gaNAs are called "diva pitru gaNAs" who are sAsvata (eternal),
> ie., till kapAnta.  
>  
> Yama falls under diva pitru gaNAs alongwith his attendants chitra & chitragupta.
>  
> So, during the mAdhyAnhna bhOjana, the kavya is offered to yama, chitra & chitragupta 
> in the form of 3 morsels of rice.  These is a form of pitru pinDa pradAna to "divya pitrus".
> And obviously, pitru-devatas are invoked in aparAnha kAla and that too only once.
>  
> And hence, they are not invoked during night at dinner.
