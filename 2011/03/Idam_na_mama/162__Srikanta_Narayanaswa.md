Same again - trying to make it look silly. Nobody said performing a homa to a 
certain devata automatically grants brahma jnana. It is one of the many things 
that help remove obstacles on the path.

some times the very purpose of removing the obstacles creats obstacles.Just as 
what happened at Tanjure bitemple,that the priests made a bonfire which causes 
many deaths and loss to property

There are many stanzas which substantiate this.n his karikas,Gaudapada the supre 
teacher says:
"Upasnasritasya brahmasya jnate Brahmani vartate
prag utpatter ajam sarvam tenasau krpanah smtah"

This forum is not meant to discuss the ritualistic aspects.It is to discuss 
Advaita as enshrined in the Upanishads.For this to happen,one must leave trivial 
things aside.Remember,it was you who started this trivial exchanges.
N.srikanta.
