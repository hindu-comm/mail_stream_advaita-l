It does really.  Everything belongs to someone else Ishvara who pervades 
all.  (Ishavasyam idam sarvam yatkincha jagatyam jagat.)  Knowing this 
_one_ _should_ _renounce_ (tena tyaktena).  Renunciation with the idea 
"whose is this wealth I enjoy?" is the opposite of covetousness.

I am reminded of the story of Vaman avatar.  Proud Baliraja on seeing the 
Brahmana dwarf who is paying a visit says take as much land as you can 
walk three steps.  He thought how much can this be for such a little man? 
But Vishnu Bhagavan expanded in size and in two steps spanned the entire 
universe.  It was then that Baliraja realized his error and forsaking 
pride offered his head as the third step.

The above story demonstrates that it is not always so.  Without 
understanding, even good deeds like charity can be a vehicle for ego and 
arrogance.
