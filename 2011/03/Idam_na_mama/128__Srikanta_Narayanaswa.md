The starting shloka of Ishavasya Upanishad beautifully summarises this theme:
Ishavasyam idam sarvam yat kinca jagatyam jagat!
tena tyaktena bhunjita ma gridha kasyaciddanam!!

The Upanishath doesnot say "you should not enjoy'.it says "ma gridha kasyacit 
danam.Don't be grredy as tgo covet another's money.
Sri,Adi Shankara Bhagawathpada the great Jnani that he was reflects this in his 
"Bhajagovindam"stotram:

Mudha jahih danagama trishnam
kuru sadbuddhim manasavitrishnam
yallabhase nija karmopattam
vittam tena vinodaya cittam.

He does not say you should give up mundane things.But,yallabhase nija 
karmopattam,vittam tena vinodaya cittam.This indeed is the sanatana dharma.
But,whither goes India!
Bhava shankara Desika me saranam.
