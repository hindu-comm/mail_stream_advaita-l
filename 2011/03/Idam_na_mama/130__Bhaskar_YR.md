Without understanding, even good deeds like charity can be a vehicle for 
ego and 
arrogance.

Humble sAshtAnga praNAms Sri Jaldhya Vyas prabhuji
Hare krishna

That is indeed a good observation prabhuji.  Yes, entertaining a thought 
that I am a 'dAni' implies that he is thinking that he is a possessor!! 
This would result in furthering the ego.  A real dAni would not think that 
he is a dAni...A thyAga bhAva is tyAga of the notion that he is a dAni or 
tyAgi...And this ahaMkAra, mamakAra tyAga is what leads us to amrutatvaM. 
'kereya neeranu kerage chelli' sings Sri purandara dAsa. 

Your humble servant
Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
