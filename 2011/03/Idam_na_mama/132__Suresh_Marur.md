An interesting post that is close to my heart too. Many people have
posted by the time I could collect my thoughts and craft a response.

Renunciation and tyaaga is often misunderstood and people imagine
giving up things means living like a mendicant. Being a statement that
applies to everyone, this is clearly not required. In fact, this is
one reason many people think that spirituality and study begins at the
age of 60 when we are "incapable" of acquiring any more wealth.

It is really meant to imply a state of mind where we say "This is not
mine". This in obvious terms implies to things that belongs to others.
What about things that we "own"? It is the things we "own" that can
become problems for us. In reality, we OWN nothing. Everything is
provided for and we get the privilege of "exclusive" access from time
to time (including our own selves). It is when we take this for
granted and start calling things "mine" that problems start and the
mind gets attached.

It does not require any knowledge of Vedanta to build this attitude.
It is based on simple observation and reasoning. The attitude is
however the basis for honesty, humility, and contentment. Not having
this attitude is the root cause for all the negative traits
(dishonesty, pride, greed and jealousy respectively).

These three words of "idam na mama" IMO is the basis for all spiritual
growth... Before this attitude, any amount of theory and reading of
scriptures means nothing and amounts to empty gossip.
