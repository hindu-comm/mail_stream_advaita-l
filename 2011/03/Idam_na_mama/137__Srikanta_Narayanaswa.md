Dear Sriram.

With reference to your Email on the above topic,You are talking about the 
"Yajna"as it is understood commonly,i.e pouring oblations to the fire to get 
something in return from the Devatas.I am talking about the 'JnanYagna"which is 
glorified by the Bhagavan in the Bhagavadgita.In the Upanishath which belongs to 
the uttarakanda(uttaramimamsa),only Jnanayagna is relevant.without obtaining 
Jnana,.pouring all the wealth like tins of ghee,silk,barley,millets is a 
collossal waste.Many could be fed with that money.
Regards,
N.Srikanta.
