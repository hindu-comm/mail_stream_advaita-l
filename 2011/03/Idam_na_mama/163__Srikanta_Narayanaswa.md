Dear Sriram
With reference to your lengthy post,I only have this to say.It is left to any 
one to jolly well believe that these yagnas,yagas and other rituals bring rain 
or whatever it is performed by some sastry as you wrote.How is that without 
performing these,thereare floods,and half of Andhra was washed off in these 
floods.!who performed yagna for sunami to occur in Japan?.But,jnanayagna 
requires no such dravyas or things.Only a mind which is not clear will combine 
the Jnana-karma samuccaya.
N.Srikanta.
