With reference to Sri.subramaniam and Sri.Jaldhar vyas's Email on the above 
topic in reply to my Email on the above topic,I would like to say that It may 
not be possible to even giveup one's own things,but it is possible not to be 
greedy.This is supported by Adi shankara,when he says,"Yallabhase nija 
karmopattam vittam tena vinodaya cittam".The first verse of Ishavasyam is 
addressed to the Sanyasis as the bhshya of Shankara clearly explains.The second 
verse,:
Kurvannevehakarmani jijivisheccatagm samah!
evam tvayi nanyahetosti
nakarma lipyate nare!!

Regards,                                                                                                                                                                                         
 N.Srikanta.
