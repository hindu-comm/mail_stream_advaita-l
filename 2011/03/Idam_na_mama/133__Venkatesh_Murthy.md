Bali Chakravarti got  warning from Guru Sukracharya but he did not
listen. Dana cannot be given to anybody.  The receiver must be fit to
receive the gift. Only Anna Dana is allowed to be given to anybody.
You cannot give donation to a person who can misuse the gift.
Sukracharya warned Bali about Vamana because he knew Vishnu was
deceiving Bali.  Another point. Dani cannot give Dana expecting  some
return. Then he is not Dani and there is no Dana. It is a business
deal. It is not true Dana.  You cannot give donate something you do
not have. It is not possible.  When Dana is given in proper way it
will get rid of Ajnana in the best way.
