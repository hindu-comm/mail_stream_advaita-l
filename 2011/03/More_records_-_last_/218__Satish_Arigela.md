No disagreement here.

I agree again..bhakti is definitely required. As for shraddha, mantra practice 
does not yield fruit without shraddha. The only disagreement I had with other 
members is on what shraddhA means. Where I on the strength of the upAsaka-s I 
know and onexamining various tantra-s & on the opinion of tAntric 
practitionerstook the stand that belief(as is understood)is not required, but 
the way shatapatha brAhmaNa describes( I am depending onshrI Sriram's 
description here)shraddhA makes perfect sense and seems applicable to mantra 
practice. The other definition of shraddhA intertwined with vishvAsa is only 
applicable forvedAnta.

Oh ok. Then I go by your judgement as I do not know the complete details 
involved.
It is just that your earlier mention did not completely describe thescenario 
and hence I was skeptical as usual.
