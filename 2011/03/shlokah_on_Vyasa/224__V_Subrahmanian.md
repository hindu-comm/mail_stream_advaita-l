Namaste.

The word 'मध्यमाम्’ does not connote any meaning that is derogatory to
Shankaracharya or Advaita.  It simply says something about the
position.  There is an expression: अग्रम्, मध्यम्, मूलम्.  मध्यम् in
no way shows that it is of the 'middling' type having the supreme and
lowly on its either side. The word, like many other sanskrit words,
contextually gets a meaning. The VishiShTAdvaita sampradaya has a
similar sounding verse, adapted to their system:

श्रीलक्ष्मीनाथसमारंभां नाथयामुनमध्यमाम्। अस्मादाचार्य पर्यन्तां वन्दे
गुरुपरंपराम्।.

Ramanuja does not even have the 'madhyama' place here.  Will it be
correct to say that they hold him to be 'adhama'?  If the word
'madhyama' could have overtones of the mAdhyamika, then even the
VishiShTAdvaitins will have to face that ignominy.
