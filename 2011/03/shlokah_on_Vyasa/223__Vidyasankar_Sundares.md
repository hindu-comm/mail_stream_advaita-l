As no one has commented on this yet, let me dare to jut in. Please rest assured that
I am fully aware of the context and significance of this discussion thread. madhyamA
and madhyagA would both be meaningful, so either reading is fine. However, I see no
reason to find fault with the word madhyamA here.

In a Sloka that uses the words samArambhAM and paryantAM, the use of madhyamAM
can only convey the meaning of "in the middle". Contextually, there is absolutely no
reason to compare with the words uttama and adhama here. There is also absolutely
no reason to suspect a so-called "serious madhyamaka" overtone. If the mere usage
of the word madhyama is to lead to a suspicion of Buddhist madhyamaka connotation,
then what would you make of "namo madhyamAya ca" in the rudra namakam?!!
