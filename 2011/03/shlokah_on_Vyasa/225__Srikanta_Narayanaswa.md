With ref to what V.Subramaniam wrote on Ramanujacharya,I would like to say 
that,the Vishistadvaitins copied simply the Advatin's invocation.There is 
justification in calling shankara as in the centre,but the vishistadvaitins have 
no justification as it has no scriptural sanction.It is better to consult some 
eminent scholars of the sampradaya to ascertain this fact.
N.Srikanta.
