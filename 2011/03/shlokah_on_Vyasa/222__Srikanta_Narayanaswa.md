Dear Sarmaji,

I know that many say it as "madhyamam",but I have also read in many 
books,especially the traditional one as "madhyagam".We know that Shankaracharya 
occupied a supreme position in Advaita vedanta,and after him many came as 
Advaita Gurus,especially in Sringeri mutt.I have also seen in this mutt this 
version.To be specific,starting from Sadashiva and ending with 
asmadacharya,Shankara is considered as the Guru who taught Advaita clearly.The 
word madhya doesnot mean medium as you have said.But,madhyamam has this meaning 
between uttama and the adhama.Therefore,madhyagam is the apt choice.Moreover,as 
I have explained before,the word has serious "Madhyamaka"overtones and the 
critics of Shankara may misuse it.
N.Srikanta.
