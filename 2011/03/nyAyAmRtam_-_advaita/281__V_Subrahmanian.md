Pranams Sada ji,

It is indeed an impossible task to transcribe the discussions.  Maybe if one
has the original recording, which was indeed made by that institution, one
can attempt to do that.  Still a discussion spanning several hours, over two
days, is virtually impossible to be transcribed and put in another language.
One has to attend an event like this to get a taste of it.  My post was only
to share with all my experience and more than that to inform about event/s
of this nature.

Regards,
subbu
