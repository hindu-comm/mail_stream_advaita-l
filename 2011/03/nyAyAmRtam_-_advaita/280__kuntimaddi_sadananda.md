Subbuji - PraNAms 

Glad to read the account. Is it possible to transcribe their discussions in English for us all to understand?

Hari Om!

On the 19th and 20th of March 2011 there took place a delectable treat to
followers of Vedanta. The venue was the Auditorium of the Poornaprajna
Samshodhana Mandiram located at the premises of the Poornaprajna VidyApItha,
Bangalore. It was called a National Seminar. This year's program is the
fourth/fifth in line occurring as an annual feature during this time of the
year.
