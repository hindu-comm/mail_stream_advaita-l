The links given by Shriramji to DLI are to the danakhanda 
only.  Yesterday I had the opportunity to go to the library and I looked 
for the other volumes of the chaturvargachintamani.  Unfortunately they 
have gone missing or have been misfiled or something.  I did come across 
another interesting book which actually may have been the original source 
I used.  It is an old Nirnaya Sagar edition of the 
Vajasaneyi Samhita of the Shuklayajurveda and after the title page, there 
is a woodcut of "hemAdrikR^itachaturvargachintAmaNau vratakhaNDe 
vishvakarmashAstravAkyAt veda svarUpANi"  I have uploaded it at
http://www.scribd.com/doc/50305928/veda-murtis (caution: its a 3MB file.)

You are right.  The shloka for the R^igveda says rAsabhAnanaH.  Also the 
picture looks more like a donkey than a bull.  The mudra is given as 
adhyayana not vyAkhyana but it can be considered a synonym.

I find it interesting that the source for these comes from vishvakarma 
(i.e. shilpa) shastra.  Are there are any mandirs in India that actually 
have such murtis?
