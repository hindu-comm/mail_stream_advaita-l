Dear Venkatesh Murty,

parAshara saMhita is the pramANa grantha for the hanumad janana & hanumad upAsana.

The 2nd chapter of parAshara saMhita details how Hanuman was born. He was born at Venkatachala Kshetra (now Tirumala Hills) and among the 7 hills, “anjanAdri” is identified to be the place of birth of Hanuman. 

When Hanuman was born, there were certain “sAmudrika lakShaNAs” identified on His palm such as: vajra, dwaja, shankha, chakra. He was born with sahaja kuNDala in His ears & swarna yajnOpavita with maunji bandhana across His waist. He looked like hard-core smArta brAhmaNa but with a tail behind. “dIrgha lAngula” is what is described in parAshara saMhita. 

BTW, the Rg Veda hints the “hanumad tattva” as:

mamacchana tE maghavan vyansO nivividhvA
apa-hanu jaghAna adhAnaviddha uttarO
babhUvA cchirO dAsasya saMpiNa gvadhEna 

and other rik as:

asusvadhA makSharannApO asyA(a)vardhata
Madhya A nAvyAnAM saghrIchInEna manasA
taM indra OjiShThEna hanmanA hanmabhidyuH 

Hope you might have got the hints in the above 2 rks of Rg veda.

Hanuman is described to be an aspect of Agni & Vayu tattvas and hence to depict His majestic Form of Agni & Vayu swarupa, the story of Rudra Virya & Vayu Anugraha.

Regs,
Sriram
