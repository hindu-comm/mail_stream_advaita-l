Dears
The Upanishad uses the word -Kridan Sthreebhihi-which has a gender bias and 
that may be the reason for Sri Venkatesh murthy`s seeking the Sri Sankara 
Bhashyam for the same.When everything is Brahman in the yonder world why 
this variance?.May be just to give a measure of happiness on a mundane scale 
it is said like that.But I am not competent to make a comment like that.That 
is why Sri Venkatesh is searching for Bhashyam I think.R,Krishnamorthy.
