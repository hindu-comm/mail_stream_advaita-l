Namaste

What is Adi Sankara's opinion on Chandogya Upanishad 8:12 3 ? Dvaitis
say this Upanishad Mantra gives how the Jeeva enjoys Moksha. In Moksha
sometimes he has sex with women. Sometimes he dances. Sometimes he
drives chariots and horses. Etc.

What is this? Is this Moksha or heavenly enjoyment ?
