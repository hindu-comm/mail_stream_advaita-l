Namaste Sri Subrahmanian

If Brahman is Avachya the Veda Vakya Ayam Atma Brahma and Aham
Brahmasmi are saying the Self Atma is Avachya also. If you ask Who are
you the correct answer is silence. The Atma is taught by Veda only not
other sources.

Then we get one interesting question.  Ramana Maharshi said always ask
Who am I Who am I. But silence is only correct answer. What is the
point in asking Who am I again and again?  You can ask the same
question crore times but the answer is always silence. How to proceed?
Kindly clear this confusion.
