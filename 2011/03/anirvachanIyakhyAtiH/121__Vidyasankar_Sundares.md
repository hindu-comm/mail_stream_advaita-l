First, an admin note: A one line response like the above does not need 
three paragraphs of quotation in the message. In general, please keep
your posts relevant to this list and exercise good judgement over the
style, tone and quality of your messages.

Second, a response to your question: At any given point of time, every
human being always has some kind of answer to the question "who am
I?" The only problem as far as vedAnta is concerned is that except for
one right answer, all others rely upon misidentifications of this "I".
These are to be discarded, layer by layer, or all at once. That is the
point of the enquiry into the Self. One does not arrive at the silence of
advaita without understanding all the noise that one imposes upon it,
rejecting this noise, and then going through the discipline of Self-enquiry
(in whatever form). Although the innermost silence is never really lost
anywhere anytime, all the noise of vyavahAra gets in the way of abiding
in that silence.

If the answer is already known as silence, then one should not create 
more noise. Else, one should put on the noise-cancelling headphones
represented by the process of Self-enquiry.

Regards,
Vidyasankar
