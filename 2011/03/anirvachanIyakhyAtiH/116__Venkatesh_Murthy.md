Namaste Sri Subrahmanian

Some people say Brahman also is Anirvachaniya because it cannot be
described by words. Yato Vacho Nivartante is the Vakya.  The mind also
cannot understand it cannot imagine it. Siva Mahimna Stotra Sloka is
this

तव तत्त्वं न जानामि कीदृशोऽसि महेश्वर।

यादृशोऽसि महादेव तादृशाय नमो नमः॥ ४१॥

I do not know the truth of your nature and how you are. My Pranams to
you Mahadeva however you are.

The words cannot describe Brahman.

There is confusion now regarding Anirvachaniya-tva. Kindly explain.
