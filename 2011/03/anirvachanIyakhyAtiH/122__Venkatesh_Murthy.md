Namaste

I feel giving Dana is a better way to get Jnana than Self Inquiry like
Who am I. In another email reply to Sri Bhaskar I explained for us
Manushyas Dana is best path. Donating something a man cuts his
attachment to that thing. Man is attacked by Ajnana because of This is
mine feeling all the time. He thinks of his possessions always and it
prevents him from success. With attachments removed he can know Self
as it is with no external disturbance. 'Idam Na Mama' this is not mine
is better than questioning 'Ko smi' Who am I. The Idam Na Mama is the
magic formula for success. The Puranas also stress the high importance
of Dana in Kali Yuga.
