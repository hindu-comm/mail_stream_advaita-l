I am very much interested in Indian Philosophy in general and advaita-vedanta 
in particular.  I want to access the original Sanskrit text in a digital form 
which is helpful in writing of my blog www.travelblog.vromon at net.com which 
deals with various unknown or lesser known places of India and I try to give 
detailed exposition of the places with their spiritual and cultural 
background.  In fact, it is an attempt to explore the various facets of India 
and Indology.
