Chandrashekar
-------------

I am a smartha brahmin by birth and practice daily sandhya and nitya 
devatharchana wherever I am in the world with or without my panchapatra and 
other pooja materials.  I want to know some of the meanings of the mantras 
that i use.

Janakinath
----------

Dear brothers,

I grew up in a family which is devoted to Gayatri pariwar under the 
guidance of Pt. Shriram Sharma Acharya. While on a abroad visit, I had 
chance to read Gospel of SriRamakrishna by M. and am shaken to core by 
the bhakti taught by the paramahamsa. I am on quest to realise truth and 
any information available in this domain would surely be helpful in 
swadhyaya and in progress.

My salutations to all in the group, as you are already on the path laid 
out by seers.

Thanks for the time 
Janakinath
