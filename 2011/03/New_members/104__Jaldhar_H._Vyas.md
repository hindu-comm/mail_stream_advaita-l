Ramakrishna
-----------

I am interested in studying vedanta and other advaitic scriptures for the 
past many years. And am regularly studying these and also now and then peep 
into other advaita internet groups for lively discussions on different 
topics on advaita and allied subjects.

Regards,
Ramakrishna

Namaskar. 
I am interested to learn about vedic scriptures and the knowledge hidden in 
that treasure that helps to evolve my soul spiritually, - not by studying 
them or interpretting them, but by understanding the discussions and 
meanings that experts like you bring in on this blog, in simple terms 
comphrehendable by a common man/woman and adapt as applicable in everyday 
living. 
Thanks for all guidance/info you provide here for a healthy & spiritual 
living.
