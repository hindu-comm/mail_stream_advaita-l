This is with reference to the above topic.Here the term means how the Supreme 
Truth can be expressed verbally.But,Brahman is real.It is "Trikalabadhita 
satya"."Brahma satyam,jagan mithya,jivo Brahmaiva na parah".here,Brahman is the 
only Truth,but Jagat is mithya.Here,Mithya is described as niether truth nor 
untruth.It is inexpreesible.This is called "Anirvacaniya."
Regards,
 N.Srikanta.
