Dear Mr. Hernandez

Salutations to you.

There are well known methods to study both vedanta and the Rig Veda independently. You will find enough about how to go about studying Vedanta adequately on this list (there were many such in the past as well - just search the archives); so I will write a few lines with respect to studying the Rig Veda. 

To get familiar with Rig Veda, I guess the basic study of a few suktas - say 50, chosen from various maNDalas - at word by word level is a good method. This teaches how the Vedic language uses roots, prepositions, case-endings, words etc. in a much richer way than what we see in classical Sanskrit and the stylistic elements of the Vedic, especially the method of narration, the recurrent themes (say, Indra killing Vritraasura and releasing the waters; causing the cows stolen by Panis to be returned etc.) and the way intuition takes precedence over proof.

Mostof the hymns in the first nine maNDalas come under what we call arthavAda (eulogy); the philosophical hymns are mostly found towards the end of the tenth maNDala. If one directly tackles them, it might be easy to read far less into them than one who is familiar with the Vedic language and style does.

You have a wealth of resources to undertake this study. Max Muller edited the bhaashya by SaayaNaachaarya, the standard reference work. His second edition sponsored by the Maharaja of Vizianagaram is the better one. He has also written a a History of Ancient Indian Literature. Then A. A. McDonell has written a grammar of the Vedic language; his anthology called "A Vedic Reader"and selections titled"Hymns from Rig Veda" by McDonell and Peterson provide you withenough material.

Good luck to you.

Regards
N. Siva Senani
