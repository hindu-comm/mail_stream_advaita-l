Personally, I like the sanskrit posts.  The girvana bhasha is the 
foundation of the culture that Advaita Vedanta is embedded in and 
knowledge of sanskrit is vital if one wants to study it in depth.  And 
don't worry about the foreigners.  You would be pleasantly surprised as to 
how much effort some of them have put into learning Sanskrit.  If there is 
anyone of any color who wants to learn but has problems understanding, the 
answer is to teach them not to bring things down to the lowest common 
denominator.

Having said all that, there are problems albeit of a technical nature. 
Not everyone is set up to display devanagari text properly.  And it would 
be a technical support nightmare to get everyone set up.  So I suggest 
using a transliteration scheme like ITRANS instead of devanagari.
