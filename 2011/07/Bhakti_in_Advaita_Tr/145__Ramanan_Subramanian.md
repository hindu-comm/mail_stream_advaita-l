Thought I should give the exact reference for this: The instance of the
quotations occurs in Vedanta-Kalpataru, 1.3.33 (8th Adhikarana):

"tathA tAvocan AcAryAH prapa~jcasAre:

'avani-jalAnala-mAruta-vihAyAsAM shaktibhish-ca tad-bimbaiH |
sArUpyaM Atmanash-ca pratiniitvA tat-tad-Ashu jayati sudhiiH ||'

iti"

The verse quoted occurs in Prapanchasara section mentioning meditation on
the Omkara.
