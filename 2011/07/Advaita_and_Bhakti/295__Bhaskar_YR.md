This is probably not the forum for a detailed discussion of Sri Swamijiâ€™s 
writings.

praNAms Sri Subhanu prabhuji
Hare Krishna

I am surprised to see this statement.  If what Sri SSS written in his 
works is 'as per' shankara, why should we not discuss it in a list 
exclusively dedicated to the teachings 'as taught' by bhagavatpAda??  We 
have been seeing lot of references from the works of Swamy Dayananda 
Saraswati, Swamy chinmayananda, Swamy paramArthananada, Sri Mani Dravida 
Shastrigal etc. in this list.  Dont you feel that Sri SSS's works worth a 
place for a detailed discussion in this group atleast occasionally if not 
regularly??

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
