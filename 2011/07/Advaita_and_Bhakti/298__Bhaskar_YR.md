another, for example, is the wrongly attributed view to him that he 
believes that through viveka alone a direct
experience of Atman can accrue.

I think a little elaboration on your above observation is required. 
Otherwise it would lead to further questions i.e. whether shAstra vAkya 
janita viveka (through shravaNAdi sAdhana) would fetch us 'yathArtha 
jnAna' or not??  whether after this viveka, is there any 'vidhi' to be 
completed to 'experience' the Atman??  whether this viveka which is not 
able to give us the experience of Atman, is all about 'kevala avasthAtraya 
viveka, which is as enshrined in the shruti itself ?? or after this 
viveka, whether any additonal sAdhana is required to directly 'experience' 
the Atman??   etc.  So, when we talk about a particular term 'viveka' 
which is unable to give us direct (aparOksha) experience of Atman, we have 
to be clear whether this viveka is out of shAstra janita viveka or 
independent viveka like avasthAtraya viveka done independently without 
shruti/shAstra aid?? I think this is what Sri Atmachaitanya prabhuji also 
discussed/contested in Sri SSS's list.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
