I was able to download 24 Sanskrit books. Others are unavailable.
I clicked book's name. It opened a pop-up or a new tab(depending on browser
used). Then it asked to save djvu file. That's it.
Try it once.
Try different browsers.
Check your connection speed.

Otherwise inform me personally. I'll try to help.
