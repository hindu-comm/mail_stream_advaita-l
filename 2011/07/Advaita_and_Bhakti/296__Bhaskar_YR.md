It is therefore incorrect to state that the path to knowledge as laid out 
by Shankaraâ€™s advaita tradition is devoid of Bhakti.

praNAms Sri Subhunu prabhuji
Hare Krishna

Yes, Sri SSS has shown this in his various independent works & in geeta 
bhAshya as well.  Sri SSS used to mention that 'shankara is not a logician 
but he is a saint'!! The role of bhakti in shankara's advaita sAdhana is 
quite conspicuous in his introduction to 56th verse in chapter 18 of geeta 
bhAshya : svakarmaNA bhagavataH abhyarchana bhakti yOgasya siddhiprAptiH 
phalaM jnAnanishTAyOgyatA yannimittA jnAnanishTA mOkshaphalAvasAnA, sa 
bhagavadbhaktiyOgaH athunA stUyate shAstrArtha upasaMhAra prakaraNe 
shAstrArtha nishchaya dArdhyAya.  Sri SSS's Kannada work 'shankara vedAnta 
sAra' would discuss the aspect of 'bhakti' in shankara vedAnta in a 
detailed way.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
