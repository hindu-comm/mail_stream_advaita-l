RV: For my research, I rely on experts in the subjects required (grammar,
logic, philosophy etc.) and do not claim scholarship though as I said making
an attempt to build it. In my primary school, the teacher appreciated me
when I wrote 128 + 128 = 256. In my high school, my teacher called me a
number one fool for saying that. He asked me to first ask which system the
sum is set in. So, 128 + 128 = 250 in hexadecimal. When I deal with higher
mathematics or physics, I dont go with primary school thinking. If I did, I
wont be able to understand how an electron can simultaneously exist in
multiple places or quantum entanglement allows instant exchange of
information across space! We need higher mathematics for deeper
understanding.

Having interacted with a few scholars who have spent decades in sanskrit,
logic and philosophy, I am able to understand that the language is very
intricate. I have learnt not to take any thing for granted on the face value
because each letter is pregnant with multiple meanings. I have not done an
analysis of the roots of sahodara and sagotra but have seen sagotra used in
the context same family (gotra-jah). Tamil is no ordinary language and
maruval or change of words is no accident there due to limitation in terms
of texts. Hence I said, I wont be surprised if there is mutual relation
between the words.

It is interesting that my main point is not discussed. It defends the
tradition in super-excellent terms. If my logic incorrect, no one has
pointed it out. There is an urge to call me a fool with all these empty
verbiage when I have directly stated that myself in my own post. I consider
it my greatest achievement in this life to have understand that despite my
member in High IQ Societies, I am highly ignorant. The only greater
achievement is my fortune to come in contact with the works of great
acharyas who I believe are sarvajna. I may be wrong but probably not.
