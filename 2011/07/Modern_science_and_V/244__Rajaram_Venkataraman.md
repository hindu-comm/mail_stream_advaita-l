Dear Sri Srikanta,

I saw a post from you that Madhusudana differs from Sankara but could not
trace your mail - hence unable to quote it. You were referring to Advaita
Siddhi without specific references where you allege that Madhusudana differs
from Sankara. Scholars come up with such views and it is unforuntately
posted by Sri Vidyasankar also on his site also. As far as I have seen, true
to his word, he has exposited on the commentary of Sankara throwing light on
the meanings inherent in the works of the acharya. The apparent
contradictions are either different readings admissibile within the
tradition or a misreading by the scholars. Madhusudana, who is revered as a
jivan mukta by his disciple, considers himself to be like gunja and Sankara
to be like gold - incomparable. Of course, the gold, that is Madhusudana,
can be tested for his loyalty to his tradition.

Why dont you please post with specific references why you say Madhusudana
differs from Sankara?

Best Regards
Rajaram Venkataramani
