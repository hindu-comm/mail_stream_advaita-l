Hari Om Shri Subrahmanianji, Pranaams!

When madhusUdanaji says 'tat shabda ananvayAt'; why 'tat' is changed to 'tatra' in your prediction.

madhusUdanaji uses two 'yatra' while explaining succeeding verse. 1. yatra -(yasmin avastha-visheShe) - Atyantikam....... 2. yatra ca sthitaH ayaM vidvAn.... Where is the second yatra in the verse sukham Atyantikam yat tat ...... How does madhusUdanaji explains the words 'yat' and 'tat' of verse 21. 

In Shri Guru Smriti,
Br. Pranipata Chaitanya
