I just wanted to know how you arrive at above conclusion.  The translation 
of gambhIrAnandaji for the sentence ' yatra kAle iti tu vyAkhyAnam asAdhu 
tat shabda ananvayAt' reads - 'The explanation of yatra as 'at the time 
when' is inappropriate since the word tat, that, stands 
isconnected'.  --which implies a word 'tat' in the verse is not explained 
(not included in the vyAkhyAna) and not some thing is not brought in like 
'tatra kAle'. You will also observe that 'yasmin avasthA visheShe' is not 
corelated by 'tasmin avasthA visheShe' by madhusUdanaji and hence such 
objection will become untenable.
