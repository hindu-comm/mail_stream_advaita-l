he concludes saying: तस्मिन्काले योगसिद्धिर्भवतीति शेषः [during that time
the consummation of Yoga takes place.  This is to be included (in the
verse/Shankara's commentary.)

I think MS takes the twin words 'yat-tat' in verse 21 as simply 'yatra'.
सुखमात्यन्तिकं यत्र बुद्धिग्राह्यमतीन्द्रियम्. Or he does not feel the need
to comment upon yat-tat.  At least this is how it appears to me now.  The
first use of 'yatra' is that way accounted for.  The second use 'yatra cha',
of course is there in the verse itself.

More analysis is welcome.
