RV: Dvaitins have not said that. Even if Madhusudana is targetting the
attack on someone else, it will also fall on Sankara because Sankara uses
yatra in the sense of time. If he is right, then Sankara makes basic
grammatical mistakes. If he is wrong, then he is making basic grammatical
mistakes. My view is that he does not target anyone else but only explains
why he is not using time-sense due to difference in reading.
