Namaste:

>>>>>>>>>>>>
Adi shankara never started the Panchayatana puja to unify the 
country,much less the mutts as they are today.This has been contested by the HH Holenarsipur Swamiji,Sri Sri Sachidanandendra 
Saraswatiji.
<<<<<<<<<

If this so please tell us who initroduced the ""pa~Nacaayanata puujaa" ?
Why were various stones used for representing various devataa's?
I will request Shri Bhaskar to clarify SSS's position.

At least on this list, I have never seen any agreement of SSS position presented by his ardent followers.


Do all maThaadhipati agree with any views of other's? If "Yes" please provide examples.


>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

Moreover,one has to try for individual Moksha only.It 
requires certain prerequisites and merits.Not all can strive for 
individual moksha.It requires certain quality and sadhana.Samajika 
moksha is out of question.
<<<<<<<<<<

Can you please define and elaborate on your understanding of the term "moksha"?


Thanks

Dr. Yadu
