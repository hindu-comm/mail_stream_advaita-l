RV: You are confusing between the connection and lack of it in the verses
and how Sankara reads them. If you simply see any decent translation like
Gambhirananda, you will see that for Sankara 6.20 makes sense independently
as separated by a ";" and so does 6.21 and 6.22. But in the case of
Madhusudana, the connection is implied by "; -" at the end of 6.20, 6.21 and
6.22 which ends with a "." in 6.23. It is not only in the use of punctuation
but also in the actual translation. For Sankara, it goes like "At the time
... one remains contented in the Self alone" (6.20), "When one experiences
that ..., being established, this person surely does not swerve from
Reality" (6.21) and "Obtainining which ... one is not perturbed even by
great sorrow" and ending with "One should know that to be what is called
Yoga" (6.22).  For Madhusudana, it goes like, "Where ... mind becomes free
from modifcations and where ... one remains contented in the Self alone
(6.20), where one experiences ... and where ... this person does not swerve
from reality (6.21) and obtaining which ... superior to that and ... one is
not perturbed even by great sorrow (6.22), you should know that severence of
contact with sorrow to be what is called yoga (6.23). I think [{()}] have
value in programming but not in grammar. I dont want you to take my word for
it but study it along with a grammarian instead of coming to a conclusion
without required knowledge of grammar.

However, it should be obvious that except for the difference in interpreting
this one word,
MS and Sankara are saying the same thing.

RV: You are missing the whole point of the discussion. There are many places
where Madhusudana differs in the meanings given to words and even
conclusions. These differences are admissible within the framework of
advaita. Nowhere does Madhusudana say Sankara is wrong and neither does he
do so here.

So, to sum up, the difference in interpretation offered by our two authors
is not merely
a result of pATha bheda. BOTH of them take verses 6.20 and 6.21 together.
The gItA
itself connects the two verses through its usage of the word yatra twice in
the former
verse and once in the latter verse and no commentator can afford to ignore
that. Both
authors have the SAME pATha of the source text, but their interpretation of
a word "yatra"
differs. In the larger picture, the difference in interpretation is of minor
consequence, but
it is nevertheless there. One cannot pin it down to pATha bheda, nor can one
brush it
away with a claim that MS does not differ from Sankara, because MS most
definitely
does differ from Sankara in his interpretation and explicitly so.
RV: As I have tried to show about, it is how they read verses together and
separately. I rest it here.
