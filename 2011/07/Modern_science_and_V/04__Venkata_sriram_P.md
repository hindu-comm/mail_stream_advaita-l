Bhaskarji,

Pls go thru the LS carefully. It is not to Lalita but offered to yogini gaNAs that 
preside over sapta (7) dhAtus which in turn govern sapta chakras. 
 
They are:

mUlAdhAra chakra - asthi dhatu - sAkini (fond of mudgAnna)
svAdhiShTana chakra- mEdhO dhatu - kAkini (fond of dadhyanna)
maNipUra chakra- mAmsa dhatu - lAkini (fond of Gudanna)
anAhaTa chakra - raktha dhatu - rAkini (fond of snidhanna)
vishuddhi chakra- tvak dhatu - DAkini (fond of payasanna)
Ajna chakra- majja dhatu - hAkini (fond of haridranna)
sahasrAra chakra- sukra dhatu - yAkini (fond of sarvanna)

These yoginis are again mAtrika saktis only that start with sa-ka-la-ra-da-ha-ya mAtrika gaNA samUhAs. 

Yes, offering of naivedyAs is for kAmya karma and it is the antaryajana that 
is preferrable for jnAnis. Such a state where tripuTi laya is achieved, it is
said to be the srividya upAsana siddhi (kEna navarandhra rUpa dEhaH navachakra rUpaM srIchakraM........jnAtru-jnAna-jnEyAnAM abhEda bhAvanaM srIchakra pUjanaM )

This navarandhrAtmaka dEha (upAsakA's body) itself is srIyantra and the chitkala in dahara akasa is Lalita. Triputi bhEdana is Srividya Siddhi. And that is what Acharya Sankara's mata as far as sAkta vidya is concerned.

sriram
