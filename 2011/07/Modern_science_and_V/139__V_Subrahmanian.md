Just for the record:

'vinAyaka' in the above context means 'garuDa', 'vi (bird) nAyaka (foremost)
or 'vihanga nAyaka'.  In Tirupati, etc. there is a 'garuDa vAhana', 'ashva
vAhana' sevas for the Utsava mUrti of the Lord.  The song captures these two
postures of the Lord by the two words: vinAyaka-turagArUDham.

Incidentally, the word 'विः’ also means a horse!!.  Then the meaning of the
compound: विनायक-तुरगारूढम् could mean (leaving out the 'garuDa'): the
foremost, best, horse (could be उच्चैःश्रवा - Bh.Gita 10.27) which the Lord
chooses to ride - उच्चैःश्रवा नामतुरगारूढम्.   Shankara comments for this
word:  उच्चैःश्रवा नामाश्वराजः तं मां विद्धि विजानीहि अमृतोद्भवं
अमृतनिमित्तमथनोद्भवम् ।  [ucchaiHshravA is the King of horses that emerged
during the churning of the Ocean of Milk for extracting amRtam.]

The dictionary lists yet another meaning for the word 'vinAyaka' - a
Buddhist deifiedTeacher.
