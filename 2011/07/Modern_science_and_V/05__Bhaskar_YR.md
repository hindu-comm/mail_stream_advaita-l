praNAms Sri Sriram prabhuji
Hare Krishna

These yoginis are again mAtrika saktis only 

>  prabhuji, you are one of the authorities on these issues. kindly tell 
me is these mAtrika saktis are not different manifestations of same mAta?? 
 If not, why then sahasranAma says 'hAkini rUpa dhAriNi' lAkini rUpa 
dhAriNi', kAkini rUpa dhAriNi etc. (since she loves the curd rice so much 
she will take the form of crow etc.)  and in devi kavacha (in durga sapta 
shati) durgamAta is clearly depicted as shAkini, dAkini etc.  If these 
shakti-s are entirely different from durgA mAta then there is no need to 
put these names as lalita in sahasranAma.  And I remember, swamy 
harshAnanda,  in his bhAvArtha on durga saptashati, clearly says these 
sapta mAtruka-s are the different manifestations of 'same' shakti'.  And 
as you know the main hOma dravya in chandikA hOma is 'gudAnna'(rice mixed 
with jaggery) ...So according to the above, gudAnna preeta mAnasa devi and 
her worship is also tAmasa!!??  Kindly correct me if I said anything wrong 
here.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
