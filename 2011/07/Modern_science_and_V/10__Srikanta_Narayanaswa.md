Bhakthi is necessary for seekers who are unable to understand Vichara.One 
has to take a quantum jump from Bhakthi or karma to Advaita marga.No where 
he has stated Bhakthi is necessary for this.

praNAms Sri Srikanta prabhuji
Hare Krishna

I hope you have Sri SSS's Kannada book 'bhakti chadrike'...wherein Sri SSS 
insists the importance of bhakti in advaita sAdhana with some invaluable 
quotes from shruti, smruti & purAna. 

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar

Dear Sri Bhaskerji
I have the book"Bhakthi Chandrike"written by HHSR SRISRI Sachidanandendra Saeaswathiji regarding the Bhakthi.He has also unequvocally stated that Bhakthi is not an alternative means to "Jnana".Infact,this is where he differs from other Vyakyanakaras like Ramakrishna mutt,and others.The emphasis he gives in closely following the "Prasthan trayi"amply clears this doubt.
N.Srikanta.
