Here is one opinion of mine which, however, is subject to closer examination
by others here:

MS in that commentary has said this: यत्र यस्मिन्परिणामविेशेषे योगसेवया
योगाभ्यासपाटवेन जाते सति चित्तं निरुद्धं .....यत्र च यस्मिंश्च परिणामे सति
....

My point/observation is that when a सति-सप्तमी is used it comes out of the
type where a yatra is required to be followed by a tatra.  This is because
this type of a saptamI simply says about the fulfillment of a condition and
not of the type 'when...then'.  गृहे निर्मिते सति जनाः वासाय आगच्छन्ति ।

Maybe others will offer their comments on the above observation.

I thankfully realize that I need not have gone up to the K.Up. [किमर्थं
तावत्पर्यन्तं धावनम्?]  when as Sri Vidyasankar pointed out, there is the
6.18 verse in the BG itself talking of yadaa - tadaa.  I am reminded of a
verse in the Gaudapada kArikA 3.32:

आत्मसत्यानुबोधेन न संकल्पयते यदा ।
अमनस्तां तदा याति ग्राह्याभावे तदग्रहम् ॥

Here too Shankara has commented: यदा यस्मिन्काले तदा तस्मिन्काले
