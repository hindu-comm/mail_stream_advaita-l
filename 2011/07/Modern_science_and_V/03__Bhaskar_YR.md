praNAms Sri Yadu prabhuji 
Hare Krishna 

If this so please tell us who initroduced the ""pa~Nacaayanata puujaa" ? 

>  Sri SSS's observations on issues like this will mostly be based on 
prasthAna traya bhAshya & US.  He simply observes that since there is no 
mention of these things in prasthAna trayi bhAshya, it is subject to 
further scrutiny, But point to be noted here is he never said that since 
it is not there in shankara's works it is 'akshmya aparAdha' to worship 
paNchAyatana devata-s:_)),   Anyway, kindly let me know in which of the 
work attributed to shankara it is said that he is shaNmata sthApanAchArya 
but advocated ONLY five deities worship.   If there is no categorical 
authentic evidence for this, then we will have to go by the statement 
that..it is only a traditional belief that bhAshyakAra is the proponent of 
paNchAyatana pUja paddhati !! 


At least on this list, I have never seen any agreement of SSS position 
presented by his ardent followers. 

>  If all are unanimous with everything without any disagreement, there 
will be no 'sAra' in the list discussion prabhuji.  Anyway, I dont think 
singling out Sri SSS on this issue is fair since there is hell a lot of 
difference of opinion among members on various issues who are not 
followers of Sri SSS :-)) But I do agree, me, the 'socalled' ONLY Sri SSS 
follower is more vociferous than others in this list.   

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!! 
bhaskar
