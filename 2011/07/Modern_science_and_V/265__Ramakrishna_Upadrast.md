praNAms Shri Subbu-ji,

Thanks for the nice clarification. Is it possible that this
"objection" is not really an objection, but one which may be mirroring
the objection raised by contemporary vedantins of MS (namely
dvaitins), or one which answers the objection raised by the latter?

namaste
Ramakrishna
