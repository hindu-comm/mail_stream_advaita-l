 Sri: Subrahmanian V: It looks like while Shankara is emphasizing the

> Would anyone explain the above and say if Shankara's commentary truly

Sri Vidyasankar, this is what I meant by patha bheda or difference in
reading. Without understanding your view on vedanta bhakti in depth, I
cannot comment on whether I see it exactly as you do.
