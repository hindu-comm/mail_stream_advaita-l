When everything ends with Jnana,where is the question of Bhakthi which 
means separation or Dvaita Bhava?

Yes, you are right when everything ends in Atmaikatva  jnAna there is no 
room to think about dvaita bhakti which makes clear difference between 
bhakta & bhagavanta.  But in advaita the term bhakti has been used little 
bit differently.  If you see the geeta bhAshya shankara clearly says 
teshAm jnAni nitya yuktaH, eka bhaktiH vishishyate.  Here there is no 
dvaita bhakti, there is absolutely no difference between bhakta & 
bhagavanta...he is 'nitya yukta'.  tattva vitvAt nitya yuktaH bhavati, 
ekabhaktishcha anyasya bhajaneeyasya adarshanAt ataH saH ekabhaktiH 
vishishyate..shankara clarifies further in that bhAshya.  This is called 
parAbhakti wherein there is no difference between kshetrajna and Ishwara 
bheda, and this is what is called highest bhakti in the 18th chapter of 
geeta bhAshya. 

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
