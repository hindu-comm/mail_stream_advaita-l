Adi shankara never started the Panchayatana puja to unify the 
country,much less the mutts as they are today.This has been contested by the HH Holenarsipur Swamiji,Sri Sri Sachidanandendra 
Saraswatiji.
<<<<<<<<<

If this so please tell us who initroduced the ""pa~Nacaayanata puujaa" ?
Why were various stones used for representing various devataa's?
I will request Shri Bhaskar to clarify SSS's position.

At least on this list, I have never seen any agreement of SSS position presented by his ardent followers.


Do all maThaadhipati agree with any views of other's? If "Yes" please provide examples.


>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

Moreover,one has to try for individual Moksha only.It 
requires certain prerequisites and merits.Not all can strive for 
individual moksha.It requires certain quality and sadhana.Samajika 
moksha is out of question.
<<<<<<<<<<

Can you please define and elaborate on your understanding of the term "moksha"?


Thanks

Dr. Yadu

Adi Shankara lived for only 32 years.Most of his time as we learn from the Shankara vijayam he spent his time debating with the rival schools and writing his Bhashyams.In his Bhashyams he has never indicated on the "Puja"aspects.What we gather from his commentaries on the Bhagawadgita,brahmasutras and the Upanishads we see a highly enlightened spirit in whose commentaries is enshrined the Truth in the most logical and lucid way the Quintessence of the Vedanta.The vedantas that are mosquerading these days were never in existence.Only Adwaita was recognised as Vedanta.Many later successors who were called also as shankaracharyas as a title might have introduced these modes of worships.

As I have said not all can strive for "moksha"atleast not with the wordly interest and corruption as we see today."Moksha"is a term which is a state of mind where there is contentment,inward peace and tranquility.I can only quote the Bhagawadgita verses forthe state of 'Moksha":
'Apuryamanam acalam pratishtam
samudramapah pravishanti yadvat"

and also:
"Ya nisha sarvabhutanam tasmatjagrathi samyami
Tasmat jagrti bhutani saa nisha pasyato muneh"

Samajika moksha which even the politicians are trying to establish,we see how hypocrtical it is.Even Buddha's "bahu jana hitaya, bahu jana sukhaya"met with failure.
Regards,
N.Srikanta.
