I have a doubt regarding the jIrNa yajnOpavIta visarjana.  

> praNAms 
Hare Krishna

>  both practices (upwards & downwards) prevalent but one should follow 
according to his saMpradAya says snAna, sandhyAvandanAdi vidhi, published 
by Mattur shruti shankara saMshOdhana Kendra, chief editor Mattur Keshava 
Avadhani.  And some in vaidika circle here in Bangalore say when there is 
nUtana yajnOpaveeta dhAraNa & visarjana due to 'mrutAshoucha' it will be 
strictly downwards, again no pramANa quoted.  And after removing we do cut 
atleast one thread to make mantra 'upaveetaM bhinna tantum' real :-)) But 
sofar I have not come across any shAstra pramANa for this. 

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
