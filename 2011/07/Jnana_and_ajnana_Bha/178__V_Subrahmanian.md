Having confirmed with Vidwan Mani Dravid Sastrigal I would like to inform
that the terms 'tarka' and 'nyAya' are two words to denote the same system.

//The Nyaya is sometimes called Tarka-Vidy훮 or the Science of Debate,
V훮da-Vidy훮 or the Science of Discussion. Tarka is the special feature of the
Ny훮ya. <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ny%C4%81ya_S%C5%ABtras#cite_note-2>//

*//Nyaya* Vidya or *Tarka* Sastra.//
