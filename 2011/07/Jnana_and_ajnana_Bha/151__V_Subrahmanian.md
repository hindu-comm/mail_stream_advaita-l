Even though almost all of what you have said by way of
clarifying/elucidating does not give  me any understanding, I am trying to
know whoever stated the following position that you have characterized as
'illogical':

And a position that "I have general ignorance but knowledge
> of all particular objects" is illogical because it is like saying "I know
> every one but I dont know any one".

// even though there is a generalized, hazy, aspaShTa knowledge about any
object initially, there coexists ajnAna too about that very object with
respect to the particularities. //

I think the contrast between the position stated by me and the one
annotated/paraphrased by you is quite obvious.

There is a Panchadashi verse where Vidyaranya gives an example for the
phenomenon of 'knowledge and ignorance co-existing':

अध्येतृवर्गमध्यस्थपुत्राध्ययनशब्दवत् ।
*भानेऽप्यभानं* भानस्य प्रतिबन्धेन युज्यते ॥१२॥ (प्रयक्तत्त्वविवेकः)
A father has left his boy in a gurukula.  He comes on a visit to the place.
>From a distance he is able to hear the boys there chanting the veda.  He is
aware that his boy too is in the group; yet he is not able to discern his
boy's voice from the group's chanting sound.  The authoritative commentary
of Sri Ramakrishna concludes: भानेऽप्यभानम् -  *सामान्यतः* प्रतीतावपि *
विशेषाकारेणा*प्रतीतिर्युज्यते उपपद्यते इत्यर्थ: ।  One can see the close
similarity between the Shankara bhashya passage and the above
verse/commentary.
