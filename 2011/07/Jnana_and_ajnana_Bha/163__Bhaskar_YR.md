The learned scholars on this forum should explain why Madhusudana asserts 
that bhakti is a distinct marga and paramapurushartha. 

praNAms Sri Rajaram prabhuji
Hare Krishna

IMO, it is a well known fact that acclamation of the particular topic is 
quite usual when that particular topic has been discussed & highlighted in 
a chapter exclusively dedicated to that topic.  I think madhusudana's 
ranking bhakti over jnAna is eulogy of 'bhakti' in bhakti yOga which 
cannot be considered as his 'parama siddhAnta' or charama vAkya on mOksha. 
 Anyway, you are welcome to disagree with me and wait for more authentic 
answers from the prabhuji-s who have studied Sri madhusUdana saraswati's 
works more deeply.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
