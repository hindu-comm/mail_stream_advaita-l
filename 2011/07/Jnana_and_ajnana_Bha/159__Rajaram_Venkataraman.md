Is there  sakshi ajnana? :) I don't think you get it though you claim
to be smarter than Vyasatirtha and Madhusudana. If it makes you happy,
feel free to hold that opinion.

I'd like to move on with developing my understanding of bhakti and
jnana in advaita please. I'm interested in the opinions advaitins held
around the time of sankara. It will allow me to compare and contrast
with what Madhusudana wrote. Thanks.
