One tongue-in-the-cheek answer is:

मन एव मनुष्याणां कारणं बन्धमोक्षयो:
बन्धाय विषयासक्तं मुक्त्यै निर्विषयं स्मृतम्

The mind alone is the cause of bondage and liberation.  A mind that is
engrossed in objects (of the world) is what is bound and the mind that is
free of the (afflictions) of the objects is liberated.

mAyA is the cause of ajnAna and jnAna.  The tamas aspect of mAyA/prakRti
deludes/binds - अज्ञानं तमसः फलम् - of the Bh.Gita 14th ch. The sattva
aspect of mAya enlightens/liberates: सत्त्वात् सञ्जायते ज्ञानम् of the same
gita chapter.  Atman is guNAteeta/gunArahita and is never bound or
liberated.
