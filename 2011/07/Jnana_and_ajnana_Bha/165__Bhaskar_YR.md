And tried his best to reconcile bhakti and advaita siddhanta but had to 
differ from Sankara in many places (BG
18.66). 

praNAms Sri Rajaram prabhuji
Hare Krishna

This is really a news to me prabhuji as I have not studied Sri MadhusUdana 
in depth.  Though I knew that madhusUdana did differ from shankara (sri 
vidya prabhuji also observes this in his home page on advaita, under post 
shankara acharya-s, I read it long before donot remember exact words )on 
certain issues I did not know that he differs in most important mOksha 
mArga also from shankara & suggests an alternative to jnAna mArga & grades 
bhakti mArga over jnAna!!!  Anyway, as far as shankara concerned, he is 
quite categorical in his stand that there is no other way other then jnAna 
mArga...vedAnta vAkya shravaNa, mananAdi sAdhana is the ONLY means for 
Atma jnAna.  na hi jnAnena sadrusham is the declaration of geetachArya.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
