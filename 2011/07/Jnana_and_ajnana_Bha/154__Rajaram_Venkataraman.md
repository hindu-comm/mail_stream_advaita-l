Knowledge and Ignorance of the same object cannot co-exist in the cognizer.
One cannot have the experience of the type "I know there is an object called
vyakarana and I dont know the object called vyakarana". You are confusing
between the object called vyakarana and objects that it is composed of such
as vibhakti, kala, sandhi etc. You have inferred your ignorance about
contained objects based on the knowledge that vyakarana has contents and
that you have not experienced them. To experience that "I am ignorant of an
object", you need to have the knowledge of the object.

I think you have not read my latest post which answers this (vrtti jnana and
sakshi jnana).
