If the question was unclear, you should not have answered it. I still
refuse to give marks :) for the original answer because you didn't
write about sakshi after repeated clarification of the question. You
were trying to show how jnana and ajnana can co-exist which is against
nyaya. Sankara used it in the context of knowledge of the set and
ajnana of its elements. It is very different to jnana and ajnana of an
element or object.

Now, I agree sakshi is not the cause - silly trap. Now, what is the
cause of jnana and ajnana in the cognizer?
