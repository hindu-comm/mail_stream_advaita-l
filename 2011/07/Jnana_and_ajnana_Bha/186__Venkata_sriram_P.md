Namaste,

There is a famous kirtana of Saint Tyagaraja on Ramachandra
with the title “telisi rAma chintana”. This is a telugu kirtana. 

Saint Tyagaraja urges his own mind (but the targeted
audience is ignorant jiva) to chant the rAma nAma
by knowing the rAma tattva properly. 

As rAma is parabrahma svarupa, to know Him
implies jnAna and vichAra mArga. The first verse
of the song is: 

//

telisi rAma chintana tO namamu seyavE, 
oh manasA 

//

Translation: 

In telugu, “telisi” implies being “aware & conscious”;
“rAma chintana” implies “contemplate on rAma”;
“tO” implies “alongwith / combined with”;
“nAmamu seyavE, O manasa” implies 
“O Mind, chant the Divine Name”.

Which implies that O Mind, chant the Divine Name
of Lord Rama with awareness of the true nature of
rAma tattva. 

Here "telisi rAma chintana" indicate the jnAna mArga and"nAmamu sEyavE" indicate the bhakti mArga. Both are complementary
to each other in sAdhana. Ultimately, both merge 
in brahma tattva and grant victory to the sAdhaka in the form of
brahmAnubhUti.

That is what Saint Bard Tyagabrahmendra Saraswati says in last verse as:

“vijayamu kalgunu tyAgarAjunutuni”.

This kirtana is composed in Purna Chandrika Raga and Adi Tala.

Regs,
Sriram
