pUrvapakSha-s, that is), and this mail was meant for Subbu-ji, not you.

And if at all, it is madhusUdana who would have had a gala time refuting his
pUrvapakShI-s constructs using the core concepts of advaita.

Yes, sAkShI aj~nAna is nonsensical just as absolute asat. The relative
j~nAna/aj~nAna of a pramAtA are premised on the sAkShI just as the relative
existence/non-existence of objects are premised on the sat that is brahman.
This is the whole meaning behind brahman being the substratum for the jagat.

For that matter, I don't think you get it either.
