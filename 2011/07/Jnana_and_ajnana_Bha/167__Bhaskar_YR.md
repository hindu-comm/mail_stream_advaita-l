praNAms Sri Rajaram prabhuji
Hare Krishna

It is interesting to meet someone who is so categorical about sankara.

> why go anywhere else!!??  meet shankara in shankara's prasthAna trayi 
bhAshya..has he anywhere atleast gives us the hint that bhakti is superior 
to jnAna and bhakti is a separate mArga for mOksha??  he does speak about 
the different phala of upAsana & jnAna but he never gives highest rank to 
bhakti that too at the cost of jnAna.  I would like to repeat here 
shankara : sAkshAdeva cha kAraNatvAt shravaNamanananidhidhyAsanAnAm..and 
shruti : Atma vA are drashtavyaH shrOtavyaH mantavyO nidhidhyAsitavyaH..


I don't subscribe to all that you said abour Madhusudana.

>  I have not added anything new, I just said what I gained from your 
mails...Kindly correct me if I said anything wrong on Sri Madhusudana 
Saraswati.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
