Namaste.

I thank all the members who quickly responded to my request by sending me
links and even the book in pdf.  Someone even sent a Tamil version.  I find
the sanskritdocuments resource very simple and easy to read.  I was looking
for the book on behalf of someone who  just wanted to do the paarAyaNam
during this Tamil month of 'ADi'.

Regards,
