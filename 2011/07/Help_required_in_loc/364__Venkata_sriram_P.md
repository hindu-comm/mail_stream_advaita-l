Dear Subbuji,

Here is the link in devanagari script.

//

There are some sampradAya dOShAs in this stotra and request you
to get initiated from a guru who is an initiate in Srividya.

Devi Khadgamala is deployed for Laghu Navavarana Archana of
Sriyantra and hence one should get it initiated from a satguru.
If we go by the srividya tradition, the minimum requisite to
chant this Devi Khadgamala is that one should get initiated
either in Bala Shadakshari Mahamantra or Panchadasi as
Devi Khadgamala is a "mAlA mantra" which stands apart from
normal stotras.

Seek the blessings of Sringeri Acharya.

regs,
sriram
