Dear friends,

In the Tevijja Sutta Lord Buddha preached the way the union with Brahman can be achieved. This sutta was delivered in the 19th century BCE though the exact year or the time in that century cannot be pinpointed..Astronomical dating shows that Lord Buddha was born in 1887 BCE and passed away in 1807 BCE. The recent re-evaluation of the Dotted Records also shows that this date is correct.

Regards,

Sunil K. Bhattacharjya

Dear List,

I will greatly appreciate if Member(s) could enlighten me on any discussion on the chronology of the Tevijja Sutta part of the Digha Nikaya.

Thanks
