Namaste,

I donâ€™t understand what is the problem here with jnAna & bhakti.
We are unnecessarily dragging the issue by engaging in
vAda & prativAda. 

Mahayogi Gorakhnath in Siddhasiddhanta Paddhati says :

vEdAnti bahutarkakarkashamatirgrastaH paraM mAyayA
bhATTAH karmakalAkulA hatadhiyO dvaitEna vaisheshikAH //

The vedantis with their intellect engage is great debates (vAda-prativAda with
tarka) and get "entangled" in shabda-jAla. But they don't understand that by
engaging in tarka vAda, they are slowly falling into the trap of mAyA. How
funny it is that "they deny the existence of mAyA" but get entangled into it's
mysterious trap.

All the great advaitins like Suka Brahman (who propagated bhAgavata dharma),
Lila Shuka (author of Krishna Karnamritam), Narayana Bhattatri, Bhagavannama
Bodhendra Saraswati, Sridhara Ayyaval etc. were also great devotees. 
Kanchi Mahaperiyaval & Chandrasekhara Bharati of Sringeri worshipped Sriyantra
daily. All these great scholars were advaitins and their bhakti towards their
iShTa dEvata was never an obstruction for them in pursuance of jnAna mArga and
they never considered bhakti as a inferiour to jnAna. 

Shri Abhinava Vidya Tirtha Swamigal once mentioned about the the characteristics of
pseudo-vedantin and urged His devotees to keep away from such people. 

The highest pinnacle of bhakti is atma-nivedana where the bhakta & devata merge into one.

Sriram
