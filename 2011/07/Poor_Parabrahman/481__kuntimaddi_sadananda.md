PraNAms

All said and done, Dattatreya says in Avadhuta Gita in the very first sloka - Iswaraanugraat eva pumsam advaita vaasana. It is blessing to have the inclination to have the desire to know the absolute oneness that pervades the universe of multitudes. After a point, it becomes useless to engage in discussions with dvaitins what Shankara calls asshuShka tarka. 

Hari Om!
Sadananda
