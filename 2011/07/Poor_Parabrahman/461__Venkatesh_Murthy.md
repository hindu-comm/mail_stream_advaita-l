Namaste

Sriman Narayana is Ananta Kalyana Guna Mahodadhi. He has countless
Kalyana Gunas only but not Heya Gunas. If you say He has Vrana it is
not correct because Vrana is not Kalyana Guna. He cannot be Sthula
because it is not Kalyana Guna. He cannot be fat. We have to take both
Nirguna Sruti and Saguna Sruti If Nirguna Sruti says Apanipadam
Achakshu but Saguna Sruti says Sahsra Shirsha Purusha Sahasrakshaha
Sahasrapat. You cannot make Saguna Sruti false.
