The reality, however, is that Dvaita Mutts, through their top-ranking
scholars, have been engaging with Advaita scholars, consistently. Advaita is
their only, greatest, adversary. Their continuous endeavour is to get an
even better understanding of Advaita.  The reason behind this is obviously
that their attacks/refutations of Advaita right from their mUlAcharya's
times, have not had the desired effect and therefore not paid off.  Advaita
continues to be the most popular Vedic philosophical system sought by an
ever-growing following. Advaitins, at the highest scholarly levels, have
shown them in no uncertain terms that their objections are founded on an
incorrect /inadequate understanding of Advaita.  It is this kind of
responses one sees in the regularly held Dvaita-Advaita meets.  A keenly
attentive audience consisting of young and old Dvaita scholars in such meets
is testimony to the fact that Advaita needs to be understood better.  And it
is the Dvaita institutions, by and large, that organize such meets.
