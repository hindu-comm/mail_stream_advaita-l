Dears
Not only dvaitha but also Visishtadvaitha places Bhakthi as the winner of mumukshathvam especially in this age of Kali.
Bhakthi does not require elaborate preparations but just sathsangham.Bhakthi simply accepts the Ithihasa Purana sayings without questioning.In the Bhagavatham Gopikas bhakthi towards Lord Krishna is elaborately dealt with.
According to one school of thought bhakthi gives kramama mukthi whereas Jnanam gives jivan mukthi -that is a jnani gets liberated while alive in this world itself says a commentary on Sri Appayya Dhikshithar`s Marga Bandhu sthotram.In essence both Bakthi and Jnana lead to liberation while jnana quickens the process.In Abhangas on Vittal the devotees even say they donot want moksha but seek rebirths in Pandharpur just to spend their lives praising Him and enjoying His beatiful form.That is Bhakthi.R.Krishnamoorthy.
