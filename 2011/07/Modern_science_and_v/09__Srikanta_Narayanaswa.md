One of our list members Mrs. Savitri Devaraj has translated the bigraphy of Swami Sacchidanandendra and it shows that despite all the emphasis he placed on Jnana, he did not stint on Bhakti in any way.

As I have said,HHSri Sri Sri sachidanandendra Saraswathiji,through his lucid translations of the Shankara Bhashyas into Kannada has rendered a yeoman service for the Mumukshus.
Though he gave importance to Bhakthi,his translations must be studied carefully by any one who wants to have a clear picture of Adwaita vedanta as well as the swamiji.
