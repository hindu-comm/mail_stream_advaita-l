___________________________________________________________________________________------
Since the term "iva"is appended to 'dehavan"it follows that the Lord is endowed with the Dicine body after ataining "Jivamukts state".he continues to do his duty,as the Upanishads say"Atmavan Kriyavan",this does not mean he continues to do his karma like before like an ajnani.Shankara also clarifies this with the appenage"Iva" so it looks.
N.Srikanta.
