Likewise, gauDapAda uses bauddha terminology and concepts to address his
contemporary bauddha-s, so that he may meaningfully communicate the essence
of vedAnta to them and/or to people influenced by bauddha concepts. It does
not mean, as many academics contend, that he was a bauddha in disguise.

Of course, those who don't look at advaita-vedAnta purely as a
mokSha-shAstra (academicians etc) will have a tough time accepting this. For
them, these AchArya-s were just philosophers articulating a certain school
of thought, however profound it might be. Indeed, they might even interpret
the saMpradAya's view in a negative sense, as a suggestion that the
AchArya-s were using dishonest methods or plagiarising other systems.
Needless to say, the gulf in perspective is huge.

It is clear that the the writer of the above Email has not understood the "Moksha-Sastra",which he has brought Academic Research to show that Gaudapada has brought Bauddha concepts to prove the Vdantic point of view.This is clearly absurd.Why shoudl gaudapada bring Bauddha concepts to prove Vedanta?Can we say that Gaudapada is Nonsampradayic(NS) for short,which is a an absurd hypothesis.
