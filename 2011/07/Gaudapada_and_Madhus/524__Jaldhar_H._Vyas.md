It's an open and shut case.  Gaudapadacharya uses terminology and 
imagery no other Advaitin uses (including the term buddha!) but which is 
very common in Madhyamaka Buddhist works.  Why did he do this?  Perhaps as 
was suggested his principle opposition was from Buddhists and he wanted to 
write in the language they would understand.  I don't think one needs to 
worry that it is a sign of being non-sampradayic.  The origin may be 
Buddhist but the use it is put to is thoroughly Vedantic.  Nowadays people 
use imagery from, say, quantum physics to illustrate Vedantic concepts. 
But they are still Advaitins not scientists right?
