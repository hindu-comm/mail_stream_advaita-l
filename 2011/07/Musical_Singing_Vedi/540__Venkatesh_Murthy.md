Namaste

Some people are singing Vedic mantras in music like Gayatri Mantra.
But this is not correct. Because-

गीती शीघ्री शिरःकम्पी तथा लिखितपाठकः ।
अनर्थज्ञोऽल्पकण्ठश्च षडेते पाठकाधमाः ॥

those who sing Mantras in music those who chant Mantras very fast
those who shake their head during chant those who read Mantras from a
book those who chant not knowing meaning and those without strength in
the voice are Adhamas in Pathakas and they will not get full benefit
of mantras. With proper Svaras Mantras will be more pleasing to hear
than musical singing.
