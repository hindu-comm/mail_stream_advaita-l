Sir

The chandas of the Sloka is anushThup, which has many versions with minor deviations also being common. Technically itmust haveeight letters in evey paada. If you replace viSeshatah withviSeshah, you will have only 7 letters in the second foot. So it is a fault. 

You are right in that taa is better than tah; but then tasil pratyaya (which when added to viSesha gives viSeshatah) gives ries to a wide variety of meanings; if you want you can still the required meaning into it. Then, there is one more issue: chintaa should be written, as per SishTaachaara,with the dental anunaasikaa 'na' and not the anusvaara or bindu, 'm'. 

Regards
N. Siva Senani

>*चिंतायास्तु चितायास्तु बिन्दुमात्रं विशेषतः||
>सजीवं दहते चिंता निर्जीवं दहते चिता ||
>
>The word 'विशेषतः' is not the same as 'विशेषः’ which alone would mean

>However, in the following verse, also giving the same meaning as the earlier

>
>*चिता चिन्ता समा प्रोक्ता* बिन्दुमात्रं विशेषता |
>सजीवं दहते चिन्ता निर्जीवं दहते चिता ||
>
>Here the word is quite alright.

>Will member/s kindly explain? Will there be a 'chandobhanga' if the word
