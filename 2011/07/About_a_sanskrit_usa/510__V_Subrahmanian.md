*Namaste.

I have a question about this verse:
*चिंतायास्तु चितायास्तु बिन्दुमात्रं विशेषतः||
सजीवं दहते चिंता निर्जीवं दहते चिता ||

The word 'विशेषतः' is not the same as 'विशेषः’ which alone would mean
'difference/bheda'.  The former is used in the sense of 'especially'. I
think it is an avyayaH.

However, in the following verse, also giving the same meaning as the earlier
quoted verse, we have the word 'visheShatA':

*चिता चिन्ता समा प्रोक्ता* बिन्दुमात्रं विशेषता |
सजीवं दहते चिन्ता निर्जीवं दहते चिता ||

Here the word is quite alright.

Will member/s kindly explain? Will there be a 'chandobhanga' if the word
'visheShaH' is used in the first verse?

Regards,
