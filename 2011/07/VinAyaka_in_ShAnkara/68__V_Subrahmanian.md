This is certainly a possible non-contradictory interpretation. I have also
checked with an appropriate authority about the grammatical validity of the
interpretation:  विनायकvishiShTaमातृगण....

This is true.

What you say is definitely correct but what I meant to show was, based on
the 17.4 verse of the Gita,  that the tAmasic type people choose to
propitiate a different set of deities/beings which are clearly not the
choice of the saattvic and raajasic type of people.
