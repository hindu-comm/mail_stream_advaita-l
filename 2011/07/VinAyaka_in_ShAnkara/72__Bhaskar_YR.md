prabhuji, IMHO, this maNtra is there to show us the sarvavyApakatva of 
parabrahman instead of proving the point that the gaNapati as a 
personified deva is parabrahman.  Because in that gaNeshArthavasheershaM 
itself it is said that tvam dehatrayAteetaH, tvam guNa trayAteetaH, tvaM 
kAla trayAteetaH, tvaM avasthAtrayAteetaH, 'sarvOtOmAm pAhi pAhi 
samantAt..tvam brahAtvam, vishNutvaM, rudrastvaM,indrastvaM, agnistvaM, 
vAyustvaM etc.  So, instead of looking at this maNtra as the daNapati 
devata mAntra, i would like to look at it as a sarvavyApakatva maNtra on 
parabrahmaN.  As you know, same lines of maNtra-s you can find in 
atharvaNi suryOpanishat as well. So, IMHO, in the name of sUrya, gaNapti 
etc. shruti here telling us about sarvavyApakatva of parabrahman.  Kindly 
correct me, if I said anything wrong here prabhuji.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
