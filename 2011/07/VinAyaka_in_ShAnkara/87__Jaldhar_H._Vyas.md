I think I did mention this before.  The sattvika Ganesha who is identified 
as parabrahman in the atharvashirsha is called Vinayaka because he is the 
master and controller of the Vinayakas.  Just as Rudra is the leader of 
the Rudras (who are often described as malicious or fearsome) and Aditya 
is the leader of the Adityas.  So parents can rest assured they are not 
naming their babies after demons if they name them Vinayaka.
