This somewhat corresponds to my sense as well, i.e. that sha~NkarAchArya
took a negative view of a particular upAsana involving all these deities.
Satish showed quite clearly that the mention of the three [vinAyaka(s),
saptamAtR^ikA-s and chaturbhagini-s] together is not accidental but in the
context of a particular system.

Therefore, there is a stronger case that he took a dim view of the system
rather than individual deities. If the latter had been the case, he might as
well have picked a few deities randomly rather than 3 who were connected by
a particular upAsana system.
