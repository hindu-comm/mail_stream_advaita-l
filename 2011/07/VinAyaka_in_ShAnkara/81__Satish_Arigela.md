Yes that assumption can be made, but as you point out it creates more problems 
which traditionalists are not comfortable addressing.

But see my other thread: AchArya explicitly implies that those with sAttvika 
mind will never worship the sapta mAtR^ika-s!! So the question like many think 
is not whether devata-s should be worshipped in sAttvika or tAmasik way.. The 
actual issue is he considers some popular devata-s as completely tAmasik fit for 
worship only by tAmasik people. Please see other thread.
