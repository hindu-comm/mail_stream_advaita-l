Yes. I did not say anything different on this one.

OK, shall we reconcile this problem  with a grand imagination from my 
side:-)) At the time of shankara's geeta bhAshya, people were worshipping 
vinAyaka (like veera gaNapati, ucchishta gaNapati etc.) & saptamAtruka-s 
in ugra rUpa &  in a tAmasik way, though these deities have soumya rUpa 
then.  Hence he particularly mentioned these names in his bhAshya...But 
over a period of time people started worshipping these deities in a soumya 
rUpa and in a more sAtvik way & stopped ( or decreased) the pUja in a 
tAmasik way,  Accordingly, these deities have become more popular in their 
soumya rUpa & receiving pUja nowadays in a more sAtvik way.  But this 
assumption would straight away puts all works on gaNesha, bhavAni, durga 
(including most popular work soudaryalahari) in a doubt whether these 
works are from the pen of bhAshyakAra. 

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
