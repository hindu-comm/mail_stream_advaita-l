I was surprised to come across two names in recent times:

1. a certain Dr.  Ravaneswaran - This name appears to be not very uncommon
2. ChaturAnan Mishra - Among the trimurtis, Shiva and Vishnu are very common
as names.  I have not come across, at least in the south, anyone naming a
child after Brahmaa,  although names like PrajApati are there perhaps as
surnames/family names.
