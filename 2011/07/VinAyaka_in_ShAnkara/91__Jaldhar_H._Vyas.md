No sorry I didn't mean to imply that there was.  I am just saying that 
Brahman manifests as Ganapati.  As Vighneshvara he has the power over the 
obstacle-causing Vinayakas thus he bears the name in the same way as a 
King could be addreased by the name of his people or kingdom.

Interestingly I was just reading today about the clans or tribes of 
Scotland where a similar custom occurs.  The chiefs of clans like MacLeod, 
MacDonald etc. would be known as the MacLeod, the MacDonald and so on. 
Sanskrit grammar doesn't have definite articles but the principle is the 
same.
