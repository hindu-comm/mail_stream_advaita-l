It makes perfect sense to accept worship of all deities in visuddha
sattva mode as pointed out by Anand Hudli. He has offered defence of
the position from a traditional perspective. I'd like to offer defence
of the same position from another perspective.

First of all, if you don't worship Vinayaka, who is pleasing, you will
miss out on modhaka :) if you are looking for reasons that appeal at
higher levels, please read on. Let us assume that BG has 700 verses
and was not constructed from multiple sources as some schiolars of
questionable intellect claim. In Ch. 10, the Lord says I am Skanda. It
will be strange to say that it is okay to worship Skanda but not
Vinayaka form.  In many places, sastras recommend us to see every form
as a form of Vishnu or Brahman. It will be strange to exclude some
forms such as Vinayaka which sastras themselves specifically say is
worshippable.  One of the names in Vishnu Sahasranama is ganeshwara.
It is mandated in bhagavatham and temple traditions both saiva and
vaishnava. In the famous suklambharadharam verse, Vigneshwara is
called Vishnu. It is not only smrti but sruti also recommends worship
of Vinayaka.

And in spite of all these  you don't worship Vinayaka, you will lose
elections in Maharashtra!

The only valid argument to not worship Vinayaka is Siva as Sankara
renounced his worshippable "family" :)
