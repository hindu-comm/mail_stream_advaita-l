Well ... what would you say when sruti talks about the deity called 
Vishnu?

praNAms Sri Rajaram prabhuji
Hare Krishna

IMO, the treatment should be same...instead of going after nAma rUpa of 
vividha devata-s, (be it shiva, vishNu, devi, sUrya, gaNapati etc., ) & 
scratching our head for their hierarchical order,  being an advaitin, it 
would be better for us to grasp the inherent meaning of the  tattva behind 
nAma rUpAtmaka devata maNtra-s.  Don't you agree with me prabhuji??

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
