Even in the rudra bhAshya, you will find one such instance for the mantra
"vyuptakEshAya cha".  Though the vyuptakEsha indicate one with shaven 
head,

praNAms 
Hare Krishna

Just on the lighter note, vyuptakesha head may not be the head of 
parashiva/gangAdhara here...Otherwise, where ganga mAta should  find her 
place if the head of shiva is neatly shaven :-))  the most suited name is 
'jatAjUta gAngOtarangai vishisyam'...BTW, sofar I've not seen shiva 
bhagavan  picture / painting with the bald head:-))

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
