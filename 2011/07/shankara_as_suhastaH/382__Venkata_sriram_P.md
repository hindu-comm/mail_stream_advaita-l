Dear Sarma Garu,

//////

But Sankara's birth is later to vedas therefore we
cannot expect a reference to him in the vedas either covertly or overtly.
Such things are like Bacon's signatures in Shakespeare's dramas.

Yes. I agree with you. Though these are extrapolations, but indicate
their devotion towards their acharya.

Even in the rudra bhAshya, you will find one such instance for the mantra
"vyuptakEshAya cha". Though the vyuptakEsha indicate one with shaven head,
Abhinava Sankara interprets this as a pointer towards Sankara Bhagavatpada.

regs,
sriram
