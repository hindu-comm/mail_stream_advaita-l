Well ... Lord Krishna says in 9.13 that bhajana is for the noble ones.
"Others" meditate on one brahman etc. There is no question about
supremacy of bhakti over karma and homologousness of bhakti and jnana.
The question is if bhakti marga is superior to jnana marga. That seems
to be the opinion of Lord Krishna. If anyone disagrees without a basis
- tough luck.
