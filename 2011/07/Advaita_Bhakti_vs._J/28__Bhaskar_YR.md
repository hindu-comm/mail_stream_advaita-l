Hare Krishna

Well ... Lord Krishna says in 9.13 that bhajana is for the noble ones. 
"Others" meditate on one brahman etc. 

>  But he does not say sAdhaka-s who pursue jnAna mArga are inferior to 
bhakta-s who do bhajans neither he said jnAna  & bhakti mArga are mutually 
exclusive to put them in different compartments. 

There is no question about supremacy of bhakti over karma and 
homologousness of bhakti and jnana.
The question is if bhakti marga is superior to jnana marga. 

>  this question does not arise anywhere in shruti & smruti & bhAshya 
since bhakti without JNANA is NOT a separate mArga for the mOksha. 

That seems to be the opinion of Lord Krishna. If anyone disagrees without 
a basis
- tough luck.

>  our disagreement here is only with regard to 'ranking' of bhakti over 
jnAna and not about the importance of 'bhakti' in sAdhana mArga.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
