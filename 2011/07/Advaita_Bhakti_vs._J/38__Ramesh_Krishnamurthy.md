By the way, even this question stems from a problematic framework.

Incidentally, advaita-vedAnta admits only 2 mArga-s, pravR^itti mArga and
nivR^itti mArga, sometimes referred to as karma mArga and j~nAna mArga
respectively. There is no such thing as a separate bhakti mArga.

Even these 2 mArga-s are not entirely separate - the pravR^itti mArga
eventually leads to the nivR^itti mArga.
