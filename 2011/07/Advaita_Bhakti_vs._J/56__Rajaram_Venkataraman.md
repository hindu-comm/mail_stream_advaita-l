This is a good analysis. I think Sankara is referring only to the highest
devotee referred to by you. The reason I say that is that Sankara does not
differentiate between mahatmanah in verse 9.13-14 and the other types
devotees in verse 9.15 though the latter verse starts with "anye". At the
end of 9.14, he provides a connective to 9.15 "The various ways in which
they adore are being stated". Then he explains how the different types of
devotees are actually worshipping the Isvara (immutable) referred to in 9.13
by providing the following connective to 9.16 " 'If they worship in numerous
ways, how is it that they worship You alone?' Hence the Lord says: " aham
kratu aham yajna ..."

It is kirtayanta (glorify) and namasyanta (offer obeisances) in 9.14 that
mahatmanah does. Sankara does not interpret differently.

OK?
