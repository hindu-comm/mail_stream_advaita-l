Yeah, I disagree. If Sri Krishna REALLY meant that doing bhajana is superior
to shravana-manana-nidhidhyasana, then tough luck to Sri Krishna :-)


On a serious note, if Rajaram is serious about Advaita-Vedanta, he should at
least study under a proper teacher for a few years and get his basics right.
All these doubts will clear away like mist. Madhusudana-sarasvati and the
role of bhakti are hardly the right place to start.
