RV: I know you stressed on REALLY to indicate the opposite. But I took the
positive meaning because you cannot take positive counterpart (abhava
pratiyogin) for a positive entity because of identity.

RV: Let me see if you understand what is Avidya with a basic question. As
ajnana is always with respect to an object, jnana of the object of ajnana is
a pre-requisite for ajnana. So, how can ajnana arise at all in the face of
jnana with respect to the same object? If ajnana does not exist, then there
is no question of jnana arising with respect to that object. Pl. let me know
the advaitin response to it.

If you are influenced by Gaudiya-s then you have a lot of unlearning to do,
not merely in matters of philosophy but *even in terms of how to look at
shaastra-s*. In fact, the only reason why I even made that suggestion is
because you had mentioned earlier that you were influenced by the Gaudiya-s.


My perception was that in spite of the Gaudiya influence you wanted to learn
Advaita Vedanta. The choice is of course yours. Once again, no offence
meant.
RV: I am aware of the differences in epistemelogy between the two schools of
thought to some extent. But I disagree with your premise that you have to
unlearn. One can know why two but all schools of thought by the grace of
Isvara. (rachayakila darshana tattva vidham bhava sankara desika me saranam)
