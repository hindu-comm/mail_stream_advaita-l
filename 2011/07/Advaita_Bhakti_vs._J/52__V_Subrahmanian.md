Actually even Bhakti, if it is a means to final beatitude, can deliver it
only by generating in the bhakta's mind the 'bhagavat tattva jnanam'.  And
that will encompass everything in creation, including the jiva's tattva.
 So, ultimately the jiva-bhakta will end up realizing that his true nature
is not the pancha koshas but the spirit beyond it which is not different
from Bhagavan's true nature.  If it is anything different then Bhagavan's
anantatva will be in peril.  As someone said: If Bhagavan is not the 'whole'
there will be so many 'holes' where there are so many jivas.  The Upanishad
presents Brahman as 'prajnAnaghana', 'vijnanaghana' with the analogy of
'saindhavaghana' (a rocky lump of salt) where everything, the whole of it is
nothing but itself, salt.
