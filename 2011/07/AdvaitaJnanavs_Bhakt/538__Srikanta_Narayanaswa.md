>From all of these premises, as far as I see, Ishvara is not just an object
to be meditated upon for Chitta Suddhi and to be discarded later - like a

With reference to the above,shankara has made it clear what is Chittashuddhi and what is Ishwara.The Chittashuddhi has to be got by exhausting one's karmas.The Ishwara is Brahman with Upadhi.When the mind becomes clear chittashuddhi dvara one attains Brahman through the purport of the Mahavakyas.
