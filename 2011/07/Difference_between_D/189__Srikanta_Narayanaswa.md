Namaskaram,

I was having a conversation about Dhyanam and then I realized that "Dhyanam"
and "Nishtai" are commonly used in Tamil. I would like someone to clarify
the difference between the two.
_____________________________________________________________________________
Dhyana is a mode of meditating with one pointed mind on a "Ishta devata"or concentrating on a 'mantram".The Mantram can be spelled with sound syllables or it can be manasika mantram.In Dhyana one can be aware of his surroundings.
But, in Nishtai,one becomes totally absorbed in his mind without awaring of his external surroundings.There is no "vikara'of his mind.The higher state of 'Nishtai"can lead to "savikalpa"Nishtai,much higher than this is the 'Nirvikalpa"Nishtai,which only Yogis can attain.
Regards,
N.Srikanta.
