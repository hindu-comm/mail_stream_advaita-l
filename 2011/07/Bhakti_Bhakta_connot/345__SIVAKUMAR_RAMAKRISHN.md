SAdara praNAmam,
Recently happened to go through Saunndaryalahari
lecturers by Sri Chandrasekharendra Saraswathi Swamikal.
An unusally illuminating lecture on JnAni and bhakthi can
be seen in the intoductory part.
English version is from Bharathiya Vidyabhavan,Bombay,
and tamil version is from Vanathipathippakam,Chennai.
Namaste.
