I request the scholars here to point to list of books and articles to
understand the position of bhakti in advaita.The following are the criteria
for it to be useful:


   1. It should be a work done by an acharya in the tradition
   2. The author should be in alignment with Sankara's teaching
   3. If there are any differences, then that should be within the framework
   of Sankara's teachings
   4. The work should be authentically attributable to the author

If it is a work by any other scholar, it should refer to the works of
acharyas in the tradition with explicit quotations. There are many who
paraphrase their understanding without references to the original author'ss
works and sometimes lifting quotes out of context.
