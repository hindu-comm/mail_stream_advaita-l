Namaste,

The english translation is available here online, however, some of the important tantric concepts have been skipped.

The audio CDs are available here:

http://www.ambaa.org/audio/lalita1000/index.html

The audio recordings are by Brahmasri R.Krishnamurty Sastrigal who is the great stallart in Advaita and Srividya. 

I keep telling to my friends that there are 3 stallwarts in Advaita (Shri Mani Dravid Ji, R.Krishnamurty Sastrigal & Shri Goda Venkateshwara Sastrigal) and among them 2 are
also authorities in Srividya (Krishnamurty Sastrigal & Goda Sastrigal). And both are 
available in Chennai. 

Among them, Shri Godaji is a pUrNabhiShiktha under the lineage of Guhananda Mandali and also the Srividya Diksha Guru of the son of temple priest (bAlAnandanAtha - brother of kAmakOti mama) in Kamakshi Temple of Kanchipuram. 

Request your friend to contact Dr. Godaji for any issues on Srividya because he is 
the authority in that field.

regs,
sriram
