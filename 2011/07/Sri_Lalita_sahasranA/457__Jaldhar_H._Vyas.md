You've already had some good answers but I just wanted to add that an 
edition of this work editted by Shri Batukanath Shastri Khiste was 
published by the Sampurnananda Sanskrit University, Kashi in 1994.  It 
contains the sahasranama, the saubhagyabhaskara commentory by Shri 
Bhaskara Raya, and the bala tapa tika of Shambhunath all in Sanskrit only.
