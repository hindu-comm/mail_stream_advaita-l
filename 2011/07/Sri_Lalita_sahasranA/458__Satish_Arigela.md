{{{>From: Jaldhar H. Vyas jaldhar at braincells.com

You've already had some good answers but I just wanted to add that an edition of 
this work editted by Shri Batukanath Shastri Khiste was published by the 
Sampurnananda Sanskrit University, Kashi in 1994. It contains the sahasranama, 
the saubhagyabhaskara commentory by Shri Bhaskara Raya, and the bala tapa tika 
of Shambhunath all in Sanskrit only.}}}


Above is a good suggestion and I greatly recommend this book.I have a copy of 
the sameand it is excellent.
