*sadaachaaram* is '*karma*' that would lead to *jnaana* if practiced with
trikaraNa Sudhdhi. For a real *karmayOgi*, *sadaachaaram* is as soulful an
act as anything else. The '*karma*-s' or rather 'practices of life'
(including *sadaachaaram* and sometimes apparent *duraachaaram*-s) may stick
on to such *karmayOgi* (and not the *karmayOgi* sticking to them) due to *
vaasana*-s of the *upaadhi* (body-mind-intellect.)

We see strange habits and strange outlook over mundane matters, in some of
the realized souls. Our interest should be solely in receiving their
preaching of *advaita-vEdaantam*.
