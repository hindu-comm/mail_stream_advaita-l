Jnana means the full understanding of the subject matter.Ajnana is just opposite meaning there is no understanding at all.Partial understanding is no understanding as it may prove detrimental while applying in a real situation.One may recall Abhimanyu`s sad death because of partial understanding of the Chakra vyuha/Padma Vyuha formation.
Knowledge is different from jnanam.Knowledge plus how to apply it in a practical situation independently may be taken as jnanam.
One may know that a subject named vyakarana exists but may not have the full understanding of what exactly it is.
These are my views on Jnana and Ajnana.R.Krishnamoorthy.
