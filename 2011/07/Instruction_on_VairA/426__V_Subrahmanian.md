Namaste.

In the series of articles on the Kathopanishat being published in the
Advaita Academy site, an account of a real-life instruction on vairagyam is
included in some detail as  its several aspects are brought out (an excerpt
from the book *Yoga Enlightenment and Perfection* detailing the spiritual *
sAdhana* and its culmination in the life of Jagadguru Sri Abhinava
Vidyatirtha MahaswaminaH, Sringeri Sharada Peetham.)  The stated portion is
covered in both these URLs:
