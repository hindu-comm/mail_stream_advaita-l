In the lighter vein,
Is it Sankara TV or Sankata TV?
They don't propogate advaita at all. Only the name is Sankara nothing
connected with Shankaracharya. Even the name is mis-spelt. It should have
been Shankara not Sankara( meaning spreading of diseases or mix up like '
sankaro naraka eva' as in Gita).

They propogate bhavishya,Nudi  (Zodaic ), dubious advertisements,
 Miscellaneous programs of general interest and not serious subjects like
Vedanta or advaita vedanta.

Just for information of all members of the group
