Here is one reference though not from Parasara smriti.

This instruction is given in the
Brahma-vaivarta Purana (Krsna-janma-khanda 185.180)

ashvamedham gavaalambham sannyaasam pala-paitrikam
devarena sutotpattim kalau panca vivarjayet

"'In this Age of Kali, five acts are forbidden: the offering of a horse in
sacrifice, the offering of a cow in sacrifice, the acceptance of the order
of sannyaasa, the offering of oblations of flesh to the forefathers, and a
man's begetting children in his brother's wife.'

regards,
Sarma.
