This view has no basis. Animal sacrifice is clearly mentioned including with 
which mantra-s are to be used when offering certain parts of the sacrificed 
animal. Please do not ask me to quote anything on this.. because the references 
are crystal clear and there are many.. that they can be "googled out" easily.

However like Ramesh said, it is doubtful if vegetarianism came entirely from 
bauddha-s and jaina-s.
In some early Ayurvedic texts like the bhelA saMhita, it is clearly mentioned 
that during mantra sAdhana one abstains from eating meat and other enjoyments. 
So it was there in the Hindu system and at some point it came common practice.
