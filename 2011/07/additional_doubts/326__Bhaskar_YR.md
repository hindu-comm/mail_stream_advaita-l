*Madhusudana's view is that there is no need for a teacher if he is a 
bhakta
and atma jnana will manifest!

Can we say this is another clear cut deviation from shankara siddhAnta by 
Sri MadhusUdana??  shAstrajnOpi svAtantreNa brahmajnAnAnveshaNam na kuryAt 
ityetat *gurumeva* ityavadhAraNa phalaM, shankara says clearly in mUndaka 
bhAshya.  tadvijnAnArthaM sa gurumevAbhigacchet...is just like an 
injunction by shankara here...If what madhusUdana says is something 
different from this then we have to either say he has deviated from 
saMpradAya bodhana or said it in a different context & his intention is 
not exactly go against shankarOpadesha.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
