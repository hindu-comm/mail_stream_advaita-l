After reading bhakti's role in advaita vedAnta, I am getting some 
additional doubts with regard to 'required tools' or qualifications  to 
obtain paramArtha jnAna.

(a) is advaita paramArtha  jnAna happens only to Astika-s (theists) who 
have firm belief in god & scriptures?? 

(b) how can a non-hindu or atheist (nAstika) or any 'outsider', who does 
not want to believe in god & scriptures, but would like to get this jnAna 
(without the aid of shAstra & bhagavanta or outside the traditional 
circle) ??  dont we have any jnAni-s outside hindu Astika saMpradAya ?? 

(c) prior to jnAna, is it mandatory requirement for the advaita sAdhaka to 
believe in god's existence & to have unconditional faith in sacred hindu 
scriptures or whether he has to  be a hard core theist ?? 

(d) if the (c) is an indispensable requirement for the jnAna  then advaita 
jnAna realization would be restricted ONLY to the sAdhaka-s in hindu 
religion in general and theists in particular.  In that case advaita jnAna 
has the limited boundaries in hindu god & scriptures. 

(e) if the (c) is not a necessary requirement then we cannot say 
shravaNAdi sAdhana are the only  direct means for realization..And further 
this would prompt us to say, anybody, at any point of time through any 
means can get this realization..this stand  goes against the convictions 
held by sampradAyavit-s. 

(f) finally, can a person be a non-dual jnAni but still a nAstika??

Any clarification from the prabhuji-s would be appreciated.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
