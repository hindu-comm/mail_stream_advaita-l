The sanskrit word Astika maps poorly to the English word theist.  An 
astika is one who says asti ("it is so") to these three propositions.

1.  The Vedas are pramana for knowing dharma and moksha.
2.  There is an atma that survives after death
3.  There is prime cause for the material world (Vedanta calls it Brahman.)

Those who say "it is not so" (na + asti = nAsti) to one or more of 
these propositions are nAstikas.

They can't.  If it is merely a matter of ignorance as to the details this 
can be rectified easy enough but if they don't accept the very principles 
Vedanta is based on, how can get jnana which is the result?

Advaita Vedantas concept of Brahman is not quite the same as the 
theist -- eastern or western -- idea of God but it is nearer to that than 
to atheism.

Not that being astika is necessary but not sufficient.  Samkhya for 
instance meets the three criteria but still gets criticised by 
Shankaracharya.

Hope the above explains the situation.

No by definition one who doesn't accept Advaitic principle cannot 
be considered a "knower" can they?  But Buddhists for instance or Kashmiri 
Shaivas are non-dualistic.  Perhaps there are such traditions elsewhere in 
the world too?  If so, Advaitic beliefs would supplement them not replace 
them altogether.
