praNAms 
Hare Krishna

Thanks a lot for all the clarification provided by prabhuji-s.  I think 
there is a difference of opinion among advaitins (in this list) with 
regard to this issue also :-)) Anyway, Sri satish prabhuji fired me for 
using the word 'god' wrongly in my mail, for him just a couple of 
clarification.

Can you please avoid the God word? The word is both misleading and 
annoying at 
times. I recommend using the words brahman or Ishvara, or something 
similar.

>  yes, that something similar word is what 'god', which my Kannada medium 
mind opted to use..If you have translated terms for Ishwara or brahman 
other than 'god' in English please feel free to replace it :-))

nAstika - Those who dont accept the veda-s.

> yes, I used the nAstika in that sense only..I repeat my question 
onceagain with this clarification.  Can a paramArtha jnAni (or non-dual 
absolute knowledge) be a nAstika (totally unaware & uninterested in veda 
shAstra and existence of brahman/Ishwara??)..Even this is possible, I dont 
think there is any accommodation available for this type of jnAni-s in 
traditional abode.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
