> yes, I used the nAstika in that sense only..I repeat my question 
onceagain with this clarification. Can a paramArtha jnAni (or non-dual 
absolute knowledge) be a nAstika (totally unaware & uninterested in veda 
shAstra and existence of brahman/Ishwara??)..Even this is possible, I dont 
think there is any accommodation available for this type of jnAni-s in 
traditional abode.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar

Namaste
I think once a sadhaka is a paramartha gyani, the question of Astika or nAstika does not arise. It is only prior to paramartha gyan i.e in vyavaharicthat these questions arise.
As far as other philosophies are concerned, they may not be in line with advaita traditions.

Sudhakar
