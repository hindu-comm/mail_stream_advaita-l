*The notion of apotheosis is very much present in other tradition. Ancient
African religions have semblance of Advaita Vedanta. It is also present in
Abrahamic cults : "I and Father are one". But none of them get it as
thoroughly as Sankara does in terms brevity, depth and coverage. *

*The best Physics texts may be written by Roger Penrose but Physics is not
an exclusive English work. Oxford provides the enviroment to nurture such
genuiuses. *
(e) if the (c) is not a necessary requirement then we cannot say
shravaNAdi sAdhana are the only  direct means for realization..And further
this would prompt us to say, anybody, at any point of time through any
means can get this realization..this stand  goes against the convictions
held by sampradAyavit-s.
*Madhusudana's view is that there is no need for a teacher if he is a bhakta
and atma jnana will manifest! This view is held in other sampradayas also.
But Madhusudana did take sannyasa initiation and practise bhakti (jnanam)*
(f) finally, can a person be a non-dual jnAni but still a nAstika??
*How can I believe or not believe in my existence? *

Any clarification from the prabhuji-s would be appreciated.

*Oops! I did not know you were looking for clarification from prabhujis -
pl. ignore the above :)*

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
