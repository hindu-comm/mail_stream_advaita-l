Clearly, he says Time was not there. However, I have seen another argument
that the mantra is denying time divisions, such as month, season, year,
etc., or seconds, minutes, hours, etc. But it does not deny Time, which 
can
be considered without any limitations, divisions. Considered thus, it
becomes the same as the Unlimited Brahman.

Yes, this kAla without any time division is called brahman, krishna too 
acknowledges this in geeta kAlaH kalayatAmahaM.  But there is no lack of 
references in upanishads with regard to prAtaH, madhyAnha, saNdhya, rAtri 
kAlam and R^tu (season) as well. 

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
