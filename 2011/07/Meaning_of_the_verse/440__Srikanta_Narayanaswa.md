Namaste.
Could anyone explain the meaning of this verse and also the source, if any?

अगाधजलसंचारी न गर्वं याति रोहितः ।
अण्गुष्ठोदकमात्रेण शफरी फर्फरायते ॥

rohitaH and shapharI refer to (types of) fish.

Regards,

In an ocean which is a large sheet of water,a shark(Rohitah) though it traverses in it,it doesnot feel or beget
pride(garva),but,a small fish(shaphari) is proud and creates sound even though it moves in water which is toe-deep(angustamatrena).That means great persons donot make sound,but they move with dignity,where as snall people will create lot of sound.This a subhasita from Chanakya.
N.Srikanta.
