Dear Ramakrishnan,

All the three books ie., Vana Durga Kalpa, Arya Dvisathi, Devi (Sakti) Mahimnah Stotra
are published in Telugu by Balasaraswati Publishers. If you know telugu, you 
can purchase them. 

If you are a tamilian, i was told that Mahaperiyaval Trust under the supervision of
Shri Radhakrishna Sastrigal has published the above ie., Arya Dvisathi & Mahimnah
Stotram (not sure of Vana Durga Kalpa). 

You can try in Indological Stores, Chennai & Vedanta Book House, Bangalore.

regs,
sriram
