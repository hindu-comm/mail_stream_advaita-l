There are VCD of the lectures by Prof. J.N. Jha available at Chinmaya International foundation which I found excellent in understanding Navya Nyaaya.One can order them on line. I was glued to the lectures - there are 20 VCDs running one and half hours each. 
Pertinent to Vedanta, I have referred to some aspects of this in:

I agree with the assessment of Shree Siva Senani. 

Hari Om!
