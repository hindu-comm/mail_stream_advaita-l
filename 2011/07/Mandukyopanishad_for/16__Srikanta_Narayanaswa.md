The munDakas were followers of the atharvaveda who underwent a special discipline as part of the study of their shakha called shirovrata. The upanishad itself explains it thus.

On july 1,Jaldhar Vyas wrote the above Email.I have mentioned this with reference to an Email regarding Mundaka Upanishad by a list member.I have heard it from experts in the sastras that "Mandukyopanishad'was meant for sanyasis.The teachers he has mentioned to Kanchi Swamiji,sringeri Swamiji were grahasthas.Correct.But,for a sanyasi it requires specific qualification.Being an academic teacher is some thing and being a practicing sanyasiis some thing else.To practice what is said in the Mandukyopanishad,particularly the Adwaita prakarana,Alata Shanti prakarana of Gaudapada karikas,it is clearly mentioned that it is for a practicing sanyasi.any scholar can have academic interest.Anyhow, I treat this discussion as already discussed and refrain from commenting on this
