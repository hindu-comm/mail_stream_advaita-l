Namaste Jaladharji,

/////

Traditionally, in-depth studies of the upanishads were only undertaken by 
those who had formally renounced

//

Infact, if you observe, upanishad vidyas are the dialogues between teacher & pupil
who propagated rishi paramparawho were grihasthas (vAnaprasthAs). 

//
How can someone who is immersed in the world honestly practice an ideology that states that world is false and should be shunned?

//

Even if the world is shunned by yatis, the vyavahArika satya haunts him. There is no escape. It is the viveka & vairagya that matters most. Sanyasa is prescribed because
there won't be any family commitments so that sravana, manana would continue
without any interruption. 

BTW, there is no dasa-nami sampradaya prior to sankara and there were informal yatis who were called bhikshus. 

///

Would any of them urge a mumukshu not to take sannyasa? Do they/did they 
take sannyasa themselves in due course?

//

None took sanyasa except Shri Virupaksha Sastrigal who ascended Kudali Mutt and 
assumed the name Valukeshwaranda Bharati.
