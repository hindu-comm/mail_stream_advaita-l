praNAms Sri Ram prabhuji
Hare Krishna

Don't know how the Sankara explained.  

> shankara takes janaka's example in geeta bhAshya to explain how can a 
jnAni, even after Atma jnAna can engage himself in doing mundane 
vyAvahArik activities without becoming a sarva karma saNyAsi. 

(Hope, I dont see the above explanation would lead us to unsolved puzzle 
of jnAni's sashareeratvaM & his post jnAna activities with 'his' 
dehendriyamanObuddhi ahaMkAra :-))

Dikshitar says that Janaka might have taken sanyAsa in his previous janma 
and hence the "vastu prApti" is in grihasthAshrama.  It is apUrvata phala 
siddhi. 

>  shankara in sUtra bhAshya very clearly says there is no prAyaschitta 
karma for the patita from saNyAsAshrama.  A sAdhaka's sAdhana is not 
restricted to one particular janma to say in previous life he was saNyAsi 
but did not get jnAna and in this janma he is saMsAri but did get that 
jnAna...jnAna is not 'ashramAdheena'. But to obtain jnAna saNyAsAshrama 
sveekAra is an ideal choice. 

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
