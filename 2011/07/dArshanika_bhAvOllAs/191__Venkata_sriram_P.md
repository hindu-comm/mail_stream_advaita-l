Namaste,
This are the outpourings of sAstraratnAkara Brahmasri Polagam Rama Sastry
and the title of this ecstatic outpourings is "dArsanika bhAvOllAsaH".
The author Shri Rama Sastry require no introduction in the advaitic
circles just like Mahamahopadhyaya Mannargudi Raju Sastry.
So, in dArsanika bhAvOllAsaH, there are 63 verses in total 
that give out the essence of Advaita Siddhanta in a nutshell. 

The 1st verse takes off with mangala sloka and salutations to the jagatguru sankara.

The 2nd verse salutes Sankara as "ShaNmathasthApanachArya".

shaivAdiShaNmata gurO ! hyadhikAribhEdA
nmAnaM samastamapi mArgamihAbhyupaiShi
sOpAnarItimavalambya yatO(a)ta Eva
lOkA griNantyuchitamEva jagatguruM tvAM

Here Sankara is addressed as ShaNmata guru who recognized & accepted the 6 paths (sOpAna). 

The 5th verse salutes sankara and explains the bhagavatpAda tattva.

aishwaryavIryayashasAM tu virAgatayAH
shrIjnAnayOrapi bhagAbhidhayA prasiddhaM
ShaTkaM samagrahima yat tvayi saMchakAsti
tasmAt gurO tvamasi vai bhagavatpAdAkhyaH

Sankara is the embodiment of 6 lakShaNAs 

The 7th verse refutes rAmAnuja & madhva siddhAnta as:

rAmAyaNE viditamEva hi lakShmaNOktaM
vAkyaM cha bhAratakathAsvapi bhImavAkyaM
dharmAdapEtamamataM sudhIyAM na chaivaM
shrIrAmavAkyamathavA vanamAlivAkyaM

In Ramayana, the words of Lakshmana and in Mahabharata, the words of Bhima are
dharma viruddha (Ramanuja is lakshmana-amsha and Madhva is Bhima Amsha) but the 
words of Rama & Krishna are the only pramANAs for us. 

The 11th verse extolls the jnAna mArga.

shaivaM cha shAktamatha gANapataM cha sauraM
skAndaM cha vaiShNavamitiha ruchErvibhEdAt
puMstantrabhaktisamayaM vyabhajO gurO tvaM
nO mAnavastuparatantradhIyastu mArgaM

The bhakti sampradaya is purusha tantra and also the 6 paths. 

The 12th verse extolls the bhakti mArga and says that the objective of both
bhakti & jnana mArgAs is one and the same. He refutes the opinion of the people
who say that jnAna is the means and bhakti is the end.

jnAnasya sAdhanatamE kila bhaktimArgE
lakShyEkabhAji na mithO(a)sti virOdhagandhaH
bhaktEstu sAdhanamihAtvadhIyaM bruvANA
bhaktA dhruvaM kalahamankurayanti lOkE

The 20th verse says that ajnAna is bhAva rUpa.

ajnAnaM AvaraNamAtmavibOdhanAsyaM
mAyAM tathObhayamuvAcha kripAlurIshaH
gItAsvadO dvayamabhinnamabhAvabhinnaM
tajjaM jagaccha rashanAhimvadEva mithyA 

ajnana & maya both are same which is bhAva rupa which is different from
abhAva. 
**************
Some more would be given later that support advaita siddhanta sampradya
also refuting other sects.

sriram
