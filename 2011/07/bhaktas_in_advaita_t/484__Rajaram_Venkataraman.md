I would like to know names of advaitins who were also bhagavath bhaktas
(like Madhusudana, Appayya Dikshitar etc.) who expressed their devotion by
composing hymns. Though any name is good, I am particularly keen to have
names of those who lived before Ramanuja to validate the theory that
vaishnavas influenced Bhagavath Bhakti in Advaita.
