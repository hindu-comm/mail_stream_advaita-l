RV: This is a good one. Is there something where they relish relationship
like Andal? For example  govindashtakam talks about of goshti mandala goshti
bhedam and dig vijayams describe padmapada experiencing narasimha's voice
but the hunter experiencing form as well. However, as you know, these
are not totally reliable works as the bhashyams are.
