In fact it is Adi Shankara Himself who started the bhakti movement in
Advaita, perhaps in the whole of vedanta. Please read any of His
strotras from the smal gaNesha-pa~ncha-ratnam, vishhNu-shaTpadi,
subrahmanya-bhuja~nga to the sivaananda-lahari and soundarya-lahari.

Please see vol 17 from the following link
