Many thanks Siva Senani for the detailed analysis.  The purport of the verse
is also quite good.  I found it in a page full of subhAshitam-s:

*http://tinyurl.com/64pehs3

I am curious about this usage: // I*t makes a great deal of noise of
phar-phar. फर्फरायते //  I have come across this usage, however:

In the Shivanandalahari verse 63 on Bhakta Kannappa:

mArgAvartitapAdukA paSupatera~ggasya kUrcAyute
gandUShAmbuniShechanam puraripodivyAbhiShekAyate
kincidbhakShitamAmsaseShakabalam navyopahArAyate
bhakti: kim na karotyaho vanacaro *bhaktAvatamsAyate *|| 63 ||

The last word, a verb no doubt, has that 'aayate' ending.  Here someone
'becomes' or 'attains to the status of' a great bhakta. In the
phar-phar-Ayate the sense seems to be 'the fish is darting around making
that ....noise.'  Does phar-phar itself become a verb or qualifies the verb
like an adverb?  Just some questions on the grammar part.  In case you have
any thoughts on this pl. express them.

Thank you Sriram for giving out the essence of the verse.

Best regards,
