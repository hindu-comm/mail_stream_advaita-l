namaste,

I have seen that the names of the popular vedanta speakers from the
brahmin community are being prefixed with "brahma shri". My
understanding is that the title is for one who has completed
kramaanta-paThana or have done a substantial proper gurukula study. Is
this right? Are there some rules for using it?

namaste
Ramakrishna
