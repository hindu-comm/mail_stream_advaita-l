Sometimes another word is also added before brahmasrI - vedamUrti
brahmasrI.  In its shortened form it is 've.mu.br.sri'...

praNAms
Hare Krishna

Or most popular shortened form is Ved.Br. Shree ( Veda Brahma Shree) 
...But now a days it is not a hard & fast rule in vaidika vrunda to prefix 
this  ONLY to kramAnta veda vidvAns...it would be mentioned invariably on 
all the 'sambhAvane' covers which will be handed over to Ritviks after 
vaidika kAryakrama:-))

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
