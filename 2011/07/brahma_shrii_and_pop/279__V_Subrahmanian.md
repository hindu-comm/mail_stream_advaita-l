You are very close to the correct meaning.  The word 'Brahma' also means
'Veda'.  So, this person who has acquired a lot of veda vidyA, vedAnta,
purANa, smRti etc. and a real repository of such vidyA is really endowed
with the vidyA-srI.  His 'srI', wealth, is this veda(vidyaa).  So he is
referred to as BrahmasrI...

Sometimes another word is also added before brahmasrI - vedamUrti
brahmasrI.  In its shortened form it is 've.mu.br.sri'....

Regards,
subbu
