I personally was not aware of such a custom though it may very well be the 
case in your tradition.

Often times when there is some dosha because of reasons like this it is 
treated as if it were some kind of supreme court judgement but people 
forget that in many cases shastras also provide remedies and workarounds. 
You should consult with your purohit if there is some shanti or 
prayaschitta that can be performed rather than not doing it at all.

I agree with this 100%  Upanayana and brahmacharya is of paramount 
importance in a Brahmanas life and all efforts should be made to see they 
are followed in a timely and faithful manner,
