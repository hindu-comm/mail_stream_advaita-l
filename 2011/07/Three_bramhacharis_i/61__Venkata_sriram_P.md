Namaste,

I personally was not aware of such a custom though it may very well be the 
case in your tradition.

This is a sentiment prevalent in Andhra which is more or less based on popular belief but
there is no smriti references to it. 

I know one family who have completely stopped performing varalakshmi vrata from 5 
generations. When asked the reason is that when their forefathers performed the 
vrata, a catastrophe had befallen them and one of the members expired. Since then,
it was decided that varalakshmi vrata bring ill luck to their family and was stopped. 

So, probably, the 3 brahmacharis case in a home is also a similar story and i know several families who "religiously" follow this. The 3rd one is not invested with yajnopavita.
This is just a sentiment and nothing else.

sriram
