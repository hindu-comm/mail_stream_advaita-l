On this list Shankaracharyas personal opinions outrank yours.

The term Tantra covers a wide range of different religious ideologies and 
practices.  Some of these may well be compatible with smarta views (this 
was never in dispute) but others are not.

The puranas say a lot of things.  It is the task of a sampradaya to 
interpret them and place all those things in proper perspective, accepting 
some and, yes, rejecting others.

Alternatively there simply isn't any glaring inconsistency.  Or if there 
is, you have failed to show it.  We have seen that Shankaracharya does not 
object to the worship of Devi in general.  This is what his followers 
believe now.  We have seen that Shankaracharya objects to tantric animal 
sacrifices.  It is an indisputable historical fact that many shakti pithas 
which previously had blood offerings now have vegetarian ones and if not 
Shankaracharya himself, his followers are responsible for the change.  We 
have seen that Smartas do pray to saptamatrkas and Vinayaka but they do so 
according to sattvika ways only.  We have seen that the views of one of 
the foremost Advaitins of modern times on the subject of Vedic sacrifice 
is in perfect accord with that expressed by Shankaracharya in his 
brahmasutrabhashya.

So what?  I for one don't waste a second comparing myself to Muslims and 
Christians or worrying about similarities or differences to them. 
Smartism is what it is.  I do find it ironic that you are unfavorably 
comparing it to fundamentalism when you are the textual literalist in this 
conversation.  We are not "people of the book."

There are also puranas which call Kapila an omniescent divine sage but 
that didn't stop Advaita Vedanta from attacking Samkhya or co-opting it 
for its own purposes.
