namaste,

Much of what you said is just one-sided opinion in the realm of tantraand also 
not completely relevant.

Most likely shankara is unaware of the intricacies of what now is called as 
dakShiNAchAra and samayAchAra. So all this remains unsubstantiated guesswork.

The other issues you raise are all contestable and the list may not be a proper 
platform as it will be a 100%tAntrIka discussion.

As an aside, does shankara ever mention the topic of kuNDalinI or shaTchakra-s 
anywhere in vedAntic works? I will imitate a response to this for fun :) :

Is it appopriate to talk about Mathematics in a work on Grammar? or some 
similar question will be asked to counter this. :)
