Perhaps shrI Anand or someone else, can give us the correct meaning of the 

following words of AchArya in bh. gItA bhAShya 17.4

"yajante pUjayanti sAttvikAH sattvaniShThAH devAn, yakSha rakShAMsi 
rAjasAH, 
pretAn bhUtagaNAMshcha *saptamAtR^ikAdIMshcha* anye yajante tAmasAH janAH"

praNAms Sri Satish prabhuji
Hare Krishna

I remember that we have, in this very list, discussed same subject, (4-5 
years back I think !!)  wherein I have quoted the commentaries by 
different commentators including madhusUdana saraswati's gUdArtha deepika, 
'as it is' from prabhupAda, chinmayananda etc.   At that time Sri Ravi 
MayavaraM prabhuji also had participated in the discussion & had clarified 
certain things.  May I know which year it was & if possible  the relevant 
thread please.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
