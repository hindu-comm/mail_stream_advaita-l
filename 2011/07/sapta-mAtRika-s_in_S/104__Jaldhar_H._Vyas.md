No of course not.  But there are two criteria in play.

Please see Shyams post from today for an understanding of the Smarta 
attitude to this subject.  Shankaracharya makes his position clear in the 
bhashya on ashuddhamiti chet.

Exactly.  Look at all the combinations:

Vedic and vegetarian         --- OK
Vedic and non-vegetarian     --- OK
non-vedic and vegetarian     --- OK
non-vedic and non-vegetarian --- Not OK.

The Vedas have a general rule for ahimsa.  They have a specific exception 
for the somayajas.  The tantras do not derive their authority from the 
Vedas* so they cannot claim the specific exemption and are judged by the 
general rule.

[* the type we are discussing here.  Some tantric thinkers do try and 
claim a Vedic basis for their shastras.]

Well on what basis does he criticise Samkhya or Mimamsa or Buddhism? 
Shankaracharya is an exponent of the Vedas and a partisan of the same. 
They (and smrti and shishtachara which are based on them) are the sole 
source of authority on what is to be done and not done.  It is acceptable
to follow what is good in other religions whether "Hindu" or otherwise but 
good is defined by the standards set in the Vedas.

The corrollary of this is that the tantrika has no business complaining 
that the criticisms of others are unfair, invalid etc.  He should simply 
do what he has to do and let the chips fall where they may.

That of course is impossible to say.  It could even be as simple as he had 
been debating a Tumburu upasaka that day.  What this shows is the futility 
of relying on text alone.  The texts attributed to Shankaracharya (however 
few or many they may be) are embedded in a tradition.  That tradition is 
still a living one today and should inform our reading.
