praNAms Sri Satish prabhuji
Hare Krishna

Bad censorship! How come you left out the sapta mAtR^ika-s which were 
mentioned 
in the commentary along with preta-s and bhUta-s?

>  prabhuji kindly pardon me, I dont think it is a deliberate omission. 
What Sri Ananda prabhuji trying to say here is :  tAmasik bhakta-s would 
worship sapta mAtruka-s though these mAtruka-s (mothers) have soumya rUpa 
to do dhyAna & upAsana (ref. vide shruti, smruti,purANa-s & various hymns 
on bhagavati).  And you do agree that these mAtruka-s in soumya rUpa is 
noway better than rAkshasa-s in rAjasik category.  So, I firmly believe 
that there should be a some meeting point between purANa-s & shankara 
bhAshya to reconcile this issue without disturbing the traditional 
practice. 

I suggest you avoid playing tricks like these.

>  I am sorry, by this personal comment, you have taken away the 
opportunity from us to listen more from Sri Ananda Hudli prabhuji.  He is 
not such a person to play cheap tricks like this to score a point or two 
over his opponents.  As I have observed, he seldom speaks, but whenever he 
speaks, his speech would always carry lot of weight. I admire him 
wholeheartedly for his scholarship and humility.  I sincerely hope, you 
also know that but unfortunately in a rush of blood you made the above 
distasteful comment on one of the most respected scholars in this list. 
Atleast in future, let us shy away from personal attacks like this to make 
discussion more meaningful & fruitful. 

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
