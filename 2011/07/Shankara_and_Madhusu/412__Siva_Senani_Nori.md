Rama and Krishna being kshatriyas, it is not a wonder that they ate theflesh of animals. It should be a wonder if they had not.

Sage Agastya is a Brahmin, but he did, for instance while dealing withthe menace of Vataapi and his brother; they are also references of others sages having done so. If anything that might be discussed. The simple answer everybody ate the flesh of animals earlier.Nowadays many Brahmins and Vysyas do not, because the Dharma Saastras say so. Dharma changes from time to time, place to place, and situation to situation.
