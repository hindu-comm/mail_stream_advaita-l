He was a true Sanyashi if you value what Lord Krishna said in the Bhagavad (Gita 6.1). Please do not get into a confusion in the maze of the words in the many different ways of expression of the same by different stalwarts of the past. Inspit of my best regards to all the past greats I will venture to say that nothing is above Lord Krishn'a own words.


Regards,

Sunil KB

{{{{After reading above, one more striking name comes to my mind that is Sri 
bhagavan ramaNa maharshi, who also has not taken any formal saNyAsa or not 
cared about any formal saNyAsa at that point of time and in front of 
aruNachaleshwara temple he has taken his own decision & threw away his 
yajnOpaveeta, shaven his head & has not worn kesari clothes. Kindly tell 
me what is your opinion on him.}}}}

Let us also add the prevailing story of how shankara did funeral rites to his Mother even after taking sanyAsa?

While I am no fan of vivekAnanda... I believe he did what was good to the Hindu society at that time. He might have some idiosyncrasies which may or may not go against the dhArmic injunctions, but why make big issue about it?

Even some so called jagadguru-s with long titles on closer examination turn out to be narrow minded castists. Sick!
