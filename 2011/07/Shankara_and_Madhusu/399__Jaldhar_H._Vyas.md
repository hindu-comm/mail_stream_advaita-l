I do not want this conversation to degenerate into a "my guru is better 
than your guru" slanging match.  It is an undeniable fact that many people 
have come to an interest in Advaita Vedanta through him including members 
of this list.  Shri Venkatashrirama said that he was "misunderstood"  I 
merely attempt to understand.

Now take just one example.  You say "he took sannyasa as per the 
traditional requirement."  But he never had any formal diksha.  After 
Ramakrishnas death he and the other founders of the Ramakrishna Mission 
simply took up kesari clothes and assumed new names.  Vivekananda wasn't 
even his first choice, he called himself Vividishananda then and only 
started using Vivekananda some time later.  Is this significant?  Maybe, 
maybe not.  It is however a deviation from shastraic norms.  What else did 
he deviate from?  One should be prepared to ask the question atleast.
