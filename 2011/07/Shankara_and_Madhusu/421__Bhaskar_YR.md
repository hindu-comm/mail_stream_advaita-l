In both cases they were the designated successors and followed a 
procedure.  They did not simply put on kesari clothes, give themselves new 

names and declare themselves initiated which is what Vivekananda did.  And 

Vivekananda did so not because he wasn't aware of the procedure for 
sannyasa but because he simply didn't care for such niceties.  One can 
try and justify that behavior if one likes (though an Advaitin would not.) 

but one cannot have it both ways and claim that such a person is an 
authority on the shastras he ignores.

After reading above, one more striking name comes to my mind that is Sri 
bhagavan ramaNa maharshi, who also has not taken any formal saNyAsa or not 
cared about any formal saNyAsa at that point of time and in front of 
aruNachaleshwara temple he has taken his own decision & threw away his 
yajnOpaveeta, shaven his head & has not worn kesari clothes. Kindly tell 
me what is your opinion on him. 

Your humble servant
Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
