Can you pl. cite reference to Swami Vivekananda's works where he said
Sankara twisted the meaning of BG mantras to promote advaitic view?
Does he mean advaita is contrary to bhakti?

praNAms
Hare Krishna

Swami Vivekananda indirectly implied in his works that shankara was mere 
dry philosopher (shushka vedAnti) with a brilliant mind!!  And somewhere 
he insists that we need people who have shankara's brilliance (mind)  and 
buddha's compassion (heart).  However, swamiji's views would not get much 
currency in traditional advaitic circle.  Our Sri Jaldhar prabhuji also of 
the same opinion here I believe. 

And with regard to shankara's twisting interpretation, dvaitins would 
always like to quote couple of verses from geeta.  i.e. anayAschintayantO 
mAm in 9th chapter and another famous verse 'sarvadharmAn parityajya' in 
18th chapter.  They argue that though these verses quite clearly upholding 
dvaita view, shankara twisted these verses to suit to his philosophy i.e. 
ahaM brahmAsmi, jevEshwara abedha & brahmatmaikatva vAda. Anyway, this is 
their perception, no need to mention it does not hold any water when we 
look at these verses & interpretation from the  shruti's parama siddhAnta.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
