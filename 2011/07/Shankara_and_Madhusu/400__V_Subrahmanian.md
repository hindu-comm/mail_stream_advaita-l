I think sampradaya or not, Vivekananda launched Vedanta, Advaita Vedanta in
particular on a worldwide scale.  Non-advaitins hold him and
Dr.S.Radhakrishnan as the 'unpaid' ambassadors of Advaita!!  He started the
Advaita Ashrama at Mayawati and wanted it to be 'advaitic' to the core to
the extent that he objected to keeping a picture of Sri Ramakrishna at that
place.  That ashrama has published a number of books on Advaita.
