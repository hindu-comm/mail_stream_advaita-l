Dear Jaladharji

In general, I am in agreement with you. The marriage-before-puberty ruleis presently big on my mindbecause we are going to have aVedasabha in our society next month, with our family playing the host. The biggest irritant is that we cannot offer bhojan to the Vedic scholars, many of whom eat only if the food is cooked by a) somebody who is married before puberty,b) their own wives, or c) themselves. We are reconciled to svayampaakam and are making arrangements for those who do the vaiSVadevam regularly.

Regarding daughters' marriage, my daughter is 10 now. We will not break man-made law; for that matter my son has crossed garbhaashTakam but we did not perform his upanayana because I am not happy that he pronounces all the letters properly yet.

I guess I gave the impression that I wish everybody follows the dharma laid down in the Saastras. Such is not the case. I floutedmany rules, knowingly and will violate some rules in future also of my own volition, if the situation demands it. I was just trying to paint the overall picture.

Regards
Senani

Sage Agastya is a Brahmin, but he did, for instance while dealing withthe menace of Vataapi and his brother; they are also references of others sages having done so. If anything that might be discussed. The simple answer everybody ate the flesh of animals earlier.Nowadays many Brahmins and Vysyas do not, because the Dharma Saastras say so. Dharma changes from time to time, place to place, and situation to situation.

Even a cursory inspection of the Indian scene shows that food habits are an achara of jati, region and sampradaya not varna. There are kshatriyas (and Vaishyas, and Shudras) who are staunch vegetarians and always have been. There are Brahmanas who are meat eaters and always have been. It is not the case that the books were changed. They were not consulted in the first place.

The lady of the house under the influence of a Vaishnava Goswami decided to become a vegetarian and so did her daughter. However the rest of her family eat goat, chicken, and fish and don't see anything wrong with it. So she maintains two seperate sets of kitchen utensils and makes two meals one veg and one non-veg each time. All the members of that family, even the meat-eaters would be horrified at the prospect of eating beef. These are the complexities of dharma as it is actually practiced.

For that we have to look at books yes, but also and perhaps more importantly, actual historical practice. My problem with "modern" Hinduism is that at the same time as it is trying to throw off the yoke of dharma, it tries to pretend it is rooted in the past. The mental contortions they have to go to maintain this contradiction are what is keeping India and Hinduism backward.

Certainly more than today, but nothing like a majority. So using this as an example of dharmic decline is somewhat of a distortion of the true state of affairs. But looking back to a fantasy golden age suits the modernists fine as they can shirk responsibility and make "the times" a scapegoat.

>Again look to history. Were all the rajas and merchants always scrupulously honest in their work? I think you'll find that these are age-old complaints. What we have in dharma is an ideal and it is the nature of an ideal that it is not always reached. But there is a difference between trying to reach the ideal and failing versus not trying at all don't you think?

>While girls did tend to get married earlier in former times even then it was not usually the case that they got married before puberty. (It varied a lot by jati.) Once again there is more flexibility in dharmashastra than you are letting on. My daughters Nepali friend for instance recently underwent a ceremony called ihI in their language where a girl (she is 9) is dressed up as a bride and "married" to a coconut. Then she is fed some sweets (the highlight of the ceremony I'm told!) and goes home to marry for real when she is older. In other parts of India there are similar variants where the symbolic marriage takes place with the sun or a pipal tree or a kumbha. Or another workaround is the rajoshanti which was performed as part of my wedding. This is a simple havan which acts as a prayaschitta for the dosha incurred. The point is that there is enough flexibility in the practice of dharma to get around the false dilemma you have
 presented. (However should the time come when you have to choose between dharma and man-made law, I hope you have the courage to break the law.)
