True but he never claimed to be an authority of any kind.  Some devotees 
convinced him to speak about adhyatmic matters and through those 
communications he became a guru to them and many others but he never went 
looking for followers.  He never founded an institution or named a 
successor.  He did not even travel much by the standards of a typical 
sadhu remaining on the holy mountain for the rest of his life.  In all 
these things, his approach was the polar opposite of Vivekananda.

We have previously discussed this on the list.  Although the act took 
place after sannyasa it was the result of a promise made earlier.  Far 
from being an idiosyncracy it was a deliberate decision made on 
principle.  So I don't see the relevance to the current discussion.  If it 
means anything it is a reminder of the great importance of injunctions in 
orthodox thought, importance which both Vivekananda and Ramana rejected in 
different ways.

Certainly one could make that a legitimate argument.  Perhaps without 
people like him the "Brown Englishmen" might have left Hinduism 
altogether.  But this is the 21st century.  The Brown Englishmen don't 
have the influence on Indian society that they used to have.  The 
colonialists have none at all.  Science and modernity are no longer 
foreign intrusions, we are active participants even leaders and creators. 
Are Vivekanandas ideas still relevant?  I have my opinions but this list 
is probably not the right venue for them.

Why make a big issue of Shankaracharyas attitude towards Tumburu? :-) 
It's a search for truth and understanding that's all.
