RV: I have read Sankara commentary and Madhusudana's exposition on the Gita,
which is why I call it that. For other works of Madhusudana and Sankara, I
have to rely on scholars and secondary sources but when they make a point
about bhakti and deviation, I go in to the details because it is pertinent
to my research.

I want that you must read them carefully.I can quote from Adwaita Siddhi
,and Gudartha Deepika where he differs from Shankara.Infact,after
Madhusudhana's time this created a furore in the scholarly circles.It took
some time to set it right.But,it will take more space here.If it is OK then
I can send them after some time.

RV: I dont think Madhusudana's life is well chronicled because it is a mix
of evidences and traditional legends. However, if you are able to point out
literary evidences on deviation, I will be obliged. Pl. note that I have
dealt with "apparent deviations" between Gudartha Dipika and Sankara. On
advaita siddhi, it is a syncretic and polemic work. I would be surprised if
you can establish deviation based on that but will wait to hear from you.

 I dont think Madhusudana's life is that well chronicled but I would be
curious to know if you have references to substantiate your position.
