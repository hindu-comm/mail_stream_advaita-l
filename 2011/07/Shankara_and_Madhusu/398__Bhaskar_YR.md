Let me put it this way.  Vivekananda was a significant figure in the 
history of the Indian nation and an insignificant figure in the history of 

Advaita Vedanta.

Your comments on Swamiji is always  interesting & surprising.  You said he 
is a significant figure merely  in the history of the nation and not so 
when it comes to advaita.  But dont you think prabhuji he is a significant 
figure in spiritual world (adhyAtma prapancha)?? As per his biography, I 
think he achieved almost everything in this adhyAtmika world and 
paramahamsa himself called him as an incarnation of one of the 
saptarshi-s.  Swamiji talked with kAli mAta on 1:1 basis like paramahamsa 
(IMHO, this is not possible for an ordinary historical figure) , he 
experienced the highest in advaita i.e. 'nirivikalpa samAdhi' and he did 
the dharma prachAra as most of the Acharya-s did, he took saNyAsa as per 
the traditional requirement.  Despite all these qualities & qualification, 
why you are saying he is lagging behind in advaita  & his teachings with 
regard to vedAnta is not trust worthy!!??  Kindly do elaborate. 

Your humble servant
Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
