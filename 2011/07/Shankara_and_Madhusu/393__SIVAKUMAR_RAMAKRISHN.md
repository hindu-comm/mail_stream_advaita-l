Sadara pranAmam,
Swami Vivekananda was of opinion that bhagavatpada has
twisted the interpretation of BG mantras which  promoted
bhakthi in adwaticview.This apparent defct has been successfully
countered by Madhusudanasarawathi.This is what I could understand
from the study of both the bhashyas.
Namaste.
