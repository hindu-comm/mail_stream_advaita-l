Namaste Jaladharji,

Now take just one example. You say "he took sannyasa as per the 
traditional requirement." But he never had any formal diksha. After 
Ramakrishnas death he and the other founders of the Ramakrishna Mission 
simply took up kesari clothes and assumed new names. Vivekananda wasn't 
even his first choice, he called himself Vividishananda then and only 
started using Vivekananda some time later. Is this significant? Maybe, 
maybe not. It is however a deviation from shastraic norms. What else did 
he deviate from? One should be prepared to ask the question atleast.

Let us close this thread because it is taking unsavoury turn. A quick mail before closing...

If lack of "formal diksha" and "yOga paTTa" is the problem, then IMO, the argument 
lacks enough puShTi. 

Assuming thename of Sankara to be his pUrvAshrama name, how come after taking
sanyAsa, the yOgapaTTa becomes "sankara"chArya (the pUrvAshrama name???).

Chandrasekhara Bharati ascended the Sringeri Pitha afterHis guru Shri Sacchidananda
Nrisimha Bharati Swamigal passed away. 

Kanchi Mahaperiyaval ascended kamakoti pitha at a tender age after His guru
Mahadevendra Saraswati attained siva loka. Mahaperiyaval didn't have 
the formal initiation of sanyasa initially.

My 2 cents....

regs,
sriram
