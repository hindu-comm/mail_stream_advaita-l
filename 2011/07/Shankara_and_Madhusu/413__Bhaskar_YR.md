Nowadays many Brahmins and Vysyas do not, because the Dharma Saastras say 
so. Dharma changes from time to time, place to place, and situation to 
situation.

praNAms Sri Sive Senani Nori prabhuji
Hare Krishna

So, prabhuji, do you suggest that our age-old dharma shAstra-s should 
undergo amendments from the capable authority  from time to time to 
accommodate the latest stand  of new brAhmaNa & vysya generation ??  As 
you know, Sri chandrashekhara Saraswati Swamiji  has made some interesting 
comments with regard to correcting the already worn-out shAstra grantha-s 
in his book 'Hindu Dharma'. 

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!! 
bhaskar
