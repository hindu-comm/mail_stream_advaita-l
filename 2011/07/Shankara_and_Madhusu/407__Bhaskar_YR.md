I have read else where your article about vivekananda consuming beef !! 
Where is the proof and in which book you studied this blasphemous 
article.  

praNAms Sri Sriram prabhuji
Hare Krishna

I think, in the 'complete works' series it is mentioned somewhere & I 
vaguely remember that in his letters to disciples, swamiji himself 
admitted that to withstand severe cold at foreign land he had to change 
his diet and consumed beef & chain smoking !!  But not sure of the exact 
reference & words..Most of the people are of the opinion based on his 
writings & speech that he was not a good friend of brAhmins & never 
hesitate to criticize their AchAra-vichAra.   But, despite all these 
allegations, we must say swamiji, even today,  one of the most noted 
personalities in the history of bhArateeya adhyAtmika paraMpara. 

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
