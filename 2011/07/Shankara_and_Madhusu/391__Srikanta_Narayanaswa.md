Dear Sri Srikanta,

I saw a post from you that Madhusudana differs from Sankara but could not
trace your mail - hence unable to quote it. You were referring to Advaita
Siddhi without specific references where you allege that Madhusudana differs
from Sankara. Scholars come up with such views and it is unforuntately
posted by Sri Vidyasankar also on his site also. As far as I have seen, true
to his word, he has exposited on the commentary of Sankara throwing light on
the meanings inherent in the works of the acharya. The apparent
contradictions are either different readings admissibile within the
tradition or a misreading by the scholars. Madhusudana, who is revered as a
jivan mukta by his disciple, considers himself to be like gunja and Sankara
to be like gold - incomparable. Of course, the gold, that is Madhusudana,
can be tested for his loyalty to his tradition.

Why dont you please post with specific references why you say Madhusudana
differs from Sankara?

Best Regards
Rajaram Venkataramani

Mr.Rajaram Venkataramani
With reference to your above Email,I should ask you whether you have studied Shankara Bhashya on the BG along with Madhusudhana Saraswathi's Gudartha deepika along with Adwaita Siddhi.I want that you must read them carefully.I can quote from Adwaita Siddhi ,and Gudartha Deepika where he differs from Shankara.Infact,after Madhusudhana's time this created a furore in the scholarly circles.It took some time to set it right.But,it will take more space here.If it is OK then I can send them after some time.
N.Srikanta.
