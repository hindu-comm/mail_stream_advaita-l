Here is a subhAShitam on the above topic:

सुजनो न याति वैरं परहितनिरतो विनाशकालेऽपि
छेदेऽपि चन्दनतरुः सुरभयति मुखं कुठारस्य
- भर्तृहरि

Transliteration:
sujano na yaati vairaM parahitanirato vinaashakaale.pi
Chede.pi chandanataruH surabhayati mukhaM kuThaarasya
- bhartRuhari

Meaning of the subhAShita:
An affable person, (who is) always engrossed in the benefaction of others,
shall not resort to hostility, even in times of (his own) downfall.  Upon
chopping, the sandal tree only smears its fragrance onto the blade of the
axe.

Commentary:
When an axe fells a sandal tree, it does not pick up a sword to fight, nor a
shield to protect itself.  It not only gets felled, but also graces the
blade of the axe that is chopping it, with its wonderful fragrance!  Such is
the grace of a benevolent person.  He does not resort to hostility or
aggression even in times of his own downfall, so as to say.  Such a person
never really falls down in the real sense.  It may look like a downfall in
worldly measures, but then, they are the true heroes.  For, on the scale of
benevolence and graciousness, they shall always stand up high!  Their honor
and repute shall never see a descent.  Isn't that the true measure of
eminence!

A person whose amicability factor doesn't change with adversity is the most
amicable of all!  Isn't that also an indication that, affability of a
person, has more to do with what he gives 'of' himself, rather than what he
takes 'for' himself?  Give, with a good heart and intention.  That will be
thy savior for a long time to come.
