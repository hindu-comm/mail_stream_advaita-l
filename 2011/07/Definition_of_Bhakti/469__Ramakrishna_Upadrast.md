namaste,

You could refer to Shetashvatara for references.

Further, I believe there is an article on bhakti in one of the books
of Gurudeo R.D. Ranade -- I believe titled "Constructive Survey of
Indian Philosophy" --  and which could answer your current research on
bhakti. I felt it was quite exhaustive, including even some references
to Rig Veda. Sorry for the vague reference, but I read the books some
time back when I had access to the books through a library, and do not
have access to them now.

namaste
