Unfortunately, this is a very bad translation and interpretation. Arya Samajists
may have genuinely wished to "improve" the lot of Indian women, but this kind
of translation is ineffective. It would have been far more effective to emphasize
that we have a very strong Goddess worship tradition. Knowledge, wealth, valor,
patience, intelligence, the entire earth - all things held dear by human beings -
are all womanly and are forms of the Goddess.

Vidyasankar
