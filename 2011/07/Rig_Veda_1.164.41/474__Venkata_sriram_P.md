Namaste,

Basically, this gives out the evolution of vAk and forms an important
mantra for contemplation of vAk.

The vAk in its unmanifested state it is 1. Alongwith Supantha and Nigantha, it is 2; Alongwith Nama, AakhyAta, pasarga, nipAtha it is 4; alongwith 8 cases (with vocative
etc.) it is 8, The 8 cases with Avyaya it is 9. And it spreads itself as
1000 syllables. 

In tantra sAstra, this gives out the esoteric meaning in the
form of "sahasrAkShara vidya".

As regards the Arya Samajist's interpretation, it is highly ridiculous to read it.

Though i have reservations against Arya Samaj, i personally admire the personality
of Swami Dayanand Saraswati for his tapas & brahmacharya diksha. 

reg,
sriram
