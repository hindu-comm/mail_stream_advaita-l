Even though Brahman, in absolute terms, is not the container.....yet keeping
that in mind it would not be wrong to say that Brahman is the adhiShThAnam,
substratum, of all names and forms.  For there are no real objects that are
referred by names and forms; Brahman is the substance of all the 'objects'.
 In the Bh.G.9.4 and 5 we have the teaching: All beings are there in The
Lord.  Also, they are not there in the Lord.  This means, we have to give a
locus, a support, for the beings in the creation for they cannot be by
themselves, being paratantra.  They 'exist' on the sattaa borrowed from the
Swatantra, Brahman.  The Lord clarifies that they do not really exist in Him
meaning that they are only appearances in Him, with Him as the substratum.
 The superimposed serpent does not stick to the rope though it is only
because the rope is there one sees, by mistake, a serpent (something other
than the rope) there.  In this way we can account for names and forms being
'within' Brahman.
