This is the traditional position.

This is the clarification Anandagiri gives to the words of the bhashyam on
BG 8.9:

'एतदप्रमेयं ध्रुवं' इति श्रुतिमाश्रित्याह -- अचिन्त्यरूपमिति। नहि परस्य
किंचिदपि रूपादि वस्तुतोऽस्ति अरूपवदेव हीति न्यायात् कल्पितमपि नास्मदादिभिः
शक्यते चिन्तयितुमित्याह -- नास्येति।

The *Brahmasutra bhashya reference given by Anandagiri is 3.2.14 and 15
which pl. read.  There Badarayana (and Shankara) confirms that Brahman has
no form.  I am happy that some of the shruti passages quoted by me in this
thread are there in the bhashyam.  Though this is the absolute position, the
sutra/bhashya 15 talk about the relative position where brahman's form is
also talked about in the shruti.  These, acc. to the bhashyam are only
upadhi based, for particular purposes.  So, the 'form' of the Lord, as
Iswara, is not available for contemplation/imagination.   *
*
*
*Aishwaram rUpam is vishwarUpam. Because, Ishwara is not separate from the
created universe.  That is why in the Mandukya upanishad, the Cosmic Being
is called by three names, jagrat: virAT, swapna: hiranyagarbha and sushupti:
Ishwara.  This sushupti state Iswara cannot have any formal form; it is only
an abode of all the karma-vasanas in bija form, ready for manifesting in the
next creation.  Indeed, such an Ishwara's form is no form at all in the
sense that it cannot be imagined/contemplated upon.  Indeed even for virAT
or hiranyagarbha no specific contoured-form can be given.  The word 'form'
that we might have in mind, a contoured one like a human, is not the one
meant by Shankara in that bhashyam you quoted.  virAT is still a form of
brahman and yet not like the one of a human.        *

What you have said above is true.  We can see Krishna as sarvavyApi only
when we see Him as everything in creation.
If we see Him as Yashodhanandan, we restrict Him to a baby or a lad.  He is
confined just to Yashodha's bosom.
