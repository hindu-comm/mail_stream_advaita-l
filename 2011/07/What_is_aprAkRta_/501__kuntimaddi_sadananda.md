Here we get the hint that it is only 'controlled prakRti' that is called
'aprAkRtam'. In other words, when prakRiti is handled in such a way that it
does not bind a person, it is aprAkRtam. It is the shuddha
sattva/rajas/tamas guNas that are involved as against the malina sattva,
etc. that characterize the jiva's samsara/samsaritva.
