Namaste Praveenji,

A good observation & point needs to be noted. 

In mahAnArAyaNa upanishad, there is a mantra which runs as:

"madhu vAtA ritAyatE / madhu kSharanti sindhavaH" which means

"Let the air around me be pleasant/ Let the rivers be pleasant".

This mantra stresses on clean & pleasant environment. 

But, the worshippersstart the abhisheka with honey, the moment the purohita utters the this mantra "madhu". The word "madhu" is taken ashoney whereas it implies "pleasant".

regs,
sriram
