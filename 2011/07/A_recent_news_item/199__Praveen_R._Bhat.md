Hari OM, Vidyasankar ji,

Thanks not only for sharing this news, but also the follow up mail.

I particularly like what Sw. Jnanaswarupananda Saraswati says about how not
only industrial waste, but all the pooja waste thrown by devotees in Ganga
must stop. He has called for all Shankaracharyas to unite on the cause
towards this goal and future action. As he rightly says, govt acting
independently is not at all working and instead, they should come together
with these ashrams and work together.

I've seen a lot of waste being thrown at Rishikesh and Haridwar, which
worsens during festivals & melas. I read somewhere that Acharya Chanakya
seems to have said that Ganga would vanish sometime after 5000 years of
Kaliyuga. I wonder if its true now!

gangArpaNamastu,
