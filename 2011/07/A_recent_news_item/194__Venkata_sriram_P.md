Namaste,

A good initiation that too from an environmentalist. Let us hope some 
good concrete job from him. 

It is really pathetic to see half-burnt dead bodies, industrial effluents etc. in the 
ganges. 

I have a mixed feeling when i observe Ganga Aarati on the ghats of kasi. People observe
ganga arati, do ritualistic worship to ganga but are not concerned with the contamination
& harm that is done. 

If one is sensitive enough to understand the varuNa sUkta, araNyani sukta etc. atleast
the sanctity of ganges could have been saved. But atleast, better be late than never.

This ritual of pushing half-burnt dead bodies in the ganga should be stopped. 

regs,
sriram
