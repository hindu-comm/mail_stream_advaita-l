Bhakthi is necessary for seekers who are unable to understand Vichara.One 
has to take a quantum jump from Bhakthi or karma to Advaita marga.No where 
he has stated Bhakthi is necessary for this.

I hope you have Sri SSS's Kannada book 'bhakti chadrike'...wherein Sri SSS 
insists the importance of bhakti in advaita sAdhana with some invaluable 
quotes from shruti, smruti & purAna. 

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
