Moreover 'tadanupravishya' Taittiriya Upanishad 2-6-1 says God is
indwelling in all things. He is the Upadana of Jagat,

Infact,the sruti which is on Anupravesha has come to state further,"atmana anupravishya namarupam vyakaravani".this has ben discussed with purva paksha by shankara in the BS bhashya.The indwelling is only from the empirical point of view.Shankara even questions the 
'antaryami'theory of the Vishistadvaitins.
N.Srikanta.
