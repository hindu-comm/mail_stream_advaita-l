Dear Srikrishna,

//
VardhantI (Birthday) ????

//

Entering intoSanyasa Ashrama is like taking new birth of Sanyasis.
Hence, past is dead for them. 

That is why, we should not ask "pUrvAshrama nAma" & the 
related details of yatis. 

I know Shri Swami Tattvavidananda Saraswati is his purvAshrama who worked as
Director (Technical) in a big pharmaceutical company. Swamiji is a Ph.D in organic 
chemistry. After the discourse, a person from audience stood up and approached
Swamiji (who happens to know Swamiji in purva ashrama) and enquired about 
official matters related to His Purva Ashrama. 

Swamiji literally blasted the person who wanted to enquire about such purvAshrama 
related matters.

So, for yatis, purva ashrama is dead. 

But still out of the devotion towards their gurus, devotees celebrate thefunctions
called birthdays,utsavas etc. This is just a sign of their guru-bhakti and
the yati should remain like an observer of those functions with nArayaNa smaraNa without getting involved in them. 

This is the yati lakshana. 

regs,
sriram
