praNAms
Hare Krishna

I am not able to read the article...However, as far as I remember yourself 
& Sri Sadananda prabhuji have argued that for jagat ONLY  saguNa brahman 
is abhinna nimittOpadAna kAraNa and NOT brahman right?? is this topic what 
you have discussed in this article??have you explained the context of mere 
'appearance' of brahman as jeeva-jagat-Ishwara and brahman as efficient & 
material cause of jagat  If yes, pls. send it in a word or pdf format off 
the list to me. Thanks in advance.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
