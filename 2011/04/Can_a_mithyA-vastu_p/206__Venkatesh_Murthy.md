If we tell a lie to a mother her soldier son is dead in the war she
will weep with sadness. Her son is not dead but her tears are not
false. But when she comes to know after some time it is a lie she will
think I wept for no purpose. It was a waste. What is the use of her
tears?  Where is the Arthakriyakaritva of the lie?
