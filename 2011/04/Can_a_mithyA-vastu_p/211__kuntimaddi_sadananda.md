BTW, do you know, even advaita too say brahman is 'abhinna nimittOpadAna 
kAraNa' for this jagat?? But, it is not in the sense that 'brahma pariNAma 
vAda', it is because of the simple reason that brahman is nirvikAri.

And the reason Brahman is nirvikaari is, it is Brahman - meaning infiniteness. Infinite cannot undergo a modification and creation is modification in the status. Hence Goudapaada spends three chapters of the Kaarika to prove the point that there is no creation and apparent creation is only apparent and not real - that is what vivarta means. For the same reason Brahman is nirguNa since guNas belong to finites and not infinite. Hence He is guNa attiita, not just dosha guNa rahita as Bhagavan Ramanuja interprets. 

Hari Om!
