Sometimes somebody may see a woman in a dream and get excited and
there may be a flow of seed. The woman is a dream woman only and may
not be there in real life.   He wakes up. What is the use here? 

praNAms
Hare Krishna

Can we not take more 'appropriate' examples here??  Anyway, the 'moral' of 
the above example is that an 'unreal' dream can cause you 'real' 
ejaculation!!  A mithya 'vyAghra gharjana' in svapna can give you 'satya' 
perspiration & increased heart beats in waking state :-))

BTW, do you know, even advaita too say brahman is 'abhinna nimittOpadAna 
kAraNa' for this jagat?? But, it is not in the sense that 'brahma pariNAma 
vAda', it is because of the simple reason that brahman is nirvikAri. 

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
