Namaste.

In the first instance, the lie told to her has had its effect -  of invoking
grief in her; she shed tears..  This is the arthakriyAkAritva of the lie.
This is because the one who told her the lie had in his mind this or some
other effect to manifest. That objective is achieved once she gave in to the
grief which manifested in the form of her shedding tears.
