Pujya Sadaji,

///

In adhyaaropa, one can have any models of whatever you want as long as one negates all that in the final analysis. I will put tantric view that you mentioned also in the same vein. 
The scriptures themselves provides the appropriate examples for creation - like gold becoming ornaments or mud becoming pots or iron becoming iron tools - these are transformation-less transformations or apparent transformations since gold remains as gold yet there are varieties of ornaments

//

How about this theory...

Having known that all the ornaments are made up of Gold andstart viewing 
theornamentsas "golden" ring, "golden" necklace, "golden" bracelet etc. When the
ajnAna is bhAva rUpa, this is how the jnAni visualizes. Even though, he appears to
see but doesn't see; appears to listen but doesn't listen blah blah....

Afterall, it is "sarvaM khalu IDAM brahma" and the word IDAM implies kArya brahma
(ref. ahaM & idaM).

shrIrAma sharaNaM mama....

sriram
