But Yudhisthira told a lie Ashwatthamo Hataha to Drona. Ashwatthama
was not dead.  But Drona thinks he is dead.  He puts down his weapons.
Then the Pandava army kills him. The lie had a purpose. It made Drona
put down his weapons.  If we tell the lie to the mother of her son
what is the use of this lie? What is the motive? This lie is useless.

Some lies may have Arthakriyakaritva but we cannot say all lies will have it.

Sometimes somebody may see a woman in a dream and get excited and
there may be a flow of seed. The woman is a dream woman only and may
not be there in real life.   He wakes up. What is the use here? He has
wasted his Brahmacharya.
