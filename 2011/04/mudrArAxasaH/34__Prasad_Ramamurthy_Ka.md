Namaste,

I hope a major section of members of this august mailing list may not be
interested in a context where advita philosophy or His Holiness Adi Shankara
is abused / accused.

Learned members,

I have been a part of such discussions previously, but I did respond to them
without any malice. There are some instances which made me 'antarmukhi'.

All that I need to question is, what should we do when acharya Adi Shankara
himself is been tried to be defamed.

Our conviction is this is impossible.

Best Regards

Prasad Kadambi

Adi Shankara on devotion in VishnuShatpadi !!

सत्यपि भेदापगमे नाथ तवाहं न मामकीनस्त्वम् !
सामुद्रो हि तरङ्गः क्कचन समुद्रो न तरङ्गः !!

"Even when there is no distinction between us, O Lord, I am yours and not
You mine, for the wave is of the ocean and ocean is never of the wave".
