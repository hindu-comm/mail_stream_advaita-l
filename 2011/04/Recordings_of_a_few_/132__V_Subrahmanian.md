Namaste.

Members are aware that a VidvadgoShThi (on a variety of topics from
Shankaracharya's Bhashya) was arranged at Holenarasipur in the premises of
the Adhyatma Prakasha Karyalaya in March this year.  A friend who attended
the meet has uploaded some recordings of a few scholars who spoke there.
Barring just one or two the talks are in Sanskrit. These are available for
downloading here:

One may require DSS "of www.olympus.com" player software to hear these
talks.  Kindly download the same .

With warm regards,
