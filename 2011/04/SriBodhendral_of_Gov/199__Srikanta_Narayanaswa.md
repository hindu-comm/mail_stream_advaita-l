Regarding the above question,one name comes to my mind.It is Sri Bodhendral of Govindapuram,who along with SriSridhara Ayyaval,SriSadhashiva Brahmendral and others established the Namasankirthana Sampradaya,which is gloriously being spread in Govindapuram where the adhistana of Sri.Bodhendral exists.Govindapuram is near Kumbhakonam.
N.Srikanta.
