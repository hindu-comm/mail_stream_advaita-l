Namaste,

According to Mathamnaya Stothra composed by Sri Adi Shankacharya every
Peethadhipathi who adorns the Peetham established by Sri Adi Shankara is a
Swaroopa of himself. We all know that Sri Shankarcharya was an Avatara of
Sri Sadashiva himself.
Sri Swaminaha has no personal reasons for this Ayuta Chandi which was
arranged due to Shishya's wishes for the Shashtiabdapoorthi to be
celebrated.  Loka Kalyana is the only motive for the Ayuta Chandi.

Thanks and Regards,
Sriram
