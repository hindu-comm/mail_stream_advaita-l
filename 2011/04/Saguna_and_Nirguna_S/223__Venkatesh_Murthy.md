But there is one more Nyaya known as Utsarga Apavada Nyaya.  There is
a Sruti saying a Pashu can be killed for Yajna. One more Sruti saying
animals must not be killed. The second Sruti means the animals can be
killed in Yajnas like the first Sruti is saying. But other animals
must not be killed. This is coming from Mimamsa.

But where is Sruti saying Brahman does not have Divine Gunas like
Power and Omnisicience. Where is Nirguna Sruti denying Gunas of Saguna
Sruti?

But the divine Gunas are not limited Gunas. They are unlimited. God
has unlimited Power has unlimited Knowledge unlimited Size unlimited
Bravery.

One method to not put limitations on Brahman is Nirguna with no Gunas.
If there are no Gunas there cannot be limitations for them. But
another method is there. Brahman has unlimited Gunas. We cannot
imagine unlimited Gunas but God will have unlimited Gunas.  He has no
limitations.
