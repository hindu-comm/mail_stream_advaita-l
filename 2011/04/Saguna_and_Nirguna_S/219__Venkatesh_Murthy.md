Vedanta Desika has given an argument against Advaita treating Saguna
Srutis. The Saguna Srutis will not be inferior than Nirguna Srutis
because the Apaccheda Nyaya does not apply here. Saguna Srutis say
Brahman has many qualities like power and Omniscience but Nirguna
Srutis say Brahman has no qualities. The correct way to understand
these Srutis is like this. Saguna Srutis say Brahman has qualities.
The Nirguna Srutis are saying Brahman has no qualities other than
Saguna Srutis are saying. This is Vihita Vyatirikta Guna Nishedhaha.
They are not saying Brahman does not have any qualities.

This is a bouncer ball from fast bowler Vedanta Desika. Any Advaiti
batsman can face it? How many will simply duck and let it pass above
head? How many will try to play it and give a catch to short leg? How
many will use hook shot to hit it for a six?
