The relevance of this Nyaya is this. Apaccheda Nyaya says when there
are two Srutis about the same thing the second Sruti supersedes the
first Sruti. But in Utsarga Apavada Nyaya when two Srutis are there on
the same thing the second Sruti will not supersede the first Sruti.
Both the Srutis must be taken with proper analysis. We cannot give up
first Sruti.

In Saguna and Nirguna Srutis we have to take the Nirguna Sruti to deny
Gunas not given by Saguna Srutis. The Gunas of the Saguna Srutis will
be valid we cannot give up those Gunas.

Brahman can be Saguna or Nirguna. If we do Upasana of Saguna Brahman
or Nirguna Brahman the result is same. The paths may be different but
the result is same.  12th Chapter of Gita explains it when Arjuna
wants to know who is better the Bhakta or worshipper of Akshara.

Agreed. Then Adi Sankara agrees Nirguna Brahman has also the
Sarvajnatva and other Saguna Brahman Gunas.  There is a choice for the
Sadhaka. He can go with Saguna if he likes or Nirguna.

He is in everything but he cannot be explained clearly like this. If
we say Brahman is everything this will be difficult for Upasana
purpose. For Upasana purpose we have to say he is Kalyana Guna Sandra
only. For Upasana we cannot say he is everything and meditate on him
like that. It is impossible.
