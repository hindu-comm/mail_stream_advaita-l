praNAms Sriram prabhji

I couldn't understand what is nirguna sruti & saguna sruti.  A sruti is 
sruti, whether it is
nirguna or saguna.  

>  yes, but there is a huge talk about kArya brahma & kAraNa brahma in 
shankara's sUtra bhAshya based on shruti vAkya-s which sometimes depicts 
brahman as -bhArUpa, manOmaya, prANa maya etc. which shankara says : 
nAmarUpavikAra bheda upAdhi vishishtaM and sometimes as 'neti,neti', 
astUla, anaNu, nishkalaM, nishkriyaM, shAntaM, niravadyaM, niraNjanaM 
etc., shankara tells us this is nirupAdhika, nirvishesha brahma which is 
jnEya brahma & the former is sOpAdhika, apara brahma which is meant for 
dhyAna & upAsana.

Ultimately, winning the game is most important irrespective of one's 
school of thought!!!

>  yes, advaita always thinks about the win-win situation hence entertains 
all duality thoughts contextually without disturbing the core siddhAnta 
which is indispensable for winning the game :-))

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
