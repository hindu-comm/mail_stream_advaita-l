Kindly explain what is this Apaccheda Nyaya?

This is the problem. Why Saguna Sruti for Upasana only? Vedanta Desika
thinks it can be for Moksha directly.

The Sruti can teach Neti Neti means Doshas and Gunas not in Saguna
Sruti are not there. Asthula can be Brahman is Sukshma and inside
everything indwelling in everything. Like this other names can be
explained. Idamittham means Brahman cannot be explained with things we
see daily the worldly things. He is God. He has Divine qualities.

This means Brahman has no wordly Gunas we see daily in life. It has
Divine Gunas only.

No it is shoulder height bouncer but when batsman ducks low it will go
over his head. The batsman cannot call a no ball. The Umpire is not
saying it is no ball. You can get run out in a no ball.

I agree with this. But we must hear what others say and what is their
perspective and why is Advaita better.
