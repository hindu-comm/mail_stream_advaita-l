Dear friends,

The system of citing three names from a long list list not alien to the Hindu culture. Appropriately the guru-parampara verse begins with Lord Shiva and includes Adi Sankaracharya in the middle and ends with the mention of the own immediate acharya. There is also one Gaudapada math, which has a different guru-parampara and that does not include the name of Adi Sankaracharya, though Gaudapada was the paramguru of Adi Sankaracharya. Thus it is obvious that the name of Adi Sankaracharya is a must in the guru parampara list for the followers of Adi Sankaracharya only and that name need not not mean the exact middle position among the nmes of all the gurus coming between the first and the last. Thus the word "Madhyamam" need not strictly signify the middle position. 

Secondly the Word "Madhyaagam" like the word "Samaagam" is definitely a noun and it could also have more of a positional significance and is therefore not well-suited at all, considering the above.

Regards,

Sunil K. Bhattacharjya

,when it reads Shankaracharya madhyagam"pointing to Shankara who is the starter 
of Acharya parampara,leaving Sadhashiva and asmadacharya,...


One need not be more loyal than the king(acAryaji) to the 
kingdom(guru-paramparA). 

_____________________________________________________________________________________

In the Advaita tradition,one cannot see Sadashiva and the asmadachrya can be any 
acharya who is the Guru.Evidently,he also salutes Shankaracharya as the 
Guru.Hence,it is not wrong.
