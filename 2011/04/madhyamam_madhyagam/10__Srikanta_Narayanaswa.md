On a lighter side, madyagAm looks like pointing to a child sitting in between 
the newly weds in the marriage album, whereas madyamAm as referring to the 'man 
of the match' placed anywhere in the team group photo.

If interpreted, the person referred as madyamAm means that person is superior to 
both at beginning and end. madyagAm could mean the person referred is equally 
related or the entire line is related only thro him to the one who refers. 
(utkarShAt, ubhaya-bhAktatvAt ..mANdUkya bAShya)

Except at the hands of interpreter, both the words convey the same meaning.

Shankaracharya is not anywhere in the photo,but at the centre.Infact there is 
stress on Shankaracharya in the slokah,when it reads Shankaracharya 
madhyagam"pointing to Shankara who is the starter of Acharya parampara,leaving 
Sadhashiva and asmadacharya,who can be any one who teaches Advaita.He fills the 
central place among the teachers of Advaita.
N.Srikanta.
