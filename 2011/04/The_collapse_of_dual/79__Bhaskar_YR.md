In what way, the nirvANa of nAstika mata of bauddha & nirvANa of  astika 
mata of ours are different?

>  I think theoritical explanation of the term nirvANa in buddhism may be 
different from vedAntic usage of the same term. 'Experiencewise' nirvANa 
may be one and the same in both schools, not sure though :-))  I am not 
that much familiar with buddhism but just guessing since shankara takes 
bauddhavAda as pUrva paxa.

But some of the mahAns had the taste of nonduality without even studying 
the ABC of vedanta like Bhagavan Ramana, Nisargadatta Maharaj etc. 

>  it is because of their 'pUrva janma sAdhana phala'..Rishi vAmadeva 
realized when he was in 'mAtru garbha' is it not??

>  But you can always await for more authentic answers from Sri Jaldhar 
vyas prabhuji.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
