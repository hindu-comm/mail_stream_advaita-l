Dear Jaladharji,

Thanks for clarification. 

Interestingly, Amarakosa defines the term "nirvANa" as:

1) ashtau mokshasya

muktiHkaivalyanirvANa shrEyOniH shrEyasAmritaM mOkShOpavargaH

viz., mukti, kaivalya, nirvana, shreyas, nishreyas, amrita, moksha & apavarga

So, nirvANa is defined as mokSha here.

2) munirvahnyAdau prayujyamAnasya shabdavisheShasyaikyaM 

 ie., nirvANa is related to muni & agni (nirvANau munivahnyAdau) 

So, the jivanmukta sthiti is also termed here as nirvANa

3) nirvAtastu gatE vishvE 

 ie., nirvAta - which implies that in which / whom the air is completely blown out

 So, nirvANa & nirvAta are synonyms

regs,
sriram
