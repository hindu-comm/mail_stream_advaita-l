Actually, they are adjectives describing the noun paramparaa, as have to be both 

madhyamaam and madhyagaam. Sri Srikanta's 'verbal sense' is alien to Sanskrit. 
We do have the equivalent of verbs derived from nouns (as in Googling, to search 

for something on the internet, derived from the name of the firm Google Inc., 
which provides this service) like putrAyati (treats [disciples] like a son).

Actually both are verb related,if it is to mean that who is in the middle.Both 
are dvandva samasa.If madhyamam has to have any meaning,it should be interpreted 
as "madhye thistathi"iti madhyamam,round about,but "madhyagam" is directly 
interpreted as madhye gaccati iti madhyagam,with reference to the 
context.sadashiva paryantam and ending with asmadacharya paryantam,lwe have 
shankaracharya who is in the middle,inour acharya parampara.
N.Srikanta.
