Please, Read the original and see what jAbAlI was saying to shrI rAma in
108th sarga. And then you may realize that the reply of rAma was correct.
Showing too much modesty towards a person who teaches(and thus forces)
selfishness and other bad qualities is not a good thing.
There is no use of abusing persons. Testing will reveal that no one is
pure(even one who criticized). So, leave that. We all know that.
And for philosophies, we must test them to get the purest. If bauddha-matam
teaches what jAbAlI was trying to propagate then it's bad. If not, then no
cries. So, first read original.
