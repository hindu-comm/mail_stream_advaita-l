Namaste.

The above reminds one of a somewhat similar reference to 'taskarAH'
(thieves) in the MaitrAyaNi UpaniShad:

// atha j~nAnopasargAH  |  rAjan.h mohajAlasyaishha vai yoniryad.h

    asvargaiH saha svargyA Ashlishhyanti  | ... atha ye chAnye ha

    mithyAtarkaiH dR^ishhTAntaiH kuhakendrajAlaiH vaidikeshhu

    paristhAtumichchhanti taiH saha na saMvaset.h  |

    prAkAshyabhUta vai te *taskarA *asvargyA ityevaM hi Aha --

    nairAtmyavAdakuhakairmithyAdR^ishhTAntahetubhiH  |

    bhrAmya.Nlloko na jAnAti vedavidyAntaraM tu yat.h  ||



    Now, the obstacles to knowledge: O King, this web of delusion has

    its origin in that the pious associate with the impious... these,

    and others who, with illusory logic (or: logic claiming to show

    illusion and illustrations, wish to insert themselves among

    Vaidika-s -- do not abide with them.  They are indeed daylight

    robbers, and are un-heavenly, for that alone it is stated:



    On account of the web of illusory examples and logic of the

    doctrine that holds that there is nothing concerning the Atman,

    the world wanders about not knowing the higher, true essence of

    the Vedas.//
