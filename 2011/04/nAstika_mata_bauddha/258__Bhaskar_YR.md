such a person is compared with thief “yathaa hi choraH sa tathaa hi 
buddha” who deserves to be punished.

Being a (mediocre) follower of vaidika dharma, I do agree bauddha matha is 
a nAstika mata and has to be a discarded philosophy.  But I dont think 
they are deserved to be called thieves and need punishment !!  When it 
comes to observance of shishtAchAra (moral & ethical values), 
dharmAcharaNa, ahimsAcharaNa, shAnti, sahana etc. traditional monks from 
baudha & jain schools never drop back and lose the race with vaidika 
dharma followers.  The sublimity & tranquility among these sAdhu-s & 
saNyAsi-s is always an ideal for the followers of same path in other 
religions also.  bhagavan gautama buddha stands tall as an example. 

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
