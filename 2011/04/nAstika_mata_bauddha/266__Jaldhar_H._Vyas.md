There have been a range of views towards Buddhism from the astikas ranging 
from quite supportive to downright antagonistic.  Some have accused 
Buddhism of taking Vedic concepts but refusing to acknowledge their 
source.  For instance Gaudapadacharya in his karika 4.99 says

kramate na hi buddhasya GYAnaM dharmeShu tAyinaH |
sarve dharmAstathA GYAnaM naitadbuddhena bhAShitam || 99 ||

"The knowledge of the all-pervading enlightened one does not associate 
with objects. In the same way all souls do not associate with objects. 
This was not taught by the Buddha."

Shankaracharya observes that it was not taught by the Buddha because it 
had already been taught by the upanishads.

So in that sense they are "thieves".

Is this just a case of "the grass looks greener on the other side?" 
Indian newspapers carry stories about scandals amongst Hindu sadhus but 
Thai newspapers (to give one example) often report stories about scandals 
amongst Buddhist bhikshus.  Here is one example from the Bangkok Post.

The lesson to be learned from all this is that one should look at the 
character of the individual not the group they belong to.
