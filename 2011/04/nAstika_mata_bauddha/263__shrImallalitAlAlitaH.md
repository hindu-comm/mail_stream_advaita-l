He may not have taught selfishness, but the word 'etc.' takes care of
anything opposed to veda.

bauddhas teach renunciation without discrimination and jAbAlI was trying to
propagate selfishness with a nice cover of renunciation.
We have to show similarity anyhow to be able to make sense of words of
vAlmikI. He is not a person who indulges in abusing uselessly nor rAma. So,
the similarity to thieves is in some special context only. Stretching it to
every bauddha or every teaching of buddha is useless as is opposed to
pramANas.
