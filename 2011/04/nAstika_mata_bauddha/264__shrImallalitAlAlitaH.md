Why they are called thieves ?

see what TIkAs say:-

1. tilaka-TIkA:-
vedaprAmANyApahartR^itvena teShAmapi choratvat.

2. bhUShaNa-TIkA:-
yathA hi choraH prajAnAm bAhyam dhanamapaharati, tathA
kevalabuddhivAdaratopi janAnAmuttamasaMskArAdirUpamAnatar. dhanamapaharati.

Why they need to be punished ?

because they are thieves. Is anything wrong in punishing those who pollute
society and character ? Also, punishment is given by rAjA. For brAhmins,
etc. it is said to keep distance from those people.

It isn't true for all.
And so punishment was not said for all.

Learning and praising good qualities of others is not opposed.
