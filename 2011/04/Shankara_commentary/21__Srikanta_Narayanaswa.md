But in Chandogya Upanishad 8:12 3 it is not about dream state but
liberated. It is clear by reading the texts.
______________________________________________________________________________________

In the liberated state there is only unalloyed bliss,as no dvaita is 
there.Shankara means this state as the highest bliss(kama),and he calls Brahman 
as the "Sarvakamaswami".In Tamil the sex is called "small ananda"or 
"sitrinbam",where as the liberated state is called"Perinbam",highest ananda.
N.Srikanta.
