SRI GURUBYO NAMAHA !!!
This Great DVD was released by Maha Swamigal on 9th April during the evening felicitation function.

I have watched it twice so far and I must say it is one of the finest productions:
a) You can enjoy The Great Acharyals' Upadesha Bhashanam in Sanskrit.
b) Comments by Great Swamijis like H.H. Swami Dayananda Saraswati, H.H. Swami Paramartananda, Mani Dravid Sastrigal... and many more great Scholars.
c) Quality of production is excellent - Many Thanks to Rajesh Krishnan
d) Well Structured.

Recommended possession by all Advaitins.

I know it is available in Sringeri Math, Sringeri, not sure if it is available else where.

HARI OM
