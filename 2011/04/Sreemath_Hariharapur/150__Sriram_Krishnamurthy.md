Namaste,
Sringeri in the South, Puri in the East, Dwaraka in the west.
Joshimath(Badinath) is the list as per Madhaviya Shankara Vijaya for the
Amnaya Peethas. Pandit Nehru and Sir C.P.Ramaswamy Iyer also concur with
this list.

Please find reference for Hariharapura mutt which is given in official
Sringeri website.

"Under Sri Vidyaranyaâ€™s direction, the emperors made endowments to Mutts
founded by him or by Sri Bharati Krishna Tirtha in different parts of South
India, some of which rose to importance as branches of the Sringeri Sharada
Peetha or as subordinate monastic establishments. Prince Chikka Raya
(afterwards Virupaksha I) made a grant to Satyatirtha of Muniyur Mutt which
marks the origin of the Sakatapuram or Bandigade Mutt.

*Hariharapura, an agrahara about six miles from Sringeri was founded by
Harihara II, and Sri Ramachandra Saraswathi was the first Acharya of the
Mutt established there.* The Tirthamuttur Mutt (Tirthahalli taluk) and the
Kudali Mutt also came into existence some centuries later under the guidance
and encouragement of the Sringeri Gurus and the emperors. The agraharas of
Sringapura and Vidyaranyapura were laid out by Harihara II"
