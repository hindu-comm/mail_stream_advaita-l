I've no clue as to what kind of advaitins have you come across, that too
placing dvaitins above them in vyavahArika clinging! If you meant binding
one's faith to a particular maTha more than another, its bound to happen in
shraddhA bhAva. Even purANAs place one deity above another for the same
reason. If such is the case with devalokA, why get so irritated about
vyavahAra here? Then there is the question of following one stream of
learning against another, the purist's way.

Hari OM, Krunalji,

Although the Bhagavatpada started 4 maThAs himself, his disciples started
more and then their disciples some more and so on. All of them, therefore,
trace back the lineage to Shankara and before. maThAdipatis of all such
advaita maThAs are called Shankaracharyas. I'm not sure if anyone who was
not a Shankaracharya has claimed to be so, as you mention. Its easier to
make out even if someone does so, because there won't be any paramparA of
gurus for him. All of the maThAs have a record of all the Shankaracharyas
from our Adi Shankaracharya and at least a local- or community-following, if
not a lot more.
