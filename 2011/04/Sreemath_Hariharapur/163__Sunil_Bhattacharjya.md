I am relieved that Kanchi mutt and the Kumbhkonam mutt were one and the same mutt only known by two separate names in different times. But has the Kumbhakonam Mutt or the Kanchi Mutt authorities agree to that openly?

Regards,

Sunil KB

In fact to my knowledge the Kanchi Mutt shifted temporarily to Kumbhokonam sometime in the past for whatever reason and later on it shifted back to Kanchipuram.

For the record, I have not mentioned (or implied) at any time in the past that Kumbhakonam Matha
and Kanchi Matha are two separate institutions, let alone talked of dispute between them. The fact
is that they are one and the same Matha, known by the two names in different periods in history.

> As regards King Vikram I feel that the Vikram could be the king who died in 457 BCE and Alberuni mentions about the Vikrama era starting from 457 BCE. That Vikrama ruled from Ujjain and he was the son of Chandra Sarma, the purvashrama name of Govinda Bhagavadpada, the guru of Adi Sankaracharya. King Purnavarman (whom Adi Sankaracharya mentioned) also spoke highly of this Vikrama. Bhartrihari was the brother of this Vikrama and the latter got the Hari ki pairi made in Hardwar in memory of Bhartrihari.

All of this has to do with the identity of this king Vikrama - a linkage between a specific tradition
and India's political history. The history part of it, as always, is subject to research and differences
of scholarly opinion, as always.
