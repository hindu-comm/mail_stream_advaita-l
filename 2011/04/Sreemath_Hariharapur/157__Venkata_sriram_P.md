Namaste Krunal,

//

I have however never heard of
this Shankaracharya or peetham. Can someone please enlighten me.

Great wars have been waged by the parties of 2 mutts and there are some
culprits behind this. Let us not dig out those issues. 

Whether it is Sringeri or Kanchi, we have to salute both as both are patronizing
great upAsakAs and stallwarts in advaita vedAnta. Both the mutts have 
brought forth great scholars of advaita in recent times. 

The most pitiest aspect among the advaitins is that theytalk of "adhyAsa bhAshya",
"jagat mithyAvAda", "rajju-sarpa bhrAnti" etc., but "strongly cling" to "vyavahArika
satya" so much so that evendvaitins don't hanker after these.

Last but not the least,observe carefully the "rAja mudrA" of srImukha patra of
the amnaya pithas. 

regs,
Sriram
