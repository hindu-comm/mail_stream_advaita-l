The present pIThAdhipathi of Hariharapura Mutt is a Master's Degree holder
in Technology.  Soon after education and a short stint with jobs, he landed
at Sringeri and spent a couple of years at Narasimhavanam, on the other side
of the Tunga, where the Jagadguru's abode is situated.  The Hariharapura
Mutt was empty of a Pontiff for a few years and the Sringeri Jagadguru
nominated this young person to the Mutt and that is how he is now the Head
at Hariharapura.

He is a sincere sadhaka and a dynamic person involved in mass movements.
His 'shivadeekshA' programme is a great initiative where  Hindus, cutting
across caste divisions, have been included in the deekshA.  He often visits
Chennai where he has a good following. Smarta Brahmins belonging to the
ShivaLLi sect owe allegiance to this Mutt, traditionally.  Hariharapura is a
serene place to spend time in spiritual practices.  It has facility for
interested people for staying.  Sri Viswanathan, the Administrator, is an
amiable person, always helpful to seekers.
