Please forgive me for my ignorance but to my orthodox knowledge
Shankaracharya established four peethams. Although I know Kanchi peetham is
regarded as authoritative to some devotees. I have however never heard of
this Shankaracharya or peetham. Can someone please enlighten me.

Although I mean no disrespect I know there are a considerable amount of
"Swami's" who claim to be a Shankaracharya and want to know if there is any
authenticity or conspiracy regarding this particular one.
