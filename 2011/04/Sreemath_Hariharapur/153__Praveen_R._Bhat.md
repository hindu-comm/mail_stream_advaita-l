Hari OM,

There are also some other maThAs that the jagatgurus of Sringeri have helped
set up for particular communities such as the Chitrapur maTha of the
Saraswat community at Shirali, or the daivajna maTha at Karki, vaishya maTha
at Haldipur, etc.

The Havyaka maThas mentioned by Vidyasankarji are also followed by
Ramakshatriyas, Sheeligas, Siddhis, Marathis, Goulis, Bhandaris and Kunbis.

praNAm,
--Praveen R. Bhat
