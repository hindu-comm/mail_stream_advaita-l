Dear List Members,

My family and I were fortunate enough to meet the Swamigal of Sri Hariharapuram last August during the Chaturmasya period where Swamigal was observing the vrata in Adyar, Chennai in the Sri Ananthapadmanabha Swami Temple. Swamigal performed Navavarna Puja every day from about 6-9 PM and gave phala mantrakshata to the gathered devotees. Sri Lakshmi Nrisimha Swami is reverentially worshiped in the Matha along with Sri Sharada Parameshwari. 

I believe the Sthala Purana of the kshetra says that Sri Hariharapuram is the spot where Daksha Prajapati performed many Yagnyas and hence, it is beneficial for us to perform any homas/shantis/yagnyas in this punya kshetra as well.

Regards,

Sriram Nagaraj

Please forgive me for my ignorance but to my orthodox knowledge
Shankaracharya established four peethams. Although I know Kanchi peetham is
regarded as authoritative to some devotees. I have however never heard of
this Shankaracharya or peetham. Can someone please enlighten me.

Although I mean no disrespect I know there are a considerable amount of
"Swami's" who claim to be a Shankaracharya and want to know if there is any
authenticity or conspiracy regarding this particular one.
