Namaste

I heard from  Goa Christian converted from Saraswat Brahmin few
generations back. There were villages of Saraswats experts in Vedas.
The Portuguese locked all women and children in a church and converted
 the men with guns.

Today the North East India is heavily converted to Christianity. West
Bengal has more than 25% Muslims. One Bangalee friend told me in 1970s
and 1980s his father in Kolkata did not see many Muslims in cricket
matches. Now my friend goes to a cricket match. He has seen huge
number of Muslims in spectators. Same story in Assam.

The 2010 Census will show very bad results but the Government will
cover up as usual.

To my knowledge the Math was without a guru for close to half a century, when their guru at his old age, left Goa for Varanasi due to the atrocities of the Portuguese government and neither he could return nor he could appoint his successor before leaving Goa. The Sringeri math helped that community to have a new guru ordained at that time three centuries ago. Again towards the end of the twentieth century the previous guru passed away at his young age without nominating a successor and the Sringeri Math helped in ordination of a new guru, respected Sadyojat Sankarashramji, Probably he too qualifies to be called a Sankaracharya.
