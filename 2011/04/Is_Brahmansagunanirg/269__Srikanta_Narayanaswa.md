In the "Advaita prakarana"of Gaudapada karikas,Gaudapada says:
"Upasanasritasya dharmasya jate Brahmani vartate
Prag utpatteh ajam sarvam tenasau krpanah smrataH".

The "dharma"(living being)which is dependent on the "upasana"on being born remains with Brahman(hiranyagarbha).Before being born all are Unborn,so it is considered miserly(krpanah).

Here Gaudapada says that the highest is the "Nirguna Brahman"which is Unborn.

N.Srikanta.
