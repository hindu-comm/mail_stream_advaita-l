Dear Readers,
Sri Sri Sachidandendra Saraswati Swamigal of adhyatma Karyalaya of
Holenarasipur has written a book called " SUGAMA', which is an explanation
for the Adhyasa Bhashya of Shankara, It was published in 1955 when Swamiji
was 75 years old. This book is about 120 pages , explanation for just 3
pages  of original Adhyasa Bhashya. This book can be down loaded from the
web site *www.adhyatmaprakasha.org*  freely available in *djuview* format
and the book is in Sanskrit. The language is terse and needs tution.

Sri K G Subbaraya Sharma is giving lectures on this book daily at Bangalore
for past 18 months and we have reached the end of this book almost.
