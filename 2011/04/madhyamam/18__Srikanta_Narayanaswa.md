Dear Srikanta,
have you read the Bhaja govindam?

Thanks and Regards,
Sriram

It is among the books I have for the daily parayana.I can understand why you 
mean this,as Shankara says that "Duhrunkarane"has no use.But,in the forum of 
scholars we should not shirk away from participating,as Sureshvaracharya says,it 
acts as a whetstone for our understanding.He says,"Na khyati labha etc...."
Thanks and regards,
N.Srikanta.
