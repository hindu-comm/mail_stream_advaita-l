It is true that many Purvacharyas like Jaimini,Asmarathya,Dramidacharya and others wrote separate Bhashyas.this we come to know from the bhashya of shankara where without naming them he quotes their Purvapaksha.Infact,a Acharya Bramanandin or Tanka wrote a vrtti on Chandogyopanishad called "Dravida bhashya"which at the beginning of his bhashya on Chandogyopanishad Shankara mentions.But,historically due to paucity of records we cannot establish their time.The Srikara bhashya of sripathipanditacharya from the Veerashaiva point of view is of the recent origin.
