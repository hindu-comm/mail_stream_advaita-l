Namaste

Some people say Adi Sankara's Brahma Sutra Bhashya is the 20th
commentary. Ramanuja's Bhashya is 21st commentary. Madhvacharya's
Bhashya is 22nd commentary.

Is this correct? If yes there are 19 Brahma Sutra Bhashyas of others
before Adi Sankara. Does anybody know the list of 19?

What is 20? In Advaita there is Dvaita in Vyavahara  and there are
Jeevas but they go to zero they disappear in Paramartha. There is no
Jeeva there. Only Brahman is there. 2 goes to 0. 2-0.

What is 21? In Visishtadvaita they say there is Dvaita here but in
Moksha all Jeevas get united with Narayana. 2 goes to 1. 2-1.

What is 22? In Dvaita the Dvaita is here and in Moksha also. Jeevas
are separate and unequal to Iswara in Moksha even. They enjoy Moksha
with Iswara. 2 continues as 2. 2-2.

This is the neat theory of 20, 21 and 22.  Any comments?
