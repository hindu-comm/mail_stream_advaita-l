Dear Murty,

//

Some people say Adi Sankara's Brahma Sutra Bhashya is the 20th
commentary. Ramanuja's Bhashya is 21st commentary. Madhvacharya's
Bhashya is 22nd commentary. Is this correct? If yes there are 19 Brahma 
Sutra Bhashyas of others before Adi Sankara. Does anybody know the list of 19?

//

Down the line from generations, some of the historical facts are either lost 
or not recorded properly. 

Though not sure and not heard that there are 19 BSBs before Sankara, but yes,
quite a few acharyas seemed to have attempted it.I have studied elsewhere that
upavarsha, bodhayana, bhartruprapancha, dravidacharya, tanka, guhadeva, 
kapardi, bharuchi, suka etc. attempted to have written. But not sure of it's 
authenticity. 

But whatever may be the attempt, as one of the scholars put in the words below:

// sUtrabhiprAya saMvritya svAbhiprAyaprakAsanAt / vyAkhyAtaM yai haraM
sAstraM vyAkhyEyaM tannvartayE //

In theattempt to comment on vedanta sutras, the commentators emphasized 
on their own opionion (sva-abhiprAya)rather than giving the sUtrakArA's opinion. 

So, Acharya Sankara was a trendsetter as far as BSB is concerned. 

//
This is the neat theory of 20, 21 and 22. Any comments?

These are just the gimmicks of so-called numerlogists !!!

Sriram
