Namaste,

Shri Sadasiva Brahmendra Saraswati wrote a gloss on Brahma Sutra by name
"Brahmasutra Vritti". 

Some of the traditional advaita acharyas do study this bhashya for instance
Shri Vasudevananda Saraswati who is considered to be "apara-dattatreya".
He is also known as "Tembe Maharaj" among the dattatreya devotees. 
To His credit is the sanskritisation of "Guru Charitra" which was in Kannada.

Shri Tembe Maharaj used to teach Brahmasutra Vritti of Sadasiva Brahmendra &
Brahma Sutra Sankara Bhashya to His disciples. His disciple Shri Brahmananda Tirtha
studied Brahmasutra Vritti under Tembe Maharaj and passed on this to His disciple.
Presently a copy of this is preserved in Sringeri. Shri Tembe Maharaji had interact with
the then Pithadhipati Shri Sacchidananda Nrisimiha Bharati Swamigal. Both discussed
subtle aspects of vedanta and Tembe Maharaj presented "Dattabhava Sudha Rasa Stotra"
and Brahmasutra Vritti to Swamigal.

So, can the Brahmasutra Vritti be considered as "23".

reg,
sriram
