Namaste

Ramanuja Bhashya is important  after Adi Sankara.

Madhvacharya Bhashya is important after Ramanuja. Other Bhashyas have
no importance today though they were important long ago. Who is
following Bhaskara and Srikantha? Not many followers today.

In South India we have only the three Acharyas followers in Brahmins.
20 21 and 22 are treated in this way.

Though some numerology may be there it is certainly helping us to
remember the three Acharyas Bhashyas in brief.
