My name is Nagendra Rao.

I hail from Karnataka and I am a svatah and parampara sishya of the late 
Mahasannidhanam, Sri Abhinava Vidyateertha Mahaswamigal of Sringeri Matha.

My educational background was in Physics and Mathematics and subsequent 
doctoral studies in business management.  Most of my life I was a 
corporate strategy consultant.  I am semi-retired and currently living in 
New York, USA.

My Vedanta studies and dhyanabhyasa came through the anugraham and 
detailed direction of Mahasannidhanam, though it took place in Bangalore, 
North India and elsewhere.

It is also true that I studied for many years with 'nastika bhattacharyas' 
both Chinese Ch'an and Tibetan Vajrachara.  Also Sufi Islam from the 
tradition of Abd al "Quadr al Jilani through Shaikh Muhaiyadeen from 
Jaffna. I might add that Mahasannidhanam who was my jnana guru vide Sarva 
Vedanta Siddhanta Sara Samgraha was fully aware and briefed of these 
pursuits of mine.
