The size and prominence of the SikhA has varied over time, if you
compare portraits and photographs from even a hundred years 
ago to what is done now.

Nambudiri women also often wear white saris. In fact, their wedding 
sari is traditionally completely white. In other parts of India, women
avoid white saris, except when widowed. There is a lot of diversity
in these traditions across the various regions, but the Nambudiris
have maintained some of the oldest customs, without change, over
a number of centuries.
