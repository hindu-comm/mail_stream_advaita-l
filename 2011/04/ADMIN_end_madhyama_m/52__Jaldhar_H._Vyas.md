It's past time to put an end to this topic.  There is nothing wrong with 
vigorous argument and if one thinks ones opponent is mistaken one should 
feel free to say so.  But when it gets to the stage of  personal attacks 
and acrimony it is time for everyone to step back and find some more 
fruitful subject to discuss.

Valued contributors, please bear in mind that this list has approximately 
500 subscribers and perhaps that many regularly read from the archives. 
It is perhaps impossible for every topic to be interesting for such a 
large and varied audience but one thing I know is that no one is 
interested in who is deleting mails from or doesn't like who else.  Keep 
that kind of thing in private email.
