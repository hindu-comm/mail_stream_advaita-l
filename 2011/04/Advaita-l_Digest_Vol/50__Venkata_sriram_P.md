Dear Chandrasekharji,

After themeals, at the end (ie., after completion of all rituals), achamana should be performed. After the achamana, the right thumb should be placed at the middle of the heart. This denotesthe angushta pramana purusha in hridaya which is Jiva. 

By placing the thumb in the above manner, the below mantra is chanted towards the
expiation:

"prANAnAM granthirasi rudrO mA vishAntakaH ..........ApyAyasva".

Because the Jivatma wasmade to suffer the hunger, a prAyaschitta mantra should be
chanted. 

regs,
Sriram
