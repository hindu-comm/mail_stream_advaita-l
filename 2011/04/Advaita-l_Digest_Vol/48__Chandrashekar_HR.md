CHITRAHUTI : REPLY TO SHRI VENKATESWARAN

Dear Sri Venkateswaran ji

Normally, in Karnataka, the smarthas / vaishnavites do have the
following practice :

On any ordinary day in most of the households,  food is partaken only
with just rasam and rice.  Cooked rice is never the first things to be
served, instead there will be salt, outside the plate, some
'vyanjanam' like chutney, pickles or even some of the usual powders.
Then the rice is served, and then a small spoon of ghee.

1.  Sitting cross legged in front of the plate in your traditional
attire (dhoti and uttariyam) sprinkle little water over the plate,
touching the rice in front of you, chant gayatri.
2.  Parishechana - take little water in your right palm and chanting
"satyan tvartena parishinchami ... " go round the plate dropping the
water in droplets.
3.  Normally to guide the "chitrahuti", a small line is drawn on the
right side of the plate,
4. Chitrahuti - chitraya, chitraguptaya, yamaya, dharmarajayah,
sarva-bhootebhyo namaha - against each ahuti, 2-4 grains of rice is
offered, placing them on the floor.
5.  chanting ...."yatra kvachana sanstham, kshtrushnopa hutatmanam,
bhootanam truptaye toyam, idamastu yatha sukham" all the morsels of
food that is offered are grouped together, again with little water.
6. Now take little water in your right palm, keep touching the plate /
banana leaf with your left anamika, chanting, "amrutamastu,
amrutopastharanamasi" ....drink that water
7. chanting pranaya swaha, take 2-4 grains of rice, swallow without
touching the teeth
                apanaaya swaha,        --------  do -----------
                vyanaya swaha            --------  do -----------
                udanaya swaha           --------  do -----------
                samanaya swaha        --------  do -----------

remove the left anamika, touch one of those droplets on the top smear
over your right and left eye resply, Now you start consuming your food
usual way..............  once you are through with the last morsel of
your food,
8.  take a little water in your right hand, chanting :
"amritapidhanamasi swaha" drink little water and remaining drop it
over the remnant salt on the top left corner and keep dropping the
droplets till it reaches top right hand corner...all along chant :
raurave apunya nilaye, padmarbhuda nivaasinam, arthinam udakam dattam,
akshayam upathistatu." you have now reached the top right corner,
where you stamp your palm and back of your right hand fingers over it.

9.  Get up, as per your house customs do the ablusions, come back,
take away those chitrahuti and throw them outside for ants / birds
etc.

10.  Wash your hands, come back. do the achamya once.

This is what is followed in my family DURING OUR DAILY AFTERNOON
meals. During the night food (if one keen on it), the same procedure
is followed except the chitrahuti.  THANKS AGAIN TO SRI RAM ji ON THAT
REVELATION.

I HUMBLY SUBMIT TO ANY LEARNED MEMBERS OF THE GROUP, TO endeavour to
CORRECT ME IF THE ABOVE IS CHANTINGS ARE PROPER OR IMPROPER... SO THAT
THERE WILL BE A CHANCE TO CORRECT MYSELF.

I FURTHER UNDERSTAND THERE IS A PROPER DIRECTIONS TO FOLLOW FOR
CHITRAHUTI  top down or down up.....  I AM NOT SURE OF IT.   THIS
AGAIN, I THROW IT OPEN TO LEARNED MEMBERS.


WELL, In the absence of any previous initiation to such practices, or
in places where you feel little awkward to observe such practices, I
believe, you can just go with the following sacred utterances from
Gita and proceed with taking of food (This is what I practice)

Brahmarpanam Brahma Havir Brahmagnau Brahmana Hutam |
Brahmaiva Tena GhantavyamBrahmakarma Samadhinaha ||     Gita 4-24

-The act of offering is God, the oblation is GodBy God it is offered
into the Fire of God
God is That which is to be attained by himwho sees God in all.

 (as you are devotedly chanting this, truely, it would appear as
though the Brahman / God appears to be answering with the following
thus )

Aham Vaishvanaro BhutvaPraninaam Dehamaa Ashritaha |
Prana Pana SamayuktahPachamyannam Chaturvidham ||       Gita 15 - 14

-Becoming the life-fire in the bodies of living beingsmingling with
the upward and downward breaths,I digest the four kinds of food.

Types of food : It all depends on one's constitution and nature.  I do
not think there is any strict rules and regulations.  Yes to aid
digestion, (a) it is advised NOT TO CONSUME thick curds during both
the meals.  pls consume ginger mixed butter milk instead, in the
afternoon.  For the night, avoid buttermilk / curds altogether.  (b)
stay as light as possible for the night (c) have an early dinner say
before 8 pm and sleep at your usual time.  (d) ENDEAVOUR TO CONSUME
ALKALINE VEGETABLES like pumpkin (white variety), snake gourd once a
week in any form. (e) as little spices as possible (f) try pinch of
asafotida, pinch of salt with ghee / sesame oil as your first morsel
of food.... it works wonders. ..... (g) practice ekadasi fasting on
just lime juice.... pls do not eat couple of chappatis / upma / beaten
rice ............ (h) followed by a dwadashi parayan - early food.

Well, life is what you make out of it. AS SAATVIK AS POSSIBLE.

Pranaams
- Chandrashekar.

> Subject:[Advaita-l] The position of Shankaracharya in the Guru parampara.
> The Gauda Brahmins earlier belonged to regions from Kashmir to Bengal.The Patanjali Vijaya says that Gaudapada lived on the banks of Hiravati.Later,he seemed to to have moved to Badarikashrama where Govindapada met him.Historically,there are many versions.Some accounts say that it was here that Shankara met both Govindapada and Gaudapada.Traditional accounts have that Gauda Brahmins migrated to konkan region,now Goa,where the peetha of Gaudapada still exists and the Peethadipatis have the suffix "Gaudapada"after their names.(Vide:website on Gaudapada mutt in Goa).
