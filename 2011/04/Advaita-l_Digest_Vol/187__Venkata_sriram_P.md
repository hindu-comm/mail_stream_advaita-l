Namaste Dear Guruprasad,

Realised gurus don't proclaim on roof tops that "ye disciples, come I am realized, 
i will give jnana to you". Neither do they maintain any yahoo forums, facebooks,
linkedins etc. They are always in their antarmukha sthiti.

When the time is ripe, IT JUST HAPPENS. True Disciple do meet the True Guru just
as the honey bee is "mysteriously" drawn towards the flower containing the honey. 

Bhagavan Krishna assures with a statement of solace inBhagavat Gita as "dadAmi
buddhi yOgaM". 

BTW, who can be more grateful and loving than one's own father & mother from whom
we are blessed with Gayatri Mahamantra. And what mantra can be more efficacious
than Gayatri Mantra.

DoSandhyavandana Regularly. It is the "prachOdana" that is required. 

Sometime ago, you asked about the "prANAgni sUkta" of Rg Veda. It's other name is "Balittha Sukta" which every Madhwa chants daily without fail.  

Since, you are a madhwa by birth, the portal maintained by Madhwa brahmins
have published online it's commentary with the name "Balittha Sukta".

regs,
Sriram
