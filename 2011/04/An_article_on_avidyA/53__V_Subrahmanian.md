Namaste.

Here is an article titled 'avidyA' -

http://advaita-academy.org/talks/avidyA.ashx

Here is an excerpt from the article:

*advaita* regards *brahman* as the sole absolute reality, *pAramArthika*.
The question arises as to the status of the world and the *jIva*, the
individual soul that are encountered by all of us. These are accorded a less
real or relatively real status known as *vyAvahArika*. According to *advaita
* the *vyAvahArika* is due to ignorance. To the question 'whose ignorance?'
the *shastra* answers that as the very appearance of the *vyAvahArika* is
due to ignorance, the ignorance, *avidyA*, has to be connected to
*brahman*which is the sole existing principle before the arrival of
the
*vyAvahArika*. Thus goes a verse:...
