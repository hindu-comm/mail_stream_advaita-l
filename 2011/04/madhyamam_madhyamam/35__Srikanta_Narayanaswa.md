Please hold it here!

1. 'Verbal sense' and 'verb-related' arequite different. It is the theory of 
some grammarians of Sanskrit that all nouns are derived from verbs or verbal 
roots (though others like Panini do not accept this fully, they do subscribe to 
the view that many or most of the nouns are derived from verbal roots or 
dhatus).So, are these two words verb-related? Quite possible; but do they 
convey,'verbal sense'. No.As long as you accept that, I have no issues.

2. What is a 'dvandvasamAsa'? It consists of two or more nouns, which inthe 
expanded form of the compound, are connected by the conjugation 'and'. 
Example:rAmaScakrishNaSca rAmakrishNau (rAma and krishNa make up 
rAma-krishNa). madhyamaam and madhyagaam cannot be resolved as dvandva compounds 
as there are not two complete words there.

You might hold your own views on Buddhism or the importance of karmakANDa, and 
there would be variations in saampradaayika Slokas, but do desist from using 
technical words with clear definitions and well established usage like 
'dvandvasamAsa'irresponsibly and without knowing or understanding them. 
Sanskrit grammar is quite settled: that is why we have the moon light of the 
settled form of Sanskrit grammar in the vaiyaakaraNa-siddhAnta-kaumudI of 
Bhattoji Dikshita.

)Again ,on the offensive.Is this a forum for discussing religious topics for interaction or
a forum for assault?If some thing has to be said just for the heck of it,hold it there!.if two words cannot form a 'dvandva'what else is it?Rama and krishna as two separate words make it Ramakrisnau,this is one example of two nouns.there are no hard and fast rules that this is the only example of "dvandva"samasa.I am basing my points on "astadhyayi"and Lagu siddhanta kaumudi.
Do not use the words,"irresponsibly" and "without knowing or understanding",as it is too childish for our age.we are not fools to join this list.Have some temperance in your writing.
2)Your comments on my views on Buddhism and karmakanda are irrelevant to the topic under discussion and uncalled for.If you have some serious points on the topic air them,but impersonally.otherwise this will grow.
N.Srikanta.
