Actually, they are adjectives describing the noun paramparaa, as have to be both 
madhyamaam and madhyagaam. Sri Srikanta's 'verbal sense' is alien to Sanskrit. 
We do have the equivalent of verbs derived from nouns (as in Googling, to search 
for something on the internet, derived from the name of the firm Google Inc., 
which provides this service) like putrAyati (treats [disciples] like a son).

N. Siva Senani
