These names are associated with sertain purvacharyas whose opinions on 
Vedanta, Purva Mimamsa or sometimes even both, the sutrakara thought 
worthy of note but this does not necessarily mean they wrote complete 
bhashyas themselves.  Though I believe Sureshwaracharya in the 
naishkarmyasiddhi does suggest that Jaimini the author of the Purva 
Mimamsa Sutras wrote a brahmasutrabhashys or even an original set of 
sutras on Vedanta.

An interesting thing to note is that both Jaimini and Badarayana are 
quoted in each others sutras but Badarayana often overrules Jaimini 
whereas Jaimini never does the same to Badarayana.  I think this confirms 
the tradition that Jaimini was the shishya of Badarayana aka Veda Vyasa.

If I recall correctly this bhashya is even more modern than Madhva.
