PraNAms

Ch.Up. in sat vidya - it says -tat aikshataa,bhahusyaam, prajaayeyeti. 
It, which is one without a second, ekam eva advitiiyam (sajaaati, vijaati, swagata bheda rahitam) saw meaning that it is self-conscious self-existent entity, one without a second - wanted to become many and became many. Becoming many is different from creating many. Gold became many involves upaadana kaarana. Similarly the one without a second with no other to differentiate internally also, became many. VishishiShTaadvaitin accept internal differences in the sat brahman. 

Hari Om!
