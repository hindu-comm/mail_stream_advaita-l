There are more Srutis like Yato Va Imani Bhutani Jayante given by
Visishtadvaitis. They also accept Brahma is both Upadana and Nimitta
of Jagat.  But the Dvaitis do not accept this. Brahma cannot be
Upadana but he can be Nimitta only. In Brahma Sutra Sastra Yonitvat
the Sastra is not the Upadana of Brahman though it is called Yoni. It
means God is known through Sruti. Like this in this Mundaka Sruti
Vakya 'Yada Pashya Pashyate Rukmavarnam Kartaram Isham  Purusham
Brahmayonim'. Brahman is not the material cause Upadana. He is Nimitta
Karana only.

Any comments from Advaiti side?
