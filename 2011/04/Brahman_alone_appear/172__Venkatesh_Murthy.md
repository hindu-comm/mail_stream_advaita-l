But this is a very very important topic.  The Jagadupadana topic is
very interesting because all three Acharyas have different opinions on
this. It belongs to Brahma Sutra and Upanishads. Why should we stop? I
dont understand this. There are many unanswered questions. What about
Sruti references given by Visishtadvaitins?

Moreover why should we entertain rubbish topics of Nastika Bauddha
Christianity Islam  and New Age Philosophy here? These rubbish topics
are poisonous to spiritual health.

Very disappointed.
