Namaste

But Dvaitis say if God is material cause of Jagat and Jagat is his
body like Visishtadvaitis say it is a big problem. The Jagat has many
defects. There are bad things and suffering in Jagat. How can God's
body have all the defects of Jagat?  Visishtadvaitis will say God is
changed into Jagat. But Dvaitis say according to Sruti God is
Nirvikara changeless.  How can he change into Jagat? This is against
Sruti. You have to accept Prakruti is material cause of Jagat but God
is efficient cause Nimitta Karana only.  Prakruti is different from
God because the Svetashwatara Sruti has Mayam to Prakrutim Vidyan
Mayinam Tu Maheshwaram.  God and Prakruti are different.

But Advaitis can escape from such defective arguments because they say
Maya  is the material cause. In the end Jagat is Mithya only.
It is false like Maya. The defects of Jagat are false. Brahman cannot
have the defects.
