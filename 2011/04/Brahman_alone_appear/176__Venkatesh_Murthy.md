This means you accept Srutis about Saguna Brahma are a lower level
than  Nirguna Srutis. The Saguna Srutis are meant for some preparation
only and cannot give Moksha. The Nirguna Srutis will make the Saguna
Srutis useless after preparation like Upasana.  But this is not
accepted by Vedanta Desika and others. There are many Saguna Srutis to
promise Moksha. Some can give Tad Vishnoho Paramam Padam Sada
Pashyanti Surayaha. Saguna Srutis can give Moksha directly. They
cannot be inferior than Nirguna Srutis.

Moreover 'tadanupravishya' Taittiriya Upanishad 2-6-1 says God is
indwelling in all things. He is the Upadana of Jagat,
