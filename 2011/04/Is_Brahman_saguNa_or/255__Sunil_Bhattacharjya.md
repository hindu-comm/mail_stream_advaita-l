Pranaams,

Yes. When one worships, the worshipped has to be different 
from one but Brahman is separate from none. There is nothing other than 
the Brahman. Brahman cannot be made an object of worship.

Let us 
look at it in another way, albeit this is not a precise example. . One 
wants to talk to a person, who is sleeping and one leaves a message for 
him and he hopes that the person will read the message but can never be 
sure whether or when the message has been read. If however one invites 
the person and talks to him personally no such doubt will remain. In order that no such doubts may linger one may worship the Apara 
Brahman as the Supreme person for worship, though we the advaitins know 
that He is no different from the Para Brahman and we are not separate 
from him and in fact nothing is separate from Him.. This example is not very 
precise but
 one can understand the message, if taken in the positive sense. We have enough 
evidence from shastra and what is required is the comprehension of the 
concept and not the rigmarole of reading more and more vakyas, which are only tools for the understanding . 

Regards,

Sunil KB

That which is worshiped is not brahman - if it is so what about nirguNa
which is worshiped as aham ? So, that also is not brahman !!!

-----
KS: Yes indeed - if one objectifies Brahman for worship. NirguNa cannot be worshiped. It has to be understood. Hence Shankara says brahmaatmaika bodhena mokshaH sidhyati na anyathaa. 
Neither Brahman can be objectified nor aatma can be objectified. Hence it is clear understanding of tat tvam asi. The devotee and deity become one in this ultimate bhakti.

Since you are
 familiar, no further response is needed from me.

Hari Om!
