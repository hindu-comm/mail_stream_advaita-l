Dear Subbuji,

The Chandika Parameshwari Dhyana do mention about the word "a-guNa". 

//

sarvAdyAM a-guNAM a-lakShya vapuShaM vyApyAkhilasaMsthitAM
lakShyAM cha triguNAtmikAM kanakAbhAM hEmAdibhUShAnvitAM
bIjApUra gadE cha khETaka surApAtrE karaiH bibhrati tanuM
yOniM lingamahIm cha mUrdhni dadhatIM chanDIM bhajE chinmayIm

////

It is interesting to note that the words "sarvAdyAM" "aguNAM" "alakShya-vapuShaM'
denote Nirguna Brahman and the words "lakShyAM" "triguNAtmikAM" denote the
Saguna Brahma. 

The weapons described in the above Chandi Dhyana are: bIjApUra phala (a lime fruit),
gadA (mace), khETaka (a discuss / shield) and surA pAtra (madhu pAtra) that holds
honey / wine. One Her crown are described the symbols of Yoni Pitha, Linga and a Serpant (nAga) (this is something similar to a Siva Linga with Nagabharana). 

This is theimage that exactly matches the vigraha of Kolhapur Mahalakshmi. 

Kolhapur Mahalakshmi holds in Her 4 hands mAtulinga phala, gadA, khETaka, pAna pAtra respectively. On her crown is seen the above mentioned symbol. 

Mahalakshmi of Kolhapur is the Chandika Parameshwari that is mentioned in Murti Rahasya of "rahasya traya" of Devi Mahatmyam.

regs,
Sriram
