PraNAms

Shastra says -This that you worship is not Brahman- in kena.

tat eva brahma tvam viddhi, nedam yat idam upaasate!
That is Brahman and this that you worship.

Scriptures repeat this five times to insure thatit is not some thing that any sense can perceive but that because of which the senses have the capacity to perceive - that which is neither known nor unknown etc. 

PrakRiti is triguNaatmikam - that manifests as bhuumi raapo.. .. etc and apareyam .. is my higher nature - says Krishna. That Brahman is beyond prakRiti which has Gunas. He is nirguNa since he transcends the prakRiti. All worships fall in the realm of prakRiti since it involves kaaya vaacaa manasaa and indriyaas. 

To take the student beyondthe lower prakRit onlyShruti says - it is not this that you worship is Brahman. To appreciate this teaching only one needs a chitta suddhi - says Shankara in his commentary on B.Sutra 1.

Hari Om!

Sadananda is no one if he can't produce shAstra-pramANam.
And "upAsanAnuShThAnena" says that upAsana is useful for GYAna. It doesn't
support your view that it is done for concentration. And, It doesn't refute
the stand that upAsanA generates fruits other than that.
