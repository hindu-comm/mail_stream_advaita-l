Namaste.

Every path is 'easy' for the one who is adequately prepared for treading
it.  Every path is 'difficult' for the one who is not adequately trained to
take it up.  In Vedanta worship of saguNa Brahman, considered relatively
easier, is aimed at training one to eventually graduate to take up the
sadhana of nirguNa Brahman which alone can confer liberation. Where here or
by going to Brahmaloka, this nirguNa vidyA is indispensable for moksha.
Moksha through saguNa Brahma sadhana is not denied but what is reminded is
that it leads to moksha 'through' nirguNa sadhana and never otherwise.  The
use of the difficult path is to eventually take one to liberation.  One
reaches that difficult path only through walking the earlier relatively
easier path.  It should also not be wrongly thought that saguNa brahma
upAsana is all that easy.  Enormous difficulty is faced by those who do not
have the adequate love, bhakti, for the upaasya and where there is not
adequate vairagya for upAsyaanya prApanchika vastu.

This is a real misconception.  Shankarabhagavatpada never forced the
'difficult' nirguNa brahman down the aspirants' throats.  One who
methodically studies the vedanta shastra under a proper sampradaya will
never hold views as stated above.  The emphasis Shankara puts on karma yoga
in the early chapters of the Bh.Gita will reveal to one how careful the
Acharya is in seeing that one does not rush to nirguNa Brahma sadhana
without adequately preparing oneself in the karma yoga/bhakti sadhanas. In
fact even in the 12 chapter there is a clear 'sopAna' krama where the
easiest sadhana comes first and gradually through tougher and tougher ones
culminates in the toughest, nirguNa sadhana.

The making available the Tattva through purANas has been possible ONLY
because there is a tradition that protects and nurtures the study of
Veda/Vedanta.  It is not that brahmins should not study the puranas or that
they will not benefit from such study.  It is for the preservation of the
mUla-jnAna-Akara, the treasure of the original source of Vidyaa that this
section of the society is charged with this responsibility of adhyayanam and
adhyApanam. स्वाध्यायप्रवचनाभ्यां न प्रमदितव्यम्. It is not an additional
burden; it is his duty, kartavya.  स्वे स्वे कर्मण्यभिरतः संसिद्धिं लभते
नरः.
