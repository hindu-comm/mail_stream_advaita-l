No problem. I already supported it. But if you want it to be tested, let me
ask some questions ?
That which is worshiped is not brahman - if it is so what about nirguNa
which is worshiped as aham ? So, that also is not brahman !!!

Thing perceived by senses is not brahman. OK. I don't think any one is able
to say that he sees saguNa too. If you say that we perceive him by shabda
then it is also true for nirguNa.

 Even shravaNa, manan, etc. are similar in that case.

Every teacher says  same thing about his teachings.

I'm talking in this way because without providing proof you are just
repeating words. This is not enough for any opponent.
