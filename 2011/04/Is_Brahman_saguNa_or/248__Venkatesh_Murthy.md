But the Prapatti Principle propagated by Visishtadvaitis is looking
easy than Nirguna Brahma worship. In Markata Nyaya of Vadagalais the
Bhakta is a like a baby monkey holding his mother the God. The mother
will carry the baby monkey safely. In Marjara Nyaya of Tengalais the
Bhakta's contribution is zero. He is like a baby kitten. God the
mother cat will carry him in her mouth.  He is not  holding her or
doing anything. He will get directly transported to Vaikuntha that is
Moksha.  The baby monkey also gets transported like that to Moksha.


Kindly provide reference from Sruti where Nirguna Brahman only can
confer liberation but not Saguna Brahman.
