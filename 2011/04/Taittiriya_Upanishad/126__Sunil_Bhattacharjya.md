Dear Venkateshji,

There is mention in some places, which I read quite sometime ago that Sugriva gave his daughter Kalyani in marriage to Lord Rama and it could be after Mother Sita left or could it be a fake story.

Regards,

Sunil KB

If it appears as I criticised Krishna Paramatma I am sorry. But it was
not my intention. Krishna can do many impossible things like playing
with many Gopis and having 16000 wives and a lot of children. But we
cannot imitate him. Rama had one wife. We can follow him. This is the
point. I do Krishna Nama Japa everyday because in Sandhyavandana we
say Sri Krishnaya Namaha in the Achamana.
