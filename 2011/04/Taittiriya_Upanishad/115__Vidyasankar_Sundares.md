I was talking of what Sruti says and where. The bhAshya-s and interpretation
are available to you too, as much as to me. I doubt if my clarifying anything
is necessary at this stage.

Again, the bhAshya comments at the end of the AnandavallI and bhRguvallI
have to be read carefully, for both vallI-shave the statement "asmAl lokAt
pretya," both vallI-s talk of saMkramaNa as an event in time and in both
places, Sankara bhagavatpAda makes his analysis very clear. Also read
bhAshya on the Sloka "asann eva sa bhavati" in the context of the
AnandamayatmA in taittirIyopanishat.

Finally, bhAshya at end of sUtra 1.1.19 and sUtra-s 3.3.11-13. These are
about upAsana/dhyAna vis-a-vis jnAna.

Vidyasankar
