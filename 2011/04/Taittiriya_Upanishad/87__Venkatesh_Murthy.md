But the Jivanmukta can not be the meaning in this sentence because he
says Iman Lokan Kamanni Kamarupee Anusancharan.  If Jivanmukta is
meant how can he roam these worlds. He stays with us on earth.

Other Muktas can roam anywhere.

The meaning can be like this. At the same time Mukta gets experience
of becoming Food and Eater of Food. What is wrong?
