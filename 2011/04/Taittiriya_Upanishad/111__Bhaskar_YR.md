The Jnani can shift from the kartA-bhoktA mode of the mind to the 
akartA-abhoktA truth of the Self as and
when required in vyavahAra/paramAtma chintanam.

Hare Krishna

As said earlier katrutva-bhOktrutva is not the mode of the mind, it 
pertains to jeeva only...na cha asati katrutve 
tadupapadyEta....jeevasyaisha nirdeshO na buddheH...says shankara 
somewhere.  When he realizes that he was/is/will be akarta-abhokta, he 
would never ever entertain these notions again...jnAnAvasthA or 
adviteeyatva is not reversable state to say yesterday jnAni was abhokta 
but today due to some unavoidable circumstances he has become bhokta and 
switched his mode from abhokta to bhOkta. 

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
