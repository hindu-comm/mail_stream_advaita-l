Just as a jIvanmukta on earth can use words and express joy in words.

The upanishad vAkya-s cannot and should not be cited piecemeal, just
to make a point. The totality of the text must always be kept in mind.
The same taittirIya upanishat also says, "yato vAco nivartante ..." and
even within the cited sAman, the brahman-knower says, I am food
(aham annam), I eat food (aham annAdaH) and I eat the eater of food
(annam adantam admi) - all of which makes sense only in terms of
being a praise (stuti) of brahmavidyA. It is not to be taken literally. It
is not as if in the mukta sthiti, the brahman-knower actually sits around
eating and being eaten.

Vidyasankar
