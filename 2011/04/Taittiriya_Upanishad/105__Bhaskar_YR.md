praNAms Sri Sunil prabhuji
Hare Krishna

FYI, I have not said that, Sri Venkatesh Murthy prabhuji said this.  And 
my reply was marked in '>'  to his observation.  Please go through the 
mail onceagain.  I knew that Lord was then a mischievous eight years old 
boy..dont you think he was activing beyond his age limit :-))  In Kannada 
purandara dAsaru sings, entha chatura ninna maganu, entha vaNchakane 
yashode..Neighbors complaining yashOda that her son is a 'cheater' 
(vanchaka) :-))

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar



Dear Bhaskarji,

You said

Like Krishna had fun with Gopees. Rama had only one wife. We can follow 
Rama to have fun with legal wife only. We must not follow Krishna and 
search for fun with some cowherd girls. We take only Dharmic examples.

Do you have an idea as to how old was Lord Krishna at that time?
