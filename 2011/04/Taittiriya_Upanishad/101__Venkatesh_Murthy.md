We must be intelligent to find out who is genuine. Otherwise we will
fall into a trap. What example you have for Jnani doing bad work in
the name of Prarabdha? One example Kashyapa but there are many other
Jnanis like Hanuman.  They never did bad things like Kashyapa. Why
don't you look at them? Why are you looking at Kashyapa only? That
also he did  once only. Not many times.

Your logic is not correct. If we do like that we are foolish. We must
not cheat our own Atma like that. Kashyapa story shows it is bad to do
Sambhoga in Sandhya Kala because Daityas are born from Diti. Knowing
this if we do Sambhoga in Sandhya Kala we are fools. It is like
falling into a ditch when some person is saying there is a ditch in
front of you.

He will not do any Adharmic act. In case he does it we should not
follow. Like Krishna had fun with Gopees. Rama had only one wife. We
can follow Rama to have fun with legal wife only. We must not follow
Krishna and search for fun with some cowherd girls. We take only
Dharmic examples.

We must be intelligent and understand what we can follow and we cannot
follow. If you watch a magician eating burning charcoal you will
follow him to eat burning charcoal?

But if a Sthita Prajna makes some mistake  we must not follow his
mistake like sheep. We must show intelligence.
