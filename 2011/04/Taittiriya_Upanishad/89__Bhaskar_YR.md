By saying so Shankara confirms that not only
does the Jnani have a mind, he 'desires', wishes, and that the Jnani has 
an
ahankAra too:  the word मह्यं  ' for me' shows this.

praNAms
Hare Krishna

Again, I am afraid,  out of context proof.  It can be noted that this 
maNtra & bhAshya are not meant to prove jnAni's ahaMkAra & mamakAra.  It 
is an eulogy of brahmavidya and an appreciation of importance of brahma 
vidyA/jnAni.  The 'saNdarbha' (context) here is glorification of 
brahmavidyA!!  Noway, it can be taken as proof to prove jnAni's 'ahaMkAra' 
and his 'kAma'.  The jnAni is 'AptakAma' & 'AtmanishTa' how can he desire 
for mundane wordly things by keeping his individuality intact by 
entertaining the 'bhOktrutva' bhAva in him !!??  As Sri vidyA prabhuji 
just said, literal reading of these sentences would definitely lead to 
'arthahAni' and 'siddhAnta hAni' as well.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
