Namaste

Taittiriya Upanishad 2-1 --  So Snute Sarvan Kaman Saha. The Knower of
Brahman in the heart enjoys all desires at once.

There is a connection of this with 3-10-5-6. He sings the Sama song Ha
Vu Ha Vu.

He enjoys all desirable things and sings in joy the Sama song Ha Vu Ha Vu.

This means when he is liberated he can express his joy in words.

The Dvaitis say how can you say words cannot be there in Moksha Sthiti
because  Upanishad is saying the person in Moksha will sing Ha Vu Ha
Vu.
