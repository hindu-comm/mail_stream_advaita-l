Having a strong intellectual conviction that advaita can alone be the 
supreme truth, some allow their BMI enjoy dvaita (bhogas etc.,) while in the 
world.

Strictly trying to follow all yama-niyamAs which are stipulated to realise 
advaita, but only at physical level, a few, entertain dvaita bhAva in their 
mind lacking certainity in the advaita being highest truth.

Unfortunately the latter call themselves advaitins/knowers of the truth, 
criticise the former and want to establish advaita in the vyavahAric world.
