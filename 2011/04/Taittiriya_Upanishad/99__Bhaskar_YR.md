Hare Krishna

Which Jnani has blamed the above act on his prArabdha?  Can you give one 
example?  Does the Prajapati's case talk of his blaming it on his 
praarabdha?

>  Then what exactly is the reason for his untimely activity?? you have to 
tell me...Since you are attributing lot of things to the jnAni in the name 
of prArabdha karma, there will be no surprise if somebody thinks this 
activity also due to that karma.  Since you yourself admitted that 
prArabdha karma can sways over jnAna & prompts jnAni to act with rAga 
-dvesha, I have every reason to believe that prajapati's act is due to his 
prArabdha..If it is because of some other reason do educate me.

>  what sucharita one can practice & what blemishles/blameless deed one 
can practice if his/her guru doing some shAstra nishiddha work and asking 
his shishya to follow ONLY his upadesha and asking shishya to use his 
discrimination power for his own questionable activities!!??  have you not 
read vivekananda's 'pareeksha' on his guru?? And I dont have to tell you 
what shankara said in his geeta bhAshya on 'AcharaNa' of shreshTa-s. In 
Kannada there is a saying AchArave illada vichAra amedhyakke samAna.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
