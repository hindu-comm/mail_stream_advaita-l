Namaste.

Your reaction is full of inaccuracies and an example of your complete
misunderstanding of the Purana episode.

   - Where is it said that Kashyapa prajapati used his 'power' *
   indiscriminately*?
   - What is that 'power'?
   - The power that is being discussed in this thread pertains to a Jnani 's
   ability to provide another person objects of enjoyment.  The specific case
   is that of Yama - Nachiketa.  If you equate this to the Kashyapa episode you
   are gravely erring.  While Yama offered to provide legitimate objects and
   opportunities of enjoyment, Kashyapa never did anything like this. While
   Yama persuaded Nachikta by all means, Kashyapa strongly dissuaded Diti by a
   great sermon.
   - Where is it said that Diti, his other wife, is a Jnani?  Pl. provide
   the pramana reference.
   - If you have read the entire episode that was presented verse by verse
   (translation) on this list some months ago, you would not be making this
   completely incorrect remark that the Prajapati 'indiscriminately' indulged
   in maithuna.  The entire episode highlights Prajapati's discrimination and
   not as you have misunderstood.  In fact this discourse is a fine example on
   discrimination.  It contains the Prajapati's own praise of Lord Shiva's
   vairagyam.
   - For your information, this example was solely given to show that a
   jnani *can* have maithuna.  This was specifically given in reply to your
   specific question doubting/questioning this possibility: How can a Jnani who
   has no bhAva of 'another' have such feelings with regard to the opposite
   sex.
