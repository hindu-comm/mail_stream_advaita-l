The Jnani need not and will not entertain bhoktRtva.  Shankara has 
clarified
this in that famous statement: pUrvasiddha kartRtva-bhoktRtva-viparItam hi
akartRtva-abhoktRtvasvarUpam brahma aham asmi....This is the realization 
of
the Jnani.  Yet, there can be kartRtva and bhoktRtva for the mind-body 
owing
to prArabdha.

katrutva and bhOktrutva buddhi can be entertained only by  sentient with 
upAdhi saMbandha!! ...I am not able to understand your statement that 
jnAni does not have katrutva & bhOktrutva but his body and mind would have 
it!!! do these upAdhi-s have notion of katrutva & bhOktrutva on its 
own!!??  And what exactly is the jeeva svarUpa here which is devoid of 
body & mind (upAdhi-s) to conclude jIva who realized and become jnAni is 
akatru & abhOktru but his upAdhi-s having these bhAva-s?? 

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
