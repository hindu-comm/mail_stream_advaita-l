What is dharma and what is not dharma is being dicussed from times
immemorial without any conclusion.

>  do you think jnAni also suffers from this confusion??  As you know, 
geeta prescribes pravrutti & nivrutti dharma, and what exactly is 
pravrutti dharma and what is nivrutti dharma should be decided according 
to shAstra.  So, shAstra is the antya & atyanta pramANa to know what is 
dharma and what is adharma.  ayaM dharmOyamadharmamiti shAstrameva vijnAne 
kAraNaM clarifies shankara in sUtra bhAshya. And smrutikAra manu also 
confirms this : ArshaM dharmOpadeshaM cha 'vedashAstravirOdhinA' 
yastarkeNAnusaMdhatte sa dharma veda netaraH.  Though we, the mortals, 
cannot adjudge what is dharma & what is not, we have to get the required 
'sattva shuddhi' with the help of shAstra Acharya upadesha and shama 
damAdhi sAdhana. 

In order to explain deviations we introduce the concept of dharma sukshma.

Sankara says in Dasasloki
न वर्णा न वर्णाश्रमाचारधर्माः
.................................
तदेकोवशिष्टः शिवः केवलोऽहम्

>  And this shiva (paramAtma) who is beyond varNa & varNAshrama dharma has 
prescribed 'varNAshrama dharma' for the varNAshrami-s is it not??  I hope 
you would agree that he does not have any confusion with regard to this 
'dharma sUkshma'. 

regards,
Sarma.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
