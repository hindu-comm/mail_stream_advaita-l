Instead of appreciating the vairAgya of the disciple which is the prakrta 
viShaya of this section of upaniShad, you are taking it to mean jnAni's 
ability to create.....

praNAms
Hare Krishna

I think this is far better an example to prove jnAni's 'power' :-)) We 
have already read the examples of kashyapa brahma who uses his power 
'indiscriminately  and yields to his wife's (she is also another jnAni in 
that given example!!) untimely demand.  Kindly dont see any sarcasm 
here...this was the  emphasized & insisted example to prove jnAni's kAma & 
krOdha ofcourse due to his prArabdha karma janita dehendriya.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
