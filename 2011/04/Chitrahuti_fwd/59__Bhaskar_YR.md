A couple of points are worth mentioning. As per the
RigvedIya Brahmakarmasamuccaya, the food is sprinkled with water charged
with the mantra "svAdo pito madho pito..." (Rig veda 1.187.2), before it 
is
eaten.

Nothing is there  in BKS  about 'chitrAhuti' prabhuji??  In Rig veda 
prayOga deepika, (by Ved.Br. Shree dhAli Lakshmi Narasima shAstri, he is a 
National award winner & salakshana Rigveda ghanapAti) under the section 
bhOjana vidhi, he says chitrAhuti should be given to chitra, chitragupta, 
yama & sarva bhuta before bhOjana, and geeta shloka 'pachAmyannam 
chaturvidham' should be chanted ...and he talks about the another 
practice, in which a leaf is covered on this chitrAhuti-s and he says 
during bhOjana it should not be seen since these 'Ahuti-s' are considered 
as sura and 'dog flesh', he quotes one shloka also to support this.  And 
in yajurveda also we offer these chitrAhuti-s, but sofar I've not checked 
shAstrAdhAra for this ritual. 

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
