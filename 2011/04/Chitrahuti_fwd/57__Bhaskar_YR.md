This 'chitrAhuti' paddhati is followed in the Kannada Brahmin community,
both smarthas and madhvas too as I recently noticed.

I've seen this in Iyangar's house as well (ofcourse Kannada speaking 
Iyangar's :-))  and sanketi brAhmins too would offer this chitrAhuti as 
part of bhOjana vidhi.  In R^igveda prayOga deepika (nrusimha pArijAta) 
this ritual is mentioned.   But I donot know whether this practice has any 
 'shAstrAdhAra'.  Sri Ananda Hudli prabhuji  may throw some light on this. 


Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
