A couple of points are worth mentioning. As per the
RigvedIya Brahmakarmasamuccaya, the food is sprinkled with water charged
with the mantra "svAdo pito madho pito..." (Rig veda 1.187.2), before it is
eaten. In fact, the sUkta 1.187 is called the anna sUkta.  After the meal is
over, during the "uttarApoShaNa" (amR^itApidhAnamasi), only part of the
water is sipped. The remaining water is poured on the left side, reciting
the mantra, "raurave pUyanilaye padmArbudanivasinAM..."

Anand
