Though it has been said that Saundaryalahari was written by 
Sri.Shankara,there 
are scholars who differ on this.

praNAms 
Hare Krishna

Yes, there are difference of opinions with regard to authorship of various 
prakaraNa texts including vivekachUdAmaNi.  Some of the scholars opined 
that since saUndarya lahari, lalita trishati bhAshya & 'prapanchasAra' are 
basically  tAntrik works shankara would not have written these texts!! 
Anyway, this is the opinion of scholars who are noway related to Sri SSS 
or kAryAlaya...I'm clarifying this well in advance to avoid 'jumpings' 
:-))


But what I am interested is bhAshya on saundaryalahari written by shankara 
which you talked in your previous mail!!??

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
