The Soundarya Lahari is written by Sri Shankara. Why he should write a
commentary on his own works. It is learnt that there are 36 commentaries on
Soundarya lahari and the one by Lakshmidhara is best one.

Regarding the above Email,I would like to say that there was a book published by 
the Oriental library,in Mysore.This may be referred to by the readers.

Though it has been said that Saundaryalahari was written by Sri.Shankara,there 
are scholars who differ on this.

 N.Srikanta.
