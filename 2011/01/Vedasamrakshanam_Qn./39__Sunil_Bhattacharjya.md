Don't you think that interpretation is just a compromise formula?

>How then Manu says that father is more respectable than Acharya and mother
is respectable than father.
True. This occurs in Manu Smriti 2.145, but the word AchArya in that verse
refers to one who officiates in samskAra ceremonies such as the upanayana
and one who teaches proper conduct (AchAra). It is not used in the sense of
one who teaches the Veda, as per the commentary of MedhAtithi. Therefore,
there is no contradiction between 2.145 and the next, 2.146 referred to
earlier.
