Dear Subramanianji ans Hubliji,

How then Manu says that father is more respectable than Acharya and mother is respectable than father.

Regards,

Sunil K. Bhattacharjya

Dear Sri Anand ji,

Many thanks for the translation and the several other related references.
>From a few quotes I had provided from the BhaShyam of Shankaracharya we can
see how the Nirukta/ManusmRti ideas are reflected there. ..

In Kathopanishad bhashya, 2.1.15 Shankara says:

मातृपितृसहस्रेभ्योऽपि हितैषिणा वेदेनोपदिष्टम् आत्मैकत्वदर्शनं ....

//The vision of the Oneness of the Self has been taught by the Veda that is
a benefactor more than even a thousand mothers and fathers..// Shankara
accords to the Veda itself that great status.

Warm regards,
subrahmanian.v
