Dear Professor Krishnamurthy,

Please accept my greetings and good wishes on the occasion of bringing out two publications/books.  As a person who has been in the (Jawaharlal Nehru) University service (although as an administrator) for over 35 years in New Delhi, I could well imagine the efforts that go in the preparation of a scholarly manuscript. Do hope that more scholarly work comes forth from you.

With best personal regards,

Sincerely yours,
