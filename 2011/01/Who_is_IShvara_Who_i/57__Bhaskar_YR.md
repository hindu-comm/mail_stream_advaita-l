Shankara in ArabhaNAdhikaraNa sUtra bhAshya clearly says what Ishwara 
is...brahman conditioned by name and form set up by avidyA becomes Ishwara 
(evamavdiyAkruta nAmarUpOpAdhyAnurOdhi IshvarO bhavati). Thus the lordship 
of the Lord, his omniscience and omnipotence are ONLY relative to the 
limitation caused by the conditioning of adjuncts of the nature of avidyA. 


And with regard to jeeva, shankara says jeevO hi nAma chetanaH 
shareerAdhyakshaH prANANAM dhAraitA, tatprasiddheH, nirvachanAccha..and 
elsewhere shankara also clarifies : visheshO hi bhavati shAreera (jeeva) 
paramEshvarayOH...ekaH kartA bhOktA dharmAdharmasAdhanaH 
sukhaduHkhAdimAmscha, ekasdatvipareetaH etc. 

Dont you think we have to accept & understand the concept of Ishwara & 
jeeva according to paramAchArya's above sentences while reading the later 
vyAkhyAna-s explanation on the same ??

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
