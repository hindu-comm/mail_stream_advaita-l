Think aboutniyoga? Why is it kalivarjya now? 
Eating and drinking without hunger is easy of-course.

Some of these things cannot be explained and are known only through experiencing 
it.
This is where some of the high end haTha yoga techniques like for ex: the 
vajroli come into 

the picture.


>Which Brahmins are performing Vamachara? Where?

There are many brAhmaNa-s who perform vAmAchAra rituals but with proper 
anukalpa-s i.e. substitutes so that their AchAra is not violated. But the ritual 
is still from vAmA and kaula backgrounds. Entire shrIvidya has kaula origins.
