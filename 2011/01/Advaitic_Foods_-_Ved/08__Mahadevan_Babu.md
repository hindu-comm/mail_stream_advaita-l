Dear Sunilji,

Any practice that allows the aspirant to indulge in senses cannot be vaidic.  Krishna very clearly cautions Arjuna in almost every chapter on driving your senses by the sense orgrans.

In Ch 3.37 -> Krishna very clearly reply to this question by saying that:
Kama Esha krodha Esha rajOguNasamudBhava : |

mahAsanO  mahApApma  vidDyEnamiha  vairiNam  ||

This is a "  mahAshana  :  "  can never be quenched by indulgence and will only lead one to until to his sarvanAsham. 

Warm Regards
Dev Babu

The Samayachara changes the attitude of the aspirant trough devotion to the most beautiful universal mother and an initiate is introduced to its own way of advancing in that path. The Vamachara Tantra does it by taking the bull by the horns. It allows the aspirant to indulge in the senses. Abhinavagupta says that the deities of the senses have to be pleased and  that according to him is what Lord Krishna had also said in the Bhagavad Gita. Suppression of senses should not be the way. As I understand he says that indulgence followed by meditation and repeation of these two in alternate cycles delivers the goods. In the process the attitude of both the anjoyeing and being enjoyed vanishes, resulting in getting rid of the ego of the individual self.

It is generally accepted that even for the ritual killing the animal has to be killed in one stroke with a very sharp jack-knife. If the animal is not killed in one stroke it is painful to the animal and is considered a great sin and it is believed that he (to whom the meat is offered) becomes angry.

He refused unless he was allowed to conduct the havan etc. according to Gujarati achara.  A Smarta may no more be involved in such tantrik worship than in Muslim or Christian worship.

Less extreme tantriks say it should be with ones own wife and the dakshinacharis who are more in tune with the Vedic path say it is a symbolic concept only.  (This is also why we make balidana with a coconut or a melon instead of an animal.)
