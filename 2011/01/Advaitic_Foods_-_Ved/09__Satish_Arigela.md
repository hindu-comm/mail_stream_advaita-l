The frequent claim of the vAmAchAri-s on the other hand is that their path is 
the essence of the veda. Additionally they say only one who adheres to the 
vaidika-AchAra can eventually graduateinto their fold like finishing high 
school to go to college.IMHO the claim is a bit stretched & exaggerated but not 
entirely baseless. But that is for another discussion.

? Arent there specific mantra-s used for making oblations of the fat, or other 
body parts of the animal?
I doubt the acuracy of the later part of the above statement. But of course 
blood is looked upon as polluting.

This may not be entirely correct

Perhaps you should say neo-smArta-s whowere heavily influenced bythe English 
morals of the Victorian era? :-)

This is only half true: Especially the later part applies only to some sects

It is good if another woman is involved. Here is the reason: The tAntrIka who is 
performing this ritual involving maithuna needs to have one very important 
quality: He should look upon all parastrI-s as his mother.

Since if wife is involved there is this extreme danger of momentarily the manas 
being occupied by lustful thoughts, they use a different strI. Since the 
qualification for this ritual is to look upon other woman without lustful 
thoughts, it is guaranteed now that the ritualist is safe-guardedfrom lustful 
thoughts entering the mind during the performance. As one can see it is not an 
easy thing to perform..which is the reason they say these rituals are like 
walking on the edge of a sword. A momentary loss of grip over the manas in such 
rituals is said to bring great disaster to the performer

>Less extreme tantriks say it should be with ones own wife and the dakshinacharis 
>who are more in tune >with the Vedic path say it is a symbolic concept only.

a dakShiNAchAri can perform it with his wife. Likewise a brAhmaNa when 
performing these vAmAchAra rites uses appropriate substitutes and the strI would 
be his own wife... but he should gave very good control over the manas. 


But one may ask why adopt some ritual containing elements outside the AchAra and 
then use substitutes?
They are multiple answers to this and none of them are simple to explain, I feel 
at the moment.
