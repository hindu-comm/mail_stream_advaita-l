I don't know about the Mahabharata but this is Manu 5.37:

kuryAddhR^itapashuM sa~nge kuryAtpiShTapashuM tathA |
na tveva tu vR^ithA hantuM pashumichchhetkadAchana || 37 ||

"If he cannot control his appetite he may make an animal[1] but let him 
never kill an animal without a reason[2]."

[1] The commentator kulluka bhaTTa says the piShTapashu is to be made of 
ghee and flour.  See the greatness of our ancestors.  Not only did they 
invent 0 and quantum physics, they also invented the veggie burger! :-)

[2] Dharma is a reason according to Kulluka BhaTTa.  So this shloka 
refers to killing animals for food not for sacrifice.

The nirNayasindhu which is widely followed by smartas include ashvamedha, 
gomedha, purushamedha, and the use of mAMsa in shrAddha in the list of 
kalivarjyAni however that does not include jyotishtoma and agnichayana 
etc.  Somayajnas including the sacrifice of a pashu have continued 
sporadically until the present day.  It is however true that even 
the staunchest Smartas owing to their vegetarianism, have become rather 
squeamish about the whole idea.

OOps. when I wrote my earlier message today I didn't see that Shri 
Subrahmanian has already mentioned this sutra but anyway the key point is 
to notice that both the pro and anti side invoke the authority of Shruti 
which you would not expect from Jains or Buddhists.
