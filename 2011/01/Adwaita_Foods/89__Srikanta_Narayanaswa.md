With reference to the above topic,SriKrishna himself in the Bhagawathgita 
provides the answer for this question.In Chapter 17 while explaining the types 
of foods,He says:

Aharastvae sarvasya trividho bhavathi priyah!
Yajnastapastatha danam tesham Bhedamivam shrunu!!--7

The food is of three categories which are liked by men.

Ayastsatvabalarogya sukha preethi vivardhanaah!
Rasyah,snigdhah sthra hrdya aharaah satvikapriyah!!-8.

That which is of energy,which builds health,that which is 
comfortable,that which increases love,that which is luscious,
that which is snigdha(like ghee),that which is stable,heartfelt(hrdya)
that food is likeable by the men who are "Satvik"in nature.

Katvamlalavanaatyushna teeksharukhavidahinah!
Ahara Rajasasyeshta dukha shokamayapradah!!-9

That food which is pungent,acidic,salty which produces heat,which is sharp to 
the tongue
and hot,is called "Rajasik"which produces sorrow,remorse and regret is liked by 
men of Rajasik termperament.

Tathayamam gatarasam puti paryushitam cayath!
ucchishtamapi caamedhyam Bhojanam tamasapriyam!!-10

That food which is old(yathayamam),that which has lost its lusciousness,that 
which is stale,that which has been castaway,that which is not palatable is 
called "Tamasik",which is liked by men of Tamasik terperament.

It is clear from the above,that the "Advaitic Food" is what is described in 
the7 th Shloka,which is satvik.


 N.Srikanta.
