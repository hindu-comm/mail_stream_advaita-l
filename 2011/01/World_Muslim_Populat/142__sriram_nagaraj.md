Although it may not be directly relevant to this list, I think it has an indirect relationship. What Sri Venkatesh brought up is a very important point -- and it is completely undeniable that we as Hindus have put up long enough.

This is a very serious threat to the future of our existence: as projected by 2050-2075 Hindus will not be able to have a majority in the legislative procedure in India -- as it is, we don't get funded trips to Kashi or Rameshvaram, while Hajj is not a problem. 

The intelligentsia around the world are racking their brains to see what to be done: Just look at UK, Netherlands etc. So, even if you don't wish to respond to this issue, don't color the truth and brush aside this matter as non-existent, enough of this brainwashing has been done by Nehru and gang. Just look at standard 10 textbooks in History in India CBSE board. Not more than few places mention the atrocities of the Hindu Holocaust that happened starting from Babur up to Aurangazeb. Moreover, it is sickening the way socialism is portrayed as a very "common sense" approach to government, sweeping under the rug the chaos and corruption it entails. 

Sri Ramakrishna, being an avatar, is right. However, the current day Islam is not really being interpreted as it should be, again this is my opinion. There have been very great Sufi saints and mystics who have reveled in the same Brahman as our Rishis, but they are a microscopic minority today. I believe Sri Venkatesh is referring the fanatics who want their way or no way. Any ideology that claims or hints at proselytizing is to be rejected. Certainly, Sri Ramakrishna did not thrust his opinions or view on everyone, just as he did not encourage the same Sadhana to all his disciples.

Look -- if you think you can just keep quiet and put up with fundamentalist tendencies, fine. But don't thrust that opinion on others: I want an India that is backed by our values and culture but the hard reality is that this is most likely just a dream (aside: so is everything else, but...). But to preserve our Vaidika tradition is of utmost importance and as Sri Venkatesh rightly pointed out a first place to start is to have more Vaidikas being born and even if Loukika, it is possible to return to Vaidika tradition as exemplified by Sri Hariram Atreyaji and Sri Mahesh Vadyar. The important thing is to have the Brahmana beeja in the blood.

About quality vs quantity: It does not take a lot of time for a "worldly" Brahmana to return to our roots. Just a sideways glance of a great Jivanmukta is sufficient. Innumerable cases like this have happened with Sri Chandrasekhara Bharati Mahaswamigal, Sri Abhinava Vidyathirtha Mahaswamigal and Sri Sri Sri Mahaperiyava. However, if one is not born to begin with, what can be said?

Furthermore, the opposition i.e. Islamic fundamentalists are going to grow no matter what. Anyone denying this better wake up and smell the coffee. Look at Egypt in the last 48-72 hours. What happened to Iran in the 70's?

Attached are two sources that I think are very apt to this discussion. One is a short but fiery speech by Swami Chinmayananda where he makes reference to the Muslim onslaught. The second is a short article obtained from Sri Kamakoti website. Here, Sri Sri Sri Mahaperiyava tell us how even though we may not be Vaidika, it is possible to get back provided one has been chanting the Gayatri Mantra. For those who have not, there is now way back.

Wrapping up this rather personal note, I hope that the list members are aware of this dimension of our society. Swami Dayananda Saraswati is doing a great service by Acharya Sabha and other related activities and we need to absolutely support him and other similar organizations.

U r right, it has no relevance! But it just curdles my mind when I read such
"old worldly and biased" views (and they do crop up many a time) against any
community. It might be because I take my Guru as Sri Ramakrishna, for whom
every religion was true and hence throwing aspersions against any one would
be nothing short of blasphemy! I will gladly make this my last post on this
topic, having said all that I wanted to...
