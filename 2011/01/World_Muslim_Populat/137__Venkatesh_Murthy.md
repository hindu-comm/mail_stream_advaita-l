Muslims are multiplying. But Brahmins/Hindus are obeying Government in
family planning. They must see how the Govt. of India is decieving us.
Reducing Brahmin population and increasing the so called minority vote
bank. Brahmins must stop family planning and have children like our
Grandfather's generation had. If there is only one child per family
chance of Dharma surviving is not good. Let Dharma be protected
