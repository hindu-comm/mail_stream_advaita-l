Dear Venkatesh,
It seems that we are being consufed religion with politics. 

From political point of view you are right that Hindus' number is dwindling down 
as compared to the others in the world. In the world where politics determines 
everything, and number is crucial in democratic politics, your concern is valid.

From dharmik perspective, I doubt, whether your concern matters. 
Gau, chandal, etc. are all equal for the enlightened and brahmin or the the 
other does not matter for you to be religious. 

Number is non only nothing for religion and the Almighty in my humble opinion 
but it is absurd and humorous to think excel one community by the other through 
multiplying like rats or rabbits lin the laboratory.

More, many memorable good dharmik persons in India from even the Hindus' 
perspective were from non-Hindu communities in the past.

My regards,

Bishwa Prakash Subedi

Muslims are multiplying. But Brahmins/Hindus are obeying Government in
family planning. They must see how the Govt. of India is decieving us.
Reducing Brahmin population and increasing the so called minority vote
bank. Brahmins must stop family planning and have children like our
Grandfather's generation had. If there is only one child per family
chance of Dharma surviving is not good. Let Dharma be protected
