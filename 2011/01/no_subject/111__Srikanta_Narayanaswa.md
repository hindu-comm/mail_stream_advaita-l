Yes, there are difference of opinions with regard to authorship of various 
prakaraNa texts including vivekachUdAmaNi. Some of the scholars opined 
that since saUndarya lahari, lalita trishati bhAshya & 'prapanchasAra' are 
basically tAntrik works shankara would not have written these texts!! 
Anyway, this is the opinion of scholars who are noway related to Sri SSS 
or kAryAlaya...I'm clarifying this well in advance to avoid 'jumpings'

I had this book on "Saundaryalahari"which was published from the Oriental 
Library,Mysore.Unfortunately,I lost this book.I will have to findout whether it 
has been printed again.
SriSri Sacchidanandrenda Saraswathi,however doubts whether it was written by 
Sri,Shankara.

Regards,
 N.Srikanta.
