If this were true,then how canSvetaketu perform "Shraddha"to Uddalaka?.

There is also another story in Chandogyopanishath.A boy by name,Satyakama comes 
to the Rishi with the request to teach him Brahmavidya.For this the Rishi asks 
the boy to which Gotra he belongs to.For this the boy asks his mother Jabala,to 
which gotra he belongs to.His mother replies that as she was devoted to the 
service of the guests,she could not remember to which gotra he belongs to.Even 
though many interpretation are there,Sri.Shankara Bhagawathpada in his bhashya 
writes with most consideration and decency.He writes:Jabala says,since she was 
preoccupied with her household duties she didnot have the time or inclination to 
ask his father to which gotra he belongs to.Such is the greatness and 
consideration and sympathy for women by Sri.Shankara.
Regards,
 N.Srikanta.
