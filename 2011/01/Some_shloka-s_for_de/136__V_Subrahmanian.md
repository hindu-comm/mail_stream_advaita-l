Here is the verse on Sri Shankaracharya that is actually the last verse in
Vol.1 (and not in Vol.2):

जयतु जयतु नित्यं शङ्कराचार्यवर्यो
जयतु जयतु तस्याद्वैतविद्यानवद्या ।
जयतु जयतु लोके तच्चरित्रं पवित्रं
जयतु जयतु भक्तिस्तत्पदाब्जे जनानाम् ॥

jayatu jayatu nityam shankarAchAryavaryo
jayatu jayatu tasya-advaita-vidyaa-anavadyA .
jayatu jayatu loke taccharitram pavitram
jayatu jayatu bhaktis-tat-padAbje janAnAm .

Meaning:

Glory forever to Shankara the most venerable Acharya
Glory to His Advaita, the immaculate system
Glorious be His blemishless conduct purifying one and all
May people's devotion to His Lotus Feet grow forever

Salutations to the composer of this beautiful verse.  Anyone may please
improve the translation.
