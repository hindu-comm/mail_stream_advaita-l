 Dear List Members,

I am trying to locate a footnote reference that cites three of Sankara's disciples independently holding Saksi in the place of "Ultimate Experience". I'm misquoting but not grossly. If anyone knows where this came from, I'd much appreciate knowing.  

Thanks in advance. -Michael C
