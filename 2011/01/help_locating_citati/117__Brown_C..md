I would be interested to know the views of Ramana Maharshi on evolution,
specifically Darwinian evolution.  I know he usually advised to be concerned
about the present, to live in the present and not the past, so naturally
evolution of the Darwinian sort would be irrelevant to the query of Who am
I?  But I was still wondering if he ever said much more about
evolution/Darwinism.

Thanks!

Mackenzie Brown
