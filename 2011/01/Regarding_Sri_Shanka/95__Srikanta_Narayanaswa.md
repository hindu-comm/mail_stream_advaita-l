With reference to the above topic,there is a book published by the Oriental 
Library,Mysore.In that book,there is a commentary by Lakshmidhara Kavi,and the 
bhashya of Sri.Shankara.He explains the various shlokas with the statement:"Atra 
padayojana".In that book he expresses the prevalent "kaula marga"with the 
"Vaidika marga"of the "Sri Chakra"worship.
Regards,
 N.Srikanta.
