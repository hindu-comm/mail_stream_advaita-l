It is *quite silly* of anyone to ask if this is because of tAntric or celtic or 
Toaist influence.

What now: everything that you see against dharma is because of tAntrik 
influence?

What is tAntrikanyway?: Something is labeled tAntrika because that system 
follows texts usually referred to as tantra-s which are in the form a dialogue 
between shiva and devI and approved by viShNu.

If some practice or text is against the injunctions of the smriti, it does not 
become tAntrika!! It so happens that a few practices intersect with what in a 
different mArga called vaidika. 


Normallya brAhmaNa who doesnt adhere to his Achara will never get initiation 
into the tAntrik lore by any genuine tAntrika.

Whoa! this discussion could be totally pointless. Some just dont get it...no 
matter what
