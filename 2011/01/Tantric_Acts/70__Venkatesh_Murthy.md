Many think Tantric rituals allow prohibited acts like men and women
enjoying  in a group.A man is allowed to enjoy another man's wife.
This Maithuna by groups allowed in Tantric books? If it is in books
what is meaning behind this?  Is it bad propaganda by anti Hindu
people and Christians? They wrote of Sakti Puja and Namadhari
Vaishnavas doing these Vamachara acts.
