But before the British rule came also there were many restrictions.
The Ashwamedha Yajna is prohibited in Kali Yuga this restriction was
earlier than British rule.  You can read in Ashwamedha on Wikipedia
the Queen spends a night with the dead horse.  In the morning they say
a mantra for purification used even today in daily Puja. The
restrictions on Vamachara were not there they came later. Is this
true?
