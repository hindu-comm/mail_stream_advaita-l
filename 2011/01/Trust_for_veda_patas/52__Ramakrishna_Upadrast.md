> An Acharya with about eight of his young students was teaching Veda with the

> There was also a newsletter of the pAThashAla handed out.

> I mentioned the above here as there is an effort to identify

> I wish to share a fine experience that I had during my most recent visit to
> Sringeri. During the night Chandramouleeswara pUjaa performed by HH the
> Jagadguru Himself, after the chanting of Sri Rudram/chamakam, the
> PuruSha/Sree/Durga SUktams, a set of vidyArthis and their adhyApaka chanted
> portions from the Rg Veda. The chanting, in fine pace and unison, created a
> very soothing feeling. I was told that a few days ago HH had asked the
> Yajur Veda to be chanted daily at that time and it was concluded at a
> particular stage and now the Rg Veda samhita chanting is going on daily. I
> stayed for three days there and had the wonderful opportunity of listening
> to the chanting. On earlier occasions I have also heard the Yajurveda
> samhita chanting during the night pUja.
