Respected Sir(s),

As a followup to the letter written by Mahodaya Vidyasankar, I had couple of
expectations as a new member of the group and would be greatly benefited if
the learned ones consider helping novices like me.

One of the questions i have is, why cannot the list help its relatively new
members to read vedantic scriptures like Vivekachudamani or Astavakra Gita?
If there are learned and wise ones who are willing to discuss one or two
poems a day. It would immensely benefit novices like me. Some noble ones
might also consider commentary of shankara on Brahma sutras or Bhagavadgitas
for daily discussion.

I beg you to forgive me for my impertinence.

Saikrishna
