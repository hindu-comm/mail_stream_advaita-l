If discussions on purANa-s, itihAsa-s are allowed why not the discuss the 
tAntrik rituals ?

praNAms Sri Satish Arigela prabhuji
Hare Krishna

smruti-s, purANa-s and itihasa-s have been considered as  pramANa 
granTha-s in the advaita vedAnta tradition.  So discussion on those texts 
in advaita list can be permissible to the extent.  ( anyway,  discussions 
will not be entertained if it is based on bigoted interpretation of some 
vaishNava cult).  Whereas tAntrik rituals and text book on these rituals 
have not been considered as pramANa for the advaita vedAnta  discussion. 

Hope moderators of this list would educate us further on the 'grantha-s' & 
topics that can be discussed in this list.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
