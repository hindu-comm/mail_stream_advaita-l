Namaste,

I am interested in the compound kRishNa-sakha, as in appears in
shriimad-bhaagavataM. It is applied a couple of times to Arjuna
('friend of Krishna'), but it is applied to Lord KRishNa as well. The
notable places are in kunti-stuti (the source of my query), but it
seems that the compound is used in 12th chapter as well. Here are the
references:

===============

In both the above translations, the above linked English translator
has interpreted the compound as 'friend of Arjuna'. But, Arjuna
etymologically means 'white' and perhaps 'friend (meaning saviour) of
draupadi' may be another valid interpretation as she too is called
kRishNa.

Can one who has access to traditional commentaries (notably by
Sridhara Swami) please explain how the above compound has been applied
to Krishna?
