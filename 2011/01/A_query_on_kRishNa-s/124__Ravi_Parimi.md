Posting the derivation here just for the sake of completness

अलौकिकविग्रहवाक्यम् is राजन् ङस् सखि सुँ
1. राजन् सखि - सुपो धातुप्रातिपदिकयोः causes सुब्लुक्
2. राजन् सखि टच् - राजाहःसखिभ्यष्टच् the प्रत्ययः टच् is added to the
above समासान्तः
3. राजसख - यस्तेति च gives टिलोपः (इ in सखि takes लोपः) and the न्
drops due to नलोपः प्रातिपदिकान्तस्य
4. By परवल्लिङ्गं द्वन्द्वतत्पुरुषयोः राजसख should be treated as
अकारन्तः पुँल्लिङ्गः and can be declined like रामशब्दः
