Certainly.  But why do you think there is always neccessarily one 
conclusion?

It has been my observation that we have two kinds of distortion of Dharma 
today.  One is to think that "anything goes" if you wrap it up in enough 
mystical mumbo-jumbo.  The other is to deny the genuine amount of 
pluralism that exists within the Vedic tradition.  Both are equally bad.

Why only this forum?  As the quotations from Jayadeva or Vishwanath Tarka 
Panchanana or Manu (I'm going to post my translation of His other shlokas 
on this subject tomorrow) show, there were a diversity of views 
even in ancient times.

Again if multiple views were given it is because there have indeed 
traditionally been multiple views.  (Though I think there is more 
commonality than you give credit too.)  It is upto you, the individual 
sadhaka, to judge between the different views.  No one can dictate an 
answer to you.

I think you are right about the limitations of Internet forums and that's 
why I have always said that advaita-l is an adjunct to serious sadhana it 
is not a replacement for it.  One of the ways it can help is in providing 
those methodical interpretations and I believe it was done in the subject 
at the hand.  But you appear to be looking for a definitive conclusion and 
that is not necessarily going to happen even after several months not due 
to obfuscation and obstruction but simply due to the difficulty of the 
problem.

In the end you have to do what is right for you so I'll not argue any 
further.  Good luck.
