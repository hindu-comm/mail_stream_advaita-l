With reference to the above topic,Sri Shankara Bhagawathpada says the word 
Ishwara is synonymous with Brahman,the ultimate.Again and again he stresses on 
this point in his Bhashyas.He implies that,when there is Jiva bhava,then there 
is Ishwara with maya as the prakrthi and Jiva bhava with avidya.But,in the 
Noumenon,there is only Brahman.

 N.Srikanta.
