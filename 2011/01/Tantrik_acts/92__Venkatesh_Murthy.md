There are many temples with erotic sculptures from Kama Sutra.  The
temples were used for entertainment also not only for religious
activities. In some books  sculptures are advertisements of Devadasis
in temples

Kindly give the reference where Adi Sankara has written against
Tantric rituals. There is a incident in Sankara Digvijaya on the
meeting with Ugra Bhairava.  But where is he talking against Tantras?
