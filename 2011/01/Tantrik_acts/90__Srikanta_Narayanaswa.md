With reference to the discussion of the above topic,there are certain Tantrik 
acts which are mentioned,to say the least "despicable".These 'Tantrik acts"might 
have been practiced by the so called "Tantriks"in the olden days.This is called 
"Vamachara Marga"or the "Kaula Marga".When I visited the famous Lord Jagannath 
temple in Puri,Orissa,I saw some of the erotic sculptures which illustrate the 
'Tantrik"acts
which were prevalent in the 11th-12 th century AD.This temple is said to have 
been built by Chodagangadeva in the 12 th century.There is a Goddess called 
Nirmala devi,to whom the worship is done by Tantrik rites.In one day of the 
Navarathri,the Goddess is offered food in the form of cooked fish.
It is said that in this temple,all the five Tantrik rituals like 
Madhya,mamsa,matsya,madira and maithuna were practiced.It is said that the 
madira was offered instead of tirtha in the olden days.There are only charlatans 
who masquerade in the name of Tantriks,Sri.Shankara Bhagawathpada strived hard 
to stop these Tantrik rituals.In his Bhashya on the Soundaryalahari he says that 
these rituals are "Veda bahira",which is prohibited by the Vedas.
