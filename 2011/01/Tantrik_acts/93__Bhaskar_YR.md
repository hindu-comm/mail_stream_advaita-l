Kindly give the reference where Adi Sankara has written against
Tantric rituals.

Hare Krishna

In geeta bhAshya at two places shankara says doing pooja to vinAyaka & 
saptamAtruka-s etc. is tAmasa in nature...But this bhAshya vAkya is 
subject to further deliberation.  But one thing is clear from this is 
shankara objecting the tAmasa pUja...But deities worshipped or proficiated 
in this pUja paddhati is an issue for discussion.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar

PS :  We have discussed this issue some years back in this same list.
