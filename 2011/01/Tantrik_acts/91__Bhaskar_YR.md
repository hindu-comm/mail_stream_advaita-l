Sri.Shankara Bhagawathpada strived hard 
to stop these Tantrik rituals.In his Bhashya on the Soundaryalahari he 
says that 
these rituals are "Veda bahira",which is prohibited by the Vedas.

Hare Krishna

The soundarya lahari itself is in the name of shankara is it not??  I did 
not know that he has written bhAshya also on that!!??

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
