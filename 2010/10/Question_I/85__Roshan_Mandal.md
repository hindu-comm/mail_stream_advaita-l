Dear sirs/madams, 

I am new to the realm of Vedanta. I have studied the basics.But as a beginner, 
I have manyquestions. One of the most fundamental questions that I have is: 

Why should I believe the Adavaita Vedanta philosophy over any other 
philosophy/religion? What evidence does Advaita have to back up its claims? 


Grateful if you could answer my question as thorougly as possible.
Thank you.

Sincerely,
Abhyudaya Mandal

PS: 
My background -- I am 16 yrs old.Most of my Vendata "knowledge" consists of 
reading the Gospel of Ramakrishna, and Complete Works of Swami Vivekananda, and 
a few articles on the Divine Life Society site. (My knowledge is very limited). 
However, I have studied Christianity, especially, fundamentalist evangelical 
Christianity for several years formally (My school has mandatory Bible courses).
