praNAms Sri Siva Senani prabhuji
Hare Krishna

The three nirISvaramatas are sA~Nkhya, yoga and mImAmsA (pUrvamImAmsA) set 
about answering 
the fundamental questions that confront a philosopher and when they found 
that they can be answered quite satisfactorily without introducing an 
ISvara, they let that be. 

>  AFAMKG, sAnkhya-s are called nirISvaravAdins, though philosophical 
thought position of yOga school is on par with sAnkhya, the yOga school 
admits the existence of Ishwara and they are NOT nirISvaravAdins, hence, 
sometimes they have been called as 'seshvaravAdins'. 

>  And to the question why ONLY advaita??  It is because, the advaita 
vedAnta,  as a school of thought which explains the ultimate truth 
strictly considering all the aspects of shruti (scriptures), yukti (logic) 
and anubhava (experience) and it assures us the realization of that truth 
here, in this very life, whereas other darshana-s talks about this state 
as lokAntara, janmAntara or kAlAntara jnAna.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
