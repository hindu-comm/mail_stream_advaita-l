Though unsure as to what exactly you have in mind, these statements are usually 
made when there is no correct understanding of Indian History.
Such statements are usually a consequence of mistaking the smR^iti-s for 
historical documents.
smR^iti is what some people considered ideal. It is not a record of what people 
or societydid.

Also unsure of a "stricter system to impart brahma vidya": When one tries to 
impart brahma-vidya to one who does not qualify, it is like talking to a wall. 
Hence there is noeasy or lenient way(compared to a stricter way)of imparting 
brahmavidya.
