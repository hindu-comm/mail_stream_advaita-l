Hari OM, Srikanta ji,

It is not incorrect because earlier Sankhya had no concept of Ishvara
and the same goes for Mimamsa. The later addition to Sankhya is an
influence of Yoga, where Ishvara praNidhAna is not a limb/ anga of
aShTAnga yoga but one_of_the_ways to attain samAdhi. In any case, I
didn't say no orthodox systems talk of God, but 'not all' talk of God.
Orthodoxy has to do with belief in the Vedas, not the concept of
God.

praNAm,
--Praveen R. Bhat
