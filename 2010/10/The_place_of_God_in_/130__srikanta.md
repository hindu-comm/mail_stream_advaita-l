Factually, not even all the six systems of orthodox Indian
philosophies talk of God, let alone Buddhism or Jainism.

This is incorrect.Infact Sankya,Nyaya,vedanta,Yoga speaks of God.Sankya
which was founded by Kapila,places Narayana as the God,so
also,Vedanta.Pathanjali, the founder of Yoga system has Ishwara Pranidana
as one of the limbs of Ashtangayoga.Nyaya has Shiva or Ishwara as the
Lord.Vaisheshika by Kanada is called "Ardhavainashika"by
shankara.Gaudapada
the foremost authority on Vedanta,in his IV th Prakarana of the Mandukya
Upanishad Karikas uses the word,Bhagavan in three karikas of the "Alatha
Shanti"prakarana.The Vyakarana shksha of Panini has Shiva as the God.The
Vedanta which closely follows Sankya system has Narayana as the God
head.Gaudapada who did penance in the Badarikashrama had the blessings of
Lord Narayana to compose his karikas.Gaudapada has also written a primer
on Sankya system,on Snkya karikas of Ishwarakrishna.Vedanta or Adwaita is
"Saishwaravada".The Mimamsa system places Karma as the deciding factor.
