Dear Sri Venkatesh,

You might be right - one might be right - in saying that it is possible only by an intelligent mind to understand Advaita, depending on what you mean by 'intelligence' and 'understanding'. 

May be you meant  by  'intelligence', the Buddhi, & meant  appreciation by understanding... and therefore  you are right in that
claim. 

But still, there is a dosha.  You seem to proceed as if it established by you, beyond all possibility of any doubt that only brahnanas can hope to have that kind of Buddhi and the right  appreciation of Advaita!! 

We, some of us, question this premise that you not only  have taken  for granted but also seem to be unaware that it needs to be established. 

Sir, pause, take the trouble to establish your premise before you expect any force of truth in your 'conclusion'. 

Pranam

Subject: Re: [Advaita-l] Did Sankara have non-brahmin disciples?

Sankara Digvijaya says the low born hunter of Manisha Panchakam was
God Siva not a man. Siva appeared immediately. Adi Sankara bowed to
Siva. Bad people say Adi Sankara accepted Candala as Guru but it is
bogus.  He did not have non Brahmin Guru or disciples.

Fact- Sankara Digvijaya does not say Adi Sankara bowed to Candala.

Arjuna fought with hunter but the hunter was Siva. He gave him
Pashupata.  No one says Arjuna lost in battle to a hunter. Why people
say Adi Sankara bowed to Candala? This is  politics and lies in a bad
way.

Regards

-Venkatesh
