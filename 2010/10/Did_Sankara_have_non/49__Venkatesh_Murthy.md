Sankara Digvijaya says the low born hunter of Manisha Panchakam was
God Siva not a man. Siva appeared immediately. Adi Sankara bowed to
Siva. Bad people say Adi Sankara accepted Candala as Guru but it is
bogus.  He did not have non Brahmin Guru or disciples.

Fact- Sankara Digvijaya does not say Adi Sankara bowed to Candala.

Arjuna fought with hunter but the hunter was Siva. He gave him
Pashupata.  No one says Arjuna lost in battle to a hunter. Why people
say Adi Sankara bowed to Candala? This is  politics and lies in a bad
way.
