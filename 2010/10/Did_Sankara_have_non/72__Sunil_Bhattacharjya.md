There is a general disdain towards the Vamatantra, without the awareness that there are different types (or shall I call it levels) of Vama tantra. Though not speciifically divided into different categories the highest type of Vamatantra is probably seen in the Mahanirvana Tantra, where the tantric partner must be one's own spouse. The matsya and mansa etc. are also substituted by fakes. It may be interesting to know that there are some Buddhist restaurants in USA, where they serve the fake meat etc. and one cannot tell the difference.

Radhe Krishna

Shriman Satish Arigela, Radhe krishna

I recollect having read in the soundaryalahari tamizh commentary of kadalangudi natesa sastrigal that although it is nisheda for traivarnikas, it is unfortunate that even some brahmanas take deeksha in tantra vidya. Ofcourse if I remember correctly he refers to mathysa madhu maamsa maitunadiyukta vamatantra.

So, in the first place is there any nisheda for brahamans taking diksha in tantra vidya considering above reference of kadalangudi natesa sasthrinaH?

Radhe Krishna
