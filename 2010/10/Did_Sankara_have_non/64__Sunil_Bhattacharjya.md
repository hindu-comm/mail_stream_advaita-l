Any reference? It could also be some invention to make Vedavyasa acceptable to some overcritical brahmins, who not like to see Vedavyasa born of a non-dvija lady.

Sri Gurubhyon Namaha
 I dont recall the name of the king, when he 
went for hunting, he was reminded of his queen in heat and that caused retas 
skalanam, since he did not want to waste it and also since it came because of 
his dharma baddha kama he wrapped the retas in a leaf and gave it to his eagle 
to carry it to his queen, on the way another bird thought that the kings bird 
was carrying meat and attacked it durin the process it fell into the river, the 
fish saw this leaf that had the retas, mistook it to be food and had it and that 
caused her to conceive and in due course she gave birth to a girl and boy. Since 
she came out of the fish she was called matsyagandhi till she met parashara 
maharishi.\

Sri Kamakshi
Raghav

She was helping people cross the Ganga in her boat while her Kaivarta (boatman) 
parents (or were they foster parents?) were in home. When Parashara rishi met 
her he wanted to marry her and then he sought the permission of her guardians 
for the same. That is how she married the Brahmana. Hope someone of us will 
please give us the information on her being born of kshatriya parents.

Sri Gurubhyon Namaha
 Devi bhagavata has a reference to how 
satyavati was born of fish, and human

Any reference to the verse(s) showing that Satyavati or Matsyagandha was 
Kshatriya raised by the Kaivartas.

Pranam to all:

Several points:

1.It is shastrically acceptable for Adi Shankara to have non-Braahmana 
disciples.
2.What matters is if veda-adhikara was transgressed, which Adi Shankara would 
not do.
3.Kanchi Paramacharya in Voice of God mentions that a jnani has equal vision for 

all but does not equate to "equal functions of varnas or social equality".
4.With regards to point 3 however, shastrically can a Braahmana be a spiritual 
disciple or take mantra deeksha, etc from a Non-Braahmana grihastha or sanyasi ?
5.As mentioned many times before, the process of niyoga involves the progeny 
belonging to the maternal caste. Hnece Vidura was a Shudra, Pandavas were 
Kshatriya, etc. Niyoga is nishedha in Kali Yuga.
6.Veda Vyasa's father was a Braahmana: Parashara and mother Satyavati (Kshatriya 

raised by fisherman); hence a Braahmana (anuloma union, with mother being one 
varna below father, among dvijas results in progeny belonging to the father's 
varna).
