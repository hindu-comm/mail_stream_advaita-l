Radhe Krishna

Shriman Satish Arigela, Radhe krishna

I recollect having read in the soundaryalahari tamizh commentary of kadalangudi natesa sastrigal that although it is nisheda for traivarnikas, it is unfortunate that even some brahmanas take deeksha in tantra vidya.  Ofcourse if I remember correctly he refers to mathysa madhu maamsa maitunadiyukta vamatantra.

So, in the first place is there any nisheda for brahamans taking diksha in tantra vidya considering above reference of kadalangudi natesa sasthrinaH?

Radhe Krishna
