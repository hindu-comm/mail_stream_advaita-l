First: tantra vidyA is not equal to rituals using meat fish liqour etc. Only 
one section of tAntrIka-s use it.

A brAhmaNa when he takes upa puretAntrika dIkSha like for exampleshrIvidyA, 
he refrains from using any forbidden materials like those you mentioned.

I am unaware of the existence of any rule saying a brAhmaNa should not take 
tAntrika dIkSha. Those statements where a niSheda is mentioned refer to rituals 
which involve forbidden items.
