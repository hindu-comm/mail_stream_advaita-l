In his Gita commentary, Sankaracharya says that previous commentators have
commented on every sentence and word but the meaning is not clear to lay
people. And that he is writing this to make it clear and that this message
would spread. Did he teach advaita to non-brahmins and accept them as
disciples? In Manisha Panchakam, he accepts as guru a low born jnani but
dont know if scholars accept that this incident took place at all.
