I can appreciate your sentiments expressed below, but I would first distinguish between
those who study advaita vedAnta as an academic exercise and those who study advaita
vedAnta as a personal spiritual and religious pursuit. It is indeed possible for one person
to do both, but for most people, it is one or the other. Those who research and publish
need to treat the history, system and thought of advaita vedAnta as an object of study 
like any other, e.g. economics or sociology or anthropology or whatever else. Those who
want to evolve spiritually through their study of advaita vedAnta need to figure out how
to incorporate it into their daily lives as conditioned by the world they live and work in.

In that respect, I still maintain that it is an unanswerable question whether Sankara did
or did not have non-brAhmaNa disciples. We simply do not have the records to prove 
one way or the other. Given what we know of Indian social structure and history, it is
most likely that his disciples who wrote texts were born brAhmaNa. But it should not be
thought that Sankara was never a popular teacher. For instance, do we know whether
ten or fifty or hundred people in some village sat down to listen to a discourse on the
gItA given by Sankara? No, we don't. Conversely, would Sankara have excluded SUdra-s
from listening to one of his discourses on the gItA? For this hypothetical question, my
answer would be that he would not have prevented it, because he categorically affirms
that the itihAsa-purANa are meant for all four varNa-s. The further question then is, 
does listening to a discourse and being positively affected by it qualify as disciple-ship?
It depends on the situation and is primarily dicated by two individuals - the listener and
the one giving the discourse. In any case, becoming a disciple of a specific guru is not
a one-shot deal, except in the most exceptional case. The vast majority of students
need to go again and again to a guru.

As for the question, "are they allowed to learn?", why not look at the contemporary 
situation in a broader perspective? Swami Vivekananda and Swami Chinmayananda 
were both non-brAhmaNa by birth. This did not prevent society at large from giving
the Swami title to them and it did not prevent the most orthodox of the 20th century
Sankaracharya-s from acknowledging them and their institutions. Now, what were
the personal, social, religious and philosophical factors that allowed Narendra Dutta
to become Swami Vivekananda and Balakrishnan Menon to become a Swami
Chinmayananda? Why don't we look at these sorts of specific instances and draw our
lessons from them? And what is it that keeps the vast majority of Sharmas and
Tripathis and Iyers and Joshis from graduating to Swami status? I agree that history
may not be always indeterminate, but I believe recent history is easier to discern
and determine than a past that was already only a dim and distant memory to our
great-grandmothers.

Regards,
Vidyasankar
