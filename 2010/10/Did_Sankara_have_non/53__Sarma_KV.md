Sankara digvijaya clearly says that the "chanDaala" was Siva Himself.
(Sankara sees Siva everywhere, as a matter of fact.)

However, if we confine to the question of whether Sankara had disciples
among non-brahmins... we need to first think of what "disciple' means. If it
means the ochre-robed samnyaasi-s, there are less chances that there were
non-brahmins among them. Because, Sanakara didn't give samnyaasa ASrama
deeksha to whoever comes without establishing arhata (the way Budhdhism did
and added another reason to its own fundamental flaws, leading to its
downfall.)
If we think of disciple as someone who "follows" the advise/instruction, it
is more likely that the disciples include non-brahmins. And the teachings
are 'for each his own.' For example "bhaja gOvindam" is not reserved for
only brahmins.

I am eager to see what Sankara-digvijaya says on this, if at all.
