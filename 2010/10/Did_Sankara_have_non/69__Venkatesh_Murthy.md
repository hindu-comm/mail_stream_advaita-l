The Gita verse is not relevant above. Brahman is everywhere in a cow
elephant a dog. Should we bow to a dog as a Guru? This type of logic
is wrong. The Jnani will see Brahman everywhere but will he say every
one is his Guru?

Kindly read Sri V Subrahmanian's article . A non Brahmin Guru is
against the scriptures. A brahmin must not learn from him leave alone
Candala.  Manu says a Brahmin can learn from Abrahmana Guru in
exception situations only. Saying a Swami does not have caste is
bogus. If this is true why Swamijis are not willing to crossing oceans
and visit USA? There are rules and regulations for Swamijis also not
only for Gruhasthas. A Brahmin only can claim title of Guru.

The Candala event is for conveying the message Siva wanted to test Adi
Sankara in hunter's disguise like how he tested Arjuna. From the
hunter event in Mahabharata it is wrong to say a Vyadha must be
treated like a great Kshatriya. The hunter event shows greatness of
Siva and Arjuna. Same case the Candala event shows greatness of Siva
and Adi Sankara.
