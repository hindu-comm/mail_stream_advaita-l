Hari OM, Satish ji,

I've already answered this when I said "Orthodox systems believe in
the same thing but the span is *not* restricted to this life, its
spread across lives, which an average human being cannot see. The
present life is a result of such acquisition
across past lives and hence the birth in a particular caste in this
life, defining the eligibility."

Either you conveniently ignored it or you misunderstood it. The word
*acquisition* is a loaded word which means both merits and demerits
acquired in previous lives, which includes education, experience,
intelligence, etc. I wonder if you are aware
of karma theory at all? Without learning that, your stand that I
presented a flawed reasoning is meaningless.

Kind rgds,
--Praveen R. Bhat

You cannot become a doctor unless you have MBBS; merely taking birth in a family of doctors isn't enough. But in caste system, even a crook is a Brahmin provided he is born to Brahmins. A good person is a non-Brahmin if he's born to non-Brahmin.
