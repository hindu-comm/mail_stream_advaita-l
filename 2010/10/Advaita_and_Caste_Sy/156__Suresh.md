Dear Praveen,

Thanks for your reply.

I have a problem with the following statement of yours:

"modern thinking
suggests that the eligibility of a person to do anything is to be
based on the education, experience and level of intelligence he
acquired. Does anyone question this and if not, why not call all equal
and fight that out?"

Your reasoning is flawed because in this case, eligibility is determined by education and NOT by birth. You cannot become a doctor unless you have MBBS; merely taking birth in a family of doctors isn't enough. But in caste system, even a crook is a Brahmin provided he is born to Brahmins. A good person is a non-Brahmin if he's born to non-Brahmin. 

As you can see, there is no consideration of experience, education, intelligence, or virtues - birth alone seems to be the criterion. And that's racist.
