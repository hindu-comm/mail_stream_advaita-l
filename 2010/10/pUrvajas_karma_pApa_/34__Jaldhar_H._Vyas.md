Satya Pir does not seem to have been an actual person.  Sunil have you 
heard of "satyapirer panchali"?  It is supposedly a Bengali poem telling 
the story of Satya Pir/Satyanarayana.  I would like to know if it has any 
relation to the Satyanarayana katha from the Skanda Purana.  I have seen a 
few suggestions that it does but as I don't understand Bengali I can't 
really tell.  These sources have a little information

but they do not seem to be all that reliable.
