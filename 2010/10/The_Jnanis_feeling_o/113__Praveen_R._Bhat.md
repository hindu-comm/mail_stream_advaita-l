Hope you're feeling better. I too was away to Rishikesh till today and
hence the delay in response. I personally feel that we tend to run
around in circles and therefore I'll try to limit the length of
response. I can't help but be repetitive too even in this
intended short response.

If the jnAni is in brahmabhAva, how can he suffer? So its not jnAni's.
The BMI appears to be suffering as it would, when the ajnAni
'occupied' it.


So, if at all we are seeing the feeling &

This is where I differ. While you seem to make the superimposition of
dehAtma buddhi on the jnAni as a special case, its not so for me. I
think that such superimposition (by onlookers) was there even when the
jnAni was an ajnAni. So that
superimposition has not changed for the ajnAni. It has however changed
for the earlier ajnAni associating himself with the dehAtma buddhi,
who on the rise of jnAna has dropped that superimposition. The weeping
or anger continues its
momentum as it was, like the arrow shot yet to reach its destination.

If those are the only two options you have, I have no choice to make.
:) My pick is the third one that the same prArabdha that applied to
the BMI before the rise of jnAna applies on the rise of jnAna. The
change, however, is that the jnAni doesn't
bind himself to that BMI.

Yes.

If everything taking

The "use" of jnAna is *not* to have free-will and leaving it for
prArabdha to do what is deemed best. The freewill of controlling
prArabdhic flow is due to avidyA and thats what is binding.

As per

Yes

then jnAni

Not so. If the jnAni is not binding himself to any particular BMI, why
is he a victim of those?

His prArabdha may

If there is no control over it on jnAni's side, its improper to say
"prompt *him*", isn't it? The him which comes from ahaMkAra of myness
has gone with rise of jnAna, IMHO.

Kindly clarify your stand prabhuji. Anyway,

I don't think anything that I said means that the jnAni has vipareeta
pratyaya. In any case, I foresee a Q, then whose pratyaya is it, which
will make us both run in circles again. :)

To my understanding, that "newly acquired" jnAna has nothing to do
with his laukika behaviour, but the shuddhatA of chitta prior to rise
of jnAna defines the sthirata. Either way, the jnAni himself remains
free of associating with them.

There is no guarantee of what prArabdha does since it is an arrow shot
prior to anything happened in this lifetime of the jnAni.

I'm saying that he needs to take no help of jnAna for anything, all he
needs to do, so to say, is be with the jnAna and remain there. What
happens to the BMI is not his business at all, which he knows now and
didn't know earlier (to rise of jnAna) due to wrong superimposition of
his.

I don't think it means sampUrNa anywhere here. Else I'd have to think
that Sw. Vidyaranya endorsing vidvat samnyAsa is meaningless, which I
surely don't.

To my understanding, yes.

and jnAni sometimes behave & indulge in activities like

Bhaskar ji, if I agree to "jnAni behaves" the way you put it here,
you'll say that I'm contradicting myself from earlier stand. So I do
not agree that jnAni behaves but "the BMI that was associated with him
earlier behaves"...

Dont you think jnAni's life
> getting tuff because of this prArabdha:-))

... so obviously, no. :) Its us ajnAnis whose lives are tough because
we can't make head nor tail of the jnAni. So, I'll stop here with a
summary ahead.

> svarUpa??

BMI is attributed to because it was attributed to earlier. There is no
change in it from earlier stance by ajnAnis. I personally feel its
contradictory to say that jnAni's BMI is not his but only a
superimposition and in the same breath say that jnAni
can't have rAgAdi doshas. If its a superimposition, those rAgAdi
doshas are not his to talk of. But you seem to hold that if there are
rAgAdi doshas, he's not a jnAni. To this effect, you're also a scholar
to quote Shankara Bhagavatpada and prove
it. However, the contradiction seems to be there as is, at least for
mUDhAs like me. :) So instead, I understand that partial chitta
shuddhi existed when jnAna rose and therefore, anger, etc, may rise in
such a BMI post-jnAna. jnAni himself has no
binding to them. I think I'll stick to this stand unless jnAna shines
with Guru's immense grace which betters it. Thanks for your satsanga,
I reckon I've no more points beyond this summary.
