Pranam to all,

It was correctly mentioned that a bad person is not = Shudra and good person is not = Braahmana. A fallen individual (based on acts,deeds, etc) does not change their varna. Examples include: Ravana, Ajamila, Ashwatamma, Kamsa, etc. IMHO, also not following one's svadharma may not change one's varna as long as nitya-karmas and samskaras are performed. Many Rajputs over past couple of generations are into business as their palaces are now hotels.

As Kanchi Paramacharya mentioned, Dvija-Bandhu occurs when 3 consequetive generations have not chanted Gayatri Mantra and subsequent generations in that lineage cannot undergo upanyana.  Many Braahmanas are barely escape the tag of Bandhu nowadays, since they chant Gayatri during Sandhyavandana after upanayana and probably hardly ever again perform sandhyavandana.  Many Kshatriya and Vaishyas are Bandhus as they have even stopped upanayana for 3 generations now. I personally know some Rajputs and Gujarati Banias who are in this category.
