there any pramana in the Veda for niriswara vada? It is wrong to claim that
any one of the six systems including saankhya, denied Ishwara.

If you think any of the six systems denied Ishwara, please give me the Veda
pramana.

What do you mean by strictest tradition, what is Samskrit equivalent to this
term? and who said that there is the strictest tradition, stricter tradition
and strict tradition? Are these these three traditions within the shrotriya
tradition? Where is the Veda pramana for ochre robes??

Sir, the same acharya has told in His Bhajagovindam that there are even
folks who wear ochre robes 'udara nimittam'.. Gurupurnima is supposed to be
Vyasa purnima because Sri Vyasa Maharshi was Adi Guru and he was not a
sanyasi but a grhasta and was not known to wear ochre robes. Does your
strictest tradition eliminate Sri veda Vyasa? I know, this is what they
teach out there in Rshikesh, its a pity..

Sir, I beg to differ. Sri Bhagavatpada himself offered pranams to the
chandala and said he is indeed guru who taught him a very important import
of advaita. Did Sri Bhagavatpada violate his own norms that he laid down?

Many have attained Self Realization by the grace of Bhagavan Sri Ramana, by
no standards of tradition can one lose such a Guru if one does get the
bhagyam to be enveloped by His grace. Will you advise the contrary? Is
Bhagavan Ramana not a Guru?  What about the 24 gurus mentioned by Sri
Dattatreya? Do you acknowlede Dattatreya the Shrotriya, sir?

Bhagavan Ramana has not advised anybody to read prastAna trya. He did not
conduct classes, issue certificates or put any preposterous conditions for
mukti. He did not, nor did he pack off any of his disciples to these schools
or training centres run by the know-alls.  He did not even acknowledge this
kind of institutionalized guru-sishya mechanism. How many muktas have come
out of those groups that apotheosized reading of prastAna trya? Are you
aware of how many people got mukti by the Grace of Sri Bhagavan Ramana? Are
you not aware of the story of Veda khyata ? I can personally show you
atleast 25 people who took to PrastAna Trya promoters seriously, spent their
lifetime for it and not yet sure of their mukti. Reading PrastAna Trya is
neither necessary condition nor a sufficient condition for mukti. If this
statement is wrong, Sri Ramana is wrong.

Who is the Lion in your analogy? How does a Shrotriya use the lion and how
are others doomed to fail in using the lion? Where is the clue?
