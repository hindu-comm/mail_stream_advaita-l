Factually, not even all the six systems of orthodox Indian
philosophies talk of God, let alone Buddhism or Jainism.

Bhagavatpada, therefore, doesn't accept that such a servant separate
from That is free.

Bhagavatpada Shankaracharya mandates the Guru to be shrotriya, even if
not brahmaniShTA since the latter is a qualification that an aj~nAni
shiShya cannot recognize. The former is a must
within the tradition. In the strictest of the traditions, the Guru
will have to be necessarily a saMnyAsin. On a related note, I just
returned from Rishikesh and had the good fortune to visit an
ashram where prasthAna trayA, prakaraNa granthAs, etc, are taught in
the sampradAyik manner. There, even the student has to be a naiShTika
brahmacAri to study and is also required to
wear ochre!

I don't think soul chooses anything. The Atman is ever-free and
without any action. By saying that the soul chooses, its like saying
that the soul acts, which is not true, being sAkshi mAtra.

How will a true seeker seek a Guru if he has no opinion on advaita or
non-advaita philosophies? One has to know if the Guru is a shrotriya
as per advaitic tradition. Else he will not know a Guru
in the first place.

Its just one side of the coin. The j~nAna mArga, especially as sown by
Bhagavatpada Shankara, needs a deep study of prasthAna trayA and
prakaraNa granthAs, so one can resolve the
dvandva that a thinking mind has. Such study appears to be academic
but need not be so. Only if one has the shravaNa in some life can one
do proper manana. As Bhagavan Ramana says
the mind seeking itself is like a thief acting as police and this is a
pitfall that is avoided by right manana led by shAstra j~nAna. The
shAstra vAsana can drop only then, else its just the mind
fooling one as to leading on to spiritual seeking, but actually
wanting to survive its own nAsha.

Hence the need for a traditional Guru who uses the very tools of this
duality to prove the non-duality. This is akin to the dream lion which
can not only wake one into the reality of the world, but
also make him sweat and tremble in fear.
