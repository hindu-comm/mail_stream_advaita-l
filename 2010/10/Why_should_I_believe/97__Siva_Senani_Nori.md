Dear Sri Umashankar

Regarding whether sAÑkhya admits of God or godhead (whichever way you like) or 
not, I think you are confusing two things.

The first is what the followers of sAÑkhya say. They agree the VedaprAmANyatA 
but talk only about Prakriti and Purusha, but not ISvara. The second issue that 
you are talking about is the Advaitin's stance - on what the Veda says about 
God. Obviously, the way Advaitins interpret it, the Veda talks about an ISvara. 
Sri Praveen being a Vedantin cannot give proof about where the Veda says there 
is no ISvara. When saying that sAÑkhya does not talk of God, he is only 
reporting; why do you spring upon him and say show the proof? As far as proof is 
concerned, the boot is on the other foot. If somebody believes that sAÑkhya 
admits of God, it is for such a person to show the proof for it. Why do I say 
this? Because the traditional position is that sAÑkhya does not talk about God. 
If you want authorities for the traditional position, they can be provided. For 
instance, the website of Kanchi KamakoTi peeTham (my family is not a follower of 
this maTha, but I will accept what the achAryas of Kanchi say on this matter and 
otherwise respect the learned achAryas). The exact quote is "Likewise Sankhya 
too respects the authority of the Vedas and does not support belief in 
Isvara."The webpage is at http://www.kamakoti.org/hindudharma/part12/chap6.htm. 
Or take the SarvadarSanasangraha, Chapter 14 and the text after the 57th 
sAÑkhyAkArikA is quoted, starting with "yastu parameSvarah ...". Even more can 
be provided.

It is perfectly possible that all AchAryas after ISvarakrishNa were wrong in 
their understanding of sAÑKhya, but then it is upto the person who makes that 
claim to prove it.

Regards
N. Siva Senani

there any pramana in the Veda for niriswara vada? It is wrong to claim that
any one of the six systems including saankhya, denied Ishwara.

If you think any of the six systems denied Ishwara, please give me the Veda
pramana.

What do you mean by strictest tradition, what is Samskrit equivalent to this
term? and who said that there is the strictest tradition, stricter tradition
and strict tradition? Are these these three traditions within the shrotriya
tradition? Where is the Veda pramana for ochre robes??

Sir, the same acharya has told in His Bhajagovindam that there are even
folks who wear ochre robes 'udara nimittam'.. Gurupurnima is supposed to be
Vyasa purnima because Sri Vyasa Maharshi was Adi Guru and he was not a
sanyasi but a grhasta and was not known to wear ochre robes. Does your
strictest tradition eliminate Sri veda Vyasa? I know, this is what they
teach out there in Rshikesh, its a pity..

Sir, I beg to differ. Sri Bhagavatpada himself offered pranams to the
chandala and said he is indeed guru who taught him a very important import
of advaita. Did Sri Bhagavatpada violate his own norms that he laid down?

Many have attained Self Realization by the grace of Bhagavan Sri Ramana, by
no standards of tradition can one lose such a Guru if one does get the
bhagyam to be enveloped by His grace. Will you advise the contrary? Is
Bhagavan Ramana not a Guru?  What about the 24 gurus mentioned by Sri
Dattatreya? Do you acknowlede Dattatreya the Shrotriya, sir?

Bhagavan Ramana has not advised anybody to read prastAna trya. He did not
conduct classes, issue certificates or put any preposterous conditions for
mukti. He did not, nor did he pack off any of his disciples to these schools
or training centres run by the know-alls.  He did not even acknowledge this
kind of institutionalized guru-sishya mechanism. How many muktas have come
out of those groups that apotheosized reading of prastAna trya? Are you
aware of how many people got mukti by the Grace of Sri Bhagavan Ramana? Are
you not aware of the story of Veda khyata ? I can personally show you
atleast 25 people who took to PrastAna Trya promoters seriously, spent their
lifetime for it and not yet sure of their mukti. Reading PrastAna Trya is
neither necessary condition nor a sufficient condition for mukti. If this
statement is wrong, Sri Ramana is wrong.

Who is the Lion in your analogy? How does a Shrotriya use the lion and how
are others doomed to fail in using the lion? Where is the clue?
