PraNAms to all:

Shree Ram Chandran has provided the following links for audio recordings on Vedantic texts, for those who are interested. Although one can download the recording for free, a vedantic student has an obligation to offer something in return to the organization that is providing the service.

Would appreciate passing the info to others who may be interested.  

Hari Om!
