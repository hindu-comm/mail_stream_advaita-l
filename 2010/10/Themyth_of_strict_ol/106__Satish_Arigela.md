Last post on the topic and hopefully this one will be clear:

I see that it is the problem of definition.

What I mean is: If I impart for example the knowledge of probability to a 
student and the student cant even solve the most basic problem in the subject, 
then essentially I havent imparted anything.

Likewise a fomal initiation into brahmavidya does not do anything to the 
unqualified. By qualified I meant one who has gone the karma in addition to 
being ripe for instruction. I hope the statement "it can never be imparted to 
the unqualified" is clear now.

Please revisit the original post on the topic. There is a note about exceptions.

Those stories are good to hear but not useful to all. Theyinspire at one stage 
but hanging on to those stories forever does no good.
