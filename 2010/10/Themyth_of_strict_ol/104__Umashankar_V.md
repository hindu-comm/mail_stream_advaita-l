Sri Sadananda ji,

You hit the nail on the head sir!

I was only trying to bring out the fact that one potantially gets distracted
over the trivialities and nitty gritties of 'essentials'.  This itself
becomes a pitfall and hooks the mind on to unnecessary pursuits than simple
straight bhakti and natural sontaneous state of chitta shuddhi.

Your words -*  "** In essence the problem is lack of chitta suddhi required
for knowledge. All other qualifications required or assumed or imposed are
all to have this chitta suddhi. They do not guarantee the chitta suddhi
although they help to acquire those with the grace of teacher and the Lord."
*

Yes, if at all one can say there is a criteria, it IS Chitta Shuddhi.

Also, one with Chitta Shuddhi is so spontaneously in a natural soulful state
that such a person is almost a mukta.

Bhagavan Sri Ramana Maharshi in his Upadesa Saram says:

*"Ishwaraarpitam Nechhayaakrtam *
*Chitta Shodhakam Mukti Saadakam"*

Chitta Shuddhi leads to Mukti... no doubt.  It is upto us to call that as *
the* state closer to mukti or the state which upon one's (so-called)
attainment, leads to mukti.

The word "qualification" I feel is too strong as its upto The Lord to give
by His Grace, even the state of Chitta Shuddhi to his devotee. No individual
upon his own effort ALONE can get this.

Again I am quoting Bhagavn Sri Ramana here:

*"Kartruraagnyaya Praapyate phalam*
*Karma Kim Param, Karma Thath Jadam"*

One should have the humility despite the right action and following of
shastras and schools of tradition, they have their due place and deserve all
the respect they command and have to be taken seriously, while it is MOST
important not to forget that it is His Grace that can give any 'phala'
whatsoever..

Sri Gurubhyo Namaha!
