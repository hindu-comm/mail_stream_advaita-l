Pranams!
In the ancient times the strict sampradaya(tradition) was followed before
imparting Brahmavidya.Both the sruthis and smrtis declare that one must
undergo the requisite qualifications of Upanayanam and the study of the
Vedas.The common path was Brahmacharya,Gruhastha,Vanaprastha and
sanyasa.In this one has to perform all the Karmas to qualify for the final
release.However a few like Sukha Maharshi,Ramana,Ramakrishna Paramahamsa
the path was straight to Sanyasa.For them it is held that they had all the
samskaras to qualify for the sainthood.For them, Bhagawadgita says:Naiva
tasya Kretanarthah!There is nothing for him to achieve.These questions and
doubts have come to us because we have not gone through the
traditional(sampradayic)study of the vedas and the sruthis and smritis.For
a traditional Shrotriya these questions will not arise.
Bhava Shankara Desika me Sharanam.                     N.Srikanta.
