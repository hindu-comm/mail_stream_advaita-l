OM shrii gurubhyo namaH
Namaste,

We continue with the series.

62. akaaryatvaachcha niHshreyasasya karmasaadhanatvaanupapattiH | na

##[... The highest good cannot be attained through mere actions, nor
by a combination of Knowledge and action. Besides,] since Liberation
is not a product, thefore it is illogical that it should have action
as its means. Indeed, an eternal entity cannot be produced by either
action or Knowledge.##


63. na karmaNo.asti niHshreyasasaadhanatvam.h | na cha j~naanakarmaNoH
samuchchitayoH | naapi j~naanasya kaivalyaphalasya

niHshreyasasaadhanam.h iti || 18.66 ||


##Action does not constitute the means to the highest good. Nor do
Knowledge and action in combination. Further, Knowledge which has
Liberation as its result can have no dependence on the assistance of
action, because, being the remover of ignorance, it is opposed (to
action). Verily, darkness cannot be dispeller of darkness. Therefore,
Knowledge alone is the means to the highest good.##


64. avihitamapratishhiddhaM cha karma tatkaalaphalam.h\, na tu
shaastrachoditaM pratishhiddhaM vaa tatkaalaphalaM bhavet.h || 18.66

##Actions which have not been enjoined or prohibited (by the
scriptures) produce immediate results. But those enjoined or
prohibited by the scriptures do not produce immediate results.##

(To be continued.)
