##Just as for knowing one's own body there is no need for any other
(external) means of knowledge, so also there is no need of any other
means of knowledge for the realization of the Self which is innermost
(in relation to the body etc.)##

##dhyaana-yoga-parah -- nityam (ever) is used to indicate the absence
of other duties like repetition of mantra (A formula of prayer sacred
to any diety) etc.##

##[Besides, Liberation consists in being established in the changeless
real nature of the indwelling Self. Indeed, ] it is not possible that
one who wants to go to the eastern sea and the other who wants to go
in the opposite direction to the western sea can have the same course!

And steadfastness in Knowledge consists in being totally absorbed in
maintaining a current of thought with regard to the indwelling Self.
And that is opposed to coexistence with duties, like going to western
sea. It has been the conclusion of those versed in the valid means of
knowledge that the difference between them is as wide as that between
a mountain and a mustard seed.##
