On this list, there was a very long discussion about the "kingpin" 
amongst PramANas - with the disciples of SSS giving that status to 
anubhava, and 
with others including myself saying if there is any kingpin amongst 
pramANas, 
that is Sruti.

Hare Krishna

I donot want to relight  this issue once again...But point to be noted 
here is Sri SSS never ever advocated 'anubhava' as an alternative to 
shruti pramANa.  Sri SSS goes by shankara's own words and says for dharma 
jignAsa shruti/shabda is the ONLY pramANa, whereas in brahma jignAsa 
shruti as well as experience ( a rough translation of the word  'anubhava) 
 both are valid pramANa-s. 

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!
