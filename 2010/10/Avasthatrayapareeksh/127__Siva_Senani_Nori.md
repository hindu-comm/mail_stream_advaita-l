Sir

For the record, I am a Vaidiki (of Velanadu :-)), in terms of going by Sruti 
PramANa. On this list, there was a very long discussion about the "kingpin" 
amongst PramANas - with the disciples of SSS giving that status to anubhava, and 
with others including myself saying if there is any kingpin amongst pramANas, 
that is Sruti.

When Sri Mandal posed the question "how do you know Advaita is the best", my 
personal answer would be because the Vedas say so; for the benefit of those who 
have a difficulty in accepting the word of Veda as sufficient proof, I pointed 
out that avasthAtrayaparIkshA is one way in which you can arrive at the same 
conclusion by way of reasoning. This is not to say that this prakarANa has 
nothing to do with Veda, or that it is independent of Vedas. The point is: 
though it is taught by the Vedas, it does not require any belief in 
the infallibility of Vedas; in other words even if an individual or some other 
religion were to propose the same thing, a person with an open mind would come 
to the same conclusion (that there is a fourth state, that it is Brahman - or 
Chunky as one IIT, Madras scholar put sometime back on this list - and that it 
is the same as the self). 

Finally, I have indeed studied the Mandukya Upanishad along with the kArikAs and 
posted some time back on this list on an obscure aspect of the kArikAs here 
(http://www.advaita-vedanta.org/archives/advaita-l/2007-June/018987.html) in 
response to a query from Sri Guy Werlings.

Regards
N. Siva Senani

Subject: [Advaita-l] Avasthatrayapareeksha














I think this misunderstands the intention of Sri Siva Senani Nori, the
poster who wrote
about this. What was intended is that anyone who sleeps, dreams and wakes
up can
sit and examine this process logically, without any prior exposure to the
Vedas or even
without any SraddhA in the veda.

Whether such an independent analysis will be consonant with or converge
with the
avasthAtraya parIkshA taught in the veda is a different question.

Vidyasankar
_________________________________

It is absolutely not possible to examine the three avasthas logically if
one doesnot understand the Mandukya Upanishad and the Gaudapada
Karikas,which are based on the vedas.The Mandukya Upanishad is in
Atharvana veda.The jagrath,svapna and the susupti states donot have a
sequence as we really see and believe.This is explained in the IInd
prakarana which is called "Vaithathya prakarana".In all the three
states,the sakshi or the witness remains unchanged.One who has not exposed
to the Mandukya Upanishad and the Karikas will never come to the purport
of the Mandukya Upanishad.He will just wakeup,dreams and go to deep sleep
without this analysis.In the deep sleep state the concept "Ishwara"is
brought synonymous with "Prajna"(na antah prajnah,na bahishpajnah,na
ubhayataprajnah)this the source of every thing.The Upanishad goes further
to introducethe IV th  state called the "Turiya".Will an independent
analysis be able to do so meticulously as the Upanishad?.There is no other
Gaudapada to do this.
Bhava Shankara Desika me sharanam.                    N.Srikanta
