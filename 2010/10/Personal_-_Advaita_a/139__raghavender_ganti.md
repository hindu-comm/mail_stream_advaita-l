Sri Gurubhyon Namaha
 Dear Venkatesh ji
 "Purusha 
Sukta says Brahmano Asya Mukham Asit Brahmins are the mouth of Purusha. They are 
excellent Varna. They are the best", though this statement is right this is not 
a basis for saying brahmins are best. Every varna is dependent on the other, 
people when they pray to a murthi they pray to the feet not to the face or 
mouth. So in essential you are thanking the gods creation of 4th varna without 
whombrahmins or the other 2 varnas cant get going in any of their daily 
activities. Similar is the case with the other 2 varnas. Brahmins are the best 
only when they adhere to the path laid out in the shastras, failing which he can 
be called a brahmana bandhu, he ceases to be called a brahmin.

Sri Kamakshi
Raghav

Subject: Re: [Advaita-l] Personal - Advaita and Caste System

To Sri Suresh:

Krishna has said Chaturvarnyam Maya Srushtam in the Gita. Foolish
people think Brahmins and others created Varna caste system for their
own benefit. It is wrong. Caste system is not man made but it is
natural . It was there in the beginning.

Purusha Sukta says Brahmano Asya Mukham Asit Brahmins are the mouth of
Purusha. They are excellent Varna. They are the best.

You will never find Sastra statement to approve all Varnas are equal
like what modernists say.

Advaita is Upanishad Sastra part of the Vedas. Only Dvijas can study
it. What is wrong in this ? Even in Brihadaranyaka Upanishad Brahmins
only are praised. Take 1 4.11 or 1 4.15 and read with Adi Sankara's
commentary. 1 4.15 is clear people wish to obtain objective by
Brahmin birth only. Brahmin is like Agni in gods. This same Upanishad
says Aham Brahmasmi Mahavakya of Advaita. It is wrong to accept Aham
Brahmasmi and not accept top most position of Brahmins. Same Upanishad
says both. Brahmins are gods on earth they are called Bhudeva.

Regards

-Venkatesh
