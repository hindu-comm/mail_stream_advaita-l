To Sri Suresh:

Krishna has said Chaturvarnyam Maya Srushtam in the Gita. Foolish
people think Brahmins and others created Varna caste system for their
own benefit. It is wrong. Caste system is not man made but it is
natural . It was there in the beginning.

Purusha Sukta says Brahmano Asya Mukham Asit Brahmins are the mouth of
Purusha. They are excellent Varna. They are the best.

You will never find Sastra statement to approve all Varnas are equal
like what modernists say.

Advaita is Upanishad Sastra part of the Vedas. Only Dvijas  can study
it. What is wrong in this ? Even in Brihadaranyaka Upanishad Brahmins
only are praised. Take 1 4.11 or 1 4.15 and read  with Adi Sankara's
commentary. 1 4.15 is  clear people wish to obtain objective by
Brahmin birth only.  Brahmin is like Agni in gods. This same Upanishad
says Aham Brahmasmi  Mahavakya of Advaita. It is wrong to accept Aham
Brahmasmi and not accept top most position of Brahmins. Same Upanishad
says both. Brahmins are  gods on earth they are called Bhudeva.

Regards

-Venkatesh
