Pranams!
With reference to the above discussion,I donot see the link between
Adwaita and the caste system.Adwaita exists inspite of the caste
system.Just because Adwaita means non=duality,it doesnot mean Adwaita will
exist if the caste system is removed.On the other hand,Adwaita belongs to
a realm outside all these,it belongs to a different dimension where all
these imaginations of the mind do not touch.
