Shri Ramakrishna Paramhansa said that Advaita, Vishishtadvaita and Dvaita are correct at the levels they are meant for.

Please see the quotes from Sri Chandrasekhara Bharati Mahaswamigal
(Sringeri) regarding religion as posted in svbf.org under "Thought of the
day".There is no point in discussing whose religion is best or whose
concept within Hinduism is best (Advaita / Dvaita / Vishistadvaita) etc.,
As Ramana Maharishi advises us, don't discuss and worry about Advaita,
Dvaita etc., Practice self-enquiry and you will find the Truth by yourself.

Who are we to sit in judgement over other religious teachers and religions?
Waste not your precious life in judging others. Use it to regulate your life
and purify yourself.

No one on earth, howsoever powerful, has any right to compel the people to
change or break their religious laws. No one has the right to interfere in
the religious matters of another.

- Chandrasekhara Bharati Mahaswamigal -

*************

Here Swamigal clearly says that quarrels arise only if the person has
associated his conception of God to a particular name and form. As long as
we are restrict to a name and form the person doesn't understand God.

All religious conflicts and quarrels arise because a devotee is unable to
disassociate his conception of God from a particular name and form.

- Chandrasekhara Bharati Mahaswamigal -


Thought for the day
Tuesday, 5th October 2010

As long as, by a process of analysis, he does not learn to disassociate the
name from the thing, the name is the thing for him, and if you deny that
name, he will take it that you deny the thing itself. If you realise that
all Gods are one and all paths lead to God, you will never waste your
precious life in religious quarrels.

There must be perfect equality - each man to his religion - unmolested by
anybody and every facility guaranteed to him to practice his own religious
pursuit.

- Chandrasekhara Bharati Mahaswamigal -

Thought for the day
Monday, 27th September 2010

Every facility must be given for a Hindu to live the life of a Hindu, a
Muslim to live the life of a Muslim, a Christian the life of a Christian,
and so on.

- Chandrasekhara Bharati Mahaswamigal -


Thought for the day
Wednesday, 22nd September 2010

Conversions from one religion to another is neither advisable nor desirable.
The religion in which a man is born is the best fitted for his spiritual
upliftment. The Lord knows which religion is best for us and gives us birth
in a country, climate, time and faith for which we are best suited.

- Chandrasekhara Bharati Mahaswamigal -


Thought for the day
Friday, 24th September 2010

Similarly a seeker should apply his God given gifts on the stable background
of his God chosen faith. So a Hindu should try to become a better Hindu, a
Muslim a better Muslim, a Buddhist a better Buddhist and a Christian a
better Christian.

- Chandrasekhara Bharati Mahaswamigal -
