Can we also put it this way? Bhakti is the vehicle, which takes the Vibhakta to the Avibhakta. On reaching (or attaining) the Avibhakta, the vehicle Bhakti gets (or has to be) discarded. Clinging to the Bhakti any further will only keep the Vibhakta away from the Avibhakta and that probably happens to the Vishishtadvatin. Any comment.

I am pointing out the logical position, not an opinion. When all duality is transcended,
the distinction between bhakta and bhagavAn is also transcended, both for bhagavAn
and the erstwhile bhakta. This jnAna of non-duality is affirmed by bhagavAn directly -
Atmaiva me matam (gItA 7.18). There is a sense in which jnAna is the highest bhakti
and in this sense, the common-sense view of bhakti, which presupposed duality, is
clearly transcended. It is the inability to let go of the presupposition of duality that 
leads to a lot of confusion.

I grant that the saMnyAsi in advaita tradition is not an ordinary human being at
all. However, among the billions of human beings on earth, there are clearly at
least some extraordinary ones who live that ideal and they represent an ideal
that ordinary human beings can aspire to.

If you hold that the gOpI-s were extraordinary too and it is not for ordinary human
beings to behave like them, would you also hold that they represent an ideal that
one should aspire to?

You were talking of devotional "activities" and exempting such "activity" from what
needs to be renounced by the saMnyAsin, as opposed to the ritual activity that is
prescribed in the karma kANDa. This is what I object to. Please show us where SrI
madhusUdana sarasvatI exempts any kind of *activity*, devotional or otherwise,
from renunciation.

A thousand years ago, the strong "ritualists" held that ritual action should never
be renounced. In today's world, the strong "devotionalists" seem to hold that
devotional action should never be renounced. The answer in both cases is the
same - the rigorous advaita vedAntic stance on action and its renunciation that
was set out by Sankara bhagavatpAda.

My point is that if there is someone performing an action contrary to SAstra that
is explained in the SAstra, then you and I, as onlookers, need that SAstra first,
to understand what is what. And that SAstra has to be learned and understood
in its entirety, not by picking and choosing and privileging whatever is convenient
to one's own preconceptions.

There has been a lot of discussion on the list regarding vividishA saMnyAsa and
vidvat saMnyAsa - formal renunciation of action as a preparatory step towards
jnAna and the natural renunciation of action of the jnAnI. Mandatory observances
pertain to the former, not to the latter.
