Respected Vedantins,
Namaskarams.

I joined the list hoping it would be 'mananam' which it was for sometime. It was great to see sparkling insights into Advaita. A good time in focussing the mind inward, albeit slightly.

It is dismaying to see the protracted debate on caste continuing for so long. Would members kindly refocus on topics related to Brahman?

This is just a humble request.

Regards,
Vidyashankar Krishnan
