Atta Vedantin Subbu-ji.

It is quotes like this that make this group worth it. Not inane and sonorific discussions on caste and creed. After all, "na mrtyur na shankah na me jAti Bhedah pita naïve me naïve mAta na janma".

We want more ! We want more!

May I add:

Sri Paramarthananda Swamiji quoted:

In the Mandukyam (?) it is said of the prapancham - driShtathvAth - svapnavath. The universe is unreal because it is the "Seen", like a dream. This you have wonderfully elaborated.

Made for top notch reading! Thanks!
