Dear Vidyasankarji,

Karma is always important for the Dvaitins as they cannot shed the ego and therefore cannot lose their individual identity so necessary to be one with the Brahman. They may go near to their chosen deity as long as their good karma-phal permits and after the karma-phal expires they have to be born again. They cannot get away from the cycle of birth and death if they continue to think of karma and its fruit.

Regards,

Sunil K. Bhattacharjya

Sri Subrahmanian has already demonstrated why the padma purANa verses are
clear and deliberate misunderstandings of advaita. I must, however, along
with Sri Murali, question your motivations if you think that the gauDiya
vaishNavite's favorite verses attributed to the padma purANa are a correct
representation of the advaita position. You are looking only at the kernel
of the advaita position regarding karmA and its renunciation, forgetting
the pith of the matter. 

"Encouraging the ignorant alone to perform veda karmA" - everybody who is
born comes with ignorance. It follows that according to advaita, everybody
has to perform vaidika karmA, till the qualification for renunciation is
firm. karmA and jnAna cannot be combined, because one cannot renounce karmA
and still insist upon its performance. Those sampradAya-s that have a place
for saMnyAsa and still insist upon karmA have a deep rooted contradiction
internally, in their core.

On the other hand, in advaita vedAnta, there is a path from karmA to its
renunciation and if you don't see that this path is a valid vaidIka path,
you are gravely mistaken about what vaidIka really means. In this, you are
not alone, for this sort of misunderstanding and misrepresentation of the
advaita position (deliberate or otherwise) is common to many. But if that
is your preferred view, perhaps advaita-L is not the company you should keep.
