Namaskar to All

I happen to listen to the Mangala Stotra rendered by Dr Thiagarajan, Chennai. I would request the learned list members to provide some insight in to the source of this. I have given below the sloka as I heard and I might have misspelled the words too. I appreciate the correct words and the meaning.I do not have the sanskrit original and I have given below what I heard.
