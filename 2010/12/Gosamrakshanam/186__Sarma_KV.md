We "need not" call ourselves '*vegetarians*.' It is a western term. We have
our own Indian term, *saatvikaahaari* - one who lives on *saatvik* food.
(Cow) Milk is *saatvik* food.

What you mentioned about the treatment meted out to cows is unfortunately
true. Instead of shunning milk, let us work with some great organizations
which are truly doing gO-sEva.
