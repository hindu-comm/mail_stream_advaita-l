In this connection, see the following article by Sri Satish Karandikar,
a resident of New Jersey, USA.

In a general sense, however, I would caution against blanket condemnation
of all such ventures as described above. The domestication of the cow was
historically meant only to serve human purposes, but in the contemporary,
highly industrialized society that we live in, we have moved away from 
all standards of humane treatment of cattle. If you live in a city and are
buying milk from a supermarket, yes, you are contributing to the cycle of
himsA. But there are quite a few projects around the world, which have
been designed to be sanctuaries for cows and other domesticated animals.
You could always make a conscious decision only to use milk obtained with
the least amount of himsA.

Vidyasankar
