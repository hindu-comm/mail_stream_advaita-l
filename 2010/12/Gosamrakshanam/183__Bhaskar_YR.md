Shankara bhagavatpAda says : vedO nitya madheeyatAM...chAndOgya says 
(donot know the reference) though one, who born in brAhmaNa kula is NOT 
brAhmaNa he is ONLY brAhmaNa bandhu if he does not follow the injunctions 
of veda-s.  and bruhadAraNyaka 1-4-10 talks about nitya karma that one has 
to follow...nApsu mUtra pureesham kuryAt, na nishTeevet, na vivasana 
snAyAt...in aruNa prashNa talks about some vidhi vidhAna one should 
observe...Likewise there is a shruti which says till death one should 
observe 'agnihOtrAdi' vedic rituals...Karma, karma yOga as a jnAna sAdhana 
or chitta shuddhi insisted by shankara at various places in his prasthAna 
trayi bhAshya.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
