May I add that In Mahayana when one gets out of the clutch of Prakriti (ieone sheds / leaves the body of the five skandhas ) one gets the state of Zero-Identity or Shunyata, where there is no individual identity and there is only awareness and no separateness. This means that though the individual identity is lost, a non-separate awareness remains. Shall I be wrong if I say that many see there some similarity between the Advaita and Buddhism.

Vedantins of any stripe including Advaitins refer to Brahman in positive terms as an entity that can be objectively known.  Or in other words, goal of oneness in Buddhism = emptyness.  Goal of oneness in Advaita Vedanta = fullness.  This is a vast difference that renders any other superficial similarities meaningless.
