Since I am also that "someone" who supported the stand, let me share
that I'm equally dismayed for the same reasons as stated by you for
bringing up the Padma Purana verse and arguments
in its favour. :)

If some one says,

This is an incorrect example to prove your case. When the second
sentence is a pronoun that refers to the earlier sentence, its clearly
a continuation of the person named earlier. Thats not how
it is in Padma Purana anyway. Its philosophically a very valid
argument to say that when the direct meaning is clear, an indirect
dependency from earlier quotations is not called for. Else the
argument violates law of parsimony.
