Dear Jaldharji,

Well put. May I add that In Mahayana when one gets out of the clutch of Prakriti (ieone sheds / leaves the body of the five skandhas ) one gets the state of Zero-Identity or Shunyata, where there is no individual identity and there is only awareness and no separateness. This means that though the individual identity is lost, a non-separate awareness remains. Shall I be wrong if I say that many see there some similarity between the Advaita and Buddhism.

Regards,

Sunil K.Bhattacharjya

It's also not entirely true. The Nirnaya Sagara edition of the Padma Purana which was published from Mumbai, does include those shlokas. However atleast in the copy I have, there is no critical apparatus so

Unfortunately, as we have seen in the recent election season here in the US, it is possible to selectively quote the truth and twist the meaning. One would hope Veda Vyasa held himself up to a higher standard than a politician.

This is the misunderstanding. Advaita Vedanta does not teach the renunciation of karma for all and sundry (surely you must have seen the many posts in this list about karmakanda?) rather it says karma has an effect only for the person who maintains I-consciousness. As a jnani no longer has this, karma is pointless for him but he can still advocate it for those who still have ahamkara. The Buddhists on the other hand simply do not believe the shastras have any effect. Not the same thing at all.

Similiarly, Advaita Vedanta teaches that what is called Jiva and Brahman are equivalent. Buddhism does not admit either exists at all. Totally different.

By the time the Madhvas and Gaudiyas flourished, Buddhism was dead in India. Their only knowledge of it was second-hand and while calling Advaita Vedanta pracchanna bauddha might have made sense to them, we who are better informed should not make that mistake.

...in the way they were formerly conceived. This is the part you are not getting. Jnana is not just a matter of extra knowledge but a fundamental shift in perspective. Many people will, for example, go to the ocean to watch the beautiful sunset over the waters. Now if you learn a little bit of astronomy, you know the sun does not actually set; in fact it is the earth which is orbitting the sun despite the contradiction of knowledge we receive from the senses. Can the astronomer not enjoy the sunset? Of course he can because the phenomenon remains the same, only the perspective of the observer, the interpretation he gives to that phenomenon has changed. This is what jnana is albeit on a grander scale.
