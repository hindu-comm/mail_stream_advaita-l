You shall.  The buddhists are resolutely agnostic about the nature of that 
awareness.  Vedantins of any stripe including Advaitins refer to Brahman 
in positive terms as an entity that can be objectively known.  Or in other 
words, goal of oneness in Buddhism = emptyness.  Goal of oneness in 
Advaita Vedanta = fullness.  This is a vast difference that renders any 
other superficial similarities meaningless.
