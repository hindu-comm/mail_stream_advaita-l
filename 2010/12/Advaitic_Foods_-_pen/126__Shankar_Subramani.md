LAWS OF MANU
PAGE 44 - II-75
Seated on blades of Kusa grass with their points to the east purified by blades of Kusa grass (pavitras) and santified by three supressions of the breath(pranayama) he is worthy to pronounce the syllable OM

PAGE 210 - VI-(VERSES 69-71)
69) In order to expiate (the death) of those creatures which he unintentionally injures by day or by night , an ascetic shall bathe and perform six supression of breath (pranayama)
70) Three supressions of breath(pranayama) even performed according to the rule and accompaniedwith the recitattion of the vyahritis and of the syllable OM one must know to be the highest form of austerity for every Brahmana
71) For as the impurities of mettalic ores melted in the blast of a furnace are consumed, 
even so the taints of the organs are destroyed through the supression of the breath(pranayama)

PAGE 471- XI-200
200)He who is bitten by a dog, a jackal, or a donkey, but a tame carnivorous animal, by a man, a horse, a camel, or a village pig becomes pure by supressing his breath (pranayama)

PAGE 472- XI-202
242) A brahmana who voluntarily rode in a carriage drawn by camels or asses and he who bathed naked becomes pure by supressing his breath ( pranayama)

PAGE 479- XI-249
249) Sixteen suppressions
of breath(pranayama) accompanied by the recitations of vyahritis and of the syllable OM purify if they are repeated daily after a month even the murderer of a learned brahmana

Genuinely request you to ask your bhrama nishta guru to further explain the tattva of this manu smirti teachings

This chapter XI -212 TO 247 
details of various types of penances are so profound it is indeed a glory as vivekchudamani verses state that if one is born a human with ichha on moksha gnanam and grace of gurugives adhikaritvam to grasp the teaching thenwhat more is needed

humbly
sukanya shankar

Dear Sri Sunil,

Great reply. Crisp and to the point.

The anecdote about the power of Rama nama is indeed very interesting. The
the real input to me is what Manu's endorsement of Pranayama for parihara.

Can you help me find out where exactly Manu had said these significant
words??
