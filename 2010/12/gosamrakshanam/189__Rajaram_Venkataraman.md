Venkatesh, I agree with you that protection of cows andd brahmins go hand in
hand. If we need to protect 50 cows, we need at least 10 acres of land and a
brahmin priest perform go puja. We will also need kshatriyas to provide the
land, vaishyas to trade in the dairy products and sudras to maintain the
cows.

If you or others are interested in the topic, I would be keen to know
specific references to cow protection in the Vedas and the works of
acharyas.
