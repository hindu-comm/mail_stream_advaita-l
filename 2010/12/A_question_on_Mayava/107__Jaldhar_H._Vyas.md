Sorry but what with the end of the year holidays I have fallen far behind 
in responding to emails and am just starting to catch up.

I find myself in the strange position of agreeing with your meaning but 
disagreeing with your words :-)

If jnana were not shareable, Vedanta would have become extinct in one 
generation as the Rshis would not have had any shishyas.  But it is true 
that it cannot be spoken of in terms of conventional language (Which I 
suppose what you were referring to.)  So how is jnana to be known?  By 
negation of all that is ajnana.  Far from being subjective, jnana is the 
only truly objective knowledge.  But because of the nature of our 
conventional language, it is not treated as such by those caught up 
in ajnana.
