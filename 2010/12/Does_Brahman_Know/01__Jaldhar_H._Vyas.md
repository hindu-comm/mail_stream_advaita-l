Well put!  I  would like to add that this is why the moksha-shastra is 
called advaita (non-dual) and not aikya or some some word meaning one. 
The conventional subject-object relationships (vyavahara) are the natural 
state of being for the jiva.  It is the understanding of the 
false nature of all those relationships which is called jnana.
