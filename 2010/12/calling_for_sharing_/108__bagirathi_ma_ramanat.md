I find myself in the strange position of agreeing with your meaning but 

disagreeing with your words :-)



If jnana were not shareable, Vedanta would have become extinct in one 

generation as the Rshis would not have had any shishyas. But it is true 

that it cannot be spoken of in terms of conventional language (Which I 

suppose what you were referring to.) So how is jnana to be known? By 

negation of all that is ajnana. Far from being subjective, jnana is the 

only truly objective knowledge. But because of the nature of our 

conventional language, it is not treated as such by those caught up 

in ajnana.
