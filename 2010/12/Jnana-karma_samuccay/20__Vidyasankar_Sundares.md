Bhaskar, just because I characterize your statement as "general"
and agree that any reader may apply it to any "particular" does
NOT mean that I accept the truth value or the tastefulness of
your general statement at all. I did find your comments in bad
taste myself and as a matter of fact, I don't agree that what
you meant as a "general" statement is quite valid.

It has become fashionable nowadays for anybody and everybody to
criticize anybody and everybody else. Those who have renounced
the world have become special targets of such criticism. Those
who make blanket statements about our Sannyasins often have no
reference point to distinguish between the genuine article and
the fake. I have no wish to list who I think is genuine and who
I think is fake. It is up to each person to make such a decision
independently.

Enough said. I stick by my administrative request to all members,
to limit the number of posts per day. We all have our constraints
in how and when we can read and respond to list emails. I also
stick by my general request to all list members to read other
people's posts carefully, not to wilfully misrepresent other
people's views and to be as courteous as possible in response.
I have always held that once heat enters a discussion, light
gets sidelined.

Such requests may arise from discussions between a few specific
people, but are always meant for all list members. There is no
reason to cry foul or think that some nepotism holds sway. The
moderators of this list (Ravi, Jaldhar and I) have always been
hesitant to interfere actively in terms of regulating the conduct
of the list. Our sincere hope is that we can continue this trend
for a long time to come.

Vidyasankar
