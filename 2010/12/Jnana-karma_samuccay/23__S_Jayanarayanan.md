For clarification, the above sentence is to be interpreted as:

"Although you have asked Vidya for his opinion, he has not yet replied - I feel it is not worth his time to point out trivial mistakes. My opinion follows."

I just re-read the sentence and thought it could be interpreted in a different way, sorry for the confusion.

Thanks,
