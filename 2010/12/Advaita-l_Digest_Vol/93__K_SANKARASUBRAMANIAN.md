Dear All

   - I need a help on the answers to the following query
   - I need to know what is the best punniyam in this world and similarly
   what is the worst paapam in this world
   - I have read somewhere in Deivathin Kural that best punniyam in this
   world is Aswa Medha Yaagam(AMY).. and nowadays it is not feasible to do the
   AMY .. and the alternative or equivalent to AMY is the Anaadhai Pretha
   Samskara
   - Is my understanding correct?
   - Next is the what is the worst paapam in this world.. Worst paapam is
   one where there is no pariharam is prescribed

Pl share your views
Thanks
