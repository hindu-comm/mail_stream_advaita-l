Namaste.

I am looking for Shankaracharya's hymnal works (stotra literature) in
Malayalam
script. This is on behalf of someone who is comfortable only with this
script.
Information regarding the publication, both on the internet and as printed
books
may pl. be conveyed to me off-List by email.

Even a xerox copy of such book/s from one's private collection could be made
available to me.

'shAnkara stava mAla' is supposed to be one such book but not known where it
is
available.

Best Regards,
