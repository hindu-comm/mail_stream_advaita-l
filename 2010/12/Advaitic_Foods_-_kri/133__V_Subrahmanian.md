Namaste Anand ji,

Thanks for giving the details of the various kRcchra-s.  On the whole it
appears that a kRcchra is a generic name for 'anashanam' or denying food to
oneself or fasting and there are several types in this.  Since 'chAndrAyana'
is also a method of fasting for penance / praayashchittam purpose, could it
be said that this is also a type of kRcchra?

The verse I quoted recently,

दिने दिने  च वेदान्तश्रवणात् भक्तिसंयुतात् ।
गरुशुश्रूषया लब्धात् कृच्छ्राशीतिफलं लभेत् ॥

is quoted by Sri Appayya Dikshita in the 'siddhAnta lesha sangraha', 3rd
pariccheda.  Still, the source of this verse is unknown.

Best regards,
