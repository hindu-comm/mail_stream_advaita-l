Udupi Krishna is known as Anna Brahma. People might miss His darshan, but they cannot miss the prasadam provided in the form of bhojanam.

Accommodation is widely available in Udupi, almost very next to the temple. The Bhuvaraha Guest House managed by Sode Mutt provides basic, clean rooms at a nominal rate.

Pranams

I am happy that one clarification elucidates multi-dimensional replies. I have another issue that require clarifications. As in Guruvayur accommodation and food for yatris/pilgrims, is there any facility near Shri Udupi Krishna's temple? 

With profound regards,

Sincerely,
