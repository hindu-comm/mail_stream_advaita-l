Pranams

Dear Shri Subramanian ji,

The information that you have provided is more than sufficient for me and for that matter anyone desirous of visiting Guruvayur and Udupi Krishna temples.  Can I share this information with my friend, Professor R. Subramanian, President, Lok Dharma Seva Trust Foundation, Chennai, who might circulate this information among friends for their information.

With profound personal regards,

Sincerely,
