Sri Gurubhyon Namaha
 Yes Lord Rama was indeed nonVeggie, during his 
vanavasam there are a couple of slokas which say that he and sita ate meat, i 
cannot comment on krishna or others because i havent yet read their stories 
completely

Sri Kamakshi
Raghavender R Ganti

3.Similarly Shudras jaathis can meat because of hard labor and also 
Kshatriya jaathis to develop rajas to rule/carry out wars, etc. But there 
restrictions and limits.

praNAms
Hare Krishna

I am sorry, above observation gives me a mischevous but serious doubt...If 
the above is true, then Lord Sri Rama, seetha mAta and whole of rAma's 
family, pandava-s, bheeshma pitAmaha etc. must have been non-vegetarians, 
because they are all kshatriya-s. And Lord Krishna, who wisely advised to 
offer patram, pushpam, phalaM, tOyam was a non-veggie, because he was a 
shUdra !!?? Likewise, kings like janaka, ambareesha, bali chakravarthy 
etc. must be non-vegetarians...and parashurAma who slaughtered 'kshatriya 
kula' must have turned his diet to non-veg as his task was demanding an 
extra power !!?? But all these days I was thinking these souls were pure 
vegetarians :-)) Any thoughts on this??

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
