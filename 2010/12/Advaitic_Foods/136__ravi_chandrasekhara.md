Dear All,

1.Jaldhar Vyas in Jan 26, 2005 post mentioned that for Pancha Dravida Braahmanas, meat eating is a sin. But allowed for some Pancha Gauda Braahmanas.
2.My understanding is that Kashmiri Pandits, Mathil Braahmanas, Bengali Braahmanas, and Konkan Saraswat Braahmanas are allowed (by dharmashastras)to eat fish/mutton/chicken because of the climate of their origin.
3.Similarly Shudras jaathis can meat because of hard labor and also Kshatriya jaathis to develop rajas to rule/carry out wars, etc. But there restrictions and limits. (Kanchi Paramacharya mentioned this in his book Voice of God)
4.Now if those Pancha Gauda Braahmanas reside in urban areas (cities in India, UK,USA,etc) where they do not appear to be affected by climate with regard to food habits; would shastras allow them to eat meat ?
5.Similarly, what if Rajput works as a engineer, doctor, and runs his palace converted into hotel; can he still eat meat ?
6.Likewise for a Shudra who does not do hard labor ?
7.Or is it part of their svadharma (by virtue of being born into that varna/jaathi) that they can meat regardless of locale of residence or occupation or change in circumstance ?
