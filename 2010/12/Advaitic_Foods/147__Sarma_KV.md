Dear Sri Bhaskar,

On Sri Krishna's 'kula': Being son of Devaki and Vasudeva, would there be a
doubt that He was kshatriya? Could He who upheld varNaaSrama dharma in the
Geeta become one of some other caste by being brought up as a gOpaala? Being
mathuraadheeSa and dwaarakaadheeSa, could be a SUdra? And by the way nanda
himself was kshatriya as per your own admission ("yaadava kula
vamSOdhbava...")

And then, mentioning that being a "rasika SikhaamaNi" he "must have enjoyed
non-veg menu *only*..." is nothing but blasphemy. I am really unable to
grasp that you being in this advaita forum, could understand only this much
about raasaleela! I hope you really didn't believe and mean what you
mentioned. Weather or not Sri Krishna took non-veg is much less important
than what your words express about His leela.

On this parva dina, please go through madhuraashTakam, gOvindaashTakam etc.
to understand the meaning of raasaleela.

Do you know what the peacock feather on His head symbolizes?
Do you know who was called by maharshi-s as "nityOpavaasi" and "sadaa
brahmachaari?"
