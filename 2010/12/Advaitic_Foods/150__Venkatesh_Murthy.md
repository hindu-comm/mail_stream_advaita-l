Kindly do not write such bad things about Krishna Paramatma that also
on Ekadasi. He is Ishwara. How can you call Him as Sudra? Did you see
what He was eating?  Ishwara is Creator of Caturvarnyam. Caturvarnyam
Maya Srushtam of the Geeta is clear.

On Ekadasi we are supposed to avoid food. If we talk food on Ekadasi
the mind will be thinking of food. It will tempt a person to eat. This
is wrong. It is better to discuss other topics like Geeta. Today is
Geeta Jayanti also.
