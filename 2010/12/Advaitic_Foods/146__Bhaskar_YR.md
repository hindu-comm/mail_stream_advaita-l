Today is Vaikuntha Ekadasi fast.  My suggestion to all is to avoid
talking of food for one day and  continue this discussion tomorrow. It
is a sin to eat on Ekadasi.

praNAms 
Hare Krishna

First with regard to whether Lord  Krishna is a SUdra or not...frankly I 
thought since krishna was a gOpAla, he was SUdra by his vrutti :-)) 
anyway, if we see that he is 'yAdavakula vaMshOdbhava' his kula is 
kshatriya....In either case, according to someone's observation, he was 
not having idli-chutni-sAmbaar, poori-saagu, dOsa-palya chutni for his 
breakfast & Udupi menu  for his lunch, being a 'rasika shikhAmaNi' he must 
have enjoyed  non-veg menu only :-))

And with regard to vaikunTa ekAdashi, talking about the food is not 
'eating' of the food...we talk lot about brahman but still we feel brahman 
is aloof from us, is it not:-)) Anyway, brahman is annaM & annAdaH as well 
( ahamannam, ahamannAdaH says taitireeya), so prabhuji we cannot spare 
even a single day without talking about anna brahMa which is our own 
svarUpa :-))

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
