Jai Sri Krsna

Namaste members,

I have recently got married and had gone to Singapore for my honeymoon. Unfortunately I had ordered a vege dish but unfortunately I had later learned after I had consumed a few spoons that he dish had prawn oils in it. Needless to say I'm a pure vegetarian and have been for a great part of my life. I'm really upset about what happened and have deeply repented my actions. is there any official ritual i must perform for this sin I have committed?

I appreciate that this is out of the forum for this discussion how as we're discussing food to bring us closer to realisation no doubt eating the wrong food and not attoning for it could also affect it

The thoughts of the learned would be greatly appreciated

Guru krupahi kevalam

>> *fish*, *fish* cooked with turmeric powder, pickled *fish*. And further, I

>> laugh*.)
>> 
>> "Do you know what the truth is? God has made different religions to suit

>> 
>> 
>> //MASTER (*to Vijay and the others*): "Four desires have come into my mind.
