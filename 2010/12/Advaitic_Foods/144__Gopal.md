> Medical studies says fish is bad for health because it has mercury.

This is not true. Fish is susceptible to have mercury as sea bed etc. has
mercury.  Mercury contamination because of human activity occurs may result
in increased level of  mercury.   This needs to be monitored and is being
done.

This does not mean fish is bad becaues of mercury. Dogs get rabbies. People
have pet dogs and as far as I know, they end up more saner than non-pet
owners ;-)
in many cases.

>Kindly analyse Geeta 15.14 Aham Vaishvanaro Bhutva and other Slokas
description of Sattvika, Rajasika and Tamasika foods in Geeta.  What
is your opinion of them?

is it for the householder, regular bhakta or a serious devotee striving for
salvation?
Is the norms for a soldier applied for a merchant or a teacher?

>Aham Vaishvanaro Bhutva Sloka we say every time we have meals. The
Agni in the stomach is Jatharagni the Vaishvanara. To that Agni we
offer Havis the food we eat. He digests the food we eat. The food
eating is a Yajna. In this Yajna we should offer Sattvika items. How
can we put Rajasika and Tamasika items like fish?

Sorry I dont have the reference, but Agni is said to consume everything. He
and Yama
are blind and impartial. What is Jatharagni? Agni with a face, mouth,brain,
all the makeups we see in the movies
sitting in our stomach? If he is digesting food, why do we worry about S,R
or T? If Agni is going to do the digestion
and give you the strength in terms of glucose and ATP to burn, why do you
worry about the source of food?

If I eat meat and have indigestion, is it because Agni is not doing his job
right? does he eat the digestion medicine too?

What happens if nutrients are pumped thru the blood vessels? How does agni
eat it?

Agni is pervasive. omnipresent. Before attributing anthropomorphic functions
and status to Gods,
and interpret them to day to day living, one has to think deeper.  Is Agni
just the physical fire?
god of fire? Lord of fire? Or is He something beyond and inclusive of this,
a faculty in the jeevas that
has a function and purpose?


What is anna? what is yagna? You are quoting BGita on one hand, advaitic
sadhana on the other, food affecting the prakriti thirdly,
and then call a puranic interpretation of vaishvanara. What is the origin of
Vaishvanara? Is your vaishvanara the same Chandogyo and B. Upanishads speak
of?


Apologies if I sound rude. But on one hand we talk about advaita and what
not, on the other hand we refer to puraanaa-s to justify
our views; someone will quote brahmasutras to counter someone else counting
some other part of Brahmasutras. Before arguing and
conferring our shallow human mind-derived opinions, isn't it better to find
what is the meaning of these?
