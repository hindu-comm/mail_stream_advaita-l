Jai Sri Krsna

Namaste Venkateshji,

> Southerners are more orthodox undoubtedly.

>From where do you get your evidence? I agree that the ritualistic and
practical aspect differs between north and south but to say South is more
orthodox is wrong.

North are mainly influenced by Vaishnava philosophy and hence our social and
ethical values are used from there.

If you're going to make bold claims like that please base it on factual
evidence rather than hear-say, as it does cause offence!

Kind regards,

Krunal
