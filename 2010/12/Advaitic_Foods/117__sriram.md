Dears
To my knowledge stale/ tasteless food is to be shunned by all-these are 
called Tamasic foods-Yathayamam gatha rasam----.B.G.There is no gender 
bias.Only that males used to eat first and then only ladies.Probably male 
should be provided food to his full contentment and the remaining was to be 
eaten by the ladies as in those days males were bread 
winners.R.Krishnamoorthy.
