I experience good concentration on Advaita topics after eating
Sattvika foods like milk and fruits, nuts so on. Just wanted to know
if other members experience such a thing.  Rajasika foods like fried
things, hotel food are bad for Advaitic thoughts. Eating food cooked
by unknown persons is very bad.

Question- Why Dharma allow even females to eat Tamasika food like
stale food but not males?
