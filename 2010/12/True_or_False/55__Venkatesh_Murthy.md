Then why you sending the questions to the whole list of members? Why
restrictions on the list? This is open discussion forum for members.

Nirvisesha Brahman is only Sat. Jagat, Savisesha Brahman and Jeeva are
not Sat not Asat. They are in Vyavahara only.  They appear to be Sat.
But they are not there in Paramartha.
