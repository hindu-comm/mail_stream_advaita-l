Thank you for the clarification.
This real sat and unreal asat you define and categorize - is it from the viewpoint of Reality or Unreality?
In other words :

is it the Real sat that says this is Me sat and "that Not-me" is Unreal asat 
or 
is it the unReal asat that says this is Me asat and "that Not-me" is Sat
