I ‘again-and-again’ repeat:  Isvara, according to Advaita Vedanta in
Adi-Sankara’s opinion, is pAramArtika-Sat !! na-anyaH.

I've some problem in understanding this statement of yours.  Yes, from the 
brahma ananyatva, in paramArtha everything satya only and there is ONLY 
satya nothing but satya (ne ha nAnAsti kiMchana)...So, in that absolute 
non-dual state there is absolutely no difference between para brahman and 
Ishwara.  In that sense NOT ONLY ishwara, ishwara, jeeva, jagat everything 
from brahma rUpa satya...BUT, when ishwara is separated from jeeva, jagat 
to prove his 'own' separate existence with bhArUpa, manOmaya etc. then his 
reality (satyatva)  is relative though strictly not  on par with jeeva & 
jagat satyatva.  In the aprateekAlambanAdhikaraNa sUtra bhAshya shankara 
makes it clear that Ishwara or apara prahma or kArya brahma with vishesha 
upAdhi-s (form with attributes)  etc. is due to conditioning adjunct of 
name and form created by avidyA.  But this Ishwara is nothing but that 
parabrahman and the saguNatva of parabrahman is meant for the meditation 
in the sphere of avidyA for the convenience of sAdhaka-s who cannot 
contemplate on the absolute featureless parabrahman.  Thus elsewhere 
shankara clarifies : brahman conditioned by name and form set up by avidyA 
becomes Ishwara just as universal ether limited as it were by jars, pots 
etc.

Hope I am in line with your thought.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
