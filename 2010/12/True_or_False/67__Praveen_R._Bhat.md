I don't think an upanishadic statement, that too a mahAvAkya, needs
another upanishadic statement as a support. Could you also
share which upanishad talks of gopAlaham?

We see in Bhagavatham that Gopis take the form of

Having the same rUpa as the deity is not *being* Him. In any case,
this has nothing to do with tat tvam asi.

Madhusudana

I don't think that Madhusudana Saraswati is talking of sarUpya (mukti)
anywhere here.

Finally, coming back to the original subject, even in your response
you felt a need to explain your "True" which is what everyone here is
pointing out. A simple true and false just won't do in case of loaded
questions.
