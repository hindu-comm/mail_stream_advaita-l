Sri Vidyasankar, Sri Devanathan, Sri Subrahmanian,

According to advaitam, could you please answer true or false to the
following question?

   1. Nirvisesha Brahman (Nirguna Brahman) is sat (real)
   2. Savisesha Brahman (Saguna Brahman or Ishwara) is asat (unreal)
   3. Jagat is asat (unreal)
   4. Jivatvam is asat (unreal)

I request others to answer only after these three answer and that ONLY if
you disagree. Thank you.
