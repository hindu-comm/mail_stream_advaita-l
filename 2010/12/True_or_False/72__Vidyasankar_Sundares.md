You seem intent on misunderstanding. I will reiterate. "As brahman", 
ISvara is sat. "As brahman", jIva is sat. "As brahman", sarvam sat.
Please find out where the "level of reality lower than brahman" is
said by anybody.

Your statement, "even opponents dont attribute such positions to
Sankara" presumes you know what are the true positions of Sankara,
or at least you know what it is that opponents attribute to Sankara.
Kindly enlighten the list on either or both.

It is time to move to serious philosophical discussion and get out
of your non-sequiturs that other list members have noticed. If you
are only interested in the latter, I won't waste my time responding
to you any more.

Vidyasankar
