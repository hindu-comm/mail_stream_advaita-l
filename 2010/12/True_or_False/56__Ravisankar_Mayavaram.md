I do not think you  have the right to set conditions such as, others can
answer only after these three can answer and so on.  This unmoderated list
and members can contribute to any message on this forum. If you have issues
such these three should answer first, please send a personal e-mail to them
and NOT to the list.

With best wishes,
Ravi
