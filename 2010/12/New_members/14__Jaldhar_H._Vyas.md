Ramakrishna Prasad
------------------

I am a smarta brahmana and trying to be one. I do practice the sandhya twice 
a day. I want to know the meaning of the mantra which we spell during the 
sandhya.


Ram Kalluri
-----------

I am reading the advaita-vedanta.org site to learn about advaita vedanta. 
Would like to join this list to read discussions about the various 
traditions.


Saikrishna
----------

Hi,

I am 26 year old student. I am interested in understanding advaita 
philosophy. I hope to learn by silent observation for a quite a long time. 
My vessel is empty and hope that this group can spare their wisdom and fill 
it up.
