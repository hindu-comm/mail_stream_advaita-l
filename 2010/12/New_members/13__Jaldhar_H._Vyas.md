Hello,
I have always had an interest in philosophy and comparative religion, and
probably one of the most admirable schools I've come across is Advaita. That
said though, I am not as well informed as I'd like to be, and if this forum
can introduce me to Shankara, Ramana Maharshi and so on, that would make
this a good experience.

Alexander
