Namasthe. I am a follower of Sri Bhagavathpada. Would like to acquire 
knowledge through this great forum


Gautham Shenoy R
----------------

Namaste,

My name is Gautham Shenoy R. I am currently pursuing my PhD in theoretical 
computer science. I come from a family of Gauda Saraswata Brahmins belonging 
to the Vatsa Gotra following the Shakala Shakha of the Rg-Veda and 
Ashwalayana Sutras.

It has been only a couple of years since I took any serious interest in our 
religion. Translations of Adi Shankaracharya's works were among the first 
thing I happened to look at during this time. I have been a regular reader 
of the Advaita-vedanta-List archives and I have found the discussions to be 
really informative and conducive in understanding our dharma better.

While all these many months I have been a fly on the wall, I now would like 
to join the list with a hope that I can get some of my doubts clarified.

Thanks and Regards 
gautham.
