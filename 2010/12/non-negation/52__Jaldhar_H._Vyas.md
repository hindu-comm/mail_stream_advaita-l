Let us say you're walking in the street and you hear me shout to you "Hey 
Kashiram!"  You turn around and say to me, "I'm not Kashiram I'm Rajaram." 
And I realize my mistake and recognize you as Rajaram.  Now where is 
Kashiram?  He has been negated but you have not thereby beome a void have 
you?  In fact you are Kashiram but Kashiram is an inferior way of 
describing Rajaram.
