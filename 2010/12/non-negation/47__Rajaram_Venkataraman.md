Sri Vidyasankar,

You said "In a way, advaita already does negate nothing while negating
everything". It is the same thing that Sri Jaladhar Vyas also said "It is
the common mistake of seeing Jnana as a subtractive process". This is what I
am trying to understand. You negate the world, jivatvam and Ishwaratwam. How
can you say you negate nothing? The only thing that you dont negate is
Brahman but even the name Brahman is negated. Any concept of Brahman is only
a mental modification, also to be negated.

My parents also say that it is not void like buddhism but they only learnt
from their elders and cant offer scholarly references.
