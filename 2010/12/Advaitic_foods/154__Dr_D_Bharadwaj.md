Dear Sri Kman,

You said '' Brahmins stopped eating
meat only after Buddha's teachings and the competition from Buddhism. ''

Can you please tell us how you are so sure? According whom is it so ?? I
mean Sir, I would like to know whether this claim is established beyond all
doubt by somebody authorized to do so?

Pranams
