In addition to these reasons, I have also found many obstacles coming in my
way when I openly speak about these matters.  That is, if I say  I am doing
this and that -- I do not know why -- next time when I have to do that  I
face obstacles. This has happened to me repeatedly. Hence, I keep these
things to myself.

I should, however, thank Bhaskarji for his post. I am very happy to learn
about members who observe dharma well and serve as an example for many
others like me to follow.

With best wishes,.
Ravi
