Its interesting to know that someone other than me also has a similar
experience, else I risk being called superstitious. :) Thanks for
sharing this thought. In any case, I don't have much of anything
regular going on to share.

The 20 point spiritual diary as given by Acharya Caitanya ji is also
given by Swami Sivananda ji in many books. I've never been able to
write spiritual diary and track it. Swami Sivananda ji used to
encourage people to write spiritual diaries and send it
to him for guidance.

praNAm,
