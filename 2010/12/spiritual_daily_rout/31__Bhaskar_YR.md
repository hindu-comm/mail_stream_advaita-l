Such being the case, your question might not elicit replies from the 
pious and learned who might be afraid that a reply would be indulging in 
damba. 
I know you did not intend it to be so, but I merely point out an 
auxilliary 
consequence of the question and wish to submit that such questions ought 
not to 
be posed - in public or private. 

praNAms Sri Siva Senani Nori prabhuji
Hare Krishna

Thanks a lot for your insightful thoughts prabhuji.

Yes, I do understand the difficulties of members  in disclosing their 
daily spiritual activity.  But my only intention of asking that question 
is, if the advanced sAdhaka-s could come forward & share their routines, 
that would be of great help to the tyro-s...I thought (still think so!!) 
most of the members would be true to their self while briefing their 
routines and their wisdom would definitely a guiding force for the self 
upliftment of ordinary mortals like me.  ofcourse, that is what Krishna 
too says in geeta, yadyadAcharati shreshTah...sa yat pramANam kurute 
lOkastadanu vartate.  If the pious and noble sAdhaka-s donot want to 
comeforward and share their knowledge & sAdhana vidhAna & want to keep it 
in secrecy  with the fear of 'daMba', where, we, the ordinary sAdhaka-s 
should go??  Hence, this request prabhuji.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
