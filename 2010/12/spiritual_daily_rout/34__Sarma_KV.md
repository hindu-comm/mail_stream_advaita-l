Spiritual routine is really personal matter - to each his own - because each
individual is unique.
The most common aspect will be sandhya vandanam. There are other vihita
anushTHaana-s which very few people get to perfom (such as brahma-yajnam,
ouposana/vaiSvadEvam, etc.)
Over and above these vihita anushTHaana-s, others are individualized.
