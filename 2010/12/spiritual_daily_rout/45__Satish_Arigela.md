Thank you Ravi and Praveen for saying this. I had the same experience not once 
but multiple times and I never understood why. It happened many times..to the 
point where it almost felt "magical" or perhaps it is just psychological?... i 
dont know. Even if one exercises an iron will and somehow does it..still there 
will be atleast small vighna-s or atleast there lingers a sense of being 
"incomplete"or un-natural.

Anyway most tantra/mantra-shAstra grantha-s advise sAdhaka-s not to reveal their 
sAdhana probably for this reason?
With the exception of temple rituals almost all(or most)Agamik/tAntrik rituals 
are preferably done in private for a variety of reasons.
