Hari OM, Acharya Pranipataji,

Thanks for the mention although I knew that. I was just sharing that
many of Swami Sivanandaji's books carry the spiritual diary.

Apologies for the late response, I was holding back to see if I can
combine more than one response in this mail.

praNAm,
--Praveen R. Bhat
