Dear Dr. Bharadwaj,

I agree with what you mentioned. The routine of 'those days' is not so
narrow-focused as now.

In aapastamba gRhya sUtra-s, almost every event of a day (including things
like assuaging an angry man) has a "vEdic way" of doing, which was the only
way! It invariably involved invocation of deva-s (by chanting prescribed
anuvaaka-s and doing other prescribed things) and thus there was a regular
'interaction' between the deva-s and humans (like Sri Krishna said in the
geeta,"parasparam bhaavayantaH") which also involved
banishing/keeping-at-bay the asura-s.

It is in these days that the intent to 'interact' with the deva-s has
reduced considerably among the humans. Hence in the present day we think
that when people are doing sandhyavandana or some such thing they are
"praying" Gayatri, Surya etc.

Srouta yaaga-s are vEdia (Srouta) rites performed in the present day also.
They are among the very few of vEdic practices that are performed as
prescribed in the Srouta almost as exactly as done in the yore. The whole
premises - yaaga Shaala - is built as prescribed and hence the area within
is as pure as in 'those days.' Within the Saala, there is no "maDi." In
fact, if a person observing '*maDi*' touches everyone but still thinks he is
in 'maDi', he is jocularly said to be observing "*Srouta-maDi*" in my family
circles.

maDi came (invented/discovered?) when we started focusing on the mundane and
neglected our 'connections.'
