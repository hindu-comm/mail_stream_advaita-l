Rather than for routines, we do have terms for the fruit or result of those 
routines - iha and para. Routine is but one and is for the purpose of the 
purushaarthas - dharma, artha, kaama and moksha. We ought to pursue artha and 
kama without deviating from dharma. Somewhere in the process, we might get 
jñaana and thence the final goal, moksha. All karma that we do is for 
purification, that is preparation for the dawn of jñaana; till that does not 
happen, all dhaarmic actions - not merely worship, but every act which is useful 
to others, give us the paraartha of puNya and consequent svarga-sukha or 
reduction in paapa. And, worship or religious activities do not give only 
paraartha. The nitya karmas like sandhyavandana do not give any puNya, they 
merely avoid the pratyavaaya; it is the kaamya karmas which give the fruit as 
declared in sentences like 'svargakaamo yajeta'. Even in kaamya karmas, some 
like putrakamaeshThi or Syenayaaga give laukika or iha-phalas (children and 
destruction of enemies respectively).

Can somebody tell me the original Sastric terms for spiritual and
non-spiritual routines?
