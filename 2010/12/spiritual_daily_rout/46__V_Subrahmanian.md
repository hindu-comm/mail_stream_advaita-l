When we have spoken out our practices, it is very likely that someone
praises.  And when asked to speak out, we ourselves, not very conscious of
it, engage in self-praise.  There is that thing called: burI nazar, or
'dRShTi'.  All these take their toll and it is the routine that  suffers.
We become wiser by this experience and try not to disclose/trumpet or even
think of the practices appreciatively ourselves.

Mahatmas do not generally disclose their practices; they might sometimes
allow their sincere  disciples to watch them and learn and imbibe.  As
someone said, each person's routine is unique in itself and there can be
only a general commonality which can be adapted by each one to suit one's
tastes and temperaments.
