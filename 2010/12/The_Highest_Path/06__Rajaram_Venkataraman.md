In the chapter on Bhakti Yoga, Arjuna asks Krishna who is the best yogi -
the one who worships you the personal form of Ishwara or the akshara
brahman.

*evam satata-yukta ye*
*bhaktas tvam paryupasate*
*ye capy aksaram avyaktam*
*tesam ke yoga-vittamah*
**
Lord Krishna categorically asserts that one who worships Him is higher than
one who is speculating about akshara brahman, who is not manifest.

*mayy avesya mano ye mam*
*nitya-yukta upasate*
*sraddhaya parayopetas*
*te me yuktatama matah*
**
Adi Sankara also agrees that a bhakta is the highest among the yogis though
he says that a self realized jnani is not under question here. I would like
to know that is the opinion of the scholars on this forum or based on a
wider knowledge they think that bhakti to Ishwara in divya rupam is not
considered the highest by advaita tradition.
