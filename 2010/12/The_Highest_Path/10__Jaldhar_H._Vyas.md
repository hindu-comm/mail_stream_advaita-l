Actually what he is that one who worships Him with devotion is more 
accomplished in Yoga than one who worships (the word speculating is 
entirely inappropriate) the imperishable unmanifest form of Brahman. 
Bhakta, upasaka, yogi, are terms that could be applied to either.  Why are 
the former superior?

"Those who meditate on the Unmanifest have greater trouble because their 
goal, the Unmanifest, is very hard to reach for the embodied."

It is simply practical advice.  The problem of ignorance is due to 
embodiment and the resulting sense of aham, "I".  It is very difficult for 
those who are wrapped up in ahamkara to understand an abstraction.  But 
understanding a form to which one can relate is easier.

Lately my wife has been singing a bhajan by the famous Gujarati saint 
Narsinha Mehta called "jal kamal channi jane bala".  It tells the story of 
how Krishna Bhagavan went to fight Kaliya Nag from the perspective of the 
Naganis or wives of Kaliya Nag.  They try to convince Him to go home 
because He is just a child and He will surely get killed by the big bad 
snake.  The theme is that they are ideal Bhaktas because their love for 
Krishna Bhagavan is so pure despite not knowing His true nature.  Of 
course by the end of the story Kaliya and his wives do know who they are 
dealing with.

The function of Advaita Vedanta is to take us from asat to sat.  If Bhakti 
can do this then by all means let it be considered the best.  But if 
someone should take the longer, more difficult road and succeed then there 
is nothing "lower" about it.
