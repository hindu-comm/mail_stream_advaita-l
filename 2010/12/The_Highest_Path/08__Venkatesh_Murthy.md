Advaita philosophy takes Jnana as the highest path. Nahi Jnanena
Sadrusham is motto. But there may be people not qualified for Jnana
Marga.  For those people and others interested in Ishwara there is
Bhakti Marga. He will see highest Bhakti as So'ham. Bhakta and God
become One.

A problem of Bhakti could be people asking for favours and partiality
from God instead of concentrating on Him. They become angry if  they
do not get asked things. Then they lose faith.

Not expecting from Ishwara is important.

Hanuman and others great pure Bhaktas like Bhakti but it cannot not
prove Bhakti is superior.
