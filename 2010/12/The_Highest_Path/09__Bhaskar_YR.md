I would like to know that is the opinion of the scholars on this forum or 
based on a
wider knowledge they think that bhakti to Ishwara in divya rupam is not
considered the highest by advaita tradition.

We, the advaitins dont consider the 'dvaita' bhakti & its sAdhana as 
highest (though it is very much necessary for the madhyama and manda 
adhikAri-s like me) coz. this sAdhana ultimately keeps the bhAkta aloof 
from Ishwara permanently...However, we the advaitins do think Ishwara in 
divya rUpa is nothing but that nirguNa, nirAkAra parabrahman coz. 
parabrahman itself coined as saguNa, savishesha brahman for the purpose of 
 meditation and upAsana.  Treating saguNa brahman as parabrahman and 
upAsanAdi sAdhana towards him called as parAbhakti which ultimately leads 
to jnAnanishTa, which is not anyway dvaita bhakti.  In short, the Ishwara 
in divya rUpa what you are talking above is intended for meditation which 
is nothing but ekamevAdviteeya parabrahman. 

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
