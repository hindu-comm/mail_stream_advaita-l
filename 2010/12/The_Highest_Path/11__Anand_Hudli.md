It is useful to study, with shankara bhAShya,  the Brihadaranyaka statement,
"yo anyAM devatAmupAste, anyo asAvanyo ahamasmIti, na sa veda, yathA
pashurevaM sa devAnAm.h | ..." (1.4.10). One who worships another God
thinking, "I am different from Him", does not know (the Truth) and he is
like an animal to the Gods. The Gods do not like it that men should know
this truth declaring the identity of Brahman with everything, as conveyed by
the statement "ahaM brahmAsmi". Why? A man does not like it when one of his
animals that serve him (e.g. a cow or horse) is taken away. In similar
fashion, the Gods do not like it when a person, who is serving them like an
animal, is taken away or ceases serving them, once he realizes "ahaM
brahmAsmi", that he is not their animal!
