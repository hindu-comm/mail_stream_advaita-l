Namaste.

Before the study, you had 'gravity-(specific)viShayaka-avidya'.  Now,
that has gone.  Yet, you may, and most appropriately, will, continue
to have 'n-viShayaka-avidya' and they remain.  When AtmajnAna is had,
everything, known to you and unknown to you, will be seen as Atma,
Consciousness.

 'Gravity-rUpa-avidya' is dispelled by 'gravity-rUpa-vidya'.

On another note, 'gravity' is also avidya and everything that is
knowable, known, the knower, the knowing instrument, the knowing act,
are all in the realm of avidya alone.  Brahman, the Consciousness
alone is vidya.  From further familiarisation with Vedanta you will
come to appreciate this.

Best regards,
subrahmanian.v
