 V Subrahmanian ji, I am a beginner so please bear with me.
I have a question about Maya and avidya.

When an Apple falls down from a tree, I do not know why it falls down.
My avidya is cleared after studying Newton's law and understanding gravity
is the reason.
So can I call Gravity is same as avidya?

thanks
Kris

mAyA
