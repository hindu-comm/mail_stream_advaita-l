It is this fundamental disagreement about the SarIra that causes the
major dispute here. Isn't it ironic, in a way, that vedAnta is SArIraka mImAMsA?!!

Reply:- that is precisely why it is SAriraka MImAMsA I think, for a mImAMsA is a profound inquiry not just an enquiry from an arm chair........!

One aspect i think relevant here - the Holenarsipur Swamigal does not I believe from what I read from him, ignore 'materiality' aspect, but that for him, based on Shankara's remark in Shariraka 2-1-14 and other places, thepotent avyakta shakti that is anirvachaniya from Ishwara or Brahman, (i.e. whether the formeris same or different from the latter) but that again is an assumption validly made under the Srouta literature (See revered commentator using "Abhupagantavya") to again explain the appearance of this world and the apparant duality; because the Adhayasa is in experience to an un-initiated. That is why toSwamiji the "paramartha" and the "vyavahara" two tier explanation and the method to reveal it - the "Adhyaropa Apavada" are Sampradaya prasada from Sruti, Sri Goudapada and the revered Commentator.
