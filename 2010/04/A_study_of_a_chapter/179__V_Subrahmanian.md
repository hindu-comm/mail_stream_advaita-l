One cannot deny, without rejecting the Bhashya, that the 'samskAra' is
concomitant in a Jivan mukta; that is what makes jivan mukti a possibility.
'jeev prANadhaaraNe' is the dhAtu.  When prANa is there, the mind is  there
and the samskAra is also there.

When the Holenarsipur tradition accepts the concept of jivan mukti and the
jivan mukta, it implies that they also accept the samskAra that is what is
vital to jivanmukti.  When samskAra is accepted, its other name: avidya
lesha also stands accepted.  When I accept 'water' is called 'jalam' in
Sanskrit, I cannot protest 'udakam' is not acceptable to me.

I do not think this goes well with what JnanaprasUnendra Swamigal's
concluding remarks to Martha Doherty's paper implies.  He asserts  - what
SSS has admitted, said and rejected is the final word and anything other
than that is not the correct understanding of Vedanta.  Whatever names,
however popular or revered, are invoked to show a different understanding of
the Vedanta from that of SSS is of no consequence.

I have only restated and not reproduced his words.  Going by this, Jagadguru
Chandrashekhara Bharati Swamigal does not qualify to be a Jivanmukta, why a
mukta at all, as His well-known approval and teaching of the concept of
mUlAvidyA, and by extension, avidyA lesha,  definitely does not come
'within' the SSS order.  Even on that count, it is definitely startling that
Sri Subraya Sharma includes this mahAtma in the book.
