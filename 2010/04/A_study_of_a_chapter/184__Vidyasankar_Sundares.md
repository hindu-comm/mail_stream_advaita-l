> Dear Vidyasankarji,

> If the Vivekachudamani is really a work of Adi Sankara, his views are clear. The Jnanai has to live in the body and so in the world (material) till  the body (with all the Koshas) disappear / dissolve. Please correct me if I am wrong. I read it quite sometime ago.

That is the status, no matter what anyone may think about the authorship of vivekacUDAmaNi.


Regards,

Vidyasankar
