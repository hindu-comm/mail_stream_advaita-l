Sringeri Shankara Math has published a book called "mUlAvidyA 
bhAShyavArtikasaMmatA" written
by paNDitapravara Krishna Jois.

Hare Krishna

This is for the information, to refute this 'sammata mata' Sri 
Jnanaanandendra saraswati has written a book called 'mUlAvidyA 
bhAshyavArtikaviruddha'(available in both Kannada & Sanskrit 
languge)...Though it is out of print now in Karyalaya, I think those who 
are interested in this work can ask for the photocopy from the Karyalaya. 
mUlAvidyA vimarshe also by the same author is good reference material to 
know how this mUlAvidyA is a dangerous tumour in shankara's advaita 
vedanta system.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
