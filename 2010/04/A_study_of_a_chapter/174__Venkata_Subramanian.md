As I understand from even your own quotation of the Bhashya in the PDF file, the Jiva is NEVER ever i bondage; the very understanding that I am bound is a misapprehension. That is why the Holenarsipur Swamigal, following the footsteps of the Revered Commentator, holds that this mis-apprehension is a facility assumed for explanation purpose, by Tradition and is what called "Adhyasa" or "Avidya" or "Ajnana" or "Jnana Abhava" all these terms used by the Revered Commentator himself as synonyms.

When Avidya itself is thus a facility for explantion and understanding, there cannot be another "Avidya Lesha"; the term never occuring in the Bhashya genuinely attributed to the Revered Commentator so far. What is a harmless "Samskara" for the Revered Commentator, cannot solidify into something so much is our point of view.

Your example is not appropriate as we contend there has been no marriage at all, so the question of asking whether he is son in law or daughter's husband does not arise.

Subrahmanian - why dont you patiently shut the doors for a while and read the Swamiji's original work - Mulavidya Nirasa for a while yourself. You seem to be comfortable in Sanskrit language and the book is itself now available after re-print. In fact his chapter 2 is the analysis of all Vivarana, chitsuki, Samkshepa shariraka, sidhanta lesha sangraha etc. and then in Chapter 3 he gives his views. The book is clear and holds in its own merit. I am afraid I dont have the required traditional learning on this subject to answer you effectively, but I can understand within myself whenever I read your articles that you are not telling something new which that Swamigal has not analysed.





Thanks & Regards,
Venkat.

Sadgurubhyo Namah.

In Kannada there is a saying:

A person was not in good terms with his son-in-law. So he hated the idea of
referring to him as his son-in-law. He always said 'he is my daughter's
husband'.

I find the case of mUlAvidya rejection and accepting the very same
inevitable concept in another form under another name such as jnAnAbhaava or
abhAvarUpa kAraNa is no different from the above analogy.

The case with avidya lesha is also the same. The samskara that operates
cannot be wished away. One may not like the term 'avidya lesha', but the
fact of it is there. No other meaning for the term 'samskara' of the
Bhashya in this context is possible to be adduced. The Ratnaprabha has said
it accurately to ward off any apprehension about the mUlAvidyA being
present: vikShepaka-avidyAlesha eva tat-samskAraH. The 'AvaraNa' aspect of
avidya has been dispelled by the samyagjnAna. So there is no possibility of
that to linger. But the samskAra of having had the
dvaita/nAnAtva/projecting power darshana will be there till the fall of the
body. This samskara sustains jivanmukti.
