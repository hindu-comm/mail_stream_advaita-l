Just to set the records straight:

Pandit Sri K. Krishna Jois was in Holenarasipura during 1956 - 59 as an
employee of the KAryAlaya.  He was hired to translate some of the works of
SSS (apparently from Sanskrit to Kannada).

Sri Jois had completed his Vedanta studies under Naveenam Venkatesha Sastry
in Bangalore at the Sringeri Shankara Matha.  He was in search of a suitable
employment and this led him to Holenarasipura.  He was niether a disciple
nor a student of SSS.

When the Sringeri Matha at Bangalore itself had an opening for teaching
Vedanta, Sri Jois was called back by the Jagadguru by repeated telegrams and
thus he returned to take up this posiition which he held for several decades
until his retirement.

I had the good fortune of being his student for about seven years till his
demise at the age of about 88 years.

Om Tat Sat
