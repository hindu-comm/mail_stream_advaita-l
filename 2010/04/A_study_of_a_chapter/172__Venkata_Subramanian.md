Without going into any merit, if one were to dismiss a lofty thinking of this calibre as Mulavida nirasa so easily by the quible of a few words...this is a classic example.

Thanks & Regards,

Pt. Krishna Jois himself says very clearly that if the effort of the
mulAvidyAnirAsa work is to disprove mUlAvidyA that is
vAstavika (real), there is nothing that contradicts schools such as the
vivaraNa and bhAmatI schools. In fact, such an
effort helps the vivaraNa and bhAmatI schools. However, if the effort is to
disprove mUlAvidyA as a vyAvahArika satya or
mithyA entity then the effort is wasted! "viphalashcha prayAsaH" as Krishna
Jois says.
The same comment applies to all other books in the same line as the first
one.
