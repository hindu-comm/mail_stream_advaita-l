Thanks to Shri Subrahmanian for the article on "bhAmatI-samAlochanam".
Sringeri Shankara
Math has published a book called "mUlAvidyA bhAShyavArtikasaMmatA" written
by
paNDitapravara Krishna Jois. It should be available at the Sringeri Math
bookstore. This
book, written in response to the mUlAvidyAnirAsa work, provides more than
ample evidence
to show that the mUlAvidyA principle is consistent with both Shankara's and
Sureshvara's
works.

Anand
