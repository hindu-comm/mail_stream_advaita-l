This is his tattva jnaana pratipattiH, understanding, conviction, of the
Tattva, Truth. This is expressed by the Acharya in the 4.1.15 bhAShyam as :
स्वहृदयप्रत्ययं ब्रह्मवेदनम्.

This reality has been understood by me.

This is because it is only TO the "others" in vyavahara that he is a Jivan

No one is positing bandha-mukti in absolute terms.  The verse: न निरोधो न
चोत्पत्तिः...of the KArikA 2.32 is quite popular in Advaita.

The Acharya says: देहधारणं च (The Jnani has the conviction of his
non-difference from Brahman AND about his continuing to be in the body.
(नवद्वारे पुरे देही नैव कुर्वन्न कारयन् of the Gita). He explains the
drinking water, eating food, etc. of the Jnani by the words: बाधितमपि
मिथ्याज्ञानं किञ्चित्कालं *संस्कारवशात्* द्विचन्द्रज्ञानवत् अनुवर्तते .
Nowhere He says it is ' but an explanation self created by the "others" in
the "vyavahara" to explain themselves..'  Far from saying that it is
self-created by 'others in vyavahaara', the Acharya Himself explains it in
the most logical terms, giving a hetu: *संस्कारवशात्* and a dRShTaanta:
द्विचन्द्रज्ञानवत् .  This possibility is further elucidated and upheld by
SSS in his footnote.

Pl. note that I have no ulterior motive.  I want to know the truth.  I
contested your claim contrasting the Christian practice from the SSS
tradition.  In this process, I stated the implication of the remarks in the
rebuttal of the Martha Doherty paper.  To see no substance in this is your
prerogative;  I certainly have not made a claim by stating a fact.

I genuinely feel the above incident has no bearing on the present
discussion.  I have myself quoted this incident in other fora before.  No
one, at least among Advaitins, has questioned the Sarvajnatva of
Bhagavatpada.

Yes.  The BhAShyakAra is definitely sufficient, if His words ' *संस्कारवशात्'
*etc. are not simply glossed over to give an impression that they are
redundant in the BhAshya or that they are detrimental to any attempt to
oppose avidya lesha. *

Every post-Shankara Advaita Acharya and all Advaitins have pledged complete
allegiance to Bhagavatpada.  There is no need to mention anyone by name.  It
goes without saying.

It is this view of SSS that is questioned.  Where is that unquestioning
fervour displayed in the treatment of the word: *संस्कारवशात् *?

I think we are not moving an inch forward in the discussion. We seem to have
reached a stalemate.  If no new input is coming forth on this crucial word,
I do not see any point in continuing this thread.
