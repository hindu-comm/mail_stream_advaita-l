Oh no, avidyA is certainly not a purely epistemological device. It
also has ontological characteristics as it is responsible for the
appearance of space, time and all objects. As avidyA is essentially
the superimsposition of pramAtR^itvam on the Atman it would be more
accurate to say that the distinction of ontology and epistemology is a
consequence of avidyA.
