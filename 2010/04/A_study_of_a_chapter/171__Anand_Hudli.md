>This book of krishna Jois has in turn been effectively answered by Sri
Vittala Shastri in his - Mulavidya Bhashya Vartika Virudha.  >By the way,
Krishna Jois Sharma himself was a disciple of Sri Holenarsipuram Swamigal.

Pt. Krishna Jois himself says very clearly that if the effort of the
mulAvidyAnirAsa work is to disprove mUlAvidyA that is
vAstavika (real), there is nothing that contradicts schools such as the
vivaraNa and bhAmatI schools. In fact, such an
effort helps the vivaraNa and bhAmatI schools. However, if the effort is to
disprove mUlAvidyA as a vyAvahArika satya or
mithyA entity then the effort is wasted! "viphalashcha prayAsaH" as Krishna
Jois says.
The same comment applies to all other books in the same line as the first
one.
