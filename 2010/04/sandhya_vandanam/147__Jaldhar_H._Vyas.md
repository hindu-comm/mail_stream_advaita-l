But the vedAnga jyotISha of lAgadhAcharya is almost completely sidelined 
and forgotten nowadays.  The foundations of contemporary jyotISha are the 
siddhAntas particularly sUryasiddhAnta.  This class of works are 
considerably later from a historical point of view.  However there is a 
continuity between them and earlier times.
