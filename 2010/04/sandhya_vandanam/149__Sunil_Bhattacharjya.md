Dear friends,

Brihaspati is mentioned in Veda and there is no confusion. To my knowledge Shukra is mentioned as Bhargava. Some people believe that Shani is Yama in Veda.There is divided opinion on Magala. It could be Bhauma and there is also a term related to Angirasa. 

Regards,

SunilK. Bhattacharjya

With my Sandhya practice, I have found a lot more benefit looking at the
meanings of the japam (kamorkarsheet..), meaning of gayatri, upasthana
mantras that follow the japam. I particularly find the mantras like Namah
Savitre, Jagadeka... very very elevating. They are filled with surrender and
devotion.

I am not discouraging delving into the meaning of the mantras. I am only
indicating my personal preference to delve into the spiritual aspects of
Sandhya rather than the ones that are related to worship of the devas.

Gurubhyo namah.
