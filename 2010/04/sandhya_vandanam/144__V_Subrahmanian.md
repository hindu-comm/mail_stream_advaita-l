Namaste.

This URL contains a pdf of 'navagraha sUktam', a collection of Vedic
mantras:

You can also download the sUktam recited by scholars. (search the net)

In my understanding, since all events in life are influenced by graha-s,
their preeti is a must in order that adverse influence is warded off.  To
this end, 'tarpanam' is given to them thrice a day.

More inputs could come from other members as well.
