Namaste.

In the (English) book 'Sri Appayya Dikshita' by Dr. N. Ramesan (1972), on
page 109 there is a mention of a work of Dikshita, '*Pancharatna stuti and
its commentary'*.  On page 149 the stuti is reproduced in full.  It starts
with the words: bhUtasya jaata iti vaariruhAsanasya....(It looks like a hymn
on Lord Shiva, the Supreme).

I am looking for the commentary, also by Dikshita, of this work on behalf of
a scholar.  If anyone has information about the commentary by searching in
various locations like the Digital Library of India, etc., kindly inform me.

Om Tat Sat
