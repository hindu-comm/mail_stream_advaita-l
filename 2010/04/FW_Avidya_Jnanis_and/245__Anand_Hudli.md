Please stop distorting what I said. Half-truths can be more dangerous than
lies. Read what I wrote (two messages) earlier this month on SarvajnAtman
again, and also Shri S N Sastri's message (dated April 4)  in this regard.
He gives exact quotes where SarvajnAtman has acknowledged avidyAlesha. That
should give you a complete picture. SarvajnAtman does agree that
avidyAlesha  exists in a jIvanmukta. Here is my own conclusion from my
message on April 8:
"It is clear that SarvajnAtman has also accepted avidyAlesha and jIvanmukti
in his works, the saMkShepa shArIraka and the panchaprakriyA."
Also, the siddhAnta lesha saMgraha of Appayya DIkshita , that I quoted, and
siddhAntakalpavallI of sadashiva brahmendra, both acknowledge avidyAlesha in
no uncertain terms.
