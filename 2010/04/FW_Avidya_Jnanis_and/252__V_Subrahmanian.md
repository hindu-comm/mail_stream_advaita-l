Namaste.

The following quote from the Acharya's Bhashya too is contradicted by
Mandana's view:

[Sutra bhashya 4.1.15]‘’The knowledge of the Self being essentially
non-active destroys all works by sublating wrong knowledge; but wrong
knowledge – comparable to the appearance of a double moon – lasts for
some time even after it has been sublated, owing to the impression it
has made.  Moreover, it is not a matter for dispute at all whether the
body of the Knower of Brahman continues to exist for sometime or not.

//For how can one contest the fact of another possessing the knowledge
of Brahman – vouched for by his heart’s conviction – and at the same
time continuing with the body? This alone has been elaborated in the
Shruti and Smriti in the form of teaching of the Sthitaprajna (Man of
steady Knowledge). //

Om Tat Sat
