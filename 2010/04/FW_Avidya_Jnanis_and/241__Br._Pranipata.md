Hari Om Shri Anand ji, Pranaams!

Granted one who is experiencing avidyAlesha writes about it in its dasha; 
one who is experiencing now vidyAdasha writes from his experience about 
jnAna and from memory about avidyA part, then what status to be regarded 
about works of nitya-shuddha-mukta-puruShAs writing about avidyA? For 
example bhagavadgItA by Lord.

It will become like gummA/pUchAnDi bhAva rUpa theory of Shri Subrahmanianji. 
Postulating, Lord being able to see the ajnAna in arjuna's mind will make 
Lord ajnAni - as per AcArya the one who sees avidyA posses it. Secondly 
verse 18.72 of gItA becomes reduntant because if He can earlier see the 
ajnAna now He should be able to see its destruction also.

Whether a jnAni makes another ajnAni as a jnAni by his upadesha or not, 
ajnAnis by mere discussion makes all jnAnis the opposite.

In Shri Guru Smriti,
Br. Pranipata Chaitanya
