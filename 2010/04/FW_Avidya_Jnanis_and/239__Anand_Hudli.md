One question comes to mind, which one who just learned to ride a
tricycle can think of (figuratively speaking). The AchAryas who have written
about avidyAlesha in their works were and are regarded as
jnAnis  themselves. If they wrote about avidyAlesha, would it not be
reasonable to expect that they wrote about it only according to their
experience? Would they be writing about it if their own experience was to
the contrary?
