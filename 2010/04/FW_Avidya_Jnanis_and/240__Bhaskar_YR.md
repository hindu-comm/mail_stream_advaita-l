One question comes to mind, which one who just learned to ride a
tricycle can think of (figuratively speaking). The AchAryas who have 
written
about avidyAlesha in their works were and are regarded as
jnAnis  themselves. If they wrote about avidyAlesha, would it not be
reasonable to expect that they wrote about it only according to their
experience? Would they be writing about it if their own experience was to
the contrary?

IMO, this is not a valid & logical doubt!! when vyAkhyAnakAra-s themselves 
are not unanimous in their siddhAnta pratipAdana, it is very difficult to 
determine who wrote what with their 'own' experience & how far their 
doctrines are credible and true to shankara's siddhAnta.  bhAmati does not 
agree with vivaraNa & vice versa..one calls another 'mandana prushTa sevi' 
for writing something which contradicts his 'own' experience!!  Like that 
in reply another calls rival school's comments as 'gArdabha 
gAna'...sarvajnAtman says there is no avidyA leSha in a jnAni (you 
yourself quoted that from siddhAnta kalpavalli) & aparOksha anubhuti, a 
prakaraNa granTha rejects prArabdha karma to the jnAni,and more 
importantly there is not even a single place where shankara says there is 
an 'avidyAlesha' in samyak jnAni ( linking prArabdha karma, saMskAra 
vashAt etc. to avidyA lesha is a different issue altogether &  badly need 
further deliberation).     If I stretch the above 'experiencewise writing' 
till further, shankara with his 'own' experience refuted pUrvamImAmsa, 
pAshupata, bhAgavata mata-s and established shruti siddhAnta 
Atmaikatva..Later on, AchArya-s from dualistic schools like rAmAnuja, 
mAdhva etc. came out with a fresh set of thoughts and again with their 
'own' experience refuted shankara's advaita vedAnta...Ofcourse, these 
masters are celebrities in their own tradition and well known as 
self-realized masters!!  So, fact remains that all socalled self 
realization experiences & experiencers are NOT uniform in their scheme of 
thoughts & way of presentation...Under these circumstances, it is very 
difficult to adjudge who writes what contrary to 'own' experience.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
