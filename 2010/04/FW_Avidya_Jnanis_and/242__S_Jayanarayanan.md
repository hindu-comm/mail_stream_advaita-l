I really respect Sri Subhanu, but I cannot help but disagree at least partially with this post.

No one, as far as I know, admits of degrees of saMyak-GYAna.

BUB 1.4.7 talks of avidyA remaining undestroyed even after saMyak-GYAna.

What a convenient (mis)interpretation!

If Sankara's statements seem to be in line with one's own personal view, quote the statement and boldly claim that it is "Sankara's mUla siddhAnta"!

If Sankara's statements are dead against one's personal view, imagine that it must have been meant as a "concession" to someone else's (presumably inferior) "way of thinking"!

Remarkable reasoning indeed!
