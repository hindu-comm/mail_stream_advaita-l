praNAms Sri Subbu prabhuji
Hare Krishna

1. Avidya/Maya are not different from each other.  You may await my 
posting
an article on this here.

>  happy to note that...hope you would take care of my objections & 
problems (in accepting avidyA & mAya are synonyms  written in advaitin 
list) while drafting your article.

2. Avidya/Maya is bhAvarUpa

>  Hope while explaining bhAvarUpa mUlAvidya you would get the quotes from 
paNchapAdika vivaraNa...It seems for the concept of mUlAvidyA you have an 
entirely different interpretation of your own which differs from the 
vivaraNa school of thought.  I have panchapAdika book written in Kannada 
by Sri SSS with original Sanskrit quotes..

3. It is unreal (mithyA).  This means it is not of the nature of a hare's
horn, etc.

>  In other words, it is satya (OK vyAvahArikally) when it is satya in 
vyavahArika drushti and which has no existence in pAramArthika drushti, 
from which stand point you are telling this avidyA is mithya (unreal)?? 

4. Such a thing can produce effects. These effects are perceivable.  Their
having 'sattaa' amsha in them does not make them pAramArthika satya.  Nor
does it render them akin to a hare's horn.  It is called vyAvahArika 
satya.

>  It all depends upon your definition of bhAvarUpa avidyA which is 
jnAnavirOdhi, jadAtmika which is neither saMskArarUpa nor jnAnAbhAva and 
which is anAdi dependent upon chatanyasatta..

Hope you would address all these issues with an appropriate quotes from 
shankara's prasthAna trayi bhAshya.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
