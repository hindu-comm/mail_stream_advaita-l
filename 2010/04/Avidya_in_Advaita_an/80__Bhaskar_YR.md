Have you replied this mail prabhuji??  kindly let me know...I think it is 
important to get your clarification with regard to 'An unreal entity 
producing the effects which are perceivable'...Your clarification would 
help me to understand your stand on mUlAvidyA.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!

In the ‘gumma’ phenomenon we have a fine example of:

1. An unreal entity

2. Producing effects that are perceivable

> So you are agreeing here that an unreal entity (avidyA) can produce the 
effects (saMsAra or mAya) that are perceivable.  So, as per above, due to 
avidyA the production of 'effects' in the form of saMsAra happens..So, 
avidyA leads to mAya & avidyA is NOT mAya coz. avidyA is an unreal entity 
whereas its effects that are perceivable has the satta part in it!! Can 
you really justify your claim (1) that avidyA is unreal entity even after 
reading the theories that advocate avidyA is jadAtmika, upAdAna kAraNa to 
adhyAsa??

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
