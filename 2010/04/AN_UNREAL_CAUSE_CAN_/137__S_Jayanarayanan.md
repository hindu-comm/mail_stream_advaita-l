It cannot. H.H. Chandrasekhara Bharati Mahaswamigal of Sringeri says quite emphatically that the Absolute cannot "become realized" - because IT is ALWAYS KNOWN. The Self is always shining with true Wisdom, so only Avidya can be removed.

(Extract of a Talk from "The Saint of Sringeri", page 236)

Disciple: If the Self is this ever existing and ever shining, where is the need for any effort to realise it?

H.H.: Certainly there is no need at all.

Disciple: But we do not perceive the Self now. How can it be said that no effort is required?

H.H.: If it is not perceived, effort is required to get rid of that non-perception. No effort is necessary for perceiving the Self but effort is necessary to get over the non-perception of it.

Disciple: Does this not mean virtually that effort is necessary for perceiving the Self?

H.H.: No. The destruction of Avidya is alone the result of effort. ALL KINDS OF SPIRITUAL EFFORT DETAILED IN THE VEDAS ARE AIMED ONLY AT DESTROYING AVIDYA AND NOT AS MEANS OF REALISING THE SELF.

Note that H.H. firmly takes the stand that the Self is ***EVER-SHINING AND ALWAYS KNOWN***.

Besides, the subject line is not correct. The correction is that an unreal cause CANNOT bring about a real effect. Here's a line from Sankara's Upadeshasaashrii:

AtmA hyAtmiiya ityeSha bhAvo.avidyAprakalpitaH .
Atmaikatve hyasau nAsti bIjAbhAve kutaH phalam.h ..

Swami Jagadananda's translation:

"For the ideas 'me' and 'mine' are superimposed on the Self due to Ignorance. They do not exist when the Self is known to be one only. HOW CAN THERE BE AN EFFECT WITHOUT A CAUSE?"

Sankara's phrase "bIja-abhAve kutaH phalam.h" is translated (rightly) by Swami Jagadananda as "How can there be an effect without a cause?".

If anything, Sankara's statement above actually proves that the "cause" of bhAva-rUpa-avidyA alone explains the "effect" of saMsAra! In other words, the effect of saMsAra *requires* a cause, which is bhAva-rUpa-avidyA!
