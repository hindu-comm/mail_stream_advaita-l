Nevertheless, I intend to discuss this sUtra and bhAshya in some detail, 
so
I will get started over the upcoming weekend.

sAshtAnga prANAms Sri Vidya prabhuji
Hare Krishna

Surprisingly & unfortunately, this time only 'firing' from you, no 
clarification from your goodself, normally you wont do that, especially 
with me prabhuji...I dont have to mention here, earlier days, you had 
enough patience to clarify my much more sillier  doubts on advaita 
doctrine & I'd still cherish those moments prabhuji.  It seems this time I 
might have hurt your sentiments with my fussy nature ..My apologies for 
that prabhuji...Henceforth, I would try to refrain myself from asking you 
those doubts prabhuji, you can just ignore my mails in this thread 
prabhuji.

Your humble servant
Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
