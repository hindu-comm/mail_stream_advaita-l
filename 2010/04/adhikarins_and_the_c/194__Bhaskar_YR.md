ShankarAchArya disagrees.  GYAna does result in mokSha in all cases but 
certain beings have been deputed by Ishvara to perform certain acts for 
the 
welfare of the universe.  (E.g. kR^iShNa dvaipAyana muni wrote the 
mahAbhArata including the gItA and the 18 purANas, etc.)  Until this karma 

is fulfilled, they will continue to remain embodied despite being GYAnis. 
Note this is different from karma that they themselves did before becoming 

enlightened.

My question for those currently debating (and of course anyone else who 
would like to venture an opinion) is what is your take on this sUtra? 
Does it  make you want to change your opinions in any way?

IMO, if we go by vAchyArtha of this sUtra commentary, we have to conclude 
that jeeva & Ishwara bedha is eternal & some set of jeeva-s, even after 
samyak jnAna (realizing that they are brahman) do have the adhikAra to do 
dharma prachAra through punarAvrutti janma as per the instruction of 
Ishwara. So, from this jeeva(s) is (are) always under the obligation of 
following the instruction of supreme god (paramAtma).    Since we are 
talking about special 'adhikAra' to ONLY some set of jeeva-s we have also 
to conclude that there is an eternal bedha in jeeva-jeeva...Since the 
individuality maintained even after dehapAta, these adhikAri jeeva-s are 
eternally would act like 'deva gaNa' and would incarnate time and again as 
and when Ishwara instructed them to do so...Though shankara says na cha 
vijnAnAtmA paramAtmanO vastvantaraM, we have to say that yes, jeeva is 
nothing but brahma, but this realization is like bubble realizing that it 
is nothing but water but it maintains the individuality like 'bubbliness' 
even though it is nothing but water.  I think this individuality in the 
form of bubbliness (jeeva) is required and must to follow the instruction 
of water (paramAtma)
