This is a very apt cross-reference within the sUtrabhAshya in the context
of the discussion on jnAna, jnAnIs and prArabdha karmA.

Bhaskar, please clarify the above. IYO, is Sankara bhagavatpAda accepting
jIva-jIva and jIveSvara bheda in special cases only, thereby contradicting
himself deliberately/unintentionally? What do you mean by vAchyArtha of
the commentary? Do you mean that we have to apply a lakshaNArtha to the
bhAshya in order to understand it so as to remove this contradiction? If so,
what is this lakshaNArtha? What does Sri SSS say about this sUtra and its
bhAshya?
I will save my own thoughts on this adhikaraNa for later, but it seems to me
that you are under a fundamental misunderstanding here.
