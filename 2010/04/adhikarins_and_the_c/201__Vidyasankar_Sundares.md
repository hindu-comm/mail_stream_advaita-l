Bhaskar, I am going to ask you to read my posts carefully and not put
words into my mouth that I did not utter and that I have no intention
of ever uttering.

I did NOT say what you imply above. Your inference about what meaning
there is or isn't in Sankara's texts is baseless. I was responding to Smt.
Savithri Devaraj's contention about exceptions proving the rule. Any fault
that you see in my response is based on the same misunderstanding that
you have about Sankara bhagavatpAda's bhAshya on this sUtra. It is my
contention that *as per her logic that allows such exceptions*, there is
a big problem, because even one exception will invalidate the general rule.

I have not yet said anything about the situation *as per my logic*, nor
have I yet had time to say more about what Sankara bhagavatpAda says
about it.

This whole argument about bheda and the defeating of Atmaikatva again
is your misunderstanding and an imputation of a position to me that I
have never held. On a lighter note, I thought you understood better at
least those who have the title of cyber-guruji thrust upon them by you!

You are welcome to read eternal bheda into the sUtra in question, but
please do not say that this is my position, and please do NOT say that
this is what Sankara bhagavatpAda also says. Let me reiterate, the
bhAshya is in NO need of any special saving of the fundamental Atmaikatva
from anybody. To think that the 'plain reading' is harmful to Atmaikatva and
to think that you have some special interpretation that is an improvement
upon it, is to imply that Sankara bhagavatpAda may have compromised his
fundamental teaching (or only made a small concession to empirical reality),
whereas you are not willing to make any compromise (or even that small
concession). In my book, this is the height of hubris and is based on a
total misunderstanding of the bhAshyakAra's teaching. What more neeed I
say about this?


Nevertheless, I intend to discuss this sUtra and bhAshya in some detail, so
I will get started over the upcoming weekend.



Vidyasankar
