No need for any pardon, Bhaskar. I only see a discussion here, not mere
argumentative-ness.

My take on this is simple. Sankara bhagavatpAda wrote whatever
he wrote in all his bhAshyas, without compromising Atmaikatva. That
tells me that your reading of the plain reading of the bhAshya 'as it is'
misunderstands the plain reading of the bhAshya 'as it is'. I see no
need to understand it in such a special way as to save the bhAshya
and bhAshyakAra from self-contradiction and compromise of the main
siddhAnta.

Yes, you can. The reason why I asked about Sri SSS is mainly that
I do not have his publications handy. I wanted to ensure that the
doubt was completely your own. No doubt it is informed by how
you understand the entire advaita discussion about prArabdha,
what happens (or should happen) to a jnAnI's deha and what the
 nature of samyag-jnAna is.

Not really, but that is a matter of perception. Rather than being in 
a hurry to disagree with you, I am fully aware that there is a lot of
history and background for our discussions on this list, which I take
into account. Anyway, I will take up this bhAshya passage in greater
detail in separate posts, over the course of the week. I have to take
time for work and family  responsibilities too, just like you!

Regards,

Vidyasankar
