My compliments to you. Changing one's opinion (matam is the word, but I am 
avoiding it to preclude any unnecessary controversies) is not an easy 
thing; it is great to know that you had done it. From the vehemence of 
your posts, I thought that was not possible. How mistaken I was! 

praNAms Sri Siva prabhuji
Hare Krishna

you can just imagine the efforts they ( Sri Vidya prabhuji & Sri Jaldhar 
prabhuji) have put in to move the immovable :-)) All credit should go to 
them prabhuji...it is my pUrva janma sukruta phala I came in contact with 
these two great personalities.  It is strange but true that I had to learn 
the basics in advaita through electronic media though there were abundant 
opportunities in & around my area :-))  But now the situation is like 
that, within advaita, I am not able to come to the terms with Sri vidya 
prabhuji and that is the reason why he is slapping me with that good old 
affection :-))

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
