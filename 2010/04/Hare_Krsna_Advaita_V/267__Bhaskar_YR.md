Namaste Bhaskarji,

>  praNAms Sri Krunal prabhuji
Hare Krishna


I have been a silent follower (more recently) of this forum and always am 
intrigued as to why you use 'hare krsna' as ur benedictory saying. Don't 
get me wrong each to their own with due respect but I would like to 
understand the 'why' and reason for you using it.

>  I think we two have interacted before in some other forum!!  Anyway, 
with regard to your query, I believe instead of starting my mails with 
formal Hi, Hellow, Mr., Mrs. etc. etc. it is better to remember everytime 
paramAtma, you know, we, the saMsArins hardly would get any time to do 
paramAtma dhyAna!!  atleast this is a small attempt to do 'likhita japa'. 
Why only hare krisha?? well, this is the style I am accustomed to ever 
since I started writing in cybernet. That's it prabhuji. 


If I'm not mistaken the 'hare krsna' saying is mainly used by those 
belonging to the gaudiya vaishnav sect influenced by caitanya mahaprabhu. 

> that's right...but my relationship with gaudeeya-s is a bygone history 
now!!..the only thing I brought while coming out from that school is 'Hare 
Krishna' mahA maNtra. 

However their philosophy does attempt (attempt being the key word) to 
belittle the advaita philosophy at any chance. 
>  Even I used to!!  But two stalwarts in this list Sri Vidya prabhuji, 
(who is now firing me left and right for my misunderstanding & 
misrepresenting advaita vedAnta :-)) and Sri Jaldhar Vyas prabhuji have 
tirelessly helped me a lot to come out from the dogmatic philosophy of 
prabhupada's Hare Krishna movement.

I think what I'm trying to get at is: the 'hare krsna' welcome is great 
and is accepted by all advaitins alike to us its just another name of 
salutations to each brethren but for the gaudiya movement the resistance 
towards to 'maya vada' is great. How are you influenced, if you at all are 
and marry the two which are in a continuing philosophical battle?

>  For me this battle is already over and now I hold shankara's Atmaikatva 
vidya / philosophy is the final verdict of shruti mAta..I may argue with 
traditional or orthodox advaitins here in this forum, it is because 
advaita where I've been taught, studied, learnt is slightly different from 
that of traditional one..Atleast those who mainly engage in these 
discussions with me know that my intention is not to belittle the 
shankara's philosophy..At the worst, they can only think I've 
misunderstood & misrepresenting the advaita vedanta :-))

Hare krsna :)
Krunal

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
