This is exactly my position too.

It is not 'usual' for me to make a quote 'out of context'.   What can be a
better context than this for me to quote the one that I did than this:

(quted by Smt. Savithri Devaraj) :

He concludes adhyAsa bhAshya thus - "asyAnarthahetoH prahANAya atmaikatva
vidyA pratipattaye sarve vedAnta Arabhyante| yathA cAyamarthaH sarveSAm
vedAntAnAm tathA vayamasyAm sArirakamImAmsAyAm pradarshayiShAmaH |" This
blunder (mutual super imposition of Atma-anAtma) is the cause of all world
delusion. All upanishads begin to destroy this ignorance completely and
teach self knowledge. We will proceed to show how this is understood to be
the central teaching of all upanishads through this sArirakamImAmsa.
[Translation is mine]

This is indeed the context of bandha and moksha.
