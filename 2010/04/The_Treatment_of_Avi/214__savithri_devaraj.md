This is flawed thinking and ignoring shankara's dictum in my humble opinion.

As is well known, the prasthAnatraya are three journeys - upanishads being the sruti prasthAna, gIta being the smruti prasthAna and brahmasUtras being the nyAya prasthAna. brahmasUtras were mainly written by vyAsa to bring about one voice and unity in the teachings of the upanishads, and to make it easier for his disciples to remember the essense of the upanishads in short sUtras. This being the case, I would say the sUtra prasthAna has more authority on the meaning of avidya/adhyAsa than the possible different meanings in the different upanishads from different rishis at different times. 

In addition, Acharya shankara found it necessary to write the adhyAsa bhAshya in the begining of his brahmasUtra bhAshya specifically to emphasize this uniform meaning of adhyAsa/avidya in the upanishads. Don't you think this is significant? We have to respect that and study the upanishads from this perspective only. He concludes adhyAsa bhAshya thus - "asyAnarthahetoH prahANAya atmaikatva vidyA pratipattaye sarve vedAnta Arabhyante| yathA cAyamarthaH sarveSAm vedAntAnAm tathA vayamasyAm sArirakamImAmsAyAm pradarshayiShAmaH |" This blunder (mutual super imposition of Atma-anAtma) is the cause of all world delusion. All upanishads begin to destroy this ignorance completely and teach self knowledge. We will proceed to show how this is understood to be the central teaching of all upanishads through this sArirakamImAmsa. [Translation is mine]

Enough said. This must be sufficient to conclude adhyAsa = avidya in all upanishads?
