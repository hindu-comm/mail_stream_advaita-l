praNAms
Hare Krishna

In my considered opinion, it is a premature, hurried and flawed conclusion 
on those who have
determined that 'according to Shankara 'avidya' is only adhyAsa'.

>  Just a small clarification, according to shankara & Sri SSS avidya is 
NOT only adhyAsa but avidyA is also adhyAsa...As you know this will make 
lot of trouble to those who uphold the theory which propagates the 
material cause for adhyAsa & equating mAya with avidya.

Since you spoke about the supremacy of the nyAya prasthana, let me quote 
one
more popular saying:

mAnDUkyam ekameva alam mumukShUNAm vimuktaye - the Mandukya upanishad 
alone
is sufficient for liberation.

>  Again, as usual, out of context quote!!  here what we are doing is 
discussion (you may term it as debate) not the liberation...Yes, for the 
liberation, for a yOgya adhikAri why need even mAndUkya, only one sentence 
tattvamasi is more than enough is it not??..why on the earth you have to 
split your hair to prove there is upAdAna kAraNa for adhyAsa :-))

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
