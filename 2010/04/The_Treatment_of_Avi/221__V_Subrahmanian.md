Dear Bhaskar ji,

Gold  takes  the form of  bangle, chain and ring.  Supposing I write an
article  on a chain of gold, does that  warrant the conclusion that  gold
can be *only  a chain *and nothing else?

The Acharya has stated in the most unambiguous terms in the Gita bhashya
13th chapter that Avidya  manifests in *three  different* forms: agrahana,
vipareeta grahana and samshaya.  A variation of this is stated by Him in the
Br.Up.Bhashya using the word ajnAna.  In the prelude to the Brahma sutra,
stating the samsara  kaaranam,  He has deliberated on *just one of the three
forms of Avidya.*  This does not warrant the jettisoning of the other
bhashya vakyas on Avidya and its three different forms  to facilitate the
shortsighted view of avidya = adhyasa alone.

There is quite evidently a difference of understanding of the above status
of avidya among the followers of SSS.  Bhaskar ji had been vehemently
arguing, as is Madam Savithri now, that avidya means only adhyasa.  When the
other bhashya vakyas proving the contrary were continuously highlighted,
Bhaskar ji has now taken a retreat in his stand and admitted that 'avidya is
adhyasa also'.

The Acharya has not chosen to delve on the cause of adhyAsa in the
'tametam..' vaakya since He has already stated that in no uncertain terms in
the beginning of the preamble:  मिथ्याज्ञाननिमित्तः.  By this term the
Acharya has given the cause of adhyAsa: ajnAna which is mithyA,
anirvachaneeya, sadasad vilakshana.  This is the upAdaana kAraNa for
adhyAsa.  This is jaDaatmika since it is viShaya for the Atma (Gita bhasya
13.2).  It is jnAnavirodhi in the sense that it succeeds in subduing the
svarUpa jnAnam by its aavaraNashakti.  The vikshepashakti of this mithyA
ajnAna is what is called 'adhyAsa'.

You are mistaken.  There are several places where adhyAsa is given a fairly
good treatment.  Mandukya kArikas are an indisputable source for this.

You are wrong.  The preamble to the Brahmasutra bhashya is NOT a document on
bandha alone; it is indisputably an exegesis of bandha and moksha.
Immediately after the (SSS favorite) sentence: .... एवंलक्षणमध्यासं पण्डिताः
अविद्येति मन्यन्ते, the Acharya specifies the avidyAvirodhi, namely the
viveka jnAna that dispells this bandha kAraNa: तद्विवेकेन च
वस्तुस्वरूपावधारणं विद्यामाहुः. Thus, in one breath, the Acharya talks about
bandha AND moksha disproving the erroneous view that the 'adhyasa bhashya'
talks about/highlights bandha alone and reiterating the fact that in Vedanta
the discussion of bandha and moksha are not disparate.

Subsequent to the above sentences, in several other places, repeatedly the
Acharya is contrasting the condition of adhyasa from the adhyasa-free state
in explicit sentences.  Again, a very famous vaakya there is: न
वेदान्तवेद्यं अशनायाद्यतीतं अपेतब्रह्मक्षत्रादिभेदं असंसार्यात्मतत्त्वं
....This is a very clear teaching of the moksha svarUpa.  He goes on to talk
of the anyonya adhyasa thereby making the bandha-moksha svarUpa an
inseparable feature of the discussion. Bandha svarupa cannot be taught
without contrasting it with moksha svarUpa.

There is absolutely no justification to claim that the adhyAsa bhaashya is a
'specialized treatment of avidya' warranting the consigning of the other
ShAnkaran comprehensive definitions of avidya to the garbage bin.  An
analysis as shown in the Article by taking ALL the significant sentences of
the Acharya on Avidya reveals the weak ground on which the SSS understanding
of 'avidya is adhyasa alone' is founded.  For those who demand the prasthana
traya bhashya vaakya for any and every concept of Vedanta that is not
palatable to them, here is a glaring instance of the flip-flop where the
very prasthana traya bhashya is mercilessly cut up and the unwanted,
uncomfortable, portions thrown away.

I have shown the relevance, not with my words, but with the very sentences
of the Acharya, and that too, from that very document to prove that your
contention is baseless.

Your complete misunderstanding of the entire discussion and the very purport
of the preamble to the BSB is now there for all to see.

By that Shankara is NOT saying that Avidya is not agrahana and samshaya.
Your averment puts you in the danger of accusing the Acharya of
contradicting Himself when He says one thing in the adhyAsa bhashya and
quite another in the Gita and Br.Up and Mandukya bhashyas.

Everyone can now see whose theory is floating, only to sink very soon.

Thank you for placing my article in the company of the Upanishads and the
Brahma sutras and the Acharya's Bhashya-s thereon.  For, is it not a fact
that the proliferation of schools opposed to Advaita as also within Advaita
has its ground in the 'doubts' that the Upanishads, etc. have generated?
The Brahmasutras themselves have for their subject matter a  number of
doubts in understanding the Upanishadic passages apparently contradicting
each other.  The Acharya's Bhashyas have become the source of doubts that
has resulted in so much of heated discussion.  Above all, SSS's book:
'Shankara, the most misunderstood...' is evidence to show that the Bhashya
is misunderstood by SSS himself. How many post-ShAnkaran schools we have -
the Bhamati, the VivaraNa, the Holenarasipur, etc.

So, my article is not alone in this. And you have questioned the fool-proof
status of the Upanishads and the Acharya's bhashyas by your logic: A
document that generates doubts in its readers is not to be regarded as fool
proof and not universally acceptable.  What a great service you have
rendered to the Veda parampara and the Acharya!!

By making a comment on my Article, you have unwittingly commented on the
comprehending capacity of Savithri Madam.  For, has she not ended up with
'doubts' after reading my Article according to you?

You have now seen the 'justification' for your out of scope comments.

You have not told me  SSS's interpretation of *samskAra vashaat*, if at all
he has one. Nobody so far has given me the reply to my question: What does
SSS understand by the above term in the Bhashya?  It is his and not his
followers' interpretation that I am looking for.

The Acharya and Sureshwrara have not left us in the want of analogies to
understand the 'bAdhita mithyAjnAna anuvRtti'; we have  several of them:
double-moon, released arrow, chakra bhramaNa.  Your analogies do not add
anything to our understanding of the concept which is quite clear with the
analogies already available.  In fact, your 'fan rotating and jihvA
chaapalya' examples miserably militate against what you are contending: the
persistence of samskara.

You were the one who fought against prAradha karma.  Now you have admitted
it;  a move in the right direction.  I have noticed SSS's discomfiture with
the Bhashya vaakya-s on prArabdha.  He strains himself so awfully to
provide  footnotes to tell people that 'this position is based on the *
possibility* that the body could remain for some time to experience the
praarabdha...But in reality the Jnani's state is altogether free from....'
Why all this circus?  Where has Shankara even remotely suggested that the
acceptance of prArabdha is conditional and the Jnani's state is something
'different'?  SSS' s footnote for the Bhashya sentence: 'prArabdha is
inevitable for the Jnani' in the Chandogya Upanishad 6.14.2 is a glaring
evidence, apart from the ones for BSB 4.1. 15.  He moves heaven and earth
grouping all prarabdha-sutras and shruti vaakyas to somehow impose his
personal (mis)understanding of the Vedanta and misinterpreting the Bhashya
on his readers, misleading them pitifully.  Shankara never gives even a hint
anywhere in the prasthAna traya bhAshya to warrant such an erroneous
thinking.
