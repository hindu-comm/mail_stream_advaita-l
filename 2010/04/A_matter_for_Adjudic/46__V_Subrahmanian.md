I do not need more proof than what I quoted yesterday: the appeal by SSS's
disciple Swami to teach the Acharya's Bhashya without resorting to the
vyAkhyAna-s.  There is no doubt about who has influenced him to do so.  I
have not said that SSS aired his views against the post Shankara advaitins
in order to gain recognition; this is not at all factual.  His slogan: 'Go
back to Shankara' and the like are enough tell tale evidences of his
attitude towards the commentaries.  That influence on his followers is also
not something that can be covered up.

I do not see any copyright for Purandaradasa songs.  They have been in
public domain for centuries.  In fact it is only non-advaitins that have
made many of those songs internationally popular by singing them in various
fora.  The Upanishads that are One have been commented by various Acharyas
to 'match their books' and not to please anyone else.  There is nothing
wrong in my viewing Purandara Dasa's songs to suit my tastes.

I still do not see what you are driving at by the two types of anubhava.
For me, and for everyone, Brahmaanubhava is svaanubhavaika vedyam.  It is
not that you get the experience and I also get liberated;  it is each and
every individual's vaiyaktika prayatna and sadhana and siddhi.  There is no
sArvatrika here.  I shall give you a short account of a Divine Leela of Lord
Shiva, in the Tamil Desha, to illustrate what I understand by your term
'saarvatrika anubhava':

A Tamil King had ordered that every citizen should participate in a
collective damming work; with each person allotted a certain length of the
dam to work.  An old lady who could not do this was worried how she can meet
the order of the King.  Lord Shiva mercifully decided to help her and came
to her as a young able-bodied man.  He undertook to do her portion of the
work.  But He idled away without doing the work.  When the King was reported
that only one portion of the job remained undone, this Man was identified as
the errant one.  The King decided to punish Him with lashes.  When the first
lash was dealt on Him, everyone, including the King experienced the lash on
their backs and winced in pain.  This is a demonstration of sArvatrika
anubhava.  No such thing is possible in Vedanta.  It is always individual;
one for himself.

An advaitin will claim Advaitic experience after his individual anubhava and
a dvaitin will claim a dvaitic experience after his individual anubhava.
Both will assert that they have followed the shAstra.  There is no way that
there will be an agreement just because you want to float a concept of
'sArvatrika anubhava'.

Also, all advaita Jnanis will have the undifferentiated Brahma anubhava.  It
is only if this is admitted you can account for: shrotriyam brahmaniShTham.
Only because there is no difference in their anubhava can Bhagavan assure
Arjuna: उपदेक्ष्यन्ति ते ज्ञानं ज्ञानिनः तत्त्वदर्शिनः.  It is the same
tattva darshana that is had by every one who exerts individually and has the
experience in his 'own' meditation.  And this is what I suppose you are
saying below.  Even there, each vaiyaktika anubhava, if it has been done on
the proper lines, will result in the pUrNAnubhava only.  Without this one is
not an aparoksha jnAni.  Even if only the tvam padaartha has been realized,
it is only a-pUrNa anubhava.  And once the PUrNaanubhava is there, one
cannot distinguish one Jnani from another on the basis of the pUrNatva of
the anubhava.

No one will admit 'indriyanubhava' of senses of taste, form,etc. as Vedantic
anubhava.  And for 'vedana anubhava', the Acharya's words are there: 'sva
hRdaya pratyayam brahma vedanam'.  This is perfectly valid. Your
explanation, therefore, amounts to nothing; it does not clarify anything.
It only confounds the matter.  In any case, you have written a fine
commentary above on this Kenopanishad bhashya of our Acharya:

// The Kenopanishad II.i. 1 and 2 mantras speak of this.
Shankara describes the transformation the student/sadhaka undergoes
between the first mantra and the second one,  dramatically: evam
AchAryoktaH shiShyaH yEkAnte upaviShTaH samAhitaH san, yathOktam
AchAryeNa AgamArthato vichaarya, tarkatashcha nirdhArya,
*SVAANUBHAVAM* KRUTVAA, AchAryasakAsham upagamya uvAcha : manye aham atha
idAnIm viditam Brahma iti. (After having been told so by the Teacher, the
disciple sat in solitude with his mind concentrated,
deliberated, made It a matter of* personal experienc*e* *and
approached the teacher (in the class) and said: `Now I think Brahman
is known'.) //

We  can talk about this sArvatrika anubhava later..but first do note that

You can very well see from my explanation above that your classification is
wrong and only sva-anubhava gamya jnAna alone is valid in Vedanta - brahma
jijnAsaa.

I have already explained it; it is definitely one, not 'some', individual's
unique experience, at a particular point of time, that alone matters in
Vedanta sadhana.  The word 'unique' is not that each jnani has a different
'kind' of experience; in that respect alone all  Jnanis have the experience
of the One and the same Aupanishada Brahman.  If this is what you are
driving at, then we do not differ at all.

For you samAdhi is un-Vedantic.  So, why include samAdhi in your
discussion?  i have not said sarvOham or pUrNoham is avasthA vishesha
jnAna....What I have said is it is realized that way in the akhandAkAra
vRtti and then that becomes his natural anubhava.

I would be thankful to you if you can present to me the Shankara bhashya
quotes in support of your classification.  I am sure I have re-presented
your classification in tune with reasoning.

In the Patanjali system, what we in Advaita call: the tvam padArtha, is
itself the ultimate.  For them the Brahma-jivAtma aikya sAkshAtkAra is not
there.  It is just prakRti-puruSha viveka.  He realizes he is different from
prakRti.  That is puruShArtha for them.

Let me clarify: I should have used the term: nAnA-Atma instead of
nAnA-jeeva.  In Patanjali system there is Atma-nAnAtva unlike in vedanta
where there is Only One Brahman-Atman.  See the Acharya's Gita bhashya:
2.12. देहभेदानुवृत्त्या बहुवचनं, न आत्मभेदाभिप्रायेण.

So, in view of this clarification, your notes on AdhikArika puruSha are not
in the right context.  I am sorry for not being specific in my terminology;
I took it for granted that in Advaitic circles this meaning is easily
recognized even when the term nAnaa-jeeva is used.
