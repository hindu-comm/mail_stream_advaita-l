Who has avidya before jnAna - the embodied spirit as a result of 
mis-apprehension, and when this embodied spirit assumes pramatrutva and 
strives to remove avidya by all the known means, the final transaction 
removes the mis-apprehension and the pramatrutva. This is the 
adhyaropa-apavada that Shankara talks of in chapter 13 of BG also. When 
pramtrutva/agentship is gone, what is left is jada, a burnt seed.

The vidya,  no matter whether it is first one or last one or continuous 
one which removes avidyA without any trace is called jnAna says shankara 
in bruhad bhAshya....after samyak jnAna there is no question of avidyA 
lesha.....if there is any lesha of that avidyA then there is no samyak 
jnAna...

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
