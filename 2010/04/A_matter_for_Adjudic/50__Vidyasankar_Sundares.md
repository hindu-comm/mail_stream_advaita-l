I don't know if the bhAgavatam characterizes the ardent devotee as a dvaitin.

In any case, this is an attitude that an advaitin can take, but the dvaitin will
not! Don't you think that an ardent dvaitin will reject the advaita jnAna even
when bhagavAn kRshNa himself stands in front and imparts it?!!



Regards,

Vidyasankar
