praNAms 
Hare Krishna

a) that Sri Sachidanandendra Saraswathi and his followers do not say that 
Jagadguru Sri Suresvaracharya have not properly understood what Sri 
Sankara said.  

> yes, this is one of those vipareeta grahaNa-s of saMpradAyavAdins :-)) 
Sri SSS is of the opinion that unlike panchapAdikAkAra, Sri Sureshwara is 
near to bhAshyAkAra in his vArtika prasthAna.  Sri SSS clarifies further 
that there is no significant & objectionable difference between 
bhAshyakAra & vArtikakAra in vedAntic methodology. 

(b) That Swamigal does not hold "Anubhava" to be the "kingpin"; this is a 
wrong quote about him. 

>  Ofcourse, Swamiji insisted the importance of sArvatrika pUrNAnubhava in 
the brahma jignAsa & argued why vaiyuktikAnubhava (individual/personal 
experiences like asamprajnAtha or nirvikalpa samAdhi) cannot be considered 
as one of the pramANa-s in brahma jignAsa....But point to be noted here is 
it is not at all at the cost of shruti as antya pramANa. 

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
