Would you think that the Dvatin do not understand the meaning of the Sayyujya Mukti (to be one with the Lord or to merge with the Lord), which Lord Rama offered to Hanumana, which the latter rejected temporarily saying that he enjoyed taking Lord Rama's name than the Sayyujya Mukti. It is more surprising considering that Madhvacharyaclaimed to havea filial relationship with Hanumana.

I don't know if the bhAgavatam characterizes the ardent devotee as a dvaitin.

In any case, this is an attitude that an advaitin can take, but the dvaitin will
not! Don't you think that an ardent dvaitin will reject the advaita jnAna even
when bhagavAn kRshNa himself stands in front and imparts it?!!
