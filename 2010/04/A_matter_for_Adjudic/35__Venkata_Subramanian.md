The subject matter for adjudication is quite interesting, but I am not sure whether the Adjudication can be done on this matter here in this forum!!. 

Of course Sri V Subrahmanian's postings were interesting; but the other point is also equally a matter of fact that precisely these and more objections have indeed been well discussed in chapter-2 the work "MulAvidya NirAsa" of Sri Sachidanandendra Saraswathi Swamigal; and then his reply is in Chapter-3.Therefore it is not that that Swamigal has concluded hastily something of such significance; while he should have been aware of what it means to say so boldly "that after Suresvara, what was said was not necessarily what Shankara and Suresvara said".

The problem in our attempt to adjudicate is thatthere sems to be no one, I repeat, who 
(a) has directly studied completely the Prastanatraya Bhashya and the Vartikas, under the Holenarsipuram Swamigal;
(b)hasa reasonably good English writing, 
(c) is aware of and can use these modern utilities like the internet and
(d) is having access to, the liking to engageand participate in such e-forums and represent that Swamigal's side clearly in a reasonably good English.

Thus one of the Pakshas not being represented at all properly, it would be unfair to adjudicate "ex partie" without even considering the other side reasonably well.There are a few exceptions like Subhanu Saxena and others but not a one like described above, which is necessary to represent their side so that we the members get immensly benefited for the "Adjudication".

Thanks & Regards,
Venkat.

Sadgurubhyo Namah.

I cannot help but agree with the last statement above. Truth, especially Vedantic Truth, cannot be decided by "majority vote".

Besides, the "adjudication" process requires a great scholar who is competent, impartial and **acceptable to both parties involved in the debate**. I doubt if such a person exists on this list.
