> Would you think that the Dvatin do not understand the meaning of the Sayyujya Mukti (to be one with the Lord or to merge with the Lord), which Lord Rama offered to Hanumana, which the latter rejected temporarily saying that he enjoyed taking Lord Rama's name than the Sayyujya Mukti.                                                                                                                            It is more surprising considering that Madhvacharya claimed to have a filial relationship with Hanumana.

As far as I understand, dvaitins have their own understanding of what the term sAyujya mukti means. In any case, these are questions which dvaitins would be better equipped to answerr, rather than us speculating about it, don't you think?
