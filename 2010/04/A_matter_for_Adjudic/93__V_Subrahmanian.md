As per Shri Bhaskar ji's above observation, if there is any 'anuvRtti',
continuation, of mithyAjnAna (which is the one that produced samsara), then
there is no samyak jnAna.  There should be no samskaara too.  A jnani
'suffering' from continued mithyAjnAna is admitted by SSS in the sutra
bhashya translation 4.1.15.
