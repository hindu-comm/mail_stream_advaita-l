Here we go again. A member is allowed to have and state an opinion, and take sides.

This is not side-stepping the argument. Let me try to be as clear as I can in my stand. The problem is that your definition of jnAni is different than mine. A jnAni has been cut asunder from the Body-Mind-Intellect, she has no trace of avidya left, pure secondless spirit. Whatever is left (if there is any merit/demerit left) belongs to the field, not the knower. 

Is the expectation that the agency that housed the embodied spirit should annhilate when the jnAni realized his/her true nature? Either there is jivanmukti or there is no such concept. You can't have it both ways as you say - there is avidya in the jnAni, but he may have nothing to do with it. You still see him in his previous form - there can be no embodiment of the jnAni. Who has avidya before jnAna - the embodied spirit as a result of mis-apprehension, and when this embodied spirit assumes pramatrutva and strives to remove avidya by all the known means, the final transaction removes the mis-apprehension and the pramatrutva. This is the adhyaropa-apavada that Shankara talks of in chapter 13 of BG also. When pramtrutva/agentship is gone, what is left is jada, a burnt seed. 
I cannot understand this concept of false duality of enligtened vs ignorant, and no one needs liberation in reality. There is no branding of enlightened as such - he doesn't even know he is realized, or behave any differently. He is absorbed as brahman. If this were duality, did you expect that one person attaining realization should confer brahmanhood on all beings so there is no duality of realized and unrealized?

If there is no ignorance where is the question of avidya-nasha, jnAna and avidya-lesha? Lets just say we are all realized and there is nothing to be done. Why are we discussing the hair-splitting details?

It may be so. I don't think there is a need to read 20 different commentators/authorities to understand a concept. 

I am not an academician, and neither should all become academicians. My problem is to figure a way out of samsaara, so I am a jignaasu. Those interested in history and the academics of advaita can pursue the lines above.

I do believe we differ here, we should agree to disagree and leave it at that. There are canons of literature which stand testimony to both sides, we as a list don't need to be bogged down by this again and again, unless you want to redefine the charter of the list. As has been mentioned by quite a few, there are no objective arbiters on this list. We have seen the consequence of these debates over the past 15 years - totally polarized with no conclusions. It is best to accept that otherscan state their understanding just as you do yours and co-exist. It may be better to embrace our common denominators and progress on our paths.

A sincere reader/jignasu doesn't need to be coaxed by the electronic list to do this. I hope they are doing this already.

Thanks, this will be my last post on this thread.
