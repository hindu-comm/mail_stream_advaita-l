I beg to differ, but it is not my role to teach you this in detail.  My only suggestion to anyone interested in this would be to approach a qualified teacher who has studied the Advaita-Siddhi, particularly the सत्तात्रैविद्ध्य section, and understand the proper definitions and analytical uses of व्यावहारिक, प्रातिभासिक, etc., from him.  For now, let us agree to disagree and leave it at that.
