Of course we can; e.g., we can say that the व्योमकमल is blue in color, and induce fear in a child or other person based on some characteristic of a तुच्छ (e.g., by saying that a शशविषाण is sharp and can cause grievous injury).  Your claim is backward, that a gumma is not अत्यन्तासत् because it has साधकत्व; by that standard, even a व्योमकमल or शशविषाण can be given some साधकत्व and called not अत्यन्तासत.  However, the gumma, like the व्योमकमल, does not have any of the three types of सत्ता -- it is an अत्यन्तासत् only, for it is not व्यावहारिक, प्रातिभासिक, and of course not पारमार्थिक.

This of course is also a characteristic of other तुच्छs such as शशविषाण; one could scour the world expecting to see one somewhere (if we were told that it existed).  A logically-inconsistent तुच्छ could be ruled out if one were sharp, but one might not know that something like a शशविषाण does not exist, and some false claim of its साधकत्व could be easily made.

However, the प्रातिभासिक requires the superimposition on something else (e.g., on a rope seen in poor light), whilst a gumma is not created by misperception of something else.  What is its substratum?  A निरधिष्ठान-भ्रान्ति is not possible (this is a difference between us and Buddhists) and in any event would not suffice to call it प्रातिभासिक.

Correct; which is true of a gumma as well -- who has seen it?
