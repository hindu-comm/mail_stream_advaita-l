[ Just in order not to give a misleading idea to the readers who have
followed this thread so far, I wish to make a clarification, before we close
this.]

[ I have very carefully studied the 'gumma' phenomenon and taken it up as a
defect-free dRShTAnta for the avidya of Vedanta.  If you go back to the
article and see, I have listed how many common points are there between the
two.  Let me assure you again: the gumma of Purandara Dasa is NOT  an
atyanta abhAva vastu like vandhyaaputra, etc. as you have understood it to
be.  Why? Because, it is able to create fear, etc. in the child and bring
about obedience, compliance, etc. from the child. A vandhyAputra cannot
even  be invoked by anyone even for creating the fear psychosis.  It would
be meaningless for anyone to do that.  I cannot say, even in gest - ’ Look,
the vandhyAputra with fierce looks is staring at you'.  I cannot give any
attributes to a totally non-existing vastu.

Only such a vastu cannot be a sAdhakatva of anything.  But the bhAvarUpa
gumma  definitely has sAdhakatva.  The proof of this is there in the song I
had presented, with audio: gummana kareyadire.  Krishna pleads with
Yashodha, don't ever call gumma, I shall do whatever you want me to.

Gumma turns out to be not existent *only* upon Krishna searching for it in
all the worlds, including VaikunTha.  The two songs prove that gumma, though
not ultimately real,  can be a saadhakatva of bhaya and upon searching for
it, not being available.  This is exactly of the status of a mithyA vastu:
the snake appears, creates fear, trembling, etc. but upon searching for it
turns out to be not there.

A tucchA vastu is not of this type; it never even appears.  That is why this
mithyA vastu is defined as : सत् - असत् - विलक्षण.  Gumma is of this type.
It is not sat, not tucchA, but an intermediary type:  it appears, creates
some effects but upon enquiry is not found to be existing.  I hoipe you
appreciate this.

Nowhere have we seen  in shAstra or loukika fields an atyanta abhaava vastu
being given as an example for a sAdhakatva.  The Avidya of the Vedanta is of
such a bhAva (not like the absolutely real Brahman) that can bring about the
effect of samsara and be dispelled through jnana.  If you say that only a
pAramArthika vastu can have saadhakatva (of anything), you will have to hold
ajnAna to be a pAramArthika vastu, equal in status with Brahman.  Such an
ajnAna can never be destroyed through jnana, even as Brahman can never
undergo nAsha.  There will be no way one can come out of samsara.

With this clarification, I retire.
