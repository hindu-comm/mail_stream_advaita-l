If you are presenting your own opinion, that is fine, but it would be as well to note that your views are not acceptable to either Madhva or Purandara Dasa (who do not accept the existence of a व्यावहारिक category at all), for which reason your analysis is rather ill-founded.  It is also worth noting that Madhva's reading of Bhagavad Gita II-12 (नत्वेवाहं जातु नासं न त्वं नेमे जनाधिपाः) and other authorities such as नित्यो नित्यानाम् rules out such reasoning as the following as representing his views:

The encyclopedia you have cited is providing an inaccurate and misleading summary, and thus does not form a firm-enough foundation on which to reason further.
