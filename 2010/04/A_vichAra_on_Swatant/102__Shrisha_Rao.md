Sure, which is precisely the point.  I also do wonder if your theories are even accurate as per Advaita, because you have invested Vishnu, the qualified Brahman, with पारमार्थिक-सत्यत्व, whilst the classical Advaitic authors (e.g., Madhusudana Saraswati that I am aware of) regard only the निर्गुण as being so, and the सगुण as also व्यावहारिक like the world.  Thus, you have achieved the feat of coming up with a Vedantic theory that is unacceptable to Advaitins as well as Dvaitins.

That's correct, it of course is.  They would not even be names or bare possibilities without Brahman's will.  In any case, I don't think that is particularly close to the Advaitic interpretation.  A proper excerpt of Madhva's view on that Shruti (which should be the sense conveyed by that URL) would be:

"वाचारम्भणं विकारो नामधेयं मृत्तिकेत्येव सत्यम्" (छा.उ. ६.१.४) इत्यत्र च `वाचा' नाम्नां `आरम्भणम्', `विकारः' अविकृतं नित्यं `नामधेयम् मृत्तिकेत्येव' इत्येतद्वचनं `सत्यं', इति श्रुत्यर्थः ।  न च `वाचारम्भण'शब्दोऽपि मिथ्यात्वे प्रसिद्धः | `वाचारम्भणमात्रम्' इति च अश्रुतकल्पनम् | तस्मिन्पक्षे, `नामधेय'शब्दः, `इति'शब्दश्च व्यर्थस्स्यात्? अतो, न कुत्रापि जगतो मिथ्यात्वमुच्यते |

A decent effort, but it should be improved with a proper study of the original sources, rather than taking off from some other summary.
