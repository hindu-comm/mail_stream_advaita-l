Pranams Shyam ji,

The above conclusion of yours is also my understanding of the ontology:
Brahman, the PAramArthika Satyam, is the Only Absolute Reality.  However, in
order to 'explain', 'account for' the created universe that is experienced,
the Vedanta is compelled to talk about 'another' entity, the Shakti, called
variously by the terms - MAyA, PrakRti, Avidya, AvyAkRta, etc.  This
'second' entity is only of a lower order of reality, ever-dependent on the
One Brahman.  With the temporary acceptance of this entity, no harm will
come to the Advaitic status of Brahman.

Best regards,
subbu
