That is not the case! The "state" mentioned in the above Upanishadic 
passage (BR^ihadaaraNyaka 4.3.22) is turIya and NOT deep sleep.

praNAms Sri Karthik prabhuji
Hare Krishna

No,  Sri Subbu prabhuji is right, this mantra is about 'sushuptAvasthA' 
not on tureeya...But atra veda aveda is not different in tureeyAvastha. So 
we can say both states are 'experience'wise one and the same and former is 
without jnAna & later is with jnAna.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!
bhaskar
