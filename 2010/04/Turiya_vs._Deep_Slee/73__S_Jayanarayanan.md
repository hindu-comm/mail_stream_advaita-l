Granted, the BU verse 4.3.22 is with reference to Deep Sleep. Even in the previous verse, Sankara points out that the Deep Sleep state is different from the True State of the Self (turIya).

But the Dasha Shloki verse referred to is certainly about the turIya state, as it specifically speaks of the Nature of the Self, which is free from tamas (unlike the Deep Sleep state).
