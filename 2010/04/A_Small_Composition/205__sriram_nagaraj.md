Dear List Member,

By the Grace of Goddess Sharadamba and Sri Kanchi Mahaperiyava, I was able to pen down the following lines.

Cheshtalo Api Balasya Matha Thu Vastra Rajakii |
Chittopi Mala Jalika Yasya Shodhanam Kuru Sharade || 


I know there are Samskrita Vidvaans among the members, I would like to hear their valuable feedback.

Jaya Jaya Shankara Hara Hara Shankara

Sriram Nagaraj

--The inner Light illuminates our minds--
