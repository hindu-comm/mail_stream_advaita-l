Actually, the 'state' mentioned in the above Upanishadic passage is deep
sleep.  As already stated, this state is cited as an illustration for the
state of liberation.  For, in deep sleep there is no explicit duality of any
kind.  All identities are lost, as it were.  One can get an idea of the
state of liberation when the deep sleep state is looked into.  That is the
purpose of citing it.

The following verse from Shankaracharya's 'Dashashloki' makes it clear:

    na cha tvaM na chaahaM na chaayaM prapaJNchaH .

        "There is no Preceptor nor Scripture, no pupil nor training.
There is no YOU nor I. This universe is not. For the realistion
of the true nature of the Self does not tolerate any distincion.
That One, the Residue, the Auspicious, the Alone, am I."
