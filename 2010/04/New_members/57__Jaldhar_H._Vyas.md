Akash

Akash Maharaj is a spiritual teacher and equally a student. He loves the 
Great Traditions, Spiritual Realisers and Teachers. His life is committed to 
practices, which prevent tendencies that restrict the ever-present flow of 
love. He has no dilemma about having an ego, being a somebody or nobody, 
being here, now or later?

Akash considers himself to be a 28 year-old South African -Londoner, 
infatuated with timeless wisdom, teasing him into the realisation that Love 
is all that really matters, Now and Now and Now. He is interested in sharing 
his heart and mind with all those who have already noticed the ?crack in the 
matrix?. Akash is currently working on his forthcoming book "Seeking Surrender".
