Shyam

I am an aspirant in search of helping myself and would like 
to keep in touch with like minded people.

Regards

My parents converted to Hinduism when I was a small child due, mainly, to 
the teachings of the Vedanta Society.  I have not found a beleif system that 
so closely expresses the beleifs I hold in my heart.  While it is rarely to 
have an American family convert to Hinduism I found myself as an adult still 
continuing to come back home to the faith of Vedanta.  I am married now and 
my husband is from India and we would love to found a group of Vedantic 
Hindus in the Cincy area to raise our child in our beleifs.

'm Boris from ex-USSR. Very interested in Advaita-Vedanta. I have read some 
Upanisads translated by Swami Nikhilananda, Bhagavad Gita translated by 
Swami Sivananda and have been reading Brahma Sutras translated and commented 
by Swami Sivananda.

The Advaita List archives are very interesting for me. So I decided to 
subscribe in order to read your posts regularly and to have an opportunity 
to ask a question occasionally.

Best regards
