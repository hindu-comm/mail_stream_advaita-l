praNAmaH,

madhusUdana sarasvatI is said to have spent almost His entire adult
life in vAraNAsi. He was from modern day Bengal (vaNGa-desha). I am
not sure how he would be associated with kAnchi mutt. Further, the
sarasvatI is one of the suffixes of dashanAmi tradition, which too is
independent of kAnchi mutt.
