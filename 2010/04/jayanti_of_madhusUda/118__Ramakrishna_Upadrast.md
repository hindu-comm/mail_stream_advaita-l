namaste,

I would like to know when is the jayanti of madhusUdana sarasvatI
celebrated and where? I could not locate it in the Sringeri Calendar.

Also, what is the method by which one interprets the changes in
jayanti's of aachaarya-s with respect to changes in calendars
(amaavaasyaant/pUrNimaant etc.)?
