I just wanted to add a conclusion to my last post. If a person has Realization of the Self

at the time of death, then, obviously, there is no prArabdha karma for the body to 

continue after such Realization. Nor is there any avidyAlesha for this person. And there

is no jIvanmukti, but the person attains videha mukti directly.



Anand
