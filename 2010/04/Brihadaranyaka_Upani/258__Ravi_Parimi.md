I am looking for a book that contains Suresvaracharya's vartika on the
Brihadaranyaka Upanishad (English translation preferred). I have Dr.
Balasubramaniam's book of the Taittiriya Upanishad vartika and am
curious to know if he also composed one based on Suresvara's vartika
on the Brihadaranyaka?

Additional info such as publisher's name, bookstores where the book
can be purchased etc. will be greatly helpful.

Thanks
