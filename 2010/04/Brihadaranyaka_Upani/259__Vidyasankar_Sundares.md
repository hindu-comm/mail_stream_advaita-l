To my knowledge, there is no one publication with an English translation
of the bRhad vArttika. There are some 11-12 books written by K. P. Jog
and Shoun Hino, which take up the vArttika on a per chapter (brAhmaNa)
basis and provide text, translation and extensive discussion, published by
Motilal Banarsidass under their Advaita Tradition Series. Many of these
seem to be available online through various vendors.
