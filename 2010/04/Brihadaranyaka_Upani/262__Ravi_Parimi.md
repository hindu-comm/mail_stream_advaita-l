Thanks for your replies. I was able to find the book by Sri
Vekataramana Aiyar on google books:
http://books.google.com/books/download/The_Sambandha_v__rtika_of_Sur_____var__c.pdf?id=iTkYAAAAYAAJ&output=pdf&sig=ACfU3U1IcnNLS2RGdbZp-Kw5pyZpndWY0w

Vidyasankar ji: Have you read the books by K. P. Jog and Shoun Hino?
If so, can you please comment on the content. I'd like to know if
their treatment is as exhaustive and clear as Sri Balasubramaniam's
Taittiriya Upanishad vartika.

Is the Sambandha Vartika on Brihadaranyaka by Sri TMP Mahadevan
available anywhere? I'd love to buy that book if possible.

Thanks,
