I have not read them in much detail, for want of time and ready access,
but I recently discovered that many of them are available for preview on
Google books, at least in a limited way.

The discussion, from what I have read so far, is very extensive and scholarly.
I don't expect any less from a professor at Pune University and his Japanese
student, so I intend to get these myself. I have often felt the drawback of
not studying sureSvarAcArya's vArttika.



I haven't been able to locate an online version of TMP Mahadevan's book
on the sambandhavArttika. 



Regards,

Vidyasankar
