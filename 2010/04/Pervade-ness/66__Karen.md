Dear Sri Subrahmanian,

thanks for your explanations on "entry" in creation. 

Could you please explain me:
why Acharya use *jIvo* as brahmaiva naparah
when jiva also mithya on a level with Ishvara and Jagan?

I know that here Acharya means Substratum of jIva, but not jIva himself.
Then why he say "Jivo Brahmaiva naparah"
Where is my confusion? 

Please bear with me!

With warm regards,
Karen
