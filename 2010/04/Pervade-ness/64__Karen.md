Dear members of this honour list.

There are Sruti text:

"The Self is resplendent, formless" Mundaka
also "Without parts, devoid of activity" Svet. 

How Is It conceived of this Self *entering* into the manifested universe,
when the Self already completely pervaded it? We know that only limited
thing can enter into an "empty" space. But Brahman already there. Even
the word *pervade* is not valid here for pervadeness is Brahman- substratum
(Soul) of manifested Universe. 

Thanks for your clarification in advance.

With warm regards,
Karen
