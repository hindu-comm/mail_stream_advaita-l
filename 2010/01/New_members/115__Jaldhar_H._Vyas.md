Hi,

I am a student, albeit a starter of a student of the Upanishadic darshana as
brought forward by Shri Shankara. I'd like to learn more by being in touch
with the discussions here.

Thanks,
Vinay

I was encouraged seeing the list on Advaita vetanta. Which is the truth and 
pinnacle of Knowledge, Devotion and Ananda and I am naturally inclined to It. 
I had the rare privileges of meeting Prajananapurush Sri Sri Babathakur and 
going through His lectures on I-Reality, Knowledge of Knowledge, Missionless 
Mission which are based on His Realization.

What more? Let us look ahead and within.
