In the absence of an index for this site -- though new members could pursue
much through the existing system -- what would be you personal
recommendations for study of Advaita Vedanta other than the obvious -- to
find the apppropriate guru, or just to read Adi Shankara's chief writings ?
Any book or online info that stands out for you ?

Michael
