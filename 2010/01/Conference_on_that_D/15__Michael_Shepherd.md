I am really wondering is this really such a big issue??!! In what way
determining the shankara's birth date to certainity going to help us??

How does fixing date of birth of shankara is going to help us in our
spiritual /
vedAntic sAdhana I am not able to understand. Dont you think this fight
is due to mere academic superiority complex!!

== Baskar, the issue here is not as simple as it appears on the front. The
hidden agenda behind the date controversy is an 'attempt' to dislodge the
Sringeri Math tradition as being not an original lineage but a sishya math
of another institution down south. It is this hidden agenda that is the
real reason for such a huge outcry every time the date of shankara is
discussed, no matter where and how many times....

Regarding the spiritual vedantic sadhana, if those are the real intention,
this hidden agenda wont be there. One question to think about is that if
Kumbakonam Math had never stirred up its 'original lineage' claim,this
whole date of birth issue would have been analysed more reasonably; sans all
the emotions attached to it now. The controversy is only because of this
emotional attachment to the claim.
