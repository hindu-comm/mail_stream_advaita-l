Then you may have issues, because there is indeed textual evidence for 
Sankara having established four Maths. It is mentioned in Chidvilasiya 
Sankara Vijayam. Besides, Sankara having established a Math at Sringeri is 
mentioned in the Madhaviya Sankara Digvijayam.

Thanks for the information.  I know if I write anything in reply to the 
above biographical poetic  assertions (I hope, atleast you would agree 
that these biographies are 'kAvyamaya' in their writing style) ,  based on 
what I read and heard, that would lead to further clarifications, 
justifications and finally  unnecessary heated arguments...Hence, without 
stretching this issue any more, I agree with you with regard to shArada 
peetha sthApana at shrungeri by shankara, chAturmaTha sthApana by shankara 
at four poles of the country, his authorship to maThAmnAya grantha-s, his 
introduction of  dashanAmi paddhati in monastic order etc.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
