Dear Vidyasankarji,
I completely concur with you and truly appreciate your well composed  
message.  God Bless You !!!
Though Date &  Time is a relative number, it is the Shraddha & Bhakthi  
that we attribute to Sri Adi Shankara Bhagavadpadacharyal through  
one's own Guru is very important.  The very fact that we are  
celebrating Shankara Jayanthi today and are fortunate to pay our   
obeisance to Matha Aryamabal in KALADY is
only due to the Grace of Sri Sachidaananda ShivAbhinava Nrisimha  
Bharathi Mahaswamigal of Sringeri.  The prathishtaa (establishment) of  
Kalady sannidhanam was carried out in the gracious presence of  
Ahcaryals on 21st February 1910.

On the very same occasion, Sringeri Acharyal's released the first copy  
of Sri Shankara Granthaavali (Adi Shankara Works in Sanskrit) printed  
by Sri Rangam Vani Vilas press.  Sri. T.K.Bala Subramanya Aiya was   
conferred " Guru Bhaktha Sikamani " for the great contribution he  
carried out for this monumental work.
