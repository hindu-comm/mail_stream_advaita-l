The task of identification of the copper inscription may not be entirely at
a dead end. Copper can contain traces of 12 other related metals beside
itself; and copper neutron activation analysis can go some way to
identifying age (via smelting process empployed etc) and geographical
location (the admixture of those other elements). That is my understanding
of the current situation.

Sharmaji, Radhe Krishna,

Thanks for you info. I did a google search as suggested. My understanding
is that carbon dating cannot be done on a metal such as copper.

Regards,
