---- Bhaskar, can you please translate from Sri Holenarsipur Swamigal's 
kannada work on what exactly is he saying though you said he did not 
conclude...

praNAms 
Hare Krishna

Yes, if my memory serves me right ( long back I had read this work of Sri 
SSS) he leaves this issue to historians without making any conclusive 
remark!!  In this work he mainly talks about the minor as well as major 
differences in biographical account of shankara available in three major 
shankara biographis viz. mAdhaveeya shankara vijaya, vyAsAchaleeya's 
chidvilAsa's shankara vijaya vilAsa & anantAnandagiri's shankara 
vijaya...And he also states that, as of date,  there are more than 20 
biographies available on shankara & each & every one is unique in its own 
way while narratiing shankara's multihued life :-))  Anyway, let me have a 
look at it onceagain to-night.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
