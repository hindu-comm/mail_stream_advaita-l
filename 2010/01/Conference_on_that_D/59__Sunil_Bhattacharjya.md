Dear Bhaskarji,
My comment was in response what Michael said. I do not know how Michael's mail got deleted. When I said "You have a point" I meant that what Michael pointed out is valid. I mentioned earlier that the Dwarka Math had published a paper in the Journal "Vimarsh", where all the details of Sudhanva's copper inscription had been given. Dwarka Math authorities have kept the Copper inscription in the safe custoy of the Government authorities. I appreciate that as there is danger of that getting destroyed by persons and you can very well guess why.
I think that in search of the vyavaharik truth one has every right to seek clarificationsrespectfully from any of the Sankara Mathas if one finds any contradictory statements said to be coming out of that Math. Who are not interested in these mundane truths can skip such mails an devote time and energy to seeking the paramarthic truths alone, without loosing their cool.
Regards,
Sunil K. Bhattacharjya

Yes, you have a point.

praNAms
Hare Krishna

can we not avoid single line remarks like : thanks, good, you have a point 
etc. with a lengthy tail of previous mails ?? IMO, appreciatory or 
otherwise single line comments can be addressed directly to the the person 
concerned if these remarks not doing any value addition to the on going 
thread..is it not?? just a suggestion..moderators discretion is final in 
this regard.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
