Radhe Krishna

Shriman Sunil, Radhe Krishna
The copper inscription is misspelled as carbon inscription.  typographical error regretted. What still missed out is the "carbon dating" of this copper inscription.   If this copper plate is examined by a historian, the same would be subjected to "Carbon Dating" for establishing its age.

Regards
Radhe Krishna
