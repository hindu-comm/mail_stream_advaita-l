Dear Jaldharji,

Kindly permit meto disagree with your statement, that the controversy on the date of Adi Sankaracharya has nothing to do with AIT. This is because Max Muller did not only say that the Aryans came to India in the 15th century BCE but he also went on to draw a time-line for the ancient Indian History according to which the Vedas were composed subsequent to the Aryan Invasion in the 15th century and he gave the dates of the Brahmanas etc. subsequent to the date of composition of the Vedas. The he went on to givethe date of Lord Buddha in the 6th century BCE to fit in with his timeline. Once you take the date of Lord Buddhain the 6th century BCE you have to take the date Vasubandhu as 1000 years after the demise of Lord Buddha, in conformity with the statement of Hiuen Tsang that Vasubandhu lived one thousand years after the demise of Lord Buddha.Then you have to take the date of his disciple Dignaga after the date of Vasubandhu. The date of
 Dharmakirti comes after that of Dignaga and as Adi Sankaracharya's work shows that Adi Sankaracharya was subsequent to Dignaga and Dharmakiriti it ibecomes obvious what the date of Adi Sankaracharya will appear to be in this case.A layman may not be able to comprehend this but a big scholar like you may not have difficulty in understanding this.

Regards,

Sunil K. Bhattacharjya

The controversy on the date of Shankaracharya has nothing to do with Max Muller or the Aryan Invasion Theory and is in fact mostly a conversation between _Indian_ scholars some of which were quite traditionalist in their beliefs.
