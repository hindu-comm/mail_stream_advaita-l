Dear Shri Varadaraja Sharma,
Om Namo Bhagavate Vasuevaya,

Thank you for telling the forum that Nrsimha Bharati Swamiji attained Mahasamadhi in 1879. What makes you think that the information given in the book History of Vijayanagara, which was published in 1909, ie. 30 (=1909 - 1879) years after the passing away of the Swamiji, has been concocted?. Did I or anybody say that the late Swamiji himself personally passed on that information to the author of the book "History of Vijayanagara" in 1909? Do you also think that the author of that book could not have met the Swamiji 30 years before the book was published? Please stop ridiculing people without ascertaining facts.
Why are you silent about king Suhanva's copper inscription?
Om Namo Bhagavate Vasuevaya

Radhe KrishnaIn a earlier post, Shriman Ravi had raised observation as to how many of us rememberour family line clearly for 5+ generations. True, even those who performDarsha shradhadigal regularly may be recollecting the names of pithru, pitamaha prabithamahal. But most of the devotees of Dakshinamnaya Sharada Peetham, i am sure, can recollect the holy names of more than 5 purvacharyals. Jagadgurus - Shri Sachidananda Bharathi Swamigal; Shri Abhinava Sachidananda Bharathi Swamigal, Shri Vrudha Nrusimha Bharathi Swamigal, Shri Sachidananda Shivabhinava Nrusimha Bharathi Swamigal, Shri Chandra Shekara Bharathi Swamigal, Shri Abhinava Vidyatirth Swamigal and Shri Bharathi Tirtha Swamigal.
I am recollecting the names of my purvacharyals after having read the post of shriman sunil. As he records, In a book published in 1909, it has been alleged that manuscript taken from puja box of acharyal regarding date of adya acharyal has been found. Jagadguru shri Vrudha Nrusimha Bharathi Swamigal attained mahasamdi in 1879. And I do not wish to even raise a question about the authenticity of this information.It seem to be as authentic as the brilliantly concocted verse about adya acharyal's date from allegedly discovered jina vijaya.Radhe Krishna
