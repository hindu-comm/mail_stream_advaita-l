Dear Vidyasankarji,

The book I am referring to was published in 1909 by Suryanarayana Rao, who secured the information contained in the manuscript in the Puja box of Sri Narasimhabharati, accoring to which Adi Sankara was born in Saka Vikramarka 14. 


I understand that Dr. A.K.Shastri is in favour of Vikramasaka 75.


Regards,


Sunil K. Bhattacharjya

I am referring to the book (published in the beginning of the twentieth century), which says that Adi Sankara was born 13 years after the reign of Vikramarka and that this book incorporates the information obtained fromthe source connected to the Mathadhipati of the Sringeri math..I gathered that Dr.A.K.Shastri does not believe in that. If that is so the book by Sastri is of no use. Is it not true that Dr. shastri does not believe in that ? All this information is available in the Google.

I am still awaiting your brother's address so that I can see the book of Sastri myself. If your brother does not have the book kindly do let me know so that I shall try to find the book elsewhere.

Regatds,

Sunil K. Bhattacharjya

I'm not sure which "History of Vijayanagara" you are referring to here, which past maThAdhipati of Sringeri
that book quotes and what that view was! If you are referring to the book by Henry Heras, that is a highly
outdated book and is highly biased in many ways. Many other publications on Vijayanagara history have
appeared since then, so you need to be more precise in your reference.

Vidyasankar
