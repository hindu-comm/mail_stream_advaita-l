If I were a dramatist with time on my hands and the urge to do so, I would
go through all Adi Shankara's commentaries, knowing that every time
'Objector' raises his (or her ?) voice, it would be that Shankara had faced
that question from the greatest minds of other sects in lively open public
debate -- and had included that Q&A in his oral record to prepare his
disciples for the great debate themselves..

--- Nice one. I thought about it; but is it not that his Bhashya is only
that. Apart from explaining the content of the text, has he not commented
on the acceptability of otherwise of other thoughts....most probably such
other ideas having been gathered by him during his debates during
wanderings...............
