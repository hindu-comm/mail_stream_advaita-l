Yes, you have a point.

praNAms
Hare Krishna

can we not avoid single line remarks like : thanks, good, you have a point 
etc. with a lengthy tail of previous mails ??  IMO, appreciatory or 
otherwise single line comments can be addressed directly to the the person 
concerned if these remarks not doing any value addition to the on going 
thread..is it not?? just a suggestion..moderators discretion is final in 
this regard.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
