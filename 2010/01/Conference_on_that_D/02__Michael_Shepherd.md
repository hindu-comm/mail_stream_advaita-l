If I were a dramatist with time on my hands and the urge to do so, I would
go through all Adi Shankara's commentaries, knowing that every time
'Objector' raises his (or her ?) voice, it would be that Shankara had faced
that question from the greatest minds of other sects in lively open public
debate -- and had included that Q&A in his oral record to prepare his
disciples for the great debate themselves..

I think that by the time I had set that dramatically, I would have a lively
drama of ideas on my hands which required no more attention to the date of
his opportune embodiment to 'set matters straight' fo us, than the decision
'Which period should the costumes represent ?'...

Dear Bhaskarji,
If knowing Adi Sankara's birth year is not important you may request the
Sringeri authorities to say that and once the Sringeri authorities say that
the controversy may end. Don't you think so? But till that time I am looking
forward to reading the book by Shastri, which was referred to by Shri
Vidyasankarji. Once I have a look at that book in the place of
Viyasankarji's brother may be my quest will end.
Regards,
Sunil K. Bhattacharjya

Hope mother Sarada will guide us in this endeavour to satisfy ourselves
regarding the date of Adi Sankaracharya.

praNAms Sri Sunil prabhuji
Hare Krishna

If at all I pray for mother shArada's guidance, I pray for jnAna &
vairAgya and definitely not for authenticated shankara's birth certificate
:-))

I am really wondering is this really such a big issue??!! In what way
determining the shankara's birth date to certainity going to help us?? I
am sure, advancing shankara's birth date to 5th century or earlier to that
 does not going to help us to advance our self realization or postponing
the date to 8th century or later to that delay our realization :-))
Normally, as I have observed, my cyber guruji Sri Vidya prabhuji does not
speak unnecessarily but this time I am surprising to see he is spending
most of his valuable time, energy & intelligence on this issue!! How does
fixing date of birth of shankara is going to help us in our spiritual /
vedAntic sAdhana I am not able to understand. Dont you think this fight
is due to mere academic superiority complex!!

While on the subject, I would like to bring to the notice of this forum
that late Prof. S.K. Ramachandra Rao, (was the chief of Kalpataru
saMshOdhana Kendra here in Bangalore dakshiNamnaya shankara mutt branch)
has written & discussed elaborately on shankara's birth date in his
English book 'Shankara & adhyAsa bhAshya'...Those who are interested in
his views can refer this book. Interestingly he says in his Kannada book
'shAnkara sandesha' that shankara's date has now been fixed and i.e. 632
to 664...He quotes the reference for this : T.R. Chintaamani, Journal of
Oriental Research, Madras, 1929, III, pages -39 to 56..he also says here
in this reference that this calculation has been completely accepted by
mahA mahOpAdhyAya Sri Kuppuswami shAstri and other well known scholars
(prasiddha vidvAmsa-s).

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
