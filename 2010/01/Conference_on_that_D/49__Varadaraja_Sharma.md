Radhe Krishna,

Anbe sivam, Radhe Krishna

me too neither a metllurgist nor an arÂ­chaeologist.  Neverthless, whenever an archaeological artifact is unearthed, be it a fossil, even a wooden tool, by a scientific method called carbon-14 dating, the age of artifact is determined. 
if you want more information as to accuracy of such determination of age etc., go to google search and would gather further information.
regarding the copper inscription in question, leaving the facts as to when it was unearthed, who unearthed it, under whose posession is it now, it is a matter of fact that it is alleged to be thousands of years old.
If that being the case, through scientic methodology, if the age of artifact is determined, more information is known to the world at large.

regards
Radhe Krishna
