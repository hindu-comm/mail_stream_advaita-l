Dear Vidyasankarji,

The Dwarka math is very transparent and the Swamiji theredoes reply to the querries andhe even asks the people concerned to visit the Dwarka math to satisfy all their querries. If you have any difficulty in contacting the Swamiji Kindly do let me know.

Regards,

All of this discussion presumes that a sample is available for analysis. I have not
read a single article/book by anybody who says they have actually seen it or
knows where the said inscription is. So the whole thing is moot.

By the way, carbon dating of a number of materials can be done, even if there is
no direct carbon content in them. For example a piece of pottery that is discovered
along with other archaeological finds can be dated by means of the carbon in the
organic matter that is often intimately associated with it. Similarly with metal
implements. Copper plate inscriptions are often found buried, bundled up in groups
and the rope used to tie them does give an accurate enough estimate of when the
inscriptions were buried, if not when they were engraved.

None of this is possible without physical access to the sample and that has always
been the problem with the so-called sudhanvA grant to Adi Sankara.

Best regards,
Vidyasankar
