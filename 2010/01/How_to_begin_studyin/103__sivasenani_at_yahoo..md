Pranam

Let me repeat what my guru said. Forget whether learning Sanskrit is required, even a Ph. D. In Sanskrit would find it difficult to fully digest what Bhagavatpaada wrote. Vedanta is quite distinct and different from the language. 
Just like the Japanese modernized within one generation (30 yrs) and defeated a major European power (Russia) at war, for somebody like Ramana Maharshi learning the Sanskrit language is not required; they intuitively get the truth about the world. On the other hand Madhyamaadhikaaris and adhamaadhikaaris find knowledge of Sanskrit very useful chiefly for two reasons: the subject is tough enough, why not learn it in original esp. when all the technical terms anyhow retain their original form. For instance, adhyaasa (super imposition) to my knowledge is translated as adhyaasa in most Indian languages; maya, avidya, naisargika ... The list is pretty long and given in full in books with titles like vedanta paribhasha. Second, the two lower order of sadhakas require extensive sadhana; the mind is such a monkey that one needs external crutches to stay the course so people take up various programmes like vishnusahasranaama paarayaNa every ekaadaSI; rudra paaraayaNa every maasa Sivaraatri; or even daily prayers: om iti eka aksharam brahma or asau aaditya brahma. The idea of these regimens is to constantly remind oneself about the teaching of Veda. When you say Vishnu is the jnaana-jnaatri-jneyaroopa or that Rudra is the one who is standing, the one who is running etc (ie pervades the Universe), you really remind yourself of the essence of the teachings of Veda. Well, technically you can recite the thousand names of Vishnu or the Hymn to Rudra in English, but many find that their discipline slacken with English, Telugu etc. For those with that sort of mental discipline (where the buddhi is so firmly in control, the sadhana is anyways nearing the end), Sanskrit is not required; others find knowledge of Sanskrit useful as their sadhana becomes more meaningful.

Namaste Chetan,
Your point is well taken... Yet I would suggest 'true knowledge' comes from experience + knowledge . Look at the lineage of the wise . It is the knowledge that is offered and the experience of that knowledge.  I  am not suggesting one is in front of the other.  One talks about the banana, sees a picture of it, knows perhaps its size, weight, chemical makeup, but the fullness of the knowledge comes with one bite of the banana. Both compliment each other for fullness (bhūman) completeness (samāpti) of the experience.

Now that said, my personal experience in learning saṁskṛt has been beneficial - by NO MEANS am
I even slightly accomplished in its proficiency, I  am a novice at best, and a student (śiṣya) of this
most profound language /grammar/script. It has and is richly rewarding for me,  for my level of development.

Now is learning saṁskṛt a requirement for advaita vedānta ? - I cannot not say.
Yet you  give some  good examples:  You offer "  Is it really necessary to know English to understand physics" - I would ask you to consider this point of view. To really appreciate Physics and make it a meaningful & rewarding experience it is good to know the formulas of that discipline.
When one talks of Force, the greater apperception of it is knowing Force = MA ( mass x acceleration).
Now we have a view at the essence of force.   Like that , appreciation of the essence of advaita vedānta,
Being, brahman, may just take one through the path of  saṁskṛt.

I will be interested in others' point of view.

  Dear All,
         Is learning sanskrit necessary, for understanding Advaita. Is it really necessary to know english to understand physics. Have not the Japanese invented quite a lot of technology with Japanese itself. Even Acharya Shanakara's "Bhaja Govindam" indicates  the false value of language . To know Advaita is different and to Expereince Advaita is different. And finally it does not mean one cannot experience Advaita without first knowing  it. True knowledge  comes through experience. Hence I request the enlightneed ones on this list  to explain to people like us who find sankrit difficult , the method to experience Advaita.
My humble pranams,
Chetan
