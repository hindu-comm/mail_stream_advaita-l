According to the book "Adi Shankara: His life and times" by Swami 
Chandrashekarendra Saraswati, Govinda Bhagavatapada was from Kashmir and 
was named Chandra Sharma in his purvashram.  He rescued Gaudapadacharya 
from a curse which had made him a brahmarakshasa and then became his 
shishya.  This story is taken from a kavya called Patanjalivijaya by 
Ramabhadra Dikshit (c. 17th century.)

Traditionally Bhartrahari the grammarian and author of shrngara, niti, and 
vairagya shatakas is said to be the half-brother of King Vikramaditya (who 
founded the Vikrama Samvata era and is therefore c. 1st century BC.) and 
was the king of Ujjain until he became disgusted with worldly life and 
left the throne to his brother.  Their fathers name was Gandharvasen.
