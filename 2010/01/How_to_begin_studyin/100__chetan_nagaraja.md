  Dear All,
         Is learning sanskrit necessary, for understanding Advaita. Is it
really necessary to know english to understand physics. Have not the
Japanese invented quite a lot of technology with Japanese itself. Even
Acharya Shanakara's "Bhaja Govindam" indicates  the false value of
language . To know Advaita is different and to Expereince Advaita is
different. And finally it does not mean one cannot experience Advaita
without first knowing  it. True knowledge  comes through experience. Hence I
request the enlightneed ones on this list  to explain to people like us who
find sankrit difficult , the method to experience Advaita.
My humble pranams,
Chetan
