In Mumbai there is a bookshop called "Giri Trading" in Matunga West). They shifted their bookshop to the basement of a building near their earlier place.

Jai Siya Ram all,

Unfortunately I am being dragged to India for my wedding shopping, specifically Mumbai. However to get away from the women for a little while, are there any really good book stores where i can find precious gems of knowledge?

I'm mainly looking for advaitic themed books, bhashyas but also definitely keen on vedanta/sad darshan books etc. Hope you get my drift.

I know that this post is a complete one-off and if there are any places that you may know of please email me privately at makwanakb at gmail.com with the details as i don't want to bombard the forum with addresses ;-)

Many thanks to all in advance

Krunal
