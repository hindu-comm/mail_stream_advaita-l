Gaudapadacharya.



It is a recent work and as far as I know..there are no claims to it being an ancient work

shrI Ramesh already answered your other queries.





>Sri Vidya is
Samayachara Tantra as opposed to the Vamachara Tantra.. 



As Ramesh said it has both..what is called samayAchAra is a later
adoption by smArta-s of the actual shrIkula tradition which is a kaula
tradition involving 5M etc.



>Many people >may
not realise that the Sarada Chatuh-shati is a tantric text and that may
>be the reason for which late S.K. Ramachanra Rao gave the title
"Tantric practices in Sri >Vidya".



I doubt if it can be called a tAntrik text. As said before, it is work
which tries to correlate some aspects of shrIvidyA with advaita vedAnta.



>Do you have any idea as to how it differs from the Sarada Tilak Tantra? 



They are not related in any way and have nothing in common.





>Also how is it >different from the Lalita
 Trishati?



Trishati is the 300 names of lalitA mahAtripura sundarI.

The contens of the other work I mentioned above.



I dont remember but address can be found out from google.
