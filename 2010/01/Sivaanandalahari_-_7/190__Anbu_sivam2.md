In the days of yore Thaarakaasuran was harassing the devas and they knew
only a son born to Siva and Parvathi would be able to vanquish this Asura.
In order to hasten this event the devas who were frustrated at Siva
remaining quiet on his longest thapas, asked Manmathaa to play his trick of
enticing Siva into a union with Parvathi. Manmatha who is unconquerable in
kindling the kaama in anyone shot his flower arrow at Siva . This disturbed
Siva's thapas and he opened his third eye of fury and instantly reduced
Manmatha to ashes. Such was the alertness and smartness of Siva. For burning
down Manmatha Siva got the name 'Smaraari'.

Hey! Smaraari! How smart can you be to be having an old and slow bull as
your vehicle? Hey! Vrishabhaadhirooda! Have you not seen my mind which is of
kalyaaNa guNa (kalyaaNinam), which is possessed of many vichithra rasas
(sarasachithraghathim), which is so very swift (savEgham), which is endowed
with the nuaces of behaviour (sarvEngidhagnam), which is faultless (anagham)
and above all which is possessed of the subhalakshaNaas that qualifies for
sivaayujya padhavi having attained the advaithagnaana of the greatest ananya
bhakthi (dhruvalakshaNaadyam)? Please take this horse of my mind
(chEthasthurangam) as your vehicle and roam around your domain in complete
ease.

SivOham, SivOham
