My mind has devotion to the lotus feet of Paramashiva.For purpose of
focussing on it , like a woman seperated from her husband constantly
thinking and imagining about him , the mind always meditates and worships
with Shiva mantra japa.

சூடுவேன் பூங்கொன்றை; சூடிச் சிவன் திரள்தோள்
கூடுவேன்; கூடிமுயங்கி மயங்கி நின்று
ஊடுவேன்; செவ்வாய்க் குருகுவேன்; உள் உருகித்
தேடுவேன்; தேடிச் சிவன் கழலே சிந்திப்பேன்
வாடுவேன்; பேர்த்தும் மலர்வேன்: அனல் ஏந்தி
ஆடுவான் சேவடியே பாடுதுங்காண், அம்மானாய்.
(திருவாசகம்)

Hey! ParamEswara! Hey! KaruNaamoorthE!  A wife who got separated from her
husband pines constantly thinking of him.  Her buddhi by this constant mOham
attains bharthrudhaadhaamya bhaava.  My buddhi also has attained this mOham
for your lotus feet.  You have do your Arul to make this mOham a permanent
one.  Hey! ParamEswara!  My buddhi has been in constant longing to do
namaskaaram to your lotus feet.  More over my buddhi is for ever meditating,
watching and singing your holy feet that have no destruction even during
mahaapraLaya.  Thus my mind is caught up in this mOham of sivabhajanam.  I
enjoy being in this state and please please endow me with your Arul so I am
never distrubed out of this state of mOham.  This will be the sapalam of my
janma.

Whoever recites this slOka and do a namaskaaram in siva sannidhi will find
their layam in the lotus feet of ParamEswara.

Aum Namasivaaya.
