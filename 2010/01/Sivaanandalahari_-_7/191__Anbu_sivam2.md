Bhakti showers sweet rain like cluster of clouds in the sky of the lotus
feet of Parameswara. Those whose tanks of mind are filled with the sweet
water of Bhakti attain the fruit of birth. Others don't (attain it).

punarapi jananam punarapi maraNam punarapi jananee jatarE sayanam

That is, It is not unnoticeable that in this samsaara of janana maraNa
roopam praaNis are immersed in it.  The antharanga saadhanam for the
uddhaaraNam (lifting up) of the nimagna (drowning) praaNis lies in
SIVABHAKTHI.  This rahasyam was revealed by BhagavathpaadhaaL when he said:
"mOkshasaadhanasaamagrayaam bhakthirEva ghareeyasee".  Just as the dark
clouds occupy the space to shower the rain Sivabhakthi should entirely
occupy the paadhaabjam of ParamEswara. When someone who could shower his
bhakthi on the paadhaabjam and fill the tank of his mind (தாமரை பூத்த
தடாகமடி! ) he finds himself a mahaanubhaavan with the crop of his birth
matured and his janma attains its sapalam (fruitfulness).  On the contrary,
if a person wastes his life without doing sivabhakthi his janma becomes
futile (vipalam).  This was reiterated by our aadhi Guru:

dhurlabham maanusham dhEham praapya thathraapi pourusham |
itha: kOnvasthi moodaathmaa yasthu swaarthE pramaadhyathi ||

Manushya janmam is very rare in one's many incarnations.  There is no
greater moodan than the one who having been born as  a man but not having
surrendered to a Guru and obtained Brahmavidya and do anusandhaanam that his
own self is that of ParamEswara.  This is exactly what AachaaryaaL says in
this sloka: "thajjanmasasyamakhilam sapalam cha naanyath".

Whoever recites this slOka and do namskaaram to ParamEswara will surely get
their janma saapalyam.

SivOham, SivOham.
