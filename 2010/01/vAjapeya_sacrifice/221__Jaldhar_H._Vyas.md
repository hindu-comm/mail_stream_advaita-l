Yes it is one of the seven soma sansthas.  It can only be performed by a 
Brahmana or Kshatriya.  It takes place in Sharada rtu.  It can start on 
Kartika Shukla 10 or Ashvina Shukla 10 and continues until the next amasa 
(thus 19-21 days)  The first day there is diksha and at the end a yajna 
called brhaspatisava.  In between soma yajnas are offered three times a 
day.  Thus as you can imagine it was extremely expensive and was very 
rarely performed.
