Pranam to all learned list members,

while reading the Agni PurAna I come across the vAjapeya sacrifice, but till
now I didnÂ´t get an description of this sacrifice. So please, if there is
anyone who knows, please give me some informations of this sacrifice. In the
dictionary you find only that it is one of the 7 names ( kinds?) of Soma
sacrifices. Please take this as a question only of interest.

Take my respect

Andreas Leitz
