Yes it is one of the seven soma sansthas.  It can only be performed by a
Brahmana or Kshatriya.  It takes place in Sharada rtu.  It can start on
Kartika Shukla 10 or Ashvina Shukla 10 and continues until the next amasa
(thus 19-21 days)  The first day there is diksha and at the end a yajna
called brhaspatisava.  In between soma yajnas are offered three times a
day.  Thus as you can imagine it was extremely expensive and was very
rarely performed.
