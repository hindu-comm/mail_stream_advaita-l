I wrote in a previous post:

Here is my view ( if there is interest) on this 100... I have been taught it has further meaning beyond just a number of life Span to 100... It starts with 10.
So what of this 10?   It is 1 + 0. the Fullness of nirguṇa ( 0 ) + the fullness of saguṇa ( 1 ) gives total fullness. 

Both are full in themselves and is represented by this 1+0 or 10.
This is the wisdom found in the application of 10; '10' is code, inference, the insight, the symbol for full-ness and aligns to Brahman.

A bit more on this 10 ,

As I see and read, the notion of 10 is key - the offer of 10 directions is a symbol, hint, information ( saṃketa ) that tells us there is no place this Being is not. 

WE will find  the make-up of this 10 as 1 + 0 , and 5 + 5 and as 4+3+2+1. This wisdom ( for me) goes beyond brilliant. But what does the 5 & 5 represent ? That is reviewed in this Chāndogya Upaniṣad. 

What of this 4+3+2+1 ? We will find it in kṛta ( the number 4) offered in th Chāndogya Upaniṣad. That of a die ( dice). This 4 contains within it 3, 2 and 1 . If we sum it up we get ( 4+3+2+1) 10.
Yet it is worthy of note that this section is an instruction by the muni raikva (a jñāin) to jānaśruti , a King. 

This is the wisdom the jñāin offers to define the ~nature~ of Brahman.  That is, raikva gives examples of Brahman with form and formless. This is easy to see ( IMHO) as there is no thing He/It/She is not.

But what are they trying to tell me? -->  daśa santaiḥ tat kṛtam - What is created of that One becomes 10. (Chāndogya Upaniṣad 4.3.8)
He is the One that shines ( rāṭ ) in every specific form ( vi ) ~ virāṭ ¹ ~ . He manifests in all the worlds.
