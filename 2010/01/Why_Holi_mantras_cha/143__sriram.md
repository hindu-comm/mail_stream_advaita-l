Dear members
100  is very important in Hindu philososophy.The longevity is considered as of 100 years.Sadhayushman bhava is the blessings of the elders to the young ones.In Tamil also this hundred is considered important.If somebody`s name is being mentioned and if he suddenly appears on the scene Tamil people will say  you will live a hundred years.May be 100 is followed by two sunyas -zeros-and make it ending with a digit 8 might have been added as it gives a total of 9 when digits are added.9 is considered very auspicious as it constantly maintains its value if it is multiplied by any number and the digits are added to arrive at a single digit sum.Ashtothara sadam is usually the number of namavali in praise of the deities and in the end the purohit will say ashtothram sampoornam.Sadam is understood.
According to me this 108 would have evolved during a period  from 100 and stopped at this.But there is no injunction as to why 108.We have Sahasranama also in this fashion.We can at the most speculate only.We can say it is anadhi.R.Krishnamoorthy.
