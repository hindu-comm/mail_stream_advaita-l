hariḥ oṁ 
~~~~~~ 

Namasté 

I have found it curious when I hear people say ' I  am only human' or ' nobody's perfect'.  For me this idiom just does not ring true (for me)
if one is a student and practitioner of sanātana dharma. How so? The śāstra-s clearly indicate we are not the body i.e. the home of imperfection.

Example:

The isāvāsya upaniṣad helps us with this;

oṁ pūrṇamadaḥ pūrṇamidaṁ pūrṇāt pūrṇamudacyate | 
pūrṇasya pūrṇamādāya pūrṇamīvāvashiṣyate ||

This says we are whole, full in our selves just as That is Full ( pūrṇa ).

But one can say ' that only occurs when you are a realized soul'. Perhaps, yet  the wise tell us this - this fullness is satatoditam. Svāmī Lakṣman-jū discusses this word from the Tantrāloka.  He says, It is that which has no pause, no break. This for me really captures the essence of this totality, the fullness. Svāmi-ji says ' It is break-less and unitary. In samādhi it is there and when samādhi is absent it is there. And in sleep it is there; in each and every state of the subjective body it is there. 

If I look at this word I see it as sat + a-tu + dita. Which says to me, that which real is (sat) + not (a) +to have authority (tu) + bound or divided (dita) . Or that Reality that cannot be bound or divided . This informs us there is no place it is not - even at every point of the human experience. 

This quality of brahman is fullness or bhūman ( so say the upaniṣad-s). Even Nārada-ji asks where this fullness 
can be found (chāndogya upaniṣad chapter 7) .  He is informed  by sanatkumāra (the ṛṣi of the vidyā) of the following:


"O my dear Nārada, your question itself is unfounded and unwarranted. Why do you ask where It is, as if It is in space? But if you want me to tell you where It is, I say It is in space, It is in every nook and corner, in every pinpoint of space. There is no space where It is not; there is no space which It does not occupy." 

Hence this even negates the position the the body is a home of imperfection - as brahmanis there too.

Hence my point. For us to suggest only being human as if it were a defect  is unwarranted.  To continue to  think
in this manner helps the illusion continue ( IMHO).

So, why do we feel less perfect ? What is that cloud that surrounds us that keeps us from this greatness of who we really are?
And the more important question ( out side the academics of it all) is what can you do about it?
