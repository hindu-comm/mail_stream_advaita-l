That is really a much waited good news. The earlier 1910 print of Sriranga Vani Vilas Press had gone out of print decades ago; and we only had a partial reprint from Vani Vilas later but sponsored from Calcutta, which omitted basically the prose compositions of that Acharya.

Hope the present edition from Tatvaloka office is a complete edition of the 1910 edition. Is it so Sriram Ji?

By the way, the Sri Venkatesha Karavalamba Stotra - is that a composition of this Jagadguru or his Guru Sri Vrudha Nrusimha Bharati ? If it is the former, then have they included that sloka too in this edition ? 

Thanks & Regards,
Venkat.

Sadgurubhyo Namah.
