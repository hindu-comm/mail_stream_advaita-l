Jaldarji,

Quote: " First of all, let's be clear that Vidyashankar's effort is not "to
pit one Matam against another" but to understand the truth about Indian
history and you should be ashamed to say such a thing."

What I wrote was nothing contrived but an honest observation and I do not
feel ashamed at all.

I respect your opinion though.

Regards,
Anbu
