I just want to address this bit.  First of all, let's be clear that 
Vidyashankar's effort is not "to pit one Matam against another" but to 
understand the truth about Indian history and you should be ashamed to say 
such a thing.  It is true that unscrupulous people do twist legitimate 
research for their own agendas.  Does that mean we should the same?  On 
the contrary such people should be encouraged to use these sources as much 
as possible.  Have you heard the proverb "sunlight is the best 
disinfectant"?  Marxism is defunct in the West because its false claims 
about history ultimately couldn't stand scrutiny.  The so-called 
"Dravidianism" is just a relabled brand of Marxism based on the same bogus 
theories of history.  If forced to play by the rules of rational 
historical inquiry it collapses like a house of cards.  Sanatana Dharma 
will not because even if you don't accept it on faith, its existence is an 
undeniable historical truth.  But when astikas try and play the same game 
of historical one-upmanship as their opponents they do not help their 
cause but instead deprive themselves of one of their biggest weapons.

I've also had a run in with this person Arul Tilak in the past in another
forum.  I pointed out that for someone who who is anti-brahmana he is
awfully reliant on the thoughts of Brahmanas and he shut up completely!

Let me close by once again emphasizing that whatever I may think about the 
events of the past, it in no way lessens my regards for what Kanchi and 
its acharyas are doing _right_now_ for the cause of dharma.
