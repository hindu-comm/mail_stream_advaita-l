Dear Vidyasankarji,

I am glad you did bare your chest to rid of what was irking you.  I hope it
should ease any discomfort.

Please let me comment on what you wrote.

Quote: "*Dr. Subramanian Swamy, all said and done, is a political leader. I
do not mean anything derogatory by it, as every society needs political
leadership. However, I do not (unlike most of my countrymen) attach any
extra importance to a man with power and influence.*"

Sure you can hold to that opinion.  That is your prerogative.  Contrast this
to what I said of him.  I said: "*It is to his credit that he boldly and
single-handedly thwarted the attempt of the athiest and corrupt hoards of
the DMK men who had planned to blow up Ramasethu, a bridge of ancience and
about which crores of bhakthas have sung in great piety.  People go there
endlessly to do their tharpaNam for the release of their pithrus*."

Sir, Ramasethu is very sacred to the Hindus.  What was at play was not just
a 'politically motivated offshore development' as you would portray.  The
destruction of Ramasethu is to give a body blow to the Hindus for Ramasethu
kindles the icon Rama and his most extolled Dharma Rajya that the secular
forces despice.  The asuric forces tried to destroy Ramasethu to attack our
ancient beliefs.  They would also make some money in the dredging which even
though in crores of rupees is insignificant compared to the issue at stake.
Everyone with a modicum of economics would know that this so called 'canal'
is bound to fail given the nature of the sea there and the narrowness and
shallowness of the area to permit any ship of even a moderate size to pass
through.  Importantly sir, that time and again, our Gods were called into
question, they were denigrated and declared before the Supreme Court that
Rama never existed and was a fiction.  Dr. Subramanian Swamy defended our
dhaarmic belief system and not a secular view of history that you so much
wish to depend on and basing on which you would easily like to pass your
judgement that you 'would not cite him as a primary authority on any
historical detail.'  Believe me sir, Dr.Swamy in neither citing any
'secular' history nor is he enomoured to be certified on that account.

Quote: "*I mean no disrespect to Dr. Swamy, and I'm sure that if he were to
read this, he would appreciate the fact that I respect a true scholar more
than anyone else.*"

I am not interested in questioning your platitute to Dr.Swamy but in as much
as you hold one version of history as dear to you he too held to the idea
that the history of Bharathavarsha has been distorted by the westerners and
it is taking a toll in the body politic of the country as for example, and I
reiterarate that it is just an example, in the Aryan Invasion Theory, and
our history therefore needs correction.  If you say only a historian has to
say that and no one else, then you do know that all 'historians' do not
remain monolithic in upholding the secular version but a very large number
of historians do come to the conclusion that the history as we know need to
be corrected.  There has been enough evidence to disprove AIT, there has
come to light enough evidence that the River Saraswathy is not a fiction,
there has come conclusive evidence in the researches of Dr.Narahari Achar on
the date of Mahabharatha war, there has been enough evidence of Dwaraka now
under sea and so on and so forth.

Quote: "*The fact that Dr. Swamy took the blessings of Sringeri Acharya is
of not much consequence really. The Acharyas give blessings to everyone who
asks for them sincerely. And lest you misconstrue this as disrespect to the
Sringeri Acharya too, let me hasten to add that that would be furthest from
my intent. This should be obvious, but I'm stating itjust for the record!*"

This is a wonderful scholarship to belittle Sringeri Aachaaryaa's blessing
to Dr.Swamy.  So be it.

Quote: "*do you think the likes of Brahmin-bashers in Tamil Nadu need my
opinions to bolster their case?*"

Whatever you say, the undeniable fact is that you played as good whip to
bash Kanchi AachaaryaaLs whom you have irreverently abbreviated as C.S. and
J.S. among other things.  That is the secularist historian in you.  For most
of us we do call them as ParamaachaaryaaL and Jayendra PeriavaaL.  That is
our belonging.  We would also not call Mahasannidhaanams in any other way.

Quote: "*About plunging into mires of controversies about dates - may I
point out that you are finding fault with the messenger? I am well aware of
the mire and I am also well aware of who created the mire in the first
place. Could you kindly tell the people who keep adding more dirt into the
mire to stop doing so?*"

Could I tell everyone not to talk about the date?  Sure, I can - but don't
you think that I am just a member like everyone else and shouldn't arrogate
to be authoritative? Nevertheless I do plead with everyone not to meditate
on things that wouldn't help their purushaartha.

Quote: "*In your life, have you ever found it necessary to say anything
about the pointless nature of debating Adi Sankara's date to people like
Polagam Rama Sastri, T M P Mahadevan, N Veezhinathan and others from your
native Tamil Nadu, who have contributed tremendously to increasing the
confusion on this issue, and largely by insulting, questioning and
disparaging the Sringeri traditions in heavily publicized writings over the
last half a century? Has anyone of you ever thought of walking up to one of
these people and telling them, "Do not disrespect the legacy of Adi Sankara
by insulting the Sringeri lineage? Do not be callous and describe it as an
institution that was accidently set up and not by intent. Do not spread lies
about the Sringeri lineage, because we all should respect those Acharyas
greatly." Have you ever done so? Please be honest to yourself and to me and
examine how much you have acted upon your supposed respect for the Sringeri
tradition.*"

First of all, I am nobody to any of these people.  Since the discussion was
going on in this list I participated in it and in my earlier post of the
28th December 2009 I have said: "Only the secularists will be interested in
the dates to show the importance of whiteman, blackman, Aryan Dravidan etc
crap.  My plea to fellow members is not to get caught in the ego trips but
just respect the Gurus and their lineage irrespective of the Peetam for any
disrespect will retard them deep down in the cycle of birth and death."

In an earlier posting I have referred to the lineage given in
BrihadhaaranyakOpanishad where it is traced backwards from a nameless rishi
whose mother is Pautimaasi and from him another 36 rishis are nameless too
but only their mothers' names are given.  Then enters Yagnavalkya and then
the lineage traces on the 22 actual rishis whose names are given (some of
them with their father's name) and ends up with Brahman.  You can count
about 58 teachers in lineage starting with Brahman followed by
Hiranyagarbha.  If as per the secularist calculation
Brihadhaaranyakopanishad is somewhere about the first or second millenium BC
then the world must have started sometimes equal to what the Bible says!
This is of course if we consider that no humans lived beyond 100 years.  But
the Hindu belief is that the world started from the beginning of Kritha Yuga
and it is millions of years back.  If you are a secular historian you
definitely branch off from our belief.  There is no escape from it. That is
where the 'scholar' as you see and I see differ.

With best regards,
Anbu
