Hello Everyone,

Namaste.

I am a silent member in this group. I am beginner in advaita.

I came across Sanskrit course in IGNOU, it is a collaborative effort of
IGNOU and Chinmaya International Foundation. Wonderful initiative.
It is a 6 month online course for beginners. *Please check the item-5 in the
website below*. As the document is too large, I am unable to attach.
