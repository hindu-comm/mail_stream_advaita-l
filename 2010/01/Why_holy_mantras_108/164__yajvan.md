Namaste Michael,

Regarding 108 to the sun - 108 does not equal the actual measurement:

The earth to the sun measured in the number of the sun's diameters. The sun is 1.4 million km (870,000 miles) in diameter. The avg. distance to the sun is 149 million km ( or 91 to 94.5 million miles). So this math gives you 106 to 107 of the sun's diameters from here to Surya (sun). 


Regarding 108  Upaniṣad-s vs. the potential of 1180
One may ask, How many potential upaniṣad-s are there? As many sakha-s सख ( tree ) or branches, some call recensions found in the veda. But how many? Well, the ṛg veda has 21 recensions, yajur veda (from yajus - worship, sacrifice) has 109, some say 101; the sāma veda (from sāman - song or tune; and sā is 'sin destroying') has 1000; The atharva veda (atharvan - brahmā's eldest son to whom he revealed the brahma-vidyā) has 50 recensions & some say there are 9 . 

Hence a total of 1,180 recensions. From a numbers perspective this 1180 can be viewed as 1+1+8+0 = 10 , the sum of the digits of 1,180. This 10 says Fullness of the Relative field of life = 1, and Fullness of the Absolute level of life or 0. This 10 is the Fullness of saguṇa + nirguṇa = Brahman. The subject of 10 has been discussed in past posts for those that have interest

Perhaps I should add an example to my question :

If the Sun is distant from us 108 times its diameter (who measured it ?) :
then is this just a simple fact, like 'this flower has seven petals'; or is it a clue to Creation, the Bramanda itself ? Unless we are clear about the significance of numbers in the divine science, it seems to me that we could demote number into some sort of superstitious 'magic'..

If the diameter of the Sun is thus related to distance, this would be an implication for the study of gravitational pull..

The examples of 108 given recently sem to me to vary in their significance and implications... 108 Upanishads.. ?

This does raise the question : is 'number' and numbers, part of the active agency of Creation (as for instance the Circle of Nine Points would
suggest) -- thus a sort of hidden aspect of empirical science; or simply a reminder of the nature of that Creation; or both ? (I hope this makes
sense..)
