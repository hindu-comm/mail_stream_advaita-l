108 is the ratio of the distance between the Earth and the Sun divided by the diameter of the Sun. Similarly 108 is also the ratio of the distance between the Moon and the Earth divide by the diameter of the Moon. The ancient seers saw some significance in the number 108.
1008 times chanting is also important and the number 1008 has some other significance.

Ramesh, pranams

Mantra and japa are complex subjects, with various numbers and speeds
mentioned. The online Hindupedia has attempted to sum up the subject; but
there are many traditions.

On the number 108, regarded as special and sometimes said to be derived from
jyotisha, mathematicians might note (and I can't give a further explanation
!), that 108 happens to be 1 to the power of one (i.e.1) times 2 to the
power of two (i.e.4) times three to the power of three (i.e. 27).

Dear Learned List members,

Pranams,
Can the learned members of the board clarify this doubt of mine please?
Why are Holy Manthras chanted 108 Times? why not any other number? Thanks

 Ramanan.
