Several scholars suggest that the number 108 became sacred because the
average sun-to-earth distance is approximately 108 times the sun's
diameter. This ratio can be determined using simple school-level
geometrical principles, i.e. by installing a pole of height 'x' at a
given point and moving a distance 'y' away from it such that the pole
covers the sun's diameter in the observer's angle of vision. The ratio
y/x is the required number.
