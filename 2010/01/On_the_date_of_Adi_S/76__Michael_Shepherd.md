You guys who claim to be Advaitins but behave as if you've never heard of
Sanatana Dharma, should drop this racial discrimination..

Someone with an Englsh name who's not called David Frawley, John Grimes or
Dennis Waite comes on the site, and you behave as if it's free licence for
Raj-bashing.. Get a life !

I asked for specific information about the shastric illuminations on
saakshin. You distorted the question in order to insult me. I didn't get one
helpful answer, which would have related its use in Advaita Vedanta to that
in Samkya and Dvaita Vedanta, and helped me understand the precise use of
the term -- which some commentators simply take as a synonym for atman..
Well, is it or isn't it ?

What those many people whom Jaldhar introduces to us as 'seeking
illumination about Advaita Vedanta' must think of the goings-on on this
site, I tremble to think.

Michael. (I don't use my given sacred name on this site for reasons of my
own.)

Subject: [Advaita-l] On the date of Adi Shankara



On Jan 1,Michel Shepherd wrote:
I f I were a dramatist with time on my hands and the urge to do so,I would
go through all Adi Shankara's commentaries,knowing that every time
"objector"raises his (or her) voice it would be that Shankara had faced
that question from the greatest minds of other sects in lively open public
debate....and included that Q&A in his oral record to prepare his
disciples for the great debate themselves.
I think that by the time I had set that dramatically,I would have a lively
drama of ideas on my hands which required no more attention to the date of
his opportune embodiment to set matters straight for us than the decision
which period should the costumes represent?"

What does Michel think?Is Shankara a dramatist like William Shakespeare to
pen down his dramas?Then,why should michel worry about whether Atman is a
Shakshi or not?Let him leave his Atman alone.
