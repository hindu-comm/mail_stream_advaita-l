Sivaanandalahari - 86पूजद्रव्य-समृद्धयो विरचिता: पूजां कथं कुर्महे

जाने मस्तक-मंघ्रिपल्लव-मुमाजाने न तेऽहं विभो
न ज्ञातं हि पितामहेन हरिणा तत्वेन तद्रूपिणा ॥ ८६ ॥

Oh Consort of Uma! Oh Omnipresent ! Puja drvyas ( materials used for Puja )
are kept collected. ( But) How to do the puja? I have not attained the form
of swan or the form of boar and that is not possible. I have not found your
crown or the lotus feet ( to do puja) Even Brahma and Vishnu who could
attain the form of swan and Boar could not know them.

Hey! ParamEswara! You are shining as the Punyamoorthy because you have the
company of MangaLavathi Paarvathi.  I have collected the poojadravyas to do
shOdachOpachaara pooja to you but I am unable to determine how I should do
it.  Should I take the form of swan to see the top of your head? Or should I
become a boar and keep digging the earth to find your holy feet?  Did not
Brahma and Vishnu fail in their mission taking those forms?  Don't you know
that I do not have such abilities to change into those forms?  Then how am I
supposed to worship you?  First of all I have to have the dharshanam of your
lotus feet and then only can I be able to do poojanam to them.  If those
holy feet are dhurlabham to the devathaas from Vishnu downwards how would I
be able to do the poojanam and get my janma sapalam?

So be reasonable and give me the baagyam to do dharshanam of your holy feet
by revealing them to me so I can do bilwaarchanai to them.

Aum Namasivaaya!
