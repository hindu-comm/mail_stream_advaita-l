You practised dancing in the mountainous region with your soft feet knowing
that I am going to take birth and you have to dance in my hard mind in order
to protect me. Else when you had the facility to dance in divine homes or in
flower beds why did you not dance there but in rocky surfaces?

Hey! ParamEswara! How can I describe your kaaruNyam?  You have known that I
am going to be born in this world and that my mind is going to be a very
hard place (நெஞ்சக்கனகல்). And you also know that you would be dancing on my
mind which is harder than the rock.  Knowing that your soft feet would be
hurt when you dance on my mind you decided to train them to bear it by
dancing on the pebble laden rocky mountain even though you have access to
palatial buildings and softest beds.  You did this in order to ensure that
my janma gets its sapalam even though there is nothing for you to gain in
this.  Yes, I cannot describe your kaaruNyam at all!

Aum Namasivaaya!
