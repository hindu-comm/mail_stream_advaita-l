Oh Lord who wears the moon on the head, your food is poison, flower is moon
and ornament is Nagaraja ( the lord of Snakes) and your dress is the hides
of Tiger and elephant.I am not capable of churning the ocean ( to take out
the poison )neither can I break up the Patala nor am I a good talented
hunter to hunt the tigers and elephants. Then Please tell how I can organise
the Puja with flowers, ornaments and dress?

Hey! Chandrasekharaa! How can I do pooja to you with food, flowers, jewels
and clothes?  You should tell me.  Hey! ParamEswara! If I had the ability to
churn the ocean then I would do that and bring the aalahaala visham and feed
you with that.  If I had the ability to break into paathaaLa lOka I will
collect all the sarpaas and adore you with them.  If I have the abillity to
hunt the terrible animals then I would kill an elephant and skin it to give
you as a vasthram.  Knowing that I do not have these abilities you should
show me mercy and help with doing sivapooja in a different way.

Aum Namasivaaya!
