Oh Uma Mahesvara ! one who does archana to your holy feet for sometime,
meditation and samadhi for sometime, some worship, spend some time in
hearing the stories of Lord Shiva, seeing you, does some pryaers, and with
joy surrenders his mind to you and attains such a state will attain
liberation even while living with the body.

*Umaa MahEswara!  This is jeevan Mukthi!  *

Hey! UmaapathE!  Whoever, sometime does archana to your lotus feet with
bilvadhaLas, sometime worships your mangaLa vigraham in complete dhyaanam,
sometime remains as aaruda in nirvikalpa samaadhi (i.e. in the raaja yoga
nishtha of the mahaavaakya 'thath thvam asi' knowing that the Paramasiva of
thath padhaartham is non-different from the thvam padhaartham of the
lakshyaartham of one's aathmaswaroopam thus remaining as 'aham
brahmaasmi'),  sometime keep falling at your feet in complete prEma,
sometime hearing your dhivya saritham, sometime just staring at your mangaLa
vigraham, sometime describing your indescribable mahimaa, and sometime, as
if the above are not enough, in the words of the saasthra,

thasmaath sarvEshu kaalEshu maamanusmara yuddhaya cha |
mayyarpithamanObuddhi: maamEvEshyathi na samsaya: ||

taking your promise as sacred in his head and in greatest happiness being a
man of complete surrender, that person, O! UmaapathE! is the one who had
attained Mukthi while living.  AachaaryaaL emphasises this with the word
'khalu' meaning 'is there any doubt at all'.

BhagavathpaadhaaL has written a grantham called "Jeevanmuthaanandhalahari"
to describe the various states in which one can find Jeevan Mukthas and this
sloka is just a gist of the same.

People may raise the following doubt on the contention that the jeevan
mukthaas are bhakthi upaasakas.

Is it not a fact that the jeevan mukthas have got everything destroyed by
brahma vidhya including that very vidhyaa itself.  Becuase of this they do
not have the avidhya that remains as the aasrayam (basis) of the praarabhdha
karma.  When such is the case how is it that their paancha bouthika sthoola
sareeram keeps shining? When the sareeram has the baasitham how can you call
the sareeree as jeevan muktha?

Let us contemplate a bit on how these doubts are allayed.

samyakgnaanaadhighamaath dharmaadheenaam akaraNapraapthO |
thishtathisamskaaravasaath charkrabramadhdhathasareera: ||

The potter has a wheel for making the pot and it is called kulaalachakram.
When the potter spins this kulaalachakram fast at the beginning, this
chakram will keep spinning for a long time before it comes to a stop.  In
the same way the sareeram of jeevan mukthas even after avidhyaanasam
obtained by the brahmavidhya, by the prior sakthi that kept the body running
keeps its baasitham but that does not mean those who attained jeevan mukthi
cannot be jeevan mukthas.  Therefore those who, for all the time remain,
sivabhakthi upaasakas in different forms are to be known as jeevan mukthaas.

Anyone who understands this and recites this slOka with bhakthi in their
heart and do a namaskaaram to ParamEswara are sure to attain jeevan mukthi
in their kaalakrama.
