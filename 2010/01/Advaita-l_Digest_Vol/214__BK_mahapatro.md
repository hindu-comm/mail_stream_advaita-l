*Hari Oum,*

Vardhraja ji seems to be having a point, but my info is also very limited.
Hence while I am forwarding what I have, I am quite conscious that there are
many illustrious members  in this forum, who can really enlighten us in this
respect .However, let me tell what I have gathered:

*A)Yuga callender:*
**
1) Pralay / disolution takes place at the end of  one Kalpa (Rest period of
Bramha)
I am not sure whether "kalpa bata" is the rescue vehicle w.r t this process
'Rest'!

2) one Kalpa (one Day of Bramha) = 14 Manavantara(s) i.e period of each
Manu.
 *Current Kalpa is "sweta Varah Kalpa"*

3)in this Kalpa 6 manavantaras have already elapsed (names available on
record) and *the current 7th Manavantara is called Vaivasatwa Manu*)"

4) one Manavantara= 71 chaturyugas (Satya/Kitya Yuga; Treta Yuga:Dwapara
Yuga; and Kali Yuga.

5) each Chaturyuga =12000 Deva varsh(s) (or Divya varsh; 4800 in
Kritya;  3,600 in Treta; 2,400 in Dwapara; and 1,200 in Kali)

6)one Deva varsh=360 Ahoratra(s) i.e Human years.

7) each Ahoratra=360   human/ Mortal-ays (day and night as we know)

 *B) Period of Bramha:*
**
And now, going upwards in the Cellestial Callender, I gather that :

i) One Divine year=360 days of Bramha (one Day-Kalpa and plus one night/Rest
period)

ii) 100 Divine years = one Bramha varsh (period of one Bramha)

*C) count for  "Manu(s)*
**
It is also mentioned in the same context  that Bramha creats / appoints:

a)  14 "Manus" in one day (of Bramha)

b) 420 "Manus" in one month (of Bramha)

c) 5040 "Manus" in one year (of Bramha)


d) 504000  "Manus" in one Period (of Bramha)

*D) "Mahapralay*
**
Since it is said that "Vishnu" is the Supreme and Sole Creator, who appoints
Bramha , it is ony logical to visualise that there might be a
"*Mahapralay"*at the change over of each "Bramha
*" ie at the elapse  of504000 "Manu"(s)*
**
*.( Irequest the knowledgeble members to probably intervene here reg
terminalogy as well as calculations ,if any)*

E) T*he Cellestaial Canvas*
**
*It has also been envisioned that there are millions of"Bramha"s in the
BRAMHAND (universe), n at any given point of time of  KALAMAHA SINDHU.*
*(i could not correlate with C_(a) above. I shall read these references
again to clear the understanding).*

I stop it here with a humble request to be educated further.

 H*ari oum

BKM.
