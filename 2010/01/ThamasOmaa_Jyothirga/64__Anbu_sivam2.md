Sivasenaniji,

Namasthe.  Thanks for agreeing with me.

You have said that there is need to investigate events in time and space but
you gave no reason for such need.  Also you have said that we cannot and
should not invoke maaya so flippantly.  In my opinion there is no flippancy
at all in what I have said.  It was done completely based on the conviction
that is ingrained in me and is inseparable from me.  Moreover  you have not
explained what constitutes flippancy and neither have you given any
guidelines as to when maaya should be 'invoked' and showing that such
guidelines are not arbitrary and such guidelines are never be held
flippant.  The readers and I were never made aware of any saasthra pramaaNam
that would support the guidelines if any for the invocation of the word
'maaya'.  Having said that I hold that this may be frivolous topic now that
you have agreed on the conclusion.

On the investigation in question a great deal of attempt is being made to
fit one of the greatest masters of our philosophy into a 'C' era where this
C's existence itself is questioned by those for whom this C was relevant
viz. the westerners.  I just typed the words "jesus did not exist" into the
google and to my surprise it gave me 1,600,000 results in just a small
fraction of second of search with so much research to the fact he did not
exist at all!   Again this is only of those discussion that are made
available on the internet that the search engine could cover in a fraction
of a second!  I am saying this to show how fragile is the 'time' that the
westerners are anchored in!  It is beyond the scope of the list to discuss
about the reasons for Christ's non-existence let alone his existence.

My humble opinion is that there can be no soulless, mechanical even
intellectual discussion on Advaita and it is not possible to discuss advaita
without the sensibility to its import.  That sensibility is rooted in the
bhakthi of what constitutes Reality (Aum that Sat) and what constitutes
Maaya (who is depicted as AmbaaL, His consort).  That way advaita and maaya
are intertwined.  That is all I can say to you on this matter.

If I have to tread a bit in the world of maaya and say of something positive
on time,  why not let me wish you and all the readers a Happy New Year
forgetting whether such years are founded in reality of Paramarthika or
vyavaharika.!

Regards,
