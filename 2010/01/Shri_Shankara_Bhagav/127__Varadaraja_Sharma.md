Radhe KrishnaThe compositions of purvacharyals of Dakshinamnaya Sharada PeethamJagadgurus Shri Sachidananda Shivabhinvava Nrusimha Bharathi Swamigal andShri Chandra Shekara Bharathi Swamigal have been published by Srirangam VaniVilas Press.Like purvacharyals, Acharyal Jagadguru Shri Bharathi Tirtha Mahaswamigal hasalso composed sthothras and kirthanams in vivida vruthas which has beenpublished by Dakshinamnaya Sharada Peetham.We use to recite many sthuthisand kirthanams regularly.Shri Shankara Bhagavathpadacharya Sthuthi is oneamong them composed in the same vrutham of ganesha pancha ratnam.Incidentally, like Ganesha pancharatnam starts with "mudakaratha modakam",this sthuthi starts with "mudakarena pusthakam".Shriman Vidyasankar hasgiven links as to what mahasannidanam Jagadguru Shri Abhinvava VidyatirthaSwamigal said about date of adya acharyal.Related aspect is covered inthis sthuthi. Srungeri devotees would like to read this sthuthi.We are devotees of Dakshinamnaya Sharada Peetham, and although we have ourconsidered opinions formed on the basis of historical facts, we very muchrespect every yativaral in smartha sampradaya and why not - yativaralbelonging to Srivaishnava and paramavasihnava sampradayas.I hope thosewhohad opportunity to observe the Ganapathi Vakyartha Sathas that takesplace in Sringeri every year would agree with me having observed thepresence of scholars cutting across sampradayas.On issues related to date of Adya Acharyal or maths, either a personignorethese issues altogetheror if someone wishes to go about these issues,purelystudy these issueswith historical perspectivewith out consideringaffiliation to any math.So many people have written volumes on every related issue raised in theearlier postsin this mailing list and in many other lists. i think thisissue has been deliberated n number of times.my humble suggestion is either this issue is not at all discussed or if atall discussed let it be devoid of heat and with clear focus on aspecifically taken up issue with out circumvending it with related issues.Radhe Krishna
