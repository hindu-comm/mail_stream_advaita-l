The issue here is what they hold as important. The shaiva priests hold
shaiva-agamas to be more important than the vedas and hence lesser status.
You can see Sankara also dismissing pA~ncarAtra followers as not holding the
veda in high regard (explicitly calling it lower than the veda itself) and
hence should not be accepted (towards the very end of his discussion on the
vyUhas).

shaiva-Agamas or pA~ncarAtra Agamas are not held as smR^iti by the orthodox
brahmins. Ramanuja and others tried to change this - but you can see the
tension between vedic and non-vedic elements in their sub-sect arguments.

shrauta karmas or smR^iti karmas have equal validity as well explained by
the mImA.msaka-s. The section on the pAshupata and pAncarAtra in the
brahma-sUtras was specifically to combat the view that since some of the
elements of both were accepted by sampradAyavits, that they have to be
accepted completely as smR^iti.

On a more practical level, gurukkals are usually trained neither in veda
recitation (except for some sUktams and perhaps rudra-chamakam in the case
of the shaivas), nor in the smArta karmas.
