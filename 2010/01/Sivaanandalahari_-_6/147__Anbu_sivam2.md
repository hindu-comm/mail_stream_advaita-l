I seek refuge in the incomparable meditation of Lord Sadashiva, which is the
fertile land for growing various types of joys, which brings out tears of
happiness, which is scintillating and praised by those who seek the eternal
state of Moksha or liberation.

விளையுஞ் சிவானந்த பூமி - அந்த
வெட்ட வெளிநண்ணித் துட்ட இருளாங்
களையைக் களைந்துபின் பார்த்தேன் - ஐயன்
களையன்றி வேறொன்றுங் கண்டிலன் தோழி - சங்கர சங்கர சம்போ
(தாயுமானவர்)

I surrender to sadhaasivadhyaanam which is uthamOthamam that is worshipped
by those desiring mOkshasthalam of kailaasa, that raises one's hair in
horripilation and that which sends out tears of joy in torrents.

'sadhaa' stands for Paarvathi's swaroopam and Sivan stands for ParamEswara
swaroopam.  Sadhaasiva thathwam should be known as the akhanda aanandha
thathwam consisting of the inseparable paarvathi-paramEswaraaL.  It is
important that no upaasana should be done separating Siva and Shakthi.  This
is underscored by AachaaryaaL by the use of the word "parama", that is,
sadhaasiva thathvam is vilakshaNam to jatadEhaathis, sadhaasiva thathvam is
that which is sarvOthkrushtam and uthamOthama thathvam and that thathvam is
the swaroopam of sadhaasiva.

Nama: paarvathee pathayE hara hara mahaadeva!
