Sivaanandalahari - 65वक्षस्ताडन-शंकया विचलितो वैवस्वतो निर्जरा:

यच्चेत-स्तव पादपद्म-भजनं तस्येह किं दुर्लभं ॥ ६५ ॥

What is impossible to attain for the one who does service to your Lotus feet
? Oh Bavanipati ! Yama runs away being afraid of your kick at his chest.
Devas are lighting the Camphor with the bud like shining light from the gems
in their crown. The bride of liberation embraces him at the very sight.

Let us trek back to the fourth slOka:

sahasram vartante jagati vibudhA: kShudraphaladA
na manye svapne vA tadanusaraNaM tatkRutaphalam |
hari-brahmAdInAmapi nikiTabhAjA-masulabhaM
chiraM yAche SaMbho Siva tava pAdAMbhoja-bhajanaM || 4 ||

In this stanza to the uthamOthaman, anirvachaneeya mahaathmyan and mahaa
kailaasaadhipathi ParamEswara our aachaaryaaL begged: "Hey! KaaruNyajalathE!
After all I am only a sanyaasi.  Yet my mind has been waiting for a very
long time to do poojanam and bhajanam to your paadhaabjam yet never has so
far been blessed with that bhaagyam.   Please give me that fortune."  In
this slOka Bhagavathpaadhaal describes that the paadhaabhjam that he had
begged for before, were to be attained because of one's poorva puNya then
what sivadhyaana can do.

naasthi dyaanasamam theertham naasthi dyaanasamam thapa: |
naasthi dyaanasamO yagnyasthasmaathdhyaanam samaacharEth ||

The saasthra says: there is no puNya theertham beyond sivadhyaanam neither
is there a greater thapas than sivadhyaanam.  There is no superiior yagnyaa
to surpass sivadhyaanam and therefore sakala praaNis should do sivadhyaanam
always.  Therefore Hey! ParamEswara! when someone is doing dhyaanam to your
paadhakamalam yamaa runs far away from him!  Because in a earlier time when
Yama attempted to snatch the praaNan of MaarkandEya when he was doing
sivadhyaanam he got a kick of his life time in his chest which Yamaa never
forgets.

kaalakaNtam kalaamoorthim kaalaagnim kaalanaasanam
namaami sirasaa dEva kim nO mruthyu: karishyathi ||
gangaadharam sasidharam sankaram soolapaaNinam |
namaami sirasaa devamkinO mruthyu: karishyathi
chandrasEkharamaasrayE mama kimkarishyathi vai yama: ||

That is how MaarkanDeya cried out to ParamEswara hugging the lingam so
tightly.  This was sivadhyaanam par excellence!  When Yama distrubed that he
got an unforgettable kick on his chest!

Hey! PrabhO! To him who does sivadhyaanam you make the three lOkas come into
his aadheenam.  When his sivadhyaanam leads him into manOnaasam the
mahaavaakya 'thath thwam asi' transaforms into the girl called Mukthi who
tighly hugs him.  Thus bhagavathpaadhaaL says that there is nothing that is
beyond the reach of a person doing sivadhyaanam.

Mruthyunjaya mahadEva MahEswara Sankara subha Charanaa!
