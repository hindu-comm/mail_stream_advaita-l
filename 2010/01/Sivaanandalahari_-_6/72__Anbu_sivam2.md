Oh Lord, the mother called devotion,
Bathes with tears of joy and feels enthralled,
Dresses she using the clean and pure mind,
Feeds and fills up the belly she with the nectar of your stories,
Found in words at the tip of the conch like vessel,
Protects she the body with Rudraksha and ash as amulets,
And takes care of the devotee child,
Placed in the cradle of Your memory.

காதலாகிக் கசிந்து கண்ணீர்மல்கி
ஓதுவார் தமை நன்னெறிக் குய்ப்பது
வேத நான்கினு மெய்ப்பொருளாவது
நாதன் நாம நமச்சிவாயமே.
(சம்பந்தர் தேவாரம்)

According to the sookthi 'kuputhrO jaayEtha kkachithapi kumaathaa na
bhavathi' there can be wicked kids but not wicked mother.  That is why in
this sloka bhakthi is portrayed as mother.  The mother called bhakthi will
never give up on the child called bhakthaa.  Even if the child is not a
yogyasthan to attain mOksha she would prepare him for that, thus protecting
the child.  Hey! Swayamprakaasi!  Hey! ParamporuLE! The mother called
bhakthi with her tears of brahmaanandha is bathing the child called bhakthaa
drenching him into a horripilation.

The Sasthra says:

“SivO dhaathaa SivO bhOkthaa Sivassarvamidham jagath |
Siva: sarvaaNi bhoothaani Sivaadhanyath na kinchana ||”

Mother Bhakthi is donning on this Bhaktha the child the vasthram of
manObhaavam that there is nothing beyond Parameswara, that all is Siva only.
Moreover, knowing that the child would be hungry and thirsty, mother Bhakthi
through the ‘sangu’ called vaak is feeding the milk of your charitham all
the time to assuage his thirst and hunger. Also with rudhraaksham and
vibhoothi she is relieving the bhaktha of the fears of the world.

Also the saasthraa says:

“naasthi dhyaanasamam thaartham naasthi dhyaanasamam thapa: |
naasthi dhyaanasamO yagna: thasmaadhyaanam samaacharEth ||”

There is no theertham greater than sivadhyaanam; there is no greater thapas
than sivadhyaanam; there is no yagna higher than sivadhyaanam and so all
praaNis should do sivadhyaanam. Only by this sivadhyaanam can one attain
nirvikalpa samaadhi and experience the state of ‘SivOham’. That is why the
mother Bhakthi puts the child bhaktha in the cradle called sivadhyaanam and
protect him, says BhagavatpaadhaaL.

Siva Siva Siva BO!
