It is very important to know if the book has been approved by the Mathadhipati of Sringeri. I may not agree with the Sringeri version of the date of Adi Sankara but I hold the Sringeri Swamiji in great esteem.

Of course the shAradA chatushshati has a connection with Sringeri,
because the shAradA referred to is the shAradA of Sringeri. It was
authored by j~nAnAnandanAtha (rAmamUrti shAstri of Guntur) in 1930 and
is dedicated to shrI chandrashekharabhAratI mahAsvaminaH.

The author's guru shrI satyanandanAtha was a gR^ihastha
shrIvidyopAsaka from Andhra and had stayed in Sringeri for a few years
to study advaita-vedAnta fom the then jagadguru shrI sacchidAnanda
shivAbhinava nR^isiMha bhAratI mahAsvAminaH.

shrIvidyA has both samaya and vAma variants.

SKRR's book is available from Satguru Publications, Delhi.
