Did you find it having any connection with the Sringeri math? This was definitely not a composition of Adi Sankara nor was it of Gaudapadacharya. It could have been composed by a later Sankaracharya. Has the text of Rao's book been authenticated by the present Mathadhipati of the Sringeri math?
Sri Vidya is Samayachara Tantra as opposed to the Vamachara Tantra.. Many people may not realise that the Sarada Chatuh-shati is a tantric text and that may be the reason for which late S.K. Ramachanra Rao gave the title "Tantric practices in Sri Vidya".
Do you have any idea as to how it differs from the Sarada Tilak Tantra? Also how is it different from the Lalita
 Trishati?
Lastly do you have the address of the publishers of the book?

The Sharada 400 is a work on Srividya and it tries to correlate shankara's advaita with shrIvidya rituals..though the connection looks somewhat
 artificial.

On an aside I find the title a bit strange... It sounds something similar to "Shaiva practices in Shaiva Agama" . How else can shrIvidya be other than tAntrik in its outlook?

Dear friends,
I understand that the Sringeri Math had given the
 Lalita Trishati bhashya (a tentric text) of Adi Sankara for publication. But there is also a Sarada Chatucchati (a tantric text) related to Mother Sarada. Has any member any information if the Sringeri math had published that or whether any copy of that is available from any other source?
Regards,
Sunil K. Bhattacharjya
