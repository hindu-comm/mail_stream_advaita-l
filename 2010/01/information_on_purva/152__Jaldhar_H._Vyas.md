I also hope you find it useful but alas, this is another project that is 
suffering from my total lack of free time.  In fact much of the site has 
been broken for a while.  I just fixed it up again now so if you went

(And yes, understanding purva mimamsa is essential for understanding 
uttara mimamsa or vedanta.)
