It is also believed that Har(i) ki Pairi in Gangadwar (Haridwar) is after the name of Bhartrihari. The end of the rule of his half-brother Vikrama is said to correspond to the Vikrama Samvat, which started in 457 BCE and this era has been mentioned by Alberuni.

> The patanjali-vijaya (also called patanjali-carita) of Ramabhadra Dikshita should only be taken as a great poetic drama about Patanjali, the author of the mahAbhAshya on Sanskrit grammar. It makes not only bhartRhari and vikrama to be brothers, but also adds vararuci and bhaTTi to the family! Each of them is said to have been born to the same father, but different mothers. Also, the kAvya gives the name as candragupta, not as candraSarmA.

The part about Bhartrahari and Vikrama being half-brothers atleast is not unique to that author. How Bhartrahari became king and banished his brother, then became more and more dissolute until the adultery of his queen caused him to become disillusioned with worldly life and to abdicate the throne in favor of Vikrama is part of popular folklore in Northern parts of India as part of the cycle of stories concerning "Vikrama and the Vampire." and also the legends of the yogi saint Gorakhnath. I think I first heard it in an Amar Chitra Katha type comic many years ago.
