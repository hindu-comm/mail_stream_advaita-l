Dear Sri Satish

I have not read the book you mention but I have an issue with your statement about Sri Vidya being tantric. 

The dakshinaacara or samayaacaara sampradaaya that is called Sri Vidya is firmly a part of orthodox advaita; I will go to the extent of saying it is the foremost amongst specific-to-advaita-vedanta vidyas (that is excluding all Srauta and grihya karmas, japas like that of hayagreeva japa etc. which other vedantins also practice).

The text of this work along with a translation can be found in late S K Ramachandra Rao's book Tantric Practices in SriVidya

The Sharada 400 is a work on Srividya and it tries to correlate shankara's advaita with shrIvidya rituals..though the connection looks somewhat artificial.

On an aside I find the title a bit strange... It sounds something similar to "Shaiva practices in Shaiva Agama" . How else can shrIvidya be other than tAntrik in its outlook?

Dear friends,
I understand that the Sringeri Math had given the Lalita Trishati bhashya (a tentric text) of Adi Sankara for publication. But there is also a Sarada Chatucchati (a tantric text) related to Mother Sarada. Has any member any information if the Sringeri math had published that or whether any copy of that is available from any other source?
Regards,
Sunil K. Bhattacharjya
