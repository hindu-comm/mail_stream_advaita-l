Dear friends,
I understand that the Sringeri Math had given the Lalita Trishati bhashya (a tentric text) of Adi Sankara for publication. But there is also a Sarada Chatucchati (a tantric text) related to Mother Sarada. Has any member any information if the Sringeri math had published that or whether any copy of that is available from any other source?
Regards,
Sunil K. Bhattacharjya
