(I wrote this to Austin Veda Group  in 2006, it may have errors and it was
mainly written to improve my understanding - your corrections and comments
are welcome)
-------------------------------------------------------------------
I have tried to understand the Rk gaNaanan tva.  Please correct. If you have
unicode font on your machine, you should be able to read the sanskrit terms
correctly. I will try to format it better and send a PDF later.

Brief Meaning:

We offer oblations and invite you, the lord of all groups, wise amongst the
wise, lord of all veda-s, foremost among the foremost, and one whose fame is
most excellent; come to us and be seated in our home/place  to protect us.

This Rk addresses the lord with 5 epithets and addresses him directly in

deva-s

d) ज्येष्ठ राजन् - ज्येष्ठानाम् राजन्, foremost among the foremost
e) उपम श्रव तम - one whose fame (shrava) is most excellent (upama), tama
suffix makes it superlative
