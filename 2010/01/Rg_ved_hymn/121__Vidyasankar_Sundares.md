It is not one word, but two, connected by simple sandhi - shR^iNvan + UtibhiH = shR^iNvannUtibhiH.

shR^iNvan derives from dhAtu shru - to hear. shR^iNvan = having heard, just like gacchan = having
gone, tiShThan = having stood, pashyan = having seen, etc. UtibhiH = Uti + bhiH = plural instrumental
case form of noun Uti (with meaning 1 above).



> That said, I have also seen this word spelled two ways:

> 1. ṣṛṇvannūtibhiḥ - as mentioned in the hymn offered
> 
> 2. śṛṅvattūtibhiḥ 


The second spelling is wrong. Any publication that has it has not been proof-read properly before
printing. This R^ik is never recited that way.
