Could we say that the Self-Realization is the abandonment of the false
identification rather than a recognition?

praNAms
Hare Krishna

Abandonment of the false identification with BMI happens naturally every 
day without our knowledge in sushupti...So, the recongnition that we are 
THAT has to happen in a state where our buddhi is wide awake (jAgruta 
buddhi) :-))  Hence there is shruti vAkya :  manasaivedamAptavyaM neha 
nAnAsti kiMchana...and shankara's words : manaH Atmadarshane karaNaM.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
