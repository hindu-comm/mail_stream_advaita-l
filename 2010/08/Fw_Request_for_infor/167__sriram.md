The Brihadharanya Upanishad4.3.38 and 4.4.2,4.4.4 speak about the final exit 
of the Athman.One can go through Brahma Suthras also -final chapters give 
good description about what happens to the one who is liberated and who is 
yet to.I hope this will answer his quest.About astral  body its travel 
rebirth etc are elaborately discussed in Parama Hamsa Yoganandha`s book The 
Auto biography of a yogi.R.Krishnamoorthy.

Hi Badisa,

I was googling for some information on soul, its mode of exit of body, and 
its destination. I found that you actively involved on this discussion long 
back at advaita thread list.

I am looking for some specific information, and do not know if it is 
appropiate to ask you about it. In case you do not have any information, can 
you please request your advaita list members on my behalf to give some 
inputs on this. Thanks a lot for your help.The following is the question:

Do you know any person (yogis) in India who can do astral projection/astral 
travel with subtle body, and have good clairvoyant capacity?

If yes, could you please let me know their names and contact details. I will 
be grateful for your kind help.

Thanks
Ram Suri
