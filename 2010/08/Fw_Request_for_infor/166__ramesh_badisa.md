Hi Badisa,

I wasgoogling for some information on soul, its mode of exit of body, and its destination. I found that you actively involved on this discussion long back at advaita thread list.

I am looking for some specific information, anddo not know if it is appropiate to ask you about it.In case you do not have any information, can you please request your advaita list members on my behalf to give some inputs on this. Thanks a lot for your help.The following is the question:

Do you know any person (yogis) in India who can do astral projection/astral travel with subtle body, and have good clairvoyant capacity? 

If yes, could you please let me know their names and contact details. I will be grateful for your kind help.

Thanks
Ram Suri
