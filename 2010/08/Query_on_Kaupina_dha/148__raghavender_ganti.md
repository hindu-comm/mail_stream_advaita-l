Sri Gurubhyon Namaha
 I wish to ask the learned members if there 
are any specific mantras that have to be chanted prior to Kaupina dharana, and 
also of any prescribed procedure. I was invested with sacred thread 25 years ago 
and i did wear kaupina and performed my nitya karmas till went to the US, i gave 
up my shikha and kaupina after my travel to the mleccha desa, now that i am back 
in my karma bhoomi, i wish to follow the rules by scriptures as much as 
possible, i am a follower of krishna yajurveda. Any help in this matter is 
greatly apreciated.
Sri Kamakshi
Raghav
