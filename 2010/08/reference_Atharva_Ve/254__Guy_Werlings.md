he priya mitrAH |



I have read somewhere that the Atharva Veda contains the following two mantras. Could any list-member whose family are followers of Atharva Veda help me with the exact reference and if possible the Sanskrit text in Itrans encoding.

Quote

We are the birds of the same nest, 
We may wear different skins, 
We may speak different languages, 
We may believe in different religions, 
We may belong to different cultures, 
Yet we share the same home - OUR EARTH. 

Born on the same planet 
Covered by the same skies 
Gazing at the same stars 
Breathing the same air 
We must learn to happily progress together 
Or miserably perish together, 
For man can live individually, 
But can survive only collectively
