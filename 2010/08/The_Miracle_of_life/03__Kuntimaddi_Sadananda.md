Sriramji - PraNAms
Yes indeed. Life is so beautiful and wonderful indeed. It is amazing
how two innocent looking tiny cells unfold themselves into intelligent
human being – it is miracle of miracles, indeed - I cannot but stop
wondering how this body works, how it thinks, and how it functions -
all starting from a tiny cell. Every where I look outside I see the
life pulsating in abundance in every form, in every insect, in every
plant with multiple colors - I cannot contain that wonder - other than
prostrating at the every expression of it. I see the life as the
expression of joy in manifold.

Hari Om!
Sadananda

>>
>> I am glad I am breathing, of course, my wife is sleeping upstairs.
>> Some times I wonder what happens when I stop breathing. I am again

>> breathing, when I am not doing it to begin with. My mind starts

>> complain – why it does want to learn from the roses. I still wonder -
>> what happens when I am no more alive and I see that everybody minding
>> their own business as usual after shedding few tears here and there
>> for some time. What happens to my bank balance and all those stocks,
>> and the loan I made or the money I gave? Who cares when I am not
>> alive? Am I alive now? I think so since breathing is going on. What is
>> life anyway? I wonder.
>>
>>
>> PS. Please excuse my ramblings, but I cannot but stop wondering.
