Sanyasa is not staying with wife at  home and saying I am sanyasi. If
this is the definition it is wrong. Sanyasi must separate from wife
and family members. if he is Brahmachari he must separate from
parents. he performs his Sraddha. his Purvashrama person is dead.
there is  particular sanyasa ceremony. he must follow all rules and
regulations of sanyasa. if you say this is not sanyasa we should
laugh.

Sudras and others below them cannot be sanyasis. No sanyasa means no moksha.
