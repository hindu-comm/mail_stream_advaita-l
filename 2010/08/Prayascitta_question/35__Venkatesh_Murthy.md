Our Hindu Dharma describes some Prayascittas in case a Brahmin lives
with non Hindus. He must not live in foreign country where no
varnasrama followed. If he is forcibly living there he must do
prayascitta after return. Some people say he must do Tapas like
Prajapathya or Candrayana. Request learned members for replies. What
if he is not forcibly living in foreign country but living for
education money, fame etc ? The Prayascitta is same or more? This is
common now.But in olden days Brahmins were captured forcibly and lived
with Mlecchas. they liked to live in countries following varnasrama.
Does wife also do Prayascitta?
