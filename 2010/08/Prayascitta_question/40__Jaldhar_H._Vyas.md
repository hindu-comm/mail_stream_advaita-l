Not only must the perpetrators perform prayaschitta but they must submit 
to the "Danda" (civil justice.)  Then only will their papa karma be 
reduced.  But advaita vedanta tells us that as long as they keep notions 
like "this property is mine not yours" they will continue suffering from 
the ups and downs of karma.  Vairagya is the only solution.  As the 
Ishopanishad tells us, "do not covet for whose is wealth?"
