Sri Gurubhyon Namaha
 Vishwamitra had to burn up his body and then 
he was reborn again that was why he was given the brahma rishi seat. 

Sri Kamakshi
Raghav

Subject: Re: [Advaita-l] Becoming Hindu - varna

Dear friends,

It is true that past karna decides the birth in a particular varna but is there 
any guarantee that one born in a braahman family remains a braahman irrespective 
of whether one's action in this birth is befitting the braahman varna.One can 
be fallen braahman even if ione is born in the braahman family. By dint of his 
karma Vishwamitra became braahman though he was not a braahman by birth.

Regards,

Sunil K. Bhattacharjya

Dear Sunil and all,

Kanchi Acharya has explained Gita 4-13 that varna is by birth. See 
www.kamakoti.org and click Hindu Dharma and view relevant chapters.
Swami Ramsukhdasji in his translation of Gita has mentioned the same and also 
Shri Raj Pandit Sharma of HCUK has given translation of Adi Shankara's comment 
on Gita 4-13.

I have read on a Madhva site about (dvaita.org is not working) Gita commenting 
that varna refers to varna of soul (different than all other sampradayas) but 
that varna by birth should befollowed re: nitya-karmas, marriage, etc.

I am sure re: Vajrasooschika U. My understanding is that birth is initial 
definition but guna on top of it is important. I think this was discussed 
before on this list.

Jaldhar Vyas has provided shastric support of varna by birth before on this list 
and other lists. Perhaps he could comment on Vajrassochika U.

Ravi Chandrasekhara
