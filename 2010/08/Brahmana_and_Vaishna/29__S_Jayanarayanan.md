"Karuna Sindhu dasa received his brahmin initiation on the same day too."

"From a letter Prabhupada had his secretary send out to the GBC to convey his directions:...His Divine Grace therefore wishes to institute examinations to be given to all prospective candidates for sannyasa and brahmana initiation. In addition he wishes that all present sannyasis and brahmanas also pass the examination."

"The second initiation marks full admission into ISKCON, again functioning as a symbolic rebirth. The ceremony draws on the traditional Hindu rite by which members of the three highest castes become "twice-born." In keeping with Bhaktivedanta's own guru Bhaktisiddhanta's innovations, ISKCON offers this ceremony to any individual regardless of caste. This is important, since Hinduism has traditionally looked at non-Indians as casteless, and therefore unable to engage in the twice-born rite. During the ritual, new initiates become equivalent to Brahmins, the highest caste of Hinduism, receiving knowledge of the sacred gayatri mantra and a sacred thread marking them as twice-born."

So you're now saying that there does exist Brahmana initiation in ISKCON after all?!

Sorry, but I could not be less interested in ISKCON and their anything-goes-who-cares-about-the-Vedas Dharma. I have to stop here!
