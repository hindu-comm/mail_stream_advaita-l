If prarabda is immutable even by jnana, then it will be deemed more 
powerful
than jnana. The reason prarabda remains is so that there is a jnani
available to teach others.

praNAms
Hare Krishna

No, actually it has been debated here that due to prArabdha the different 
jnAni-s would have different set of antaHkaraNa-s and accordingly these 
different kinds of antaHkaraNa-s would have different kind of 'capacity' 
to withhold the 'same' Atma jnAna...So, with the result of this, jnAni-A, 
may not get affected by vagaries of the material life at all and he 
remains cool & calm always,  whereas  jnAni-B, due to his 'different' set 
of antaHkaraNa (due to his prArabdha) may get kAma & krOdha and these type 
of jnAni-s may require different time span to 'control' these kAmAdi 
vAsana-s...The 'B' type jnAni may get irritated & disturb himself even 
something goes against his comfort zone...like  there is no 'news paper' 
in time for him to read or there is no hot water for the morning bath  due 
to power cut or some other reason :-)) So, prArabdha is NOT ONLY  the 
cause for just continuation of the jnAni's body, but it may have different 
impact on different jnAni-s & it holds sway on his behaviour also...If 
this is the real state of affair for the jnAni-B, then we will have to say 
prArabdha is more powerful than Atmaikatva jnAna.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
