Did Sri Bannanje Govindacharya say mUla rAmAyaNa or vAlmIki rAmAyaNa or
mUla vAlmIki rAmAyaNa? The last seems impossible to me, given the fact that
Sri Govindacharya is a very staunch mAdhva scholar and could not have made
such a rudimentary mistake (by mAdhva standards) of equating mUla rAmAyaNa
with vAlmIki's kAvya. Please note also that the mUla rAmAyaNa of the mAdhva
school is not available to anyone. It is impossible either to verify or to dispute
what is said to be in that text. You have to take it on trust and whatever truth
value you attach to such statements is completely dependent upon the trust you
place upon those who make such statements, nothing else.
