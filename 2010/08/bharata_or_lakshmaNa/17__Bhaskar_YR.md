praNAms
Hare Krishna

My humble praNAms to all prabhuji-s who have taken time to clarify this 
issue.  Infact in that discourse, Sri Bannanje discusses the tithi, vAra, 
nakshatra, lagna etc. also and gives his 'own' explanation/justification 
to hold the point that bharata is younger to lakshmaNa...Anyway, thanks 
once again for all those clarifications with rAmAyaNa shloka-s.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
