Pranams,

Would anyone have any knowledge on this Charya Khanda please?

In all the literature we have researched, both printed and internet based,
it is stated that the Charya Khanda is lost.  However, we cannot find a
source for this claim.  No source we have read states anything other than
what somewhat else has said about it, which is, that it is purportedly lost
or destroyed.

Thank you.

Krishnadas
