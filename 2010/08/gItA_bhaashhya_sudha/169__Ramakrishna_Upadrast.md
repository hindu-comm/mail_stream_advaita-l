##Objection: Owing to the nonexistence of the world and the mundane
creatures, there will arise the defect of the uselessness of the
scriptures, etc.

Reply: No, snce this (defect) is admitted by all. A defect that is
admitted by all who believe in the Self is not be explained by one
alone!

Objection: How has this been admitted by all?

Reply: People of all schools of thought who believe in the Self admit
that there is no wordly behaviour or the behaviour of a worldling in
the liberated ones. Yet, in their case (i.e., in those various
schools), it is not admitted that there is any possibility of such a
defect as the scriptures becoming useless etc. Similarly, in our case
let the scriptures be useless when the knowers of the field become
identified with God; and purposeful within the sphere of ignorance.
This is just as in the case of all the dualists, where it is admitted
that the scriptures etc. become useful in the state of bondage, not in
the case of Liberation.

##Objection: Then, what is this that even learned say like the worldly
people, 'Thus amd I', 'This verily belongs to Me'?

Reply: Listen. This is the learnedness which consists in seeing the
field as the Self! On the contrary, they should realize the unchanging
Knower of the field, then they will not crave for enjoyment or action
with the idea, 'May this be mine.' Enjoyment and action are mere
perversions.
