##For every word used for expressing an object, when heard by
listeners, makes them understand its meaning through the comprehension
of its significance with the help of genus, action, quality and
relation; not in other way, because that is not a matter of
experience. To illustrate this: a cow, a horse, etc. (is comprehended)
through genus; cooking or reading, through action; white or black
through quality; a rich person or an owner of cows through relation.##

##What again is this that is called wordly existence? Worldly
existence consists in the experience of happiness and sorrow; and the
state of mundane existence of the soul consists in its being the
experiencer of happiness and sorrow.##
