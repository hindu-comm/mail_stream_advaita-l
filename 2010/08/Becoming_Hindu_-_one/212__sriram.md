Dear
Sorry .The earlier response to your mail got away before I could 
finish.Continuing that-without inviting comments that they are pseudo Hindus 
and that they are having ulterior motives to have joined Hinduism.Yes 
Hinduism is have its own defective system  if i may call so having casteism 
and discreminations and so on.But nothing  to beat its freedom in thinking 
and find the Truth for yourselves ably assisted by Upanishidic 
revelaltions.R.Krishnamoorthy.

Subject: [Advaita-l] Becoming Hindu - one possible solution?


This is such an arrogant discussion.

People talking patronizingly as if they are burdened with a sense of heavy
responsibility toward those unfortunate creatures who did not get born as 
Hindus
-quoting from this and that shastraa. Whom are we deluding here? The world 
is
not flocking at our doors to convert to Hinduism. There are just a handful 
of
romanticists who are probably unaware of the inequity imbuilt within 
Hinduism
who want to come to Hinduism. Give them an honest answer about Hinduism and 
its
caste system and half of them would not bother again to convert. Rest would 
be
of a sturdier material and would be well off either way whether you place 
them
in a high or low or left or right caste.

Namaskar
