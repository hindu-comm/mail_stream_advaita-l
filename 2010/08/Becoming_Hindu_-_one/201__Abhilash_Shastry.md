This is such an arrogant discussion. 

Peopletalking patronizingly as if they are burdened with a sense of heavy 
responsibility toward those unfortunate creatures who did not get born as Hindus 
-quoting from this and that shastraa. Whom are we deluding here? The world is 
not flockingat our doors to convert to Hinduism. There are just a handful of 
romanticists who are probably unaware of the inequity imbuilt within Hinduism 
who want to come to Hinduism. Give them an honest answer about Hinduism and its 
caste system and half of themwould not bother again to convert. Rest would be 
of a sturdier material and would be well off either way whether you place them 
in a high or low or left or right caste.

Namaskar
