Dear Raviji,

Namaste,

Lord Krishna said about division accoring to gunakarma. Vajrasoochika Upanishad tells usthat varna is not related to birth. How can you be so sanguine in your views?

Regards,

Sunil K. Bhattacharjya

Dear Sunil and all,

Caste, is loosely translated as jaathi.
Jaathi dharma is basically same as varna dharma.
This was also stated by Kanchi Shankaracharya, Chandrasekharendra Saraswati. IMHO, the 3 major sampradayas concur with this.
