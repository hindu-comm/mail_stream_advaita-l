Sri Gurubhyon Namaha
 DearMr Krishnamoorthy
 Your saying of Hindu Dharma has 
its own defects points out your lack of understanding of the basics of the 
dharma, please refrain saying that rather say that thats what your 
interpretation or your understanding of the dharma is. It is selfish people like 
me and you who have interpreted it as we want it. The varna system has its 
mertits and there is a reason why it was designed that way by god. Even purusha 
suktha has a reference to which part of the parama purusha is each varna from. 
and if you note we pray to the feet of lord and it is from there that the 
shudras have come. Each varna is great in it self only when one varna goes into 
the activities of others do conflicts arise. 

 
A brahmin is one who is a dwija who contemplates on the brahman, earning only 
what is needed for his and his dependants survival for that day, but how many of 
us who we call ourselves brahmins by birth have done our nitya karmas without 
any prayaschitta and lead our lives as per the shastras waking up at brahmi 
muhurta and doing nitya karmas, i doubt even 1% of the people do it now. Every 
one is doing everyones work a brahmin is in the army, in politics, in factories 
in business, same with other varnas, so you cant expect the mechanism to work 
well when you dont operate it according to the rules of the manual.

Sri Kamakshi
Raghav

Dear
Sorry .The earlier response to your mail got away before I could 
finish.Continuing that-without inviting comments that they are pseudo Hindus and 
that they are having ulterior motives to have joined Hinduism.Yes Hinduism is 
have its own defective system if i may call so having casteism and 
discreminations and so on.But nothing to beat its freedom in thinking and find 
the Truth for yourselves ably assisted by Upanishidic 
revelaltions.R.Krishnamoorthy.

This is such an arrogant discussion.

People talking patronizingly as if they are burdened with a sense of heavy
responsibility toward those unfortunate creatures who did not get born as Hindus
-quoting from this and that shastraa. Whom are we deluding here? The world is
not flocking at our doors to convert to Hinduism. There are just a handful of
romanticists who are probably unaware of the inequity imbuilt within Hinduism
who want to come to Hinduism. Give them an honest answer about Hinduism and its
caste system and half of them would not bother again to convert. Rest would be
of a sturdier material and would be well off either way whether you place them
in a high or low or left or right caste.

Namaskar
