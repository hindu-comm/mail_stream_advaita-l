Spotless freedom from desires means such a dissatisfaction in respect of 
all
objects fromBrahma down to inanimate things as is felt in respect of the
excrement of a crow.

praNAms Sri Praveen prabhuji 
Hare Krishna

yes, this type of vairAgya we can see in the sAdhana ihAmutrArtha phala 
bhOga virAga...And please note I am not saying vairAgya is not necessary 
for the jnAna, but what I am trying to say is vairAgya as an antaranga 
sAdha can/should be practiced by sAdhaka-s irrespective of their Ashrama. 
My request for Sri jaldhar prabhuji is that how can we cultivate this 
vairAgya even in saMsAra?? 

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
