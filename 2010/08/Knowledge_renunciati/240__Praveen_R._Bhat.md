Thanks for pointing out what you perceived are discrepancies in my response,
having taken them out of your own context in which I replied. Nonetheless, I
just intend to clarify those. I also wish to submit that I'm not
knowledgeable enough to answer your questions on Jada Bharatha. If you
recall my first response, I only wanted to comment on Ramana Maharshi. For
the other doubts you've raised, may be the thread will continue as earlier.

The very idea of my saying this tells you that Ramana Maharshi was *not* a
traditional saMnyAsi of a dashanAmi order. I hope there's no dispute there.
The word 'sense' here indicates that even in the traditional sense of the
word, he followed the ritual of throwing his yaj~nopavita, etc. Thats all.
Then we went on an offshoot of what if he did not do what he did, etc, which
is all hypothesis.

The term 'mental saMnyAsa' could be found in this very list if you dig the
archives. Some people do opine that saMnyAsa could be mental. I'm not one of
those and I don't know what it is or how it could be, so it was an advanced
response rather, if such a Q popped up on it. And so also it has been argued
on this very list about whether physical saMnyAsa guarantees vairAgya. So
the answer too was in advance. Apologies if added to confusion on what I was
saying.

Nothing that I said earlier changes due to this. Though Bhagavan didn't take
dashanAmi dIkshA, he did live his life similar to a dashanAmi saMnyAsi. So
his life speaks volumes of it. Thats all this means. I fail to see why you
would find it contradictory!

Let me repeat in toto, Sir: Maharshi left home, threw his yaj~nopavita,
tonsured his head, lived on bhikshA, wore minimal clothing. That, to me, is
living like a traditional saMnyAsi. However, he didn't take saMnyAsa dIkshA
in the dashanAmi order.

However, such a person may not even care for recognition.

Why so? Wouldn't you say that whats ideal is a rule, to which exceptions are
possible? In any case, I too look forward to Vidyasankar ji's response to
this. AFAIK, Ramana never claimed to be traditional, (again, in the true
sense of the word) nor did he recommend traditional study as such. For
example, there is an opinion that the only work he recommended, other than
maybe Yoga Vashistha, was Tripura Rahasya. I don't know of anyone in the
tradition that recommends *only* Tripura Rahasya.

I've already replied this above. I hope you don't see any contradiction
there. If you do, I'm not sure I have much of clarification to offer and I
offer advance apologies.

Traditionally, as I know, it is saMnyAsa with the ritually initiated dIkshA,
etc, not just sAdhana saMpatti. More knowledgeable persons may be able to
provide a better answer.

Nor am I. As I said, I just wanted to get into the Ramana Maharshi angle,
but perhaps I got carried away.

Perhaps so. When its said 'we', it has a wide scope, though its subjective.
The 'we' you have in mind and I have in mind could be different. Then again,
what the tradition says may not be either of the 'we's! :)

As said earlier, I responded only on seeing Ramana Maharshi's name
mentioned. However, I wonder if you see pUrva janma saMskAra playing any
role at all in realization of Maharshi & Jadabharata. If so, does that angle
help you at all?

Thanks for indulging me in it, though I have been of no help.

I do realize my limitations to answer the initial sequence of doubts you'd
raised, which was not my purpose anyway, and shift back to not blocking the
earlier flow of this thread. Thanks.
