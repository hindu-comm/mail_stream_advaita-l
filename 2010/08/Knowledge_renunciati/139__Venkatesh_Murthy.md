Where is Sastra reference telling they get Citta Suddhi in this way?

My answer is there is no Asrama for Sudras and Stris.  3.4.36 is
telling only about other Brahmins not in Asramas for some reason.
Vacaknavi is explained in this way. The name is in Br Upanishad .  In
some other Kalpa women had right to Upanayana and other Vedic karmas
not now. No Upanayana for Stri now.

This does not arise.

In all this he is saying other Brahmins only not Sudras and Stris.
They cannot be in same group.

How do you explain this ? What Vidya is Sudra not fit to get?

Moreover in 1 3.34 he says Sudro Yajne Anavakliptaha the Sudra is not
fit to do Yajnas. In same sentence he says Vidyayam Api
Anavakliptatvam Dyotayati. Sudra is not fit for Vidya also. Nyayasya
Sadharanatvat.  Because the same logic to not allow Sudra to do Yajna
and not allow him to get Vidya. He does not have sacred thread.
