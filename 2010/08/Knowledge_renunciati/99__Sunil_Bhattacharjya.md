Dear friends,

Vairagya can come to anybody, particularly to those, who are ardentdevotees of the Lord. So to seea non-dvija sanyashi may not besurprising. Butone may not be initiated into Sanyasha in a formal way, where Gayatri Japa for a prescribed number has to be performedbefore initiation and other ceremonies such as Atmashraddhaare to be performed for the initiation.

Sanyasha initiatiation is to be received from a Sanyashi only and this being so it appears that dvijas have to take sanyasha initiation from a dvija-sanyashi and a non-dvijahave totake initiation from a non-dvija sanyashi. 

Learned members of the group may opine if this logic is valid.

Regards,

Sunil K. Bhattacharjya

Dear Vidya and all,

This topic seems to come up on this list and others and is of importance to those seeking a Guru and knowledge. If sanyasa is restricted to Dvijas (at least among Smarthas/Advaitins), we see there are those that are of non-Dvija jaathis taking sanyasa, with ? deeksha from Shankaracharyas (directly or indirectly).

Chettiars in Tamil Nadu are merchants, but I have heard they are Shudra by varna. Also Swami Chinmayananda in his purva-ashrama was a Nair, a Shudra/non-Dvija jaathi in Kerala. (I have also read that Nairs were descendants of Naga Kshatriyas who transformed themselves to human non-Dvijas to escape Parashurama's wrath at dawn of Kali Yuga).

Without digressing into history/sociology, etc; can a Braahmana or other dvija have a Sanyasi as a guru from a non-Dvija background and even be formally initiated into sanyasa ashrama by that guru ? In addition, can a Sanyasi from non-Dvija background formally learn vedanta ? If so, would that violate the nishedha for veda-adhikara for non-Dvijas ?

Ravi Chandrasekhara
