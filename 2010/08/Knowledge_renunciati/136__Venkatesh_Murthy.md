Namaste Sri Vidyasankar

Thank you. I will go through it carefully before my reply.

But kindly explain what do you think about 3 4.26 just few sutras
after 3 4.20.  Adi Sankara has said Vedic Yajnas and other Asrama
karmas are necessary for Utpatti of Vidya even though not after Vidya
rises.  He does not say some other secular karmas. How Sudras and
Stris can perform these Vedic Karmas?

Moreover in 3 4.38 he says widowers and other Brahmins outside Asramas
can do japa worship and other acts to get same effect as Asramis. But
don't again say these can be Sudras and Stris.  He does not say these
outside Asrama persons can be Sudras and Stris.

These are referenced again in Jabala Sruti 'Atha Punareva Vratee Va
Avratee Va Snatako Va Asnatako Va Utsannagnir Anagniko Va' in 3 4.20
about Anadhikrutas. What do you say for this Sruti sentence?

Regards

-Venkatesh
