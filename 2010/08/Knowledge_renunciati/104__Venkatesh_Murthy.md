Our Dharma Sastras tell non dvija cannot be sanyasi not even vidvat
sanyasi. The non dvija vidvat sanyasi is a Vandhya Putra surely.

This is bad political pressure. I said this before. Not connected to
tradition but political games. How many non Brahmin Sanyasis became
Acharya of Sringeri Matha? Zero. Kanchi? Puri? Dwaraka? Badari? How
many?

The Mathas must play politics to survive. They do that. Don't
misunderstand politics as Dharma and Tradition. If Sringeri says no
Antyaja will be allowed in Sarada temple what will happen? It is not
wise thing. If you say Sarada temple tradition allows all it is wrong.

How much this tradition is forcibly done / with political motive / to
follow the Constitution written by enemy of Vaidika religion?

Important question. If a Matha follows secular state laws for
surviving can it be tradition? No in my opinion. The secular state is
an evil state because it says all castes are equal.

In Puranas we read Hiranyakasipu stopped Vedic practices. Will it be
tradition? What a person/organisation will do forcibly/for surviving
is NOT tradition. Tradition is in Dharma Sastras / other practice in
Parampara. Tradition against Dharma Sastra is not Tradition but some
other thing.
