Namaste Sri Vidyasankar

IMHO you are not correct in interpreting Adi Sankara's saying. He
never says Sudras and Stris having Vairagya can take Sanyasa  in 3
4.20 . This is your own saying. The question is If he wanted them to
be eligible to Sanyasa he had good chance in 3 4.20. But he never said
Sudras any where in 3 4.20. Why ?

Moreover in 1 3.34 he says Sudro Yajne Anavakliptaha the Sudra is not
fit to do Yajnas. In same sentence he says Vidyayam Api
Anavakliptatvam Dyotayati. Sudra is not fit for Vidya also. Nyayasya
Sadharanatvat.  Because the same logic to not allow Sudra to do Yajna
and not allow him to get Vidya. He does not have sacred thread. With
sacred thread only Brahmin gets right to do Yajnas. Or he can straight
away go from Brahmacharya to Sanyasa to get Vidya. in 3 4.20 Adi
Sankara is saying other Brahmins who have sacred thread but not
performing Yajnas can take Sanyasa. Your quick conclusion putting
Sudras and Stris in same group with other Brahmins is not correct.

Kindly explain your position.

I do not like pride. I am not proud. That is not my intention. I did
not create Varnas and Asramas. But Varnasrama is God's creation. He
says Chaturvarnyam Maya Srushtam. If  someone does not like it means
he does not like God's creation.
