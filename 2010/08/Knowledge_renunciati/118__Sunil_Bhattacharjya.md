Dear Venkateshji,

Namaste,

Satyakama was initiated into Vedic studies though he was low-born. It was at the discretion of the Vedic rishi who considered him fit to be initiated. You cannotquoteanyscripture permitting that.

Regards,

Sunil K. Bhattacharjya

The discussion on this aspect in fact went on like even Adya Acharyal has restricted sanyasa only for brahmanas. Latter on the discussions took a turn that Sureshvaracharya in his varthikas had interpreted the shastras to mean that sanyasa ashrama is available for dvija males. (was it an explicit and restrictive opinion by Sureshvaracharya?) In another thread, Shriman Jaldhar Vyas, although not elaborated had indicated that sthri shudradi vyaktis are entitled for sanyasa. And now Shriman Vidyasankar, by invoking shankara bhashya on Jabala Upanishad has deduced that sthri shudradi vyaktis are also entitled for sanyasa ashrama.

Namaste Sri Varadaraja Sharma

We cannot conclude sthri sudradi vyaktis can take sanyasa. It is not
correct interpretation by Sri Vidyasankara. Sruti,Smruti, and
Sistachara are considered but Sruti is most powerful. Smruti is more
powerful than Sistachara. If Sistachara is against Smruti it is wrong
to follow it. Smruti does not allow female / sudra sanyasi. If some
Matha made Sthri Sudradi sanyasis it is against Smruti so wrong. We
cannot follow it.

Adi Sankara knew this. He did not say allow sthri sudradi sanyasis in
his bhashyas. Jabala Sruti does not say allow them. Recent people are
playing politics / partiality to do this. We are fools to believe
them.

Regards

-Venkatesh
