Radhe Krishna



Shriman Vidyasankar, Radhe Krishna



DhanyavadaH. To be
frank, I was ignorant of the tradition and views upheld by the torch bearers of
the tradition. I had my understanding on
the basis of what I read ( I do not remember the sources) and what I heard from
knowledgeable and respectable people on the issue which was restrictive of
sanyasa to brahmanas. When I read the
interview I referred, it was very much indicative that my opinion was wrong but
further deliberations by you on the issue cleared many of my doubts.

I have some other doubts on the issue which I would address
in my next mail

DhanyavadaH once again.



Radhe Krishna
