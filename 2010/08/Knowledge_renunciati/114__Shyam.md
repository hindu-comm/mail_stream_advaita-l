Pranams.
First with reference to the term atyasrami - it means those who belong to the most revered of all the ashramas - the term "ati" in the atiasrami has the meaning of "adoration" - they alone have attained fullness in their detachment, and perfection in sadhana chatushtaya sampat. As such the term atiasramis refers to the Paramahamsa order of sannyasis alone. Refer to the Shankara bhashya on the concluding verses of the Svetasvatara Upanishad 6.21 (atyashramibhyaha paramam pavitram) for a more complete exposition of this term. I recall providing a complete excerpt of that portion of the commentary on this and the advaitin list some time back.

With regards to why sanyasa is central to brahmagnyana nishta, you may peruse the following essay for one perspective.
