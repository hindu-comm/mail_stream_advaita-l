Since you intended to send the earlier mail only to Jaldhar ji and erroneously
sent it to the list, it would be unfair of me to comment on it. Still
if you'd excuse
me, the spirit in which you wrote that mail is the very spirit in
which I believe that
mumukshutva is the sole culmination of sAdhana cAtuShTaya, which fructifies
in saMnyAsa.

Bhagavatpada says:

ब्रह्मादिस्थावरन्तेशु वैराग्यं विषयेष्वनु |
यथैव काकविष्टायां वैराग्यं तद्धि निर्मलम् ||

Spotless freedom from desires means such a dissatisfaction in respect of all
objects fromBrahma down to inanimate things as is felt in respect of the
excrement of a crow.

Of course, I'm just quoting, not anywhere close to living it. Apologies once
again for intruding, even so on the sidelines, into your personal mail.
