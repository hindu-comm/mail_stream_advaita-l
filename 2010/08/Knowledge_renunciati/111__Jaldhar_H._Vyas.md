I'm assuming in your example that B on receiving Brahmavidya leaves his 
home and family right?  Otherwise he is not any kind of sannyasi and the 
question is moot.

One Brahmana is wealthy.  When he takes sannyasa, he gives away his 
fortune of a million dollars.  Another Brahmana lives on bhiksha.  When he 
takes sannyasa, he gives away his fortune of ten dollars.  Is one more of 
a sannyasi than the other?
