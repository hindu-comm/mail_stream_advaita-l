I would request you to read carefully. I am saying that anybody who already has
citta Suddhi and the sAdhana saMpat for brahmajnAna does not need to do karmA
to get citta Suddhi. It is something that is already there. In my above sentence,
"anybody" could be a dvija man or a SUdra man or a strI of any class.

Let me ask you a counter-question. What SAstra specifies that a SUdra or strI will
be born as a dvija male in a future life and what steps do they have to take to 
ensure that?

You restrict your focus to brAhmaNa-s not in an ASrama for some reason and
then invoke kalpa to "explain away" the citing of vAcaknavI's name. Pray, give
me a reference from the sUtra bhAshya or the upanishad bhAshya where 
such a reason is given as an explanation for the case of gArgI vAcaknavI.

Why, because of the kalpa argument? Where in the sUtrabhAshya do you find 
anything to support your stance about kalpa?

If the reference to saMskAra-s from previous births in 3.4.38 applies only to ASrama
hIna brAhmaNa-s and not to anybody else, then please explain what the pUrva-kRta
saMskAra means for vidura and dharmavyAdha in 1.3.38. Note that you cannot cite
a previous kalpa argument in this case, because the accepted tradition is that the
mahAbhArata war marks the beginning of the current kali yuga, very much within
the current kalpa and the current manvantara.

I have already explained my stance with a lot of detail. I don't get what you mean
by the second question.

But the adhikAra for the vidyA obtainable through itihAsa-purANa is affirmed,
and explicitly so.

Simple. For you, anadhikRta means a brAhmaNa male who does not have adhikAra,
for one reason or the other. For me (and for a number of traditional authorities),
the word anadhikRta means any human being who does not have adhikAra.
