The Stri Sudradis can hear Itihasa Purana but their Jnana will be
Paroksha only. Like Jnana from books. They both are same.  There is no
Pramana telling you can get Aparoksha Jnana. Where?  But for Vedanta
there is Pramana the Mahavakya will give Aparoksha Jnana.

But not neglecting 3.4.26. This is very important Sutra. Karma is
necessary for Citta Suddhi. It will remove obstruction. Jnanotpatti is
from Karma. Adi Sankara has accepted this. Karma is necessary for
Jnanotpatti. Utpattau Karmani Apekshyante.  Vidura and Dharmavyadha
are exception cases.  but it proves they had Citta Suddhi by Karma in
past lives.
