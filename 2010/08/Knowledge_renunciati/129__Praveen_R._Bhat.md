If Bhagavatpada is saying that strI or shUdra can attain moksha without
saMnyAsa, I do not think it is implicit that for a brAhmaNa too, saMnyAsa is
not a must to attain moksha. Could you kindly clarify as to if
Shankaracharya has explicitly mentioned that elsewhere specifically for a
brAhmaNa/ dvija?
