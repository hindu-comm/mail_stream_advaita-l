Hari OM, Bhaskarji,

I'll try to clarify my queries in different words; apologies my mail wasn't
clear
enough.

Thanks, that last statement was what I was trying to bring forth in our
discussion.

Since you gave examples from Upanishads of those who attained brahmaj~nAna
and didn't take to 'formal' saMnyAsa, I wished to know if you could give
examples
of anyone who has taken to such formal saMnyAsa.

I think my statement is misinterpreted here. I meant to stress on the
well-known
fact that sAdhana cAtuShTaya is not moksha by itself, making one an adhikAri

of j~nAna, but not a brahmaj~nAni. I think you too agree that shabda brings
j~nAna.

I do not intend to get into the 'interval' issue at all and definitely not
to bring it
back again on the list since everyone involved on either side have expressed

their points to conclusion, call it resolved or unresolved. The
understanding I
bring here is that we do *not* know if the Upanishat adhikAri of j~nAna, on
acquiring j~nAna, took to saMnyAsa or not. To what purpose or if there is
any
purpose at all is a question I want to avoid.

Again, Bhaskarji, this argument is not conclusive one way or the other,
IMHO.
In as much as Yamaraja didn't ask Nachiketa to take saMnyAsa, he didn't ask
him not to take it either. For that matter, we understand that Nachiketa had

the sAdhana cAtuShTaya without the details of how he achieved it, etc. Those

are told by the parampara. Similarly, what to do after the rise of j~nAna or

what not to do is something that comes from parampara, wouldn't you agree?

The crux of the question I want to dig in is if avidyA nivRRitti is
possible, except
in *rarest* of cases, be it vAmadeva getting j~nAna in womb or someone were
to mention Ramana Maharshi in his childhood, without renunciation.

Exactly the point, dussAdhyaM makes it very rare and we should talk for the
masses of sAdhakas as I count myself to be in, not the rare ones or
uttamAdhikAri.

And this is all the more reason for my stressing the point of saMnyAsa.

Inasmuch as it wouldn't take away the possibility of brahmaj~nAna for
anyone,
be it in even a rarer case of someone without sAdhana cAtuShTaya! :) To me,
'instant' moksha without saMnyAsa is as much a possibility as instant
sAdhana
cAtuShTaya is without practice/ AbhyAsavairAgyA.


Before closing, may I also ask you at this point: why is it that you hold
the view
that saMnyAsa is not a must, be it as vividishA or vidvat, but do say that a

brahmaj~nAni cannot involve in nisshiddha karma? The reason I ask this is
because if as you said above there is no idamitthaM on whether or not one
should renounce on rise of brahmaj~nAna, that can only mean prArabdha.
And can't not then, prArabdha also get nisshiddha karma done? Correct me
if I misunderstood your views about this.
