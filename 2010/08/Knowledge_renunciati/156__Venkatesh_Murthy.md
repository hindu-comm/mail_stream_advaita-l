The remedy for this  is already given in the Upadesha Panchaka. Vedo
Nityamadhiyatam Taduditam Karma Svanushthiyatam.  Study the Vedas
regularly and do the Veda Karmas well avoid the Kamya Karmas. Do Homas
and other  vedic rituals as offering to God. The sins will get wiped
out. Then vairagya will be born.  Then take Sanyasa.   From studying
Vedanta in Sanyasa Jnana is the result. This is the royal way taught
by Adi Sankara.
