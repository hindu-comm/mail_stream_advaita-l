Ok the list is back up again, you may resume posting.

There are still a couple of problems with the archives though.  Part of 
June 2001 seems to have gotten mixed up with this month and Mailman (which 
has been causing me some very unvedantic thoughts today.) has renumbered 
all the posts which means that all links to archive pages will probably 
stop working :(  However the truncation problem seems to have gone.
