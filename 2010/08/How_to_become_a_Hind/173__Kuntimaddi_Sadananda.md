If some non-Hindu wants to become a Hindu -

1. What are the essentials of Hinduism that he needs to know?

2. What is a simple ceremony that we can suggest - that he should do,
in order for him to feel that he has converted to (or even converted
back to) Hinduism.

I understand Hinduism is not an ism and there is no conversion and all that.

The above question is still posed with that understanding - since I
feel there is a need for those who want to be officially call
themselves as Hindus - what need to be done at minimum.

3. If he is remote from a temple, what he minimum (ritual) he can do,
sincerely and with full commitment.

Most of the non-hindus conversion involves a commitment as well as
some ritual - for them to feel that commitment.

Any suggestions and recommendations from the knowledgeble people from the list.

Hari Om!
Sadananda
