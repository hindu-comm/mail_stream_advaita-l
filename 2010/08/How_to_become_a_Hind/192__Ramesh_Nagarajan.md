Dear Sunilji,

>>>Coming to pradakshina does Swamiji say why we do pradakshina for
different times for diffrerent deities?

Swamiji didn't talk about other pradakshina except the Atma Pradakshina. The
context is to realize that Self is present within ourselves and we bow to
the supreme divinity within us to remove our papas that we have performed in
this and previous births.

Yani kani cha paapaani janmanthara kruthaani cha
Thaani thaani vinas(h)yanthi pradakshina padae padae

Thanks,
Ramesh
