In an earlier discussion on this list regarding this one, a close look showed 
that the *translation* of whatever AchArya said was either wrong and 
misunderstood and vague and out of place. So it is not of much use.

IMHO the moment a non-Hindu approaches a teacher for spiritual guidance, the 
acceptance by the teacher itself can be looked upon as a formal ceremony.

Based on the teacher that he approached the initiation ceremony might vary.

As an example, in the case of a smArta teacher, if not immediately, in time he 
will be given initiation to follow smArta/Agama rituals with appropriate 
modifications.

Likewise a shrIvidyA teacher, shaiva, vaiShNava, kaumAra (very very few survive) 
teachers will pick appropriate rituals from their traditions either immediately 
or in time based on the student's maturity

One can put together some ritual by picking up various elements here and there 
just for mental satisfaction, but that will be just artificial.

My 2 cents.

SRA.
