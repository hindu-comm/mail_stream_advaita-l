The book Dialogues with the Guru explains that Sanatana Dharma exists
eternally. That everybody come under its jursidiction. The Jagadguru's idea
was that one should be steadfast in his religion. Christianity was founded
by Lord Jesus Christ and Islam by Prophet Mohammed. Before that which
religion they belonged? A Christian Gentleman was fascinated by Hinduism and
wanted to convert to Hinduism. He was told that he need not convert. He
could be in his religion and try to be a better Christian and try to find
Spititual Guides in his religion itself.

If people still wanted to convert Arya Samaj and RSS are doing it actively.
In US, Kauai's Hindu Monastery, which runs the magazine Hinduism Today, does
conversion.

Thanks and Regards,
Sriram
