Very good analysis Krishnadasji. Saying all religions are same is a very simplistic statement and no serious scholar will make such sweeping statements even though he may not criticise the religions other than his own. Even within Hinduism the Dvaitas and that the Advaitas have different perspectives.

They belonged to various paths many of which resembled our own kind.

Just mistranslated(or misunderstood) suggestions only belong to a trash can.
So for your own good get rid of this garbage. If you take this seriously we
would be axing off our own legs.

Whenever you take a statement from great people like HH do keep in mind that
particular suggestion was given for that person and it is not a generic
statement.

The reason for that particular suggestion could be many.. like for example..
HH might have discerned that the person was not sincerely interested and
only curious. Or maybe he came with actually a malicious**(like a few
indologists who take up Hinduism studies because they have an axe to grind)
intent.

** Like for example Sarah Caldwell who actually took initiation from a
shivAchArya not because she believed in saiddhAntika rituals ..but just to
get an inner look/perspective so that it can be shown as without substance
at a later time or to find out faults within the system and for
psycho-analyzing the people involved for academic purposes.

So HH probably looked through this Christian guy and advised him to stay
away. 
It is both naive and unwise to apply this to everyone.
