Recently there were a few posts on puraaNa pravachanams in Kannada; for those 
who speak Telugu, the discourses by BrahmaSriChaganti KoteswaraRao garu, 
available for free download at http://www.srichaganti.net/could beuseful. 
Theyinclude Ramayana (90 hours), Bhagavata(90 hours), Adi Parva of Mahabharata 
(25 hours), and shorter discourses on Bhaja Govindam, Lalita Sahasranaamam, Siva 
Puranam, Sri Kaalahasteesvara Satakam (a Sataka in Telugu on Lord Siva by a 
great poet, DhurjaTi, who was initially in the court of Sri Krishnadevaraya and 
then lost favour), Siva Puranam, Soundaryalahari, Tirumala VaiSishTyam, Shirdi 
Sai Baba, Kanakadhaarastotram and Daskhinamurthy vaibhavam. 


Some devotees have started a project to distribute the Ramayana pravacana of Br. 
Sri Chaganti to one lakh homes (about 40,000 DVDs have been distributed till 
date) and have published a DVD containing the 90 odd MP3 tracks of 
SrimadramaayaNa pravachanam. The website gives details of this program. Those in 
Hyderabad may contact yours truly (privately, at sivasenani at yahoo.com) to get 
this DVD.

Best regards
N. Siva Senani
