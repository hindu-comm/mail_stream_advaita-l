According to Advaita, the Lord's names and forms, though aprakrta, are
mayika. Isvara, being omniscient, should be aware of maya and its effects
though seeing nothing different from Himself. Does Nirguna Brahman know
Isvara and His creations? I am not asking in the sense of knowing as with
the mind. I am asking in the sense of being advaya jnanam itself.
