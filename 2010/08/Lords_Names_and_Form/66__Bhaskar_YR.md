Does Nirguna Brahman know
Isvara and His creations? I am not asking in the sense of knowing as with
the mind. I am asking in the sense of being advaya jnanam itself.

praNAms
Hare Krishna

Since nirguNa brahman is NOT an individual entity and there is no kinchit 
duality in IT, neha nAnAsti kiMchana, the above question does not arise at 
all...And again, Ishvara & his srushti etc. are mere vyavahArika drushti 
which is avidyAkruta..

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
