Pranams,
Dear sir,
Can you please help me find Ambal, called "Madhubyari" (could be
Madhubhairavi, or locally muthumari???, tayi???), seated on a Sphatika
(linga), on which Surya Kiranas fall during a particular month. Ambal
presides over an old temple in and around Chennai, in the general direction
of Puducherry. These descriptions came about during a prashna. I have been
asked to pay obeisance at her feet for getting rid of a very
painful,extraneous growth over my pre-sternum. I will be grateful if your
goodself or Vidyasankar Sundaresan sir and the other list members can help
me find Ambal. I beg yourpardon in case of any transgression,
thoughunwittingly,on my part.
Thank you,
Warm regards,
S. Venkatachalam,
Bangalore
