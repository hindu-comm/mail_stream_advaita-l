Bhaskar, you wrote "Since nirguNa brahman is NOT an individual entity and
there is no kinchit duality in IT, neha nAnAsti kiMchana, the above question
does not arise at
all...And again, Ishvara & his srushti etc. are mere vyavahArika drushti
which is avidyAkruta."

What is Jnapti? Does advaita say that nirguna brahman is pure knowledge?
