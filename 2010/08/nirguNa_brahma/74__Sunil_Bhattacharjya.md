Namaste,

Any scriptural reference?

Namaste,

Here is a somewhat different viewpoint:

We will use the tattva-s as enumerated by shaiva-shAkta darshana-s.

Agreed at the level of nirgUna brahma tri guNa-s are transcended.
But at least the five shakti-s that are beyond the three guNa-s can 
exist: cit, Ananda, iccha, jnAna, and kriyA. So:
- using jnAna shakti it would be possible to "know" the creation, 
- using kriyA shakti it would be possible to support "maintenance" of creation, 
and
- using iccha shakti it would be possible to give creation "new directions".

hari om,

Regards,
Shrinivas


---------------------------
Since nirguNa brahman is NOT an individual entity and there is no kinchit 
duality in IT, neha nAnAsti kiMchana, the above question does not arise at 
all...And again, Ishvara & his srushti etc. are mere vyavahArika drushti 
which is avidyAkruta..
Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
