Namaste Shri Bhattacharjya,

For example, consider the gaNapati atharva shIrSa upaniSad wherewe see 
statements like : tvam guNa trayAtIta... tvam shakti tryAtmaka ...
To me this seems to be a reference to a state where tri-guNa-s are transcended 
but the tri-shakti-s operate.

Regards,
Shrinivas

Namaste,

Any scriptural reference?

Namaste,

Here is a somewhat different viewpoint:

We will use the tattva-s as enumerated by shaiva-shAkta darshana-s.

Agreed at the level of nirgUna brahma tri guNa-s are transcended.
But at least the five shakti-s that are beyond the three guNa-s can 
exist: cit, Ananda, iccha, jnAna, and kriyA. So:
- using jnAna shakti it would be possible to "know" the creation, 
- using kriyA shakti it would be possible to support "maintenance" of creation, 
and
- using iccha shakti it would be possible to give creation "new directions".

hari om,

Regards,
Shrinivas
