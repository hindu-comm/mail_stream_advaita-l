Pranayama removes Paapa, so says Manu. Japa of Gayatri mantra for specified times removes Paapa of this day, this life and the past lives. There are such diffrent prescriptions.

Suresvaracharya is merely mentioning nitya karmA as a means towards
citta Suddhi. He is not saying that nitya karmA is the only means to remove
sins and he is not saying anything about prAyaScitta one way or the other.
His context in the naishkarmyasiddhi is quite broad (I presume you refer to
this text and not to one of the vArttikas).
