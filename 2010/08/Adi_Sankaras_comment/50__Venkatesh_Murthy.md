Some questions.

How can Citta Suddhi be there when there are sins? Is Citta Suddhi
different from removing bad karma? What is Citta Suddhi? What is bad
karma? What is sin?

Fast answer is this is all Maya but I like different answer.

This is not a good example because: Will Prayascitta help when there is curse?

Adi Sankara said Prayascitta removes bad karma. Why do you validate?

Sureshvaracharya says Nitya karmas help to wipe sins. Why are they
unnecessary? One person may do them with ritualistic mind set. He
knows they will give citta suddhi. They  give citta suddhi.  He should
not do rituals not knowing why.
