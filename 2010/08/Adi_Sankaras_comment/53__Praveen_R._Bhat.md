That wouldn't be exactly in other words! What I meant to say is that
titiksha is to endure those evil effects, while what you're saying is
sAdhaka is protected by the evil effects due to prayascitta karma. However,
most
of the evil effects themselves would be removed by prAyascitta karma leaving
very less for him to endure. What kind of endurance would that be? :) Agreed
that the sAdhaka would be additionally taking the effort of
performing the prAyascitta karma, but that would also bring the additional
adRShTa of dependence, wouldn't it?
