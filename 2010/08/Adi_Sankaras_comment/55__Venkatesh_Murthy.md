Sri Praveen Bhat is right.  Adi Sankara  said 'Nahi Prayascittadibhir
Hetubhir Vina Karmanam Ucchedaha Sambhavyate'. Prayascitta Karma will
definitely extinguish bad karma no doubt here. Nastyatra Samshayaha.

Prayascitta karma will take care of bad karma but titiksha is if you
do not do prayascitta. Adi Sankara means bad karma will be
extinguished by Prayascitta. If you do not do Prayascitta you will
experience the bad phala of the bad karma. If you do not do
Prayascitta there is one and only way to avoid bad phala.  That is to
get Brahma Jnana. It will extinguish bad karma. But if bad Phala is
Prarabdha even Brahma Jnana will not stop it. It is better to do
Prayascitta before bad Phala comes to you.  If no Prayascitta and no
Brahma Jnana get at least titiksha. You will have strength to face the
bad Phala of the bad karma.
