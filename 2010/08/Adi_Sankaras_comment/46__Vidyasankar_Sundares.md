Suresvaracharya is merely mentioning nitya karmA as a means towards
citta Suddhi. He is not saying that nitya karmA is the only means to remove
sins and he is not saying anything about prAyaScitta one way or the other.
His context in the naishkarmyasiddhi is quite broad (I presume you refer to
this text and not to one of the vArttikas).

ps. I have been intending to respond to your post on saMnyAsa and varNa-
ASrama rules from a few days ago. I'll try to respond before the week ends.
