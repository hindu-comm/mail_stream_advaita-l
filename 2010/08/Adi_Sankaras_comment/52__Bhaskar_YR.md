Another point I want to make is that a sAdhaka may want to develop 
titikshA
which requires him to undergo the effects of his past karma and endure 
them
(possibly without prAyascitta).

praNAms 
Hare Krishna

In other words, the shAstra vihita prAyaschitta karma, vidhi & its 
AcharaNa would give the fortitude to withstand the 'evil effects' of past 
karma and protects him to lead the life of a sAdhaka.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
