Thank you very much for the reference.  The three words: avidyA, samshaya
and ajnAnam are used in one sentence there.

This in fact is the other way of presenting the Acharya's own Taittiiriya
bhashya  definition of 'satyam and anRtam' that we have just seen in this
very thread.  So, according to Advaita satyam is not only ever-lasting but
also never-changing.  PrakRti might qualify in the first requirement but not
in the second and is therefore anRtam.

I believe Citsukha in tattva-pradipika has also commented on this and maybe
