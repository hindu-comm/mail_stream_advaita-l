Namaste.

Here are two more sets of 'three' pertaining to Satyam, Truth, Brahman:

1.  Brahman is taught to be free of

A. Desha pariccheda - space-wise constriction.
B. KAla pariccheda   -  time-wise constriction
C. Vastu-pariccheda  - object-wise constriction.

(trividhapariccheda shUnyam)

2. Brahman is free of three types of 'bheda' -

A. sajAtIya bheda -  There is no other object that is similar to Brahman
just as a coconut palm is there as other than another coconut palm.
B. vijAtIya bheda  -   There is no other object that is different from
Brahman just as a cocunut palm is different from any other object like a
stone.
C. svagata-bheda -  There are no divisions within Brahman unlike a tree,
although one, contains several parts like the trunk, branches, twigs,
leaves, etc.
