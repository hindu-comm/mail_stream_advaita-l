##Although the means be unreal (in itself), still it may be meaningful
in relation to the truth of the purpose it serves, as are the
eulogistic sentences (arthavaada) occuring along with injunctions.
Even in the world, when it becomes necessary to make a child or a
lunatic drink milk etc. it is said that it will help growth of hair
etc! Before the dawn of Knowledge, the (ritualistic) Vedic texts
concerned with a different situation (The situation obtaining before
the dawn of Self-knowledge) are also as valid in themselves as are
direct perception etc. occuring due to Self-identification with the
body etc.##

(Concluded.)

Thanks to Mahamahopadhyaya Shri Pullela SriRamachandrudu Garu for the
excellent translation, along with the selections, and special thanks
to Shri Subbu-ji for the encouragement.
