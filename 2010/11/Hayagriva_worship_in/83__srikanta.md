When I was reading a book from the Sera Monastery,I was surprised to find
the "Hayagriva" worship by His Holiness Dalai Lama.When and how did the
Hayagriva worship enter into Buddhism?In Hindu Panthean,"Hayagriva" is
given an important place as the Devatha of Vidya.We see the
sentence,"Hayagriva uvaca "at the start of the Lalithasahasranama.We have
the famous saying in English,"straight from the horse's mouth!
