Namaste Shri V Subrahmanian,

Thank you for a detailed and clarifying post on advaitin view point.

Dear Shrinivas ji,
Let me say a few words on the observations you have made:

The question of Jnana-karma samucchaya that Sri Sastri ji has addressed is
something that is concerned with one's attaining to the liberating jnana.
The position of the Shastram is that the final liberating Jnana gives
liberation independently, without having to take the support of karma. And
'karma' in all this discussion means 'shAstra vihita karma' for that sadhaka
that is appropriate for his varna-ashrama.

....

However, the Jnani, if he is in a position where he can influence others,
will engage in those actions that will help protect dharma and prevent
adharma. 

....

Sri Krishna Himself teaches in the Bhagavadgita third chapter that the
Jnani, while remaining amidst ajnanis, *should fully engage in all types of
karma* and be a role-model to them. Sri Vidyaranya too in the Panchadashi
has said this. When a Jnani engages in karma, even nitya karma, it comes
under the category of dharma-rakshanam.

....

The term 'samucchaya' is a technical one and Shri Sastri ji has clearly
brought out its implications. The Jnani's engaging in karma aimed at dharma
rakshanam is clearly out of the purview of 'samucchaya'.
