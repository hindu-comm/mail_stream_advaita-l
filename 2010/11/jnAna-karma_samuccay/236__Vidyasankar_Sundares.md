>Dear Vidyasankarji,

>Any karma  of a  Jnani may appear to be work to the world but that is not karma at all. 

In which case, there is no true jnAna-karma samuccaya for the jnAnI, is
there?! As for the ajnAnI, karmA is possible, but again there is no jnAna-
karma samuccaya.

jnAna and karmA are incompatible with each other in the same sense
that the apparent actions undertaken by a jnAnI are not karmA at all.
