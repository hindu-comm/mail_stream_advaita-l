Dear Vidyasankarji,

A Jnani has to be SthiraJnani or SthiraPrajna and as the Lord told the Characteristics of the Sthiraprajn, one will have to be steady in keeping away from the objects of the senses ((not physically alone, it will have to be mentally as well ) and he will have to be steady in Dharana, Dhyana and go to Samadhi ( if not be in Dhyana and Samadh all the time). This indicates the possibility of a fall of the jnanai if he is not able to be steady like a true Sthiraprajan does. That person can neither be called pure Karmayogi nor pure Jnanayogi. He would be able to go either way depending on his propensity either way. In such cases the JnanaKarma Samuccaya seems to have some meaning. Or take the case of a Karmayogi, who having read the Bhagavad Gita, takes to the practice of self-sacrifice and does humanitarian work without any ppersonal agenda. Would you think his renunciation (albeit developing gradually) will be in vain?

Regards,

Sunil K. Bhattacharjya

I agree. Rigorously speaking, there is no Jnana-Karma samuccaya for both Jnani and Ajnani.

In which case, there is no true jnAna-karma samuccaya for the jnAnI, is
there?! As for the ajnAnI, karmA is possible, but again there is no jnAna-
karma samuccaya.

jnAna and karmA are incompatible with each other in the same sense
that the apparent actions undertaken by a jnAnI are not karmA at all.
