But the Swamijis participation in Pujas, Homa activities means these
Karma are good for society. No Swamiji said stop doing Puja because
you are Brahman Tatvamasi. No Swamiji said stop doing Homa because you
are Brahman.  No Swamiji said if you want Moksha Purushartha stop
doing Karma . It is correct the activities are needed for Advaita
Sadhana. But they must be done with Isvara Arpana Bhava.

The technical argument against Jnana Karma Samuccaya is only
theoretical but not practical. Practically there is a Samuccaya of
Nishkama Karma and Jnana Sadhana. Adi Sankara said Karma cannot be
combined with Jnana. But this Karma is not Nishkama Karma but done
with Aham Karta Aham Bhokta Bhava. In Nishkama Karma as Isvara Arpana
only there is no Aham Karta Aham Bhokta Bhava.  The doer does not feel
he is doing Karma. Samuccaya of Nishkama Karma and Jnana is not only
possible but very beneficial very much needed.

Request you to kindly consider this position.
