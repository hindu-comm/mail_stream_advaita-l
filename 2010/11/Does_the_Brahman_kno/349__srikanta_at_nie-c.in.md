What is jnanam in this?
__________________________________________________________________________IIn
the statement,:Satyam,Jnanam,Anantam Brahma.The word "Jnanam"signifies
roughly putting,"Knowingness".It is not kriya,but its very nature.The
"Jnanam"doesnot need another entity to illumine it.It is its very nature
of "Knowledge".By this everything else is illumined,just as the Sun being
itself light illuminates the world as well.In the same manner,"The
Brhman"as the illuminating principle itself being light illuminates others
as well.The Brahman can know itself by itself,just as the little "I"the
ego knows itself.The sruthi also says,"Atmanam Atmanam viditwa".
