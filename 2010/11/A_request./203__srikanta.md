Dear vidyashankarji,
I saw in your Email that all the list members should try to send only few
Emails.Agreed.I also would entreat you to send an attention notice that no
list member should indulge in personal attacks such as,you are
confused,you are ignorant,you don't know.etc.but,instead confine
themselves to serious discussions of the topic if they mean meaningful
discussions in this list.
Regards,                                             N.Srikanta.
