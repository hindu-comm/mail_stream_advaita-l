Dear Sri Srikanta,

Your suggestion is already covered under point no. 8 of the list policies as detailed in
http://lists.advaita-vedanta.org/lists/. That is why I merely posted the link and didn't
specifically mention it. This is part of the sAmAnya dharma of the list and is expected
to be followed by everyone. The request to limit the number of posts sent to the list is
not explicitly covered in the list policies, therefore I wrote about that separately. 

I can well understand that one often gets carried away by the heat of a discussion, but
we should all strive to shed more light than generate heat! Civility and focusing on the
issues being discussed rather than personalities goes a long way towards that ideal.

Regards,
Vidyasankar
