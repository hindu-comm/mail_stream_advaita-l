The book I mentioned has taken into account a book titled 'Akshobhya Teertha
Charitre' by Sri Raghuvira Tirtha Swamin. I do not know if the book referred
by you above is the same. The author Sri G.R.Patil says that the above book
could have been published between 1956 and 1959 ( the copy this author got
does not have the cover pages).  He has devoted over 20 pages on the above
book.

The above is also considered in the book by Sri Patil.

These 'evidences' have been analyzed in very great detail in this book.
Since I heard that the author himself is bringing out an English translation
of the book, I do not wish to spend time in giving large details of the
Kannada book myself; also I have some other things on hand to write about.
It is best to buy a copy and read.

In Advaita, anything that has guNas, attributes, has to be something
created.  That which is not created, Brahman/Atman, cannot have guNas. So
with form.  That Brahman can assume various forms thru the agency of Maya
for specific purposes is acceptable to and not disputed by Advaitins.  Any
'strong' pramana is bound to be disputed by others on grounds they think are
strong(er). So, there will be no end to this debate.  It is better to
refrain from arguing these matters with schools that oppose Advaita.

Here, as a sample, is given passages from the Madhva school for two words
from the Bhagavad gita:

'बाह्यस्पर्शेष्व*सक्तात्मा*' इत्यस्यार्थः काम*रहित* इति। 5.21
For the word 'asaktAtmA' Sri Jayatirtha comments: kAma-rahitaH (one who is
devoid of desire/infatuation/longing, etc.)

For the words 'nirahankAraH, nirmamaH' of the Gita, Sri Madhva comments:
भक्षयामीत्यहङ्कारममकारवर्जितश्च   2.71

'ahankAra-mamakAra-varjitaH' (who is devoid of ahankara (egoism) and
mamakara (ownership or feeling of 'this is mine')

परमात्मलाभेन निराशीराशा*रहित *इत्युक्तं भवति।  3.30
For the word 'nirAshIH' of the Gita, Sri Jayatirtha comments: AshArahitaH
(devoid of desire/longing, etc)

So, you can see there is not any difference between the prefix 'a' and 'niH'
according to Sri Jayatirtha, in the examples shown above.

Even today, Dvaita Mutts and other institutions invite Advaita scholars who
have specialized in Advaita siddhi and hold discussions regularly once or
twice a year.  These scholars are honoured, with titles even. That shows
that they have the feeling that Advaita Siddhi holds a lot of things that
are not clear for them to this day. This, despite stalwarts in their school
having written a lot against Advaita (Siddhi) over the centuries.

If you have the necessary depth of knowledge of Advaita and the time and
inclination, you can refute what he has written.  But the best thing to do
would be to ignore it.  One can see how poor is that blogger's understanding
of Advaita.
