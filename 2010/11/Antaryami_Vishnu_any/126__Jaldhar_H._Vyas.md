See brhadaranyakopanishad 3.8.8 for instance:

"He[1] said it is this Imperishable[2] oh Gargi the knowers of Brahman is 
that[3].  It is not large not small not short not long[4] not red-brown 
colored[5], not oily, not shadowy, not dark, not air, not akasha[6], not 
attached, without taste, without odor, without eyes, without ears, without 
speech, without mind[7], not lustrous[8], without breath, without voice, 
without measure, without interior, without exterior.  It does not eat 
anything and it is not eaten by anything."

[1] Maharshi Yajnavalkya speaking to Gargi Vachaknavi.

[2] Brahman which is akshara or imperishable or unchangable.

[3] Gargi had asked what is that pervades heaven and earth, above heaven 
and below earth.

[4] This four-fold negation of dimension shows that brahmana is not a 
dravya (substance.)

[5] Lohita.  Shankaracharya notes that this is a guna (quality) of fire. 
This shows that Brahman is not a quality.  dravya and guna are the two 
major concepts in vaisheshika darshan and classical Indian science.

[6] Previously Yajnavalkya had told Gargi that the akasha (ether) pervades 
the heaven and earth.  Brahman pervades even the ether.

[7] from without taste... to here are attributes of the senses so Brahman 
is shown to be beyond the comprehension of the senses.

[8] tejas can also mean power or heat.

To be grammatically correct, nis + guna

If it is beyond comprehension then how do they know the gunas do stay? 
Isn't incomprehensibility exactly the argument the author of the blog you 
quote makes against Advaita Vedanta?

Not really but they seem to be making the argument that there is a 
difference between not knowing the gunas and emphatically stating there 
are no gunas.

> If so what is it?? and does nirguna actually means without attributes.

Yes.  See shruti above.

we should read it ourselves and draw our own conclusions.

The author of that blog seems to have a problem with the idea that unreal 
causes can have real effects.  And he does not understand that jnana in 
Advaita Vedanta is not just a greater quantity of knowledge but a shift in 
scale of what constitutes knowledge.  Understanding these concepts 
resolves what seems like paradox at first glance.
