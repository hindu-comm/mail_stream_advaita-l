While I'm sure you meant this humorously, I found your "joke" to be in 
very bad taste.  Quite a few readers of this list are not Advaitins but 
they read out of a genuine desire to learn what Advaita Vedanta teaches. 
This kind of thing does nothing to show them the splendor of our 
sampradaya and in fact puts it in a bad light even amongst those who 
might be sympathetic to it.  Is that what you want?
