With reference to the above topic,I would like to corect a couplet said to
have beensaid by Vedanta Deshika:

"Kecit karmavalambhakah,kecit jnanavalambhakah!
Vayam tu Haridasat Padarakshavalambhakah!!.So saying, Vedanta Deshika
entered his house.
Some are followers of Karma,whereas some others are followers of Jnan.But
we are the followers(Padarakshavalambhakah) of Hari.

To come to that one must have great humility.
Vidya dadhati vinayam,vinayam dadhati patratham!
PatrenaDhanam,Dhanathdharmam,tatha sukham!!

                                                    N.Srikanta.
