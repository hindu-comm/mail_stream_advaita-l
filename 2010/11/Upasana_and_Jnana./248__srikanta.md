Namaste,

For an ordinary sAdhaka like me the upAsanA marga in which jnAna, karma,
and yoga are beautifully integrated with the thread of bhakti is by far
the best
path to adopt. If someone were to argue : .... but in the final analysis
there
is only jnAna etc etc ... , to them I would say: Okay. In that case since
jnAna
is an integral component of upAsanA marga, I will begin to see the truth of
claims like these when I am ready.

upAsanA marga / bhakti is a well rounded path capable of granting any and
every
puruSartha.

Srinivasji,

You may have upasana or Bhakthi for your endeavour for the
Purushartha.But,what I am saying is one will reach the saguna Brahmopasana
as Shankara has said.You cannot reach Nirguna Brahman.Jnana is not an
integral component of Upasana marga.One will reach only as the devotee and
not even as "sarupya"to the devata he is doing Upasana.Shankara has made
this clear in this bhashyas.
Gaudapada in the Adwaita prakarana (IV prakarana)of Mandukya upanishad
karikas says:

"Upasanaashritasya dharmasya jate brahmani vartate!
Prag utpatter ajan sarvam tenasau krpanah smrtah!!"

The being(Atma) which is dependent upon "Upasana",remains with the
"Hiranya garbha"Brahman"It thinks before birth every thing is
birthless,therefore it is considered as miserly(krpanah).

Infact that is what all the "Bhajana Goshti"is doing these days.it
considers that with Bhajana everything is solved,without the effort of the
seeker.The sadhaka has to strive for getting "Brahmajnana".Well,if he
wants to be contented with only Bhakthi,then it is his lot.
                                                         N.Srikanta.
