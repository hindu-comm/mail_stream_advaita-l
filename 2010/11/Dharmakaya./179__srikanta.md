Sri sunil Bhattacharya,
I have explained that 'Dharmakaya"is the transcendental dimension of
Budhahood.The shunyata or emptiness is the Perfection od wisdom according
to the lankavatara sutra.The mind of which the sutra speaks both
transcends and annihilates the conceptions of the dualities of existence
and nonexistence,identity and difference ,permanence  and impermanence.It
transcends he concepts of self,substance,and karma.It even transcends the
concept of causation.According to the sutra,all these concepts are the
products of false imagination,or discriminating thought(vikalpa).

But,Vedanta says that Self or the Atman is by its verynature pure and
taintless.it is Asanga."Asango hi ayam Purushah"says the Upanishad.it is
Vibhu or sarvagatah.There is a difference between what Buddhism and
Vedanta say.By the realisation of the 'Brahman",one escapes the cycle of
birth and death,because it is not limited as an ego.
Sincerely,                                            N.Srikanta.
