Sri Srikanta,

If you think that you understand Mahayana Buddhism completely from the late Buddhist text, the Lankavara sutra of the Yogacaras alone and need not refer to the earlier Mahayana texts texts it is upto you. If one refers to Hiuen Tsang's account one will see that Vasubandhu was living after a millennium (not million years) after Lord Buddha's departure.

What I have to say on Buddhism is already in the earlier mails and I do not have to repeat. 

Sincerely,

Sunil K. Bhattacharjya

Sri sunil Bhattacharya,
I have explained that 'Dharmakaya"is the transcendental dimension of
Budhahood.The shunyata or emptiness is the Perfection od wisdom according
to the lankavatara sutra.The mind of which the sutra speaks both
transcends and annihilates the conceptions of the dualities of existence
and nonexistence,identity and difference ,permanence and impermanence.It
transcends he concepts of self,substance,and karma.It even transcends the
concept of causation.According to the sutra,all these concepts are the
products of false imagination,or discriminating thought(vikalpa).

But,Vedanta says that Self or the Atman is by its verynature pure and
taintless.it is Asanga."Asango hi ayam Purushah"says the Upanishad.it is
Vibhu or sarvagatah.There is a difference between what Buddhism and
Vedanta say.By the realisation of the 'Brahman",one escapes the cycle of
birth and death,because it is not limited as an ego.
Sincerely,                      N.Srikanta.
