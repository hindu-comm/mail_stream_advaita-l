Namaste.

Vedanta does not present Brahman as a bhogya vastu, an object that is to be
experienced/enjoyed. Any bhogya vastu is inert.  When a man is said to have
people as bhogya is not experiencing the chaitanya but only the body, mind,
etc. which all are prakRti and inert.  On the other hand Vedanta teaches
that the aspirant is none other than Brahman.  Brahman is taught as
'vijnAnam Anandam Brahma'.  Brahman IS Bliss.  The Upanishads do not say
'Brahman experiences Bliss'.  Such a propostion would make Brahman a
something/someone different from Bliss and the Bliss itself an inert
object.  The Upanishad also teaches 'He who realizes Brahman is Brahman',
'You are That', 'I am Brahman', etc.  Such a realization does not
*require*the Knower to 'experience' the Bliss
*of *Brahman, for, as stated earlier, Brahman IS Bliss; Brahman is not the
'experiencer' of Bliss.  Since the one who realizes Brahman IS Brahman, the
question of 'experiencing' (as a transitive verb)  Brahman/Bliss is simply
not there at all in the Vedantic moksha. The analogies of sugar-taster of
sugar, Idli-chutney and the eater thereof, etc. do not have any relevance in
the *final stages *of Vedanta sadhana, realization and moksha.  All the
vibhutis of Brahman that a devotee might find enjoyable/blissful are also
inert alone.  Even 'persons/gods' named as vibhutis of Brahman are
essentially Chaitanyam, none other than that Brahman but their name/form
belong to prakRti.  The teaching of Vibhuti-s and  their adoration is a
stepping stone for the final culmination of transcending even this stage and
realizing the identity with Brahman, free of all manifestations
(vibhuti-s).  This is because, the experiencer/adorer of these vibhuti-s is
a someone with the instruments/apparatus with which alone this adoration is
possible.  This apparatus is taught to be prakRti, not the essential
chaitanyam which alone is this adorer in truth.
