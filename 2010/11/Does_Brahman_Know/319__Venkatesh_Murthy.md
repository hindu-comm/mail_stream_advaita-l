Ishwara exists in Vyavahara only. In Paramartha there is no Ishwara.
When there is no Ishwara there is no Bhakta also. Both are One. You
land in confusion because of misunderstanding Advaita. Your reasoning
is in reverse gear.

All experiences of Ishwara and Bhakta and all others are Maya only and
not true from Nirguna Brahman point. What Ishwara knows and
experiences is Maya only. All infinite attributes are Maya only. They
are not true. Ishwara knows this. He knows there is no Ishwara at
Nirguna Brahman level. Bhakta Jiva does not know this.  He thinks
Ishwara is great and all experiences are true. But they are Maya only.

In idli example what you say is not correct. The correct example is
like this. A man likes idli and chutney. He does not want to become
idli and chutney true. But when he tastes greater pleasure in Jalebi
than idli and chutney he will leave idli and chutney and go for it .
The Brahman Bliss is like that. It is greater than Bhakti Bliss also.
Ishwara knows this also. But for people who cannot understand Jnana
Marga he will teach Bhakti. If you teach Jnana Marga to undeserving
people it will be like nuclear secrets to bad people. Bhakti may
convert bad people into good people.
