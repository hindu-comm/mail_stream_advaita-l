Ishwara* *knows nirguna brahman and its exstence as Himself, jIvA and jagat.
He is also infinitely blissful. His devotees experience this bliss (as
visuddha sattva does not obstruct). There are infinite attributes and
experiences through karma, yoga and bhakti. Each one of these and the
experience of jnana is also known to Ishwara (Lord Krishna says that there
is nothing hire than jnana. So he must know that experience also). When a
jIvA realizes Ishwara, he can get any or all of these experiences because
Ishwara favours His devotees with sarsti etc. A jIvA who is attracted to
Ishwara with the intention of becoming absolutely one with Him might
consider that goal is achieved at some stage. But in reality, does he reach
the same state as Vishnu of omniscience and omnipotence? Or does he get
tricked in to a state by Vishnu that he thinks there is no Vishnu, jagat
etc.? One who likes idli will eat it with chutney but not want to become
flour.
