 *Sri Subrahmanian, you said that all the attributes of Ishwara are possible
in relation to this world only. Even when nothing exists (not even time),
Ishwara exists. Therefore, trans-temporal existence (pure existence) is an
essential attribute of Ishwara and trans-relational because there is nothing
else to relate to. *
**
The Uddhavagita provides the basis for the Advaitic declaration: Brahma
satyam jagat mithyA, jIvo brahmaiva na paraH.
**
* Why is jagat not Brahman? The difference between Ishwara, Jiva and Brahman
is only the nature of Upadhi. On removal of upadhi, all this is Brahman
only. From an ultimate point of you, you said that jagat is unreal (asatya)
but then why say jagat is mithya (sad asad lakshana) in a statement that
says the ultimate reality of jIva?*
**
*You concluded that jIva is untimately witness. For a kshetrajna to exist,
there has to be a kshetra.  As kshetra does not exist, there can be no
kshetrajna also. Is it not like saying son of a barren woman? *
