This reminds me of Sri Ramakrishna's parable also, that the fly wants to
 taste the honey, but does not want to fall into the honey and drown, 
that is, the bhakta wants to remain separate so as to experience the 
bliss of the Supreme.

> Ishwara* *knows nirguna brahman and its exstence as Himself, jIvA and jagat.
> He is also infinitely blissful. His devotees experience this bliss (as

> experience of jnana is also known to Ishwara (Lord Krishna says that there

> jIvA realizes Ishwara, he can get any or all of these experiences because
> Ishwara favours His devotees with sarsti etc. A jIvA who is attracted to
> Ishwara with the intention of becoming absolutely one with Him might
> consider that goal is achieved at some stage. But in reality, does he reach

> tricked in to a state by Vishnu that he thinks there is no Vishnu, jagat

> flour.
