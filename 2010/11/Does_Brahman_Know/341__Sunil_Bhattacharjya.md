May I make a suggestions, Can we look at it this way. The Flour came originally from the elements and the Idli also will return finally to the elements, through the several intermediate steps.

Your svarUpa is your svarUpa. It is not determined by anything
else. All that SAstra does is to reveal it to you. It cannot
change it. No amount of SAstra or erroneous interpretation of
SAstra can assert something and thereby change the true nature
of any thing.

For flour to become idli or dosa or something else, some external
action is required on it - addition of water, the cooking process,
the cook, etc. When flour is all that truly is, whence the idli?
Similarly, yatra tv asya sarvam AtmaivAbhUt ... ... I suggest that
you need a very basic grounding in the SAstras before jumping into
more complex questions of interpretation.
