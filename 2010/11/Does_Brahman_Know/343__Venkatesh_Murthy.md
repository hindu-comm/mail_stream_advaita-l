Jeeva and Ishwara are babies of same mother Maya. If Maya is not there
they cannot be there also.  In Turiya Avastha only Nirguna Brahman is
without Maya and without Jagat because Maya is cause of Jagat. If
cause is not there effect is not there.  Ishwara and Jeeva have
meaning if Jagat is there. But there is no Jagat. There is no Ishwara
no Jeeva.  You can say also they are both Brahman. Brahman is Ishwara
is Jeeva. This is in Turiya.

That is why Brahma Satyam Jagan Mithya Jeevo Brahmaiva Naparaha.
