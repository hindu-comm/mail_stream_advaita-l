Agreed that the Chaitanyam end-state goal of a mumukshu and is the 'advaitic' state where the 'observer-observation-observed' all collapse together in to a non-dual state that is 'Brahman'. This is where the Subject fuses with the predicate and object as one Blissful state.
The examples of the bee-honey, human-iddli&chutney are all stages that one has to cross over to reach this ultimate state. As Bhagavan Sri Ramana Maharishi has stated in his 'Naan Yaar (Who Am I?)' , all the material used to understand the 'SELF' have to be  given up , or rather go away, at the ultimate 'Self Realization' and he uses the example of the 'pinamchudu thadi' (the stick that is used to make sure that the body is fully cremated to ashes by the person at the graveyard who manages the cremation, finally throws the stick also in to the fire to become ashes!).

For every mumukshu, the paths to Realization vary (as the scriptures portray) and some unique paths are also possible. Even Iddli-Chutney-Flour example could trigger a mumukshu to understand the unitary State. It is all driven by the Ultimate GRACE that makes itself understood and reached. Bhagavan Sri Ramana Maharishi realized HIS SELF from his own strange experience of 'simulated death' and subsequent enquiry within HIMSELF that resolved the mystery to reach HIMSELF.
