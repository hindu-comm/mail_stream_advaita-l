The negation of all attributes from Brahman is spoken of only when the world
is held to be unreal/non-existent and not when the manifest world has gone
into the unmanifest state called pralaya.  The concept of Ishwara in Advaita
is relevant only when the concept of the world is admitted. In the absence
of the world, there is no Ishwara but only Brahman.  The mAnDUkya kArikA:

न निरोधो न चोत्पत्तिः न बद्धो  न च  साधकः ।
न मुमुक्षुः न वै मुक्त इत्येषा परमार्थता ॥   2.32
32 There is neither dissolution nor creation, none in bondage and none
practicing disciplines. There is none seeking Liberation and none liberated.
This is the absolute truth.

depicts the situation we are talking about.

'Unreal' is what 'mithyA' is.  'asatya' also means the same.

True, 'kshetrajna'-status is relative only to 'kshetra'.  The 'witness' in
that Uddhavagita verse is spoken of only in relation to the three states of
waking, etc.  When the world, in other words, the three states, is held to
be not there in absolute terms, there is no scope for the use of the term
'witnesss' / 'kshetrajna' with respect to the jiva.
