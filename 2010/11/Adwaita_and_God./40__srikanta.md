I hesitate to get into this conversation, but would just like to point out
that in the
yoga system, ISvara is nowhere described as the creator of the universe.
As per
the yogasUtra (and if I remember right, the yogabhAshya too), ISvara is
only a
special kind of purusha (purusha-viSesha), who is always free of prakRti
and is
never tainted by the impurities of identification with prakRti, that is all.

The classical yoga school is aligned with sAMkhya, where creation is due
to the
contact of purusha(s) and prakRti. Neither purusha alone nor prakRti alone
can
create, as per both sAMkhya and yoga. Creation needs purusha-prakRti saMyoga,
whereas in yoga, ISvara is always in viyoga with respect to prakRti.

Nevertheless, in yoga, tasya vAcakaH praNavaH - OM is the symbol of ISvara.

Let me elaborate on that point.All Dwaita schools,and Yoga school is no
exception start with the premise that there is a creator.Whether we call
it Purusha,or Ishwara with Purusha associated with prakrthi,they all end
up with Dwaita drsti.Only the Adwaita or vedanta discriminates Ishwara
from Brahman or Turiya.
The Mandukya sruthi describing the third pada says,:
Yatra supto na kancana kamam kamayate,na kancana svapnam pasyati,tat
shusuptam!shusuptastana Ekibhutah prajnanaghana evanandamayo hyanandabhuk
cetomukah prajnastritiya padah!!5!!.
Continuing it says:
Esha sarveshwara esha sarvajnah eshontaryamaishayonih sarvasya
prabhavapyayou hi bhutanam!!6!!.

Describing the fourth pada,the Turiya, Mandukya sruthi says,:
Nantahprajnam na bahishprajnam nobhayatahprajnam na prajnanghanam na
prajnam naaprajnam!
