Dear sunil Bhattacharyaji,
In the Bhagawadgita,Sri Krishna,says,"Jnanayogena sankhyanam,Karmayogena
Yoginam".Here,He means Snkhya and karma yoga,and not Patanjali Yoga as you
have written.Karmayoga means doing one's Karma,rituals.Further,you say
Ishwara is OM.This is not correct.According to Mandukya Upanishad,the
fourth state or the "Turiya"is designated the symbol,"OM".The Upanishad
begins with,"Omithi Ekaksharam".Acharya gaudapada and Shankara in their
Karikas and commentary has clearly explained that the "Ishwara"or
"Pragnya"belongs to the third state.Whereas,the fourth state is "Turiya"
or "Brahman".That is the uniqueness about Vedanta.The other systems stop
with "Ishwara"or the creator,but,the Vedanta or BrAHMAVADA TRANSCENDS
IT,AND POINTS OUT THE UNIFYING PRINCIPLE,i.e BRAHMAN IN THE CREATION.

                                                        N.Srikanta.
