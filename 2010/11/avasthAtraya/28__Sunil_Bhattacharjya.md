Dear friends,

While the experts will respond to the query may I add an additional query by asking is it not that generally the "Vichara" (ie. the preview} comes first and then comes he "Prakriya" (ie. the activity)) and then at the last step comes the "Pariksha" (ie. the review).

Regards,

Sunil K. Bhattacharjya

Dear List Members,



namo namaH |

When it comes to avasthAtraya, I have seen the following expressions:

avasthAtraya vicAra,

avasthAtraya prakR^iyA and recently in the messages of the list,

avasthAtraya parIkShA.



Are all those expressions exact synonyms?

In French, we use to say that no word/expression is really an exact synonym of another word/expression ant that it is always worth to try to discrimininate between seeming synonyms.

Should be grateful for comments.
