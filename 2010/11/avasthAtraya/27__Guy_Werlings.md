Dear List Members,



namo namaH |

When it comes to avasthAtraya, I have seen the following expressions:

avasthAtraya vicAra,

avasthAtraya prakR^iyA and recently in the messages of the list,

avasthAtraya parIkShA.



Are all those expressions exact synonyms?

In French, we use to say that no word/expression is really an exact synonym of another word/expression ant that it is always worth to try to discrimininate between seeming synonyms.

Should be grateful for comments.
