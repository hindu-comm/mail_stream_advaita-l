Dear Sunil Bhattacharji,
Well,you are again bentupon picking few statements which you yourself put
into your mouth.I know that Buddhists believe that there were many Buddhas
before Gautama the Budha and also there are many Jataka parables on
that.As of now the Prajnaparamita sutra form the heart of Buddhism.No one
would have ignored them.But,the Lankavatara Sutra is the head of
Buddhism.Most of the concepts of mahayana Buddhism is contained in it.it
had the seeds of Mahayana Buddhism even before Mahayana Buddhism came into
vogue.Bodhidharma,(also from Kanchipuram from Tamilnadu),"The Wall Gazing
Monk",who developed the martial art of karate,judo and kung fu,had his
authority from the lankavatara Sutra.It is not that the Satasahasrika
Prajnaparamita sutra,the Lotus sutra are not inpportant.They are very
vast.One has to be careful about the terms used in these sutras.It is too 
childish to say that niether Gaudapada nor Shankara criticised Buddha.I
never said anything about criticism.It is the understanding of the
"prakriyas"which are important,and not what some body said about the
other.

Regards,                                             N.Srikanta.
