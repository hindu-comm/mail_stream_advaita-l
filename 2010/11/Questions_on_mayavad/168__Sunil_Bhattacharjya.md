Dear Shyamji,

I fully agree with you. The Buddhist scriptures were completely distorted by the time of Adi Sankaracharya. Adi Sankaracharya had to criticise the Buddhist literature prevailing then as the Buddhists themselves were confused as to what Shunyata is. Vasubandhu and his disciple Dignaga (the latter lived about a couple of centuries before Adi Sankaracharya) could not retain the original teachings of Lord Buddha. At first Vasubandhu did not agree with his half-brother Asanga and wrote one book on Abhidharma and later on he went to the side of Asanga and wrote a second book, where he opposed his own earlier views on Abhidharma. Adi Sankaracharya had to criticise the Buddhist knowledge and literature of his time as he wanted to bring to us back the Pure Vedantic knowledge through his work on the Prasthanatraya.. That is why there is reference to the writing of Dharmakirti in Sutrabashya.

There is another aspect also The Vishnu Purana also says that Lord Buddha created confusion. In Sarnath he first taught about the Moral code which is basic. He talked about Anatma. Then two decades later he taught the concept of Shunyata and the tenets of the Mahayana Buddhism. In spite of Nagrjuna's telling that Shunyata is not Nihilism and that Parajanaparamita also mentioning about the Shunyata after one leaves the five skandhas, there are and there will always be people who will go on calling Buddha's philosophy as Nihilism. About the origin of the Tantric Buddhism also there are controversies.

Shyamji, any idea as to the Vedantists' view (throughout the centuries) on Lord Buddha being an Avatara of Lord Vishnu. It seems that in many Buddha viharas, probably more in Sri Lanka, there are statues of Lord Vishnu, which are looked at reverentially. by the Buddhists. Sri Ramakrishna paramhansa also says that there is no doubt about Lord Buddha being an Avatara of Lord Vishnu. Swami Vivakananda tells us about him very superlatively. Dr. radhakrishnan says that he was a reformer of Hinduism. Personally I worship him as the Avatara of Lord Vishnu.

Regards,

Sunil K. Bhattacharjya

"To be brief from every point of view that this Buddhist doctrine may be examined for finding out some justification, it breaks down like a well sunk in sand; and we do not find any the least logic here. Hence also all behavior based on the Buddhist scripture is unjustifiable. MOREOVER BuddhA exposed HIS OWN INCOHERENCE in talk when he instructed the three mutually contradictory theories of the existence of external objects, existence of consciousness and absolute nihilism; or he displayed HIS MALEVOLENCE (was malicious) towards all creatures, acting under the DELUSION that these creatures would get confused by imbibing contradictory views. The idea is that the Buddhist view should be abjured in every way by all who desire the highest good" 

Adi Sankara in His Sutra bhyashya.
