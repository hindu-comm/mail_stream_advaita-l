If it is said that the attributes of Brahman are not real,then it violates
the Sruthi statement which declares:Satyam,Jnanam,Anantam Brahma.It is not
necessary for the "Jagat"to disappear for the Brahman to appear,these
attributes are Eternal.Further,the above statement doesnot refer to the
"Gunas"as Ramanuja says,but the very nature of the Brahman,like the SUN.
