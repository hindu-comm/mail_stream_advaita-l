With reference to the above topic,the Sruthis and the smrtis say that
"Brahman is all knowing"."Drstaram drste viparilopo na vidyate",there is
no "lopa"or mitigation for one who is all knowing.The Brahman has been
categorised as ,the "Drk",with which all things become known.It is like
the electric current,which cannot be seen by eyes,but,whose presence can
be felt.
The description of the "Turiya"in the Mandukyopanishad,negates all the
conceptions of the "Vaishwanara"of the Jagrt state,the "Taijasa" of the
svapna state and finally the "Prajna"of the sushupti state.The fourth
state is "amatra","avyavaharyah",but nowhere the Upanishad says it is not
knowing.It is "Suryavat prakashah".
