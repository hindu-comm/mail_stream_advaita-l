Sorry. there are some slips in typing. Please read the last line as follows:

"Kena tells us that It is because of Him that our ears can enable us to 
hear and because of Him that our eyes can enable us to see etc. "

Dear Venkateshji,

You are right. In the Turiya state one attains the Oneness, albeit for the duration of that time oif deep sleep and there is nothing to be known. Permanent oneness is realized only after the final fall of the body, ie. when one is beyond the cycle of birth and death.

"Sarvam khalvidam Brahma". So which object other than Him He needs to know? Is there anything else other than Himself to know.? Does He need eyes like ours to see objects or does he need ears like ours to hear sounds of this world? Any efforts to describe Brahman's whys and hows will be futile. The answer will be only Neti Neti. Kena tells us that It is because of Him that our ears can enable us to hear and because of Him that our eyes can enable us to hear etc. 

Regards.

Sunil K. Bhattacharjya

About Turiya they say Kevalam Asti Iti Vaktum Sakyam. We can say only
It is. Knowing something is only at Vyavahara level because there
should be knower and known thing. In Turiya Avastha there is only One
thing There is no knower and no known thing also. There is nothing to
know. Any comments?

Regards
