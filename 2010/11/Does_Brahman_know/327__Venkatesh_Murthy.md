That Mandukya Karika Mantra has Sarvajna also. Brahman can be Sarvajna
because other than itself there is nothing to know.

But there is interesting question.

Is Brahman with I consciousness? For I consciousness there must be
other. If there is no other is there I? Is I consciousness because of
Ego?
