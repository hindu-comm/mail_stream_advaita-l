With reference to the above topic,Brahman can know others.The I as ego is
absent after realisation,but the conciousness is not absent,according to
the sruthis and smrthis.But,the knowledge is not present in the limited
sense.The limited "I" as ego can see with the karanas with the
"Antahkarana"and the senses.The "antahkarana"now becomes very sensitive
and the Brahman can know with the pure "antahkarana".
