Yes in Turiya we can say Brahman knows nothing but itself. We can say
also Brahman knows everything is Sarvajna because there is nothing
other than itself. Both can be right.

Interesting question for me is there I feeling in Brahman. I say no
because I say I because there are other things. If there is no other
thing will I say I? There is no I there is no other.

Sthiraprajna does have a feel of the Turiya but one has to wait till the body is finally left to be in Turiy permanenetly. We know that "Prajnanam Brahma" and there is nothing to worry for a Sthiraprajna, who will eventually be in Turiya and attain the silence, when he leaves the body with all the five koshas. Then one will not be different from the Brahman and lose the individual existence. Then it is not to be asked when He knows Himself or not. Probably the Nasadiya sukta (RS 10.129) will be useful to us to appreciate the situation.
