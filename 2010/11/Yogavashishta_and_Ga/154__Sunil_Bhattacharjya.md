Just a few minutes ago I saw Vidyasankarji's reply and I do not have more to say.

Sri sunil Bhattacharya,
You say that vedanta teaches at the ultimate level and Yoga teaches at the
Vedanthic level.This is wrong.Yoga may teach at its own level,but it
cannot replace vedanta which doesnot require kriya.You are wrong when you
say that"cittavrttinirodha'is necessary for the manana.Shankara in his
introduction to the Brahmasutrabhashya doesnot mention Yoga.Vedanta
requires only discrimination of atma from the anatma.Yoga involves other
kriyas which require Ashtangayoga marga.
sincerely,                     N.Srikanta.
