Dear Sri Kamakshi Raghav,
In my statement,"As the society became more and more civilized",I was only
referring to the general decorum and civilization one is expected to
observein our offices or outside.Have we become Barbarians and descended
to the low level of Rack age men?
 Bhava Shankara desika me Sharanam.                                       
 N.Srikanta.
