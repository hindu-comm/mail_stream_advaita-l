Dear Sunil Bhattacharyaji,
The Yuga concept has been their in our Puranas.No body knows for certain
when the Yuga concept started,and there is no way of verifying them.We
donot know when Manu smrthi was written and when Yajnavalkya smrthi was
written.There is no chronological accuracy about these dates.We can only
surmise that Manusmrthi was written by Manu(again there are many Manus,and
the smrthi have been amended many times) and that Yajnavalkya smrthi was
written by Yagnavalkya.we Indians despite having a huge trasurehouse of
knowledge,are poor in keeping accurate chronological records unlike the
Europians.Iam not taliking about that.What Iam saying is the emergence of
the caste system by Varnasankara after the creation.
Regards,                                            N.Srikanta.
