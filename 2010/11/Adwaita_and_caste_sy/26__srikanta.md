Dear Raghavendra Ganti,I think you are not following and understanding
what I said.It is not outward appearances I mean.There is what is
called,'Samanya dharma",and 'Vishesha dharma".The Samanyadharma is to
follow the civilization.Do not unnecessarily argue on that.It is like
following  the traffic rules.'Vishesha dharma" is one who follows the
Vedanta,who has come to it,understands not only samanya dharma and is
above this.(this doesnot mean he will do what he likes).What I asked
was,have we not come far from the Rockman?
                                                         N.Srikanta.
