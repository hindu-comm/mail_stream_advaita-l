Dear Umashankar
You have gone off-tangent.I am not contesting any smrthis or the veracity
of Vyasa or Parasara.The question was when and how the caste system
started?.we see from the puranas that the castes were formed by
varnasankara.That is all.You can read the Brahmavaivartapurana which was
also compiled by Vyasa.
                                                   N.Srikanta.
