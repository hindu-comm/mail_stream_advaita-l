Dear Srikanta,

The Yuga concept is clean, clear and precise way of measuring time. There is
no end to doubts , one can doubt veracity of ANY printed text. To accept the
scriptures as they are available to us today is the only thing that we have
in our hands.

I agree with Sunil ji one should read the Parashara Smrti for clarity in
this matter.

Works of Sri Vyasa Maharshi is for the Kaliyuga. Priori to Kaliyuga, they
were all one. He had given classification precisely for us, in this age.
However, reading the original sanskrit version with dedication can make ALL
the difference. It needs dedication and sankalpa..
