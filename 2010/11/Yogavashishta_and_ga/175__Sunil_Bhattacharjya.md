Shri Shrikanta,

Vedanta is the teachings at the Upanishadic level and it is at the Ultimate level. No advaitin disputes the Superiority of Vedantic Jnana. The yog upanioshads teach the Yoga at the Vedantic level. Jnana and Yoga are inalienable till the Brahman is attained. Kundalini too is mentioned in Veda. Jnana and Yoga are complementary one cannot do without the other in the spiritual journey. Nobody has demeaned yga as you are trying to do by your partial assessment of Gaudapada's knowledge. You are taking Yoga as a competitor of Jnana and I never said that Jnana is not necessary. Jnana is necessary and Yoga too is necessary. It appears that you cannot understand this simple thing. "Chittavritttinirodha" is a must for "Manana".

Sincerely,

Sunil K. Bhattacharjya

Dear sunil Bhattacharyaji,
Inspiteof my explanation that Vedanta and Yoga are different systems you
keep on repeating that both vedanta and yoga are necessary.I again
say,Vedanta is a fullfledged system and doesnot require the prop of
Yoga.Vedanta depends on sravana,manana,nidhidhyasana.It doesnot need
dhyana also as sen from the discussions in "naishkarmyasiddhi"by
Sureshwara.Shankara in his Adhyasabhashya explains at length that the
brahmajijnasa only involves discrimination between Atma and anatma,the
Self and the non-self.It doesnot involve any other kriya or action.If one
has come to the point of enquiry,what is needed is the removal of avidya
by sravana itself.So says, Adi Shankara
Bhagawathpada.Katha,Maitrayana,(which is not a major upanishad)doesnot say
Yoga is involved.Both Shankara and Sureshwara follow Gaudapada in this
aspect.After saying Yoga is like drying the ocean drop by drop with a
blade of grass,:

"Utseka udadheryadwat kushagraikabinduna!
manaso nigrahastadwadwavedaparikhedatah!!"Karika 41 of Adwaita prakarana.

Insisting that Vedanta requires Yoga also as a supplant to it shows that
one has not followed Shankara.

Regards,                    N.Srikanta.
