Namasthe, 
I was recently at a workshop when a passing remark was made  that Shi Va (as two sounds) were the next ones that followed the pranava nada of AUM and that Shi represents the creative energy (prakruthi ?) While Va represents the unchanging Consciousness (purusha?).

I could not get much time to request for elloboration on that during the session. I sincerly hope to improve my understanding from the learned members on this.

Thanks and Regards
Murali
