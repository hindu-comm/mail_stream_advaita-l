Dear Srikantaji,

I said that it is available in the Bhagavad Gita of 745 verses. It appears that you have not read the Gitamana verse of the Bhagavad Gita which says that there are 745 verses in the Bhagavad Gita. Now please don't take it as my trying to show off my knowledge. I an telling you what I read in the Mahabharata myself. The manuscript from Varanasi had this verse as published in the Gondal royal library has this verse. As you are well-read on Vedanta Desha you must be knowing that Vedanta Deshika also knew about the rare verses if the Bhagavad Gita.

Please do not come to a hasty decision without knowing what Yogavashishtha told about yoga. Also tell me where Gaudapada.says Yoga to be unnecessary. You have to understand Gaudapada's statements. Controllong ming is difficult and Arjuna says the same thing to Lord and Lord told that Abhyasha makes it possible.

Sunil K. Bhattacharjya

Dear Sunil Bhattacharji,
I am presenting my discussions with evidence.The Verse in the Gaudapada
karikas,Viz."Adavante ca yan nasti...." is not found in the Bhagawath
Gita.Do not say some thing which cannot be verified.Further,Bhagawath Gita
contains verses which are not polemic,and Yogavashishta also doesnot
contain verses which are not polemic.Though Yogavashista has the term Yoga
in it,it is not patanjala Yoga and we donot find any concept or stanzas
which are in Patanjala Yoga.

Though Gaudapada Karikas say about the Yoga,Gaudapada says that the
Practice of Yoga is like emptying the mind like drying the ocean drop by
drop with a blade of grass.Gaudapada
 quotes a story in "Titipokhyana",in
which a bird,
Titipa which has layed eggs on the shore of the ocean,tries to dry the
ocean drop by drop by emptying the ocean drop by drop with a blade of
Kusha grass.Literally he taunts those who believe naively that they can
control the mind through Yoga.Read further the Karikas,and Gaudapada
explains how futile the control of the mind is.Donot come to a hasty
conclusion without further reading the Karikas.
                         N.Srikanta.
