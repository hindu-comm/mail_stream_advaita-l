Dear Sunil Bhattacharji,
I had to bring in Jainism with Buddhism because you had asked a
question,"what is Dharmakaya".Dharmakaya or Dharmastikaya,or
"Pudgalastikaya" are common terms used in Buddhism and Jainism.Do you
understand?.We find many terms commonly used in both Jainism and
Buddhism.After all,Jainism preceded Buddhism only about a century before.I
donot want all that for you to comment.Now,You explain what you know by
the word,"Dharmakaya" or "Bodhkaya".You are bringing new
words(now,Bodhkaya),and unnecessarily arguing,evading the issue.You
explain what you mean by "DharmaKaya"?.
                                                       N.Srikanta.
