Dear jaldhar vyasji,pranams.
On Nov 8 you had posted a query asking what,the word,"dharmakaya" had to
do with Adwaita.Let me explain.

While discussing Gaudapada karikas I had brought the word,"Dharma"found in
the karikas,which means Atma in Adwaita Vedanta.Sri.Sunil Bhattacharya
then put the question whether I know what is "Dharmakaya".Later all the
discussions ensued.

Regards,                                              N.Srikanta.
