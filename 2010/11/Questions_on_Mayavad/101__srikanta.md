Dear Sunil Bhattacharji,
What proof do you have to deny that Jainism didnot precede Buddhism?.As a
historian you must know.Even an elementary school child knows from history
books that Jainism preceded Buddhism.Further,it is immaterial to the
present discussion.Buddhists say that awareness itself is "Shunya".They
deny any perception saying that it is an illusion,like "Fata
morgana"(castles in the sky),Ka pushpavat(like flowers in the sky),Mrga
marichika(mirage),Like Keshondrka(bhataraka)illusions of shapes created by
pressing one's eyes etc.In "Alambhana pareeksha",Dignaga says that there
is no basis for perception.When there is no scope for memory which are
fleeting,where is the scope for awareness.That is why Gaudapada says these
Buddhists are adventurists to deny what they see,and the nihilists(shunya
vadis) are more adventurists(sahasataram)because they want to catch the
sky in their fists!.Only,Adwaita or Vedanta say that Jnana alone or
awareness alone remains.
