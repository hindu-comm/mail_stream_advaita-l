Dear Shrikantaji,

Firstly was there any need for your bringing in Jainism into it while trying to get at what Bodhakaya is? Show me where did the Jainisn talk about Bodhakaya as its concept? Which Mahayana texts did you read which brought in jainism into exolanation of Bodhakaya? Will it not be better to read the Mahayana texts only when the term is from Mahayana Buddjism and not get perplexed by the unnecessary digression to Jainism?

Dear sunil Bhattacharji,
While explaining the description of Dharmakaya,I have followed the books
on Buddhism.Dharmakaya is the entity encompassing Physical,mental and the
intellectual faculties,with which a being function,which is called a
"Dharma"in Buddhist parlance.Dharma in short(it is not charity as we
ordinarily use)any being or Atma which funtion in the world for its
sustenance and safety is denoted by "Dharmakaya".
If it is not, why don't you explain?
                           N.Srikanta.
