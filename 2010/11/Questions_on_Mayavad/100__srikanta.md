Dear Sri Shivasenani,
It is nice to read you Email.I am sorry to say that You have broughtup my
reply in this context,calling it an irony, when I might have answered in
some other context.
I am also sorry to say that my answer was not silence when you had said
that you have read the MandukyaUpanishad and the Gaudapada Karikas.You
might have answered to Sri Sunil Bhattacharya's query on BG,and on
Abhinava Gupta,who belonged to Kashmir Shaivism.I donot remember when this
topic was raised.Any way,the "Paramarthasara"is said to have been written
by "Adi Sesha",and has been brought by Abhinava Gupta.Prof.Suryanarayana
sastri has written a traslation of the book.There was a claim by some
scholars that Gaudapada karikas has some verses from "Paramarthasara".On
going through the book,"Paramarthasara",I didnot find any resemblence to
Gaudapada karikas.

In this connection,I sincerely say that my intention was not to overlook
your reply.I am sure that our interest(which you may also share) in these
discussions is not to browbeat anyone,much less winning a debate or Vada
over the other.We are interested in understanding the scrptures or
exchange knowledge.
Regards,                                             N.Srikanta.
