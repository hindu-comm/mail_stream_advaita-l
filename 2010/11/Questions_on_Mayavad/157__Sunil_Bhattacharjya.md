Dear Srikantaji,

What proof do you have to say that Jainism preceded Buddhism? Please do not make wrong statement. Understand?

I said in a letter, just sent a little while before to the group, that Dharmakaya is the third body the truth body and is achieved when Shunyata is achieved. It is also called the Buddha mind or the Buddha awareness (ie. Bodhakaya). When Shunyata is achieved only awareness remains.

Dear Sunil Bhattacharji,
I had to bring in Jainism with Buddhism because you had asked a
question,"what is Dharmakaya".Dharmakaya or Dharmastikaya,or
"Pudgalastikaya" are common terms used in Buddhism and Jainism.Do you
understand?.We find many terms commonly used in both Jainism and
Buddhism.After all,Jainism preceded Buddhism only about a century before.I
donot want all that for you to comment.Now,You explain what you know by
the word,"Dharmakaya" or "Bodhkaya".You are bringing new
words(now,Bodhkaya),and unnecessarily arguing,evading the issue.You
explain what you mean by "DharmaKaya"?.
                          N.Srikanta.
