I want to express my resentment of Mr. Sunil Bhattacharjya's presumptive and 
opinionated statements where he thinks some other list member has not studied / 
understood this or that; or that for some other scholar joining the list is 
beneath his scholarship; or constantly asking for proof, without offering it 
himself or without substantiating his explanations. For the strong opinions he 
expresses abuot others knowledge and understanding there is amazingly little 
scholarly input from him in at least backing up such statements. Going by past 
form, I would expect him toignore the specific request of Mr. Srikanta to 
explain Dharmakaya, but such is unbecoming of somebody who threw the challenge 
that Mr. Srikanta does not understand "Dharmakaya". 


Time, he put up or shut up.

There is a little history behind it. Earlier he (Mr. Bhattacharjya)accused me 
of not reading Abhinava Gupta's commentary on the Bhagavat Gita. When I followed 
up with a detailed explanationthere was total silence. Theirony is that Mr. 
Srikanta himself indulges in such presumptive statements; he had earlierhinted 
that I did not read Mandukya Upanishad, and when I posted back saying that I 
indeed did and that I did post with reference to some obscure aspects, 
therewassilence.Neither of themso much as ackowledged thefact or bothered 
to say that the slur againstme was incorrect.

I hope we will see less of such posts in this forum.

N. Siva Senani

Dear sunil Bhattacharji,
While explaining the description of Dharmakaya,I have followed the books
on Buddhism.Dharmakaya is the entity encompassing Physical,mental and the
intellectual faculties,with which a being function,which is called a
"Dharma"in Buddhist parlance.Dharma in short(it is not charity as we
ordinarily use)any being or Atma which funtion in the world for its
sustenance and safety is denoted by "Dharmakaya".
If it is not, why don't you explain?
                            N.Srikanta.
