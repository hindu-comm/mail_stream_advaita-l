Dear sunil Bhattacharji,
While explaining the description of Dharmakaya,I have followed the books
on Buddhism.Dharmakaya is the entity encompassing Physical,mental and the
intellectual faculties,with which a being function,which is called a
"Dharma"in Buddhist parlance.Dharma in short(it is not charity as we
ordinarily use)any being or Atma which funtion in the world for its
sustenance and safety is denoted by "Dharmakaya".
If it is not, why don't you explain?
                                                         N.Srikanta.
