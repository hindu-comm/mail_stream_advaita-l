"Do you think you can stay in Lodges built in Vaikuntam
to have a darshan of Lord Vishnu"?

praNAms 
Hare Krishna

Perhaps, we might have to swim across the 'ksheera sAgara' & climb the 
'Adishesha' to have the 'darshana' of srimannArAyaNa :-))  I dont think 
this would be a difficult task for those who have successfully crossed the 
'bhava sAgara' with bhagavad kAruNya.

No offence is meant to any vaishNava bhakta-s, just on the lighter note 
after reading the 'lodging facility' at vaikunTa :-))

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
