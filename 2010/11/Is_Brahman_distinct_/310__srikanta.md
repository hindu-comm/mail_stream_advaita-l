This is with reference to the above question raised in this list.Brahman
and Ishwara are not distinct in one way.It is Brahman as a Karana creates
the world,which include all the Jivas.In that sense,Jiva and Ishwara are
distinct.We cannot equate Ishwara with Jiva.This the Phenomenon,the
"Vyavaharika"point of view.Ishwara endowed with the power of Maya,creates
this world.Still,Brahman is Ishwara,not an outside agency.But,if the
"ajnana"is eliminated, by the "sastra"the "jiva bhava",is removed and the
Jiva becomes Brahman."Brahma veda Brahmaiva bhavati".For him the world and
Ishwara doesnot exist separately.This has been discussed by Shankara in
the "Brahmasutra bhashya",in the "Guha pravistou adhikarana"and the one
referring to the Mundaka sruthi:

     Dva suparna sayuja sakhayah samana vrukshau samparishaksvajate!
     tayor anyah pippalam svadatti anasnanayo abhisakhasiti!!.
