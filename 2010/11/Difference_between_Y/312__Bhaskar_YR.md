Can any list members tell me the difference between Yetis and Avadhutas. 

praNAms
Hare Krishna

Just a piece of thought  in the middle to hectic official work!!  yati-s 
are comparatively more desciplined and most of the time come under some 
traditional folder..whereas avadhUta-s are live in their own world without 
any strict adherence to external formalities...

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
