Dear friends,

What is the status of Karma, Sankhya 
and Yoga in front of Vedanta? Will you like to go through the following and give your valued comments.

On
 karma the Lord said "Asakto hyaacharan karma param apnoti purushah". 
There are several similar verses where the Lord upheld the Karma as a 
means.for attaining the param purusha. One has to work dilligently and 
being in Yoga as the Lord said in the Bhagavad Gita. The Lord also said 
that the Yogi is higher than the man of Knowledge when he said 
"Tapasvibhyo'dhiko-----tasmaad yogi bhavarjuna". Again the 
Yogasikhopanishad says one may be learned, dispassionate, knower of the 
religious principles and have mastery over the senses yet one cannot 
escape the body without Yoga. Kindly note that this is from an 
Upanishad. Further People generally ignore that Vivekakhyati is very 
much a part of
 the Yoga and Vivekakhyati has been mentioned by Patanjali. The lovers of Bhagavad 
Gita also know that the Lord also clubbed Sankhya and Yoga together. Does 
not all these point to the fact that one cannot ignore Yoga in favour of
 Jnana, as both are important? Howevermuch one may try to acquire Jnana 
it will be futile without Yoga.

Sunil K. Bhattacharjya
