I have again and again stresed that shankara in his bhashyas has explained
that Jnana and karma cannot be mixedup and practiced.This he has brought
up again and again with purvapakshas and explained that they cannot be
mixed up and practiced.similar is the Yoga.he has always said that Yoga or
sankhya cannot bring realisation or samyagjnana.If people again and again
are harping on Yoga,jnana-karma samuccaya,then they have not understood
shankara bhashyas.Shankara has clearly answered these with the appropriate
Purvapaksha.One has to clearly read them and understand.If they understand
only half-way through,then it means they have not understood fully.
