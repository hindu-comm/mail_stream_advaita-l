Hari OM, Srikanta ji,

I've been trying to follow many of your mails but its really becoming
difficult to follow any particular idea you discuss. May I request you to
kindly reply to existing mails when you have any
discussion points rather than mailing with new subject lines each time you
send the mail? Else at least I feel completely lost to follow your line of
argument because there is no sequence for me to
follow as to which particular mail you intended the response to and what
particular point is being debated placing your thought against someone
else's.

Moreover, even after the admin mail, you continue to send as many mails per
day with a paragraph or two each, also insisting that others have not
understood properly. Your reasoning would
be well appreciated if its placed against the original mail you're replying
to and preferably limiting it to a couple of mails combining replies to
several threads you've created. Thanks in advance and I do hope you take it
in the right spirit.

praNAm,
--Praveen R. Bhat
