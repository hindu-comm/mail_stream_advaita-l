Hari Om Shri Srikrishnaji, Pranaams!

anvitAbhidhAnavAda advocate that words already grammatically connected, have 
the denotative power.  abhihitAnvayavvAda advocate that there is the 
subsequent connection of the words denoting their meaning.

madhusUdana sarasvati svAmiji deals these and refutes in his work 
vedAntakalpalatikA (27 & 28) while determining the meaning of mahAvAkya 'tat 
tvam asi'.

In Shri Guru Smriti,
Br. Pranipata Chaitanya
