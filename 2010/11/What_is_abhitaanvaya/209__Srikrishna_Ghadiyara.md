Refer to page 42 onwards of Samkshepa saareeraka of Sarvajnaatman - translated 
by Prof. N. Veezhinathan:

"There remains one important question, namely, how is the meaning of a sentence 
known? Two theories are put forward to answer this question, one known as 
abhitaanvaya-vaada, and the other, anvitaayabhidhaana-vada."

I read through the text, but not able to comprehend clearly and completely. 
Would someone who has already studied this text, or someone who read these 
concepts from other texts help me understand. Would you please point me to some 
other place where these concepts are analyzed, so that I may get to read a 
different presentation.

I have other clarifications to seek on Samkshepa saareeraka. But, I will reserve 
them to later posts.

Thank you

Srikrishna
