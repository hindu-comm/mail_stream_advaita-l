This is exactly what is meant by Vedantized yoga.  What I am describing
under that moniker is far different from the dualistic samkhya/yoga.  Look
at the way Shankaracharya uses the words samkhya and yoga in the
Gitabhashya for instance.

It is being misunderstood.
What I said was with reference to Shankara Bbhashya on Brahmasutra
bhashya.What I said was Shankara has brought the "Purvapaksha"of Sankhya
and Yoga and examined them that sankhya and Yoga have no place as far as
Adwaita darshana is concerned.That is why in both the purvapaksha of
Sankhya and Yoga he says,"Purvapakshan vyavartayati".This objection is
ruled out.he says Samyagdarshana is obtained only through the Vedanta and
not through Sankhya or yoga.There is no scope for Vedantized Yoga.
