This is a different case. When you are doing Puja you have to say
mantras in Sanskrit only not English or Persian. Will you say God
understands all languages let me say in Persian ? We are not secular
in these activities. We believe God is pleased by Sanskrit only not
others.  Posting messages here is like that. Theoretically all
messages must be in Sanskrit but all do not understand so we write
English. We can accept it as common language for practical purpose.

When a person sends New Year greeting in Urdu it is bad because here
some people do not understand Urdu . He should have used Sanskrit.  He
should have used English a common language of the list members but
Urdu is outrageous. It reminds us of very bad things.

They use the words because all people in the audience in that area
like North India understand them. Will they use Urdu words in front of
a English speaking audience?  Will they use it front of a Tamil
audience ? Please think.
