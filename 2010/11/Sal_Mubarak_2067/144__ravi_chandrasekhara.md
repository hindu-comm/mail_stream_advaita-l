Pranam,

The points brought up by Jaldhar and Vidya are noted and practical.  IMHO, but many of us identify English with USA (not a tormentor for us) as opposed to the UK.

Also, this may be generalization, but some opposition to Hindi in South India in the past, may be because of Muslim association.  Another thing is that, with Urdu words (via Farsi and Arabic) being used more in Hindi, people do not know/understand the Shuddh Hindi or Sanskrit words.  When I speak in Hindi, I prefer to use uttar, pariksha, arthaat, jeevan, vivaha, hryudaya, etc. But I do realize people understand jaldi better than sheegrahi and hence use that.

Also another interesting point, is that many South Indian languages have words closer to Shuddh Hindi and Sanskrit. Like use of the words: samachar, sheegrama, uttar, batte in Kannada from vastra, beti in Kannada from bhet.
Another example being: Su khabar che in Gujarati and Kya taaza khabar in Hindi would be said as Yenu samachara or Yenu vishehsa in Kannada.

But as Vidya pointed out; there are also Urdu words in usage in South Indian languages: Masti majja madi and jawaba helu in Kannada and in my Sankethi dialect - yeneki taakat illai (same as mujhe taakat nehi) and Avanki naseeb raandi (same as uski nasseb hai).
