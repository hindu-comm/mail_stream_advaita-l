Sri Sunil Bhattacharya,
I am sorry to say that Iam not interested in Chronology about krishna's
time and Buddha's time.No two historians agree and they are not
consistent.They differ in the dates of very near happennings.Besides it is
immaterial and irrelevant to the topic of discussion.If you say that
Buddhism existed even before gautamaBuddha,then it is immaterial to
discuss the chronology.
Sincerely,                       N.Srikanta.
