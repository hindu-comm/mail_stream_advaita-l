Dear Sunil Bhattacharji,
Those who sasy that Ishwara in yoga is a sort of special Purusha without
the veil,and that it is the same as Brahman have not understood Shankara's
Adwaita.If we say that Yoga and Jnana are one,then they have not
understood Shankara.Shankara has exhaustively covered this in his
bhashyas.If a Yogi remains in dwaita,then he cannot escape sorrow.If you
want to know about this,read Ishavasyopanishad and Shankara
Bhashya.Incidentally you had said,Shankara had to write two bhshyas on
Kenopanishad.Infact,he has written two bhashyas on Ishavasyopanishad
also.One following Kanva shakha,and the other following Madhyandina
shakha.Such "Patantharas"are common in bhashyas.
                                                      N.Srikanta.
