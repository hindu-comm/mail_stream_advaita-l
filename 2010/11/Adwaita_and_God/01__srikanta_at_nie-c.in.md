Dear Sunil Bhattacharjee

You say according to Sankhya system,'Ishwara is asiddha".Is it not true?We
know the existence of Ishwara only through the vedas.But,Sankhya system is
not considered as "avaidik",just like Vaisheshika or other nonvaidik
philosophies.That is why Shankara didnot tookit upon itself for the
establishment of a personal God called Ishwara,but,engaged himself in
showing the vedas in the new light than the other thinkers.Shankara in his
major portion of his bhashyas has not bothered to show the existence of
Ishwara,but has shown the existence of Brahman,that is "Tatvamasi",or
"Aham Brahmasmi",'Sarvam khalu idam Brahma"Atmaivaidam sarvam"etc.That is
why he declares,Brahma satyam jagan mithya,jivo Brahmaiva naparah!.There
are many sentences in his Brahmasutrabhashya and other bhashyas,to prove
that he never held a personal God as Ishwara.That is why he is considered
as an atheist or praccanna Bauddha by other later schools as
Vishhishtadwaitins and dwaitins.
Regards,                                               N.Srikanta.
