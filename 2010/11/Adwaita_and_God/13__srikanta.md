Dear Sunil Bhattacharji,
You have said that Lord Rama told Hanuman that if one should study the
Upanishads,the one Upanishad is mandukya.Very True.it is said inin
"Muktikopanishad",Mandukyameva alam mumukhunam vimuktaye.Manukya itself is
enough for the aspirants of Liberation.
I donot deny that Bhagawadgita is not included in our study of Vedanta or
it is of less importance.It is only that the concepts said in Bhagawadgita
by the Lord is beter understood if one has a through understanding of the
terms from other scriptures,like Upanishads.Bhagawadgita is a compendium
of the knowledge enshrined in Upanishads.Terms
like,Kshetra,Kshetrajna,Prajna,etc.are contained in Upanishads.For
instance,
the shloka,
Indriyani Hayanahuh vishayan teshu gocaran!
Buddhim ca sarathim viddhi manahpragrahamevaca!!
is contained in the Bhagawadgita.

Regards,                                               N.Srikanta.
