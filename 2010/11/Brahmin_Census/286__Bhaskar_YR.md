May be this is not a brahmin community list. But still why should
anyone hesitate to write about brahmins.

praNAms
Hare Krishna

Ofcourse, this is not a brAhmins list  BUT this is the list meant for 
discussing brahmavidya or advaita vedAnta...sociopolitical issues such as 
who is minority, who is suffering coz. of this differentiation etc. 
strictly falls out of the scope of this list motives....Anyway, we can 
await for moderators' opinion on this issue.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
