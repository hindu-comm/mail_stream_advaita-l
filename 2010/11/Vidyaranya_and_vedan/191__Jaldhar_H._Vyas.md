It seems rather dubious to me but as I have not looked into the subject 
deeply I won't comment further.

No although this family were connected to the Vijayanagar court, Madhava 
Mantri is yet another person all together.  He is the author of the 
commentary on the Suta Samhita which is often wrongly ascribed to one of 
the other Madhavas or Vidyaranya.  But Madhava Mantri belonged to Angirasa 
gotra whereas the other Madhavas belong to Bharadvaja gotra.
