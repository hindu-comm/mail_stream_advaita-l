And by the way if someone thinks that using Venkatanaatha instead of
vedaanta deshika means that they were intimately familiar, or they
were playing golii and gillii in the dusty streets of kaanchiipuram
when they were young, rest assured it is not the case. Most of the
colophons in manuscripts refer to the work as that of venkaTanaatha -
as can be seen from the editions printed by caukaamba and so on.

As Vidyasankar remarked, politics seems to be the key here.
