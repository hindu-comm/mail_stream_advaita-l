Not to mention that for some all historical details are "hazy", but
the "fact" that these 2 (perhaps 3?) were classmates is crystal clear.

And isn't it amazing all these stories involve Kanchi? One would
imagine that there was no other place imparting vedic education! In
reality, Kanchi was hardly the key place for getting a traditional
vedic education (and is not even now) inspite of "nagareshu kaanchi"
and so on. It was and is Kumbakonam inside Tamil Nadu. The Govinda
Dikshitar Raja Patashalai in Kumakonam was till the beginning of the
century the biggest and is still the biggest. Most grantha books on
vedas as well as prayoga can be traced to this institution.
