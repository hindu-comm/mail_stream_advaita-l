No - he mentions Madhva specifically by name and also his theory that
he is the third incarnation of the the wind-god. He also mentions
Ramanuja specifically by name with regard to the vedaartha sangraha.
AND he begins his summary of the Madhva system by specifically calling
out Madhva by his name Anandatirtha. And in the Raseshvara darshana he
specifically calls out the names of their authorities govinda bhagavat
and sarvaj~na raameshvara. AND in the nyAya system he specifically
calls out sarvaj~na, pakShila-svAmin and udayana. And so on and so on.
Perhaps all of them were class mates at kaanchiipuram? Must have been
a stellar class indeed - not to mention that they must have been
students spanning many centuries.
