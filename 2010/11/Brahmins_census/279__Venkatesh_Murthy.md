All must follow Dharma but there must be sufficient protection in case
some do not follow it. A concrete example can be given. It is well
known there are very few followers of Atharvana Veda .  There was only
one good Atharvana Vedi in whole state of Gujarat. He had three sons.
First two sons were not interested in learning the Veda. The father
could not do anything but he could teach the last son. If the father
had only one son and he does not learn Veda what can the father do?
This is current pathetic situation in many families. There is no
protection of Dharma because there are not enough followers.

Regards
