Brahmin population in India is very low compared to others. The so
called minority Muslim population is officially 15% but unofficially
25 to 30% with large presence in states like UP, Bihar,West Bengal,
Kerala and others. Northeast States are Christian Majority states.
Where as Brahmins are pathetic 2% to 4% but situation in Kerala is
very bad at 0.7%. In TN it is 3%. But Government says Muslims and
Christians are minority. What a joke.

Why this situation prevails? Simple fact Muslims have more and more
children. The Growth Rate is higher than Hindu Growth Rate.

But our Hindus are killing female babies before they are born. Then
our modern educated couples are saying no to more babies.

If this continues Muslims will overtake many many Hindu communities.
Danger for India and world also.

Future of Brahmins will not improve with such pathetic population they
will not have political power. Brahminism is declining because many
are not following Dharma. But this effect will be compounded by low
population Growth Rate. In our Grand fathers time they had many
children. My Grand father had 5 sons and 4 daughters. One or two sons
could follow Dharma even if others neglected it. Today the choice is
not there. If there is only one son or two sons and they do not follow
Dharma what can father do?
