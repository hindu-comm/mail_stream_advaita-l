I read an Email from sri.Venkatesha murthy,which says Brahmins population
is declining and expresses concern that what will happen to Dharma if it
is not followed?He is right in expresing the concern.He also says that in
Grandfather's time,there were more children,if others donot follow the
dharma,
only one or two followed.
I would like to say that the rest of the Brahmins should follow the
dharma,irrespective of the Gender,and take pride in it.On no account they
must leave the dharma.
