I fully agree with Sri Pranav Peshwe. This is not a Brahmin list, but an Advaita 
list. I have something to say as to why I do not agree withSri Venkatesh, but I 
think that would start a discussion, which is inappropriate in this list.

Regards
N. Siva Senani

I (like many others) follow this group for the valuable thoughts and nuggets
of knowledge that are shared here.
My question to you, dear Venkateshji, is - how is this question relevant to
this group ? It would be my humble request to keep such controversial topics
out. Not just because it polarises the group, but because it is irrelevant
in the context of this mailing list.

Fellow readers, kindly correct me if I'm wrong.

Best regards,
Pranav
