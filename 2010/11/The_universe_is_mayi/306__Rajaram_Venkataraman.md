Subject: [Advaita-l] The universe is a mAyic appearance
Namaste.

In the Srimadbhagavatam is a verse on the mAyA-nature of the universe
explained with the rope-snake analogy:

http://vedabase.net/sb/10/14/25/

ātmānam <http://vedabase.net/a/atmanam> evātmatayāvijānatāḿ

A person who mistakes a rope for a snake becomes fearful, but he then gives
up his fear upon realizing that the so-called snake does not exist.
Similarly, for those who fail to recognize You as the Supreme Soul of all
souls, the expansive illusory material existence arises, but knowledge of
You at once causes it to subside.

*There is a more direct reference to the world being factually unreal in the
first verse *http://vedabase.net/sb/1/1/1/
*. "*Only because of Him do the material universes, temporarily manifested
by the reactions of the three modes of nature, appear factual, although they
are unreal"
