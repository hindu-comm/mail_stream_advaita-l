praNAms,

Happy Deepavali!

Here are some links on mailing list etiquette, which may be useful to
members, some of them frequent posters off late.

http://www.gweep.ca/~edmonds/usenet/ml-etiquette.txt
http://www.freebsd.org/doc/en/articles/mailing-list-faq/etiquette.html

Please read them carefully and follow them, in particular the sections
"Are there any important formatting considerations?" of the first link
and "What is considered proper etiquette when posting to the mailing
lists?" of the second.

I think that it is much simpler if the subscribers use a gmail/yahoo
account, as these mailers have some indexing facility as well as
"thread facility". It saves the posters a lot of formatting they
otherwise have to do by themselves, as well as the readers of making
out who is saying what. (The above sentence could also be
non-euphemistically written as "so that we do not delete mails from
you based on the sender's name"!)
