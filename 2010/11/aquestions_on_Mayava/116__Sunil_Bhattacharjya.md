Dear Srikantaji,

You are not aware of the meaning of Dharmakaya in Mahayana Buddhism.

Regards,

Sunil K. Bhattacharjya

Dear Sunil Bhattacharji,
You are calling the body along with antahkarana,its faculties as
"Dharmakaya".Dharmastikaya or pudgalastikaya are the same as,sthula
sarira,sukshma sarira in vedanta.In Jainism they call it as
"Pudgala",which mean,Purayati galati ca-that which gets filledup and get
destroyed.This is Dharmakaya.The destruction of this is
called,pudgalanairatmya.The emptiness in Buddhism or shunya is that which
is without a svabhava.The realisation of that is "Nirvana".Nirvana means
non-becoming,which means fullstop.Buddha taught that clinging to any
notion is samsara.
                            N.Srikanta.
