A suggestion & clarification  to the intolerent & narrow minded reader(s) 
from 'poor taste' author :-)

It is better to read twice what has been written , if they are not able to 
understand the general or universal  observation of the post from  the 
first reading...When I said 'OUR' present day vedAnta AchArya-s & guruji-s 
it is inclusive of guruji-s/Acharaya-s/vedAnta teachers  from all the 
trimatastha tradition AND in particular this list also includes  'my' 
guruji-s as well !! For that matter I myself dropped / took my guruji-s to 
various places in my car!! and Sri SSS also used to travel Bangalore to HN 
Pur & various other parts of Karnataka by bus, car etc. & very often he 
had been served delicious food by his devotees for the mAdhyAnhika 
bhiksha...  And I have made these observations ONLY after Sri Srikanta 
prabhuji expressed his concerns about swamiji-s travel in luxurious cars!! 
  Have I said anywhere that  only one particular traditional Acharya-s 
enjoying the life like this??  Just I was trying to convey the practical 
problem one would face while trying to adjudge the jnAni-s from their life 
style. and that's it..nothing more & nothing less than this....BUT it is 
quite amusing that these readers with their bigoted views always on their 
toes to jump and dance for each & every 'nothing special' observations.  I 
really pity them.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
