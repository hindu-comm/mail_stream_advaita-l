Even the thought 'I want it' should not be there in your mind.
That alone is true 'virakti' ".
'true mind control' is that state of mind, where you
do not even entertain the thought that you need something.

Hare Krishna

But it has been said somewhere in this list itself that jnAni would get 
'feelings' like kAmAdi and later on he will subdue / controls it through 
viveka/jnAna...Though subsequently it has been clarified (by another 
prabhuji of this list) that this would happens automatically without any 
effort, the jnAni's getting the feelings of kAma, krOdha were not 
denied...paramahamsa rAmakrishna's kAma feeling example has been given to 
prove this...But here above HH saying that true mind control is the state 
where there is no thought of this sort!! If Sri rAmakrishna paramahaMsa 
got  this kAma thought & wept in paNchavati & prayed mAta means either he 
was not kAya, vAcha, manasa virakta or he set an example to disciples  as 
how to overcome kAmAdi dOsha-s by the bhakta..But please note example 
given to prove that even jnAni-s also would entertain kAmAdi feelings. 

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
