Dear Srinivas Gadkari,
You have missed my point.Upasana can leadthe seeker only to the image with
which he worships.It will not lead him to "Nirguna Brahman".The seeker
will still remain with Dwaita bhava,The kenopanishad also declares,"nainam
yadidamupsate".The Brahman is not that which the seeker worships.Se
Shankara's commentary in the "Brahmasutra bhashya".No doubt for the
beginner,Upasana is the start of the knowledge of Ishwara.In the
Ishawasyopanishad Shankara discusses elaborately the place of
Upasana,which he calls "Vidya".Those who worships Vidya enter into Pitch
darkness,(andham tamah pravishanti yo vidyayam ratah)
                                                        N.Srikanta.
