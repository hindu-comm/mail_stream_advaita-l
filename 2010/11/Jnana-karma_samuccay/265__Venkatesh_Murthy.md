Namaste Sri Bhaskar

You take every Holyman is a Jnani. This is not true. Kashaya Vastra
Dharana will not automatically make someone a Jnani. If people are
duped by such false Sanyasis it is the Prarabdha of the people.

The Sampradaya of the so called Holyman is important. Nowadays we see
Holymen with no proper Sampradaya. They are not Jnanis they are false
Sanyasis. They are after money and luxury in life. True Jnani will not
act like that.
