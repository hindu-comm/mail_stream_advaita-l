Or perhaps in mocking the Acharyas like the present Sringeri Mahasannidhanam? At least the following is directly targeting them (November 23, 2010 from the same "poor taste" author):

"And with regard to luxurious life of swamiji's...I dont see any of our 
present day Acharya-s/ swamiji-s/ vedAnta guruji-s using their 'pAda-s' to 
travel from one place to another and preferring 'kuteera' to stay...They 
have always posh cars (their own and devotees as well :-))  at their 
disposal and have well furnished cottages to stay and sumptuous food for 
the 'bhiksha':-))  I dont think we can evaluate the level of jnAna they 
have from their life style...if we do that nobody would qualify:-))"
