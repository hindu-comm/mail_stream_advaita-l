If the holymen are doing for "Lokakalyana",it is good.But,now a days we
see swamijis building Empires,moving around in Luxurious cars and having
lot of wealth which in no way helping the poor.We also see many holymen
doing all sorts of gimmicks to hoodwink the people,fooling them robbing
them!

I reckon it is due to holymens' prArabdha karma they are indulging in 
these type of activities!!...As it has been decided that there is NO 
escape from prArabdha karma phala, each and every person has to act 
accordingly and this hard rule,  does not,  spare even paramArtha brahma 
jnAni!!  Due to his prArabdha janita dehendriya manObuddhi ahaMkAra, he 
may  'sometime' involve in 'questionable' activities by getting 'vipareeta 
pratyaya-s!! When the  brahma jnAni's  fate itself is like this then what 
to speak about 'holymen' ??  So, atleast with this excuse the holymen  can 
justify their activities. No pun intended here please, this is the theory 
which got acceptance from the 'official' flag holders of advaita.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
