Adi Shankara in his bhashyas is clear when he says,Jnana and karma cannot
be combined,because it is like light and darkness.Just like there cannot
be darkness when light comes,so also karma cannot exist when jnana
comes.There is no half darkness and half light.Only when the seeker
understands the futility of karma,he is qualifies for Jnana.There is no
"Ardha pravrtti"in karma or Jnana.The Mundaka sruthi also says this:

                  'Parikshya lokan karmacitan
                   nirvedamayat Brahmano nasti akrtam
                   krtena,tena vijnanartham sa Gurureva
                   abhigaccet Shrotriyam Brahmanishtam!!"

A Brahmana(seeker)must examine the worlds(lokan)he has gained,and must
realise
and leave what he is doing(nirveda-must realise actions will not bring him
merit)that what is done(krtena)cannot create the akrtam(higher gain-Brahma
jnana),in order to know that he only has to approach a Guru,who is a
Shrotriya(well versed in Vedas) and also firmly established in Brahman.

                                                         N.Srikanta.
