Shri Shrikanta,

I though I shall end the discussions with you but now you brought in Nirgranta Nathaputra. For your information he was a different person who died near Kushinagar (in present day UP) and Lord Mahavir died more than three hundred kilometers away in Pava near Nalanda in another state. He was not a jain and he is not one of the Tirthankars. He was probably an ajivika. The tenets of his teachings were not all same with the teachings of Lord Mahavira. As Nirgrantha nathaputra was a senior contemporary of Lord Buddha he lived in the 19th century BCE. One more of your misconception about Jainism is removed now. If you think that you are trying to show by hook or by crook that Buddhism copied from Jainism, that is even more heinous. 

As regards the Thevenin's theorem the author of that big book (he was not Indian and I do not remember his name now as I read it in 1963 (ie. some 47 years before now) did state "looking back" while defining that theorem. We had to do lot of exercises in the first week of studying that and also give a teston that at the end of the next wee, as that was the practice in the training schhol in those days. It could be possible that you know more than that author and I would not dispute that.

Sincerely,

Sunil K. Bhattacharjya

Dear sunil Bhattacharya,
Donot put words into your mouth unnecessarily.If you speak descending to
the personal level,I too would have to do that.So,confine your discussion
to the topic.I said that am not interested in history or the
chronology,because we cannot verify them.there is no ned to call other
list members.In the course of you discussion,you have also brought many
irrelevant and immaterial points for which I have not objected.I mentioned
Jainism only incidentally.there is no need to get workedup on that.For
your information,words like Pudgala,Dharmastikaya also occur in Jainism as
also Buddhism.the name Pudgala is used alternatively to nirmanakaya.I know
that jainism is "Nirgrantha".That makes it still older.In Ramayana also we
find mention of sramanas,Arhats and Vishnusahasranama
mentions,asrama,sramanah,shantah,.....But,we donot see the mention of
Buddha in Ramayana which is declared to be oldest text,nor even in
mahabharatha.

In your mention of Thevinin's theorem,it is not simply looking back,but
looking towards the source from the open terminals from where the load or
any resistor is removed,and removing the source and shorting the terminals
wher source was there,and calculating the Total resistance.Then including
which was removed and finding the Thevenin's resistance.The current
through the resistor which was removed is equal to the source voltage
divided by the total resistance.The voltage will be the product of the
current foundout and the resistance.
So,even in Thevenin's theorem there is a method.

Sincerely,                     N.Srikanta.
