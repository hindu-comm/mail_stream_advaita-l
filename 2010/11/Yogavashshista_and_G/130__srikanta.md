Dear sunil Bhattacharji,

In yogavashshta we find many slokas which we find in Gaudapada karikas.For
instance the following slokah is found it both the books:

Adavante ca yan nasti vartamanepi tattatha!
Vitathai sadrshah santah avitatha iva lakshitah!!
"That which doesnot exist in the beginning(past) and in the
end(future),doesnot exist in the present(vartamana) too.Being
unreal(vitatha) as it were,they being regarded(lakshitah) as if
real(avitatha)"
we see this slokha in both Yogavashishta and Gaudapada karikas.It is
dificult to place the dates of these books,or may be that it has been
taken from a original book.Prof.Atreya has written a theses on the
Yogavashishta,and in that it is his opinion and also some scholars that
Yogaashishta came later to Gaudapada Karikas.(Vide Prof.Atreya's book).
                                                             N.Srikanta.
