Namaste Sri Srikanta

What you say is the point I am making.   In case one son does not
continue the family tradition another son can do it. But there should
be sufficient choice of sons. With a low growth rate of population
there may not be sufficient choice for tradition to continue.

The ancient tradition of Vedas is endangered tradition.

Just like endangered species even endangered traditions should be
protected otherwise they will be lost.  A time may come when people
will not find a Samaveda Purohita to perform even Samskaras like
Upanayana.

Pranams to you for learning Samaveda and Advaita. Manu said gods are
pleased with Rgveda men with Yajurveda and Pitrus with Samaveda.  May
your Pitrus become pleased with you.

It is commendable you are continuing in footsteps of old Vidwans.

Regards

-Venkatesh
