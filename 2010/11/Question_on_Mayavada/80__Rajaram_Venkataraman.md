Dear Sri Devanathan, appreciate your noble effort to defend the truth. You
had stated "More particularly the controversial verses cited., are
completely absent in certain early Devanagari recensions while they are
retained in the Bengali recensions." Could you please provide more details
and the source of this study?

Also, I am curious to know why you argued against this stand by Kalavai
Venkat (outside this forum). You always insisted that these verses are not
interpolations but they do not refer to Sankara.
