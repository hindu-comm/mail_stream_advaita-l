Vidyasankar, Madhusudana Saraswati is talking about devotion to Hari
and being attracted to the superexcellent qualities Vishnu in the case
of a jivan mukta not just for an aspirant. The reading is crystal
clear in his introduction to gudartha dipika. If you think that my
understanding is not correct or that his position deviates from adi
sankara's, could you please provide reference?

As far as I know, there is no difference between jivan mukti and
videha. Hence, I'd think bhakti is never sublated but would like to
know what the traditional position is (with rf.)
In atma darshana, do you know I'm Vishnu? Does nirguna brahman know
saguna brahman and effects of maya?

Service (action) is one expression of devotion, which is inaction. One
may always love his wife but not always court her. So even logically,
one cannot equate karma and bhakti. Madhusudana differentiates these
two and don't know why you equate.
