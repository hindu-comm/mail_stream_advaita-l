Please try to understnd my statement. I said that the European scholar said that in his use of the term Brahmanirvana Lord Krishna borrowed the term Nirvana from Lord Buddha and that Lord Buddha was the first to use the word. I was trying to say what happens when one does not know the chronological perspective. You also thought that Jainism preceded Buddhism by a century. What proof do you have to say that jainism preceded Buddhism?

Again just assertions will not do. You have to tell in what way according to you the prajna of awareness in Buddhism is different from Prajna in Prajnanam Brahma. Mind that Buddha himself said that he did not invent anything. he was retelling what th earlier seers (obviously the Vedaic seers) told. 

It appears that you have not read my letters written in the group sometime ago. I have explained that when his Sankhya and yoga teachers taught him Sankhya and Yoga and he practised those disciplines he was not satisfied with the situation as to what happens to the Yogi after he gets liberated from prakriti. As his guru did not have the answer he meditated and found the answer. Initially he gave the Hinayana teachings, land later on he gave the higher Mahayana teachings. The aspirant finally reaches the shunyata and at that stages there is no separateness and there is only awareness.

Addendum:
Buddhism's "Nirvana" and Vedanta's "Brahma Nirvana" are different.In
Buddhism it is still "Dwaita"."Prajnanam Brahma"is different from Prajna
in Buddhism.
Infact scores of Books have been written by Adwaithic scholars on the
difference between the two.In Vedanta,the Brahma Nirvana,is "Tushnim
Bhava".
Sri Krishna says in Bhagawath Gita,"Esha Brahmisthitih Partha
nainam prapya vimuhyati!
Sthitva syamantakalepi Brahmanirvanamrchyati!!.

Buddha gives emphasis on Non-clinging.Infact, Vipassana meditation is said
to be originated from Buddha.The Madhayamaka or non-clinging to the two
extremes is emptiness or Shunyata.
Gaudapada in the last karika has explained that this state is without
plurality.He has also said that Buddha's view is nearer(samipyam uktam) to
what vedanta said.But,this has to be realised only from the vedanta.

"Kramate nahi Buddhasya Jnanam Dharmeshu tapinah!
sarve dharmah tatha jnanam ,"Naitad Buddhena Bhashitam"!!

Though Buddha said that the conciousness does not touch the
objects(dharmeshu tapinah) he did not say that the conciousness of the
other (dharmas or Atmas)beings also doesnot move towards the objects(sarve
dharmah tatha jnanam na kramate).This last was not said by Buddha.
Adi shankara in his commentary says that,though Buddha(Gautama) said that
the conciousness doenot move towards the objects,because Buddhist logic
denies the existence of external obnects(bahyartha nirakaranam matram
uktam).Idam tu(that is,the conciousness of all the beings or the Atmas are
also like wise doesnot touch the objects) was not said by Gautama
Buddha.This has to be realised only through the Vedanta or Sruthi.Idam tu
Vedanteshu eva avagantavyah.We have Anandagiri's tika also which supports
this.
