If said Padma Purana Sloka is genuine why  Ramanuja does not refer it
once in Sri Bhashya?  He wrote laghu Purvapaksha laghu Siddhanta, Maha
Purvapaksha of Advaita and Maha Siddhanta but no mention of Padma
Purana Sloka.He spends large amount of time and energy in Sri Bhashya
he should have mentioned it.

Conclusion - The Padma Purana Sloka is later added by miscreants.
