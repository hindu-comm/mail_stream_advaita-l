Shankara in his Brahmasutrabhashya says that after the realisation of
Jnana,a Jnani will continue to feel his body consiousness,like a shadow
that comes along with a person.The world will look like a burnt cloth to
him.After jivanmukthi he will continue to function till videhamukthi.The
Upanishad says,"Tavadeva chiram",till it lasts.
Bhava shankara Desika me sharanam.                   N.Srikanta.
