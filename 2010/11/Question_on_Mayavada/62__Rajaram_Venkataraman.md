"mayavadam asat sastram" describes two characteristics of advaitam:

   - total renounciation of actions (including that done with dualtistic
   bhakti)
   - oneness of jiva and paramatma

One can say that the verse is an interpolation but cannot say that there is
a misunderstanding about advaitam. Right?
