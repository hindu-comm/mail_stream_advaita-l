Addendum:
Buddhism's "Nirvana" and Vedanta's "Brahma Nirvana" are different.In
Buddhism it is still "Dwaita"."Prajnanam Brahma"is different from Prajna
in Buddhism.
Infact scores of Books have been written by Adwaithic scholars on the
difference between the two.In Vedanta,the Brahma Nirvana,is "Tushnim
Bhava".
Sri Krishna says in Bhagawath Gita,"Esha Brahmisthitih Partha
nainam prapya vimuhyati!
Sthitva syamantakalepi Brahmanirvanamrchyati!!.

Buddha gives emphasis on Non-clinging.Infact, Vipassana meditation is said
to be originated from Buddha.The Madhayamaka or non-clinging to the two
extremes is emptiness or Shunyata.
Gaudapada in the last karika has explained that this state is without
plurality.He has also said that Buddha's view is nearer(samipyam uktam) to
what vedanta said.But,this has to be realised only from the vedanta.

"Kramate nahi Buddhasya Jnanam Dharmeshu tapinah!
sarve dharmah tatha jnanam ,"Naitad Buddhena Bhashitam"!!

Though Buddha said that the conciousness does not touch the
objects(dharmeshu tapinah) he did not say that the conciousness of the
other (dharmas or Atmas)beings also doesnot move towards the objects(sarve
dharmah tatha jnanam na kramate).This last was not said by Buddha.
Adi shankara in his commentary says that,though Buddha(Gautama) said that
the conciousness doenot move towards the objects,because Buddhist logic
denies the existence of external obnects(bahyartha nirakaranam matram
uktam).Idam tu(that is,the conciousness of all the beings or the Atmas are
also like wise doesnot touch the objects) was not said by Gautama
Buddha.This has to be realised only through the Vedanta or Sruthi.Idam tu
Vedanteshu eva avagantavyah.We have Anandagiri's tika also which supports
this.
