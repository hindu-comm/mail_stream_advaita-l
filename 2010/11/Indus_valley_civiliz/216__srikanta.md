Sri.Gopal,
It is not my intention to juxtapose Peter Della Santina,here.what I would
wish to say is that for every theory of history,there is a counter
theory.Indus valley civilization itself is not conclusively decided and
the symbols deciphered.Iravatham has done some work in this.I am not
supporting Santina,,as you have misunderstood.Right?
