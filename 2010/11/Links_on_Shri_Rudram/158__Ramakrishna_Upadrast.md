Namaste,

Telugu speaking students of Veda could find the following link useful
for reading this Karthika Masa. Briefly, the link contains a
translation of Sayanacharya, Bhatta Bhaskara and Vishnu Suri.
http://www-roc.inria.fr/~upadrast/Veda/Rudram_Commentary_Telugu/

In some places, the above author has given explanations not found in
the excellent English translation by Swami Amritananda (of RK-Math).

Sanskrit reading students of Veda can benefit from the commentary of
Sayanacharya in Sanskrit, taken from an online location.
