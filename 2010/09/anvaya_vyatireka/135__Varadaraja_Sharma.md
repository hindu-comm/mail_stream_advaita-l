I wanted to know about anvaya vyatireka logic. and here,in the post, Jnani's feeling of physical pain, the facts were explained with anvaya vyatireka logic.  I was not able to grasp the purport. could you please explain the logic per se and if I am not asking more could you please explain the same with another example

Radhe Krishna
