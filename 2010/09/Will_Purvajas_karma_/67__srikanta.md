Namaste
With reference to the discusion on the above topic,the Purvalas karma does
affect his progenies,because the person identifies as such and such one's
son and born in such and such lineage.Een the West believes that "The sins
of the parents visit upon their children".There is a saying to that effect
in Tamil.But if one frees himself from the Upadhis through the Vedantic
method of Vichara Marga,,then he cannot be affected by them.The subject
matter belongs to the Purva Mimamsa of Karmakanda and not to the uttara
kanda which is Vedanta.Hence this question is not raised in the
Vedanta.There are also statements in the Upanishads.For instance the
Mudaka sruthi states:Bhidyate hrdaya granthih,Chidyante sarva
samsayah,Kshiyante asya karmani,tasmin drastre paravare!etc.
Glory to Acharya Shankara Bhagavatpada!
