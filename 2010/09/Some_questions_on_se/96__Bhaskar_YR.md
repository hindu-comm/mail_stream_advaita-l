J.Krishnamurthy in his talks would say,"To be aware of
oneself,without choice,to live in the world fully without division,doing
all the works of his daily life(like going to the office or whatever
ones's occupation is)is intelligence.If one has such Intelligence,for him
the Upanishads say:"Naiva tasya krtenarthah".He lives as a "pratibuddha"in
this very life in the world.Sanatkumara is one such example.

Hare Krishna

These are all soothing words for us, gruhasthAshrami-s, is it not?? :-)) 
To our comfort, we have now justification to stay in saMsAra...But I am 
wondering where does the importance & mandatory requirement of  Ashrama 
saMnyAsa fits in this scheme?? And shankara's insistence that for the 
mumukshu pArivrAjyaM is kartavyaM??

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
