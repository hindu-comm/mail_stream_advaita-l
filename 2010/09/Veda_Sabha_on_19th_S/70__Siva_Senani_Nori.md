Dear List members

I amhappy to inform you the details of the 6th Bhagyanagar Veda Sabha to be 
held at Sankara Matham, Nallakunta, Hyderabad on 19th September 2010, Sunday 
from 8:00 am to 7:00 pm.

The Veda Sabha follows the pariksha paddhati wherein the President and 
Vice-president of the meeting start at some arbitrary point in theKrishna Yajur 
Veda and the assembled scholars recite the Veda from that point on. There are 
seven rounds for the Samhita part, one (before lunch) for the Upanishad part, 
and three for the Aranyaka part. About forty Vedic scholars well versed in 
Ghana- and/or Krama- paThana assemble and recite the Veda in pairs. Lunch is 
served between 1:00 and 2:30 pm. Sambhaavana and aaSeervacanam start at around 
6:00 pm.

All are welcome. No fees or any other obligations. No chairs are provided as the 
Vedic scholars- including one GhanaapaaThin who uses crutches- sit on the 
floor.
