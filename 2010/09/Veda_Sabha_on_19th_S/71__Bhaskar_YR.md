I am happy to inform you the details of the 6th Bhagyanagar Veda Sabha to 
be 
held at Sankara Matham, Nallakunta, Hyderabad 

praNAms Respected Sri Siva Senani Nori prabhuji
Hare Krishna

Thanks a lot for the information...I think ghana type recitation is 
possible only in  saMhitaa portion ..I think they would recite AraNyaka & 
upanishad maNtra-s in mUla... I've seen those CD-s, it is really good 
prabhuji.  But IMHO  the speed of recitation is bit high due to that 
saNdhi vAkya-s, alpa prANa, mahA prANa-s  are not clearly audible 
...thanks again for your kind help prabhuji.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
