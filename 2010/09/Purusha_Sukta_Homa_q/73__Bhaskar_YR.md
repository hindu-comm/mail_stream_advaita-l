I witnessed one Purusha Sukta Homa by Srivaishnava priests.Why they
say after every mantra the Narayana Ashtakshara and Svaha? Is this the
correct way?

Hare Krishna

Sometimes in saMkalpa & anvAdAna, we say : nArAyaNa ashtAkshari 
saMputeekarana pUrvaka purusha sUkta hOmam karishye...in those cases we do 
this samputeekaraNa to purusha sUkta maNtra-s...In nava chandi hOma also, 
sometimes,  we do this type of samputeekaraNa with 'Om namaH 
chandikAyai'..Again it all depends on saMkalpa how you do before the 
hOma....

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
