Dear Bhaskarji,

The only way one can repay the pitri-rhina is by begetting children and looking after them and not merely by performing Shraaddha. Shraaddha is notan act of worship of the ancestors but is an act by which we express our gratitude to our ancestors for making it possible for us to have this birth.Lord Krishna says in the Bhagavad Gita thatone should worship the Lord alone. Only those people with demoniac character worship the Bhootas (the spirits of the dead ones) and they go to the Bhoota-yoni after death. Your comment is welcome.

Regards,

Sunil K. Bhattacharjya

We have no way of knowing for sure but we have hope that if the pitrs are 
in a condition to receive it, they will be pleased by our offerings.

Thanks for your kind clarification...There is no guarantee whether our 
pita, pitamaha & prapitamaha waiting there in pitru lOka to receive our 
offerings without any punarjanma !! Yes, it is only through our shraddha 
& obligation of ruNa parihAra (pitru ruNa) we are observing these 'pitru 
kAya-s', in a way it is better to say we are following these injunctions 
not to factually pacify our pitru-s, it is a kArmic observation on our 
part to be a 'ruNa mukta'..I think this is what you have explained well in 
your mail 'shrAddha' some 7-8 years back !!

Your humble servant
Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
