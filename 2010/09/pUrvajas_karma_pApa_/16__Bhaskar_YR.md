The book what we follow in our saMpradAya is 'sateeka vrata ratna mAla' 
which does not mention anything about the description of woodcutter...In 
second adhyAya it simply mentions 'kAshTa grAhi' who came to brAhmaNa's 
house, see the vrata & did it himself.  Ofcourse, the 'sateeka' 
specifically mentions that this vrata kata is in skAnda purANa, reva 
khanda and it has been directly narrated by SrimannArAyaNa to nArada 
maharshi...

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
