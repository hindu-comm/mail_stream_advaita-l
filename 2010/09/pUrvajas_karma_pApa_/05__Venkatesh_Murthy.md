In Sathyanarayana Puja Katha the Sadhu Vaisya did not do Puja even
after daughter got married. This made Sathyanarayana angry.  He cursed
Vaisya and his family. His family suffered very much. Afterwards he
prays to Sathyanarayana he gets wealth and family is happy. But when
king Angadhvaja rejected Sathyanarayana Prasada he destroyed all his
sons and wealth. Again the king did Puja  got back sons and wealth.

The Purana have lot of stories Papa of someone will punish him and his
family.  Why should we see Vedanta to explain this?
