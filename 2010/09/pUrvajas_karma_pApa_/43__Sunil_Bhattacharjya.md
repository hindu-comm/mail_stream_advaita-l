The following two stories tackle this situation in unique ways:

A person who was suffering went to a saint for a remedy. The saint told him that his sufferings were due to his past karma and hewould have to suffer it out. The depressed man went to commit suicide in the river but before he could commit the act another saint stopped him and told him that prayer to the Lord would alleviate his sufferings.

There was another person in a similar situation but before he could commit suicide an astrologer happened to stop him and advise him not to commit the act as he would be suffering for two years only. The surprised man asked the astrologer whether his sufferings would be over after two years and to that the astrologer replied that after two years of suffering he would get used to it.

On a lighter note, Bhaskar, the above are strange words coming from you!

On a serious note, please note that when the texts say "prArabdha", they
are sometimes talking of prArabhdha karma-phala and at other times of
Arabdha karmA. The current body is part of the phala of prArabdha karma.
When it is said "bhogAd eva kshayaH" (extinction through experience), the
bhoga - experience - refers to the phala, not to the prior done karmA per se.
