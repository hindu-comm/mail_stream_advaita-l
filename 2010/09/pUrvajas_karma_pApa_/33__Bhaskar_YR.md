That is probably the reason why 21 generations are uplifted when a true 
sanyasi is born in a family or the whole 
pitrus fall down when one does not perform his karma.

praNAms 
Hare Krishna

The above reminds me the mundaka assurance :  whoever knows that supreme 
brahman indeed becomes that very brahman..In his family, no one is born 
who knows not brahman ( sa yO ha vai tatparaM brahma veda brahmaiva 
bhavati, nAsya brahmavitkule bhavati etc.) Even ONLY one brahma jnAni in a 
family is enough to make his family generation enlightened!!  All these 
days I was thinking this is an acclamation (arthavAda) to 
brahmavidya...But now after reading transfer of anccestor's karma phala, I 
think we should read 'more' into it & think about transfer of jnAna phala 
also!!  and it also gives me a mischevous feeling that sofar in my family 
no one is enlightened coz. I've yet to know that brahman :-))

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
