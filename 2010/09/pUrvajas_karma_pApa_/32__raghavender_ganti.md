Sri Gurubhyon Namaha
 The concept of ones descendents enjoying or 
sufferings because ofancestors karma is because of the fact that , without any 
runa no one is related to anyone else, i am born to my father because i am 
indebted to him or his ancestors in some way or the other, my runa does not just 
end there, probably that runa is so great that i cannot just end itinthis 
birth, so in order to expediate my ending of the runa i will suffer or enjoy the 
karma done by them to some extent. That is probably the reason why 21 
generations are uplifted when a true sanyasi is born in a family or the whole 
pitrus fall down when one does not perform his karma.


Sri Kamakshi
Raghav

Put it this way: it is attachment that makes the childs karma affect the 
parent. Karma depends on the concept of aham and aham ("I") is an 
individual pronoun. But is "I" strictly housed in one body? Even in the 
most secularized atheistic segments of society most people do not live 
only for themselves.

We have no way of knowing for sure but we have hope that if the pitrs are 
in a condition to receive it, they will be pleased by our offerings. It's 
like we save money for a childs education, marriage etc. even though we do 
not know if e.g. the child will be a dunce who does not go to college etc.

Because one has the power to end its effect by e.g. bali.
