Some of the Prarabddha sufferings may be unbearable to the common man as well as to the elevated people. But as the spiritually elevated people do not live in the Deha-bhaava they may be able to overcome the pains easily.

Regards,

Dear Bhaskar,

Quoting the incident I had mentioned in my previous response: "All of a
sudden a disciple accidentally touched only the fringe of the thin bandage
that was covering Bhagavan's tumour. Bhagavan GAVE AN INVOLUNTARY START. The
disciple felt bewildered and mumbled, “Bhagavan, did I hurt you? It was only
the fringe of the bandage that my hand touched.” Bhagavan smiled his benign
smile and softly said, “YOU DO NOT KNOW THE ENORMOUS WEIGHT AS OF A MOUNTAIN
THAT THIS FRINGE BEARS!” That chance exclamation of Bhagavan indicated the
severity of his pain. But his godly face did not bear the slightest sign of
his agony. It reflected only joy and peace. He seemed to have switched off
his mind from the body to the divine."

Theoretical explanations given by you are very good. But in vyavagarika
plain, i would quote the above incident. These topics cannot be explained
and analyzed as it is beyond the experience of BMI. The only way to know is
to truly abide in Self at all times and experience it. I agree we can stop
the discussion right here.
