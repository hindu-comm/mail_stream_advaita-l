namaste,

The first prayer to lord krishhNa in shriimad-bhaagavad-purANa in the
10th skandha by the devas, when He was in the womb of devaki has a
beautiful use of satya.

10.2.26

satyavrataM satyaparaM trisatyaM
satyasya yoniM nihitaM cha satye
satyasya satyamR^itasatyanetraM
satyAtmakaM tvAM sharaNaM prapannAH

Swami Tattvavidananda-ji makes a connection between the use of this
word satya in the above shloka, and the satyaM-paraM-dhiimahi of the
janmAdyasya-yato... (1.1.1) of shriimad-bhaagavaraM.  He also mentions
that the annavaraM temple has the inscription of this shloka.

Note: Obviously, most of the talk does not go too much into the
historical aspects of the vrata, but into the philosophical
explanations of the above shlokas.
