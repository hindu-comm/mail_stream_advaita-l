On a lighter note, Bhaskar, the above are strange words coming from you!

On a serious note, please note that when the texts say "prArabdha", they
are sometimes talking of prArabhdha karma-phala and at other times of
Arabdha karmA. The current body is part of the phala of prArabdha karma.
When it is said "bhogAd eva kshayaH" (extinction through experience), the
bhoga - experience - refers to the phala, not to the prior done karmA per se.
