Dear Bhaskarji,

You have also to remember that generally one takes birth in the same family. The person who was doing the Ashlesha-bali for khandana of the past karma of his ancestor may not be aware that the ancestor could have been he himself in his earlier birth.

Regards,

Sunil K. Bhattacharjya

Hare Krishna

Last week I have attended an 'ashlesha bali' and sarpa saMskAra ritual as 
a Ritvik. After pooja & hOma, during AshirvachanaM, pradhAna AchArya has 
told the katru that due to pApa karma done by his pUrvaja-s (ancestors) he 
& his family were suffering from nAga dOsha, now, after performing all 
these prAyaschitta karma-s (bali, saMskAra etc.) these sins have been 
cleared. I asked that Acharya (ofcourse, after getting my saMbhAvane :-)) 
how can it be?? why he has to suffer without fault of his own?? why that 
sarpa reprimand this poor katru & his family when he is noway related to 
his purvaja-s pApa kArya...IOW, how can one jeeva's karma phala can affect 
the other jeeva-s & made him/them to suffer..does it not lead to 'akruta 
abhyAgama'?? which shankara negates in sUtra bhAshya?? Since pradhAna 
Acharya was not a vedAnti, he could not clarify my doubt...Hence I am 
asking this doubt in this list ...Please clarify.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
