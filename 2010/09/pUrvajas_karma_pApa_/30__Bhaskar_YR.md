Grahas are in fact Janardana. "Graharoopi Janaardana"

praNAms
Hare Krishna

The Kannada saint purandara dAsa sings beautifully : sakala graha bala 
neene saraseejAksha'...ravi chandra budha neene raahu ketuvu  neene, kavi, 
guru shaniyu, mangaLanu neene...dina raatriyu neene...etc...O lotus eyed 
lord, you are the power of 'sakala' graha (ravi, chandra, kuja, budha guru 
etc.) and you are the day, you are the night etc...But what we are doing 
in satyanArAyaNa pooja is treating him as a supreme god and all other 
devata-s are his staff...

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
