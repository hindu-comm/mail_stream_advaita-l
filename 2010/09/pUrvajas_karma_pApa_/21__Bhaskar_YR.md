What I was really looking for is historical evidence.  Just like Dr. Kane 
gives a specific reference to Peshwa's in Maharashtra.

> Oh!! sorry, then I am not aware of any info. about the historical 
background of satyanArAyaNa pooja in South India.

Also does any one have any thoughts why the name Satya AND NaaraayayaNa 
used here?

>  Yes, nArAyaNa himself satya why again 'satya' prefix to nArAyaNa?? 
Perhaps it is to state that satyasya satya is satya nArAyaNa or satya 
nArAyana is one of the forms of mahA nArAyana, like various types of 
vishNu...Or on a lighter note, it is just like saying : women's maternity 
home (in Kannada 'hengasara herige aaspatre :-))

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
