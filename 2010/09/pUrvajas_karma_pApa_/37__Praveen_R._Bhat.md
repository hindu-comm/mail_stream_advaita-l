Hari OM, Bhaskar ji,

I don't have Bhagavatpada's bhashya reference for this, but for similar
reason that it is said that the j~nAni's sa~Ncita puNya accrues to those who
praise him and his sa~Ncita pApa accrues to those who criticize him. Why is
one jIva related with other's sa~Ncita here too? AFAIK, the jIva's birth in
a particular family is his purva janma saMskAra and vAsana and it includes
the relation with the those jIva-s he would relate in his prArabdha that
gave this janma. That prArabdha itself includes his own ill-doings that bind
him to his ancestor's pApa karma, though they are not his direct doings. He
relates to them in his deha bhAva due to that very prArabdha of his, not
someone else's. That binding is also responsible for his offering piNDa.

The things are not as clearly visible to us, being adRRiShTa, and thus we
should take it on shraddhA, shouldn't we? :)

praNAm,
--Praveen R. Bhat
