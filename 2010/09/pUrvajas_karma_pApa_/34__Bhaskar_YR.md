We have no way of knowing for sure but we have hope that if the pitrs are 
in a condition to receive it, they will be pleased by our offerings.

Thanks for your kind clarification...There is no guarantee whether our 
pita, pitamaha & prapitamaha waiting there in pitru lOka to receive our 
offerings without any punarjanma !!  Yes, it is only through our shraddha 
& obligation of ruNa parihAra (pitru ruNa)  we are observing these 'pitru 
kAya-s', in a way it is better to say we are following these injunctions 
not to factually pacify our pitru-s, it is a kArmic observation  on our 
part to be a 'ruNa mukta'..I think this is what you have explained well in 
your mail 'shrAddha' some 7-8 years back !!

Your humble servant
Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
