I am from Tamil Nadu and had never heard of Satyanarayana Puja till I came
to the US. Admittedly, my knowledge was restricted to to Tamil Smaartas -
may be even restrcited to certain geographical locations of Tamil Nadu.
After coming here I have noticed that a number of Tamil families among the
diaspora have also adopted this. It seems to be a "family" thing
mainly among Telugu smaartas.
