Duryodhana's Papa made the whole Kaurava family suffer. If he gave
Pandavas the land no Kaurava would have got killed because they would
have not fought a war. One Jeeva can do such a big Papa other Jeeva-s
around it can suffer the results. Many examples we see of this.A bad
son's Papa can make his parents and friends suffer.

If Purana is not against Vedanta we should accept it. Does Vedanta
says one Jeeva's karma cannot make another Jeeva the Bhokta also? If
other Jeeva-s are the Bhokta and Papa Karta Jeeva is not Bhokta this
is wrong because it is against law of Karma.But Purana never says it.
In Sathyanarayana Vrata Katha the Sadhu Vaisya suffers with his
family.
