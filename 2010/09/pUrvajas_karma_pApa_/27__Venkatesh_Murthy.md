We should do Satyanarayana Puja on Paurnami or Sankranti day  Ekadashi
is fasting day. A Udyapana is after 4 years.  Better than food the
Prasada is very delicious.

Avahana of Satyanarayana is in Kalasha only.Purusha Sukta is main
mantra. Even Shodasopachara can be done with Purusha Sukta mantras.
They only keep a photo of Satyanarayana. Why do you do Navagraha Puja
here?

Regards,

-Venkatesh
