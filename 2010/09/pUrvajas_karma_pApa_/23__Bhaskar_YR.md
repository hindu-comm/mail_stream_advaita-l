Dear Bhaskarji,

It seems there is an anecdote in Bengal linking the worship of 
Satyanaaraayana to one Satya-pir, a Muslim saint. It could be that 
Satya-pir worshipped Lord Narayana in a particular way, say by using one 
and quarter measure of the the offered items in the Naivedya.

praNAms Sri Sunil prabhuji
Hare Krishna

Thanks for sharing this interesting additional information..Infact I 
didnot know that even in Bengal people would observe  this vrata!!

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
