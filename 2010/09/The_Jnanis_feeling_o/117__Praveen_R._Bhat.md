Of course, I meant dehAdi when I said body... and when prArabdha
affects it, it may generate whatever feelings its due to generate, but
the j~nAni abiding in brahmabhAva may not have
anything to do with it. This is not the same as saying that aj~nAnis
have superimposed those rAgAdi on the j~nAni.

This is what I have trouble understanding. The subduing of it need not
be an active involvement the way this statement makes it appear. Its
the same prArabdha that subdues it. The forest fires
need not necessarily spread, it may just be a spark that dies off on its own.

And this suppression time again depends on his prArabdha janita

Which really means its not really with active participation, doesn't it?

So, according to some perception, even jnAni gets the whip

I don't seem to understand *uses* j~nAna, but it gets subdued based on
prArabdha sounds well, because whatever level of citta shuddhi was
achieved prior to j~nAna with active involvement, the vestige
remaining vAsanas would drop on their own in time, without active
involvement.

But what happens between the interval (i.e.after getting

Again, what happens getting the feeling and before subduing it is the
same prArabdha that subdues it too.

But saying that the BMI which was earlier associated with prArabdha,
continues to have prArabdha does not at all mean that BMI is
attributed to Atma. And if it is a superimposition by aj~nAnis
on the j~nAni, then it was so earlier to rise of j~nAna too. Why
should this be a differentiating factor at all? What aj~nAnis see in a
jivanmukta BMI wouldn't have changed of any volition of the
ajnAnis. It cannot at all be a differentiating factor for the BMI that
existed earlier and exists now. Nor has what made the BMI live on
prior to j~nAna changed post j~nAna per se. The only thing
that has changed, in my humble understanding, is that the false claim
on BMI's doership by the mithyAtma.

It is indeed something special for aj~nAnis. It is an instrument that
facilitated the fructification of j~nAna. And so, traditionally, we
worship the samAdhi of j~nAnis, don't we?

But that we do to all worship, how else can offerings be made without
a channel? :)
