If action pre-suppose agent; while agentship is dismissed(or accepted only 

as) superimposition, how can any reality be brought for action. How will 
the 
argument only agentship is superimposed not action hold water.

Again, this is good observation...na hi Atma svarUpAdhikame sati punaH 
pramANa pramEya vyavahAraH saMbhavati, pramAtrutvaM hi AtmanO navartayati 
antyaM pramANam..As you rightly pointed out without identifying himself as 
pramAtru, deha, Indriya etc. he cannot perform or execute  the socalled 
actions..This shankara makes very clear in adhyAsa bhAshya itself : 
dehendriyAdishu ahamabhimAna rahitasya pramAtrutvAnupapattau 
pramANapravruttyanupapatteH, na hi indriyANi anupAdAya pratyakshAdi 
vyavahAraH saMbhavati, na cha adhishTAnamantareNa indriyANAm vyavahAraH 
saMbhavati...From all these bhAshya vAkya-s it is fact beyond any doubt 
that in Atman there is NO vyavahAra NOT ONLY pramAtrutva...If someone says 
that he is not pramAtru, he is neither katru nor bhOktru but he has body, 
krOdha & kAma in the form of avidyAlesha &  engages himself in action (and 
sometimes 'questionable' actions also!!) etc. then it is clear that these 
are all  self contradictory statements & siddhAnta viruddha. 

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
