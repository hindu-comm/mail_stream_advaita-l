Although there may be no vAsanAs of j~nAni to brush against the Atma,
in what position is the aj~nAni in, with his vAsanas, to smell the
fragrance emanating? Out of aj~nAni's volition, nothing in the j~nAni
has changed. It has changed due to something that happened at the
j~nAni's earlier BMI, that was as much an insufferable stink to
aj~nAni as his own, which somehow now continues to emanate the
fragrance.

Whose upAdhi is it that becomes fragrant now? Nothing in the aj~nAni
changed, except his adoration.

Thanks for the Vivekachudamani references. In Bhavan's publication, I
see these as 274 and 275.
