Inaction is not reached by not doing work. Mere renunciation and giving up work does not liberate a person. .A wise person works as one must but he or she does it without desire for the fruit of action. Work is not needed after one attains wisdom yet one continues to work. (The Lord Himself works though he is not needed to.) That person sees action in inaction and inaction in action and he or she delights only in the Self.

Sunil K. Bhattacharjya

This is a new line of argument but seems strange.

pravrtti-nivrittyoH kartru tantratvAt ... sarvaH eva kriyA-kAraka-Adi-vyavahAraH avidyAbhUmau eva.

Since engagement and non-engagement (in action) depend on an agent, therefore.......all dealings involving an act, accessories, etc. exist certainly on the plane of ignorance**, only as long as one has not attained to the Reality.

** Both engagement and non-engagement presuppose agentship and an act of some kind. This however, holds good on the plane of ignorance, but not on that of Self-realisation.

(BGB 4.18 translated by Sw. Gambhiranandaji. ## footnote. )

If action pre-suppose agent; while agentship is dismissed(or accepted only as) superimposition, how can any reality be brought for action. How will the argument only agentship is superimposed not action hold water.

In Shri Guru Smriti,
