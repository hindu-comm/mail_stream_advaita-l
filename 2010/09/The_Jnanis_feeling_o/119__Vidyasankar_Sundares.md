The point, Sri Pranipataji, is that the lepana of knowledge pertains to 
the citta and manas embodying the jnAnI and the sugandha also originates
from the citta and manas of the jnAnI. 

The ajnAnI has neither the knowledge with which to rub off the laukika
vAsanas nor the ability to produce a sugandha and then attribute it to
the jnAnI.
