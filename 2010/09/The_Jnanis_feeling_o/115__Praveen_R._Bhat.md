Hari OM.  praNAms,

I understand both the views and know where they are coming from
thankfully for these debates on both the advaita-l & advaitin lists
across the years. :)

On saying that the j~nAni's body has prArabdha and not the j~nAni
himself , it has been argued that its so even for an aj~nAni, the AtmA
being unaffected always. Other way round, whether j~nAni has a BMI, it
is argued that its superimposed on the AtmA by the a~jnAni. But the
point somehow seems missing here is that the same case is true before
the rise of j~nAna; or in other words, for an a~jnAni! That the body
has prArabdha and not AtmA/ j~nAni, as well as, the body is
superimposed on the AtmA/ j~nAni are equally true in case of j~nAni or
a~jnAni.

If the j~nAni has no association *whatsoever* with his BMI and is
equally associated with all bodies, what is it that makes the
jivanmuktA's body special? Why worship him and not others? If that is
also a superimposition by the a~jnAni, why is his superimposition of
the j~nAni's body on AtmA any more worthy of that other
superimposition of a~jnAni's bodies on AtmA?
