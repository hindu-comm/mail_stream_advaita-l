I can dream of Shankara bhagavat paada coming into my dream and writing 
bhaashyaas in my dream without I ever studying those bhaashyaas â€“I am 
indeed blessed. I wished that can be true. Unfortunately I cannot dream 
what I do not know.  I have to make effort to study those bhaashyaas 
written by Shankara for me to know.

If I hear a  ferocious  roaring of the tiger in a dream that  wakes me to 
the relative reality of waking, do I have to hold the 'tiger roaring' is 
real forever in 'waking' world also??  atra veda, aveda shruti vAkhya is 
not there simply....shankara does not say simply 'sarva vaidika, loukika 
vyavahAra' are in avidyA kshetra, if the  shankara in dream not coming to 
our rescue & wakes us up to the 'REAL'

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
