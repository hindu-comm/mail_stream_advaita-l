It is easy to use words and not mean anything by them.

Define what is meant by Atyantika abhAva of vyavahAra and how that
impacts the life of a jnAnI for the rest of his natural life. In particular,
explicate how your atyanta abhAva of vyavahAra is different from what
others call nirvikalpaka samAdhi. How can you hold that there is atyanta
abhAva of vyavahAra on the one hand and argue against nirvikalpa
samAdhi on the other, if you do not see a difference between the two?
I do not see a difference, nor do a large number of others, so do 
expand upon what you understand by these terms.

Without involving in pramAtR-pramANa-prameya vyavahAra, how can
a jnAnI write commentaries, teach disciples, give lectures, or travel
from one place to another? Magic?
