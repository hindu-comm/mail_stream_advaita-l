Hari Om Shri Praveenji, Pranaams!

Though Atman is same substratum on which BMI of all are superimposed, the 
laukika-vAsanas in the mind which creates insufferable stink which when 
rubbed with knowledge start emanating the fragrance of the supreme Self.

This idea is brought out by AcAryaji in verses 273 & 274 of Vivekacudamani.

It is the upAdhi which stinks or fragrant and no wonder sweet smelling is 
adored.
