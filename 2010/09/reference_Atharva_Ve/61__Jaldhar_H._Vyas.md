There are very few Atharvavedis left these days.  Usually when it is 
studied it is as a second Veda by those who belong to a different Shakha.

The many of the texts do survive and it may be possible to discover the 
exact rks you're refering to but even without delving deeper this
  translation sounds really horrible and probably has no relation to what 
the AV might actually say.
