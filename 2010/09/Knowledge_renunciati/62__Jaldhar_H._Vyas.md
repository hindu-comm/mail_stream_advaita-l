I agree with the substance of what you wrote, but with just one caveat. 
While you do find some negative comments about the world in the shastras, 
they on the whole do give the world higher status than just garbage.

Perhaps a better analogy is to toys?  As a child you are obsessed with 
toys and as you become more mature you leave them behind.  But you do not 
hate them.  You may even buy them for your children even though you have 
no use for them yourself.  In such a way, a sannyasi has no need for the 
fleeting, perishable things of the world.  As Ishopanishad 1, says, mA 
grdha kaschasviddhanaM "Do not covet, for whose is wealth?"  If one can 
meditate successfully on this question "whose is wealth?" vairagya becomes 
natural.

Nevertheless when the individual asks it, there should be an answer no?
