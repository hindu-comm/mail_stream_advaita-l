Yes this is a good summation of the Advaita position.

No to the first because that is a social situation which dharmashastras 
have complete authority over and they are clear on the prohibition of 
this.  (Nevertheless, I would also add it is best if sannyasis of all 
kinds are not put into the position of accepting such things from 
grhasthas.  Nowadays they are treated as decorations to every trivial 
function or cultural program when their mission is actually to detach 
themselves from society.)

To the second, why not?  Dana especially annadana gives punya whenever it 
is given.  If someone is in need and you can give it then you should in my 
opinion.

No as noted above.
