Victory belongs to Lord Gajanana, as the wind of His ears blows reddish
sindUra powder from
His body, reddening the sky and making twilight at the wrong time of the
day.


I came across this beautiful shloka in the book "A Rapid Sanskrit Method" by
George L. Hart.
For some reason, it makes me very happy every time I think of it. :) I've
been unable to find
the source of the shloka. Does anyone know where is it from?

Happy Ganesha chaturthi.

praNAm,
