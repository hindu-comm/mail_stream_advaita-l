Pranams.
This is with reference to the discussion on the above
topic.Sri.Satyanarayana vrata is observed in many parts of India,and now
also abroad.In India we see it prominently observed in Andhra
pradesh,Karnataka,but most prominently in the Telugu region.In his
Keerthana ,Sri.Satyanarayanam Upasmahe in the raga,Shubha
pantuvarali,Mutthuswamy Deekshithar says,"Vaishya jati karanam,vatu vesha
dharinam",we  see the observance of this vrata with austerities among the
merchent class,for He is the giver of wealth.
                                                         N.Srikanta.
