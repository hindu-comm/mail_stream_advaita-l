should read:

[4] In shruti the Devas are equated with the senses.  See the bhashya on 
Ishopanishad 4 for example.  Just as a lord gets taxes etc. from his 
subjects and in turn pays them to his king, just as the Devas have their 
worshippers and in turn worship Ishwara, the senses receive perceptions 
and they are transmitted by the nerves to the brain.  But the mind 
(mAnasa) itself has the capability to understand due to Brahman.
