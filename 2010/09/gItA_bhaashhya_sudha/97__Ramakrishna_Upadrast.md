##The competence for the knowledge of the nature of God is only his
who has become detached from the world; not of any other.##

##It is eva: verily aMshaH, a part, portion, limb, fragment -- these
are all synonymous; mama, of mine, of the supreme Self; which
jiiva-bhuutaH sanaatanaH becoming the eternal individual soul, well
known as the enjoyer and the agent; jiiva-loke, in the region of
living beings, i.e., in the world --

As the sun (reflected) in water is a part of the (actual) sun, and
goes to the sun itself and does not return when the water, the cause
of the reflection, is removed, so also even this part becomes
similarly united with that very Self; of, as space enclosed in a pot.,
etc, delimited by such adjuncts as the pot etc. being a part of Space
does not return after being united with Space when the cause (of
limitation), viz pot etc. is destroyed. This being so, it has been
rightly stated, 'by reaching which they do not return'
