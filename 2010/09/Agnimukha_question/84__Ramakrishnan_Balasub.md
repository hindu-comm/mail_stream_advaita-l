In the aapastambiiya-prayoga-granthas it is said:

praacii.h puurvam-udaks~mstha.m dak.si.naarambham-aalikhet |
athodiicii.h puurass~mstha.m pa"scimaarambham-aalikhet |

i.e.,

Starting West ending east 3 lines: start at south, middle and then north.
Starting South ending north 3 lines: start at west, middle and then east.

Again, this is the tradition in the tamil-aapastamba tradition. It may be
slightly different in other regions/sUtras. This procedure is not to be
found in the sUtras themselves, it is found only in other prayoga manuals.
