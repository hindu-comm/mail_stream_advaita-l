Thank you for this information.  One more question How to draw lines
in Homa Kunda? Is it one south to north line and five west to east
lines OR three south north lines and three west east lines.

praNAms Sri Venkatesh prabhuji
Hare Krishna

The above procedure observed in Rigvedeeya AshvalAyana agnimukha 
prayOga...in Apasthambheeya agnimukha it is different...with 'shakala' on 
the rice flour (tandula pishta) spread in square shape in hOma 
kunda...starting from south from west to east we draw three lines & 
starting from west from south to north, three lines...The katru of 
agnimukha has to sit facing East (pUrvAbhimukha)...

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
