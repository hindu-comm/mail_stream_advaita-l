As I said, the procedure I gave is the tamil-aapastamba proyogam. It may
vary by suutra and region. These things are not set in stone as some might
like to believe.

Drawing the middle line first (as you say above) is followed in the
udakashaanti in the Tamil-aapastamba tradition also. Each line is associated
with a devataa. Why the difference in order between the two - no idea.
Perhaps this is the bodhAyanIya prayogam - the udakashAnti is found in the
bodhAyana shlesha suutras.

Prayoga texts do not talk about inner meaning or any meaning for that
matter. That is to be gained by studying the brAhmaNa texts in the vedas.
