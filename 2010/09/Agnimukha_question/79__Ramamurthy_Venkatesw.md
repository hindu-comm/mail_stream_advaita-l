Pranam

I have been one of the silent followers of the discussions.  Many things I am learning from the discussions.  Although it may not be the subject of discussion here, I believe, it might benefit those who are interested.  If for some reason it is decided to keep this outside the forum, may I request that my name be included for receiving such communications.

Recently, I sent a mail which got bounced back.  I will be interested in sending it again to the moderator for a decision in the matter.

With highest personal regards and respects,

Sincerely yours,
