I witnessed some Srivaishnava priests say 'Adite anu manyasva Anumate
anu manyasva Sarasvate anu manyasva Devaha Savita Prasuva ' like in
Samidadhana or Agnikarya. Even in Vaikhanasa type Agnimukha they do
it. Why is it in Agnimukha?

praNAms 
Hare Krishna

Yes, in Apashambheeya & bOdhAyaneeya agnimukha,  we say this before 'idhma 
prakshepaNa' & even in regular agnikArya also...But in the flow of 
recitation it would be " aditEnamanyasvA, anumatenamanyasvA, sarsvatena 
manyasvA, devaHsavitaH prasuvA ( the kriya involved here is jala dhAra 
from west to east at the south side of hOma kunda, from south to north at 
west side, west to east at north side etc..) ....and after pradhAnAhuti, 
jayAdi hOma & pUrNAhuti we would recite it at the end devaH savitaH 
prAsAveeH...It is there in Apasthambheeya agnimukha vidhi vidhAna & 
Rigvedeeya AshvalAyana prayOga as well...I donot know anything about 
Iyengar's vaikhAnasa type agnimukha...Though I go to Iyengaar's house to 
do hOma as a priest I follow my sva-shAkha (i.e. yajurveda) Apasthambha 
agnimukha.  Anyway, it is always better to learn these rituals from the 
guru.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
