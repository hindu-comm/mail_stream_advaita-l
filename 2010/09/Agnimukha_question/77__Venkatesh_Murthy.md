Namaste Sri Bhaskar,

Kindly explain Agnimukha briefly and purpose of the steps if possible.
There are some homa manuals online to do Sankshipta Homa at home
without priest.IS this the correct way ? Can we put small coconut
piece instead of full coconut in Poornahuti? Can we leave some steps
in a Sankshipta homa?
