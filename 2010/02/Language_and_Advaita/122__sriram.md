Dear Members
It is my humble opinion language is no barrier to experience any spiritual truth.Experiences are subjective and to share that beautiful experience with the notion that others also experience the same  the realisers expressed the inner experience in their own mother tongue or a language in which they are proficient.So it is for us to get at the correct import of their words/sayings for which we have to take pains.One is to know the language of the seers.But even translations will help to get at the truth of their sayings if one contemplates continuously.this is my experience.R.Krishnamoorthy.
