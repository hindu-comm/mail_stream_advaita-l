sarvebhyo namah.

With reference to Sri Sunil Bhattacharjya's comment "It appears that Senaniji has not gone through Abhinanagupta's commentary himself", I would like the readers of this list to know that the general guiding principle for meisnot to take off on a topic where I donot have sufficient background or otherwise interesting enough material to present. I believe I did not violate thatprinciple when I commented on the similarity of Abhinava Gupta's and Sri Madhvacharya's style. Here is my defence:

Sometime back, one gentleman showed me a book which contains "additional" (Footnote 1) slokas of Bhagavidgita, and that these would unite the three differing matas (of Advaita, ViSishTaadvaita and Dvaita). He wanted to understand them better and wanted a translation of those. I translated those slokas from Sanskrit to Telugu and during this process, I had to consult Abhiava Gupta's commentary as 15 of these additional slokas were from the Kashmiri recension, which Abhinava Gupta commentated upon.

One particular difficulty I had was with the word, stambha, in the following sloka (3-40 in the version of Abhinava Gupta; 3-39 in the version from which I translated the additional slokas):

kaamakrOdhamayo ghorah stambhaharshasamudbhavah |
ahaÑkaaro'bhimaanaatmaa dustarah paapakarmabhih ||

The context of the above sloka is that in 3-36 of Sri Sankara's version of Bhagavadgita, Arjuna in the sloka starting with "atha kena prayukto'yam..." asks why purusha does paapa though he does not like to do so. In the version that I was given, Arjuna asks five additional questions: i) Whencecomes the reason for paapacaara? ii) How does it grow? iii) What is aatmaa?; iv) What is aacaara?, and v) What is brahmapadaartha? In answer to the first of the above questions, Bhagavan says A1) This (the mUla for paapa) is infinitesimal, beyond grasp, and an enemy. It combines with the indriyas of man and causes moha. Then, Bhagavan continues with the above quoted sloka and in two more slokas answers the first and second questions together. Rest of the Bhagavadgita is to be taken as the answer for the remaining three questions. Thus, this sloka is a part of the explanation for why men indulge in paapakarmas.

This sloka explains ahaÑkaara as a) kaamakrodhamayah, b) ghorah, c) stambhaharshasamudbhavah, d) abhimaanaatmaa and that e) it cannot be crossed by those who indulge in paapakarmas (paapakarmabhih dustarah). Bhagavan later explains that from abhimaana comes kaama and kaama obstructs aananda, gives rise to sorrow and fear, makes man a mohita and grows.

Coming back to the translation, I had a difficulty with the third adjective, stambhaharshasamudbhavah, as stambha is mostly used to mean a pillar and such. How could ahaÑkaara be connected with a pillar, and what is the need for harsha with reference to a pillar? When I referred Abhinava Gupta's commentary, this is what I found:

stambhah kulaadyabhimaanah tatkrito yo harshah ahameedriSa iti | ata eva aaha ahaÑkaara iti |
(Translation: stambhah is the arrogance of belonging to a [great]kula, family; the joy consequential to such feelings [is stambhakulaadyabhimaanah]. Therefore it is said "ahaÑkaara....".)

The commentary only explained the difficult word and left the others. (Before I proceed further, anaside: compare this explanation of stambha with the wordings "maa kuru dhanajanayauvanagarvam" in Mohamudgara or Bhajagovindam).

To contrast this, compare with the bhashya of Sri Sankara on 3-36 where he explains 'vaarshNeya' (one of the names of Sri Krishna) as 'vrishikula prasUta' (one born in the family of Vrishis). Another aside: Sri Sankara explains paapam in 3-36 as 'karma'. This is dynamite.See Abhinavagupta's subtle defence of his jñaanakarmasamuccayavaada in his commentary on the same sloka.

I hope the above sufficiently demonstrates the pithiness and terseness of Abhinava Gupta. If nothing, a modern saadhaka likes the fact that a lot of obvious material is skipped; the very title of the commentary "Geetaartha samgraha" conveys this. (To be sure, Abhinava Gupta has a slightly different spin on what is 'samgraha', but that is a different matter).

Coming to Sri Sunil's comments, he says Sri Madhvacharya quotes only those verses which seem to support his views; that is, but, natural. I think Sunilji's intention is to mean that Sri Madhvacharya commentates only on those verses / portions which support his view. Thisis a variation of the standard technique of assigning priorities suitable to one's own view, most famously in the Brahmasutras, where different commentators differ on what is purvapaksha and what is siddhanta. Sunilji's main point might be that while Sri Abhinava Gupta offers a complete commentary, Sri Madhvacharya offers but fragments.I would rather say that Sri Madhvacharya's commentaries are esoteric (understood only by a few, the initiated), almost likethe Brahmasutras. The list of later glosses, sub-commentaries, expositions given by Balakrishnajishow that Sri Madhvacharya's mata is indeed complete, samagra, and that the Acharya and his later successors demonstrate -in
 their view, not mine (I am an advaitin) - that scriptures support their view.

To me, such a construct makes sense and that is why I concluded that "Sri Madhva only points out the critical aspects and does not explain every word and every aspect. This is similar, in my limited exposure, to the style of Abhinava Gupta's commentary on Gita."

A final aside. As I myself admitted, my exposure is indeed limited. I wish I read the entire corpus of Abhinava Gupta's work, but my limitations (of intellect and dhriti, and those imposed by the need to work anddesires which demand to be fulfilled) do not afford me that luxury. Even if I were to start studying the entire corpus, I would start with the commentary on Natya Sastra or Dhvanyaaloka, but not philosophy I guess.

I hope the readers of the list find that my comment on the similarity ofthe styles of Sri Madhva and Abhinava Gupta has some grounding in facts.

Footnote 1: The version of Bhagavadgita commentated upon by Sri Sankara is supposed to have 700slokas (some say it actually has 701 slokas), but the Bhishma parva contains a sloka which says Bhagavadgita has 745 slokas (don't have the references at hand - if somebody wants, I will dig it up). So there must be 45 additional slokas is what some say.Dr. Vedavyas IAS published a version with additional slokas in Telugu lipi. A third of these 45 additional slokas are found in the version of Bhagavadgita commentated upon by Abhinava Gupta. It is pertinent to note that the difference between the number of slokas as stated in the text and as actually found is fairly common. In four Mahabharata recensions examined by Dr. Vedavyas, the actual slokas and the slokas mentioned do not tally in any of the parvas; in many cases, there is a difference evenin the number of upaparvas.

Sri Madhvacharya's commentaries are selective rather than holistic in the sense that he quotes only those verse which seem to support his views. His work on the Bhagavatam is a fine example of this.

As regards Senaniji's comment on thecommentary of Abhinavagupta on the Bhagavad Gita It appears that Senaniji has not gone through Abhinanagupta's commentary himself.
