Thank you Venkat for drawing my attention to the mistake I made.

Dear Krunal ji,

Sayanacharya wrote commentaries to the Four Veda-s. Here is a short
write-up on him:

http://www.hindujagruti.org/hinduism/knowledge/index.php?print/id:206

// 4. Sayanacharya

If anyone has written a commentary on the Vedas after Yaskacharya it
is none other than Sayanacharya. It is because of which that the
latter is glorified everywhere. He has written commentaries on all the
Vedas. In the preface to the Taittiriya Sanhita when indicating as to
the Veda about which He wrote the commentary initially, He says, “The
Yajurveda is like a wall and the pictures drawn on it represent the
Rugveda and the Samaveda. That is precisely why I am discussing the
Yajurveda first.” When writing a commentary on every branch of the
Veda He does it in different style. He also has commentaries on the
Shatapatha, Aitareya, Taittiriya and all the Braahmana holy texts of
the Samaveda to His credit.

Commentators who preceded Sayanacharya are Bhattabhaskarmishra,
Venkatmadhav, etc. and those who followed Him are ones like Uvvat and
Mahidhar. Nevertheless they have written commentaries on any one
Vedasanhita, all of them being in Sanskrut and focusing on the central
theme of sacrificial fires (yadnya) in the Vedas.’(4)    //

The Vedic philosophy is that which takes man step by step to the
ultimate realization of his Atman that is none other than Brahman.
The Vedanta is that portion of the Vedic literature where the higher
goal, purushArtha, moksha is discussed primarily.  The portion I had
quoted in the Article is occurring in this part of the Veda and hence
you see Sayanacharya commenting the way he did.

I apologise for answering a question that you did not ask.

Regards,
subrahmanian.v
