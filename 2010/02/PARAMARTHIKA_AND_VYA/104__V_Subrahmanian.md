Namaste Krunal ji,

Thank you for your words of appreciation.

Shankaracharya propagated the Vedanta philosophy.  Since it is
essentially Advaitic in nature, it became popular by this name.  Even
to this day, after several centuries of His advent, by the term
'Vedanta' only 'Advaita' is brought up to one's mind.  Thus Vedanta,
Advaita and Shankara have become synonyms.

Best regards,
Om Tat Sat
