Dear Anbuji,

You said:

 /// I took the position that such is not a condition for release. My
stand was that for one who realizes that he suffers from thaapathrayam and
seeks release through surrender to a Guru is liberated. God Himself comes
to him in the form of the Guru because He is KaruNaamoorthy who removes the
thaapathrayam of the seeking jeeva. ///

Dear Anbuji,

It is not as simple as you try to show it to be. Do you think all the gurus to be iberated? There may be gurus who are not liberated or may even be false gurus. Don't you think that one must be careful to check if one's guru is liberated? There has been umpteen cases where people changed their gurus. In some famous cases the one-time guru himself became the disciple of his disciple.

Dear Sunilji,

In this thread I had posted earlier the following:

"The Lord did tell Arjuna that he was not qualified for nivrthi dharma even
though he taught it to him. And He did explain why Arjuna was not
qualified."

*Arjuna's confusion was in following his own dharma as a kshathriya and at
the end he tells the lord that his confusion has been dispelled.* (See
verse 18.73).

It is true the saying is: "mana Eva manushyaanaam karaNaam
bandhamOkshayO:"In this thread the discussion was on the question whether
the enlightenment of the mind is absolutely needed to realize one's own
Self. I took the position that such is not a condition for release. My
stand was that for one who realizes that he suffers from thaapathrayam and
seeks release through surrender to a Guru is liberated. God Himself comes
to him in the form of the Guru because He is KaruNaamoorthy who removes the
thaapathrayam of the seeking jeeva.

What transpires between the Guru and the Sishya is one-on-one and cannot be
generalized such as a paradigm of mind being the liberator through several
steps of enlightenment. To me it is the the destruction of the mind much
more than any enlightenment (though such is not forbidden), is the cause of
it.Who can deny that the root cause of evil is the mind? Bhagavan Ramana
was emphatic that the mind has to be killed. The way to do it is to
continuously push the mind to its source viz. the Aathma where it will rest
in peace for ever. His particular method of Vichara does not correspond to
the standard held by the classical advaithins. On his type of vichara
Bhagavan Ramana said: "Aathma vichaaram, ayye, adhi sulabham."

At the end of the day the Gnaani will have nothing to do with the BMI.

Aum Sri GurubyO Namaha
Anbu
