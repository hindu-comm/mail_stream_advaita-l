[If Bhagavan Krishna, Himself PUrNa, could have approved such methods of
'nayana deeksha' why did He not do that for Arjuna?  Why did He ask him to
acquire Jnanam by 'tad viddhi praNipaatena pariprashnena sevayaa?' ]

[Since Ahalya's case is out of this, it could well be said in the case of
Gopis that the intellect had become pari pakvam to intuit only the
antaraatma dRk, sAkshi, to the exclusion of every thing else.  This is what
Krishna advises in the 6th chapter: na kinchidapi chintayet.  The Gopi-s
could be said to have had this ability.  Constant, one pointed, Krishna
chintanam can take place only in the intellect.  So, where is the
destruction or giving up of the intellect?  In the Panchadashi Vidyaranya
gives the example of a woman constantly thinking of her paramour even when
engaged in her daily routine.]

[Sir, pl. note that for carrying on in this world the Jnani definitely needs
the mind.  Supposing he is writing a book.  Will he not consult several
other books and select and reject material?  How is this possible without a
mind?  How will he distinguish between what is required for him from what is
not?  If he has to show compassion, care, etc. to others, how will this be
possible without the mind?  Bhagavan has taught in the Gita that these are
all faculties of the mind. If he  is an Acharya, a shortriya brahmanishtha,
how can he teach various students of various levels unless he distinguishes,
discriminates, etc.  It is a wrong notion that the jnani would have no
mind.

According to the Vedanta, prarabdha karma is the one where the present
body-mind complex that has begun will run its destined course and only then
cease.  How can we admit that only the physical body of the Jnani without
the mind will continue? ]

[ When He is the jeeva, will He be just the jiva's body and not the  mind,
intellect, ahankara also?  If he is not always in samadhi, he will have to
interact with the world.  If someone calls him by name, how will he respond
if he has no mind, ahankara? The notion of 'mind is lost with
self-realization' is a concept that is not acceptable to Vedanta.]


> Now tell me how can anyone with only a useless weapon as an
> intellect can challenge his will?


[The intellect is required to go along with the prarabdha even if not for
challenging Iswara's will.  Let me also tell you that there are some videos
available on the Paramacharya of Kanchi.  One can see, over the years, the
Acharya had to be prompted by those around Him for suitable words, names,
dates, etc.  This was not required when He was young in His thirties and
forties. I have seen those videos too.  That shows that the intellect takes
the beating of ageing. This is the natural course of Prakriti to which even
a jnani is subject. Of course it is needless to say that his AtmajnAnam will
not be affected by these.  The Panchadashi Chapter 2 last few shlokas are
specifically on this. ]

Best regards,
subbu
