I understand that guru's prana becomes the shishya's apana an vice versa. Similar may be the case between the husband and the the wife.

Please can anyone reference shastra (I'd guess Shaivite, re kundalini etc)
as authority for chandra nadi, surya nadi with reference to wife on
husband's left for rituals, unless her surya power is required to ward off
bad influences ?

Thanks.

Michael
