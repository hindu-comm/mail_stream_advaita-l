A hundred years ago (in 1910), the Vani Vilas Press in Srirangam published 20 volumes containing all the works attributed to Adi Sankara Bhagavatpada. These volumes were brought out under the direction and guidance of Swami Saccidananda Sivabhinava Narasimha Bharati, the then Jagadguru Sankaracharya of Sringeri. It was in the same year that renovations and new constructions of temples were finished in Kaladi, the birth place of Adi Sankara. 



A few decades ago, Sri V. Sadanand, owner of Samata Books in Chennai, rearranged the 20 volumes into a set of 10 volumes and republished them, with the blessings of Jagadguru Sankaracharya Swami Abhinava Vidyatirtha of Sringeri. These volumes are available with Samata Books, which is run now by Sri V. Krishna, son of Sri Sadanand, and are priced very nominally  (http://www.samatabooks.com/content/complete-works-sankaracharya). In this regard, I am forwarding an email from Sri Krishna to our list, at his request.



While there are other publications available for purchase, this 10-volume set is unique in that it has all the works traditionally attributed to Adi Sankara in one set, in the original Sanskrit, graced with a benedictory Srimukham from the Sringeri Acharya. I ordered a set for myself along with some other Samata publications, when I visited India recently and can highly recommend it to readers of this list. In this centenary year of the original publication of the complete set, please actively consider adding this set to your library and forward the link and information to like minded friends and acquaintances. I would normally hesitate to promote any commercial vendor here on this list, but am making an exception in this case only because I think many of our list-members would be interested in these publications.



Best regards,

Vidyasankar
