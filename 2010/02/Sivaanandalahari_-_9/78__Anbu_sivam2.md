Hey! ParamEswara!  Hey! Gowripriyaa! Please do accept my kavithaa kanya
without any objection.  Let me explain to you in detail of the grantha
mahimaa of my kavithaa kanya named Sivaanandhalahari.  Please listen to me
leisurely and deliberately and accept it ultimately.

This grantham has many upamaanas as its decoration.  These examples were not
repeated and were apt and can easily be related by those who do sravaNam of
this poetry.  Also the words used are easier so that they can be retained in
the mind.  Also these have been composed not in a single vrutham but were
mixed with vasantha thilakam, sikiriNi, aaryaavrutham etc.  thus giving the
reciters of enormous aanandha because of its easiness and the sweet melody.
Besides, Hey! SambhO! it also remains to be capable of being sung by
vidhwaans and parama gnaanis.  This kaavya has bhakthi as its praadhaanyam
and is mixed with the rasas such as karuNa, veera, bhayaanagam, adbhutham,
haasyam and saantham and with guNas such as maadhuryam.  This grantham
reveals in one reading the entire range of thathwas like the myrobalan in
the palm.  It is also capable of being sung as the word groupings have those
lakshanas to give maadhurya rasanas.  Above all it is a modest composition
in style.

Moreover, Hey! ParamEswara! The phrases not only have maadhurya rasam as its
essence but they brightly bring out the thathvaarthams embedded in them.
And they are capable of bringing mangalam to those who chant them.
Therefore Hey! GowripathE! please accept this garland of sivaanandhalahari
without any objection.

This kaavyam has mahimaa only because it imparts Paramasivam to the readers
and not because it was composed by AachaaryaaL.    ParamaachaaryaaL being a
sanyaasi itself is the saakshi for this.

Besides, it is saakshaath Parameswara himself who took the avathaara of
bhagavathpaadhaaL by taking Paarvathi as the BrahmavidhyaaswaroopiNi.  It is
very clear that Paraasakthi herself revealed Herself in this
Sivaanandhalahari.  That is why this kaavya of Sivaanandhalahari remains the
Deviswaroopam revealing that Siva and Shakthi cannot be separated.  It
should be recalled that AachaaryaaL started this Sivaanandhalahari with 'ka'
kaaram doing his smaraNa of the paradhEvatha and by saying 'nijathapa:
phalaabyaam' did the varNana that Siva and Shakthi by their thapas became
their phalaswaroopar.  This is the import of this 98th sloka being dedicated
to AmbaaL.

Saakshaath Paraasakthi's soundharyam cannot be described even by Hari
Brahmaadhi Devathaas.  She shines in her splendour in her aabaraNas and silk
saree.  She is of swarNamayam appearing in sringaara rasam, her poise is of
natural gentleness and by the sruthi vaakyaa 'EshahyEva aanandhayathi' she
feeds sakala praaNis with limitless aanandha.  Hey! ParamEswara! This kaavya
kanya named Sivaanandhalahari is none other than that Soundaryavathi,
sowkumaari, LaavaNya and adhyadhbutha mahaamahimasaalini saakshaath
paraasakthi Sri Parvathi only.  Please accept her as your garland!
