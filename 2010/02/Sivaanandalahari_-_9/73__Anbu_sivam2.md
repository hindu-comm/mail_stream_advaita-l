Oh Paramesvara this big rutted elephant of my mind wanders all over
uncontrolled. Please tie it up tactfully with the rope of Bhakti and control
it, hold it firmly and take it to the stage of stability.

Hey! ParamEswara! My mind of an elephant is profoundly engrossed in roaming
on objects driven by its iccha.  Please show me the grace so that this crazy
elephant could be tied with the rope of bhakthi to anchor on to your lotus
feet thus attain the brahma gnaana.  Only then my janma gets its chapalam.

Aum Namasivaaya!
