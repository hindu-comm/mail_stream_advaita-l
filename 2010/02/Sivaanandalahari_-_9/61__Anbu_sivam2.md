Sivaanandalahari - 94 सा रसना ते नयने तावेव करौ स एव कृतकृत्य: ।
या ये यो वदतीक्षेते सदार्चद: स्मरति ॥ ९४ ॥

sA rasanA te nayane tAveva karau sa eva kRutakRutya: |
yA ye yo vadatIkShete sadArchada: smarati || 94 ||

Only that which speaks about Lord Paramashiva is toungue, only those which
see (Him) are eyes, only those which worship ( Him) are hands and only the
one who always thinks of the Lord is one whose life is fulfilled.

எம்கை உனக்கல்லாது எப்பணியும் செய்யற்க
கங்குல் பகல் எம் கண் மற்றொன்றும் காணற்க;
இங்கிப்பரிசே எமக் கெங்கோன் நல்குதியேல்
எங்கெழிலென் ஞாயிறு எமக்கேலோ ரெம்பாவாய்
திருவெம்பாவை

Hey! ParamEswara! That tongue that keeps chanting your name alone is the
tongue.  Those eyes that are doing the dharisanam of your mangala vigraha
and of your jyOthir linga alone are eyes.  Those hands that do bilwaarchana
alone are the hands.

Whoever does not let his mind follow the vishayas but keeps doing dhyaanam
of the mangala vigraham of Mahakailaasaadhipathi ParamEswara he alone is the
bhakthan, dhanyan, janma chaapalyan.  He is the raajayOgi.  Everything will
have adheenam (dependency) in him.

Aum Namasivaaya!
