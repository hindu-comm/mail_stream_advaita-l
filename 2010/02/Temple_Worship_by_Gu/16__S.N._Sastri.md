 Dear Sri Jayanarayanan,

In Srimad Bhagavatam, Skandha VI, Chapter 7, the gods go to VishvarUpa and
request him to be their purohit. He agrees, because he cannot refuse when
the gods ask him, but says:

vigarhitam dharmashIlaiH brahmavarca upavyayam |



Meaning—The occupation of a priest is looked down upon by men of righteous
disposition, and it is calculated to diminish one’s Brahmic lustre
(Brahmavarcas).



This may be the reason why Brahmins who take up the performance of worship
as a means of livelihood are looked down upon.



Best wishes,

S.N.Sastri
