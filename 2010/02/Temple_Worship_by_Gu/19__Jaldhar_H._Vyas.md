A purohit is not the same as pujari.  The very first rk of the rgveda asks 
Agni to become the purohit as he is the purohit of the Gods.  The Devas 
themselves have only the highest regard for Vishvarupa as the rest of that 
conversation shows.  So why does he say that paurohityam reduces 
brahmavarchas?  I think it is because the purohit participates in the 
dharma -- and adharma -- of his patron.  And Indra as befits the thunder 
and storm, is not the most stable of personalities.  In fact the very need 
for Vishvarupa is because the previous purohit, Brhaspati, has left after 
being insulted.  Vishvarupa cannot refuse the request because as a 
Brahmana it is his duty, but he is not very enthusiastic about it (for 
good reasons as we see later in the story.)
