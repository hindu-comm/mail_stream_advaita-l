Yes. One should not depend on dubious relics. To my knowledge Lord Buddha's tooth, which to my knowledge is accepted as an authentic relic by the Buddhists, was brought to Puri (erstwhile Dantapuri) and later on that was taken from there to Sri Lanka. I doubt if the custodians of that tooth in Sri Lanka will ever allow it to be radio-carbon-dated.

I notice that this webpage does not say that the relic belonged to the historical
Buddha. In the Buddhist monastic tradition, preservation of relics were not limited
to gautama Sakyamuni. Bones of many other monks were preserved in different
places.
