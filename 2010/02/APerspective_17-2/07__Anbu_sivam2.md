Dear Sunilji,

If there were no rays of the sun then the clouds cannot be formed so there
can be no identity for the cloud apart from the sun yet the clouds cover the
sun.  Likewise the smoke originates from the fire and therefore it cannot
have a different identity from the fire yet it covers the fire.  Likewise
all the kosas though spoken of as covering the aathman as sword and its
sheath, these kosas have no existence different and apart (such as the sword
and the sheath) from the aathman.

Therefore the kosas are allegorical rather than material.

We thus know of the manas and buddhi and chittha and ahamkara but cannot
point them out to anyone.

So in waking state when the buddhi is alive the mind is under control of the
buddhi (unlike during dream time when the buddhi is absent) except under the
power of the vaasanaas the mind overpowers the buddhi during the waking
time.

If everyone has no buddhi then how would the waking state be different from
the dream state?

(I am aware that you and I talked of the existence or otherwise of the
buddhi in dream time before and we differed on this account.)

Thus in waking time buddhi tries to rule while the manas, aided by the
vaasanaas, tries to overpower the buddhi.

So when buddhi is predominant then you can say that the mind has sunk into
the buddhi ( in your parlance the manomaya kosa is sunk into vignanamaya
kosa).  When the sleep overtakes with both manas and buddhi absent then your
allusion that manomayakosa and vignanamaya kosa has sunk into aanandamaya
kosa can be a correct description.

Regards,
Anbu
