While commenting on the mantra ''satyam cha anRtam cha Satyam abhavat' 
(Taittiriya Up. II.6) Sri Shankaracharya says: satyam = vyavaharavishayam 
praNAms Sri Subbu prabhuji
Hare Krishna
But prabhuji dont you think this quote exclusively dealing with srushti 
prakriya and nothing to do with compartmentalization of reality which we 
have been practicing oflate while dealing with certain issues??!!  This 
quote says ultimate satya is the base for vyavahAravishaya and at a 
stretch prAtibhAsika (if at all anruta is meant to denote prAtibhAsika..) 
For that matter in geeta bhAshya too shankara clarifies that because of 
the 'essence' of satya in vyavahAra, we could reach & deal in vyavahAra : 
na hi nirAtmakaM kiMchit bhutaM vyavahArAya avakalpate (geeta 9-4)..coz. 
this satya  is the kArANa for all appearances & it has to be there 
anyway!!  As you know, in taitireeya itself, subsequently shruti says 
yadidaM kiM cha tatsatyamityAchakshate to denote the 'all pervasiveness' 
of that satya..in bruhadAraNyaka too shankara says nAma rUpa is satyaM and 
these would envelop the prANa..nAma rUpe satyaM tAbhyAmayaM 
prANashcchannaH, and in another place he says satyasya satyaM  is 
paramAtma, satyaM cha bhUtapanchakaM, satyasya satyaM cha para Atma...From 
these quotes, out of context, we cannot say nAma rUpa is also true (satya) 
and paNcha bhUta also satya etc. &  there exists gradations in satya and 
paramArtha satya can be contrasted from other two satya-s etc. ...If this 
satya what shankara saying is 'real' satya, it is only from the point of 
view of kArya-kAraNa ananyatva and not to advocate the different levels of 
satya...
Kindly pardon me Sri subbu prabhuji, I know, you donot want to indulge in 
discussion...but just sharing my amateur  thoughts..Thanks onceagain for 
your interest in the subject.
Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
