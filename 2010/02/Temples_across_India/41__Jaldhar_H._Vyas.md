I don't think it is true historically and it certainly doesn't seem to be 
true today.

Chowbey (or more usually Chaube) is a prakritization of Chaturvedi and 
they are from Mathura and surrounding parts of UP not Orissa.  They are 
typically followers of Vallabhacharya and as Dwarka has long been under 
the influence of that branch of Vaishnavism, it is possible that some 
Chaubes may have become pujaris at Dwarkadish.  However the last time my 
father went there about five years back, the priest was a Gujarati 
Brahmana.

Panda or Pandey are common Brahmana surnames in Eastern India (prakrit 
forms of Pandit) but not in Gujarat where the equivalent form is Pandya 
(which in turn has nothing to do with the South Indian royal dynasty of 
that name.)

It's unlikely.
