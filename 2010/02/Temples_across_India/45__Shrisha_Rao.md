I don't know if all the claims about cross-linkages are true, or what
basis exists to associate Sri Sankara
with the same, but there certainly are such instances.  It may be
recalled that there was some uproar
last year because the Nepali government threatened to eject the
hereditary South Indian priests from the
Pashupatinath temple in that country.
