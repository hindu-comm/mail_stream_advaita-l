Dear Sadanandaji,

Hari OM!

Even in vyavahaarika sattha *we all know who we are* without the medium of
the mind.

In the vexed example the intellect never found the tenth man.  Is it not the
fact?

I am saying this to show that the role of the intellect is over-blown.  It
doesn't deserve all these credits.

Even though we know who we are, thanks to the intellect we slip into
believing that we are the incomplete jeeva who is born and dead.  It is only
when the Guru comes to you and tells those magic words "Thath Thwam Asi"
that you realize that you are complete and full and you are none other than
the Parabrahmam.  At that moment all other arguments that had justified this
Mahavaakya is lost by the wayside. Intellect has no way of bringing about
this realization.  The realization is for you, by you and of you.  And when
it happens the intellect and all other units of the prakrithi vanishes like
the mist before the sun.  In one way the realization is the actual killing
of the intellect.

Bhagavan Ramana has given moksha to animate and inanimate objects and there
is no role for the intellect in them at all.  This is the prathyaksha
pramaaNam for many of us.  Even though he became 'famous' because of his
superior arguments that fed the imagination of the intellectuals in his
exposition of 'who am I' he always told the seekers to give up the
intellect. As you know the intellect is part of the ahamkara that one has to
lose in order to gain Self-Realization.  It, the intellect, is a hindrance
to attaining mOksha.  When an ordinary person who witnessed a great debate
between Bhagavan and the intellectuals later approached Bhagavan and asked
him if he as saamaanyan will have hope because he is not versed in the Vedas
etc.  And to him Bhagavan said such knowledge is no pre-requisite and he is
more than qualified for he has reached the Guru.

You have to remember that the intellect delights in reordering the many into
its own concept of harmony.  Take away the many, the intellect pines and
dies.


Subhamasthu.
Anbu
