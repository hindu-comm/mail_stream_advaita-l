Namaste Anbu ji,

There appears to be a need for some clarifications on your observations.
Pl. permit me to make some points in [ ]

[ There is in Advaita Vedanta a distinction made between 'svarUpa jnAnam'
and 'vRtti jnAnam'.  The former is nitya and aparoksha and is not in need of
the mind.  However, the latter arises/is possible ONLY with the
instrumentality of the mind.  While a jnAni and an ajnAni have svarupa
jnanam what differentiates the jnani from the other is this:

The jnani, owing to his sadhana under a Guru, has trained his mind and made
the 'akhanDAkAra vritti' jnAnam possible.  This special vritti which has the
Atma for its form destroys the avidya aavaraNam and itself gets destroyed.
The example given is the 'veTTiyAn's kombu'.  He kindles the fire in the
grave yard with this kombu and finally consigns the kombu too into the
fire.  You know this.  But this is a must.  It is this vRtti jnAnam that
requires the mind mandatorily.  manasaiva anu drashTavyam, buddhigraahyam
attendriyam, etc are just two of the hundreds of shruti and smriti passages
that insist on the inevitable, unavoidable, instrumentality of the mind for
attaining self-realization.

In an ajnAni this Vritti has not taken place and the avidya aavaraNam has
therefore not gone and so he continues in ignorance.  For him the svarupa
jnanam though available as a birth right, is not experienced distinctly like
the jnani does.  It is all mixed up with samsaric vrittis and that is what
keeps him in samsara.  The jnani, even though can engage in worldly affairs,
knows to discriminate between the svarupa jnanam and the vritti jnanams of
worldly affairs and acts without losing his realized state.  The Panchadashi
has several shlokas to demonstrate this.  Even the Vivekachudamani has such
verses.

Even for Ramana Bhagavan the death experience that launched him into
realization took place only thru the instrumentality of the mind.  It cant
be otherwise.  If there is no mind, a human and a stone are non different.
Atma chaitanyam is all pervading and is in and thru all things, both
sentient and insentient.  All sentient beings have this thing called
'chidAbhAsa' the reflected consciousness and that is what distinguishes them
from inanimate objects.  While only the former can hope to get
self-realization, the latter do not have that possibility.  ]

[Even the best Guru can remove one's ignorance only thru the instrumentality
of the mind.  The upadesha can work only if there is a prepared mind.  In
the absence of the prepared mind no Atma jnanam can take place.  It is
another thing that the Guru can help preparing the mind very rapidly.  But
ultimately Atman realization is possible only thru the mind.  That is the
teaching of Shankaracharya's Advaita thru the Bhashyams.]


The word belief is often used euphemistically indicating that it

[There is in the Bhagavatam this verse of the Gopika:  na khalu gopikaa
nandano bhavaan. sakala dehinaam antaraatma dRk. This means: the gopis
realised Krishna not as the child of Yashodha but as the Saakshi of
everyone's intellect.  It is this realization that makes them different from
others.]

[All this only means that the troublesome mind is tamed and rendered pure so
that Atman realization can take place.  Without the medium of the mind no
one can get realization.  This is the Vedanta Siddhanta that is inviolable.
There is no escape from this method.  Whether it is bhakti marga or jnana
marga, this alone is the way.  Pl look into the verses 24 and 25 of the 13th
Chapter of the Bhagavadgita with the Acharya's Bhashyam and preferably with
Anandagiri's teeka. ''dhyAnena Atmani pashyanti kechid aatmaanam
aatmana...Here the word Atmani in the saptami means: 'in the intellect,
buddhau'.  It will clarify the Vedantic position as taught by
Shankaracharya.]

My intention is to bring out the traditional Advaitic position on the
subject and definitely not to counter the views expressed by you.

Warm regards,
