Anbuji,
I have not raise any doubt. I was just referring to the relevant portion from the Bhagavad Gita.

Sunilji,

Trikaala is the swaroopalakshaNam of time. It arises from a standpoint.
(Remember the theory of relativity where the westerner discusses it from the
standpoint of a human being who can see only one thing at one moment? He
never discussed what would he see if everything of the past present and
future could be simultaneously seen! Such concept was unknown to him!)
There is no standpoint for Parabrahmam (Krishna) which is why He is bootha,
bhavya bhavath Prabhu:. Therefore He is beyond the kaala.

Start thinking that *Krishna is Parabrahmam and the only Reality* then you
will have no doubts such as the one you have raised.

Regards,
Anbu
