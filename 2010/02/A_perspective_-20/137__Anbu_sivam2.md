Dear Sadanandaji,

Pranaams.

Since you have said it was your last posting, I suppose this response of
mine would be for the benefit of the readers.

Quote: "No knowledge can take place without the mind, including
self-knowledge."

This is not correct.  Self-awareness is not dependent on the mind for such
realization is an inalienable right of every jeeva and therefore cannot be
conditioned.  A person has misidentification by ignorance due to the play of
Maya.  Mind is a tool of Maya if I am allowed to put it that way. Guru
removes the ignorance and the misidentification is destroyed and the Self is
revealed.  The form and manner in which the Guru removes the ignorance is
not to be asserted in any particular way.

Bhagavan Ramana's Guru was the Holy Hill of Arunachala.  Bhagavan explicitly
did not say this but when someone asked him: "Bhagavan, you say there can be
no release without a Guru.  So tell us who is your Guru." Bhagavan merely
turned his head towards the Hill and nodded indicating that the Hill was his
Guru.  For people like you the fact that Bhagavan had the Hill as his Guru
may be a belief for that is how the mind plays with its duality of belief
and disbelief so we are to get caught in its trap.  Mind as you know like
all other things in the prakrthi is made up of opposites.  IT IS NOT WISE TO
THINK THAT THE MIND CAN BE TAMED NOT TO VACILLATE.  SUCH ATTEMPT WOULD
DESTROY ITS SWAROOPAM AND MIND WOULD NOT PERMIT IT.  Besides, the content of
the mind is truly false and therefore why insist that one goes by it?

 If Bhagavan had openly said that the Hill was his Guru then there would
have been a debate whether a hill can be a Guru.   A judgement would then be
pronounced that a Hill can be a Guru cannot be proved and so Bhagavan didn't
really have a Guru and other variations of this argument putting Bhagavan in
bad light to say the least.

In Ramayana the mere touch of the foot of Sri Rama removed the
misidentification of Ahalya with the rock.  Again for some people it is just
a belief.  The word belief is often used euphemistically indicating that it
makes no sense.  All Bhaagavathaas believe that the Gopis got release in
their play with Lord Krishna but such would not be release for some who
would hold that the intellect by its dissection and discovery alone is the
liberator.  The reason I took the trouble to post my commentary on
Sivaanandalahari is to show that our AachaaryaaL was very much emphatic on
the bhakthi maarga and insisted on the surreder at the lotus feet of
ParamEswara.

Truly the mind has the dual role of hiding the 'I' and then finding it out!
One can play by its rule OR surrender to the Guru and get relieved of this
mind.  It is a choice.  The reason a person would surrender to a Guru is to
relieve himself of the thaapathrayam and nothing else. The Guru will kill
the mind rather than delight it with his feedings.  Actually the real Guru
will make the sishya cry and cry by putting down his ego and dumping it. The
death of this mind which is the root cause of thaapathrayam, alone is the
liberation.

My remark below is not directed at Sadanandaji whom I hold in great respect.

I see this holiest nivrthi dharma is increasingly being turned into a
science fiction and is peddled around the globe.  Our AachaaryaaL knew of
this and sang "jatilO mundi lunchita kesa: kaashayaambara
bahukruthavEsha:............ ".  In his introduction to the commentary on
Bhagavath Geetha AchaaryaaL says that the Lord taught the two fold dharma of
the pravrthi and the nivrithi to Arjuna.  The Lord did tell Arjuna that he
was not qualified for nivrthi dharma even though he taught it to him.  And
He did explain why Arjuna was not qualified.  The fact that this nivrthi
dharma is not for those who are not qualified is often ignored by those who
found it interesting.  The result is that it remains interesting, that is
all.

Performing nithya karmas and raising children in our dharma is being
abandoned in astonishing speed in favour of this secular poison of giving
importance to the intellect.  Many of the neo-Gurus have not even identified
themselves with Hindu religion holding that all religions are equal.  It is
a pity.  Our AachaaryaaL on the other hand appeared in this earth to bring
about the revival of varnaasrama dharma and against its destruction sought
by other religions.
