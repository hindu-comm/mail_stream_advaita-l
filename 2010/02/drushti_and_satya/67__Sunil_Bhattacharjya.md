Can we put the relation between the Vyavaharika Satya and the Paramarthika Satya as follows?
The Vyavaharika Satya is what appears to us when in the Mental plane (or the Manomaya kosha) the mind interacts with the objects of senses. At the higher plane of wisom (or the Jnanatmana or the Vijnanamaya kosha) where the mind ceases its activities one becomes more like a sakshi and what was experienced in the mental plane appears as nothing but a series of dreams. When one sees the past births as a series of dreams then one sees the Paramarthika Satya.

Pratibhashika Satya too is a dream-state without the interaction of the mind with the sense-objects.
Any comment?
Regards,
Sunil K. Bhattacharjya

Can words 'drushti' & 'satya' carry the same meaning?? I dont think 
so...But surprisingly, while discussing advaita vedAnta, we are using 
these two words alternatively as if these two words are synonyms!! 
Ofcourse, shankara at various places in his prasthAna trayi bhAshya makes 
clear distinction between naive view of reality (lOka drushti) and 
vedAntic view of the same (shAstra drushti)...shankara also calls these 
two view points as vyAvahArika drushti (transactional view point) & 
pAramArthika drushti (transcedental view point). But nowhere he hints 
about the existence of vyAvahArika, prAtibhAsika & pAramArthika satya to 
give us the impression that there exists gradations in reality!!

Dont you think it is better to have difference in view points intead of 
split in truth itself?? Can our vyAvahArik talks on advaita allow us to 
split the concept of absolute truth itself to label it as vyAvahArika, 
prAtibhAsika & pAramArthika satya-s?? Again, I dont think so, because 
vyAvahArika satya what we are attributing to this world is nothing but an 
'effect' which is nothing more than appearance and consequently the 
'cause' stands for the substrate on which appearances are mere 
superimposition (adhyArOpita). 

Any clarification on these terms drushti and satya would be highly 
appreciated.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
