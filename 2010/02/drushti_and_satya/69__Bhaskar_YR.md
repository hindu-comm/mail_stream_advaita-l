Can we put the relation between the Vyavaharika Satya and the Paramarthika 
Satya as follows?
The Vyavaharika Satya is what appears to us when in the Mental plane (or 
the Manomaya kosha)  the mind interacts with the objects of senses.  At 
the higher plane of wisom (or the Jnanatmana or the Vijnanamaya kosha) 
where the mind ceases its activities one becomes more like a sakshi and 
what was experienced in the mental plane appears as nothing but a series 
of dreams. When one sees the past births as a series of dreams then one 
sees the Paramarthika Satya

Again, IMO, there is no need to label our avidyA vyavahAra or avidyA 
drushti as 'vyAvahArika' satta!! It is only due to cataract in our eyes we 
are seeing two moons and there is no 'satyatva' in perception of  two 
moons...it is only due to our 'drushti dOsha' there appears two moons but 
there is no satyatva in the existence of two moons.  Ofcourse, when we get 
rid of this 'drushti dOsha' we realize that there was/is/will be only one 
moon!!  We cannot say before realization there were two moons and now 
after eye operation two moons have become one...jnAna cannot change the 
status of satya it only reveals what is 'always' there.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
