Sometimes, when there is too much wordy discussion going on, which seems
to take away the focus from main points, it is very refreshing to go back to
the upanishat texts - sac ca tyac cAbhavat ...  satyaM cAnRtaM ca satyam
abhavat ... ... asad vA idam agra AsIt tato vai sad ajAyata - taittirIya. Any
standard translation will suffice to set us thinking about the riddle and solution
presented by these words! Whether we call it only a difference in dRshTi or
viewpoint, or a truth value difference in reality, it is to these Sruti vAkya-s
that all must finally return.
Best regards,Vidyasankar
