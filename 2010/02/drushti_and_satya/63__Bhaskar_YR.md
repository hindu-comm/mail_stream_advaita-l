Can words 'drushti' & 'satya' carry the same meaning??  I dont think 
so...But surprisingly, while discussing advaita vedAnta,  we are using 
these two words alternatively as if these two words are synonyms!! 
Ofcourse,  shankara at various places in his prasthAna trayi bhAshya makes 
clear distinction between naive view of reality (lOka drushti) and 
vedAntic view of the same (shAstra drushti)...shankara also calls these 
two view points as vyAvahArika drushti (transactional view point)  & 
pAramArthika drushti (transcedental view point).  But nowhere he hints 
about the existence of vyAvahArika, prAtibhAsika & pAramArthika satya to 
give us the impression that there exists gradations in reality!!

Dont you think it is better to have difference in view points intead of 
split in truth itself??  Can our vyAvahArik talks on advaita  allow us to 
split the concept of absolute truth itself to label it as vyAvahArika, 
prAtibhAsika & pAramArthika satya-s?? Again, I dont think so, because 
vyAvahArika satya what we are attributing to this world is nothing but an 
'effect' which is nothing more than appearance  and consequently the 
'cause' stands for the substrate on which appearances are mere 
superimposition (adhyArOpita). 

Any clarification on these terms drushti and satya would be highly 
appreciated.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
