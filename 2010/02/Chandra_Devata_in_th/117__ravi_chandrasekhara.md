Has Sri Shanakaracharya or any authority on dharmashastras commented on the story of Chandra(Soma), son of Atri Rishi ?  

Chandra eloped with Brahaspati Rishi's wife Tara and gave birth to a son named Budha.  Budha's descendants founded the Chandravamshi Kshatriya lineage that Bhagawan Shri Krishna took avatar into.

What is the possible (dharmic) explanation of Chandra's actions , he being a Devatha ? And also of Tara's actions being a rishi patni ?
Did Chandra committ paapam of cohabiting with a Guru's wife, being that Rishis are Gurus ?

What is the status of Budha, product of this (from a mundane human prespective) of this illicit union ?

Based on the illicit union that resulted in Budha, how could his descendants be of illustrious Kshatriya lineage ?

Dhanyavaad,
Ravi Chandrasekhara
