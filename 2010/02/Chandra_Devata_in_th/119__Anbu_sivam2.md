According to my understanding Brishaspathy went to Indra the lord of the
devas and complained to him when Chandra refused to return Tara.  Indras was
ready to wage war on Chandra and Chandra at the goading of Brahma returned
Tara to Brihaspathy.  No curse was involved as it was Tara who willingly
joined Chandra.  A woman cannot be punished for deserting a man. (Thank God,
Hinduism is not the same as Islam.)

The reason Chandra started waxing and waning is because out of his 27 wives
who are the daughters of Daksha Chandra was more fond of RohiNi to the
neglect of others and so her sisters complained to their father Daksha.
Daksha cursed Chandra that will lose his shine.  Chandra surrendered to
Shiva who put him on his head which is a heap of aushadham and because of
that Chandra was able to regain his lustre.  However Siva told Chandra that
He would not nullify Daksha's curse so Chandra was waxing and waning since
then.

Actually AachaaryaaL refers to this second story in Sivaanandhalahari.
