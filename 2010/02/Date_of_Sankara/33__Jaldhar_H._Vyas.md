One counter argument against this could be that there may have been 
opponents of Advaita Vedanta in previous times who were eclipsed by 
Ramanuja or Madhva just as earlier Advaitins were almost completely 
replaced by Shankaracharya.  I don't think this is true for Dvaita but we 
do know there were some pre-Ramanuja Vishishtadvaitins.  Shankaracharya 
himself complains that in his time there were Vedantins who misinterpreted 
the siddhanta.  (Bhartraprapancha is one whose name though not writings 
has come down to us.)

Nevertheless what you are saying is quite sensible and exactly the method 
used by professional historians.  External factors such as who is quoting 
or refuting who are as important as internal evidence in determining these 
dates.
