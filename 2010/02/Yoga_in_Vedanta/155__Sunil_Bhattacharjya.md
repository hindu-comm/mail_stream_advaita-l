Namaste and hello Bhattacharjya-ji

My point was , if one arrives at the
same conclusion, it does not always
suggest the knowledge was
borrowed.

Yajvanji,
Namaste,
What are you trying to say? Did I
anytime say to the contrary? I think you
are confused, Sunil K. Bhattacharjya

Could not the truth be the same? If I
say the sky is blue, and a year later
another says the sky is blue , does that
suggest 'borrowing' occurred?

Namaste,

Both Yogasutra and Yogasara define Yoga
as "Chitta vritti nirodha" This shows
that Patanjalidid borrow from Yogasara,
unless somebody can prove that Yogasara,
one of the 108 original upanishads, was
revealed after the living times of
Patanjali. Vajrasoochika of course
defines what a brahmana is andgoes to
impress that that a brahmana is not
necessarily by birth in a brahmin
family. A true brahmana has to adhere to
yoga and be one with all. Here the
relation between Yogasutra and
Vajrasoochika is somewhat indirect. My
contention is that Vedantadoes not
ignoreYoga, although I agree that what
can be achieved by practice of Ashtanga
Yoga can also be achieved by direct
meditation (say in the Ajna Chakra) if I
have unerstood the Yogataravalli right.

Regards,

Sunil K. Bhattacharjya

Re: Patanjali appears to have taken his
definition of Yoga from the
  Yogasara and the Vajrasoochika
upanishads,

Can you assist and provide the logic or
audit trail to your assessment?

Namaste

That is on the assumption that the
Yogasara and Vajrasucika Upanishads were
codified and written prior to the Yoga
Sutras.
