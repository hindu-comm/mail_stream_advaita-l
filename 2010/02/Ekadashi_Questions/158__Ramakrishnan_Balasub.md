 For most observations, the tithi during sunrise is the tithi for the day.
My understanding (may be flawed) that this holds true for ekAdashI
observations also. You need to get the panchangam for the location that you
live in and determine the sun-rise time. Some festivals like "nonbu" or
unusual in the sense that they need to be observed at a particular instant.

In the smarta sampradaya acchidra-ashvamedha paarayaNam (taaittiriiya
braahmaNam 3.7-3.9) on ekAdashI and kAThakam (brAhmaNam 3.10-3.12) on
dvAdashI are considered good. Some others traditions are the upaniShads
(AraNyakam 3.7-3.10) on dvAdashI. There's also a more elaborate tradition
where both sets are recited on dvAdashI along with aaraNyakam 6 (antyeShTI
or "kATTu prashnam"), and puruShamedham (braahmaNam 3.4).
