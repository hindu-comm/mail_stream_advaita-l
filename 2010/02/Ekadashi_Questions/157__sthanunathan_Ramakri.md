Dear all,

   I have some questions on Ekadashi fasting and the smarta. I will be very happy if learned members can either reply or point out to some books on this. I searched on the net but could find only vaishnavite views on this.

   How is the ekadashi determined for Smartas. Should the tithi for the day be ekadashi (which I presume means that at sunrise, the tithi is ekadashi) or should ekadashi be the dominant tithi of the day. For example today's (Feb 24) tithi is given as Dasami and yet the panchangam says today is Smarta Ekadashi. 

    I also read some puranic quotes that seem to prohibit observance of ekadashi when the day has some dasami mixed in it. What is the smarta position and what is it based on. It would be nice if some members can explain the ekadashi determination with quotes from smrithis/puranas or point to some book on this.

Thanks for your help.

regards
Sthanu
