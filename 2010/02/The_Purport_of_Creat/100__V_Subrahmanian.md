Namaste.

O, many thanks for that quick response and reference.  BTW, do you
have any special search facility or is it your phenomenal memory?

On an aside note, I read in a Dvaita website long ago that even
Shankaracharya quotes the Agama Prakarana of Mandukya Karika (for
Dvaitins the entire Agama Prakarana is the Upanishad) as 'Upanishad'.
I was trying to figure out where at all did Bhagavatpada do this.  And
when I came across this I.16 quoted in the Sutra Bhashya, I was
surprised for three things:

1.  The Dvaita site was apparently not correct on facts.
2. In 2.1.9 while quoting from the Karika, the Acharya says:
अत्रोक्तं वेदान्तार्थ-संप्रदायविद्भिः-आचार्यैः .... and not as a
mantra from the Mandukya Upanishad.
3. Shankaracharya respectfully refers to Gaudapada as the Knower of
the method of disseminating the Vedantic Truth.

Om Tat Sat
