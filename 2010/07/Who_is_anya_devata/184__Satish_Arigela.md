The tantra-s know of a ganesha/vinAyaka who is described as above, i.e. pArvatI 
putra, mUShika vAhana etc. 


What do you mean by tAntrikopAsita vinAyaka and how is it different from above? 
May be you can elaborate on it a bit?

The vinAyaka that is shown on panels with sapta mAtR^ika-s along with vIrabhadra 
is always praised with the same same epithets that you mention.

> vedOkta gaNapati

That is something interesting!

Subject: Re: [Advaita-l] Who is anya devata?

BTW, what is the view on who is anya devata?

praNAms
Hare Krishna

Those anya devata-s are, as per bhAshya vinAyaka & sapta mAtrukA-s...But 
in all propability the vinAyaka here may not be the popular devata pArvati 
putra, mUshika vAhana gaNapati or gaNesha, shankara might be referring 
here some tAntrikOpAsita vinAyaka.  This guess is worth  because there are 
numerous hymns on vedOkta gaNapati attributed to shankara bhagavatpAda.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
