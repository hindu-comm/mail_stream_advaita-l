I just thought of modaka when I thought about Vinayaka - no
pretention, at least consciously, just non-scholarly but will try to
avoid goingg forward if it hurts sensibilities.

BTW, what is the view on who is anya devata?

Could you refrain from off-the-cuff non-scholarly remarks like the above
when you want to ask for scholarly input (or want to pretend to ask for
scholarly input)? Depending on personal taste, puLiyodarai (tamarind rice),
dadhyodanam (curd rice) and veNNai (butter) are equally attractive or
more attractive than kozhukkattai (modaka).
