Ramesh, instead of getting frustrated and annoying hundreds of people who 
can't help you you should have followed the footer that appears at the 
bottom of every message:

I don't see that you followed the unsubscription procedure. It also says:

When doing so, please be specific as to what you want.  We conversed just 
a couple of weeks ago and I didn't get the impression you wanted to 
unsubscribe.  We moderators do not yet have the siddhi of telepathy you 
know :-)

Anyway I have unsubscribed you now.
