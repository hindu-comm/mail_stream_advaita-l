The Valmiki Ramayana also does not contain any reason why we shouldn't interpret Rama's "grief" as merely an act for the world, while Rama was ever in absolute control of his mind. Ramana Maharshi's chief intention is to make this point about Rama's behavior not contradicting His Wisdom, hence Bhagavan's story perfectly complements the events in the Ramayana.
