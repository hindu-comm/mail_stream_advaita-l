The 'impossible' in my above-quoted paragraph is not the ability-dependent
ones that you quote from the 12th chapter.  What I mean is:  Such an event
itself is an impossibility for any human being.  Whereas the 12th Chapter is
talking about the various grades of development of a sadhaka.  All the
alternatives / steps mentioned there are definitely possible for humans to
attain, by sincere effort and the Lord's blessings.  They only mean that one
will have to graduate from one level to the other higher one and ultimately
come to the highest sadhana and thereafter become liberated.

And I think you have taken my word 'aprsaktasya' to some other word
'aprashaktasya'.  'prasakti' is different from 'prashakti'.  The former
means:  an occasion, room for something to happen, a possibility.  I do not
see any meaning for the second word in the context I have used the term.

Again, pl. note the spelling.  There is a similar quotation in the
Jivanmukti viveka too.  Here it is 'not to share the same seat'. Yes, it is
only because such a prasakti is there the scripture gives that warning.
There is a saying:  kAmaaturANAm na bhayam na lajjA. [For the one afflicted,
overpowered, by lust, there is no concern for any decency.  He knows not
fear.  Shame deserts him.  He is up to anything.]  The Gita verse:  vashey
hi yasya indriyANi tasya prajnA pratiShThitaa is worth remembering.  Of
course, along with sense-control, mind-control is also crucial.  Also there
is the other popular verse:

ahAra-nidrA-bhaya-maithunam cha sAmAnyametat pashubhir narANAm
dharmo hi teShAm adhiko viSheshaH dharmeNa heenAH pashubhis samAnAH

[The craving for food, sleep, fear of enemy and the craving for copulation
is the same for the animals as well as humans.  What distinguishes the human
from the animals is that in all these four Dharma is the guide for the
human.  If dharma is given a go by, man is no different from an animal.]
