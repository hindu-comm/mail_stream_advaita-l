Pranams Sri Subrahmanian:

If the BMI of a Jnani is the the author of a work such as a Bhasya (or
something independent), then is it infallible? This was the reason for my
original question - can we hold the Vivekachoodamani on the same level as
the Vedas as regards Truth? Or is the former open to error? It is likely
that a follower of Madhvacharaya would have such a view on Sankaracharya's
works. How would an Advaitin then answer?

And I don't mean an answer such as
(a) Sankaracharya's Bhashya is more consistent with Shurti than
Madhvacharayas (this debate has been going on for centuries now) or
(b) Claim of Sri Krishnamurty's - Madhvacharaya is not self realized
(possibly dogmatic)
(c) Claim of Sri Krishnamurty's - Advaita is avirodha (see objections to
that in my reply to him)

The answer ought to be to the question - can a Jnani's work be infallible?
If yes, we will be forced to take Advaita also as a view (however exalted),
The Truth being upheld only with silence?

Thanks, Mahesh
