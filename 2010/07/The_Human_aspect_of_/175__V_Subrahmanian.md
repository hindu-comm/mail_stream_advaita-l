Namaste.

Here is yet another 'view' -

Quoted below is an excerpt from Swami Maheshananda Giri's introduction to
the Chandogya Upanishad Bhashya, edited and published by Mahesh Research
Institute, Varanasi, 1982:

//  We have been studying the different commentators, such as Srikantha,
Ramanuja, Vallabha, Nimbarka, Baladeva, Srikara, Madhva and the moderners,
for over fifty years now.  We have seen that apart from the criticism of the
Advaita-view, there is little more in the content of their traditional view
that is not found in Shankara, or is not just a logical corollary of what he
has said.  It is our challenge that apart from logic-chipping, not a single
spiritual fibre, which has not been either supported or contradicted by
Shankara, can be shown in the works of these commentators.  All the
statements of the other commentators about God, are melted down in the
crucible of the concept of Saguna Brahman of Shankara.  The concept of
Brahman of Srikantha and Ramanuja is practically identical with Shankara's
concept of Ishwara, and they rarely try to contradict it.  Similarly,
Shankara's concept of Virat or Sutratman takes care of Madhva, Vallabha and
others.  Thus, what they contradict is the range outside their vision.  Had
they been true traditionalists, they would have presented different facets
of the same Truth which Shankara had presented.  When it comes to present a
positive aspect of the spiritual Being, they have little to say, though they
roar to assert what it is not.  This gives the lie to their having received
a different unbroken tradition.  ......but the traditionalist that Shankara
was, he never criticised or disowned the views of Virat, Hiranyagarbha or
Ishwara.  He rather developed complete harmony between them.  Thus, without
any fear of contradiction, we can say that Shankara's is THE Hindu
tradition. //


And another view:

Bhagavan Ramana Maharshi is reported to have said that all the three
schools, Advaita, VishiShTAdvaita and Dvaita have one teaching in common:
the transcending of the ego of the jiva. When this is accomplished, the
other details hardly matter.
