The Valmiki Ramayana itself does not contain the story  told by Bhagavan
Ramana.  The report I have provided mentions this incident 'as depicted by
Valmiki'.  Also, in the Ramayana itself there is a statement of Rama, when
reminded of his true nature by Brahma:

AtmAnam mAnuSham manye Ramam DasharathAtmajam

[I consider Myself a human, named Rama, the son of Dasharatha]
