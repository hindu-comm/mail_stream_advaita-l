I will attempt some answers to your queries:

There can be two answers to the above:

1. Madhvacharya (as an aside, it is Madhva and not Madhava) was not
self-realized (in an advaitic sense)

2. This one is more difficult to understand, but strictly speaking
Advaita is not a view. Other schools that have a view (that the Atman
is such and such), whereas Advaita imposes no view on what the Atman
is. Since the Atman in Advaita-Vedanta transcends qualities and
limitations (space-wise, time-wise, object-wise, etc), it is
trans-conceptual and there can be no view on what the Atman is. Hence,
as Gaudapada says, Advaita is avirodha to all other schools which have
a view on what the Atman is.
