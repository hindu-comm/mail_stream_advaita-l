It isn't a view. To claim that it is a view is an objectification of
the Atman, a continuation of the "prison" called ontological thinking.

"Transcendence" has to be properly understood.

There is no claim. For there to be a claim, there has to be an entity
that claims and another entity about which a claim is being made,
apart from the claim itself. That one can make a claim at all is the
fundamental delusion!
