Namaste.

Any work written be it the Brahma Sutras  by Badarayana or the Bhashya by
Bhagavatpada Shankara is essentially 'pUreSheya'.  They have been authored
by the author, a person.  Only the BMI can be an author of any work.  So,
these works are not 'apaurusheya' Shruti.  Other than BMI we can think of
only the Atman.  Atman cannot author anything as it is devoid of any action
(agency) since there is no apparatus  called the mind, intellect, sense
organs and motor organs like hands for the Atman.

We regard the above mentioned works as authored by realized persons.  Jnanam
cannot author any work; a Jnani can.
