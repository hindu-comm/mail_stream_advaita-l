Hari Om, Mahesh,

I'll try not to be repetitive, but its unlikely, and brief in my inline
reply.

I'd say a more valid question would be whether jnAni's MI played any role at
all in trying to get to the stage of jnAni or such jnAna was a 'revelation'.
If that Q has an answer, the same answer is applicable here. And I'm sure
the answer to the question lies in the definition of the adhikari of jnAna.

Continuing on the earlier point, I'd qualify this by saying that given the
nature of MI of an ajnAni, it is subject to fallibility. As for what came
from the pen of a jnAni, only if one were to know how to assess a jnAni!
Ergo, it was deemed best if the works are inline with shruti and other
pramANas.

For exactly the same reason that the philosophy is inline with shruti. That
shruti is the only tool available to measure cannot be overstated. We as
novices can see it because of the bhashya that shows whats is inline and
what is against the pramANas, what is valid jnAna and what is invalid, etc.
As much as you wouldn't agree if I'd instead said that we have faith in
Shankara's path, you'd have to agree that profundity of the saint doesn't
necessarily make the conclusion drawn from his path correct.

For the plain simple reason, again, that it agrees with shruti. But yes,
philosophy is still a path, but one that is about the whole truth, not a
partial one. :)

Many of Shankaracharya's works show that the purvapakshin has erred on
something which seems so simple after we understand that. Why didn't they
see it is not very convincing there either. The entire advaita vedanta
tradition insists on shrotriya guru for this very reason. With many people
from many walks having 'revelations' would otherwise drag us in umpteen
directions.

My view is that advaita vedanta path, at least, is timeless.

I reckon I have been repeating that shruti is the measure by which anything
in the tradition is measured to be true. That being the point, I rest the
case.
