There was a question: Krishnaavataara is considered as  complete in all
respects. Bhagavaan left the body due to an arrow which is considered as the
result of killing Baali in Ramavathaara. How will you explain this?
Krishna does not leave the body. He ascended with his chariot and even
weapons. This is how it is described in Bhagavatham.

What is the sastra pramana for saying "his death" was karmic reaction due to
killing Vali? Ramayana explains why there is no sin on the part of Lord Rama
in this context.
