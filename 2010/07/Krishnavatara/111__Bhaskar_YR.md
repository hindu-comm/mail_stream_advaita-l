Krishna does not leave the body. He ascended with his chariot and even
weapons. This is how it is described in Bhagavatham.

Hare Krishna

Krishna after being hit by the arrow left his mortal coil & arjuna 
performed the last rites on the pArthiva shareera of Sri Krishna & after 
this avatAra samApti of krishna yAdava-s engaged themselves in notorious 
'yAdavi kalaha'...
