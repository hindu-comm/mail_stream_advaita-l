This website has questioned Brahmanas today. Have they become Sudras?
http://gosai.com/writings/the-ontological-position-of-the-vaishnava-over-the-brahmana

A is a Brahmin settled in USA. He has crossed ocean and he is working
for foreigners. Sudra Vrutti.
B is white American come to India and doing devotional service in Iskcon temple.
C is Indian non dvija doing devotional service in Iskcon temple.

How is A better than B and C? Iskcon says B and C are converted to
Brahmanas but  A converted to Sudra.

Any counter arguments from learned members ?

Regards

-Venkatesh
