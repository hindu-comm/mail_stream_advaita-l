I am of the opinion that our shastras -that part of the code of conduct for 
day to day living -can not be applied to now a days work situations -say a 
Brahmanan has to wear panchakacham and uthariyam,perform agnihothram, should 
have just enough clothes only to sustain himself -say only a pair of 
dresses-perform rituals like yathra dhanam every time one goes on a tour 
etc.May be you are aware of these things .If you may ask for Vedic 
references which I do not have readily but these are followed by the 
priestly class only may be with exceptions.Our shastras are well founded and 
they will definitely give sukham if they are followed verbatim ,no doubt 
about it.But in these days of changed in  value system they-the 
guidelines/injunctions regarding day to day life are difficult to follow if 
not impossible.This was my point.Idid not mean they are obsolete.I rest with 
these observations just to remove any misunderstanding regarding application 
of our shastras to good living.R.Krishnamoorthy.
