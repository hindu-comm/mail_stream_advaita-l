Gunas cannot be inherited.  True ones environment can influence but e.g. 
Prahlad surrounded by Asuras in the depths of Hell still became a bhakta. 
Ashvatthama in the most learned of Brahmana families still became a 
villain.

It was their choices and conduct that gave them their gunas.

Not a good argument.  Many things have to be accepted at the barrel of a 
gun.  That doesn't make them right.
