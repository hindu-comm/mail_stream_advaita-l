If this is so then our shastras are mere fossils and we should abandon 
them for something more worthwhile.

But they are as relevant today as ever.  The phenomena is not even 
particularly new as the same questions would have arisen in the Muslim era 
or even after Alexander the Great and the Greeks.

Being a Brahmana or not is to do with the body.  The whole point of Brahma 
jignasa is to go beyond this limited identification.  You are not doing 
the searchers of Truth/Brahman any favors by mixing them up with 
Brahmanas.  That is not pragmatic at all.
