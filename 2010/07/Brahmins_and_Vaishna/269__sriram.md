Dear Members
I think we are all digressing too much.There is no end to such discussions 
as we can not apply our Sastras to these new phenomena which are bound to 
happen as time passes.We have to be pragmatic and say that anyone who is 
after search of Truth/Brahman is a Brahmanan.R.Krishnamoorthy.
