Dear All,

We are trying to explore the idea of having lectures on advaita vedanta
using teleconferencing services from Chennai.  This will cover one text at a
time and lectures will be provided by eminent scholars. Sri Sri
Sundararamanji  (Chennai)  is willing to help us and guide this venture.
This is a not for profit venture and the main goal is give access to
interested students and have some formal instruction/grounding in vedanta.


If you are interested, can you please fill out the following survey.

Thanks in advance for your kind help.

With best wishes,
Ravi
