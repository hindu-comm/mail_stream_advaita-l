None of the names, as far as I see, have any characteristics of Parvati...
Bhavani, Haimavati, Parvati, Dakshayani, Sati, etc.

Well, when I look for conclusive evidence, I usually want something that
will convince the critical/skeptical opponent, if possible (I am not saying
I am one). Critics/Skeptics may say that Lalita Sahasra Nama does not have a
commentary before 17th Century which is pretty recent, plus Sri Satish
recently told on this thread that the text is of tantric origin and was
appended to a Purana later.

The same problem is with Krtis written after 17th Century.
