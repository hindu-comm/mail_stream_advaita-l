It is mistake to see difference in Gods. God is One only. They call
one God as different Gods. Ekam Sat.

Some people say Siva puja is good for Brahmins. For Kshatriyas Vishnu
is good. He took birth as Kshtariya in avatars.  For Vaisyas Lakshmi
Devi is good. She gives wealth for business. For others Ganesha is
good. But  Brahmins and all others can do puja for all Gods including
Ganesha,Siva, Sakti, Vishnu and others. But ony dvijas can say Veda
mantras in puja. Others must say Purana mantras if they know it.
