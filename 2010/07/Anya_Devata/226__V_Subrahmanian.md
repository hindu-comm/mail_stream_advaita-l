In the Srimadbhagavatam, Krishnavataram, there is the mention of the birth
of Yoga Maya, a girl child to the / a wife of Nandagopa.  This child was
brought to Mathura where Devaki-Vasudeva were imprisoned.  Kamsa tried to
kill this girl baby.  The girl flew up from Kamsa's grips and revealed that
She would be worshiped in the world with these names:

durgeti bhadrakALi iti vijayaa vaiShNavi iti cha |
kumudA chaNDikA kRShNA madhavee kanyaketi cha ||
mAyA nArAyaNI cha IshAnA shaaradEtyambiketi cha |  10.2.11 - 12

Could these names, Durga, etc., be associated with PaarvatI, the consort of
Shambhu, Shiva?

And in this birth She is shown as born to KrishNa' s forster father
Nandagopa.

Can we not conclude that She is Krishna's sister in this case?

The Lalita Sahasra Nama has this one name for the Mother:  PadmanAbha
sahodarI (280 / 281).

Here, in this famous song by MuthaiaH Bhagavatar, the word: rAma sahodarI
occurs:


*Himagiri Thanaye*

*Pallavi*
Himagiri thanaye hemalathe amba
Eeshwari sreeLalithe mamava

*Anupallavi*
Ramavanisamsevitha sakale
Rajarajeshwari* ramasahodari *

*Charanam*
Paashaankushe ashadanda hare amba
Paaraathpare nijabhakta pare
Ashambare hari kesha vilase
Aanantha roope amrutha prathape
