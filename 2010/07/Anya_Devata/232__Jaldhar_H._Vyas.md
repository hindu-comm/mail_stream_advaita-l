Amarasinha is tradtionally said to have been one of the 'nine jewels' of 
the court of King Vikramaditya which would make his era c. 1st century AD.

In the amarakosha it is also said that Katyayani is a synonym of widow. 
Normally widows are thought of as being unlucky but Devi embodies Woman in 
all stages of life and is always blessing Her bhaktas in all Her forms.  (
Perhaps there might be better treatment of widows in our culture if more
people were aware of this.)

Is this so?  I think the writer might be confusing the Goddess with 
Katyayana the varttikakara on Paninis sutras who text is embedded in the 
Mahabhashya.
