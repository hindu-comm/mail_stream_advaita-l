Why based on only on bhaashhya-s? Take for example daxiNaamurti stotram and
it has a commentary by his immediate disciple Sri Sureshvaracharya
(manasollasa). Why is that not authentic?

Unlike other localized groups, Sankara sampradaya evolved in four corners
India - that was separated by great distances. I think the burden of proof
he is a vaishNava and some Sankaracharya  down the lane changed this on all
four corners should rest on those  make is accusation in the first place.
There are examples of  Sankaracharya-s composing devotional works on all
deities including vishhNu. Who changed it and when?

These kinds of discussions and accusations from vaishNavites are going on
since soc.religion.* days. Not sure, if advaita-l should cater these
question whenever a gaudiya vaishNava joins the list and posts them here.  I
feel non-advaitins and especially gaudiya vaishnava-s should limit their
participation on this list.
