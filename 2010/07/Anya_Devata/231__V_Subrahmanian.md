Namaste.

The name 'kAtyAyanI' is listed as one of the names of Parvathi in the Amara
Kosha 4. svargavargaH:

उमा कात्यायनी गौरी काली हैमवतीश्वरी । ७२,७२,७४
शिवा भवानी रुद्राणी शर्वाणी सर्वमङ्गला

अपर्णा पार्वती दुर्गा मृडानी चण्डिकाम्बिका
आर्या दाक्षायणी चैव गिरिजा मेनकात्मजा

The teekaa for the above lists all the 17 names and says these are names of
'PArvathI'

The Srimadbhagavatam 10.22 ... has the episode of Krishna stealing away the
garments of the Gopis.  The Gopis had just performed the 'kAtyAyanI vRatam'
10.22.1.  The other name 'BhadrakALI.'  also is present in the verse 10.22.6

We have just seen that the Yoga Maya that Kamsa tried to kill had mentioned
the two above names.

The DurgA sUktam of the Veda has names such as 'VaiShNavee', 'kAtyAyani' and
'kanya-kumari'  - all names we have just seen.

Amara Simha's period is said to be the 7th century.

Rukmini, just before being 'taken' away by Krishna worshipped Durga.

Mahatmyam, part of the Markandeya Purana attributed to sage Markandeya

presence was also felt in Buddhist and Jain texts and several Tantric text,
especially the Kalika Purana (10th century AD), which mentions Uddiyana or
Odradesa (Orissa), as the seat of Goddess Katyayani and Lord Jagannath . In
Hindu traditions like Yoga and the Tantra, she's ascribed to the sixth Ajna
Chakra or the 'Third eye chakra', and her blessings are invoked by
