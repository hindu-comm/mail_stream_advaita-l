The Chandi Path makes the identification explicit:

yA devI sarvabhUteShu viShnumAyeti shabdita |

sAshtAnga praNAms Sri Jaldhar vyas prabhuji
Hare Krishna

Just couple of doubts :

(a) The fifth adhyAya in saptashati says yA devI sarvabhUteShu 'jAti' 
rupeNa saMsthita..what exactly does it mean prabhuji?? 

(b) In lalitaa sahasranAma we have the verse : karAnguli nakhOtpanna 
nArAyaNa dashAkrutiH, from this we can understand that Adi mAta sri lalita 
tripura sundari is the 'cause' for nArAyaNAdi dashAvatAra, but if you see 
again durga sapta shati 12th adhyAya (!!?? not sure), we have the verse 
like : nanda gOpa gruhe jAta yashOdA garbha saMbhava, devi says here she 
will take birth in nanda gOpa's house at stays at vindhyAchala to kill 
shumbha & nishumbha and in same sapta shati we have verses which address 
devi as lakshmi (who is born during samudra maNthana), lajje, svadhe etc. 
..and in saptashati pArAyaNa we offer pooja to 'chandi' as mahAkAli, 
mahAlakshmi and mahAsarsvati svarUpiNi..How can we reconcile these purANa 
shloka-s with regards to relationship of devi to nArAyaNa??

Your humble servant
Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
