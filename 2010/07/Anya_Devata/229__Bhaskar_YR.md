So going by 
this kR^iShNa is like a son to pArvatI.. of-course trying to make such 
human 
relations for devata-s using mythological points would be absurd :-)

praNAms
Hare Krishna

You are right, if we go by the verse : karAnguli naKhOtpanna narAyaNa 
dashAkrutiHi etc. in lalita sahasranAma we have to say nArAyaNAdi 
dashAkruti-s have been eminated from finger tip of the lalitaa tripura 
sundari devi :-))

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
