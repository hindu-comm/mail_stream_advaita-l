Right but just to make sure there is no confusion let me say again that
Shankaracharya isn't saying don't worship that Vinayaka but the lesser 
vinayakas who are worshipped out of fear that they will cause trouble if 
not appeased.

The mothers of Skanda Bhagavan are the Krttikas six of the wives of the 
Saptarshis.  (Arundhati being excepted.)

In a prayoga book I have the Shodashamatrkas are named as Gauri, Padma, 
Shachi, Medha, Savitri, Vijaya, Jaya, Devasena, Svadha, Svaha, Mata, 
Lokamata, Shanti, Dhrti, Pushti, and Tushti.  They are specifically to be 
worshipped in the wedding mandapa for "avighna".
