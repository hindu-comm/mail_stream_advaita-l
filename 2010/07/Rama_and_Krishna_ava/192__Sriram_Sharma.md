Respected Shri Anandji,

Pranams.

Ramatirtha says that concealment is true (is it vishNutvAt + chAdana or
vishNutva + AccAdana? both seem to be valid. Correct me if wrong). But he
says this very importantly: "na tu Ishvarasya sammohaH sambhavati"
(definitely Ishvara cannot be deluded). Hence, the concealment is like
someone wearing a mask, not like someone who deliberately hurts his own eyes
(even temporarily).

I don't see that we are getting to a consensus anyway :-) Let me stop with
this...

Hari Smaranam
