Dear Sunil, I dont find it interesting because Sankara has commented on 700
verse Bhagavad Gita. He has specifically commented on
prajnavadamscabhashase. I rather find it painful that some unscrupulous
elements have introduced unnecessary changed to the words spoken by the lord
and understood by acharyas.

Dear friends,

Namaste,

You may find it interesting to know that the 745-verse version of the
Bhagavad Gita gives the relevant verse  of the second chapter differently.
The first half of the verse is "Ashochyaananusochanstvam
prajnaavaannaabhibhaasase", which means you are grieving for those for whom
you should not grieve and you are not talking like a wise person (although
you are wise)".

Regards,

S K.Bhattacharjya
