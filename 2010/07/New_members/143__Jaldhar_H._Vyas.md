I am a young pursuer of Vedanta and Bhakti, coming from Smartha family. We 
do not have any formal affiliations with any mutt. I have read portions of 
Bhagavatpadacharya's Bhashyas on the Prasthana Traya, Upadesa Sahasri, and 
Granthas of other Purvacharyas such as Vartikas, Tikas, Sanksepa Sariraka, 
and Gudhartha Dipika. My particular interest is on the comparitive roles of 
Bhakti and Jnana in Vedanta.
