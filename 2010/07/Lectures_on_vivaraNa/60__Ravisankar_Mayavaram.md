*Lectures on vivaraNa prameya sangraha of Sri Sri vidyaraNya swamin  by Sri
Mani Dravid Sastrigal. *



Students of Vedanta are aware of two Schools; Vivarana Prasthanam and
Bhamati Prasthanam. Dr Mani Dravid gave an introductory lecture in Tamil on
these two schools some time back which is available in the following URL

 Now we have requested him to take classes on Vivaranam and he felt that
Vivaranaprameya Sangraham  by HH Vidyaranya will be ideal text for the
purpose.

The classes will be held at 7.00 pm in Sankara Gurukulam located in
Abhiramapuram,  Chennai on every Monday and will go for an hour.The class
will be in Tamil and persons interested in attending the class are requested
to confirm by sending an e-mail to kunchithapatham at gmail.com.

Please note that the classes will be held only if sufficient audience is
available.

PS:The Xerox copy of text will be made available on payment.
