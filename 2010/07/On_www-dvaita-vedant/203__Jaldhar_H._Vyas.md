Shrivedavyasanamavalli

This is a booklet by Swami Yogananda Saraswati with the 
Shrivedavyasashtottarashatanamastotram listed above, as well as the 108 
names separated out and an English translation. It also contains a shloka 
Swami Yogananda has composed in honor of Swami Bharati Tirtha, the current 
Jagadguru Shankaracharya of Shringeri.

It is meant to be printed out in landscape format on both sides of A4 
size paper to make up a booklet by using page 1 as the cover and folding 
the remaining sheets to make the inner pages.

With the blessings of the sadguru parampara may the readers continue 
increasing in bhakti and jnana.
