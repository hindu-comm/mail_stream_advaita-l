Dear Subbu-Ji

yaaska explains the expression svaahaa, which implies the renunciation of ego, svatvahavana:

su aahaa iti vaa\, svaa vaag aaheti vaa\, svam praaheti vaa\, svahuta.m havirjuhoti iti vaa || nirukta 8\.21 ||

Namaste.

Thank you for the information. Is the pair of 'svAhA' to be uttered by the
patni Vedic ones? Is she allowed to utter them?

What is the meaning of the term 'svAhA'? Is it split as 'su + AhA'?

Regards,
