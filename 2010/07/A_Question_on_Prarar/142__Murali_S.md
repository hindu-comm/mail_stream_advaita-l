Sri Subramanianji,

Namaskarams.On the difficult question you have posed there are bound to be
many interpretations given our vasanas and the answers also depends on the
adhikara of the recipient.Still I would request you to give the
'correct',authentic interpretation as perceived by you or the
interpretations spelt out by our revered Acharyas and Jnanis of Vedanta.
