As many on the forum would know, Maanimanjari, though admitting Rudra
sambandha, portrays Adi Sankara is a very badlight. Even the tabloids
of the atheistic dravidian movement such as Nakkeeran do not come
anywhere close to the abysmal depths of Manimanjari in attacking a
tradition. Has it been countered?
