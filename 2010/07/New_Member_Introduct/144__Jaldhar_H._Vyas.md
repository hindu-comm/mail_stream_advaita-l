Haldanes scientific views were strongly influenced (for the worse in my 
opinion) by his Marxism and I don't think Hindus should give him any 
credance just because he said something complimentary about us.

perfection of any kind.  It is simply the selection of genes based on 
fitness of adaption to a particular environment.  If you were to put the 
Buddha in the middle of the ocean, He would drown.  A fish would have no 
problems.  For the purposes of living in the ocean, a fish is more evolved 
than a man.  But if you asked a fish to conquer Lanka, it would not be so 
evolved.

1. For a start, there are more than 10 named avatars.  For example there 
is a list of 24 in the Bhagavata 2nd skandha and they do not follow a 
steady progression from simple to complex.

2. Do we really want to argue that Buddha, a nastika, represents higher 
progress over Shri Rama or Shri Krshna?

3. The purpose of an avatara is not "progress" but to stop adharma from 
overwhelming dharma at a particular point in time.

I think most Hindus do support the theory of evolution but I think a 
firmer foundation can be found for it in our religion than this idea.
