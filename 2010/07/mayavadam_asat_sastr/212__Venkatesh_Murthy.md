Stop Iscon rubbish here in this group immediately. You dont insult
Advaita Parampara.  Iscon fools know only how to collect money from
people they convert even low caste people and foreigners to brahmins.
How can  these people be brahmins?  Many Vaishnavas are like that.
this is very bad. They tell all lies about Advaita because they are so
dull to understand what is Advaita. they can understand chanting Hare
Krishna.  let them chant only  not talk anything about Advaita.
