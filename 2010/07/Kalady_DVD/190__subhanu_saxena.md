Namaste all. For those who have not seen it yet, I received the link below from Swami Yogananda Saraswati , about the new DVD on Kalady. It does not yet seem to have appeared on the Amazon Sringeri website but looks worth buying. I am including Swamiji's message below to me.



Lien permettant de voir les sept premières minutes du DVD d'un nouveau 
documentaire sur Kalady à l'occasion du Centenaire de la découverte du 
lieu exact de la naissance de Sri Adi Shankara par le 33e Jagadguru de 
Sringeri Sri Saccidananda Sivabhinava Nrisimha Bharati en 1910.

In case list members are not aware, Swami Yogananda Saraswati is a French-born monk who was one of the first westerners to have taken Sannyasa Diksha in the traditional manner in 1971. He has a deep knowledge of Sanskrit and Shankara's works, and is closely associated with Sringeri, having contributed articles to Tattvaloka in the past. He composes and sings Sanskrit stotras beautifully and has translated a number of Shankara's prakarana works into English and French with commentaries. He recently translated His Holiness Jagadguru Sri Bharati Tirtha's Sarada Pancharatna Stuti into English and French, incl word for word explanations. He also composed a few years back  the 108 names of Vyasa. I plan to recite this on Guru Purnima Vyasa Pooja day. He was also instrumental in bringing the Adi Sankaracarya Sanskrit film to Europe when it was made. When I have a doubt on an aspect of the teachings, or on something I have read in Shankara, Sureswara or Gaudapada, he is one of the 2-3 people I would turn to for guidance in addition to my Guru. He is based in Kaivalya Ashrama in France.



Regards

Subhanu
