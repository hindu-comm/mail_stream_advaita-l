Sorry, if I misundertood anything. You have my apologies.

But do realize that one very rabid Hare Krishna (not saying you are one) in
alt.hindu used to claim a) that he was not a Hare Krishna (inspite of
orgainizing a mailing list for them) and b) he was not a Pat Robertson kind
of person inspite of doing exactly that.

So, being human as I am, I tend to be skeptical when someone comes singing
the same kind of tunes.
