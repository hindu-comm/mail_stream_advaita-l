Jivan mukta has sthula sarira made of pancha bhutas and sukshuma sarira made
of manas, buddhi and ahankara, remains of prarabda karma. The only
difference mind is devoid of desires and past impressions. Hence it remains
actionless or acts for the welfare off the world by Isvara sankalpa. If
there is action, it is very similar to the actions of an avatara of Isvara.
The only difference iss that avataras generally does not have a body made of
pancha bhutas but is aprakrta and not a product of karma. In both cases
(sadhana siddhas and avatara), sat cit ananda svarupan of suddha caitanyam
is unobstructed as there is no ignorance to hide it.
