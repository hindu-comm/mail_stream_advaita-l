There is absolutely no question of the sthitapraGYa having the "I-am-the-doer" idea. Read for example the gItA 5.8-9 along with the bhAShy (courtesy of the Gita Supersite http://www.gitasupersite.iitk.ac.in/ ):

5.8-9
Yuktah, remaining absorbed in the Self; tattva-vit, the knower of
Reality-knower of the real nature of Truth, of the Self, i.e., the seer of the
supreme Reality; manyeta, should think; 'na karomi eva, I certainly do
not do; kincit, anything.' Having realized the Truth, when or how should
he think? This is being answered; Api, even; pasyan, while seeing;
srnvan, hearing; sprsan, touching; jighran, smelling; asnan, eating;
gacchan, moving; svapan, sleeping; svasan, breathing; pralapan,
speaking; visrjan, releasing; grhnan, holding; unmisan, opening; nimisan,
closing the eyes. All these are to be connected with the above manyeta
(should think). For the man who has known the Truth thus, who finds
nothing but inaction in action-in all the movements of the body and
organs-, and who has full realization, there is competence only for giving
up all actions because of his realization of the nonexistence of actions.
Indeed, one who proceeds to drink water in a mirage thinking that water
is there, surely does not go there itself for drinking water even after
knowing that no water exists there!

Krishna stresses that even minor actions like unmiShan and nimiShan does not have the imprint of the "I-am-the-doer" thought in the tattva-vit. How then can there be any trace of "I-am-the-body" in him?

I do not consider this to be a serious argument, for Sankara here only speaks to a layperson (aka "fool", who still suffers from the identification of "I-am-this-body") by stooping down to the layperson's level of thinking. This should not be held against Sankara!

An analogy may help here. A great astronomer may say in the preface of his work that he "wrote the book from sunrise to sunset for a month". But if one takes these innocent words in the sense that "the astronomer believes in the geocentric theory of the sun moving around the earth because he said the sun 'rises', which is applicable only in the geocentric model", then this is a complete misunderstanding of the astronomer's views.

There are other ways of resolving this - the sentences, the activities, etc. were all Ishvara's, with not the slightest bit of "I-am-writing-this-bhasshya" ever appearing.

Or, the activities may be going on, but still the thought "I-undergo-these-changes" will be absent in the GYAnI.
