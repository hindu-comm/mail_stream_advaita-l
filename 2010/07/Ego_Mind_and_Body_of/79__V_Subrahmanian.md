Actually, we are not disagreeing at all on this.  I have never stated that
the Jnani will have, in the same way an ajnAni has, either the doership idea
or the body-identification.  What I have said, however,is that the Jnani
does not deny anything happening.  Ner does he deny the existence of the
body-mind apparatus, although seemingly they do.  Shankaracharya's own words
are there in the BSB 4.1.15 which we have seen enough number of times.

It is indeed a strong argument to show that the Jnani does engage in work,
although without the doership identification to the Atman.  He need not make
any such pretences to satisfy or make a 'fool' understand.  Nor is Shankara
stooping down to a layperson's level.  He is only calling a spade a spade.
We cannot close our eyes to the fact.  Does not the Gita verses you have
quoted acknowledge that the senses act in the field of the objects?  When
the Jnani uses the 'I' he knows very well that it is the ego of the anAtma,
a part of the body-mind apparatus that does engage in action. While teaching
his disciples, will not the Jnani use the words: 'Yes, I see your point, but
you have to see the subtle difference here'.  What harm is there if the
Jnani says so?  Surely, he is not referring to the Atman when he uses the
'I'.  He is referring to the teacher, a role that he has donned.  Krishna
even asks the Jnani to engage in lokasangraha work.  He is not asking the
Jnani to get bound in samsara.  He knows how a Jnani will engage in work
without getting attached.  I am not 'holding Shankara's words against
Shankara' as you seem to suggest.  I am not making any accusation or
allegation against a Jnani.  I am only seeing Shankara's words in the most
objective way, the way Shankara Himself has taught in the Bhashya.

This analogy only serves to prove my point that the Jnani knows the clear
distinction between the vyAvahArika and the pAramArthika.  When Shankara
writes the Bhashyam He knows very well that it is in the vyAvahArika.  He is
the one who said the entire Upanishadic authority functions in the realm of
avidya.  Where is the doubt that He does not hold His own bhashya to be in
that realm?  I have not suggested that Shankara believes in the absolute
reality of the vyavaharika.  Hence, the conclusion of the above analogy does
not apply to the case on hand.   On the other hand it would be wrong to
close our eyes to the clear instances of Shankara referring to Himself in
the first person, just as Bhagavan does in the Gita.

It is not difficult for Shankara to say in plain words 'This Bhashya is all
the activity of Ishwara'.  In fact it is the foregone conclusion of
Shankara, on the lines of Bhagavan, that all actions - saattvik, raajasik
and taamasic - is by prakRiti, maayaa, alone. And Ishwara is none other than
Brahman in association with Prakriti.  Atman has no role in this excepting
being the adhishThanam.  And, as I have clarified earlier, the 'I' is not
the Atman here.  It is the ego that belongs to the anAtman.

Sri Vidyaranya in the Panchadashi has clarified that the Jnani will have the
dexterity to shift, toggle, between the body-mind and the Atman depending
upon the need whether it is vyavahara or paramaartha.  When saying 'I am
hungry', he will refer to the body by the 'I'. Is there a rule that a Jnani
should never say 'I am hungry or I am tired'? While engaged in deep
contemplation of the Atman he will refer to the Atman by the word 'I' (
Shuddho'ham, buddho'ham,  sarvo'ham...)  And Shankara is doing exactly that
while He uses the 'I'.  While it is definitely possible for one to write a
commentary without ever bringing in the 'I', the first person reference,
Shankara chooses to make that reference in a number of places in the
Bhashyam literature.  That is the most natural way the Jnani in vyavahara
functions.  Krishna does that throughout the Gita.  It will be most
artificial, unnatural, to expect a Jnani to never use the 'I' in vyavahara.

This is not at all disputed.  My endeavour has been to highlight the
specific use of the 'I' by Shankara and explain it.
