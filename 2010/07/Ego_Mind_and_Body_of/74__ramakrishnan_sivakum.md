Pranaam to all members.
As far as the words of Jnanis are concerned we are no were to asses the
validity of it.
They are in a state quite indiscribable and incomprehensible by an anjaani.
There is a story of a frog that got into a well from  sea and trying to
describe the frogs inside the well how wast is the sea.From this story
arises the word *Koopamandookam*
*Mahaathma words has to be understood only after considering the competency
of the hearer,time,place,purpose,etc.which generally not known from the mere
words quoted.*
*Hence all the words of all Mahaathma are true!*
*Namaste.
