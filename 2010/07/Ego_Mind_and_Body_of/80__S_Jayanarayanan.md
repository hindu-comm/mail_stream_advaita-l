(I received the message that I have responded to below as just a jumble of incomprehensible symbols, so I ignored it. Later, I checked out the archives and here's my reply to it.)

Let us separate the enquiry into two questions. I will always take the EGO = ahaMkAra = "I-am-this-body" idea.

Question 1: Can the GYAnI (i.e. is it possible for some GYAnI to) have an ahaMkAra?
Answer: NO.

Question 2: Can the GYAnI (i.e. is it possible for some GYAnI to) speak or act AS IF an ahaMkAra exists?
Answer: YES.

If you accept the answers to Question 1 as "NO" (Vide Gita 5.8-9), we have no disagreement. Otherwise, we definitely have a disagreement.

If you hold that the GYAnI can have the ahaMkAra (NOT merely act or speak as if an ahaMkAra exists), I would like you to provide a strong authoritative quote to that effect.
