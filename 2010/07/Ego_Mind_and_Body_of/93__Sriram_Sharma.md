Dear Mr. Balasubramanian,

No one is trying to proselytize. The point of my post was that Ishvara could
not be deluded, and it did not happen in the case of any avatars.

//

Don't think you can dish out stuff
insulting our acharyas coating it with the usual prabhujis, etc., and expect
us not to get annoyed.
//

Where did I insult any Acharya? I addressed all of them like Srimad
Ramatirtha, Sri Bhagavatpada, Sri Vidyaranya etc.

//
If Hare-Krishnas want to come here and actually learn stuff that's fine.
First please look up the archives, though.
//

I am not a Hare Krishna. If I was, I would never have addressed the Acharyas
as Acharyas.

//
Pat Robertson kind of stuff
becomes unpalatable very quick - it's best saved for accosting people in LA
or SF airports, etc.
//

Mud slinging again-- where did I post Pat Robertson kind of stuff???

Hari Smaranam,

SS
