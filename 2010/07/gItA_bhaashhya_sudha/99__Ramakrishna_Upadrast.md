##Threre is no other conscious being apart from the one Deity -- who
is the witness of all as the absolute Consciousness, and who in
reality has no contact with any kind of enjoyment -- therefore there
is no other enjoyer. Hence, in this context, the question, "For what
purpose is this creation?", and its answer are baseless -- in
accordance with the Vedic text, "Who know (It) truly, who can fully
speak about this here? From where has this come? From where is this
variegated creation? (3.54.5, 10.129.6 (RV nAsadIya sUktaM))"##


(To be continued.)
