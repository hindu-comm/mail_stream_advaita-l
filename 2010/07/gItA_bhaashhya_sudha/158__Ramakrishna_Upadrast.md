##j~naanadiipena, with the lamp of Knowledge , in the form of
discriminating comprehension; i.e., bhaasvataa, with the luminous lamp
of Knowledge -- fed by the oil of divine grace resulting from
devotion, fanned by the wind of intensity of meditation on Me, having
the wick of the intellect imbued with the impressions arising from
such disciplines as celibacy etc. in the receptacle of the detached
mind, placed in the windless shelter of the mind withdrawn from
objects and untainted  by likes and dislikes, and made luminous by
full Illumination resulting from the practise of constant
concentration and meditation. [Who says there is no poetry in
bhaashhya literature?]##
