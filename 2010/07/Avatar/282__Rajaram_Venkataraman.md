According to Advaita Vedanta,

1. Does avatar refer to the name and form of the body of lord (e.g. Krishna)?
2. Are the names and forms unmanifest before His appearance?
3. Do the names and forms become unmanifest again after His disappearance?

If the answer to the above questions is yes, then what about Lord
Krishna's opinion "avyaktam vyaktim apannam manyaate abuddhaya:  (BG
7.24)?"
