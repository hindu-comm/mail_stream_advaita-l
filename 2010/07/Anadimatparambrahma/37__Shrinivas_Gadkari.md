Namaste Shri Vidyasankar,

For my own study, I have been trying to arrive at an understanding where
I can make good sense of 15.16, 15.17 and 8.3 and then whole of gItA.

The term "akSara" is not an adjective, but denotes very highlevel entity 
(tattva)
in the 8th chapter of gItA,and perhaps the entire Gita and perhaps also in the
main upanishads.

For quite sometime I was trying to base my understanding on "param brahma = 
uttama puruSa".
But 8.3 very clearly equates param brahma = akSara, and then 15.16, 15.17
does not make sense.

Now I am exploring akSara = Adi mAyA, to see if consistent reading of gItA can
be obtained. So far it seems to be okay. As mentioned in the last post, this
does make param brahma subbordinate to uttama puruSa. But I do not see
that as a major issue (so far).

Note: The initial concept of "akSara = mAyA" is directly from sankara bhaAshya 
on 15.16.

Regards,
Shrinivas
