If vandhyA can have putra, I mean cause of the effect, non existing avidya 

can be the cause of the effect prarabdha, in your above cited case.

praNAms 
Hare Krishna

They have the 'avidyAlesha' or prArabdha karma phala earned during the 
pre-realization period  as the cause to get the vyAsAdi janma as per the 
order of Ishwara, that is the answer you may get...Anyway, who is this 
vyAsa here?? is he not an avatAra of mahA vishNu??  is this vyAsa is not 
the krishna dvaipAyana vyAsa in  vyAsAya vishNurUpAya vyAsarUpAya 
vishNave?? just curious to know :-))

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
