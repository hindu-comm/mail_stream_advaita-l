It is not avatara, if you are in that impression.  He is a jiva, mukta, now
taken a body, and after the expiry of the prArabdha karma will be finally
liberated.  He will not have kartrutva / bhoktrutva bhaava then.

For that matter, all jivas, when punarjanma is there, in avidyAvasthA, are
said to be incarnating every time.  That is why they say 'Hinduism believes
in re-incarnation.'   Vyasa's case is no different in as much as another
body is taken and lived out.  The only difference is that in this case
avidya / ajnana is not the cause of the new incarnation; it is the command
of Ishwara.
