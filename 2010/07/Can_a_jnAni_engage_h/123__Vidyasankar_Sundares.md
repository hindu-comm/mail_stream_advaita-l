Strictly speaking, a jnAnI does nothing. The question of doing what they are
not supposed to does not even arise. Nor does the question of doing what
they are supposed to do! Because they are not supposed to do anything.

Where is it said that diti was another jnAnI? I'm curious to know. For that
matter, how can there be "another" when all jnAnI-s are supposed to be 
the same, even in vyavahAra?

Through what does a jnAnI feel that even SAstravihita karma is a big burden?


Best regards,

Vidyasankar



ps. I have not responded to earlier mails on jnAna and jnAnI because of lack
of time and because you asked me not to respond. However, the same topics
will no doubt keep coming up again and again.
