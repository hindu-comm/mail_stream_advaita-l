Here are some details about Kashyapa :

Kashyapa Prajapati is spoken of in the AruNa prashna of the Taittiriya
Aranyaka 1st prapAThaka, 8th anuvAka. At the end of this the mantra is:
क्श्यपः पश्यको भवति ।यत्सर्वं परिपश्यतीति सौक्ष्म्यात् । ८.

Kashyapa is the 'seer'.  Since he knows everything that is the past and the
future through his divine vision that is extremely subtle. [SayaNa bhAshyam]

He is also called the eighth SUrya, the earlier seven sUrya-s having
emanated from him.

Here is a relevant portion of the story of Kashyapa Prajapati taken out from
the Bhagavatam, with references:
