Let us set aside the side-issue of the meaning of the English word 
"reincarnation".

The Rshi of Ishopanishad Dirghatamasa Gotama (Apantaratamasa is a synonym) 
was said to be blind.  This was possibly a result of some past karma of 
his.  When he was born as Vedavyasa, it was not an avatara of Dirghatamasa 
nor was it reincarnation in the normal sense (as a result of 
kartrtva/bhoktrtva) but only at Ishwaras command.  So neither can we call 
him a jivanmukta either.

The Vishnupurana mentions 28 Vedavyasas of different yuga-chakras of which 
the current Parasharya Vyasa is only one.  (To muddy the waters a bit, it 
and other puranas also mention Vyasa as an avatara of Vishnu Bhagavan 
which is not discussed in Brahmasutrabhashya.)
