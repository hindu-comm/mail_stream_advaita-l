Although Bhaskar ji did not specify Veda Vyasa who fathered PAndu,
DhritarAshtra and Vidura, in the list, here is an observation on your above
message:

In the Brahmasutra Bhashya it is said:

Yavadadhikaramavasthitiradhikarikanam III.3.32 (391)

[Of those who have a mission to fulfil (there is corporeal) existence, so
long as
the mission is not fulfilled.]

apAntaratamo nAma muniH kali-dvApara-sandhau vyAsatvena sambabhUva - a sage
named 'apAntaratamas' incarnated in the confluence of Kali and dvApara
yuga-s with the name / position of 'vyAsa'.

Shankaracharya says Vyasa / apaantaratamas was a 'samyagdarshi' in this
bhashyam.

Accordingly, the birth as Veda VyAsa in the Mahabharata context is not 'Adya
janma'; the earlier janma being as the muni named 'apAntaratamas'.  And it
is decided that these get this position only owing to  their karma/merits.
