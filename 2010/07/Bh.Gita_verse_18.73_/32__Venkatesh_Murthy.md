I will not agree with a process of Jnana start in one asrama and end
in another asrama.

For argument let it be.

If Jnanotpatti is start and brahmasamstha is end it must surely be
moksha. Above statement from you is you agree moksha is in sanyasa
only. But non dvijas cannot be sanyasis in Sankara Matha. they cannot
get moksha in this life. I wrote this earlier also.
