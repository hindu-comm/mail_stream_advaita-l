To tell you the truth the idea that there were 745 verses in the 
"original" Bhagavadgita is only of academic interest at this point.  Our 
parampara hand countless sadhakas through the centuries have only 
considered the Gita we have now with 700 verses to be authoritative and I 
don't see why that should change now.
