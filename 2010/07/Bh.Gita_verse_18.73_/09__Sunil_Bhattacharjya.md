Vajrasoochika upanishad says that the birth does not make one brahmana., There are more requirements. Also please do not forget that the low-borm Satyakaam also became brahmin and you must be knowing that. So thereply to the questioncan not be a simplistic one.

Dear Sir,
How can a man in the middle of samsara with his wife and children and
many attachments to money, house car food get moksha? It is like
catching the crocodile tail to cross a river. It cannot be done.
even one attachment is enough to prevent moksha what is the fate if
there are many. sanyasa is a must to study vedanta properly and get
moksha.

The crocodile caught Adi Sankara. It left him after mother promised he
can become sanyasi. This story tells sanyasa is very very important.

Women and non brahmins cannot become sanyasi. Therefore no moksha.
To solve this problem they can study puranas and Gita. Then they get
chance formoksha by getting born as brahmins.

If all can get moksha how are brahmins better? This is meaningless.
Only brahmins have all the samskaras and background. others dont have
it. Only sanyasi can study vedanta.

Vedanta is serious study. no purana type stories or anything. But
puranas have lot of entertainment.
