Dear Sir,
How can  a man in the middle of samsara with his wife and children and
many attachments to money, house car food get moksha? It is like
catching the crocodile tail to cross a river.  It cannot  be done.
even one attachment is  enough to prevent  moksha what is  the fate if
there are many. sanyasa is a must to study vedanta properly and get
moksha.

The crocodile caught Adi Sankara. It left him after mother promised he
can become sanyasi. This story tells sanyasa is very very important.

Women and non brahmins cannot  become sanyasi.  Therefore no moksha.
To solve this problem they can study puranas and Gita. Then they get
chance for   moksha by getting born as brahmins.

If all can get  moksha how are brahmins better?  This is meaningless.
Only brahmins have all the samskaras and background.  others dont have
it. Only sanyasi can study vedanta.

Vedanta is serious study. no purana type stories or anything. But
puranas have lot of  entertainment.
