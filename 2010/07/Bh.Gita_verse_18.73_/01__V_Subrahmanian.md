Dear Sir,

For your first question the reply is:  There is no count.  When we say
'known' the knowledge must be having a source.  Again 'known' history is
also very vague and could have a very large range.  So, there would be no
way we can take a count.

For your second question the reply is:  ajnAna is anAdi.  Samsara is anAdi.
The Veda is anAdi.  The purpose of the Veda is to remove ajnAna, the cause
of samsara.  So, ajnAna is anAdi.

Regards,
subbu
