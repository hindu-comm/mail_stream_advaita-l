It seems that by sannyasa we mean two different things.  I'm talking about 
renunciation of all limited, material things.  You are talking about 
kesari clothes, danda, kamandalu etc.

yet there is historical and contemporary evidence that they have done so 
in the Dashanami tradition and with the permission of Mathadhipatis.  Even 
if it were not so, anyone can give up material things.
