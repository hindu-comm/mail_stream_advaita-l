This is from my side. The crocodile catching Adi Sankara and leaving
when the mother promised he will become sanyasi. this is very
important for Smarthas. Moksha is got after sanyasa only. not from
Gruhastha and other stages directly.

The great King Bharatha story is very important. He had only one
attachment to a deer. He did not get Moksha. He was born in brahmin
family in the next birth. He was Jada bharatha. He got moksha.
