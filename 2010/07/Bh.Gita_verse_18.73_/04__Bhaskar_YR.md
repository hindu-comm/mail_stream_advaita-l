Bhaskarji's questions are discussed in detail there. There is no absurdity 
in the discussions in the battle-field.

praNAms 
Hare Krishna

Kindly note I am not seeing any absurdity in the discussion on battle 
field...I was asking counter questions to Sri Murthy prabhuji who was 
saying that there was no vedAnta jnAna in geeta it is ONLY karma jnAna...

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
