Dear Jaldharji,

Shri Venkatesh Murthyji had conveniently ignored my mail, where I showed that Vidura's biological father was none other thann Vedavyasa, who also had low-born mother. How can one call Vidura a non-dvija?

Regards,

Sunil k. Bhattacharjya

The point is whatever they did or did not do in previous janmas, they got jnana in their shudra janmas. And Shankaracharya has no problem with stating that. So why be unnecessarily strict about it?

Percentages are not relevant. All that needs to be proved is that it is possible (and I think you concede that it is) Then we leave it to individual effort and Bhagavans krpa.

Leaving aside the hot lead in the ears thing which is hyperbole, it is true that they have no adhikara to learn Vedas. But the point you are missing is that itihasa-purana _also_ contain Vedanta. And this is not Taiwanese imitation Vedanta, it is the genuine article!

I must admit this is an unusual role to find myself in :-)

No he said they cannot study Vedas to get Brahmavidya. This is not in doubt.

He can't get brahmavidya with sandhyavandana either. Jnana is orthogonal to karma.

Here are his exact words:

"To those in whom as a result of previous good samskaras, such as Vidura and Dharmavyadha, jnana arises, the acquisition of its fruit cannot be denied since jnana always brings about its own fruit. [The rule] "He should teach the four varnas" indicates that all four varnas are qualified for the knowledge of itihasa-puranas according to smrti."

Widowers are given as an example but to provide for them only is not the purpose of this sutra. ("But also those who stand between for it is seen")

The key passage from the bhashya is:

antarA chApi tu anAshramitvena vartamAno.api vidyAyAmadhikriyate | kuta.h |
taddR^iShTe.h vAchaknavIprabhR^itInAmevaMbhutAnAmapi brahmavitvashrutyupalabdhe.h ||

"even a person who by not now belonging to an Ashrama 'stands between', as it were, is qualified for getting brahmavidyA. Why? 'For it is seen' in the cases of those of that type such as raikva and vAchaknavi who became brahmavids as shown in shruti."

Now Raikva was a widower but Vachaknavi was an unmarried girl in the court of Videha. Doesn't that contradict your argument?

> A Gruhastha cannot directly get Brahmavidya.

This will come as a shock to Maharshi Yajnavalkya who was not only a grhastha but had two wives! Yet he is also called a jnani in Shruti and Advaita Vedanta accepts this without reservation. Now it is true that upon enlightennment he immediately abandoned worldly life. Jnana and sannyasa are inextricably linked but sometimes the sequence is sannyasa -> jnana, other times it is jnana -> sannyasa. Neither invalidates the idea that jnana can arise in any ashrama or none.
