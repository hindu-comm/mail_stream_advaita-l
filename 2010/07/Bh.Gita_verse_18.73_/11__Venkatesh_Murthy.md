One rule for Sankara other rule for us. This is not correct.  sanyasa
is important for all. If Gruhastha stops doing Sandhyavandana and
other duties thinking I will be sanyasi he is cheating. He is not
following his Gruhastha duty and not sanyasi duty also. He becomes a
sinner. He cannot claims to be sanyasi living happily with his wife.

See above argument I have made.  Same applies here. Answer this
question. Can Gruhastha be karma sanyasi? If yes he is not following
his dharma.  He is sinner.  In Gita Krishna  also says the same.
