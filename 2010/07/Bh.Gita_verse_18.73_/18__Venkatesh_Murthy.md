This is not correct.  Adi Sankara said Vidura and Dharmavyadha had
good samskaras from previous janma. the result of this was jnana in
the non dvija janma.  They were exceptions only probably 0.0000001% or
less of all people. All non dvijas cannot be like them. they are
disqualified from learning Brahmavidya

In the smrutis it is written hot lead should be filled in ears of any
sudra or lower caste who hears the vedas. How can they hear vedanta?
It is totally wrong and false propaganda by enemies of Vaidika
religion.

Adi Sankara said non dvijas cannot get Brahmavidya in Brahma sutra
1.3.38 This is correct position. A brahmin who does not do
sandhyavandana is treated like a sudra only. He cannot get
Brahmavidya.

Adi Sankara did not write nondvija will get moksha from non vedanta.
You can check BSB. Where did he write  it? He wrote only they are
eligibile to hear itihasa puranas. The correct point is they will be
born as  brahmins in their next janma by hearing the itihasa puranas.

No. Adi Sankara wrote this for widowers. They cannot do yagas without
a wife. But they can do japa and worship the gods. It means they can
take sanyasa and become eligible for Brahmavidya. this is written in
3.4.36. he did not write Gruhasthas and others can directly get
Brahmavidya without sanyasa. Where did he write it? Please check.

A Gruhastha cannot directly get Brahmavidya. where Adi Sankara wrote
he can?  he must take sanyasa first. otherwise he cheats thinking I am
a great Jnani living with my family. Who can cross sea of samsara
holding a crocodile tail?
