Dear Jaldharji,

Yes the sanctity of the version with the 700 time-honoured verses remain intact. Yes, some of the academicians alone may be interested in the rare verses. For example here is another rare verse , which when trtanslated, would read as follows:

"Just as the Sun consumes all types of essences and the fire is omnivorous so also the yogi enjoys all the sense objects but being pure he is not involved either in meritorious or in sinful actions."

The action of a yogi may appear to be improper in the eyes of the common man, yet his actionmay not be considered sinful. Suka was stark-nakedyet his ways were acceptable.

Regards,

Sunil K. Bhattacharjya

To tell you the truth the idea that there were 745 verses in the "original" Bhagavadgita is only of academic interest at this point. Our parampara hand countless sadhakas through the centuries have only considered the Gita we have now with 700 verses to be authoritative and I don't see why that should change now.
