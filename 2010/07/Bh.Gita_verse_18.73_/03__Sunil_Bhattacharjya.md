Dear friends,

Namaste,

My book giving the translation and commentary on the Original Bhagavad Gita containing 745 verses,is soon going to press. Bhaskarji's questions are discussed in detail there. There is no absurdity in the discussions in the battle-field.

I shall also request Bhaskarji to see the beginning of the Bhagavatam, where Vedavyasa says that he composed the Mahabharata to give the Vedic messages to the Shudras and the women through that but he did not entirely succeed. He was sad because of that. Then Narada advised him to compose the Bhagavatam (where Krishnastu bhagavan svayam", to cater to that need.

Regards,

Sunil K. Bhattacharjya

Dear Sir,

There will be exceptions.Recently some 14 year boy is doing a post
graduate course. He is a genius. Every 14 year boy is genius? No
probably 0.1% of boys will be like him. 99.9% are ordinary kids. Can
they do post graduate study. they must study slowly only and reach
post graduate course.

In Kruta yuga and others it was easy. Now sanyasis only can get
moksha directly. For others it is indirectly. they must take new janma
to get it.

Krishna is God. But Arjuna could not protect those wives after all
Yadavas passed away. Why?

Gita is not a part of Vedanta but it is a part of Mahabharata. It can
be read by non dvija people and women. We can compare a newspaper
report on bio technology and text book on the same. The newspaper
report is also good and can lead interested people to text book. But
it is not same as text book study.

News paper report is for any body who can read. And people read news
paper report with all the other news which contains lot of masala like
politics, sports and films. In Mahabharata also there is filmy masala
like fighting and love stories. The text book for serious students.
They must have some qualifications. If others read text book they
will not understand.

In 6th chapter of Gita Krishna says anybody on the right path never
falls down. He will take janma in brahmin family and continue on his
path. This surely happens.

Agreed we want answers to all the questions.

I read one mail where it is said Arjuna is Vishnu. Then if Arjuna is
Nara avatara of Vishnu he becomes God only. The question did he have
jnana is a useless question. I assume he was a ordinary man above.
