How can  a man in the middle of samsara with his wife and children and
many attachments to money, house car food get moksha? It is like
catching the crocodile tail to cross a river.  It cannot  be done.
even one attachment is  enough to prevent  moksha what is  the fate if
there are many. sanyasa is a must to study vedanta properly and get
moksha.

>  if any one has the quality (that he would get/obtain in saNyAsa (i.e. 
viveka, vairAgya) in any ashrama then in that ashrama only he would get 
that mOksha...As I told before, the dawn of jnAna or mOkshAvasthA is not 
any vraNAshrama adheena.. 

The crocodile caught Adi Sankara. It left him after mother promised he
can become sanyasi. This story tells sanyasa is very very important.

>  in the case of shankara...but it does not mean that those who want to 
persue jnAna mArga first should get the bite from crocodile :-)) Those who 
got this jnAna in gruhasthAshrama from them pArivrAjyaM is artha siddhAm.  


Women and non brahmins cannot  become sanyasi.  Therefore no moksha.
To solve this problem they can study puranas and Gita. Then they get
chance for   moksha by getting born as brahmins.

>  Kindly see apashudrAdhikaraNa in shankara's sUtra bhAshya...

If all can get  moksha how are brahmins better?  This is meaningless.
Only brahmins have all the samskaras and background.  others dont have
it. Only sanyasi can study vedanta.

>  I do agree that ONLY sarva karma saNyAsi can approach vedAntic jnAna 
mArga meaningfully..but it does not negate the possibility of 
mOksha/vedAnta jnAna to non-dvija-s.


Vedanta is serious study. no purana type stories or anything. But
puranas have lot of  entertainment.

>  there are plenty of stories in upanishads also..how do you say these 
stories are there for serious study and in purANa-s these stories are for 
mere entertainment?? 



He must take birth in brahmin family otherwise how will become sanyasi
 and study vedanta.
