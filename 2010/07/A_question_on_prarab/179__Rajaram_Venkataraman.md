My two cents on Vidyaranya Swami's writing:

avashyambhAvi-bhogAnAm pratIkAro bhavedyadi
tadaa duHkhairna lipyeran nala-rAma-yudhiShthiraa || (panchadashi 7.156)

As an avatara, the Lord seems to subject himself to time though he is
beyond spacio-temporal bindings. In the same way, he allows, as if so
not in reality, duhkha to taint his aprakrta para maya rupam though he
is transcendental to duhkham. He does that to show that the effects of
prarabda are (almost) inevitable for us. Duhkha is specifically
mentioned because even a devout sadhaka aims to put an end to duhkha
not realizing that it belongs to body and mind - not perceived even in
susupti what to speak of turiya.
