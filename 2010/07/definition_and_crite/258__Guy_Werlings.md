Dear List members,



I apologize for having been silent for such a long time. This is due to my health.

I should like to know what is shrii BhagavatpAda's definition of Truth and what are his criteria of Truth.

Hope someone of you can help me to clarify the matter fron a strictly philosophical point of view.
