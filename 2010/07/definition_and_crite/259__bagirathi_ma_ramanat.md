Dear shri. Guy Werlings

 I think the book " What is Advaita" a book by Prof. P.Sankaranarayanan, published by Bharathiya Vidya Bhavan, kulapati K.M.Munshi Marg, Bombay - 400 007 Second Edition 1988  may clarify you questions . 

Sincerely
Mrs.Bagirathi Ramanathan

I apologize for having been silent for such a long time. This is due to my health.



I should like to know what is shrii BhagavatpAda's definition of Truth and what are his criteria of Truth.



Hope someone of you can help me to clarify the matter fron a strictly philosophical point of view.
