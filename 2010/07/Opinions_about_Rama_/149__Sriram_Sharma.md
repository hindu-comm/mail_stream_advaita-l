Pranams Shriman Anand,

My humble prostrations to your scholarliness. Also thanks for taking a note
responding to my comments.

I would be excited to read that. Kindly also consider these other pramANa-s
from other Acharyas in the sampradAya who have concurred with Ramatirtha's
view. I have given a full list of links that support this point of view
below:

Pardon me... Our paramAcArya bhagavAn bhASyakAra says in the Gita that
Isvara is "nitya-suddha-buddha-mukta" in other words, "eternally pure, wise,
and liberated". Hence, Isvara cannot even have an iota of avidya or
delusion, and cannot be deluded for even a moment (as he is "Nitya" and
"Mukta"). "na mAm karmANi limpanti" (Gita 4.14 and its bhASyas) also confirm
this.

I am aware of the Ramayana passages that you had quoted. Again to
Sarvajnatman, Ramatirtha, and others it was just His last play-acting
dialogue. On a lighter note, that is a beautiful hymn which also has a
phala-sruti. If His Lordship Rama had accepted prior to that that He was
indeed Lord Narayana, we won't have that hymn today :-)
