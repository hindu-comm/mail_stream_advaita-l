Indeed one can, but that must not be viewed in the same sense as the kind of
sectarian exclusivity exhibited by vIra-vaishNavas and vIra-saivas (I'm using
the word vIra in a fairly loose way here, to convey an attitude, not a specific
group of people). Within the post-Sankaran tradition, the number of very
important authors showing a similar 'attachment' to vishNu is significantly
high, yet the advaita vedAnta tradition is not a vaishNava tradition on the
same footing as other vaishNava traditions. The same statement would hold
true if you substitute the word Saiva for vaishNava too!
