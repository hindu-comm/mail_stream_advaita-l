vedantha in my practice. As a student of logic and Indian Philosophy I am 

interested in Indian thinking and logic aspects and more from advaithic 

approach. The logical derivation of truth with various sub-methods in 

Advaitha helps every one to think well and understand the facts much 

better to behave well in the actual society. A health soceity is created 

by healthy thinking and wellbeing of the individuals and hence the 

vedanthic study especially the sankara advaitha helps one to have a 

errorless thinking and wellbeing of one in any society. I am able to think 

logically well and understand the world reality and truth for my wellbeing 

in this soceity.
