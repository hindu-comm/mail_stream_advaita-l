  I am a practioner of counseling psychology and HRD and use advaitha 
vedantha in my practice. As a student of logic and Indian Philosophy I am 
interested in Indian thinking and logic aspects and more from advaithic 
approach. The logical derivation of truth with various sub-methods in 
Advaitha helps every one to think well and understand the facts much 
better to behave well in the actual society. A health soceity is created 
by healthy thinking and wellbeing of the individuals and hence the 
vedanthic study especially the sankara advaitha helps one to have a 
errorless thinking and wellbeing of one in any society. I am able to think 
logically well and understand the world reality and truth for my wellbeing 
in this soceity.
