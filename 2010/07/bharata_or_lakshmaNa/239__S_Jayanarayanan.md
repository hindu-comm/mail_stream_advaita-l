Email from someone who has studied the Ramayana:

"The verses in the 18th Sarga of Baalakaanda of Vaalmiki-Ramaayana state that Rama was born in Punarvasu-Nakshathra, Bharatha in Pushya (the next) and the two children (dual used) of Sumithra in Aashlesha-star (the one immediately following Pushya)."
