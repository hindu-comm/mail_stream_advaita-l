Srigurubhyo namaH

Namaste.

In the 'VAsanAkshaya prakaraNam' of the 'Jivanmuktiviveka' Sri Vidyaranya
quotes a verse from his Panchadashi:

avashyambhAvi-bhogAnAm pratIkAro bhavedyadi

tadaa duHkhairna lipyeran nala-rAma-yudhiShthiraa || (panchadashi 7.156)

[If it were at all possible to ward off unavoidable experiences, Nala, Rama
and YudhiShThira would never have been dragged into misery.]

In the above verse along with Nala and YudhiShThira why has Rama been
included?  With regard to the former two it could be said that their
prArabdha was the cause of their woes.  Did Rama too have to suffer due to
prArabdha?  Can prArabdha be admitted to an Avatara who is not admitted to
have had an 'earlier life'? Is it proper to consider Rama as a human like
the other two?

There may be many ways of answering these and many other possible
questions.  Members could come out with their views.

With warm regards,
subbu
