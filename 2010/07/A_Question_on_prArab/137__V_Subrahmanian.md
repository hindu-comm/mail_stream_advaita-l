I think it would be best to see the human element.  It becomes artificial if
it is said 'he knew but was putting up a show that he did not know'.  It is
most natural to show Rama as human yet with all the great 16 guNas
manifesting throughout the story.  In fact that is the purpose of Valmiki.
Maybe that's why he portrayed Rama as grief-stricken when Sita was
abducted.  In fact even later, while in Kishkindha, he goes into those
moods.  Valmiki inserts several such ordinary- man moods in Rama.  For
instance, on the very first day of their exit from Ayodhya, he expresses a
kind of anger on his father and sort of laments:  This situation would not
have befallen us if only Dasaratha had been wiser.  Yet later when Lakshmana
tries to curse Kaikeyi Rama admonishes him and asks him to respect her.
These on and off moods never take away the charm from Rama.  I recently
heard a talk series by Dr.S.R.Ganesh on 'Valmiki RamayaNada kelavu
svArasyagaLu'.

Thank you once again to the very informative explanation, especially from
Vedanta point of view.
