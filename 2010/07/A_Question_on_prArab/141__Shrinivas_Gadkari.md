Namaste,

Every sadguru takes on himself varying amount of negative karma of his
devotees. This is evident from charitra of many recent saints - as an example
I can cite shrI saI bAbA of Shirdi.

In fact when the deity representing our mother earth requests mahA viSNu 
to incarnate on earth to reduce the burden of negative karma of her children,
she is precisely asking him to take a share of that negative karma for himself
and burn it up by living it out.

hari om.

Regards,
Shrinivas

This a Christian doctrine, that Christ/Jesus suffered for the sins of others. A 
bad idea.
