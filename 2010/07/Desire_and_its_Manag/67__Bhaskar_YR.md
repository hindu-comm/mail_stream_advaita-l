desire management is not the technique preached in BG.

praNAms Sri Panipat Chaitanya prabhuji
Hare Krishna

Yes, infact technique preached in the BG is how to get the status of 
desirelessness...the desirelessness is what we want to achieve with 
AtmAnAtma viveka, so that the mind comes to rest and bliss dawns within 
without any external objective dependence.  That is the reason why jnAni 
is called Apta kAma..prashAtamanasaM hyenaM yOginaM sukhamuttamaM, upaiti 
shAnta rajasaM, brahma bhutaM akalmashaM..sukhena brahma saMsparshaM 
atyantaM sukhamashnute..says geetAchArya..

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
