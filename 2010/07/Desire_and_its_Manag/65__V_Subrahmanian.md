Namaste:

Viveka is the first step in cultivating vairagya.  As Viveka stregthens
vairagyam too deepens. So, presense of viveka is indeed appreciable.

'prkRti' is the other word used in the Gita and the  bhAShya for
'prArabdha': 'prakRti' (BG 3.33): 'prakRtirnaama pUrvakRta dharmaadharmaadi
samskaaraH ...'  (PrakRti / nature is the samskaara stemming from the
dharma/adharma done in the past, *now manifesting at the start of the
present birth*).

Undoubtedly these are viveka dRiShTi.  All these are covered in the verses
under consideration:  3.37, etc.

That is exactly what I mean by the term 'management'.  I certainly do not
mean:  keep the desire.  The 'managing'  is eminently taught by the Lord in
3.41:

Because desire manifests in the locus - senses, mind, intellect and deludes
the jiva's jnanam, first of all control the senses:  tasmaat tvam indriyANi
aadau niyamya...This is nothing but the method of managing the desire.  One
cannot simply pull out or expel the desire; one has to do it
systematically.  This systematic control/eradication of desire is what is
taught there.

On another count, Acharyas have taught:  Cultivating desire for the higher
goals like daivi sampat, one will simultaneously accomplish  the freeing
oneself from the clutches of the tendency for harbouring and nourishing base
desires.

Thanks for your comments.
