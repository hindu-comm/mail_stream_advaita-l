Dear friends,
According to the Original Bhagavad Gita of 745 verses the second verse of13.13 has three words at the beginning, which are : Anaadimat ParamBrahma. This means that Param Brahma is Anaadimat or the SupremeBrahman is beginningless. It appears to me that Adi Sankaracharyahad seen the Original Bhagavad Gita.
Regards,
Sunil K. Bhattacharjya

 Vasudevas is the lord of eternal jiva.


Please enlighten the list on the following : 



1. Are you reading the SAnkara bhAshya on the gItA in the original Sanskrit?
2. Are you reading a translation of the bhAshya into another language?
3. If so, whose translation are you reading?
4. Or are you reading what a completely different publication attributes to Sankara?



We can parse anAdimatparam brahma and what the bhAshya actually says about it
once your assumptions are clearer to the rest of us.



Regards,

Vidyasankar
