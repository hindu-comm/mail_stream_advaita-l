Namaste.

During the recent Shankara Jayanthi Utsavam a number of lectures were
delivered in Tamil by renowned scholars in Chennai on a variety of topics in
Advaita.  Some of these are uploaded in the following site:

At present one by Sri Mani Dravid SastrinaH on the essence of the 13th
Chapter of the Gita and one on the Naishkarmyasiddhi by Dr.N.Veezhinathan
are available.  I thank Sri Ravi Mayavaram for the help in uploading them
for the benefit of the community.
