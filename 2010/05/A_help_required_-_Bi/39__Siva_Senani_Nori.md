Sir

To my knowledge, jaatu is an avyaya meaning 'once'; it is more often used with na, as 'na jaatu' meaning not even once. Here the meaning is if one offers a saalagrama Sila (that is the linga, representing Siva) to a Vipra (who is well versed in the Vedas and Sastras), one indeed (hi) gets the same merit as performing a soma yajña. The sloka looks alright.

That said, I am not able to access the original bilvaashTakam and confirm the reading.

Best regards
Senani

Namaste.

I would like to see the correct version of this shloka from the BilvAShTakam:

साळग्रामशिलामेकां विप्राणां जातु चार्पयेत्
सोमयज्ञमहापुण्यं ह्येकबिल्वं शिवार्पणम्

What is the meaning of the word 'jaatu' here? Is it the correct word there?

Regards,
subrahmanian.v
