Dear friends,

I have two queries and shall be grateful if the h onorable members can throw some light on these. The queries are as follows:

1)
I came across a book in Assam which quotedthe English translation of a Sanskrit verse, reportedly composed by Adi Sankaracharya, just beforehe lefthis mortal frame. The passage appeared in DAWN, Vol. III, August, 1899 - 1990 (Edited by Satis Chandra Chatterjee. Reissued 2000, Jadavpur University in Association with National Council of Eucation, Bengal. p. 278)
 

The translation is as follows:

O' Lord Pardon me the three sins committed by me. I have by contmplation clothed Thee who art shapeless. I have in praise describe thee in who art indescribeable andd I have ignored Thine Omnipresence by visiting the tirthas or pilgrimages to shrines."

Kindly let me knowif Adi Sankaracharya composed any "Aparaadh Kshamaapana stotra", which contains the Sanskrit verses corresponding to the above lines.

2)
Adi Sankaracharya composed the Pada-bhashyas of the major upanishads including Kena.
But he had subsequentlycomposed a Vakya-bhashya on Kena. Has anybody among the innumaerable followers of Adi Sankaracharya through the ages explained whyAdi Sankaracharyatook that step in case of Kena and what additional message he gave in the Vakya-bhashya.

Regards,

Sunil K. Bhattacharjya
