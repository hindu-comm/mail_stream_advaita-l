Namaste.

Here is a reply to the second question above:

While commencing the gloss for the Kenopanishad VAkyabhAshya, Sri Anandagiri
says:

केनेषितमित्यादिकां......उपनिषदं  पदशो व्याख्यायापि न तुतोष भगवान्भाष्यकारः,
शारीरकैर्न्यायैः अनिर्णीतार्थत्वात् इति न्यायप्रधानश्रुत्यर्थसंग्राहकैः
वाक्यैः व्याचिख्यासुः....

An attempted translation of the above is:

// Even after writing the pada-bhAShya BhagavAn BhAShyakAraH was not happy
as the purport of the Upanishad had not been derived/established on the
lines of the rules followed in the BrahmasUtras.  Therefore with a view to
explain with the predominantly nyAya-specific sentences that bring out the
meaning of the shruti He proceeds to.... //

Those who have made a thorough study of both the bhashyam-s would be able to
summarize the 'additional message' the vAkya Bhashyam conveys.
