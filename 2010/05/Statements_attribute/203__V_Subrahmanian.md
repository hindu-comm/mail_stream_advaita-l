Namaste.

There is one 'Shiva-aparAdha-Kshamaapana stotram' attributed to
Shankaracharya and this does not contain what you have stated above.  Pl.
see the following:


http://www.ahwan.org/article44.htm

// If The Lord or the *Brahman* is to be understood only within a particular
specification, will this not go contrary to the very definition of God in *
sanAtan* philosophy at the highest level? The bedrock of the *
sanAtan*philosophy (for that matter all true spiritual philosophies)
is that, God is
without any limited adjuncts. Therefore to confine God within the framework
of any form to begin with, is contradictory. So much so that one of our
famous prayers goes like this: The seeker laments:

*Rupam rupavivarjitasya bhavato dhyAnena yatkalpitam *

*StutyAnirvacaniyatAkhilaguro durikrtA yanmayA *

*VyApitvanca nirAkrtam bhagavato yattirthayAtrAdinA *

*Kshyantavyam jagadisha tadvikalatAdosatrayam matkrtam*

Oh Lord, while meditating I have attributed forms to the formless Thee. Oh
teacher, I have as it were described Thee, the indescribable, in my hymns, I
have assumed you, the omnipresent, as if confined only to holy places that I
have visited. Oh Lord forgive these three acts of audacity of mine.
These are indeed outpourings of a mind that realises that *Brahman* by
definition is incompatible with any limitation or confinement. //

See the above URL  (scribd) which says that the above verse is attributed to
Vyasa.
