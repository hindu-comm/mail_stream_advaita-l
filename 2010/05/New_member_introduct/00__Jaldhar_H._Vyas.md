My one and only asset is to be enveloped by the divine grace of Maha 
Periyava, who bleesed me with HIS upadhesam on 17-1-1989.

I, Erode Nagaraj, (mrudangam artiste) learnt the art initially from 
Palladam Shri V.Ramahandran and Nagaraj is the prime disciple of Sangeetha 
Kalanidhi Padmavibhushan Umayalpuram Shri K.Sivaraman.
