Thanks Ravi ji, for the reply.

I was told today by a Sanskrit teacher at the University that these usages
are governed by a Panini Sutra: पञ्चम्याः तसिल् .  Is this the one you are
referring to?

Could this be an example of the above:  मूलतो ब्रह्मरूपाय, मध्यतो
विष्णुरूपिणे, अग्रतः शिवरूपाय वृक्षराजाय ते नमः .  Here are we referring to
the place/position/direction by the 'tasil'?

This is very interesting.  What about this usage in the Gita:

कामक्रोधवियुक्तानां यतीनां यतचेतसाम् ।  *अभितो* ब्रह्मनिर्वाणं वर्तते
विदितात्मनाम् ॥ (5.26)

Here, what is the status of अभितः?  The bhaashyam is: उभयतो, that is, for
such Jnani-s Moksha is both here and after death as well.

Regards.
