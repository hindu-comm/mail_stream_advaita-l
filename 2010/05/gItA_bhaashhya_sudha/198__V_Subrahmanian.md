Namaste Ramakrishna ji,

Thank you very much for starting this series.  While the Gita Bhashya itself
is an ocean of nectar, drops from this ocean are bound to give us an idea of
the greatness of the worth of the Bhashya.  Going through these selections
will itself be a mananam exercise in Vedanta.

This is based on the nyAya: yad yad aacharati shreShThaH tat tadevetaro
janaH..specified in the Bhagavadgita (3.29) itself.  Humans have the
tendency to follow others who have gained fame and following.  This applies
to good as well as undesirable practices.  If the leader is good, his good
practices will be an example to others.  Taking note of this psychology, the
Lord chooses Arjuna, whom He Himself says is 'born of sattva (daivee sampat'
(16.5).

Here we have that unique rule: Even though action is binding by nature, a
clever handling of action, which is itself inevitable and per force every
one engages in without respite (3.5), can be turned to the advantage of
humans' parama purushArtha: Moksha.  From karma/bandha to naishkarmya,
freedom from the compulsion to act.  This is the purpose of the Moksha
shaastra. The only way this action-oriented nature of man can be directed
towards the goal of freedom from the compulsion to act is the method of
dedicating all karma, each and every one of them, consciously, to Ishwara.
Gradually this practice will free one from craving for the fruit of action
which is why one acts and see the great peace that ensues from the state of
the freedom from the need to act.  This trick is called 'karma yoga'. It is
using a thorn, karma yoga, to remove another thorn that lies implanted in
the flesh: the tendency to engage in karma and remain eternally bound. And
finally be free from both the thorns: Naishkarmyam.  Karma yoga leads to the
gaining of the ability to engage in dhyAna yoga which is indispensable to
Jnana Yoga which is the ultimate sadhana for moksha.

Bhagavatpada is pointing at the basic problem: craving for something outside
of oneself with the deluded thinking that one is devoid of pUrNatva.  This
is the fundamental avidya, the root, moola, resulting in adhyAsa: I am a
doer, experiencer. Egoism, ahankAra, is the first offshoot of this avidya.

Bhagavatpada takes forward the basic problem of avidya leading to ahankara
resulting in shoka/moha and further giving rise to samsara: birth and
death.  Since the basic problem is avidya, vidyaa alone can be the remedy.
Bhagavan recognizes that samsaara is aadhyaasika, based on erroneous
knowledge, and offers the panacea in the form of jnana.  Jnana alone can
correct this error.

This remark of Bhagavatpada occurs in the context of His refutation of the
suggestion of the combination of Jnana and karma.  He asks:  If this
combination was indeed intended by Bhagavan, how can there be a question
from Arjuna: 'Teach me that one (of the two) which will be beneficial for
me' (5.1)? Bhagavatpada draws this inference, arthApatti, from the Lord's
specific reply that follows this question: the teaching of Karma yoga as the
one that will be immediately,  practically beneficial to Arjuna.
