There is the Shaankara sUtra bhashya vaakyam:  shAstram jnApakam, na
kaarakam.  The scripture is playing the role of 'reminding' or  'informing'
the aspirant of a certain mode of action, its benefits, etc.  It does not
force him into doing it.  The ultimate decision is left to the individual.
This is where free will plays a great role. In this process, since the
Shaastra is aiming at our 'hitam', ultimate good, it provides all help in
seeing that we are equipped, enabled, in treading the path it holds out as
being supremely benefical to us.

The Jnani goes beyond the realm of the shAstram:  the word 'shAstram' is
derived thus: shaastrasya hita-shaasanaat, shAsti iti shAstram.  Since the
ShAstram has for its aim the teaching, pointing out, of what is hitam to us,
and since the Jnani has already attained that supreme hitam, naiShkarmyam,
the do's and don'ts are applicable only for the others, so that by following
these they too can attain the supreme.

Although Atma Jnanam is not a produced effect, yet in knowing, apprehending,
realizing it, the appropriate instrument, pramaanam, is required.  One
meaning of pramaanam is instrument -  pramaa-karaNam, that which brings
about the knowledge of what is intended to be known.

Oh! How compassionate the Lord is!!  It looks like His concern that we
should come out of samsara is greater than that of our's.  He takes every
opportunity to reiterate the Truth, by the same words or by means of other
words.  This is called 'abhyAsa', repitition, a tAtparya lingam.

This is the height of desirelessness, the hallmark of karma yoga.  The
attachment of the formi 'Let Ishwara be pleased and be favourable towards
me' is indeed an obstacle.  It is the concern of Bhagavatpada that even this
desire, hankering, to the fruit of karma yoga, is a blemish in true
devotion, true karma yoga.  Such is His 'demand' from an aspirant.  And the
benefit of this is indeed immense.  Such a fine yogi will develop supreme
strength and poise in remaining 'sama', unperturbed, in the face of
situations of varied, of opposed, nature which life brings him: samatvam
yoga uchyate.
