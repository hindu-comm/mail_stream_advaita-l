Namaste
A very accomplished scholar, ShatAvadhAni Dr.R.Ganesh, has discoursed on the
topic of 'Sri Vidyaranya's contribution to Indian Culture' in Kannada.
These talks, totaling some 7.5 hours, is available in MP3 CD form and is
priced just Rs.75.

The lectures bring to light the many-faceted personality and the great
eventful and illustrious life of Sri Vidyaranya detailing the historical and
cultural background.  His innumerable works are mentioned and their content
and significance overviewed impressively.  The Jivanmukti viveka and the
Panchadashi have been relatively elaborately covered in the lecture series.
It is a boon to Kannada-knowing people interested in these topics.  The CD
is available for sale in the Book Shop situated in the premises of the
Gokhale Institute of Public Affairs, Bull Temple Raod, Bangalore.

I completed hearing the series and  found the exposition very enjoyable and
elevating.
