No.  Because it is a vedokta mantra.

The adhikara to recite vedokta mantras depends on upanayana.  There is no 
provision in the shastras for upanayana for women therefore they have no 
adhikara.  So it is not so much that there is a negative reason but the 
absence of a positive reason.

But anyway why would they want to?
