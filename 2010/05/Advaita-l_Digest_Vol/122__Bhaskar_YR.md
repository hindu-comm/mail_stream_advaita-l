But wait this "right" would seem to be purely theoretical because if e.g. 
Kaushalya has no adhikara for Vedas, _how_ can she perform a homa?  The 
answer is the same way any other Hindu does.  She can hire a Brahmana 
purohit to perform the ceremony for her.  Just as when you hire a builder 
to construct a new house at the completion of the work you are the owner 
not the builder, when a yajamana hires a purohit by means of paying 
dakshina, the yajamana gets the punya of performing the ceremony even 
though he didn't "do the work."

If memory serves me right, there is an episode in rAmAyaNa wherein hanumAn 
sees seeta doing sandhyAvandana & offering saNdhyArghya...Kindly clarify 
your stand on this...One of the Achrya-s,  who is currently recognized as 
an authority on  Apasthambha gruhya sUtra, (Sri Srikanta shastrigaL in 
Bangalore) argues that stree-s do have upanayana adhikAra & have 
vedAdhikAra as well..He quotes the examples of kunti, seeta, gArgi etc. 
Just for your information & clarification please.

Your humble servant
Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
