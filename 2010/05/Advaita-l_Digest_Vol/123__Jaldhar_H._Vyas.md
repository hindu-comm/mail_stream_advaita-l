I am not familiar with this.  Do you have a reference for where in the 
Ramayana this episode supposedly occurs?  I cannot really respond 
otherwise.

Again without knowing his exact arguments I can't respond.  I will say the 
case of Gargi (unless some other source than the brhadaranyokapnishad is 
used) is a very weak example.  Nowhere is it mentioned that Gargi 
underwent upanayana or did sandhyavandana.  She is said to be a jnani but 
why should jnana depend on any of those things? In fact a man is required 
to give them up to achieve jnana!
