Namaste List Members,

I would like to know if there is any commentary on Srimad Ashtavakra Gita by an Acharya in our Srimad Bhagavadpada Dasanami Sampradaya. I have tried to look in a variety of sources, and some claim that such an authentic Bhashya is not available. Please let me know.

Thanks in advance,

Sriram Nagaraj
