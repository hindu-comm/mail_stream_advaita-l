> I would like to know if there is any commentary on Srimad Ashtavakra Gita by an Acharya in our Srimad Bhagavadpada Dasanami Sampradaya. I have tried to look in a variety of sources, and some claim that such an authentic Bhashya is not available. Please let me know.

I am not aware of any Sanskrit commentaries on this text, but it is often
quoted by many teachers within the tradition. And of course, also by many
new teachers with a very nebulous tie (if any) to the tradition.
