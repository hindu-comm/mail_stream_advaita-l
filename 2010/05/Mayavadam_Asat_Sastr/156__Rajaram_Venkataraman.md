Om Sri: Govindaya Nama:

According to Padma Purana, Lord Vishnu ordered Lord Siva to descend as a
Brahmana to teach the jivatman and paramatma are one. In this philosophy the
renunciation of one's duties is expounded and Brahman is declared to be
devoid of qualities. This argument of mayavadam is said to be covered
buddhism. The question is if this is the view of sastrasm then where is the
ground to accept the teachings of Adi Sankara which matches all of the
above? This position has been taken by gaudiyas and madhwas in Mani Manjari
take a slighltly different position that Lord Siva in turn controls a demon
called Manima. The followers of Sri Ramanuja take a position that
Sankaradvaita is prachanna baudham but dont know if they quote Padma Purana
verses. AFAIK.

The doctrine of MAyA (illusion) is a wicked doctrine and said to be
pseudo-Buddhist. I myself, of the form of a brAhmana, proclaimed it in Kali
(age). (padma puraaNa, uttara-khaNDa, 236.7)

expounded. (padma puraaNa, uttara-khaNDa, 236.8)
