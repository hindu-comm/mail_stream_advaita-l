"The Import and Significance of the word matparaH in Verse 2.61 of the 
BhagavadgitA"

An essay by a sadhaka who wishes to remain anonymous describing 
Shankaracharyas intepretation of this word contrasted with vishishtadvaita 
and dvaita interpretations and defense of the Advaita intepretation by 
later Advaitins.
