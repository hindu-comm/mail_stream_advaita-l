Sir

The key is "nishkritya" which itself is the combination of ni + kritya. ni / nih (the form to be used depending on rules of sandhis, compounds etc.) is an upasarga which means "well, properly, perfectly etc." as in nidhana, nidarSana, niveSa (the hindi word, niveS is from this form) or more familiarly abhi-ni-veSa and so on. There is another upasarga (if you consider the tails sometimes attached to such words) or a different set of meanings (the modern preferenceof presentation)for ni / nih, meaning not and variations thereof, which is found in nishkAma, nirmala, nishkalanka, nirupama,nirapeksha, niravadyam etc. For many of these, instead of ni / nih, "a / an" may be prefixed to get the same meaning as in amala, anupama etc. I cannot think of any examples, where the words formed by 'ni' and 'a' combining with the same adjective result in slightly differing shades of meanings, but that cannot be ruled out.

In light of the above, niruktam is well said.

Regards
Senani

Namaste.

I recalled that the word निरुक्तं is found in the Taittiriya Upanishad:
निरुक्तं चानिरुक्तं च (2.6.1). The bhashyam is: निरुक्तं नाम निष्कृष्य
समान-असमानजातीयेभ्यः देशकालविशिष्टतया इदं तत् इत्युक्तम्..(niruktam is that
which is definable with specific characteristics..)

Now, niruktam is 'something well said'. It appears almost certain that this
word does not mean 'unsaid' or 'poorly said'.

I still welcome inputs on this topic.

Om Tat Sat
