As I mentioned, the list was not intended to be exhaustive. So yes,
niH is also used in the sense of abhAva, which would make it
equivalent to anavadya. Interpretation depends on context, as always.
But is best to resort to interpretation only if a straightforward
analysis creates conflicts. In the example you quoted, if a bhakta is
very disturbed by the possibility of any doSha in divinity, take the
abhAva sense. As far as Venkateshwara is concerned, one could argue
his money management skills or lack thereof is a doSha! (I recall a
legend that he is constant debt to Kubera because of expenses incurred
during his marriage to Padmavati).

Sounds right to me. ni + ShThA dhaatu.

पृथक्करणे
Words (or word components) are separated out and explained.
Or निश्चयेन उक्तम् = निरुक्तम्

I don't think it means अनुक्त as you suggested. I consulted two
dictionaries as well - neither of them give the meaning as unsaid.
Rather the usual 'well said', declared, etc.
