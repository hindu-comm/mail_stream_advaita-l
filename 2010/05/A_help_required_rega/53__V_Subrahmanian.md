Namaste.

I recalled that  the word निरुक्तं is found in the Taittiriya Upanishad:
निरुक्तं चानिरुक्तं च (2.6.1).  The bhashyam is: निरुक्तं नाम निष्कृष्य
समान-असमानजातीयेभ्यः देशकालविशिष्टतया इदं तत् इत्युक्तम्..(niruktam is that
which is definable with specific characteristics..)

Now, niruktam is 'something well said'.  It appears almost certain that this
word does not mean 'unsaid' or 'poorly said'.

I still welcome inputs on this topic.
