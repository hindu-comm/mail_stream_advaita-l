namaste,

> It looks like I may be over-interpreting the word as used in the gItAbhAshya.

Looking at the tika again --

(a) paramam phalam, yat nishcitam shreyaH, niHshreyasam, kaivalyam.
(b) niHshreyasam ca dvividham -- (i) niratishaya-sukhAvirbhAvaH, (ii)
niHsheSha-anarthocChittiH -- ca. tatra Adyam udAharati param iti.

Though the vigraha-vAkyam, as Naresh stated, is simply "nishcitam
shreyaH", Anandagiri does not stop here. He goes further and infuses
it with additional meaning. As a result, I don't think that you are
over-interpreting the word.

bhavadiiyaH,

         ajit



VS>>> I am thinking of the usage of niHSreyasa in the gItAbhAshya introduction,
>>> where it means the supreme goal, i.e. liberation

NC>> In the introduction niHshreyasam refers to the motivation for studying
>> the Gita. Later in the introduction, he refers to the same
>> niHshreyasam in the context of abhyudaya with the usual caveat of
>> IshvarArpaNa buddhi etc.
>> Anandagiri's TIkA clarifies thsi and explicitly states that निश्चितं
>> श्रेयः निःश्रेयसम्.

VS> That's interesting. Thanks for the TIkA reference, Naresh. It
looks like I may
