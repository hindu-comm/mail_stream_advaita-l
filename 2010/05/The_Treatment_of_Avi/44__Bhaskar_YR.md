I was only trying to show what implications could be drawn from his above 
words and one of them is that ' a reader has ended up with doubts after 
reading my article.'  And doubts are always a result of not comprehending 
a text or speech. Is that not true?

Not necessarily!!  A doubt cannot be always the result of not 
comprehending what is written or said!!  I may doubt the very (poor) 
understanding of the originator of these texts and speeches (in this case 
your article) based on clear & solid understanding of the contrary 
siddhAnta.  I am sure, it is with that type of 'doubt'(doubting your 
understanding of the siddhAnta) sAvitri mAtAji written that mail.   So, 
your assumption on non-comprehension here is utterly baseless. 

Hari hari Hari Bol!!!
