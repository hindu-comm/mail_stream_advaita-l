Sri Gurubhyon Namaha
 Manasika sandhyavandanam is allowed only in apatkala that is when there is a real reason, you should not do manasika or abridged versions if you have the means and time for waking uop early and doing it. The only point that i not to this mainly during travel that too in the air, if you are travelling by train u still have the possiility of doing regular sandhya.

If by any chance you miss the timings you will have to do prayaschitta which comes in sandhya vandanam, but again this should not be a habit and reason to skip off for waking during brahmi muhurta.

Prathah sandya and madhaynika sandhya combining into one cannot be done pratha sandhya has to be done before sunrise preferably during brahmi muhurta and the madhyanika can be done 2.24 hrs after sunrise. If you are in any other place apart from India thuis gets a bit tough as sometimes you never see the sun , so it is better to do it at that time with prayaschitta than forsaking it completely.

One should not combine morning and afternoon mantras or the other way there is no combination allowed. If you want to follow shruti follow it completely, how long will it take to say the mantras completely not more than 10 mins for each sandhya, of course the mantra sadhana might take some time depending on the number.

Never ever miss sandhya, the only things that we miss every day or can afford to miss are our prayers, try missing your lunch or dinner but perform sandhya. My 2 cents, i am a lot younger than most of you members but just thought that i would share what i know.

Namaskaram to all

I have 3 questions in this regard.
1. I have to travel for my work and many times while on the plane or driving to work during the sandhya time, I used to perform the 'manasika sandhya' (Krishna Yajur veda) from the 'aachamanam thru ApOhishta, Suryascha.../Apafpunanthu../agnishcha.., dhaDhigrAvinnO.., ArkyaprAdhanam,asAvAdhithyo..., Gayathri mahAmantajapam, Upasthanam.. until adhyAnO dEva...yadh bhatram thanma Asuva Om Tatsat brahmArpanamastu|| simulating mentally the rituals of prOkshanam/mArjanam/arkyam/dhikvandhanam etc associated. I am happy to learn that I am NOT doing the wrong thing -knowingly or unknowingly. I request the learned members to comment.
2.I also used to combine the prAtha sandhya and mAdhyAnnikam while performing the prAthasandhya, whether doing the traditional way or mAnasika method as I may not be able to perform during the appointed time (at work ). Is it okay? 
3. If for any unforeseen reason, I miss my Prathasandya/mAdhyAnnikam, I make it a point to chant the Suryacha../Apafpunanthu.. along with agnischa.. during my sAyamsandhyA and also chant the 'mithrasya...andhidhOnadhoorAth' and 'AsathyEna...pasyEma saradhassadham...' (backspacing myself mentally to the past morning) prior to 'imammE varuna...'. Is it allowed? 

With namaskaram
