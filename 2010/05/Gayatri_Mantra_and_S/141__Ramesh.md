Pranams Shyam,

What I said was "gAyatrI 1000 times (or 100 times with prANAyAma or 10
times with the seven vyAhR^iti-s prefixed)"

I was only translating bodhAyana literally. He uses sahasra, shata and
dasha, meaning 1000, 100 and 10 respectively.

The specific text is: "sāvitrīṃ sahasrakṛtva āvartayet",
"prāṇa.āyāma.śo vā śatakṛtvaḥ", "ubhayataḥ.praṇavāṃ
sa.sapta.vyāhṛtikāṃ manasā vā daśakṛtvaḥ".

By seven vyAhR^iti-s prefixed is meant "oM bhUH oM bhuvaH.....oM satyaM"

> You said 1000 times or 100 with 10 times pranayama. Did you mean 1008 and 108 respectively? Also your "vyahrti-s prefixed" - are you referring to the pranavah japah(bhuradi saptavyahrtinam, etc)?
