Namaskara to all:

I have a question re: Gayatri Mantra

1.Can it be recited outside of sandhyavandana ?

2.My understanding is that before it is recited, Gayatri Shaapa-Vimochana Mantra must be recited first, which is what I do.

3.Albiet not an excuse, is there a shortened version of sandhya-vandana for those who are dharmically weak or times of exigency (aapatkaal).  I have read there are Madhva versions of a shortended SV but what is appropraite for those belonging to Smartha sampradaya ? I have seen a shorter version that after giving arghya, it proceeds to the point of reciting Achutayanama, Anantayanama, Govindayanama; then Kaayena vaacha etc and then giving respects to Bhoomi Devi at the end. Now this method omits tarpana to Navagrahas, Dasha-Pranayama, nyasa, Gayatri Mantra, salutations to Mitra/Varuna, Yama, and lords of thee directions.

Dhanyavaad,
Ravi Chandrasekhara
