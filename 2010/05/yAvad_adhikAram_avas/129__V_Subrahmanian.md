Namaste.

That problem would not be there in such a case.  First, the Jnana itself has
dawned not depending on the karma but out of shravaNa, etc. As quoted, Yama
himself says that his NAchikEtAgni ritual has got him this position. It is
my presumption that somewhere in the way he became enlightened.  And at the
dawn of Jnana, in this particular jiva's case, it is to be inferred that his
karma that is to take him to that AdhikArika position is already prArabdha,
has begun to give the fruit.  It is out of the sanchita category and is not
burnt by Jnana.  That specially meritorious prArabdha is so powerful,  that
in his case it extends to give him the fruit in another, super-human /
divinity form, beyond the human birth that he passes off. That is why I had
reasoned that this jiva will not be taking a birth requiring garbha vAsa,
but donning a form suitable for that office.  It could be called 'mAnasa
putra' of Brahma, like VasiShTha, Sanaka, Sanatkumara, etc. spoken of in
Puranas, who were not born of wombs.

This has to be inferred because of the rule: No bhoga is without the
appropriate karma.  Since this Jnani is seen to occupy a special office that
brings with it special bhoga, his prArabdha is alone that can be accounted
for it.  That is the reason jiva/Jnani X is chosen for this office and not
jiva/Jnani Y who has not such a prArabdha. Otherwise, we would not be able
to account for an order, a niyama, in the selection of a Jnani for the
purpose. And the question 'why X and why not Y?' will remain unanswered.
The Brahmasutra 2.1.34 also teaches that any phalam/bhoga a jiva gets is
only dependent on its karma and not due to the whims of Iswara.  Otherwise
Iswara will be exposed to the defect of partiality/favouritism.

This 'fear' is only indicative of the Supremacy of Iswara, Brahman, the
Jagat KAraNam.  There is another expression: mahadbhayam vajra...which
means: the cosmic officials act with the fear of being punished with the
vajraayudha that the Ishwara is wielding. It is only a figurative
expression.  Shankara comments in anticipation of the mantra quoted by me
above from the Taittiriya Up:

(Cocluding a lengthy analysis of 'fear' and 'finitude' that is caused by
Self-ignorance, He says)  A destroyer, in the ultimate analysis can be so
only if it is itself indestructible.  (The Ultimate cause of fear itself be
indestructible, since a contrary supposition will lead to an infinite
regress.  And such an eternal agent is Brahman.) Now, if there be no cause
of destruction, there sould be no such fear in the destructible as issues
from a perception of a destroyer.  The whole wold, however, is seen to be
stricken with fear.  Therefore, from the perceived fact of fear in the
world, it follows that there does exist a terrifying thing which is by
nature an indestructible agent of destruction, because of which the world
shudders.  Expressive of this idea, too, there is this verse:
भीषास्माद् वातः पवते, भीषोदेति सूर्यः, भीषास्मादग्निः इन्द्रः च,
मृत्युर्धावति पञ्चम इति ।  //Impelled by fear of the Supreme Brahman/Iswara
do Vayu, Surya, Agni, Indra and Yama engage relentlessly in their allotted
duties.//

So, Shankara sees this mantra as something that teaches the 'existence' of
Brahman, even as He has seen things like 'Ananda laabha', 'pravesha', etc.
as indicators of existence of Brahman in this Upanishad.

As we have observed already, not all Indra-s, Vayu-s, etc. are Jnani-s.  So,
'fear' in them can be admitted.  Even in the case of  a Jnani occupying such
a position, there may not be fear, but the complying with the requirement of
the post is to be admitted.  One cannot simply violate the order prevailing
nor can one simply walk away in the middle of the term.  It is prArabdha -
dependent.  It will end only when the time comes.

Yes. I also recalled the Kenopanishat case where all the gods - Indra,
VaruNa, VAyu and Agni were ignorant. After the encounter with that
'Effulgent Being', first Indra got enlightened and through him the others.
That shows that these positions are not filled up by Jnani's alone by
default.

The case of 'exploits' can be explained thus: Indra, etc. are posts that are
occupied by various jiva-s at various terms.  So, Indra-s are also different
jiva-s.  In one yuga/time slot, one jiva, Indra, could have been a Jnani and
in another, another Indra not so.

I also recall the Gita 4th chapter tteaching:  I taught this Yoga to
VivasvAn, VivasvAn taught it to Manu...etc.  That shows that some SUrya was
a Jnani.

This is quite true.
