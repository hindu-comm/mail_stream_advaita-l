Bhaskar, I am not aware that there is anything implicit that I have ignored
so far. I have covered the pUrvapaksha and the first half of the response 
to it in the 2 parts posted to the list. The rest of the response is to follow,
but I do not subscribe to the view that the explicit vAkya-s in this bhAshya
passage are in some way different from the implicit overall purport of the
bhAshya as a whole. If you would care to elaborate on the upa-siddhAnta
that is to be inferred from the plain and explicit reading of the bhAshya,
please do so. I can only state in detail what I see in the bhAshya.



Thanks,

Vidyasankar
