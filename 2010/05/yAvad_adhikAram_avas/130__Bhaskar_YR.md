Implicit in the above bhAshya passage are many unstated axioms about how
rebirths occur and how they are related to karmA, which are standard in 
all
Hindu thought.

Thanks for taking trouble to write this sUtra bhAshya prakaraNa in detail 
prabhuji.  IMHO, sofar what you detailed in this series do convey the 
explicit meaning of bhAshya vAkya-s...But I am afraid, due to this plain & 
explict reading of the bhAshya vAkya-s we are ignoring the implicit & 
unstated axioms ( shall I say 'upa siddhAnta, that can be inferred from 
the plain reading of the above bhAshya here ??) which is apart from what 
you stated above !!  Hope in the subsequent series you would show me that 
in detail.

Your humble servant
Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
