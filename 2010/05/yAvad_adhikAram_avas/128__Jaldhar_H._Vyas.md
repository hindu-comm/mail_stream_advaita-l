Yes this is an excellent example.

The problem with this idea is that it smacks of jnanakarmasamucchaya. 
Surely at the dawn of jnana, all jnanis are at the same step regardless of 
their previous (now destroyed) actions.

But then what does it mean that a jnani is "impelled by fear of Brahman?"

Yet in other places (e.g. Chhandogyopanishad story of Indra and Virochana) 
Indra is atleast initially, the student not the teacher.  And some of 
the puranic stories of Indras exploits do not make him look like a 
jnani at all.

The position of Indra is achieved not by jnana but by performance of 100 
ashvamedhas.  This is how Nahusha was able to usurp Indras throne as told 
in Mahabharata, Bhagavata etc.  I am reminded of the story from the 
Vishnupurana of the line of ants marching under Indras throne.  It was 
revealed to Him that once each of those ants had been Indra but after 
reaching the peak of attainment they had sunk back down to this lowly form 
due to their attachment to karma.  Perhaps some of the Indras were smarter 
than that?
