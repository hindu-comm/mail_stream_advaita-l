A Sanskrit message recounting the history of the rediscovery of Kaladi and establishment of temples there is at the following URL:



http://www.sringeri.net/2010/05/17/news/anugraha-bhashanam-delivered-on-the-first-day-of-shankara-jayanti-2010-at-kalady.htm


A number of live webcasts of events from Kaladi have been planned at www.sringeri.net over the next two weeks. 



On this occasion of Sankara Jayanti, I would also like to draw the attention of readers to some pertinent links from a page on our our own website - http://www.advaita-vedanta.org/avhp/Slokas.html. The link to the "Sanskrit ftp site" is not functional. Please check http://sanskritdocuments.org/ instead.
