charma specifically refers to an animal hide worn as clothing. (Like the 
mrgacharma or dearskin worn by a forest-dwelling sage.)  It is ridiculous 
to assume the sky could be wrapped up around oneself like a coat.

I don't know if any acharya has made this connection before but when I 
read this I was immediately reminded of another upanishad vakya. 
Ishopanishad says "All this [the phenomenal universe] is covered by the 
Lord"  The utterly impossible becomes possible with knowledge of the Lord!
