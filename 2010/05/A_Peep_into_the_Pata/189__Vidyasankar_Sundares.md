The other yogasUtra to be referenced in this connection is drashTA drSi-
mAtraS Suddho'pi pratyayAnupaSyaH.



In the pAtanjala yoga school, the drashTA is not a product to be effected
by samAdhi. It is an existing purusha who is the drashTA, but wrongly
identifies with prakRti and its guNa-s. That is covered in the third yogasUtra
- vRtti sArUpyam itaratra, i.e. when the citta vRtti-s are not checked, the
purusha ascribes to himself the form of the vRtti. And finally, the pAtanjala
yoga school only talks of manaH-saMyama and vRtti-nirodha. It does not
talk of mano-nASa at all - that is a uniquely vedAntic analysis of mind.



Sankara bhagavatpAda's upadeSasAhasrI, verse chapter 12, needs to be 
studied carefully in this connection, particularly the following verses. 



prakASasthaM yathA dehaM sAlokam abhimanyate |
draShTrAbhAsaM tathA cittaM draShTAhamiti manyate || 1 ||



...



dRSeSchAyA yadArUDhA mukhacchAyeva darSane |
paSyaMstaM pratyayaM yogI dRshTa Atmeti manyate || 6 ||


taM ca mUDhaM ca yady anyaM pratyayaM vetti no dRSeH |
sa eva yoginAM SreshTho netaraH syAn na saMshayaH || 7 ||

Note that Sankara does not hesitate to label the one who knows the Atman
as the "best of yogI-s" - yoginAM SreshTha - here. Also see brahmasUtra
bhAshya 3.2.24 - here the Atman, which is only describable as "not this, not
this" is nevertheless "seen" during saMrAdhana (word used in sUtra), which 
is explained in the bhAshya as bhakti-dhyAna-praNidhAnAdy anushThAnam.
Note the highly yoga-centric word praNidhAna and the further usage of the
word yogI in the rest of this bhAshya passage too.
