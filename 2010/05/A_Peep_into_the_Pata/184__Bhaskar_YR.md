However if  one looks at between the lines Sankhya and Yoga taken together 
one would find that they are not dualistic.

IMO sAnkhya & yOga as said in shruti & smruti texts like geeta is vedAntic 
& non-dualistic...But popular darshana-s like kapila praNeeta sAnkhya mata 
& pAtanjala yOga are quite dualistic in its doctrine.  As you know, 
shankara refutes this sAnkhya theory through pradhAna malla nibarhaNa 
nyAya.  More importantly for sAnkhya philosophy kevala anumAna is the 
pramANa & they would not consider veda as the valid antima pramANa for 
their tattva pratipAdana.  Due to time constraints, I cannot go into the 
detailed comparison of kapila sAnkhya and Advaita vedAnta...You may hear 
more on this from our Sri Subbu prabhuji, who has sufficient time to 
clarify these things in a detailed way.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
