In 4.1.15 the Acharya says:

बाधितमपि तु मिथ्याज्ञानं संस्कारवशात् कञ्चित्कालं अनुवर्तते...

False knowledge, even though sublated, indeed continues for some time
owing to samskAra....

As per the above, the Jnani is not paripUrNa and doSha rahita as the
mithyaa jnAna that was the cause of samsara continues for some time
owing to samskara.  Is not Shankara presenting a
mithyaajnaana-lingering dOSha sahita Jnani as a jeevanmukta?

In eka jiva vAda, sadyomukti is admitted.  That is the characteristic
of that vAda.  There is no conception of a Jnani at all there as none
will be there to call him so, including he himself.  It is only in the
nAnA jiva vAda one can talk of a Jnani and jivanmukti.  To enable
this, one has to admit avidya lesha as taught in BSB 4.1.15, etc.

Personally, I am yet to find Bhashya reference for sadyomukti.
Consistently, the Acharya comments on shruti/smriti/sutra on jnana
destroying karma, prArabdha, etc. by emphatically admitting
jivanmukti, as I showed a sample of such instances recently. I would
like to be informed about His admitting sadyomukti by the learned
members.

subbu
