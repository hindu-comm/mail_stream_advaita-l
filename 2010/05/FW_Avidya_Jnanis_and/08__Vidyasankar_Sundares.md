Actually, there is no lacuna left over by Sankara, but room for the infinite
variety of prArabdha karma that is possible.

The uneasy relationship with time does not have to do with time per se, but
the suggested "quickness". To say that a jIvanmukta lives in a functioning
body so long as the prArabdha karma phala bhoga lasts is not problematic
at all, except to those who say that the jnAnI's body is imagined by ignorant
onlookers. To say that this is "quick" (in all cases) puts an expectation of
boundedness upon it, which is, in my opinion, unnecessary and so I term it
an uneasy relationship with time.

Meaning? Could you provide an exact quote from brahmasiddhi here?

It is the not the absence of the term that a scholar should talk about really,
but about whether the concept is present or absent in the tradition and how
it has been understood or misunderstood. Your comment about jIvanmukti
being at most figurative of videhamukti, with only sadyomukti being the proper
metaphysical assessment of mukti is quite unclear to me.

I am not sure about the 'mere polemic category' but it is clear that there
were a lot of different opinions about it, which is why vidyAraNya had to
write a separate text called jIvanmukti-viveka.

This is the same scenario as the one where Sankara affirms that the
Atma-vijnAna-smRti-saMtati is svayaMsiddha and still admits a niyama
vidhi regarding it after the rise of samyag-jnAna. The discussion for a
scholar should then turn around what exactly is meant by the term
samyag-jnAna in various places in the bhAshya-s and how it stands in
relation to jnAna-nishThA and sthiratva of the buddhi in jnAna. Still,
this does not make the differences in views between maNDana and
Sankara go away. For Sankara, the sAdhaka has to cultivate, with
good effort, those qualities that are natural to the jnAnI. He says so
in many places in the gItAbhAshya. Now, what exactly are those
natural qualities of the jnAnI would never be known unless there were
jnAnIs living amongst us. For maNDana, on the other hand, it seems 
like the emphasis on the kshipratA oh physical death post-jnAna makes
him consider that no one alive for long is a true jnAnI, only an advanced
sAdhaka at best.

All of this is in keeping with Sankara's uncompromising rejection of karmA
as a direct means to liberation, whereas maNDana seems to favor the
prasaMkhyAna vAda, if not jnAna-karma-samuccaya.

But this is certainly a most novel view, which would have to be proved
with extraordinary evidence. maNDana does not ever say that brahmasiddhi
is a gloss on Sankara's bhAshya, while sureSvara (and padmapAda too), 
clearly takes on maNDana's views independently (not as an interpretation
of Sankara) for consideration and refutation. To hold that Sankara should
be understood in the light of maNDana's brahmasiddhi would be acceptable
to very few knowledgeable people indeed, whether they are traditional
pundits or academic scholars!

Vidyasankar
