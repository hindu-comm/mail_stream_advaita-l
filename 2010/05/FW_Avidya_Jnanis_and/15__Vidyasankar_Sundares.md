That is so for bahir-vishaya-jnAna. For AtmajnAna, there is no external
vishaya really, so the analogy goes only so far.

So what DO you make of the bRhadAraNyaka bhAshya 1.4.7 then? With 
the categorical denial of viparIta pratyaya for the samyag-jnAnI, how 
can there be any daurbalya of jnAna? And if according to you, without
daurbalya of jnAna, how can there be daurbalya of jnAna-pravRtti?



Again, it seems to me that you think Sankara is contradicting himself
or at least being very ambiguous/unclear about it all. The same author
is talking of jnAna-pravRtti-daurbalya as compared to prArabdha karma,
and then recommending tyAga-vairAgyAdi sAdhana after the rise of
samyag-jnAna, while also denying the viparIta pratyaya-s for the jnAnI.



jnAna-pravRtti happens in the same locus where Atma-vijnAna-smRti-
saMtati takes place. The bRhadAraNyaka bhAshya 1.4.7 makes it all
very clear, so long as you are prepared to let go of your preconceived
notions of what it is that Sankara is actually saying about this. If you
think about where is it that the jnAna-pravRtti takes place and the 
Atma-vijnAna-smRti-saMtati takes place, or for that matter, any kind
of pratyaya appears, viparIta or otherwise, then everything is clear.



After that, all unnecessary interpretations of the muNDaka reference
to brahmavid-varishTha will also vanish of their own accord.

I am afraid you have not understood what I am saying about brahmavid-
varishTha at all. I am not doing any major interpretation of my own, but
merely quoting the interpretation that Sankara bhagavatpAda has already
given. In any case, what makes you think that long abidance in nirvikalpa
samAdhi is the same as physical death? There is no difference between
what some texts describe as never arising from samAdhi and the link that
I have drawn between muNDaka and bRhadAraNyaka bhAshya-s in this
regard. The brahmavid-varishTha who is Atma-rata and Atma-krIDa is one
for whom "asya sarvam AtmaivAbhUt. tat kena kaM paSyet? ..." Where
does any kind of vikalpa of the manas enter into the picture in this state?
In my opinion, it is perfectly good to describe it as nirvikalpa samAdhi.

Please pay attention to sUtra bhAshya passages "samAdhir upadishTo
vedAnteshu ... AtmA vA are dRashTavyaS, Srotavya ... aum ity evaM
dhyAyatha ..." (2.3.39) and "pramANa-viparyaya-vikalpa-nidrA-smRtaya
iti yoga-SAstra-prasiddhA manasaH panca-vRttayaH parigRhyante" (2.4.12).
gauDapAda describes this state as akalpakam and nigRhIta manaso nir-
vikalpasya (kArikAs 3.33-34). What indeed is your objection to post-Sankaran
authors calling the state of abidance in Atma-darSana as samAdhi, in line with
sUtra and bhAshya 2.3.39 and to further describe this samAdhi as nirvikalpa,
in line with what Sankara bhagavatpAda's paramaguru has said?

No, you are not explicitly prioritizing sUtrabhAshya over any other bhAshya,
but you are prioritizing what you understand or have been taught of the
sUtrabhAshya over what is explicitly said in the other bhAshya-s. I am at
pains to point out that there is no need to understand Sankara bhagavatpAda
this way, because all the bhAshya-s reinforce the same vedAnta in multiple
ways and in various contexts.

Vidyasankar
