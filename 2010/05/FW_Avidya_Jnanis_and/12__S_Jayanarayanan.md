Perhaps an analogy may help here. Suppose we say, purely for the sake of understanding, that attaining to GYAna is akin to driving a car (as a rough analogy).

aGYAnI -> Person who is walking
GYAnI -> Person who is driving a car

GYAnimAtra -> Person who is driving a car without steady control
sthipraGYa - > Person who is driving a car with steady control

A driving instructor may tell a student who has just begun to drive, "You are driving all right, but it is going to take more effort to develop steadiness in your driving".

Among those that are driving a car, there is definitely a difference between driving a car steadily and driving a car unsteadily.

**** THIS "UNSTEADY" DRIVING IS NOT THE SAME AS SOMEONE WHO IS "PARTIALLY" DRIVING!! ****

To be noted carefully: Both the GYAnimAtra and the sthitapraGYa have full saMyagGYAna. The difference between the two is that the latter's saMyagGYAna is sthitam (steady), whereas the former's is asthitam (unsteady).

Note again (worth reiterating): Going back to the analogy, it is NOT that the difference between the two is that one is "partially" driving, whereas the other is "fully driving" or that there are gradations in the "percentage of how much their driving". Rather, it is a **fundamentally different parameter of steadiness** that is being considered here.
