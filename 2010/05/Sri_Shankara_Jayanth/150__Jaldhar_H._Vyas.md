Marxist or no that article would have been an embarrasment for a high 
schooler let alone a vice-chancellor.  Basically it boils down to "I know 
you think Shankaracharya was a right-winger but don't worry he was really 
a left-winger."  These tedious types of people never seem to understand 
that perhaps Shankaracharya is important for reasons other than politics.
