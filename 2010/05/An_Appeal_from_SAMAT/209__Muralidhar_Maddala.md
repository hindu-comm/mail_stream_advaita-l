Namasthe Dear List Members,
Please go thru the forwarded mail below from Shri Krishna of Samata books,
apealing for contributions/donations.  I recently interacted with him while
looking for few books and realised that they really are in need of a greater
support for reprints/publish new ones or survival even. My only interest
here is "to do something" for a publishing unit instrumental in bringing up
quite a few authentic books for the seekers over two generations and to see
their sincer works continues for years to come.

If interested, please contact Shri Krishna Velury (samatabooks at gmail.com)
directly either to buy their books or contribute in their publishing
efforts. .
Thanks and Regards,
Murali
