Not so. According to the JMV, the second type is NOT a mukta. To continue the JMV quote from above:

 tasmAdidanIMtanAnAM vidvatsaMnyAsinAM GYAnasyAnuvR^ittimAtram.h .
 vAsanAkshayamanonAshau tu prayatnasaMpAdyAv iti sthitam .

 "So it is held that for the vidvatsannyIs of these days only 
 the GYAna continues. VAsanAkshaya and manonAsha are to be 
 accomplished by effort to make it steady (sthitaM)."

Note that the second kind of students do NOT have steady knowledge! Hence they are NOT sthitapraGYas, and hence NOT jIvanmuktas!

(For the equation sthitapraGYa = jIvanmukta, see the first chapter of the JMV).

Besides, note that the second class of students (akR^itopAsti) still have to achieve vAsanAkShaya-manonAsha according to VidyAraNya, hence this is another reason they are not jIvanmuktas, as VidyAraNya gives the definition of jIvanmukti in the very beginning of the JMV:

 atha jIvanmuktisAdhanaM nirUpayAmaH . 
 tattvaGYAnamanonAshavAsanAkshayaastatsAdhanam.h .

 "Now we will discuss the means to jIvanmukti. The knowledge 
 of the Truth (tattvaGYAna), the annihilation of the mind 
 (manonAsha) and the effacement of latent tendencies
 (vAsanAkshaya) are the means of jIvanmukti."

Since the akR^itopAsti's have not yet accomplished vAsanAkShaya-manonAsha, they cannot be considered jIvanmuktas.

However, it is correct that the GYAnimAtra is not a saMsArin either. He is in a state that can not be considered the same as that of an aGYAnI or a sthitapraGYa.

---

Here is yet another reason why there is no doubt that VidyAraNya considers saMyak-aparokSha-brahmaGYAna alone does NOT constitute jIvanmukti, as he gives the example of YAGYavalkya:

 asti hi yAGYavalkyasya tatprativAdinAM ushhasta-kaholAdInAM
 cha bhUyAnvidyAmadaH, taiH sarvairapi vijigIshhukathAyAM
 pravR^ittAt.h .

 "Even YAGYavalkya and his opponents ushhasta, Kahola and
 others, all had vast pride of learning inasmuch as all of
 them entered into disputation desiring victory."


 nanu teshhAM vidyAntaramevAsti na tu brahmavidyeti chet.h .

 "(Objection:) They had other learnings only, but not
 knowledge of Brahman."


 na, kathAgatayoH prashnottarayoH brahmavishhayatvAt.h .

 "(Reply:) It cannot be said so, since in that debate, all
 questions and answers thereto are found to be concerning
 Brahman."


 nanu brahmavishhayatve.api teshhAMApAtato GYAnameva na tu 
 saMyagvedanaM iti chet.h .

 "(Objection:) Although Brahman was the object of discussion,
 they had only imperfect knowledge, not perfect (saMyak) knowledge."


 na, tathA satyasmAkamapi tadIyavAkyaiH utpannAyA
 brahmavidyayA asaMyaktvaprasangAt.h .

 "(Reply:) It cannot be said so, because, in that case, our
 knowledge of Brahman arising out of their statements shall
 also become imperfect knowledge."


 nanu saMyaktve.api paroxaGYAnameveti chet.h .

 "(Objection:) Although it is perfect (saMyak), yet it is mediate
 knowledge (parokSha) only."


 na 'yatsAxAt aparoxAdbrahma' (BR^i . up . 3.4.1) iti
 mukhya aparoxavishhayatayaiva visheshhitaH prashnopalambhAt.h .

 "(Reply:) To this we say no, as the questions put were
 especially concerned with the directness and immediateness
 of the knowledge of Brahman: 'That Brahman which is direct
 and immediate (aparokSha)' (B.U. 3.4.1) thus."


There can be no ambiguity about SV's opinion of YAGYavalkya's BrahmaGYAna. SV is not talking about YAGYavalkya as a mere "scholar of the scriptures", but as one who had known Brahman perfectly (saMyak) and immediately (aparokSha). In other words, according to VidyAraNya, YAGYavalkya had saMyak-aparokSha-brahmaGYAna.

But VidyAraNya emphatically denies that YAGYavalkya was a jIvanmukta:

 iyam evaasmadabhimataa jIvanmuktiH. yAGYavalkyaH tu
 vijigIshhudshaayaaM na hIdR^ishaH, cittavishraantaye
 vidvatsaMnyaasasya tena karishhyamANatvaat.h .

 "This is the jIvanmukti we approve of. But YAGYavalkya was
 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
 not in this state while he was still desirous of victory in
 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
 disputation, since he was yet to take the vidvatsannyAsa in
 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
 order to set the mind at rest.
 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Put it simply:

According to VidyAraNya: YAGYavalkya had saMyak-aparokSha-brahmaGYAna.
According to VidyAraNya: YAGYavalkya did NOT have jIvanmukti.

(The reason I place the qualifier "According to VidyAraNya" in the two statements above is because one may perhaps dispute whether VidyAraNya's assessment of YAGYavalkya's BrahmaGYAna is correct, but there can be no doubt that in VidyAraNya's opinion, YAGYavalkya had saMyak-aparokSha-BrahmaGYAna but not jIvanmukti.)

Hence according to VidyAraNya, saMyak-aparokSha-BrahmaGYAna by itself does not constitute jIvanmukti. ***The BrahmaGYAna must ALSO be steady (sthitaM).***

***The "sthitaM" aspect of BrahmaGYAna is precisely what is accomplished by vAsanAkShya-manonAsha.***

I have explained all of this in detail in my postings on the JMV.
