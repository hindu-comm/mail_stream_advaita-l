In the Fourth Chapter of the JIvanmuktiviveka (JMV) by VidyAraNya, there is a discussion on "svarUpasiddhiprayojanaprakaraNam.h" or "The purpose that the accomplishment of jIvanmukti serves". (Page 276 of the translation of the JMV by Swami Moksadananda - all page numbers in this post will be references to this book).

 keyaM jIvanmuktiH, kiM vA tatra pramANam, kathaM vA tatsiddhiH,
 ityetasya prashnatrayasyottaraM nirUpitam . siddhyA vA kiM
 prayojanamityasya chaturthaprashnasyottaramidAnImabhidhIyate
 GYAnarakshAtapovisaMvAdAbhAvaduHkhanAshasukhAvirbhAvAH
 pa~ncha prayojanAni .

 "What is jIvanmukti? What are the proofs of it? And how is it
 accomplished? These three questions have been answered in the
 foregoing chapters. Now the answer to the fourth question -
 'what purpose does the accomplishment of jIvanmukti serve?'
 - is being given.

 The purpose is five-fold: protection of knowledge (GYAna-rakShA);
 practice of religious austerity; absence of disagreement;
 disappearance of sorrow; and appearance of happiness."


 nanu pramANotpannasya tattvaGYAnasya ko nAma bAdhaprasa~Ngo
 yena rakshA apekshyata iti chet .
 uchyate - chittavishrAntyabhAvesaMshaya viparyayau prasajyeyAtAm .
 tathA hi tattvavido rAghavasya vishrAnteH pUrvaM saMshayaM
 vishvAmitra udAjahAra -

 "It may be asked - what is the necessity of protecting knowledge?
 The question of sublation does not arise inasmuch as the
 knowledge of Reality has been obtained through proper evidence.

 The answer is this - in the absence of tranquility of the mind
 (chitta-vishrAnti), doubt (saMshaya) and error (viparyaya)
 may creep in; for instance, VishvAmitra describes the doubt
 in the mind of rAghava, the knower of truth, before it attained
 calmness thus:"


VidyAraNya teaches that GYAna once obtained needs to be "protected" (GYAna-rakShA), because doubt (saMshaya) and error (viparyaya) may creep in due to lack of tranquility of the mind (chitta-vishrAnti). This is quite similar to H.H.'s assertion in the VivekachUDAmaNi commentary that GYAna may become "clouded" with vAsanAs again.

The JMV continues (279-280):

 tasmAdvidite.api tattve vishrAntirahitasya shukarAghavayoriva
 saMshaya utpadyate . sa chAGYAnamiva mokShasya pratibandhakaH . 

 "Therefore, doubt arises in him who is without tranquility
 even though he has known the truth like rAghava and shuka.
 And doubt (saMshaya) is an obstacle to Liberation (mokSha)
 like ignorance (aGYAna)."

VidyAraNya concludes that doubt (saMshaya) is like ignorance (aGYAna), in that it is an obstacle to Liberation (mokSha), and that it may arise AFTER GYAna has been achieved for one who is without tranquility (vishrAntirahitasya). The word used here is "mokSha" which is Liberation with a capital "L", and cannot possibly be interpreted any other way. So VidyAraNya is saying here that one who may have attained to GYAna, but without vAsanAkShaya-manonAsha has NOT attained to mokSha.

Here is a quote from the JMV to the same effect (page 139-140):

 tatra vAsanAkshayaprakAram Aha vasishhThaH -
 bandho hi vAsanAbandho mokShaH syAd vAsanAkshayaH .
 vAsanAstvaM parityajya mokShArthitvam api tyaja .. [LYV 18.20]

 "About the destruction of vAsanAs, VasishhTha said thus -
 'Bondage is truly the bonds of vAsanAs and mokSha is getting rid
 of them. Giving up all vAsanAs, give up even the desire for mokSha.'"

It is clear from the above that mokSha = vAsanAkShaya.

Note that all the instances where GYAna by itself does not constitute mokSha is ONLY for the akR^itopAsti - one without strong sAdhana-chatushhTaya-saMpatti. The GYAna of the kR^itopAsti is immediately steady and without vAsanAs and hence equivalent to mokSha, because he has already secured sAdhana-chatushhTaya-saMpatti before attaining to GYAna.

In fact, H.H. frankly admits being influenced by the JMV in his commentary on VivekachUDAmaNi verse 271 (272 in H.H.'s numbering):

 idaMtu jIvanmuktiviveke vAsanAkshayaprakaraNe
 vidyAraNya-gurucharaNaiH vistareNopapAditaM 
 'ko lokamArAdhayituM samarthaH' ...

 "This has been dealt with in the jIvanmuktiviveka of
 svAmI vidyAraNya, in the chapter on vAsanAkshaya,
 where he says, 'Who is expert in pleasing the world?'..."
