Pranams Shyam ji,

The 'upadesha panchatnam' of the Acharya, in the  last verse too speaks in
the same tenor:

एकान्ते सुखमास्यतां परतरे चेतः समाधीयतां
पूर्णात्मा सुसमीक्ष्यतां जगदिदं तद्बाधितं दृश्यताम् ।
प्राक्कर्म प्रविलाप्यतां चितिबलान्नप्युत्तरैः श्लिष्यतां
प्रारब्धं त्विह भुज्यतां अथ परब्रह्मात्मना स्थीयताम् ॥

Resort to solitude and dive deep into the Atman.  Perceive the Immanent Self
and determine the world sublating in It.  Having burnt the past karma
through knowledge and not getting attached to the ones of the future, thru
discrimination, experience the prArabdha here itself and thereafter remain
established as the Para Brahman.

Best regards,
subbu
