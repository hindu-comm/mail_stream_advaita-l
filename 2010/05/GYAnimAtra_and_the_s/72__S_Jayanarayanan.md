Can you please provide the exact verse from the JMV that says that the akR^itopAsti with aparokSha GYAna (GYAnimAtra) is a *** mukta ***? The verse that is quoted below only says that they have saMyak-GYAna, certainly nothing about "liberation". If anything, note the last line about how they are affected by prArabdha karma - can this be called mukti?!
