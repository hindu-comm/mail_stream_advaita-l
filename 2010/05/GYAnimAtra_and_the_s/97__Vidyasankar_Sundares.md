> The word used by VidyAraNya to qualify saMshaya (doubt) and viparayaya (error) is "utpadyate" (from "utpatti"), meaning "created". VidyAraNya is saying here that saMshaya and viparyaya ARISE OR ARE CREATED due to lack of chitta-vishrAnti (peace of mind), and then functions as an obstacle to Liberation! In other words, it is not that saMshaya remains undestroyed, rather saMshaya ARISES from chitta-vishrAnti after GYAna!

I think  you meant to say saMshaya arises from lack of chitta-vishrAnti above.
