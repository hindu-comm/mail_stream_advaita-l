I am simply pointing to a pertinent discussion in bRhadAraNyaka bhAshya.
Understanding what the bhAshyakAra is saying is up to the reader. The 
question is not whether physical death affects anything, but the fact is
that it occurs to the body. I said that the bhAshya passage says what
that means for both a mumukshu and the jnAnI. Please read this along
with what the gItAbhAshya says about the kRtArtha-lakshaNa-s and how
these have to be cultivated by the sAdhaka through prayatna.
