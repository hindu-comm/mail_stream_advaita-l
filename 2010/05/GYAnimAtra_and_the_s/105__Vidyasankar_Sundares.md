Sankara bhagavatpAda talks fairly extensively of vAsanA-s in the bRhadAraNyaka
bhAshya 4.4.2, when explaining the word pUrva-prajnA. The entire commentary on
the 4th brAhmaNa of the 4th adhyAya of this upanishad (4.4.1 to 4.4.25) should
be read carefully, especially in the context of what happens at physical death and
rebirth and what it all means for a mumukshu and the jnAnI.
