Dear friends,

You may find the following verse from the version of the Bhagavad Gita (containing all the745 verses) interesting:

yadaa sarve pramucyante kaamaa yasya hridi sthitaah,

sa bhavatyamrito martyobrahma chaatrasamasnute.

W
This says that when all the desires staying in the heart are removed that mortal becomes immortal and he attains Brahman here (itself).

Interesting. Is not it?

Regars,

Sunil K. Bhattacharjya

Sankara bhagavatpAda talks fairly extensively of vAsanA-s in the bRhadAraNyaka
bhAshya 4.4.2, when explaining the word pUrva-prajnA. The entire commentary on
the 4th brAhmaNa of the 4th adhyAya of this upanishad (4.4.1 to 4.4.25) should
be read carefully, especially in the context of what happens at physical death and
rebirth and what it all means for a mumukshu and the jnAnI.
