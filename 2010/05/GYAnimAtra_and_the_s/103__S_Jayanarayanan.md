It is a recurring theme in the JMV that vAsanAkShaya is an extremely important requirement for mokSha, with the above quote being only one among dozens attesting to the fact that one who has not undergone vAsanAkShaya has not yet attained to mokSha. If your reading of the JMV implies otherwise, I strongly disagree, having already given manifold reasons in my previous posts (including the above quote)!

I split this thread into two so that we can at least have agreement on one point, but it seems it has sprung multiple heads like Hydra :-)

I'm really tired of this thread, and hence will lay it to rest here (hopefully these words will be true!).
