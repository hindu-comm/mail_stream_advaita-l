The above equation is clearly not the one held by the ShAstra.  The JMV
itself has stated in categorical terms, which I quoted earlier in caps:
Atma Jnana is sought by one  ONLY  with a view to be free from the
possibility of obtaining another body.  And when this is achieved,  there
ensues the jnAnasamakAleena videha mukti, not to wait for death to occur.
This is the cherished view of videha mukti of Vidyaranya.  So, how do we
explain Vidyaranya quoting the above verses of the LYV?

We shall consider an analogy: There is a karmakAnDa passage: अपाम सोमं अमृता
अभूम  This passage means: the drinking of the Soma (juice) confers
immortality.  Now, we know that immortality is really had only upon Atma
jNana and this juice-born immortality is only relative; it confers a very
long life in a heaven.  This statement, then, is clearly meant to woo people
to perform such yaga-s.  It is arthavAda.  In the same way, the LYV is in a
serious vaasanaakshaya teaching mode.  It has to say so if the teaching is
to be taken seriously and implemented.  The aspirant will conclude: No
vAsanAkshaya, no liberation for me.  Seen in this light, there is no
contradiction between what Vidyaranya has categorically stated: 'Atma Jnana
confers moksha'  and the LYV quote.  In fact Vidyaranya has also assigned a
secondary role to vk and mn in helping Atma jnana.  And here too there is no
contradiction: The AkRtopAsti case is clearly demonstrated where the vk and
mn have indeed been practiced and the Atma Jnana achieved without the
standard three obstacles.  Thus, taking the LYV statement as arthavada or
taking vk to be a means to Jnana and thru that to moksha, does not weaken my
position

In any case, the above quoting of the LYV by Vidyaranya does not contradict
his cherished view of videhamukti had at the moment of Atmajnana.

It is not any case of 'reverting'.  Even if he is going to quote a hundred
verses talking of the videhamukti upon death, his cherished view stands
unopposed.  For, its application is in a different context and the
application of the LYV stated manonasha is in a different context.  Mere
quoting of such verses does not mean that Vidyaranya has given up his
cherised view which is also the view of Shanikaracharya as being the purport
of the Upanishads, as I have pointed out before.

Actually, the very lengthy discussion of this topic was ONLY intended to
establish beyond doubt the shastra abhimata videha mukti view.  It is common
in the texts that when the siddhAntin wants to establish a particular view,
he himself raises a pUrvapaksha and initiates a discussion at the end of
which he establishes his view.  So, all his efforts in doing so is not just
to boil down to what you have assumed to be the case.

I have already said that the word 'needs' is not the correct translation.
If that were the intent of Vidyaranya, and if that had been the fact too,
why would Vidyaranya go to great lengths arguing the clearly
jivanmukti-unfriendly case of Yajnavalkya and Bhagiratha and establish that
their moksha is unquestionable both ways:  the moment they became
enlightened AND after their death?

I have already answered this objection when I addressed the equation:
VasanAkshaya = moksha in an earlier paragraph/post.
