Dear Karthik,

The quote from the JMV (see below) clearly says that the akRtopaasti, with
aparoksha jnAnam *does have real, liberating, Jnana and that their Jnana
does not fade and the avidya that has been dispelled is not reversed.*

They do not have vaasanakshaya and manonasha to the extent that merits the
title 'jivanmukta' to them.  Nevertheless they are 'vidaan'. He is a mukta
for whom the avidya nivRtti has taken place due to samyag jnana.  The
akRtopAsti of the JMV has both these accomplished.

The 'prayatna' that you and the JMV have mentioned is only to achieve
mano-nasha and vasana kshaya.  He need not make any prayatna for
samyagjnanam; he has already made that and achieved it.  The JMV is very
clear about that.

In your quote, the English translation provided by you is slightly incorrect
to the original:

 tasmAdidanIMtanAnAM vidvatsaMnyAsinAM
> GYAnasyAnuvR^ittimAtram.h .
> >   vAsanAkshayamanonAshau tu
> prayatnasaMpAdyAv iti sthitam .

> vidvatsannyIs of these days only
> >   the GYAna continues. VAsanAkshaya and
> manonAsha are to be

> steady (sthitaM)."

The words 'prayatnasaMpAdyAv iti sthitam' of the original only means:
'vaasanakshaya and manonaasha are to be achieved by effort'. (note the
dvi-vachanam for prayatnasampaadyvav) The word 'sthitam' of the original has
been translated by you as 'make it steady'.  This is not the way it is.  The
original uses the word 'sthitam' only to say that 'the fact is that this
akRitopAsti has to put in efforts to achieve vk and mn.  This is certain -
iti sthitam. '  He uses the word 'sthitam' here to say that such is the
'settled' view.

In the JMV the vidvat sanyasi of the akRtopAsti type is a mukta,  only
requiring to do something to become a jivanmukta.  The vidvat sanyasi who is
a kRtopAsti is also a mukta and a jivanmukta at that not requiring prayatna
for vk and mn.

Nowadays men rush in quest of Jnana,  out of sheer curiosity, in most cases
even without going through the preliminary stage of upasana.  *They even
reach the stage of obliteration of vasana and the dissolution of the mind
for the time being*, and in consequence, study, contemplation and
assimilation (of the VEdanta) are also fully accomplished by repeated
application to these three; ignorance, doubt and false perception are
demolished; *and real Jnana is achieved*.  In the absence of a more powerful
means to counteract it and of any cause which can resuscitate the ignorance
dispelled by it, *the resultatnt Jnana does not fade.*  *But then the
obliteration of vasana and the dissolution of the mind are easily
extinguished*, like a lamp exposed to the breeze, for want of steady
application and in consequence of being influenced, from time to time, by
the fruit-bearing previous karma.

From the above the is clear :
 the second type, (akRtopAsti) according to JMV, is an aparoksha jnani, a
mukta, not to return to samsara,

I have shown the 'prayatna' is not for samyagjnanam; only for vk and mn.
Even without this prayatna he is a mukta; the prayatna is his option; he may
or may not do it.  vk and mn are NOT mandatory for moksha; they ARE
mandatory for jivanmukti.
