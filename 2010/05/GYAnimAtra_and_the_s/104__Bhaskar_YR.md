tatra vAsanAkshayaprakAram Aha vasishhThaH -
bandho hi vAsanAbandho mokShaH syAd vAsanAkshayaH .
vAsanAstvaM parityajya mokShArthitvam api tyaja .. [LYV 18.20] "About the 
destruction of vAsanAs, VasishhTha said thus -'Bondage is truly the bonds 
of vAsanAs and mokSha is getting rid of them. Giving up all vAsanAs, give 
up even the desire for mokSha.'" it is clear from the above that mokSha = 
vAsanAkShaya.

I agree with the above equation without any reservations prabhuji..Because 
shankara himself quite categorically expresses his opinion about mOksha & 
declares unambiguously that avidyA nivrutti is itself mOksha & there is no 
obstacle other than this (avidyA) for the mOksha..Atleast I hope 
vAsanAkshaya here means 'avidyA nivrutti'..na chAjnAna vyatirekeNa 
mOkshasya vyavadhAnAntaraM kalpayituM shakyaM!!  says shankara in bruhad 
bhAshya.  It is through our whimsical thinking we assume that there is a 
GAP between Atma jnAna & mOksha and two are different stages in the 
mumukshu/sAdhaka.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
