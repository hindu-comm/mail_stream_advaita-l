Yes.  We have a somewhat peculiar situation here.  As long as one lives
after realization, one will have to 'live' with the body-mind apparatus.
Since the mind is the locus of vasana-s and that one will have to face it,
the shAstra teaches that it is better one has a mind free of vasana-s,
especially the troublesome ones.  And that is the genesis of
jivanmuktiviveka, the practice of vasanakshaya and manonasha.  This aspect,
'being free of vasana-s', of mukti is, however, temporary.  It is only
life-specific.  Whereas, being free of birth is the mukhya mukti. It is the
natural state of  Brahman: ajam.

That is the general translation of the term 'videha mukti'.  However, Sri
Vidyaranya has deliberated much on this and concluded that for him 'videha
mukti' means 'the state that ensures, even now, that a future body will not
ensue'.  Also, he quotes the Sutra bhasyam in support of the view that
'videha mukti' is had 'at the very moment jnana dawns'.  The Jnani instantly
gains the unshakable conviction that he is in truth 'a-shareeri'.
'Ashareeratvam' is the nature of Brahman and the Jnani realizes that to be
his true nature.  Nevertheless, the shastra, Sri Bhagavatpada and Sri
Vidyaranya, do not deny the continuance of the body-mind apparatus that has
already begun to be and will go on for the period it is destined to.  Hence
they have a need to talk about jivanmukti too.
