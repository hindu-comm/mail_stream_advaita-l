The akR^itopAsti (or more precisely, the GYAnimAtra) is not a mukta, and is never mentioned as such in the JMV. Mukti implies that no further effort needs to be made towards the goal of liberation. But the JMV uses the word "prayatna" in reference to this second kind (see quote above), with the implication that this person still has to make further effort (prayatna) to achieve vAsnAkShaya-manonAsha, and hence cannot yet be considered a mukta.

The main reason for the distinction between the kR^itopAsti and the akR^itopAsti is that the former has already achieved vAsanAkShaya-manonAsha by making effort in karma-upAsana prior to VedAntic enquiry, while the latter has not. Hence when the kR^itopAsti achieves saMyak-GYAna, he immediately attains to the status of the sthitapraGYa or jIvanmukta - as the triad of GYAna-vAsanAkShya-manonAsha have all been achieved. Whereas the akR^itopAsti first reaches the state of the GYAnimAtra and then through effort in vAsanAkShaya-manonAsha, finally attains the status of the sthitapraGYa.

Here's an instance where Ramana agreed with the JMV:

 "Some extraordinary persons get drdha jnana (unshaken knowledge)
 even on hearing the Truth only once (sakrchhravana matrena).
 Because they are krthopasakah (advanced seekers), whereas the
 akrthopasakah (raw seekers) take longer to gain drdha jnana
 (unshaken knowledge)."
