This says that when all the desires staying in the heart are removed that 
mortal becomes immortal and he attains Brahman here (itself).

Hare Krishna

mundaka shruti also says the same thing : bhidyate hrudaya granThiH 
chidyante sarva saMshayAH, ksheeyante chAsya karmANi tasmin drushte 
parAvare..Even after realizing this ultimate truth & even after effacement 
of all doubts & knots if one sees nAnAtva in brahman then he attains death 
after death : mrutyOH sa mrutyuM gacchati ya iha nAneva pashyati...(kaTha 
shruti)...and shankara too confirms this in bruhad bhAshya that : 
tasmAdihaive brahmaiva sun brahmApyeti, na shareerapAtOttara 
kAlaM...brahma jnAna/mOksha is not something lokAntara, janmAnta, 
kAlAntara jnAna...it is the jnAna that can be realized here in this very 
life...

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
