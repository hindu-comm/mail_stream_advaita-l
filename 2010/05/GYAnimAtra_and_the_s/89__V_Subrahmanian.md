But has not Vidyaranya himself upheld 'his cherished view' on videhamukti?
There can be no such implication as supposed above if one were to understand
the statement in the proper light.  One (the first reference to the LYV) is
to be seen as the 'adhyAropa' and the other, the later established
'cherished view' as the  'apavAda'.  Advaita, for instance,  accepts
Brahman, in association with Maya, as the creator of the universe.  There is
also the teaching that the jiva creates the universe through his ajnana.
There can be no contradiction in this.  Again, Gaudapada  himself points out
that the sRiShTi taught by the Upanishad is only an adhyaropa, its apavada
lying in the negation of all duality.

I see no talk of 'mukti' or 'moksha' in the above dialogue.  It is all about
whether or not raga, etc. are admissible in a jnani or not.  It concludes
that in the sthitaprajna raga, etc. will not be manifesting the way they are
seen to  be in a jnAnimAtra.  On the contrary, this dialogue culminates in
Vidyaranya categorically asserting that the presence of raga, etc. in
Yajnavalkya and the like is no deterrant for their liberation.

I agree with you on this.  I made the above remarks so  that what I stated
regarding Shankara and Vidyaranya is  not seen as implying a disagreement
between them.  I have only shown how much they agree on the view of videha
mukti.
