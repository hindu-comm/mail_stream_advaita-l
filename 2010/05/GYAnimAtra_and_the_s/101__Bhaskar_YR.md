There is only one difference between the akR^itopAsti mentioned above and 
the case of rAghava/shuka mentioned in the fourth chapter of the JMV - 
there is no "cause" for the utpatti of saMshaya and viparyaya in the 
former's case. I will agree with you on this much.

praNAms Sri Karthik prabhuji
Hare Krishna

Just a curios question who are these rAghava and shuka (or both names 
denoting the same person??)  is this shuka is vyAsa putra shuka maharshi, 
a born jnAni??  what exactly is the reason the JMV quotes for not 
qualifying these two personalities as akrutOpAsti?? 

No intention of any debate on this issue prabhuji, just an inquisitive 
question...

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
