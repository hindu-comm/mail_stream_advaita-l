It is apparent from the above that you feel free to speak from one "commonly held" viewpoint that does not necessarily agree with the JMV.

I don't know how to answer that, except that I prefer to speak purely from the standpoint of an authoritative text, such as the JMV, especially in matters concerning GYAna and mukti. Otherwise, we arrive at strange concepts like "mukta with a living body, but not jIvanmukta", which are difficult to comprehend (to say the least)!
