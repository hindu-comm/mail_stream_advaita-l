Sri Gurubhyon Namaha
 Any prathima that is bigger than your angushtam requires special poojas, the bigger the prathima the greater the procedure, please keep that in mind when you install vigrahas at home, as this can cause trouble to you and your dear ones if proper procedure is not followed, instead have that installed in a temple that you go often not only you others can also be benifitted. 

WRT Viveka choodamani which lang are you looking at.

Sri Kamakshi
Raghav

Subject: Re: [Advaita-l] Assistance required please

Would like to install a statue of Sri Adi Sankaracharya at my new 
home in India. Am unable to locate one. Have even tried the Math 
websites. Can anyone here please assist?

praNAms
Hare Krishna

Any idol/statue befoe installation needs pratimAshuddhi through pancha 
gavya etc. Kindly dont install the pratima as it is straight from the 
show room or math..If the pratima is available in math, math authorities 
would themselves tell you the vaidika procedure to install the statue.

Just a friendly suggestion.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
