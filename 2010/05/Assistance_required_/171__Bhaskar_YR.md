That is vigraha-s of devata-s and other divine beings. I don't think that 
applies to statues of humans.

Yes, if the buyer wants to keep this idol in a show case & wants to 
display this idol during navaratri festical along with other dolls then 
pratimA shuddhi is not necessary...But if one wants to keep this idol in 
pooja room & wants to offer pooja / guru vandana every day or on 
auspicious occassions then vaidika vidhi pUrvaka pratimA shuddhi is 
required.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
