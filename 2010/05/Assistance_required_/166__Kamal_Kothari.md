Namaskaar

Need some inputs on following. Thanks in advance for help.

1. Would like to install a statue of Sri Adi Sankaracharya at my new 
home in India. Am unable to locate one. Have even tried the Math 
websites. Can anyone here please assist?

2. Looking for a CD/VCD/AudioCassettes set of Commentary on 
Vivekachoodamani. Pls suggest?

Regards

Kamal
