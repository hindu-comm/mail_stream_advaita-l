Would like to install a statue of Sri Adi Sankaracharya at my new 
home in India. Am unable to locate one. Have even tried the Math 
websites. Can anyone here please assist?

praNAms
Hare Krishna

Any idol/statue befoe installation needs pratimAshuddhi through pancha 
gavya etc.  Kindly dont install the pratima as it is straight from the 
show room or math..If the pratima is available in math, math authorities 
would themselves tell you the vaidika procedure to install the statue.

Just a friendly suggestion.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
