It is not correct to suspect Swami Satchidanandendra Saraswathi was wrong seeing the defense from his disciples.  Each one is limited in his/her comprehension and expression. Speaking for myself, I have severe limitations for a full fledged study, and I am not qualified to speak of his works. Bhaskar, on the other hand, is doing a wonderful job responding to the threads with what little time he has. One should study and decipher this on their own in my opinion before they come to a conclusion.

Regards,
Savithri
