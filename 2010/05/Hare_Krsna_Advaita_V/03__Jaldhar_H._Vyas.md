Bhaskar,

Very admirable outlook!  Your "job" as it were is to express your 
understanding. You should not feel ashamed or apologetic for holding 
honestly held views.  Only thing is if you are persuaded that some view of 
your is in error, then you should be willing to change your mind.

And that applies to all sides.  For instance when I asked about adhikarins 
it was not a "aha got you!" verbal trap.  I am genuinely interested in 
what Swami Sacchidanandendra Saraswati has to say.  Although given the 
evidence presented so far I suspect he is wrong on some of the subjects 
under discussion, his intelligence and scholarship are too great to simply 
dismiss out of hand.
