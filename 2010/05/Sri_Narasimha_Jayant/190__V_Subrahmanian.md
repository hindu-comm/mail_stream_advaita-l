Namaste.

The Sri Narasimha Jayanthi is observed on the 26th May 2010 (Wednesday).
The Ashtottaram (108) in English and Devanagari, along with the Dhyana
shloka is available at:

http://adbhutam.wordpress.com/2010/05/25/sri-narasimha-ashtottaram/

In the tradition, people do a puja and read the Prahlada Charitram from the
Srimad Bhagavatam.

Anyone interested in a word file of the ashtottaram can contact me by
email.
