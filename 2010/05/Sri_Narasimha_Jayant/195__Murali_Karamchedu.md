Dear List Members,

Here are some beautiful verses from the Vishnu Purana (19th adhyaya) which are 
part of Prahlada's stuti. For those interested, here are the links to Vishnu Purana:

Om namo vAsudevAya tasmai bhagavate sadA |
vyatirikta.m na yasyAsti vyatirikto'khilasya yaH ||
[apart from whom, nothing exists, and who is apart from all.]

...

Om namo vishNave tasmai namastasmai punaH punaH |
yatra sarvam yataH sarvam yaH sarvam sarvasamSrayaH ||
[In whom is all, from whom all comes, who is all and is the basis of all.]

sarvagatvAdanantasya sa evAhamavasthitaH |
mattaH sarvamaham sarvam mayi sarvam sanAtane ||
[Since the endless one is all encompassing, he indeed is fashioned as me.
All is from me, I am all, and all exists in the ancient me.]

ahamevAkSayo nityaH paramAtmA AtmasamSrayaH |
brahmasa.mjno'hamevAgre tathAnte ca paraH pumAn ||
[I am indeed the unwithering, eternal paramAtma - the basis of the self.
I am the superlative being - the brahman, existing at the creation of the 
universe as well as its end.]


Regards,
Murali Manohar
