Namaste Sada ji,

Yes. These are the ones that are taught in the YogavAsiShTha.
I find these references in the Jivanmuktiviveka Chapter 4 where the Laghu
Yoga VAsishTha 13.113, 114, 116 to 123  verses are quoted.

Thus, these seven bhUmika-s are taught in the YV and the Laghu YV as well.

They are quoted and explained in the JMV and the SwArAjyasiddhi.

Best regards,
subbu
