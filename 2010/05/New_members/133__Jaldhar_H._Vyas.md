Sundari. would like to get a better understanding of advita which is the

Akshay Peshwe

I am Akshay Peshwe, 20 years of age, from Pune. I am of rgvedik brAhmaNa 
lineage. Although I personally side with nyAya thought currently, I have 
been fascinated by AV and seek to comprehend it in ways it has been 
propounded by teachers before SaMkarAcArya. It is an honour for me to 
participate here and to provide whatever little I can from my external but 
non-contradictory viewpoint.
