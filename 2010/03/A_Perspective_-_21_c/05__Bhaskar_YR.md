In that sense bhoutika sanyaasa is helpful if one can
take it. Otherwise maanasika sanyaasa is a must for withdrawing the mind
from dependence on things other than oneself for one's happiness.

Though I am not qualified to talk on both forms of sanyAsa (bhautika & 
mAnasika) it appears to me  that shankara emphasizes the importance of 
bhautika sanyAsa as against the practice of mAnasika saNyAsa by house 
holders.  As we know, in the path of sAdhana we need the shama damAdi 
sAdhana sampatti..shankara says in bhAshya that 'shama, dama' etc. are 
possible & can be practiced true to its spirit only in atyAshrama but not 
possible in 'anyAshrama'!!  shamadamAdeenAM cha Atmadarshana sAdhanAnAM 
anyAshrameshu aupapatteH, 'atyAshramibhyaH'  parama 
pavitraM......brahmacharyAdi vidyAsAdhanAnAM  cha sAkalyena atyAshramishu 
upapatteH gArhastye asaMbhavAt...Elsewhere shankara also says for the 
mumukshu, pArivrAjyam is kartavyaM ( it is an obligatory duty of the 
mumukshu to take pArivrAjya saNyAsa)...if we see all these bhAshya 
vAkya-s, we would get the impression that in sAdhana mArga, bhautika 
saNyAsa with mumukshatva is the must for a brahma jignAsu...Anyway, since 
I am an ordinary  house-holder (gruhastha), I would like to hear the 
arguments that favours gruhasthAshrama sAdhaka-s.  Hence I would prefer 
karmaphala tyAga saNyasa to sarva karma saNyAsa being a gruhastha:-))

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
