Bhaskarji - PraNAms

Yes that is true for those who are holding on to the house.

There is sloka from Manu smriti
sarvam paravaSham duHkham sarvam aatmavaSham sukham|
yetat vidyaat samaasena lakshaNam sukha duHkhayoH||

 Dependence other than oneself is a cause for suffering and Dependence on
ones own  self is Happiness. This in brief is the definiton for eternal
happiness or suffering. Moksha is freedome from all dependence other than on
oneself - aatmani eva aatmanaa tuShTaH.

In essence sanyaasa is to give any dependence on anything other than
oneself. It is mental more than physical as we see around.

Hari Om!
