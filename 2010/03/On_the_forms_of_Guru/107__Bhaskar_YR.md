I felt it to be a technical discussion rather than objective enlightenment 
as in my view the mind is not
only useless but the greatest impediment and a fetter.

I dont think mind is an utter useless in brhmajignAsa.  A shama damAdi 
susamskruta mana is Atma darshana karaNa (sAstrAchAryOpadesha shama damAdi 
saMskrutaM manaH Atmadarshane karaNaM) says shankara in geeta bhAshya. 
manasaivedamAptavyaM nena nAnAsti kiNchana so says shruti.. So, we cannot 
push aside the utility of mana prior to self realization.  But this mana 
would not be anymore 'individual' mana to the samyak darshi jnAni and for 
him 'sarvaM' khalvidaM brahma...like kAtaka powder (example given by 
shankara), mana losts its individuality in jnAni and he dissolves himself 
in upAdhi rahita paripUrNa jnAna.  This does not man jnAni in his pre 
realization period has the individual mind & in post realization period 
this would vanish in thin air..His realization reveals him the fact that 
he was/is/will be always THAT without any upAdhi saMbandha !!

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
