Sadanandaji,

Pranaams.

"Anyway from my perspective I saw the difference in arguments stemming from
the change of reference state."

True.  It is precisely the nature of human discussion which is always
partial because of the standpoint.

Arjuna's contention in chapter I and II should be right if standpoint is
holy.  The rest of the Geetha's 18 chapters are in repudiation of Arjuna's
false notions.

My intervention arose from what I considered to be the undue importance to
the mind which is the generator of falsehood.  I felt it to be a technical
discussion rather than objective enlightenment as in my view the mind is not
only useless but the greatest impediment and a fetter.

You may differ with me on that.  So be it.

Regards,
