It is not from the standpoint of brahman but from the standpoint of
the jIva only. Just as the body is objectifiable, so is the mind.

Let the jury be out on it. It is still besides the point. Again I
repeat, not being able to know something because of the absence of
instruments is different from not being able to objectify it. Whether
one jIva can know another jIva's mind or not, s/he can still objectify
it. Even when a person A says "I cannot understand what is in B's
mind", it is still an objectification by A of B's mind.
