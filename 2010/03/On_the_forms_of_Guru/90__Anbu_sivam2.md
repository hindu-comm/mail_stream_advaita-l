"The onlooker might go wrong in assessing the (contents, working of) other
person's mind but that does not lead to the conclusion that the mind is not
there or that it cannot be an object of others."

Why is it difficult to understand me?  I did emphasize that everyone has a
mind.  All I said was that your mind is no object for me.  If I thought that
your mind is my object then it is just my fancy and not real.

You keep saying that your mind can be object for others and so is everyone's
mind.  I repeatedly pointed out that such view is illogical, impractical and
eludes common sense.

But you keep insisting!

Let's agree to disagree on that, shall we?
