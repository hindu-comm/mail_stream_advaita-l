Dear Sri Subrahmanian,



I just intended to withdraw from further exchange personally. I didn't mean to
convey a closure of the entire thread as a moderator decision at all. So other
members of the list are quite welcome to continue this and other related threads
of discussion to their logical ends. We haven't yet heard from Bhaskar, a frequent
contributor on these kinds of topics.


In my opinion, these kinds of discussion, even if they get heated, are much more
welcome than unending discussions of controversies and history! They help us all
to sharpen our philosophical thinking and improve our understanding. vAde vAde
jAyate tattva-jnAnam.



Regards,

Vidyasankar
