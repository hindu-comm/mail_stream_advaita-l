hRt (Sanskrit), heart (English), herz (German), hjarta (Swedish/Icelandic),
hjerte (Norwegian/Danish), hart (Dutch), cardia (Greek) - all have a common
ancestry in the Indo-European languages. There is a good reason for the
translation and part of the connotation is the physical heart. In all these
languages, there are also many non-literal usages of the word heart, e.g.
to lose heart, to steal one's heart, etc. Even in English, the word heart
does not refer only to the physical organ.



Also, "the physical heart is on the left side" is overdone in common talk. It
is really quite along the center of the chest. There is a slight leftward tilt
in its orientation - that is all. If it were substantially on the left side, there
would be no room for the left lung! When we point to the chest and talk
of hRdaya, our fingers land on the sternum bone, almost exactly on top
of the physical heart. We don't point over the right pectoral muscle.

It should be perfectly obvious to anyone, from the context, when the word
"heart" is used to refer to the physical organ and when the word is used in
a non-literal manner. In my opinion, there is no need to go on and posit
another entity, also called heart, non-physical in nature, but still physically
located in the body on the right side of the chest. I mean no disrespect to
Ramana Maharishi here. I would request you to see whether he said this
himself or if it was something a disciple asked and he merely said, "yes,
people say this." There is a world of difference between the two scenarios.
A lot of what people attribute to Ramana Maharishi lies in the questions that
his disciples and devotees put to him, not quite in the answers that he gave!


Finally, returning to the vedAntic source-texts, even the location of the
Atman/ISvara in the heart is meant primarily to focus a sAdhaka's attention.
The Atman is really all-pervading - there is no one place where it is nor is
there any place where it is not.

It should be clear that I am pointing to a view that is timeless, more ancient
than ancient and more modern than modern, because I base them on the
upanishad-s and their commentaries. But you are always welcome to differ;
no need to feel sorry about it!



I presume your view about the mind being located at the throat is based on
the taittirIya passage, "antareNa tAluke | ya esha stana iva ..." Again, this
is not meant literally, but only to focus attention as part of a meditation. This
is made clear in the upanishad itself at the end of the same anuvAka, "iti 
prAcInayogya upAssva |" (Meditate thus, O Pracinayogya).

Let me clarify that I neither privilege Western education nor deny that it
has made a deep mark on Indian thinking in the recent past and now has
a permanent place there for the conceivable future. And it is unfair to
disparage Western education by comparing it with parA vidyA. Because,
standard Eastern education also, of whatever variety, is still aparA vidyA,
nowhere near the parA vidyA.

Best regards,
Vidyasankar
