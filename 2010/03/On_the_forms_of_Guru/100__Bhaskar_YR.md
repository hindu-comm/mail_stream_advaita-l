I just intended to withdraw from further exchange personally. I didn't 
mean to
convey a closure of the entire thread as a moderator decision at all. So 
other
members of the list are quite welcome to continue this and other related 
threads
of discussion to their logical ends. We haven't yet heard from Bhaskar, a 
frequent
contributor on these kinds of topics.

sAshtAnga praNAms Sri Vidya prabhuji

Actually, before writing in detail  on 'avidya lesha' I was thinking of 
doing some homework...But due to severe time constraints I am not able to 
do that sofar...At office, Ist quarter work is hectic, at home instead of 
doing homework on 'jnAni's avidyA lesha, I have been doing school 'home 
work' of my kids :-)) As usual, my wife too ever demanding & being a 
gruhastha I cannot ignore her demands on week ends outings...and more 
importantly IPL cricket matches!!  Kindly dont think I am unfolding my 
'personal rAmAyaNa' before you..just I wanted to bring to your notice  how 
difficult it is to prioritize vedAnta & related issues being a pure 
saMsAri. 

Yes,  a healthy discussion on tattva is a part of shrauta manana...but 
here what we are seeing is vAde vAde jAyate 'vittanda' vAdaM...For 
example, Sri Subbu prabhuji, in his over enthu, selectively quoted my 
guruji's Kannada vAkya from sUtra bhAshya to show that even my guruji is 
in favour of 'avidyA lesha'...But he deliberately avoided the foot note in 
that same work where Sri SSS specifically mentioned that in the above 
bhAshya vachana there is no scope for 'avidya lesha'...( in Kannada : 
melena vAkyadalli 'avidya lesha' vaadavu illa vembudannu gamanisabeku). 
Now you tell me prabhuji, how can I continue my discussion with a 'vAdi' 
who wants (at any cost) to show me that I am wrong!!  If he is really 
objective in his discussion, he would have definitely quoted the remarks 
at foot note of my parama guruji's work to represent the correct stand of 
my parama guruji.. is it not?? Anyway, I shall continue to do my exercise 
with him if time permits prabhuji.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
