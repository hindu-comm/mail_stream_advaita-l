Dear Anbuji,

Permit me to differ. hRt is the Antahkarana or the Chit, which consists of the Mind, Buddhi and Ahankara. The Atma's psition is in the Chit or the Antahkarana in the sense that .there is reflection of the atma in the Chit when there is preponderence of the Sattva guna. A difficult concept is'nt it?

Regards,

Sunil K. Bhattacharjya

"No. It is not only an assumption that all living beings have minds.
Sruti and smRti also convey to us information about the mind.
When bhagavAn kRshNa says, ISvaras sarvabhUtAnAM hRd-deSe
'rjuna tishThati, we are explicitly taught that all beings (sarva
bhUta) have something called a hRt, which is but another term
for what is called mind in the English language. As such, I don't
need to assume anything at all about the existence or otherwise
of another's mind. As I said in an earlier post, there can be no
loka vyavahAra at all, without granting the mental processes of
all beings. Whether the mind is ultimately real or not, or whether
it is destroyed or not, or when it is destroyed, that is not the
issue at all for your fundamental argument above."

I missed this one. The word hRt is used for the aathman and not the mind.
Take Bhagavan's UpadhEsa Saaram for example in which he says:

hrtsthalE mana: svasthathaa kriyaa |
bhakthiyOgabOdhaascha nischitham ||

The practice of fixing the mind in its own source viz. the Heart is, without
doubt, true bhakthi, yoga and gnyaana.

When Maharshi was asked specifically about this verse by Devaraja Mudaliar
"What is the heart referred to...?"

Maharshi replied: "That which is the source of all, that in which all live,
and that into which all finally merge, is the heart referred to."

Mudaliar continued: "How can we conceive of such a heart?"

Maharshi replied: "Why should you conceive of anything?You have only to
see from where the 'I' springs."
