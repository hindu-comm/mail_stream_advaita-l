If SSS insists this is not avidya lesha it is for us to be informed as to
what he understands by the term 'avidya lesha.'

Hare Krishna

My friendly suggestion, Instead of asking your friend over phone for each 
and everything about Sri SSS & his works, it is better to buy his works 
and read it on your own.  Before asking the  understanding of Sri SSS, 
please let this forum know what do you mean by avidyA lesha..for that 
first you have to explain what is avidyA according to you & how this 
avidyA can find place in the form of lesha even in samyak jnAni...For 
further clarity, you can also explain me what is avidyAlesha according to 
panchapAdika vivaraNakAra ??  since you are a voracious reader of various 
commentaries of vyAkhyAnakAra-s,  I am asking this question to you...Let 
me first get the clarification from you what is avidya lesha as per your 
school of thought.  then I shall try to write what type of avidyA lesha 
refuted by Sri SSS in his works.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
