Who says a Gyaani is undergoing anything in this
prakrthi?  Then what will be the difference between gnyaani and agnyaani?
Just the idea he knows and other one does not know?  What about Aanandha 
to
which He is privy and the ordinary jeeva is not?  The moment you are in
Aanandha the prakrithi disappears for you.   The scriptures and the Gurus
say this however no amount of quotations would suffice.   This one has to
find it out for himself.

Seeing a 'Gnyaani suffers' is a standpoint of agnyaani.  The agnyaani
recognizes only the body and then from there the mind in the body.

praNAms Sri Anbusivam prabhuji
Hare Krishna

This is a good point prabhuji...yes, if the jnAni's absolute realization 
is mere intellectual understanding and if he continues to 'operate' in his 
individual BMI even after 'becoming' brahma (!!??) then he is no better 
than a hypocrite...But it is a matter of fact that jnAni's suffering is 
only in ajnAni's perception, if that is not true and jnAni is indeed 
suffering from the ailment  & enjoying the luxuring of  his 'own' body 
then jnAni 'must be identifying himself with his BMI!!  If we literally 
interpret each & every activity of the jnAni, then we have to say 
rAmAyaNa's rAma in mAnusha janma was not a brahma jnAni coz. without 
identifying himself with a male kshatriya body, he would not have married 
seeta there was no question of his twin kids kusha-lava...  krishna 
without identifying himself with the gOpAlaka body, couldnot have married 
16000 and odd women...there would have been no thousands & thousands of 
kids to him (bhAgavata says he had thousands & thousands of sons:-)) 
Taking shruti,  smruti & purANa  characters & their socalled activities 
literally would do more harm to the stature of those noble character than 
proving the individual BMI to jnAni :-))

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
