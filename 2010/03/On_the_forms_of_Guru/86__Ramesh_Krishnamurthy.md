Anbu-ji, it is clear that you are not understanding what is meant by
"object" or "objectification" at all.

That itself shows that the mind is being objectified, i.e. one person
is objectifying the other person's mind.

When one person is being curious about another's intention, it is an
objectification of the other's mind.

Your mind can be an object of my study, but the Atman is not objectifiable.
