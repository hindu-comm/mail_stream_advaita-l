I thank you for drawing my attention to the foot note you have referred
above.  Actually, I copied the Kannada translation as another person read it
to me over the phone as I do not have the books with me.  Neither he
bothered about the foot note nor did I have the presence of mind to ask him
to see if there was one.  I should have been wiser! It is well known that
SSS gives expression to his personal views that are not in accordance with
the Bhashya in the foot notes which readers who are not adherents of his
views ignore.

Even if I had noticed that foot note, I would not have been surprised.  I
would have only included it in my presentation and asked a further question:
How does SSS explain the Bhashya vAkya containing the word 'samskAra
vashAt'?

Best regards,
