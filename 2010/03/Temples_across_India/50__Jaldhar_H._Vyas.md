You are right.  It is the Mathura Chaubes who are the most "famous" in my 
neck of the woods though.

This site has some more information on them:

To get back on topic, the article mentions in passing that it was 
Shankaracharya who divided the Brahmanas into pancha dravida and pancha 
gauda which is almost certainly not true.  But it just goes to show that 
Shankaracharya being the defender of tradition par excellence has become 
associated in the popular imagination with all sorts of traditions.
