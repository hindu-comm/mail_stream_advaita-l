Namaste.

At the end of the Bhashya for the Brahmasutra तत्तु समन्वयात्  the Acharya
quotes three verses teaching pure Advaita.  Scholars have identified these
verses to be of one Sundara Pandya.  Eminent Vidvan Sri Mani Dravid
Sastrigal said in his Sutra Bhashyam class that this Sundara Pandya has
written vyAkhyAnam for the Purva and uttara MImAmsA and that his verses are
quoted even in the pUrva mImAmsA bhashyam.

Who is this author? What is his period? What are his other works? Are any of
his works available in their complete form?  Members may provide information
on these.  That Bhagavatpada finds it fit to quote him shows that this
author is no mean authority.  It also tells us about pre-ShAnkaran or even
pre-Gaudapada advaita, perhaps.

Someone who has direct access to Sri Mani Dravid Sastrigal in Chennai could
perhaps take up these questions with him and report.
