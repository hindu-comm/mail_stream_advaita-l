It is probable that sundara pANDya was from the south, but for purely
sociological reasons at that time in Indian history, I would doubt the
identification of a scholar/teacher named sundara pANDya with a king
of the pANDya dynasty from Madurai. 



As for the Saiva or other leanings of Sankara bhagavatpAda, that is a
much-debated topic where all sides make too many leaps in judgement,
without looking into the bhAshya-s as a whole. That is a topic for a very
different discussion!

Vidyasankar
