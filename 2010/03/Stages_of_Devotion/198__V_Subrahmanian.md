Namaste.

A friend drew my attention to the following link which has a reference to
the above verse:

http://brahmanisone.blogspot.com/2009/08/shloka-from-madhusudana-saraswathis.html

Accordingly, the above verse appears in the introduction to the 13th Chapter
of the Bhagavadgita in Madhusudana Saraswati's 'गूढार्थदीपिका’.

Om Tat Sat
