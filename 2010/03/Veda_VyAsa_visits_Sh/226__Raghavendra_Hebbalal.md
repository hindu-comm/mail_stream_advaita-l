Nitpick: The dialogue for the movie was "translated" by MM. vidvAn shrI ranganAtha-sharmANaH - vaiyAkaraNa-mUrdhanya and a staunch advaitin. 

shrI-bannanje "scrutinized" and "re-wrote" it. I am not sure what that means. 

An aside: IMHO, there is no better exponent of Samskrita-vyAkaraNa in all of Karnataka, if not South India, than shrI-sharmANaH. 

Regards,
-Raghavendra
