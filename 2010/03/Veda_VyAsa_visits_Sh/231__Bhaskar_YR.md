Nitpick: The dialogue for the movie was "translated" by MM. vidvAn shrI 
ranganAtha-sharmANaH - vaiyAkaraNa-mUrdhanya and a staunch advaitin.

I've not seen this movie..I dont know what exactly is the dialogue that 
saMbhAshaNakAra has put in the mouth of shankara & vruddha brAhmaNa rUpi 
veda vyAsa here.  But in mAdhaveeya,  dialogues between these two are very 
interesting & went on 8 days!!!...vyAsa asks shankara to clarify one of 
the sUtra-s in brahma sUtra (in 3rd adhyAya's first sUtra) shankara 
clarifies his position but vyAsa refuted his interpretation in hundred 
ways & in turn shankara counters vyAsa's arguments &  justifies his 
position in thousand ways :-))  and finally after seeing real form of 
vyAsa, shankara prays him and gets additional 16 years to his 
lifetime...Interestingly, if the dialogue writers opted for 
AnantAnandagireeya shankara charitra, then shankara would have instructed 
his 'shishya' padmapAda to do kapOla tAdana & kick the vruddha brahmaNa 
out of scene!!  shankara a humility personified, who is bhagavan shankara 
himself asking his shishya to man handle 'vruddha brAhmaNa' who is 'svayaM 
vishNu'  just because he was dragging the issue!!  How many kapOla kalpita 
(or poetic imaginations) episodes we can see in these biographies!!

Since the nitpicking issue has come year, I dared to share my 
thoughts...this is not to belittle the credence of any biographers.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
