शङ्करः शं करोतु

Namaste.

In the Sanskrit movie 'Shankaracharya' made by G.V.Iyer, there is a sequence
where Bhagavan Veda Vyasa visits Shankaracharya and a brief discussion on
the BrahmasUtra तदन्तरप्रतिपत्तौ रंहति संपरिष्वक्तः प्रश्ननिरुपणाभ्याम्
(3.1.1) ensues between them.  This can be viewed in the following URL:

The English translation of the entire Bhashyam of this sutra can be read

Quite interestingly, the dialogues for this entire movie have been written
by Dr. Bannanje Govindacharya, a well-known Madhva scholar. He was awarded
the Padma Bhushan recently.
