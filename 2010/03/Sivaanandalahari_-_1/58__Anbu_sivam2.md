Jaldharji,

That will be wonderful!  I did not provide the word for word meaning for
some slokas and I started including them only from the middle.  The
gentleman who would compile these slokas may contact me and I will provide
them so all slOkas have similar format.

I suppose it will be fitting if I write a upakrama and a upasamhara too.
These can also be included in the PDF file.

Aum Namasivaaya,
Anbu
