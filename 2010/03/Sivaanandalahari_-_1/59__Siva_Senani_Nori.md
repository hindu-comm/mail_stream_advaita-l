Time to pay one's dues.

I will do it, starting from the first week of April. I assume that the service required is that of a lekhaka (correcttransliterations)and not that of an editor (other issues like consistency in style, readability etc.).

Anbuji, please write the upakrama and upasamhAra. If you wish, I can take all posts from the list archives, or take some files from you after word to word meaning is incorporated.

Regards
Senani

Could someone volunteer to do this (and correct transliterations etc.) It 
would be a great asset for our web site.
