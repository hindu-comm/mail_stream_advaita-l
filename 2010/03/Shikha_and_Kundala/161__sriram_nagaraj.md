Dear List Members,

I am planning on keeping the traditional tuft (Shikha) this August when I visit India again. I would like to know if earrings (Kundala) can be worn by Brahmacharis or if it is reserved for Grihastas. As I know, Kacchham (5 yards dhoti) is to be worn by Grihastas and simple dhoti by Brahmacharis. 

Thank you

Namo Namaha Sri Guru Paadukaabhyaam
