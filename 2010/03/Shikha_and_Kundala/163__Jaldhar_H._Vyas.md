As per the pAraskara GrhyasUtra, chuDakaraNa saMskAra (piercing of the 
ears) should take place at 2 or 3 years or "yathA ma~ngalaM" which is 
interpreted as "according to the local/family tradition" which in our case 
means at the time of upanayana. Hopefully other list members will speak up 
if southern customs are different from this.

I have kept Shikha since I had upanayana but because I did not know any 
better and my father was rather irreligious in those days I never had the 
chuDakarana.  I intend to rectify this when my own son has upanayana in a 
couple of years.

This is another local custom.  We Gujaratis don't really make a 
distinction.
