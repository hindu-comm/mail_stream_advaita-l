Congratulations Sriram, for a great decision. I am sure, your
antarmukha-saadhana is also as brilliant.

In South India, the kachcham tradition you mentioned is correct.

About chUDaakaraNa: in our family tradition (Andhra Pradesh), it is
performed at any auspicious occasion before the child completes 3 years of
age; some times it happens even when the child is 6 months old. There is no
major difference between boys and girls for this. If it is not performed
within this age, it is done during upanayanam for boys.

In South India, again, brahmachaari-s and even grihastha-s don't wear
kunDala-s (ornate ear-rings with rudraaksha and/or precious stones.) They
wear simple ear rings. kunDala-s are usually worn by aahitaagni-s (people
who have performed Srouta-yaaga-s and are nitya-agnihOtri-s.) I am not sure
if there is a dharma-Saastra injunction for this. It could be simply for
affordability reasons.
