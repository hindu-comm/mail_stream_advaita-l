[Can you pl. tell me how the Chandogya quote is 'out of context'?  Is not
the context being discussed pertaining to the 'presence/absence of a mind to
a Jnani'?  It is the most appropriate quote that can be given to prove the
presence of a mind and other organs to a Jnani till death.  It is
unfortunate that you pooh pooh the explicit Shruti passages and the patently
jivanmukti-proving bhashyam of the Acharya.  If this is your attitude to
Bhagavatpada's bhashya that is clearly not favouring your line of thinking,
there is no point in continuing the discussion between us.]

[ No one has disputed that the jnani is really amanaska.  I have quoted the
Gita 5th chapter verses that say this most explicitly.]

[Just one sentence of Anandagiri's clarification is enough to explain the
purport of the entire set of the verses quoted from the kArikaa:   For 3.36
he says at the end:

अविद्यादशायामेव सर्वो व्यवहारः, विद्यादशायां च अविद्याया असत्त्वात् न कोऽपि
व्यवहारः ।  बाधितानुवृत्त्या तु व्यवहाराभाससिद्धिरित्यर्थः  ।

//All vyavarhAra is in the state of avidyaa alone, in the state of
realization, as avidyaa is no longer there, there is no vyavahara at all.
However, owing to the continuance of the 'samskaara vega', called
bAdhitAnuvRutti, there is a semblance of vyavahAra.//

And, this bAdhitAnuvRtti is admitted by Shankara in the SutrabhAshya:

What Shankara says in His commentary  on the Brahma sutra 4.1.15 is worth
quoting here: ‘’The knowledge of the Self being essentially non-active
destroys all works by sublating wrong knowledge; but wrong knowledge –
comparable to the appearance of a double moon – lasts for some time even
after it has been sublated, owing to the impression it has made.  Moreover,
it is not a matter for dispute at all whether the body of the Knower of
Brahman continues to exist for sometime or not. For how can one contest the
fact of another possessing the knowledge of Brahman – vouched for by his
heart’s conviction – and at the same time continuing with the body?’’]

[What all you have said above shows how offending you have been towards the
Bhashyakara.  The above Sutra bhashya quote has been completely disregarded
by you and resulted in the deriding comments you have made on the
Bhashyakara's words:
//comparable to the appearance of a double moon – lasts for some time even
after it has been sublated, owing to the impression it has made.//Your
'snake tail' is a caricature, an अपहास्य of the BhashyakAra's द्विचन्द्र
example.  It is left to you to seek the Acharya's kshamA for the gross
disregard you have shown to His upadesha on 'avidya lesha'.  ]

[All the above tirade of yours is simply brushed aside by the Acharya by His
one sentence giving the double-moon example.  Now you will have to eat your
words, seeking His excuse for your misconduct.]
