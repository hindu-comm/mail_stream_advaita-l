I would suggest that this entire debate can be resolved by carefully reading
the wording in the bhAshya.



Bhaskar quotes -

I want to draw attention to the phrase "ekasmin purushe" and the sentence
"tasmAn na vidyAyAM satyAm avidya-saMbhavo'sti", in particular the word
saMbhava. This means that there is no *fresh* arising of avidyA *in one
purusha* after the rise of vidyA. The locus being talked about here is *one
purusha*, i.e. the jnAnI. Please note that this does not say anything about
the remaining effects of the past state of avidyA for that *one purusha*.



The only objection to this would be that saMbhava should be translated not
as "arising" but as "possibility", i.e. there is no possibility of any more avidyA

after the rise of vidyA. This can be easily decided as below.



Subrahmanian quotes:

For those who can't see/read/understand the Sanskrit fonts above, I reproduce
one key sentence below in a transliterated form -


bAdhitam api tu mithyAjnAnaM dvicandra-jnAna-vat saMskAra-vaSAt kaMcitkAlam
anuvartata eva. 



Again the context of discussion is *one purusha*, the one in whom jnAnotpatti,
an arising of jnAna, has occurred. Note that it is Sankara bhagavatpAda himself
who says that the previous state of mithyAjnAna, although it has already been
sublated (bAdhitam api), it still leaves an impression (samskAra), which continues
to control (vaSa) the continued appearance (anuvartanaM) of that mithyAjnAna
for some time (kaMcit kAla).



For the purposes of this discussion, I would like to  keep away from translating
mithyAjnAna in the above sentence and debating whether or not it is avidyA. I
have no wish to get into bhAmati vs. vivaraNa or bhAmati vs. bhAshya or vivaraNa
vs. bhAshya at this juncture. I will leave that to those who find that debate to be
fruitful.


However, granting that Sankara bhagavatpAda's brahmasUtra bhAshya is entirely
self-consistent, we can clearly see that his statement on the continued effect of
saMskAra rules out the translation of avidya-saMbhava as "possibility of avidyA"
in the other quotation from the same text.


We also have to ask ourselves - where does this saMskAra abide and what does
it control? Obviously, this residual saMskAra does not abide in the Atman. Nor can
it abide merely in the physical body devoid of a mind. There HAS to be a mind for
the jnAnI in which this residual impression of prior mithyAjnAna stays for some time. 



In other words, in my view, the bhagavatpAda has clearly indicated to us the

correct state of things in this issue.



Regards,

Vidyasankar
