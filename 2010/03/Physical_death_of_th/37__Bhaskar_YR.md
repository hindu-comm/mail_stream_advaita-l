[All the above tirade of yours is simply brushed aside by the Acharya by 
His
one sentence giving the double-moon example.  Now you will have to eat 
your
words, seeking His excuse for your misconduct.]

praNAms Sri Subbu prabhuji
Hare Krishna

I know how emotionally you are attached to your pet theories in 
advaita...So, your personal attacks on me is not a surprise gift :-)) By 
the way, even after realizing one moon, seeing double moon does not mean 
it is due to  remnants of avidya...shankara clearly says vidyA & avidyA 
cannot have co-existence in a same person.  ekasmin purushe ete ekadaiva 
na saha saMbadhyEyAtAmityarthaH, yathA shuktikAyAM rajata shukti jnAne 
ekasya purushasya.....tasmAnna vidyAyAm satyAm avidyAsaMbhavOsti...this 
clear cut clarification from shankara is more than enough to blow away 
your avidyA lesha theory...

Anyway, I am sorry to say, by attributing avidya lesha to even mahA 
jnAni-s like shankara you are doing apahAsya to the ranks of those 
mahAjnAni-s...But I dont say the big words as you remarked on me 
prabhuji...Because, unlike me, you are a paripUrNa and pUrNAvadhi sAdhaka 
whereas I am an ordinary gruhastha who prefer saMsAra to vedAnta 
sAdhana...I treat your  personal attacks on me as 'AshirvachanaM'.

Humble praNAms onceagain.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
