Even after so much of clarification if you insist that 'continued vision 
of
double moon  for some time' is NOT avidyaa lesha, it only confirms that 
you
have not understood what avidyaa lesha is.

Thanks for your quote from Sri SSS & your linking of Kannada word 
'saMskAra vasha' to 'avidyA lesha'...Before leaving office I would like to 
make a comment that Sri SSS is dead against to this avidyA lesha theory, 
he has refuted this theory in his various works...So, your linking of 
avidyA lesha to saMskAra vash is totally uncalled & unjustifiable atleast 
from Sri SSS's perspective...Anyway, I'll not be there for the next three 
days in the office...We shall meet you on Monday with more details...till 
then...

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
