Namaste Srinivas ji,

How does one distinguish between these two:

50. There is space that is occupying the room (Mathakasha), and similarly
the aspect of Brahman that is occupying the universe is called the Self as
God (Shivatma).

51. There is space that is outside of the room (Mahakasha) and similarly,
there is that aspect of Brahman which is beyond the universal appearance
which is called the Self that is beyond (Paramatma).

One can understand that the jivatma is akin to the pot-space.  How is
ShivAtma, God, shown as something lower than the ParamAtman?

In the Panchadashi of Sri Vidyaranya, the Chapter 6, verses 18 onwards
presents a somewhat similar analogy.

It would be a good mananam exercise to elaborate on the Dasabodha verses in
the light of any commentary that could be there.

Regards,
