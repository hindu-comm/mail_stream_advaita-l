Namaste,

In dAsabodha 8.7.45-52, there is an interesting description
of four AtmA-s compared to four types of AkAsha.
see: http://www.sadguru.us/dbb010908.html

jivAtmA : brahmAMshawithin body (piNDa)
shivAtmA : brahmAMsha within this brahmANDa
paramAtmA : brahmAMsha outside this brahmANDa
nirmalAtmA : paresha (highest Ishvara) without any upAdhi

ghaTAkAsha : space (AkAsha) within a pot (ghaTa)
maThAkAsha : space within the room (maTha) containing the pot
mahadAkAsha : space outside the room
chidAkAsha : space without any upAdhi (qualification/ limitation)

jivAtmA is similar to ghaTAkAsha
shivAtmA is similar to maThAkAsha
paramAtmA is similar to mahadAkAsha
nirmalAtmA is similar to chidAkAsha

hari om.

Regards,
Shrinivas
