Namaste.

In this connection I would like to bring to the notice of those interested
the following:

// The Penguin Group has published a book titled, "The Hindus-An Alternative
History" by a professor of religions at Chicago University by name Wendy
Doniger. This book contains not only many factual errors in Indian history
but also misrepresents the beliefs, traditions and interpretations of a
whole people. //

I received an email fwd from a friend containing a request to sign a
petition to the Publishers to withdraw the book.  The selected portions from
the Book shown in the petition are enough to convince one of the ulterior
motive of the author. There is a lot of explicit and embedded vulgarity in
the author's statements. Even the revered Shankaracharya has not been
spared.  The cover picture of the Book is a close cousin of M F Hussain's
depiction of Hindu Goddesses.
