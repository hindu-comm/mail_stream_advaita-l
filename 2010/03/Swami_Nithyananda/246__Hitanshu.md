Hi,

This is was a nice and neutral article....

Though one thing that has always perplexed me...

Why do all these gurus, who have achieved all these siddhis fall into
this trap....

One of the biggest thing that a yogi is said to accomplish is strong
intuition, and a developed third eye, which means he can kindof look
into the future.... that is one of the biggest power all spiritual
gurus claim..

If that is so, why do they fall into such trap...

I am very curious to discuss this... any comments are most welcome.

Thanks
Hitanshu

In fact, many third parties were aware of the attack in advance and had warned his people before it happened with specific details of the plan. For instance, one of his top devotees got a phone call from someone based in New York describing the media and police attack that was to come. His predictions turned out to be accurate but at that time the ashramites did not take the threat literally. He said that for the right sum of money he could be helpful in preventing such an attack. He claimed that the planning for this attack had started a year ago. He mentioned that a budget of Rs 200 crores was allocated by some overseas groups to demolish Hindu gurus especially in south India, and named two south Indian churches as the nodal agencies to coordinate this strategic plan.
