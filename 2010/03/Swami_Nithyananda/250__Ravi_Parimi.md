Vidyasankar ji,

I totally agree with you. While the presence of an ashram and some
wealth around a guru cannot be ruled out these days, an excess of any
of these results in corruption. Long before these scandals about Swami
Nithyananda hit the media, I watched a few of his videos/interviews on
youtube. I was unable to find support for some of his statements in
shruti (or even by comparison with the life of Bhagavan Ramana
Maharshi)

 - Going into great details about the experience of self realization.
 - Holding a gathering to celebrate 10/20 years of obtaining self-realization !

A true teacher would never promote deha-abhimana and would urge
devotees (or students) to stick to the teaching and pursue their
sadhana. It is the fallacy of human mind to postpone learning shastra
to a future date since engaging in the service of the guru, thereby
gaining his good will seems to give it a sense of security. Failure to
contemplate on a guru's teachings and its relevance often misleads
people and they end up wasting several years on nothing.
So, it can be said that Isvara's grace is absolutely required in
finding the right guru. When a guru sticks to teaching only the
subject of Self knowledge, he is not bound of have thousands of
followers, neither is he bedecked in riches.

We don't gain anything by blaming the Swami or his organization for
their alleged (mis)deeds . This could just be a wake up call for all
the serious sadhakas to recognize the pitfalls that might confront
them during their sadhana and realize the importance of studying
shastra under an able teacher to make any progress in their quest for
the truth.
