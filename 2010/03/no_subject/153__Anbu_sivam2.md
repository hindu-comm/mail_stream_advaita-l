Dear Sri Krishnamoorthyji,

In prakrthi nothing can be concretely fixed because it will negate its ever
changing character.  Even though you are essentially right in your
contention on the question of free will which has support in Geetha vaakya
there are also sayings in the same Geetha exhorting Arjuna to do his
potential.  Such appeal would seem meaningless if there is a concrete
understanding of one's destiny.

A jeeva would not be a jeeva if he understands himself to be an automaton.
The example of Sri Rama as the perfect man who realizes his potential to
prove all purushaartha is possible in a dhaarmic world would not be
meaningful if he was to be understood as lacking free-will.  Without
free-will you might as well portray him with a magic wand in his hand.

Also a jeeva is a jeeva by the nature of his being a kinjignyan.  There can
be no jeeva devoid of the idea of free will unless he has become a jeevan
muktha.  We talked enough on the characteristics of jeevan muktha in this
forum and so a jeevan muktha is not part of the discussion in this thread.

In essence, the basic understanding that everything is destined, even though
is correct would not be acceptable to the jeeva.  That is how a jeeva has
been made.  This must also be realized.

Samsaara saagaram is quite tricky, isn't it!

With best regards,
Sri GurubyO Namaha
Anbu
