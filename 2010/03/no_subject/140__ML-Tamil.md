PranAm,

with high interest I followed the discussion on the qualities of the guru
between some of you. But what is about the qualities of the student? And one
more question. If there is no free will, how can the student take the
desicion to become a student of his own? Who takes the desicion to become a
student if there is no free will?

Thanking you and best greetings
Andreas
