Dear Andreas,

I am glad you have evinced interest.  You have asked: "But what is about the
qualities of the student?"

So what do you think?

You asked:
"If there is no free will, how can the student take the
desicion to become a student of his own? Who takes the desicion to become a
student if there is no free will?"

Good questions.  Do you mean to say there is no free will?
