Dear Andreas,
You are quite right The problem has been haunting many But our AchAryAs have already given logical and intellectually satisfying answers for it For example you can refer to the conversation on the problem by the Jeevanmukta Jagdguru Sri Chandrasekhara BhArati SwAmikal in the title 'Dialogues with the Master' available from Sringeri sarada Peethom.

The question of free will is one that I've pondered for a long time. I'm not new to Advaita but this is still a part of the teaching that I haven't resolved for myself.

PranAm Anbu Sivam,

please excuse my late answer. 

Sri Vidyasankar gave to me the answer about the qualities from the student. I am not sure if the student will have the qualities from the very beginning or if he has to earn some of them while studying. But before I go on to ask, I will look for the commentary of Shankara when I stay in India in July. 

At the moment I think there is free will, but some time ago there was a discussion on the free will by some members of this list. Their discussion confused me a little. Sri Vidyasankar is right, I am just a beginner of this philosophy and some parts I didn´t understand till now. So I placed the question before the learned members of this list. If there is free will, no explanation is needed. But when you give a negative answer to the free will, the question arise, who takes the decision to become a student. The same question arise to all aspects where  a decision has to be done. But I didn´t have an answer to this question. Who takes the decision to become a student, if not the student ( aham) himself?

Thanking you 
Andreas
