Dear Sri Vidyasankar, 



My apologies for not reading the word adraSTu as one of the possibilities quoted in one of your posts in the Indology list, where you copied a paragraph of sanskrit commentary. Another apology for failing to read adraSTu as non-seer or non-observer, because anyway Brahman is a non-seer, one who does not see anything else as other than itself. 



My contention is now reduced to tradition not taking the svarita seriously, which IMO is the only correct reading, otherwise there would be no yoga even an incremental variety. 



Best regards

Bhadraiah
