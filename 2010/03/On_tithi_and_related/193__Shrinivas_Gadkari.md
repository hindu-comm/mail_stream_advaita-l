Namaste,

It is very informative to read the detailed rules regarding deciding the 
tithi on any day. While we study these rules we should also keep
inquiring into : what is tithi and why is it significant? 

Here is some information based on my very basic understanding:
tithi isthe relative position of a particular instant/ or day within the 
lunar month (between two new moon positions).
Students of yoga are aware of classifiaction of breath into "solar"
and "lunar" breaths. Solar and lunar breaths follow a cyclic pattern 
during the course of the day. yogis who have dedicated themselves
to the study of these patterns have discovered that this pattern is
affected by the tithi. And this solar and lunar breath pattern in turn
affects our mind and thorughthe mindeverything else. Hence the
importance of tithi. This also is the starting point to systematically 
explore or even formulate the entire shAstra of astrology. hari om.

Regards,
Shrinivas
