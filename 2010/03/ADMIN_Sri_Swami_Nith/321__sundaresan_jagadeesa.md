Dear Ravi,

Namaste!

I highly appreciate and support the termination of the discussion thread on 'Swami Nityananda'. 



There is are 100's of URL links that sprout everyday on topics like Swami Nithyananda and my personal opinion is against encouraging such discussions.It is very important that we do not get swayed away by the media articles. We should apply our sense and value system and take an informed decision based on facts. Also, in future request the moderators not to allow postings on such topics both 'favoring' as well as 'against'. 


I feel each of us are capable and smart enough to have the trait that hamsa(swan) has i.e Neera-Ksheera Viveka. the ability of swan to extract milk from water when both are mixed and hence, absorb the good and reject the rest. 

Best regards,



Sundaresan
