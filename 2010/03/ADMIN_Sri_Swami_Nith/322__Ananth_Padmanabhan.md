Dear Administrators

Thank You all for stopping this 'unwanted diversion' from this site which is a great contributor to Advaitic knowledge share. It will be all the more good to nip such stray postings in bud before it gets into a vidhandaavaadham.

namaskaram

We should apply our sense and value system and take an informed decision based on facts. Also, in future request the moderators not to allow postings on such topics both 'favoring' as well as 'against'.
