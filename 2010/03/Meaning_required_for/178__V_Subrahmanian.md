Thank you Vidyashankar ji for the response.  I am able to get the three
types of arthavAda.  However, how do we get the full meaning of the verse,
with its anvaya, etc. What is the 'virodha' here that gives rise to the
first type: guNa vAda (I suppose this is what is also known as
'stutyarthavAda')?  What does 'tat hAnAt' mean in the third type?  Is this
shloka of the mImAmsaka-s?

Regards,
subrahmanian.v
