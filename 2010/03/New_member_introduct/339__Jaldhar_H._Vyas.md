praNAmaH,

I come from a smArta Rigvedic Telugu brAhmin family rooted in North Costal 
Andhra Pradesh. I am student of Vedas (primarily Rig Veda) and Vedanta. 
Consider myself fortunate to have met and been blessed by H.H. shrii 
bhArati-tIrtha-svaaminaH of daxiNAmnAya Sringeri maTh. I have studied some 
Vedanta texts by listening to lectures many Swami-jis and Vedanta 
Scholars, as well as by (slowly) reading the originals in my spare time. 
For sometime, I have been reading the archives and have benefitted a lot 
by them in my self-study. (My namaskaarams to all the scholars of the 
group for that.) My daily work involves research in Computer Science. I am 
currently based in Paris, France.

Namaste
