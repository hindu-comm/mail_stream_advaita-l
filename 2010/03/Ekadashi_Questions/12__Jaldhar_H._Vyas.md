On this topic it is worth considering the following aadeshapatra from 
Kanchi which is included in the Gujarati Janmabhumi Panchanga.

shrIkAlahastikShetram parAbhavasaMvatsare nIjashrAvaNabahuladashami


Our pujya parameshti guru 80 years previously during the year Ishvara[1] 
in the matter of panchangas for religious uses, decided based on the 
nirnayas of Pandits, so that the Deva and Pitr karyas of the Astikas might 
bear fruit, the following nirnaya:

In the matter of calculations for Jyotish, tithis etc. should be 
calculated based on the geocentric[2] method whereas eclipses etc. should 
be calculated according to the heliocentric[3] method. This was the view 
of Shri Venkateshvara Dikshit, Shri Sundareshvara Shrauti etc. The 
geocentric and heliocentric methods produce different results. All 
calculations should follow the geocentric method was the view of Shri 
Krshna Joshi etc. Shri Appu Shastri, Shri Appa Dikshit and Shri 
Shrinivasacharya were called upon to adjudicate and the view of Shri 
Venkateshvara Dikshita and Shri Sundereshvara Shrauti was decided to be 
the correct one. On this basis Acharyashri gave his Narayanasmrti[4] to a 
letter of instruction on Kartika amasa of the year Ishvara.

This same nirnaya is confirmed by us. We wish that the entire astika 
public should follow this nirnaya only in order to be blessed in this 
world and the next.  Because the difference between this method and the 
computed calculations is only plus 5 to minus 6 minutes [5] Thus these 
tithis promulgated by our parameshti guru conform to [the rule in] shloka 
"5 over and 6 under..."[6]

In the Vyasa Sadas held on nija Shravana 23-24[7] experts in Jyotish, 
Panchanga ganita Pandits and Pandits in Nyaya, Vedanta, and Dharmashastra 
from Gujarat, Karnataka, Maharashtra, Bengal, Orissa, Andhra and Dravida 
lands were gathered to discuss matters concerning Jyotish.  They decided 
to consider the matter of ayanamsha[8] and to select one method.[9] A 
great majority selected the Chitrapaksha ayanamsha and it is our wish that 
the respected publisher of the Janmabhumi Panchanga Pt. Amritlal Shah 
should continue this illustrious tradition and that the panchanga should 
be useful for the Astikas in carrying out their dharmic activities 
according to their own illustrious traditions.

Kalahasti, Nija Shravana bahula dvadashi in the year Parabhava.

NOTES:

[1] approx 1886? I believe this would be Swami Chandrashekharendra Saraswati 
the guru of the famous saint of the same name but I am not familiar with 
Kanchi history so additional info would be appreciated.

[2]  The traditional calculations based on suryasiddhanta and corrected in 
the grahalaghava etc. are made on the basis of an imaginary point at the 
center of the (spherical) earth similiar (and probably based on) the Ptolomeic 
system.

[3] Astronomical calculations (since Copernicus and Tycho in the West) are 
made assuming the Earth is moving around the Sun.  The upshot of the two 
methods is in the former the signs of the zodiac "move" relative to the 
vernal equinox over time whereas they are fixed in the latter.

[4] I.e. signature.

[5] This is why the "scientific" argument is bogus.  Although the system 
mentioned here is not strictly speaking astronomically accurate, it is good 
enough for Calendrical purposes.  If we were launching a rocket or something 
that would be a different matter.

[6] which shastra is this from?

[7] September 7-8, 1966

[8] i.e. the nirayana and sayana systems.

[9] There are several different methods of calculating ayanamsha.

My own panchang ganita code (which is on hiatus at the moment but which I 
intend to restart soon) is based on these principles.

Also on the subject of online panchangs, please take a look at 
http://www.mypanchang.com/ which also follows these principles and which I 
rely on for my dharmic duties.
