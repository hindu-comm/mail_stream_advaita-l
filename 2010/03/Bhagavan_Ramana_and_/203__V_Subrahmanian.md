Namaste.

If we closely observe what Bhaskar ji states,

 // bhagavan is 'telling' body is paining 'he is not telling' here I am fine
but 'my' body is
suffereing..//

one can easily see the paradox:  The Jnani is Brahman and Brahman does not
have body, mind, etc.  Yet 'Bhagavan is telling'.  How can this be?  Without
body, etc. how can Bhagavan tell anything?  How could he first of all have
heard Major Chadwik asking him 'Does Bhagavan suffer due to the pain?'.
For, when there is no body, mind, etc. Bhagavan could not have even heard
the question.  And without a mouth, vocal chords, etc, he could not have
replied that question too.  And without a mind, he could not have processed
the question, formed an answer and expected the questioner to listen to his
answer.  For, The Gita 13 chapter says: sarvendriya guNaabhAsam, sarvendriya
vivarjitam..  Brahman has no sense organs.

Is this whole conversation reported about Ramana an imagination of an
ajnAni?  If yes, then reading it is also avidyakRta and that we are
discussing this is also avidyaakRta.

One is reminded of an analogy provided by Shankara in the Mandukya Karika
bhashya: ...अर्धं पाकाय, अर्धं प्रसवाय’.  A man wants to cook a half of a
hen for food and retain the other half for it to lay eggs.  We do not want
to admit a BMI for a Jnani but want to know what a Jnani says about BMI.
