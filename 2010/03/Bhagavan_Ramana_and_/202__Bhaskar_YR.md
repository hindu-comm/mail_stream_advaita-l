// The great ones have demonstrated in their lives as to how one can
completely delink oneself from one"s own body and remain unaffected by its
changes or sufferings. *Ramana*"s body went through intense *pain*, caused
by sarcoma, for over fifteen months. Not one moment did he complain of it
though the *pain* must have been excruciating. When asked by Major 
Chadwick
whether he was suffering, *Ramana* said 'No". But at the same time, he 
said
'There is *pain*" â€“ the *pain* pertained to the body and not to him. Hence
His bewitching smile and divine splendour, even on the 14th April 1950 
when
he chose to give up his body which had been racked with intense *pain*.//

Yes, this clearly shows jnAni does not suffer due to the ailment of the 
body...It is we, the ignorants who are still identifying ramaNa as a jnAni 
with 6 feet tall body saying ramaNa is suffering...ramaNa as a jnAni, does 
not have the restricted boundaries of body to say it is 'my' body 
suffering...If you closely observe the above para, bhagavan is telling 
body is paining he is not telling here I am fine but 'my' body is 
suffereing...my body, my mind notions are ajnAna kruta, these notions 
cannot trouble the jnAni because he is brahmavida & brahman himself.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
