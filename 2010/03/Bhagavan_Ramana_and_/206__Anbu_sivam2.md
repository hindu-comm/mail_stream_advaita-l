Subramianji,

Namasthe.

BS Bhashya 1.1.4 is related to this.  You cannot talk ignoring this.

In Brahma Sootra Bhashya Sankara says:  "Tadetat asareerithvam mokshaakhyam"
(1.1.4).   The word 'Asareeri' only means being without a body. The loss of
awareness that  'I am the body' is Asareerithvam - the state of being
without a body.  The Acharya has defined Moksha thus: If desires are
gradually reduced eventually made extinct, attachment to the body will
totally disappear. The soul within will then shine forth. There is no need
to go to other worlds for this. This is what the Vedas and Vedanta refer to
as "Ihaiva-Ihaiva' - here itself.

Please forgive me if I say that you have too much emphasis on the vEsham
which is only mithya, unreal.

Please read my posting on Sri Rama's episode by Bhagavan Ramana.

Also Bhagavan Ramana says:

24. ईशाजीवयोर्वेशाधीभिदा |
     सत्स्वभावतो वस्तु केवलं ||

The impersonal and identified Consciousness are essentially the same. The
Sage has no ego or the thinking mind and is not attached to any form; the
man of ignorance feels that the ego and the form are real and is totally
asleep to the Self.
