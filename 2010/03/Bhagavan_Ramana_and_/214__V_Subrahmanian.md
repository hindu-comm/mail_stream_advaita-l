Namaskara.

Yes Sir.  I am, rather Sri Vidyaranya, in the Panchadashi that I quoted in
this thread is,  talking about a  "STITHAPRAGNYA" .  Going by the question
Arjuna asked, this Jnani, if he has practiced samadhi yoga, could be, at his
will in samadhi for a certain length of time.  He is, in the context we are
talking, an aparoksha Jnani.  The point the Panchadashi is making is that
this Jnani will interact with the world (when not in samadhi, if he is given
to it) or be in deep Atma vichAra, Atmaanusandhaana.

Regards,
vs
