Namaste Shri Subhanu ji,

I consider it a privilege to have a very learned person and a serious
sadhaka such as you give the time to address many issues in my article.  At
the outset I acknowledge with thanks the comments you have made.  You have
said it all in these lines of wisdom of yours:

// However, all this is only from the standpoint of an ignorant empirical
knower who attaches some reality to passing through different states, as his
wrong notions have not been eliminated through right knowledge. For, the
ultimate truth is that the Atman has been, is, and ever will be transcendent
above all notions of time, space and causation. This leaves no room for
ignorance to have any existence in reality whatsoever, as all is the
eternal, changeless immutable Brahman. I would encourage all aspirants,
paraphrasing Mundaka, to shoot straight at the target of realising their
true nature by living a life conducive to bringing about such knowledge, and
not be waylaid along the journey by the minutiae of various dialectic
arguments. //

Especially the sentence:

// This leaves no room for ignorance to have any existence in reality
whatsoever//

has been very well stated by ChitsukhaachArya thus:

// However, in practice, as a courtesy (upachArAt), it is spoken as

bhavarUpa, to distinguish it clearly from purely nonexistent entities such
as a hare's horn.

 भावावविलक्षणस्य अज्ञानस्य अभावविलक्षणत्वमात्रेण भावत्वोपचारात् //

Thus, when Advaitins say that avidyA is bhAvarUpa it should not be mistaken
that they assert it as a reality, equal to that of Brahman.  You have made
this point amply clear in your comments.

When you say:

// Vedanta teaches that knowledge alone reveals the Truth. Since
knowledge cannot remove an actual entity , it can only remove that which is
not real (ie false), therefore ignorance cannot really be a real entity,
even if we designate it to be so for the purpose of some teaching or other,
for knowledge can never remove an existing substance or material, only a
notion.//

it is well understood that in Advaita anything other than Brahman is only a
notion.  The positing of Avidya by Shankara through the words 'tAmasa
pratyaya' is definitely a mental mode, a notion.  All sadhana is directed at
knowing the Truth that can happen only when this notion is also attacked
simultaneously.  For only then, as Sureshwara says, the realization that
'avidyaa was not, is not, will not be' is possible.

Shankara says in the Brihadaranyaka Bhashya that 'vidyaa keeps waxing even
as avidyaa keeps waning' thereby showing that a 'thing' , a 'notion',
called avidya has to be constantly under attack.

This observation of yours is quite implicit in my article:

//Notions of cause etc can only be provisional //

Sir, with these opening remarks, I proceed to make a few observations in
between

your comments.  I shall reiterate that this short exchange is only of
academic interest and Advaita, as sAdhana, is not solely dependent of this.

For purposes of easy identification, I shall superscribe my comments with VS
and yours with 'Subhanu ji says'.

VS

[Yes Sir, that is very well stated by Sureshwara.  Shankara calls it
'tattva-agrahaNam', non-perception of the Tattva, Truth.  This is the one
that *results* in 'anyathA-grahaNam' or 'atasmin tad buddhiH' or otherwise
called adhyAsa by Shankara.  So, in Shankara's scheme it is tattva agrahaNam
that is the cause of anyathA grahaNam.  All these, are according to Him,
tAmasa pratyaya, commonly called avidya.  Tattva agrahaNam, anyathA grahaNam
and samshaya are only manifestations of this basic taamasa pratyaya called
avidya according to Shankara.  Surely, according to this definition of
Shankara, there is a cause preceding adhyAsa/anyathA grahaNam.  And that is
agrahaNam.  ]

[Shankara has demonstrated this in his Gita bhashya thru a dialogue in the

vishaya to the perceiver consciousness.]

VS
In the Gita bhAshya 13.2, in an interesting dialogue Shankara establishes
how avidya is experienced by someone:

Opponent: Since Avidya is the cause of all evil, it is a thing to be got rid
of.

Vedantin: He who has avidya will get rid of it.

Opponent: Why, it is I who have avidya, and I should try to get rid of it.

Vedantin: Then you know avidya and the Self, its possessor.

Opponent: I know, but not be immediate perception (pratyaksha)

[ so goes the dialogue]

VS:  A cause for adhyAsa has been posited by SSS as:

// AdhyAsa, of course, presupposes ignorance or want of true knowledge.
But this is a logical presupposition, a necessary implication of thought.//

VS

Despite all the above description, SSS admits of a cause that precedes this
bhrAnti, etc.  Surely this cause,  called by the name 'jnAnAbhaava' cannot
itself be a bhrAnti, etc.  It has to be clearly something other than
bhraanti, etc. as it is posited as that which 'causes' bhrAnti..//

VS:

This proposition assumes that the starting point is itself a
misunderstanding/confusion which in Shankara's terminology:
adhyAsa/anyathAgrahaNa/atasmin tad buddhiH/vipreeta grahaNa.  But such is
not the case according to Shankara.  It is tattva agrahaNa, the
non-comprehension of the truth that is the cause of anyathA grahaNa. The
bhashya to the Mandukya kArika 1.16 is clear about this. The word
'abodhataH' mentioned by you a little above with reference to the Vartika,
gets a clearer connotation in Shankara's words:

...उभयलक्षणेन *तत्त्वाप्रतिबोधरूपेण* वीजात्मना, अन्यथाग्रहणलक्षणेन च
अनादिकालप्रवृत्तेन मायालक्षणेन स्वप्नेन...
So, Shankara clearly shows a cause-effect relationship between
’तत्त्वाप्रतिबोद्य (अबोधः) and anyathaa grahaNa which alone is adhyAsa.  In
this bhashya of Shankara, the abodha is undisputably a condition that exists
in all states as long as there is samsara for the jiva.  It is this basic,
fundamental, ignorance that results in taking the truth to be something
else, anyathaa grahana.  This is what adhyasa is.

Subhanu ji says:

VS

Here again we could refer to the Mandukya Karika and bhashya 1.16 quoted by
me above.  Shankara very clearly speaks of the 'material root' clinging to
every state and ever present throughout a jiva's samsaaric existence.  That
entity is called : tattva apratibodhaH.  This is clearly differentiated from
anyathaa grahaNa.

VS:

Sir, I do not think that the sentence: “vivekaprakAsha-bhaave tadabhAvAt”,
meaning “when the light of discrimination comes it is seen that avidya is a
non-entity” goes against my explanation.  It is well known that when
knowledge arises there is no place for ignorance. I have never said that the
bhAvarUpa avidya is there to stay for ever. On the contrary, I have
explicitly stated that it is only a temporary bhAvarUpa status given to it.


(1) //tAmaso hi pratyayaH AvaraNaatmakatvAd-avidyA viparIta-graahakaH,
samshayopasthaapako vA, agrahaNAtmako vA//

Here  itself, in a subsequent sentence He says:

3 (2)// tAmase cha AavaraNaatmake timirAdi-doShe sati
agrahaNAderavidyA-trayasya upalabdheH.//

Note the word 'AavaraNaatmake' which clearly means, as an adjective of
tamas, and the example of timira dosha provided by Shankara, that the
condition prevailing is agrahana, anyathaa grahana and samshaya.  This is
the basic ground, the platform of avidya, the root, that provides the ground
for all manifestations of avidya to thrive.  Surely, in Shankara's scheme
this basic ground is not of the nature of adhyAsa.  It is something clearly
different from that.

VS

First, it should be noted that this 'orthodox view' is that of Shankara.  I
have quoted Shankara's Taittiriya Upanishad commentary where he specifically
criticizes the view that 'an existent thing could come from a non-existent
thing': अभावात् भावोत्पत्तिः..सर्वप्रमाणव्याकोपा .  If it is true that
Sureshvara has refuted this view, clearly he is refuting Shankara.
And worse, Sureshwara is contradicting himself.  For, he has said in the
Taittiriya Upanishad Bhashya Vartika: न ह्यभावाद्बवेद्भावो मानं यस्मान्न
विद्यते  (sIkShAvalli 19) [What is existent cannot, indeed, come out of what
is non-existent, as there is no evidence for that.]

The point that 'there is no entity called anAtman' prior to adhyAsa, is made
by SSS too and I have noted that point.  If adhyAsa or the world-illusion
should come out of nothing, it is definitely a defect that cannot be
overcome by SSS with his proposed position of 'jnAnAbhAva' as a condition
prevailing prior to adhyAsa.  His accepting this condition preceding adhyAsa
and at the same time averring that it is not bhAvarUpa is the glaring
contradiction that one cannot miss.  The Mandukya Karika too dispels this
proposition that something existing can originate from non-existence.

VS:

The above is a point that is contentious.  I do not think anyone would
propose that.  The Jivan Mukti Viveka of Vidyaranya speaks of 'those people
of the present times come to Vedanta without going thru the prerequisite of
adequate, intense upAsanA, to the extent of getting the vision of the
upAsya.  They apply themselves rigourously to Vedantic shravana, etc. and
gain the avidya-dispelling Jnanam too.  But, owing to their inadequate
preparation, there is bound to be a lack in their experiencing the
bliss/joy/ananda of Brahma jnanam.  Undoubdtedly, their Jnanam is secure; it
will not go away and result in their rebirth.  Yet, they will not be
experiencing the supreme peace, while alive, that is the ideal result of
gaining Knowledge.  For this, if they want, they will do well in engaging
themselves in whatever appropriate practices going by the name of manonAsha,
vAsanAkshaya etc.'.  This proposition, I think, is not opposed to
scripture.  It is quite reasonable.  It is not a compulsion on a Jnani to do
this.  It is purely optional.

VS:  The adherents of MUlAvidyA do not agree with this 'authority'.  For
them there is no such difference between Shankara's tradition and a school
upholding MulAvidya.  For them mUlAvidyA is admitted by Shankara and
Sureshwara.
