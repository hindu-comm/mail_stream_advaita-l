Much as I wish I had never entered into this thread in the first place,
let me just respond to your point above and then retire from it.



What better way to fight the "guru proliferation" as you call it (and
the secularism that you hold responsible for it) than to hold on to
the traditional concept of Guru? Why don't we all just gather the
courage to say, "this is our tradition, we will privilege it and preserve
it to the best of our ability"? Everything else will follow naturally.

Not that I necessarily agree with your views on fighting secularism,
but that is not a topic for this list. Suffice it to say that a traditional
individual can live without problems in a nation that is secular in its
governance. All that is needed is the courage of conviction regarding
his or her own tradition.


All this talk of traditional institutions and their leadership vis-a-vis
the so-called "pAmara jana" completely overlooks one point. Why
should it be the responsibility of an institution like a SAnkara maTha
to do exactly what the institutions of a proselytizing religion do?
What happened to the responsibility of every individual in society
who does not count himself or herself as part of this "pAmara jana"?


Regards,

Vidyasankar
