As Shri Subrahmanian aptly highlighted, the Acharya's compositions in Bhakti Sudha Tarangini are filled with intense devotion. In particular the Kamalaja Dayithashtakam and Guru Paduka Stotram are chanted in many religious organisations till date and I have seen his LakshmiNarasimha stotram being included even in Vaishnavite stotra books.

The Acharya's Slokas in revered memory of Sri Sadashiva Brahmendra and his experiences at the Nerur Samadhi of Sri Sadhasiva Brahmendra kindle fervour in the minds of true seekers.

I was very happy to know that Tattvaloka has recently published a new edition of not only the original Bhakti Sudha Tarangini of Sri Satchidananda Sivabhinava Nrisimha Bharati Maha Swamigal but also Guru Raja Sukti Mala containing certain compositions of the great Jeevan Mukta Sri Chandrasekhara Bharati Maha Swamigal.

The book also comes with Tamil translation of all the slokas for the benefit of reader.
