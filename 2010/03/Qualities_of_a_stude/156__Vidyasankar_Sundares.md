I think the period at the end of the sentence is getting incorporated into the URL
when you just click from the message. Please try the following



http://www.advaita-vedanta.org/articles/The_Riddle_of_Fate_and_Free.htm



or you can also just go to http://www.advaita-vedanta.org , click on the link there
that says Articles and go to this particular article from that page.



Regards,

Vidyasankar
