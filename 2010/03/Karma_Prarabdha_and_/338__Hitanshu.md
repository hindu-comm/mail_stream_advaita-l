Dear Mr Senani,

Thanks for helping me get more insight into puNya and pApa.
Would be great if you can also throw some light on the 3rd question.... and
help me understand the relationship b/w karma, karmfal, and freewill.... how
much is the role of freewill in determining destiny, given that the events
that we come across are because of our previous karma..?

Thanks
Hitanshu
