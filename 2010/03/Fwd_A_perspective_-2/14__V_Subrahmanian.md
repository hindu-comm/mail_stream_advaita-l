Dear Anbu ji,

This 'shaapa vimochanam' by Bhagavan abounds in the Puranic and Itahasa
lore.  Take for instance young Krishna passing thru the two trees with the
grinding stone tied to His waist.  The two brothers Manigreeva and
NalakUbara emerged from the felled trees.  They were the sons of Kubera and
had got this tree form due to a curse.  They were not Jnanis before and
after. There is another instance of a lizard turning out to be a gandharva,
being freed from the shaapa.  Even this gandharva was not a Jnani.

In Advaita,  Jnanam is complete disidentification from the AnAtma.  If a
Jnani is cursed by some Deva/Rishi and starts identifiying with a stone,
then the very definition of Jnanam is questionable. Even granting that
Ahalya was a Jnani and experienced the effects of the curse, the story does
not obviate the need for the instrumentality of the mind, even in the case
of  a Jnani.  For, only with a mind can one identify and disidentify.
JaaDyam is also a mode of the (taamasic) mind alone. Atman is beyond the
guNa-s. My persistence is on this one aspect.

By the way, here is the story, 'as told by Bhagavan' from literature related
to Bhagavan Ramana where this Ahalya episode is discussed:

http://www.messagefrommasters.com/ramana_stories/ramana_maharshi_gautama_ahalya_32.htm

// Devotee: “The statement that Ahalya turned into a stone
applies only to her mind and not to her body. Is that not so?”

Bhagavan: “That is so. If it is not for the mind, could it be for the body?
It is only ordinary people that say her body turned into a stone and that
Rama restored her to her original form by putting his foot on the stone. How
is that possible? It only means that the mind lost its awareness of the
Self, and unable to think of anything else, she became dull like a stone.

That dullness got relieved by the darsan of a great personage.
As she herself was a great tapasvini she could immediately become aware of
the Self. //


Warm regards,
