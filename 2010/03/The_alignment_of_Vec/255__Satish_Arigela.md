By the way...This caught my attention..and I had a good laugh on this one.
Pretty hilarious! :)

The exact statement and the context follow:

**This attraction of the lay Hindu masses
 towards nara-pUjA is a major problem for the pretAcharin-s because 
they are busy trying to peddle their own nara, whose shava hangs


from a shUla. But then a charismatic living nara is any day more potent


 for the masses than one who dangled on a shUla two thousand years ago.**

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Now, the concerted attacks against the Hindu sAdhus, AchArya-s and 
“god-men”,
 like the one that was recently seen, are something where this

alignment of vectors is very apparent. Now for an educated, textually 
and/or
 ritually inclined and educated Hindu most of these “global 
guru-s” 
are not very important because they have their own “local 
teachers” 
who educate them in the shruti, kalpa, Agama, dharma, darshana
 and 
sAhitya. Yet, the social significance of the “global guru-s” cannot

be understated when we come to the Hindu masses and the confused modern

 Hindus. Some of them are members or offshoots of different medieval 
sampradAya-s
 of the bhakti-mArga (e.g. the gauDIya-s), other upholders 
of the 
traditions of the shAstra-s (e.g. the sha~NkarAcharya-s), still 
others
 yogin-s of all hues, and yet others pAShaNDa-s encouraging 
differing
 degrees of nara-stuti and neomorphic traditions without proper

understanding. Now this element of nara-stuti is a continuation of an 
old
 strain in Hindu tradition that was first effectively used by the 
tathAgata
 to present himself as the R^iShi of the true shruti and also 
as one
 who is “above” the devatA-s. This attraction of the lay Hindu 
masses
 towards nara-pUjA is a major problem for the pretAcharin-s 
because 
they are busy trying to peddle their own nara, whose shava hangs

from a shUla. But then a charismatic living nara is any day more potent

 for the masses than one who dangled on a shUla two thousand years ago. 
So
 the followers of the preta-mata try their best to bring down the 
various
 pujya nara-s operating in bhAratavarSha or in mlechCha desha 
itself.
