 Mahavaakya is the teaching not the teacher. I must say that the above
suspicion is not correct. Teacher teaches the teaching. Shraddhaa has been
noted in the previous post from Shankara as - shastrasya guruvaakyasa
satyabudhyaavadhaaranaa saa shraddhaa' - shraddhaa is shastra as interpreted
by aachaarya is indeed correct -Please refer to the previous post as this
was discussed before eloberately taking Krishna's teaching 4-40.
Hari Om!
