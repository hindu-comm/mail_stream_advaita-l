Just a minor historical correction in this account:


> As per the tradition of Sringeri Mutt he undertook tours to various parts of the country preaching moral and spiritual values of this >ancient land. On such an occasion, he visited Talacauvery in Kodagu and worshipped the goddess Cauvery with gold coins. He >went to Travancore in Kerala and stayed with king Setupathi. The king brought to Swamiji's notice that during Dasara one >thousand animals are being sacrificed to the goddess Rajarajeswari and he had failed to stop this obnoxious practice. Swamiji >called the leaders of the city and explained to them that goddess cannot be propitiated by killing animals and in fact it is a sinful 



This was in Rameswaram, not Travancore, during the rule of either Muthuramalinga
Setupati or Bhaskara Setupati (I forget which king exactly).



Incidentally, Bhaskara Setupati was also the royal patron who financed and arranged
for Swami Vivekananda to attend and speak at what has now become the famous
session of the parliament of world religions in the United States.



Regards,

Vidyasankar
