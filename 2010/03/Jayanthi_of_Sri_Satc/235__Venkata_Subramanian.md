It was in Ramanathapuram; which is about 2 1/2hours Journey from Rameshwaram, that this correction by the Jagadguru happened. It was Bhaskara Sethupathi. The place where the Swamigal stayed during Chaturmasyam, was called Shankara Vilas. Now that place has been handed over to Sri Ramakrishna Math. It was at this place Swami Vivekananda too stayed when he was at Ramanathapuram.

Thanks & Regards,
Venkat.

Sadgurubhyo Namah.

Just a minor historical correction in this account:

On such an occasion, he visited Talacauvery in Kodagu and worshipped the goddess Cauvery with gold coins. He >went to Travancore in Kerala and stayed with king Setupathi.

This was in Rameswaram, not Travancore, during the rule of either Muthuramalinga
Setupati or Bhaskara Setupati (I forget which king exactly).



Incidentally, Bhaskara Setupati was also the royal patron who financed and arranged
for Swami Vivekananda to attend and speak at what has now become the famous
session of the parliament of world religions in the United States.

Vidyasankar
