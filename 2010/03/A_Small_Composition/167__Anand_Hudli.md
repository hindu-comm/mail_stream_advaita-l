The sentiment expressed in the verse is praiseworthy. Not to nitpick, but in the following

 line:



Praarabdha Sagaram Mathayaami Panchaksharena Sadaa



a correct form of the root math for the uttama puruSha-ekavachana should be 

manthAmi (मन्थामि) or manthe (मन्थे), if using Atmanepada.  The past passive participle form is mathita (मथित) or mathitA (feminine). 



Or, if you want the causative form, the word is manthayAmi (मन्थयामि), which means 

"I cause to be churned ..." 



Anand
