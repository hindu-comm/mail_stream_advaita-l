The dhAtupATha has manth viloDane in both the first (bhVAdi) and ninth (kryAdi) 

gaNas. mathnAmi is an acceptable usage. So is mathAmi. The mAdhavIya dhAtuVR^itti, 

for example, lists manthayati as a causative form.  The BrihaddhAturUpAvali by 

T R Krishnacharya, available at the Digital Library of India, also lists manthayate. 



The form mathayAmi may be suspect. Please see below.

The general rule for forming causative verb stems is to use what grammar books call

the "gunated" form and add "aya", if the root ends in a consonant. If the root ends

in a vowel, then the root is "vriddhied" and "aya" is added to form the stem. There are

exceptions. I mention a few. The root gam (to go) does not follow the "gunated" form.

So we have gamayati, etc. Roots such as ranj, and manth too, do not use the 

"gunated" form. We have ranjayati and manthayati.



For example, to get the causal stem for the root budh, one first 

gets the "gunated" form bodh. Then aya is added before all terminations, giving 

bodhayati, etc. This rule may have been followed to derive the stem mAthaya in the

mahAbhArata case, suggesting the formation gunated math (mAth) + aya. The 

termination mAthayati
