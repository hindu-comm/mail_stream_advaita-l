[ The word 'aavirbhavati' could be a better one for 'aarohati'.  The former
means: It surfaces, comes up, etc.  aarohati could simply mean: climbs,
ascends, etc.]

[What is 'samyuktoham'?  Is it meant to convey the idea: ...I remain, rest,
composed?  Some suggestions: kRtArthoham, shAntoham, shiva eva aham, etc.]
