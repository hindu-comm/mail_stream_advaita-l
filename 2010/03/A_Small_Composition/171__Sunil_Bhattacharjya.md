Dear Vidyasankarji,

To my understanding, the epic Mahabharata was composed three decades after the Mahabharata war and the latter was fought in 3139 BCE. Thus Mahabharata precedes Panini by more than one and a half millennium. Is that to be considered while discussing the language of the Mahabharata?

Regards,

Sunil K. Bhattacharjya

Yes, that explains it. I had overlooked that the general rule is to use guNa/vRddhi when
forming the causative.



Thanks,
