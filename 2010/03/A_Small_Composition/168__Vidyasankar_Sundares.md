A little grammar excursus:

Isn't verb root math is primarily conjugated as per the 9th group, so
as to give mathnAmi for uttama purusha ekavacana? Usually, the root
manth is described as a stronger form of root math, but I have seen
1st group like conjugation with math itself (mathati etc). In that case,
mathayAmi should technically be allowable for causative, although I
admit it looks a little strange. manthayAmi would of course seem to be
the most acceptable usage.



I notice that the Monier Williams dictionary says the form mAthayati
is found in the mahAbhArata, which also seems a bit strange. Why the
dIrgha in the first vowel?
