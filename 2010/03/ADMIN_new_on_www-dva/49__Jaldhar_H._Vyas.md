Unfortunately instead of taking part in the discussions, lately I've been 
occupying my time with cleaning up the server which ran out of disk space 
a few weeks back.  All has been rectified now and we should have more 
capacity to comfortably handle this lists growth for some time to come.

I have added an article by Shri V. Subrahmanian "Presentation of the the 
teaching of mithyatva in the Bhagavadgita." It examines this important 
topic in the light of Shankaracharyas bhashya on Gita 2.16.

word format.)

Thanks to Shri Ajit Krishnan (and I would also like to thank Shri Murali 
Karamachedu for his offer to help) we have the classic Nirnaya Sagara 
edition of the Bhagavadgita with 7 sanskrit commentaries in the texts 
section.
