similarly some part of the TaittirIya SAkha of yajurveda begins after the 
varuNa-bhrigu samvaada.

praNAms
Hare Krishna

Likewise, in atharvaNeeya shruti  prashna or  muNdaka (not sure) at the 
end there is a big list of brahma jnAni-s.  If these jnAni-s are real life 
characters then we have to say that either after seeing these rishi 
paraMpara in real life time  mundaka/prashna has been  composed or to 
maintain aparusheya status, we can say shruti predicted these future 
brahma jnAni-s well in advance...If the former is true then we have to fix 
the date and time for the composition of this shruti and this will go 
against our traditional belief that veda-s are apaurusheya  or if the 
later is true then why shruti did not predict & include the likes of 
shankarAdi advaita parampara AchArya-s??!!  Quite puzzling for an 
inquisitive mind is it not??

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
