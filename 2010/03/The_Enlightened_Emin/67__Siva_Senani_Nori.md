Dear Sri Subrahmanian Mahodaya

I understand your feelings,but cannot agree with all that you said. I omit the reasons for my disagreement as it would only prolong the thread, to no benefit.

The end point of this argument about j~naanis and BMI is perfectly agreable to me; so in the journey to this common point, one pieceof the road would not be common to our routes. So be it.

Best regards and many thanks for your scholarly posts
Senani


Dear Sir,

I am at a loss to understand how and why the idea of a personality of the Shruti-based persons could be linked to apauruSheyatva or a beginning date for the Shruti.....
