Dear Sri Moharir,



May I suggest that you post in more detail about these? Samartha Ramadasa's writings
are not widely accessible, especially to people who do not know Marathi, so the whole
list would benefit if you could translate and write more about these chapters from the
dAsabodha.



Regards,

Vidyasankar
