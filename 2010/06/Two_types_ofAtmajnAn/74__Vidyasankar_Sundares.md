Not so. The mere arising of a mental state does not mean that s/he would
give in to them. IF he engages in attachment to sense objects, then there
is nASa. Such a person does not have samyag-jnAna. However, for a jnAnI,
even if a momentary mental state arises, s/he knows better and s/he does not
develop attachment to it. That is the biggest difference. You fail to distinguish
between the fact that different citta-vRtti-s may arise and the fact that
the jnAnI knows how to withdraw from these vRtti-s. This is because you 

fail to see where yogAbhyAsa fits into the life of a jnAnI, before and after 
jnAna-prApti, although sureSvarAcArya explicitly puts it as necessary after
the renunciation of all action and although Sankara bhagavatpAda explicitly
says "svAtantrya-arthaM yogadharma-anusevanaM". 



Enough said. You keep raising strawman arguments about what the jnAnI
is and does. I don't think you are really sorry to be fussy, because you seem
to delight in ascribing positions to others that they don't hold and you seem
to want to deliberately misunderstand what is being said. Please get back to
the basic questions that I raised a few days ago and then I will discuss more.



Best regards,

Vidyasankar
