Namaste Shri Satish,

bANa has been called an asura.
rAvaNa was an asura.
Both were devoted to bhagavAna rudra.

Both shrI kRSNa and shrI rAma stood for upholding sattva
and dharma, both were also devoted to bhagavAna rudra.

That aspect of rudra that supported bANa and rAvaNa lost
before that aspect of rudra that supported sattva and
dharma.

Today we are again witnessing a battle between sattva/ dharma
and asura-s.

That aspect of bhagavAna rudra that is supporting terrorists, 
naxalities, ... at times seems to be strong. We need to pray
that this aspect of rudra loose in front of that other aspect of rudra 
that supports sattva and dharma.

Note: ahamkAra tattva of every manifested being is ruled by the 
devatA rudra - including terrorists, naxalites, corrupt politicians ...

hari om,
regards,
Shrinivas

This is to clarify that the reason for responding to the article is not to show that shiva jvara won or that somehow shiva is greater than viShNu. 
I intended to only show that these so called mystical interpretations (or some call advaitic interpretation) by neo-vedantins do not make any sense if observed closely. 
Regards
