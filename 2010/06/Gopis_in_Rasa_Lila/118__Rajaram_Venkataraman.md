There are four classes of gopis:


   1. The Lord himself (e.g. Srimati Radharani)
   2. Personal associates of the Lord who descend from brahmaloka planets
   (e.g. vaikuntha, goloka)
   3. Devotees of the Lord who come from Devvaloka, Tapaloka etc.
   4. Pure devotees of the Lord from bhuloka

For the Lord, there is no going or coming as she is advaya jnanam only.

For the personal associates, there is no trace of rajas or tamas and they
can be present with Krishna while also being present with their husbands.

For the devotees from the devaloka, it is possible to travel with subtle
bodies  which is more real than their gross body which they assume only to
roam around on earth.

For pure devotees from bhuloka, they go with their gross body against social
conventions out of intensity of devotion. Some of them experience the
intensity in the form of separation from the Lord.
