As every one knows samhitas and upanishads have statements where the devotee
declares he is one with the lord - so'ham, gopalaham, sivo'ham etc. Why in
Bhagavad Gita, Arjuna does not state that? It cannot be because Arjuna does
not understand it. In 18.72, the lord asks if Arjuna's moha is gone and
Arjuna says yes, your prasada. Sankara comments that Arjuna has acquired
knowledge of the Self. But Arjuna does not say Vasudevo'ham. He, in fact,
says "karishye vacanam tava".  Why?
