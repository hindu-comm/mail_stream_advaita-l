It is clear that Arjuna could understand intellectually only That is why lord
has to explain the principles again to Arjuna in Annuitant life of Arjuna 
after the war also proves this In fact Bhagwan Vyasa has portrayed only one
as a jnani,a realized soul,ie.Vidura who becomes an avadhuta at the end of
of his life he was the dearest one to the Lord for it was only in  his
home the Lord preferred to stay when the Lord acted as a messenger.
