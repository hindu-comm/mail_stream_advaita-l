Yes, agreed.

Again, agreed. But isn't it only through these upalakshaNa-s that one can leave
the anAdy adhyAropa of anAtman and be absorbed in Atma-svarUpa? The way
out of the upalakshaNa is through it, is it not?

As long as there is a body, hunger and sleep and dreams arise. As long as there is
a mind, various mental states arise. On the other hand, for a jnAnI, the mere arising
of a mental state does not mean that there is indulgence or repulsion towards that
mental state. This applies as much to negative states such as kAma and krodha as
to any other mental state, however positive it may be.

Regards,
Vidyasankar
