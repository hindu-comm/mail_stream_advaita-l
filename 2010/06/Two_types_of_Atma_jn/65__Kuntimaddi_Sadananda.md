Pranipataji - PraNAms

Do the statement contradict what my understanding is, if so how?
Jnaanam involves understanding that one is always  guNa attiita, as
described in Ch.14 of Giita. The abidance in that jnaanam, requires
Nidhidhyaasana, since habbits due to hard. Hence shrotavyaH, mantavyaH
and nidhidhidyaasitavya. Nidhidhyaasana is not a pramaaNa or means of
knowledge. It is a process wherein one firmly gets established in the
knowledge that one has already gained. If he has already gained then
he is a jnaani. But for jnaana niShTa one has to abide in the
knowledge. In the language of swami paramarthananda it is called
internalization of the knowledge.

Hari Om!
