Pranipataji - PraNAms

The definition of jnaana niShTaa with Sthita prajnaa with sthita the
same meaning as niShTa - I have no problem.

Yes for me jnaani is the one who has clear understanding that I am
saakshii swaruupam through shravana and manana. He may not need
nidhidhyaasana if he abides in that knowledge as the first student of
Kena does after hearing from the teacher. He can still operate the BMI
that belongs to lower prakRiti without the kartRitva or bhokRitva
bhaava. Nidhidhyaasana is required only due to habits of the past due
to praarabda to keep that jnaana that he has already gained to bring
in to his awareness to shift his identity with the reality that he is
and not with the anaatma that he witnesses.

Does jnaani have mind? Does jnaani have ahankaara?, etc that are being
asked repeatedly - the answer obviously depends on from what reference
these statements are made. pasyan, shrunvan etc sloka clearly
indicates that BMI functions whether it is jnaani or ajnaani but
jnaani understands the demarcation while ajnaani thinks he is the
doer. During the nidhidhyaasana one has to ascertain the jnaanam that
one has already gained and to abide in it without getting carried away
with BMI. Since there is no new knowledge to take place other than
ascertaining his own nature that one understood, we have these
apparent gradations in jnaani.

If one understands where the problem lies in terms of the demarcations
in abidance of jnaanam vs demarcation in jnaanam itself, then the
discussion served its purpose.
