Hari Om Shri Sadanandaji, Pranaams!

During jnAna-abhyAsa(shravaNa,manana,nididhyAsana) period one is a 
saMkhyaH(jnAna-yoga-niShThaH). When his abidance is steady he is fit to be 
called a sthita-prajnaH or jIvanmuktaH.  This is my understanding.

You prefer to call him jnAni during the jnAna-abhyAsa period also in 
accordance with Lord calling the one striving for siddhi as siddhaH in BG 
7.3.

In Shri Guru Smriti,
Br. Pranipata Chaitanya
