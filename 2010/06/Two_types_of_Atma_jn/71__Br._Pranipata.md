Hari Om Shri Vidyasankarji, Pranaams!

The sAkShitA(witnesshood) of Atman is not a svarUpa-lakShaNa of Atman but 
only upalakShaNa.

To be absorbed in Atma-svarUpa uninterruptedly one has to leave the 
upalakShaNa which is not ever present in Atman.

Whether BG triplet starting dhyAyato viShayAn ... occuring in 
sthitaprajna-lakShaNa portion, or in bhikShu-gIta portion of 
srimadbhagavatam, refrain and tolerance are the golden rule and never 
indulgence(intolerance and repulsion) with sAkShibhAva.

In Shri Guru Smriti,
Br. Pranipata Chaitanya
