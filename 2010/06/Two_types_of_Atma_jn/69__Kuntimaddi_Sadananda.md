Pranipataji - PraNAms.

For me it is straight forward. ajnaani is the one who does  not have
jnaanam that they are just properties of indriyaas - He superimposes
those properties on himself as I am the seer, doer etc. kartRitva and
bhokRitva bhavaas are there in him and therefore he is accountable for
the superimposed notions of the actor.

a  jnaani has jnaanam that they belong to prakRiti - as Krishna says -
prakRityaiva ca karmaani kriyamaanaani sarvashaH .. yes pasyati tat
aatmaanam akartharam sa pasyati . With jnaanam all the sanchita and
aagaami karmas are destroyed. The praarabda still remains - which is
the cause for the BMI.

As long as BMI is there the lower prakRiti is manifesting and all the
emotions due to past habits will go on - may be at reduced level
trained during the saadhana level - that is what Krishna answered in
response to the behavior of the gunaatiita in Ch. 14. As I see,
self-consistency in the analysis - Anyway that is my understanding and
I leave it others to discuss further.

Hari Om!
