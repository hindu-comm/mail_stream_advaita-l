Dear List Members,

Several years ago (not sure of the specifc issue or year), there was an article 
in Tattvaloka that traced a detailed symbolism in the Krishna-Banasura 
encounter, from an advaitic standpoint. The writer brought out several points 
and explained the significance of the maheSvara-jvara and vaishNava-jvara, the 
symbolism behind lopping off 998 arms, of Usha and Aniruddha themselves etc. I 
request anyone on the list who has access to the article I am referring to, or 
who knows the details of this interpretation, to please post it on the forum.

Thanks in advance,
Murali Manohar
