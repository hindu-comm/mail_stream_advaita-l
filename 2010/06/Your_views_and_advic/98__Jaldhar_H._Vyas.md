Our philosophy teaches that the body is a mirror of the outside world and 
vice versa.  If you have problems in concentration in all aspects of life, 
it could be because your environment is affecting you adversely.  For 
example I used to go to sleep late and wake up early in the morning.  The 
resulting lack of sleep made me forgetful and unable to concentrate. 
When I started going to bed earlier these problems vanished without the 
need for medecines etc.  As Satish wrote, yoga might be of help as it is 
about control of mind, body, and senses.  But only someone who knows you 
and your situation personally can properly guide you in such matters.
