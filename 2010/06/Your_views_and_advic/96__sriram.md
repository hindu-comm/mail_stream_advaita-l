Dear Sri Magesh
To have focus on the Japa you can get the meanings of the manthras and 
recite them aloud so that ears will also get engaged.And you can visualise a 
big temple where you had gone in your mind`s eye and recite the Gayathri 
Manthra before each sannadhi of a deity so that mind will be vigilant and 
manthra will be uttered consciously.I do this daily and change the temples 
also just to keep the mind alert.By this process   memory also will be fresh 
when you make a  repeat visit to the temple..R.Krishnamoorthy
