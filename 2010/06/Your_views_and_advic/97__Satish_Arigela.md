IMHO practice of haTha yoga can help a lot. Especially some of the kriya-s like trATaka and mudra-s like the shaNmukhI. They are best learnt from a professional yoga teacher.
They could guide one systematically before going directly for these mudra-s and kriya-s.

Dear Sri Magesh
To have focus on the Japa you can get the meanings of the manthras and recite them aloud so that ears will also get engaged.And you can visualise a big temple where you had gone in your mind`s eye and recite the Gayathri Manthra before each sannadhi of a deity so that mind will be vigilant and manthra will be uttered consciously.I do this daily and change the temples also just to keep the mind alert.By this processmemory also will be fresh when you make a repeat visit to the temple..R.Krishnamoorthy
