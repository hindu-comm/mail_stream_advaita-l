Namaste Sunil ji:

Here are some portions from the Bhagavatam:

(4) Hearing that song aroused Cupid with the women of Vraja and with their
minds seized by Krishna went each of them unknown to the others, with
earrings swinging in the haste, to where He, their boyfriend, was. (5) Some
left in the middle of milking the cows, some abandoned in their eagerness
the milk they had on the stove while others went without taking the cake out
of the oven. (6-7) Some put aside the children they were feeding milk and
dressed up forgetting the service to their husbands, some left in the middle
of having their dinner, some oiled, painted themselves and made up their
eyes while others went near Krishna with their clothes and ornaments in
disarray. (8) They, checked by their husbands, fathers, brothers and other
relatives did, enchanted by Govinda with their hearts stolen, not turn back
[to their duties]. (9) Some gopîs who didn't manage to get away, staying
home closed their eyes and meditated connected in that love [see footnote*
and 10.1: 62 &63]. (10-11)


(17) When the Supreme Lord saw the girls of Vraja arriving near Him spoke
He, the best of all speakers, with a wealth of words that bewildered them.
(18) The Supreme Lord said: 'Be welcome all of you, o fortunate ladies, what
can I do to please you? Please tell Me whether Vraja is all right and for
what reason you came here. (19) This night is full of creatures fearsome in
appearance, so please return to Vraja o slender girls, you women shouldn't
hang around here. (20) Surely do your mothers, fathers, sons, brothers and
husbands looking for you not see you; don't cause anxiety for your kin.
(21-22) You've seen Râka (the goddess of the day of the full moon)
resplendent by her moonlight, you've seen the forest full of flowers even
more pleasurable by the breeze blowing from the Yamunâ that plays through
the leaves of the trees. Go now, without delay, back to the cowherd village,
you must serve your husbands, o chaste ones, the calves and the children are
crying for you to give them milk. (23) Or else, if you have come with your
hearts overtaken by your love for Me, is that indeed laudable of you as all
living beings have affection for Me. (24) For woman it indeed is the highest
dharma to be diligently of service to her husband, to be simple and honest
towards the relatives and to take good care of her family. (25) Provided he
didn't fall [from his belief or being unfaithful] should a husband
bad-hearted, unfortunate, old, retarded, sickly and poor even by women who
desire heaven not be rejected [see also 9.14: 37 and B.G. 1.40]. (26) To be
astray weak in adultery is for a woman of class in all cases something
contemptible: it harms the reputation, creates fear, and gives trouble. (27)
By listening, being in the presence [of the deity and the devotees], by
meditation and by subsequent chanting is one of love for Me; not so much
with physical proximity, therefore please return to your homes [see also
10.23: 33].'

(38) Even the cowherds of Vraja, who bewildered by the power of His mâyâ all
thought that their wives stood at their side, were not jealous with Krishna.
(39) When of Brahmâ a full night had passed went the unwilling gopîs, the
sweethearts of the Supreme Lord, on Krishna's advise to their homes.

XXXXX

We come to know that the gopis did go there.  And Krishna asked them to
return and be with their families.  So that shows that they went there in
their physical bodies alone.  And we also see that 'some' did not manage to
go; prevented they were by their people at home.  They resorted to
meditation.   However, this is a bit puzzling:

// (38) Even the cowherds of Vraja, who bewildered by the power of His mâyâ
all thought that their wives stood at their side, were not jealous with
Krishna. //

It looks like that some cowherds were witnessing the Rasa and saw their
wives in the Rasa.  Yet, they were bewildered by the power of His maya that
they thought  that their wives were indeed standing by their side.  It
appears that they saw their wives with Krishna and yet were not disturbed as
they 'were made to believe' that their wives were by their side.

Someone could explain this better please.

Regards,
subbu
