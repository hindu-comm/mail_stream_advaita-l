Uh where is this occuring?  Shri Jai Simman made a very simple point:

Which sounds eminently sensible to me.  Wouldn't we want the same courtesy 
extended to Advaitins?

Now it has also been said that it is only the view that is being 
criticized not the person and this is of course completely legitimate. 
Perhaps it is best follow the lead of our shastras and introduce incorrect 
views with "some say" or "it is said"  It gives the historian who is 
trying to figure out who "some" is a headache but it avoids the problem of 
making arguments personal.
