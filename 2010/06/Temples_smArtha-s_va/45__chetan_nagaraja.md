Dear All,
          One of the Tenets of Advaita is respect for all, as everything is
Him alone. Having said this the distinction for us between Sri Krishna , or
Lord Shiva does not arise. Neither there is any reason for us to verify the
ancient texts to verify what is correct and what is wrong. Finally all said,
such distinctions are created by man alone, reasons may be social, political
or anything.
Such discussions does not indicate any direction for Advaita or enhance once
understanding , but actually are counter positive.
