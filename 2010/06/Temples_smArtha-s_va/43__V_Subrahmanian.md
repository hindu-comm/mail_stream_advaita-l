Although this method appears to be advantageous, yet it is not free of
problems.  In most such cases the BhAshyakAra or some other commentator
comes to say 'who' that 'some' is.  For example, in the Chandogya Upanishad
VI .2.1 we have the Upanishad saying:

...तद्धैक आहुः असदेवेदमग्र आसीत्....[....With regard to that some say, "In
the beginning this was non-existence alone..."

Shankaracharya, while commenting says: ...एके (some) = nihilists.

Again, the Brahma sutra 3.3.53 is worded: एके आत्मनः शरीरे भावात् [ Some
(deny) the soul's existence....]  Shankaracharya comments:  'some' =
देहमात्रात्मदर्शिनः लोकायतिकाः...those who hold that the body alone is the
self, materialists

Also, a careful reader will always try to 'see thru' every word of what is
said.  Indefinite references like 'some',  'they say'  etc. will not be left
at that; they will be probed and questioned and the author will have to
provide the specific answers.  Shankaracharya, for example, in the sutra:
उत्पत्त्यसंभवात्  2.2.42 says it is the Bhaagavata, pAncharaatra school that
is being discussed here.  Other Acharyas have not agreed with this.
