Yes. Most of the division names bear the name of the place/region they
originated from.  Here are some more:

In Kerala Iyers there is a group called 'Mangomb'.  This is a region-name as
I have understood.

In Kannada Brahmins I have seen/heard of another group called 'Godavari
Brahmins'.  Men of this community used to go from house to house, recite
vedic mantras and receive alms.
