Here are some more:

There is one VelanADu (Telugu speaking smarthas).  In the Tamil Iyer group:
AshTasahasram, vAdimA, Brahacharanam, VaDama, Chozhiyan (Chembai Vaidyanatha
Bhagavathar). Some others like GuruKKaL, Dikshitar (of Chidambaram), etc.
In Kamme group: Karnataka kamme, Huluchu kamme.  Then another group in
Kannada smartha:  koota brAhmaNa (there is a Kalyana Mantapa of these people
on the Bull Temple Road, Bangalore).  The list seems to be ever growing!!

Someone told me that 'Iyer' and 'Aiya' (Narasimhaiya, etc.) are corrupted
versions of the Sanskrit 'Aarya'.

You will be surprised to see several sects within Nambudiris.  See Wikipedia
article.
