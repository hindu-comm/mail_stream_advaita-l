I am Venkatesh Murthy, working as an IT professional in Bangalore. I am
  interested in studying smartha and other brahmin customs culture, 
philosophy, to teach my kids about it. I will be a learner on the list.

The first set of questions I have -

What is the difference between Iyers and other smartha brahmin sub sects 
for example desastha, nambudiris, konkan brahmins and others? Are there no
  differences? Nambudiris put their shikha on the top of the head, not 
back, as shown in the sankaracharya movie. Is this accurate?

Todays newspaper: Palakkad Iyers migrated to Kerala and Mysore Iyengars 
migrated from Srirangam. It is also said that palakkad Iyers were not 
treated well by Nambudiris. And some also married Nair women. Is this 
correct? Mysore Iyengars were treated well. Jayalalitha is a Mysore 
Iyengar?
