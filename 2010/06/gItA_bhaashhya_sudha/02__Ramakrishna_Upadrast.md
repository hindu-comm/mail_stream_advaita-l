namaste Sunil-ji,

> Dear Ramakrishnaji,

> Yes Bhagavad Gita is Vedanta Shastra. The Lord starts from Sankhya and leads us to Vedanta. Interestingly Sanjaya tells us at the end that the Lord had distiiled all from Agama and Nigama. I think our member friends will like to comment on this.

Yes, the the famous 'sarvopanishhado-gaavo-doghdaa-gopaala-nandanaH'
is reflected in the AchArya-ji's comments in the introduction, His
comments on 11.55 as well as at the end of 15th chapter.

praNAmaH
Ramakrishna
