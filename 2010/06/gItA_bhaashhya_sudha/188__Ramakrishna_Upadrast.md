##Those very 'renunciation' and 'karma-yoga', when they are
(respectively) associated  with Knowledge and such of Its means as
equanimity etc. are meant by the words "Samkhya" and "yoga". This is
Lord's view.##

##It is indeed seen that in worship, charity, etc., the determining
factors are the possession of such special qualities as being 'a
knower of Brahman', 'versed in the six auxiliary branches of Vedic
learning', and 'versed in the four Vedas'.##
