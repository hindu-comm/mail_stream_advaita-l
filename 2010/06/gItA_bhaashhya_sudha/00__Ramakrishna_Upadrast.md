Also, the above sentence of the AchArya means that gItA is a vedanta
shaastra, a moxa shaastra, and not a mImAMsa-shaastra (which enjoins
one to do action) with its apUrva/vidhi/nishhedha categories. Now,
Arjuna had come to battle ready to fight and became sorrowful after
seeing his relations. The teaching of the gItA shaastra removed the
sorrow that was previously non-existent, with GYAna as the solution to
the shoka-moha of saMsaara. The Gita teaching did not create a new
situation which lead Arjuna to act. I think that is the point that
AchArya is making.
