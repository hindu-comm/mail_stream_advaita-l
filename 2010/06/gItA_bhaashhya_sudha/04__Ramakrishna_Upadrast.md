Isn't this only the apUrva vidhi category? What about other kinds of
vidhis (niyama/parisaMkhya)? I think that AchArya is saying that what
bhagavaan is teaching to Arjuna is not just a non-apUrva-vidhi, but
also a non-niyama vidhi and non-parisaMkhya-vidhi too (Sorry for this
sentence!). In a sense, a mImAmsakaas would be happy to label
bhagavaan's teaching as arthavaada, and I think we vedantins would be
happy bear that tag!

Please correct me if I am wrong.

I think we are perhaps saying same thing: The teaching removed the
sorrow. The action that followed after is not directly caused by the
teaching. Arjuna had free will to act. He acted. The teaching did
though seeming to goad him into action, removed an impediment only.
(BTW, this argument could be used well against some non-advaitic
vedantic schools!)
