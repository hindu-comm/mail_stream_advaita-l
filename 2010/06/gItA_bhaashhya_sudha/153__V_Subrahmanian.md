Bhagavatpada is never tired to point out the illogicality of having a cause
as an non-existent, abhAva entity.  We have shown  another instance of this
in the bhashyam for the third chapter recently.  It is only from a bhAvarUpa
kAraNa can any kArya come.  The KaraNa and kArya need not be ontological
realities; they could be members of the vyavaharika.  Yet, they have to be
bhAvarUpa if they have to have any purpose to serve and a logical status to
understand them.

Here a distinction  is made between jnAnam and vijnAnam; the former being
the knowledge as obtained from the ShAstram and Acharya and the latter being
the outcome of assimilation of the knowledge.  When the scripture says the
Guru is to be a 'shrotriya brahmaniShTha', it means the presence of the two:
Shaastra teaching *and* the one had on the experiencing the teaching,
assimilation of the teaching.  It is such a Guru who has the personal
experience, aparoksha sAkShAtkAra, a 'tattva dasrshi', that can deliver the
liberating knowledge to a seeker. Sri Krishna uses this term in yet another
place in the Gita:
नासतो विद्यते भावो नाभावो विद्यते सतः।
उभयोरपि दृष्टोऽन्तस्त्वनयोस्तत्त्वदर्शिभिः।।2.16।।
Of the unreal there is no being; the real has no nonexistence. But the
nature of both these, indeed, has been realized by the seers of Truth.

PUjya Swami Paramarthananda calls 'jnAnam and vijnAnam' as 'information and
transformation' respectively.  The former is fruitful only when the latter
is had.  And the one who has the latter alone can most effectively
communicate it to the seeker.  The Kathopanishat too stresses this point:

न नरेणावरेण प्रोक्त एष
सुविज्ञेयो बहुधा चिन्त्यमानः ।
अनन्यप्रोकेते गतिरत्र नास्ति
अणीयान्ह्यतर्क्यमणुप्रमाणात् ॥ 1.2.8

[Atman, when taught by an inferior person, is not easily comprehended,
because It is diversely regarded by disputants. But when It is taught by him
who has become one with Atman, there can remain no more doubt about It.
Atman is subtler than the subtlest and not to be known through argument. ]

Pl. also see Shankaracharya's commentary to the above mantra for finer
insights into the topic.
