Srimad Bhagavatham describes 5 kinds of liberation which are not desired by
devotees of krishna and he attains the state of vishnu.

sālokya-sārsti-sāmīpya- sārūpyaikatvam apy uta  dīyamānam na grhnanti vinā

sa eva bhakti-yogākhya ātyantika udāhṛtaḥ  yenātivrajya
tri-guṇaṁ  mad-bhāvāyopapadyate (3.29.14).

One can reach this state through the path of devas. In Bhagavad Gita (15.6),
the lord says "yad gatva na nivartante". In his bhashya, Sankara writes
"Objection :Is it not well known that all goings end, verily, in returning,
and unions are followed by separations? How is it said that there is no
return for those who come to that Abode? Reply: As to that, listen to the
reason:" and moves on to the next verse "mamaivAmso jIva lOkE..." He
addresses how the jivAtma is one with Paramatma but in the jivAlOka, it is
considered to be an amsa capable transmigrating and ending it.
