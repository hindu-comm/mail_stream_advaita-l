We have seen in advaita there are two types of view points.  One point of 
view says jnAni is like sAkshi, though there is disturbances in 'his' 
prakruti, he would think that it is only prakruti running this show (guNa 
guNEshu vartante) and he wanted to be a witnes without getting attached to 
it...Another view point advocates the view that jnAni entertains sarvAtma 
bhAva, he would see nothing apart from HIM ...so in this case of 'sarvam 
khalvidaM brahma'..he cannot be a sAkshi to witness the 'prakruti' 
show...HE is prakruti, HE is the witness what to say HE is everything & HE 
does not see anything 'vyatireka' to HIS svarUpa  (brahmArpaNam brahma 
havi, brahmAgnau, brahmaNAhutaM)....My question is,  which one is out of 
these two view point, the 'ultimate' realization of the jnAni whether it 
is sAkshi bhAva or sarvAtma bhAva??  IMO in sAkshi bhAva there seems to be 
duality, one is nirvikAri sAkshi who is the witness & the other one is 
prakruti which is still entertaining the 'feelings & emotions' and 
allowing the 'witness' to witness this 'show' is it not ?? 

I posed this doubt in another list also..I hope learned prabhuji-s in this 
list would enlighten me with their thoughtful insights...My special 
request to my cybernet guruji Sri Vidya prabhuji to spend his valuable 
time on my question.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
