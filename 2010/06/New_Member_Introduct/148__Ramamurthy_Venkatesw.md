Dear Professor Brown,



Welcome to the group.  If not considered as an obtrusion, (I reproduce your statement)



As part of that research, I am investigating various Hindu groups, including especially Advaita Vedānta, via an on-line survey. 



Perhaps the alternate presentation could be: studying about various Hindu groups...  



Many of us we categorise the word "investigating" in a negative framework (police investigation, etc.).  



I am neither a scholar in Hinduism nor in English, but a silent follower of the discourses that are taking place through this medium.



With best regards,



Sincerely yours,





R. Venkateswaran

> Dear Members of Advaita-l,
> 
> Having just been introduced to your group, let me thank you for accepting a scholar into your midst and I look forward to your comments and responses to the various issues relevant to Advaita. 
> 
> I would also like to call to your attention to a follow-up to the description of myself (I have copied it below). I mention there that I am currently working on a book regarding Hindu attitudes towards evolution. As part of that research, I am investigating various Hindu groups, including especially Advaita Vedānta, via an on-line survey. 
> 
> I hope that some of you would be willing to help me with that survey, which will go on until at least next October, regarding Hindu views on this topic and related issues in Hinduism and science. As you know, such issues are becoming increasingly important in today's world, and it is important for every religious group to have its views known.

> If you are willing to help, the link to the survey is:

> I would appreciate your sending the link to any Hindu friends you may know. And of course, if you are interested, to take the survey yourself.

> Any help will be much appreciated.

> Here is a brief description of myself:
> I am a professor of Religion at Trinity University in San Antonio, Texas. I
> have a Ph.D. in the History of Religion from Harvard University (1973). My
> special field was the Hindu Tradition, with sub-fields in Purāṇic literature
> and Advaita Vedānta. In recent years I have become interested in the
> intersection of religion and science in general, and Hinduism and science in
> particular, especially the attitude of Hindus of various affiliations
> towards evolution.
> My interest in Advaita Vedānta at this point in my life is one of a scholar.
> I have been working for a number of years on a book entitled “Hindu
> Perspectives on Evolution and Creation: Darwin, Dharma, and Design.” As part
> of the research for the book, I am investigating the attitudes of important
> Hindu groups, one of the most important being that of Advaita Vedānta.
