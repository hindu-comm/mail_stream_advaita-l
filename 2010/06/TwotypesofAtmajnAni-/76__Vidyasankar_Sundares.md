Bhaskar, there is a reason I wanted to go back to fundamentals. All that
you say would make sense only if you define the word jnAnI and the term
samyag-darSana in particular ways. All that others say make sense only
because others define the word jnAnI and samyag-darSana in a more
flexible way than you do. It is because of the more flexible definition that
others can talk about -vara, -varIya and -varishTha among jnAnI-s. You
cannot apply your definition of jnAnI to what the others say, without
examining your basics and their basics more thoroughly. Otherwise, all
everybody can do is to talk in circles without improving any understanding.



The heavy sarcasm in which you couch your responses, surrounded by a
lot of respectful prabhuji-s doesn't help either. Beyond a point, it does
sound quite false. I am saying this to you frankly and openly, only because
you have given me a title of one of your cyber-gurus. 

While going back to basics, here are a couple of other deep fundamentals
to ponder about. Does a jnAnI (under any definition) interact with other
human beings or inanimate objects at all? If yes, how? If not, why not?



Best regards,

Vidyasankar
