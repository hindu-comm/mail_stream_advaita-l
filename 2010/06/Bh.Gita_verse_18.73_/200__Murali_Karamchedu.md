How are we to understand Arjuna's stay in naraka, and then svarga, after his
death in light of this samyagdarshana?In the mahabharata, after Yudhishtira's 
bath, and shedding his mortal body, when Yama takes him by naraka, Yudishtira
encounters Arjuna there. So, there is clearly a 'going somewhere' after death
in this kind of jnana, and is distinct from the characterization of not going
anywhere after jnana.
