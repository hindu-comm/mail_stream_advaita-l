> In anAdimatparambrahma (BG 13.13), Sankaracharya says mat is for metre.
> Krishna is intelligent enough to say anaditatparambrahma. If the lord used

Please enlighten the list on the following : 



1. Are you reading the SAnkara bhAshya on the gItA in the original Sanskrit?
2. Are you reading a translation of the bhAshya into another language?
3. If so, whose translation are you reading?
4. Or are you reading what a completely different publication attributes to Sankara?



We can parse anAdimatparam brahma and what the bhAshya actually says about it
once your assumptions are clearer to the rest of us.



Regards,

Vidyasankar
