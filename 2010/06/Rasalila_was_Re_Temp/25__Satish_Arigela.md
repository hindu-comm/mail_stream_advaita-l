They say this is found in the padmapurANa and it is seen as a later day interpolation. Some purANa-s were really botched up to the point where you cant tell what the original looked like. This is one example.

Dear Subrahmanianji,

I would like to add two points more onto the ongoing discussion. 
1)
Lord Shiva too joined the Rasa dance in the form of a Gopi and Lord Krishna recognised Him and adressed Him as  Gopeshwara.
2)
One night of Brahma is not a few days and nights. It is an astronomical figure in many thousands of years.
