There are clear statements which say that jivatma is an amsa of the 
paramatma (mamaivamso).
Is there at least one verse in Bhagavad Gita which can be interpreted 
unambigously as evidence for advaitam?

praNAms
Hare Krishna

One need not have to search & pick selective geeta verses for the 
unambigious interpretation of advaita...The follower of advaita siddhAnta 
knows that his parampara Acharya-s keeping the adhikAra bedha in sAdhaka-s 
in mind and contextually interpreted geeta verses to suit one and all & 
ultimately teaches the Atmaikatva vidya by doing the proper samanvaya from 
the purports of shruti, smruti & nyAya prasthAna. 

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
