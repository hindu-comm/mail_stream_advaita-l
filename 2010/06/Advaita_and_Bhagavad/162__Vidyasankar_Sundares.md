Assuming that this is a genuine question, please see, 



udArAs sarva evaite jnAnI tv Atmaiva me matam
Asthitas sa hi yuktAtmA mAmevAnuttamAM gatim - 7.18


bahUnAM janmanAm ante jnAnavAn mAM prapadyate 
vAsudevas sarvam iti sa mahAtmA sudurlabhaH - 7.19



bhagavAn kRshNa here explicitly says that the jnAnI is his own
AtmA. The true advaitin jnAnI is someone for whom vAsudeva is
indeed ALL. He does not exclude his own jIva from this sarvam.
He knows that even when he says "I", in relation to something
that is not "I", all of it is only vAsudeva. Because of this, he is
the dearest to bhagavAn. Please note in this connection, the
bRhadAraNyaka reference where the AtmA is indeed the dearest.
The so-called jIva-brahma-aikya should not be understood as
misrepresented by Gaudiya Vaishnavas. Where there is aikya
realized, there is no more jIva! There is only brahman.


The advaitin jnAnI is the one who truly realizes the insignificance
of the jIva, unlike those other self-proclaimed bhakta-s who
loudly trumpet their insignificance but cling to it for dear life
when it comes time to obliterate their own self-identification
with this insignificant entity.


To see the advaitic import of these verses, one has to really 
read the bhagavadgItA as it is, and step away from the polemics
in the book that carries the title "The Bhagavadgita as it is".
Sorry, couldn't resist that!



Regards,

Vidyasankar
