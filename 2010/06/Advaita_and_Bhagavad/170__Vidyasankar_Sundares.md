> Vidyasankar, if jnani is the self why does he take many lives to attain or
> surrender to the lord? (bahunam janmanam ante jnanavan mam prapadyate 7.19)

Why do you think the jnAnavAn goes through many janmas? The verse is to 
be understood instead like this - after taking on many lives (bahUnAM janmAnAm
ante), one acquires jnAna and resorts to Me, who is his own Self.

The jnAnI does not have any further rebirths, in this or any other loka.

Vidyasankar
