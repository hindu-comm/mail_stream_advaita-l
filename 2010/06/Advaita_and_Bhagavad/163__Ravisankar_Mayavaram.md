अहमात्मा गुडाकेश सर्वभूताशयस्थितः।
अहमादिश्च मध्यं च भूतानामन्त एव च॥ १० -२०॥
ahamAtmA guDAkesha sarvabhUtAshayasthitaH |
ahamAdishcha madhyaM cha bhUtAnAmanta eva cha || 10 -20 ||

Sri Ramana Maharshi considers this verse as the *essence* of bhagavad
giitaa.

One can come back and say this aatmaa is paramaatmaa and so on.  For us,
there is  only (one) aatmaa, rest is mithya.  This is the only entity that
exists at all time and transcends it; and it has no second.

In the case of jIva, buddhi thinks that it is aatmaa.  This mix up is well
explained (for example, दृग्दर्शनशक्त्योरेकात्मतेवास्मिता of yogasuutras).
