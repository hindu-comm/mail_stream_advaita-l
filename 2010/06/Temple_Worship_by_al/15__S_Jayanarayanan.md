Thanks for the link. The relevant quote from the above website is:

"As to who is quqlified to do worship in temples, the Vaikanasa and 
Pancharatra agamas express different views.

 According to Vaikanasa , the priest must be a householder. Upanayana is the 
only ceremony required. He may be trained in Vedas and Shrauta texts.He must be 
a brahmin as upanayana is insisted ,belonging to vaikanasa families.

 According to Pancharatra texts, the priet may belong to any ashrama except 
Sanyasa.

 Pancha Samskara and Chakrabja diksha is necessary for pararta puja meaning 
worshipping for the community. Some Pancharatra texts allow all castes to do 
puja and even women are allowed to do pujas at temples (Vishwamitra Samhita.)."

Interesting - the Pancharatra is more liberal than the Vaikhanasa! There is mention of the Pancharatra in the Mahabharata, perhaps it is the same one?

Shanti Parva, SECTION CCCXL

"This great Upanishad, perfectly consist with the four Vedas, in harmony with Sankhya-yoga, and called by him by the name of the Pancharatra scriptures, and recited by Narayana himself with his own mouth, was repeated by Narada in the presence of many hearers in the abode of Brahman (his sire) in exactly the same way in which Narayana (while that great god had showed himself unto him) had recited it, and in which he had heard it from his own lips."

As I mentioned in the thread before, there are Shiva Linga shrines around the Arunachala mountain where the "priests" (I don't know if they may be called that) are not Brahmins. At least, I did not see a Yajnopavita thread on them. But Aradhana was performed and Vibhuti offered to the devotees.

Here's an almost exhaustive list and description of all shrines around the Arunachala mountain:
