I was referring to the following observation concerning the Pancharatra:

"Some Pancharatra texts allow all castes to do puja and even women are allowed to do pujas at temples (Vishwamitra Samhita.)"

http://www.ibiblio.org/sripedia/oppiliappan/archives/may06/msg00199.html

I was only wondering whether or not those outside the Brahmin caste are permitted to *physically worship* the main deity at the temple. Perhaps not as priests, but at least perform worship outside of priestly activity. If the above claim is correct that all castes can do puja at the temple (pancharatra-based), then it answers my question.

Is there someone else to "please" other than the deity? :-)
