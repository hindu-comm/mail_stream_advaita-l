My point precisely. There is really no disapproval of such a "spontaneous" temple worship, as you call it. Again, I must point out that I'm referring to Thinnan's case, before he became Kannappa.

This is unlike the express prohibition of any kind of priestly activity in Yajnas and Homas by those who are not Dvijas. Some castes can participate in a Yajna as non-priests, but I think Thinnan would be considered an outcaste and cannot even participate in a Yajna.

I agree with you that certainly no one would recommend everyone else to follow such a kind of worship!

The converse question is more pertinent - do all of these temples have Agamic disapproval?
