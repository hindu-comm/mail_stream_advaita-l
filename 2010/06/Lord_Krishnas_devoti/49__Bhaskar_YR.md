In the Anuśāsanīka -parvan of the Mahābhārata,
 Lord Krishna Himself explains His penance to obtain a darshan of Lord
Shiva:

praNAms 
Hare Krishna

If my memory serves me right, in anushAsava parva we can see that shiva is 
depicted as the creator of even trimurthi-s (brama, vishNu & rudra) It is 
said there that shiva bhagavAn created the 'creator' brahma from his right 
eye, vishNu from left eye and at the end of yuga, he created the 'rudra' 
also...and in shAnti parva (!!?? not sure) it is said that shiva is the 
'rakshaka' (protector) of these trimurthi-s and he would guard them from 
their difficulties...Anyway, I donot want to give the interpretation as 
given by prabhupAd of ISKCON to belittle these seeming 'shivapAramya 
shlOka-s'.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
