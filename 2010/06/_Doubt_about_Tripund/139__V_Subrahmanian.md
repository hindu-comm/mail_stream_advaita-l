Namaste.

Here are some inputs on this topic:

There are several types of applying 'something' on the forehead in several
sampradaya-s.

1.  Among smartha-s, there is a group who align with a vaishnava tradition.
In their custom the gopi chandana is applied, as Urdhvapundra.  These poeple
are not averse to applying bhasma as they do it occasionally.

2. There are some Tamil smartha sections that apply chandana, as a kind of
ardha-chandra, in several parts of the upper body too . This they do only in
the morning after bath.  In the evenings they apply bhasma.

3.  There are some Tamil smartha and even Kerala Iyer communities who wear
the 'naamam' just as Srivaishnavaites (Iyengars) do, in red colour.  Unless
they tell, one would easily conclude that they are Srivaishnavaites.  They
say that it is their 'family custom'.

The word 'bhasma' is said to be having a meaning:  bhasanAt, because it
shines, conveying that it is Jnana.  Applying it all over the body signifies
that one is Jnana svarupam.

There is a saying, of the ancient Tamil poetess Avvayyaar:  நீறில்லா நெற்றி
பாழ்.  'meeRillaa neRRi paazh' 'meaning: that forehead that does not don the
bhasma is doomed' signifying that one should not leave it blank.  It is a
rakshaa:  In the pUjA vidhAnam it is called: भस्मरक्षां समर्पयामि -  'I
offer the bhasma-protection, talisman, to the Lord'.

Shri Vyas ji said:

//I have also noticed that Marathi people or people from Marathi-influenced
areas often wear a tilak made of chandan in a triple curved shape joined at
the edges.  If you've seen a photo of Lokamanya Tilak that's what I mean.//

Yes.  Even some Telugu and Kannada Brahmins do this.
