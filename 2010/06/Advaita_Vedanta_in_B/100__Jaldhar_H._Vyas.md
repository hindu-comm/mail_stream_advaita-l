The mathAmnAya and similar works present a very stylized view of affairs. 
In practice, the jurisdiction of maths tended to depend on support from 
civil rulers.  So the writ of Govardhana matha extended into the domains 
of the Gajapatis of Orissa only.  Bengali Advaitins may have felt greater 
loyalty to the dashanami akhadas to which they were bound by guru-shishya 
parampara and which are mainly headquarted in Kashi.

This is just my impression from studying history.  Perhaps Vidyashankar 
can give a more knowledgeable answer.
