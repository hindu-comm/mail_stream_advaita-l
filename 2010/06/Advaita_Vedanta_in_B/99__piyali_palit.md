Namaste.

I would like to know about practice of advaita vedAnta in Bengal/Banga which is under the jurisdiction of Govardhana Matha according to mathAmnAya. It is also notable that most of the Bengali scholars in advaita vedAnta were more affilliated to kAshI/vArANasI instead of Sri JagannAthadhAma. Kindly enlighten me in this subject.
