Namaste.

Here are some more points worth noting about the impossibility of 'svarUpa
naasha' in the Vedaamtic Kaivalya  characterized by Brahman alone existing:

The Bhagavadgita 2.16 teaches:  न अभावो विद्यते सतः  [ Existence
(Atman/Brahman) will never go out of existence.]  That assures that Atman
will never become non-existent, destroyed, in any circumstance whatsoever.

It would be interesting to note that the Chandogya Upanishad Chapter 6
teaches the Self-knowledge, sad-vidyA.  Here, the word 'Brahman' is not used
and instead the word 'Sat' is used.  Sat is Brahman, Satyam.  The Upanishad
begins by presenting Sat as the cause of the universe.  After a long
deliberation on the non-difference of the effect from the cause, the
Upanishad concludes by teaching 'That Self of the universe is Satyam, you
are That, Shvetaketu'.  The Upanishadic teaching is:  Atman the Self of the
body-mind complex is none other than the Sat that is the self of the whole
universe which includes the body-mind complex as well.  This is because the
body-mind apparatus is also made of the same elements that go into making
the entire universe.  These elements are themselves effects of the Sat.  On
the basis of the three illustrations: clay-clay-products, gold-ornaments and
iron-implements the Upanishad had taught that all effects being
transformations, vikAra, are unreal as transformations (name/form) but real
only as their material cause.  mRttiketyeva satyam.  sadeva satyam.

Since the Upanishad itself has taught that the Atma is non-different from
Sat, there is no question of Atman losing its svarUpa in the
kaivalya/liberated state where Brahman alone remains.  It is further
interesting to note that the Lord in Gita 2.16 had taught the Atman as Sat,
the one that never goes out of existence (as contrasted with 'anAtma',
'asat' that has no existence at all].  The Upanishad teaches Sat as Brahman,
the cause of the universe.  Thus, the Gita 'Sat' Atma is the Upanishadic
Sat, Brahman.  'Atmaa cha Brahma' is the pithy sentence of the Sutra
bhaashya.

Thus, on the authority of the Gita and the Upanishad we conclude that there
can never be the possibility of the Atman losing its svarUpa, 'svarUpa
nAsha',  in the state of Kaivalya.

We have seen other scriptural passages in this connection in the earlier
posts on this topic.  Also, svarUpa naasha could be spoken of only in the
case of any 'merger'.  The case of the Atman attaining Kaivalya is not a
case of merger.  Merger presupposes more than one entity that could come
together to form a merger.  Here we have only one Consciousness that alone
appears (appeared) as the Atman in the body-mind apparatus (upAdhi) and as
the sarva-vyApi Brahman, Sat, in the jagat-upAdhi.  What happens in kaivalya
is only the extinguishing, through viveka, knowledge, of the upAdhi-s.  In
the absence of the upAdhi-s, what remains over is just the One Chaitanya,
Consciousness called Brahman, Sat.

Om Tat Sat
