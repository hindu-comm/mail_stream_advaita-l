 With reference to the above, it would be beneficial to learn what the
Chandogya Upanishad  Chapter 3 says:

// 2. "As people who do not know the spot where a treasure of gold has been
hidden somewhere in the earth, walk over it again and again without finding
it, so all these creatures day after day go into the World of Brahman and
yet do not find it, because they are carried away by untruth. *

3. "That Self abides in the heart. The etymological explanation of
*heart*is this: This one (ayam) is in the heart (hridi); therefore It
is called the
heart (hridayam). He who knows this goes every day in deep sleep to Heaven
(i.e. Brahman, dwelling in the heart).
*

4. "Now, this serene being, after rising from this physical body and
attaining the Highest Light, reaches his own true form. This is the Self."
Thus he (i.e. the teacher, questioned by his pupils) spoke. Continuing, he
said: "This is the immortal, the fearless. This is Brahman. And of this
Brahman the name is Satyam, the True."//

Shankaracharya comments on this last mantra:  'rising up from this body',
giving up this body, i e. giving up the idea of identity of the Self with
the body ....Before the attainment of this true nature, he had accepted
through ignorance the body, which is other than his own nature, s his own
Self.  As distinguished from that, it is being said, 'in his true nature.'

Another point to be remembered regarding the (im)possibility of 'losing
one's nature', 'svarUpa nAsha' in the state of kaivalya is that - even if
one wishes to destroy/lose one's nature, svarUpa, it is impossible to do so
as the Bhagavadgita has taught:  The Self cannot be destroyed by burning,
cutting, .....killing, etc.  अच्छेद्योऽयं, अदाह्योऽयं.....न हन्यते हन्यमाने
शरीरे.  There is no way one can bring about the destruction of the Self.
So, in the state of Kaivalya, the Self alone remains.  The loss of
individuality is not tolerable to some poeple and thus they raise this
objection to the Vedantic Kaivalya.
