Namaste Sudhanshu Ji,

Since there has been no other response, I am responding.

You have admitted travel to dhvani from its origin to
shrotra-indriya-golaka based on the Bhashya 1-3-28. I am copying the
immediately succeeding part from the same Bhashya.

<< प्रत्यासीदतश्च पटुमृदुत्वादिभेदं वर्णेष्वासञ्जयति ; >>

<< pratyAsIdatashcha paTumRRidutvAdibhedaM varNeShvAsa~njayati ; >>

Translation  << but invests  the letters with such differences as high or
low pitch etc in his ears as he approaches nearer >>.

In other words, dhvani becomes shabda as its origin moves closer to the
ears. Notice still the cognition is at the shrotra-indriya-golaka only as
earlier with dhvani (as defined by you).

Does this not constitute Bhashya PramANa for travel of shabda (as defined
by you) from its origin?

Regards
Chandramouli
