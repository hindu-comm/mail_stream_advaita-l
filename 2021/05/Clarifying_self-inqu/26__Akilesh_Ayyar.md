The fundamental question behind nonduality and self-inquiry is "Who am I?"
Many people get confused by this question, interpreting it in philosophical
or psychological terms, or asking it as a kind of koan or mantra. It is not
meant to be any of these. Who am I refers to a single specific activity:
the activity of trying to hone in on or locate a facet of our own
moment-to-moment experience, that part of it which knows "I witness this
experience and am not it." As soon as we try to locate this, we find we
engage in a chase, because that aspect becomes elusive. Staying on the
chase is how we try to answer the question. The I we think we are, the
witnessing I, turns out to be a kind of illusion, which reveals the deeper
and truer I, the true Self.
