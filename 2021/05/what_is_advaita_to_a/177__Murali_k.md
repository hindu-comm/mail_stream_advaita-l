Hi Vinodh,
>

Wonderful answer. A follow up question, if I may:

How  does one go about setting goals/targets in order to motivate oneself
to fulfill one's duties  while still following all the precepts?

Does one also offer the results of such a goal to Ishwara? Or Dedicate the
action/goal itself to Ishwara?

Best,
Murali
