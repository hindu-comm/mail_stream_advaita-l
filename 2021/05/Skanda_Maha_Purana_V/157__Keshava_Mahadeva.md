This is the PART 2 lecture on Vyasa Ashtakam which comes in the Skanda
Maha Purana
Kashi Khanda Chapter 95 Verses (56-63). This is sung by Vyasa Maharishi.
Vyasa Maharishi makes an offensive statement entering Kashi and he gets
punished for making that offensive statement. Then Vyasa regretting his act
sings this Ashtakam glorifying Lord Shiva as the Supreme Reality. The
Puranas goes on to say that by chanting or hearing this Ashtakam, one will
get relieved of all their sins and attain Sannidhya (close proximity) with
Lord Shiva in Para Kailasha.
