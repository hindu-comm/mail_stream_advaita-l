Jagadguru Shankara Bhagavatpaadaacharya is widely remembered for playing a
crucial role in reforming and reorganizing India’s spiritual framework.
Hinduism, as we know it today, owes its existence to this Acharya.

Though several centuries have passed since his physical disappearance, he
continues to be the most important spiritual and philosophical ambassador
of Sanaatana Dharma.

Innumerable saints and scholars have paid obeisance to Acharya Shankara
through soul-stirring verses steeped in devotion.

Let us savour a few of such verses and thereby express our gratitude to the
Jagadguru 🙏🏻

Acharyopasana is a reverential work dedicated at the Lotus Feet of
Jagadguru Shri Adi Shankaracharya who enlightens the disciple through
Atmavidya in a profound, as well as a simple way so as to reach every
human, right from a scholar to a layman. This presentation is a compilation
of shlokas composed by several saints in praise of Acharya Shankara.
The text of all these shlokas are available in the link below:
