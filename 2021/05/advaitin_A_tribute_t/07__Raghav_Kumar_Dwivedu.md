Namaste Subbu ji
Thank you for sharing the tribute to Pujya Swami Omkarananda ji.

His service to the dharma is unforgettable. One anecdote comes to mind.
His own conduct in vyavahAra was so impeccable and wise in keeping with the
strict tradition of sannyAsa. He was therefore requested to guide, mentor
and 'rescue' a major ashram in Tiruvannamalai which had huge legacy
problems due to serious limitations/blemishes of the previous
administrators. The ashram then turned a new leaf under his guidance
benefitting many.


Om
Raghav
