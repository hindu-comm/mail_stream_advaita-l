This is the second of the Brahma Sutra Bhashya (Chatussutri part)
exposition by Sri Venkataraghavan in Tamil.  It is not easy to bring out

will serve the purpose of correctly comprehending the purport of the
Bhashya.  One can access the playlist to keep in tune with the forthcoming
parts in this series.
