Subject: Re: {भारतीयविद्वत्परिषत्} Looking for the source of this
Pancharatra passage
To: भारतीयविद्वत्परिषत् <bvparishat at googlegroups.com>


The verse can be found, with slight variants, in the Pāñcarātra
Paramasaṃhitā, as verse 12.65. This
link should lead to the right page of a scan of the Baroda edition.
