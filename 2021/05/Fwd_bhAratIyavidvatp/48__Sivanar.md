SAdara praNAm Sri Subbuji,
Hearty thanks for the response!
*SAdhana panchakam* with the starting verse "*VedonithyamadheeyathAm" *
is considered by some scholars as the last instructions of Acharya
BhagavadpAda.
Recently  got an enquiry about available sanskrit commentaries, if any, on
it.
Actually there is no need for any commentary as the instructions are
crystal clear and the work with simple meaning is available in many
languages. Hence the post.
Namaste.
*Prof. Sivakumar *
