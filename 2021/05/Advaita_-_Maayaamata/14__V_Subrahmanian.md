In the 'Vedanta Tattvaloka' of Janardana (who is identified with
Anandagiri, the Teekaakaara of the Bhashyakara, we find an interesting
epithet being used to denote Advaita:  मायामतम् (Maayaamatam).  This is a
synonym for Maayaavaada/i, used by Bhamati, a few times.

This is not a pejorative usage by an opponent but a factual denoting of
Vedanta (by the Vedantin himself), which is opposed to all the other
schools such as Sankhya, Nyaya, Vaisheshika, etc. which hold the world,
bandha, bheda, etc. to be real.

The term in the Tattvaloka occurs in the first pariccheda while refuting
the Bhaskara doctrine of bhedAbheda. He accepts a Shakti that brings about
the Parinama (in Brahman?) and the Advaitin asks whether that Shakti is
asatya or satya.  If it is the former, then it falls into the मायामतम् .

Just thought of sharing this 'finding.'
