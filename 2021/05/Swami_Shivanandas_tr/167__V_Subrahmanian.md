" It can be affirmed, without any fear of contradiction, that Bharata
Varsha would have ceased to be Bharata Varsha several centuries ago and
would never have survived the murderous sword, the devastating fire and the
religious intolerance of the successive invaders, if Sankara had not lived
the life he lived and taught the lessons he taught. And those lessons are
still pulsating in every cell and in every protoplasm of the true aspirant
and the true Hindu. "
