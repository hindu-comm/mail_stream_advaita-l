The Anandagiri gloss to the Brahmasutra bhashya, very last sutra says: ये
तावदूर्ध्वरेतसः स्वाश्रमधर्ममात्रनिष्ठा ब्रह्मचर्येण
ब्रह्मलोकमधिरूढास्तेषामन्तरेण विद्यां बन्धध्वंसासिद्धेरस्त्येवावृत्तिः ।
Those Sannyasins, by virtue of their adherence to their ashrama dharma,
reach Brahmaloka by their brahmacharya, in the absence of their securing
the Brahmavidya there, will have to return from there.

The Ratnaprabha on the same sutra bhashya says:

यद्यपि तेषामिह न पुनरावृत्तिरिमं मानवमिति च श्रुतिष्विहेममिति
विशेषणादस्मिन्कल्पे ब्रह्मलोकं गतानां कल्पान्तरे आवृत्तिर्भाति,
तथापीश्वरोपास्तिं विना पञ्चाग्निविद्याश्वमेधदृढब्रह्मचर्यादिसाधनैर्ये
गतास्तेषां तत्त्वज्ञाननियमाभावादावृत्तिः स्यात्, ये तु दहरादीश्वरोपास्त्या
गतास्तेषां सगुणविद्याफलक्षयेऽपि
निरवग्रहेश्वरानुग्रहलब्धात्मज्ञानान्मुक्तिरिति नियम इत्यभिप्रेत्याह -

अन्तवत्त्वेऽपि त्विति ।

Gist is: (apart from the kalpantara returning people), those who have
reached Brahmaloka by panchagnividya, ashvamedha, severe brahmacharya, etc.
as by default they will not get Brahmajnana, they are bound to return.
Others, due to dahra vidya, etc. which are Ishwara upasana, upon the
exhaustion of the fruit of saguna upasana, owing to the unimpeded Ishwara
anugraha, will get atmajnana and will attain mukti.

The case of the candidate for krama mukti is distinct from the yoga
bhrashta who is spoken of in the Bh.Gita 6th chapter.  The latter are
aspirants of Nirguna vidya here and upon their death before attaining their
goal, will go to punya lokas, remain there for long and return to this loka
to continue their nirguna brahma vidya sadhana.  The saguna upasakas who
are destined for brahma loka are those who are clearly involved in saguna
meditation throughout their life and at the time of death, will leave the
body, and their sukshma sharira will attain Brahma loka.  These alone are
candidates for krama mukti.  The former are not called krama mukti
candidates.
