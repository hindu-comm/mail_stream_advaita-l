Namaste
There are a few such stories/accounts of a resident of even kailasha and
vaikuntha having to return to bhUloka.

The way to reconcile this is in brahma sutra bhAShya where it is said that
the residents of brahma loka do not return to this loka anymore, in this
kalpa (cycle of creation), implying that they may do so in some cases in
the next cycle.

One acharya once said that this is to account for those rare cases of
someone who attains brahmaloka through repeated ashvamedhA sacrifices and
other special rituals.

In such cases, there may not be enough motivation towards GYAnam etc., and
they return to complete their journeys in the next kalpa.


Om
Raghav
