Advaita accepts Krama mukti where a saguna upasaka in this loka, without
striving for and attaining Nirguna Brahma vidya, upon death, goes to Brahma
loka (which is the common name for Vaikuntha, etc.).  There, taught the
Nirguna Vidya by the Head of Brahma loka, Brahmaa himself, one becomes a
Jnani and upon the Brahma loka undergoing maha pralaya, all the residents
of that loka, including the Head, will attain videha kaivalya and never
return to samsara.
