DURGĀ PARAMEŚVARĪ AKHANDA PĀRĀYANAM:

As we are witnessing, the second wave of the pandemic has been more
ferocious. Our Ubhaya Jagadgurus have already guided us that praying to
Goddess Durgā Parameśvarī is the only way to overcome the pandemic. How can
the ever-compassionate mother neglect Her children who come to Her for
refuge!

We plead each one of you to be with us for at least one slot. Amba’s
compassion is sure to protect us all and restore peace and happiness that
we are seeking.

Date: 30/5/2021

Time: 8:30 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. IST

Duration of each slot: 45 minutes

Number of chants per slot: 50 times
