Self-inquiry and surrender seem incompatible with other tasks -- how can
you concentrate on two things at once? In fact, however, you do not even
concentrate on one thing... that is all part of the egoic illusion, which
believes itself to be separate and independent. Self-inquiry and surrender
appear to be effortful activities, but in fact simply describe the fact of
the Self in its eternal status as subject, as turning away from objects.
