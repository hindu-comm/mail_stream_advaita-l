Would there be then the situation where one is perceiving/knowing not the
object per se but only a reflection or a compromise  of it and still think
that he is perceiving the object itself?  Would this then fall in the
category of ayathartha jnana, bhrama?  Or would this be something like a
'samvaadi / visamvaadi bhrama' of the Panchadashi?

HH Sri Chandrashekhara Bharati Swaminah had once remarked: when X rays are
used to get a view of a fetus, for instance, what the resultant picture we
get to see is not the fetus 'as it is' but only that of the object that has
reacted to the X ray.  I think somewhat similar would be the case.
