Vedanta Paribhasha:

तत्र घटाद्यवच्छिन्नं चैतन्यं विषयचैतन्यम् , अन्तःकरणवृत्त्यवच्छिन्नं
चैतन्यं प्रमाणचैतन्यम् , अन्तःकरणावच्छिन्नं चैतन्यं प्रमातृचैतन्यम् ।
 तत्र यथा तडागोदकं छिद्रान्निर्गत्य कुल्यात्मना केदारान् प्रविश्य तद्वदेव
चतुष्कोणाद्याकारं भवति, तथा तैजसमन्तःकरणमपि चक्षुरादिद्वारा निर्गत्य
घटादिविषयदेशं गत्वा घटादिविषयाकारेण परिणमते । स एव परिणामो
वृत्तिरित्युच्यते ।    This, read with the following concluding part of the
Pratyaksha Pariccheda of the Vedanta Paribhasha:   चक्षुःश्रोत्रे तु स्वत
एव विषयदेशं गत्वा स्वस्वविषयं गृह्णीतः, श्रोत्रस्यापि चक्षुरादिवत्
परिच्छिन्नतया भेर्यादिदेशगमनसम्भवात् ।     gives us the idea: antaHkaraNam
going out 'through' the chakshurindriya means: the chakshurindriya too goes
out, along with the anathkaraNam to the vishayadesha to contact the
vishaya.

// निरिन्द्रियत्व आपत्ति//  whose objection is this, on whom?

In Prashna and other Upanishads there is a story, only a story, where each
indirya will leave the body for one year and return to find that he has
been carrying on without that particular indriya.  This is just a story,
but yet the  निरिन्द्रियत्व आपत्ति is there.
