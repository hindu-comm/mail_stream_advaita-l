Namaste Sudhanshu Ji,

I have not come across the concept of दण्डायमान श्रोत्र वृत्ति. There is
only manOvritti. This gains knowledge  thru the indriyas.

Reg  << It cannot be argued that every moment new vritti is created >>,

Indeed yes. It is so. The manOvritti is understood as a continuous stream
of  momentary vrittis in one view while in another, a vritti is admitted to
persist for the same cognition till rise of another vritti for a different
cognition. It would not be appropriate to consider that mind and shrotra
are already there at vishaya desha at the beginning of cognition and hence
no time delay need be considered for subsequent sounds.  I am not sure if
same frequency can be considered as an unchanging cognition of sound.

Regards

Chandramouli
