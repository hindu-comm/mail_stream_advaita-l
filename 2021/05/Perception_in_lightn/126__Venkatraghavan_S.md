Yes, but that rUpa is a property of the physical object, which requires the
manovRtti to move towards the object. rUpa is not light emanating from the
object, it is a property inhering in it. Where in the paribhASha has this
idea of rUpa been stated?

If it is a property of the object, it leads to the question, how can you
see the galaxy's rUpa if the galaxy does not exist any longer?

One solution which you had suggested was that rUpa is actually light that
travels and meets the manovRtti.

Instead of changing the nature of rUpa, I had suggested that it is not rUpa
that is seen by chakshu, but reflected light. That idea has certainly not
been suggested by the existing vedAnta framework.

Regards,
Venkatraghavan
