How would you consider the shabda-vishaya to be the same? shabda is unlike
rUpa that can be argued to be the same viShaya. You may say that it is a
continuous vRtti in the case of someone seeing the ghaTa between times t1
and t2, but not with shabda. The shabda at t2 is completely different from
t1. The manas may behave the same in the case of both the indriyas but the
indriyas themselves may behave differently causing such bheda in cognition.

Kind rgds,
