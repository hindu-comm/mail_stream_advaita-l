Namaste.

Reg  << Yes, but that rUpa is a property of the physical object, which

That is why I mentioned them as exceptional cases. In the case of a
momentarily manifesting luminous entity like lightning, or luminous
entities like moon,stars etc wherein only their luminosities are
experienced through the sense of sight, I understand the experience of
seeing them as their luminosity only. And as emitting light only. Thus
their rUpa in my experience is as a luminous object only.

Maybe to stand the test of rigorous scrutiny, changes (parishkAra) in
terminology could be called for. I am satisfied with less rigorous analysis.
