Namaste.

The following could perhaps form the basis for a resolution of the issue.

What is cognized through vision is the rUpa (color) of the Vishaya. It
could be considered as the light enveloping the object or emanating from it
(in the case of lightning for example) as the case may be. While ‘being
 distant’ is also perceived in the cognition, the actual location is not
when the distance is large. Same with shabda or sound. While the sound is
cognized as well as it being ‘distant’, exact distance is not involved in
the cognition.

We can now consider ‘where’  the cognition takes place when all the three
involved in the cognition; namely antahkarana vritti,rUpa or light
enveloping/emnating from the object, and shabda or sound emanating from the
object;  all three are in motion, and the distances between the objects and
the experience are large.The location where visual cognition takes place
can be considered as the location where the rUpa or light enveloping the
object or emanating from it is coincident with the antahkarana vritti
issuing forth through the eyes. Similarly for the cognition of sound. These
locations need not be the same as their origin. When distances involved are
negligible compared to their speeds, location of cognition will be
practically the same as the object. When distances are large, they could be
quite different.

This explains the reason for cognition taking place at different times in
case of lightning and thunder for example. This would also cover anomalies
in respect of cognition of very distant stars/planets etc.
