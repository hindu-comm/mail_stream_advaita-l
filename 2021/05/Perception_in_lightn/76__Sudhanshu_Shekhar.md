Hari Om,

In case of visual and audible perception, mind is said to go out along with
chakshu and shrota indriya and make contact with vishaya and turn
vishayAkAra. Reflection of chaitanya then gives rise to visual and audible
perception.

In case of lightning, if the mind reaches there simultaneously with shrotra
and chakshu, the perception of light and sound should be simultaneous. But
this is not the case.

If the mind does not reach there simultaneously, then the conclusion would
be attribution of different speeds to mind+chakshu vis-a-vis mind+shrotra.

How to understand it in the traditional framework.

Regards,
Sudhanshu Shekhar.
