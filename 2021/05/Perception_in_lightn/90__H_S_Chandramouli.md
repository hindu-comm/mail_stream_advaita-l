Namaste.

I had raised the possibility just to point out that there can really be no
specific objection to such a postulate. There may be no need or upapatti
either or the same.

However another point may be mentioned. Lightning and thunder occupy such a
vast space that there is no way of identifying any specific common location
for their origin. Hence the observation

<< In case of lightning, if the mind reaches there simultaneously with
shrotra
and chakshu, the perception of light and sound should be simultaneous. But
this is not the case >>

is perhaps not valid.

Chandramouli
