While talking to Sri Mani Dravid Sastrigal about the question, he was of
the opinion that the mind with the shrotrendriyam reaches the vishaya desha
'after' the m + c indirya.  There is no upapatti as such to account for the
relatively slow movement of the m + s.

We may have to say that such is their 'svabhava'.  'दृष्टानुरोधकल्पना'.

subbu
