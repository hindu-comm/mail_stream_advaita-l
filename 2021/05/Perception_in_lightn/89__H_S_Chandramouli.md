Namaste Sudhanshu Ji,

Reg  << Now once this दण्डायमान श्रोत्र वृत्ति is formed and mind and
shrotra are already there at vishaya desha, how will again it need to go
there >>

And

<< When there is indriya-vishay sanikarsha, the indriya does not leave it's
place in body.. it stretches out till vishaya.. otherwise there will be
निरिन्द्रियत्व आपत्ति of body >>,

दण्डायमान श्रोत्र वृत्ति is same as manOvritti issuing through the श्रोत्र
indriya. It stretches out till the location of vishaya. However there is a
continuous stream of such vrittis, each extending out the same way. Each
vritti covers one cognition. Hence there is  continuity in the cognitions.
Thus the condition considered by you

<< Considering that vishaya is same, vritti remains same. Mind+shrota of
both a and b are in vishaya desha. Yet, at 10.05.01, a has no auditory
perception but b will continue to have perception till 10.05.10 >>

does not arise.

Reg  << It cannot be argued that every moment new vritti is created >>,

As said above, continuous stream of vrittis is already in position. Each
new cognition is by way of the succeeding vritti.

I hope I have clarified my understanding.

Regards
Chandramouli
