Sudhanshu- PraNAms



As I see,your questions are appropriate and as a scientist I do endorse the point yourare making. Hence I took a different view in my notes on Vedanta Paribhashawhich disagrees with the traditional approach that I thinkis mostly based on meemamasaposition.


Hari Om!

 If we postulate that mind+shrotra reach subsequent to the mind+chakshu --
then by that time vishaya may no longer be there.

Two clouds collide, light is produced and sound is produced simultaneously.
By the time shrotra reaches there, there is no sound at vishaya desha. So
what will it perceive. And it is our experience that we perceive sound. And
also we reject शब्दान्तर उत्पत्ति due to गौरव दोष.

I think we need to delve into the meaning of shabda. It is the shabda which
is the vishaya of shrotra. Is shabda same as sound which requires a medium
to propagate. If we ring a school bell in outer space, we cannot hear
sound. But does it mean there is no shabda generated ?

Can shabda stay even when there is no audible sound.
