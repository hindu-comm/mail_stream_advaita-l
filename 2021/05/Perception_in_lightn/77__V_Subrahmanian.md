As far as I know, the situation in Advaita is: the shrotrendriya does not
go out but the sound reaches the indriya by a veechi-taranga-nyaya: The
sound, at the locus of its origin, produces waves and through the waves it
reaches the organ/indriya of the hearer.  In the case of chakshuh, as you
have stated, the indriya goes out through the manovritti and contacts the
object/form/color outside.  I am not aware if any other view is there in
Advaita for explaining the sound perception.
