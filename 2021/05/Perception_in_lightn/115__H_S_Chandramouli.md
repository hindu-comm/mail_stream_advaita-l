Namaste.

Reg  << I wanted a clarification. Is sound and shabda same? >>,

Shabda has two meanings. One is sound. This is what is perceived through
the ears and covered under pratyaksha pramANa.

Second meaning concerns knowledge generated by shabda or sound. This is
covered under shabda pramANa and not under pratyaksha pramANa.

Imagine two persons conversing at a distance. The listener is able to make
out that a conversation is going on by listening to the sounds or shabda,
but cannot make out the meaning as it is unclear. When the two come closer,
the listener is not only able to hear the sound or shabda, but can also
make out what is being discussed. In the former case, it is pratyaksha
pramANa while in the latter case, it is both pratyaksha as well as shabda
pramANa.

My understanding.

Chandramouli
