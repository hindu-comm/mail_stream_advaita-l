This video talks about various references from the Vedas, Upanishads,
Puranas where Shiva Naama (NAMAH SHIVAYA) is described as the Taaraka
Mantra (the one that relieves from the repeated cycles of birth and death)
and not Rama Naama. This is a series of lectures talking about how Rama was
a great devotee of Parama Shiva & Para Shakti.
