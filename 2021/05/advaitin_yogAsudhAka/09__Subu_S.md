 Namaste,
Sri Sadashiva Brahmendral was one of the greatest jivanmukta-s of recent times. YogasudhAkara, the commentary on the yoga sUtra-s of patanjali, integrates advaita teaching within the practices of yoga. Today being Sri Brahmendra's ArAdhana, the first chapter of yogasudhAkara, the samAdhi pAda is being read in this video.
