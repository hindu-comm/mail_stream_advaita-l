Dear friends,
What is Bhakti?

According to my understanding the true Bakti is as follows :

adhyAtmayOgAdhigamEnadEvaM 

matvA dhirOharShaSOkaU jahAti||

 so says mantra 1-2-12 of KathOpanishad.


(1) Sri Shankara says :
 (a) paramAtmA hisarveShAM naH AtmA

 (b) cEtasa AtmanisamAdhAnam adhyAtmayOgaH ||



(2) mayyEva mana Adhatsva || Bhagavadgita



(3) mayi buddhiM nivESaya || Bhagavadgita



and finally

 svasvarUpAnusaMdhAnamBaktirityaBidhIyatE ||

Won't you think that a student of Vedanta who wants to be anAtmavit

should have this frame of mind during his journey from 'nAnu' to 'tAnu'?
Is my understanding correct?I request the learned scholars to share their understanding.
With respectful namaskars,Sreenivasa Murthy
