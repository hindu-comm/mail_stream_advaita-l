Namaste,

Sri Sadashiva Brahmendral was one of the greatest jivanmukta-s of recent
times. YogasudhAkara, the commentary on the yoga sUtra-s of patanjali,
integrates advaita teaching within the practices of yoga. Today being Sri
Brahmendra's ArAdhana, the first chapter of yogasudhAkara, the samAdhi pAda
is being read in this video.
