Namaste,

One very valuable practical teaching in our texts is:
"internally a shAkta, externally a shaiva and in worldly interactions a vaiSNava"

- Internally, be devoted to adhyAtma vidyA = tattva jnAna = understanding of prakRti
- Externally, lead a disciplined life = integrate different practices of yoga in your life
- In wordily interactions, have a friendly, understanding, easy going personality

Shri Krishna is the bestest example that illustrates this teaching.

Regards,
Shrinivas Gadkari
