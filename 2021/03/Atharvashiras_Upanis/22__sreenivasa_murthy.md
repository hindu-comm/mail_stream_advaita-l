 Dear Sri Keshava Mahadeva,
You Write:"the Pashu i.e. Jivatma gets liberated and attains Para Kailasha to engage in the eternal service to Para Shakti & Parama Shiva."
The above statement is not in tune with the teachings of Upanishad Sages.What is the use of engaging in the eternal service to Para Shakti & Parama Shiva who are anAtma and Arta? 
With respectful namaskars, Sreenivasa Murthy

This video is a continuation of the previous lecture which describes the
story of Atharvashiras Upanishad. Thirteen beautiful names of Lord Shiva
appear in the Atharvashiras Upanishad. The names are described in detail,
why those names are specific to Lord Shiva and how by chanting those names
the Pashu i.e. Jivatma gets liberated and attains Para Kailasha to engage
in the eternal service to Para Shakti & Parama Shiva.
