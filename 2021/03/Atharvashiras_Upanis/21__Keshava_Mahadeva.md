This video is a continuation of the previous lecture which describes the
story of Atharvashiras Upanishad. Thirteen beautiful names of Lord Shiva
appear in the Atharvashiras Upanishad. The names are described in detail,
why those names are specific to Lord Shiva and how by chanting those names
the Pashu i.e. Jivatma gets liberated and attains Para Kailasha to engage
in the eternal service to Para Shakti & Parama Shiva.
