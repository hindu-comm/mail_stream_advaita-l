This video talks about the supporting facts (Upa Brahmanam) from the
Puranas, Smritis, Ithihaasaas describing Atharvashiras Upanishad to be an
Upanishad glorifying Lord Shiva only. Atharvashiras Upanishad is one of the
very important Upanishads talking about the Maha Paashupata Vratam which is
practiced by everybody including demigods like Brahma, Vishnu & Indra.
