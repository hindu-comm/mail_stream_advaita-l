SAdara praNAM,
Much has been published about the problem of Kanchi mutt.
While studying the problem what I came across is an
interesting fact that no body critically study the vast records
available at the Kanchi mutt except those who vouchsafe for the mutt.
A simple method is just to check the list of acharyas presided over
the various mutts. That itself is sufficient to set the problem for
one with common sense!
Namaste.
