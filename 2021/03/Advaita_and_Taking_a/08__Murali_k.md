Hi All

We had an interesting discussion on this list on Karma Yoga being a Kinder,
Gentler preparatory path. This made me ponder  few questions:

Is it hard to pursue a Spiritual path and still provide for a family. Will
following an advaita path necessarily entail a lack of motivation towards a
chosen vocation?

I do not see that to be case as I see list members here to be quitte good
at what they do.  Or Am I  seeing a false dichotomy between taking action
towards goals and following the teaching.

Thanks,
Murali
