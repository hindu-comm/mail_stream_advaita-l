There is no iron law that it has to be this way but in the end it is a 
question of priorities.  For myself, I am lucky that I am in the IT field 
and it is flexible enough that I have not had to make serious compromises 
to my beliefs but I have definitely lost some financial opportunities over 
the years by sticking to principles.

and there is no sin in seeking them as long as it is in accordance with
the guidelines of dharma.
