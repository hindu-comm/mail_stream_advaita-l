There is a huge misconception that this LINGODBHAVA Episode is present only
in Shiva, Linga & Skanda Puranas. But the Episode of Brahma & Vishnu
searching for the beginning and end of Lord Shiva is present in all the
Puranas. It is stated in this video with the proper references from the
Shastras. (This is Section 1 of the video).
