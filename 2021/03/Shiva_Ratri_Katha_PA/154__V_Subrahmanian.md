Thanks for sharing this talk which gives a number of references to the
Lingodbhava episode across various Puranas.  Long ago I had made an
observation, a mere guess, on a particular statement of the Atharva Shira
Upanishad's veiled reference to the Lingodbhava episode.  This speaker is
confirming that.

Here is a complete playlist of videos by that institution:
