This video talks about a direct reference about Linga Dhaaranam in the
Upanishads where the worshipper places the Shiva Linga in the left hand and
offers the worship with the right hand. The supporting facts for that in
the Puranas are also mentioned in this video. Linga Dharanam is described
as the highest level of spiritual initiation given by an authorized Guru
belonging to a proper Vaidika Shaiva Sampradaya. Linga Dhaaranam is
mentioned everywhere in the Vedas, Upanishads, Agamas, Smritis, Puranas,
Upa-Puranas & Ithihaasaas.
