This video talks about how the sages describe Lord Shiva alone as the
Supreme Reality, Eternal, Imperishable & Unchanging and all the other
demigods like Brahma, Vishnu & Indra are Jivatmas who keep changing. The
same is told in the Vedas & Upanishads. One can find references in this
video for that.
