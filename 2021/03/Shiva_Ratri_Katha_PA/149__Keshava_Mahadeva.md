This video talks about other references about Linga Dhaaranam in the
Smritis (Bharadvaaja, Paraashara, Manu, Bodhaayana, etc.) & Mahabharata. It
also provides the references from the scriptures where a woman can worship
the Shiva Linga. Linga Dharanam is described as the highest level of
spiritual initiation given by an authorized Guru belonging to a proper
Vaidika Shaiva Sampradaya. Linga Dhaaranam is mentioned everywhere in the
Vedas, Upanishads, Agamas, Smritis, Puranas, Upa-Puranas & Ithihaasaas.
