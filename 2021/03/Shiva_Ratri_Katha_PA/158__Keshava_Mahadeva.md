This video talks about how it is necessary for a soul to get initiated
under a proper Guru who belongs to an authorized Vaidika Shaiva Sampradaya
to attain the lotus feet of Para Shakti & Parama Shiva. Apart from Bhasma
Dharana, Tripundra Dharana & Rudraksha Dharana, Linga Dharanam is also
mentioned in the Shastras which is described as the highest level of
initiation and also Mahadeva himself says that a Linga Dhaari is considered
to be his greatest devotee. Linga Dhaaranam is mentioned everywhere in the
Vedas, Upanishads, Agamas, Smritis, Puranas, Upa-Puranas & Ithihaasaas. The
references for Linga Dhaaranam in the Shastras will be provided in the
upcoming vidoes.
