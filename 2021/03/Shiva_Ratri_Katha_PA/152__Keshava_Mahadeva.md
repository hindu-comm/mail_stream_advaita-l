This video talks about how Lord Shiva blesses Brahma and Vishnu after
crushing their EGO. The day when Mahadeva appeared as an Agni Sthamba is
called Shiva Ratri. Lord Shiva explains how one should worship him in the
Linga form and his divine spiritual form along with Para Shakti on the day
of Shiva Ratri. Mahadeva is described as Sushumna Naadi in every Jivatma's
body which is present in the Suta Samhita. One can know about that by
watching this video.
