Here is the Section 2 of the LINGODBHAVA Episode present in all the Puranas
with References. There is a huge misconception that this LINGODBHAVA
Episode is present only in Shiva, Linga & Skanda Puranas. But the Episode
of Brahma & Vishnu searching for the beginning and end of Lord Shiva is
present in all the Puranas. It is stated in this video with the proper
references from the Shastras. (This is Section 2 of the video).
