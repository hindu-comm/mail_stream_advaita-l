Thank you sharing that excellent article on Bhakti in advaita.

There was a reference 18 on page 20 by Sri Madhusudhana Saraswati "bhakti
is the state mind when....the mind takes the form of Ishvara and remains
uninterrupted."


But the reference list at the end of the article says its from the
Bhagavatam not Sri Madhusudana (Bhaktirasayana, maybe?).

Any idea about this verse?

Also noteworthy was Sri Madhusudana's reference to nidhidhyAsanam and
bhakti being both remaining relevant.

Om
Raghav
