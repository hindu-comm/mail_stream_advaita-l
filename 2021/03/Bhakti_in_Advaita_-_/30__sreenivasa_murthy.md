 Dear friends,
Bhakti in Advaita : The following 2lines shloka has beautifully defined the subject matter . It reads thus :
mokshasAdhanasAmagryAM BaktirEvagaiyasI |svasvarUpAnusaMdhAnam BaktirityaBidhIyatE ||
Now, what has to be done? It is simple.Cognize / discover your svasvarUpa (i.e. your true nature) within 
yourself by yourself.Then the wholething is over.

Let the mind be absorbed there.This is what gItAcArya says.
With respectful namaskars,Sreenivasa Murthy.
