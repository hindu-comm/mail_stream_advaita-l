Namaste,

Perfecting action, and deriving joy from skillful execution of action is also yoga.
(yoga karmasu kaushlam - Gita 2.50)
This type of yoga is found in abundance today. And probably, the single most
factor responsible for material wellbeing in the world today.

However, this is only part of the story. Involving the divine and offering the joy from
skillful execution of action to the divine is other part of the story (Ishvara praNidhAna).
Then karma yoga naturally leads to bhakti.

Regards,
Shrinivas Gadkari
