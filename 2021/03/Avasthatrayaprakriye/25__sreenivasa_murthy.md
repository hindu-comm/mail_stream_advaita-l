Dear friends,
According to Shankara, the wholestate including

macrocosm and microcasm shouldbe taken as an
adjunct ( adjunct is that which comes andgoes, in other words, 
AgamApAyI or adventious) to one's own true nature ofbeing.
The art of this taking a standin one's own being

which is the substratum of theappearance and

disappearance of the dualisticstate should be

known through the teachings ofShastra and Guru

only. 

If once an aspirant has recognised this, he

will lose his identification withhis individuality

and he remains directly asturIya i. e., non-dual

Brahman. 

This is the speciality of this 
tribasic method of life. *




With respectful namaskars,Sreenivasa Murthywho has been named as an asampradayi.
