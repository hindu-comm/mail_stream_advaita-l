Pranams,

I was listening to a very fascinating talk between Naval & Kapil Gupta (
https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/naval/Kapil_Gupta.mp3 ).

People often ask, "How to attain Moksha ?" and follow certain prescriptions
in order to attain it, but often the Truth is that this motivation is to
follow the prescription instead of attaining Moksha itself.

The Mind creates distance between the seeker & sought with a "How"
question.

It's easy to keep Moksha as a side quest & indulging in the samsara blaming
one's prarabdha.

1. Can learning scriptures be actually an impediment to Moksha as it
becomes fodder to one's own procrastination?

2. Is it necessary to have an external knowledge source outside oneself to
get liberated?

3. Can one develop enough Jijnasa to attains Moksha instantly?

*Om,*
Mahadevan Iyer.
