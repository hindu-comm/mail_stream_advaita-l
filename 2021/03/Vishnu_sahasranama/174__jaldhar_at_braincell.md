We have covered many of the advanced ideas of Advaita Vedanta recently but 
that doesn't mean other aspects of Shankaracharyas teachings are not 
important.  Since you have drunk from the amrita of Vishnusahasranama 
could you write about e.g. some of the names that have made a memorable 
impression on you?  (Or any other topic realated to smarta/advaita 
subjects you like of course.)
