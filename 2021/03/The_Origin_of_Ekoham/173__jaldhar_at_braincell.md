That's not what mahavakya means.  By definition it is a statement (vakya) 
from a shastra not a summary or epigram etc.

There are two principal theories on how the world-appearance arose.  The 
vivArtavAda states that it is due to a distortion of Brahman through the 
lense of mAyA.  The PariNAmavAda states that Brahman directly wields mAyA 
as a creative force that results in the world appearance.  Both theories 
can find support in shAstra and Vedantic tradition but the latter is more 
associated with theistic varieties of Hinduism and with e.g. saMkhyA/yoga. 
It makes sense that Swami Shivananda who taught a very Vedantized Yoga (or 
Yoga-ized Vedanta if you will) would favor formulations like eko'ham 
bahusyAm that suggest pariNAmavAda.
