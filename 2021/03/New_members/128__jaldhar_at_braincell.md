Venkat
------

I have been interested in Advaita, since first coming across
Ramanamaharishi, Nisargadatta and J Krishnamurti in my teens.  I have read
extensively their works, as well as Ch’an, Dzogchen and Tao.  Over the last
10 years, I have tried to systematically read Bhagavad Gita, Upanishads and
BrahmaSutra, and Sankara’s bhasyas thereon, as well as Suresvara.


Cameron D. McIntosh
-------------------

I’ve been a spiritual student for 45 years, with my first two teachers having 
been Indian Vedantins (my present teacher is a Sufi). I’ve lived in two 
ashrams in India for six months each, and was a resident at my second 
teacher’s principal ashram in the United States for seven years. Most of my 
exposure to Vedantic scripture has been through reciting it, and I am neither 
an expert on the philosophy nor an expert in Sanskrit grammar (though I can 
read Devanagari to some degree). I’m finding the phrase “ekoham bahusyam” to 
be increasingly interesting, and would like to explore it further.
