 //The book is an attempt to chronicle in lucid language the life of a
great modern sage. Swami Chinmayananda's life was indeed a saga of
extraordinary spiritual strength, love, tireless service and metaphysical
reach.When he began the mission, the world's oldest scriptures were taught
only in exclusive pockets, shrouded in orthodoxy.

Swami Chinmayananda interpreted and opened up this perennial philosophy for
millions of people. His was a life which in less than fifty years he left
behind the legacy of a global organisation, hundreds of institutions and
millions of followers devoted to a single aim, the perpetuity of nobility
in Man.//
