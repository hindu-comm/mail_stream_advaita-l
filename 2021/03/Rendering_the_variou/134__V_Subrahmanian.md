The above is about Purva Mimamsa and Sankhya rendered in extremely simple
terms in Telugu so that the non-scholarly too can appreciate the topic.
One will greatly benefit in listening to the rest of the talks in the
series.  The Sankhya system rendered by Vidwan Kuppa Viswanatha Sastry is a
marvel.  He has rendered this topic in Sanskrit and Kannada too in other
forums.
