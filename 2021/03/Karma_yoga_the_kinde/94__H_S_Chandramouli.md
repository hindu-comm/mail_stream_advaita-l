Namaste Sudhanshu Ji,

The Svetaketu mentioned here is described as a great karmakAndin also apart
from other accomplishments. It is quite possible that the person referred
to is not the same as the Upanishadic personality. Just a guess only of
course.

Also this particular chapter is missing in the publication of Sacred
Texts-Hinduism while most of the other chapters are covered. So this could
be a later interpolation as well in the text covered in the link sent by
you.

Beyond this can only say no comments.

Regards
