I think the key is not the shastras themselves but your attitude towards 
them.  If you think theyjust give a checklist of items that must be marked 
"done" or legalistic procedures it is not going to make you very 
enthusiastic.  But if...now I'm going to have to very careful about how I 
phrase this :-)  My wife has some ideas about things that need to be done 
around the house whereas I disagree about the urgency or even rationality 
of doing thembut I do them anyway because someone I love will be happy I 
did them and that will make me happy.
