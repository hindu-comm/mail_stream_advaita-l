Ok, then that one doesn't act whose mind is fixed on jnana. He is said to
be acting only from the standpoint of ajnanis, but that is not the actual
state of affairs.

Nope, not at all. In his commentary on the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad 4.4.23,
Shankara says of Janaka, most certainly not a a sannyasi:

"Such a man becomes in this state a Brahmana (lit. a knower of Brahman) in
the primary sense of the word. *This* identity with the Self of all *is the
world of Brahman*, the world that is Brahman, in a real, not figurative,
sense, *O Emperor, and you have attained it*, this world of Brahman, which
is fearless, and is described as 'Not this, not this'-- *said Yajnavalkya*.
...
The topic of the knowledge of Brahman is finished, together with its
offshoots and procedure as well as renunciation. The highest end of man is
also completely dealt with. This much is to be attained by a man, this is
the culmination, this is the supreme goal, this is the highest good.
Attaining this one achieves all that has to be achieved and becomes a
knower of Brahman. This is the teaching of the entire Vedas."

It is precisely to combat this misunderstanding that the Gita was written.

"He who perceives inaction in action, and action in inaction, is wise among
men; he is a yogi and performs all actions." (4:18)

"The work of one who is free from attachment, who is liberated, whose
thought is established in knowledge, who does work only as a sacrifice, is
wholly dissolved." (4:23)

The idea of literal sannyasa as superior is contrary to the message of the
Gita. Renunciation does *not* mean physical sannyasa. Physical sannyasa is
compatible with true renunciation but is not required.

That's certainly not what Ramana believed. And it is not what the Bhagavad
Gita teaches.

The question is what their nature is, and what is futile to fight?
Presumably the fact that they keep smoking means that it is their nature --
since that is in fact what they do -- and the attempt to fight it is silly.
Is that what you mean?

This is a total misunderstanding of the Gita, again, per the above. It is
the mental state and not the fact of physical action that determines
whether there is some kind of binding action happening.

"Content with whatever comes to him, transcending the dualities, free from
envy, constant in mind whether in success or in failure, even though he
acts, he is not bound." (4:22)

Huh? The mind is roiled by emotion. When it is roiled, effort brings it
back. The roiling is what requires the effort. The effort *eventually*,
over time, reduces the emotion. It doesn't happen all at once.

The only real renunciation of action is jnana. Not physical sannyasa.

Stithaprajnas are most certainly jnanis. In the very first shloka
describing them, Bhagavan says:

"When he leaves behind all desires emerging from the mind, Arjuna, and is
content in the Sel fb yht eSelf, then he he is said to be one whose wisdom
is steady."

It's literally the definition of a jnani.

Again, true sannyasa, as the Gita shows, is not the physical sannyasa.
