Dear H S Chandramouli

I appreciate your point on differing emphases on sruti.

However, with respect to Brhad Up 3.5.1, I don’t really see the Baalya and Mouna that is discussed as particularly different from the essence of Ramana’s atma vichara.

In “The essential Adi Shankara” by Sri Satchidanandendra Saraswati Swamiji, he writes the following comments on BU3.5.1:

As regards the statement in the Brihadaaranyaka Upanishad, the word ‘Paanditya‘ means – “After completing without any remainder Aatma Viljnaana from both the spiritual preceptor (Guru) and the Aagama (the traditional methodology of teaching that is implicit in the Upanishadic texts), eventually one should practise Sarva Karma Sannyaasa (renunciation of all karmas entirely)”

The word ‘Baalya‘ means – “Having acquired or being fully equipped with Jnaana Bala (the spiritual strength gained from Jnaana), the true aspirant should be rejecting disdainfully ‘Anaatma Pratyaya’ (any perceptual or conceptual knowledge of the not-seIf)”

The word ‘Mouna‘ means – “Getting fully established or rooted in Intuition (Anubhava) of the Self which is the natural fruit of Anaatma Pratyaya Tiraskarana (total rejection with disdain the perceptual or conceptual knowledge of the not-self).”

In truth, the purport of the Shruti statement is – “Only if the seeker attains this Mouna, he can be said to have become a Brahma Nishtha (the one established or rooted in Intuitive experience of the Self, a genuine, consummate Jnaani par excellence).”

Best wishes
