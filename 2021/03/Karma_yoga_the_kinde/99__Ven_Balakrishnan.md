Hi Akilesh,

Two points:

1.  If SINCERE mental renunciation has happened, then discussion about physical renunciation is a moot point.  The likelihood is that with mental desirelessness and renunciation, everything else falls away, unless, as Bhagan says, one unfortunate prarabdha dictates otherwise.  I’m always bemused by people implying that mental renunciation is different from physical - unless one is trying to convince oneself that 'I have mentally renounced and have gained knowledge, and so I can still hang on to my desires / possessions, because I have renounced (really!)’.  Seems like self-deception to me, but that is for each to work out.

2.  The constellation of stars around Ramanamaharishi, were all renunciates - European and Indian alike.  The only exception I can think of is Osborne, who lived an austere life with his family in Tiruvanamallai.

For avoidance of doubt, I fully agree that mental renunciation is the real import of Bhagavan’s teaching, but physical would be an inevitable consequence for most.  Physical without mental is pointless; mental without physical may be theoretically feasible but if one if being honest.  That seems to me to be the gist of GVK’s verses.
