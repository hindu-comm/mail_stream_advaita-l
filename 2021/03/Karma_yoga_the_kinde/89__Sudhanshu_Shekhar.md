Thank you Chandramouli ji. I went through Jivanmukti Viveka for the first
time after your comments. It cleared my misunderatanding.

One question though. May seem like a bit too much but please allow the
indulgence. In Jivanmukti Viveka, reference is made to Jabalopanishat
(तथान्यस्यां कण्डिकायाम् 'तत्र परमहंसा नाम' इत्युपक्रम्य
संवर्तकादीन्बहून्ब्रह्मविदो जीवन्मुक्तानुदाहृत्य...). Jabala Upanishad in
the relevant mantra names Samvartaka, Aruni, Shvetaketu, Durvasa, Ribhu,
Jada Bharata etc. Then I checked Moksha Dharma parva of Mahabharata,
chapter 220 of Shanti Parva, where discussion is made about Shvetaketu in a
particular context. The context is regarding attainment of Supreme in
grihasthashram. Shvetaketu is elaborated upon there as a person who never
did physical renunciation.

As per our understanding, since Shvetaketu never had physical sanyasa, he
cannot be jivanmukta. Being a grihastha, his jivanmukta-tva should be
impossible. But Jabala Upanishad read with JMV treats him as JM.

How should we understand this.

Regards,
Sudhanshu.
