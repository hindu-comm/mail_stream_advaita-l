As an aside, note the remarkable and beautiful expression of ideas between Ramana and Brhad Upanishad

Ramana, GVK1141a: In the same way that a leaf plate is thrown away after eating food , the jnani who has know his Self will discard his body.

Brhad Up 4.4.7: Regarding this there is this verse: ‘When all the desires that dwell in his heart (mind) are gone, then he, having been mortal, becomes immortal, and attains Brahman in this very body.’ Just as the lifeless slough of a snake is cast off and lies in the ant-hill, so does this body lie. Then the self becomes disembodied and immortal, (becomes) the Prajna (Supreme Self), Brahman, the Light.

In his perception which is one of sole and solid awareness, there are no objects worthy of being desired . . . The difference between the states of a jnani and an ajnani is due to the presence or absence of the ego-sense . .  For a jnani who is egoless differences never manifest themselves . . . The state a jivanmukta abides in ever and anon is egoless and without a mind. How can one with mind conceive or comprehend that state?”
