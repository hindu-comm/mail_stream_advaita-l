 The swimming pool in your analogy is karma not karmayoga.

Dharmic acts and Bhakti can also be viewed in terms of the three gunas.

The Tamasic view is if I don't act something terrible will happen to me
(go to Hell etc.)

The Rajasic view is if I do right actions, I will prosper (gain wealth,
siddhis etc.)

The Sattvic view is to act purely out of Prem for Bhagavan and a sense of
duty.

The first two are karma and as long as karma is in accordance with shruti,
smrti, and shistachara it is good but it will not lead to freedom from
samsara. Only the third type is karmayoga.

If one is unable to do karmayoga because they are beset by fear and
ignorance then they should work on that first. Following the appropriate
dictates of shastras will help there.

How to work on that, ie, do acts as karma yoga ? What specific way to shastras help with that ?

Yes, karma as you define it is easier still than karma yoga. But that does
not mean that karma yoga is not one step easier than self-inquiry or
surrender. Karma yoga still involves decision based on duty. But dharma is
not relevant to one whose mind is fixed on jnana.

The idea that "I will decide what is dharmic and do that in an unattached
way" is, while mentally purifying, accepting rather than challenging the
notion that I am the doer.

Duty as a concept is still basically karmic, is still basically founded on
the dictates of doership. One who is attached to duty still has a sattvic
attachment... which must be eliminated before atma jnana can be attained.
Duty is mithya and bondage, ultimately.

This is misunderstanding the meaning of challenging the illusion of
doership. Challenging that illusion does not involve repeating mechanically
"I am not the doer." It involves turning the mind away from the changing
manifestations at all times and abandoning the worry about what is done or
not done.

As Sankara says in Upadeshasahri verse 210: "For knowing oneself to be
Brahman one has no duty to perform; nor can one be a knower of Brahman when
one has duties to perform. One deceives oneself by having recourse to both
sides."

Or see what Gaudapada says in his Mandukya Karika (in the Advaita
Prakarana): "[R]emembering that everything is the Unborn Reality, one does
not certainly see the born [i.e. duality]."

Or see the BG in chapter 2: "And when he withdraws completely the senses
from the objects of the senses, as a tortoise withdraws its limbs into its
shell, his wisdom stands firm."

Without duty, without seeing duality, and without seeing the objects of the
senses, there is no question of deciding what to do in accordance with
dharma -- whether one renounces the fruit or not.

The attempt to live like *that* -- that is self-inquiry and surrender, that
goes beyond karma yoga.

No, the idea of choice is itself merely a kind of theater. The ultimate
outcome is quite determined by the gunas. This is explicit at the end of
the Gita: "What you wish not to do, through delusion, you shall do that
against your will, Arjuna, bound by your own karma, born of your own
material nature. The Lord abides in the hearts of all beings, Arjuna,
causing all beings to revolve, by the power of illusion, as if fixed on a
machine."

No, it is going to help you. The effort at karma yoga will *result* in
mental purification, even if your mind is roiled by emotion.

Arjuna says: "The mind, indeed, is unstable, Krishna, turbulent, powerful
and obstinate; I think it is as difficult to control as the wind." (6:34)

Bhagavan replies "Without doubt, O Arjuna, the mind is unsteady and
difficult to restrain, but by practice, Arjuna, and by indifference to
worldly objects, it is restrained." (6:35)

Bhagavan goes on to say that if necessary, perfection in the practice of
yoga will calm the mind over the course of many lifetimes.

Who has reached that stage *by means of *karma yoga... that does not mean
that he is any longer using that means. He is no longer practicing. He is
released from practice, from effort, from all types of yogas, because he
knows who he is. Otherwise jnana yoga could not also lead to that result.

Karma yoga is clearly preliminary.

"For the sage desirous of attaining [karma] yoga, action is said to be the
means; for him who has already attained yoga, tranquility is said to be the
means." (BG 6:3)

So the one who lacks tranquility practices dutiful action while renouncing
the fruit... at the end of which there is mental purification. But that is
not the end of the story!

This is why Krishna says earlier: "No purifier equal to knowledge is found
here in the world; he who is himself perfected in yoga *in time* finds that
knowledge in the Self." Even one who is perfected in karma yoga, lacking
knowledge, is not complete. That knowledge will challenge the idea that he
is acting at all. To understand that knowledge requires a relentless
inward-turning of the mind without regard to action and without regard to
duty... the body and the mind will anyway act of their own accord, but the
spiritual aspirant will to the best of his or her abilities ignore their
workings.

After the aspirant after wisdom has a sufficiently still mind, through
karma yoga if necessary, then, "Little by little, he should come to rest,
with the intellect firmly held. His mind having been established in the
Self, he should not think of anything." (BG 6:25)
