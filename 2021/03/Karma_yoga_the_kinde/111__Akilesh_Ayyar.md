Well, what would be a bit more accurate than either 5a or 5b, would be to
say that the world appearance, which cannot be said to have ever begun,
cannot therefore be said to either to end or to continue. Jnana is
precisely this going beyond those categories. That leaves us with ajata, to
which all the verses that you cite are really referring.
