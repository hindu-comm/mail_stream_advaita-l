Dear Chandramouli

On baalya and mouna, it is an interesting point you raise . . . both SSSS in his comments on BU3.5.1 and Swami Gambhirananda in his notes to his translation of BrahmaSutraBhasya, equate baalya to manana and mouna to nididhyasana; ie saying that you get scholarly knowledge from the sruti and guru, and then have to apply it (“live on the strength of that knowledge”).  Consequently your distinction of before / after Jnana for Ramana vs Sankara does not seem to apply.

Whilst sruti does teach a lot more, it ulitmately is sublated.  Sruti also says that Brahman cannot be defined; so not quite how you you can say that they declare what IS.  Indeed what sruti conveys is to REMOVE ignorance - the erroneous superimposition; not to add a new conceptual knowledge.

Hence why Sankara can write very unambiguously "“therefore the knowledge of this Self, by the process of neti, neti and the renunciation of everything are the only means of attaining immortality”.

Best wishes

Sri Maharshi, according to you, prescribes the above mentioned procedure for Realization. That is not accepted in the Sidhanta advanced by Sri Bhagavtpada. I may also mention here that many of the Maharshis I had mentioned earlier also accept the first part but end up with different conclusions in the followup part.

There is a logic to why neti, neti and renunciation go together.

Scriptures bring a person who is caught in the ignorance to understand step by step - from creation to non-creation -  ’neti, neti’, the best that words can do to describe Brahman.  Ramana is saying that that neti, neti has then to be applied, each time a desire, a fear, an egoistic thought arises; until that I-thought no longer arises.  That is abidance in the Self, mouna.
