As Ramana mentions in several places, physical sannyasa is also a set of
vasanas. Self-deception is equally possible in any ashrama as respects
jnana.

If that were the case, it's surprising, again, that there is *no* mention
of physical renunciation at all in Self-Enquiry, Who Am I, Forty Verses and
Supplement, or Upadesa Saram, and that it contradicts all the recorded
statements of Maharshi's to seekers on the question. Maharshi's position is
that sannyasa is a good thing for those who are suited to it, if that is
the way one's karma is oriented, but it is far from necessary for the
seeker.

Again, in another dialogue recorded in Upadesa Manjari, Maharshi says:

*22. Is asceticism (sannyasa) one of the essential requisites for a person
to become established in the Self (atmanishta)?*

*The effort that is made to get rid of attachment to one’s body is really
towards abiding in the Self. Maturity of thought and enquiry alone removes
attachment to the body, not the stations of life (ashramas), such as
student (brahmachari), etc. For the attachment is in the mind while the
stations pertain to the body. How can bodily stations remove the attachment
in the mind? As maturity of thought and enquiry pertain to the mind, these
alone can, by enquiry on the part of the same mind, remove the attachments
which have crept into it through thoughtlessness. But, as the discipline of
asceticism (sannyasashrama) is the means for attaining dispassion
(vairagya), and as dispassion is the means for enquiry, joining an order of
ascetics may be regarded, in a way, as a means of enquiry through
dispassion. Instead of wasting one’s life by entering the order of ascetics
before one is fit for it, it is better to live the householder’s life. In
order to fix the mind in the Self which is its true nature it is necessary
to separate it from the family of fancies (sankalpas) and doubts
(vikalpas), that is to renounce the family (samsara) in the mind. This is
real asceticism.*

*23. It is an established rule that so long as there is the least idea of
‘I-am-the-doer,’ Self-knowledge cannot be attained, but is it possible for
an aspirant who is a householder to discharge his duties properly without
this sense?*

*As there is no rule that action should depend upon a sense of being the
doer it is unnecessary to doubt whether any action will take place without
a doer or an act of doing. Although the officer of a government treasury
may appear, in the eyes of others, to be doing his duty attentively and
responsibly all day long, he will be discharging his duties without
attachment, thinking ‘I have no real connection with all this money’ and
without a sense of involvement in his mind. In the same manner a wise
householder may also discharge without attachment the various household
duties which fall to his lot according to his past karma, like a tool in
the hands of another. Action and knowledge are not obstacles to each other.*

Here he acknowledges that sannyasa can be a useful tool for those who are
fit for it, but again, it is not necessary -- nor even recommended except
for those whose nature and karma is bent in that way. Action & knowledge
are not opposed.
