Dear Venkat,

I am sorry. I should have given the translation as well. Roughly the first
one would mean  << What is created is what is perceived. Or Creation and
Perception are coterminous >> while the second one means  << Perception
alone is Creation . In other words there are no two entities  >>.

When you say << Therefore know that scrutinising ‘what is this ego?” Is
alone giving up everything>>, does the Maharshi say anywhere how this
analysis is to be done. In its absence it essentially means each one to
himself and there could be any number of conclusions. I had earlier listed
Mahashis who came to different conclusions on the same topic.

This is practically confirmed by what you have said subsequently

<< Bhagavan's self-enquiry is not strictly a method or practice, which is
why he doesn’t give detailed procedures.  It is best laid out I think in
his essay Nan Yar? (who am I) - which I recommend.  His advice is to turn
attention away from external objects, and rather to attend to the ‘I’ that
sees and thinks.  Every thought, every sense perception, every desire /
fear, is not true, not real.  So he says to investigate the originator of
the thought - and see if there is anything firm that can be grasped hold of
as I.  In this process, which is essentially the vedantic application of
knowledge neti neti, one discards all attachments, including the body-mind
as not “I”, until all that is left is existence-consciousness - in which
one abides.  So in one of his talks he said:

"If you withdraw your mind completely from the world and turn it within and
abide thus, that is, if you keep awake always to the Self, which is the
Substratum of all experience, you will find the world, of which alone you
are now aware, just as unreal as the world in which you lived in your dream
 >>.

Anyway thanks for your response.
Regards
