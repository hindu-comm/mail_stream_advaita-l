Some things really are black and white despite attempts to obfuscate them.

The swimming pool in your analogy is karma not karmayoga.

Dharmic acts and Bhakti can also be viewed in terms of the three gunas.

The Tamasic view is if I don't act something terrible will happen to me 
(go to Hell etc.)

The Rajasic view is if I do right actions, I will prosper (gain wealth, 
siddhis etc.)

The Sattvic view is to act purely out of Prem for Bhagavan and a sense of 
duty.

The first two are karma and as long as karma is in accordance with shruti, 
smrti, and shistachara it is good but it will not lead to freedom from 
samsara.  Only the third type is karmayoga.

If one is unable to do karmayoga because they are beset by fear and 
ignorance then they should work on that first.  Following the appropriate 
dictates of shastras will help there.

The only way to to not do things is to physically not do things i.e. 
sannyasa.  No amount of saying "I am not the doer" will help if you are in 
fact doing things.  For people like Arjuna, sannyasa was not a viable 
option at that time so karmayoga is the next best thing.

Not sure what you're getting at here.  Arjunas duty to fight was due to 
his birth in a Kshatriya family.  And he certainly had the choice to be a 
coward.  He was convinced to fight by Bhagavan Himself (who is 
naistrigunya) in the guise of his childhood friend and sarathi.

You are confusing "is" and "ought"  Krishna Bhagvan is saying it is ego 
which is making him act cowardly even though he really does want to fight 
and will end up doing so anyway.  So he ought to go with his instincts 
rather than try and surpress them.  But of course he has a choice.  This 
shloka depicts an argument about good choices versus bad choices not 
choice versus no choice.

Yes but the way you put it is " no matter what happens, good or bad, you 
are not going to be emotionally affected."  If you're mind is already 
roiled by emotion, karmayoga isn't going to help you become constant in 
mind.  But if you are a karmayogi, your mind as a consequence will not 
roiled by emotion.  If that's actually what you meant and I misunderstood 
you, it just goes to show the importance of precision in language.

In 2.54 Arjuna asks Krishna Bhagavan what are the characteristics of a 
sthitaprajna.  Shankaracharya observes:

यो ह्यादित एव संन्यस्य कर्माणि ज्ञानयोगनिष्ठायां प्रवृत्तः, यश्च कर्मयोगेन, तयोः 
‘प्रजहाति’ इत्यारभ्य आ अध्यायपरिसमाप्तेः स्थितप्रज्ञलक्षणं साधनं चोपदिश्यते ।

"To him who has renounced action by means of establishment in jnanayoga 
and to he who has reached that stage by means of karmayoga to both are 
explained from "prajahati..." (2.55) to the end of the adhyaya, the 
hallmarks of the sthitaprajna and the means for attaining that state."

One leads to continued rebirth in samsara and the other leads to 
liberation from it.  That's a pretty huge difference.

Ok but may I point out that nothing in that has anything to do with 
"control" nor does it establish that karmayoga is "easier" or "softer".
