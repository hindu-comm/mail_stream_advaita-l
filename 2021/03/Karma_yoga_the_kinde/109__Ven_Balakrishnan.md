OK, and I guess that is why logic would push one to 5a.  However do note the following from Bhagavan:


Ulladu Narpadu:

31: When It surges forth and appears for him (the jnani) who enjoys the bliss of Self, which has risen by destroying the individual self (the ego), what single thing exists to do? He does not know anything other than Self; how to conceive what His state is?

Lakshmana Sarma who received personal verse by verse instruction on UN, and whose notes were checked by Bhagavan wrote of this:

“A jivanmukta is a native of the ego-less state and therefore mind-free. His mind has been dissolved in the Self and has become one with Brahman . . . In his perception which is one of sole and solid awareness, there are no objects worthy of being desired . . . The difference between the states of a jnani and an ajnani is due to the presence or absence of the ego-sense . .  For a jnani who is egoless differences never manifest themselves . . . The state a jivanmukta abides in ever and anon is egoless and without a mind. How can one with mind conceive or comprehend that state?”


Guru Vachaka Kovai:

1131: Since agitation [or confusion] will never rise without the feeling ‘I am the body’ [ the ego] in the heart, one whose vasanas - the ego or mind - are dead will not be mentally agitated even in dream

Muruganar’s comment: "the implication is that the life of mauna in which the mind is dead is alone truly living as a human being."	

Bhagavan himself wrote a verse in this section of GVK:

1141a: In the same way that a leaf plate is thrown away after eating food , the jnani who has know his Self will discard his body.


Nan Yar

10: Even though visaya-vasanas [inclination to experience things other than one-self], which come from time immemorial rise as thoughts in countless numbers like ocean waves, they will all be destroyed when self-attentiveness increases.

20: If oneself [ego or mind] rises, everything rises; if oneself subsides everything subsides.  To whatever extent being subsided [or humble] we behave, to that extent there is goodness. If we are restraining mind, wherever we may be, we can be.



Best wishes,
venkat
