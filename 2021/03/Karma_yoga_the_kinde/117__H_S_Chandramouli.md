Dear Venkat,

Reg  << I think we are in agreement? >>,

Oh no. Far from it. I am sorry if I have conveyed such an impression though
I do not still see how.

Reg  << Ramanamaharishi taught that by being constantly aware of thoughts
as they arise, they attenuate - thereby leaving the ‘I’-thought, which,
with nothing to cling to, subsides.
Isn’t that in essence what Sankaracharya’s commentary to Brhad Up 3.5.1
means >>,

No. The quote from BU 3.5.1 above is in the context of the need for
shravana,manana,nididhyasana terming them compulsory for Realization.
Whereas according to you Sri Maharshi  proposes a method  which does away
with the need for any recourse to Shrutis for Realization. That is not
admitted in the Advaita Sidhanta as advanced by Sri Bhagavatpada.

Same is the case with the other citations in your post.

I have not discussed them in detail as it would take us away from the topic
under discussion. There is no difference in the final conclusion as to what
constitutes Realization as between Sri Bhagavatpada and Sri Maharshi. The
difference we are discussing concerns the means for such Realization. This
is how I have understood. The difference as I understood has been explained
above.
Regards
