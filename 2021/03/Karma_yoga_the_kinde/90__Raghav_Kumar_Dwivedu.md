Namaste Sudhanshu ji
Apologies for intersecting.
The quote below maybe relevant.

"ज्ञानमात्रे यद्यपि सर्वाश्रमिणामधिकारः, तथापि संन्यासनिष्ठैव ब्रह्मविद्या
मोक्षसाधनं न कर्मसहितेति ‘भैक्षचर्यां चरन्तः’ (मु. उ. १ । २ । ११)
‘संन्यासयोगात्’ (मु. उ. ३ । २ । ६) इति च ब्रुवन्दर्शयति ।
विद्याकर्मविरोधाच्च । न हि ब्रह्मात्मैकत्वदर्शनेन सह कर्म स्वप्नेऽपि
सम्पादयितुं शक्यम् ; विद्यायाः कालविशेषाभावादनियतनिमित्तत्वाच्च
कालसङ्कोचानुपपत्तेः ।

*यत्तु गृहस्थेषु ब्रह्मविद्यासम्प्रदायकर्तृत्वादि लिङ्गं न तत्स्थितं न्यायं
बाधितुमुत्सहते ; *

न हि विधिशतेनापि तमःप्रकाशयोरेकत्र सद्भावः शक्यते कर्तुम् , किमुत लिङ्गैः
केवलैरिति ।"*Paraphrased - This [Mundaka] Upanisad shows that though people
in all stages of life have a right to Knowledge as such, still the **Knowledge
of Brahman, founded on samnyAsa only** and not as associated with karma, is
the means for emancipation. "***Living upon alms***", " Through adopting
sannyAsa" as the Upanishad says. And this follows from the opposition
between knowledge and karma . . . As for the indirect indications
(suggesting that knowledge and karma can co-exist), to wit, *

*the fact that among the householders are found some with whom started the
traditional lines of the knowers of Brahman that cannot override the
established rule.  *

*For when the co-existence of light and darkness cannot be brought about
even by a hundred injunctions, much less can it be done so by mere
indications.*"
