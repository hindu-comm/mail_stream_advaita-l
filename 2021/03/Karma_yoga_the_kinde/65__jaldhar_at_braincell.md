Fear or lassitude is the hallmark of a tamasic outlook.  One with those 
attitudes will fail at karmayoga just as easily as any other kind of yoga.

It most certainly does.  The difference between karma and karmayoga is the 
latter is done solely as duty and as a sacrifice to Bhagavan.

"what you need to do" is an unecessarily vague  way to put it.  Consider 
Arjuna.  He  did not "need to" fight at all.  He could have relinquished 
the kingdom to the Kauravas and been done with it.  He has to fight 
because it is his _duty_ to fight and that duty is determined by his 
Kshatriya descent not his individual preferences.   And "not going to be 
emotionally affected" is new age therapy speak.  A sthitaprajna is one who 
has the fortitude to withstand the _consequences_ of karma.  Because karma 
always has consequences even if commanded by Sakshat Narayayana Himself. 
In the Mahabharata it is pointed out that Arjuna and his brothers spent 
some time in naraka as a result of the himsa and other adharma they had 
committed in there lifetimes.  The karmayogi accepts the consequences and 
is indifferent to svarga and naraka and that is what purifies his mind and 
prepares him for jnana (which is the only escape from the consequences of 
karma.)
