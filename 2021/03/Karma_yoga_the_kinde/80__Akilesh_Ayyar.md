No we can't. If people exist, people act. "Indeed, no one, even in the
twinkling of an eye, ever exists without performing action; Everyone is
forced to perform action, even actio which is against his will, by the
qualities which originate in material nature." (BG 3:5)

The whole point of the BG is that real action is not defined by its outer
manifestations.

Hrm. Rama re-incarnates as Krishna, who gets the arrow in his foot because
of Rama's deceit. Does this mean Vishnu has not attained liberation from
samsara? This is a profound misunderstanding of the meaning of liberation
from samsara.

The end of rebirth is not a literal end to rebirth, but the comprehension
that there is no birth in the first place.

Inseparable is not the same as necessary for the realization. Janaka was
NOT a physical sannyasi and THEN he became a knower of Brahman and THEN he
offers the kingdom.

Which offer, by the way, we do not if it was accepted.

What we do know is what Bhagavan says in the Gita of Janaka:

"Perfection was attained by kings like Janaka With action alone." (3:20)

Again, that merely begs the question of what a sannyasi really is. You
claim it is only physical renunciation. Bhagavan claims it is mental
renunciation of the fruit of action even while performing one's duty and is
*not* defined merely by giving up action (BG 6:1).

Thanks for the history lesson, but the interpretation makes no sense. Two
slokas later Bhagavan explains further: "He who has abandoned all
attachment to the fruits of action, always content, not dependent, even
when performing action, does, in effect, nothing at all." It really
couldn't be any clearer.

It does. I've already pointed out the verse two slokas before that.
"Performing action with the body alone, without wish, restrained in
thought and self, with all motives of acquisition abandoned, he incurs no
evil." (4:21)

This is clearly not prarabhdha but new actions. What determines the evil
incurred is clearly the mental attitude.

Your nature is not what's "good" for you. Your nature is what you actually
do.

The gunas compel action and set desire. If people smoke, it IS because
that's their nature. If and when they stop, that too is because that is in
comport with their nature.

That doesn't respond to the text I clearly quoted. Arjuna's mind IS roiled
by emotion to the extent that he drops his weapons on the battlefield. In
response Krishna urges karma yoga AS a purifier. It couldn't be any clearer
that karma yoga is recommended as a purifying mechanism to the mind roiled
by emotion.
