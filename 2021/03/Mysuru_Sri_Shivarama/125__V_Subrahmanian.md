A mahAtmA by name Mysore Sri Shivarama Sastry lived over a hundred years
ago in Mysore. He was initially employed in the Mysore Palace.  Owing to
strong dispassion he renounced householderâ€™s life and became a recluse.  He
composed hundreds of songs in Kannada on the Vedantic theme.  His
compositions are extempore and bring out the profound tattva in instantly
appealing poetry.  Swami Paramananda Bharati took steps to publish about
150 of these songs and has also got them recorded  rendered by expert
musicians.

Here are two links on google drive for a few of the songs rendered to music:

Those who want to buy the two CDs, which are very affordably priced, may
contact shankarAshrama, Bangalore, Phone 080 26670672.

I have deep appreciation for the compositions which Kannada-knowing people
will surely like to benefit from.
