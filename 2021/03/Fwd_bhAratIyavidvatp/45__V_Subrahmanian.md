Subject: {भारतीयविद्वत्परिषत्} Information requested on the origin of the
idea of ākārabheda in Avidyā
To: भारतीयविद्वत्परिषत् <bvparishat at googlegroups.com>


Namaste Vidvāns

I'm looking for the earliest mentions of the concept of single avidyā,
which has different ākāras. Citsukhācārya mentions it towards the end of
his Tattvapradīpikā while citing his Guru as the authority (nyāyasudhāyām
ārādhyapādair upapāditam). I also found such an idea towards the end of
Ānandajñāna's Tarkasaṅgraha.

Is there any other mention of such an idea prior before Citsukhācārya and
Ānandajñāna?
Kindly guide.
