Soma - PraNAms
It is not just mantra 6 - in the description of every state - waking, dream, and deep sleep states, the Upanishad presents both from the point of micro and macro references. Mantra 6 deals with the deep-sleep state.

Dear fellow seekers,

Please help me understand Matnra 6 in which there is a sudden leap from the Atma to Ishvara.

Esha: Ishvarah:

Seems to me what the sage is saying is the Atma in sushupti state is freed from the effect of the body and mind.

In this state it is pure consciousness, pragnyanaGhana, AnanadaBhuk.

In this state the consciousness, the karana shareera, becomes Ishvara himself.

And thus upon waking it creates the jiva and the jagat.

We are in effect Ishvara, none other.
Thank you for your thoughts.

Soma
