 Pranam RaghavJiI appreciate the analogy and also the shifting of our cognition between micro and macrocosm.Expanding on the analogy, the space in the pot is brhma, as the upanishad declares at the start, sarvam hytad brhma.The mention of Ishvara that occurs in the 6th is the creative energy that arises from brhmahraya, by which jagat appears, we can say the way the two pots that appear. And this Ishvara is the Atma, both being Brhma as there is nothing other than Brhma, but in different forms although even the forms are unreal.In that sense ishvara evokes the jagat which is unreal, and atma evokes the body-mind complex which is unreal.There is no argument here, just stating how i am understanding these verses.Thank you.Om Somaya namaha.

As Sada ji said -
The resolving of the macrocosm in to the individually experienced microcosm at the gross level (waking state) is through the pravilApanam of vishva in to vaishvAnara. Similar pravilApanam takes place at the sUxma or subtle level of existence viz., the dream state where non-difference between taijasa (individual) and hiraNyagarbha (total).
This resolving of macrocosm in to microcosm is cognitive , I.e., by changing our understanding and thus shifting our attention.
Lets say there is a small pot kept *inside* a larger pot. An analogy could be of looking at the space in the smaller pot as non different from the space in the larger pot.
Another *analogy* from science would be of our physical body forming an unbroken continuum with all matter in the universe. From the understanding of the universe as an ocean of matter, all individual boundaries are *resolved* in one's understanding.

 Soma - PraNAms
It is not just mantra 6 - in the description of every state - waking, dream, and deep sleep states, the Upanishad presents both from the point of micro and macro references. Mantra 6 deals with the deep-sleep state.

Dear fellow seekers,

Please help me understand Matnra 6 in which there is a sudden leap from the Atma to Ishvara.

Esha: Ishvarah:

Seems to me what the sage is saying is the Atma in sushupti state is freed from the effect of the body and mind.

In this state it is pure consciousness, pragnyanaGhana, AnanadaBhuk.

In this state the consciousness, the karana shareera, becomes Ishvara himself.

And thus upon waking it creates the jiva and the jagat.

We are in effect Ishvara, none other.
Thank you for your thoughts.

Soma
