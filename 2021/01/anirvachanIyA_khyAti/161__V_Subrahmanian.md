Yes, Raghav ji, you have put it nicely.  As a blessing we just finished the
study of a few verses in the Panchadashi 13th Chapter, from verse 30 to 44
where this nuance is very nicely explained by Swami Vidyaranya/Bharati
Teertha.  Shakti, Maya, is anirvachaniya on these grounds:  It does not
have an existence independent of its locus.  We cant say it exists on its
own. Nor can we say it does not exist since we see its effect happening in
that locus.  And the effect of maya is also anirvachaniya on these grounds:
the pot, e.g. does not exist before its being produced. It does not exist
after its destruction. We use a new word 'pot' only upon its production but
not while it was just clay.  So, a pot, product of maya, had no existence
before and after, has only a name uttered to designate it. Apart from the
name and apart from clay, its cause, it has no existence. We can't say it
does not exist since it appears and is experienced. Finally, the shakti and
its kArya, are not always existent; the shakta/cause alone is ever
existent. A reading of the Panchadashi with Ramakrishna commentary will
give a lot of clarity.

subbu
