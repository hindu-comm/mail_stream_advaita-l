Namaste Raghav Ji,

Reg  <<  Is this idea of anirvacaniiyaa khyaati presented in Shankara
Bhashya? Or
was it of later origin? Also, do some advaitins hold that this
anirvacaniiyaa khyaati-vaada was of later post-Shankara origin?  >>,

It is the contention of Sri SSS that anirvacaniiyaa khyaati-vaada was of
later post-Shankara origin. He is of the view that  it is contrary to the
Bhashya itself (भाष्य विरुद्ध Bhashya Virudha). All the other commentators
present   anirvacaniiyaa khyaati-vaada as forming part of the Bhashya
itself. However according to Sri SSS, while all others do so, Swami
Suresvaracharya does not admit of this.
