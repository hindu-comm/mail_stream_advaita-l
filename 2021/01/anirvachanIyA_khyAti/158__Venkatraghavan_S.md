Namaste Raghav ji

In the ArambhaNAdhikaraNam, the bhAmatikAra famously clarifies what
ananyatvam between the kArya and kAraNa means. And what is that ananyatvam?
It is not identity, rather it is a denial of difference - न
खल्वनन्यत्वमित्यभेदं ब्रूमः, किन्तु भेदं व्यासेधामः.

However, even in denying difference, some difference is accepted. How so ?
Because it is an anirvachanIya difference.
नच मृदः शरावादयो भिद्यन्ते, न चाभिन्नाः, न वा भिन्नाभिन्नाः
किन्त्वनिर्वचनीया एव ।

The bhAmati sentence above gives the specific example of the pot and clay
to address your question below.

In Advaita Siddhi this is referred to as - अभेदे कार्यकारणभावव्याहत्या
कथंचिदपि भेदस्यावश्याभ्युपेयत्वात्.

In fact by the hetu of amshitva, the anirvachanIyatva of the  kArya is
established.

Regards,
Venkatraghavan
