 Hari om Subbu ji
You may be wondering who is this?

I want to say thank you for sending this to the whole group. The Hindi version of what this whole thing is about. Nirvana Shatkam of Shankaracharya in Hindi and much more. I don't have words to say thanks. I understand Hindi, and thoroughly enjoyed this.
Hari om
Vijay Kumar

It has a few more stanzas at the end, though.
