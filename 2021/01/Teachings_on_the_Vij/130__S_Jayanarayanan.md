MELMANGALAM: APRIL 18-20, 2017
Jagadgurus at Melmangalam
ARRIVAL & PUBLIC FUNCTION

Sri Mahasannidhanam and Sri Sannidhanam arrived at the Agrahara of Melmangalam in the evening of April 18, 2017 to a reverential welcome.
The Ubhaya Jagadgurus first had Darshan of Sri Adi Shankara Bhagavatpada at the Sringeri Shankara Math. Thereafter, the Jagadgurus graced a
public function in the premises of the Pathashala of the Vidya Bharati Saanga Veda Paripalana Sabha at Melmangalam.

After Dhuli Pada was performed by Dharmadhikari Venkatasubramanian, the function began with Veda Ghosha and prayer. Swagata Patrikas in
Sanskrit and Tamil were then read and submitted to the Jagadgurus. Sri Mahasannidhanam in His Anugraha Bhashanam said that the devotees at
Melmangalam are ardent disciples of the Sringeri Jagadguru and praised them for the wonderful maintenance of the Sringeri Shankara Math
in the village. Sri Mahasannidhanam also praised them for having set up a Pathashala to ensure that Bhagavatpada’s first dictum –
वेदो नित्यमधीयताम् (Study the Vedas daily) – is followed scrupulously and Vedic chants are always heard in the shrine of Bhagavatpada.
Sri Mahasannidhanam also observed that the sanctity of the shrine has been maintained ever since He performed the Prathishta Kumbhabhisheka
in 1995 and stated that being in the shrine brings about bliss.

Sri Mahasannidhanam then performed the Sharada Chandramoulishwara Pooja in the newly inaugurated dias dedicated on the occasion for the
performance of the Pooja.

VEDA-VEDANTA SADAS

A Veda-Vedanta Sadas was held in Melmangalam in the divine presence of the Ubhaya Jagadgurus. Sri Mahasannidhanam inaugurated the Sadas
in the Sringeri Shankara Math in front of the shrine of Bhagavatpada. Vidwan Mani Dravid gave a Vedanta Vakyartha in front of
Sri Mahasannidhanam and Sri Sannidhanam. Following this, Vakyarthas in select Adhikaranams of the Brahmasutras by other Vidwans took place.  

As part of the Sadas, Parayana of Rig, Yajur and Sama Vedas took place in which renowned Vedic scholars as well as the faculty and students
of the Melmangalam Pathashala took part.  

At 4:30 pm, Sri Sannidhanam graced the evening Sabha in which scholars gave Tamil Upanyasas on various topics including Sandhyavandanam,
importance of knowing the meaning of Mantras, and Vedantic tenets as expounded in Bhagavatpada’s Vivekachoodamani. This being the birth
centenary year of the 35th Acharya of the Peetham, Jagadguru Sri Abhinava Vidyatirtha Mahaswamiji, a short discourse on the life of the
illustrious Acharya also took place.

At 6 pm, Sri Mahasannidhanam graced the Sabha. Guru Vandana was performed with huge amounts of flowers being offered to the Padukas of
Sri Mahasannidhanam amidst chants of the Sringeri Guru Parampara Stotram and the Guru Paduka Stotram.

Sri N Venkataraman of the Vidya Bharati Saanga Veda Paripalana Sabha speaking on the occasion deemed it a fortune to have received the
constant guidance of the Sringeri Jagadguru to taking up the cause of Vedic and Shastraic studies. He attributed the transformation being
observed in the village to the sheer grace of the Jagadgurus. Thereafter, the scholars who participated in the Veda-Vedanta Sadas were honoured.

Anugraha Bhashanams

Sri Mahasannidhanam in His Anugraha Bhashanam spoke about Veda Vidya, its importance and greatness. Sri Mahasannidhanam said that even
those who are unable to study the Vedas must support those who are engaged in Vedic study. Expressing joy over the efforts of the
Agrahara of the Melmangalam to set up the Pathashala and to conduct a Veda-Vedanta Sadas during the Vijaya Yatra of the Sringeri Jagadgurus,
Sri Mahasannidhanam stated that the study of the Vedangas must also take place in the Pathashala. Studying the Vedas along with the Vedangas
is called “Saangaadhyayanam” and he who has studied in this manner is said to have finished his studies completely. The six Vedangas viz.,
Shiksha, Vyarakanam, Kalpa, Niruktam, Chandas and Jyotisham, are like the limbs of the Veda Purusha – Shiksha corresponds to the nose of
the Veda Purusha; Kalpa corresponds to the hands; and Jyotisha to the eyes, Nirukta to the ears, Chandas to the feet and Vyakarana to the
face of the Veda Purusha –

शिक्षा ध्राणं तु वेदस्य हस्तः कल्पोऽथ उच्यते ।
ज्योतिषामयनं चक्षुः निरुक्तं श्रोत्रमुच्यते ॥
छन्दः पादौ तु वेदस्य मुखं व्याकरणं स्मृतम् ।

Sri Mahasannidhanam ended His Anugraha Bhashanam blessing all.

Sri Sannidhanam in His Anugraha Bhashanam pointed out the importance of cultivating humility despite one’s scholarship and intelligence,
and approaching the Guru for instruction in Brahma Vidya. Sri Sannidhanam also directed that such a Sadas must be made an annual event,
and blessed all in the gathering.

SPECIAL PUJA & VISITS

On April 20, 2017, Sri Sannidhanam offered Pooja in the morning at 6:30 at the shrine of Bhagavatpada in the Sringeri Shankara Math.
At 9 am, Sri Sannidhanam visited the temples in the Melmangalam Agrahara namely those of Mayapandeeshwarar, Aahooya Varadarajaswamy,
Pallikonda Perumal, and Sri Meenakshi Sundareshwarar. Later Sri Mahasannidhanam and Sri Sannidhanam gave Darshan and blessed devotees
with Mantrakshata. Sri Sannidhanam also examined the Vidyarthis of the Pathashala. In the evening, the Jagadgurus blessed the management,
Adhyapakas and Vidyarthis of the Pathashala and started from Melmangalam towards Vathalagundu.
