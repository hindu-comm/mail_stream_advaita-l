To: <advaitin at googlegroups.com>


Brahmasri Sundar Kumar is a popular exponent of Srimad Bhagavatam in
Tamil.  He has been doing this for the past several decades. His discourses
are very informative, interesting and instructive.  His knowledge of the
Bhagavatam, Ramayanam, Veda, both Upanishads and Samhita, Dharma Shaastra,
Kaavya of Kalidasa, etc. Sangeetam of Thyagaraja, Dikshitar, etc. and also
MaraThi literature is very wide and deep. He is up to date in modern
management practices, concepts, etc. He uses English too in the course of
discourses and that appeals to those who are modern educated.  He had
worked in the Canara Bank for several years.  He is inspired by Brahmasri
Sengalipuram Anantharama Dikshitar whom he regards as his Guru.  In the URL
given, one can find his 100-day Bhagavatam Upanyasams.
