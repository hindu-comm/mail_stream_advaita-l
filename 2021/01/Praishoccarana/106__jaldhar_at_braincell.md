According to Dharmasindhu, that vow is part of viraja homa which takes 
place before praishocchara.  He offers an anjali saying

putreShaNA vitteShaNA lokeShaNA sarveShaNA mayA parityaktA abhayaM 
sarvabhUtebhyo mattaH svAhA ||

The praishocchara itself begins with OM bhUH saMnyastaMmayA etc. up to 
danda etc. grahana according to this shastra.  Though as I said, I think 
in actual  practice a more specialized paddhati is used by the various 
akhadhas and maths.
