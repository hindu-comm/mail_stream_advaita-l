The deluded Jivas have desires, avidyA --> kAma --> karma is the cyclical
triad. These desires can be good or bad. When the sum total of the good
desires is ripe for countering the bad in the world, there is avatAra of
Ishvara. The need is not for Advaita Vedanta itself, but as an answer to
the prayers of the bhaktas, who are themselves helpless. Moreover, it is
also for Advaita Vedanta as it is also part of Vedas, which need to be
preserved by defeating the Asuras.
