Namaste

The world is illusion does not mean it does  not follow any rules. The good
and bad are also Maya. There  is a fight between good and evil like in a
film. The good hero will defeat the bad villain. When the villain is
harassing people the hero will come to defeat him. The hero gives assurance
to people he will come whenever they need him and rescue them. All this is
happening in the film but not really.
