My humble pranams to all,

I apologize beforehand for my experience with Advaita Vedanta is very
minimal, so this question showcases my limited understanding, but I wanted
to clear my doubt nonetheless.

If Advaita Vedanta propounds that "Brahman alone is real", and that
opposites such as "good" and "evil", "joy and suffering" are solely an
illusion of the "JivAtma" under the "Avarana shakti of mAya, then what is
the requirement for "avatars" of Saguna Brahman? How is the need for such
Avatars explained in the context of Advaita Vedanta?

I recognise the need for enlightened men or "Jivanmuktas" such as the
revered Sri Shankara, Sri Ramakrishna as "JivAtmas" who were able to
successfully realize their true self and break out of this illusion and at
the same time played the role of "Gurus" to guide the rest of us. I can
also understand " Sri Krishna" as an Avatar who gave his guidance in the
form of the Gita.

But I do not understand the need for Avatars intended for the destruction
of evil beings or "Asuras" (who are themselves part of Brahman)?. Isn't
"asuri pravritti" also merely a deeper form or a "TAmasic" form of
illusion". Aren't Asuras also ultimately bound by the Law of Karma? So what
is the need for Saguna Brahman to appear as Varaha or Vamana avatar?

I want to stress that I am myself open to the importance of all the four
yogas, Bhakti especially, so this is not meant to be dismissive of such
ideas, but merely an attempt to gain better understanding.


Vishesh.
