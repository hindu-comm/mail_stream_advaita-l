üôè Pranams Atman,


As per the Advaitic scriptures, it is said that only "knowledge" can
deliver Moksha. This is because the fundamental problem is that of
"ignorance ". Ignorance is nothing but false knowledge. Through scriptures,
we must learn, reflect & assimilate the Truth & only this knowledge of the
Truth can liberate us from the bondage caused by the samsara.


But isn't there other ways to get liberation?


Bhakthi, in its heightened state, transforms itself into a state of
non-duality, where the devotee becomes so insignificant in front of the
"object of devotion" that there is no apparent duality such as "Dasa "or
"Prabhu".


Dhyanam, suspends thought & emotions by separating it from the self. In the
peak meditative state, there is no meditator or the experience of
meditation. A state of "Advaitam" is reached.


By Nishkamya karma, suspending the idea of doer from what is being done,
the ego loses its relevance & even though mind & intellect could function,
the division between the self & the other dissolves and it reaches the
state of Advaitam.


I, myself have experienced the momentary state of advaitam, doing all four.


One could argue that "Bhakthi", "Dhyanam" & "Nishkamya Karma", reaches the
state of Advaitam only while it is being practised."Brahma Jnanam" on the
other hand, is something you could gain once & it does not require any
momentary practice. But isn't it true given that, the separation of time as
past, present & future itself is the fabrication of the Now & only the
Present moment exists?



   1. If a "Bhakta" or a "Dhyani" or a "Karmi", is so advanced that, that
   one could retain their state of Advaitam without even remotely going
   through the Vedic scriptures or attaining Brahma Jnanam from a Guru, isn't
   that Moksha ?
   2. Is Self-knowledge necessary or sufficient or neither for Moksha ?
