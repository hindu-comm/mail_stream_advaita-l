Pranams,

Thank you very much for your reply Raghav ji.

But, I wanted to know, What makes GYAnam more significant than other 
approaches like Dhyanam, Bhakthi etc ?

Traditional Advaitic notion is that Bhakthi, Dhyanam etc.. just give the 
experience of being in the state of Advaita. This experience depends 
upon the act of doing it. Hence such approaches cannot give Moksha.

But as GYAnam is self-evident. First, it removes the ignorance, then it 
removes itself, leaving only the Truth.

The self knowledge acts on the false knowledge which is in the MIND of 
the JIVA is it not ?

❓ My doubt is that, GYAnam can remove the ignorance only when one is 
(appears to be) in the state of duality. When one reached the pinnacle 
of Bhakthi, Dyanam etc, there is no such duality as the mind does not 
indulge in any kind of discrimination. We may call it "spiritual 
experience" or "meditative state". The purpose of GYAnam is to remove 
the veil of Ignorance. But in such a state GYAnam cannot remove the veil 
of ignorance because the person don't have any false knowledge in the 
first place.

Now, suppose a person is so refined that he can indulge in such a 
Bhakthi, Dyanam etc... for every moment rest of his life, and die a 
natural death depleting all his karmas.

Doesn't he get Videha Mukthi ?

In such cases can't a seeker attain Moksha even without indulging in 
self-knowledge ?

Doesn't this contradict Adi Shankaracharya's notion that only 
self-knowledge can give Moksha ?
