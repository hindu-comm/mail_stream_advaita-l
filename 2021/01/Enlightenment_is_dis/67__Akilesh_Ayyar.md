Spiritual awakening or liberation is essentially a matter of immense,
intense discernment -- an act of focused distinguishing away of all the
things one is not, which then reveals what one really is, though that
revelation is not to the one who originally sought it. That's the paradox
of seeking: you seek as you know that you are what you seek. The intense
discernment required for the search is driven by equally intense desire for
liberation, which generates, through practice, a relatively quiet mind, and
focus... which must be then be channeled all the way through -- to
discerning away ALL the things that you are not. There is an end to the
process, but it is not what you think it is.
