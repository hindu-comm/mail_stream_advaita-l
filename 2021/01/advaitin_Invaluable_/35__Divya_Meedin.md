Namaskaram Sir,

Thank you for having pointed that out. Though the book is unavailable at
the link, I have downloaded the revised unpublished version that you had
posted earlier.

The link for "Sankara's Date  Revised (unpublished): 1983"

http://www.mediafire.com/file/17yqhy9xp6qe1af/Shankara%25E2%2580%2599s_Date_%255BRevised_%2528unpublished%2529__1983%255D.pdf/file

Somehow I had forgotten that the revised (unpublished) 1983 version of the
book "Sankara's Date" authored by Brahmasri R.M.Umesh is available here for
download. So I suggest that interested readers may download this revised
edition, though unpublished.

regards
subbu////
