Thank you for sharing that, Subbuji.

Regarding playing the reading at a higher playback speed, that's a
'pragmatic' suggestion by you!

 I remember somewhere Swami Paramarthananda ji good humoredly remarked that
several of his students play his lectures at a significantly higher
playback speed, making his voice sound a bit squeaky - in order to listen
to a 60 minute lecture in 40 minutes and save 20 minutes!!

Om
Raghav
