Glad to note that the Upanishad Bhashya classes (audio) of Dr Mani Dravid Sastri have now been made available in the site "Centre for Brahmavidya". Hope the administrators make available the Scholar's classes on the other Upanishads (especially the Brahadaranyaka) and also the Brahma Sutra Bhashyam  

Hara Hara Mahadev
