A grand finale to a mammoth 103 day Bhagavata Pravachana that happened
online, witnessed by several thousands of people all over.  This particular
episode, the ending one, has an amazing re-telling of the entire Bhagavatam
in a concise mode, in the last few minutes.  The narrator, Br.Sri
Sundarkumar, takes us through a quick-journey of the whole Bhagavatam.  His
power is mind boggling.
