Subject: {भारतीयविद्वत्परिषत्} Looking for a work of Sri Appayya Dikshitar
To: BHARATIYA VIDVAT <bvparishat at googlegroups.com>


Namaste


Here is an information of a work of Sri Dikshitar 'Shiva purana tamasatva
nirakarana' which is not available now. As per the image below, it was
printed at  Adisaraswati Nilaya Press, Madras, Year 1871:  (the third item
in the image below)

Is it possible to procure a copy of that book, either digital or physical,
from any place it might be lodged?

Thanks
