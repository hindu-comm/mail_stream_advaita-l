*About शङ्करस्तोत्रमकरन्द:  Shankara Stotra Makaranda*

As directed by and with the blessings of Paramapujya Sri Periyava, a
dedicated special Shankara Stotra Course of six months’ duration
titled *Shankara
Stotra Makaranda* has been planned. The course will be conducted by
Jagadguru Seva Ratnam, Upanyasa Tilakam Shri P.R.Kannan. The select list of
Shankara Stotras to be covered in the course is given below. The lecturer
will recite each verse of each Stotra in parts and the participant will
repeat the same. This will be followed by explanation of Bhavartha,
essential meaning of the verse, Padaccheda, separation of compound words
and Pratipadartha, word meaning. The plan is to cover a verse in about ten
minutes.The course will start on Thursday, 28 Jan 2021, followed by
sessions on every Saturday and Sunday, each day from 8 AM IST for one hour
duration. Those who complete the course successfully will be awarded a
certificate by Sri Periyava during Vyasa Puja. Sri Periyava is keen on
worldwide participation of maximum enthusiasts of Sanatana Dharma and good
spread of awareness of our treasures of Samskrit language and Adi
Shankaracharya’s Stotras.

We are blessed to have this program to be launched by Shri Periyava on *Friday,
29 January 2021 at 8 AM  IST/**Thursday 28th January 2021 9.30 pm Eastern/
