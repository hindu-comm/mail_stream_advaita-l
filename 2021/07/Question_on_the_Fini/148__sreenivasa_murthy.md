 Dear Sri Kartik Vashishta,
There is no independently existing finite jiva .It is The Infinite which takes the garb of the 
adventious limiting adjuncts and appears as jiva.
the following mantras from Upanishads support the above statement:ahamEvEdagM sarvam || Chandogya Mantra 7-25-1AtmaivEdagM sarvam || chandogya Mantra 7-25-2SarvagM hyEtadbrahma ayamAtmAbrahma || Mandukya mantra 2
This has been very clearly explained by Sri Shankarain his commentary to mantra 1-4-10 of Bruhadaranyaka Upanishad.A study of the same will be of immense benefit.
With warm regards,Sreenivasa Murthy

Revered Self,

Sadar Pranam,

If not inconvenient to you, please explain to me how a finite jiva can
possibly have infinite desires.
Is it because at the back of the finite Jiva is the infinite?

Pranam,
