A scholars praise of shri shankara vedanta.

Advaita VedƒÅnta, states Eliot Deutsch
<https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eliot_Deutsch>, "has been and continues to
be the most widely accepted system of thought among philosophers in India,
and it is, we believe, one of the greatest philosophical achievements to be
found in the East or the West".
