There is a work 'Sarvamatasangraha' whose  author is unknown, which gives a
somewhat detailed account of many schools of philosophy.  In a paper by
Marek Major, on this work, the author states on p.261:

This work is found to have quotations from the Manameyodaya, a work of
Narayana Bhatta (the famed author of the Narayaneeyam) and the
Tarkasangraha of Annambhatta. Both these works are of the 17th Century  As
such the  'Sarvamatasangraha' is placed  post 1700 AD.
