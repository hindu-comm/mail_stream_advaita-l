The article, if five pages, in Sanskrit, with a lot of quotations with
references, is a good read on Vedanta.  There are spelling errors, though.
While citing a passage from the Shuka Rahasyopanishat, the author,
inadvertently in the article, says it is in the Samkshepa shariraka by
Appayya Dikshitar, which evidently, is not so.  In the footnote index,
though, he says it is Siddhanta lesha sangraha.
