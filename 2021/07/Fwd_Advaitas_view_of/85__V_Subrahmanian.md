Subject: Advaita's view of Dvaita
To: <advaitin at googlegroups.com>



The author of the book 'Vedanta Tattvaloka', Janardana is non-different
from Anandagiri (13th Century CE) who has penned the gloss for the entire
Prasthana traya bhashya of Shankaracharya, the Brihadaranyaka and
Taittiriya Upanishad bhashya Vartika of Sureshwaracharya and a few
prakarana texts of Shankaracharya.
In the foreword to this book, eminent scholar Late MM Sri S.Subrahmanya
Sastri says:
Advaita can be established only by demonstrating the unreality, mithyatva,
of dvaita and hence a refutation of the latter becomes inevitable.
However, it is unnecessary and impossible for dvaita to refute Advaita.
Since dvaita is already accepted in Advaita in the vyavaharika state, it is
unnecessary to refute it. Since Advaita is essentially of the form of
Brahman and since Brahman is verily the Atman, it is impossible to
refute/reject the Atman.
