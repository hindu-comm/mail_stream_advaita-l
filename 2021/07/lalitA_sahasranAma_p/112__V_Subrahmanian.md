I think since the third session was at 6.30 PM, it was over and the next
one will be Ashtottaram scheduled for tomorrow at 7 AM.  Generally the
videos of the live sessions would be uploaded much later, after the entire
event is over.  That is what I understand. So, for tomorrow's Sahasranama
session pl. note the timings.
