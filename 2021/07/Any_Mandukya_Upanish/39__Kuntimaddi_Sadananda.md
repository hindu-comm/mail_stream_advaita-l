Raghava Kumar - PraNAms
Since you mentioned Shree Goda Venkateswara Sastri Garu, I have very fond memories. He was taking classes on Advaita Siddhi at that time in Chennai, but in Tamil. When I went to his house and told him that I do not understand Tamil. He asked me 'what languages do you understand?' - when I mentioned English and Telugu, he said come everyday in the morning, I will teach you in Telugu - Thus started my Advaita Siddhi classes with him. He was teaching me on one to one basis. Unfortunately he became sick and later left this abode.
I was fortunate to be associated with him for sometime.
Hari Om!Sadananda

 I have listened to excerpts of a few lectures of Sri Goda Venkateshwara
Sastri garu of Chennai on brahmasutra bhAShya.

It would be nice if they or their equivalents are online.
