See to what limits bigotry can go:

Was Bhishma ashamed of speaking of the glories and 1000 names of Shiva?

Sri Vadiraja Tirtha (of the Madhva school), in his ‘Lakshalankara’, a
commentary on the Mahabharata, says that Bhishma, feeling ashamed of
narrating the glories of Shiva, turned to Krishna to do the same when
Yudhishthira sought to know Shiva’s glories and the 1000 names.
