This is a series of lectures talking about the greatness & surrender of
Upamanyu Maharishi to Lord Shiva. He is also the Shiva Diksha GURU for
Krishna and explained to him about the Supreme Shiva Tattva. This video
talks about Lord Shiva granting various boons to Upamanyu Maharishi and
also granting him Sannidhya Mukti (eternal close proximity to Lord Shiva in
Para Kailasha).
