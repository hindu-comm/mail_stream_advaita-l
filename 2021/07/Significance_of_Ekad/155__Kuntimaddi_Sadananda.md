PraNAms to everybody.
Eka dasi - is 10 + 1.
The ten stands of - 5 jnaanedriyas and 5 karmendriyas.
Jnaanedriyas are five sense organs.
karmendriyas are five organs of action.
One who live only at the level is dasha mukha - Ravana.
One above all this is Ekdadasi
It is a day of fast -fasting from the over indulgence involving the ten - jnaanedriyas and karmendriyas.
It is a day of contemplation on the truth diverting their minds from all the sense input - the one who is doing that is the one who is observing the Ekadasi.

 Ekadashi is also celebrated as a Shaiva Vratam as that was the day when
Mahadeva drank the Halaahala poison.
