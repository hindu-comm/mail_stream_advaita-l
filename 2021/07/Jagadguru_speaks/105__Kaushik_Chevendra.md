While it is true that, in principle, every person is eligible for atma
jnana, it cannot be easily attained by all. There are several yama- niyamas
and sadhanas (austerities and spiritual practices) to be observed. Our
forefathers have prescribed devotion towards the Lord and chanting His holy
name as the primary means during this Kali Yuga. Even as man performs his
daily karma, he has to work towards strengtheninghis devotion towards the
Lord. Much sreyas (spiritual welfare) will follow and there will be
progress on all fronts. The effect of his demerits will diminish to a fair
extent owing to his pashchattapa (repentance). With increase in faith and
devotion towards the Lord, man's mind will get purified. This is what Lord
Sri Krishna says to Uddhava in the Srimad Bhagavatam: "In the same way that
the heat of a strong fire completely burns wood to ashes, devotion towards
Me will completely destroy all papa." As accumulated papa gets destroyed,
the mind gets purified(attains chitta suddhi).Eventually, through the
Guru's upadesa (instruction). Self-knowledge dawns and man will attain
liberation (moksha).
