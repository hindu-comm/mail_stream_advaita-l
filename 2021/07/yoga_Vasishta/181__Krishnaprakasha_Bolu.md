Namaste,

There is a theory that Yoga vasishta evolved over time, with numerous
anecdotes added to illustrate Advaita Vedanta, out of an original and the
original text seems to be lost. The original text is named Mokshopaya and
it is opined that Advaita purported here is quite different from
Shaankaraadvaita.
