Namaste,

In psychology there is this word flow which is also used quite popularly
now, where people
talk about "being the flow".
"In positive psychology <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive_psychology>,
a *flow state*, also known colloquially as being *in* *the zone*, is the mental
state <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_state> in which a person
performing some activity is fully immersed in a feeling of energized focus,
full involvement, and enjoyment in the process of the activity. In essence,
flow is characterized by the complete absorption in what one does, and a
resulting transformation in one's sense of time."

Savikalpa Samadhi is considered to be sajathiya vritti pravaha, where one
is also immersed
in a particular subject.

Are there any similarities or differences to be drawn here?
Are these completely unrelated to one another?

Om Namo Narayanaya,
Anand
