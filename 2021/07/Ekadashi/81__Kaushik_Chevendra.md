namaste raghav sir.
thank you for your wise words.
here is a small talk on devotion by jagadguru Abhinava tirtha-

D: Is there anything special about the path of devotion?

HH: Anybody can follow the path of devotion. There is no restriction at
all. Moreover, it can be followed easily. One naturally has prīti (love).
If it is turned towards Īśvara, it becomes devotion. In the path of jñāna or
 dhyāna, one may have to face many difficulties during practice. Only after
having advanced to a certain extent, one enjoys great joy. Such is not the
case with the path of devotion. We can experience great joy even before
reaching an advanced stage. Even while contemplating on the Lord, we can
enjoy bliss. Hence, in the path of devotion, there is happiness right from
the beginning. Devotion is the means and also the end.


The last statement that bakthi is the means and also the end, is in
accordance with the statement of shri Madhusudhana Saraswatis in Bakthi
rasayana and also the bagavatham which says the devotee doesn't even
want liberation, as long as he can serve his lord.
