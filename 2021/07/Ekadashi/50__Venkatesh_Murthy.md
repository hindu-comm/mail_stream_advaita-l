Namaste

Our Sampradaya has laid down Panchayatana Puja to worship Ganesha, Shiva.
Vishnu, Shakti and Surya. There is a reason for this. We should not become
fanatics of one God and quarrel with devotees of other Gods. It will be a
big obstacle for us if we become fanatics. Every God is a form of Saguna
Brahma. No God is inferior and nobody is superior.
