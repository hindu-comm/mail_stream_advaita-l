OM
OM NAMAH SIVANANDAYA

Revered Self,

Sadar Pranam,

From:  https://www.swami-krishnananda.org/sadh/sadh_06.html

"In this yoga of japa, all the other aspects of yoga also will be found to
commingle in some way or other. Inasmuch as there is a god in front of the
japa sadhaka, bhakti yoga comes in, even in japa sadhana. You love your god
of the japa mantra, your divinity; you pray, and you are deeply in
affection of that god. This is the bhakti aspect of japa sadhana.

And you concentrate with the power of your will on this divinity, on the
rishi (sage) and on the mantra itself. This is the raja yoga aspect of japa
sadhana. You understand the immanence of this divinity everywhere, not that
it is in one place only. The concentration on the immanent aspect of this
divinity is the jnana yoga aspect of japa sadhana. So, bhakti yoga, raja
yoga, and jnana yoga â€“ all these are in japa sadhana. Bhagavan Sri Krishna
has rightly said that nothing is equal to japa as a sadhana."

Pranam,

OM
