And this is the statement of bagavtpada in the last stanza of "bhaja
govindam"-

*bhajagovindaM bhajagovindaM govindaM bhajamuuDhamate .
naamasmaraNaadanyamupaayaM nahi pashyaamo bhavataraNe .. (33) *

*Worship Govinda, worship Govinda, worship Govinda, Oh fool ! Other than
chanting the Lord's names, there is no other way to cross the life's ocean.*


And the works of "narayaneeyam" and "gudartha dipika" by advaita acharyas
specify the importance of bhakthi. It's not a mere form of "chitta sudhi".
