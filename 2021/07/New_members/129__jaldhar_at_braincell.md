Davor Virkes
------------

Hi all,

I'm Davor from Croatia. Currently I'm fixing texts of DevI MAhAtmyam for our
chanting group, with hopes to have a big event next summer in Croatia.
I have a PhD in el. engineering, and I also studied Jyotish and Sanskrit.
I already found here some very precious things, and I wouldn't mind if you
keep me here.


Raja Krishnamurti
-----------------

I ike to read Upanishads, vedas and commentaries written on the Prastaana 
Trayi like Upanisghads, Brahma Sutras, Bhagawat Gita as well as other 
scriptural texts.
