DhanyavAda to everyone for the answer.

I have just one follow up question. Please pardon my persistence.
Parikshita in the Mahabharata is cursed and fated to die from the bite of
Takshaka which he could not escape. But why is it then in certain cases,
there are rituals prescribed and done to escape untimely death? This is
just an example. Why is it in certain cases that Karma phala seems
inescapable but there are also instances when the same Karma phala is
thwarted by means of rituals or Japa. This applies to punyA too. If I had
some punyA phala from my past lives, am I destined to receive it even if I
sit idle or is there an action necessary on my part to receive it?

Even when trying to understand Gita, this question arises in my mind
whether Krishna's call to Arjuna to act was because it was destined to be
thus?Would the war and the deaths of the people involved have happened even
if Arjuna had not fought the war?? Were Krishna's teachings to make Arjuna
realise that his temporary vairAgya was a result of mohA and therefore
would only cause him more distress later even if he gave up arms and
dutiful actions?Did Arjuna actually have free will here?

Parts of this question are ambiguous and probably disconnected. Bu I hope I
have been able to convey the root of my doubts.

Humble pranams,
Vishesh
