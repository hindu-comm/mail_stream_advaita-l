Namaste Raghav ji,

This is not the dipika (which is elusive;  not to be found, though it is
said there is one).  This is his very detailed bhashya or vyakhyanam for
all the three valli-s of the Taittiriya Upanishad. It is printed as the
'Sayana Bhashya' for the 7th, 8th and 9th prapaThaka of the Taittiriya
Aranyaka.

The work of Sriharsha is basically a refutation of the Nyaya school and
there he makes the cited statement.  Yes, as you say, the purport of the
Sriharsha verse is in saying that all arguments are in the vyavaharik plane
and not in the paramartha view.

The verse as copied above, is a distorted version of the pdf.  Here is the
correct form:

अभीष्टसिद्धावपि खंडनानां अखण्डिराज्ञामिव नैवमाज्ञा ।
तत्तानि कस्मान्न यथाभिलाषं सैद्धान्तिकेऽप्यध्वनि योजयध्वम् ॥
