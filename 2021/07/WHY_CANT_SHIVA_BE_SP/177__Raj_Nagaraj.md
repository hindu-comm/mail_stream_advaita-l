All,

This sharing reminded me of the phrase,
vimalabodhacak·π£u·π£a·∏•,  through the eye of pure-illumination, which is in Vivekachudamani 255, which I use for nidhithyasanam:

yatpara·πÉ sakalavƒÅgagocara·πÉ gocara·πÉ vimalabodhacak·π£u·π£a·∏• |
≈õuddhacidghanamanƒÅdi vastu yad
brahma tattvamasi bhavayatmani || 255||

The Supreme Brahman which is beyond the range of speech, but known only through the eye of pure-illumination‚Äò, which is pure mass of Consciousness, which is a beginningless entity --- ‚ÄïThat Brahman Thou Art.....meditate on this in your mind.
