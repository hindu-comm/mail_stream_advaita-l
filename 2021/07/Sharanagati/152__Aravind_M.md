Hi,
I also want to know about sharanagadi from the perspective of shankara ..In
sri vaishnava sambradayam works,we can often see these verses"i am not
capable to perform karma yoga , bhakthi yoga,gnana yoga.As a akincha i
perform sharanagadi"......Sri vaishnavas call their siddhantam as
"sharanagadi margam"...
But sri sankara had laid down a path where one is required to attain chitta
suddhi after performing karma bhakthi yoga and then enter gnana
marga...What is the role of sharanagadi in advaitha...Can one skip karma ,
bhakti ,gnana marga and perform sharanagadi like gajendra
elephant,ajamilan???
