Namaste,
We have been reading and hearing that Bhagavan Shiva, his family and large communityof his close associates reside on the Kailas Mountain.
In last several years, one interesting theory is being circulated, and may very well be true.- Kailas is not a natural mountain at all- It an artificial pyramid, in fact, by far the biggest pyramid on Earth- Advanced spiritual beings reside "inside" this Kailas Pyramid.- So likelyBhagavan Shiva, his family and his associates, reside not "on" Kailas, but "in" Kailas.- So looking foranything on Kailas via satellite will be futile
Regards,Shrinivas Gadkari
