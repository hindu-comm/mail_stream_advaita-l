Hi,
I just remembered having read about such an incident on the internet.  Here
is the link:

https://hinduism.stackexchange.com/questions/16006/what-has-vir%C4%81%E1%B9%ADa-parva-p%C4%81r%C4%81ya%E1%B9%87a-got-to-do-with-rains

Hope this will add value though not addressing the original question "What
is the meaning of 'samputitam'?"
