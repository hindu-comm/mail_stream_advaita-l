Hi,
In some stotras ( shiva panchakshara stotra,shiva panchakshara natchathiram
mala stotra , nrusimha mantra pada stotra , sudarshana ashtakam etc).,the
moola mantra is inside the stotra and it is stated that mantra is
"Samputitam"in the stotra...
1.what does Samputitam actually mean?.
2.Does reciting that mantra Samputitam stotra equal
Reciting the mantra for a particular number of times???
