This video talks about NANDI who is one of the greatest devotees of Lord
Shiva and also the vehicle of Para Shakti & Parama Shiva. The story of
Nandi is told in various Puranas describing his intense devotion to Lord
Shiva. This story is recounted from Varaha Purana where Nandi undergoes
severe penance to Lord Shiva and asks for an interesting boon from him.
