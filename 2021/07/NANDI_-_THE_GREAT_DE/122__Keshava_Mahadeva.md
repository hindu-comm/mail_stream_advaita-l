This video talks about NANDI who is one of the greatest devotees of Lord
Shiva and also the vehicle of Para Shakti & Parama Shiva. The story of
Nandi is told in various Puranas describing his intense devotion to Lord
Shiva. After attaining the Sarupya of Lord Shiva and getting boons from
him, Nandi encounters the demigods Brahma, Vishnu, Indra & others and is
glorified by them. Lord Shiva conducts a beautiful lila where he deludes
the devatas and finally blesses them.
