Namaste.

Reg  << Just to clarify, when you say the views of Swami Parmarthananda on
the
state of a jnani, isn't it also the view of the tradition? >>,

Yes. That is my understanding also. However, during many earlier
discussions on the topic in this Forum, very different and opposite views
were also expressed by many participants. I think even as recently as a
couple of months back also such views were posted. I thought it could be
useful to know about the views of the Swamiji on the topic.
