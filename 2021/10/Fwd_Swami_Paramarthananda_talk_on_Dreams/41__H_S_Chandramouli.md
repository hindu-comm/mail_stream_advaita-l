Namaste.

Considering the number of discussions in this Forum concerning whether
Jnani experiences the world or whether Jnani has a mind of his own, the
talk could also have been aptly titled **State of a Jnani **. If one wants
to learn about the views of Swami Paramarthananda on this aspect of Jnani,
this talk furnishes the answer.

Regards

Chandramouli
