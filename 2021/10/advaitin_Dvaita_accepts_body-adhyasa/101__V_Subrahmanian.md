This verse of the Bhagavatam  https://sa.wikisource.org/s/qno  8.24.46

श्रीराजोवाच -
अनाद्यविद्योपहतात्मसंविदः
तन्मूलसंसारपरिश्रमातुराः ।
यदृच्छयेहोपसृता यमाप्नुयुः
विमुक्तिदो नः परमो गुरुर्भवान् ॥

informs us that the jiva is in anadi samsara due to anadi avidya enveloping
his true svaprakasha chaitnaya svabhava.

subbu
