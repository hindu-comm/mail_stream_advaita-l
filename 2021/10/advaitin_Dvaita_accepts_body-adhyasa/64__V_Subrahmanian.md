That all aastika schools hold the Atma to be distinct from the body-mind
complex is well known. The purpose of mentioning this with reference to
Dvaita is that the consequence of the error (of taking the body to be the
self) is, as explained by the Adhyasa Bhashya, all pramana-prameya
vyavahara, both laukika and shaastriya, up to moksha, will have to be
bracketed as happening in the realm of avidya.   This default, bold
observation by Shankaracharya is unacceptable to all the others.  The
status of the body-mind that is wrongly seen as the self, is also in
danger:  avidya kalpita.  It falls in the category of anirvachaniya since
it can't be satyam as it is sublated upon right knowledge and it can't be
asat like the gagana kusuma since it is experienced.  Such a category is
anathema to all others.  So, merely holding the idea that the
body-identification is an error is not enough and one will have to go
further to accept the consequences too.
