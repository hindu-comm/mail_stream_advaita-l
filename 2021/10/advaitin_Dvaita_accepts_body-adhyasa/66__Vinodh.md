This translation of the lectures of Sri Mani Dravid Shastri seems relevant
to the question:
https://sanskritdocuments.org/sites/snsastri/adhyasabhashya.pdf

Quote: "It has been established that there is mutual superimposition
between the self which is pure consciousness, and the not-self consisting
of the body, mind and senses. Such a superimposition is essential for a
jiva to become a knower (pramaataa). Only if the jiva becomes a pramaataa
he can experience objects through the sense-organs. Only then he becomes a
seer, hearer, thinker, etc. Even for the Saastra to be applicable there has
to be superimposition. For performing the rituals laid down in the Vedas
for attaining heaven the person should know that there is a self which is
different from the gross body and which will continue after death. But he
need not know the real nature of the self as described in Vedanta. If he
knows the real nature of the self it will be an obstacle to his performing
the rituals laid down in the Vedas because there is nothing to be attained
by such a person. Rituals are laid down based on caste such as Brahmana,
etc., ashrama, age, etc. So a person has to identify himself as a Brahmana
or a grihasta, etc., to perform rituals. All these relate to the body. Such
identification is possible only if there is adhyaasa of the body on the
self."

In the above, it is stated that the adhyaasa of the body, mind, and senses
on the self is essential for any vyavahara. So far, I assume the argument
is understandable.

The question that remains from the Dvaita perspective is: why can it not be
that the self as well as the body-mind-senses are both real? And that there
is a self for a Jiva and a different self for a Paramatma, for example? It
could still be that, in this case, the superimposition of the
body-mind-senses is a cause of suffering for the Jiva. But this
superimposition does not necessarily imply that the body-mind-senses
themselves are unreal.

There seems to be a somewhat similar question raised in the above text
(quoted below), but it seems to be answered by an assertion that the
body-mind-senses are not just made of panchabhootas as material cause, but
are also made of avidya as a material cause. And therefore, it is not a
matter of thinking one thing for another (misapprehension).

I suppose this assertion that body-mind-senses have avidya as material
cause is not accepted by the other schools? Because without this additional
assertion that avidya is a material cause for body-mind, it is not entirely
clear if it follows just from the body-mind adhyaasa on the self that all
vyavahara is in avidya. Any thoughts on this would be highly appreciated. üôè

Quote: "Can the attribution of the qualities of the body, mind and senses
to the self be said to be anyathakhyati? Here also the answer is, no. The
material cause of the body is not only the five elements but also the
nescience relating to the particular jiva. Since nescience is
anirvachaniyam, its effect, the body, is also the same. In this view maya
is the totality and individual nescience is a part of it. The body is not
something already existing elsewhere but it has come into existence from
the individual nescience. So anyathakhyati is not applicable."
