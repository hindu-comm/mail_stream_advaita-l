Namaste Vinodh Ji,

Reg  <<  If I understood correctly, the essence of your explanation is that
a superposition of the mind-body on the self is necessary for any vyavahara
including perception of the world >>,

No. Not so. It is not a necessity. Not in my understanding. It is just a
statement of fact as per Advaita Sidhanta.

Reg  << The question that remains from a dvaita point of view is why the
self is considered real whereas the body-mind is not. In my understanding,
both your answers, just like the adhyasa bhashya assert the unreal-ness of
the body-mind without any further analysis of this assertion; and without
an analysis of this assertion, accepting adhyasa alone does not lead dvaita
to the same conclusion as advaita. Please do correct me if I have
misunderstood anything >>,

It is not that you have misunderstood anything. Please don’t mind my saying
that the problem is you have not understood anything properly and just
jumped to conclusions without any study. For an answer you need to study
the pramANa section of the AdhyAsa Bhashya. It is naturally covered briefly
therein. For a detailed exposition of the Sidhanta with pramANa, you need
to study the Upanishads and the Sutra Bhashya. I can only confirm to you
here that it is more than adequately addressed there.
Regards
