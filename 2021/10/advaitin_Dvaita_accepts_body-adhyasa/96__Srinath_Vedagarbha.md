Yes, correct understanding of pUrvapaxa.

Yes, here too the correct understanding of pUrvapaxa.

Summerily correct, but need more clarity here.  The very claim that the
pramana-prameya-pramatrtva are
avidya kruta and hence unreal, is itself a pramEya (nirNaya)  derived after
the analysis of adhyAsa. This final pramEya is antithesis. That makes the
dheAtma adhyAsa still remain unexplained.

When pure Atman is claimed to be having no pramAtR^itva, how could you
claim Atman "unaware" of its true form? Aware/unaware can only be talked
about entity where pramAtR^itva is admitted.

Hence your starting position of Jivatman distinct from shuddhAtman stands
on loose grounds.

Are you admitting this fundamental adhyaasa (of prana, mind, senses) on
shuddhAtman? If yes, then my earlier objection remains. When pramAtR^itva
is denied in (shuddha)Atman, how could you claim this first adhyAsa? Also
this leads to a position that shuddhAtman has avidya even before you talk
about Jivatman.

In Advaita, jnAnam has not been used in sadrUpa, but in a negative form as
"not having ajnAna" etc. Reasoning you provide for your conclusion is not
valid.

 It is in this sense that Shankaracharya has said

In my limited understanding pramAtR^itva in Atman is denied to avoid
kartu-karma virOdha (to avoid duality) in Atman. I am arguing that the very
jIvabhAva in Atman is impossible unless a fundamental adhyAsa is admitted
in (shuddh)Atman.

Are we saying just as scary dream scene wakes the dreamer up, so also
Shruti **could** wake Jivatman from his avidya? Are we speculating or do we
know for sure? If the former, then it is a speculative philosophy. If
later, why are still debating in this vyavahAra as knowing it wakes for
sure puts us in paaramArthika reality already!

Whatever the case may be, the knowledge about waking up due to a scary
dream tiger is after the fact and realized in a waking state only. After
waking up can you deny the reality of the very dream state itself? In the
same way, can you offer to admit duality of state when in pAramArtha?

So also, the idea of paaramarthika-vyavaharika states is equally false from
this very state in which we are debating!

 Well, the so called non-dual paramarthika state is still not established.

You cannot establish vyavahara unless you admit fundamental adhyAsa in
shuddha Atma. You cannot posit adhyAsa unless Jiva bhAva and vyavahara is
admitted on Atman. This is exactly called anyOnashrya.
