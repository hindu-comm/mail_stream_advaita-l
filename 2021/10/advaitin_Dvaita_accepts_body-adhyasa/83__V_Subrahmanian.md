In Madhvacharya's view, this shruti means: He who perceives the difference
between Vishnu and his avatara forms, Vishnu and his various body parts,
Vishnu and his guna-s, will forever remain in samsara.  By extension,
whoever equates other gods with Vishnu or holds other gods to be higher
than Vishnu also meet the same fate.
