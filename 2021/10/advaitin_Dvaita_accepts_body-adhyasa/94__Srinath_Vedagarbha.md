What exactly do you mean by the term "support" in your above question?

Are you looking for how Dvaitins provide any evidence(pramANa) in support
of their position (of pramANas are real)?

Whatever pramaNas Dvaitins may give you, they must necessarily be valid and
existing. Otherwise how can you possibly accept them, right? If so,
providing such real and valid pramANas itself proves their pramEya that
"pramANas are real" irrespective of the details of such provided pramANas :)

Anyways, Dvaitin's support is also from shruti  -- Satya Aatmaa, satyo
jiivaha, satyam bhidaa satyam bhidaa satyam bhidaa," among many others
regarding satyatva of jagat.

Please note, since Dvaitin's position is that of 'pramANa-s are real',
their quoting of Shruti, which itself a pramANa, and its reality status
does not run counter to each other. In other words, pramEya and pramANa are
of the same reality status. This is not the case with  Advaita. Their
pramEya (that pramNa-pramEya-pramAtR^itva are avidya kruta and hence
unreal) is counter to the reality status of the very evidence being used in
the process.
