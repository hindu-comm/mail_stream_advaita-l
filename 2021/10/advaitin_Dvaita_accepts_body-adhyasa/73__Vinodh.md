That it is a necessity seems to conclusion of the Adhyaasa Bhashya. Please
refer to the following quote which I had posted earlier in this thread from
a lecture by Sri. Mani Dravid Shastri:

Quote: "It has been established that there is mutual superimposition
between the self which is pure consciousness, and the not-self consisting
of the body, mind and senses. ***Such a superimposition is essential for a
jiva to become a knower (pramaataa).*** Only if the jiva becomes a
pramaataa he can experience objects through the sense-organs. Only then he
becomes a seer, hearer, thinker, etc. Even for the Saastra to be applicable
there has to be superimposition. For performing the rituals laid down in
the Vedas for attaining heaven the person should know that there is a
self which is different from the gross body and which will continue after
death. But he need not know the real nature of the self as described in
Vedanta. If he knows the real nature of the self it will be an obstacle to
his performing the rituals laid down in the Vedas because there is nothing
to be attained by such a person. Rituals are laid down based on caste such
as Brahmana, etc., ashrama, age, etc. So a person has to identify himself
as a Brahmana or a grihasta, etc., to perform rituals. All these relate to
the body. Such identification is possible only if there is adhyaasa of the
body on the self."

Any feedback is always welcome especially when substantiated with proper
supporting arguments. Unfortunately, however, a pointer to a large body of
work does not help me much because it is equivalent to saying that the
needle one is looking for is in a big haystack (in this case, the needle
being an analogy to an answer to the question at hand, and the haystack
being the prastana trayi and its bhashyas).

I am, of course, putting in the effort that my limited mind and intellect
can afford to go through the haystack and find the needle. However, when I
say that I have not found the needle yet (i.e., I have not found an answer
to my question yet), it neither implies that I have not been digging the
haystack nor that I have reached the conclusion that the needle does not
exist in the haystack. It just means that I am having trouble finding it
yet and am therefore asking the help of people who may be able to find and
show me the needle (beyond just pointing to the haystack).

Having said this, I believe I may have possibly found the needle (i.e., the
answer to the question on the assertion of falsehood of the body-mind in
the waking state) in Gaudapada's kaarikas. I have started another thread on
this. I would greatly appreciate additional comments on that, for example,
examples of other places where similar conclusions have been arrived at in
the prasthana trayi bhashyas, or of possible counterarguments by other
schools of thought. 🙏
