No it is correct.

In Dvaita 'Atma' shabda primarily denotes ParaBrahman only.

In fact Br.U  asks this question quite explicitly `katama aatmEti'?

The same Upanishad answers in the same breath that ;

 yOayAm vijnAna maya prANEshu hridyAnta jyOtirtiH | purushaH sa samAnaH san
ubhoU lOkoU anusaMcharati | dhyAtIva |
lElAyativa | sa hi swapnO bhUtvEmaM lOkamati kramati mrutyO rUpANi ||

Whomever is pUrNa-jnAna-svarUpa and residing in heart and instigating from
within etc. etc, is "Atma"

Other schools say this laxaNa is tatastha laxaNa and sweeps away
Upanishadic assertion. But that is not correct. Upanishad is defining the
term "Atma" for its own question about Who is Atama, and laxaNa-s given in
the answer must necessarily be svarUpa laxaNa-s. Otherwise Upanishadic
definition becomes unprecise.

Madhva quotes another pramANa to support this idea:

 AtatatvAchha mAtrutvAdAtmEti paramO hariH |
AtmA bhAsAstadanyE tu na heYtEShAM tatA guNAH ||
-iti paramOshanishadi

Hari is called 'Atma' because He is vyApta and nirmAta of this jagat. Since
all other beings do not have such qualities, they are called amukhya Atma.
This is said in param upanishad.

Therefore, in Dvaita 'Atma' means paramAtma only. They distinguish jiva by
the term 'jivAtma' or simply 'jIva"

Dvita does not say Atma has 'svarupa deha'. The idea of Svarupa-deha is a
contradiction in terms. "dEha" generally means which has origin,
destruction etc., whereas "svarUpa" means self same nature. Therefore,
Dvaita holds jIva has self-same nature (svarUpa) of unique aprkrita guNa-s.

I can understand for Advains it is difficult to understand how could a
chaitanya tatva can have pramatrutva. iccha, jnAna, kriya etc etc guNa-s
without having some sort of dEha. This difficulty is due to the fact that
in their siddhAnta they have not accepted any guNa-s to chaitanya tatva.
But in Dvaita it is not that way. Both Paramatma and Jivatma are accepted
as having svarUpa guNa-s, albeit in various qualitative and quantitative
scales.

Not quite correct.

Independent and dependent realities are absolutely real in Dvaita.

Duality of pAramArthika and vyavahArika itself is mithya and vyavahArika.
Speaking from reality perspective there is not even such biforgation. Some
advaitins think in temporal sense that one was in vyavahArika earlier and
after reaching pAramArthika the vyavahArika gets sublated. That is not
correct. vyavahArika avastha is subject of trikAlika niSheda
