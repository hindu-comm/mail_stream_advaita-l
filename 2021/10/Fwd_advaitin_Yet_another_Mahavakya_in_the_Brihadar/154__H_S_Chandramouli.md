Namaste.

I did not say that there can be no pratibandhas to the rise of jnAna after
mahAvAkya shravaNam. In fact most of the times, such pratibandhas do
obstruct the rise of jnana. Sri Bhasgavatpada himself mentions it in BSB
4-1-1 that repetitive shravana/manana/nididhyasana  is required  to be
carried out till the rise of  aparoksha jnAna. SamskAra is not mentioned.
