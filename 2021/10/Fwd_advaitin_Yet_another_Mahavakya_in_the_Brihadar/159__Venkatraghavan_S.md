Namaste,
The answer to that question was I don't recall any such reference.
However I thought you went on to conclude from such a (possible) absence
that aparoksha jnAna was therefore not possible from a recollection.
If you are instead not saying that, I don't think there is any argument
here.

Regards
Venkatraghavan
