This position is not very sound. Jnana is a vritti. If it arises it will be
definitely known by the sadhaka. And that would mean that is his last
birth. Unless his is a case of aadhikarika purusha, he will not be born
again. But here we have Vamadeva already in the womb. That means the avidya
nivartaka jnanam had not arisen before. And it arose only now in the womb
as is clear from his declaring his sarvatmatva like ahamannam..of the
Taittiriya.
