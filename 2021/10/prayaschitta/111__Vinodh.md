Namaskaram Sri Kaushik,

Thank you for sharing this excerpt on prayaschitta from the Vishnu purana.

It is the Paramatma who controls and engages the entire world while still
retaining his atma-svaroopa-jnana. Therefore He is indeed the one who can
expiate all sins including the biggest sin of all, forgetting the true
nature of our Atma, and grant eternal freedom by bestowing jnana to the
jiva.

It is therefore a great opportunity for reminding ourselves of the Lord
every Ekadashi through fasting and refraining from indulging in
sense-objects, and by meditating on Sri Hari.

Om namo narayanaya 🙏
