Namaste
I was asked a question - who were the mantradraShTas of the hymns extolling
the Vedic Goddess in sUktas about her various forms like Shrii, Savitri,
Ushas, Ambika, Ambalika etc., other than Vishvamitra.

Also the Devi Sukta is expressed in the first person. Is a Rishi's name
included?

Om

Raghav
