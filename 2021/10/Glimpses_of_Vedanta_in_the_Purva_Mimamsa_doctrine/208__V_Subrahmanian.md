In the Jaimini doctrine one can see many Upanishadic passages cited. The
two seminal texts of this system, Kumarila Bhatta's 'Tantra Vartika' and
'Shloka Vartika' too one encounters passages from the Vedanta.

Commentary to Tantra Vartika, 'Nyaya Sudah' of Bhatta Someshwara, too has
discussed the Vedantic concepts of Saguna and Nirguna Brahman and their
application in the Mimamsa doctrine.

So also the 'Mimamsa shastra kutuhala' of Kamalakara Bhatta too cites
Kumarila Bhatta so conclude that the moksha of this doctrine is
non-different from that of the Vedanta.

Also, Sri Ayyanna Dikshita in his 'Vyasa Tatparya Nirnaya' has cited the
Shloka Vartika and Parthasarathy Misra's 'Shastra Dipika' to emphasise that
the Mimamsa doctrine has considered Advaita alone as their Vedantic
opponent and rejected it.
