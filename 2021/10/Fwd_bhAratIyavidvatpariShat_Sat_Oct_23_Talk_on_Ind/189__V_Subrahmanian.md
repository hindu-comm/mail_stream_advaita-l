Dear all,

This talk being hosted by the London Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan may be of
interest to some of you. There will also be another talk by the same
speaker on October 30, and its link will be circulated closer to the date.

*Title*: Indian Mathematical Heritage: A Broad Overview
*When: *7:30pm Sat 23 Oct 2021
*Link*: Facebook Live
https://www.facebook.com/events/406957971025767?ref=newsfeed

*About the Speaker*:
Dr K. Ramasubramanian is the Institute Chair Professor at the Department of
Humanities and Social Sciences, IIT Bombay. He holds a doctorate in
theoretical physics, and is the world’s pre-eminent expert on India’s
mathematical and astronomical heritage. His books and articles have brought
to light the non-trivial mathematics produced by the Kerala school of
mathematics in texts such as Ganita-Yukti-Bhasha, Karana-paddhati and
Tantra-sangraha.
He is a recipient of the prestigious presidential award Maharshi Badarayan
Vyas Samman (2008), and more recently, has been invited to give a
distinguished lecture at the International Congress of Mathematicians
(2022) which, for mathematicians, is said to be equivalent to “induction to
a hall of fame.”
The Shankaracharya of the Sringeri Sharada Peetham has also recognised his
scholarship in Advaita Vedanta with the title “Vidvat Pravara.”
