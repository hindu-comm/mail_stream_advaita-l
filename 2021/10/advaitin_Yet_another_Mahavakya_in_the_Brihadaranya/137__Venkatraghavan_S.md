Because the mantra is स वा एष महानज आत्मा योऽयं विज्ञानमयः is essentially
so'yam - ie conveying the identity of sah with ayam. sah (He), mahAn (the
Great), ajah (Unborn one), which refers to Brahman, is the same as ayam
vijnAnamayah, this conscious jIva.

No meditation is necessary, knowing the truth that jIva is Brahman is
sufficient.  A mahAvAkya does not convey a meditation, it simply reveals
that the jIva is Brahman.
