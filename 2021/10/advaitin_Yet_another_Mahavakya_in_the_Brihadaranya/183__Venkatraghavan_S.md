Namaste Vinodh ji,

The act of shravaNa can also be subject to a vidhi - how should one listen,
what should they be wearing, how they should be seated, from whom should
one listen etc (also see Sri Chandramouli's references from the
bRhadAraNyaka bhAShya vArttika), but once the shabda is heard, it
automatically leads to knowledge - there can be no vidhi in shabda pramANa
leading to knowledge.

The jijnAsA in the first sUtra is not a jnAna vidhi, rather the word
jijnAsA is interpreted by lakshaNa to mean enquiry, vichAra. That is, the
sUtra means one must enquire into vedAntic sentences that talk of Brahman.
This is precisely because there can be no vidhi in relation to a desire,
let alone a desire to know. One cannot enjoin "you must like this".

In the advaita siddhi, this is stated thus:

जिज्ञासापदे तु ज्ञाधातुनेष्यमाणज्ञानलक्षणाङ्गीकारानङ्गीकारमतभेदेऽपि
सन्प्रत्ययस्य विचारे जहल्लक्षणाभ्युपगमस्योभयत्र तुल्यत्वात्
शक्यार्थपरित्यागेऽपि विधितात्पर्यनिर्वाहात् नामुख्यार्थत्वम्
In the term *jijnAsa*, even though there are two schools of thought
regarding whether it is knowledge that is denoted by the root "*jna*",
based on whether knowledge is capable or not capable of being the object of
desire, both schools accept that the suffix "*san*" is interpreted by
jahallakshaNA to mean vichAra, enquiry. Therefore, even where the primary
*denotation* is given up, as this is done to preserve the import of the
injunction, this does not mean that the primary *meaning* is renounced.

Hence the meaning of brahmajijnAsA kartavyA is brahmavichAra: kartavyah.

Regards,
Venkatraghavan
