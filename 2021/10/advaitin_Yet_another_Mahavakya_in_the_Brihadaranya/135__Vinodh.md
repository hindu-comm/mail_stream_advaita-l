Namaskaram,

Thank you for sharing this "mahavakya".

This brings up the following question in my mind: what makes a vakya a
"mahavakya"?

For example, the Taittiriya Upanishad contains something very similar to
what is described in the vakya mentioned above in two different places:

In Sikshavalli, 6th Anuvaka:
sa ya eṣo'ntarhṛdaya ākāśaḥ | tasminnayaṃ puruṣo manomayaḥ | amṛto
hiraṇmayaḥ || 1 ||
स य एषोऽन्तर्हृदय आकाशः । तस्मिन्नयं पुरुषो मनोमयः । अमृतो हिरण्मयः ॥ १ ॥
1. Here, in this bright space within the heart, is He, that Soul who is
formed of thought, undying, full of light.

In Brahmanandavalli, 1st Anuvaka:
तदेषाऽभ्युक्ता । सत्यं ज्ञानमनन्तं ब्रह्म ॥ २ ॥
tadeṣā'bhyuktā | satyaṃ jñānamanantaṃ brahma || 2 ||
2. On that, this has been chanted: “Real, Consciousness, Infinite is
Brahman;....”

“ .... यो वेद निहितं गुहायां परमे व्योमन् । सोऽश्नुते सर्वान् कामान् सह ।
ब्रह्मणा विपश्चिता ॥” इति ॥ २ ॥
“ .... yo veda nihitaṃ guhāyāṃ parame vyoman | so'śnute sarvān kāmān saha |
brahmaṇā vipaścitā ||” iti || 2 ||
2. “....Whoso knoweth the one hid in the cave in the highest heaven attains
all desires together, as Brahman, as the Wise.”

Similar to the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad mantra 4.4.22, the above two also
describe the Purusha hidden inside the space (cave) of the heart
(hrdaya-akasha). Likewise, one of them (from Sikshavalli) describes this
Purusha as being manomaya and the other (from Brahmanandavalli) says jnanam
is a defining characteristic of Brahman, and these two descriptions appear
to be equivalent to the part about the Jiva being vijnanamaya in the quote
from Br. Up because they talk about the this Purusha or Brahman having the
fundamental characteristic of consciousness (because of which it is
manomaya or vijnanamaya and can cognize things (jnanam)). Therefore, both
the above vaakyas from the Taittiriya Upanishad are also essentially
pointing to the conscious entity that is in the hrdaya-akasha.
