Namaste

But in waking state we can reflect on dream state and say dream objects are
not real. This explanation of yours in the email is in waking state only,
But conversely we do not reflect in dream state on waking state and say
waking objects are not real. The Sruti only can tell us waking objects are
not real. It is not possible by reasoning alone. If it is possible  by
reasoning alone there is no need of Sruti Pramana. This is not the way of
Advaita.
