Namaste

A friend in Karnataka is desirous of studying the Srimad Bhagavata Purana
with Sridhara Swamin's commentary.  If there is anyone who could teach him,
even online, in Hindi / Sanskrit/ English, please give contact details.  He
is most comfortable with Kannada though.  There will be a reasonable Guru
Dakshina.  Thanks.
