Namaskaram Sri Subbu ji,

Thank you for sharing this. While a quote from Vivekachudamani was given in
the other thread where the word “mahavakya” was used in the popular
Vedantic sense, some (like Sri Satchidanandendra Saraswathi) question
whether the author of the work was actually Shankara Bhagavadpada. It is
therefore worth noting that there is another (possible) occurrence in
Aitareya Upanishad bhashya.

Would you be able to give a brief explanation of the context in which this
occurs in Aitareya Upanishad bhashya and how the popular Vedantic meaning
might fit in this context?
