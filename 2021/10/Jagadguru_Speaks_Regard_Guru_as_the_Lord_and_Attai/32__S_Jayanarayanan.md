Man's samskaras (impressions and innate tendencies) take root
in his mind right from his birth and are always present in a
subtle form. They manifest only at the appropriate time. For
certain people, sattvic (noble) traits like devotion towards the
Lord, faith in performing one's ordained karmas (actions) and
respect for the elderly will manifest right from childhood. Such
people tend to go to the temple everyday and, with age, they
develop an inclination towards reading sacred texts like the
Bhagavad Gita. Alongside this, by their good fortune, they will
also gain the association of noble people (satsanga). For the
satsanga to grow further, the Lord will in due course bless such
people with a Guru.

It is essential that a person serves this Jnana-Guru (Teacher
who bestows the Supreme Knowledge) and considers the Guru
verily as the Lord Himself. He must understand that the
Trimurtis - Lord Brahma, Lord Vishnu and Lord Mahesvara - are
manifest in the form of his Guru. One must never harbour the
notion that the Guru is an ordinary mortal.

This is what the Lord has stated in the Srimad Bhagavatam:

  AchAryaM mAM vijAnIyAnnAvanmanyeta karhichit .
  na martyabuddhyAsUyeta sarvadevamayo guruH ..

It means that the Guru must be regarded as the Lord. One
must never insult the Guru. One must never regard the Guru as
an ordinary mortal and harbour feelings of jealousy towards
Him (one must never engage in foisting faults upon the Guru).
This is because the Guru is the embodiment of all divinity.

Our blessings for everyone to understand this well, be a recipient
of the Guru's upadesa (instruction) and progress in life.
