whenever I chant veda maNtra-s publicly using mic , whenever I hear recordings of gAyatri maNtra and other veda sUkta / maNtra-s, public discourses like geeta jnAna yagna,  vedAnta in loud speakers etc. I do have a doubt that can it be made public without taking proper care of adhikAra??  vedAnta is guhya vidyA should not be taught to anadhikAri-s reiterates saMpradAya, bhAshyakAra says before taking up brahmavidyA jignAsa sAdhana chatushtaya is must,  lord too says in geeta idam te nAtapaskAya, nA bhaktAya kadAchana, should not be taught to the one who is not serving his guru etc. because this vidyA is paramaM guhyaM.  But what we are seeing today??  all veda-vedAnta geeta available to all openly irrespective of adhikAra.   we are making it proudly  public.  Is this relaxation allowed in the current situation (kAladharma) ??  Just curious to know the traditional clarification with regard to this.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
