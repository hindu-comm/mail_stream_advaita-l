praNAms Sri Kaushik prabhuji
Hare Krishna

Perhaps this would be the reason nowadays, with an unwritten relaxation with respect to vidhi-nishedha (injunction and prohibition) of ancient smruti texts,  modern religious / spiritual institutions (like Arsha vidya, Chinmaya mission, RK math etc.)  are openly teaching veda-vedAnta to stree, non-dvija-s and even initiating them to sannyasa giving them the new Ashrama bound names etc.
Its important to note that none of the traditional maths do that. Of course bakthi is a must for all.


Ã˜     Yes, but the fact remains that even from the traditional maths, there is no official caution  against these practices in other institutions.  OTOH, the Acharya-s of other institutions have been facilitated at traditional mutts for their services with regard to upholding the sanAtana dharma and vedAnta prachAra as if vaidika karmAnushTAna, adherence to the shAstra vihita vidhi-nishedha etc. nothing to do with veda-vedAnta prachAra !! Not blaming any traditional mutt for this just sharing the observation.


Now the question is, is this a welcome sign or further deterioration of varNa system??
This is a much complicated question. When sva-dharma is abandoned the role of varna isnt present anymore.
Its better to stick to ones own varna duties as krishna says in geeta.


Ã˜     Svadharme nidhanaM shreyaH, paradharmO bhayAvahaH, yatshAstravidhimrutsujya vartate kAmakArataH â€¦na sukhM na parAmgatim warns Lord in geeta but shAstra has become obsolete nowadays and plenty of logical justification too available in defense ðŸ˜Š

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
