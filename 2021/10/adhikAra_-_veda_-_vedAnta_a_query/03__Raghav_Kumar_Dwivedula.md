Yes. The question is how to appropriately interpret older rules to decide
adhikAritvam for reciting Vedas in today's global village context .

For example, the literal "Quranic" type of interpretation of who is allowed
to recite the vedas will render vedic recitation as prohibited practically
for all those who are living outside the Indian subcontinent. This means
that all NRIs cannot recite the vedas since they have caught a flight over
the seas.

Luckily such a nonsensical interpretation is not endorsed by Sringeri Math
which allows NRI dvijas the same treatment as other dvijas.

Intelligent interpretation is mandatory to avoid wahabi type of literalism-
that does not mean 'reform', which implies a needlessly condescending
attitude towards the smritis.
