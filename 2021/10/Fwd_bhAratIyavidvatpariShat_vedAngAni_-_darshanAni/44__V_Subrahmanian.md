नमो विद्वद्भ्यः

Here are the lectures , in Telugu on all Vedangas and Darsanas , as well as
Dasasantis recited by me during 2006 in Munganda (Munikhanda) Agraharam ,
the birthplace of Jagannathapanditaraja .
Forgive - I am a fast speaker - followed  rather द्रुतवृत्ति । Wish should
have been in मध्यमावृत्ति ।

शुभम् भूयात्
