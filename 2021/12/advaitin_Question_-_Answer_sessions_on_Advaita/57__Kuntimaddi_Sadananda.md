Shree Subbuji has posted several cites for Question-Answer Sessions on Advaita, in Kannada.
In support of this topic, just want to mention that we have done question-answer sessions on you-tube, uploaded by the Indic Academy. These talks are in English and cover many questions. Efforts were made to limit the time to 8 to 10 min in answering each question.
Hari Om!
