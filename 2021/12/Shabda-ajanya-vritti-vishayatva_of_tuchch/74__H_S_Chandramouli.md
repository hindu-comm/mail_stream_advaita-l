Namaste Sudhanshu Ji,

I am referring back to your initial post and copying here

<< Having said this - when the discussion starts subsequently with यद्वा --
the tIkA presents couple of anumAna to show that tuchchha is vishaya of
anumAna-janya-vritti also and is not merely the vishaya of
shabda-janya-vritti. And then goes on to refine the definition of
drishyatva. The anunAna are -

तुच्छं वृत्तिविषयः, व्यवह्रियमाणत्वात्, घटादिवत्।
तुच्छं न क्षणिकम्, अकारणत्वात्, ब्रह्मवत्।  >>

Which is the refined  definition of drishyatva you are referring to. Please
clarify

Regards
