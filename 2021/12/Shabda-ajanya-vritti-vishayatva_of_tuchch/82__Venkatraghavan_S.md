This is the argument that the opponent makes against us - we accept that
tucCha is asat. So he will say - you advaitins agree that tucCha is asat
and also agree that it has kAraNatva abhAva. So such an anumAna can be
directed against the advaitin.

The abhAva being bhAvAtmaka is acceptable to us, but not the opponent. So
Shankaracharya's bhAShya cannot be invoked as support for it when directing
the argument against such an opponent.

Yes both are mithyA, but daNDa is vyAvahArika, Devadatta is prAtibhAsika.
So on that basis, the former is certainly of a higher order than the
latter. This approach has been taken in the dvitIyamithyAtva chapter.
