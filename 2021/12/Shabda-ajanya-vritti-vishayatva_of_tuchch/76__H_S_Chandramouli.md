Namaste Sudhanshu Ji,

The quote from the tIka you have presented in your initial post

<<  तुच्छं वृत्तिविषयः, व्यवह्रियमाणत्वात्, घटादिवत्।
तुच्छं न क्षणिकम्, अकारणत्वात्, ब्रह्मवत् >>

actually  reads in full, in the tIka, as

<<  ननूक्तशब्देनेव तुच्छं वृत्तिविषयः; व्यवह्रियमाणत्वात्,
तुच्छं न क्षणिकम्; अकारणत्वात्, इत्य्द्यनुमानेनापि  तुच्छं  ज्ञाप्यते,
तत्राह--*यद्वेति ।* *कश्चिद्धर्म  इति* । ग्राह्य इति शेषः। >>.

I would understand from this that the tIka presents the anumAna  stated
above as a possible  pUrva paksha,  and mentions that the same is refuted
in Advaita Siddhi itself by the further clarification  on the previous
definition  namely <<  शब्दाजन्यवृत्तिविषयत्वमेव दृश्यत्वम्  >>  by the
statement

<<  सप्रकारकवृत्तिविषयत्वम् >>.

Regards
