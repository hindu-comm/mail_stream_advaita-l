Venkataraghavan ji,

तुच्छं न क्षणिकम्, अकारणत्वात्, ब्रह्मवत्।

Is shasha-vishANa an object of vritti janya by this anumAna?

Laghuchandrika makes that statement for
sat-tAdAtmya-asat-tAdAtmya-anyataravatva (a little later). In this context
of anumAna-vritti-janya-vishayatva, it does not make that statement. That's
why I got confused.

Regards.
