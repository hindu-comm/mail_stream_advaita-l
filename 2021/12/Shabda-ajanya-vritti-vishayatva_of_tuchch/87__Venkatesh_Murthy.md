Namaste

Nowadays with modern medicine Vandhya Suta is not Asat person. The barren
woman can use fertility treatment or use a surrogate mother to get a son.

Vandhya Putra can be a Vyaharika Vastu today. Tomorrow the genetic
technology may allow horn to be grown on a rabbit. Then Shasha Shringa also
will become a Vyavaharika Vastu and not Asat Vastu.

>From Paramarthika Drishti there is no Asat. There is only Sat.
