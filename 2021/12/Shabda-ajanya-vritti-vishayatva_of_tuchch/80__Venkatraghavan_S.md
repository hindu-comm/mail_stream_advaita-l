I agree.

So their abhAva, akAraNatva and akshaNikatva will be bhAvarUpa mithyA only

kAraNatva abhAva need not be mithyA. shuddha brahma has kAraNatva abhAva,
but it is sat, not mithyA.

tucCha also has kAraNatva abhAva, but it is asat, not mithyA.

Similarly akshaNikatva. shuddha brahma has akshaNikatva, but it is not
mithyA. Similarly tucCha - it is akshaNikam, but asat, not mithyA.

Taking a step back: the rule that if there is an object with a particular
order of reality, its attribute must be of the same order of reality is not
a valid one in my opinion.

A vyAvahArika shukti can have prAtibhAsika rajatatva. The pAramArthika
brahma has vyAvahArika sarvajnatva / vyAvahArika kincijjnatva.

To this, if it is said that in the cases presented, the substance is of a
higher order of reality and the attribute is of a lower order of reality
whereas in our prakaraNa, we are discussing asat (substance) can have or
cannot have akAraNatva (attribute), which for the sake of argument, let us
assume is mithyA (let us also assume that mithyA is notionally higher than
asat), the reply would be:

What about the bhrama, daNDI devadattah, when it is daNDI yajnadattah in
reality? The substance (Devadatta) is incorrect (mithyA), but the attribute
(daNDa) is correct (satya).

So, even if akAraNatva was mithyA why cannot it be said to be present in
tucCha?

Not sure if I have understood your intention correctly, but presented my
prima facie review of the argument presented. If I have misunderstood,
please clarify.
