This is a Maha Shiva Ratri series describing the various pastimes of Lord
Shiva from the Puranas. This video talks about various references from the
scriptures on how Lord Shiva & Shaiva Puranas are Shuddha Sattva (pure mode
of goodness - beyond Sattva, Rajas, Tamas) and also talks about references
where Vaishnava Puranas are considered as Tamasic. It also talks about how
to understand the Vedas & Upanishads with the help of Puranas.
