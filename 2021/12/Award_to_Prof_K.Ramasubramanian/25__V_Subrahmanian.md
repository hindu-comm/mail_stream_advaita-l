#GreatNews Prof. K. Ramasubramanian has been announced as the recepient of
the prestigious "Mahakavi Kalidas Sanskrit-Vrati National Award" by Kavi
Kulaguru Kalidas Sanskrit University.

As a world-class Researcher at the Cell for Indian Sciences and Technology
in Sanskrit, IIT Bombay, Prof. Ramasubramnian brought out path-breaking
acclaimed monographs such as Gaṇita-Yukti-Bhāṣā, Tantrasaṅgraha,
Karaṇapaddhati and Lagnaprakaraṇa which revealed the genius of Indian
mathematicians in modelling planetary motion with advanced algorithms,
centuries ahead of their European counterparts.

I am blessed to be a first-person witness to Prof. Ramasubramanian's
incredible contributions in bringing out the scientific literature in
poetic Sanskrit texts. In fact, the most prestigious confluence of
Mathematicians at the once-in-four-years ICM 2022 have honored Prof.
Ramasubramnian by inviting him for a special lecture on the "Birth of
Calculus" in India.
