Pranam to all advaitins.I am unable to find commentary on verses 32 to 46 of this text. I am looking for the Sanskrit with the sandhi separated and commentary on those verses. All the ones i have end with verse 31 or even earlier.I dont know if there is a reason why this is so.Please help.Thank you.Soma
