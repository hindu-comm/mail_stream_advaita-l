Thank you, Subbu Ji.
This appears to be a scanned copy of an old text. Unfortunately I cannot handle a full commentary is Sanskrit! I can barely get through the verses with help, which I have done with the 32.
If you find those verses with Commentary in English, Tamil, or HIndi please let me know.

This has all the 46 verses with a Sanskrit commentary but the word split is not there.
