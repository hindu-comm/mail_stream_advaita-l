Thank you, Satyan.
That was a lot of work and very useful for me. Thank you for sharing it.
But I am also looking for a commentary on those verses. for 36 to 46. I am puzzled why those are being ignored.

Namaste Soma-ji,

I had done the sandhis for the 46 verses of DDV sometime back. Please see the spreadsheet here.

Regards,
--Satyan
PS:This includes references to pANini's sutras for each sandhi. You can ignore that part.
Also, in the pANini system, you will find a 'sa' instead of a visarga as that is the starting point in pANini.

Pranam to all advaitins.I am unable to find commentary on verses 32 to 46 of this text. I am looking for the Sanskrit with the sandhi separated and commentary on those verses. All the ones i have end with verse 31 or even earlier.I dont know if there is a reason why this is so.Please help.Thank you.Soma
