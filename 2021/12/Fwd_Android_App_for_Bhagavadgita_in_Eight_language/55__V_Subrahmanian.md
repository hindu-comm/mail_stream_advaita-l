Bhagavad Gita App in Eight scripts along with the Commentary of
Shankaracharya
‘Bhuma Labs’ is engaged in several projects with the view of propagating
Sanskrit literature. The production of Apps in Sanskrit is one such
initiative.
Bhuma Labs has as of now brought out five Apps on the Prasthana Traya
Bhashyas of Shankaracharya, the Vedanta Paribhasha and the Vedanta sara.
The new Gita App has the unique feature of enabling reading the Gita verses
in eight scripts of Devanagari, Kannada, Tamil, Malayalam, Telugu,
Gujarati, Bengali and Oriya.
Also, along with each shloka is appended the Bhashya of Shankaracharya so
that the seekers of knowledge are equipped with the meaning of the verses
then and there.
The searching of any word of the Gita is easily and quickly possible in the
App.
It is our fervent appeal that all benefit from the App by using it
extensively. The message may be conveyed widely in various forums. The App
is a wonderful device to the students of Sanskrit in Pathashalas,
Gurukulas, Schools and Universities.
