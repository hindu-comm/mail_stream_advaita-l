Bhaskararaya (Bhāskararāya Makhin) (1690–1785) in his commentary
'Soubhagyabhaskara' to the Lalita Sahasra Nama, to the nama 'Parashakti'
cites a line from the Shiva Bhujana Stotram and says that this is authored
by Bhagavatpada. पराशक्तिमित्रं नुमः पञ्चवक्त्रमिति
भगवत्पादानां प्रयोगाद्यद्येकं पदं तदा पराशक्त्यै नम इत्येव प्रयुज्यताम् |

    From this we can infer that this work was popularly known/accepted as
that of Shankaracharya even in the 18 Century and surely before that too.
