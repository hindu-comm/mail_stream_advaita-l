If you are having problems of any sort with the list, do not post here; 
the members cannot help you! Either contact me directly at 
jaldhar at braincells.com or listmaster at advaita-vedanta.org (preferable) and 
I'll try to assist as I can.

I've contacted Kameshwararaoji off-list.

Subject: Request to Moderators

Dear Moderators,
               Out of electronic harasment from many years,
I took a decission to lodge a cyber complaint from a person who takes the
name of many peoples of our list and writes mails with this following
address to me and mentions his name as siva/kumar/peri ramesh/jaya kumar/
Ramana...etc and calls my home by taking the names of many
moderators/members of our list.

His main worry that he mentions to me that he is the son of his Guruvu garu
and he will take care of him. No problem what ever he is & he does, how it
matters and his extra enthusiastic calls/mails distrubs heavily my routine
life.

May I request the moderators to stop this type of 'Haterism' among the
vauous disiciples and looks he works at AP secretrait. Out of many mail
address which he writes and one e mail address is given below is not from
the list.  "peri_1311 at yahoo.co.in".

Any further communcation from this person electronically/telephonically/or
by any means will be viewed seriously and necessary legal action will be
taking place and already measures have been taken care.

Sri Guru Padaravindarpana Mastu
Kameswara
