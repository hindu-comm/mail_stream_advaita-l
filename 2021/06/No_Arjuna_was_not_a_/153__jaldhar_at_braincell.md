Perhaps Arjuna even did understand for a little while but due to his lack 
of vairagya and the resulting sannyasa he didn't become jnananishta.

He did say so.  In the Anugitabhashya.

See now you're just making things up.  This is a list for Advaita Vedanta 
not random speculation by illiterates.  The only reason you've been 
tolerated this long because you atleast try to back up your assertions 
with rational arguments.  Not very good ones but I don't hold that against 
you as everyone has to start somewhere.  But if you are just going to spew 
random opinions you can do it somewhere else.

For other readers I should just like to note that nowhere in the text I 
quoted does it say that Krishna Bhagavan lacks the yogic power but only 
that he says he can't or won't use it at that particular time.
