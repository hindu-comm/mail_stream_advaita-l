 Dear Sri Manu Kashyap,
What is Moksha?In the words of Sri Shankara :(1) nityatvAt mOkShasya, sAdhakasvarUpAvyatirEkAcca ||

( 2) brahmaiva hi muktyavasthA ||
(3) svAtmanyavasthAnam mOkSha iti ||
It may please be noted that Mandukya Upanishad says thus :sarvagaM hi Etadbrahma , ayamAtmA brahma|| Mantra 2

Moksha is your true svarUpa which is here and now.
To teach this simple truth why Rs. 4000/- should be charged?What is the basis fir it?
It is amazing.Kindly pardon me for sharing my thoughts which arose when I was going through your posting. 
Please correct me if I am wrong in this way of thinking.

With respectful regards,Sreenivasa Murthy.
