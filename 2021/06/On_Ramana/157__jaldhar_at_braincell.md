No it is merely the observation that he did not organize his views in a 
systematic way with tikas, prakaranas etc. with all the attendant 
paraphernalia such as purvapaksha, siddhanta nyayas etc.

I think it goes without saying that he was not shrotriya though as I also 
said, he was immersed in an environment which was more shastra-based than 
most of us can manage now.  As a result his teachings may be based on an 
incomplete understanding of shastras.

He can be a teacher but if I were to be asked I would recommend 
supplementing with other more solid sources.
