I feel that, as shruthi says that a jnani can be worshipped for the
attainment of moksha, this isn't wrong.

Actually swami vivekananda has talked about the different vedanta schools.
He has statated that advaita is the goal and the highest truth, whereas
other schools are stepping stones.

Regarding vivekananda's Statments of other religions. I think it was done
to promote harmony in the society. There were conversions going on at that
time  as well as violence. Not to forget that we were under the British
rule.
Vivekananda has bought a lot of good name and recognition to sanatana
dharma.


I might be wrong, and I am happy if the elders correct me.
