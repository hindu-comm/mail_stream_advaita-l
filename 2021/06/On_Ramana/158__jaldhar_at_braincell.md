Perhaps Bhaskar is refering to an earlier conversation we had once where I 
said that Ramakrishna was a traditional Bengali Tantrik.  Which is 
similar to Advaita Vedanta to be sure but nothing like the full-blown 
interpretation of Advaita Vedanta espoused by his followers in the 
Ramakrishna Mission.
