Namaste Subbuji,

Thank you very much for this mail bringing to my attention Sri Jagadeeswara Sastriji’s commentary on Upadesha Saram. I am in the process of buying this book.

Thank you also for the Youtube link on the release of this book. I immensely enjoyed watching it. More specifically the Video ends with a verse in praise of Ramana with very stanza closing with the refrain 'Ramanam Prapadhye’. I am very much interested in getting the full lyrics of this verse. Can you provide me the same or tell me the possible source from which I can get the same?

Many thanks and regards,
Venkat
