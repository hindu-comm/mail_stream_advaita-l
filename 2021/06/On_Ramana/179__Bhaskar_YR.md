praNAms Sri Ven Balakrishnan prabhuji

The whole point of sruti is to point out what cannot be perceived through other means.  And that pointing is essentially to the fact that you are not what you think you are, that it is all an unreal superimposition.

>  yes to realize this truth what is the ultimate/only means??  That is shabda pramANa, shAstra is the ultimate pramANa (antya pramANa), and the realization of our true svarUpa should happen through shravaNAdi sAdhana has to be done through shAstra only under the able guidance of shrOtreeya brahmanishTa guru. As per bhAshyakAra  Individual experience and teachings / doctrine based on this experience is  not a valid pramANa.  The traditional teaching insists this method of sAdhana which may not be the version of ramaNa's method of self-enquiry. 

Ramanamaharishi says nothing different from that.

> I would like to see where BRM insisted that to know who you are, the shAstra is the ONLY pramANa and means.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
