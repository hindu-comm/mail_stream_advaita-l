Dear Bhaskar-ji

There is an interesting statement in Sankara’s bhasya to BG18.50:

“Therefore what is to be undertaken is only the elimination of the superimposition on Brahman through ignorance, but no effort is needed for knowing Brahman, for It is quite self-evident. It is because the intellect is distracted by particular appearances of name and from imagined through ignorance. . .”

So that is the essence - not a new knowledge to be gained, even one that (theoretically) negates ignorance, but the actual elimination of the superimposition, ultimately of the arising of the ‘me/mine’ thought.  Much of what Sankara says - for example in BG13.2 - is that the teacher should be consistent with sruti; and if not, he is unreliable.

I don’t think I have come across quite such a definitive pronouncement by Sankara as you imply below.  I would be grateful if you would point me to such a comment.

Best wishes,

venkat

>> yes to realize this truth what is the ultimate/only means??  That is shabda pramANa, shAstra is the ultimate pramANa (antya pramANa), and the realization of our true svarUpa should happen through shravaNAdi sAdhana has to be done through shAstra only under the able guidance of shrOtreeya brahmanishTa guru. As per bhAshyakAra  Individual experience and teachings / doctrine based on this experience is  not a valid pramANa.  The traditional teaching insists this method of sAdhana which may not be the version of ramaNa's method of self-enquiry.
