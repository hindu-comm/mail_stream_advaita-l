Dharma sukshma, nuances of dharma, aught to be known only through the words
of the elders.  In the Taittiriya upanishad there is this advice to the
departing student:  When in doubt about conduct in a given situation, seek
the advice of the noble persons 'there' which means 'then' also.  So, time
and place are mentioned here.  The persons who are considered dharmic in
one's place and time should be sought out and asked.  So, an advice by the
Upanishad is here that is valid for all time.  Shankara has said: The
dharma of a particular time and place could well be adharma in another
place and time.  So, the best way is to seek the advice of the noblemen 'in
that place and that time' where/when the person in doubt lives.
