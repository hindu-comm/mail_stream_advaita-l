I quote a passage from the (now unavailable book) The Crest Jewel of Yogis
- First Volume, p.109:

// In fact, it was Paramacharyal (HH Sri Chandrashekhara Bharati
Mahasvamin) who Himself encouraged Acharyal (HH Sri Abhinava Vidyatirtha
Mahasvamin) to take a free and independent line of thinking in such matters
in keeping with the need to cater to a changing and less orthodox society.
.. //

Hence it is the Guru that is most closely available to us at a given
situation and time that has to be consulted in case of need for
clarification and guidance.  Their writings, various incidents of
devotees/seekers with such a Guru, etc will provide us the leads to
solutions to our questions.  Such clarifications could also be
seeker-specific and may not be universal.  This is how these things work.
