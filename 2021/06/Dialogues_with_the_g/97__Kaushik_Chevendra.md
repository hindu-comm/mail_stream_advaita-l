I have tried to find if any discourses were given by present acharyas on
the situation but could not find any.
Shri vidyarirtha swamin has suggested to follow the shastra "to the extent
to which he can". But Shri chandrashekhara bharthi swamin in the above
conversation has stated that there will be negative consequences if shastra
isn't followed, and it's the persons choice wether he wishes to accept the
punishment of isvara or the present law.
