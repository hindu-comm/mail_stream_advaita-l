Wow, you really don't know what "here and there" means!!!  Still I'm 
impressed you manged to travel in time and make a rejoinder to an argument 
from the future.

Glad you asked.  Because I'm not giving my personal view but that of a 
sampradaya that has been teaching this for centuries.

I never bothered with Raman and his teachings myself but I have some 
respect for him/them because people I respect respect them.  But the sole 
reason for discussing his views on a list for Advaita Vedanta is if those 
views are consonant with Advaita Vedanta (which existed long before him.) 
If as you say, he actually wasn't an Advaitin which I find hard to believe 
but if it is true, then his views have no place in advaita-l.

Let it be so, it doesn't change the fact they are not producing new karma 
neither are they part of the web of social relations.

Anyway, I've removed you from the list now.  You can spread your wisdom 
somewhere else.
