Uh YOU suggested it.  You were responding to:

Nothing in that quote implies it is being taken literally.  That is a 
strawman of YOUR creation.

There is a thing called society which is the support for people whos goals 
in life are artha, kama, and preferably dharma.  This is often referred to 
as the world.  For instance the materialistic hedonists of ancient times 
known as Charvakas are also known as Lokayatas, "worldly ones."  There are 
those who renounce this "world."  This is what we refer to as being "dead 
to the world."  You seem to be under the impression that if a word or 
phrase is not used literally it can mean whatever you want.  But in real 
life, human languages have idioms, customary usages etc. which may perhaps 
have fuzzy edges but in general are understood to have specific meanings. 
Everyone seems to understand what "dead to the world" means except you.
I wonder why?

We've been over this before.  Karma is intentional action motivated by 
desire.  Hunger, sleep etc. aren't karma because they are instinctual.  To 
know Brahman, to discuss Brahman and to pass on the knowledge of Brahman 
is not karma because it is not motivated by desire but by abidance in 
Brahman.  These are not "social relations."
