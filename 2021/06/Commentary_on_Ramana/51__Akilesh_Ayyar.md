Yes,

a) I've already said Sankara recommended physical renunciation to his
students. He clearly acknowledges, however, that there are jnanis who have
not renounced. That means physical renunciation cannot be a universal rule
for realization.

b) Sankara's views are clearly to a different audience than Ramana's, and
Sankara's emphasis is different than Ramana's on this point. Again,
*Ramana's* views are very clear on this point. No mention of physical
renunciation in Upadesa Saram, 40 verses and supplement, or Nan Yar. The
opposite of what you're saying in all his talks.

c) You still have not explained why if there is true renunciation of ALL
desires, why jnanis should continue to maintain their bodies.

d) Finally, as Sankara says in his commentary to BG 4.20:

"Actions done by a man of Knowledge are certainly inactions, since he is
endowed with the realization of the actionless Self. Actions together with
their accessories must be relinquished by one who has become thus, because
they have no end to serve. This being so, api, even though; he remains
abhi-pravrttah, engaged as before; karmani, in actions-getting out of those
(actions) being impossible-, either with the intention of preventing people
from going astray or with a view to avoiding the censure of the wise
people; sah, he; eva, really; na karoti, does not do; kincit, anything,
because he is endued with the realization of the actionless Self."

So either Sankara contradicts himself, or he is setting down a guideline
for his *students* which he himself acknowledges cannot be universally
applicable.
