Yes, Ramana Maharshi (RM) clearly says that for *THAT PARTICULAR* aspirant, taking sannyAsa is not
the right decision! Because RM's reply starts with, "Why do *YOU* think *YOU* are a grihastha?"
The personal pronoun "YOU" reveals that it was addressed to a specific individual, who was probably
unfit for sannyAsa! As already discussed, the majority of the population is not eligible for sannyAsa,
and this questioner was evidently among the ineligible.

That's why the earlier quote from "Spiritual Instruction" is more general:
