Namaste Venkat Ji,

My own understanding is that according to Sri Bhagavatpada, Ashrama sanyAsa
is mandatory for jnAna. However I have come across several talks by Swami
Paramarthananda wherein he has stated that such is not the case. But it has
been some time since I have listened to these talks and unfortunately I am
not able to recollect exactly the particular talks nor specific reasons he
had adduced for such a conclusion. So I am unable to respond positively to
your query at this time.

Regards

Chandramouli
