Ramana Bhagavan has been revered by both the Sringeri and Puri Acharyas of His time.
Hence His Teachings are definitely pertinent to Advaita Vedanta.

Although Akilesh has a view of Sannyasa that I believe is not really held by either
Traditionalists or a specific Teacher, he has done two things correctly:

1) He has quoted passages from Ramana Bhagavan's teachings, rather than mere empty talk.
2) He has not resorted to any personal attacks.

For the above reasons, I would recommend that he not be removed, but of course,
you are the moderator.

The main point in this thread that I would like to reiterate is this:
No amount of quoting any authority saying that "Sannyasa should not be resorted to by
this particular individual" can be taken as proof that Sannyasa is generally prohibited
or not recommended to anyone. This is because the said individual may not be *FIT*
to take up Sannyasa. The foremost example in this regard is Arjuna himself!
