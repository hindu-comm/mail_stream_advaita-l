I was actually looking forward to reading his commentary/interpretation on
RM’s most important work, which is a big commitment of time on his part,
and some discussion on how it aligned with Bhagvadpada Shankarcharya’s
works.

Unfortunately after his first two posts, disagreement happened and one
thing led to another.

But the main purpose - the posting of the verses, and his interpretation -
was useful, I felt, for contemplation on “Who Am I” message of Ramana
Maharishi.

Dhanyavaad,
Sanjivendra Nath.
