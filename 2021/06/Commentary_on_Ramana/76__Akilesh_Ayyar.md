Uh, no, actually, if you read a little later in the conversation, Ven says
to me of my position on this point that I am using

"verbal acrobatics to justify this position, arguing a phrase here is
figurative, whereas a phrase there should be taken *literally*."

Funny, "everyone" seems to include only the people who agree with you. I
wonder why? Interesting how Ramana himself in all his discourses seems
perfectly capable of using the word sannyasa when he wants to, usually in a
way that you disagree with.

No. Wrong. That's all prarabhda karma..

As Sankara says in Brahma Sutra Bhashya 3.3.32, jivanmuktas are continuing
their corporeal existence -- yes, that would include eating and also
speaking about Brahman, etc. -- only because of prarabhda karma.

Or as Ramana says in his Talks,

D.: From all this it looks as if a Jnani who has scorched all the vasanas
is the best and that he would remain inactive like a stock or stone.
M.: No, not necessarily. Vasanas do not affect him. Is it not itself a
vasana that one remains like a stock or stone?

So anything any body-mind does -- whether it be sitting like a stone or
discoursing on self-inquiry -- is a vasana; a jnani merely does not
identify with those.
