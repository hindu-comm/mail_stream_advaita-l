Another unequivocal Ramana quote. Let's not do Bhagavan the disservice of
suggesting he's lying to his disciple in response to a direct question:

D: Can a married man realise the Self?
M: Certainly. Married or unmarried, a man can realise the Self; because
That is here and now. If it were not
so, but attainable by some effort at some time, and if it were new and had
to be acquired, it would not be worth pursuit. Because, what is not natural
is not permanent either. But what I say is that the Self is here and now,
and alone.

(Maharishi's Gospel, Book 1, Chapter 1)
