Lets break this down into the logical components of the argument.

1) We agree that his written work UN, US and Nan Yar have his imprimatur on them.  They are basically focused on tersely explaining his philosophy and his core teaching of ‘who am I’; all other instructions were auxiliary.  The purpose of ‘who am I’ is to intently hold onto the illusory I until it disappears.  Hence your quoted 2nd verse of UN states "“DEAD TO THEMSELVES AND THEIR POSSESSIONS"


2) GVK has an equivalent authority to his written works, because it was recorded by Muruganar, one of his closest disciples, and each verse was checked and corrected if necessary by Bhagavan.  He amended the introduction to this work, writing “This is a definitive work that has come into existence to explain in great detail and in a pristine form, Sri Ramana’s philosophy and its essential nature”.  So GVK also bear his imprimatur.


3) In GVK, we indeed have a number of verses on renunciation including:

829: Since it is impossible to know beforehand the last moment of one’s life, IT IS BEST FOR ONE  who has a firm determination [to put an end to birth and death] TO RENOUNCE AT THE VERY MOMENT HE GETS DISGUST FOR THE BODY AND WORLD.

Sri Muruganar commentary: Since vairagya, the firm determination to put an end to birth and death, is the correct sign of maturity, one should take to renunciation [sannyasa] as soon as a disgust arises in one for the body and world, no matter to which of the four ashramas [modes of life] one may belong at that time. The ascending order of ashramas is applicable only to ordinary seekers and not to those mature aspirants who have intense vairagya.

That seems to be pretty clear advice to one who has already developed a disgust with the world - ie not a householder.


4) In Talks, you rightly cite a number of conversations with householders where he says mental renunciation is what is required, rather than physical.  You ask rhetorically: “Is he lying?”.
Clearly the answer is no.
But they are a householder, and presumably have not developed a disgust with the world.  So rather than push them into physical renunciation, which would be meaningless and harmful, he tells them mental renunciation is a must - which it is (no argument there).

If you disagree with this explanation, then I think you need to explain (to yourself as much as anyone else) the GVK verses 829 et seq - and their apparent contradiction with Talks.


Best wishes,
venkat
