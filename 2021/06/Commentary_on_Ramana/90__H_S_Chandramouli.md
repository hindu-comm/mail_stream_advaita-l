Namaste.

In continuation, Swamiji apparently has made similar remarks in his
Gurupurnima talk in 2007. A gist off the same is available at the following
link on  ** What is Sanyasa **  by the Swamiji

<<
https://www.vedanta.gr/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/SwParam_GP2007_What-is-Sannyas_ENA4.pdf
>>.

Please see page 8 on ** Is Antara sanyasa compulsory **.  I am copying
below an extract from the same. Not sure if it will come out properly in
this post. Hence I have provided the link for the article.

<<   Is Antara Sannyasa compusory?

 Lastly, before conclusion we will discuss one more topic and conclude. Is
this Āntara Sannyāsa compulsory or not. Inner renunciation is compulsory if
Moksha is the goal. It may not be compulsory immediately as in today. We
can postpone it but we can never avoid that. Therefore Āntara Sannyāsa is
compulsory. 8 What is Sannyasa? – Swami Paramarthananda Then the next
question is – what about Bāhya Sannyāsa [external Sannyāsa], i.e., Āshrama
Sannyāsa [formal Sannyāsa] ? Is this form of Sannyāsa compulsory or not ?
This is a technical topic of academic interest, but we will briefly discuss
this and conclude. Is formal renunciation, which is taking to monastic
order, compulsory or not ? There are two types of view with regards to
this. Generally, when we discuss this, invariably the topic will be centred
on King Janaka. Janaka will be the example taken for finding whether
external Sannyāsa is required or not. When we read the scriptures, we find
that everywhere, wherever Janaka is mentioned, it is clearly said that
Janaka is an Āntara Sannyāsi and Janaka is a liberated person. We see that
in Bhagavad Gītā and Ashtāvakra Gītā, we find that Janaka is a Grihastha as
well as an Āntara Sannyāsi. Based on this instance, the question arises
whether external Sannyāsa is required or not ? Generally we infer that
Janaka became an Jnāni and Janaka became liberated remaining a Grihastha.
>From this the conclusions that we make are two. One group of people say
that external Sannyāsa is not compulsory because in the case of Janaka, he
is not an external Sannyāsi as he is a Grihastha, yet he is liberated.
There is a second group of people who say, external Sannyāsa is not
required in this Janma. If Janaka has practiced Āntara Sannyāsa and has got
liberation, it only proves that he was an external Sannyāsi in his Pūrva
Janma [previous birth]. So their argument is that in the Pūrva Janma,
Janaka had taken external Sannyāsa. But because of some reason, he could
not gain Moksha and therefore he became a Yoga Bhrashtaha [fallen yogi] and
then in his Janma (as King Janaka), because of his Sannyāsa Vāsanā
[Sannyasa tendency], he became an Āntara Sannyāsi. Therefore their argument
is that every Āntara Sannyāsi Grihastha has been an external Sannyāsi in
the Pūrva Janma – therefore external Sannyāsa is also part of liberation
either in the previous Janma or in the current Janma. Therefore if you all
successfully practice Āntara Sannyāsa in Grihastha Āshrama, you have taken
Bāhya Sannyāsa in Pūrva Janma. Therefore the conclusion is that both
Sannyāsa are there and therefore both Sannyāsas go with Jnānam. Therefore
whether Bāhya Sannyāsa [external Sannyasa] is taken in the Pūrva Janma or
in the present Janma or future Janma, we need not bother. We focus on
Āntara Sannyāsa like King Janaka. Therefore we, all serious spiritual
seekers, should prepare the mind for becoming Āntara Sannyāsi one day or
the other. There afterwards, Jnānam and Sannyāsa put together will give
both Jīvan Muktihi [liberation while living] and Videha Muktihi [liberation
upon dropping of body]  >>.
