>From my notes:

In the Sat Darshanam, Bhagan Ramana Maharshi, in hisintroductory salutational sloka to Lord Shiva, says:

mrutyumjayam mrutyubhi aashritaanaam 

aham matirmrutyumapaiti puurvam ..

Recalling the story of sage Markandeya, who went to LordShiva, who is mrutyumjaya (the conquer of the Lord of Death, Yama) toprotect him from the jaws of death, Maharshi says, instead of protecting thedevotee, the Lord destroyed the devotee who came to surrender himself. It looksvery unfair. What Lord Shiva did was â€“He destroyed the devote-deity duality that is clouding in the mind of thedevotee. The devotee is now free from Death, that is, his identification withall changing names and forms.
