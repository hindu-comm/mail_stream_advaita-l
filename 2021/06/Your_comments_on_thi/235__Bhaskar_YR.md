In English - Remember Adi Sankara by reading his Bhashyas but not by reading imaginary stories like Sankara Dig Vijaya. Message from Vidwan Ve Br Sudarshana Sharma Holenarsipur

praNAms Sri Venkatesh prabhuji
Hare Krishna

Since you have quoted Kannada talks, you must be knowing and read Kannada.  Kindly refer Sri SSS's bhagavatpAda vruttAnta sArasarvasva, you yourself will come to know there must be more free flowing poetic imagination than the actual events in these biographies which have been written after centuries of shankara's time.  For that matter not only Sri SSS, even among the traditional mutts (for example between kAnchi & shringeri mutts) there is drastic difference of opinion with regard to birth century of shankara and other episodes in his biography.  For more details you can also refer late Prof. SKR's shankara and adhyAsa bhAshya.    So, I reckon here sudarshana sharma's advice is more sensible.
