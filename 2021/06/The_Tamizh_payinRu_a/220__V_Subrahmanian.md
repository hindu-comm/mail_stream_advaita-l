In this video, at 22.15 onwards, the speaker explains a line of the Tamil
Siva Puranam of Manikavachakar:

நள் இருளில் நட்டம் *பயின்று *ஆடும் நாதனே

She explains the word  பயின்று as 'repeatedly' .  This is interesting as
the Tamil word 'payinRu' literally would mean 'having learnt, practiced,
got trained..'.  However, in this context of Shiva's Cosmic Dance, in the
Pralaya, is not something He learnt, practiced and perfected.  The meaning
'repeatedly' for this Tamil word is what another Tamil scholar Mee.So.So...
too gives.

What is amazing is that the Tamil word and the meaning have a very close
correspondence to the Sanskrit 'abhyAsa'.  This too literally would mean
'practice, learning, etc.'  However, in Shaastra, the term 'abhyAsa' has
the special significance of being a Tatparya Linga, one of the six
parameters to determine the purport of a text, along with
Upakrama-upasamhara, apUrvatA, phalam, arthavAda and upapatti.  When a
certain concept is *repeatedly *stated, rather reiterated throughout the
text, it is something that the text is particularly emphasizing as
important.
