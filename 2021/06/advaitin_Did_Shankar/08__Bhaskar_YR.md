I really doubt if someone says both shaNmata (six schools of thought) sthApana and mere advising the worship of shaNdevata-s as parabrahma svarUpa are one and the same. And also, if shaNmata sthApanAchArya propagating only paNchAyatana pooja excluding skanda is something to be pondered.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
