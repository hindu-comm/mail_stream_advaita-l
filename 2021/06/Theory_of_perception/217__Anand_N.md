Namaste,

There had been a discussion recently on perception
https://lists.advaita-vedanta.org/archives/advaita-l/2021-May/056605.html

I happened to be listening to a talk and it was very briefly mentioned

Here, Lakshmithathacharya is referring to two scholars who have done a lot
of work
on this topic- Chitranjan Naik and Govindarajan.
Maybe someone is interested in digging deeper into what they have done.

Om Namo Narayanaya,
Anand
