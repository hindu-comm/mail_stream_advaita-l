Dear Learned Scholars,

Could any one share the following Stotra if you have:
"सप्तर्षि कृत श्रीराम स्तवराजं"?

I suppose it has seven stanzas, each stanza having the unique words like,
"श्रीरामं भज शरणं श्रीरघुरामं भज शरणं".
Our family has been searching for this stotra for many years. Not able to
find anywhere. Deeply indebted if someone posts this.

Thanks in advance,
Siva.
