Dear Venkat ji,

Could you please let me know if the commentary of Lakshmana Sarma on ‘Ulladu Narpadu’ is available for purchase? If so what is the title of the book. Many thanks and regards,

Venkat
(Your namesake)

His essay "Nan Yar” essentially summarises the key aspects of advaitic teaching, without going into the logical reasoning that Sankara does.   Also this ‘who am I’ diving inwardly contemplation, strikes me as comparable to BG in its recommendation to have a constant stream of thought towards the Self.  It is also I think the implication of Brhad Up 3.5.1 when it talks about living on the strength of that knowledge and dwelling on it - as Sankara says in Brhad Up 4.5.15:  neti, neti and renunciation is the final conclusion of it all.
