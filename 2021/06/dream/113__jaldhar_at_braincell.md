Kaushika asked me this question but in the recent fuss I didn't answer 
sorry.  I'm posting to the list because I'd like to check if other members 
agree with my answer which is:

Just as the rope can appear to be a snake, if some sin happens in a dream 
and the dreamer believes it is real then he should make a prayaschitta for 
it.  But if he knows it is just a dream, then he as the creator of that 
dream world can absolve himself of any wrongdoing.
