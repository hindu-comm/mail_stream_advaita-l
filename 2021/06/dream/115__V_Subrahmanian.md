In the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad is this passage:  4.3.15 (as part of a long
mantra):

The essence is:  The dreamer only 'sees' (and does not 'do') good and bad
in dreams and thus is not attached by the effects of the good and bad
there.  Nor is he a doer of the acts in dream for he is not connected to
the body-mind complex as he would in the waking.

Swami Madhavananda's translation:

Mantra:  15. After enjoying himself and roaming, and
merely seeing (the results of) good and evil (in
dreams), he (stays) in a state of profound sleep,
and comes back in the inverse order to his former
condition, the dream state. He is untouched by
whatever he sees in that state, for this infinite
being is unattached. 'It is just so, Yajiiavalkya.
I give you a thousand (cows), sir.
Please iftstruct me further about liberation
itself.'

Bhashya:

i.e. experiencing
the fatigue due to it, and merely seeing, not
doing, good and evil, i.e. their results (pleasure and
pain). We have already said (p. 633) that good and
evil cannot be directly visualised. Hence he is not
fettered by them. Only one who does good and evil
is so fettered ; one certainly cannot come under their
binding influence by merely seeing them. Therefore,
being identified with dreams, the self transcends death
also, not merely its forms. Hence death cannot be urged
to be its nature. Were it so, the self would be
doing things in dreams ; but it does not. If activity
be the .nature of the self, it will never attain Liberation ;
but it is not, for it is absent in dreams. Hence the·
self can get rid of death in the form of good and evil.
Objection : But is not activity its nature in the·
waking state ?
Reply : No, that is due to its limiting adjuncts,
the intellect etc. This has been proved on the ground
of apparent activity from the text, 'It thinks, as it
.were, and shakes. as it were' (IV. iii. 7).

It may be asked. how is one to know that a man
does not do good and evil in dreams, but merely sees
their results? Rather the presumption is that as he
does good and evil in the waking state, so he does
them in the dream state also, for the experience is the
same in both cases. This is being answered: He, the
self, is untouched by whatever results of good and evil
he sees in that dream state. If he actually did anything
in dreams, he would be bound by it ; and it
would pursue him even after he woke up. But it is
not known in everyday life that he is pursued by deeds
done in dreams. Nobody considers himself a sinner
oil account of sins committed in dreams ; nor do people
who have heard of them condemn or shun him. Therefore
he is certinly untouched by them. Hence he
only appears to be doing things in dreams, but actually
there is no activity. The verse has been quoted: 'He
seems to be enjoying himself in the company of
;women' (IV. iii. 13). And those who describe their
dream experiences use the words 'as if' in this connec-
tion, as. for instance, 'I saw to-day as if a herd ot
elephants was running.' Therefore the self has no
activity (in dreams).
How is it that it has no activity? (This is being
explained:) We see that an action is caused by the
contact of the body and organs, which have form,
with something else that has form. We never see a
formless thing being active ; and the self is formless,
hence it is unattached. And because this self is unattached,
it is untouched by what it sees in dreams.
Therefore we cannt>t by any means attribute activity
to it, since activity proceeds from the contact of the
body and organs, and that contact is non-existent for
the self, for this infinite being (self) is unattached.
