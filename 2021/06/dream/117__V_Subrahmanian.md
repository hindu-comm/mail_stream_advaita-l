Yes, this prayer is quite in order.  Such a prayer will help us cleanse our
vasanas, tendencies, to engage in sinful acts in the waking state, which
alone leave a samskara that shows itself up in dreams.  So prayer helps in
a positive way to prevent the causal factor which is the seed for the
dream. In other words, the dream happenings are to be seen as an indicator
of the dreamer's mental state/type.  If corrections are required, sure,
they can be made in the waking.
