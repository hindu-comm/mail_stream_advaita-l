https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harikatha#History

The Telugu form of Harikatha originated in Coastal Andhra
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coastal_Andhra> during the 19th century.[2]
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harikatha#cite_note-2> Harikatha Kalakshepam
is most prevalent in Andhra <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andhra_Pradesh> even
now along with Burra katha <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burra_katha>.
Haridasus <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haridasu> going round villages
singing devotional songs is an age-old tradition during Dhanurmaasam
preceding Sankranti <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sankranti> festival. Ajjada
Adibhatla Narayana Dasu
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajjada_Adibhatla_Narayana_Dasu> was the
originator of the Telugu Harikatha tradition, and with his Kavyas and
Prabandhas has made it a special art form
