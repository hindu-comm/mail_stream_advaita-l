Last year I made an enquiry in a group and this is the reply:

Hare Krishna.

These are links to purchase Hindi and English translations of Parasara
Madhaviya:

SANS+HINDI, Kamalakant Tripathi, Chaukhamba, p.1706, 3 vols.
Ask directly to Chaukhamba

ENG, No Info, 3 vols.

I have already purchased the Hindi one and have started reading. It is
a very good translation probably because the translator is a mimamsaka
and the commentary contains good doses of Mimamsa, something similar
to the Medhatithi on Manu samhita. I am satisfied with this hindi
translation.

Thankyou,

    This seems to be a translation of just the original without the
Vidyaranya commentary.
