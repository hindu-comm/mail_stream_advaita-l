SAdara praNAm,
*SAdhana panchakam* or *Upadesa panchakam* is considered to be the last
instructions of
Sankara BhagavadpAda.
In the last pAda of the second sloka comes the instruction "*sruthi siro
vAkyam samAkarnyathAm*"
The commentary given by SwAmi SachidAnandendra Saraswathy of Holenarsipur
reads: "Approach a master who has realised the truth and serve at his feet
day by day; learn for the attainment of the One imperishable Brahman and
heedfully listen to the holy teaching of the Upanishad"
Hope this is enough to clear the doubts.
Namaste.
*Prof. Sivakumar *
