Temple Management in the Agama-s, by Dr. Deepa Duraiswamy gives a wonderful
overview of the traditions of Saiva Agamic temple worship predominant in
Tamil Nadu.

My book review - https://swarajyamag.com/.../book-review-read-this-one-if...
<https://swarajyamag.com/books/book-review-read-this-one-if-youre-looking-for-an-introduction-to-the-unique-cultures-and-traditions-around-hindu-temples?fbclid=IwAR1zTEoorTwZZUX_nOyfB-5NMMDFqKBZR9xSCgZoA1Yc6JszcdHAR1jMUOM>

"The author is a management graduate from IIM Kolkata and hails from a
traditional Adisaiva family. Such a background gives her a unique advantage
to present the subject with the authenticity, intimacy and the rigour it
requires...

It proposes the temple to be viewed as a service organisation and a
non-profit, non-business entity in the modern management parlance,
outlining that the temple, just like any other organisation, has its own
unique requirements of the four types of resources.. The author has
attempted to blend non-compromising traditional beliefs and a modern
management-oriented approach without getting into any unnecessary
conflict.."

P.S: If the author is in FB and is in your friend's list, please tag her in
