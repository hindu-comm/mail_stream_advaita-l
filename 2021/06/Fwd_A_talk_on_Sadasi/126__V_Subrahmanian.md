Subject: A talk on Sadasiva brahmendra in Sanskrit by Dr Jayaraman.
To: BHARATIYA VIDVAT <bvparishat at googlegroups.com>


The talk is very interesting,informative and instructive. Many nuances of
the cultivation of a strong mind are brought out effectively by citing
passages from the Yoga Darshana and other texts and the life of the Saint.
