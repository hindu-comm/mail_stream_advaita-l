Dear Baandhavaha,

The Acharyan of Ahobilam is well known among both Shri Vaishnavas and
Smarthas. He is erudite in Vedas, Shastras, and the Shri Vaishnava
Siddhantha. He speaks about his life experiences with and the peerless
impact of Kanchi Shankaracharya Jagadguru Shri Shri Shri Chandrasekharendra
Saraswathi Mahaswaminaha on preserving the Vedas. It is treat beyond
comparison to hear of this great Yatindra speak of one of the greatest
saints who ever lived in the previous century. The video has english
subtitles and the talk is in Tamil. Enjoy the delightful, enriching, and
uplifting experience.
