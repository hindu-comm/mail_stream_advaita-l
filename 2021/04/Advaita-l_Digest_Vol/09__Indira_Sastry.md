> This is the PART 2 lecture on Chidambara Nataraja Stuti which comes in the
> Suta Samhita Mukti Khanda Chapter 9 Verses (57-72). Suta Samhita is one of
> the foremost of all scriptures given by Suta Maharishi. It is described as
> the essence of all the Vedas & Upanishads. This Stuti is sung by all the
> Rishis, Devas including Brahma, Vishnu & Indra, Asuras, etc. to Lord Shiva
> at Chidambaram. An interesting thing is, this Stuti contains the very names
> of Lord Shiva as it is is coming from the Shata Rudriyam 1st, 2nd & 3rd
> Anuvaka. Suta Samhita Mukti Khanda ends with this Stuti by saying, one who
> chants or hears this will have the grace of Mahadeva and attain the highest
> Mukti.
