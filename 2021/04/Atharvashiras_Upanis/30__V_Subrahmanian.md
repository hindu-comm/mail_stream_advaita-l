Sir, the speaker in those videos has identified himself with  'Shiva
Vishishtadvaita' school.  For them such a moksha/mukti is quite
admissible.

Since for Advaitins the maxim 'that which is not contradictory (with us) in
other schools is acceptable', applies, certain aspects are admissible. Such
talks give us references for our idea of Shiva - Vishnu abheda.
