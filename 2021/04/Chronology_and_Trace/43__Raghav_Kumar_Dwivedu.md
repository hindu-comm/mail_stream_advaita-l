Namaste Anand ji
One additional aspect to consider is this. These post-Vedic forms of
Ishvara such as Ayyappa etc., are not merely cultural or imagined entities.
Rather they can be regarded as discoveries by shiShTas of some aspects of
Ishvara.  They are empirically (vyAvahArika) real.

Just as modern science brings to our attention new understanding and
technological experiences such as space travel, telecommunication etc., our
sages/shiShTas too by their devotion, discovered (i.e., they were blessed
by Ishvara) with these revelations of the chronologically later forms and
the corresponding worship of Ayyappa, benign aspects of Vinayaka etc. The
idea is that they are not merely culturally imagined memes like Sherlock
Homes, Superman, Star Wars characters etc.

Om
Raghav
