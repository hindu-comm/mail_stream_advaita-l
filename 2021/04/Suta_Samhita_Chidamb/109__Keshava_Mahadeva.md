This is the PART 1 lecture on Chidambara Nataraja Stuti which comes in the
Suta Samhita Mukti Khanda Chapter 9 Verses (57-72) Suta Samhita is one of
the foremost of all scriptures given by Suta Maharishi. It is described as
the essence of all the Vedas & Upanishads. This Stuti is sung by all the
Rishis, Devas including Brahma, Vishnu & Indra, Asuras, etc. to Lord Shiva
at Chidambaram. An interesting thing is, this Stuti contains the very names
of Lord Shiva as it is is coming from the Shata Rudriyam 1st, 2nd & 3rd
Anuvaka. Suta Samhita Mukti Khanda ends with this Stuti by saying, one who
chants or hears this will have the grace of Mahadeva and attain the highest
Mukti.

This lecture gives a description of Chidambara Nataraja.
