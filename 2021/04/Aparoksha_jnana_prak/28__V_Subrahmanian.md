In the Taittiriy Upanishad Bhashyam 2.8.5  स य एवंवित् ...  *Aparoksha
jnana prakara. *

* स यः कश्चित् एवं यथोक्तं ब्रह्म उत्सृज्योत्कर्षापकर्षमद्तं सत्यं *
*ज्ञानमनन्तमस्मीत्ये*वं वेत्तीति एवंवित् ;

The context is: There is this Consciousness in the 'high' entity, the Sun
and in this 'low' entity, the human. The indwelling Consciousness is the
same in both these entities. He who, having disregarded the two containers,
upadhi-s (superior and inferior) and realizes his own Self as 'I am the
same Nondual, Eternal, Consciousness, infinite.'  Four 'epithets' are
specified here for Brahman: it is Advaitam, Satyam, Jnanam and Anantam.

*This is available in the Swami Gambhirananda's English translation of the
Taittiriya Upanishad in the 'Eight Upanishads Vol.1, p. 376, paragraph 2.*


Here is an instance where the 'upadhi'-s are given up, bhaaga
tyaaga-lakshanaa, and the Consciousness that is what matters, is considered
for identifying oneself with. Shankaracharya uses the term 'utsrjya
utkarSha-apakarSham' to indicate the 'giving up' of the two upadhis.
