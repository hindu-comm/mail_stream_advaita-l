 Dear Sri Subramanian,
You write :" Shankaracharya uses the term 'utsrjya utkarSha-apakarSham' to indicate the 'giving up' of the two upadhis. "
If one takes a literal meaning of the phrase " 'giving up' of the two upadhis"it can never be done. When chandogya Sruti says " AtmaivEdagaM sarvam||"and Sri Shankara says in Brahmasutra "AtmA sarvagatatvAt , sarvAnanyatvAcca"is there a separate upadhi separate from the one who is Atman Himself?"Where" and "Who" vanishes in the light of the above stated fact.The TRUTH is "there is nothing to be taken in and nothing to be given up".
Please ponder over.
With respectful namasakars,Sreenivasa Murthy

 In the TaittiriyUpanishad Bhashyam 2.8.5 स य एवंवित् ... Aparoksha jnana prakara.

सयःकश्चित्एवंयथोक्तंब्रह्मउत्सृज्योत्कर्षापकर्षमद्तंसत्यंज्ञानमनन्तमस्मीत्येवंवेत्तीतिएवंवित्;

The context is: There is this Consciousness in the 'high' entity, the Sun and in this 'low' entity, the human. The indwelling Consciousness is the same in both these entities. He who, having disregarded the two containers, upadhi-s (superior and inferior) and realizes his own Self as 'I am the same Nondual, Eternal, Consciousness, infinite.' Four 'epithets' are specified here for Brahman: it is Advaitam, Satyam, Jnanam and Anantam.
This is available in the Swami Gambhirananda's English translation of the Taittiriya Upanishad in the 'Eight Upanishads Vol.1, p. 376, paragraph 2. 
Here is an instance where the 'upadhi'-s are given up, bhaaga tyaaga-lakshanaa, and the Consciousness that is what matters, is considered for identifying oneself with. Shankaracharya uses the term 'utsrjya utkarSha-apakarSham' to indicate the 'giving up' of the two upadhis.
Om Tat Sat
