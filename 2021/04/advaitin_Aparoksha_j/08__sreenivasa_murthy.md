 Dear Sri Subramanian,
Please permit me to draw your kind attention to the Commentary of 
Sri Shankara to mantra1-3-14 of Katha upanishad which reads as follows :EvaM puruShE Atmani sarvaM pravilApya nAmarUpakarmatrayaM yanmithyAjnAnavijRumBitaM kriyAkArakalakShaNaM svAtmayAthAtmyajnAnEna marIcyuakarajjusarpagaganamalAnIva marIcirajjugaganasvarUpadarSanEnaiva svasthaM praSAntAtmA kRutakRutyO Bavati yataH AtaH -||
Sri Shankara uses the word "pravilApya" .This is very crucial.

With this I will close the discussion.With respectful namaskars,Sreenivasa Murthy.

Namaste

It is about the unreality of the name-form world. Even though Chaitanyam
is all-pervading and everything is indeed that Chaitanyam, yet, it has to
be taught only as 'all-pervading' since without the 'all', the very
existence of Chaitanyam can't be appreciated by the aspirant. So, as
adhyaropa the 'all' is taught and as 'apavada' the all is negated. But the
Chaitanyam that is there always is realized as oneself. Hence, the 'giving
up' is necessary.
