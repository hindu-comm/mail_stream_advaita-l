Dear Members,           From the Lotus feet of Jagadguru Sri Sri Bharathi Theertha Mahaswami Anugraha Bhashanam:
Originally it is in telugu which I am putting in english for all:
Who is the Relative/Bandhu Gana: One himself is Relative
Who is the actual relative? None other than yourself.Krishna told in Bhagvadgita that" आत्मैव ह्यात्मनो बन्धुरात्मैव रिपु रात्मनः " |We feel that Who ever does good are our relatives and we don't bother or worry about the people who does bad to us.If you think Good or bad, one will get an answer to get relief from Samsara.To get removal from samsara by themselves only as told by Shankara Bhagavatpada" उद्धरेदात्म नात्मानं मग्नं संसार वारिधौ " |It means that who ever fully dipped in samsara has to try to get out from that, there is no otherway. So how one will do this is by turning inwards and by forgetting the external things from the mind and dipping in the athma it can be achieved.To achieve this, one has to develop vairagya towards the worldly matter. If one understand that worldly matter are mirage in the desert vairagya develops automatically.Guru's discourses, vedanta interpretations are required to get vairagya and by the grace of the Guru vairagya reaches its peak then atma darsana happens. Like this to get Atma Darsana should be objective of life. One should strive to achieve this.सा विद्या या विमुक्तये was told by elders, which means that the vidya which leads to Moksha is the Vidya and one should not forget this. The jnana which can't make the atma darsana is not the jnana. By understanding this sutra every one should try to get Atma Jnana.Sri Sri Bhrathi Teertha Mahaswami--- జగద్గురు శ్రీశ్రీ భారతీ తీర్థ మహస్వామివారు.Learned pls contribute to the topic of discussion
