Murthy Garu,            I will further more add few line in simpler way .
if some one keeps in BMI (Body MASS Index) constant through out the life i.e from birth-death and understand the sufferings, completely removing the karmic debs for what purpose you entered in this materialistic world and give away all the things to the people from you got this physicalbody and by catch hold of th divine lotus feet of the Sri Guru (Sahasrara Mahachakre Karpura Dhavle guru patumam Batuko Devo Bhirava sarva Karmasu) , one can get atma jnana .
Then live as long as your physical body remains with breath and feel/experience that you have not borned at all (i.e not at all taken the birth) and will not born in future also (Nenu puttaledu & Nenu puttnau).
This should be the commitment of the ideal disciple who wants moksha in the current janma,
Then I am sure that Nature, Mother godess, Sri Guru joins you in the form of light with their souls to relieve you from this samsara or give the way to get out of this maya world.
This can only happen in this Karmic land.

Dear Murthyji,            I will try to combine your both the queries in this thread and the other one GURU and try to answer with the help of one the senior members reply to one of my query.
Finding an adept guru is very very difficult as you had understood. It is therefore clearly stated that when one finds a guru not capable, he is free to shun him and go to another competent one, until he finds the one to take him through. Like a bee goes from flower to flower, selecting the guru happens likewise. When the bee (disciple) does not go to the flower(Guru) the flower will come to the bee in srividhya, to one who prays to the Divine Mother and the Guru Mandalam for help, guidance and support.
Naturally, if one goes to a guru, if he finds total calmness prevailing and pervading through, then that person might be the guru.We accept everyone as guru, simply because, we are interwined in samporadaya and sentiments, which have no place in spirituality. Great saints are our guidance and unless one experiences the same divinity as the guru might be, there is no use. Vedas Upanishads are only guidance and one has to experience the guru and the divine, to know that the guru is non other than the Lord Kameswara-Kameshwari.
For thinks the Guru must have the capacity to transmit the divine energy to the disciple, handle the disciple's karana sareera from his own karana-sareera, and that is why guru parampara becomes very important.
Even a common man undergoes the pancha makara at the time of death and this is not a speciality for srividhya. Upasakas must transcend all chakras by connecting his soul with the soul of the Master, who should be capable of making masters only and not disciples. From there after either you win or I win upasana of divine mother, the divine mother finds that the upasaka as nothing but her own energy and takes him to the Lord who is non-energy and merges him with the ultimate Shiva (Lord) where silence in silence is the only experience. This is possible even in this janma with the help of adapt guru.
Immortal Guru i.e Ananda dayaka Guru can only make the darshna of atma or Atma sakshatkara in this karmic land and that is why Guru's role is important in the process of Liberation/Moksha. i.e once you come out as the form of light from brahmmarandhra after obtaining atma jnana there is no need to be borned again.

 Dear Members,           From the Lotus feet of Jagadguru Sri Sri Bharathi Theertha Mahaswami Anugraha Bhashanam:
Originally it is in telugu which I am putting in english for all:
Who is the Relative/Bandhu Gana: One himself is Relative
Who is the actual relative? None other than yourself.Krishna told in Bhagvadgita that" आत्मैव ह्यात्मनो बन्धुरात्मैव रिपु रात्मनः " |We feel that Who ever does good are our relatives and we don't bother or worry about the people who does bad to us.If you think Good or bad, one will get an answer to get relief from Samsara.To get removal from samsara by themselves only as told by Shankara Bhagavatpada" उद्धरेदात्म नात्मानं मग्नं संसार वारिधौ " |It means that who ever fully dipped in samsara has to try to get out from that, there is no otherway. So how one will do this is by turning inwards and by forgetting the external things from the mind and dipping in the athma it can be achieved.To achieve this, one has to develop vairagya towards the worldly matter. If one understand that worldly matter are mirage in the desert vairagya develops automatically.Guru's discourses, vedanta interpretations are required to get vairagya and by the grace of the Guru vairagya reaches its peak then atma darsana happens. Like this to get Atma Darsana should be objective of life. One should strive to achieve this.सा विद्या या विमुक्तये was told by elders, which means that the vidya which leads to Moksha is the Vidya and one should not forget this. The jnana which can't make the atma darsana is not the jnana. By understanding this sutra every one should try to get Atma Jnana.Sri Sri Bhrathi Teertha Mahaswami--- జగద్గురు శ్రీశ్రీ భారతీ తీర్థ మహస్వామివారు.Learned pls contribute to the topic of discussion
