Dear friends,
A study of Vedanta is undertaken with the sole purpose of resolving the one and only question which has been stated below. 

"Who are you?
What are you?
Do you really know?Are you really the limited mortal self that you appear to be?"
That is all. 
Nothing more, nothing less.

With respectful namaskars,Sreenivasa Murthy
