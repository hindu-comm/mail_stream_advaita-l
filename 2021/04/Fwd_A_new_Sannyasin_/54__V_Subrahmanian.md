Subject: A new Sannyasin for the Shankaracharya Sampradaya
To: <advaitin at googlegroups.com>


Today our group member Brahmachari sri Bharat Shastry of Tiruvannamalai
received Sanyasa Diksha from Pujyasri Omkarananda Mahaswamiji Theni. The
yogapattam is Sri Brahmathmananda Saraswathi Swamijà¤‡.

He was known as Bharat Sastry, from a Kannada Brahmin family in Bangalore.
He had his education here and worked with some MNC-s and left all that a
few years ago and joined an Ashram at Tiruvannamalai. Deeply into spiritual
studies and practices, he has now taken sannyasa. A very pleasing person.
He takes Vedanta classes in English.h.
