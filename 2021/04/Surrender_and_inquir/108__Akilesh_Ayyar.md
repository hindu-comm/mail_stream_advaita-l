A useful analogy for a seeker engaged in surrender or inquiry is to think
about what it's like to go to sleep. To fall asleep, you must relax, close
your eyes, and fall away from everything in the waking world. You must let
go without expectation. Asking "Am I asleep?", trying to notice the
falling-asleep process, or trying to recreate the sleep you had a few weeks
ago will all interfere with falling asleep. And the waking one will never
know what it is like to be asleep. The seeker must have the same attitude.
