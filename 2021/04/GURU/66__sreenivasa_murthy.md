Dear friends,
Here is a very profound pointer from the pen of Sri Ananda Wood,.
Quote:
Forme the best of teachers will stand as That, and express the 
wisdom of Vedanta from direct experience. With such a teacher one 
can know they speak the Truth. Knowing this, the teacher can draw 
the seeker into the Truth, with the knowledge that there is no 
difference between the Truth and the seeker.

 *


Whenone sees the beauty and light of that
consciousness enlivening in every being, the vision of
vedanta is complete and the teaching is fulfilled.
That teacher who provides that vision through teaching
is indeed the right teacher.

Unquote.This is what mantra 1-2-8 of Kathopanishad is pointing outwhich reads as follows :
Na narENAvarENa prokta Esha

suvijnEyO bahudA cintyamnaH |

ananyaproktE gatiratra nAsti

aNIyAN hyatarkyamaNupramANAt || 1-2-8
[Kathopanishad 1-2-8]
What do the members have to say for this?

With respectful namaskars,Sreenivasa Murthy
