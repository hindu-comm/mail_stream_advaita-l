This is a lecture on Shiva Dashakam sung by Brihaspati Maharishi which
comes in the Suta Samhita Jnaana Yoga Khanda Chapter 10 Verses (46-55) The
Dashakam is considered to be the essence of Vedas & Upanishads. Just by
chanting or hearing the Ashtakam unflinching devotion for Lord Shiva will
arise in the heart.
