 Dear Sri Subramanian,
Not only 'Subramanya, Skanda is Para Brahman'everything (idagam sarvam) is Para Brahman.So says Upanishad.Chandogya Upanishad categorically declares :ahamEvEdagM sarvam || 7-25-1AtmaivEdagM sarvam || 7-25-2Atmata EvEdagM sarvam || 7-26-1
Mundaka Upanishad says :brahmaivEdam viSvaM variShTham ||
Mandukya Upanishad says :sarvagm hyEtadbrahma ayamAtmA brahma||
I am sure that you are aware of the existence and 
profound significance of the above mantras.

It is this Truth that all the serious students of Vedanta 
who are mumukShus must and shouldcognize/ realize before they die.It is for this purpose only one should study Vedanta.Sri Shankara writes in adhyasabhashya thus:AtmaikatvavidyApratipattayE sarvE vEdAntA AraByantE ||
Can there be a second opinion about 
what has been stated above?

With respectful namaskars,Sreenivasa Murthy.
