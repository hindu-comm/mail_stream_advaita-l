Namaste

I too was unable to trace any sanskrit version of the advaitabodhadipika.

I was under the impression it was originally a Tamil grantha translated by
Karapatra Swamiji in to Sanskrit. But it looks like the presumably old
Baroda and Travanacore MS were in sanskrit.

So its still not conclusive to me whether it was originally in Tamil or
not.

It may have belonged to the Koviloor Vedanta tradition if it does turn out
to have been originally in Tamil. Because they have a several centuries old
teaching tradition with several independent Tamil vedanta works like
"sorupasaaram" (svarUpasAram) and the like.

Also this Karapatra Swamiji is not the well-known Karapatri Swamiji
(1905-1982), I presume. Is there any date mentioned for sanskrit author
Karapatra Swamiji?

Om

Raghav
