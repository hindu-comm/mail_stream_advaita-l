I scanned through all the pages and found there is no original Sanskrit
text in this book; it is completely a translation to Tamil.  At the end of
the book a list of texts cited therein is given:

This includes the Veda, 'asango hyayam purushah', Vyasa Sutra, VasiShTha
(Yoga Vasishtha), Vivekachudamani, Smriti, Maitrayani shakha, Gita,
Pandhadashi, Purana, Ramayana and Sutasamhita.
