Thankyou to all those who replied to me.  The reason I asked is because 
the widely available English translation published by Ramanashrama claims 
to be based off a Sanskrit translation of the original Tamil work.  I 
received a query from a person who was looking for this Sanskrit version 
and was unable to find it.  I have also been unable to find it.  I suspect 
there never was a Sanskrit version, the English is translated directly 
from Tamil.
