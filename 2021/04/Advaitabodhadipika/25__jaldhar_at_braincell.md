Thankyou to all those who replied.  Sorry but due to Chaitra Navaratri and 
its aftermath I haven't been able to respond until now.

I am unable to verify for myself but several trustworthy people have told 
me that the 19th century book I mentioned (which incidently matches the 
date for the original composition as mentioned in the English 
composition.) wwas in Tamil only and not including any Sanskrit except 
quotations.

This is also kind of strange.  If as it seems there are only quotations 
from Sanskrit (and well known works at that) why would a translator in 
Chennai have to send off to distant Travancore or Vadodra (Baroda) for 
manuscripts when there were many libraries and vidvans much closer to 
home?  Or is the Sanskrit original of the Advaitabodhadipika itself which 
is meant.  Unfortunately although catalogues of both collections have been 
made, they do not seem to be online and due to the Corona situation I 
can't go to a library where I can consult them.

One thing we can conclusively say is that this author is not the famous 
20th century Karapatra Swami of Kashi.

Our list member Shri Gopal Gopinath found this web page which gives some
