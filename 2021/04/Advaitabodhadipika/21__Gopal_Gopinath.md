Not true. Vedanta, in particular, Advaita, had deep rooted scholarship in
Tamil community for many centuries. There is a recent history of at least
600 years  in Tamil nadu where tamil speaking scholarship of all flavors
have flourished obtaining fluency in samskritam and Tamil, focusing on both
advaita, saiva siddhanta and vaishnava source texts.  In fact many
siddhar's songs and collections refer to advaitic tenets and source texts
directly and indirectly. Many siddhars of tamil nadu had synonymous north
indian personages of naath parampara of ascetics and mystics.

The 600 years is a markup for the times of Sri Appaiya Dikshita. The
history pre-dates him.   As recently as 100 years, there was a Tamil
translation of  soundarya lahiri that had the blessings of Kanchi mutt
yatis by someone from chennai. The texts published by the Koviloor adheenam
also were originally authored by bi- tri lingual scholars or at least those
who studied advaitic texts from original source.  Ramana, an advaitic
savant from Tamil Nadu, referred to  upanishads and Yoga vasishta all
through his dialogs. There have been so many scholars from sections of
Tamil society until the advent of the Dravidian Party/Justice Party in the
socio-political realm.  One can refer to the publishers and patrons of this
ABD text that we are talking about... Hopefully, there would be an effort
to regain that deep cultural tradition of bi-lingual expertise and new
hindu scholarship in the different sections of the Tamil society going
forward.

There have been scores of Tamil vedantic texts but there never had been any
tamil advaita or tamil vishishtadvaita sects.. The flow of philosophic
thought has been continuous and interdependent even if the language used
had been staggered in format and presentation

If one goes over Sri Ramana Maharishi's tamil works, and this ABD text, it
is not hard to notice the strenuous efforts in the language to utilize the
common, pan-lingo, advaitic terms in a tamilized format. The author, almost
apologetically states at the end, that he had used samskrita mula words
directly in places to capture and retain the original intent and meaning of
the terms.. That particular effort to carve out a specialized tamil format
of vedantic terms could be seen in full intensity in the siddhanta/vedanta
works in Tamil composed between 1700-1920's.   By this measure, in my
opinion (subject to correction), ABD is an original Tamil work, an inspired
compilation of advaitic tenets in Q and A format, put together creatively
by Sri Sivaprakasa karapatra swamigal of Veperi, chennai. Mostly, he was
inspired, informed by his teachers and satsang he had the privilege to do
sadhana along with.  Some one translated that to samskritam and the texts
appeared to exist in some libraries as manuscripts for Sri Ramana's
scrutiny. That there is no ref to a samskritam version of the text by the
author or the publisher points to the chronology of the works. Efforts to
synthesize tenets of philosophy, puranas and itihaasa-s written in original
Samskritam  and render them in Tamil  have always been a norm in the Tamil
society for many centuries.

my 2 cents
