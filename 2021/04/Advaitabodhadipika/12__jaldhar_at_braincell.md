Could someone conversant in Tamil look at this:

https://archive.org/details/advaitabodhadipikatamilkarapatraswami1887_202004_887_B/

and tell me if it includes Sanskrit text?  Supposedly this work was 
originally in Tamil and one Karapatra Swami from the 19th century 
translated it into Sanskrit.  This Sanskrit version was then used for the 
widely available English version.  However despite much searching I've yet 
to find any direct quote of the Sanskrit version of the ABD which is 
rather odd.
