The above video describes how Bhagavad Gita is described as the words of
Lord Shiva and it is also described as Shiva Svarupa (form of Lord Shiva)
with references from the scriptures. The self realized soul Krishna
preaches about Pashupati Shiva Tattva (The highest that one can know) to
Arjuna. Bhagavad Gita teaches the knowledge of the divine form of Lord
Shiva.
