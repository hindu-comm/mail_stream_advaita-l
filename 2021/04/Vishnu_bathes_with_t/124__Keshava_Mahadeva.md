This video talks about the glories of the sacred ash and the story of how
Vishnu is always with the sacred ash (Bhasma or Vibhuti). He does Bhasma
Snaanam (bathing with the sacred ash) and eats the sacred ash to have the
knowledge of Lord Shiva. It comes from the Padma Purana Patala Khanda 105th
Chapter & Brihat Jabala Upanishad 6th Canto. There is no greater protective
factor than the sacred ash. There is no greater activity than engaging in
Shiva Bhakti. There is no knowledge greater than the knowledge of Lord
Shiva.
