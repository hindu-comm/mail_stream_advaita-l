Namaskaram

I did not know anything about Sikh philosophy. The resemblance with Advaita
is striking. The examples of rope being mistaken for a snake as well
ornaments made of gold not being different from it especially stand out.

It is as if it is direct descendent from Vedanta. Therefore what Sri Sunil
ji says could very well be the case.

Thank you for sharing. 🙏
