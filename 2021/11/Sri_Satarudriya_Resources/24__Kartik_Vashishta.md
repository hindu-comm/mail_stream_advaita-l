OM
OM NAMAH SIVANANDAYA

Revered Self,

Sadar Pranam,

I wish you comfort and peace.

The most blessed Sri Sri Swami Krishnananda ji Maharaj has mentioned a
couple of commentaries on the most blessed Sri Satarudriya, I need your
help in locating them.

This is what Sri Sri Swami Krishnananda ji maharaj has mentioned:

A very beautiful English translation almost approaching the original in its
meaning and suggestiveness has been published by the Sri Ramana Ashram; and
there are very good Sanskrit commentaries, right from the one written by
the great Sanyacharya, which gives us an insight into the extent to which
some of the minds in ancient times could reach in their search for the
reality of life.

Pranam,

OM
