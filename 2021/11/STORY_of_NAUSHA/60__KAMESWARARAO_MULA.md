The most important aspect of the story is that Devas are personalities who direct cosmosâ€™ various activities and bring welfare to humanity. Hence Vishnu and other gods supported the cause of Indra even when it involved certain sins. To obviate the sins, they performed Aswamedha and rejuvenated Indra.Those kings who listen this story shall become victorious in war.
In the story, we should find the application of Raja Niti for annihilating the enemies. In a way, the story portends the events of future wherein both Yudhishitir and Duryodhana devise plans of Raja Niti to accumulate forces for annihilating the enemies.
Sri Guru Padaravindarpana MastuKameswara
