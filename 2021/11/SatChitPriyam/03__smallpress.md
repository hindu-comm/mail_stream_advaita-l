Dear fellow Advaitins,
I would appreciate your collective thoughts on how to interpret SatChitPriyam in the DrikDrishyaViveka in reference to Brhmarupam.
asti bhāti priyam rūpam nāma chetyamśapañchakam
ādyatrayam brahmarūpam jagadrūpam tato dvayam
I have never seen this form in describing Brhman.
What does this priyam refer to? Is it from the standpoint of Jiva?
Thank you much.
Soma
