Namaskaram,

I can see how one may be offended by this, but I unfortunately found the
text and the way it is being presented way too comical to be taken
seriously at all.

Shankara Bhagavadpada‚Äôs work is available for all to read and make their
own conclusions regarding the integrity of these claims.

As Acharya says ‚Äú ‡§ú‡•ç‡§û‡§æ‡§®‡§Ç ‡§§‡•Å ‡§™‡•ç‡§∞‡§Æ‡§æ‡§£‡§ú‡§®‡•ç‡§Ø‡§Æ‡•ç ‡•§ ‡§™‡•ç‡§∞‡§Æ‡§æ‡§£‡§Ç ‡§ö ‡§Ø‡§•‡§æ‡§≠‡•Ç‡§§‡§µ‡§∏‡•ç‡§§‡•Å‡§µ‡§ø‡§∑‡§Ø‡§Æ‡•ç ‡•§

‡§ö‡•ã‡§¶‡§®‡§æ‡§§‡§®‡•ç‡§§‡•ç‡§∞‡§Æ‡•ç , ‡§®‡§æ‡§™‡§ø ‡§™‡•Å‡§∞‡•Å‡§∑‡§§‡§®‡•ç‡§§‡•ç‡§∞‡§Æ‡•ç ; ‚Äù (Knowledge of something is born out
of Pramana. And Pramana is a matter dependent on the object. So knowledge
cannot be made one way, unmade, or made to appear another way. It is
dependent on the object only. It is not upto a person.)

In my opinion, instead of trying to stop or counter such nonsense, our
efforts are better invested in reading, reflecting on, and sharing the
teachings of Shankaracharya with like-minded people.

Om tat sat üôè
