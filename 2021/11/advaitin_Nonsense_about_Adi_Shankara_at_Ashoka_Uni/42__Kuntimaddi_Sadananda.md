Vinodji - PraNAms
This is not a joke - the lady who is the author is originally from JNU - Here is some info that I Received who kept following post against Hindutva.------------She is a member of the J N U Gang which is continuously writing filth about anything brahminical culture of India. She has been associated with the prestigious JNU but misused her position. Recently her term ended as adjunct professorship due to age but the faculty used special powers to renominates her through the Vic ship. But her nomination was cancelled by the BJ P Board with the statement that other younger persons should also get an opportunity at a prestigious university.   Om Mukheja---------------------

 Namaskaram,
I can see how one may be offended by this, but I unfortunately found the text and the way it is being presented way too comical to be taken seriously at all.
Shankara Bhagavadpada‚Äôs work is available for all to read and make their own conclusions regarding the integrity of these claims.
As Acharya says ‚Äú‡§ú‡•ç‡§û‡§æ‡§®‡§Ç ‡§§‡•Å ‡§™‡•ç‡§∞‡§Æ‡§æ‡§£‡§ú‡§®‡•ç‡§Ø‡§Æ‡•ç‡•§ ‡§™‡•ç‡§∞‡§Æ‡§æ‡§£‡§Ç ‡§ö ‡§Ø‡§•‡§æ‡§≠‡•Ç‡§§‡§µ‡§∏‡•ç‡§§‡•Å‡§µ‡§ø‡§∑‡§Ø‡§Æ‡•ç‡•§ ‡§Ö‡§§‡•ã ‡§ú‡•ç‡§û‡§æ‡§®‡§Ç‡§ï‡§∞‡•ç‡§§‡•Å‡§Æ‡§ï‡§∞‡•ç‡§§‡•Å‡§Æ‡§®‡•ç‡§Ø‡§•‡§æ‡§µ‡§æ ‡§ï‡§∞‡•ç‡§§‡•Å‡§Æ‡§∂‡§ï‡•ç‡§Ø‡§Æ‡•ç‡•§ ‡§ï‡•á‡§µ‡§≤‡§Ç ‡§µ‡§∏‡•ç‡§§‡•Å‡§§‡§®‡•ç‡§§‡•ç‡§∞‡§Æ‡•á‡§µ ‡§§‡§§‡•ç ; ‡§® ‡§ö‡•ã‡§¶‡§®‡§æ‡§§‡§®‡•ç‡§§‡•ç‡§∞‡§Æ‡•ç , ‡§®‡§æ‡§™‡§ø ‡§™‡•Å‡§∞‡•Å‡§∑‡§§‡§®‡•ç‡§§‡•ç‡§∞‡§Æ‡•ç ;‚Äù (Knowledge of something is born out of Pramana. And Pramana is a matter dependent on the object. So knowledge cannot be made one way, unmade, or made to appear another way. It is dependent on the object only. It is not upto a person.)
In my opinion, instead of trying to stop or counter such nonsense, our efforts are better invested in reading, reflecting on, and sharing the teachings of Shankaracharya with like-minded people.
