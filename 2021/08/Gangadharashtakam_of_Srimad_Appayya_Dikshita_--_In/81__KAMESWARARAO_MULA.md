Dear SUbrahamanyam Sir,                      Can the author show some light on 'Atmarpana Sthuti' by sri appaya diskhita. When dikshtendra wants to test himself and see his allignment with the godess, he consumed poision(Dhatura) and asks his disciples to write down what ever he utters. Any bhashya or commentary/explantion from the athmarpana stuti could be more usefull to me. Any learned are requsted to send some links or bhasya .
Sri GUru padaravdindarpana mastukameswara

Hello friends, I am posting this Sanskrit lecture in my YouTube channel
Tamil Smarta because it is World Sanskrit Day tomorrow.

This is a humble attempt to propagate the study of our Sanskrit texts
through the medium of Sanskrit. How nice it would be if we can study and
understand our Itihasa-puranas, and the works of all our Acharyas & Saints
in the original language in which they have been written.

It is Sanskrit language that will help us stay connected with our Vedic
roots. Even if you do not know Sanskrit, it is absolutely fine. Keep
listening to such lectures over and over again. You will gradually become
familiar with the language and eventually be able to understand all the
Sanskrit texts directly in Sanskrit-- without any translation into your
mother tongue or English.

A Short Introduction to the Stotram I have spoken on in this video:
This is a Stotram which brings out the glories of Lord Śiva described in
the Śrīmad Bhagavatam, Vayaviya Samhita of Siva-mahapuranam, Uttarakhanda
of Padma-puranam, Shatarudra Samhita of Siva-mahapuranam, Drona-parva of
Mahabharata, and Balakandam of Valmiki Ramayanam.
Written in the style of Durga Chandrakala Stuti and Aditya Stotraratmam,
each word of this Stotram represents a larger body of passages from the
Itihasa-puranas.
