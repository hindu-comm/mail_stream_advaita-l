It is that bundle of karmas that has accumulated which results in the 
repeated assumption of new bodies and the delusion that "I am this body." 
This in turn causes more karma and more rebirth infinitely.

By contrast when a yogi or devata takes a body in the way mentioned 
previously it is only instrumental and does not affect him just we 
wouldn't e.g. arrest an actor for murder because his character shot a 
villain in some film action scene.
