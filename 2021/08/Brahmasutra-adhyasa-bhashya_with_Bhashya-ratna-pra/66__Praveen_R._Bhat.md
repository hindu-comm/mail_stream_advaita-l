Namaste,

Gurugala Bhagavan Swami Ramananda Avadhutaru attained Mahasamadhi. He had
guided me to continue teaching Vedanta instead of going back to work. I
feel His prerANa to conduct brahmasUtra-adhyAsa-bhAShya-pATha with
bhAShya-ratna-prabhA TIkA created by another Swami Ramananda ji.üôèüèΩ

Those who are interested may kindly let me know. Mostly, the pATha online
(Google Meet) will be in the same morning slot 6-7 IST when we had
Vicharasagara.

It will be a daily pATha, except on Thursday and prathamA tithi. Sanskrit
vyAkaraNa, tarka and Vedanta study is expected for the pATha to be not
difficult. It will begin after a couple of weeks and continue as long as it
takes. Please note that the merely curious may not benefit from the pATha
as it needs commitment.

Pls register by sending your name, background in vyAkaraNa, tarka and
Vedanta by Whatsapp to 8554899210 or email bhatpraveen at gmail dot com.

gurupAdukAbhyAm,
--Praveen R. Bhat
