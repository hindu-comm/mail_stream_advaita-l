praNAms Sri Sada prabhuji
Hare Krishna

What you are saying below is absolutely right prabhuji.  And that is what shankara also said while explaining terms like :samyaK drushti, bhUma drushTi, samyak darshama, Atmaikatva darshana etc.  And that is what shruti also declare, brahman is left, right, inside, outside, everywhere, everything and ultimate realization nullifies the division like pramAtru, pramANa, prameya.  By the way vaividhyate ( multiplicity) is not the inherent nature of jagat to keep it aloof from brahman and call it as bhrama, the inherent nature of jagat is the one and only material cause (upAdAna kAraNa) which is also nimitta kAraNa.  When answering an objection bhAshyakAra declares : parasyapi AtmanaH avyAkruta jagadAtmatvena vivikshitatvAt it has to be so because the avyAkruta mAya shakti which is vyAkruta in the form of this jagat is nothing but brahman.  sA shaktiH brahmaiva ahaM shakti shaktimatOH ananyatvAt declares lord in geeta.  So jnAni's realization is not about mithyA darshana of jagat it is on the other hand ekatva darshana behind each and everything when one see everything as Atman what can one see with what ??

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
Bhaskar


'aham brahmaasmi' -understanding should involve - recognition (re-cognition) that everything is nothing but Brahman that I am - Hence the world that is seen - which is based on pratyaksha pramaana and the internal understanding which involves aparoxa jnanam have to merge with the recognition that I am in everything - or the Lord or Iswara is in everything and the world out there becomes only a vibhuuti.

antar bahischa tat sarvam vyaapya naaraayana sthitaH -

Hence Krishna's statements that follow one after the other -

sarva bhuutastam aatmaanam sarva bhuutanicha aatmani

and

yo maam pasyati sarvatra sarvan ca mayi pasyati

This knowledge or re-cognition has to arise in the mind of the seeker all the time - for him to be a jnaani.

I know that you are aware of these - just based on the post
