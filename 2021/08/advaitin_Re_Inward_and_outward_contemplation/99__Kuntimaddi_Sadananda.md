Sreenivas Murthy - PraNAms------------- 
This means "I am all this" , "Atman is all this"and "Brahman is all this".
And certainly not "I am in all this" and "Atman is in all this".
Do you see the difference?
------------Not 'really'.
Mithyaa involves sat asat vilakshanam - implying it is not asat also.
Every mithyaa must have a substantive that is satyam - Otherwise it cannot exist - Hence Existence-Consciousness- limitless(Brahman) has to be the very substantive of the universe.
bahu syaam - prajaayeyeti - let me become many and it became - involves creationless creation - vaachaarambhanam vikaaraH or namekevaste creation.
Jeeva, due to ignorance, sees the mithyaa as satya and fails to recognize the underlying satya.
The Vedantic teaching removes that ignorance.
It is the mind of the jeeva which itself is mithyaa feels that what it experiences is satyam - for that mind is only the instructionis given to approach a teacher to understand the underlying satyam of the mithyaa world, that includes the mind of the jeeva too.
Hence the recognition is not from Brahman but for the mind which is confused. It is the mind that has to understand via shravana, manana and nidhidhyaasana that the underlying truth is Brahman - that satyam is aatma that I am - aitat aatma idagam sarvam - tat satyam - sa aatmaa - tat tvam asi - is the teaching to that confused mind.
It is the understanding in the mind for the jnaani that - there is no reality in the plurality that one perceives.
Hence the statement of Krishna (obviously a realized soul)
mayaa tatam idam sarvam jagat avyakta muurthinaamastaani sarva bhuutani (obviously he is seeing the sarva bhuutani) and na cha aham teshu avasthitaH. They are all in me and yet I am unaffected by their continuous changes.
In the very next sloka he says (as though contradicting himself) from the 'real I' point - na cha mastaani bhuutani - there are no beings in me, really.
Look at my glory - pasyam me yogamaiswaram - pointing out his vibhuuti which he discusses more elaborately in the 10th Ch.
Bhaskarji has provided the relevant explanation too.
With this I stop.
