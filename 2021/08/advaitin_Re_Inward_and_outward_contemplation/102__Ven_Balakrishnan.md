Dear Sri Bhaskar-ji

The states you refer to, are all a manifestation of ignorance.  So if ignorance has been removed, the talk of three states is no longer relevant.

Sankaraâ€™s writings cover what you say, but also he writes about the dissolution of particular consciousness, of non-perception of duality, etc.  So the question is whether the former is a teaching step towards the latter; or if the latter is more figuratively meant (ie duality is perceived but is known - by the non-existent mind - to be non dual).

Sankara / Gaudapada, in my understanding, takes us from srsti-drsti -> drsti-srsti -> ajata vada.  Multiple jivas and creation -> no jivas, no creation, no dissolution.  The perception of a jnani and his/her actions, are only in the eyes of the ajnani.  This is also consistent I think, with Ramanamaharishi.

Best wishes,
venkat

In the state of enlightenment (paramArtha jnana) if there is absolute absence of perception (if it is not wrong perception) then it is restricted to one particular state where mind is an inert state like samAdhi.  But shankara says absolute jnana is that something not restricted to any one particular state or in precise terms it is not vyavahAra abhAva jnana but it is vyavahAra bAdhita jnAja.
