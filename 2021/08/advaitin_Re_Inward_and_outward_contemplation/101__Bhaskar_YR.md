the absence of perception etc. in the state of enlightenment

praNAms Sri Venkat prabhuji
Hare Krishna

Could you please elaborate your above statement.  In the state of enlightenment (paramArtha jnana) if there is absolute absence of perception (if it is not wrong perception) then it is restricted to one particular state where mind is an inert state like samAdhi.  But shankara says absolute jnana is that something not restricted to any one particular state or in precise terms it is not vyavahAra abhAva jnana but it is vyavahAra bAdhita jnAja.  

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
