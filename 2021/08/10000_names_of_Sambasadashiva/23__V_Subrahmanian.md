This is a compilation of Ten Thousand Names of Lord Shiva in
Sanskrit alphabetical order, enabling one to worship Shiva by
adding ‘namaH’ at the end of each name.  These names have
been taken from Mahabharatam, Linga Puranam, Brahmavaivarta
Puranam, Vamana Puranam, Koorma Puranam, Varaha Puranam, Matsya
Puranam, Skanda Puranam, Bhavishyottara Puranam, etc. and
ShreeRudra Prashnam, Rudrayamalam, Agama Sarasangraham,
Shivrahasyam, Vyaasa Geetaa, Haalaasya Maahaatmyam, etc of
Yajurveda, and also from other Shiva Stotras having proper
meanings and commentaries. The Chief Minister, Sri Gundu
Guruswami of the King of Karvet in Andhra Pradesh had arranged
with the Asthana Vidvaans of the Royal Court – Pandits
Devarkonda Subrahmanya Shastri and Vedam Nrisimha Deekshitar,
for the compilation of these very great names.
