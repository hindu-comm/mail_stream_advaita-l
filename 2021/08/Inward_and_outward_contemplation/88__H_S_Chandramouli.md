Namaste.

The two questions are not considered to be on par. Understanding “who am I”
is considered to be far  more difficult than understanding the answer to
the question “what is out there”.  For example it is not essential to
acquire sAdhana chatushtaya sampatti  to get at an answer for the latter
question while it is stipulated for the former.  Also the level of manana
and nididhyasana needed for the former is of a far higher level than what
is needed in respect of the latter question. I am not elaborating on this
topic further.

Reg  << if jnana is only jIvabrahmaikyam than how to get from there to
"becoming
everything"?  There must jagadbrahmaikyam too no? >>,

No no.  jagadbrahmaikyam is not correct. Jagat and Brahman enjoy different
levels of Reality. There is no question of their aikyam. Frankly I am
really not sure if I am understanding  this part of your response
correctly. However I do agree paroksha jnana of Brahman is needed to get at
aparoksha jnanam of jIvabrahmaikyam. In my earlier post I had  included
this  under the jaganmithyatva jnana and  paroksha jnana of Brahman.
