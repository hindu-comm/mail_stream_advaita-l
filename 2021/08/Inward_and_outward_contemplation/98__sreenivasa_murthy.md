 Dear Sri Sadananda,
You write :"recognition that I am in everything - or the Lord or Iswara is in everything and the world out there becomes only a vibhuuti." 
Your above quoted statement goes against the teaching of Srutiand hence the statement is an erroneous.
Chandogya Upanishad states : ahamEvEdagM sarvam || 7-25-1 AtmaivEdagaM sarvam || 7-25-2Mundaka states : brahmaivEdagM sarvam variShTham ||
 
This means "I am all this" , "Atman is all this"and "Brahman is all this".
And certainly not "I am in all this" and "Atman is in all this".
Do you see the difference?
With warm regards,Sreenivasa Murthy.

 Perhaps I should also have added that the knowledge that << Brahman is as
much "out there" >> leads to parOksha jnAna only and not to Realization.


Chandramouliji - PraNAms
'aham brahmaasmi' -understanding should involve - recognition (re-cognition) that everything is nothing but Brahman that I am - Hence the world that is seen - which is based on pratyaksha pramaana and the internal understanding which involves aparoxa jnanam have to merge with the recognition that I am in everything - or the Lord or Iswara is in everything and the world out there becomes only a vibhuuti.
antar bahischa tat sarvam vyaapya naaraayana sthitaH -
Hence Krishna's statements that follow one after the other -
sarva bhuutastam aatmaanam sarva bhuutanicha aatmani
and
yo maam pasyati sarvatra sarvan ca mayi pasyati
This knowledge or re-cognition has to arise in the mind of the seeker all the time - for him to be a jnaani.
I know that you are aware of these - just based on the post
My 2c.
Hari Om!
Sadananda
