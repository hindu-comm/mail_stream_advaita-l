Hari Om,
Namaste.


Advaita Siddhi
paricCheda 1 - Agama bAdhoddhAra:
-- Swamy Madhusudana Saraswati

एतच्च सर्वमुक्तं विवरणे - निषप्रपञ्चास्थूलादिवाक्यानुसारेण 'इदं सर्वं
यदयमात्मे' त्यादीनि निषेध्यसमर्पकत्वेनैकवाक्यतां प्रतिपद्यन्ते ; सुषुप्तौ
निष्प्रपञ्चतायां पुरुषार्थत्वदर्शनादिति |
All this has been said in the panchapAdikA vivaraNa - Sentences such as
"all this is the Self" must be interpreted in such a way as to indicate the
negation of the world's reality, so that there is consistency of meaning
with sentences that reveal the nature of Brahman as one completely devoid
of the world, such as "not gross", etc; for the achievement of the
fundamental aims of human existence lies in the attainment of Brahman in
which the world is completely absent, which is experienced in deep sleep.
