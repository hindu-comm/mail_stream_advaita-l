Sri Satchidanandendra Saraswathi Swamiji, in his Sankaraâ€™s Sutra-Bhasya has written:

"It is evident that the mind which is included in the objective kshetra, can never be an immediate means of knowing the real Knower . . . 

This disposes of the contention of some Sankarites who suppose that the intuition of the Atman, is only in Samadhi (trance) attained through reflection on the meaning of the s'ruti, while the experience of the world of multiplicity, may continue for some time in the waking state owing to fructifying karma or a trace of Avidya.

For, this is evidently against both reason and intuition, and is mainly due to not taking Sankara's dictum with regard to trance. In the first place, all empirical experience of duality is restricted to the waking state and not Samadhi or any other particular state. And the delusion of all empirical life is due to adhyasa or superimposition of the properties of the waking body etc. and not in Samadhi. Sankara has proclaimed in his commentary on Sutra 2-1-9 that experience of distinction in waking even after the attainment of Samadhi, is only because of the non- sublation of 'mithyajnana' or superimposition."
