Namaste sir.
Its also interesting to note that that ramanujacharya also didnt quote
bagavtham. It was shri madhvacharya who was the one to mention and write a
summary of it.
The scholars quickly come to the conclusion that it must be a later day
composition. We must not take their view seriously,as these type of
statements arent in line with the tradition.The bagavtham is constantly
quoted in other puranas. And the conclusion will be,they too are of later
day composition. So the scholars view should be taken only if they agree
with the tradition.Acharya quotes from some of the puranas and
upanishads,and there are many which arent quoted in his works. And hence
bagavtham here is of no exception.
Prof B. N. Krishnamurti Sarma has something of interest to say on the date
of Bhagavata Purana, based on his research work on external evidence for
the same, in his learned work on the subject in the Annals of the
Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute of Poona Vol XIV, 1932-33. He states
that Gaudapada (7th century) in his commentary on Uttara Gita refers to the
Bhagavata Purana in the course of his commentary on II, 46 of the text,
quoting the following hemistich: taduktam bhagavate: tesamasau klesa eva
sisyate, nanyadyatha sthulatusavaghatinam. This line is to be identified
with the second line of Bh X.14.4, which is as follows: tesamasau klesa
evasisyate nanyadyatha sthulatusavaghatinam.

Further though there is no direct reference of bagavtham,its believed
acharya did quote it indirectly.

Krishna's stealing the clothes of gopis of Vraja is also mentioned in
Brahma-Vaivarta purana, but the description is different than what
Shankaracarya describes. Shankaracharya's description is consistent with
Bhagavatam's description.

The corresponding verses from Govindastakam and the chapters from Bhagavatam

मृत्स्नामत्सीहेति यशोदाताडनशैशव सन्त्रासं
व्यदितवक्त्रालोकितलोकालोकचतुर्दशलोकालिम् । लोकत्रयपुरमूलस्तम्भं
लोकालोकमनालोकं लोकेशं परमेशं प्रणमत गोविन्दं परमानन्दम् ॥ २॥

mṛtsnāmatsīhēti yaśōdātāḍanaśaiśava-santrāsam
vyāditavaktrālōkitalōkālōkacaturdaśalōkālim| lōkatrayapuramūlastambhaṃ
lōkālōkamanālōkam lōkēśaṃ paramēśaṃ praṇamata gōvindaṃ paramānandam||2||

Worship Govinda who is supreme bliss, who showed the fear of a child when
beaten by Yashodá saying, ``You are eating earth''. and in whose opened
mouth was seen the row of fourteen worlds, visible and invisible, who is
the support of the three worlds (vis., Svarga, pruthvè, pátála), who is in
the form of the worlds, visible and invisible, who cannot be seen, who is
the controller of the universe and who is the supreme Lord. (2)

The corresponding bhagavatam chapter titled SB 10.8: Lord Kṛṣṇa Shows the
Universal Form Within His Mouth <https://www.vedabase.com/en/sb/10/8>

स्नानव्याकुलयोशिद्वस्त्रमुपादायागमुपारूढं व्यदित्सन्तिरथ दिग्वस्त्रा
ह्युपुदातुमुपाकर्षन्तम् । निर्धूतद्वयशोकविमोहं बुद्धं बुद्धेरन्तस्थं
सत्तामात्रशरीरं प्रणमत गोविन्दं परमानन्दम् ॥ ६॥

snānavyākulayōṣidvastramupādāyāgamupārūḍham vyāditsantīratha digvastrā
dātumupākarṣantaṃ tāḥ| nirdhūtadvayaśōkavimōhaṃ buddhaṃ buddhērantaḥstham
sattāmātraśarīraṃ praṇamata gōvindaṃ paramānandam||6||

Worship Govinda who is supreme bliss, who climbed up the tree carrying the
clothes of women busily engaged in their bath and who made them come close
to him for the purpose of giving the clothes to them who were naked and who
desired to get back their clothes, who is free from duality, grief and
delusion, who is wise, who dwells in the intellect, and who is
pure-existence. (6)

Hope this clarifies.
