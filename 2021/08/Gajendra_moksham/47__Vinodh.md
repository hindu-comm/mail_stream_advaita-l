Thank you for the clarification, Subbu-ji. Indeed I was thinking of
Shankara’s bhashyas when I had asked the question. Deeper still I was
perhaps looking for whether Shankara quotes from Bhagavatham to support the
Advaitic view in his works. The reason behind the curiosity is that there
appears to be many instances of the Advaitic teaching in it and I find it
very strange that (almost?) no reference was made to it by the Acharya.

In Kaushik ji’s response, it seemed to me that the verses of Govindashtakam
are very much supporting such an Advaitic view, e.g., “… who is free from
duality…”, “… who is pure existence… “, “… who is supreme bliss…”, etc.
This, together with Kaushik ji’s observation that Shankara’s description
being consistent with Bhagavatham’s description, suggests that Shankara may
have indirectly referred to the Bhagavatham to support the Advaitic
teaching.

However, as you indicate Subbuji, maybe one needs to look into the details
of the similarity between the descriptions given by Shankara and those
given by Bhagavatham and other Puranas to assess whether these references
are really to Bhagavatham or to some other texts.

A possible reason one could conjecture is that perhaps Acharya was
primarily focussing on opposing the ritualists (those who believed that
only work leads to results, which includes moksha) and the nihilists (those
who believed that everything came out of nothing and that moksha is
essentially becoming nothing or sunya). Perhaps, there was no need to
oppose theists (those who believed only a God, who is separate from
oneself, can grant moksha) at his time? Had there been such a (dualistic)
theistic view to counter, perhaps Srimad Bhagavatham, in addition to the
Gita, could have been an excellent text to cite from and show that the God
of the theists is no-different from one’s own self (like what Sri
Sreenivasa Murthy points out) and thereby resolve the differences in view?

Just a wild thought. Any feedback would be greatly appreciated. 🙏

Regarding the quote by Gaudapadacharya, which is from the following verse
of Bhagavatham (
https://vedabase.io/en/library/sb/10/14/4/)

*ŚB 10.14.4*

श्रेय:सृतिं भक्तिमुदस्य ते विभो
क्लिश्यन्ति ये केवलबोधलब्धये ।
तेषामसौ क्लेशल एव शिष्यते
नान्यद् यथा स्थूलतुषावघातिनाम् ॥ ४ ॥

śreyaḥ-sṛtiṁ bhaktim udasya te vibho
kliśyanti ye kevala-bodha-labdhaye
teṣām asau kleśala eva śiṣyate
nānyad yathā sthūla-tuṣāvaghātinām

*Synonyms*
śreyaḥ — of supreme benefit; sṛtim — the path; bhaktim — devotional
service; udasya — rejecting; te — they; vibho — O almighty Lord; kliśyanti
— struggle; ye — who; kevala — exclusive; bodha — of knowledge; labdhaye —
for the achievement; teṣām — for them; asau — this; kleśalaḥ — botheration;
eva — merely; śiṣyate — remains; na — nothing; anyat — other; yathā — just
as; sthūla-tuṣa — empty husks; avaghātinām— for those who are beating.

*Translation*
My dear Lord, devotional service unto You is the best path for
self-realization. If someone gives up that path and engages in the
cultivation of speculative knowledge, he will simply undergo a troublesome
process and will not achieve his desired result. As a person who beats an
empty husk of wheat cannot get grain, one who simply speculates cannot
achieve self-realization. His only gain is trouble.

The above quote seems to suggest a path of devotion to moksha, which
requires a dvaita-bhaava,   however, within the next two verses, the
following is said, which very much resembles an advaitic view:

*ŚB 10.14.6*

तथापि भूमन्महिमागुणस्य ते
विबोद्धुमर्हत्यमलान्तरात्मभि: ।
अविक्रियात् स्वानुभवादरूपतो
ह्यनन्यबोध्यात्मतया न चान्यथा ॥ ६ ॥

tathāpi bhūman mahimāguṇasya te
viboddhum arhaty amalāntar-ātmabhiḥ
avikriyāt svānubhavād arūpato
hy ananya-bodhyātmatayā na cānyathā

*Synonyms*
tathā api — nevertheless; bhūman — O limitless one; mahimā — the potency;
aguṇasya — of Him who has no material qualities; te — of You; viboddhum —
to understand; arhati — one is able; amala— spotless; antaḥ-ātmabhiḥ — with
mind and senses; avikriyāt — not based on material differentiations;
sva-anubhavāt— by perception of the Supreme Soul; arūpataḥ — without
attachment to material forms; hi — indeed; ananya-bodhya-ātmatayā — as
self-manifested, without the help of any other illuminating agent; na —
not; ca — and; anyathā — otherwise.

*Translation*
*Nondevotees, however, cannot realize You in Your full personal
feature. *Nevertheless,
it may be possible for them to realize Your expansion as the impersonal
Supreme by cultivating direct perception of the Self within the heart. But
they can do this only by purifying their mind and senses of all conceptions
of material distinctions and all attachment to material sense objects. Only
in this way will Your impersonal feature manifest itself to them.


Note that, as can be seen from the word-by-word meanings, the italicized
text in the translation above seems to be an addition made by the
translator and not contained within the original text itself.

Taken together, these two verses are not saying anything other than the
path propounded by Advaita Acharyas, that is, to have Ishwara bhakti,
without which one is lead astray (like one beating empty husks), and to
finally attain the limitless one (bhuman) by going beyond all
differentiations (avikriyaat) and experiencing It (sva-anubhavaat) as the
Self which is not known by anything else (ananya-bodhya-atmataya).
