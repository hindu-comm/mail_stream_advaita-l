In bagavatham, the gajendra moksham is well known. The following is the
last stanza of the story from Pothanas translation of bagavatham.

"As soon as he heard cries of Gajendra for help ,Lord Sri Hari started
without a word,,with out taking his weapons.He did not waste time in
getting ready , he didn't wait for his vahana Garuda,he didn't even release
the cloth of his wife which he was holding,in the midst of an
argument....resulting in instantaneous response to rescue his devotee from
danger. The groups of heaven
dwellers and celestial beings exclaimed," Look! Savior is coming, beside
Him is his consort Devi Lakshmi, listen to the sound of conch, look at the
disc in his hand, and His vahana
Garuda flying, Praise the Lord!"!!
Then the Sudarsana disc, released by the Lord, cut the head of crocodile.
Then Sri Hari brought out Gajendra from the lake and with His touch wounds
of the elephant disappeared. He offered lotus with his trunk to his saviour
Sri Hari. The crocodile was relieved of his curse and got his original form
as gandharva".

The Lords daya is indeed endless.
Om namo narayanaya.
