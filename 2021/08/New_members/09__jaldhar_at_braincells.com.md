Gabriel Comia, Jr.
------------------

My name is Gabriel from Manila, Philippines.

In my search of knowing myself, I came to know my birth moon which is hasta 
nakshatra in 4th pada with the motivation to attain moksha, liberation from 
samsara in this lifetime by studying jhana marga.

I learned that a master or guru is really important to guide me in my seach - 
that pointed me in this site to understand more on the Advaita Vedanta 
philosophy.

Thank you and I hope that more light will be shared by the members of this
group.

Sincerely,

Gabriel

Hi, I am Dr. Dhaval Patel. I am interested in Advaita Vedanta as propounded
by Shankaracharya. I intend to get my doubts cleared by honourable scholars
on the list,as and when I am confronted with a text I do not understand.
