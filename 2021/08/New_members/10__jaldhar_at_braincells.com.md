Hello Gabriel, as a result of the merit gained over many lifetimes it 
looks like you have developed a yearning for liberation in this life time. 
Good for you!  Even with a natural inclination it is a difficult goal not 
reached by many but there is no like time like the present.  You are right
that finding a guru is a must.  That's going to very difficult in your 
current location.  I recommend you visit India if you haven't already. 
Books and Internet sites can be helpful but they are not (even this one) 
substitutes for a personal relationship with someone who is both shrotriya 
(educated in the Vedanta shastra) and brahmanishtha (established in 
Brahman.)
