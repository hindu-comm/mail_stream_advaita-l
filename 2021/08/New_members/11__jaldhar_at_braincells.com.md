Interested in knowing more about Advaita Vedanta.

interested to develop my understanding of the real nature.

I am chandra sekhar From Hyderabad.1. I want to clarify and
know various views regarding advaita vedanta from the scholars present.
Please add me to the list for discussions on advaita vedanta on your
website. I have already put a subscription request throughyour site.
2. I have tried mailing Sundararaman_k at dataone.in for the lectures of
Pujyasri Mani Dravida Shastrigal. The mail Id is not working and is
returning the mail, please let me know the way to get these lectures as they
are so profound and will help my learning.


Raman M
-------

I come from a traditional advaitic vedic family, although I have taken up
the modern education and occupation. I have been reading advaiata vedanta
both formally and informally through classes and online lectures and have a
fairly good priliminary understanding of the philosophy and its basis. In
order to sharpen the knowledge and learn from others, I would like to be
added to the group. My initial interest ofcourse is to watch and learn and
seek clarifications or explanation, ocassional sharing of my thoughts or
observations.
