Namaste Subbu jiThanks for sharing those.
I am reminded of the insinuation by certain "Indologists" particularly in western academia of the Max Weber ilk, that the vedantic traditions emphasize an excessively individualistic "selfish" pursuit laden with indifference to the welfare of other human beings. And that only the Bodhisattva idea of the Buddhists fares better. In contrast, we are told that there is more social responsibility and a desire to help others in Christian traditions.
Quotations like the above expose the fallaciousness of such judgements on the effect of Vedanta on an individual's attitudes.

शान्तामहान्तो निवसन्ति सन्तोवसन्तवल्लोकहितं चरन्तः ।तीर्णाः स्वयं भीमभवार्णवं जनानहेतुनान्यानपि तारयन्तः ॥ ३९ ॥
37. There are good souls, calm and magnanimous, who do good to others as does the spring, and who, having themselves crossed this dreadful ocean of birth and death, help others also to cross the same, without any motive whatsoever.

The simile of 'dreadful ocean of samsara' and 'having oneself crossed' in the above verse is found in the SB in the very same words too:
ŚB 10.2.31
स्वयं समुत्तीर्य सुदुस्तरं द्युमन्
भवार्णवं भीममदभ्रसौहृदा: ।
भवत्पदाम्भोरुहनावमत्र ते
निधाय याता: सदनुग्रहो भवान् ॥ ३१ ॥svayaṁ samuttīrya sudustaraṁ dyuman
bhavārṇavaṁ bhīmam adabhra-sauhṛdāḥ
bhavat-padāmbhoruha-nāvam atra te
nidhāya yātāḥ sad-anugraho bhavānThe word-similarity is striking. The meaning too is almost similar.regards
