How can the sarvajna isvara need development and research?? He is
omnipotent.
The gunas are allocated on the basis of creation,protection and
destruction. That is , he is only brahma when associated with Rajas while
creation. He is only vishnu when he is associated with sattva and he is
only rudra  when associated with tamas at the time of destruction.
