Namaste Shri Kaushik,

What I am writing is based on my understanding.

Ishvara who is omnipotent, omniscient and omnipresent is an asymptotic state.
brahmA, viShNu and rudra are super advanced spiritual beings. From our level
they are no different fromIshvara, It is like a student in Std I (us) regarding his
teacher as all knowing.
Yet, brahmA, viShNu and rudraare themselves involved in an eternal sAdhanA.
They are our well wishers, our guru-s, our protectors. The are the embodiments
ofIshvara (tattva) for us.

You can ignore this viewpoint if this does not appeal to you.

Regards,
Shrinivas Gadkari
