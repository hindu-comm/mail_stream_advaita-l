This is the truth.  It is impossible for the Creator to do away with or
wish away the rajas and tamas. This concept is very firmly enshrined in the
scriptures, especially the Vishnu Purana and the Bhagavatam.  Unless
Brahman depends on rajas and tamas it can never accomplish creation and
destruction.  One guna cannot function to the exclusion of the others.
This is the Vedantic truth.
