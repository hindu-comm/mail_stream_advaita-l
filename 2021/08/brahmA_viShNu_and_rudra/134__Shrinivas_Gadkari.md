Namaste,

Lately, there have been quite a few posts that seem to compare
viShNu and shiva.

It may be useful to refer to the following post wherein
Shri Jaldhar has shared a translation the prAdhAnika rahasya.
https://www.advaita-vedanta.org/archives/advaita-l/2009-September/022572.html

Please note that brahmA, viShNu and rudra are special sons
of Adi mAtA caNDikA. They are involved in continuous
research and development with focus on vidyAs related
to the three guNa-s.
- brahmA has been assigned to focus more on rajo guNa
- viShNu has been assigned to focus more on sattva guNa
- rudra has been assigned to focus more on tamo guNa

Please note, there is no reason to rate one guNa as superior
and other guNa as inferior. They all are guNa-s meaning
(positive) qualities. None of them are called doSha-s
meaning defects.

brahmA, viShNu and rudra support and complement each other.

Regards,
Shrinivas Gadkari
