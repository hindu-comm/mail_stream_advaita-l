 On this auspicious night, the Lord of all auspicious qualities took birth
in the dungeons of kamsa. Kamsa thought krishna would be the cause of his
death, rather he became the cause of Kamsas liberation. He indeed is chinni
krishna to his devotees but is narsimha to the demons.
The sandhyavandhana has a very clear slokha -
"Sarva vedesu yat punyam, sarva tirtheshu yEt phalam, tat phalam
purushapnoti stutva devam janardanam".
