This is a mega initiative of publishing the Complete Works of Adishankara
in Malayalam.  Pl. read the English booklet and also share the above
material in other groups.  They are now on Soundarya Lahari Parayanam
teaching and about 1 lakh people are involved, headed for a grand
samaropanam on Karthika Pournami at Tiruvananthapuram.  They will also be
doing Bhashya Parayanam at Kalaty.

Here are two booklets, one in Malayalam and another in English, giving
details about the project.  One can read the booklet and give whatever
suggestion that is relevant, addressing it to the email id given therein.
