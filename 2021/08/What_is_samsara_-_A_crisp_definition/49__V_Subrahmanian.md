In the Bh.Gita Bhashyam 13.20, Shankara gives a succinct definition of
'samsara', bondage:

कः पुनः अयं संसारो नाम? *सुखदुःखसम्भोगः संसारः ।*

What indeed is this 'samsara'?  It is the experiencing of joy and sorrow.

पुरुषस्य च सुखदुःखानां सम्भोक्तृत्वं संसारित्वमिति ॥ २० ॥

And the self becomes bound by his experiencing joy and sorrow.

Further, how does this come about?

यदा पुनः कार्यकरणसुखदुःखस्वरूपेण हेतुफलात्मना परिणतया प्रकृत्या भोग्यया
पुरुषस्य तद्विपरीतस्य भोक्तृत्वेन अविद्यारूपः संयोगः स्यात् , तदा संसारः
स्यात् इति ।

When the self, who is distinct from the not-self, objects of experience,
out of ignorance, is identified with them as their experiencer, then he
becomes bound.

The central message of the 13th chapter is to present to the aspirant the
distinction between the self and the not-self and inform that the self is
non-different from Brahman and also that the not-self does not have an
absolute existence. This knowledge constitutes liberation.
