Very nice answer and interpretation of "matha" 🙏

Sri KSV:

“I have stated the truth. If they agree it is well and good. If they do not
agree, they do not know the truth”. The important information to know is
that Shaiva, Vaishnava gAnapatya, Kaumara etc. are mathas. Matha means that
which is related to the human mathi, or buddhi or intellect. It is clearly
said that the truth (satya) is beyond the grasp of mathi in the Upanishads :

Atma is beyond the intellect. Intellect cannot comprehend Atman. Hence, in
the past, when people could not maintain their atma-jnana at a high level
of the AdhyAtma or Brahman, they had to come down to the level of their
intellect. Then came the different mathas such as Vaishnava, Shaiva etc.
due to mathi-bheda, difference in intellect.
