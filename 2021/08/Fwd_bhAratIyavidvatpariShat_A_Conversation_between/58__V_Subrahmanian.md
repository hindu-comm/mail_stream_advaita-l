Here is a two-page document in English on a dialogue, 70 years ago,
between  HH the Kanchi Maha Periyava and MM Sri
Kothimangalam.S.Varadacharya (who passed away recently at a very ripe age
of 99).  The thrust of this dialogue is: Hari and Hara are fundamentally
Pure Consciousness and the vision of this erases all difference and
acrimony.  These are the wise words of the above scholar.
