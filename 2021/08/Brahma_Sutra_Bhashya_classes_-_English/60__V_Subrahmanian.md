Dear Devotees,

Brahma Sutras, Vedanta Sutras, or Shariraka Sutras are a collection of 555
sutras arranged into four chapters that form part of the Nyaya Prasthana
part of Hinduism or Sanatana Dharma, to be studied, traditionally, after
having studied the Bhagavadgita, Smriti Prasthana, and the Upanishads,
Shruti Prasthanas. The sutras, aphorisms of the Brahma Sutras analyse
different Upanishadic statements to understand their true import. The aim
of the Brahma Sutras is to remove the ignorance that clouds one's true
nature and realise the ultimate reality, Brahman. The Brahma Sutras have
been authored by Badarayana Vyasa, traditionally considered to be the same
person who classified the Vedas, wrote the Puranas,  the Mahabharata, and
the Bhagavata.

In the ongoing series of Brahma Sutra Lectures, Brahma Sutras and Adi
Shankaracharya’s commentary on it with emphasis on their relevance in the
present day are being explained by Swami Narasimhanandaji Maharaj of the
Ramakrishna Math and Mission.

We would like to have more and more devotees take benefit from the lecture
series. Hence, request you to share this message with as many contacts as
possible 🙏
