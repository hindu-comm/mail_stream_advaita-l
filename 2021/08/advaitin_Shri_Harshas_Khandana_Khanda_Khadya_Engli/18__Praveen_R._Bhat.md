Yes, that was the intention in saying that Naiyyayikas were dvaitins, not
the modern day Dvaita-Vedantins though. In one of the
mangalAcharaNas addressed to Shiva, I recall someone explaining that the
Tarkikas jovially blackmail Shiva that if he doesn't help them understand
the padArthas, they will complain to Parvati that he is hiding Ganga on his
head! :-)

Thanks, I recall reading this. As an aside, Sadhu Nischaladasa has done a
good summary of the utility of other darshanas in Vicharasagara.
