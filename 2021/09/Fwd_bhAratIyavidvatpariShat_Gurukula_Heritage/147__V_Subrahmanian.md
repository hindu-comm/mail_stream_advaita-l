Dear Colleague
I am sharing a general article on the Heritage of Gurukula System,
published in the
 Asian Journal of Professional Ethics & Management, Vol.13, no.3
July-September, 2021.
This is mainly based on my invited talk at the National Seminar "Ethics in
Indian Higher Education"
on 25th June, 2021. ( https://youtu.be/BjLbd3URdB0 )
Your feedback is welcome.
Thanks

RN Iyengar
