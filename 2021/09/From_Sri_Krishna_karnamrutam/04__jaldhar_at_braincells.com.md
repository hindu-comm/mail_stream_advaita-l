Pushti Marga is one of the four principal Vaishnava Sampradayas and was
  established by Vallabhacharya (so you sometimes see its 
followers described as Vallabhacharis.)  Its' philosophy is Shuddhadvaita 
Vedanta ("shuddha" because it is purified of the "mayavada" Vaishnavas 
dislike so much.)  The grhastha Goswamis who are the descendents of 
Vallavhacharya are the gurus of this sect.  They are different from the 
Vrndavan Goswamis who are Gaudiyas.

It is very popular in Gujarat and Marwada in particular and though I do 
not believe in its tenets it has been a big cultural influence on me. 
The well-known Bhagavata kathakara Golokavasi Krishnashankar Shastriji was 
a Pushti Margi and I consider him as a Guru.
