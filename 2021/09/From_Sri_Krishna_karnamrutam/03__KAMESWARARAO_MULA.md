Dear Sir,        After receving your mail and I too searched regarding the Garga Samhita and got a pdf file of its english version of it. here is the link of that for any one who is interested.https://www.radha.name/sites/default/files/documents/1509/Garga%20Sanhita.pdf

accordingly, Radha was born to King Vrishbhanu and kiriti in the Vraj bhumi and looks like her appearence on the brindavan before the birth of lord krishna. I will write in detail after reading the Brahmma Vaivartapurana and Garga samhita completely
I have been to Goverdhana parikrama (~18km-shorter one) on the full moon nights and sprinkled water from the Radha Kund, it is believed that on the 'Vasantha Pournima' i.e Rasa Pournima (Holi) and many people witnessed also two stars in the form of light comes to Radha kund take a dip in that water and goes back to the celestial region in the midnight.

What is "Pushti Margis"?, as I heard this name several times & don't know the details and is it similar to 'Vaishnavism'?

As well as Gitagovinda and Brahmavaivarta Purana which were already 
mentioned, Pushti Margis and other North Indian Vaishnavas also hold a 
work called Garga Samhita in greet esteem. It is not as far as I know 
part of a Purana but an independent "purana-style" work. It has a lot of 
information about the tirthas in Vrndavana, the life of Radha and Her 
dalliances with Krishna Bhagavan etc. The edition I have was published by 
Khemraj Shrikrishnadass publishers with a Hindi translation.
