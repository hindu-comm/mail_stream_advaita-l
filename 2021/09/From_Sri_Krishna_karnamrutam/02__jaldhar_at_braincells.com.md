As well as Gitagovinda and Brahmavaivarta Purana which were already 
mentioned, Pushti Margis and other North Indian Vaishnavas also hold a 
work called Garga Samhita in greet esteem.  It is not as far as I know 
part of a Purana but an independent "purana-style" work.  It has a lot of 
information about the tirthas in Vrndavana, the life of Radha and Her 
dalliances with Krishna Bhagavan etc.  The edition I have was published by 
Khemraj Shrikrishnadass publishers with a Hindi translation.
