Subject: {भारतीयविद्वत्परिषत्} Is Nimbarka's Bhagavata commentary available?
To: BHARATIYA VIDVAT <bvparishat at googlegroups.com>


Namaste

Here is a mention of a commentary on the Bhagavata by Nimbarka:

https://hinduism.stackexchange.com/questions/44926/what-is-the-nimbarka-view-of-the-bhagavata-purana


// The siddhAnta pradIpikA is a nimbArka commentary on the bhAgavata
purANa. //

Is this book published and available anywhere?  In the multiple commentary
Bhagavatam which contains many texts including that of Vallabhacharya (sri
subodhini), the Nimbarka text is not there.

Any information about this commentary is welcome.

Thanks and regards
subrahmanian.v
