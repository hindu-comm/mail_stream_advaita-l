Namaste,

Consider everything that is made of clay. Let us call the devatA of everything that is
made of clay - "devatA of clay". By devoting oneself to understanding objects made of clay,
one will start to know this "devatA of clay". As one's devotion to this "devatA of clay" deepens
one will start understanding more and more about objects made of clay.

Now generalize this paradigm.

Regards,
Shrinivas Gadkari
