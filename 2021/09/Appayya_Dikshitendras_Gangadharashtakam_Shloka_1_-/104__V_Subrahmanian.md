Srimad Appayya Dikshitendra Jayanti Series: Day 1

Gangadharashtakam Shloka 1: A Summary of Lord Siva's glory described in
Srimad Bhagavatam (Canto 8/chapter 7). Churning of the Ocean of Milk and
Lord Siva Drinking the Deadly Poison to Save the Universe.

Part 1 of this Video (Minute 0.00 to 5.11):
Explanation of the shloka by glossing over each of words in it.

Part 2 of this Video (Minute 5.12 to 16.24):
Contemplation on the purport of Chapter 7, Canto 8 of Srimad Bhagavatam. A
discussion on the commentaries of Madhvacharya and Satyadharma Tirtha
Swamigal of Uttaradi Matha on this chapter. Here is a discussion on their
interpretation of Vayu Bhagavan consuming the deadly poison to save Lord
Siva and thereby making Apakarshanam of the Lord. Dikshitendra's
explanation of the same in His Brahmatarka Stava has also been given. Even
a superficial study of the chapter reveals that the conclusion of Srimad
Bhagavatam is in Advaita alone and both Lord Vishnu and Lord Siva are
treated equally.

Part 3 of the Video (16.25 to 20.52):
Parayanam of Siva-stuti made in this chapter by the Devas and Asuras.
