Revered Self,

Sadar Pranam,

It is an old argument against non duality that "if a tree falls in a forest
and there is nobody there, does it still make a sound?"

My questions are:
1)How is this an argument against Non-Duality?
2)What is the answer from a Non-Dualist perspective?

Thanks in advance. Pranam,

OM
