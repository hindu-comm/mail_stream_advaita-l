Acharya Nochur Venkataraman has authored a work titled Atmatirtham, an
independent Vedantic epic, that covers the life and teachings of Acharya
Shankara Bhagavatpaada

The style of writing is unique wherein it intensely focuses on the teachings

The author has also carefully stayed away from all the controversies
surrounding Bhagavatpaada's life and timeline

More than facts, the highest goal of Self-realisation, is always kept in
the background of the subject matter

This work has been a divine instrument through which Grace has flowed into
the lives of many sincere seekers.
