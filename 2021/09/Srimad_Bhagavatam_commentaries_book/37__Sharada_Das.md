Pranams, I am interested in reading the commentaries on the Srimad
Bhagavatam (Sridhara swami, vamshidhara sharma etc) but unfortunately i
cannot read and understand Devanagari script. Are there any
Telugu/English/Kannada translations of the commentaries available in hard
copy or soft copy format ? If you do know, please guide me in that
direction.
Thanks in advance,
