Sorry its not completely clear whether you want a) Shridhari etc. in 
Sanskrit but in roman/telugu/kannada lip or b) the same translated into
English/Telugu/Kannada.  Unfortunately I don't know of either.  The 
Bhagavata edition I use on a regular basis is in Gujarati and 
is inspired by Shridharacharyas interpretations but is not strictly 
speaking a translation but a paraphrase.  I suspect the situation is the 
same in other Indian languages.
