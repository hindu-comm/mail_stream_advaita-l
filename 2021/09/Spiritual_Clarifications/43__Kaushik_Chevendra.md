Namaste respected sir. I will try to clarify the questions with respect to
my understanding.

The "true benifit" is mukthi. Which comes only through the understanding
that everything is brahman. To understand this we need to see how is that
possible. And hence the substratum being the mud and the pot is the
superimpostion. How? If the sense aren't there to perceive it, will there
be any form to perceive? Is there any difference between mud and pot if the
eye isn't there to perceive the shape and give a name to it?

The example of pot and mud is used to explain, brahman and the world. One
should not bring about other implications of it. A simile or an example
used to explain a phenomenon is restricted to it.

Depends on who these "vaishnavas" are. If they are smarthas, then they hold
it authoritative. If not they won't. Just as an advaitin won't hold
madhvacharyas work of" sadachara smriti" which is also generic as
authoritative.

What sampradaya? There are many schools of vaishnavas. The visitadvaita,
dvaita, achintya, etc. Depends on which one. In advaita everyone qualifies
for mukthi, if not in this life. But the madhwas hold some to be eternally
bound.
