I am humbly posing some questions below in front of the esteemed members of this forum, purely to get genuine clarifications, and definitely not to stir any controversy. I would be greatly benefited by your insights.
(1) Do Vaishnavities accept the content of Tatva Bodha? I feel that 90% contents are generic and hence applicable universally, except perhaps Vaishnavites interpretation of Moksham. What is the opinion here?
(2) Some Vaishnavities that i know have problem with Advaita/Sankara mainly on two grounds (a) Adi Sankarar's reference to God's face as being like back of a monkey? This really beats me.. Where as Ramanujar interpreets that as Sun's rays on blooming lotus (b) They claim that in Advaita, there is no moksha for animals, birds, women or non-brahmins and that Advaita has Moksha only for male, brahmis and sanyasis, where as in their sampradaya any living thing can get moksha.. is this true?
