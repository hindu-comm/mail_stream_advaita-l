Dear Sri Bhaskar-ji

If you read the SSSS quote carefully you can see that he is dismissing the experience of duality for a jnani.  And likewise he is dismisising Samadhi or avid lesha as relevant for a jnani; as if someone comes out of samadhi to see multiplicity again, then it is “because of the non-sublation of mithyajnana”.



Best wishes,
venkat

Would you mean to say Sri SSS is endorsing the MUST experience of samAdhi and avidya lesha after realization??  A line of confirmation in this regard would be highly appreciated.

In the first place, all empirical experience of duality is restricted to the waking state and not Samadhi or any other particular state. And the delusion of all empirical life is due to adhyasa or superimposition of the properties of the waking body etc. and not in Samadhi. Sankara has proclaimed in his commentary on Sutra 2-1-9 that experience of distinction in waking even after the attainment of Samadhi, is only because of the non- sublation of 'mithyajnana' or superimposition."
