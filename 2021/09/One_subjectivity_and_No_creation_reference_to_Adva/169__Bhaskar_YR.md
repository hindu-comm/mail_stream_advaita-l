And if there is very strong and undisputable similarities are there between the doctrine of Buddhism and Advaita and if it is in line with shruti then scholars would quote bhAshyakAra who generously said : paramataM apratishiddham anumataM bhavati ðŸ˜Š So no qualms there even if both vijnAnavAda and advaita say that jagat, what we see is mere phantom city (gaNdharva nagari).

  *   Kindly pardon me, I donâ€™t want to go deep into it as my knowledge in Buddhism is quite poor (almost nil) and what I read about buddhism is only what is available in advaita worksðŸ˜Š  So cannot authoritatively say anything about doctrine of Buddhism according to their accepted authentic works.  If I am right, even in the Buddhism also they will accept the existence (astitvaM).  The existence of shUnyatvaM.  And in vijnAnavAda too they accept the existence of constructive imagination of external object by chitta (mind).  The kArikAkAra too attributes the existence of external objects to kampana (vibration) of chitta.  Samanvaya needs to be done with the help of shruti, yukti and anubhava.

Namaste sir.
You have given quite an excellent response. From your post it seems to be that the dualists contention is true. Probably the scholars will have to shed light on this.
In my opinion the difference between the shunya and brahman is existence. In the sense that shunya is absence of anything. Whereas in av there is absence of anything other than brahman.
