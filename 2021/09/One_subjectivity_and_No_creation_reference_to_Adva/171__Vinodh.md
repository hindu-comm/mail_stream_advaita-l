Namaskaram,

This my understanding on the similarity and difference between Buddhist
nihilism (sunyavaadam) and Advaitam.

They both claim that this world is illusory and this is the similarity
between these two systems. However, Buddhist nihilism claims that
everything seems to comes out of nothing (sunya) whereas Advaita says that
there is something (brahmam or atma) out of which everything seems to
appear.

The Advaitic argument against the Buddhist nihilist view is that there has
to be something as a base for any illusion, like a rope for the illusory
snake or a conch for the illusory silver or a tree stump for an illusory
man. An illusion cannot come out of nothing. There is something that exists
which just appears as something else. It is not that nothing exists and
still something seems to appear like the Buddhist view claims.

An interesting Buddhist counterpoint I have heard is from the Chandyoga
Upanishad Shankara bhashya in the 6th adhyaya (also called ‚Äúsatvidya‚Äù) in
the context of the following two sruti statements:

1. Somya, before this world was manifest there was only existence, one
without a second. On this subject, some maintain that before this world was
manifest there was only non-existence, one without a second. Out of that
non-existence, existence emerged.

The sruti itself posits both these views and asserts that the second view
corresponding to Buddhist nihilism is invalid.

In Shankara‚Äôs bhashya, a Buddhist nihilist objection is raised and replied
to where the objection goes something like this. We all see that a seed has
to be completely destroyed in order for a tree to grow from it. So
according to them this is an example of something coming from nothing.
Shankaracharya argues that only the form of the seed is lost but the
material goes to make the tree, because the essence of the type of tree
(mango or neem etc) is in the seed. Otherwise any tree can grow from any
seed. Therefore he says that there is no example of something coming out of
nothing.
