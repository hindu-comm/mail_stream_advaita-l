I am interested in studying about and knowing more about Vedanta and, in
particular, Advaita texts.

To that end, I am interested in joining this group to learn and study.

-----------

I am a spiritual seeker studying advaita vedanta since 6-7 years with the
help of lectures of HH Swami Paramarthanandaji. I came across this site and
email thread when I was searching for some information. I find this email
thread to be a great satsangha and an opportunity for mananam and
nididhyasanam in my spiritual journey.
