 Sri Krishna Karnaamrutam-V





LittleKrishna is famous for stealing butter from the houses of Gopis. Although Gopisgo and complain to Yashoda mayyaa, they actually want the child to cometo their house and steal the butter as they were fascinated by him. They makeall the preparations to make sure he comes and steals so that they can catchhim and have fun with him. However, Krishna plans in such a way that he doesnot get caught. There wasonce this Gopi who makes all carefulpreparations to make sure she catches him red-handed, while he is stealing thebutter. She keeps the butter vessel not too high, but not too low, and in sucha way that he can reach by climbing some nearby stool, but once climbed noteasy to get out. 



Krishnaalso knows this, in a way. He and his friends slowly walk-in when there is no oneis around and climbs a stool and digs into the pot. There was a lot offresh-tasty butter there. Krishna takes a handful and starts distributing tohis friends one by one. Once they all have had enough, he takes one moor scoopand starts eating. All this was being silently observed by the Gopi, who washiding behind, and she slowly walks behind him and catches hold of Krishnawhile all his friends were seeing her coming escape from there. Since she isonly interested in Krishna and not in his friends, she holds him tight so thathe cannot escape. The following sloka depicts an interesting conversation, orshould I say exciting interrogation of little Krishna - it goes like this, asLeelasuka watches:



कस्त्व्म्बाल? बालानुजः, किमिहते? मन्मन्दिरा शन्कया; 

युक्तम्;तन्नवनीत पात्रे विवरे हस्तम् किमर्थम् न्यसे? 

मातः! कन्चनवत्सकम् मृगयितुम् मगा विषादम् क्षणात्;

इत्येवम्वरवल्लवी प्रति वचः कृष्णस्य पुष्णातु नः II-82

kastvam baala? baalaanujaH, kimihate? manmandiraa shankayaa;
yuktam; tannavaneeta paatre vivare hastam kimartham nyase?
maataH! kancana vatsakam mRigayitum magaa viShaadam kshaNaat;
ityevam varavallavii prati vacaH Krishnasya puShNaatu naH|| II-82

Gopi- Little boy, who are you?

Krishna: I am the brother of Balarama. Without saying I am Krishna, he isdragging his elder brother into the scene of the crime, who was not at allinvolved. It reminds me of a story of a thief who was caught red-handed, andeveryone there started beating him, with neighbors also giving a hand withoutquestioning the thief. A stranger was walking by, looks at the scene, andasked what happened, with a contemptuous look at the thief, thinking that hecan also join in giving the beating. Anticipating this, the thief replied loudenough that everyone can hear- ‘Sir, I did exactly what you asked me todo, you escaped, but I got caught.’ Hearing this, the people around leftthe thief and caught hold of the other stranger and started beating the hell outof him. Krishna thought perhaps his punishment would be less if he includesBalarama also into the crime.

Gopi: What are you doing here?

Krishna: I thought that this is my house, so I came inside – says this veryinnocently as a matter of fact.


Gopi and Krishna both know that he was lying.

Gopi: Oh, I see. OK. But why are you putting your hands into the butter-pot?She must have said this, pretending to be angry for the responses he wasgiving.

Krishna: Oh! Mother! We have to be quiet here. Your shouting may frightenthings here. You see, I am looking for a small calf which is frightened andrunning around here. I am searching for it and checking to see if it hasentered into this butter-pot. Please be quiet; it may get frightened.

That Gopi lady must have become quite, not that she will frighten a small calf,but wondering how this little Krishna is confidently answering without anyfear, even after getting caught red-handed.

That little Krishna, who is having this funny conversation with the Gopi, mayhe protect us.

Butter is symbolic of vaasanaas- the result of our actions. None can remainfrom acting. Action done with an attitude of doe-ship or kartrutva bhaava,will not only give tangible results but leaves subtle impressions. Vasanaaspropel actions and action will give vaasanaas -one gets caught up in thisnever-ending cycle –punarapi jananam punarapi maranam - which Vidyaranyasays –nadyaam keetaa iva aavartaat avartaantaramaashnu te -– like aninsect caught in a whirlpool and moving from one whirlpool to the other in thefast-moving river of samsaar. The vicious cycle can only be brokenby offering the results of the action to the Lord. For those who have surrendered,Krishna himself will come and take away or neutralize the vaasanaas.


Let that Krishna, who is happy to take away our impurities, protect usall.
