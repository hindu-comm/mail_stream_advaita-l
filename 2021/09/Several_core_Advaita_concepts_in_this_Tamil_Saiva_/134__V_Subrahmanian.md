Ilangai Jeyaraj is a very popular, extremely learned speaker.  In this
video of about one hour, I was pleasantly surprised to find many an
Advaitic concept so natural to this Saiva school:

1. The idea that Jnana, Bhakti, Dhyana, Karma Yogas are not standalone
paths but need to be integrated for sadhana.

2. Triputee dissolves at the end.

3. Several methods/means are there within the system to reach the goal:
yaya yaya bhavet pumsam .....of Sureshwaracharya.

4. The more one tries to probe the world, the more questions and ignorance
one faces: निरूपयितुमारब्धे निखिलैरपि पण्डितैः | अज्ञानं पुरतस्तेषां भाति
कक्षासु कासुचित् || of the Panchadashi.
