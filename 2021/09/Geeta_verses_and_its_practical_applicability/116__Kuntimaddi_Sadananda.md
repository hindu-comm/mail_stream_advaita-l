Baskarji - Your question is aptly answered by lives of Rama and Krishna. It shows how a jnaani lives.
One need not be a doormat for others to step on- yet even the punishment is given with compassion - like father punishes a child for misbehavior. Every Hindu God is fully equipped with appropriate missiles.
Same way, a jnaani says samatvam in terms of the essence but at the transactional level appropriately, as needed, to set things right or for the protection of Dharma.

there are two beautiful verses in geeta chapter 12, samaH shatrau cha mitre cha, tathaa mAnApamAnayOH, tulyanindAstutirmounI etc. are these verses meant for only sthita prajnA-s as described in 2nd chapter or is this the virtue should be adopted/developed by sAdhaka-s in day to day vyavahAra ?? Just curious to know practical application of these verses in our day to day life. are these verses applicable only in our spiritual sAdhana or equally applicable and efficacious in our day to day materialistic life?? For example if our boss fires us or wife scolds us or dvaitins abuses our Acharya baselessly, immediately, without thinking about these verses, we should settle the scores or should keep quiet maintaining the tranquility of mind?? Just wonder are these verses meant for sAdhana in vyAvahArik world??

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
