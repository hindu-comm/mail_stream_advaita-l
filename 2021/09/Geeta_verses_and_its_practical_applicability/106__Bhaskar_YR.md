there are two beautiful verses in geeta chapter 12, samaH shatrau cha mitre cha, tathaa mAnApamAnayOH, tulyanindAstutirmounI etc.  are these verses meant for only sthita prajnA-s as described in 2nd chapter or is this the virtue should be adopted/developed by sAdhaka-s in  day to day vyavahAra ??  Just curious to know  practical application of these verses in our day to day life.  are these verses applicable only in our spiritual sAdhana or equally applicable and efficacious in our day to day materialistic life??  For example if our boss fires us or wife scolds us or dvaitins abuses our Acharya baselessly, immediately, without thinking about these verses, we should settle the scores or should keep quiet maintaining the tranquility of mind??  Just wonder are these verses meant for sAdhana in vyAvahArik world??

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
