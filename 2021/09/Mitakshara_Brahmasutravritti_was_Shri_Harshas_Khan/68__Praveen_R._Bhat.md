Namaste Jaldharji and others


However it should not be thought thay Nyaya demands only a dualistic
>> interpretation.  Annam Bhatta, the author of the most popular
>> introductory
>> work on Nyaya throughout India, the Tarka Samgraha was an Advaitin.  He
>> describes his father one Tirumala as "Advaitavidyacharya".  He himself
>> also wrote a vrtti on Brahmasutra Shankarabhashya called mitakshara which
>> has been published I think.

> FYI, Mitakshara vRtti is available here:
https://archive.org/details/bsmitakshara with Mangalacharana expressing its
following Bhamati and beautiful opening words: तत्र तावत् आत्मा वा अरे
द्रष्टव्यः श्रोतव्यः इति फलमनूद्य तत्साधनत्वेन श्रवणं विधीयते। श्रवणं नाम
वेदान्तवाक्यानामद्वितीये ब्रह्मणि तात्पर्यनिर्णयानुकूलो न्यायविचारः।
