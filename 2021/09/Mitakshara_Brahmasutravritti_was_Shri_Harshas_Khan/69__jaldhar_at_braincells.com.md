Thankyou.  It is interesting to me that the Bhamatikara, Vachaspati 
Mishra, is also considered an authoritative acharya in Nyaya (and Samkhya, 
and Yoga as well.)  He is known as tatparyacharya because of his 
tatparyatika on the Nyayasutrabhashya.  So perhaps there is some special 
affinity between the Bhamati line of thinking in Advaita Vedanta and 
Nyaya?  Something that needs more research.
