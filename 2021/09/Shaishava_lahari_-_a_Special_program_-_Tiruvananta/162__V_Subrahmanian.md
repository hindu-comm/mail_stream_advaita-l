As part of the ongoing Soundaryalahari extensive movement in Kerala with
special focus in Tiruvanantapuram, there are many programs planned. One
such is 'Shaishava lahari'.  A selection of five verses of the Soundarya
lahari was taught to children below five years of age and this was featured
on zoom today. It is noteworthy that several infants from various locations
participated in this event and recited the verses - and the whole event was
compered by a young student. The program ended with the children singing
the Soundarya Lahari Aarati song.

It is a delight to watch the event marked to pay homage to the Mother and
Bhagavatpada Shankara.
