Namaste,


Sharing some thoughts on the topic of yajna, homa ... based on my
understanding of these topics:

- Yajna is a symbolic/ abstracted version of how karma / actions
 are to be executed with perfection in our daily lives.
- If one is able to study a yajna manual and understand the symbolic
 language in it, it can become a practical, well researched, ancient manual
 on how to execute actions with perfection - this is the yajna vidyA that gItA
 talks about.
- The actual yajna/ homa ritual can also be occasionally performed to
 help indirectly infuse the principles of perfecting action in our
 lives. These are the supporting rituals of yajna vidyA.

One question: Very often we read recommendations of the type: Perform
japa N times, and offer into fire N/10 times. This seems to suggest
before offering an action to Ishvara, practice it 10X more. Any insights
that others may have on this topic?


Regards,
Shrinivas Gadkari
