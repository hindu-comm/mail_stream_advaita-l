Dear Shrinivas Gadkari,
One question: Very often we read recommendations of the type: Perform
japa N times, and offer into fire N/10 times. This seems to suggest
before offering an action to Ishvara, practice it 10X more. Any insights
that others may have on this topic?
I too searched on this topic for authority & reference, found interesting information in the following links.https://www.sivanandaonline.org//?cmd=displaysectionÂ§ion_id=525

https://adhyatmikta.com/analysing-validity-of-only-homa-as-a-method-of-sadhana-1/

Offering oblations to the fire is the direct reaching of the god/godess or its power/mantra shakti which is inbibed in those syllables which are not just alphbets. Strict rools have to be followed without any exemptions during the homa purascharana activites. ONLY homa wihtout Japa is against the shsatra rules and that is why sadhana dharma is sanatana & eternal. All acharya/rishis/saints who has given the method of sadhana are all based on the guidlines of the shastras.One shouldn't violate the guideline of the diety worshipping.

 Namaste,


Sharing some thoughts on the topic of yajna, homa ... based on my
understanding of these topics:

- Yajna is a symbolic/ abstracted version of how karma / actions
 are to be executed with perfection in our daily lives.
- If one is able to study a yajna manual and understand the symbolic
 language in it, it can become a practical, well researched, ancient manual
 on how to execute actions with perfection - this is the yajna vidyA that gItA
 talks about.
- The actual yajna/ homa ritual can also be occasionally performed to
 help indirectly infuse the principles of perfecting action in our
 lives. These are the supporting rituals of yajna vidyA.
