The comparison is beautiful.  The trait of the supreme bhakta is that he
has risen above body-identification.  Shankaracharya says in the Bh.Gita
bhashya that such a one will not be perturbed even if the bare minimum
required for the maintenance of the body is not obtained.  The Upanishad
says: Abhayam vai Janaka praaptosi' = Janaka, you have attained
fearlessness.
