The cited Bhamati passage could be reflecting the Taittiriya passage ' यो
वेद निहितं गुहायां परमे व्योमन् ' which itself says 'he who realises -
sakshatkara - that Brahman available in the cave of the intellect, buddhi
guhaa.' So the Consciousness reflected in the intellect is the vishaya for
that avidya nivartaka vritti. In the ' आत्मा वा अरे द्रष्टव्यः..' the
bhashyam says ' दर्शनविषयमापादयितव्य:'.
