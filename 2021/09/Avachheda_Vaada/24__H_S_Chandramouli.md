Namaste.

Reg  << The cited Bhamati passage could be reflecting the Taittiriya
passage ' यो वेद निहितं गुहायां परमे व्योमन् ' which itself says 'he who
realises - sakshatkara - that Brahman available in the cave of the
intellect, buddhi guhaa.' So the Consciousness reflected in the intellect
is the vishaya for that avidya nivartaka vritti. In the ' आत्मा वा अरे
द्रष्टव्यः..' the bhashyam says ' दर्शनविषयमापादयितव्य:'. >>,

Further to my earlier post on the subject, it may also be pointed out that
** Consciousness reflected in the intellect **  represents jIvAtma and
hence is not the ** vishaya for that avidya nivartaka vritti **. All
sAdhanAs are aimed at transcending this **Consciousness reflected in the
intellect** to Realize the ParamAtma.

My understanding.

Chandramouli
