Thank you Venkat ji for such a detailed and painstaking explanation.

It looks like this statement of the Kalpataru //न ब्रह्मसाक्षात्कारस्य
ब्रह्मविषयप्रयुक्तं चैतन्यप्रतिबिम्बितत्वं, किं तु स्वतः, घटादिवृत्तिष्वपि
साम्यात् - The reflection of consciousness (in the vRtti) during brahma
sAkshAtkAra is not a result of Brahman being the object of the vRtti,
rather it is natural, like in the case of the vRtti-s of pots etc too.
चैतन्यं च ब्रह्मेति स्वाभाविको वृत्तेस्तत्सम्बन्ध इत्यर्थः
The intended meaning is that consciousness, being Brahman, the association
of it with vRtti-s is intrinsic / natural.//

is a restatement of the Panchadashi concept of Vrttivyapti and phalavyapti.
While both ghata perception and Brahman perception require the chit
pratibimbita vritti to reveal the object, the ghata jnanam requires phala
vyapti too to illuminate the ghata which is not svaprakasha being jada, the
Brahma sakshatkara does not require the chit illumination separately as
Brahman is svaprakasha. Hence kevala chit pratibimbita vritti is sufficient.

If this understanding is correct, then the Vivarana concept could be seen
to be admissible to the Bhamati prasthana, being avirodha.
