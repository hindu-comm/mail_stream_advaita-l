Dear Advatins,
Please help me get some clarity about this particular view of the ChitChhaya aikyam with Buddhi.
I am trying to search through the archives for discussions on the subject but I forgot how to perform that search.
I would appreciate if someone could point me to links and also instruction on the search.
Thank you for you kindness.
Soma
