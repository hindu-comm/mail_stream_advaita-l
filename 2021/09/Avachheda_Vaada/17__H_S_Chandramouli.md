Namaste.

The cited quote from Bhamati reflects, I think, what all the commentators
agree upon. That is, that Sakshatkara is by way of Brahman “revealing”
itself in Vritti and that can only be through pratibimba, vritti being of a
lower order of Reality.  However that, in my understanding, does not mean
Bhamati supports Pratibimba vAda in which the Pratibimba plays a major role
in explaining various aspects of Sidhanta. Such is not the case with
Bhamati .  I am not suggesting that you seem to imply that. Only clarifying
my understanding.
