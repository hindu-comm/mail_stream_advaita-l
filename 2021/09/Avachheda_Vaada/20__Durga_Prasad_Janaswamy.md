Hari Om,
Namaste.
Siddhanta Bindu  By Swami Madhusudana Saraswati
Topic: Harmony of Jiva and Isvara
The view of the revered Vachaspati Misra (Theory of Limitation):

(English Translation by P.M.Modi)
Consciousness which is the object of ignorance is Isvara and the same which
is the residence of the Ignorance is Jiva (as is evident in the cognition
'I donot know Atman'). In this view Ignorances are many, therefore the
Jivas are many, and each Jiva has his own world. The fact that Jiva has for
his adjunct his own Ignorance makes him the essential cause of the world;
yet that an object in the world is recognised as the same by all Jivas is
due to the fact that the worlds of all the Jivas are similar. Some Sruti
texts say that 'Isvara is the cause of the world; because Isvara may be
secondarily called the cause of the world as He is the substratum of the
Ignorance of the Jiva together with the world.' This same view is called
the 'Theory of Limitation'.
