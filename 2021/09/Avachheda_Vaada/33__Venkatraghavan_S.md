How is the proposition - that the reflection of consciousness in the vRtti
is the subject of the cognition - derived from the above quotation ?  That
sentence says that Brahman is an object of the vRtti. What is the basis
there to conclude that the reflection of consciousness in the vRtti is the
subject?

That appears to me to be a fundamental difference between the Bhamati and

I had posted a quote from the kalpataru, a commentary of the bhAmati, न
ब्रह्मसाक्षात्कारस्य ब्रह्मविषयप्रयुक्तं चैतन्यप्रतिबिम्बितत्वं, किं तु
स्वतः, घटादिवृत्तिष्वपि साम्यात् - where it is said that the reflection of
consciousness is admitted in the cognition of pots too. Is your view that
the kalpatarukAra's position is different to the bhAmati in this regard?

Regards,
Venkatraghavan
