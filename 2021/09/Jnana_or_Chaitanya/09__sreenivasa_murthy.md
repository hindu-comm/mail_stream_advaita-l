Dear mumumkshus,

The jnani(name and form) appears in chaitanya or Jnana.The ajnAni (name and form) appears in chaitanya or Jnana.
So there is neither jnani nor ajnani.There is only jnana or Pure Consciousness/Atman/Brahman
It is very very important to cognize this fact within oneself by oneself.
With respectful namaskars,Sreenivasa Murthy
