In Karnataka ( especially in Bengaluru) we chant two types of mahAnyAsa, one is rAvaNokta another is bOdhAyanOkta.  bOdhAyanOkta you can find in rudrAbhishaktamaH published by Sringeri.  rAvaNokta you can find in RK publication.  rAvaNokta is bit elaborated with saMputikaraNa of namaH shabhavecha mantra for the shOdashAnga raudreekaraNa etc. and dhyAna shloka-s also have been included.  Shivasankalpa hrudayaM also has some pAta bheda in these two versions.  Normally in rudraikaadashani we chant rAvaNokta mahAnyAsam only.  Challakere brothers chanted rAvaNokta which is available in CDs.  FYI.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!

Dear members,

Can any of you point me to a pdf or printed version of the mahAnyAsam in *devanAgarI *as chanted in the Telugu/Kannada speaking regions ? I have the the version as practiced in tamilnadu (possibly the same as the kerala version); this is the one published by rAmakrishna math in devanAgari as well as tamil scripts (collected by shrI "Anna" subrahmanian) - however this version seems to vary quite a bit from the mahAnyAsam book in kannada script published by the same R.K. math.

Regards,
Shyam
