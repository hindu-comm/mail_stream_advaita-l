The Gita Press of Gorakhapura published a book of subhashitas on various 
deities called Sukti Sudhakara. This shloka is mentioned on page 27 and 
ascribed to Ramanarayanadatta Shastri Pandey who worked  for the 
press.  (I recognized the name from my copy of Laghusiddhantakaumudi which 
he edited.)
