Man must progress in life through good education and firm
adherence to the Dharmic (righteous) path. All ordained duties
must be performed well. Parents and elders must be treated
with respect and affection. One must also make good use of
available time to gradually progress on the spiritual path.

However, at times, we may encounter challenges that must be
overcome and the mind may get confused about the means to
resolve the same. During such times, people will offer varied
advices. A course of action that is acceptable to one might not
be acceptable to another. In such cases, man must resolve the
problem and move forward only by seeking the guidance of his
Guru, for the Guru alone possesses true wisdom. 

It is impossible to pay heed to every person's suggestions and
please everyone. In the name of advice, people will keep saying
something or the other. Therefore, in such circumstances, in
order that there is no transgression of Dharma and to ensure
our welfare, one must understand the right course from the
Guru and abide by it to overcome all difficulties.

May everyone understand this well and progress in life. Our
blessings to all.
