Namaste.

Reg  <<  "पञ्चापाद्यां तु
रूढिरुक्ता, तां दूषयति - येत्विति | >>,

Is it not possible to understand from above cited portion that Kalpataru is
merely stating that the position taken by Panchapadika (could be elsewhere
in BSB) is in accordance with rUdhi (meaning thereby that it is the
conclusion of kalpataru), and not necessarily that Panchapadika has stated
in this portion of BSB that the rUdhi meaning of akAsha is Brahman. It may
be pointed out that elsewhere in Panchapadika, this meaning is taken for
AkAsha (without mentioning rUdhi). One example is cited below

<< तदुच्यते — येयं श्रुतिस्मृतीतिहासपुराणेषु नामरूपम् , अव्याकृतम् ,
अविद्या, माया, प्रकृतिः, अग्रहणम् , अव्यक्तं, तमः, कारणं, लयः, शक्तिः,
महासुप्तिः, निद्रा, अक्षरम् , आकाशम् इति च तत्र तत्र बहुधा गीयते >>.

In fact Sri MDS also appears to allow for such a possibility in response to
a question from one of the participants at  3.20  to 3.50 in the above talk.

Chandramouli
