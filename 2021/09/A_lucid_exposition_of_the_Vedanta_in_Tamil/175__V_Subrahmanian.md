This is a lucid exposition of the Vedanta by a non-professional scholar in
Tamil. It is worth listening and sharing.  The speaker, Sri Giridharan,
though in the worldly profession, has been studying the Vedanta and other
Shastras from eminent scholars.  Sri Mani Dravid Sastrigal introduces the
speaker.
