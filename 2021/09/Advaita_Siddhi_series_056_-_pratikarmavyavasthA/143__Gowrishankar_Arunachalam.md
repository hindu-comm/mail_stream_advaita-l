There was a discussion regarding perception a few months ago, and several
of the comments made therein made references to the methodology to explain
perception and other indirect cognitions in advaita vedAnta. That
methodology is outlined in some detail in this chapter of the advaita
siddhi.

Regards,
Venkatraghavan
