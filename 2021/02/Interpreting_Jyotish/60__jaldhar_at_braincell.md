As jyotisha has a Vedic basis and is a mainstream part of Smarta Hinduism 
it is fair to say that all acharyas and vidvans of the past have accepted 
it.

Yes all these things can have positive and negative effects.  And the 
remedies for the same offered in the shastras have effects on those.  But 
the problem from the Advaita perspective is that karma is in infinite 
regress.  Some misfortune may have happened because of ones previous karma 
but that in turn may have been the result of some previous karma and so 
on.  At no point can you say *this* is the cause.  Ultimately the only way 
to avoid the sukha and duhkha of samsara is to renounce karma altogether. 
This is why sannyasa is the requirement for mukti.

As for free will, technically you do not have it because "you" are by 
definition nothing more than the effects of prior karma.  But again, 
because karma is infinite in scope, you can never account for it 
completely so in practice you are free to act as you wish.
