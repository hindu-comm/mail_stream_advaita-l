Otherthan the 'experience of existence of the self' as pure consciousness, rest all the sectors of 'knowledge' are 'aparA'. For that matter, even vEdAs are also declared as aparA. Accordingly as per advaita vEdAnta, the jyotishya vidyA also is a form of That Substance. As a Substance, it is true and as a form it is mithya.
