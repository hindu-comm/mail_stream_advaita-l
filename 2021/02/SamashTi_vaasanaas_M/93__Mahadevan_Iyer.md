Pranams,

SamashTi vaasanaas of all beings become the maaya shakti. This maaya shakti
manifests jeeva who inturn creates SamashTi vaasanaas.

Vasana ( due to Avidya ) & Maaya seems paradoxical.

"prakruti is anaadi" says Shree Krishna in Bhagavat Gita, Hence there is no
inception point for either Vasana or Maaya.

Yet it appears to exist.

Explanation: Maaya due to Avidya & Avidya due to Maaya.

Since Brahman is the only Satyam. Is there a better explanation for the
question...

How ( or Why ) did the Non-dual whole appeared as the sum of its parts?
