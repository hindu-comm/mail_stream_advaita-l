 Dear Sri Anandan,
Are you a jiva first of all?Have you enquired into this most important question concerning you?Please do not take this lightly.
Please ponder over.
With warm respects,Sreenivasa Murthy

 Namaste,

I have some follow up questions here:
Are Devatas, Devas also considered Jivas? If yes, Is Hiranyagarbha also
including Devas, Devatas etc?

If Ishwara is Brahma Sahita Maya,
What is the difference between Ishwara and Hiranyagarbha?

Also what is the difference between Purusha and Ishwara?

Om Namo Narayanaya,
Anand
