In Vedanta, the Samashti jiva is Hiranyagarbha who is said to have
'abhimana', identification, with 'all' individual jivas' sukshma shariram,
manas.  Virat is the same samashti jiva who has identification with the
sthula shariram of all jivas.  This way, you have a means to explain how
the sum total of individual avidyas can be seen as Maya vishishta Samashti
jiva/Ishwara.
