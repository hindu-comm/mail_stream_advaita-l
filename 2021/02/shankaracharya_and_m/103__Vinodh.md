Thank you for your response, Sri Manas Bharadwaaj.

To add to what you mentioned, Sri Chandrasekharendra Saraswathi has said
that the most important of all in one’s quest for truth is one’s shraddha
(faith) and bhakthi (devotion) towards one’s guru, whoever that may be,
regardless of whether that guru has an advaitic, dvaitic or visishtadvaitic
leaning. Even if that guru himself is not a jnani, Ishwara, i.e., the
saguna-brahmam, acting through that guru will show the sishya with
shraddha-bhakti the right way and finally make him realize
brahma-sakshatkaaram (experience of brahmam).

Namaskaram 🙏
Vinodh
