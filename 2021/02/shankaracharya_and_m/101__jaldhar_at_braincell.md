There is also a matha said to be founded by Gaudapadacharya in Goa.

There is a big controversy about Kanchi.  Was it founded by Shankaracharya 
or was it a branch of Shringeri that broke away?

Personally I do not think it was based on the evidence as I've reviewed 
it but there are respectable people who believe otherwise.  And in any 
case its' acharyas have shown themselves to be exemplars of of Vedic 
dharma and worthy of respect by anyone who claims to be a follower of the 
same.

But this raises the question, by authentic do you mean historically 
authentic or doctrinally authentic?
