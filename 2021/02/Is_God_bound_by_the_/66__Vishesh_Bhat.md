Pranam,

Nirguna Brahman is precisely that which is unaffected by Karma. However,
for an Avatar of Saguna Brahman, the "Sharira" is affected by the same laws
of Karma as other Jivas, but these are enlightened beings so the way Karma
affects them is quite different. This is evidenced by the lives of Sri
Krishna and Rama. Here too there might be some subtleties. I presume some
one like Narasimha would be unaffected by Karma when compared to Krishna or
Sri Rama. Maybe more knowledgeable people on this forum will have something
more to add.

Namaskara,
Vishesh
