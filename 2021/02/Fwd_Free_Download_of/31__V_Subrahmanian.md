Writes the Uploader, of the efforts:

The Skanda Purana is a huge compilation of ancient Hindu scriptures
<https://holybooks.com/mahabharata-all-volumes-in-12-pdf-files/>. They were
discovered in a library in Kathmandu, Nepal, in 1898 by Haraprasad Shastri
and Cecil Bendall. The manuscripts were written on palm leafs, the oldest
one dated to 810 CE. However, earlier versions are likely to have existed.
Parts of the text have also been found in Tamil Nadu and other parts of
India, indicating that the Skanda Purana has been an important and
widespread corpus of texts. The complete Skanda Purana covers many topics.
Parts of it describes pilgrim routes and serves as travel guides for monks
to important temples and monasteries all over India. Other parts are more
devotional and discusses theology, dharma and the absolute. The mythology
also takes up large parts of the book,  the name Skanda Purana refers to
the war God Skanda (Kartikeya <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kartikeya>)
son of Shiva.

The Skanda Purana consists of 20 books, here they are in the English
translation. This version is the first edition of the English translation
published in India in 1950. I have  removed blank pages from the scanned
books to make the file size smaller and punished my CPU for 14 hours by
running OCR. This means that you can do research by text search in the
books now with Adobe PDF reader, copy and paste to other formats etc.
