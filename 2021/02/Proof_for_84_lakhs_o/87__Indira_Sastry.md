Namasthe Sarvebhya:
I am just copying someone's reply here:
My question is: we all quote that to get human birth we go through 84 lakhs
of janma in different yonis. What is the proof for this? I know Kanakadasa
has written that in a song. I am not looking for answers like in a song. I
am looking for the authentic proof. The knowledgeable people in the group
could throw light on this please.
Thanks a lot.
Dhanyavada:
Indira Sastry
