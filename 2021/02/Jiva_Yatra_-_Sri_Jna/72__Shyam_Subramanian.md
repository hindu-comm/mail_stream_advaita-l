Namaste,

Thank you Divya ji and Sridhar ji for the information. I hadn't seen this
amongst shrI jnAnAnanda bhAratI swAmigaL's  works at
http://www.gnananandabharathi.org/sanskritbooks.html and hence asked. I
guess it is because the work is of 9 verses only (as Sridhar ji mentioned)
and hence probably included in his other works.

dhanyavAdaH,
Shyam
