A few years ago two high ranking officials of the Madhya Pradesh Govt. had
visited Sringeri on the concluding day of the annual Mahaganapati Vakyartha
Vidwat Sadas. Speaking at the occasion they said: We have taken up a number
of programs to propagate the message of Adi Shankaracharya. We are very
pleased by the way this Vidwat Sadas is conducted. We invite you to
organize this event in our place for which we extend all cooperation.
Now the Govt has decided to erect a 108 ft. statue of Shankaracharya at
Omkareshwar on the banks of river Narmada.
