To: <advaitin at googlegroups.com>



Apropos the recent discussion on Swami Vivekananda. Coincidentally Swami
Sarvapriyanandaji gave a talk on what Vivekananda stood for - Neo Advaita
or traditional Advaita ? Here is a brilliant analysis on his position which
many people fail to understand. Ramabachan and his ilk would do well to
hear patiently to understand Vivekananda patiently. This is one of the most
profound talks of Sarvapriyanandaji. - something not to be missed.
