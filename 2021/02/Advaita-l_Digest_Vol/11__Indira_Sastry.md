Namasthe Sarvebhyaha
I am looking for the stotra written by Sri Shivabhinava Narasimha Bharathi
Mahaswamigal of Sringeri on  Shankara Bhagavadpada called as Padavalamba
Suvarnamala stuti in sanskrit. I checked on the internet. I could only get
ashtakam on this. But I heard it is a stotra on Bhagavatpada Shankara with
more than 35 shlokas. Appreciate any help.
Pranams
Thanks

Indira Sastry
