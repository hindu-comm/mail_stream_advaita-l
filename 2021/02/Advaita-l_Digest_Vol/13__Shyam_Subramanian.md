Namaste,

The bhakti-sudhA-taraMginI available at
https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.311586/page/n225/mode/2up has
stotras named श्रीशङ्करार्यपदावलम्बस्तव: (37 shlokas) and
श्रीशङ्करार्यपदावलम्बसुवर्णमालास्तुति: (8 shlokas). I believe you are
looking for the former one.

dhanyosmi,
Shyam
