No one but Ishwara is deemed to know the ways of Karma. The Bh.gita says
'gahanaa karmaNo gatiH'.  Of the Sanchita karma, that part which is ready
to give fruit to the jiva, is said to have 'fructified', and thus the jiva
takes a new birth to expend/live out the fructified karma, called prarabdha
karma. So this is the criteria.

Yes, the jiva is unique, continues  through several lives, till finally it
gets mukti.

If so then initially there must be a fixed no of jivas. How is it possible?

Every jiva, in  samsara, experiences bodange. When it takes steps to come
out of bondage and succeeds, that jiva is said to have attained moksha.
