 Pls read inbetween:
My question is…

…in the next Life

Does the same Jiva A1 & A2 reincarnate?

If so, then A1 will have to inherit prarabdha “x” & A2 inherits prarabdha
“y”. This leads to a finite amount of Jivas. How can there be a finite
number of Jivas ?


Jivas are all living beings. There are 84 lac yonis and migration in between them is also possible.So it is not a simple linear relationship as you mention. Humans can take animal births and vice versa.There is no way logic can fathom that.


If not, then there is no specific identity traversal, hence while attaining
Moksha who is Liberated?

The jiva who attains moksha gets liberated.Normal rule is via human birth but there are instances and exceptions otherwise.


Since there is reincarnation,there must be a certain identity traversal
between lives. Since face, colour, region, etc are different, we consider
that the “karmas” as the determining factor. But if

“By definition, a jiva is the bundle of karma and its effects that persists
from life to life.”

What determines this bundle.

The present karma (kriyamana karma) determines the future bundle.

Of course, we could believe that these karma phalams are determined by
ISWARA and hence ISWARA is kartha, it is not deterministic. But, is there
any other alternatives to tackle this?


Ishwara is not a karta. There is no kartritwa bhavana or else he can be termed partial.It is the law of karma that functions meticulously under him.
Is Advaita purely based on faith ?
Without faith nothing is possible. It keeps you going on this life journey.As one progresses he can see milestones going as mentioned in shashtras .When knowledge fails, faith takes over.

 Pranams,

Thank you for the replies & recommendations.

I would clarify the question.

I understand that vyavaharika ( transactional ) level is mithya.

In Advaita, it is postulated that apparently, the life situations of a
particular Jiva is due to his respective prior life karmas.

So if we suppose,

…in the current Life

A Jiva “A1” doing karma “k1” yields punyam “x” & dies. [ A1:k1 -> x ]

Another Jiva “B1” doing karma “k2” yields paapam “y” & dies. [ B1:k2 -> y ]

Hence Sanchita Karma is the set [ ……..x,y,…….. ]

My question is…

…in the next Life

Does the same Jiva A1 & A2 reincarnate?

“y”. This leads to a finite amount of Jivas. How can there be a finite
