Few months (or a year) back, there was question in dvaita list on
the authorship of giita dhyaana shloka-s which are normally
recited by smaarta-s. (paarthaaya pratibodhitaam ...).

I think, it is not by shankara as his commentary does not include
them. I have a vague recollection reading somewhere that it is by
madhava vidyaaraNya (or madhuna saraswati?).

Who authored those verses? Can someone shed more light on
this question? Thank you for your help.
