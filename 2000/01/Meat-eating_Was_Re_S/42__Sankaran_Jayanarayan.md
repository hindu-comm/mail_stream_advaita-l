How would you interpret the final shloka on the subject in Manu 5.56:
"There is no fault in meat-eating...but abstinence bears great fruit."

This cannot refer to consecrated meat: for "abstinence bears great fruit"
does not make sense in the light of 5.35.

Nor can it refer to unconsecrated meat: "There is no fault" wouldn't make
sense considering 5.52.

I'm only asking because this verse being the conclusion seemed out of
place, considering Manu delineates what meat ought to be eaten and what
avoided.
