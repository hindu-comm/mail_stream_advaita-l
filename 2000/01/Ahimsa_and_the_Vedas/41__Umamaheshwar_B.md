Hello

In pursuance to the discussion on Ahimsa, I have one question.  Please
ignore this if it has already been discussed -- I will try to trace the
answer in the archives.  My question is:

We may appreciate the influence of Jainism on the rise of Ahimsa as an
important tenet.  But even otherwise, vegetarian food falls under Sattvic
category, while Meat comes under Rajasic food.  In that case how is it that
a Brahmin was permitted to eat meat? (I mean in earlier times)

Regards

Umamaheshwar B.
