When the stage is reached for sannyAsa, yes. The catch with the nitya and
naimittika karmas is that they are not binding upon him who has realized
fully that he is not a doer. Indeed, nishkAmya karma is only prescribed for
him who does not yet have that realization. This involves performing one's
karma, dedicating it to God. That the fruits will still adhere to the doer
should be no cause for concern. The discipline of karma yoga will provide
the equanimity to take the good results with the bad, to reach the stage
that is called samadRshTi. Once that maturity of mind is reached, the
person has one of the qualifications for sannyAsa, involving a total
renunciation of works.
