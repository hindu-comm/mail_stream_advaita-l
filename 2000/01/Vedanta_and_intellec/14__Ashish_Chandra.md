>From BU:

"He said: it is not, indeed, for the husband's sake (kamaya) that the
husband is dear, but for the sake of the self that the husband is dear
....." {IV.5.6}

"The self, indeed, Maitreyi, is to be seen, heard, reflected on, meditated
on, and when the self is indeed seen, heard, reflected on and known, then
all this is known."

Exactly what this odd passage means is perhaps made a little clearer in what
Yajnavalkya says next:

"Brahminhood deserts the one who knows Brahminhood in anything other than
the self ...... the worlds desert the one who knows the worlds as anything
other than the self .... This Brahminhood, this Ksatriyahood, all these
worlds, these gods, these Vedas, all these beings, this all, are the self."

Seems to me that the personality which is the sum total of past and present
experiences cannot be the self described as the self by Yajnavalkya because
personality will change (as there are sure to be future personalities if
Moksha is not attained).

Could you please clarify.

Thanks
ashish
