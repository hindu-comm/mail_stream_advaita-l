The BaudhAyana dharma suutra classes the sin of voyaging across the seas
among those like the stealing of a BrAhmaNa's property and giving false
evidence. These are not minor transgresses of dharma, and require
immediate expiation. Granted, there may be exceptions to this rule, but
the rule can be broken only under VERY special circumstances.
The VishhNu PurANa extols the greatness of BhArata varshha (India) as the
"Karma Bhuumi" -- the land of works where the great YaGYas are performed,
and says that the rest of the world is to be looked upon as "Bhoga Bhuumi"
(lands of enjoyment). There is absolutely no doubt that VarNAshrama dharma
practised outside India can in no way equal the same practised within
India.

We cannot be sure what the particular reason for the BrAhmaNas who were
willing to travel to the west was. It cannot be merely for the sake of
performing this homa if it could very well have been performed in India
itself. If the necessary conditions for this homa were to exist in India,
crossing the sea is impermissible, for the shAstras are against this
practice. There must have been something else which prompted the BrAhmaNas
to make such a decision.

It is also a matter of historical fact that BrAhmaNas were NOT permitted
to cross the sea before the last century (I mean before 1900, now that
we're in the 21st century). Even if they did, a penance or rite was
demanded of them if they wished to regain their caste. An example is
Ramanujan, the famous mathematician, who on returning to India after his
visit to England, was asked to perform the necessary rites in order to
regain his BrAhmaNa-hood. You can hardly attribute greed to him for having
travelled to England. Giri has narrated a similar experience.

But one who, although perfectly capable of leading a dhArmic life in
India, decides to settle down in the West (for no special reason) and yet
lays claim to BrAhmaNatva is only fooling himself. This is NOT permissible
-- even by the most liberal interpretation of the shAstras.

Exactly. There are several so-called Brahmins who stay in the USA for
the sake of leading a comfortable life, though they may be engaged in
religious activities like homas and pUjas. It is this class that may have
lost the right to be a BrAhmaNa.
