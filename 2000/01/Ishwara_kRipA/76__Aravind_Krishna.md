Namaste,
I would be extremely grateful if the list members can answer my ignorant
question.

. What is Shankaras stand on Ishwara kR^ipA.

   Does he deny that Ishwara has the capability to release a jIvan
   from samsaara?

   (Does the popular advaitic definition of Ishwara (assuming he is
    saguNa brahma) mAyA sahitam brahma have any shruti basis.)

    Ishwara kR^ipA my not be needed for a negation approach.
    But that doesnt mean it is the only approach for mukti.

Though this topic has been dealt in SaguNa nirguNa, krama mukti and other
threads I request a more Vedic explanation for this.

Thanks
Aravind
