Sanskrit is taught at the University of Pennsylvania (By Prof. George
Cardona I believe.) Their website is http://www.upenn.edu . No doubt their
library has manuscripts.  However I doubt very much if the palm-leaf
manuscripts date back to Shankaracharya time.  They have one fatal flaw
over paper--ants find palm leaves delicious.  Plus Pandits prefer to
memorize rather than rely on written words.  As a consequence most
manuscripts are actually fairly recent in vintage.
