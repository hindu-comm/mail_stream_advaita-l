Subject: Palm leaf manuscripts


Respected Sir/Madam, I am interested in Sankaracharya's works of
Soundaryalahari. I came to know that these slokas are written in palmleaves and
preserved in  one of the library/museum in Philadelphia. Would you please  help
me in locating the palm leaf manuscript , as where can I see them ? I would be
much obliged if you can help me in this regard. Thanking you , Sincerely yours,
Shankari Rangarajan.

WITH LOVE,  SHANKARI RANGARAJAN
