Greetings Advaitins,

A friend of mine is going to India, mostly northern India, over the next
few months.  He'll be going to New Delhi, Rishikesh, Varanasi, Bodh Ghaya,
and Lucknow.

Can anyone recommend any advaita teachers or scholars or others whom he
would be able to visit?  Whether individual teachers or part of an
organization, he is interested in any of these opportunities.

Thank you for any leads.  You can reply to this list, to me
(goode at dpw.com), but preferably, directly to Robert Hirschfield at
(cmrh at cairn.org).

OM!!

--Greg Goode
