And what if one is engaged in activities that are contrary (hence
prohibited) for one's Varna ? eg, a Brahmana in the army, an accountant
Kshatriya, a Brahmana farmer ?

I was reading about Darbhanga Raj yesterday. It was basically a kingdom
established in Bihar wherein the local Kshatriya ruler was deposed by an
Aghan and replaced with a Brahmin. It ended with Independence in 1947 and
was run by Maithil Brahmin kings. There are also instances of Brahmin kings
in Maharashtra (Peshwas) and in Sindh. Considereing that varnaashrama dharma
is not adhered to these days, what could it have been that compelled
Brahmins to become kings when the majority of the population followed the
Smritis strictly? The reason why I bring this up is because I thought that
the deviation from varnaashrama dharma is fairly recent, which is ofcourse
not entirely true.
