 The gItA also has the verse 3.35, "shreyAn.h svadharmo viguNaH para-
 dharmAt.h svanushhThitAt.h ..." (also 18.47). Even if one performs
 one's own dharma without proper completion of all the components
 of the relevant karmas, it is still better than the dharma of another
 which is performed well. The gist is it is better to perform the
 varNa-Ashrama duties to the best of one's ability rather than giving
 them up completely.
