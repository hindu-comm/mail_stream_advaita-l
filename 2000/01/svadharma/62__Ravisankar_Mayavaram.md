Thanks Anand. Gita indeed has answers to most perplexing questions in
life.

I request you eloborate on what advaita-vedanta's view on sharaNagati,
which krishna  emphasizes in giita.  In a telephone conversation with
Aravind Krishna (who is on this list) he told me that shankara does
bring it out in his stotra-s like (laxmi nR^isimha mama dehi
karaavalambam). When one calls out with devotion to God asking him to
lift him up (from the ocean of saMsara), isn't a beautiful way of
surrender to the Lord.

smR^itau shaastre vaidye shakuna kavitaa gaana phaNitau

shivaanandalaharii


O pashupati, I do not know the canons of law (smriti) or the
scriptures (shaastraas), I do not know the art of healing (vaidya) or
foretelling based on omens (shakuna), neither do I know to compose
poetry (kavita), or to sing (gaana), nor I am well versed in
grammar(phaNita). I have not learnt the ancient puraaNa-s, I am not an
authority on mantra shaastra, and I do not have skills in praising
(stuti), or dance (naTana) or in comedy (haasya). In all these skills
I have no mastery (achaturaH). If this is the case how I can please
the king or other wordly powers which can give wealth and protect
here. I am an ignorant being (pashu) and Lord you are all knowing
(sarva~njya), and you are well known for your compassion. O all
knowing one, please protect me.

Even if one is unfit for the wordly success etc., one is always to fit
to worship the Lord. If one seeks the kingdom of God, everything else
that is necessary to live peacefully here will be automatically added
on to the devotee. In God lies the answer to every question we seek
and the ultimate joy which we desire for.

Ravi
