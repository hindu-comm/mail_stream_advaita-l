According to our calendar, we are into the 51st year of Brahma, this is the
7th manavantara (Vaivasvata Manu). Is the Manu of Manu Smriti the same as
Vaivasvata Manu or is it different ?

How are Srautas different from Smaartas ?

What is the Dharmasutra for the Madhyandina Shakha of Sukla Yajur Veda ?

What are (or were) some of the Vedas (and corresponding Shakhas and
Dharmasutras) prevalent in most parts of North India (West UP, Punjab,
Haryana, Delhi) ?

thanks
ashish
