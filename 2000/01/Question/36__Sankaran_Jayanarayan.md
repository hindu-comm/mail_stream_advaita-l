Also BaudhAyana. Like me for instance :-)

This is a rare dharma shAstra with not many followers. Most KrishNa yajur
Vedi south-Indians that I've met are with the Apastamba school. Georg
Buhler says that Apastamba came after BaudhAyana and disagreed with his
predecessor on many important issues. e.g. he made the rules of caste much
stricter: the carpenter (RathakAra) is a dvija according to B, but not A.
B is also more liberal in giving expiations for offences like drinking
liquor, which can be expiated only by death by most others.
