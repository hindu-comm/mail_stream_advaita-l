Meditate, O my mind, on the Lord Hari,
The stainless One, Pure spirit through and through.
How peerless is the Light that in Him shines !
How soul-bewitching is His wondrous form !
How dear is He to all His devotees !
Ever more beauteous in fresh blossoming love
That shames the splendour of a million moons
Like lightning gleams the glory of His form
Raising erect the hair for very joy
Worship his feet in the lotus of your heart
with mind serene and eyes made radiant
with heavenly love, behold that matchless sight.
Caught in the spell of His love's ecstasy,
Immerse yourself for evermore, O mind
In Him who is pure knowledge and pure bliss.

Swami Vivekananda
