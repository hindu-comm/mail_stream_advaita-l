In a radiant golden bed room, on a cot set with rubies and covered on
all sides with sweet smelling flowers, Thou art seated with the
effulgence of thousand suns! Thou art the answer to every desire of
the heart and Thou fulfils the righteous desires of Thy devotees! Thou
art the lord of devas and son of the lord of the universe! O
Kartikeyaa I meditate on Thee!

Let the mind (like a bee) which is burdened with domestic troubles
become happy by hovering around Thy lotus feet which is adorned with
the jingling ringlets made of rings and beads, red in color indicating
the grace, filled with the nectar of beauty and attracts the minds of
the devotees.

English Translation*
===================

The meaning (arthaH)  of the name kakaararuupaa is the letter
(varNa)  "ka" reveals or causes the knowledge (j~naapaka
visheshanam) of HER (yasyaaH), that is (saa), in the image
(vigrahaH) of kaadi-vidya.  Here the term kaadi-vidya refers to
the reading of pancha-dashaakShari mantra. There are different
readings of this mantra and here the mantra beginning with "ka"
is referred to.

The word kakaararuupa, referring to the letter "ka" can also mean
hiraNyagarbha, water (udakam), head (uttamaa~Ngam) and happiness
(sukha). The powers of hiraNyagarbha such as creation of the
cosmos (jagat kartR^itvam) and supporting it (jagat.h dhaaraka)
is attributed the "ka" the first (aadima) letter of the
consonants (vyanjana). The power of water (udaka) in creating
food (anna) and through that sustaining the world (jagat
sanjiivana hetitvam) is attributed to the first letter of the
mantra "ka".

It is well known (prasiddham) in yoga shaastra that for all
living beings (sarveShaaM praaNinaaM) there is nectar (amR^itam)
in head (shirasya - in sahasrara) and through yogic practice
(yoga maargane) when kuNDalini is aroused and lead to the
sahasrara and all the naaDi's are immersed (apluta) in the flow
of nectar, the yogin attain communion with the iishwara (yoginaaM
iishvara saamyaM jayata). Similarly, on those who (yaH) meditate
on the mantra beginning with "ka" (kaadi-vidya -
panchadashaakSharii) SHE confers (chadi iti) shivahood (shiva
bhavam). Hence SHE is known as kakaara ruupa.

Shruti declares that "kaM brahma khaM brahma". The space in the
heart daharaakaasham is brahman and the bliss of that brahman is
desired and sought by all. Similary as "ka" which is the first
letter of the muulamantra (which in a sense represents the whole
mantra) which represents HER, the source of highest bliss, SHE
is revered (arhita) by all.  That is for those who meditate on
it, it reveals HER as brahman bestowing them the supreme bliss.
Hence SHE is known as kakaara ruupa.

AUM kakaararuupaayai namaH

errors. Your corrections and suggestions are welcome. I use
Chaganti Suryanarayamurthy's work as reference. But I do not
follow it verbatim and the book does not have the original in
sanskrit. The way I translate it (or understand) it is read
the original 10-15 times and contemplate on it with sanskrit
dictionaries on the internet and try to undestand better. Please
do forgive me for errors and kindly point them out. I going
through this whole exercise just to understand the text better.
