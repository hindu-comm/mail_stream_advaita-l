Hello all :

    I have a couple of questions on scriptural authority.

1) Is it wrong to interpret Shruti "rationally"?
   I am under the impression that only in matters regarding Moksha
   and jnAna should Shruti be accepted without doubt, as this
   knowledge is supra-sensory.  In all other matters, Shruti should
   be understood in conjunction with Smriti and one's reasoning.
   Is this correct?

2) Can one portion of Shruti supersede another portion?
   Specifically, does the jnAna kANDa supersede the karma kANDa?
   I have always wondered why VedAnta places a greater emphasis on
   the former.  If the teachings of VedAnta follow from "all" of
   the vedas, why is it called "VedAnta" and not "VaidhIka"?

-Vivek Aanand Ganesan
