Sankaran Jayanarayanan kartik at ECE.UTEXAS.EDU asked, referring to my
original post, which shloka was being commented on.

The discourses follow II. 21. The section from which I specifically quoted
is called "Knowledge of the Immutable Self is possible" There is an
'Objection', then an 'Answer' followed by an 'Opponent' and another
'Answer'. It is this second interchange to which I referred. The 'Opponent'
says "Because the Self is inaccessible to any of the senses". Sha~Nkara's
reply begins: - "Not so. For, the Scripture says 'It can be seen by the
mind alone.'" etc. This is supposed to be a translation of the shloka from
the Br. U. but Kartik's translation has a somewhat different emphasis.
Saying that the mind does not see any multiplicity is certainly similar to
saying that it sees the Self but not quite (is it?). What does the previous
shloka say? i.e. what is the here (iha) that is being referred to?

The previous shloka reads: -

prANasya prANam.h uta cakshhushhash.h uta shrotrasya shrotram.h
manaso ye mano viduH, te nicikyur.h brahma purANam.h agryam.h

(Do you have the reference in 'Talks' for the Ramana discussions, Kartik? I
would be interested in looking this up - next month's discussions at the UK
Ramana Maharshi Foundation is on the topic of 'Mind and Heart'.)
