Namaste,

      The pure mind is nothing but the Atman.  Therefore in the absolute sense , the mind as we know it does not exist. What we call the mind is nothing but the result of our attachment with varies tendencies (vasanas). These tendencies being perishable in the long run , what remains is the pure mind which is the Atman.

Regards,
                Anand
