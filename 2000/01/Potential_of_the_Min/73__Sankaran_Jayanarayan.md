The translation of the GItA Bhaashhya that I have here gives Shankara's
quote from the Br.up. as, "by the mind alone is the Self to be perceived."

I'm sorry, but all I know is the meaning of some Sanskrit words and a few
"shabdas" (noun cases). I can only understand the rough meaning of a
sentence, not much more. IMO, manasA eva anudrashhTavyam.h ~ "It is only

"(It is) the breath's breath, and the eye's eye, and the ear's ear.

PrANaH : breath
chakshhuH : eye
shrotraH : ear
manaH : mind
viduH : know

I'm unable to decipher the rest :-(

I don't have the book with me now, but I can say for sure that it's in
there somewhere. It's the only place I've come across the equation
mind=Self.
