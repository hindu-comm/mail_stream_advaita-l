This verse is from Upadesa Saram of Sri Ramana Maharshi. In the commentary on it , I find the 8 fold form is mentioned as pancha bhutas + Sun + Moon + all living beings. So it seems to be similar to the shakthi rahasya that you mention.
The basic theme is  that it is Brahman alone that has become all and therfore the world and all it beings are nothing but Brahman and bearing this in mind we must act.

Sincerely,
                 Anand
