An action is preceded by the desire (kaama) which motivates the
action and it is followed by its fruits. The desire (kaama) (or
the motive) and the attachment (sanga) to the fruits lead to
bondage and rebirth. A true karma yoga would require abandoning
both the motive and the attachment. The action by itself is not
binding, it the desire that prompts the action which binds.
Hence, the karma yoga is characterized by nishhkaamatva and
nissa~Ngatva.

In this world, even a dullard will not act without motive. How is
it one can achieve nishhkaamatva?. Seeking Self-realization is
the only motive which a seeker can have. Otherwise, one can has
to perform the actions without desire or attachment, by viewing
life as a noble duty.

I request all the members to share their understanding on this
subject.

Thank you.

Sincerely,
Ravi

* Most of my understanding in this post is from a book called
"Introduction to bhagavad giita " by G. Prakash Rao.  Only few
copies of this book was printed and circulated. It is based on
shankara's bhaashhya.
