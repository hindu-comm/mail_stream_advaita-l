The kAnchi paramAchArya does not subscribe to this view. In his book
"Hindu dharma," he says more than once that shruti, smR^iti and puraNas
are all at the same level among the shabda pramANas.

Chapter on "shruti-smR^iti shrauta-smArta," p.503:
"It is not proper to think that the smR^itis are inferior to the Vedas or
that the purANas are inferior to the smR^itis. We must learn to take an
integrated view of all of them. In the purANa the Vedic truths are
illustrated in the form of stories. The smR^itis bring the Vedic dharmas
and karmas in the form of instruction and injunctions and tell us how the
rites are to be performed."

p.504:"We use the terms "shruti pramaaNa" and "smR^iti pramANa" (the
authority of the Vedas and the authority of the smR^itis), but making such
a distinction does not mean that we should treat shruti and smR^iti as
different or that we should think that the one is inferior to the other."

Again in the chapter on "Sacrifices," p.625:
"I told you, do you remember, that there was no question of shruti being
superior to smR^iti or vice versa?"
