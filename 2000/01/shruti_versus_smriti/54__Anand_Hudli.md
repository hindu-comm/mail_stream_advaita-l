 Perhaps, the ParamAchArya is being misinterpreted here. Can you show
 me where he says that it is OK to reconcile the shruti with a smR^iti
 when the latter  contradicts the former? The question of superiority
 of shruti only arises when there is some contradiction between
  the shruti and a non-shruti source. But that is not being discussed
 in the sayings of ParamAchArya that you have quoted above.

 Of course, on points of agreement between the shruti and other non-shruti
 sources such as smR^iti's and purANas, it becomes unnecessary to assert
 the superiority of the shruti.

 But still it is correct to say that the smR^itis and other non-shruti
 sources of dharma derive their strength precisely as long as they do
 NOT contradict shruti. In  cases where  they don't,  they have equal
 validity as the shruti. But in cases where they do contradict the
 shruti, we should ignore the directives of such non-shruti sources or
 perhaps interpret the *non-shruti* so as to be consistent with what
 the shruti is saying. The shruti cannot be *forced* or tortured to
 be consistent with the non-shruti.
