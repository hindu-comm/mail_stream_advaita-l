Instead of saying reconciliation, one may have to learn from the
supporting smriti-s on how to understand and interpret the shruti
correctly. The apparent contradiction between shruti and smriti may be
due to misinterpretation of shruti statements. That is the reason why
Acharya says an integrated approach is required.

Anand sometime back pointed out in the post "tips on interpretation"
how one has to resolve while explaining mAdhvipAnAlasa. Even simple
words may give scope to interpret it differently.  Each word carries an
history with it and its meanings change over a period of time. When it
comes to explaining supra-sensory feelings (revelations) they may not
serve as an accurate vehicle to express it.
