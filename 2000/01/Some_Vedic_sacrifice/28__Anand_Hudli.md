 Not so. There is absolutely no question of reconciling shruti with
 smR^iti. Reconciliation is possible ONLY when two or more texts
 at the SAME level of authority seemingly contradict each other.
 Reconciliation cannot be done when one text is at a higher level of
 authority than the others under consideration. In such cases, the
 text at the higher level wins, hands down!

 Back to your specific question on the injunction on the jyotishhToma,
 the smR^iti which says only the wealthy may do it is NOT contradicting
 the shruti. It is explaining the shruti injunction without contradicting
 it. The shruti, in this case, has never said you must do the jyotishhToma
 at all costs such as, for example, when you are seriously ill or in a
 comatose state. The shruti cannot go on exhaustively listing all
 conditions under which you may or may not do the jyotishhToma. It is
 left to the smR^iti and other authoritative sources of dharma to do this.

 Yes, I agree "smR^iti comes in handy while interpreting shruti, and is
 complementary to it" but only as long as the smR^iti does not contradict
 the shruti. If there is a contradiction, the particular text of the
 smR^iti must be ignored. (Other parts of the smR^iti which do not
 contradict the shruti are fine and we accept them.)

 Not by any means. Please read my previous message again. There is no
 mistake at all that the shruti and also as interpreted by the shrauta
 sUtras means actual animals, not animals made of grains. There is no
 possibility that the shrauta shAstras can mean anything other than
 real animals in flesh and blood for the following additional reasons:

 1) The shrauta texts mention prAyashchittas or atonement if the
    sacrificial animal passes urine or excrement during the sacrifice.
    How can this atonement possibly make sense if animals made of
    grains are used? Can a dummy animal made of grain pass urine?

 2) The shrauta texts also mention that "Ajya" or ghee may be used in
   place of the sacrificial animal if the animal gets lost or dies
   before the sacrifice. Again, how can such an injunction refer to
   a dummy animal? Can a dummy animal get lost? May be, but not likely.
   Can it die? Think about it.

 3) The proponents of the "pishhTa-pashu-yaGYas", the Vaishnavas and
    yourself included, overlook one thing. Even when the "pishhTa-pashu"
    (animal made of grain) is used, such a pashu gets done the
    prANa-pratishhThA rite which means you intend the pashu to be filled
    with life. Then you go ahead and "kill" it. By doing this are you
    not, at least in principle, breaking your lofty vow of ahiMsA
    that says "thou shalt not kill."

 Again, read the arguments I have offered above and in my previous post.

 The smArta tradition has rejected the pishhTa-pashu-yaGYa principle
 all along.

 This view cannot be defended regardless of whether it is supported by
 the mahAbhArata or not for the reasons I mentioned above. Even if the
 mahAbhArata were to condemn animal sacrifices, its position cannot be
 higher than the brAhmaNa texts of the Vedas and the shrauta texts by
 BodhAyana, ApastaMba, and others, which also qualify as smR^iti. The
 latter texts are more authoritative on *this* issue because they are
 supposed to be texts specifically made for shrauta karmas unlike the
 mahAbhArata which is not specifically about shrauta karmas.

 This is going beyond the scope of this discussion and not relevant.
 I will have to discuss it in a separate thread if no one else is
 willing to do so. It is not only Shankara but also RAmAnuja, Madhva,
 shrIkaNTha, and may be others as well. All these AchAryas are unanimous
 on this issue as indicated by the Brahma sUtra "ashuddhamiti chenna
 shabdAt.h", though they may sharply differ on other issues. Can all
 these AchAryas be wrong? I dont think so.

 It could be the other way round. The mahAbhArata may have influenced
 the Buddhists and they may have misinterpreted it and then influenced
 others.
