Thank you so much for telling me exactly what I wanted to hear! I can now
say I have absolutely no desire whatsoever for heaven and that I choose
not to perform this particular sacrifice!

Not at all -- nothing to do with pointing out contradictions or
inconsistencies.

I personally have never come across an animal sacrifice and would do
almost anything to squirm out of performing such a sacrifice. If there's
any -- ANY -- allowance whatsoever in this regard, I would immediately
make use of it and choose the alternative.

Had I been brought up in an environment where animal slaughter was
routine, I may have become "desensitized" to the killing of an animal, and
maybe even performed such a sacrifice with alacrity. But there's no way I
can start now, and will definitely not do so if there's a choice element
involved.

That's why I explored PishhTa-pashu yaGYas and other alternatives galore,
thinking the sacrifices may be an obligatory duty for me :-)

That's no problem, and is none of my business anyway. I'm no animal rights
activist.

Then that's it for me :-)

That wouldn't be necessary if the performance is by choice and not a rule
to be enforced.
