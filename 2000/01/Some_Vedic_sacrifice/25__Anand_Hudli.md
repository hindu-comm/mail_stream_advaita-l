 OK, let's get converted to Vaishnavism. :-)

 More seriously, it is  commonly acknowledged that 1) shruti, 2) smR^iti,
 3) conduct of good people, and 4) one's own noble desire, intuition or
 conscience, are the four pillars of dharma. And each of these is more
 powerful than the succeeding one. When there is a conflict between
 factor i, 1 <= i <= 3, and factor (i+1) on any issue, factor i is
 declared the winner and its dictates must be followed. It also follows
 that whatever the shruti says overrides whatever any other source of
 dharma may say to the contrary.

 This being the case, the shruti clearly declares animal sacrifices
 by vAkyas such as:

 agnIshhomIyaM pashumAlabheta,
 pashumAlabhya puroDAshaM nirvapati,
 tArpyeNAshvag.hM saMGYapayanti,

 By means of clear words such as "pashu" (animal), Alabheta (should
 be sacrificed/killed), saMGYapayanti (should be killed), etc., the
 shruti makes it known to us that animals are to be killed in certain
 yaGYas. Again, a YaGYa is also called "adhvara." The word adhvara
 is the opposite of "dhvara" which arises from the root "dhvR^i" and
 means "killing." Therefore, the word "adhvara" is interpreted as
 saying that though there is killing of animals in a yaGYa, this is
 really NOT killing, NOT hiMsA.

 Some people argue that the brAhmaNa portions of the Vedas that speak
 of animal sacrifices are not to be considered as shruti but only the
 mantra portions. By this, they are really proposing that the Veda is
 "eka-desha-prAmANya", meaning it is an authority in one place, and
 not in another. This is clearly unacceptable to all orthodox schools
 of Indian philosophy, not just advaita.

 It is important to note that the great AchAryas such as Shankara,
 RAmAnuja, and even Madhva, as far as I know, endorse the validity
 of animal sacrifices in their respective sUtra bhAshhyas. Surely,
 these AchAryas would have considered a great number and variety of
 sources, including the 'bhArata, before they commented on "ashuddhamiti
 chenna shabdAt.h" It is more likely that giving up of animal sacrifices
 came about under the nonVedic influence of the Buddhists and Jainas.
