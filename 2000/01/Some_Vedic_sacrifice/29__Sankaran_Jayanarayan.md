OK.

Prima facie, there is simply an injunction in the shruti that one must
perform the jotishhaa sacrifice every spring. Taking it at face value, it
does appear that it is enjoined on ALL dvijas irrespective of illness,
desire, wealth, etc. But one notes that smR^iti has something to say on
this issue also.

We take a look at it and find two points made in the smR^iti:

1) The Apastamba shrauta suutra which says that it is to be performed by
one who has the desire for svarga.

2) Some others (YAGYavalkya, etc.) who say that it a nitya karma for the
wealthy alone and NOT for the poor.

Considering both the above declarations, why can we not say the injunction
is applicable for one who has the desire for heaven AND the required
wealth?

The dharma shAstras are clear that the nitya karmas enjoined on a person
are to be performed without desire. Why the mention of desire in the
shrauta suutra if it is an obligatory duty? Isn't it blatantly out of
context to mention desire regarding one's dharma?

If the shrauta suutra is the CHIEF smR^iti to consult in this regard, why
should it say "svargakamo yajeta" at all?

Yes, the shrauta suutras do interpret it as real animals.

But as to the interpretation of this from the shruti, I had heard from
shrI Subhanu Saxena that in the second prashna of the taittirIya AraNyaka
dealing with the brahma yaGYa, there is a mention of the recital of the
itihAsas/purANas as being akin to the offering of flesh in a yaGYa. In the
shruti itself, we find a *symbolic* portrayal of the elements used in a
yaGYa.

I'm sorry, but I wasn't aware of this. This is actually worse considering
it goes against the shAstra as well as one's conscience.

I read this in the book on Hindu dharma by the kAnchi paramAchArya, and
will get the book next week and find out what his opinions on this issue
are.

I was of the opinion that MAdhva was the propounder of the PishhTa pashu
yaGYa, and that is what you had in mind when you said "Vaishnavas" perform
such yaGYas.
