For the benefit of people searching for topics through the archives let's
use more descriptive subject lines than just "question."

Dharmasutras and smrtis are different things.  There are supoposedly 18
smrtis and 18 upasmrtis.  Kalpa is the vedanga dealing with all aspects of
Shrauta and Grhya rituals.  Inter alia they also discuss Dharma.  Some
Shakhas have seperate Dharmasutras, in others that subject is covered in
the Grhyasutra or just omitted.  Further complicating things, some of the
authors of Smrtis on the list are actually authors of Dharmasutras so it
is not clear if they wrote two seperate works or one.

There is a Yajnavalkya Smrti.  It is not tied to any particular shakha.

Note also all Dharmashastras are authoritative regardless of
shakha.
