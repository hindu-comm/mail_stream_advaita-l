namaste

I was asked by shrI Ram Chandran to post about the giitaa
satsang, a group discussion of bhagavat giita based on
shan.kara's commentary (and also compartive notes from other
commentaries) from Jan 1st 2000. You can find more details about
it from advaitins at yahoo.com or their page

http://www.onelist.com/community/advaitin/

and

Thank you.

Sincerely,

Ravi
