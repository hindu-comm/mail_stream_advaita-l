This is about the colors mentioned in the verse.

There is a Tamil work called "thiruvaachagam" composed by a great
saint shrii maaNikka-vaachagar who is  one of the naayanmaars
(shaivite saints who lead the bhakti movement in the Tamil land).
In this work, there is section called "shiva-puraaNam" which is
like the crown jewel of the work. I have heard that many
references in it are from shrii rudram.  In that poem, the
following phrase occurs.

"niRa~NgaL Or aindhuDaiyaan"
"He who has five colors"

These five colors are related to five elements (pa~ncha
bhuutaa-s). Earth (golden), water (white), fire (red), air
(black) and space (blue). Are there references to it in shrii
rudram ?

Thanks.

Ravi
