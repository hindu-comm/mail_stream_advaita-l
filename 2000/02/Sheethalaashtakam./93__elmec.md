Sri Gurubhyo Namaha

Has any  of you heard of the "Sheethalaashtaka Stotra"  and know its
meaning in
full ?

I do not know who the composer is. The shloka begins with the words :

Vandeyham Sheethalaam deviim Raasabhasthaam Digambaraam
Maarjanii kalashopethaam Shoorpaalankrita Mastakaam .

I have heard from an aunty of mine that the above Ashtakam is very
efficacious in curing all skin diseases. In many of the stanzas the word
" Visphotakabhayam "  repeatedly appears which I understand refer to the
Small pox which used to be highly rampant in olden days. I believe once
Sringeri Acharya Himself had advised a patient of severe eczema to chant
the above shloka which later cured 90 % of his problem ! I have the full
script and am very much interested to know the meaning.

Regards,
Hari Om,
Latha Vidyaranya
