Dear Bhagavathas,

I am sreeninivas from Tirupathi in AP, India. I work currently in
Wirpo
Ltd Bangalore as a senior software engineer.

I came to hear more about Advaitha vedanta very recently and to me it
looks very logical and wonderful, ofcourse I have many many doubts. Am
very much interested about this philosophy from others standpoint too.
So I want to join the list. Hope I would benifit from your mails in
clearing some of my doubts and strengthen my understanding and
practice
of Advaitha philosophy.

thanks & regards
Sreenivas(Pallati) 408.525.9027(O) 408.615.1312(R)
