This is the final post of this series. Whole text with translation is
available in the Jaguar site. This one of my favorite stotra-s and I
found it very easy to memorize and also quite musical in nature. In
retrospect, I think I could have done a better job in
translation. Since I did not have time, I did not edit what I posted
to Jaguar site few years back. I apologize for the errors. Since the
original text was given, I hope you will be able to understand it
better directly from it.

Thank you.

Ravi

That holy devotee, who prostrates to Lord Guha, reciting the Bhujanga
stotra daily, with devotion, will be blessed with good sons, good
wife, wealth and long life, and at end of his life, will attain
eternal bliss with Lord Skanda
