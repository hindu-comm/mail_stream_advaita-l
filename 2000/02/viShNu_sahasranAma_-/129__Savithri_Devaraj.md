Shloka 3

18:   yogaH:  One attainable through yoga, and yoga is defined as
follows:

    GYAnendriyANi sarvANi nirudhya manasA saha
    ekatva-bhAvanA yogaH xetraj~na-paramAtmanoH

That is, the contemplation of the unity of the jIvatmA and the paramAtmA
with the organs of knowledge and the mind withheld, is yoga.

19: yogavidAm neta: The master of those who are established in the
above-mentioned yoga.  For the Lord says in Bhagavad GItA (9-22):

teShAM nityAbhiyuktAnAM yogakxemaM vahAmyahaM,

- "Of those who are ever united with me in communion, I bear their
yogaxema - preservation of their wordly and spiritual interests."
