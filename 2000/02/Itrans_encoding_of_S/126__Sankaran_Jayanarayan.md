Most people here are using the "Itrans" way of encoding Sanskrit words in
English. You can find the code at the URL:

http://www.aczone.com/itrans/dvng/node3.html

Basically, the Sanskrit alphabet becomes:
-----------------------------
a  A(or aa)  i  I(or ii)  u  U(or uu)  R^i  R^I  e  ai  o  au  aM  aH

k       kh         g    gh      N^
ch      Ch(or chh) j    jh      JN
T       Th         D    Dh      N
t       th         d    dh      n
p       ph         b    bh      m

y  r  l  v  sh  Sh(or shh)  s  h

kSh(or x)  tr  GY
-----------------------------

The only problem I find while using the above convention while referring
to Sanskrit texts in a discussion where the medium of communication is
English, is that in English, proper nouns have their first letter
capitalized, and applying this rule to a Sanskrit name may sometimes
distort the meaning. For example, I write "Shankara" following the
English way, since the rest of the sentence is in English, and it makes
sense to capitalize a proper noun, although this does injustice to the
Itrans system, where the name should really read "shankara."
