I failed to include some important accents which are also required to
encode Sanskrit documents:

Specials/Accents:
-----------------
Anusvara:       .n / M   (dot on top of previous consonant/vowel)
Avagraha:       .a    (`S' like symbol basically to replace a after o)
Ardhachandra:   .c    (for vowel sound as in english words `cat' or
`talk')
Chandra-Bindu:  .N    (chandra-bindu on top of previous letter)
Halant:         .h    (to get half-form of the consonant - no vowel -
virama)
Visarga:        H     (visarga - looks like a colon character)
Om:             OM, AUM (Om symbol)


You can access several Sanskrit documents from the web-site
http://www.alkhemy.com/sanskrit/
(there's also a link to the Itrans 5.1 transliteration scheme from there)

If you have the time, please feel free to contribute to the literature
already encoded so far.
