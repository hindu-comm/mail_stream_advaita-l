Aravind kumar asked a question about one's daily spiritual
practice. In sanskrit it is called Ahnikam. I am not qualified to
write about it. I think Giri, Rama, Jaldhar, Anand, Vidya, and
Aravind Krishna to mention a few* are qualified to write about it
here.  I ask them to contribute their daily spiritual practices.
That way it will serve as a guidance to people like me.

With respects,
Ravi
