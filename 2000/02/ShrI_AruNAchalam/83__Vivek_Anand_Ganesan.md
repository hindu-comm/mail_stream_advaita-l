  Since my native place is ShrI AruNAchala ( more commonly
known as "ThiruvannAmalai" in Thamizh ), I feel compelled
to
respond to the above.  Most of the locals, despite being so
close to RamaNashram are blissfully unaware of his
greatness.  He is only known as a saint who is popular with
the "foriegners".  In fact, the Ashram attracts a lot of
foriegn tourists.

  Of course, the real sanctity lies in the beautiful temple
and the serene Ashram.  One does get a real feeling of his
"presence" in the Ashram and in the secluded hill trails
that he used to wander in.  Beyond that, the town is a
noisy
, dusty and altogether forbidding place.
