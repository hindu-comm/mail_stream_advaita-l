The left half of ardhanaariishvara which is occupied by ambaaL is
adorned with musk and kumkumam. The other half occupied by the
Lord is smeared with ashes from the funeral pyre. The ambaaL
aspect is well adorned and pleasing to reflect on, the Lord's
half is ill adorned (with ashes, snakes, elephant skin) is
dreadful. I bow to this wonderful form, I bow to ambaa shivaa and
Lord shiva.
