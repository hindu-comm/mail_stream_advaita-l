Left side of Lord which is occupied by ambaaL is adorned with
beautiful kankana (bracelets worn of the wrist) and nuupura
(worn at the ankle). These make very pleasing sound when they
move. The right lotus feet is adorned with a cobra as
nuupura. angada is an ornament adorning the lower elbows. On the
left side it is made of gold and on the right side it is a
snake. Such is the wonderful form of the Lord. I bow to shrii
shivaa and Lord shiva.

--
snakes represent the senses. They are dreadful and lead one to
the cycle of death and birth. By adorning the snakes, as a
yogiishvara, Lord demonstrates His mastery and control over them.
