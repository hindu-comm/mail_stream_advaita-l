Thanks, Anand Natarajan, for your quick response to my questions. I have some follow-up questions to your answers.

I thought I had bought all the books available on Ramana but perhaps not...is there a published work called 'The Prasthanathraya of Bhagavan Ramana Maharshi'?  ...Is there an English translation of Ramana Gita and Sad Darshanam (perhaps these are contained as a part of  books with some other titles; do you know?)

Interesting...are you established in self-enquiry or Jnana 24 hours a day? My understanding is that practice is necessary as long as you are not established in  AtmaJnana. Do you work for a living and are you able to  'roll with the punches' from a 'serene center' constantly? It is very tough for me to do this 'practie-less' practice and I'd love to hear your experiences leading to this state or related to this.

Where can I purchase this tape? Btw, I have a wonderful 2 cassette tape version of BG offered by Music Today, which has a selection of about 170 slokas from BG. Learning these 170 slokas from these tapes has been a  very pleasant experience as they are set to wonderful music and most are repeated a couple of times.

Look forward to further insights,

Arvind
