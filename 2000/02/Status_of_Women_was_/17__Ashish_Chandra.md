A pious and virtuous woman devoted to her husband is said to literally fall
dead upon hearing the news of her husband's death (eg, Jayadeva's wife was
tested by their queen of this very quality). This queen had lied and said
that Jayadeva (composer of Gita Govinda) had died. Upon hearing this,
Jayadeva's wife (can't remember her name) literally fell dead.

Overcome by such grief (of having lost her husband), a woman would often
take recourse to sati but this was never an injunction. However, should the
woman continue to live the rest of her days as a widow, she was often looked
after by her immediate family. According to Manu Smriti 9.29, a woman
devoted to her husband, being of a calm mind, would join her husband in
svargaloka after her death.

A man was not required to remarry. It was optional. And that too because as
a Grihasta, who has not yet attained the maturity for Sannayas, he still
needed to perform the nitya and naimittika karmas like aupasana etc. This
required that his spouse be present with him. Hence the option. Otherwise,
the man could always take Sannyasa, of an inferior type.

I guess if the man had children to look after, he would often remarry since
he could not take Sannayas and he had to still perform the daily rituals. If
a widowed woman had children to look after, they would be taken care of by
their extended family, jati or the village.

I do have a question. I came across the following post which quoted the
Atharva Veda as saying that widow remarriage was "favoured" in the Atharva
Veda. Maybe someone who has the AV Samhita can look this up.

"O widow ! Move away from the mortal remains of thy husband. You need not
remain a widow. Your brother-in-law is ready to take you as his
wife." (Atharva : 9 : 5 : 27 & 18 : 3 : 2)

Can someone verify whether remarriage is being talked. Manu Smriti is fairly
clear on when a brother-in-law may take his sister-in-law for a wife (MS
9.69 : If the (future) husband of a maiden dies after troth verbally
plighted, her brother-in-law shall wed her according to the following
rule...)

Manu Smriti 5.160 says that even a sonless woman reaches heaven after her
death if she were always chaste just like the "thousands of Brahamanas who
have attained to svargaloka even though they were unmarried."


Any corrections welcome.
