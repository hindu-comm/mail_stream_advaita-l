Ashish.

Thank you. There are few dictionaries on the net. Monier-Williams is
completely available on the net. I use it very often.

Since Vidya has already started a series, you can discuss with him and
complement the existing series. In fact, by the time you finish posting
the complete shankara bhaashhya in sanskrit for  the verses Vidya has
already posted (II:23). he will be ready to resume the series (you should
give a week at least for one verse). If you both can decide on a plan it
will be very nice. For instance, you will post the original in Sanskrit
first and Vidya will post his translation, then all of us can jump into
the discussion.

\aside:

giita is very important text. Even if we do it slowly, it is fine. Only
thing that was lacking in the past was the active participation of the
list. If only we had raised all our questions and objections when Vidya
was discussing, we could have learnt lot from him, anand, and others.
Atleast we should do that now. I request everyone to participate  in the
ongoing discussions.

With respects to all.

Ravi
