I have written to RK Math and asked them for permission to use Sh. Warrier's
English translations. I am still waiting on it. Unfortunately, my Sanskrit
dictionary is back home in NJ (I am currently in Dallas). I hope that RK
Math write back saying that they have no objections, pending which, I shall
try and do what Jaladhar has suggested. Needless to say, my Sanskrit is just
a shade better than my French :-) but I'll try because there is ample
opportunity for being corrected here.
