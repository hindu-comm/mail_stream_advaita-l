I thought about this but going through a work word by word is IMO, is an
excellent educational method.  And the Gita is relatively short,
uncomplicated, and interesting enough that the initial tedium of going
back and forth with a dictionary will not cause one to lose interest.  Yet
even when one has achieved fluency, still has many facets to explore.

In the end it is up to Ashish to decide what he wants to do, the various
suggestions we have offered are just that--suggestions.
