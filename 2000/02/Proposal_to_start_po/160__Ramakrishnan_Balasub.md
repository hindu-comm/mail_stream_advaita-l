I am not sure if you are going to post only the bhAshhya or the
translation by Sri Warrier also. Please do not post the latter. I find
a disturbing trend of people copying whole sections from books without
getting permission. Quoting small parts with attribution is one thing
and posting entire articles (even with attribution) is something else.
While it is highly unlikely that the R.K.Mutt people or anyone else
would start litigation on such violations of copyrights, let's try to
adhere to the law. Please do post the sha.nkara bhAshhya with your
translation. Or if using someone else's translation please get the
permission.

My intention is not to offend anyone, I hope that's clear!

Rama
