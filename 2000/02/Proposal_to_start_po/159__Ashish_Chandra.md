Namaste All,

I have been reading a little of Acharya's Bhagawat Gita Bhashya, translation
by Shri A.G. Krishnan Warrier. While I have understood some of the portions,
I have had difficulty in understanding most of them, especially the sections
dealing with Jnana (haven't gone past Chapter 4). If the members here wish,
I would like to start posting the BGB. Transliteration might be a problem
but I will try my best. I will wait for the members' views on this.

ashish
