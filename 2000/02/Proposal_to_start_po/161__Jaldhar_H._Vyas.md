According to the "fair use" provisions of international copyright law (The
Berne convention), it is legal to copy short passages ("short" being
rather vaguely defined) for educational purposes which this certainly is.
Copying entire articles or sections of a book is not allowed without the
express permission of the copyright holder.  Note this would only apply to
the translation.  The Gita and Shankaracharyas' Bhashya are in the public
domain.  After (I think) 60 years copyrights lapse and revert to public
domain.

Another technique you can use is to paraphrase the translation in your own
words.  That's allowed.  In fact it could be highly educational to sit
down with a Sanskrit dictionary and attempt your own translation, using
Warrier's for comparison.  The language of the Gita is relatively quite
simple and even the bhashya is not as complicated as some of
Shankaracharyas'  other works.

I also hope the comments above will not discourage Ashish from this
excellent project.
