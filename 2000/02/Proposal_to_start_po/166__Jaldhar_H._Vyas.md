Me too.  And on the one or two times I was able to access it, I kept
getting javascript errors using IE5 on Windows NT, and Netscape 4.7 on
Linux.  Which is a shame because it looks like it could be a great
resource.

Has anyone been successful in accessing it?  (The url is
http://www.iitk.ac.in/gita)  If so which browser were you using?
