I have not donated extensive wealth to brAhmaNas, contemplating on
Shiva. I have never offered oblations in agni accompanied by one
lakh (a hundred thousand) utterances of Your bIja-mantra. I have never
performed austerities on the banks of the gaN^gA river, following the
rules for Vratas (observances) and japa,  accompanied by the
recitation of the shrI-rudra-adhyAya and other Vedic hymns. O Shiva!
O MahAdeva! O Shambhu ! Forgive my offense!

I do not remember Shankara, the Inner Controller (antaryAmin) of all,
being situated in the thousand-petaled lotus (sahasrAra chakra) where the
subtle energy rises,  where the prANas merge into the praNava sound (AUM),
where the purports of the veda-vAkyas merge into the Supreme Reality that
is fully manifested as being full of brilliance and peace. O Shiva!
O MahAdeva! O Shambhu! Forgive my offense!

Anand
