As readers may already know, I have included a large number of links to
traditional and modern institutions connected with advaita vedAnta in the
FAQ page at our website - http://www.advaita-vedanta.org/avhp/ad_faq.html.
I notice that some of the sites I had included earlier are no longer valid,
or have moved to new URLs. If visitors from this list happen to notice such
a thing, I would greatly appreciate it if they could let me know by email
(vsundaresan at hotmail.com), so that I can make a note of it for the next
update.

Currently, I see that the page I had obtained for the Adhyatma Prakasha
Karyalaya, Holenarsipur (Swami Saccidanandendra Sarasvati) is no longer
available. The old address was www.culturalindia.com/karyalaya.htm. I have
been unable to find whether it is online at some other site. If someone
knows more about it, please inform me.

Regards,
Vidyasankar
