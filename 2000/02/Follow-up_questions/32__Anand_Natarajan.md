The english translations and commentaries of Sad Darshanam, Upadesha Saram, Ramana Gita are certainly available. Swami Tejomayanadaji , the head of Chinmaya Mission has published commentaries on Upadesha Saram and Sad Darshanam.
Besides this there are english commenataries published by Sri RamanaAshram.

I did'nt say anything of not doing practise. All I commented about was that  of enhancement. If we practise looking for enhancement , most likely our practise will fail. I am sure Bhagavan Ramana would ask , Who is it that is seeking enhancement ?

Regards,
             Anand
