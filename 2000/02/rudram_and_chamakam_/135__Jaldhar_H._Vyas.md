I posted about this sometime last year.  According to the
Shatapathabrahmana, the Rudradhyaya is also called "shantadaivatam"
Because Rudra Bhagawan pervades all, we can't get a space to perform the
Yajna unless he has vacated it first, so it is a request to Him to leave
quietly and not be angry with us for his deeds.  (Especially because it is
for personal gain.)

The namaka is the 16th adhyaya of the Vajasaneyi Samhita, and the chamaka
is the 18th.
