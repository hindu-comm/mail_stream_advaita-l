I am very happy to have received such quick response from Sri Ravi with
all the details available regarding the Sheethalaashtaka Stotram. The
script accompanied  really has saved my browsing time and I could even
make some corrections in the script which I already had. Thanks to Sri
Ravi. I hope to receive the translation in due course and I am sure it
will benefit lot of readers.

Thank you once again,
Regards,
Hari Om,
Latha
