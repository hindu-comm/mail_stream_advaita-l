There are clearly three disciplines identified in the gItA -
 karma, bhakti, and GYAna. GYAna involves the practice of shravaNa,
 manana, and nididhyAsana. During shravaNa, one listens to the
 vedAnta-vAkyas from the Guru. It is during the second phase of
 manana that there is a need for "tarka" or logical inquiry to eliminate
 any doubts that arise and threaten to negate the purport of the
 shravaNa.

 MadhusUdana defines in his gItA bhAshhya what manana is:
  "shravaNa-nirdhAritArtha-bAdhashaN^kApanodaka-
  tarkAnusandhAna-rUpamanana-parAyaNA
  iti|" This means those who are absorbed in reflection or
  manana whose nature is the logical inquiry to eliminate doubts
  that could possibly negate the purport ascertained  by shravaNa.

  Yes, the arguments do seem to be "hair-splitting" but such
  "fine-grained" arguments are necessary in manana as a preparation
  for nididhyAsana when not even a single thought that impedes the
  continuous flow of thoughts can be entertained!

 Of course, bhakti is itself recognized by MadhusUdana as a discipline
 that is sufficient for one to cross the ocean of samsaric existence.
 There is no such requirement for "hair-splitting" in bhakti. It is
 only in the GYAna discipline that the intellect's thirst for logical
 explanations must be quenched.
