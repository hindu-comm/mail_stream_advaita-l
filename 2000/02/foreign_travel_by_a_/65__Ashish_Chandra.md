Don't think Varnaashrama Dharma is followed in either of these places i.e.
Paris or Alaska. However, the part about California etc is not that far
fetched if one were to read the book Hindu Dharma. The Paramaacharya has
mentioned the very same. However, he is of the view that the Vedic culture
once existed all over the world. The land of Bhaarat Varsha is as defined by
the Vishnu purana (?) "Uttaram yat samuddrasya, himaadrashchaiva
dakshiNam...". You can refer to the extract from Hindu Dharma here:

I would appreciate if someone were to explain what we mean when we say Jambu
Dveepe as a part of the Sandhyavandanaa. Dveep means an island doesn't it?
