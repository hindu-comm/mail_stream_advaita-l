Thanks Ashish, for the informative mail. But when it
is said that "Dharmaprachaar can be done in a place
where the Saaranga deer roams freely *and* where
Varnaashrama Dharma is followed" does it not mean that
both the conditions have to be taken care of?
Otherwise it could have been a *or* instead of the
*and*. And I don't know of a place where *both* the
conditions are met. Even if there are some, the places
must be very few. And does it mean that one can live
only in those places?

I am asking all these questions because if we feel
that the Shastras have to be followed verbatim, come
what may, not giving scope for a difference in
interpretation due to prevailing circumstances and
worldly order, do we not have to take care of "the
Saaranga deer" condition *also*?

If we can interpret it this way here then why should
not the interpretation differ elsewhere depending of
what the mahatmas say etc.?

And also I think that other than the Brahmins, the
others used to eat meat in the olden days. Also there
is an opinion that the Brahmins themselves in the
vedic age might not have been averse to eating meat.
There was a big discussion on vegetarianism in the
list just about 15 days back!

Please enlighten me.

Thanks

Rajesh
