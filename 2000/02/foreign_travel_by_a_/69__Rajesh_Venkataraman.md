I was actually referring to the mail which started
this thread viz. foreign travel by a sanyasin. There
it is the *and* condition.

Also the manu smriti which you have quoted viz.

24. Let twice-born men seek to dwell in those
(above-mentioned countries);
but a Sudra, distressed for subsistence, may reside
anywhere.

says that "Let twice-born men *seek* to dwell in
those(above-mentioned countries)" which seems to mean
*desirable* and not absolutely essential.

I was just trying to find out how rigid we should be
in following the shastras.

Perfectly true.

Actually I brought this Brahmin vegetarianism into
picture because when we can say that

it(true Dharma Prachaara) would not have been possible
even in the olden days when even if they had "looked
at animals as a manifestation of Brahman and not as a
piece of meat to be consumed", they were still killing
them!! It is actually worse than killing them without
knowing that they are manifestation of Brahman! And
also Brahmins are said to have been part of that!!
