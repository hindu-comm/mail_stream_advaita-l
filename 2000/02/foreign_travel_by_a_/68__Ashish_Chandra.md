Refer to the quotes from Manu Smriti that I had provided in an earlier email
in this thread. The areas where Varnaashrama dharma (henceforth dharma) is
followed i.e. Brahmavarta, Aryavarta etc. are described as being suitable
for residence of those who follow this dharma. The *and* I provided was an
"also" condition. I did not mean Saranga deer AND the areas mentioned for
dharma. Also refer to Kartik's quote from Vishnu Purana describing the area
of Bharat Varsha where the dharma is followed and where the cycle of yugas
takes place.

Shastras cannot exist in vacuum. As Vidyasankar pointed out a few days back,
we must look at the conduct of men who are versed in the Shastras. But it is
rare that the conduct of such men is contrary to the position of the
Shastras. After all, the traditional education one would obtain in the
Shastras would be at the hands of a person well versed in the same.

There have been mahatmas like Ramkrishna Paramhamsa and Shri Yukteshwar Giri
who have sent their shishyas abroad against the injunction of the Shastras.
I would like one of the learned members in this list to please comment on
that.

According to the late Paramaachaarya of Kanchi, in his book Hindu Dharma, he
writes that other jatis (besides Brahmins) were allowed to eat meat.
Kshatriyas, for example, were traditionally non-vegetarians. According to
the late Paramaachaarya, the sway vegetarianism has taken is because of the
conduct of the priestly class. Ditto for the tradition of vratas and other
fasts. People engaged in physically exertive activities are in fact exempt
from these body-taxing fasts. However, observing the conduct of Brahmins,
people took to these traditions. Someone also pointed out here that even
after sacrifices wherein an animal was sacrificed, the priests traditionally
swallowed a tiny piece of the animal for prasad purposes.

However, I have read in a few places that the Lokayatas (materialistic
school in Hindu philosophy) used to accuse the Brahmins of "salivating at
the prospect of animal sacrifices" as that was the only way they could eat
meat. I don't know how much truth is there to such accusations but we might
as well concede that there might have been (some truth).

"I met Paramahansa Yogananda in Calcutta in 1935. I have been
following the accounts of his activities ever since. As a bright light
shining in the midst of darkness, so was Yogananda's presence in this
world. Such a great soul comes on earth only rarely, When there is a
real need among men"
                shrI chandrasekharendra sarasvati (kAnchi periyavar)
