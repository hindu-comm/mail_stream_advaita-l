If even dharma prachaara can be done only where the
"black Saaranga deer" wanders carefreely, logically it
can be done only in forests. Then how do Grhasthas
come to know about Dharma, as they cannot be expected
to go into the forests at least for quite some time!
And when they do go into the forests, I thought it is
more for gaining jnana.

Is there any injunction like this for the preaching
Jnana kanda also?

Thanks

Rajesh
