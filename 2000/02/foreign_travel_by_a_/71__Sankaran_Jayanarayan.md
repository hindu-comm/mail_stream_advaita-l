I want to know more about this. In most of the dharmashAstras I've read,
Aryavarta is mentioned as the best place for enquiry into the nature of
dharma. But are you trying to imply that this is because there were no
BrAhmaNas in the south to begin with, and that the ones presently settled
in the south are all descendents of those who migrated from the north?
Is there any other evidence for this theory?

But there does seem to be a conviction on your part that he wouldn't :-)

I didn't say anything about sannyaasis when I first started this topic. I
only to know whether or not it is the practice of orthodox BrAhmaNas to
perform a rite of penance after a trip abroad. IMO, this is still pretty
much the case. I sincerely doubt if the Sringeri AchArya would say that
this is not required. This is also part of shishhTAchAra.

I guess you must have also included the people who lived in the past.
RamaNa has said that anyone (even if he be an athiest?) who lives
in the aruNAchala mountain will get enlightenment (Rama said so in an old
posting). This may be because a GYAni like RamaNa had lived there. But
this is a fact -- that the place aruNAchala has special sanctity.

It is precisely in this sense that India is a puNya-bhuumi. It has had the
privilege of being home to many saints, and Shankara has travelled all
over its many kingdoms during his time. There is a great sanctity
associated with the country.
