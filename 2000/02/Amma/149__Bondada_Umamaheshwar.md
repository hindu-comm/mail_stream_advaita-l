Namaste!

I would like to thank Ravi for mentioning about Mata Amritanandamayi Devi
(Amma) in this list.  I have had the fortune of visiting her in Hyderabad,
AP, India, yesterday night.

What Ravi said about her is very true!  All are equal to Her, She gives
Darshan to one and all.

Regarding my experience, I can only say that the Ocean is verily big but the
pot is small!

Thank you Ravi!

Namaste

Uma
