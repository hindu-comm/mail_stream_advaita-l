Few months ago, Rama gave me a book on nityAhnikam and also
I had another book by a north Indian pandit on a similar
subject from UT library.  If one decides to live by it,
one's whole day will be permeated with thoughts of God.
Right from getting up, to going to bed, there are so many
mantra-s.


 I asked a priest about aupAsana. He told me doing aupAsana
 is close to impossible these days. His main concern was
maintaining the fire continuously. Even I asked a
shrIvaishNava gentleman, I got the same answer. But some
say even if one cannot do it, one can mentally perform it
chanting the mantra-s.
