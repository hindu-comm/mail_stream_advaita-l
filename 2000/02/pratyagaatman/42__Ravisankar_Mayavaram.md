Anand,

Thank you. And thanks to Rama and Jaldhar for responding to my question.

This reminds me that I should search the archives before asking something.


After reading this, I understand, Sri Krishna Warrier has quite accurately
translated it as Subject. As you point out in your original article, the
Self can never be known like how we know other objects through pramAna-s,
Hence it is always the Subject.  I like the term sAxin used by Rama, as I
can grasp the meaning quickly from that word.


Ravi
