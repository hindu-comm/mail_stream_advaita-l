Ok thanks for the correction.  Convntionally pratyak means "prior" or
"each" in Sanskrit and because Bhagawan in that shloka is explaining how
He pervades all beings I thought and prior to that He has described his
universal form, it is the limited form which is being described here.  But
from the sutrabhashya it becomes much clearer.
