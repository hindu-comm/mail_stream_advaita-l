First of all, I must say that I have come across several people claiming
to be pious BrAhmaNas who find it convenient to be "more dhArmic" in
America. I found this quite distasteful, and was indeed glad to hear that
BodhAyana agrees with me.

I agree with you :-)

Ramana has said that "The Bible and the GItA are the same." I was able to
get a good translation of the Bible and thoroughly enjoyed reading the New
Testament about Jesus and his disciples. Sometimes I even went to a local
Church to pray, but I stopped this when I saw people abusing other faiths
in order to show that Christianity was superior. The way Christianity is
practised, it resembles vishishhTAdvaita and dvaita, though Ramana has
pointed out many similarities between advaita Vedanta and Jesus'
teachings.

The thread being "svadharma," and the topic being about VarNAshrama
dharma, I merely wanted to point out that the dharma of caste holds less
(way less) in America than in India.

To tell you the truth, I've never felt the same in any temple in the USA
(I've been to about ten) as I did in a small Shiva temple near my house in
Madras. Being in the presence of real devotees is better than being with
people who value wealth more than wisdom.
