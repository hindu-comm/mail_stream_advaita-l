If I remember correctly, the late Paramaachaarya of Kanchi Jagadguru
Chandrashekharendra Saraswati visited the Self Realization Fellowship
temples in the US sometime in the 1950s. I thought that usually the
Paramaachaarya would not even go to Mumbai because it was once an island
(and he would have to travel over water). Are the rules for Sannayaasis
different. Swami Vivekananda and Paramhansa Yoganandanda both spent a good
deal of time outside India. (They weren't Brahmins but does that matter in
terms of the injunction of not travelleing over the seas?)
