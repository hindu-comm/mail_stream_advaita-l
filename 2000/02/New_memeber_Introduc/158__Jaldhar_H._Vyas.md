I read the Vivekachoodamani and attended a class on the same by one of the
most respected teachers in Montreal. Our teacher is currently helping us
glimpse Bhagavad Gita. I realize that I want to get a much better grasp on
Advaita vedanta in particular and how Jnana and Bhakti yoga can complement
each other.

On first impression this site looked like a no nonsense good resource and
this is the reason I am interested in joining this list.

Since we are only given an overview in the class on the contents and much of
it is study on your own I would very much be interested on different
purports on the text esp. from advaita vedanta point of view.

Can you recommend me some books that expound the Gita.
