This clarifies a lot of misnomers on the status of women in your society. In
south, a female almost looks like a sanyAsi with saffron robes and shaved
head after her husbands death.  But its a question if the community really
imparted the knowledge for such a state to them or just the physical
renunciation was emphasized. There was no option for a female except to take
up this so-called Atma sanyAsa, but a man normally could remarry or stay
like that.
