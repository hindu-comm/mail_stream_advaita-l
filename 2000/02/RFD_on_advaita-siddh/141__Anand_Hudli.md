Taking a cue from Vaidya and elsewhere, before I post the reply of
MadhusUdana, I would like to request list members to discuss how the
objection by the opponent as described in "advaita-siddhi 12" may be
answered by the advaitin. I will wait for a few days before I post
the reply of MadhusUdana. And I intend to follow the same procedure
in my future postings on the advaita-siddhi. Whenever an objection
by the opponent is posted, I will wait for any discussion on the
response by list members before posting MadhusUdana's reply.

Thanks.

Anand
