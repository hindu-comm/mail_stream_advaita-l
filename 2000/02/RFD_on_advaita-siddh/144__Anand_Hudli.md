 As I wrote in response to Ravi's message, the negation can be
 treated as vyAvahArika. This is certainly a tenable position as
 we will see later in MadhusUdana's reply. But surprisingly,
 MadhusUdana convincingly argues that the negation can be taken
 as pAramArthika too! In this case, of course, MadhusUdana does
 not admit that the negation is different from Brahman, rather
 he says the negation is identical to Brahman! We will see shortly
 how he presents his argument.

 Clarifying again, I did not direct criticism at members who
 have shown some interest in some discussion or the other, but
 those who, for some inexplicable reason, just fade out into
 the background, after having introduced themselves.
