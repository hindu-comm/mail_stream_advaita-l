namaste,
     I too find fault with the third objection posed.
Please correct me if I am wrong.
Consider the example of the snake(creeper)on-the-rope
illusion.A person views the rope as a snake. After
sometime, he/she stops thinking it is a snake and
believes that it is a creeper. creeper-ness
essentially means non-snakeness. However, the
snake-ness and its negation as seen in the
creeper-ness ultimately get sublated in the reality of
the rope.
Similarly, it IS possible for the world and its
negation to get sublated in Brahman, or in other words
the negation of the vyaavahaarika world is
vyaavahaarika only.

regards,
Raghavendra.

Note:
Thanks to Sri Anand Hudli for his sharp criticism of
the lack of replies. I am guilty of that too. I went
through all the Advaita siddhi posts again after I
read that sharp mail. Your concern here is really
appreciated. I entirely agree with Sri. Hudli that a
mind is indeed a terrible thing to waste. Thanks to
Sri Hudli again for the great posts and please keep
them coming.
