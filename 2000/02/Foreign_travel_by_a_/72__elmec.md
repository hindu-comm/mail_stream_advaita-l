That term " where the Saaranga deer wanders freely " taken in a broader
sense  means the land where " Ahimsa " is
considered a parama dharma and where each and every animal is looked
upon as a manifestation of Brahman and not as a piece of meat to be
consumed. The elaborate answer supplied by Sri
Aashish is very educative and interesting. Thanks.

Hari Om,
Latha Vidyaranya
