That is not the only problem.  If you look closely at the
shankara-bhAshhya, you'll note that the readings he uses are often
different from the vulgate.  For instance, `sa tayA shraddhayA yuktastasya
rAdhanamIhate' (VII-22), where the vulgate, including in present-day
publications of the SGB, is `sa tayA shraddhayA yuktastasyArAdhanamIhate'.
I believe a list of all such variations was published in the past, but I
don't have a reference to it right now; you may be able to find out on
your own.

Shrisha Rao
