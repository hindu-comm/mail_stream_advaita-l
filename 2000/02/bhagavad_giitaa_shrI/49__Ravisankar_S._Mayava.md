I have included all the 42 verses and translation. This document
was generated with the texts available in Jaguar site.  If there
are any errors, post the corrections to the list.

Hope this will be useful for your study. Some of the verses are
very complicated. For instance 13-2, shankara's commentary runs
many pages. We will wait till Vidya takes that up for discussion
on the list.

 Selected Verses from Bhagavadgiita by bhagavAn shrI ramaNa
mahaR^ishi (with meaning by Shri Ramanand Prasad)


1. sa.njaya uvaacha:
ta.n tathaa kR^ipayaavishhTamashrupuurNaakulekshaNam.h |
vishhiidantamida.n vaak{}yamuvaacha madhusuudanaH  || 2.01 ||

Sanjaya said: Lord Krishna spoke these words to Arjuna whose eyes
were tearful and downcast, and who was overwhelmed with compassion
and despair.


2. shriibhagavaanuvaacha:
idaM shariiraM kaunteya kshetramityabhidhiiyate |
etadyo vetti taM praahuH kshetraGYa iti tadvidaH || 13.1 ||

The Supreme Lord said: O Arjuna, this body (the miniature universe)
may be called the field or creation. One who knows the creation is
called the creator by the seers of truth.


3. kshetraGYa.n chaapi maaM viddhi sarvakshetreshhu bhaarata |
kshetrakshetraGYayorGYaanaM yattajGYaanaM mataM mama || 13.2 ||

Know Me to be the creator of all creation, O Arjuna. The true
understanding of both the creator and the creation is considered by
Me to be the transcendental or metaphysical knowledge.


4. ahamaatmaa guDaakesha sarvabhuutaashayasthitaH |
ahamaadishcha madhya.n cha bhuutaanaamanta eva cha || 10.20 ||

O Arjuna, I am the Atma abiding in the heart of all beings. I am
also the beginning, the middle, and the end of all beings.


5. jaatasya hi dhruvo mR^ityurdhruva.n janma mR^itasya cha |
tasmaadaparihaarye.arthe na tva.n shochitumarhasi || 2.27||

Because, death is certain for the one who is born, and birth is
certain for the one who dies. Therefore, you should not lament over
the inevitable.


6. na jaayate mriyate vaa kadaachin.h
        naayaM bhuutvaa bhavitaa vaa na bhuuyaH |
ajo nityaH shaashvato.ayaM puraaNo
        na hanyate hanyamaane shariire || 2.20||

The Atma is neither born nor does it die at any time, nor having
been it will cease to exist again. It is unborn, eternal,
permanent, and primeval. The Atma is not destroyed when the body is
destroyed.


7. ach{}chhedyo.ayamadaahyo.ayamak{}ledyo.ashoshhya eva cha |
nityaH sarvagataH sthaaNurachalo.aya.n sanaatanaH || 2.24 ||
This Atma cannot be cut, burned, wetted, or dried up. It is
eternal, all pervading, unchanging, immovable, and primeval.


8. avinaashi tu tadviddhi yena sarvamida.n tatam.h |
vinaashamavyayasyaasya na kashchitkartumarhati || 2.17 ||

Know That, by which all this (universe) is pervaded, to be
indestructible. No one can destroy the indestructible (Atma).


9. naasato vidyate bhaavo naabhaavo vidyate sataH |
ubhayorapi dR^ishhTo.antastvanayostattvadarshibhiH || 2.16 ||

There is no nonexistence of the Sat (or Atma) and no existence of
the Asat. The reality of these two is indeed certainly seen by the
seers of truth.

Sat exists at all times-past, present, and future. Atma is called
Sat. Asat is a notion that does not exist at all (like the horn of
a rabbit, or the water in a mirage). The one that has a beginning
and an end is neither Sat nor Asat. The body is neither Sat nor
Asat, or both Sat and Asat, because, it has a temporary existence.
Mithya is the one that appears Sat at first sight, but is really
Asat. Body, like the universe or Jagat, is called Mithya.


10. yathaa sarvagataM saukshmyaadaakaashaM nopalipyate |
sarvatraavasthito dehe tathaatmaa nopalipyate || 13.32 ||

As the all-pervading ether is not tainted because of its subtlety,
similarly the Self, seated in everybody, is not tainted.

yadgatvaa na nivarta.nte taddhaama paramaM mama || 15.6 ||

yaM praapya na nivartante taddhaama paramaM mama || 8.21 ||

return (or take rebirth).

        gach{}chhantyamuuDhaaH padamavyayaM tat.h || 15.5 ||

Those who are free from pride and delusion, who have conquered the
evil of attachment, who are constantly dwelling in the Supreme Self
with all Kaama completely stilled, who are free from the dualities
known as pleasure and pain; such undeluded persons reach the
eternal goal.


14. yaH shaastravidhimutsR^ijya vartate kaamakaarataH |
na sa siddhimavaap{}noti na sukhaM na paraaM gatim.h || 16.23 ||

scriptural injunctions, neither attains perfection nor happiness

shraddhaamayo.ayaM purushho yo yach{}chhraddhaH sa eva saH || 17.3 ||

beauty of objects of the world).


22. indriyaaNi paraaNyaahurindriyebhyaH paraM manaH |
manasastu paraa buddhiryo buddheH paratastu saH || 3.42 ||

The senses are said to be superior (to matter or the body), the
mind is superior to the senses, the intellect is superior to the

jahi shatruM mahaabaaho kaamaruupaM duraasadam.h || 3.43 ||

Thus, knowing the Atma to be superior to the intellect, and
