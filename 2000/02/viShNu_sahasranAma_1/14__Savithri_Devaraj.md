14.  puruShaH : One who abides in the body or pura.

MahAbhArata (shanti 21.37) says :

navadvAraM puraM puNyaM etair bhAvaiH samanvitaM
vyApya sete mahAtmA yaH tasmAt puruSha uchyate.

-"The great being resides in and pervades the mansion of the body,
having all the features described before and provided with nine
gateways; because of this He is called puruSha." Or, by interpreting the
word as purA Asit, the word can be given the meaning of  'one who
existed always'. Or it can mean one who is pUrNa, a perfect; Or one who
makes all things pUrita i.e., filled by pervading them.

The MahAbhArata (Udyoga 7.11) says: "PUraNAt sadanAt chaiva tato.asau
puruShottamaH - He is called puruShottama, because he infills everything
and sustains them all."

15. sAxi : One who witnesses everything, without any aid or instruments,
by virtue of his inherent nature alone.
