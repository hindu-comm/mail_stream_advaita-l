Oh! Lord, when ferocious messengers of Death-God come to torture me
angrily shouting, ``Burn him, Kill him'' Oh! Lord Thou must hasten to
appear before me, riding on Peacock, carrying Shaktivel, to encourage
me not to be afraid.

  Prayer for Protection During Last Moments

  Oh Merciful Lord!  I am prostating to Thy feet often to secure Thy
blessings. Oh treasure house of mercy! I offer prayers to please
Thee. Thou should not be indifferent towards me during my last
moments.  At that time I may not have the control and energy to pray
to Thee!

  Prayer to Drive Away Mental Worries

O Lord! Thous hast slain the demon Soora who ruled the thousand
universes! So were the demons Taarakasura and Simhavaktra.  But Lord,
why have you not killed the demon called mental worry which haunts my
mind? When it is afflicting me, what will I do? and where will I go
[other than you for help]?

  Prayer to Destroy Mental Worries

Oh Son of Uma! I am always troubled by the mental worries. Thou art
the friend of helpless! I approach none but you for saving me. Quickly
destroy my mental worries as they interfere with my devotion towards
Thee!

  Glory of Lord's Holy Ash

Oh Conqueror of Taraka!  Severe epilepsy, leprosy, consumption, lung
diseases, venreal diseases, fevers, mental diseases of all types, they
run away the moment when your devotee applies your sacred vibhuti.
