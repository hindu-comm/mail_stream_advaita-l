   namo babhlushAya vivyAdhine .annAnAM pataye namaH |

  Salutations to Him who rides the Bull (babhlushAya), Him who pierces
  the enemies (vivyAdhine) and Him who is the Lord (pataye) of foods
  (annAnAm.h).


  sAyaNAchArya's commentary:
  --------------------------

  bibharti rudramiti babhrurvR^ishhabhaH  sa eva babhlU
  raLayorbhedAbhAvaH | tasmin.h shete tishhThatIti babhlushaH
  sa cha vidveshhiNAM visheshheNa vidhyatIti vivyAdhI
  tathAvidhAya vivyAdhine namo .astu | yashcha-annAnAM pAlako
  rudrastasmai namo .astu |


  He who bears Rudra is "babhru", the bull (vR^ishhabha, nandI).
  (That bull) is "babhlU" only because there is no difference
  between "ra" and "La" here. He who rests or rides on that (babhlU)
  is called "babhlusha". He also pierces or  excellently destroys the
  enemies, those who hate. Salutations to such a Rudra who is vivyAdhI
  (and babhlusha). And may salutations be to Him who is the Lord of foods,
  the Guardian of foods.

 Note:

  The epithet "annAnAM pataye namaH" (Lord of foods) reminds one of
  ManjunAtheshvara of the place of pilgrimage called Dharmasthala in
  Karnataka. This is a wonderful place because the temple of Shiva,
  who is called ManjunAtha, has Vaishnava priests and is run by a Heggade,
  a Jain by birth! Here everyone, regardless of caste or any other factor,
  gets free meals and lodging. Lord ManjunAtha is called "anna-dAtA" or
  "giver of food" because He turns away no one who is hungry.

Dear Vaidya Sundaram,

Hereby I'd like to introduce myself and my interest in Advaita-Vedanta.

I'm a male, age 48, with wife and two sons of 19 and 21, living in Lelystad
in the middle of the Netherlands.
At the age of 27 I came into contact with advaita-vedanta by "the school of
philosophy" in Amsterdam. Since then I read a lot books and attended a
philosophy-group. Nowadays I lead a small philosophy-group in Lelystad which
meditates with a mantra, as given by the late ShrI Shankaracharya
ShantAnanda Sarasvati. I consider myself as a follower of this
Shcankaracharya. The group studies his conversations with the late mr.Leon
McLaren from England and books of Gurdjieff/Ouspensky.

I also learned some Sanskrita and I was succesfully in an official
Sanskrita-exam for secondary schoolchildren in London (some years ago).

In 1981, with a group in Amsterdam we founded a primary school, based on the
principles of Plato and Advaita. So my two sons are brought up with
philosophy from their first days in life. They both meditate and read books
on the advaita subject.

Nowadays I also publish books on advaita subjects. This is not profitable,
but it helps to spread the message, which I think is very useful.

Last year I was in India. In Allahabad and Varanasi I visited the ashrams of
Shankaracharya Vasudevananda Sarasvati.

Respectfully yours,

Rob van Dijk.
