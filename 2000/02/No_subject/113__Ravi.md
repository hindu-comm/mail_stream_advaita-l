Dear Members,

namaste.

I am sorry for cc_ing a personal mail to the whole list. It was
unintential, I have set my Reply-To to reply to all as default,
that caused the error. I should have checked the header. Anyway
the context of the mail is "jaDa bharata",

Thanks.

Sincerely,
Ravi

Dear Sister,

namaste

By mistake while trying to forward your mail to Kartik (Sankar
Jayanarayanan), I lost the mail. I think your summary
highlighting important points is very nice.

I would request you to post it to the list itself. So that
everyone can benefit from it.  Kartik's e-mail address is

kartik at ECE.UTEXAS.EDU

Thank you.

With respects,
Ravi
