Isn't this the Maaya which has engulfed all of us ? - the aavarana
shakthi of the maaya which hides the Truth and the vikshepa shakthi
which manifests itself  as  totally different thing  which makes us
believe we really are !

I am also reminded of Shankara's " Vishwam darpana drishyamaana nagarii
tulyam nijaantargatam ". We truly are 'Lion Kings', but imagine
ourselves to be 'poor cats'  !

Quite a thought provoking picture !
Thanks,
Hari Om,
Latha
