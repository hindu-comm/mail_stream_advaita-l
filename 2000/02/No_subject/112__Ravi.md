Dear Sister,

namaste

By mistake while trying to forward your mail to Kartik (Sankar
Jayanarayanan), I lost the mail. I think your summary
highlighting important points is very nice.

I would request you to post it to the list itself. So that
everyone can benefit from it.  Kartik's e-mail address is

kartik at ECE.UTEXAS.EDU

Thank you.

With respects,
Ravi
