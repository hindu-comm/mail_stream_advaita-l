 My congratulations to Vidya too. I agree a book introducing advaita-
 vedAnta with emphasis on the "vedAnta" aspect of advaita has become
 necessary in modern times. On the one hand we have other schools of
 VedAnta coming out with literature that claims that "Shankara's
 philosophy is not faithful to the VedAnta sUtras." And the so-called
 neo-advaita schools seem to talk  little of vedAnta! So a good
 book on advaita-vedAnta would educate people and more importantly
 remove misconceptions about vedAnta.
