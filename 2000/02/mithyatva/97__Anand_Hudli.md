 The very basic tenets of advaita are nicely captured in this verse
 from the VedAnta-DiNDima:

  brahma satyaM jaganmithyA jIvo brahmaiva nAparaH |
  jIvanmuktastu tadvidvAn.h iti vedAnta-DiNDimaH   ||

 Brahman is real, the world is unreal, and the jIva is Brahman alone,
 not anything else. And one who knows this is a jIvanmukta (liberated
 while living).
 **This is the proclamation (literally drum-beat) of VedAnta.**

 The words "iti vedAnta-DiNDImaH", the proclamation of VedAnta, are
 very important here. Whatever tenet of advaita there is, it *has* to
 follow from VedAnta.

 Accepting the Brahman as satya and the world as mithyA are NEITHER
 based on logic alone NOR on faith alone. They are proclaimed loudly
 by numerous shruti texts. Now, when we accept shruti texts coming
 from a Guru, there is a certain amount of faith involved. But it is
 not just faith alone. We have to convince ourselves that what we are
 accepting on faith is NOT illogical or absurd. There is thus a need
 for some inquiry into what we accept on faith. At the same time,
 we have to be careful not to carry logic too far so that it
 challenges the validity of shruti. This would be resorting to "kutarka"
 or bad logic. And the reason why logic has to yield to shruti is
 because in matters concerning Brahman (and dharma as well) the shruti
 is the highest authority. So using logic so that we arrive at conclusions
 in accordance with shruti is to be encouraged while using logic to arrive
 at conclusions opposed to shruti is a waste of time, at best.

 As per shruti texts such as "neha nAnAsti kiJNchana", any manifold-
 ness or variety is being denied reality. And this manifold-ness is
 exactly mithyA. No amount of logic can negate what the shruti says
 just as even a hundred shruti statements cannot make a fire cold.
 Each pramANa, be it inference, perception, or shruti, has its own
 sphere where it dominates over other pramANas. Just as no amount
 of logical inference can make us accept fire as being cold, and we
 accept perception in this case, we have to accept the shruti when
 it denies reality to manifoldness.

 It could be taken as based on faith but that is not where the shruti
 wants us to stop. We should make sure what we accept from the shruti
 is inquired into and contemplated upon. After all, the upanishhad says:
 "AtmA vA are drashhTavyaH shrotavyo mantavyo nididhyAsitavyo" and
"Atmano vA are darshanena shravaNena matyA viGYAnenedaM sarvaM viditam.h"
