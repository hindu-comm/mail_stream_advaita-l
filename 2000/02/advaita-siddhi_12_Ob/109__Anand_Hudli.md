 It depends on how you define Time and Event. If Time is defined
 as a scheme of measure for the drama of "sR^ishhTi-sthiti-laya" (creation,
 preservation or existence, and destruction), then certainly such a
 measure does not exist. For example, such time may be expressed in
 seconds, minutes, hours, etc. And an event  occurs in an interval of Time.
 But if you equate Time to the substratum of everything, all events,
 etc., and same as "Being" then yes, Time exists. It is just another name
 for Brahman!

 No, what we are doing is examining the mere  plausibility of
 the non-dream (turIya) state while being in the dream state. If
 there is an objection to the effect that such a non-dream and non-dual
 state is logically impossible, we have to show the plausibility of
 such a state. Certainly, we cannot assert the such a state can be
 proved in purely argumentative fashion. The shruti assures us (mANDUkya
 upanishhad, for example) assures that such a state exists.
