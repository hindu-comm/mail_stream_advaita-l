I have a doubt here. When he wakes up - he wakes up to the reality of
Ekamevaadvitiiyam, isn't it ? In that state of  Brahman , who is there to
agree or disagree the fact that he had dreamt ? Is it not us the ajnaanis who
are talking this from the perspective of our ajnaana ?

It is once again we who are talking, not the Jnaani. He is talking in our
ajnaana.
