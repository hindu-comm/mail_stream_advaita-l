I have an earnest question, It may be stupid,
In turIya state even time vanishes and there is no sense of I. That is
brahmAnubhUti. Fine.
But while defining Ishwara he is defined as some one who exist in such a
state beyond time as well as one who takes care of the world bound by time
and space which is a cause of his own mAyA or swAvidyA.
mAyAvIti vijrumbhayati api mahA yogIva yasvechayA
A jIvan does not become a sAkshi to say that he was in a state of dream as
he goes beyond that, but even in that state of a jIvan does not a Ishwara
exist who exist as a sAkshi to this mAyAmaya jagat as a satvaguNopAdi. That
leads to a conclusion of two realities, atleast until jagatvApAra is over
and all jIvans are liberated.
