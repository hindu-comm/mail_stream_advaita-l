Yes, since Brahman is changeless, and the concept of time can only exist
when there is *some* change in the universe. I have heard the objection
that in order to know that an object is unchanging, one needs to measure
its properties at a certain time, compare it with a "future" measurement,
and then note that the object has remained unchanged for that time. So the
argument goes, "Even to know that Brahman is unchanging, there must exist
the nconcept of time."

But the objection to that is obvious: for the measurement of time, one
uses a clock, and notes the changes in the clock (or one may simply
observe the change in one's own mental states) -- time cannot be measured
without change *somewhere*. At the PA. level, there is no change
whatsoever in the universe (which is Brahman alone), and hence no way to
actually "measure time."

Anyway, that was my two cents.

PS: I was only waiting for someone else to start the discussion since I
thought the opponent had a solid case :-) Thanks to Ravi (and madhusUdana)
for leading the way.
