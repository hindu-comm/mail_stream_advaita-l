 Is it being suggested that Shaivism is intrinsically or historically
 advaitic and that Vaishnava bhakti is similarly dvaitic? If so, then
 how can we explain the existence of advaitic forms of bhagavatism
 introduced by the saints of Maharashtra, beginning with Sant Jnaneshwar?
 And how can we explain the existence of both dvaitic and
 vishishhTa-advaitic (Veera-shaiva) schools of Shaivism in Southern India?
