Everything in this world is in relation to YOU. If you as an individual exist , so will all the jivas and Iswara. They are as real as you consider yourself to be. When you as an individual cease to exist , the primal cause alone remains. Then there are neither Jivas nor Iswara.
However , a person who comes back from this state to the world (An Adhikara Purusha) perceives no difference between the two states. In one state everything is potential. In the other there is manifestation of the potential. This continuity of experience is that Iswara is both beyond the triad of time space causation and the cause too.

Om,
         Anand
