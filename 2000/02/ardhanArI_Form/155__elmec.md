Hari Om,

I remember to have read in some periodical that even the body of
Dakshinaamurthy represents both the male and female aspects of this
creation. The only visible charecteristic which I notice in this form is
the
ear rings - the left part which is Shakthi wears a kundala while the
right
which represents Shiva wears a snake.

This month's Vedanta Vaani of Chinmaya mission has an article on
Ardhanaariishwara which is very interesting and informative. The point
which
struck me was that Shiva reps the knowledge while Shakthi reps the
action.
Action is always preceeded by knowledge and if there is no knowledge,
there
would not be any action also. ( the jnaana shakthi and the kriyaa
shakthi, I
think ) .Lot of other beautiful analysis are made in this article.
Interested persons may go through it.

Regards,
Latha vidyaranya
