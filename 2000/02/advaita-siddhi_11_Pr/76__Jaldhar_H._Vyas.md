Swami Madhusudan Sarasvati was Bengali and Bengal was the seat of
learning in Nyaya at that time so he was probably intimately familiar with
Navya-nyaya

The monumental work of Gangesh Upadhyaya Tattva Chintamani not only
revolutionized the Nyaya school but all other branches of the shastras
too including Advaita, Dvaita, Purva Mimamsa, Dharmashastra and
Kavyashastra.
