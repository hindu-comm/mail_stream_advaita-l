Hari Om,

Something went wrong with my computer all of a sudden and I went out of
Net for nearly 10 days. Sorry for becoming incommunicado for so long.
Today
I have downloaded nearly 45 letters and please give me some time to read
them all and present my comments , if any. Please do not mind my delayed
reactions ! My comment upon Ravi's picture must have reached you all
just now and you must all be wondering whether I was sleeping over the
pic all these days !

Regards,
Latha Vidyaranya
