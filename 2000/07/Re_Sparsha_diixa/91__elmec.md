Hari Om,

It was truly amazing to read Sri Swaminarayan's message on the above
subject wherein he has described the diixa that was given to his father
by his Guru Sri Babaji ! Such powerful diixa with instant enlightenment
to shishya ! Blessed is that shishya and blessed are you, Sri
Swaminarayan, to be his son. And you say that you have had the good
fortune of listening to his discourses !

I was truly touched by the reverence that the Swamiji had  for the River
Narmada. The Bhakthi and Shradhdha that he had for the river and did its
parikrama must have fetched him the Grace of the River Godess and made
him realise the Truth ! May Lord bless us all with such unflinching
Faith in Him and in our Gurus !

My salutations to Sri Narmade Har babaji.

Regards,
Latha Vidyaranya
