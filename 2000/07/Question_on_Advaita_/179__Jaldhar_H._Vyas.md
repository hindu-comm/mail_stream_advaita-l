first I shall address Vishals' comments:

Nevertheless it does not operate in a cultural vacuum.  Advaita Vedanta is
part of the broader religious/cultural/philosophical group pf ideas known
as Smarta (loosely translated as "traditional") sampradaya.  The leaders
and thinkers of Advaita Vedanta draw themselves from and speak to Smartas.

Smartas do have definite views on the relationships of men and women.

_All_ acharyas agree on this.  Remember Shankaracharya is not out to offer
his own opinions but only to explain the already existent Vedic Dharma.

So there you go.  In this case the only way to maintain the charge of a
negative view towards women is if you think the Itihasa-Puranas are
inferior to the Vedas in which case I would have to ask why?

You have not proven that Shankaracharyas' commentaries make any
disparaging remarks either.

I'm with you so far.

Taken literally the original is far worse.

pApayonayah striyovaiSAstathASudrAs

But it is not to be taken literally. That's where context comes
in.  Shankaracharya is quite justified in filling in the blanks by
explaining that despite their inability to engage in Vedic study, women
Vaishyas and Shudras, are entitled to seek and capable of achieving
moksha.  If anything, this explanation says that ability or otherwise to
study the Vedas, can _not_ be a factor in the pursuit of Moksha.

His time and at least 1500 years before that.  In fact is there any
historical evidence of there having been female Vedic scholars?

We can add several incident traditionally told about his life.

1.  He fulfilled the promise he made to his mother to perform her shraddha
even though he was a sannyasis.

2.  When an elderly woman wanted to give him alms but was too poor to do
so, he composed the Kanakadhara stotra which resulted in her being
showered with gold.

3.  During his debate with Mandana Mishra, he accepted Mishras' learned
wife Bharati as the judge.

????  The idea that the Vedas are the Samhitas alone is a modern invention
of the Arya Samaja.  No traditional sampradaya would agree with what
you've written above.  If anything the Brahmanas are _more_ authoritative
in these matters as they contain the injunctions and prohibitions (vidhi
and nishedha)

As for the names of some rshis being female, the Rshis are only the seers
of the mantras.  As far as karma is concerned they are just names attached
to the mantras.

This is also still the practice today.

Similiar words occur in the Paraskara grhyasutra which is the one I am
familiar with and the ritual guidebooks mention specific mantras.  But
this does not equal blanket permission to say any mantra.  Similarly in
the Shrautasutras at a couple of points the King of the Nishadhas and the
Rathakara (chariotmaker) are supposed to say certin things.  This does not
imply they can say any old thing.

Furthermore, those same Grhyasutras say a married man has to wear two
Janois (yajnopavits).  the reason is one is worn on the wifes behalf
because she is not entitled to wear it on her own.  The Janoi is the
symbol of the right to Vedic study.

First let us look at the previous adhikarana   The purvapaksha is that
anything that desires reward is entitled to sacrifice.  The siddhanta is
that desire is not enough, onw must also be capable of performing the
requirements.  So animals etc cannot sacrifice, neither can children, the
mentally or physically disabled etc.

The next adhikarana is the one you quoted.  What about women?  The
previous adhikarana does not apply because not only do women also desire
heaven, they have the mental and physical competance to do what is
necessary to achieve the goal.   The Rshi Etishayana objects that only the
male gender is used.  Maharshi Badarayana explains that it is used
generically to mean both male and female.  Another objection is that women
have no independent wealth just their husbands.  But Maharshi Jaimini
shows they are capable of owning wealth on their own and are thus capable
of financing a yajna (which entitles them to its reward.)

Now look at the next adhikarana.  It notes that after they are married,
there is no seperate wealth of husband and wife.  They own together
therefore their rituals should also be performed together.  _This_ is the
settled conclusion.  This is the practice up to the present day.  In any
yajna, the yajamana and his wife must sit together.  They make the
offering together, and he alone says the mantras.  This is why one word
for wife in Sanskrit is sahadharmacharini -- one who performs dharma
together with her husband.

They are accepted as canonical by Advaitins.

Note this is quoted in texts on shradhha and it means that if her father
dies, the obligation to perform shraddha passes to the daughter.  The
actual ceremony is performed by her husband or son.

All this proves is that a sahadharmacharini should sit with her husband
when he does his nityakarmas.  It doesn't mean they should do them herself.

Lastly I should mention that shishtachara is as weight an authority on
Dharma as Shruti and Smrti.  The shishtachara is that women do not learn
the Vedas or perform Vedic karma on their own and this has to carry great
weight for a Smarta.

Now to answer Dennis.

I would hope they are telling men to do those things too.

Only if you adopt a very narrow construction of Advaita.  As I mentioned
earlier, Advaitins are part of a larger culture of people with definite
ideas about human behavior.  Whether they expressed this in the same
context as their Advaitic philosophizing is a different issue.

"patriarchal", "egalitarian", "feminist", "anti-feminist", "gender" these
are all terms out of post-modern Western culture.  Why would a culture
thousands of years older conceptualize in that way?  It seems to me that
to answer your question, your research must be more sociological than
philosophical and in that case Advaita texts are the wrong place to look.

Yet the fact remains that it was that culture that came up with the lofty
notions of Advaita Vedanta.  There have been (and are) more egalitarian
religions in India but they didn't come up with Advaita Vedanta.

 I don't

I don't know why you object to it.  Your preference for "non-patriarchy"
is also cultural.

I don't know if your school adheres to Smarta norms at all but So far I
haven't heard anything about women actually being harmed in any way so I
have to wonder exactly what the problem is?
