Hello :
    Sorry to intrude on such an erudite discussion.  But,
I have a question and a statement in this subject.
Hopefully, my statement would not be taken as impertinent.

Question
--------
  What is the meaning and purpose of yajnopavita?
Is it a qualificand for vedic study or the ability to
perform yajnas?  Because, the word itself seems to indicate
the latter.

Statement
---------
  It is my view that compassion and consideration to others
is as important in spiritual practice as faith, humility
and learning.  In fact, this issue was discussed a long
time ago ( on vedAdkikAram and MokshAdhikAram ) and
ShrI Vidyashankar told us all to not even use a word like
MokshAdhikAram.  Because, it has no meaning.  Moksha is not
withheld from anyone.
  Whatever the notions of the past may have been, I think
it
should be re-evaluated in the present context ( especially
in India where "dowry deaths" and female infanticide are
still commonplace ).  Any tradition which condones such
reprehensible acts ( even couched in intellectual
sophistry ) is un-spiritual in my opinion.
  Men ( especially Indian ) have always subjected their
counterparts to exacting standards in faith, learning,
courage and culture.  And, the women have met and exceeded
such standards.  Personally, I only wish that I had a
fraction of my Grandmother's devotion.  I am very grateful
to Smt. Lata and Smt. Savitri for their wonderful
contributions to this list and to many more women on this
list.  I hope we would have more in the future who would
share their wisdom and learning.

-Vivek.
