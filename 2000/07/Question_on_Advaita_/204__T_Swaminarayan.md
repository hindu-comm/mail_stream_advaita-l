Dear all list members:


Come to seriously think of it, the woman was indeed
treated as a ' thing ' to be avoided and as capable of
distracting the mind of the ' mumukshu ' ( MAN in this
context ) and depriving him of  achieving his
cherished aim in his life to become enlightened.!!
1. Was not the woman looked upon as a domestic help in
running the household  of  Brahmins or running even
the gurukulams of ancient Rishis,  where ,the  Rishi
Patnis just fulfilled the duties of the house keepers?
2. Was it not basically 'partiality' on the part of
the great Acharyas that they always looked  for men
only to be their main deciples for the guru parampara
to continue?
3. How on earth could anyone with a sane and developed
mind and intellect view man and woman differently for
the pursuit  of Self Realisation?
4. I do not think that at any time or in any of his
upadeshas ,Shankara ever stated positively that '
Mumukshutva 'was for man only and that the woman
should not take up this quest for Brahma Vidya.. Do
any of you think so?
5. If the present various Acharyas and Mathadipathis
give up the subtle rejection of the woman into their
main stream of deciples, could not the samprayada of
male domination change its shade and the absurd
situation that has existed till date be corrected for
the remote future as well???

Hari Om !

Swaminarayan

        Yes, I believe it can change, and I ask all teachers to consider in their
hearts what ill effect would there be (and what great benefit to the world
there could be) if discouragement of female disciples were to cease now.  If
anyone seriously feels that there would be a negative effect of allowing
women the discipleship and study opportunities equal to that made available
to men, please advise the basis for same, i.e., why you think it would be a
mistake according to Advaita Vedanta wisdom.

Blessings to all!
