Dear Shri Agarwal,

Your posting on the role of women in Vedanta is very
well researched and I will have to read it a couple of
more times to appreciate, assimilate  and understand
the coverage.It is thoughtful of you to have posted
your response to the List.

Kindly expand i.b.i.d. please for me?

Swaminarayan.
