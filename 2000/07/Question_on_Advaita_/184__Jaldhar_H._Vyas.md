Your use of the word concession is interesting and exposes the real fault
line in interpretation of Advaita Vedanta.  Not orthodoxy versus
reform, tradition verses modernism, fundamentalist versus criticalist but
between those who view it as a self-contained set of ideas which just
happened to originate in a particular culture and those who see it as the
natural outgrowth of the concerns of that culture.  As you can guess, I
favor the second view.

We must remember that Kerala during the time of Shankaracharya and for
long before was one of the most cosmopolitan places in the world.  There
had been flourishing trade with the West (Roman coins have been discovered
there) and Arabia and Muslim traders were regular visitors before they
became conquerors.  The Christians had been established since one
generation after the death of Jesus.  Jews even prior to that.  And of
course many varieties of Hindus Buddhists and Jains existed.
Shankaracharya had ample opportunities to be "multicultural".  But he
wasn't.  We should ask why.

He was the one who thought women and Shudras shouldn't even study the Gita
etc.  But you'll not his school didn't survive.

Because they have been doing fine without it?

There should be a comma after Shudras. The Brahmabandhus are by
definition those who are entitled to learn the Vedas but do not understand
whether through ignorance or laziness.

This is a misstatement of the situation.  In the event of a discrepancy
between shruti and smrti, shruti takes precedence (and smrti trumps
shistachara in the same way.)  However where there is no conflict, all
three are _equally_ authoritative.  The Mimamsakas give the example of
Holi.  Even though it is not a Vedic utsava, it has existed since time
immemorial and thus is equally obligatory as any Vedic utsava.  In the
matter of stridharma if we accept that it is not mentioned much in the
Vedas it follows that the Smrti where it is mentioned is supremely
authoritative in that regard.

The mantras by and large do not include any injunctions or prohibitions so
are irrelevent to the investigation of dharma.

According to the calendar on my computer, today is 26th July 2000 so I
think our standards are as modern as anyones.  When I'm doing my sandhya
etc. in the morning, my wife is reciting a stotra called Datta Bavani, 52
shlokas to Dattatreya Bhagawana in Hindi.  Am I supposed to consider her
inferior because she is not using Sanskrit (which she knows well enough)
or reciting something Vedic?  Or my mother who is a trustee of a local
mandir and my first teach in spiritual matters just because she follows
Sai Baba and not Shankaracharya?  In fact there areso many ladies I know
whose behavior I want to emulate.  It would be a loss for dharma if they
were to copy me instead?  Why would they even want to?  It seems to me the
disparagement is mainly coming from those who feel that womens rites and
traditions are trivial or not good enough.  I don't share that view.

As a counter-example Shvetaketu complains to his father that he has
mastered the four Vedas, six Vedangas, Itihasa and Puranas and still does
not understand the supreme.

We need injunctions not stories to understand dharma.

Both the Mimamsa and Brahmasutras have a lot to say on this subject.  I'll
try and post something on it.

Neither is she a human woman.

However for men of the trivarnas, the Upanayana gives them a second birth
(which is why they are called dvija)

Nevertheless I accept your case for delinking.  I just want to point out
you are doing exactly what you accuse Shankaracharya of doing, reading
into the text something beyond the literal meaning.

By the same tack they do not say they can either.

Only if you accept them (and the Upanishad) as historical.  And there is
no particular reason to do so IMO.  What I meant by my question is do we
have any historical examples of women as Vedic scholars?  I don't think
you'll find more than a few anomalies but I'd like to know.

Exactly.  I don't think it goes against the traditional views to assume
the  Vedic revelation took place accross several generations.  But once
the Vedic canon was complete our sages did not distinguish between earlier
and later.

Possibly.  But they do not help in knowing how to act.

There is very little that is done "everywhere"  The point is this is
something Dharmic women do today and without feeling opressed by it.

See my earlier comment about the relationship between Shruti and Smrti.

Note that Maharshi Jaimini also discusses and endorses the rathakara
naishadhasthapati nyaya in his sutras shortly after the section you quoted
from the sixth adhyaya.

Sayanacharya did not comment on the Vajasaneyi Samhita. Uvatacharya and
Mahidharacharyas commentaries on this rka agree on the meaning.  That
speech is auspicious and will give all four castes their desires.  The
second half (which you didn't quote) goes on to say that by such speech
and with liberal gifts the Gods are pleased and will see that desires are
fulfilled.  While it is plausible that auspicious speech refers to the
Vedas it is is by no means the only interpretation.  Indeed
Mahidharacharya suggests kalyanim vacham is satya.  Speaking the truth is
pleasing to the Gods.

Again note there is no injunction or prohibition in this text so it is
irrelevant for determining Dharma.

In this case the use of the past tense in the Smrti indicates it is no
longer a viable option.  The smrti is only noting it not prescribing it as
a norm.

Unfortunately I do not.  But I do have the Valmiki Ramayana so I'll look
into that one.

In the event of a conflict.  Otherwise they are equal.

The basis is negative.  Because the Vedic texts give the vidhi for
Upanayana for a Brahmana (boy), and then the modifications for a
Kshatriya and Vaishya, it follows that any group not enumerated therein
is not entitled to perform it.  As Upanayana is a prerequisite for Vedic
study, it follows that those who are ineligible for it are ineligible for
the study too.

And you have a right to your opinion.  But Dennis was asking for the
views of Advaita Vedanta and it should be clear that the Advaita acharyas
are closer to my opinion than yours.

Shankaracharya did not just grudgingly accept Smarta norms as a necessary
evil.  He encouraged his followers to adhere to themin toto and his
sucessors still do.
