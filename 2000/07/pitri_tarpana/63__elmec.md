Thank you, Sri Vaidya Sundaram, for the additional information. I really
did
not know that tarpana is offered to forefathers even by those whose
parents
are alive ! Here I would like to add that during amavasya day of every
month
also pitri tarpana is offered and at that time the person can offer
tarpana to
any known person who has passed away ( irrespective of your relation
with
him/her ) if you know that he/she is issueless or if you know that no
one else
in the family is offering tarpana to that person. Offering tarpana to
such a
pitri is highly meritorious.

Regards,
Latha Vidyaranya
