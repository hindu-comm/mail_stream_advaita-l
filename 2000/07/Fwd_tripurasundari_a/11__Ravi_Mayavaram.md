I am attaching herewith the "tripurasundari aShTakam.h"
with simple line by line meaning.  Earlier, I have submitted
the stotram (without any translation) to this group,
and it resides in the ambaa-l webpage.  It had some minor typos,
so please substitute this posting in that place.

Introduction:

"tripurasundari aShTakaM" is an octal  hymn , praising
Goddess tripurasundari, composed by Adi shaMkara, in a group
of eight shlokaMs, all set in prithvi metre consisting
of 17 syllables to each line, with a yati (pause) at
syllable 8 and 17. (Note that the hymn, Saundaryalahari,
also has 17 letters to each line, but the poetic
metre there is shikhariNi, which is entirely different).

The feminine noun "tripurasundari" means  beauty `par excellence',
in the triad (tripura). The word "tripura" can be interpreted
in several ways.  First, The kALlikA purANaM states that
by the will of the pradhAna (the First Principle), the
body of shiva became triple: the upper part became brahma, the middle,
vishNu, and the lower, rudra, As these three  "pura"s (bodies) are in
Him, shiva is called tripura, and his spouse is tripurA
In this context, it is interesting to note the following.
In Andhra Pradesh, about 20 kilomnetres from Kalahasthi, there is
a small shiva shrine and liN^gaM, at Gudimallam. It is believed this
shiva liN^ghaM was installed by parasurAma.  The lower part bears the
form
of a gAndharva, the middle part, that of parasurAma with a turban, and
the upper part, that of shiva liN^gaM.  Under a curse, once brahma
became a gAndharwa, by name CitrasEna. Therefore, the lower part
could be brahma, and the middle one vishNu, since parasurama is
an avatAraM of vishNu.  This fact is mentioned in the Tamil
book: "Jagadguruvin Upadeshangal" (Appendix, page 23, 1957).

tripura has another meaning: The dEvi's mantra consists of three
syllables; the paJNchadashaakshari mantraM is composed of three
peaks (kUTa), namely vAgbhatakUTa, kAmarAja kUTa, and
shakta kUTa. The nADis (nerves currents) where she resides are three:
sushumna, piN^gaLa, and ida). Her shaktis are three, ichcha, kriya, and

GYAna.  Now, to the actual hymn:

kadamba forest stands for the universe which devi permeates.
