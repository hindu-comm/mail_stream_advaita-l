Is this the same as Mannargudi Raju Sastri, the descendant of Appayya
Dikshita? If so, my understanding is that the vilAsa is only on the sadvidyA
section, not on the entire upanishad.

There is a 1989 publication from this organization, that is titled Samaveda:
Hindi artha va spashtikarana sahita, by Damodara Satavalekar. I suppose the
upanishad commentary in Hindi is included in this publication. LC call
number: BL1114.22 .H56 1989b Hind.

Best wishes,
Vidyasankar
