Excellent compilation. It's characteristic of the thorough scholarship
I have come to expect from Vishals posts. Another thing you might want
to add is 3rd, 4th and 5th chapters of Swami Vidyaranya's
anubhUTiprakAsha. It's not strictly a commentary, though. The chapters
are called shvetaketuvidyA-prakAsha, sanatkumAravidyA-prakAsha and
prajApatividyA-prakAsha. Pl. see Godabarisha Mishra's critical edition
published by the Univ of Madras.
