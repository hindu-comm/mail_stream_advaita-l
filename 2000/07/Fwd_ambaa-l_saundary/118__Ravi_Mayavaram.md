The jIva with kunDalinI in the astral body and the shiva-shakti in
the shrIcakra are identical and have exact counterparts. They are
given below. [I am guilty of jumping slightly ahead in terms of
shrIcakra. Full description of the shrIcakra will be presented as
part of verse 11].


jIva-kunDalinI                          shiva-shakti in shrIcakra

jIva without name and form and          bindu representing shiva
    bereft of mAyA
mUlAdhAra                               trikoNa
maNipUra                                antardashAra
svAdhiShThAna                           aShTakoNa
anAhata                                 bahirdashAra
vishuddha                               caturdashAra
AjnA                                    catuShkoNa bhUgR^iha
sahasrAra                               inner shrIcakra - the bindu



To summarize this pivotal verse in the stotra of saundaryalaharI,
the awakened kunDalinI touches each of these cakra-s, rises up and
unites with shiva in the sahasrAra. As the kunDalinI touches up each
of these lotuses, they blossom, revealing before the jIva a totally
new and more subtle reality. SAdhakA's view of the world changes as
the kunDalinI rises up. We will take up the visions in the latter
verses, particularly verses 36 to 41.
