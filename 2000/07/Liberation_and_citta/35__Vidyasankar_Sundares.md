Yes, the argument about citta vRtti nirodha is itself a response
to Sankara's statement about the recollection of Self-knowledge
vis-a-vis knowledge of the not-Self.

In this context, Suresvara's statements are also very pertinent.
In the vArtika on the above text, he writes, Atma-smRtes svataH
prAptiH....., pratyag-jnAne nirudhyante citta-tad-vRttayo yataH |
abhyupetya etad asmAbhir ucyate....., vidher daurbalya siddhyartham
ato bhAshyakRd uktavAn - verses 847, 850, 931 in vArtika on BU 1.4.7.

The general sense is that the niyama vidhi interpretation, or
equivalently, a parisaMkhyA vidhi interpretation, is not made as a
forceful argument. Inasmuch as Atma-smRti is to be had naturally
(svataH), the scripture does not intend to enjoin it strictly.
Nevertheless, the uses of such smRti, for the purposes of driving
away Soka and moha, and for checking the pravRtii of vAk, manas
and kAya, are acknowledged.

In naishkarmyasiddhi, he writes,

niyamaH parisaMkhyA vA vidhy artho 'pi bhaved yataH |
anAtmAdarSanenaiva parAtmAnam upAsmahe || 1. 88 ||

Yes, this positive counterpart is always emphasized. See also
gItA 6. 3, which Suresvara quotes both in the vArtika and in
naishkarmyasiddhi - Arurukshor muner yogaM karma kAraNam ucyate,
yogArUDhasya tasyaiva SamaH kAraNam ucyate. Of course, the
bhAshya on this verse is also essential reading to understand
the advaita approach to yoga.

Everything fits in neatly, doesn't it?!! That is the beauty of
Sankara's interpretation.

Well, we have our resident Vicar of Wakefield to thank for
bringing it up, albeit tangentially.

Yes, this should have been understood early on, but perhaps we
are expecting our paNDitaMmanya-s to understand advaita-siddhi!!

Since the entire discussion, even in the passage on citta vRtti
nirodha, revolves around the veda-vAkya-janita-Atma-vijnAna.
vAkyavRtti takes up the issue of the exegesis of the vAkyas. As
you say, the positive counterpart is simply a practical necessity.
