Tiny quibble: insert "tat" - AtmaviGYAnatatsmR^itisantAna - knowledge
of the Self and the continuous flow of memory thereof.

What has been stated/admitted?  Is this referring to an earlier
point that knowledge does not initiate (mental) activity?

So the nature of it is not to "do" something (such as restrain
the mind), but a caution against "doing" (given the conflicting
natures of Self-knowledge and action).  This does imply that the
qualities, such as dispassion and renunciation, have previously
been so deeply ingrained in the aspirant's nature, that they can
be employed here passively as it were -- without the "doing"!
Tough call.
