 sAmAnya dharma is what is required of everyone regardless of the
 caste, sex and other factors. As the mitAxarA notes by the phrase
 "brAhmaNAdyachANDAlAnta", it is applicable to all from the brAhmaNas
 to the chANDAlas. This is the basic dharma that one has to follow as
 a human being. Following the varNAshrama dharma is dependent on this.
