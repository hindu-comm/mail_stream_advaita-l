Yes and that is why it is important to be well educated.  Otherwise it is
easy to be fooled by the first sharp character with flowery words who
comes along.

Shankaracharya also mentions in one place that even a person who knows all
shastras should be considered as a fool if he has no parampara.

This is the ideal situation and we are fortunate that even today there are
such Masters who walk among us.  But what if the situation is less than
ideal?  In that case one should not think the possibility of knowledge
is futile but instead try and prepare oneself by whatever means are
possible.

Looking at the life of Shankaracharya, we see one of his shishyas
Totakacharya accepted him immediately.  But Sureshwaracharya struggled
mightily and it was only after vigorous debate that he was won over to the
Advaita side.  The true Guru will cater to both types.  He will not falter
or be offended if asked questions.  Neither will he refuse his mercy to
those who approach hm with sincerity and a pure heart.

Well a Guru must practice as he preaches or else he is open to the charge
of hypocracy.  If we consider ourselves loyal shishyas of that Guru, we
should try and follow in his footsteps.

The problem comes as you say when peope merely ape a leader without
understanding why he does what he does.

The Adiguru Dakshinamurti Bhagawan is portrayed as teaching though
silence.  The truth is self-evident to those who are prepared to receive
it.  no flashy showmanship is necessary.
