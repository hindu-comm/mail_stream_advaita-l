Just a little note in addition to Shri Lataji's posting:

I have read the translation of Srimad Bhagavatam as published by Gita Press,
Gorakhpur (originally through their magazine Kalyana Kalpataru, in 1950's).
One has to be more inert than a stone to not fall in Love with "Vishnu"
after reading that rendering.
