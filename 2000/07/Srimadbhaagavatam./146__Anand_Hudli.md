One more thing I forgot to mention is that for those who are planning
to study/listen to the bhAgavata but do not have a lot of time, there
is a week during bhAdrapada designated especially for this purpose
called "bhAgavata-saptAha". This week starts from the ninth lunar day
of the bright half and ends on the full moon day. The significance of
the week, as some say, is that it was during this week that the King
Parixita listened to the marathon bhAgavata recital from shrI-shuka,
after the king had been cursed to die from snake bite.

So even if one does not read the bhAgavata everyday, the wise
recommend that some reading of the bhAgavata during the saptAha
should be done.

Anand
