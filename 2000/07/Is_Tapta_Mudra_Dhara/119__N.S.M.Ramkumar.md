Namaskaram,

In Madhva sampradya there is Tapta Mudra Dharana(a kind of baptism and which
also needs to be renewed atleast once in an year). Madhvas quote lots
Shruti,Smriti and Puranas in its support and also claim that who has not
undergone Mudra dharana is unfit to perform Shrouta/Smarta karmas.

On the otherhand, Smarthas say that this is not so.

What is the correct position on this? Is the Mudra Dharana Vaidika or
Avaidika? Can a smartha have Mudra Dharana? I want to be enlightened by
learned members of the group.

Regards,
Ramkumar
