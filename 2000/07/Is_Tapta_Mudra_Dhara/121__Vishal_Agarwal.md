Although allied to Shri Vaishnava Sampradaya myself, I must say that such
Tapta Mudra rites are based on untenable interpretations of words like
'ataptatanu' (in RV) etc. by Vedanta Deshika et al.

Sincerely,

Vishal

  I am unable to find evidence for the Tapta mudrA in the aitareya -
  brAhmaNa, AshvalAyana shrauta sUtras and AshvalAyana gR^ihya sUtras
  of the shAkala shAkhA of the R^ig Veda.

  I have heard that VAdirAja tIrtha has written about this in
  his yukti-mallikA. Perhaps we should hear what the mAdhvas have
  to say first in support of this practice of theirs.

  Remember, advaitins have been known by the saying "vyavahAre tu
  bhATTanayaH". In day-to-day matters advaitins should be indistinguishable
  from the bhATTa mImAMsakas, who as we know, take pride in being
  staunch followers of the ritual aspects of the Veda.  We have to
  examine the issue with this background.
