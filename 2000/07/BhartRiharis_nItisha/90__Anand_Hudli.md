The sun (from his very nature) makes the lotus bloom; the moon causes
the collection of kairava (the white lotus) flowers to bloom (at night);
the cloud showers rain even if it is not asked to do so by anybody;
(in the same way) the good apply themselves enthusiastically for the
benefit of others.

Saintly persons take the initiative in helping others with their
wisdom. All we have to do in order to benefit from them is to be in
their proximity! We will automatically be showered with gifts of
lasting value. That is why it is so important to cultivate the company
of such people, sAdhu-saN^ga.

Anand

I think I am being misunderstood here. My interpretation is not from this

Agreed.

It seems  you talking about different Mantras having different approaches.
My interpretation is a bit different, as indicated below. But I agree in
general.

Yes, that is my humble explanation also. Had he quoted from RigVeda, first he
would have to explain the quotes themsleves and each quote, instead of a
single mantra would have been complete sukta or a few of them!

That was a mistake. Or, possibly we have not understood  fully what
puurvamiimaa.msaka said.
An indication of that (giving them benefit of doubt) was indicated in my
posting no. 2

What I am trying to show is that if RigVeda is interpreted correctly, the
whole Samhita seems to be a basis for various versions of Indian
philosophies, based on the way human mind (at its various levels of
operation) works. Afterall, any philosophical system has to be refered to
human thinking.

With which I agree generally.

Thanks for the comments.
