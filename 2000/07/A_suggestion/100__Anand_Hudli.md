 If someone intends to do this, it is better that they
 encode the introduction plus the commentary on the first four sUtras.
 This much material, called the chatussUtrI is a "mini" sUtra bhAShya
 in itself since it contains much of Shankara's philosophy. And the
 panchapAdikA of PadmapAdAchArya is a commentary on just these first
 four sUtras, at least as we have it today.

I just saw Jaldhar's e-mail saying he will do this. Since he is scanning
the intro may be he can also scan and put up the commentary on the
first four sUtras as well, if resource consumption is not an
issue.  Thanks to Jaldhar.
