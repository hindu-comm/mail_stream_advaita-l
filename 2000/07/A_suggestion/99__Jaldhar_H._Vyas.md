I have the Bhamati (along with Kalpataru and Parimala) but not the
Vivarana so if someone could send me that I'd be grateful.

Resources are not a problem, but one concern I have is the type in the
edition I have is pretty small and may not scan well.  But I'll experiment
and call for help if I run into trouble. :-)
