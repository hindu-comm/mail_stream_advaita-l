Shrii subhanu saxenaji told me that he will write a series on the
adhyaasa  bhaashhyam. I will check with him about this.

It will be better if someone encodes it in ITRANS for Jaguar site and
we can keep a copy at our site.

I do not have access to a scanner or the text. If you probably send
them as a FAX to my Yahoo Free Fax account, I will get them as tiff
file which I can convert to gif/jpeg. I use this technique once in
while. Sometimes the quality is not good though. If none is willing to
scan it or type it, please fax those pages (bit enlarged) to 1 (801)
981-2459.
You can just try one page (first) to check the quality.


Thanks.

Ravi
