Hari Om,
Thanks to Sri Ravishankar for the presentation of the Soundarya
Lahari Verse 9. It is just amazing. I am yet to digest the whole
article.

Shri Ravi, can you please explain the meaning of the following
sentence ?

Every portion of the physical body
has its counterpart in the astral body, and both bodies (the physical
and the astral) are interdependent on the material plane.

Thanks in advance,
Regards,
Latha Vidyaranya
