  This is most interesting!  I remember reading about a
similar episode in the life of Swami Vivekananda.  In that,
ShrI Ramakrishna took Vivekananda to Samadhi by pressing
on the left side of his chest.  Is such a means of diksha
substantiated anywhere?  What is the significance of the
left side of ones chest?  Is that why the sacred thread is
also worn on the left shoulder passing the left side of
ones
chest?

Thanks in advance,

-Vivek.
