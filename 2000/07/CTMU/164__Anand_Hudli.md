 No, that is not correct. In the final analysis, advaita says that God
 is none other than the Self. And the Self does not have to be proved!
 No one doubts "Do I exist or not?". So God exists!

 If God is taken as different from the Self, then we run into the
 problem that you (mistakenly) attribute to advaita. The realistic
 schools have this problem with logically establishing God, but not
 advaita.

 Any logical proof must be based on some axioms. As long as one accepts
 those axioms and if the proof is valid, then one must accept the
 conclusion. But if one does not accept the axioms, we cannot
 convince  that person to accept the conclusion. This has to do
 with the distinction between a valid argument and a sound argument
 in philosophy. An argument can be valid but not necessarily sound!
 All that a valid argument means is: IF the premises are accepted
 to be true, THEN the conclusion of the argument logically follows.
 Given A -> B, and A, we conclude B. This is a valid argument.
 A sound argument is one that is valid AND is based on true premises.
 Given A -> B, and A, we conclude B. This conclusion is sound only if
 the rule A -> B and the statement A are both true.

 Now, any subjectivity of the "truth" of the premises makes a big
 difference. If one accepts the premises to be true and if the argument
 is valid, then one must necessarily accept the conclusion. However,
 if one manages to cast doubt on the premises, then the conclusion,
 though coming from a valid argument, is not necessarily true.

 It is interesting work indeed!
