Christopher Langan, supposedly America's smartest man, was once measured
to have an IQ of 195 (1 in 100 million), and he was profiled on TV where
he was measured for IQ again, and this time around it was shown to be
higher than can be measured.

Langan's relevance to this mailing list is that he claims to have
discovered a proof for the existence of God. Many points in his
philosophical theory (which he calls "CTMU", short for Cognition-Theoretic
Model of the Universe) are curiously close to advaita:

1) God = "Self-perceptual real universe"
2) Mind (i.e. the "cognitive syntax") = Reality

It's all the more intriguing since he claims to have "proven" the above
propositions using logic alone, in contrast to advaita which needs shruti
:-) He says that his CTMU theory has been circulating around for a long
time now with no one able to disprove it thus far.

His profile is at the URL:

An introduction to his philosophy is to be found here:

Just a curiosity :-)

Regards,

Kartik
