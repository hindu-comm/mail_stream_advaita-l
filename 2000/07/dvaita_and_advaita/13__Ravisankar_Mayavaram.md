By assigning dvaita to vyAvahArika and advaita to pArAmarthika you can
to some extent resolve it. Anand Hudli wrote in these lines long back
either here or SRV (or SRH). Please browse through the archives. Some
of the key names to look for are Anand Hudli, Vidyasankar Sundaresan,
Ramakrishnan Balasubramanian, Sadananda, and many others.

You will find many interesting articles by Vidya in bhakti-list
archives as well. You can browse bhakti-list (vishishhTaadvaita) at
http://www.egroups.com/messages/bhakti-list

There is also a  group devoted to dvaita. It is in
http://www.dvaita.org

Hope this helps. And welcome to the list.
