In an earlier post, I had listed the notable commentators of the Chhandogya
Upanishad. In this post, I list the commentators of the TU, primarily with
the help of the Catalogus Catalogorums. Most anonymous commentaries and
modern (post 1900 CE) works are left out and the list has been made as much
chronological as possible. In many cases, there is no data available on the
authors. Corrections are most welcome.

Taittiriya Upanisad
1.  Vrtti of Kaundinya: According to Taittiriya Kandanukramani and the
Grhyasutras of Apastamba, Baudhayana and Hiranykeshi, Kundin or Kaundinya
wrote a Vritti on the Taittiriya texts. The nature of this vritti is not
made clear, although a 'Kaundinya Kalpa' is mentioned in the Tantravarttika
of Kumarila Bhatta. Therefore, there is insufficient evidence to conclude
that Kaundinya indeed wrote a commentary on the Taittiriya Upanishad. The
Siksha text of Kaundinya on the Taittiriya Shakha however survives and has
been printed.
2.  Bhashya of Guhadeva: The explanation of Guhadeva on a mantra occurring
in the Taittiriya Aranyaka is quoted  in a commentary on Nirukta. Since the
Vedantin Shri Ramanujacharya recalls Guhadeva as his ideological predecessor
in his work 'Vedarthasangraha', it is often surmised that Guhadeva must have
authored a commentary on the Taittiriya Upanishad. However, the evidence is
clearly insufficient to warrant such a conclusion.
3.  Bhashya of Kapardiswamin: He is the famous author on numerous texts of
the Apastamba and Bharadvaja sub-schools of the Taittiriya Yajurveda.
Although Shri Ramanujacharya remembers him as his ideological predecessor.
However, he is not known to have written commentaries on any Upanishad or
even on the Apastamba Dharmasutra (which has the Vedanta like
Adhyatmapatala). His works do show however that he was a Vaishnava. Hence
Shri Ramanujacharya invoked his authority to demonstrate that followers of
Vedic religion can be Vaishnavas as well and therefore the Shri Vaishnava
doctrine is not unorthodox.
4.  Bhasya of Sri Shankaracharya: According to tradition, this was the first
Upanishad on which Shri Shankaracharya commented because he himself belonged
to the Taittiriya Shakha. The Bhashya starts with mangalacharna shlokas,
which is uncharacteristic of Shankaracharya's works. Perhaps, the tradition
is indeed true and Shankaracharya intended these shlokas to be construed as
the mangalacharana shlokas for all his works. In one of these shlokas, he
reverentially bows to his predecessors and states that he is following their
views in writing his commentary on the Upanishad. It is unclear however
which predecessor he is referring to.
5.  Varttika of Sri Suresvaracharya on Shankaracharya's commentary on the
Upanishad.
