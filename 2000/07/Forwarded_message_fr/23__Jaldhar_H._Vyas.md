Sorry for the delay in responding.  The last to weeks have been very busy

No there is only one kind of enlightenment.  However karma is like
motion.  If you are driving a car really fast and you suddenly hit the
brakes, it still continues moving for a bit because of its momentum.  In
the same way a Jnani has transcended the world of karma but the
consequences of his past actions will have some effect until they are used
up.  Hence the apparent diversity.
