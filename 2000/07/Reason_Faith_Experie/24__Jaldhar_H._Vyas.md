All definitions myopic.  A definition is a root axiom, the one thing that
cannot be proved by a theory unless you come up with some metatheory.  (In
which case how do you prove the axioms of the metatheory.  You come with a
meta-meta-theory...)

How is handed down knowledge any less of an experience?  When I read a
book I'm using my eyes.  When I hear some teacher I'm using my ears.  That
seems like a direct experience to me!

Vedanta is a body of knowledge just like capentry or computer science.
There is no "mystical" method of acquiring this knowledge, it is learned
just like any other.  True it is hard for many people to learn but
carpentry is hard for clumsy people and computer science is hard for
unintelligent people.
