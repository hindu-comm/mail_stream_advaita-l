I have seen some authors think other wise. The argument apparently is not
so straight forward that only when you can conceptualize and accept an all
powerful, all pervading conscious entity (God) full of benevolent
attributes, will you strive to realise it. In fact, aspiring to realise the
Brahman consciousness as you own self goes against the very grain of saying
that there is this "other" entity (God) who is to be known and realised ...
yet, H.H brings it up as an essential element in a sadaka so that he may be
considered fit for pursuing atmajNana - why?

 In as much the existence of other lokas matters to only one who is still
materialistic in his/her outlook, H.H brings it up!! Would it be His way of
ensuring that the sadhaka does not take it for granted that once the
"pursuit" of the Supreme Reality is begun he is "free to do as he sees fit"
and ensure that the sAdhaka does not abandon the foundation of the karma
kaandas's?
