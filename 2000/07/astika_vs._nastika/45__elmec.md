Hari Om,

When I say that I want to realise my true self which is all pervasive, the very
effort of mine to realise something shows that I am aware of my ajnaana and
that I want to know the truth. There has to be someone who shows me the way,
initially. It is then that I look up to God. When he shows me the path coming
down in the form of a Guru, and when I sincerely follow him, he leads me to the
ultimate when the Ishwara, Guru and self are realised to be one and the only
one . Till that Goal is realised I do need to believe in God and my Guru.

Yes, very true. Specially those who tread the jnaana maarga have excess of
"Aham" and feel they do not need the support of Bhakthi at all. But this jnaana
would be only "Shushka". Only when Jnaana is mixed with Bhakthi does it become
"Rasamaya". For this one needs to respect every aspect of the vedas.

Regards,
Latha Vidyaranya
