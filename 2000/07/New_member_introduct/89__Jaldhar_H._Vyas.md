Dear Sirs,

Thanks for including my name for the advaita list. I give a brief introduction
about myself. I am a 34 year old engineer. My family have been traditional
disciples of Sringeri Mutt. I have been a regular visitor to Sringeri and in
fact my Upanayanam took place at Sringeri in 1974. My exposure to advaita is
limited and am still a beginner. I have gone through some books. I came across
the advaita list in 1999 while browsing through the Sringeri Sarada Peetam site.
I have internet access at work. However while travelling (which is more these
days),  I do not access my mail.  I found this list to be very useful and feel
that I can learn more from all of you.

Regards

N. SRIDHAR
