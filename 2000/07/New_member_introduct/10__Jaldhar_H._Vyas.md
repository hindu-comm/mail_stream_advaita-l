Received your mail on the subject and have browsed the same.  I cannot lay
claim to any apriori knowledge of Advaita. However, i logged onto the site
out of curiosity to learn about the same. AdiShankara's teaching have
always fascinated me and sincerely hope that would get an opportunity to
learn the same through you all.

Thank you.

Ramesh
