I am sending a brief introduction about myself as a prerequisite to be
included in the advaita list. I am an Engineer based in Arlington, Texas.
I am currently working as an Engineering Manager in a company in
FortWorth, Texas. I am originally from Bangalore and have undergone few
years of training in chanting mantras during my college days. I would like
to understand the meaning behind these mantras and also learn more about
advaita philosophy. Hope to be actively involved in this list.
