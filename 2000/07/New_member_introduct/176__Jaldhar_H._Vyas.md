Namaskar:
I am 27 years, I experiment with science as a profession and wish to
broaden my thoughts and insight on this side of the knowledge base which
is hundreds of years old, has been tried and tested and address the larger
issues of life and existence. My grandfather, Shri Vedaranya Vidyavardhna
Shri G. Nagaraja Rao from Madras was a learned person and accorded that
title by the Kanchi Matt for his efforts to understand and make accessible
the work of the great Indian gurus. Although he is no more and I miss him
at this stage when I wish to comprehend more about their line of thought,
I feel a need to think in those lines. Although I have read, heard, feel
(all at a novice level?) about the advaita, I seek to know more about
their implications and meaning in everyday life. I wish to be able to
distinguish between jyana, bhakti and karma, their borders, roles and
significance in life. I am impressed by the knowledge and content in the
advaita home page and hope to make some progress myself and develop an
understanding of peoples thoughts and ideas on the subject of advaita by
following the discussions in this mailing list. As I understand, religion
and philosophy is much dependent on interpretation and its from getting to
know about a range of interpretations that we could progress to make a
refined judgement. It seems like these interpretations evolve/change with
time in history, i wonder if this is acceptable. The philosophy of
Shankara as such would be stationary and is, for all times, but in this
changing times its important to grasp the right interpretation. Best
regards, Surjit
