HYMN ON LORD NARAYANA
 (TRANSLATION BY SRI SWAMI KRISHNANANDA)

sahasra shIrshhaM devaM vishvaakshaM vishwashaMbhuvam.h |
vishvaM naaraayaNaM devaM aksharaM paramaM padam.h ||

 This universe is the Eternal Being (Narayana), the imperishable, the
supreme, the goal, multi-headed and multi-eyed (i.e.,omnipresent and
omniscient), the resplendent, the source of delight for the whole
universe.

vishvataH paramaannityaM vishvaM naaraayaNaM harim.h |
vishvaM eva idaM purushhaH tadvishvaM upajIvati ||

 This universe is the Supreme Being (Purusha) alone; hence it subsists
on That, the Eternal which transcends it (in every way), -the
omnipresent Absolute which destroys all sins.

patiM vishvasya aatmaa IshvaraM shaashvataM shivamachyutam.h |
naaraayaNaM mahaaGYeyaM vishvaatmaanaM paraayaNam.h ||

 The protector of the universe, the Lord of all Souls (or Lord over Self), the
perpetual, the auspicious, the indestructible, the Goal of all creation, the
Supreme object worthy of being known, the Soul of all beings, the Refuge
unfailing (is He).

naaraayaNa paro jyotiraatmaa naaraayaNaH paraH |
naaraayaNa paraM brahma tattwaM naaraayaNaH paraH |
naaraayaNa paro dhyaataa dhyaanaM naaraayaNaH paraH ||

 The Lord Narayana is the Supreme Absolute; Narayana is the Supreme
 Reality; Narayana is the Supreme Light; Narayana is the Supreme Self;
 Narayana is the Supreme Meditator; Narayana is the Supreme
 Meditation.

yachcha ki.nchit.h jagat.h sarvaM dR^ishyate shrUyate.api vaa |
a.ntarbahishcha tatsarvaM vyaapya naaraayaNaH sthitaH ||

 Whatever all this universe is, -seen or heard of, -pervading all this from
inside and outside alike, stands supreme the Eternal Divine Being
(Narayana).

anantaM avyayaM kaviM samudrentaM vishvashaMbhuvam.h |
padma kosha pratIkaashaM hR^idayaM cha api adhomukham.h ||

 He is the Limitless, Imperishable, Omniscient, residing in the ocean
of he heart, the Cause of the happiness of the universe, the Supreme
end of all striving, (manifesting Himself) in the ether of the heart
which is comparable to an inverted bud of the lotus flower.

adho nishhThyaa vitastyaante naabhyaam upari tishhThati |
jvaalaamaalaakulaM bhaatI vishvasyaayatanaM mahat.h ||

 Below the Adams apple, at a distance of a span, and above the navel
(i.e., the heart which is the relative seat of the manifestation of
Pure Consciousness in the human being), effulges the Great Abode of
the universe, as if adorned with garlands of flames.

santataM shilaabhistu lambatyaa koshasannibham.h |
tasyaante sushhira.n sUkshmaM tasmin sarvaM pratishhThitam.h ||

 Surrounded on all sides by nerve-currents (or arteries), suspends
the lotus-bud of the heart in an inverted position. It is in a subtle space
(a narrow aperture, the Sushumna-Nadi), and therein is to be found the
Substratum of all things.

tasya madhye mahaanagniH vishvaarchiH vishvato mukhaH |
so.agravibhaja.ntishhThan aahaaraM ajaraH kaviH ||

 In that space within the heart resides the Great Flaming Fire,
undecaying, all-knowing, with tongues spread out in all directions,
with faces turned everywhere, consuming food presented before it,
and assimilating it unto itself.

tiryagUrdhvamadhashshaayI rashmayaH tasya santataa |
santaapayati svaM dehamaapaadatalamaastakaH |
tasya madhye vahnishikhaa aNIyordhvaa vyavasthitaaH ||

 His rays, spreading all around, side ways as well as above and below,
warm up the whole body from head to foot. In the center of That
(Flame) abides the Tongue of Fire as the topmost of all subtle things.
(Note: Due to the attachments and entanglements of the Jiva in worldly
enjoyment and suffering, the Consciousness is enshrouded in potential
as well as expressed objectivity, and hence it appears like a tiny
streak of flame within the dark clouds of ignorance. But when the Jiva
rises above worldliness the Consciousness is realised as he Infinite.)

niilatoyada-madhyastha-dvidyullekheva bhaasvaraa |
nIvaarashUkavattanvI pItaa bhaasvatyaNUpamaa ||

 Brilliant like a streak of lightning set in the midst of the blue rain-bearing
clouds, slender like the awn of a paddy grain, yellow (like gold) in colour,
in subtlety comparable to the minute atom, (this Tongue of Fire) grows
splendid.

tasyaaH shikhaayaa madhye paramaatmaa vyavasthitaH |
sa brahma sa shivaH sa hariH sa indraH so.aksharaH paramaH swaraaT.h ||

 In the Middle of That Flame, the Supreme Self dwells. This (Self) is
Brahma (the Creator), Siva (the Destroyer), Hari (the Protector),
Indra (the Ruler), the Imperishable, the Absolute, the Autonomous
Being. Prostrations again and again to the Omni-Formed Being, the
Truth, the Law, the Supreme Absolute, the Purusha of blue-decked
yellow hue, the Centralised-Force, Power, the All-Seeing One.

R^itaM satyaM paraM brahma purushhaM kR^ishhNa pi~Ngalam.h |
UrdhvaretaM virUpaakshaM vishvarUpaaya vai namo namaH ||

 Prostrations again and again to the Omni-Formed Being, the Truth, the
Law, the Supreme Absolute, the Purusha of blue-decked yellow hue, the
Centralised-Force, Power, the All-Seeing One.

OM naaraayaNaaya vidmahe vaasudevaaya dhImahi |
tanno vishhNuH prachodayaat.h ||

 We commune ourselves with Narayana, and meditate on Vasudeva,
may that Vishnu direct us (to the Great Goal).

OM shaa.nti shaa.nti shaa.ntiH ||

 Om. May there be Peace, Peace, Peace
