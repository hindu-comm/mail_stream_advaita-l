Shri SwaminArayanji:

There is a specific reason as to why Shri Vyasa Rishi wrote Srimad
Bhagavatam and not just stop with Mahabharata.  That would be part of the
Bhagavatam itself.  We will wait for Smt. Lataji to come to it, when she
does it in her postings.  If she skips it I will be glad to write it.

ShrimadBhagavatam is a separate text from MahaBharata. It contains 12
skandhas, based on various avataaras of vi.s.nu, out of which da"sama
skandha.h (10th section) gives lila of shrik.r.s.na. The whole text is
characterized by beutiful poetry and comparatively difficult language
(as compared to, say, valmiki raamaaya.na). Some of the best known
prayers are found in Bhagavatam.
