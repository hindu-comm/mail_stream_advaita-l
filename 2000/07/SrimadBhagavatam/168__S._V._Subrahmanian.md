Response to Shri Jaldharji:

Yes.  You are right.  Since I have lived both North and South India, I came
to understand that SrimadBhagavatam (original) was more popular for
"pravachan" and "parAyaNam" in North than in the South.

In TamilNadu, I have not known of a popular Tamil translation of Srimad
Bhagavatam or a Tamil rendering of the poem, as opposed to Ramayana(Kamba
RamAyaNam) and MahabhAratam(VilliputturAr's VilliBharatam).  Also Vaishnava
sampradAya established by AzhwArs, have their own literature.

In Kerala, Srimad NarayaNIyam is very popular and the rendering was in
Sanskrit, by Sri NarAyaNa Bhattatri.  May be because the size of the
original was daunting that people always used nAryaNIyam.

In Andhra, Poothana's Bhagavatam a rendering of Srimad Bhagavatam is very
popular.  Like the original, it also is filled with devotion and I have
heard people quote verses from the Telugu rendering rather than the
original.

In Karnataka, please refer to Shri Raghavendra Hebbalal's mail where he
mentions the works in Kannada.

Just sharing the info, I know of.

Regards.
S. V. Subrahmanian.
