Hari Om,

I am quite confused with the meanings of the above three taapaa-s.
What my understanding is :

aadhyaatmika taapa : the taapas or the problems that occur with in oneself
( internally ) . They may be related to our physical health, mental health,
spiritual health, the strength of our indriiyaas, our intellectual strength,
our moral strength etc etc which are to some extent under our own control.

aadhibhoutika taapa :   The problems created by external sources - other
creatures ( bhootaas ), other persons who may have ill feelings towards us or
problems unintentionally created by others. For example : (1) you are about to
leave the house to attend some interesting discourse by a renowned swamiji.
Suddenly guests appear at your doorstep and you have to cancel your programme.

(2) You are interested in studying philosophy, but your spouse is totally
materialistic and dead against it !
(3) the taapa caused by the deer to king Bharatha (Jadabharatha)

aadhidaivika taapa   :  the problems created by the dieties responsible for
the Natural forces like wind, fire, rain etc etc. The naturally occuring
calamities like typhoon, earthquake, famine, floods etc etc which are
absolutely beyond our control. Fate is also one such taapa.

Is my understanding correct ? Please correct me if I am wrong.

Regards,
Latha Vidyaranya
