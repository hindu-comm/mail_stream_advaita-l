Dear List members,

Whilst on the subject of Sparsha Diksha of great
Gurus, I would like to post the case of my father who
has told us that he got his Diksha from his guru known
as "Narmade Har Babaji" who was always doing parikrama
of the river Narmada and who only preached to people
who came to him. My father knew no sanskrit and had
been initiated into Advaitic philosophy by his Guru
Babaji.
One day, it seems,Babaji told my father that he should
preach,to which my father told him that he could not
preach since he did not know sanskrit and all the
upanishad mantras.Thereupon Babaji just touched my
father's shoulder with his right palm and said,"You
Know" and he  instantly Knew!!

 I have heard my father quoting from all the major
upanishads and explaining to those who came to him for
a discussion ,talk or advice.

This is what is "Sparsha Diksha" given by an
enlightened Guru.

Some time later my father has also told us that Babaji
was actually asked to take up a very very senior
position in the Shringeri Muth which Babaaji refused
and continued his paarikrama of Narmadaji.

I myself have had the good fortune of meeting this
Babaji sometime on the banks of the river Naramada and
heard him explain the Patanjali Sutras to us.

May the Guru's grace be upon all his deciples.

Hari Om!

Swaminarayan.
