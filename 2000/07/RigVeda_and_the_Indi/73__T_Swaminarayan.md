Does not the Taittiriya Upanishad belong to the Yajur
Veda? How does this mantra  take a place in your
current comments on the Rig Veda?Did you start with
this only to show the attitudes of Vedic Rishis and
how they viewed what they saw?

Is the Rishi you are referring to here - Diirghatama?
And, are you saying that this Rishi wants to say that
we can never reach Parabrahma in his RV 1-164-43?

For my own understanding, are the Hot.r , adhvaryu,
udgaat.r etc mentioned in the yagna in the Chandogya
upanishad also to be interpreted as part of the
yajamana's brain?

Could you kindly explain as to when in the Hindu
Calender does the thirteenth month come? I am not
aware of any Hindu year consisting of always thirteen
months.

(i) You have indeed expressed your ideas very clearly
(ii) It will really be nice and effective ( for lay
men like me ) if, after posting a mantra, you give
the word to word translation of the mantra as it is
and then post your compact meaning as surmised by you.
(iii) Yes. For beginners like me .But you have other
scholars in the list who may find it to be elementary.
(iv) This very much depends on the mantras from Rig
Veda that you propose posting further on this thread.I
personally feel that you have done very well so far.
(v) Most certainly, Himanshuji.

May God Bless you.
