In this connection, note the interesting comparison made by Sankaracarya,
between Atman and the silent brahma priest, who is a witness of the yajna
and does not take part in it.

With Ravi, I feel multiple levels of interpretation are possible. It is
not that one is wrong and another is right absolutely - they are just
applicable in different ways, depending on the aptitude of the sAdhaka.
