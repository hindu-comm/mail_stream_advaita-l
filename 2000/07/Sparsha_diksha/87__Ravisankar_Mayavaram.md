There was some discussion on sparsha diixa. Likewise there is also
nayana diixa, that is initiation by look which subtler than the former.
Even subtler than that is the initiation by thought. Take the case of
giri, who later became toTakaacharya. giri was a dull student but had
enormous guru bhakti and shraddha. Out of his boundless grace bhagavan
shrii shankara bestowed him jnAna just by thought.

This initiation by thought can also manifest as sparsha or nayana diixa
in dream. And initiation in a dream is not any way inferior to that
happens in waking state.

Ravi
