It is easier to fix a sharp focus on an external goal. All our
human conditioning helps us in directing our senses and thought
outwards. It is much, much more difficult to fix a focus on a
goal that is defined primarily as "not this, not this."

Well, I should think that the mild interest, if it is sincere, and
not a mere show, will lead them gradually to things that will impart
the necessary strength. The mild interest has to get intensified a
little first, otherwise, they end up creating problems for themselves
and for others. Knowledge is transmitted through human beings, often
very fallible creatures. These statements are therefore meant to be
cautionary. They turn the merely curious away, but that is meant
to preserve both the sanity of the merely curious, and the integrity
of the teaching! Once the merely curious turns into a more serious
search, then the required strength builds up.
