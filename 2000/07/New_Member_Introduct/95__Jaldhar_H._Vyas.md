Namaste,

It is with the highest regard that I introduce myself to true scholars and
seekers of the truth.  I am a student of Swami Chidvilasananda.  I think
of myself as one who primarily practices Bhakti Yoga.

In order to deepen my understanding, I have begun the study of Vedanta.
My knowledge at this point is quite limited, so I thank all of you for
your patience and tolerance for one who may not have been trained in a
traditional manner.  May our hearts and minds dwell in the same Divine
space.

With Respect,
Doug
