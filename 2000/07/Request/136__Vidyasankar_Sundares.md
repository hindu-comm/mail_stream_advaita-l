Thanks. That is precisely what I was looking for! Harper (New York)
had published the work much earlier (1953), and I suppose they used
the same material for the recent Indian edition. I'm glad there is
an Indian imprint available. The foreign editions are often too
costly for the average Indian buyer.

Best regards,
Vidyasankar
