Pg. 913;
Publisher: INDUS (An imprint of Harper Collins Publishers India Pvt. Ltd.);
New Delhi;
Year: First published by INDUS in 1994--- second impression in 1995

The actual quotation occurs on Pg. 913 while the translation of section 2.12
extends to pg. 914
Hope this suffices.

If somebody has a copy of S. Radhakrishnan's translation of the
principal Upanishads, I would greatly appreciate some help with
a particular quotation.

paingala upanishad (2. 12) has a sentence, "adhyAropa-apavAdatas
svarUpaM niScayIkartuM Sakyate." Radhakrishnan has included this
text and a few other small upanishads, along with the ten major
ones, in his translation. If someone can give me the following
details, it would be very helpful -

Publication year, publisher, and page number of this particular
quotation.

Thanks,
Vidyasankar
