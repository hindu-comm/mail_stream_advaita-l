  Salutations to Him who has dark hair (without a trace of grey hair),
  (harikeshAya), who wears the yaGYopavIta (upavItine) and who is the Lord
  of the virtuous (puShTAnAM pataye).


  sAyaNAchArya's commentary:
  --------------------------
  harikeshAya nIlamUrdhajAya palitarahitAya | upavItine maN^galArthaM
  yaGYopavItadhAriNe rudrAya namo .astu | puShTAnAM paripUrNaguNAnAM
  puruShANAM pataye svAmine namo .astu |

  (Salutations to Him whose) hair is dark and without any grey hair
  (ie. who is ever youthful). May salutations be to Rudra who wears the
  yaGYopavIta (sacred thread) for the purpose of performing auspicious
  karmas such as yajnas and others. Salutations to the Lord of persons
  who are full of excellent virtues.

  Note:

 bhaTTa-bhAskara interprets "puShTi" as perfections of which there are
 ten kinds.

  dasha puShTayaH santi | vAkpuShTirGYAnapuShTiH sharIrendriyapuShTir-
  gR^ihaxetrapuShTirdhanadhAnyapuShTiH prajApuShTiH pashupuShTirgrAma-

 There are ten kinds of perfections pertaining to 1) speech, 2) knowledge
 3) body and organs, 4) dwellings, fields, and lands, 5) wealth and
 grains, 6) children, 7) cattle, animals, 8) community, 9) dharma, and
 10) the aShTa-siddhis, beginning with aNimA. Salutations to Rudra who
 is the Lord of these puShTi's.
