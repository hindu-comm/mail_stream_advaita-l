Kindly note the pitru tarpanam as part of brahma yagyam is to be done by
all people daily as it is not for the respective person's forefathers but
to the "generic" pitri's ... a lot of people have the mistaken idea that
this part of brahma yagyam is to be done by only people whose parents have
passed on, but that it not right.
