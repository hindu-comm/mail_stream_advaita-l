Thanks for posting the translation. It really helped me to understand
"is to be covered".

Besides that, the renunciation described here, is it done so in order
to set the tone for subsequent verses?  To me it reads that karma
should not be abandonded but only the desires (for its fruits).  Can
you and others explain the last sentence in greater detail.

You have done a wonderful job of translating it. (I am greedy here),
can you post the entire bhAshhya of this upaniShad with translation. I
will be grateful if you can.


Thanks.

With respects,
Ravi
