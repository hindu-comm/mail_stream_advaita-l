namaste,
     Thanks for the correction. Ishwara as the AtmA is
definitely the correct translation.
     Please read the translation by replacing 'The one who feels Ishwara in
the AtmA' with 'the one who regards Ishwara *as* his own Self'.

Regards,
Raghavendra.

Subject: Shravana masa starts tomorrow

For anyone waiting for an answer from me, I haven't forgotten but I am
incredibly pressed for time right now.

But I thought I'd write a quick note about the month of Shravana which
begins tomorrow (Tuesday.)  It is a month of utsavas with such important
days as Naga Panchami, Janmashtami, Raksha Bandhana (which is also the day
Brahmanas change their Yajnopavitas) falling within it.

Shravana is especially dear to Shiva Bhagawan and the Shivalayas
are thronged with worshippers during this month.  Bhaktas should do His
abhisheka and puja every day if possible or at least every Monday.  A
common custom is to make a parthiva linga or temporary linga made out of
clay.  It is worshipped for all the days of Shravana and then the
visarjana is done in a river.

One should not shave or cut ones hair or nails during Shravana.  In my
family the practice seems to have been just to do a regular tilaka of
kumkum during most of the year but this month we make it a point to do the
full tripundra.

What other customs related to Shravana are there in other parts of the
country?
