 Thanks to Smt. Latha Vidyaranya for starting this wonderful series
 on the bhAgavata. As shrI shuka says:

 vAsudevakathAprashnaH puruShAnstrIn-punAti hi |
 vaktAraM pR^ichchhakaM shrotR^InstatpAdasalilaM  yathA || 10.1.16 ||

 A question raised about shrI vAsudeva's deeds purifies three
 kinds of people - one who answers the question (by narrating
 His stories), one who asks the question (one who asks to be told
 about vAsudeva), and the listeners, just as the water that springs
 forth from His feet, ie. the gangA, (purifies all the three worlds).

 Let us all benefit from the nectar of vAsudeva-kathA.

 Anand
