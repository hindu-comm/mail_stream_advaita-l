The actual injunction is mA gRdha -- "Do not thirst" which is very
significant I think.  When you are thirsty, you do not stop to think about
flavor, purity, etc. of what you are drinking, your overriding goal is to
be rid of the painful sensation of thirst.  We come across so many people
like this who amass wealth just for the sake of it.  They often do not
even enjoy their gains and may even become quite miserable because of
their material pursuits but they just don't know how to stop.  The Rshi
addresses them.  Even if you amass great quantities of things, what good
will it do you?  They are the Lords not yours.

Charles is right.  Although it looks funny in English, in Sanskrit it is a
common grammatical formulation and doesn't imply any hesitation on the
subject.

As the translation of Swami Gambhirananda was mentioned I would like to
point out one misleading point of his commentary (though he got it right
in the translation of the verse itself.)  At least it confused me until I
got a chance to see the actual Sanskrit text of the bhashya.  Svit is
called a "meaningless particle"  Actually this is what is called a nipAta
in Sanskrit Vyakarana.  It is like in English you mighr say "nice weather
today, eh?"  eh has no meaning in itself but adds an interrogative tone to
the sentance.  In the same way svit adds emphasis.  "Whose indeed is
wealth?"
