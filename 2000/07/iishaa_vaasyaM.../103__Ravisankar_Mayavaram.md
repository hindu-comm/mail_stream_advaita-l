I apologize upfront if there are any errors in my question.  How did
you come up with "is to be" in the second line of the translation?  By
that dont you imply it is not already covered already and one has to
make an attempt to do so? Also where did you account for "kasyasvid".
I would like to have a more detailed (basis for this) interpretation.
Thank you. This is a very different translation of this verse and quite
nice.



Ravi
