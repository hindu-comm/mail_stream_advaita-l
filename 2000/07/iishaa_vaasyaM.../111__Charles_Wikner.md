Although jagatyAm is singular it represents all worlds,
or if you prefer, it could be "in the universe", where
the universe contains all worlds.

Real ??   jagat: neuter noun = that which moves or is alive.
Jaldhar has given the root.

jagatI: feminine noun = mankind, the world, universe.

Shankara explains idam sarvam as cara=acara - moving and
unmoving; jagat as dvaita-rUpa - apparent duality, or of
the nature or character of duality;  jagatyAm as pRthvyAm -
on the earth.  He adds that this is used metaphorically to
represent all names, forms and actions, that are founded on
change, i.e. mAyA.

If it helps to overcome the verbal problem, consider jagat
as that which manifests movement, and jagatI as the realm
in which the movement takes place.

I can believe that as I slowly come to appreciate
the profundity and scope of it.

Any translation is an interpretation.  All scriptures have
layers of meaning, according to the development of the student,
and hence the need to study the language in which the original
was expressed.

That is fine: it captures the spirit of it and removes the
"doing".  The practice of such memory makes it part of one's
nature (saMskAra), so that it becomes an attitude of mind,
not even an act of memory.

The scriptures are there to help us, so please use "is".
Only remember the Lord!

I am far from being a scholar, and have no ambitions in that
direction; besides, as a student I can still be forgiven mistakes!

No, no!  Take the word of the Lord!

?? I read jagatyAm as locative singular of jagatI.

Every silver lining has a cloud.  :-)

Thanks for pointing that out.  It was rather crass to blithely
assume that anything in the scriptures is meaningless.  The word
is in M-W dictionary under svid, with the meaning as you have
described -- it helps to use the tools that one has, and not
jump to a confusion!
