Shri Charlesji wrote:

Oh it's a fair question.  Bear in mind that the scriptures are
for the ignorant, not the realised (see BG 2:46), so reading
the first sentence as an injunction is quite valid.  There are
those who would say "A rose is a rose is a rose", whereas a
rose is in fact an upAdhi of the Lord; and this injunction is
a means to remember that, so that one does not take the upAdhi
to be real, covet it, and forget the Lord.

Response:
Even though you were answering Shri Raviji, you have touched upon a point I
mentioned about.  Thanks for your correction.  I take it.


Regards.
S. V. Subrahmanian.
