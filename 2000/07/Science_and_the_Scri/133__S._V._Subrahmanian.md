Based on Shri Lata Vidyaranya's email, is it safe to conclude the following:

1.  Our purANAs are at divergence with Darwin's theory of evolution.

2.  Human being is the highest physically evolved being, the next step in
evolution being only inner-progress (inner-progress with all its spiritual
ramifications)
