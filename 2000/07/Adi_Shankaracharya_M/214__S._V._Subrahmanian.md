Dear Members,

I was going through the archives and found that somebody had requested as to
where the Sanskrit movie on Adi Shankaracharya was available.  It was long
ago.  But since then new members have joined.  For those who live in the
TriState area, USA, the movie which is a life history of Adi Shankara
directed and produced by G.V.Iyer and is fully in Sanskrit (all dialogues,
not just shlokas) is available with English sub-titles in the Ganesh Temple,
Flushing, Queens, NY City, NY.  The print is good.

For those who have access to this place, please visit the canteen at the
basement of  the auditorium and there would be a small bookshop there
managed by one Mr. Reddy.  The video cassettes are available there.  I don't
know if they ship them.  You can try contacting them at:

(718) 460-8484  or  www.indianet.com/ganesh  (I think Phone would be
better).

Also, when the manager is away, the priests come on the line.  Their
knowledge of English is modest.  Please don't use bombastic language, you
will be loser -:)

Regards.
S. V. Subrahmanian.
