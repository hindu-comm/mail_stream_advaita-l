The first explanation you got explains only the continued visible embodiment
of the realized being. The second explanation, involving lIlA, is at best
figurative, just like lIlA being invoked to explain why brahman creates. The
third explanation has been rejected within advaita itself. Either there is
adhyAsa or there isn't.

The only explanation for why a Guru who has attained the highest would teach
a disciple is that he does so, not out of any motivation or expectation of
personal/private benefit, but out of compassion for those who ask him for
advice and knowledge. See how vidyAraNyasvAmin salutes SankarAcArya -
