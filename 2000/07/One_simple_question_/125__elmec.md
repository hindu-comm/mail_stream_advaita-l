Hari Om,

Let me also try to answer from what little knowledge I have gained. Learned
members, kindly excuse my impertinence.

The moment Realisation dawns upon the Saadhaka, there is no question of any sort
of balance of karma still to be endured by him.  It is only the vyaavaharika
mind of the ajnaani which conjures up this explanation. When the Truth is
Ekameevaadvitiiyam, where is the question of kartr^i, karma or the phala ?

The jnaani has stopped acting. He rests in his true Self. There is no stage, no
director nor audience to witness the drama anymore. But it is the maaya which
still envelopes the shishya which makes him think that the Guru continues to
help him to cross over the ocean of samsaara. When the shishya also crosses
over, he too realises that there was no ocean at all in the first place , nor
was this boat in the form of body, nor the boatman in the form of Guru. "

The jnaani realises that it was all aadhyaaropa apavaada. The slate was clean.
Someone worked out problems on it. When the problem got solved, the writing on
it was erased and the slate was once again declared " clean " !

My answers may not have solved your doubt. If they have not entangled it even
more, I am saved !
