Good, this is better! :)

I am somewhat hampered right now by not having immediate access to this
commentary. But there is no major contradiction involved. The general idea
is that Gaudapada got knowledge from Narayana. That constitutes the
mANDUkya upanishad, which is considered scripture. Since the translation
uses the term "by the scripture", my guess is that Sankara uses the
instrumental case in Sanskrit, which can also mean "through the scripture".

Yes, it is remarkable.

He probably thought that there would be no confusion! It is only in the
last 100 years or so, with non-traditional pundits getting interested in
these texts, that this problem has arisen.

The stylistic similarities extend beyond the invocation verses, and have
been much commented upon. But we have to go beyond style and get to
substance, no? So, it would be good idea for our list-members to move away
from generalities, and to get around to discussing the details of
gauDapAda's kArikAs, from all four books.

Best wishes,
Vidyasankar
