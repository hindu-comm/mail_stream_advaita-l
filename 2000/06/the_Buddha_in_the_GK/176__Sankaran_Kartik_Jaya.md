Since the thread "Antiquity of advaita vedanta" has taken a wild turn, I
have changed the subject-line of this posting so that it better reflects
the topic I'm interested in discussing.

But Shankara himself takes the word "deshitaH" to mean "instructed by
scripture."

I only have Swami Gambhirananda's translation with me, not the original.
Anyway, the translation of Shankara's commentary goes: "...The Yoga of
this kind that has been deshitaH, instructed, by the scripture; taM, to
that; ahaM namAmi, I make my salutation, i.e, I bow down..."

Of course, your point that the Buddha-alias-nArAyaNa is first being
saluted as the teacher of non-dualism is also made by Shankara.

The frequency of the use of the word "Buddha" in GK4 as a reference to the
GYAnii is rather unusual (more than 10 times within a hundred verses), and
I find it difficult to convince myself that the concluding shloka GK4.99
refers to two entirely different Buddhas (it first speaks of "Buddha's
GYAna" and then that which is "taught by the Buddha"). Shankara could've
easily recognized the confusion likely to be created in making the word
ambiguous and so expressly declared that the Buddha being praised is NOT
the historical one. He doesn't do so.

I think the similarity in the styles is quite striking. They are the first
invocatory verse of the MMK and GK4 respectively.
