Yes, abhinava is new. Generally, when there has already been a predecessor
with the same name, the adjective abhinava is added to the name of the later
person. There is a SrIrudrabhAshya, attributed to abhinava SankarAcArya. His
monastic name was actually rAmabrahmAnanda tIrtha, but he was considered a
second or a "new" SankarAcArya, hence the name.
