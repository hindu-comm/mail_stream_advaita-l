Very good argument. Yes, as Vidhya pointed out, knowledge grows with
discussion.

According to the MAdhyamaka dialectic one pramAna cannot validate another
because it itself needs to be validated. If you say that shruti pramAna is
the base on which the rest are validated, then the Bauddha's question would
be what validates the shruti pramAna?

If it is faith which validates it, then it is meaningless to the Bauddha
for the shruti is not scripture to him. It also pushes the argument
beyond the sphere of reason and hence philosophy and there would be no
point in the argument in the first place.

NAgArjuna's negation of the pramAnas is not a mere dogmatic assertion.
REASON is the base on which the pramAnas are negated. So is reason itself
the pramAna then? But the problem is anything which is expressed using
reason is found to be self-contradictory and hence shUnya. But still it is
what invalidates all conceptions including pramAnas.

So it is not *speculative* reason which is the negating base, but
*dialectical* reason - a higher level of critical philosophical
consciousness - neti, neti - which negates conceptions (including
pramAnas). But the moment you try to *express* it, it runs into
contradictions. So *silence* or maunam is the best way to express it.
Its ontological implication is bodhi chitta or prAjnA pAramitA or
the deconceptualized pure mind, which shines bright in awareness of
the unreality of the conditioned phenomenal world.

But it has to be recognized that in Advaita the shruti being the pramAna on
which the other pramAnas are invalidated, is only at the vyavahAra or
phenomenal level and as explained above it is not a valid argument when
arguing with non-Vedic opponents. But again even in Advaita, the shruti is
only lower knowledge and it is not applicable to the realized being. At the
paramArtha level, jnAna itself is the pramAna which invalidates all
pramAnas.

Another argument which can be made is that if the shruti is the expression
of spiritual experiences of realized beings and if it is the base on which
pramAnas are invalidated, then it indirectly means that it is only the
higher knowledge of the seers (which is nothing by the Advaitic jnAna),
which invalidate the pramAnas.

And as we should immediately realize, this is not very different from the
MAdhyamaka position explained above. Advaitic JnAna or the MAdhyamaka PrAjna
is the base on which the pramAnas are negated.
