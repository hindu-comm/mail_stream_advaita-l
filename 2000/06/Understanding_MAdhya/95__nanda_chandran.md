This is in reply to Vivekanand's doubts regarding the MAdhyamaka dialectic.

My only advice to you is that do not come to conclusions so quickly. Read
the argments carefully and think and think hard about the issues before you
come to a conclusion. It took a couple of years for me to understand the
dialectic and so give yourself some time to understand it. But again nobody
presented it me on a platter, as I'm doing now on the list. So it should be
slightly easier for you.

It will take a lot of concentration, hard and abstract thinking to
understand the dialectic. You've to be pretty imaginative too and should try
to relate it to normal life (I see you're doing that and that's good).

The relationship between the desire and the desirous thing, is especially
abstract. I'll give you a clue - the crux of the problem lies in the lack of
simultaniety and non-simultaniety of the relationship between the two. I
read it numerous times before it suddenly hit me. If you understand that,
pratiitya samutpAda  and its shUnyatA, will become pretty clear to you. So
concentrate and think hard.
