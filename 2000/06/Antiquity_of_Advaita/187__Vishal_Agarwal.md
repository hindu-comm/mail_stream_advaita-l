Very interesting. The upanishads use the analogy of the chariot too

VA: Actually, the word 'Ratha' is used for the Human body as early as
Atharvaveda (Paippalada) 8.9.7
Incidently, the Sukta 8.9 is called 'Brahmasukta' and its 10th mantra has
the words 'Brahma dasa Brahma dasha...." which are quoted by Bhagvatpada
under Brahmasutra "Amsho nana vyapadeshat.." (I think the address is
2.3.43).
