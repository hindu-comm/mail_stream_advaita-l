Very interesting. The upanishads use the analogy of the chariot too. But
there, the point being made is that without the horses (the senses -
inriyas), a chariot is simply useless, and without a charioteer (the Atman)
to control the horses, it can only run amok. And note the epic
personification of the Lord as the charioteer on whose side lies victory
(gItA).

See bRhadAraNyaka upanishad, maitreyI brAhmaNa - the dialogue between
yAjnavalkya and his wife, maitreyI.

And that is precisely why (along with yAjnavalkya) Sankara has argued that
non-duality is beyond experience too. To equate fleeting perceptions of
mystic union with Brahman, without investigating what is behind such
perceptions, can be often misleading.

And to this I would the Buddhist side - both the traditional leaders and the
neo-Buddhists have been saying all along that to read an eternal Self in
Buddhist works is a misrepresentation. They are also people with great
integrity, and people who live their tradition.

Best wishes,
Vidyasankar
