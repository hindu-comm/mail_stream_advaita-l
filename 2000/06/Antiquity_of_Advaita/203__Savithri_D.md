Namaste,

>If the List members feel it would be useful, I would like to give an essay
>on the subject (i.e., "Advaita and other marga in RigVeda"), in form of
>several postings, with quotations from the most ancient text, with
>explanations, links with later Upanishads, etc.

I would really welcome this.  You would be doing a great service that
benefits many ignorants like me.

>The preparation required from the readers would be -- an open mind,
>reasonable knowledge of Sanskrit (so that the etymologies given can be
>followed),
>willingness for contemplation and a little bit of patience.
>
>Will the List members be interested? Your suggestions are welcome.

Thanks in advance,
Savithri
