But do not confuse this as an ontological position. The middle way is only
an epistemological reading. According to the MAdhyamakas, "is" and "is not"
are only *categories of the intellect*, which is why they shy away from both
extremes - for reality is beyond the intellect.

Only at the phenomenal level where everything is shUnya. But as NAgArjuna
teaches in the last chapter of the MMK, the twelve linked chain of causation
- pratItya samutpAda - itself is shUnya, because it is not ultimately
intelligible. That's why he says the Buddha in reality never taught any
dharma! For truth is silence.

Be prepared to change it again.
