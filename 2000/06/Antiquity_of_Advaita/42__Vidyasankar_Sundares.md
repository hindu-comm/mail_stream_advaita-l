Just to clarify, it has not been my intention to impose my view upon others.
And in this thread, I think the same holds true for Nanda also. The idea has
only been to sharpen one's understanding of the issues involved through
discussion with those who have other views.

It is said, vAde vAde ca tattvajnAnaH - through discussion, knowledge of
truth develops. In philosophical details, both Advaita Vedanta and
Madhyamaka Buddhism are very difficult to understand. As you note, there is
probably no "one" conclusion to this discussion. If there were, the great
philosophical giants in India would have arrived at it long before now!
If you are following Anand Hudli's postings on Madhusudana Sarasvati's
Advaitasiddhi, it should be clear that we are nowhere near the capabilities
of these past authors. We try, in our own ways, to understand, and to convey
what we understand to others. Hopefully, we learn something in the process.

Regards,
Vidyasankar
