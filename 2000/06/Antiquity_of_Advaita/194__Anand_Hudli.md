 This is unlikely. The final equation that nAgArjuna gives is
 pratItya-samutpAda = shUnyatA . This is made very clear also in the
 VigrahavyAvartanI. And what is pratItya-samutpAda? It is the relative
 reality of all things or the interconnected-ness of all things.

 This is in a nutshell what he says. If you understand pratItya-samutpAda,
 you have understood shUnyatA, and viceversa. This equation is his
 tight-rope balance - the Middle way. There is no absolute reality;
 there is no nihilism either. To realize the pratItya-samutpAda is
 to realize the shUnyatA which is again nirvANa, the "blowing out."
 He never says the world vanishes in nirvANa, like it does in the
 advaitin's mokSha.
