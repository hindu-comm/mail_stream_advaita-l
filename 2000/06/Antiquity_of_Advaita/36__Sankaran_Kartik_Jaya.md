Wittgenstein says pretty much the same thing you're trying to read into
Nagarjuna. W says in his book, Tractatus, "My propositions serve as
elucidations in the following way: anyone who understands me eventually
recognises them as nonsensical, when he has used them - as steps - to
climb up beyond them. He must, so to speak, throw away the ladder after he
has climbed up it...Whereof one cannot speak, thereof one must be silent."

So does W sound advaitic to you? Hardly. W is quite content to accept a
world which contains "multiple categories." He never disputes the idea
that the world contains diversity.

Therefore, EVEN IF Nagarjuna does not accept words as an expression of
Truth, he need not be an advaitin.

BTW, there are several books that  compare Wittgenstein with Nagarjuna.
Some passages from Nagarjuna's treatises seem to parallel W's, it's almost
as if they thought alike.
