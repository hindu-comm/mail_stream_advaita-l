 Indeed. In my opinion, the best picture one can get of the mAdhyamika
 philosophy of nAgArjuna is from the fourteenth century Tibetan monk,
 Tsong Kha-pa and his mAdhyamika tradition, the dGe-lugs-pa
 (pronounced Geluk-pa). Even an introductory study of translations of
 parts of his works shows very clearly that nAgArjuna's mAdhyamika,
 true to its name is far from absolutist. It very diligently avoids
 being at the two extremes of positing an absolute reality and
 advocating nihilism. The principle of pratItya-samutpAda reigns supreme
 in this system. It sure changed my previously held (misinformed)
 opinion of mAdhyamika as mere nihilism.
