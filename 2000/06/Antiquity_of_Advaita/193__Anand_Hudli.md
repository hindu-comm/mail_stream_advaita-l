 You are missing the point entirely. The question was what exactly
 was it that the Buddha taught. To answer this we must necessarily
 go back in time as far as we can to his day. It is as simple as
 that! If it means that we will find this from Hinayana, that is
 fine. Remember the question we are trying to answer here is what is
 it that Buddha taught during his day.

 On the contrary, the statement from nAgArjuna proves the non-self
 theory. He is saying that we should not even think of self or non-self
 (Atman or anAtman) because it is irrelevant. This is precisely the
 point of Buddha, not because the self exists but because it doesn't,
 according to him.

 This is precisely what you are NOT doing, sir! Let us hear the shruti,
 the advaita texts, the mahAyAna texts, etc. We have not heard a single
 consistent argument that ties your "reasoning" to these texts.

 Also, we have to be very clear about two things. 1) Are you giving
 your own interpretation of mAdhyamika, the way you understand
 nAgArjuna and his teachings? 2) Or are you giving an interpretation
 of nAgArjuna that was accepted by his followers and followed in the
 mAdhyamika tradition? Please make this clear.

For every argument/discussion there has to be certain "rules of the
game." In advaita and elsewhere, the technique of presenting one's thesis
has always been one of a combination of A) quoting shruti or authorities
on certain points and B) using further reasoning to arrive at conclusions
and establishing the thesis. We are yet to see this in a systematic
manner in the present case.
