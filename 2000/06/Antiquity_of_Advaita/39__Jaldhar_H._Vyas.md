I've heard two main objections to the ongoing threads on this topic.

1.  We should all be one happy family and not argue about dry theoretical
topics.

2.  Whatever Buddhism may have done in the past it belongs firmly in the
past and has no relevance to Advaita Vedanta today.

To the them I say that theory directly affects practice and understanding
the tenets of Vedanta and Buddhism, their similarities and profound
disagreements, is indispensable for truly achieving the goals of Advaita
Vedanta.

So Nanda, please go ahead and post.

And may I remind readers that if you think there are relevant subjects
which are not getting discussed amidst the theory, please feel free to
start a thread of your own.  You needn't wait for anyone.
