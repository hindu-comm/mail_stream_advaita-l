Yes, she too in her later books seemed to change her mind and asserted that
the Buddha taught the Atman theory.

That the Buddha taught the existance of the self, the non-self, both nor
neither, is not my claim. It is affirmed by NAgArjuna himself in his
commentary on the PrAjnA PAramita ShAstram, which he uses to explain the
true meaning of nairAtmaya.

ChandrakIrti also says : the buddha taught the doctrine of the self to those
of the lower intellect to prevent them falling into nihilism; he taught the
doctrine of the non-self to prevent people from falling into eternalism; for
the sharpest in intellect, he taught shUnyatA.
