Let me quote from your e-mail to Anand:

>"On the contrary there're numerous places where he teaches the existence
>of the self. For e.g., in the DhammapAda itself he says, "the Self is the
>lord of the self", "Use the self as your lamp, as your guide, ...",
>"Abide in your self", etc."

My appeal to T.R.V.Murti's authority was in the matter of translation
alone. He takes special pains to correct the mis-translation by
Mrs.Rhys-Davis (if I remember right).

And did I say that the Buddha

You said:
        "On the contrary there're numerous places where he teaches the
existence of the self."

You say now:

> Why I pointed out those verses is to show that the Buddha taught the
> existance of the self as well as anatta. So reading "no self" in Buddha's
> teaching, is not that straightforward.

Your argument ("On the contrary there're numerous places where he teaches
the existence of the self.") seems to rely on a *mistranslation*.

I agree with many of the arguments in your posts. I don't agree with some
based on what I've read. If I joined in with detailed replies to your
posts which I would like to do, it would require the kind of time I don't
have now.

Ganesh.
