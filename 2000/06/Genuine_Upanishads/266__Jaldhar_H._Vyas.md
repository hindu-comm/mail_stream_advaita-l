Thanks for the list.  Are you including the suktas because tradition
counts them as Upanishads or because they contain Vedantic material?

What is this Shivasamkalpa Brahmana?  In the Vajasaneyi Samhita
(34. 1-6) there is a Shivasamkalpa Sukta which Uvatacharya (Shayanacharya
didn't comment on the VS.) considers an Upanishad.  Is it related?
