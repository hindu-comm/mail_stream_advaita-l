Vaishnava philosophers find fault with the idea of Maya.  They do not
think it is warranted on the basis of shastras and logic.  In fact the
sampradaya of Vallabha calls itself Shuddhadvaita ("pure" Advaita.  I.e.
without the stain of Maya.) Advaitins naturally are prepared to defend
this view on both grounds.  Vaishnavas are by definition the followers of
Vishnu Bhagawan and they also don't like that in the Smarta Sampradaya the
worship of all the major Vedic Gods (Shiva, Vishnu, Shakti, Surya and
Ganapati Bhagawans)

The Advaitins main criticism of Vaishnavas is that while they may claim to
to base their philosophies on the shastras, they read them selectively and
thus fail to grasp the whole meaning.  Similarly their Bhakti is good but
it is flawed.  It falls a few steps short of the mark.

We just had a thread about these issues.  Please consult the list archives
for details.

It is a common propoganda trick that when you want to distract people from
your own problems you shout loudly about something else.

I have mixed feelings about this.  On the one hand people in Iskcon do
display a lot of zeal and energy towards following the shastras which is a
good thing (and something self-styled Advaitins often fail to do.)  On the
other hand most of them are ignorant and even worse content to remain
ignorant. I can't see any kind of Godhood arising out of ignorance.

ISKCON is barely a Vaishnava sampradaya at all.  I know many Viashnaves of
various authentic sects and I don't confuse Vaishnava philosophy with the
random utterences of ISKCON.

Yes.  Advaita Vedanta is firmly founded on the Vedas and subsidiary
shastras.

There are no foretellings of Chaitanya in the shastras except in the
imaginations of his followers.

Well each Guru remembers his teachers and their teachers etc. just as you
I remember our parents, and grandparents, and great grandparents.

According to shastras Vyasa Maharshi lived at the beginning of the
Kaliyuga which would be almost 5,000 years ago.  Whether one chooses to
take this as a historical ruth or a mythic one is a different matter.

Yes.  Please search the archives this question was answered about a month
or two ago.  There is also an online version (along with commentaries of
other schools) at the Gita Supersite http://www.cse.iitk.ac.in/gita/
though this is a little difficult to access.

An actual written copy?  I believe around the 12th century.  There are
quotes from the Gita in much more ancient works however.

I'm not exactly sure what you mean but some historians trace its origins
to 3rd-4th centuries BC.  Most of the dates in Indology are pure
guesswork.  As Hindus we don't particularly care about them.  According to
the Gita itself it was spoken on the battlefield of Kurukshetra but even
that was just the restatement of previous wisdom.

> How Advaitas translates BG 10:6?

It says that the 7 sages and 4 Manus are born from Krishna Bhagawans
mind and by his will.  The 7 sages (Saptarshis) are the mind-born sons of
Brahma.  The are the founders of the Jnana marga.  4 Manus is a little
more difficult because usually in the shastras they say there are 14
Manus and we are in the cycle of the seventh, Manu Vaivasvata. In each
world-cycle (Manvantara) Manu is the first man and the first king and
establishes the Karma marga.  Swami Madhusudan Saraswati suggests it
should be read as maharshayah sapte, poorve chatvaro, manavastathaa
7 sages, the previous 4, and Manus.  "The previous 4" would refer to the
the four Sanatakumaras.  They were also mind-born sons of Brahma and their
father asked them to perform creation.  But they refused and remained
engrossed in the worship of God.  So they are the founders of Bhakti
marga.  So the meaning of this verse is that Karma, Bhakti, and Jnana all
have their origins and goal in Bhagawan.

By understanding that this Supreme Soul is in truth identical to his own
soul.

Moksha (Vedantins don't use the term Nirvana) should not be thought of as
a shrivelling up, a reduction to the smallest possible size but an
expension.  If a person attains Moksha alone it is only because at that
point nothing exists outside which is not subsumed by his self.

Why would a person need the services of a Boddhisattva?  If one accepts
that the Paramatma is equivalent to the atma of all conscious things, then
they have as much innate capacity to realize the self as the would-be
Boddhisattva does.
