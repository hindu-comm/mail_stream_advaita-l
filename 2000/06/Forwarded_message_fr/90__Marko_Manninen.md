Dear Jaldhar

Ok, there were two things that arised.

Thank you very much for the examining. I'd like to cite one more book where
this manvantara and root race "system" is published first as i know, but on
fortcoming letter. Is that ok?

I ment with last question that why possible jivanmuktas has different kind
of teaching methods (doctrines) and spiritual"powers", siddhis if all
jivanmuktas are supposed to be "enlightened" from the _same_ source? Or are
there specific degrees of jivanmukta?

Very interestingly Buddha is to sayd to been in nirvana while in the earth,
but he also taught people over forty years after that. I don't know exact
meaning of boddhisatva idea but as you said "has stood at the door" is
familiar to me.
