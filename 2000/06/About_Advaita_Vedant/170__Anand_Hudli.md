 Here we go again. There can be nothing easier than jumping to conclusions,
 as exemplified here. It is easy to  brand others as religious zealots or
 what not, but what constructive comments are you providing here? I fail
 to see any. How do you justify what you say here? Have you searched
 the archives for the large number of very diverse topics that have been
 discussed before?

 This may sound a little harsh, and I apologize if it does, but you
 have come to the wrong place if you are looking for a meditation
 group. advaita is not all about meditation, at least the way it is
 recognized here. Certainly, you are welcome to discuss meditation, but
 don't expect only that.

 Really? How much personal information do you have about those members on
 the list to say all this about them? How can you justify what you say
 here about them regarding conversions, etc.?

 Two points. You can start your own discussion thread here on meditation
 Why don't you take the initiative and lead the discussion or at least
 post questions on meditation, etc. instead of running away from your
 computer? And, there have been a lot of quite useful discussions on
 the list in the past. You just have to search the archives to retrieve
 them.

 If you think there is too much drivel, why don't you make it a habit
 of posting a few "pearls"? There is as much, if not greater, pleasure in
 sharing with others as in taking from them. There is more pleasure in
 sharing information than in pontficating!
