Hi,

As a new member of the list, I am very disappointed by the way this
thread has been handled on all sides. There seems to be an intense
intolerance, especially on the part of the so-called "Advaitins", to
any claims of influence on advaita from other sources. As someone said
on one of the posts, it is quite obvious that both advaita and buddhism
have been influenced by each other. Can we not leave it at that ?

Some people have also said that such "dangerous" misinterpretations of
old texts can leave the newcomer confused. To this, I can only say that
a true seeker of the Truth is hardly likely to be concerned with such
trivialities as who influenced who. Is it not a basic tenet of Advaita
that the Truth is only one ?

Ritwik
