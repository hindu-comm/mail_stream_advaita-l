Offhand, I can't. I'm a PhD student, and I am taking the same approach
to advaita as I do to my research. I start out with a paper (text) that
is widely believed to deal with the topic I'm interested in, read it,
and then read papers (texts) referred to by that text. In the context
of advaita, I have started out by reading commentaries to the Gita,
Upanishads, etc. by Shankaracharya, who is generally known to be a
proponent of Advaita. My future course will be directed by references I
find to other texts. If these eventually include the
Mulamadhyamakakarika, then I will be in a position to say whether it is
an essential text or not.

I agree that it is not simple. Nevertheless, I am not willing to take
anybody else's interpretation of anything as the golden truth, so I
must, for myself, read and understand what the commentators and the
texts say.

If you are referring to what I think you're referring, it's easy.
Whenever a disciple brings up an objection from a non-Advaitin's
standpoint, it is generally made clear what the objection is, or where
a detailed description of it can be found. Basically, it goes back to
my first paragraph, that I will try to track down references to any
texts in the ones I've started with.

Oh no, not because I don't want to, but because it is not relevant to
my aim.
