Dear Ritwik,
        I am extending my full support to you.
        I am the member of the list for quite some time now and experiencing the same level of frustration which you are undergoing.
        I also had joined the group with a lot of expectation that the
fundamentals of Advaitha and its implications will be discussed, we can put
forward our doubts and discuss to find out the right things in the present
day context. This might help the Advaithins get updated as according to the
social and political age which is quite dynamic. But it seems, like any other
fundamentalists, the so called learned members of this list prefer to fight
amongst themselves rather than struggling to find the right truth or modifying
and updating the Advaithik philosophy.
So may I request you not to get perturbed by such mails so soon and observe
wait and watch policy. I am having a lot of fun by doing so.

Hi,

As a new member of the list, I am very disappointed by the way this
thread has been handled on all sides. There seems to be an intense
intolerance, especially on the part of the so-called "Advaitins", to
any claims of influence on advaita from other sources. As someone said
on one of the posts, it is quite obvious that both advaita and buddhism
have been influenced by each other. Can we not leave it at that ?

Some people have also said that such "dangerous" misinterpretations of
old texts can leave the newcomer confused. To this, I can only say that
a true seeker of the Truth is hardly likely to be concerned with such
trivialities as who influenced who. Is it not a basic tenet of Advaita
that the Truth is only one ?
