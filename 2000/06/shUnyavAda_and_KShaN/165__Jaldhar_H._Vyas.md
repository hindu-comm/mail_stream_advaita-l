For the person who is brahmanishta or established in Brahman there is no
untruth because he has vanquished it completely.  Such a person if he is
not already a sannyasi immediately becomes a sannyasi because the toys and
baubles of the world no longer interest him.

For those who merely "tend" towards Advaita (and that includes nearly
everyone on the list) there is still untruth.  Depending on how far along
they are on the path there might be a little untruth or a lot but there is
some.

So how do they get rid of it?  Simply declaring "the untrue doesn't
exist" and then going about doing the same things as before is only
hypocrisy and will not do.  So the various disciplines such as logic,
Bhakti, meditation etc.  must be practiced.  When all the untruths have
fallen one by one,what remains is the truth.
