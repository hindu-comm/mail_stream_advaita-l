That presumes you know what the essential texts are.  Is the
Mulamadhyamakakarika an essential text?  On what basis could you answer
this question?

Again we have to ask "reasonable" by what standard?  Reading and
interpreting are not simple straightforward objective things.  Lately
western philosophy has been considering these subjects but our sages
discussed them at length 100's of years ago.

You are right in a historical sense it is really a moot point
because for one thing Buddhism is extinct in India.  From the
standpoint of a seeker of Truth it is still relevant in the sense that
many of those essentuial texts you mention deal with issues brought up by
the Buddhists.  How will you understand what they are talking about if you
don't understand the issues?

In the case of Madhyamaka Buddhism we are reconstructing an extinct way of
thinking so a little leeway should be permitted.  But Advaita has a long
unbroken historical tradition and literature that still exists today.
There it is a lot easier to detect distortions and a lot less need to be
tolerant of them.

Because you don't want to not because it couldn't be done.  One of the
goals of Advaita Vedanta is to analyze (and ultimately destroy) this "I
want" and "I don't want"

I think I have learnt a thing or two from this thread but if you think
something else is more important please bring it up!  We have a lot of
silent members on this list unless they speak up I'm going to assume that
they're interested in the same things I'm interested.

And to know that surely you also need to know what it doesn't say about
the truth and what it says about people who have different ideas about the
truth?
