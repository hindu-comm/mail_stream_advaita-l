Not necessarily. Speaking for myself, as someone who is interested in
what Advaita Vedanta has to say, I am trying to read the essential
texts that lay out Advaita philosophy, and to see whether what they are
saying is reasonable. I will then decide whether to delve deeper into
Advaita or not. But to do this, I have no need to try ot verify the
historical statement of whether Buddhism influenced Advaita, or vice
versa.

That is debatable. For one, I doubt that anybody can claim to "know"
the truth of this matter (buddhism vs. advaita). Hence, it is virtually
impossible to say whether the truth is being distorted or obscured. Of
course, this is not to grant license to anybody to distort somebody
else's statements.

Also, I disagree with that statement in general. For example, if
someone were to make a claim as to the lifestyle of some obscure
Saharan tribe, I would not spend 15 days to try to find out if he is
distorting the truth. The point I'm trying to make is that we should be
intolerant of distortions, only as far as they concern our primary aim.
As I described earlier, to me, the entire topic of who influenced who
is completely irrelevant.

Precisely my point :). I am not seeking the truth of whether buddhism
influenced advaita or not. I am trying to find out WHAT advaita says
about the nature of "Truth".
