Hello Members :

    I was very much grieved to hear about the
insinuations made in the fraudulent work that had been
mentioned before.  How could anyone stoop so low?
We need the grace of God and Gurus, if we have any hope
of moksha.  If that is the case, we have committed a
grievous sin by tarnishing their names.  It is OK to
debate and argue on tattva but to make vieled attacks on
people ( especially Gurus and Acharyas ) ought to be
forbidden.  As a prAyachittam to the afore-mentioned sin,
I humbly request learned list members to present salutary
verses on the Advaita Guru parampara.

Let us all remember "bhava shankara deshikame sharaNam".
May He be tolerant and forgiving of our errors.
