There is also supposedly a commentary on the Anugita by
Shankaracharya.  This is also a part of the Mahabharata.

The importance of the Gita in my opinion is that Arjunas predicament
brings so many important issues together at once.

1.  What is ones responsibility to ones self? To ones family?  To society?

2.  What is the role of karma versus jnana?

3.  When is action called for and when renunciation of action?

4.  What is the nature of the Supreme?  How does one properly worship Him?

All these are important Vedantic topics so its no wonder that thinkers of
so many different views were attracted to it.
