It does not make sense to implicitly suspect Shankara of misinterpreting
(or even distorting) the salutation in the first verse as being that to
nArAyaNa, instead of the Buddha. Shankara clearly says the salutation
is to nArAyaNa. For a second opinion, we can listen to what VidvAn
Lakshmipuram Srinivasacharya, a shrIvaiShNava, is said to have written
in his book darshanodaya:

 tathaiva teShAM bhagavatpAdAnAM paramAchAryo .api ityatra AnandagirIyaM
 vachanamudAharAmaH | mANDUkyakArikAyAm-alAtashAntiprakaraNAraMbhe
 AchAryo hi purA badarikAshrame nara-nArAyaNAdhishhThite nArAyaNaM
 bhagavantamabhipretya tapo mahadatapyata| tato bhagavAnatiprasannaH
 tasmai vidyAM pradAditi prasiddhaM paramagurutva parameshvare iti
 bhAvaH |

 Similarly (as Shankara bhagavatpAda showed bhakti), his Paramaguru
 GauDapAdAchArya too (showed bhakti to ViShNu). Here we cite the
 words of Anandagiri. At the beginning of the alAta-shAnti-prakaraNa
 of the mANDUkya-kArikA, (Anandagiri comments that) GauDapAdAchArya
 performed great austerities (tapas) at BadarikAshrama, where nara
 and nArAyaNa are established, meant to (please) BhagavAn nArAyaNa.
 BhagavAn, being extremely pleased with that, bestowed the (Brahma)vidyA
 on GauDapAda. This being well-known, it means that GauDapAda's
 supreme Guru was Parameshvara (God) Himself.


Now, given the fact that shrIvaiShNavas have often characterized advaitins
as prachchhanna-bauddhas, one would expect Srinivasacharya to jump into
the prachchhanna-bauddha bandwagon upon reading the alAta-shAnti-prakaraNa,
and say "This is precisely the evidence of the Buddhist influence we were
talking about all along!" But he does not do that. He accepts the
explanation of Shankara and his commentator Anandagiri.

Suspecting Shankara and Anandagiri of misinterpreting GauDapAda, as
has been happening in this issue, makes one naive, superficial, and
perhaps un-scientific. After all, we cannot be sure that Shankara and
Anandagiri did not have access to more historical information, access
to more relevant literature,  than what we can today. There have been
too many instances of works being completely lost for ever in Indian
history. Under these circumstances, second-guessing well-known authorities
is very risky at best. At worst, it can represent some kind of a rabid
fanaticism to somehow force Buddhist influence into advaita to justify
one's personal beliefs.

 One thing has to be clear. Nowhere does Shankara deny that GauDapAda
 was not even aware of Buddha's teaching. To the contrary, GauDapAda,
 and Shankara too, had a good grasp of the views of all systems at the
 time, including Buddhism, Jainism, nyAya-vaisheShika, sAnkhya-yoga,
 mImAMsA, etc. Being knowledgeable about a system is quite different
 from an endorsement, either overt or covert, of that system.

As far as GauDapAda's usage of similar words in the first verse as
the mUlamAdhyamika-kArikA of nAgArjuna, it should not be given too
much weightage. The Bible, for example, begins with the famous words,
"In the beginning". Just because these words have a certain popularity
attached to them, someone may use the very same first words in a different
book, not necessarily having to do with religion. For example, a book
on the Internet might start: "In the beginning there was Mosaic." Now,
to assume the contents of the book are similar to those of the Bible would
be a stretch of imagination. It is quite likely that nAgArjuna's work was
well-known, not just among Buddhists, but also among others such as the
logicians, mImAMsakas, etc. It is hardly a surprise if we say GauDapAda was
aware of nAgArjuna's kArikA. GauDapAda likely was knowledgeable
on nAgArjuna, the nyAya-vaisheshhika and other systems.
