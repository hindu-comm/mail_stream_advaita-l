Please read the bhAmati yourself. VAchaspati criticizes the SarvAstivAdin
bauddhas as being of inferior intellect, the vijnAnavAdins as being of
middling intellect and lauds the MAdhyamas as of having a superior
intellect. And MAdhyamaka as a school later developed into many forms which
was not truly faithful to the original teachers of the schools - some of the
new forms were the svatantra MAdhyamaka of BhAvaviveka, the SautrAntika
vijnAnavAda of DignAga and Dharmakiirti etc. Most VedAntic criticism's are
of those schools and are not aimed at NAgArjuna.

If you notice that's what I'm trying to say out here - that the MAdhyamaka
dialectic can be used as a tool for us to have an intellectual grasp of
mAyA. Since very few of us have the guts to be real VedAntins who could
experentially understand mAyA, this is almost the only jnAnic way out.

And logic doesn't differentiate between bauddha or nyAya or modern. It is
only the conclusions that logic is used to arrive at that marks it as
specific to this or that school. According to both Advaita and the
MAdhyamaka, the phenomenal world is unreal in the ultimate sense. That's
the reason Sri Harsha has no problems about using MAdhyamaka logic.

Have you read the KArikA? The opening salute is not the only place of
reference. There are numerous other direct references to the Buddha in the
text.

Swami Jayendra Saraswati of KAnchi Matham recently said something in this
context. Asked whether Hindus should disown the Buddha since Shankara
sharply criticized him, the swami diagreed saying that somebody of the
spiritual genius of Shankara could do that and not us. When he himself, a
practicing VedAntin and an AchArya considers himself in the "us" category, I
don't think we should even talk about the subject.

And this I suppose is the trick question which is supposed to pit me against
Shankara himself and thus invalidate my arguments. Any which way you can to
win the argument, I suppose!

Anyway the answer is that Shankara himself was not a direct disciple of the
Buddha. What he knew of the Buddha's teachings was through the various
schools which had sprouted up, each claiming to teach the true message of
the Buddha. And of the numerous schools probably only two are truly close to
his teachings. And they have a lot in common with Advaita itself. But even
these two schools by the time of Shankara had flowered to various forms. And
Shankara's main criticism is against the distorted versions of the new
schools and not of the original authors themselves.

Even in your posting from Advaita Siddhi, where it is said that ShUnyavAdins
endorse momentariness, it is a plain misreading of the MAdhyamaka position.
Nowhere does NAgArjuna even endorse momentariness, infact he specifically
refutes the theory.

And can't we have an objective discussion without resorting to personal
attacks?
