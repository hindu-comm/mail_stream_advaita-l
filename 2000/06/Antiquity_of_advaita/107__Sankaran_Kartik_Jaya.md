Yes. There is absolutely no mention in GauDapaada's kArikA of key mahAyAna
concepts like shUnyata, pratItya samutpAda, etc., which establishes that
this was not meant to be a mAdhyamika text at all, but only a vedAntic
text. But I do disagree with the notion that the "Buddha" mentioned here
is NOT the historical Buddha, but a generic awakened one.

Actually, the first two verses don't claim that the Buddha taught asparsha
yoga. The second verse says that asparsha yoga is "deshitaH taM," that
which is *obtained from scripture*.

Moreover, if you see Nagarjuna's mUla madhyamaka kArikA, the invocation
reads:

deshayAmAsa saMbuddhastaM vande vadatAM varaM .
"I bow down to the Buddha... the greatest among the teachers."

The GK 4.1 reads:
GYeyAbhinnena saMbuddhastaM vande dvipadAM varaM .
"I bow down to the Buddha (whose knowledge is non-different from the
object of knowledge), the greatest among the bipeds."

They are both praising the saMbuddha, but in a different way. GauDapAda
praises the Buddha, but is very careful not to praise the Buddha's
teachings.

Again, the verse GK 4.99 reads:

kramate na hi buddhasya GYaanaM dharmeshhu taayi naH .
sarve dharmaastathaa GYaanaM naitadbuddhena bhaashhitaM ..

"The knowledge of the Buddha, who is all light, is ever untouched by
objects. All the entities as well as knowledge are also ever untouched by
any object. This was not taught by the Buddha."

Though Shankara interprets the first Buddha to mean nArAyaNa and the
second to mean the historical Buddha, it still doesn't mean that the
historical buddha is NOT being saluted in the first line. It could simply
mean that the historical Buddha can be venerated (or the *knowledge of
the Buddha* can be venerated) as nArAyaNa without necessarily accepting
his teachings.
