 I don't have to reply to your nonsensical remarks wherein you basically
 question the integrity of virtually everyone in the advaita tradition
 starting from GauDapAda and Shankara, with no ryhme or reason.
 But I will try again.

 No that is not the point here. The point is that he accepts the fact
 GauDapAda salutes nArAyaNa, not the Buddha. There is nothing either
 implicit nor explicit about supremacy of bhakti or jnAna here.

 This is the nonsensical questioning of integrity I was talking about
 above. The Anandagiri I was referring to is the one who has written
 commentaries on all the major upaniShad bhAShyas of Shankara, the
 gItAbhAShya of Shankara, and the sUtra-bhAShya too. Anandagiri's
 glosses are pretty standard in advaita. But then, what is the point
 in convincing one who thinks the whole of advaita tradition from
 GauDapAda and Shankara is lacking in integrity so as to cover
  up the Buddhist influence, so as to lie about key teachers in
 their line, etc.?

 Anand
