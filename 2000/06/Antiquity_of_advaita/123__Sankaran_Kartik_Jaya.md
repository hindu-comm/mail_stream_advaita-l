Ramana Maharshi has said that "GYAna and bhakti are one and the same."
True bhakti IS knowledge of the Self.

Shankara interprets most of the GItA verses on bhakti to the Ishvara
(especially 18.66) as surrender to the Self.

The VivekachuuDAmaNi defines bhakti as "seeking to know the Self."

Not all bhakti is dual in nature; this is only bhakti of a lower form.
Bhakti of a higher form is Atma vichAra. At the highest level, to the
GYAnii, bhakti is the Self.
