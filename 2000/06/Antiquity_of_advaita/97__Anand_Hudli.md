 Could you explain these remarks with explicit quotes please? Else,
 they will have to be taken as outright distortions aimed at
 confusing the minds of the gullible on the list.

 I will make some specific points here. Try to answer them if you will.

 1) In the words of
 Anantakrishna Sastri, one of the great scholars of advaita in the 20th
 century, he speaks of mAdhyamika or shUnyavAda (I quote) "...tanmataM
 dUShitaM bhAmatInyAratnAvalyAdau vistareNa" (foot note on page 142 -
 advaita-siddhi, parimal publications), "...that system has been
 refuted in detail by works such as bhAmatI, nyAyaratnAvalI, etc."
 And guess who the author of bhAmatI is? VAchaspati Mishra himself.
 So now we have a problem. Pt. Anantakrishna Sastri says VAchaspati
 Mishra has refuted mAdhyamika in his bhAmatI whereas you say that
 the same VAchaspati openly lauds mAdhyamika. Who should we believe?
 Please solve this problem for us!

 2) You are right that shrIharshha uses Buddhist logic to refute
    nyAya theories. But he is very clear in showing his allegiance to
    vedAnta! The conclusion is he uses the techbiques only as a tool,
    to put forth his own thesis of vedAnta. It is possible to put forth
    the advaita doctrine using modern logic. Would doing so mean that
    we are somehow indebted to the western logicians? No it doesn't.
    To argue for advaita, we can use Buddhist logic, modern logic or
    some other technique. Buddhist logic is NOT indispensable, not even
    necessary.

 3) As far as GauDapAda saluting Buddha, nothing can be farther from
   the truth. His salute to "dvipadAM varaM" has been shown by Shankara
   to refer to nArAyaNa Himself. And we have the concurrence of the
   shrIvaiShNava scholars on this point as well. GauDapAda salutes
   nArAyaNa in his kArikA, not Buddha. (Of course, you may argue that
   Buddha was considered an avatar of ViShNu, but that point is irrelevant
   here.)

 4) Speaking of Shankara, we are yet to see brilliant claims   of  his
    worshipping Buddha. While you are working on this, please explain
    why Shankara is so sharply critical of EVERY school of Buddhism in
    his sUtra-bhAShya. Concluding his refutation of Buddhism with the sUtra
   "sarvathAnupapatteshcha", Shankara says "na kAMchidapyatropapattiM
    pashyAmaH", " we do not see any (logical) propriety here (in
    Buddhism)." Shankara means that Buddhism is logically flawed. He
    says the Buddha taught mutually contradictory theories either because
    he was so terribly incoherent in his teachings or because he really
    wished to harm his followers by confusing them. The question I have
    is: should we then conclude based on what your insight in mAdhyamika
    provides us that Shankara was incapable of understanding what the
    Buddha meant, something that you have been able to accomplish?

 Preaching that it has no doctrine is itself a preaching!

 On what basis do you conclude this? Again, specific facts please.

 Wrong. Please see MadhusUdana's arguments on this topic.

  It doesn't change the fact Buddhism should be viewed as logically
  flawed. advaita is certainly not prachchhanna-bauddha-mata but
  that does not mean we have to accept Buddhism inspite of the solid
  refutation of it by our AchAryas.

 Do you mean mAyA has been misunderstood by advaitins themselves?
 Again, I am looking for specific evidence in this regard.

 Please stop preaching tolerance. This has nothing to do with that.
 It is not that the list has never discussed Buddhism. In fact, it has
 been discussed ad-nauseum as some would recall. Tolerance is one thing,
 being obsessed with Buddhism is quite another. Some amount of comparative
 discussion is OK but outright distortions of views of the likes of
 GauDapAda, VAchaspati, and others should not be tolerated. In fact,
 my suggestion is to be intolerant of distortions.
