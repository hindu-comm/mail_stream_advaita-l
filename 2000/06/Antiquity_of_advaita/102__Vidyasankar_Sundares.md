Note that a frequent phrase used in Advaita texts is
nity-;suddha-buddha-mukta, e.g. gItAbhAshya. Refers to I;svara in some
       ^^^^^^^^
places, to the sAkshI-caitanya in other places, to the jIvanmukta in yet
other instances. No reference to the Buddha as a person. We have to look at
the context of reference v. carefully.
