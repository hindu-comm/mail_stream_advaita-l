On the contrary I think this quite relevant and important evidence.  A
third party without a personal stake in the matter can provide a lot of
insight.

Then the Advaita acharyas are also guilty of undermining the Jnana
tradition!  Because with a single voice they have stressed the importance
of Bhakti as a complement to both the Karma _and_ Jnana margas.

Have you been reading my translation of part of the Vasishtasangrah?  When
the self is worshipped as possessing the lordly attributes, that too is
bhakti.  To go the otherway and see ones self in the Lord is also
Bhakti.  Devotion to the Guru (Shri Narayana is the Adiguru) is also
Bhakti.  None of these things are in anyway incompatible with Jnana marga.

Please read the Gudarthadipika or Bhaktirasayana of Swami Madhusudan
Saraswati.

Only some kinds of Bhakti.

And knowledge is attained how?  Bhakti is one of the ways and it has the
approval of all the Acharyas.  Whoever the dvipadam varam is why is
Gaudapadacharya "saluting" Him?  Isn't salutation a form of Bhakti?
