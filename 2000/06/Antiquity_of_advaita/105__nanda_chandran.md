Doesn't "idam Buddhe ne bAshitam", in GaudapAdiya KArikA refer to the
Buddha? Or does it mean, " This was not taught by 'God' "?

Or does it mean that here it refers to the Buddha, because here GaudapAda
says something negative about the Buddha. And in other instances in the same
text where "Buddha" is praised, the Buddha refers to NArAyanA?
