Dear Nanda,

I do believe your earnestness in this study. To make the dialogue more
objective you should support your claims with relevant quotes (if
possible from the  original work). That way people will know who said
what? Otherwise you claims have little value. At least, I will not take
it seriously. Also things like from my experiences (meditation, etc.)
will not sell either. I am not suspecting or questioning your
experience. They are subjective. To make this thread objective, you
have to be objective in the first place and add more rigor to your
points. To support your thesis with actual quotes may take a lot of
your time. But it will be useful  (at least to you) in the long run.

This is my last response to this thread. Personally, I have no interest
in investing my time to learn mAdhyamika.

My good wishes to you. My intention is not to offend you. If I have
done so without my knowledge, I apologize for it.

Thanks.

Regards,

Ravi
