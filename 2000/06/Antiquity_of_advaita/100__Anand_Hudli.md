 This is a distortion of VAchaspati's position. He does not laud
 mAdhyamika nor does he leave ANY school of Buddhism unscathed to
 his criticism. I will post shortly VAchaspati's conclusive remarks on
 ALL of Buddhism which includes the whole nine yards - Buddha, mAdhyamika,
 and what have you.

 You have NOT answered my question above but from your response I can gather
 that you are right and Pt. Anantakrsihna Sastri is not. Right?

 What  you say here is slightly more acceptable, for a change! The
 main contribution of Buddhist logic in India was the formalization
 of techniques such as the syllogism, etc.  I agree to this.  But the
 basic Buddhist theories were logically unsound, as Shankara says.  I
 disagree that we need to make an indepth study of the mAdhyamika
 kArikA to know this, unless we are interested in refuting it!
 Once the formalization was introduced it was later assimilated
 and developed further in nyAya. So what we have in nyAya, especially
 navya nyAya is the most formalized version that you will EVER see in
 the entire history of Indian thought as of today.  The utility of
 Buddhist logic during shrIharshha's time was higher than it was after
 the formalization in nyAya. shrIharshha did not have a choice because
 he could not perhaps find a better tool to counter the nyAya theories.
 And the utility of Buddhist logic today, with the development of
 formal (western) logic is questionable. It may be of historical
 interest, certainly not of much use to advaitins. It is not necessary.

 Yes, I have read the kArikA. But I am amazed at your distortion again.
 First you said GauDapAda salutes Buddha repeatedly. Now we are led
 to  believe there is an opening salute and numerous direct *references*
 to Buddha. To this I reply as follows:

 The word "God" is a sacred word in all of Bible. It appears numerous
 times. Now, almost any non-Christian religious literature translated
 into English will contain the word "God" in numerous places, may be
 even thousands of times. For example,  "bhagavAn" in Sanskrit or
 Hindi becomes "God" in translation. Fast forward in time. Someone
 finds a translated version of a text of what is now a nonchristian
 religion, 500 years from now. Let us say he finds a translated gItA.
 That person also has  the Bible. Looking at the translated version of
 the gItA  and comparing it with the Bible he sees that the gItA makes
 numerous references to "God". So he concludes the gItA was deeply
 influenced by Christianity! Beautiful conclusion, isn't it?
 Now come back to the present. The word "Buddha" means "a wise person",
 "an intelligent person" etc. Maybe due to the strong influence of
 Buddhism on Indian culture (after all it had political backing for
 quite some time), the word "Buddha" came to be used very commonly
 among all religions, including writings in the Sanskrit language.
 I am not saying it was introduced into Sanskrit. It just became
 more commonly used in Sanskrit as a common noun to indicate a wise
 person. It is in this sense we must take the word "Buddha" , the wise,
 as used by AchArya GauDapAda. Otherwise, we will be guilty of the same
 mistake that our fellow human being may make in the future when he
 looks at the gItA. When PrabhupAda declares Krishna to be the Supreme
 Personality of Godhead, we cannot accuse him of preaching Christianity
 in disguise because he repeated uses the words "God", "Godhead",
 "heaven", and so on.

 GauDapAda uses the word "Buddha", but as Shankara's commentary shows
 it is to be taken as a common noun, "Buddha", not the person Buddha,
 just as we do not consider the word "God" to stand for the God of
 the Christians alone but God in general in any religion.

 I would let other more familiar with the Kanchi Math to verify this.
 All the Swami means is that we should respect Buddha, as a
 great person, or perhaps as an avatar, since that is the Hindu stand on
 Buddha. I agree to this. We should respect a lot of other
 people like KaNAda, Gautama, MahAvIra, George Washington, etc.
 It does NOT mean that we should accept everything that these great
 people said without critical analysis and without examining the
 utility of their sayings to us.

 No, that is not true. Shankara's refutation is of the WHOLE of
 Buddhism, including Buddha, his followers, and the various systems
 that had started from the Buddha upto the time of Shankara himself.

 So basically you are refuting Shankara himself without any basis.
 Seldom have I seen such arrogance on this list.

 Again, I have to ask the question: Whom are we to believe as the
 correct interpretation of MAdhyamika? You or MadhusUdana/BrahmAnanda?

 Sure.  Stop making personal attacks on GauDapAda, Shankara, and
 the other AchAryas. Stop presenting your views as their views. Is this
 too much to ask for?
