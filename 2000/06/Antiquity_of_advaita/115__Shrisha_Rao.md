Just as an aside, in `Gaudapada: A Study in Early Advaita', T.M.P
Mahadevan suggests that there were "probably" multiple Anandagiri-s, on
the grounds that Anandagiri the commentator on Sureshvara bR^ihad-vArtika
seems to accept GK I as Shruti, while Anandagiri the commentator on
GK-bhAshhya does does not seem to.  I personally disagree with Mahadevan
in this and other instances in matters of textual analysis.
