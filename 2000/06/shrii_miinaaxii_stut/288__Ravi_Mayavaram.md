 Worship shrii miinaaxii whose breasts defeat the mastaka(forehead) of
elephants in beauty, whose waist is bent due to the weight of HER
breasts, whose reddened eyes has brought HER consort shiva under HER
control, whose
red lips excel the beauty of coral and the smile (revealing the
bright teeth) on HER red lips drive away the beauty of the Lord of
naxatra-s (chandra)

HER eyes are like that of fish is referred to by the names miinaaxii,
miinalochanii, miinanetrii etc. It is said so because the tradition
holds that fishes do not blink their eyes to protect their young
ones. Likewise ambaaL does not blink to protect the universe. For the
universe is created when SHE opens the eyes and perishes when SHE
closes it (dR^ishhTi-sR^ishhTi vaadam). In this context please refer
to the sahasranaama "unmeshha nimishhotpanna vipanna bhuvanaavaLii"
and the saundarya laharii verse "nimishonmeshhabhyaaM praLayaM udayaM
yaati jagati"

Worship miinaaxii who is filled with the nectar of compassion from
feet to  head, whose lotus feet is  worshipped by sages (those who
have curse alone as their weapon), who has a bow made of sugarcane,
who resides in kadamba forests, and who removes the impurities like
kaama
from the mind.
