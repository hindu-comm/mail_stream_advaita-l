Dear members,

This part got left out, when I sent it the second time:

Disclaimer:
I have picked up sections of mails from different authors.  I hope I have
not quoted any of them out of context.  If I have done so, please accept my
apologies for that was my intention.  If you choose to respond, please state
where I have misquoted your respective statements and I will withdraw them
without any resistance.

Shri Jaldharji,

I am aware that I have to explain to you about "experience becoming stale"
part of the mail.  I am thinking of asking another question to the members
and I will make it a point to answer your question there as it seems more
appropriate there.  I will remember that I owe you an explanation.

Regards.
