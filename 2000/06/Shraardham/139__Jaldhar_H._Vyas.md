Advaita Vedanta is not just a theory but also a practical method of
achieving the goals of that theory.  Therefore any questions about those
practical matters also fall within the purview of this list.  As Vedanta
is firmly based on the Vedas and the Vedas and subsidiary shastras command
the performance or avoidance of various actions, which can impact the
practice of Advaita Vedanta, questions relating to them also fall within
the scope of this list.

Clarification here, the appearance and interpretation of the world is a
projection of your mind.  There is certainly something realgoing on
underneath, what we may think it is is mistaken that's all.

In samsara, various actions take place and the Vedas enjoin and prohibit
other actions to enhance or counteract them.  But for the knower of
Brahman actions and their effects are illusinary so there is no need to do
them.  Who is this Knower Of Brahman?  Not someone who just knows the word
but the one who is completely established and immersed in Brahman.  Such a
person is the sannyasi.  By sannyasi, we don't necessarily mean the person
in a orange robe with a staff etc. though I hope they have taken up
that ashram with a view to renunciation in mind, but the person who has
given up all actions.  Such a person even if a grhastha will upon
realizing the truth become a sannyasi.  Conversely any person who is
worried about family, car, mortgage etc. is not a jnani.  Even if they
claim to not be interested in worldly things, as long as they remain in
the world, there is an unbrigeable gap between them and Brahman.  It is
only the sannyasi (actually only the grade of sannyasi called paramahansa
) who can legitmately give forsake duties.  For everyone else the
injunctions and prohibitions of the shastras have full force.  End of
story.

"It's too hard" is not a valid reason to abandon ones obligations,

What consists of a "sound philosophy."?

You didn't answer the question I posed to you before.  Does experience go
stale after a long period of time?

No.  If there is one, why would you ned another?
