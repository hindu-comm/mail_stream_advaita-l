OM,

Shraadham, is basically for the upliftment of the offsprings, according to
the shruthis, well, garuda purana, gives a different version, which is a
small horror work by itself

I remembered a joke , which a shastrigal i know told me,

he jokingly said sraddam, is not of the deceased, but of the living in the
present day....ha ha

how true and also  such a pity

hariom
