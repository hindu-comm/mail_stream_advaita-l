Sorry for the delay in responding.  You've asked some very pertinent
questions and I wanted to give you a thorough answer.  Please say so if I
haven't.

I'm a busy professional with commitments etc.  According to my time sheet
last week I spent 52 hours on the job.  Add an extra 1 !/2 hours a day for
commuting and we're up to 59 1/2 hours.  That leaves us with what
107-108?  Now my nitya karma takes about an hour a day altogether.  Add an
extra hour a day for svadhyaya.  Altogether I am being asked to give up 14
hours out of 108. And actually this is a high amount because the
svadhyaya can be done on the train during a break etc.  Is this really too
much even for busy professionals?   If one counts up the time spent in
watching TV  or other frivolous activities it will probably come up to
more time.  But each of us has to make the choice.  Is Bhagawan more
important or "Frazier"?  Whatever choice one makes the responsibility lies
with oneself, you cannot say "modern life made me do it." In fact modern
life can help rather than hinder.  (You can use the VCR to tape "Frazier"
:-)

I find the purchase of a house difficult for genuine reasons.  (Not enough
money for a mortgage yet :-)  I don't think anyone would expect me to not
bother buying a house or to live in a shipping crate and call it a house.
Instead the expected course of behavior would be to work hard and save
until I did have the money.  Why is it not possible to make a similar
investments of time and effort in ones spiritual life?

Again, is this any different from any other field of human endeavor?  A
person who doesn't know biology will find becoming a doctor daunting.  If
they don't know law, becoming a lawyer will be daunting.

Modern life makes it _easier_ to do ones duty with shastraic precision.  A
few hundred years ago if one wanted to learn some work he would either
have to memorize the whole thing or laboriously copy it out by hand.  I've
seen some of these old manuscripts, they are often fragile, incomplete,
and rife with spelling mistakes.  Nowadays we have high-quality printed
books.  If we don't own them ourselves, most major cities have public
libraries where we can read and if we don't have that, many works can be
found on the Internet which has now spread to the furthest corner of the
globe.  Learned people are more accessible too via phone, fax, radio, tv,
and now email.

Despite all this those people who really want an excuse not to do things
will find them no matter what we say or do.  The only thing that sort will
get from me is contempt.  But I'll help anyone who is genuinely interested
in overcoming obstacles to a fuller Dharmic life.

>  For eg., one living in say a

By comparison the Kathiawad region of Gujarat where my family comes from
chronically suffers from drought.  Even the daily snana becomes a hardship
for some people but they still try to do it.  There is little in life you
can assure.  What Bhagawan asks is that you try your best.

Then they shouldn't do that then. It is hardly inevitable that people will
marry outside their faith and if they intentionally do things like that
why should we chase after them?

Tradition is always decaying.  Time is not depicted as the all-destroying
Mahakala for nothing.  Each generation has to renew the vitality of the
tradition.  If we look at our history, there have been other periods where
the vitality of tradition has ebbed.  Our duty is to this moment.  Can we
make traditional vital now.  My answer is yes we can.

Certainly if Dharma is looked upon as a burden for which "shortcuts" need
to be taken people are only shooting themselves in the foot.  The key is
enthusiasm for Dharma.  I know lots of second-generation Gujaratis who are
proud of their religion and active in it.  Often they come from quite
humble backgrounds but their parents have managed to communicate to them
love and enthusiasm for their culture.  I should point out that many of
them are Vaishnavas.  However much we may criticize them for other things,
in this case they are far ahead of us.

Advaitins are often mesmerized by gimmicks and mystical babble instead of
hard facts.  Recently we had a person on this list claiming Sanskrit is
the ideal language for Artificial Intelligence.  Sanskrit has many
noteworthy feature but that statement was blatantly untrue.  When I said
that, he decided to quit the list.  I guess he was more in love with the
idea of Indian culture being great than actually knowing how it is great.
Are such fools capable of passing along values and traditions to future
generations?

There are many ways to remedy the lack of knowledge.  The question should
be why or why aren't people employing those remedies?  This isn't a matter
of philosophy so much as sociology.

I know a person from one of Gujarats' most learned Brahman families.  In
fact his father and grandfather were Agnihotris, the highest level of
Vedic ritualists.  But growing up in the 50s-60s this person just couldn't
see a future in that.  He ended up becoming an atheist and repudiating
everything to do with his culture.  Why?  Because modernism presented
itself as being the rational, objective culmination of all the previous
modes of thought that came before it but it turned out it was just another
culture with biases etc. of its' own.  Grand modernist projects like
communisism turned out to be dismal failures.  Democracy triumphed but
Democracy is studiously neutral on cultural matters.  Sometimes I struggle
to even understand the thought processes of the immigration generation.
They were prepared to make all kinds of accomodations to modern life.
I live a modern life to but it doesn't clash with my spiritual life.  If
it did, i'd be more likely to file a lawsuit than to acommodate!

In Gujarat at least I know that non-dwija castes such as Lohanas and
Patels also do shraddha albeit not in precisely the same form as Brahmans
do.

This is a topic that is much discussed in tarkashastra where it is called
mangalavada.  The shastras declare that any work should begin with
managalacharana or dedicatory verses for the purpose of ensuring the
success of the work.  If so, our sages asked, how is it that the atheists
write texts successfully without any invocation but to give one stock
example the Kadambari of Bana Bhatta (a famous Sanskrit novel) is
incomplete because the author died while writing it despite having
composed an elaborate mangalacharana?

I'll post later some of the discussion on this but a brief summary is that
even those that do not formally put a mangalacharana implicitly have
one. (The word atha that begins a text can serve as it.)  They may
haphazardly be able to get results but we who have clear instructions from
our sages know the theory as well as the practice so we have specific
things we do to get results.  I believe we can extrapolate this line of
thinking to shraddha etc.

Our shastras say that Bharat is the punyabhumi and karmabhumi.  However
what is Bharat?  Not just the Modern state of India, history shows the
boundaries of Bharata have expanded and contracted quite a bit.  I am
reminded of a Gujarati saying "Jya jya vase ek Gujarati tya vase
Gujarat."  Where one  Gujarati lives is Gujarat.  The meaning is that
wherever Gujaratis' go (and they have roamed around a lot compared to
other Indian ethnic groups.) they recreate the culture and institutions of
their home.  (and all the bickering and politics too but that's another
story :-)  That should be the attitude to take. With effort, America can
also become a karmabhumi and punyabhumi.   Your Pandit suffers from
the same problem as the young professionals you mentioned earlier.  He
treats the world as if it was some fixed thing.  If you however accept the
notion that the world is maya, it is infinitely malleable.

No only for the space of one birth.  You are not expected to do shraddha
for all your previous incarnations.

See above.

This is the purpose of Smrti.  Shruti gives the basic commands such as
to do shraddha, then our sages determined how it was to be done.

But a woman does do it in the senses that she (and other family members)
should be present or at least give her assent when the head of the
household does it.  It is like when the President makes some policy
decision, it is done in my name and all the other US citizens even if
we're not actually personally involved.

Yes it is quite enough but as other posts have pointed out just talking
about Advaita does not constitute "waking up".

Because the underlying point of chitta-shuddhi is to get rid of
self interest.  If we know something is to be done, we should just do it
without thinking about what would be more or less convenient.

The postulate can only be accepted if sadhake == sannyasin.  Only the
sannyasin can give up karma.  Because Karma doesn't mean just religious
action but _all_ actions.

The pitrs reach their position through whatever merit they have earned and
when that punya is exhausted they fall once again.

Due to the non-performance of shraddha the pitrs fall to Hell.  One

Hell called pu-narka.

existence through the efforts of our parents.

For the spirit of anything to be upheld, effort must be put into it.  This
applies to rockets and stock markets as much as to Dharma.  The shastras
do give options for people in difficult circumstances.  The question we
have to ask ourselves is one of attitude.  Are we approaching the shastras
as an accountant would approach the tax code just looking for loopholes
and legalities?  Then even if we are punctillious in observance we will
not maintain its spirit.  The danger on the other side is if we get so
pedantic we don't see flexibility as an option even if it is
legitimate.  That's why we need to be as well educated as possible
ourselves and listen intently to those who are more learned than us.

Sometimes those who have heard these questions 1000 times can feel a
little jaded but actually questioners like yourself should be
thanked.  This is what has kept our ideals fresh and vital all these
years.  As long as we keep on learning and analyzing we have no reason to
fear for the survival of the Vedic tradition.  So please keep on learning
and doing and I'm sure I speak for all the members of the list when I say
we are ready to help you in any way we can.
