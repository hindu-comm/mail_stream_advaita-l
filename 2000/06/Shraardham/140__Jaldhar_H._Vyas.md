A very bad state of affairs.  Shankaracharya and his successors completely
denounce the idea that karma and jnana can be mixed.

It seems to me if the householders were that poor they wouldn't be chasing
money to the ends of the earth.  If we are getting richer and richer why
quibble over giving the learned scholars their due?  If we allow colleges
(Harvard for instance has a billion dollar endowment yet charges the
highest fees of any educational institution.  There education is good but
not that good,) governments (do you think every penny you pay in taxes is
properly spent?), and businesses to "fleece" us (what is the profit motive
if not "fleecing"?) why should anyone all of a sudden get worked up about
the relatively modest demands of some shastri?  Take a look at the
situation in Northern India.  For one reason or another they did not
support their scholar and has it made them better or more educated?  The
opposite in fact.  South Indians should thank God every day that your
Pandits are economically sound enough to continue and foster our ancient
traditions.  I'm not suggesting there aren't con men but the best way to
handle them is to not let them have the upper hand.  A local clothing
store has the slogan "An educated consumer is our best customer."  This
adage is doubly true in spiritual matters.  But insisting that shastris
should somehow exempt themselves from normal economics is an invitation to
disaster.

First of all it is not the soul (which needs no feeding) but the bodies of
the pitrs which need to be fed.  Your question is a variant of one which
is asked in the Mimamsa shastra (and discussed in the Brahmasutras too I
think.)  If we accept that a particular God will be present in a yajna to
accept the offerings, how is it possible for someone to perform a yajna to
let's say Indra in place A and for someone in place B to do so at the same
time.  Indra cannot be in two places at once can he?  The answer given if
I recall correctly is that we should not assume the Gods have the
restriction of mortals.  Indra can take up two bodies and be in A and B at
the same time.  The main function the Gods is to accept offerings.
Extrapolating from this, what is to prevent the Pitrs from being in
multiple places at the same time to receive the offering which is their
main function?

>From the Vedantic point of view karma should be given up completely, no
ifs or buts.  If for some reason it cannot, it cannot be practised
half-heartedly.  It must be performed diligently with no interest in loss
or reward and be offered as a sacrifice to Bhagawan.

Given the Advaita position as outlined above where is the room for
debate?  Either take sannyasa or follow your Dharma diligently.  These ae
the only two choices.

I certainly don't want to dissuade you from your quest but in the meantime
you should not stand still.
