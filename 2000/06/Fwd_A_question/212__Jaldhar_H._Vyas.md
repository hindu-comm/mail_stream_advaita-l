Definitely the home.  Every person has a personal responsibility to
perform the required rituals in the appropriate manner.  No one can do
them for him.  And as home is where you spend most of your time, this
is where the personal worship should take place.

The benefit of the temple is that is a place where one can be in contact
with other devotees.  This is called satsang.  When people pray together
with devotion it will enhance the effect.
