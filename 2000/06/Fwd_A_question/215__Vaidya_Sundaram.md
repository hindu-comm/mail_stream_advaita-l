 There are several references to temple worship in the Ramayana. For
example, when King Dasharatha dies and the entire country is in mourning,
Bharata is brought back from his uncle's palace - during his return
journey, he notices that the temples are all closed with no service being
done - this makes him wonder what is wrong with the kingdom at the time -
there are other references as well - for example, when Kausalya makes a vow
to propitiate the deities of all the temples in Ayodhya when Rama returns
safely etc ...
