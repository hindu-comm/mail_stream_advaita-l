namaskaram.

 i wish to briefly point out parts of an earlier discussion on this list
which revolved around the use and limits of logic. The discussion happened
sometime around the first week or so of Feb 2000 - you could search for it
...

In order to distinguish Shri. SVS's notes from the earlier post from Feb
2000, the following is in >>

I hope this above piece says it all! In my understanding, this is what Shri
Vidyashankar was pointing out as well.
I hope to send an more elaborate post at a later time ...
