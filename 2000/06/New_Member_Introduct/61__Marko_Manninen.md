Just twisting your statement

All the knowledge accumulates through refinement of characters and through
the most refinement character, Supreme God. Knowlegde that is available is
made so only for peoples, that cannot reach the ultimate because of not so
refinement character (and i suppose only one of billion doesnt go to this
category). Thats why there are directions and principles, all great
teachers gave something for their conteporary and they wouldnt talk if
they saw that anyone wouldnt need instructions. Only futile speculations
of scriptures were rejected, but never instructions. Its true that Buddha
did concentrate to his final meditation like fish on the dry land, but it
is also true, that he had most superius life and work done in earlier
incarnations.

But still after saying that only refinement of character and hard work
develops intuitions toward truth. My daily hour of prayer includes: if You
are so mercy that this little request makes my friend liberated and perfect
in knowlege and love, please be so, but if not, give us strength to make
road straight and wander it happily and victoriously.

>>If you reach "there" before me, help me out too !!<<

I love your statement :-)

I did download Kenopanishad and Sandhya.  I read a few pages of both.  They
are immaculate (although I have to read further).  I am very impressed by
the amount of research you might have put in to acquire the knowledge that
you have.

I certainly have not delved so deep into the Vedas, which is why I am trying
to learn now (subscribing to this list is part of the effort).  Please
accept my apologies for arguing without putting the needed effort/homework.

I will take a recess from this topic that we were discussing and will go
through your work a little and get back to you with doubts.  I recommend
other members of the list also to read Shri Daveji's work the location of
which is in his mail below.

I am reminded of H.W.Longfellow's poem when looking at your work:

Lives of great men all remind us
We can make our lives sublime,
And, departing, leave behind us
Footprints on the sands of time;
                                                 .
Footprints, that perhaps another,
Sailing o'er life's solemn main,
A forlorn and shipwrecked brother,
Seeing, shall take heart again.
                                                 .
Let us, then, be up and doing,
With a heart for any fate;
Still achieving, still pursuing,
Learn to labor and to wait.

With deep respects to you Shri Daveji.
