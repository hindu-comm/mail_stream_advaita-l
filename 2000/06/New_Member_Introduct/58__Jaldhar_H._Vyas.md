I am not at all offended that you are expressing your honest
feelings.  This is preferable to keeping silent.  I am however going to
explain to you why you are wrong :-)

The Vasishtasangrah has a beautiful metaphor of a deer caught in
quicksand.  When it realizes its predicament, its impulse is to kick and
struggle.  But the more it flails about the deeper it sinks.  If it could
remain still, there would be a chance to pull itself out.

Yes mumukshutva (the desire for mukti) is very important but how to go
about fulfilling that desire is indeed a matter of "clever planning."  A
young person may decide to become wealthy.  But if he goes to university
and gets trained in some proession, he may face hardship for a while but
he is more likely to achieve his goal than if he just rushes out and gets
the first job he can find.  If a seeker is aware that he/she is lacking
information and means to achieve their goals than it is most prudent for
them to tread carefully and methodically.  What's the rush?  There is all
the time in the world!
