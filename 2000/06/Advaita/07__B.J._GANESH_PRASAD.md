Although agreeable on what Mr. Ramachandran says, i beg to differ on his
view on Advaitha and Dvaitha.

Dvaitha, connotates the dual conceptualization of the self and brahma, which
is therefore the basis for Advaitha.

there cannot be Advaitha without Dvaitha in the beginning, as Karmakhanda,
eluciates (Ref: Mimamsa Sutravali, no 5) the need for action. All action
necessarily indicates Dualism, with a Karta and Kartvya. The Shankara
Bhashya on Bhagavad Geetha, clearly illustrates this point.

Advaita and Dvaita are not just Adjectives, Gauda pada Karikas and
Vivekachudamani, and also Vedantha Paribhasha speaks about the meaning of these
terms. They are interpretated on the same importance associated to Brahman.
