I understand what you are saying however I see one problem.  Even after
one realizes the inadequacy of the dualistic concept, is the development
of an Advaita view the natural outcome?  Not necessarily I think.
Vishishtadvaita also purports to solve this problem.  Even amongst
monists, Kashmiri Shaivas and Buddhists give different answers.  Which
answer is correct?  How will we determine this?

Please write something on how these sages have defined Advaita vs Dvaita
It would help this discussion tremendously.
