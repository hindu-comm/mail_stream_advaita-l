Greetings Jaldhar:

Thanks bringing out my pitfalls and I appreciate you for taking time to
respond.  I suggest that you visit the Website:
<http://www.math.csusb.edu/history/public_html/Mathematicians/Panini.html>

and go over all the references before you make your judgement. Few years
back, an article appeared in Nature on Panini relating the relevance of
Sanskrit Grammer and Artificial Intelligence. I don't have any reference and
since you are an expert in computers and also Sanskrit, I suggest that you
should be able to get the reference.

There are two sides to all intellectual arguements (similar to the coin) and
let us not make judgements based on incomplete facts.

regards,

Ram Chandran

I can understand why a computer scientist would appreciate the logic of
Panini (Thats how I got interested in Sanskrit) but they would be sadly
mistaken if they thought it would help with "artificial intelligence" at
all. The sutras address syntax which is fairly easy for a computer-even
for a messy unsystematic language like English.  The "intelligence" part
of artificial intelligence is in semantics and that the sutras hardly deal
with.

Unfortunately a big problem in Indian society these day is people like to
sit around and congratulate themselves on how ancient and profound their
culture is but they don't want to take the trouble to actually learn what
it is saying!
