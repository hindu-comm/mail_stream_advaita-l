sarvebhyo namaH,
       I am studying the mANDUkya and gaudapada-kArikA
with the shAnkarabhAShya. In the introduction to the
translation (not in the BhaShya itself), there is a
mention of some opinions of other Acharyas, who
considered the Agama PrakaraNa to be shruti. shrii
shankara does not think so. Could learned members
throw more light on this topic ?

Thank you,
Raghavendra.
