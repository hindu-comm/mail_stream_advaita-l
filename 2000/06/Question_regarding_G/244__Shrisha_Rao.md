The semantic separation between the first set from the Agama-prakaraNa,
and the rest, that you are suggesting is not there in the material itself.
In any case, I have not seen Mahadevan, et al. make any such argument.

That is roughly the position taken by Mahadevan also, but the following
objections are possible:

 1> The B.U. quote (and other instances where `AptakAma' may have
    occurred) does not suit the context of the sUtra; under `lokavat.h tu
    lIlAkaivalyam.h' the interest is in the Creator of the world whose
    actions are not out of any self-interest.  A look at the B.U. comm.
    of Shankara shows that he does not regard the `AptakAma' therein
    to be a referent to the world-Creator's actions.  Certainly,
   `devaisyaishha svabhAvo.ayaM AptakAmasya kA spR^ihA?' is a much better
    vishhaya-vAkya than just `AptakAma', leaving aside the wrangling
    over whether it should be one at all.

 2> One is setting oneself up as a better exponent of Advaita than
    Appayya, in your style of reasoning.  Although generally one may
    feel that the commentator's have inserted their own views and
    ignored or misinterpreted the master's position (this is a sentiment
    I find only among Advaitins, and it continues to be surprising to me),
    in this specific instance I don't see why Appayya should be
    dismissed outright.

 3> Another commentary, the brahmavidyAbharaNa, also cites the same verse
    in this context (I have independently verified this since making the
    postings in '98; the reference isn't in the list).

 4> There are two major traditions of interpreting the sUtra II-1-33; one,
    followed by Ramanuja and some others gives the example of a king
    playing ball, and says the Creator's actions are out of sport.  The
    other stream, followed by Shankara, Madhva, Srikantha, and Baladeva,
    criticizes the king-playing-ball analogy and says sport as a motive
    is impossible according to the sUtrakAra.  The latter invariably
    give `AprakAmasya kA spR^ihA' as the vishhaya-vAkya, while the former
    are content to rest on their analogy and give none.  No one gives
    a quote from the B.U. as the vishhaya-vAkya.  Barring some solid
    reasons, the suggestion for an unseen vishhaya-vAkya is not readily
    acceptable.
