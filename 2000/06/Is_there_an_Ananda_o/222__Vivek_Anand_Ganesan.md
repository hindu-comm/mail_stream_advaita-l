Many thanks to ShrI VidyaShankar for pointer to his post
in another list.  The primary reason I asked that question
is because many people have come to associate ---ananda as
a sannyasin name ( in fact it has become trivialized in
popular connotation which is regrettable ).

  Thanks again for your answer.

-Vivek.
