Please respond to List for advaita vedanta as taught by Shri Shankara
      <ADVAITA-L at braincells.com>

Some Vaishnava Acharyas say that Paundraka represent the Mayavadi Vedantins
who say Aham brahmaasmi without really understanding meaning of that
Mahavakya. Some say that he represents the false Vaishnava gurus who pose to
their devotees as Krishna incarnate.

>  Dear Himanshu Prabhuji, YES, indeed you have correctly identified my purpose
behind sending this question.  This is what exactly we have been taught by our
ISKCON masters ( as U mentioned above).  I sincerely thank U for the efforts you
have putin to clarify my doubts.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
