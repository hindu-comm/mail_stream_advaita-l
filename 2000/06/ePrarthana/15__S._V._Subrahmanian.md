What is the view of the net-members about this cyber-prArthanA ?  Can any
good come out of sending some money to some pundit in some remote temple and
hoping that salvation will drop on our lap ?  Is not personal effort more
important ?

Without any attempts at "chitta shuddhi" can Shiva pooja be of any use ???
Even though Shiva pooja can cause circumstances for "chitta shuddhi", does
it not take personal effort to remove the dross of vasanAs, as opposed to
sending money to some temple for pooja.

I guess, by doing so, we are just pacifying our own agitated minds that we
have done something good in the direction of amelioration of the problems.

What is the view of great Masters of Advaita in this regard ???

I am able to get in now. Maybe this was just a temporary thing?
