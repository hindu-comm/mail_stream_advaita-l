Should Bhakti be considered as karma or upasana? If karma than you are
completely correct.  If it is an upasana then it is valid for an Advaitin
(albeit as a preparation for Jnana.)  I think the Advaita Acharyas
have tended to the latter view.  Some forms of upasana deal with
abstractions and some with more concrete things.

This is true for the Knower but the Seeker can be said to be a Mumukshu --
one who desires Moksha.  That too is an act but it is the final act.
