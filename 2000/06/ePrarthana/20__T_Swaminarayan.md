Is worshipping an invisible God any less a sign of a Dvaita outlook?

Jaldharji,

The word 'worshipping' in your comment above denotes' ACTION' and surely ,it comes within the scope of Dvaitam.Could you please clarify if your question is addressed to an Advaitin, and whether by this, you indicate that an advaitin worships an invisible Deity? A true Advaitin really does not 'seek' anything,for, seeking  is 'action' and hence is a part and parcel of Dvaitam.

Regards,

Swaminarayan
