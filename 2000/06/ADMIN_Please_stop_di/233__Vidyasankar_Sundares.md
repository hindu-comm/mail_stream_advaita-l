Good! I was debating whether to post another thing on that topic, but
noticed that things had become rather muddled.

Just as a final shot, I would ask people interested in Advaita and in
Madhyamaka to pay attention to how both schools discuss the issue of human
memory and recognition. This is intimately tied in to their views of
consciousness in the three states.
