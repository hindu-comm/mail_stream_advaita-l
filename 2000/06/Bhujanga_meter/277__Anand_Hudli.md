 Surely, you must have heard the shivastuti sung by the popular
 singer SP Balasubrahmanyam. I remember this and other songs were
 played at a high-decibel level in public places, before or after
 religious functions, in India, so often that every kid in the block
 had memorised them.

 pra-bhuM-prA-Na-nA-thaM-vi-bhuM-vi-shva-nA-thaM

 Again you have the pattern s-l-l-s-l-l-s-l-l-s-l-l

 You may use the same tune and rhythm (tAl). If you consider the
 fact that "s" is a mAtrA, and "l" is two mAtrAs, then one basic
 pattern "s-l-l" will be 1 + 2 + 2 = 5 mAtrAs. So you would have
 20 mAtrAs per quarter. This suggests, naturally, a rhythm (tAl)
 such as the (Hindustani) jhaptAl (can't remember what its
 Carnatic equivalent is), which has 10 mAtrAs (dhin-na-dhin-dhin-na-
 tin-na-dhin-dhin-na), 2 basic rhythm patterns covering a quarter.

 Needless to say, music set in the bhujangaprayAta  meter is very pleasing
 to sing or listen to.
