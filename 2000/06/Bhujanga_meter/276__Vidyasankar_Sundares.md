To get an intuitive feel for the above rule, say the words out loud, or try
to keep time, synchronously with the syllables. The syllables vi and han
will "feel" heavy, while sa in sadaa and la in baala will "feel" light. The
overall effect of the bhujangaprayAta meter is one of a swaying motion.
Rules of meter are based on recitational features, so unless you also recite
the words, you can't fully appreciate the beauty of the poetry.

Best wishes,
Vidyasankar
