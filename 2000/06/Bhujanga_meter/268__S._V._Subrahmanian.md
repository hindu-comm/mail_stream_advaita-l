I am trying to read Subrahmanya Bhujangam of Shri ShankarAcharya.  I have a
rough translation with me.  In the foreword it is mentioned that the
Bhujanga at the end of the name of the Stotra is a reference to the meter in
which it was composed.

Can anyone explain what a Bhujanga meter is ?

While it is nice to read the stotra with devotion, we can also appreciate
Shankara's poetic skills in that as well.
