Ravi,

I would much appreciate it if you or someone known to you could kindly
proof a PDF file of Sri Sankara's comm. on the IshAvAsya U. (see
attachment).  It is not a very long document (11 A4 size pages), and it
shouldn't take too long to proof-read.  I would prefer it if you could
let
me have a list of typos or other errors by the end of the week (before
the
long weekend) as I will be away and/or busy thereafter for a fair while.

Regards,

Shrisha Rao
