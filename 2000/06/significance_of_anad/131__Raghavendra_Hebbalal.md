namaste,
      In the traditional panchangas, we find several
days designated as anadhyayana or sets of days as
anadhyayana-traya and so on. I am aware that the
adhyayana spoken of there is vedAdhyayana. But I am
not aware of the exact reasons of why a particular day
is designated so. Is it ordained that vedAdhyayana on
that day is a strict no-no ? Or is it all right for
vedaadhyayana to be skipped that day ? The second
question arises because shrii shankara exhorts us to
'vedo nityamadhiiyataaM'.

Thank you in advance,
Raghavendra.
