I would think the latter.  It is the formal svadhyaya or Brahmayajna which
is omitted.

Note even on those days the other nityakarmas still have to be performed
so that would fulfill the requirement.  It would be a good idea to get
guidance from a learned shastri on this though.

btw. There are certain occasions on which there is anadhyayana but not
specific tithis.  (Not according to my Panchang anyway.)  There is
anvadhana though.  On these days even those whoare not agnihotris have to
do agnisthapana.  Is this the same thing or am I confusing it with
something else?
