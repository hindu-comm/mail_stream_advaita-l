 This list has been progressively losing its utility, at least for me.
 The only reason I am still subscribed is because of the presence of
 a few who have the right approach to advaita, including yourself. Many
 members have made thoughtless remarks about Shankara and others. And
 every once in a while someone comes up with the same old idea of
 Buddhist influence on advaita. These people are so intellectually
 challenged that they cannot be innovative enough to find other ways
 to question the integrity of the AchAryas. They keep repeating like
 parrots what they read in some book without even thinking about it.
 I doubt if these people can even understand Shankara's commentary on
 one sUtra, one upanishad-mantra, or one gItA-shloka in the original
 completely. Yet they have the audacity to second-guess him and other
 AchAryas and try to present some hopelessly out-dated theory of a
 Buddhist influence. Even if one is strictly academic, the opinion of
 Radhakrishnan, TRV Murti and other older scholars has been overthrown
 due to the progress of academic scholarship itself. With the new found
 interest of Buddhism in the West, it is safe to assume that some pretty
 serious research has been done in the very recent past which challenges
 the likes of Radhakrishnan and others. If one is academic one has to
 be at the cutting edge, else one becomes a dinosaur soon.

 I agree that we should try to find out more about what our AchAryas
 said by analyzing their statements. But this should be done in a
 constructive manner, without questioning their integrity itself,
 without insulting them.

 Are you serious? I thought human cloning was still a few years away,

 I will look forward to those posts.
