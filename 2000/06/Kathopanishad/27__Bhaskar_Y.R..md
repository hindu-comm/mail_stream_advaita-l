Dear Learned List Members of Advita-L
Sashtanga Pranam to All

In kathopanishad (1.2.23) it is said :
Nayamatma pravachanena labhyo
na medhaya na bahunaa shrutena!
yamevisha vrunute tena labhya
stastaisha atma vivrunute TANUM swaam!!
Lost two lines gives us the meaning that He alone shall find this self, who
is powerfully attracted to him in complete devotion to him that self
reveals as he REALLY IS ??

Please explain me TANUM in this verse.

And In 2.6.3 :
Bhayadasyagnistapati bhayatapati suryaha!
bhayadindracha vayuscha mrutyurdhavati panchama!!

Please explain me BHAYA in this verse.

Sashtanga Pranam to all once again
Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!

Bhaskar Y.R.
