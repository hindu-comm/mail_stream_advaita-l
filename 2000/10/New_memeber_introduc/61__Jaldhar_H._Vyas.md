Greetings and Namaste;

I have recently been studying and learning about Advaita Vedanta.  I am
interested in learning more and happened across your mailing list.  After
reviewing the archives, it appears to be an invaluable resource that will be
of great benefit.  Thank you for your consideration in joining this list.

Blessings;

Vinny Amador
