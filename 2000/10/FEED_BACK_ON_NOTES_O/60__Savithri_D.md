FEED BACK ON ?NOTES ON BRAHMASUUTRA-S?

Namaste Sri.Sadaananda,

                     _____ should be decreased to help my study
                     _____   continue at the current pace since
                         it helps me to learn Sanskrit as well.

11. General comments ?Please feel free to express them -  about the
contents, quality and problems and suggestions for improvement.

I am a starting sadhaki.  Although I have a lot of interest in Vedanta, a
lot of things are competing for my time at this stage in my life - kids,
work and household duties are some. If the notes are shorter, I may not put
it off when I see it.

I appreciate the great effort going into a presentation like this and trying
to accomadate to a heterogeneous group like Advaita-L or ChinmayaSatsanga.
Like most other readers, I try to read these posts during lunch or free time
at work. My hope is, at some future time I will still have the interest and
the time to assimilate such presentations.

Thankyou,
Savithri
