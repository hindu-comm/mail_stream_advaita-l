7. I stopped reading the notes, because
                 _____ I last interest
                 __X__  I don?t have time now, saving it for later study
                 ____  Sanskrit turned me off.  If there is no Sanskrit

I am tied up with work upto the brim.  I am not able to spend that much
time.  Pretty soon, I intend to catch up.  I am following some of the
arguments, but have not been able to do it seriously, hence my lack of
participation.  But I will catch up with it.

My only request is that if you can, please post in smaller installments.
When the size is too huge, there is a tendency to postpone as it will
require serious time.  This is only a request, please do as per your
convenience.

In any case, I plead you to continue.  I was in the meanwhile listening to
cassettes on 'Sandhyavandanam' Swami Paramarthananda.  That was also part of
the reason why I could not focus on instant topics on the list.  I have
great respect for him (these cassettes were my first introduction) and would
like to have literature as taught by him available for my perusal.

Thank you for your noble endeavour and contribution.

Regards.
S. V. Subrahmanian.
