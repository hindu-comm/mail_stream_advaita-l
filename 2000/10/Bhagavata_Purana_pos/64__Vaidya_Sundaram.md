Thanks for deciding to start the wonderful topic as a series again - In my
opinion, the story as a whole is important - skipping over parts will only
make it incomplete - however, as a series on this list, it is definitely
going to have to be condensed. I only request that the portions that deal
with adhyatmic topics be dealt with in greater detail than the "story"
part.

bhava shankara desikame sharaNam
Vaidya.

I've had some requests to continue the Bhagavata series Mrs. Vidyaranya
regretfully was not able to continue. Borrowing from Sadanandas example, I
would like to ask list members for some feedback.  Should I:

start at the very beginning as she did and narrate the whole thing in
depth?

or

concentrate only on selected portions particularly those which deal with
adhyatmic topics and subjects the kathakars usually skip over?

I will also start the vakyavrtti series again (as soon as I remember where
I left the book :-)
