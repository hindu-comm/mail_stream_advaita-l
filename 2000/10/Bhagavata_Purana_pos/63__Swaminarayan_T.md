concentrate only on selected portions particularly those which deal with

Dear shri Jaldhar,

Do Kathakars usually skipover adhyatmic topics? I am asking this since I have not had the opportunity to listen to any discourse pertaining to Bhagavatham. I would request you to post such portions of the Bhagavatham which will be conducive to SELF Realisation.

Warm regards,

Swaminarayan
