That's the one.  But it's incomplete.  It lacks the rahasya trayi and the
Rshi, devata, chhanda, viniyoga and dhyana for each stotra, adhyaya and
charita.

What I described is only the basic path for daily recital.  There are
other rites such as devi sukta, ratri sukta, khadga nyasa, various other
nyasas and homa that have to be done.  Also for Navaratri you have to do
ghata sthapana, samkalpa etc.  Then there are even more elaborate
vidhis such as Navachandi, Shatchandi and Sahasrachandi.  But these things
should be learned from a learned Guru not a mailing list!

I don't know.  It would be worth a look.

Yes.  There are 14 Manvantaras in each kalpa.
