Check out this link and see if this is the Chandi Path you had asked to be
performed.. In the book Durga Saptashati, there is the Devi Sukta and Tantra
Sukta that need to be recited. Should that be done as well (it actually
mentions that Devi sukta, Tantra Sukta and another one, need to be recited).

Not sure but the episode of Rishi Yajnavalkya with his guru Vaishampayana
caused the former to vomit out the Yajur Veda which came out black.
Vaishampayan's disciples turned into birds and picked up the Yajur Veda
again. Perhaps Rishi Jaimini too did that. Not sure if there is a relation.

This is the Vaivasvata Manvantara of the Svetvaarah kalpa - the 7th
manvantara isn't it?

thank you
