Namastae,

My exposure to Adaivta started when I picked the book "Atmabodha"  by Sri
Shankaracharya. Eversince I read this book I have developed a great liking
to the philosophy of the supreme non-dual self as explained  by Sri
Shankara. I am keen on increasing my knowledge in this regard and also in
putting some of the theories in practice - because of which I feel that this
mailing list is going to be an invaluable resource to me.
I would be greatly honoured if u include my name to the mailing list.

Regards
Sudhir.
