Then why say good morning? :-)

I don't know where you got the notion of all is emptiness, but its' not
from Advaita Vedanta.  Advaita Vedanta acknowledges the slippery nature of
language but is optimistic that positive descriptions can be made if we
try hard enough.  The trouble with the no-mind idea(!) is that for all
its' faults the mind is the best tool we have for apprehending reality.
If we fail to exercise our minds we have just rendered ourselves deaf,
dumb and blind.

The problem is that this kind of thing is easy to say but putting it into
practice is not so easy.  We can all talk big on the Internet but what do
we do when we log off?

I would urge all new age types reading this to make a systematic study of
the tenets (the "dogma" if you will) of Advaita Vedanta.  If  indeed the
path has already ended, it won't hurt, but you just may find out that it
has in fact only just begun.
