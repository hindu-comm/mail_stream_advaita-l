Namaste,
I thank you for your message and admitting me in your esteemed group. As you
already know my name is Kiran K. Shah(age 38 years), married to Pritee(age
32 years) and having only son Parth(age 7 years). I am a graduate in
mechanical Engineering from VJTI, batch 1983. Presently I am a consultant to
Concast (India) Limited, Mumbai in the field of Continuous casting machines.
My interest in Vedanta started immediately after my graduation, and I got
"initiated" by reading the introductory book on Hinduism by Swami
Vivekananda. The book really made a tremendous impression on me, and my
jignasa developed further, which in turn awakened greater interest. I then
joined the Bhavan's library and started reading Shankar Bhasyas on major
Upanishads and Brahma Sutras(only partly). The bhasyas were so convincing
that I got "hooked" on to Vedanta. Recently, I read a bhasya of Sri
Aurobindo on The Srimadbhagvat Gita. In between I read "The Arctic Home of
the Aryans" by B.G. Tilak, which further firmed my beliefs in our rich
heritage.
Now I want to brush up my earlier readings in the light of modern thinking
in and also to gain insights into thinkings of the contemporary Vedanta
thinkers.
Thanks & Regards,
Kiran K. Shah
