Greetings

I am a serious student of yoga and meditation.(eight years). I have also
been studying the teachings of Nisargadatta Maharaj, who teaches a form of
non-dualistic Hinduism that I connect to on a deep level. I was hoping to
learn more about Advaita Vedanta teachings through your list as I am
planning a spiritual trip to India and am anxious to expand my horizons.

Thanks,
E. Trundle
