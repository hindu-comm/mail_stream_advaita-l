not being a scholar, no was i a student of Advaita until after direct
realization of the truth.

Dear Gangaji,

Indeed you must be BLESSED to have had ( Can I use the past tense here ? ) a direct realization of the truth,even though you were neither a scholar nor a student of Advaita.

Having already had a realization, why are you now interested in Advaita?

With regards,

Hari Om !

Swaminarayan
