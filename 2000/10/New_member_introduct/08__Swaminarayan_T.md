Dear Gangaji,

Thank you for your generous gesture in showering your love and blessing  in our search for the TRUTH. I appreciate your not wanting to engage with us in intellectual debatre. Fine!.Then, are you wanting to sell your 'silence' to people who just 'talk'? What exactly is it that you wish to state for yourself and to us?

With warm regards and a wee bit curious,

Swaminarayan
