Why should they be different? They are not. On the contrary, writing
about that will improve one's depth and clarity of that subject. It is
and should be a part of sAdhana.  What one needs to minimize is
reading/writing about secular things and other useless chatter.

At least this is my personal experience. Even though I know very
little, I have attempted to write on things which I wanted to learn.
Those attempts have improved my understanding and depth of knowledge.
When try to translate shankara's ashhTottaram or abhiraami antaadi, I
do not think I am doing it for others. It is for me, even if I commit
errors, I learn in that process.

My 2c.

Sri Jaldhar,

It would be of immense value to ignorant students like me who
are at the very early stages of this journey if you could
please start from the beginning and narrate in detail.

Thank you very much,
Shuba
