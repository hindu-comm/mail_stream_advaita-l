namaste -
this is short and sweet... Good Decision.... just listen and follow your
guru... your time is much better spent in going beyond time and maya to the
Truth of Self... and in the split second of time when realization comes...
then all maya ends as the dream that it is.... and you awaken to the
Constant Which Is....

Love and Blessings g.
