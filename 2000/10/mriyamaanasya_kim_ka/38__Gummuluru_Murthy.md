namaste.

I fully understand the thinking of shrimati VidyaraNya and I fully
endorse it. Uplifting ourselves by following a sadguru's teachings
is the best procedure.  I will miss shrimati VidyaraNya's excellent
presentations on shrimadbhagavatam. Although only a few episodes were
presented, they were prepared beautifully with good clarity and with
a nice continuity of presentation.

Now, coming to the question which is the subject of this thread
(mriyamaanasya kim kartavya.h ?), it may be a test of how well we
understand what we are. Do we continue our activities in the normal
way knowing full well that death is right around the corner, being
completely unafraid of death?  Or, do we, recognizing that death is
staring at us, go into a frantic mood, and do yajnA-s and homA-s?

If only the humans know the date of death rather than the date of
birth. Isn't there a story on that theme in YogavashiShTA?
