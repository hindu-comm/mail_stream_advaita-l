I definitely do not have an in depth knowledge of BS

have attended), at my desktop and with such clarity,
still being so far away. Your notes are making me
determined to learn more. Please continue the series.
I will try and participate(mostly ask questions as
that's what I can do now).

Hari Om!

Rajesh
