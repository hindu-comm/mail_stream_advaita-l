Namaste -
agreed exhaust your intellectual discoveries and then go into the
silence....
But remember the final step is always through the silence when all
pre-conceived notions are dropped....
intellectual discovery can spur you on to more desire for the ultimate
goal... this is true... but it the end... not the beginning but in the end
the discussion ends for truth may only come to fruition from the depths of
your own Being which is Source Alone.... You continue the search and the
study and the puja's etc. until you have done all you can do.... you hit the
wall.... then you surrender all your so-called knowledge and go into the
silence.... not caring if you reach or don't reach... not caring if good nor
evil comes.... at that point all explodes and all that remains is Source...
or the Constant... or Self...
there is nothing wrong in the discussions... please do not mis-understand...
but the last step is the letting go of ALL of this.... that is all.....
if you are enjoying the discussions great... if they spur you onward then
great... it is All good.... no matter what you are always progressing in
some fashion back to the Self which you cannot get away from...
Try to spend as much time in Contemplation as you do in Study and
thought.... give silence as much time.... that is all......
no matter if all of the maya realms ceased in this moment that which is the
seed of your Being remains... the personality and form will end but you are
more complete in that than you ever are in form..... ( and please do not
take you as meaning a separate personality and existance--- it is not--- the
One is beyond the One beyond any division you can say more closely Emptiness
Which Contains All beyond Form in non-division - the completeness - more
concrete than form yet absoulutely the pregnant void or emptiness)

Love and Blessings
