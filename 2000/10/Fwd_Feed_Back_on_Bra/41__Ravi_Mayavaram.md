          FEED BACK ON ?NOTES ON BRAHMASUUTRA-S?

In Brahmasuutra notes, we just completed the discussion on Adhyaasa
bhashhyam and will be entering into the discussion of the sutra-s in
two
weeks.  Since the number of people participating in the discussions
are few,
there is a feeling that not many are interested in the notes.  I would
like
a feed back from all the readers to see to what level I should
continue the
notes.  I request all readers who are studying the notes along with me
to
respond frankly and freely so that I will have some idea who the
readers are
and to what extent it is catered to their needs.  The objective of the
notes
is primarily for my own learning secondarily to share with others who
want
to study the notes with me.  References and discussions are provided
using
Shankara?s texts and hopefully the study of the notes will establish
firmly
our understanding of advaita Vedanta.  I was hoping there would be in
put
from other knowledgeable scholars on the topic of notes so that
Internet
could be a very good vehicle to learn from each other.  This of
course
requires commitment of time and effort, which is a luxury for many in
the
busy world.  But I firmly believe that sharing of our knowledge with
others
is essential aspect of our growing up, and we enrich ourselves in
that
process.  If you are studying or stopped studying after few notes, I
would
like to hear from you too.  Here are few questions I prepared but you
can
provide your input in any other way.  Positive or negative comments, I
will
like to hear from you.  I will like to hear your lack of interest in
the
notes too so that I am conscious of what percentage of readers I am
catering
the notes for.   If I don?t hear from you, I will assume that you have
no
interest even in responding to the questionnaire.
