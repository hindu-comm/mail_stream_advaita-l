1. I have been studying the notes regularly  __ yes   __ no.

A  :  YES, but please note at the novice level

2. I had previous background of Vedanta ___ yes ___ no

A:  Not much, but now realising whatever knowledge i had in vedanta was
pre-polished in delusions.

3. I had previous background of Brahmasuutra ____yes ___no

A:  Yes - I have read some quotes from Srila Prabhupad's Books.

4. Clarity of the Notes ___

A:  For me it is very clear.I am whole heartedly grateful to you prabhuji for
your excellent presentation.
    ( surprisingly i am not getting any doubts though i have some pre-conceived
ideas about advaita phil. !!!                                         Thanks to
Sri Vidya & Jaldhar prabhuji for their patience in clearing  my doubts)

5. Use of Sanskrit

A:  Helpful for the notes

6. Sanskrit

A:  continue at the current pace since it helps me to learn Sanskrit as well.

7. I stopped reading the notes, because

A:  Not applicable

8. The notes:           ____ logically presented.
                                ____ logic is not clear
                                ____ too much emphasis on logic

A:  At present not in a position to comment about it.

9.  The notes

A:  should be more detailed with some comparative study with other schools of
thought (i.e. Dvaita & VishitAdvaita interpretations on BS- wherever duality is
clear in sUtras)

10 The notes

A:  should be continued at the same pace subject to feedback/comments that you
receive on notes.  If a particular issue attracts lot of comments, requires
clarifications from readers in detail,  i think you can holdback the next issue
till the previous one is cleared to the maximum extent.

11. General comments :

A:  I hereby sincerely request Sri Vidyashankar Sundaresan Prabhuji, Sri Jaldhar
Prabhuji, Sri Anand Hudli Prabhuji and Sri Himanshu Dave Prabhuji to share their
valuable views/comments/understanding  parallelly to enable us to understand the
notes in much more detail.


Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
