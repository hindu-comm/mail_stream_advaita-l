Dear Vishal,
Thank you for sheding light on the forgotten chapter in the history of
Indian philosophy.
small suggestion:
Is not it inadiquate to list Bharuci on the line of ViSiSTAdvaita of
rAmAnuja. Can the lineage presented by 17th century be realiable?
Within the VaiSNava tradition there definitely were different streams of
idealogy, but this is totally unreliable when TaNka and dRAmiDa are placed
on the same line. The non-dualistic inclination of TaNka and DrAmiDa can be
well traced from SaNkara and SureSvara.
Sincerely,
Sthaneshvar Timalsina,
Weimar, Germany
