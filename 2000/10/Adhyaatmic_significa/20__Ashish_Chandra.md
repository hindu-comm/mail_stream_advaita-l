Maybe a more learned member/North Indian can correct me/add to this. Today
is Durga Ashtami and throught North India, almost irrespective of the Ishta
Devata, people fast. As opposed to the specific days of Upakramans in South
India and probably the western parts, when the Yajnopavit is changed and the
vows re-affirmed, throughout North India people change their Yajnopavit
today.
