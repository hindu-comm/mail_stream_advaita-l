The Shukla ashtami of every month is called Durgashatami and is auspicious
for Her worship.  This is mentioned in 12th adhyaya of Chandi Path.  The
eighth day of Navaratri has another sort of significance.  It is called
Havanashtami and it when the Homa and Balidana should be done.  Balidana
is the sacrifice of an animal (usually a goat or sheep.)  Bengalis and
other North Indians actually do this.  But in Gujarat and other places
were people are more likely to be vegetarian, a substitute is used
instead.  Like at our local mandir, they slice a watermelon in half.
It's not quite as dramatic but a lot gentler!
