HER (left half) sparkling ear ring is studded with blazing precious stones
 and HE (right half) is adorned with a terrifying snake as HIS ear ring.
Supreme auspiciousness  (which is brahman) is  the essence of both shrii
shivaa and Lord shiva. Such is the wonderful form of ardhanaariishvara. I
bow to shrii shivaa and Lord shiva.
