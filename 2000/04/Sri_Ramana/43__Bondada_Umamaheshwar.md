Dear All

I am a beginner on the path of Advaita.  Yet, if I am permitted, I venture
to mention what I understood from Sri Ramana Maharshi's teachings:

Sri Ramana always advices on contemplation of only one important question,
and that is -- "Who am I?".

I request the learned list members to enlighten me with their views (and
advice on how to put this kind of contemplation into practice) on this very
important question, "Who am I?" -- as taught by Bhagawan Ramana Himself.

Om Namah Sivaya

Uma

--
bhava shankara deshikame sharaNam
