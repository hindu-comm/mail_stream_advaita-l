Namaste

I am not sure if any members know of a Sanskrit shibir (camp) that is being
organized in California this July by Sanskrit Bharati, an organization
dedicated to the popularization of the Sanskrit language. The shibir will be
held at Coloma Resort, CA from July 1-9. Interested members can get more
information at http://www.samskrita-bharati.org/bhittipatram.html

For more information on Sanskrit Bharati, you can visit
