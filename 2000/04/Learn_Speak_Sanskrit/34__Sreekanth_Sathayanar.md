namaste,

I am one of the members in this Samskrita bhArathi group. We meet regularly
(first and third sat'days of the month) and try to learn to talk in samskrita.
This organization samskrita bhArathi is quite active atleast here in the Bay
area. Recently we put up a samskrita drama thapasaH prabhavaH (Power of
penance), the episode depicting the penance done by parvathi to marry shiva
(after she takes birth as the daughter of HimAlaya). The play was selected from
"kumAra Sambhava" written by the great kAlidAsa. Lot of people who saw the play
really liked it.

List moderators, please permit me to use this as propoganda mail.. I would like
to draw the attention of people who might be interested in learning samskrita to
kindly consider this event "samskrita shibhira". It is going to be a residential
camp for 9 days from July 1st to July 9th. You will have to take a leave of just
3 days from your rouitne work (on July 5th,6th and 7th) and you will have an
oppurtunity to experience 9 days full of total samskrita in your life.

DhanyavAdah
