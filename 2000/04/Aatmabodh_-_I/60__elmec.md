Hari Om,

Hearty welcome to Atmabodh's translation by Sri Ashish Chandra. I am sure it
will be of great interest both to the beginners and to those who have achieved
much progress in the path of spirituality.

In the word by word translation and in the summary of the first verse I thought
slight modifications can be made to bring out more apropriate meaning. I shall
indicate the changes which can be incorporated in  italics.

This work Atmabodh is meant for those people whose sins have been annihilated by
penances, who are peaceful by nature, who are dispassionate and who are desirous
of moksha.


Ashish, please continue the good work. Everybody is a learner in life. Nobody is
an expert. Good luck
