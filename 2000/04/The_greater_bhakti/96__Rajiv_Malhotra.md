In recent literature, this is called PCE (Pure Consciousness Experience) and
the book by that title by Robert Forman describes many traditions from the
world believing in that ultimate. These include Sufism, Buddhism, Sikhism,
Jainism, Christian mysticism, besides most strands of Hinduism.

Rajiv


Do you not now tend to agree that any MARGA selected
by an aspirant to Moksha is veryly leading to Advaita?
In bhakti, supreme devotion leads the bhakta to a
state which can be equated to THOUGHTLESS AWARENESS
where the emperical mind has been indeed
transcended?Bereft of the mind which is an integral
part of the body the Self alone' JUST IS '
This state is well described by Shri Vimuktatma
Bhagwan as follows:

Atmaiko,Nishkriyo,Ananto, Advayo, Anubhavavigrahaha,
Atamastajja Atmastho, Jyotisham Jotihi, Atmabhah!

Warm regards,
Swaminarayan.
