That's the part they miss.  When we say the Self is Brahman it doesn't
mean the self (small-s) _only_ is Brahman.  And when we says the forms
such as Vishnu Bhagawan are not Brahman all we mean is that they aren't
_only_ Brahman.  I'm corresponding with a Harekrishna and this is the
point I'm trying to get across to him.  That he is placing a boundary on
one side is God and another side is not-God thus he is putting limits on
God.
