Do you not now tend to agree that any MARGA selected
by an aspirant to Moksha is veryly leading to Advaita?
In bhakti, supreme devotion leads the bhakta to a
state which can be equated to THOUGHTLESS AWARENESS
where the emperical mind has been indeed
transcended?Bereft of the mind which is an integral
part of the body the Self alone' JUST IS '
This state is well described by Shri Vimuktatma
Bhagwan as follows:

Atmaiko,Nishkriyo,Ananto, Advayo, Anubhavavigrahaha,
Atamastajja Atmastho, Jyotisham Jotihi, Atmabhah!

Warm regards,
Swaminarayan.
