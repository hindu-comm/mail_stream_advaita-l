I can think of some explanations.

Since many different versions of the raamaayaNa were
known by the time the adhyAtma rAmAyaNa was composed,
the poet (supposed to be vAlmIki) may have added this
to show that other rAmAyaNas were in vogue and also
that the basic storyline was no different from the
others.

Or, siitaamaataa is a trikaalajnaa. She knew of all
events in the past,present and the future. For her as
well as shrii raama, all of this was but a play. So
She
is playing the role to perfection here.

Any other suggestions ?

Regards,
Raghavendra.
