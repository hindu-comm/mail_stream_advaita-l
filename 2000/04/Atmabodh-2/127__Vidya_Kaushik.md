The meaning  I see in the Chinmaya Mission version is:
'Just as fire is the direct cause for cooking, so without knowledge no
emancipation can be had.  Compared with all other forms of discipline,
knowledge of the self is the one direct means for realization.'  This seems
to be more appropriate.  Fire is direct cause while vessel and other things
are accessories, similarly knowledge is the direct cause for liberation
while other disciplines (karma yoga, ashtanga yoga...) are accessories.
