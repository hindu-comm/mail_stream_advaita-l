Though there is no creator in the pAramArthika sense,
the initial question was posed with the vyAvahArika
state in mind. That was the reason for speculation.
I guess the initial question was why brahma is not
worshipped in the Hindu religion. Even mAdhvAs,who do
not accept ajAta-advaita, worship shiva sometimes. But
we don't see them worshipping brahma. What could be
the reason for this ? It was this question I tried to
answer.

Thanks,
Raghavendra.
