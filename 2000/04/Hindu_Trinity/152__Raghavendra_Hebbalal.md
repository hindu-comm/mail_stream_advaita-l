This explanation would have been perfect if brahma was
not worshipped or glorified anywhere in the smArta
tradition. But it is not the case. brahma is glorified
as hiraNyagarbha and prajaapati in the vedas. In fact,
shiva and vishhNu were not as important in the vedas
as Indra and the others.  The act of creation is
glorified in many works respected by the smArta
tradition. For example in the lalitA sahasranaama, She
is described as 'sR^ishhTikartrii brahmarupaa'.
Also, how can the non-worship of brahma by present day
non-advaitin-Hindus be explained ?

Raghavendra.
