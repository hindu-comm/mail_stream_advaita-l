The sustainer is worshipped even though there was no creation to sustain.
Hence, what he sustains is an illusion, as you indicate. Likewise, the
destroyer destroys the illusion, not some real absolute world.

By the same logic, the creator is the one who creates this ILLUSION. This is
what I called the virtual reality. So since the creation, sustenance, and
dissolution is about a virtual or illusory world, each has comparable
status.

You cannot apply different standards to the three.

Not so. One can worship Shiva as the destroyer of ignorance, since the
worship of a separate deity itself presupposes ignorance, which must be
destroyed.

One can also worship VishhNu as the supreme reality, since the sustainer
is the reality (of the perceived world, which is neither real nor unreal).

But in the practice of advaita, is there any need to create something anew?
Why worship a creator, so to speak?
