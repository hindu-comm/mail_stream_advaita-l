By the logic below that there is no creator and hence no need to worship the
creator, one should also conclude that there is no universe to sustain or
destroy since one never got created in the first place. Hence, there is no
need to worship either sustainer or destroyer.

The fact is that saguna is a 'virtual reality' with virtual creation,
sustenance, destruction. Hence, Saguna, Ishwara, Brahma, Vishnu, Shiva are
all virtual just like jagat and jiva. So their worship is also happening in
the virtual realm, with virtual karma and virtual enlightenment. Ultimately,
none of this is absolute reality.

Hence, the status of creator, sustainer, destroyer in a relative (or
virtual) creation or pseudo-creation, is the same.

Regards,

Rajiv

There is no need to. GauDapaada gives the answer in his GauDapaadIya
kArikA, a commentary on the mANDUkya upanishhad: according to
ajAta-advaita, there is no creation and therefore no creator. Hence the
refutation of the worship of a creator.

(note: a-jAta = no-birth. ajAta-advaita teaches that reality has no birth,
no creation)
