There is no need to. GauDapaada gives the answer in his GauDapaadIya
kArikA, a commentary on the mANDUkya upanishhad: according to
ajAta-advaita, there is no creation and therefore no creator. Hence the
refutation of the worship of a creator.

(note: a-jAta = no-birth. ajAta-advaita teaches that reality has no birth,
no creation)
