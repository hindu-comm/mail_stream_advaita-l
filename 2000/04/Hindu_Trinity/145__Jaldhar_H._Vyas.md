A computer science joke:  A book on software engineering I saw once by an
Indian author was dedicated to the Trimurti the Lords of development,
maintainance, and refactoring. :-)

No there is a parinama or transformation from Brahman to the lower
forms.  Samkhya has a similiar theory of gunas but in that darshana, they
are the constituents of Prakrti and Purush is completely distinct.  That
is dualistic and against Advaita.

It is mentioned in some works.  But strictly speaking that is all to do
with vyavahara and not important in the  Advaita view.

In Gujarat, Brahma is widely worshiped as Vishvakarma by the artisan
castes such as Blacksmiths, Carpenters, Potters etc.  In fact Prajapati is
a common surname amongst Kumbhars or potters.

As to why there is no "Brahmaism" like Vaishnavism or Shaivism, my guess
it has to to do with the close identification of Brahma/Prajapati with the
Vedic ritual.  As the theories of Purva Mimamsa became further developed
the importance of worshipping a God became secondary to the actual
performance of ritual itself.

The concept is a real part of our traditions but the importance has been
exaggerated by those who know more about foreign faiths than their
own.  In our sampradaya it is the Deva Panchayata (Shiva, Vishnu, Shakti,
Ganesh, and Surya Bhagawans) which are more important.
