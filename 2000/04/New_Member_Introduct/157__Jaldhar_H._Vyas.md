Dear Sir,

As a part of the introduction about myself, let me tell you that I am not
clear who I am as far as advaitha vedantic philosophy is concerned. As far
as world is concerned, I am a masters student in Indian Inst of Science
Bangalore doing my masters in optical character recognition in case of
printed Oriya characeters and is quite interested in the rich cultural and
heritage of India. I my self i s practising raja yoga and kriya yoga so as
to make myself be eligible for Jnana yoga and attain liberetaion or self
realization, whatever you may name it. I sincerely hope that I'll be
lifted in philosophical plane by being a member of this list and be
enlightened.
