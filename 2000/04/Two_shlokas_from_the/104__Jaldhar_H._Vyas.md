These are from the 1st skandha, 2nd adhyaya.

Vadanti tat tattva-vidastattvam yajjnanam advayam brahmeti
Paramatmeti Bhagavan iti sabdyate || 11 ||

tacchradadhadhaanaa munayo jnaanavairagyayuktayaa |
pashyantyaatmani chaatmanaam bhaktyaa shrutagrheetaya || 12 ||

The knowers of the ultimate principle (tattva) call the ultimate
principle that which is non-dual Jnana, some call it Brahman, some
Paramatma, some Bhagawan. Those faith-filled munis who have bhakti
filled with jnana and vairagya and understanding of the shastras see that
tattva in their own selves.
