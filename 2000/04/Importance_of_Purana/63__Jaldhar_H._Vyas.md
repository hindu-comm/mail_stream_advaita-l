This in not exactly true.  The Puranas like the Vedas consist of vidhi
(commands to do something), nishedha (commands to not do something) and
arthavada which consists of explanations of vidhi and nishedha.  Insofar
as injunctions in the Puranas do not contradict the Vedas they are also
authoritative.

By coincidence a follower of the Hare Krishnas emailed
webmaster at advaita-vedanta.org making many of those types of arguments.  If
he agrees, I'll post his message and my reply.

On the subject of the Padma Purana, we have to be careful because the
Puranas are part of an oral tradition and are not 100% fixed.  However in
this case it is more obvious that there has been tampering because there
are several different recensions of the Padmapurana and only the one
prevalent in Bengal (which surprise, surprise is the homeland of the
Gaudiya tradition) has this damning evidence against Advaita.  Given the
number of opponents there have been of the "mayavada" why has noone else
noticed this smoking gun?

The specific contention they make is that according to that Purana, Shiva
bhagawan took birth as Shankaracharya to promulgate an "asat-shastra"
This is arthavada because it just provides a "historical" detail.  What is
the injunction it is refering to?  That we should not follow
Shankaracharyas teachings?  Apart from the fact that there is no such
wording anywhere, Advaita Vedanta is not valid because Shankaracharya was
an avatara.  Rather he is considered an avatara because he taught Advaita
Vedanta--the message of the eternal Vedas.

Actually Vedantins in general don't agree completely with the Mimamsaka
view.  The Mimamsakas went as far as to say The Upanishads are
also arthavada because they do not enjoin or prohibit actions.  Maharshi
Vyas discusses and refutes this view of Maharshi Jaimini in Brahmasutra
3.4.1-17 and says the threefold classification applies to the karmakanda
only.  As we are talking about karma (doing or not doing something) here
the Mimamsaka analysis applies.

That the Puranas are authentic or not is not the issue but whether they
should be considered authoritative.

Exactly.  In light of the earlier discussions about fundamentalism it
should be observed a fundamentalist approach does not necessarily mean a
literalist one.  Our commentorial tradition is more subtle than that.  A
historical view *could* be taken of the shastras but that would not make
them any more or less valid.  It is what they say to do or not do which
counts.

If faith is built on unstable foundations it will inevitably become
unstable.

Not necessarily, see below.

There isn't a chasm.  Those portions of Shruti which apparently describe
historical events are arthavada too.  They are also described as itihasa
and purana and are treated exactly the same as the seperate works called
itihasa and purana.
