Dear Shri Mani,
Now that this thread has picked up very relevent
points for the  understanding  of Krishna Conciousness
for what it is made to be by Iskonists ( I understand
they have already split themselves into distinct

to this List along with your own comments on the same.

Hari Om!

Swaminarayan.
