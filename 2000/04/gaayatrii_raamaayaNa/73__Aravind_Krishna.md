Sri RamayaNa mahAkAvyam consist of 24 thousand shlokas for 24 letters in the
gAyatrI mantra. Every 1000th shloka starts with the corresponding gayarti
akshara.
For example the first shloka of the epic begins with 'ta' the first akshara
of gAyatrI,

tapaHsvAdhyAyanirata.n tapasvI vAgvidA.n varam .
nAradaM paripaprachchha vAlmIkirmunipu~Ngavam ..

Anand pointed out this in his first post on the vedic ramayaNa,

>For this reason, vAlmIki bases the twenty-four thousand verses of >the
>rAmAyaNa on the twenty-four akshhara's (syllables) of the >gAyatrI mantra
>(of the Vedas).

I will try to post the smArta ramayaNa pArAyaNa kraman with gayatrI
ramayaNa.
