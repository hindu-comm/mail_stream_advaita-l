Dear All:

Yesterday I got a chance to listen to gaayatrii raamayaaNa rendered by
shrii M. Balamuralikrishna. It has 24 verses and one phala shruti. I
noticed the first letter of the verses corresponded to the syllables in
the gaayatrii mantra. Is this a selection from vaalmiki raamaayaNa. Can
someone write more details about this.

Aside:

Recently in one of messages, Anand Hudli pointed out the importance of
gaayatri mantra and cited that it is the essence of veda-s. Thanks for
those very reassuring words.

Ravi
AUM raamaaya namaH
AUM raamachandraaya namaH
AUM raamabhadraaya namaH
