Subject: Re: Welcome

I have made this response before, but it must have been lost in cyberspace.
First, thank you for adding me to the Advaita list. I have recently become a
member of the Vedanta Society of St. Louis and am very interested in learning
all I can. I am a retired teacher/writer. I look forward to reading the list.
Thank you.
