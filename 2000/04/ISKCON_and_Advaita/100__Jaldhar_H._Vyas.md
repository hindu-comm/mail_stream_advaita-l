It is not the most agreeable of tasks but I do it because to allow lies to
flourish is a grievous sin that affects everyone.

There is an element of cultishness about ISKCON and some of its members
can only be described as mentally ill.  But there are other people who are
genuinely interested in following the shastras and in serving Bhagwan and
find ISKCON however biased or arbitrary to be more congenial than some
so-called Advaitins who frankly are little better than atheists.  The
latter type just repeat arguments because they don't know any better and
are quite reasonable once the record has been set straight.

It just goes to show you that the best defense against this type of
behavior is to educate ourselves.  In fact knowledge is the cure for all
of lifes ills.  Many people on this list are doctors or PhDs or have other
kinds of professional education.  Let us redouble our efforts to be as
learned in higher knowledge as we are in worldy knowledge.

I won't bore the list with all the voluminous details but I'll post a
summary afterwards.  A couple of interesting points have been raised
actually.
