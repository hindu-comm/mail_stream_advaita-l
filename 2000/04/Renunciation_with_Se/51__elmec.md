Hari Om,

At the beginning of our saadhana, we do lot of shravana, we read a lot
of
articles on vedaanta and we contemplate upon what we have listened to
and what
we have read. At that stage we form opinions in our mind that " this
must be
the truth ",
" this must be the untruth " etc etc. As we progress further, when we
come to
an understanding that the Truth is one without a second, it is
Ekameevaadvitiiyaha, that the Truth is beyond explanation by words like
' this
' and ' that ' , we realise that in such a state where there is no
existence of
untruth at all , then the words ' Truth ' and ' untruth ' become
redundant. I
think, it is this meaning that is given in that phrase
" satyaanrita parityajya.....".

Learned members, kindly excuse if my thoughts are not relevant.

Regards,
Hari Om,
Latha Vidyaranya.
