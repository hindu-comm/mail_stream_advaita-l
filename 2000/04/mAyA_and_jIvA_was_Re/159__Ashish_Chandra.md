Its strictly not an illusion (if I am not mistaken about the Advaita
position that is). It is mAyA, and that is not simply an illusion. It is
anirvAchanIya and anAdi, subject to the four-fold negation/attribute of
niether being, nor not-being, not either, nor both. There is nothing more
that can be said about it.

This describes the jivA, not mAyA. jivA does not sustain the illusion,
rather, it is subject to it.

Sri Ramana Maharshi in Upadesa Saaram says,

" Isha Jeevayo Veshadhibhida.
  Sath Swabhavatho vasthu kevalam ".

" Ishwara and Jeeva are different only  in  their manifestations.
  In their real essence they are the same ".

Sri Hanuman says to Ramachandra Bhagavan,

"Dehabudhyai tho daasosmi jeevabudhyai twadhamshakaha .
 Atmabudhyai twamevoham ithi mai nischithamathihi . "

" If I am body conscious then I am your servant, If I am soul consicious, then I am
  your part. If I am conscious of my Self , then I am you , this is my firm conviction ".

Anand

P.S. The above slokas were written from memory and I think they are OK.
          If  any errors, please correct.
