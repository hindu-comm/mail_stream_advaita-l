In ambaa-L recently there is an attempt to get
all the works of shrii shankara on ambaaL into
e-format. You can read the archives of this list
at:

http://www.geocities.com/kaamaakshi

(compiled and edited by Swami Vishvarupananda)

and

May be we should also take up a similar project
on a broader level to bring all the shankara's
works into electronic format  using ITRANS
scheme.

I request someone to coordinate and guide this
effort here. It is a massive task.  But can be
accomplished by a group of volunteers over a
period of time. (I cannot take up this because I
have booked all my free time for other projects).

Following items are to be done.

1) Find a volunteer to coordinate and guide the
effort.

2) The coordinator can then find a list of
volunteers.

3) Identify what is already available and what
needs to be done.

4) Compile what is already posted on advaita-L.

5) Type in the works and  send a copy to jaguar
site.


There are 125+ members in this list. Even if 15
members come forward we can accomplish something.
The key is find the person who can coordinate the
efforts.



Thank you.
