The verse speaks of the knowledge *produced* by the Vedas and not
knowledge *of* the Vedas.

It says:
practising any religion --> purification of the mind --> study of VedAnta
--> Self-enquiry --> GYAna

Here the "study of VedAnta" must be taken in a broader sense to mean the
study of the *essence of VedAnta philosophy* and not literally the books
that constitute the end of the Vedas. To make my point clear, it does not
mean that one who knows only Tamil and not Sanskrit cannot achieve GYAna
since he cannot study the Sanskrit books constituting the end of the
Vedas. If he is taught by a Guru like Ramana who is essentially teaching
the philosophy of VedAnta in Tamil, it is the same as studying the
VedAnta.

In this sense, if the Bible is read from the perspective taught by Ramana,
I don't see how it is any different from the essence of VedAnta philosophy
itself. OTOH, if one reads dualism into it, it's no different from the
dvaitins' reading of the upanishhads (which can also be called "VedAnta").

What I was quoting was from the Talks. When a woman asked Ramana for the
"best religion to follow" he replied, "All methods and religions are the
same" and then during the course of the talk, went on to add, "so long as
they lead to Self-enquiry."

This is the same opinion that you had regarding Ramakrishna's teachings.

I think you're keen on maintaining an exclusivity insofar as the VedAnta
philosophy goes, restricting it to the study of the upanishhads and
related works. If someone else has constructed the necessary framework of
the philosophy of VedAnta in Hebrew quite independently from the Vedas,
"it just cannot be because it cannot be."
