Let me just quote Apastamba dharma suutra (prashna 2, paTala 9, khaNDa 21)
------------------
13. satyAnR^ite sukhaduHkhe vedaaniM lokamamuM cha
parityajyaa.atmaanamanvichchet.h .

  Renouncing truth and untruth, pleasure and pain, *the Vedas*, this world
  and the next, he (the saMnyAsin) shall enquire into the Self.
------------------

When one seeks the Self exclusively, the Vedas MUST be renounced.

I'm not sure if I understand you correctly, but are you trying to imply
that VedAnta itself (as in end-of-the-Vedas-shruti) remains after GYAna?
This is not correct. The knowledge of the Self completely sublates the
Vedas. On the attainment of GYAna, there is no such thing as the Vedas.

Shankara says in his Brahma suutra Bhaashhya, "We admit the absence of all
the shAstras on the attainment of GYAna."

If there are no Vedas on the attainment of GYAna, by your own definition
of VedAnta, there can be no VedAnta either.

Let me explain:

Ramana's teachings in general: NOT VedAnta. He himself said that he was
teachings from his own experience ONLY, but that his teachings *tallied
with Shankara's*, and in that sense and IN THAT SENSE ALONE, he taught the
philosophy of VedAnta.

However, in order to avoid confusion on your part or others, any
philosophy that is _in line with the essential teachings of Vedas_ I
shall from now onwards call "S-Veda philosophy." I could give Ramana's
teachings as an example of S-veda philosophy.

Sorry. Correct "VedAnta philosophy" in my statements above to "S-Veda
philosophy."

Sorry again. I hereby correct "constructed" to "preached" and "philosophy
of VedAnta" to "S-veda philosophy."
