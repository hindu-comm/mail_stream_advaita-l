Namaste

I just have a few questions. It gets quite tricky when we try and reconcile
religions because "in the end, all religions have the same goal".

This statement begs the question as to how we would reconcile the views of
Buddhism and Jainism to that of Advaita, as these too have sprouted from
Vedanta. AFAIK, the majority of sects of these religions have rejected the
concept, or reality, of God.

Then we do conclude that any dualistic reading into the Upanishads would be
incomplete, maybe even wrong. All the refutations from Advaita acharyas of
other darshanas have taken this line, have they not?

If I understand this correctly, the exclusivity, as Anand had pointed out,
is not that what is in the Upanishads is not anywhere, rather its the four
tenets of Advaita that make it difficult for comparison. I guess my question
now is

Are there any philosophies from which we can draw advaitic conclusions,
besides Vedanta ?
