The vedas are not renounced anytime. To the person of realization the
vedas become no vedas. Not for others. The upanishhads are quite clear
about this. viGYAna is through vedAnta alone. If Apastamba *really*
meant otherwise (I don't think so), that cannot be accepted. appayya
dIxita refutes Apastambas contention that the householder state is
superior to the sannyAsAshrama explicitly.
