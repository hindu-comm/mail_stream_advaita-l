I think perhaps we can forgive the professor inasmuch as he has
already confessed to forming his opinions on the basis of love
rather than logic.  Moreover, reductio ad absurdum yields only
a specious logic in any case.

Let's face it:  Advaita has no competitors.  What is true cannot
be made untrue nor even threatened by the limitations of indi-
vidual (mis)understanding.  In the Absolute, there is no know-
ledge, but while awaiting moksha might one not learn some-
thing worth while from one who sees other's systems with the
eyes of love?

Brahman, is without qualities, but where qualities arise in the
world of appearance is not love the highest -- especially that
love which is not attached to one's own position?

Walk far enough in the other direction and we end up with war.
There have been (and there still are) so many of those over reli-
gion already.  I, for my part, will not take the cudgel to someone
who actually reaches out with love toward religions other than
his own.

Sincerely,

John
