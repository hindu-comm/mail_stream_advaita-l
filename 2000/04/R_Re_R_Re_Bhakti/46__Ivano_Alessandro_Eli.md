To be a His servant not just with actions but with, in addiction, love; to please Him offering what you can.
This, in my understanding, must be done following a codified ritual.
Being not Indian is this "ritual" that is unknown to me.

I'm far from the realization of the sate of Brahman. I just know that my ultimate goal is the Brahman nirguna; but I also understand
that I'm now not ready to approach it, so I want to try less difficult task like being the most close I can to the person of Lord
Siva. I think this is called Brahman saguna.
What I wish to achieve is jnana brought by the grace of my Lord.

Thank you a lot: this advice as been very useful to me. And thanks also to Anand Hudli that gave me an url about the Shavism so I
can read about Lord Siva.

I have no answer to this.
