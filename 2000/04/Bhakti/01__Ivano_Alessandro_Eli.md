Namaste

Until now my research for the jnana as been very chaotic: I had several moments of  dejection because I was never sure of  my
understandings about what I had to do. I just jumped from an idea to another keeping me in a merely intellectual point of view.
While I was reading the commentary of the bhagavad-gItA by His Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada, as I mentioned in
my first posting, I tried to experienced the bhakti by chanting the mantra HARE KRISHNA  HARE KRISHNA  KRISHNA KRISHNA  HARE HARE /
HARE RAMA  HARE RAMA  RAMA RAMA  HARE HARE. It was surely an improvement to me but I'm not totally happy about it.
Later I abandoned that commentary because it was more religious than philosophical.

Now I'm quite sure that my first step should be the bhaktiyoga; So I'd be very grateful to you if you would advice me about the
deity for my devotion (I'm slightly oriented towards Siva) and the way to worship it.


Thanks and Regards
Ivano
