- To develop bhakti towards Lord shiva, you can pray to him asking for
that. This is a strategy that works.

- There is work by shrii shankara called "shivaanandalaharii" which
beautifully defines bhakti, and explores it in detail. If you read this
work it will be of great help. Some of the verses of this work were
discussed on this list. You may want to look into the archives. Also,
www.vidyavrikshah.org has the entire text with translation.
