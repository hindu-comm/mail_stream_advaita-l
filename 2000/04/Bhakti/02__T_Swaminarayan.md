Bhakti Marga is the same whether it is Bhati for Lord
Krishna, Lord Rama or Lord Shiva. It is the intensity
of your Bhakti for the LORD of your choice that counts
in the upliftment of your spiritual understanding. In
case you wish to follow the gyana marga in preferance
to the bhakti marga  you may  start investigating
about  YOURSELF for SELF KNOWLEDGE.A good starting
point could be the Mandukya Upanishad which is the
smallest of all Upanishads and contains only twelve
Mantras or Slokas.I am sure you can get hold of a
publication on this very important Upanishad which has
the very essence of VEDANTA in it.There is always
however a great mental satisfacation and peace of mind
that can and will be derived by Bhakti or Devotion to
the Lord of your choice.Never waver in your choice
after you have made your decision on the same.

Hari Om !
