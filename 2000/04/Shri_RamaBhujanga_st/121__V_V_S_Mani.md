Namaskarams. Someone had sent nice ShriRamaBhujanga stotram - a few verses.
Can we have the entire RamaBhujanga stotram with the meanings if it is
available. During my childhood, I use to recite this slokam fully -without
knowing any meaning.(with Lord RamachandraMoorthy being our family Deity) It
is so very interesting to read the meaning of some of the verses from the
Stotram sent.
Namaskarams.
