  I posed the same question to ( i.e. Is Buddha an Avatar
of VishNu? ) to a VaishNavite priest in Memphis, TN and to
a VaishNavite scholar independently.  They both said that
most "main-stream" VaishNavas do not consider the Buddha to
be an avatar of VishNu.  However, ISKCON does espouse the
"rogue" avatar theory ( i.e. Buddha is a "rogue" avatar who
temporarily misled people from the vedas as a form of
"shock" therapy to awaken them to the "true" meaning etc.
).

  Incidentally, that was the first time that I had heard of
Buddha being an avatar of VishNu. Also, VHP ( and the Sangh
Parivar organizations ) also believe in the "rogue" avatar
theory.  It is mentioned in their calendars.

-Vivek.
