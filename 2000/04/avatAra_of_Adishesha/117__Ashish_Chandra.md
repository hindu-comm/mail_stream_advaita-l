According to a story I heard in my childhood, and many times over since,
Shesh Naag accompanied Bhagavan Vishnu to the earth in the form of
Lakshamana.

After this avataar, however, Shesh Naag complained to Bh. Vishnu that he
always got to be the younger one. So Bh. Vishnu gave in to his wishes and
hence Shesh Naag was born as Balaraam and Bh. Vishnu as Sri Krishna.

This story is prevalent all over India, I think.
