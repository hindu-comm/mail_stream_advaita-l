Rig Veda 9.73.7

sahasradhAre vitate pavitra A vAchaM punanti kavayo manIShiNaH |
rudrAsa eShAmiShirAso adruha spashaH svaJNchaH sudR^isho nR^ichakShasaH ||

VAlmIKi, who has his senses under control, who has infinite wisdom and
is skilled in writing poetry, with his verses of the rAmAyaNa purifies
speech itself in that infinitely purifying stream, the all-pervading
Ishvara whom he extols. Among poets like VAlmIki is the revered HanumAn
(who is an aMsha of Rudra Himself), who moves very swiftly, who bears
malice towards none, whose is excellent in judgement, and who is in
search of sItA and sees Her. HanumAn's poetic skills are no less than
VAlmIki's because He narrated the story of rAma (to sItA in the
ashoka-vana).

Rig Veda 9.73.8

R^itasya gopA na dabhAya sukratustrI Sha pavitrA hR^idyantarA dadhe |
vidvAn.h sa vishvA bhuvanAbhi pashyatyavAjuShTAn.h vidhyati karte
avratAn.h ||

The fruits realized by him who purifies speech by extolling Ishvara are
now stated. He cannot be anyone but a protector of AtmavidyA. He is
free from hypocrisy, wretchedness, etc. He is endowed with the triad
of GYAna, compassion, and valor. He knows the Self and sees the universe
in its entirety. He protects the helpless and destroys his enemies with
his valor.

Note:

 nIlakaNTha observes that the three purifiers (trINi pavitrANi) described
 here, GYAna, dayA, and shaurya are also mentioned in other sources.
 "na hi GYAnena sadR^isham.h" - there is no purifier comparable to GYAna
 "na dayAsadR^isho dharmaH" - there is no dharma comparable to compasssion
 "lokAn.h prayAntu ripavo .api hi shastrapUtAH" - Being purified by (being
 pierced by) My weapons, may even the enemies attain higher worlds.
 The last quote is from the devI-mAhAtmya. The valor in battle of warriors
 like shrI rAmabhadra and the devI is also meant for the ultimate good of
 the enemies that they slay in battle. They cannot actually cause harm to
 anyone, even in battle.

I received a mail from Shri. SwamiNarayan. Now should I send my reply to
this mail.
Dear Shri. SwamiNarayanan,
Namaskarams. Thanks for your kind reply.
REg Hare Krishna movement, I have been involved with this movement for the
last 4 years  or so. The philosophy is bakthi and does go along with
Sanatana Dharma  to the extent I understood the movement. They definitely
try to propogate Bhakthiwhich according to them is the Highest even above
Jnana. Whereas Advaita , as I understand says that Jnana is The Highest and
is attained through Gurubakthi and Bagavadbakthi, iskcon differs in this.
They agree with Sayujya mukthi but say that it is an inferior form of
liberation  and callit as Brahmajyothi liberation which  they say is the
liberation into the effulgence of the Supreme Lord Shri Krishna and is not
enjoyable according to them and they also say that the souls who attain this
BrahmaJyothi liberation due to inactivity come back to earth i.e. fall back.
I donot accept this as this appears to be against Advaitha Moksha.They also
cite quite a few verses from BagavadGita and Shrimad Bagavatham to
substantiate their argument.I will send you those verses if you are interested.
But all said and done, the iskcon movement is trying to foster Bhakthi and
propogate the NaamaUtchaaranam of The Almighty Krishna and Rama (The
HolyNames of The Lord being nondifferent from The Lord Himself) but they
criticise Advaitists so much that it is irritating to me.
Sorry to bore you
