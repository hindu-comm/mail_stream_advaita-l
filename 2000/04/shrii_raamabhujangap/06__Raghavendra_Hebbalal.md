Bliss; who is the repository of the innumerable good
qualities,while Himself not needing any support,who is
the most worshipful,who is all pervading, the most
resplendent one, who is enthroned in the hearts of all
beings,who is above all the three guNas of sattva,
rajas and tamas,who is free of all materialistic
pleasures and who is Self-supporting.

Corrections are welcome.

Raghavendra.
