yadaa : when
mat-samiipam : near me
kR^itaantaH : Lord Yama,
sametya : approaches,
prachaNDa-prataapair-bhaTair : with his attendants of
                               ferocious valour,
bhiiSayen-maam : frightening me,
tadaa-aviShkaroShi : then you display,
tvadiiya.m svaruupa.m : your own form (as shrii raama)
tad-aapat-praNaasha.m : capable of destroying dangers
,
sakodaNDabaaNam : with your famous kOdaNDa bow and
                  quiver of arrows.

O shrii raama! At the time of death, Lord Yama
approaches me with his ferocious attendants,
frightening me. Then You display your form with
the kodaNDa bow and arrow, which is capable of
destroying all miseries.

shrii raama is known as kodaNDa-paaNi, the one holding
the kodaNDa bow. This bow was given by shrii agastya
to shrii raama during His exile in the daNDaka forest.


The story of ajAmiLa in the shriimad-bhaagavata is
brought to mind by this shloka.

Corrections are welcome.

Raghavendra.
