              With a smile like shining moonlight
              playing on the beautiful red lips,

              With a brilliance unmatched by
              millions of rising Suns and Moons,

              With feet worshipped by,
sphurat-kaanti-niiraajana :
              the aarati (niiraajana) in the form of
              radiating lustre,
namad.h-brahma-rudraadi-koTiiraratna :
              from the millions of gems adorning the
              crowns of the prostrating brahma,
              rudra and other gods.

A moonlight-like shining smile plays on the beautiful
crimson lips of the Lord. His brilliance is unmatched
even by millions of rising Suns and Moons. His feet
are worshipped by the aarati of the radiating lustre
from the millions of gems adorning the crowns
of the prostrating brahma,rudra and other gods.

shrii raama is the paranjyoti, the Supreme
Illuminator,who is beyond every other
light including the Sun and the Moon !
This reminds me of the Geeta shloka 15-6
'na tadbhaasayate suuryo na shashaa~nkona paavakaH |'
and so on and similar mantras from the katha and
muNDaka upanishads which state 'neither the sun nor
the moon nor the fire light It (the abode of the
Lord)'.


The scenario of the niiraajana from the crowns of
prostrating gods is seen even in the shivanandalaharii

stOtra of shrii shankara (verse 65).
'koTiirojjvala-ratna-diipakalikaa-niiraajanam
kurvate'.

The same has been used in shrii tyaagaraja's famous
krithi 'shambhO mahAdeva'. 'sura-vrinda-kiriiTa-maNii-
vara-niirajita-pada'. shrii tyaagaraaja,one of the
Trinity of Carnatic music, was one of the greatest
composer-musicians of South Indian music.
