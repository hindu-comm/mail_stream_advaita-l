It is a very enlightening  thread that you have
started by posting this stuti on Lord Rama by Shri
Shankara.
Indeed Rama and Shiva are verily one and the same!How
Indeed, Shankara leads us to Advaitic thoughts by his
such immortal Hyms.We eagerly await the rest of the
slokas and your word to word meanings which make your
postings very useful for laymen like me who are not so
adept in Sanskrit .

Regards,

Swaminarayan
