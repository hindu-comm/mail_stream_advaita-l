(rescuing devotees from the ocean of samsaara (the
                              ephemeral world))
bhaje.aha.m : I adore (worship)

I adore shrii raama ,the Unity, the greatest one,
whose name is uttered in the ears of the blessed
devotees in Kaashi at the time of Death by none other
than Lord Shiva Himself. This form/name of the Lord
(taarakabrahma) is capable of rescuing devotees from
the ocean of samsaara.

Note:
It is a well known belief that Lord Shiva utters raama
naama in the ears of dying devotees in kaashi, on the
banks of the Holy Ganga, thereby granting them mOksha.

Lord Shiva is known for His Love of raama naama.
In the phala shruthi of the Sri VishhNu sahasranaama,
He answers Goddess Parvathi's question as to how the
names of Lord VishNu are remembered by learned ones as
"shriiraamaraamaraameti rame raame manOrame |
 sahasranaama tattulya.m raama naama varaanane ||"

The thousand names of Lord VishhNu are equivalent to
one raama naama recited
as "shrii raama raama ...".

Corrections and improvements are welcome.

Raghavendra.
