Dear Shri Sadananda,   PraNaams.

> Please allow me to express some thoughts that came to my mind on reading the

> me if they are wrong.

1)  Ajnanam is not absence of jnanam. It is a separate indefinable entity ,
which is anaadi but has an anta. Jnanam is eternal -  anadi as well as ananta.
Is it then correct to say  that  ajnanam has to go, and jnanam has to come (as
if jnanam was temporarily absent). Is it not that only  the ajnanam which is
veiling the jnanam has to go. There is no question of jnanam coming.  Jnanam is
always there.  Like the Sun may not be seen when it is hidden by a cloud.  All
that is needed is for the cloud to go away, not for the sun to start shining
afresh; it has always been shining, even when you were not able to see it shine.

2) In the case of the rope-snake example, the adhyasa is caused by the dim light
which prevents the ropeness from being perceived. A torch removes this
impediment to perception and thus reveals the truth. It does not produce the
truth. There is no adhyaasa when it is totally dark nor when there is Light.
Should we not therefore say that it is  the dim light which  is the cause of the
adhyaasa ?

3)  How do you distinguish between  anyatha grahaNam (standpoint of the rope)
and adhyaaropa (standpoint of the snake) ?

4)   Consider two scenarios :

       (i) There is a rope. In dim light I see it as a snake. I suffer fear
because of my erroneous perception. This is a  case of adhyaasa.
       (ii) There is a snake. In dim light I see it as a rope. It is quite
possible that the snake just slithers away and I come to no harm. Nevertheless I
did  have an erroneous perception.  What would  my erroneous perception in this
case be called ?

5)   Verse 10-6-8 of Srimad Bhagavatam describes  Puutanaa's erroneous
perception thus:

anantam-aaropayad-ankam-antakam
yathaa-uragam suptam-abuddhi-rajjudhii.h

Baby krishna pretending to be asleep  in the cradle
was really a snake (pun on the word ananta)who was to put an end to her life
(antakam).  But Puutanaa mistook the sleeping snake (suptam uragam) to be a
piece of rope (rajjudhii.h)      and put him on her lap (ankam aaropayat).

5) Is the verse      "gaganam gaganaakaaram ..."
 from Valmiiki RaamaayaNam ?  Incidentally, saagara is a masculine noun and so
it should perhaps  read "saagarassaagaropama.h"

> Before entering into the discussion of Brahmasuutra, Shankara provides an

> means an error or a mistake.  In this bhaashhyam Shankaraachaarya
> establishes the central cause for samsaara or human suffering, and it is due

> error or how did the error arise?  Errors can arise because of different
> reasons.  For example, when I do not know and I still act, I commit a
> mistake or an error.  Even if I do not know that I do not know, I still
> commit a mistake.  For example, lack of knowledge of the required language
> skills can be the cause of some of the errors in these notes.  Here the lack
> of knowledge or ignorance is the cause.  Sometimes even if I know, I still
> can make mistakes as in the typographical errors in this notes.  Here too,
> if one analyzes carefully, the error is due to non-awareness or ignorance as
> the basic problem, since I am not conscious of what I am typing in relation
> to what I want to type.  Errors can also arise if the instruments of
> knowledge are defective, like if I am, say, color blind or if there is
> insufficient illumination.  In all these cases I am still ignorant of the
> truth and more importantly I take the false as real.  Sometimes there is a
> double jeopardy since I not only take false as real but also real as false.
> In all these commissions,  there is always a price I have to pay for
> committing an error.  Thus there is always some suffering associated with
> it.  If the error is not there, the associated suffering will also be not
> there.  Thus fundamentally the root cause  for all errors is lack of
> appropriate knowledge.  Hence any error arises because of ignorance or
> aJNaanam.  Therefore aJNaanam causes adhyaasa, error, and adhyaasa causes
> samsaara, suffering.  For samsaara to go, adhyaasa should go, for adhyaasa
> to go aJNaanam should go, and for aJNaanam to go knowledge should come.
> Hence Shankara says in VivekachuuDaamani,

> 3.2 Example of adhyaasa:

> meaning, when there is a rope in front of us which is not clearly visible

>

>   When there is a partial light, then we know there is something in front of

> don't know.  That there is something is called 'saamaanya JNaanam' or

> exists) is called 'saamaanya amsha' (general existent part).  The saamaanya
> amsha is not covered by darkness since we know that something exists there.
> Hence it is also called 'anaavR^ita amsha' (uncovered part).  Since the
> existence of something is real, it is also called 'satya amsha' or real

>
> Since light is dull, that the existent thing is 'a rope' - that aspect is
> covered, which is the particular feature of the existent object.  The
> 'ropeness' of the object is covered, which is the specific feature of that

> called 'visheshha amsha' also 'aavRita amsha' or covered part.  'There is a
> rope' is a fact or real.  Of this total fact, one part is covered and
> another part is not covered.  Of the total statement, 'there is a rope',
> 'there is' -,  that part (saamaanya amsha) of the knowledge is not covered
> and ' a rope' - that part  (visheshha amsha) is covered.  When the visheshha
> amsha is covered, the mind projects with another visheshha amsha - which is
> 'a snake'.  Hence 'snakeness' is the replaced visheshha amsha in the place
> of 'ropeness'.  We are not replacing saamaanya amsha or satya amsha or real
> part but we are replacing only the visheshha amsha, a particular part, with
> a snake which is mithyaa or anR^itam or not real.
>
> Thus when we say 'there is a snake' it consists of two parts - saamaanya
> amsha, which is real and visheshha amsha which is unreal or anR^itam.
> Therefore in every error there is satya saamaanya amsha and mithyaa

> snake is now replaced by the rope.  Where did the snake go?  - the snake was

> ignorance created a snake out of the rope?  Both questions will sound as
> ridiculous since there was never a snake where the rope is, for it to be

> there is indeed a snake where the rope is.   But when we ask him later why
> he saw the snake there when it is a rope, his only answer is - I didnít know

> snake creation in his mind.  These concepts need to be clearly understood

>
> Now when the light is shown, the reality of the object gets revealed by
> itself, since it is real, and the unreality disappears by itself since it is
> unreal.  The correction is not in the saamaanya amsha but only in the
> visheshha amsha.  When this correction takes place in the visheshha amsha,
> the fear caused by that unreal snake is also gone.  The fears and
> tribulations are all related to the visheshha amsha, which is unreal and not
> to the saamaanya amsha, which is real.  Thus when the inquiry is done about
> the nature of the visheshha amsha using a valid means of inquiry, in this
> case, say a torch light, then the reality of the object in total is known.
> The method of inquiry should be appropriate since the error is due to

> japa or meditation on the rope ' idam rajjuH, idam rajjuH', 'this is a rope,
> this is a rope' etc., will help reveal the rope in the place of a snake.

> 3.4. Role of adhyaasa in Vedanta:
>
> Similar to the case of rope-snake case,  when a person says 'aham samsaarii'
> - 'I am a samsaarii',  Shankaraachaarya says here too there is a 'saamaanya
> amsha' and 'visheshha amsha'.  "I am' in the above statement is the
> saamaanya amsha, which refers to 'a conscious being' - conscious
> corresponding to 'chit' and 'being' corresponding to 'sat'. It is anaavR^ita
> amsha or uncovered part and is also 'satya amsha', part that is real.  In
> fact this part is never covered or eternally true and  is self evident or
> ever evident or 'pratibodha viditam' or JNaanaswaruupam, of the nature of
> the knowledge.  That is, I am not only conscious but also I am
> 'self-conscious' - and therefore require no means of knowledge, pramaaNa, to
> know that I exist.  I know that I am there even when it is pitch dark
> outside.  Hence this particular saamaanya amsha is never covered - in fact
> nothing can cover it!
>
> In the above statement there is also a visheshha amsha, a particular part -
> 'a samsaarii', which is unreal like our snake.  The unreal 'visheshha amsha'
> has come into existence only because of the covering of real visheshha
> amsha.  Therefore covering as well as uncovering belongs only to 'visheshha
> amsha' and not to saamaanya amsha.  What is that real visheshha amsha that
> is covered - Sat and Chit are evident in the saamaanya amsha.  Then what is
> covered is aananda (bliss) amsha, or anantatva (unlimited) amsha, or
> puurNatva (complete) amsha or Brahmatva (infiniteness) amsha or in effect
> 'asamsaaritva amsha'.  That is the visheshha amsha that is covered.  In that
> place we have unreal visheshha amsha ' duHkii, (miserable) or asampuurNaH
> (incomplete) or parichchhinnaH(limited) or samsaarii'.  Hence ' aham
> samsaaari or jiivaH' is an error and is the cause for all the human
> suffering.  Therefore to solve the problem of human suffering there is no
> need to change the real part (in fact one cannot change it) that is the
> saamaanya amsha, which is 'I am', but only remove the visheshha amsha called
> 'samsaarii'.  This has to be done by putting a 'torch light' to reveal the
> real visheshha amsha that 'aham asamsaarii' or 'aham Brahma asmi'.  The
> torchlight is 'the Vedanta Knowledge' that is required to reveal the true
> visheshha amsha.  'aham asmi' is common both in the samsaarii state and in
> the realized state.  In the samsaarii state, I have knowledge only as ' aham
> samsaarii asmií , which is replaced by real knowledge, that 'aham Brahma
> asmi'.  The change is taking place only in the visheshha amsha, anR^ita
> amsha or mityaa amsha, the unreal part -just as the change is taking place
> from mityaa 'snake' to real 'rope'.  Hence 'I am the samsaarii' notion goes
> away and is replaced by 'I am asamsaarii or puurNaH' knowledge comes and
> that is the aim of all the prasthaanatraya, Upanishads, Geeta and
> Brahmasuutra.
>
> 3.5 Examination of adhyaasa:
>
> This adhyaasa or error can be defined differently by looking at it from
> different angles - As mentioned before the study of knowledge and error
> comes under the science of epistemology.  There are differences of opinions
> about error (some may be erroneous too!) and these are called 'khyaati
> vaada' or analysis of errors.  From the standpoint of rope, one can call it
> as 'misapprehension' of rope - mistaking (missing the rope and taking the
> snake!) the rope is an error.  In Sanskrit it is called 'anyathaa grahaNam
> or anyathaa khyaati'.  The same error can be defined from the standpoint of
> snake also.  From the point of snake error is 'superimposition of a snake',
> that is a non-existent snake is superimposed on the existing object.  This
> is called 'addhaaropa' or 'adhyaasa'.  A third definition is both from the
> point of rope and snake.  From this point an error is a combination or
> mixing of some parts of real rope and some parts of unreal snake.  When we
> say 'there is a snake', in that 'there is'- belongs to rope, which is
> saamaanya amsha, which is real.  Hence the statement ''there is a snake'
> involves a real saamaanya amsha and unreal visheshha amsha.  Hence error
> involves mixing up of satyam, real, and asatyam or unreal or anR^itam.
> Hence error is defined as 'satyaanR^ita mithuniikaraNam' - mixing up of real
> and unreal.  By the mixing up of the two entities, real and unreal, a third
> singular entity is created that involves parts of the real and part of the
> unreal.  A fellow while seeing a rope says 'there is a snake'.  While
> saying, he does not know that there are two entities, real and unreal, which
> he is mixing.  The problem is,  in principle, is inconsequential, but for
> the fact that he is having a real suffering as a consequence of the mistaken
> identity or the presence of unreal snake.  From our point who knew the whole
> truth, he is mixing up of the two entities.  From the mistaker point, he is
> not aware of the two things.  In his cognition, there is only one entity but
> only on analysis we find that in his unitary perception there is a satya
> amsha and anR^ita amsha.  When he says 'the snake is frightening' -
> frightening part belongs to anR^ita amsha, the snake, whereas the 'is' part
> belongs to the satya amsha, the rope.  'It is a long snake' - the length
> belongs to the rope and it is therefore satya amsha.  "It is a poisonous
> snake' - the poisonous part belongs to snake which is anR^ita amsha. ' It is
> a curved snake' - the curved part belongs to rope, hence satya amsha.  Hence
> a peculiar mixture of some aspects which are satyam and some aspects which
> are anR^itam.  He mixes them both to arrive at one unitary entity.
>
> Similarly when a person says 'I am so and so' - he takes himself as one
> unitary entity but Shankara says there are two aspects mixed in that
> statement - a satya amsha and anR^ita amsha, creating a jiiva who is
> miserable.  When he says 'I am existent conscious being' - existent and
> conscious are from satya amsha. When he say 'I am a fat person' - fat person
> is anR^ita amsha.  Hence jiiva is neither pure aatma nor pure anaatma, it is
> a mixture of aatma and anaatma, satya and anR^ita amsha.  It is this mixed
> unitary entity, jiiva, is striving for liberation.  This missing up is
> called 'error' called 'satyaanR^ita mithuniikaraNam.
> The purpose of Brahmasuutra is to inquire into the nature of jiiva to
> discard the unreal part and to get established in the real part.  In this
> process, the samsaara which is associated with the unreal part gets
> dissolved and that is Moksha or liberation.  This is the general background
> on adhyaasa.
>
> 3.6 Shankara's discussion of adhyaasa:
>
> The discussion of Shankaraachaarya on adhyaasa bhaashhyam can be broadly
> classified into six subtopics: 1. adhyaasa shankhaa (objections to the
> theory of error) 2. adhyaasa shankhaa samaadhaanam (answering to the
> objections) 3. adhyaasa lakshaNam (the definition of error) 4. adhyaasa
> sambhaavanaa (showing the possibility of error) 5. adhyaasa pramaaNa (proof
> for adhyaasa) 6. adhyaasa upasamhaaraH (conclusion of the adhyaasa topic).
> For convenience, we take the third topic first, adhyaasa lakshaNam, the rest
> of the topics will be discussed in the order.
>
> 3.7 Definition or lakshaNa for adhyaasa:
>
> Shankara gives two definitions for adhyaasa.  An additional third definition
> is indirectly available and is often quoted.  The first definition is:
>
>       'smR^iti ruupaH, paratra puurva dR^ishhTaavabhaasaH adhyaasaH'|
>
> meaning 'the perception of a previously experienced object on a wrong locus'
>   - In the rope-snake example, one is perceiving a snake - a snake which is
> already experienced before.  A person who has never seen a snake will not
> mistake a rope for a snake.  I am superimposing an experienced snake upon a
> wrong locus, which is a rope.  This is called an error.
>
> Second definition which is more popular and simpler and that is:
> 'atasmin tat buddhiH'  meaning 'perception of an object on a wrong locus' -
> The snake is seen on a wrong locus that is the rope.  Or perception of
> silver on a shell.
>
> The third indirect definition is what was discussed before 'satyaanR^ita
> mithuniikaraNam' - mixing up of real and unreal.
>
> When I say 'I am the body' - the error is seeing the body on a wrong locus
> 'aatma'  which is not the body.  I, the immortal, is seen as the mortal - I,
> the all pervading, is seen as the limited - This is the error.
>
> This is the adhyaasa lakshaNam.
>
> 3.8 Objections to adhyaasa -adhyaasa Shankhaa:
>
> The objections are raised by all other systems of philosophies, saankhya,
> yoga, vaiseshika etc., who claim that adhyaasa introduction is an improper
> introduction because aatma-anaatma adhyaasa is impossible.  Rope-snake
> adhyaasa is possible which can be accepted but not aatma-anaatma adhyaasa.
> To establish that the puurvapakshi (the objector) gives the following
> reasons.  Any super imposition like rope-snake super imposition requires
> four conditions to be satisfied simultaneously.  Only if all the four
> conditions are fulfilled then this satyaanR^ita mithuniikaraNam can occur
> otherwise it is not possible.  In the case of aatma-anaatma adhyaasa not a
> single one of the four conditions is satisfied.  Hence the idea of adhyaasa
> is itself an adhyaasa or a mistake.
>
> Let us illustrate the four conditions using the rope-snake example.  First,
> the rope is a 'pratyaksha vishaya', a directly perceivable object in front.
> Hence the first condition is 'pratyaksha vishayatvam', an object which is
> directly perceivable in front. That is 'there is a rope in front', for
> anyone to mistake it as a snake.  The second condition is that the rope

> The fourth condition is samskaaraH - Advaitin claims anaatma is unreal and
