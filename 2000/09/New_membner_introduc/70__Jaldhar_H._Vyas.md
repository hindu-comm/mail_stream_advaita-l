Dear Devotees,

My interest in advaita-vedanta stems from what little knowledge
I have about the system which coincides extraordinarily well
with my personal beliefs. This has created a thirst in me to
learn more. I stumbled across this list accidentally from a
post on a Visishtadvaita list.

About me as an individual - I am an electrical engineer based
in the silicon valley and a smartha brahmin by birth and
ancestry. I look forward to dispelling my ignorance and
learning from other members on this list.

Respectfully,
Shuba.
