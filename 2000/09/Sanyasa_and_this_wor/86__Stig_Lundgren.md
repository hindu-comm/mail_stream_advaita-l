Well, the earth doesnÂ´t have any real existence in itself. The empirical world is a result from adhyasa (superimposition). In other words, when you through jnana get rid of ignorance and superimposition, then only brahman remains. So if every being attains moksha, then there is no superimposition. And since the universe and all the planets are results of the very same superimposition, there are --from the paramArtha standpoint -- no universe or planets . So total moksha can never results in anything such as an unpopulated Earth!

Warmest regards
