namaste SVS:

 Thanks for your initiative to start a series on tattva bodha for
advaita-L (and Advaitin). You can also refer to the following work on
InterNet. Sri Swami Atmananda Saraswathi started a series on tattva
bodha long  back for one of his mailing-lists and it is compiled here.

It is not complete though. Swamiji was once a member of Advaita-L and
also a member of Advaitin. I do not know whether he is still a member
of Advaitin. May be you can contact swamiji (atma at india.com) and ask
whether you can use his material, I am confident that he will approve
that.


Thanks again and I look forward to reading your series.

Ravi
