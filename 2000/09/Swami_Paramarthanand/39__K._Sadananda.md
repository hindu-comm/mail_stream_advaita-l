Thanks Aravind for bringing website information about Swami
Paramaarthanandaji.  He is a great teacher and I learned so  much from him.
As I pointed out to in my preface,  most of the notes on BSB draws directly
from his lectures.  The website also provides a condesed version of these
notes - provides very good review of the talks he gave.  I hope to get hold
of his tapes when I go to India, so that the errors in my notes will be
minimized - there are more than 200 to 300 casetts on BSB and it will be a
treasure.

This discussion format we have in the list serve is extremely useful for
all of us if eveyone participates on the discussions so that all of us can
get benefit from these notes.  I hope to put together the notes and the
discussions in a volume so that those who are not so fortunate to listen to
Swamiji's lectures can also get benefit of the study.

His lectures are real blessings to all of us.

Hari Om!
Sadananda
