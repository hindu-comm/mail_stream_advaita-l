As I'm going through some personal problems right now, my Mother-in-law
recommended I recite he following stotra.

|| atha saNkaTanAshanaM gaNesha stotram ||

The Trouble-destroying Ganesh Stotra

nAraduvAca |

Narada Said:

praNamya shirasA devaM gaurIputraM vinAyakam |
bhaktAvAsaM smarennityamAyuH kAmArtha siddhaye || 1 ||

I bow my head down to the God Vinayaka son of Gauri,
The refuge of the Bhaktas I remember always for long life and the
fulfillment of desires.

prathamaM vakratuNDaM cha ekadantaM dvitIyakam |
trtIyaM krshNapiMgAkshaM gajavaktraM chaturthakam || 2 ||

His first (name) is Vakratunda[1], and Ekadanta[2] the second,
The third is Krishnapingaksha[3], and Gajavaktra[4] the fourth. (2)

laMbodaraM paMchamaM cha shaShTaM vikaTameva cha |
saptamaM vighnarAjaM cha dhumravarNaM tathA'ShTamam || 3 ||

And Lambodara[5] the fifth and the sixth is Vikata[6],
The seventh Vighnaraja[7] also Dhumravarna[8] is the eighth. (3)

navamaM bhAlachandraM cha dashamaM tu vinAyakam |
ekAdashaM gaNapatiM dvAdashaM tu gajAnanam || 4 ||

The nineth is Bhalachandra[9] and the tenth Vinayaka[10] |
The eleventh Ganapati[11], and the twelveth Gajanana[12]. (4)

dvAdashaitAni nAmAni trisaMdhaM yaH paThennaraH |
na cha vighnabhayaM tasya sarvasiddhikaraM param || 5 ||

[13]That man who recites these twelve names at the three sandhyas[14],
Does not fear obstacles and all his wishes are fulfilled. (5)

vidyArthI labhate vidyAM dhanArthIm labhate dhanaM |
putrArthI labhate putrAn mokShArthI labhate gatim || 6 ||

He who desires  knowledge gets knowledge, he who desires wealth, gets wealth,
He who desires sons gets sons, and he who seeks Moksha attains the goal. (6)

japedgaNapatistotraM ShaDbhirmAsaiH phalam labhet |
saMvatsareNa siddhiM cha labhate nAtra saMshayaH || 7 ||

If this Ganapati Stotra is recited for siz months, one should see results,
In a year the goal will be achieved of this there is no doubt. (7)

aShTAbhyo brahmaNebhyashcha likhitvA yaH samarpayet |
tasya vidyA bhavetsarvA gaNeshasya prasAdataH || 8 ||

If this knowledge is written down and given to eight Brahmans
One will gain the full grace of Ganesh. (8)

Thus ends the Trouble-Destroying Ganesh Stotra from the Narada Purana.

[1] Whose trunk is crooked.

[2] Who has one tusk.  The vahana of Ganesh Bhagawan is a rat.  Once,
after Ganesh Chaturthi Ganesh Bhagawan (no lightweight under the best
circumstances!) was especially loaded up with ladoos and the poor rat
could take it no more and collapsed tossing Ganesh Bhagawan on the
ground.  The moon who was watching all this laughed at Him.  So He grew
angry and broke of a tusk and threw it at the Moon causing it to
disappear.

[3] Who has black and tawney eyes.

[4] Who has an elephants face. see [12].

[5] Whose stomach is big and round.

[6] Who is formidable.  No foe can withstand Him.

[7] The Lord of Obstacles.  Once Shiva Bhagawan had gone away to practice
Yoga and so Gauri Ma retired to Her own place to do the same.  She
fashioned a little boy out of the chandana on Her body and breathed life
into him.  She told him to stand guard and let no one pass.  Eventually
Shiva Bhagawan came back and sent Nandi and His other servants ahead to
announce His arrival.  But they were unable to get past the boy.  Even the
entire army of Ganas were unable to pass.  Finally Shiva Bhagawan Himself
came and angrily cused the boys head to fall off.  Amba Ma was distraught
and begged Shiva Bhagawan to restore the boy to life so He did (see
[12]) and made him the Chief of the Ganas and Lord of obstacles.

[8] Of the color of smoke.

[9] Son of he who wears the moon as a crown i.e. Shankara Bhagawan.

[10] Remover (of obstacles.)  See [7].

[11] The Lord of the Ganas.  The Bhutas and Pishachas who are the army of
Shiva Bhagawan are called Ganas.  He is their general just as His elder
brother Skandha Bhagawan is general of the Devas.

[12] Who has the head of an elephant.  After Shiva Bhagawan had cut off
the young boys head, He sent His servant Nandi to walk North and bing back
the head of the first creature he saw.  This turned out to be Indras'
elephant Airavata.  The elephants head was then affixed to the body.

[13] The next four verses are the phalashruti -- advertising if you will
of the efficacy of the stotra.

[14]  I.e. Morning, noon, and night.
