I have personal knowledge of troubles being mitigated by
following the saMkaShTa-chaturthI-vrata in the case of
a close relative of mine. This vrata is quite popular
in Southern India and of course, Maharashtra. It is
observed on the fourth tithi of the dark fortnight of every
month. In Mysore, where I grew up, we used to attend the
Ganesha puja on every saMkaShTa-chaturthI in a temple.

I could post  details on how to follow it but I feel
it is far better to approach a qualified brAhmaNa and learn
it directly thus.

Incidentally today is a saMkaShTa-chaturthI!
