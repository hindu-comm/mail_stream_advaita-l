 I am sorry for making a somewhat misleading statement "No. Because
 the snake is not real." What I meant is that the ignorance of the
 rope is precisely unreal because that ignorance is "nivartya",
 meaning it can be sublated. Why? Because instead of a cognition
 of a rope there is a cognition of the snake. If there were to be a
 real snake instead of a rope, then the rope will never be seen.
 For example, imagine the following. Suppose there is a real snake
 in a room, not a rope. A person who walks into the room sees the
 snake and he will never see the rope. It is only when the snake
 is illusory that the ignorance of the rope can be sublated.

 To clarify by another example, suppose a person is seeing an
 illusory snake, instead of a rope. Suppose further that this person
 is joined by a blind person who sees nothing, neither the snake nor
 the rope. What is common between the two persons is that they both
 are ignorant of the rope. But the ignorance of the person with eyesight
 is not the same as the ignorance of the blind person. The ignorance of
 the person with eyesight will be sublated, for sure,  when the snake is
 realized as illusory.  Actually, we cannot even say that the blind
 person is having an illusion.

 What Anandagiri says is that mithyAjnAna is upAdAna of the adhyAsa,
 mithyA cha tadajnAnaM cha tannimittam-upAdAnaM yasya so .adhyAsaH.
 So the mithyAjnAna is the material cause of adhyAsa of the world
 on Brahman. To clarify further what mithyAjnana means, let us look at
 what the bhAShya-ratnaprabhA of GovindAnanda says:

 mithyAtve sati sAxAjjnAnanivartyamajnAnasya laxaNaM mithyAjnAna-
 padenoktam.h |

 Being unreal, it is removed by direct jnAna (direct realization).
 This is the characteristic of the ajnAna (under consideration)
 and is meant by the word "mithyAjnAna."

 It is this mithyAjnAna that is the upAdAna of adhyAsa.

Consider this. A person who does not know X at all can be said to
have an ignorance of X. This ignorance can be removed by knowing
X. If the person knows X, not as X, but as Y (ie. adhyAsa of Y on X),
even then there is an ignorance of X. Even this ignorance can be
removed by knowing X as it is. Once X is known, the person feels,
"X was never Y, it is not Y now, and it never will be Y." Another
way of saying this is that the igorance of X here was itself
unreal. This unreal ignorance of X is what is called mithyAjnAna.

That is correct but this whole business of defining adhyAsa is
only for those who are about to inquire into Brahman (athAto brahma-
jijnAsA). Those who have realized don't have to worry about adhyAsa
at all.
