Yes I know that and,

it is also to be tied, as an open tuft is a symbol of impurity and/or
mourning.

But I wanted to know how. Like the janeu makes one a dvija and entitles one
to study the 3 Vedas, what specific karma or thing is associated with the
Shikha. I know that the Shankaracharyas keep asking us to keep a Shikha, and
during the last 4 months, 3.5 of which I was in India, I came across several
people and some sadhus who commended me on keeping one.

I have vaguely heard things about Shikha being somehow related to the
Brahmarandra chakra at the top of the head but I wanted to know exactly the
what/how/whys.

Interestingly, our family punditji also told me that Bholenath is the ishta
devataa of all Brahamans. I was searching for the info on Rudraksha and
found that Tattvaloka had printed an article some time back. It is at
http://www.svbf.org/sringeri/journal/vol2no1/index.html
