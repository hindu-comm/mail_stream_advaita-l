That's an interesting question.  The earliest reference I have seen is in
the Katyayana Shrauta sutra where when discussing the preliminaries of the
darshapaurnamaseshti (a yajna which is performed every new and full moon)
it says, "Optionally he should shave his head except the shikha."  So
already by this time it seems the practice was so common it could be
assumed without further explanation.
