I have the pleasure to introduce my self as a self-employed businessman with
deep interest in comparitive religion with emphasis on Hinduism and
Buddhism. I am 55 years of age and having discharge my responsibilies
towards family more or less, am able to devote sufficient time from now
onwards to persue my interest in deeper understanding of subject like
Vedant, Vedas and Gita.
The first book on Vedant which I had the pleasure to pick up way back in
1970 was "Vedant for Modern Man" edited by Christopher Ishewood.
I have not been exposed to thoughts of Shanker on this deep subject would
like to take this opportunity to get myself introduced and exchange notes
with member of the study group.
Thanks again.
