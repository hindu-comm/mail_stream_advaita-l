How?  The necessity of Vedantic Sadhana (which in the final analysis is
just as unreal as kama etc.) is because it doesn't just describe WHAT the
problem is but HOW to overcome it.  Wise men may have different thoughts
on what are the correct methods but all must agree there is a method or
else we are just wasting time.

The vast majority of problems are internal, i.e. caused by our defective
reasoning or mental state.  But not all of them.  Sometimes the external
ones are more important.  Why did Krishna bother helping Arjuna?  Why did
the Sringeri Jagadgurus help the Vijayanagara empire?  Because in those
cases the cause of dharma was better served by outward action than
inward.

Being enamored of "hypermodern" fads instead of the truth is also
something to be won over. :-)

If it is "instead of" than it is just playing politics.  It should be
"along with"  The ability to discriminate between right and wrong is an
essential part of that self-purification.  We do not countenance fools and
knaves in any other field of human endeavor.  Why should we do so in the
field of Vedanta which is knowledge that can be acquired like any other
knowledge?

Bravo to Chaitanya Bhagavat and all those who are choosing the right way
over the easy way.
