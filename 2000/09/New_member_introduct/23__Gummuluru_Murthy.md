namaste shri Chaitanya,

Please do not take my posts as indicating that I am counter-advocating
against your well-judged 'choice of path'. Your words of wisdom echo
very well and I salute you for it and there is a lot to learn from you.
I also find shri Hudli's article to be a wise advice for people drifting
of in all directions. I follow the same sAdhanA that you and shri Hudli
so eloquently presented.

My comment is: should one get rattled by these alternate 'paths' of the
so-called new-age gurus? Yes, we see the danger of following those
directions. But, where is our sAdhana when we get upset at a new-age
guru when he/she says 'just be' or some other preyah path? sAdhana is
for betterment of ourselves so that we do not succomb to the six great
enemies which I mentioned in my earlier post.  By getting angry and
intolerant of such activities, are we not becoming prey to our own
anger and passion, thereby exhibiting to ourselves that our sAdhana
is not complete?

In any case, this is only a minor point in your letter of introduction.
Let us not dwell on this anymore and get to more serious discussion of
the essence of advaita as taught by shri shankara.

my praNAms to all.
