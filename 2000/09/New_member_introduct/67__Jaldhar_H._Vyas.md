 namaste ,

 I am a masters student.
 The reason for being attracted towards advaita is that
some time back i used to think that advaita has
something to do with shaivism.Now that misconception is
cleared.I am also interested in shrii vidyaa. Since
advaita bhaavam is essential for shrii vidyaa i thought
of learning vedanta. So, as one of the efforts for the
same ,i joined this list.

 Thanking every one,

   with regards,
     Satish.
