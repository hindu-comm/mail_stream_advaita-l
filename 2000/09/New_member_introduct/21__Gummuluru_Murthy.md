namaste.

The points made by shri jaldhar are well taken. I also congratulate
shri Chaitanya for the 'path taken'. It is indeed a wise understanding.
The reason for my last post was to say that the 'problem' and the
'solution' are within us only and are not caused 'because of something
else'.

My thanks to shri jaldhar for making his point and for being
ever-vigilant.

Regards
Gummuluru Murthy
