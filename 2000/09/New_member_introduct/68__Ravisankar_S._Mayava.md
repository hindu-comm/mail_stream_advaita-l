Satish,

Welcome. More than the confusion between advaita-vedAnta and shaivam,
the confusion that aiyar-s (tamil smArta brahamana-s) are shaiva-s is
more prevalent. In this regard I would like to direct you to an
excellent 20-part series posted by Dr. S. Marur titled "Sankara
Sampradhayam". If you search the Escribe archives with this title you
will get all the articles.

(May be we should compile this and keep it in our advaita-vedanta
site).


Also,  on the contrary, I was told that SrividyopAsana has some links
to kashmir shaiva tradition. It should be noted, however, that kashmir
shaivam is quite close to advaita-vedAnta unlike the shaiva-sidhhanta
which is dvaitic.

   i too read the same. i heard that the famous
commentator Abhinavagupta does not even spare
dualisitic shaivas in his criticism of schools other
than kashmira shaivam.
    One of the monks(shrii subhramuniya swami--kauii)
of shaiva siddhanta(SS) school claims that SS is
strongly advaitic and quotes extensively from
Tirumantiram and other agamas.however he agrees of a
slight difference.
 i personally feel that Tirumantiram has a slant
towards advaita.
