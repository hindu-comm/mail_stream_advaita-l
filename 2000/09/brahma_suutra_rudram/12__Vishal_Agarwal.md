Sri Mayavaram,

The URL of the website is

http://www.hindunet.org/forum/

At this site, click at 'Scriptures'

Recently, I resolved to cull beautiful passages from our Shastras and
eventually compile an anthology (on the net) for the guidance of Hindus.
Some work in this direction can already be seen at the aforementioned
website. As time permits, I shall search the Advaita and other lists for
similar endeavors and compile them.

The general ignorance of Hindus about our Dharmic texts is apalling.

Sincerely

Vishal

namaste  Vishal:

I am thankful for your initative to compile the brahmasuutra (KS) and
rudram (Anand).

Anand's contribution to this list are enormous. He has translated many
texts all along. Along with rudram an I would request you include his
current series on advaita-siddhi. Also can you send us the URL of the
location.




Thank you.

Ravi
