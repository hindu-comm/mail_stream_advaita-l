namaste  Vishal:

I am thankful for your initative to compile the brahmasuutra (KS) and
rudram (Anand).

Anand's contribution to this list are enormous. He has translated many
texts all along. Along with rudram an I would request you include his
current series on advaita-siddhi. Also can you send us the URL of the
location.




Thank you.

Ravi
