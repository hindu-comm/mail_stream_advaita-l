There will be a slight delay in posting the text in parts. The reason
being, I want to convert the sanskrit text to ITRANS for consistency.
Finally I have the copy of the text in sanskrit with me. It will take
some time for me to do that, as I want read to  Sanskrit original
little carefully before I embark on this project.

The book I have  is a funny one  to read because, it has along with
BSB, bhAmati, kalpataru and kalpataruparimaLa. Sankara's commentary
runs on the top margin of the book (with few lines, sometimes 1 or none
per page) and rest of the page is filled with the text from the other
subcommentaries. One has to flip 50-60 pages to read the adhyaasa
bhaashhya! which will probably fit in two sides of a paper. For every
line of shankara there is a page of sub-commentaries.



In any case if you are impatient, you are read it of the web.
