It is good to see that the discussion on the brahmasUtrabhAshya is gathering
momentum, while maintaining focus. If any list-member has access to
Anandagiri's sub-commentary (nyAyanirNaya) on this bhAshya, it would be good
to gather a few notes from that text too. Anandagiri's commentaries on
Sankara's texts are clear and concise, and they bring out the meaning
beautifully. They are extremely useful to the student of these texts.
