Hi Sri Ravi:
I just happened to see the following posting the
advaita-vedanta group re: my posting of the
devi navarAtri kIrtanaMs of mahArAjA svAti tirunAL.
(Appended below this letter, for quick reference)
Here is the clarification I can offer:

As I understand, and as is the common practice in all
the places I am aware of,,
the nine days are divided into 3+3+3,
Durga (first 3 days), Lakshmi (next 3 days)
and Sarasvati (last 3 days); and the Sarasvati
Puja is conducted on the nineth day, and Vijayadashami
is the grand finale! on the tenth day!

But, in the  write-up, I mentined that in the
Navarathri Mandapam in Trivandrum, the Navatarthri
Utsavam, as codified by the Chera Rulers, the
order is:   Devi is worshipped as Sarasvati during
the first 3 days, as Lakshmi in the next 3 days, and as
Durga during the last 3 days, This is  explicitly mentioned
in the Newspaper article I referred to in my posting. But,
the nine kIrtanams of svAti tirunAL have
first six songs on Sarasvati, and the last 3
on Parvati. (no song of Lakshmi specifically).  I
cannot understand the reason. But, in the Navarathri
Utsavam conducted at the Navarathri Mandamam in
the Fort Palace of Trivandrum, it is the custom
to sing the svAti tirunAL kIrtanams in the same
order as composed by him, one on each day - so
the songs for the first 3 days are on Sarasvati,
and the last 3 days on Parvati.  But I am still
puzzled why svAti tirunAL did not compose the
middle 3 songs on Laskhmi!!

Thanks
Narayanaswami

Subject: Re: AdhyAtmic significance of NavarAtrI

Namaskars everybody,
First of all I wish to thank Smt. Lathaji for the nice narration of
clips from Srimadbhaagavatam.

While Smt. Lathaji's message says the three godesses Durga, Lakshmi
and Saraswati are to be prayed in that order during Navaratri, the
mail yesterday from Shri Narayanaswami Pallasena (Sub: devi NAVARATHRI
Keerthanams of Svati Tirunal (fwd)) says the prayers are to be offered
in
the order of Saraswati, Lakshmi and Durga. His article on Navaratri
celebration
in Trivandrum and the work of Swati Tirunaal is also beautiful. Going
back
in my memory if i remember right, we used to perform Saraswati puja (as
a kid
for all out books and notes :-), on the 7th day of Navaratri (and read
them on
Vijaydashami), which seems to match what Smt Lathaji has to say.

I don't wish to raise any controversy but am just curious to get the
right
information, I would appreciate if somebody could kindly sort it out. I
once
again thank you all for making this list such a wonderful place, I thank
my
stars for having been lucky to find it in the jungle of Web :-)
Best regards,
Surjit
