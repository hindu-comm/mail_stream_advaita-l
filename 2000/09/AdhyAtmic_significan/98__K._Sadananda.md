>>shamI  shamIyatE  pApam  shami  shatru  nivAranam
>>arjunasya  dhanurdhArI   rAmasya  priya  darshanam.

I learned, when I was child, as vinAshanam than nivAranam -both fit in the
anushhTup.  The first one implies complete destruction the second one
implies avoidance.  Depends on the nature of the shatru - I guess.

When we prostrate elders chanting the sloka they used to give us some money
along with the blessings.  I think at that age we are more keen on the
money than the blessing that prompted us to prostrate but we were blessed
(with the money) anyway!
Hari Om!
