Namaste and happy navarAtri to all,

We chant this mantra with 2 more lines while doing namaskaara to elders and
offering the shamI leaves

>shamI  shamIyatE  pApam  shami  shatru  nivAranam
>arjunasya  dhanurdhArI   rAmasya  priya  darshanam.
shamI kamala patrAxi shamI kanTaka dhaariNi
aarohantu shiko laxmi aayuH prANAbhi raxatu

We had a beautiful start to navarAtri yesterday with 10 ladies reciting
Lalitha sahasranAma, Lalitha trishati and ashtothara.

Om shaanti shaanti shaantiH

Let peace be with one and all this navarAtri season
Savithri
