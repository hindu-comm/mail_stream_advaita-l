I seek refuge in thee, goddess Durga ! Save me well and quickly, salutations
to thee.

Lets contemplate on shAradA on the eve of her navarAtri with this hymn.

.. shrI  kamalajadayitAShTakam ..
(Some attribute it to swami vidhyAraNya. )


shruN^gaxmAbhR^innivAse shukamukhamunibhiH sevyamAnAN^ghripadme
svAN^gacchhAyA vidhUtAmR^itakarasurarADvAhane vAksavitrI .
shambhushrInAthamukhyAmaravaranikaraiH modataH pUjyamAne
vidyA.m shuddhA.mcha bhuddhi.m kamalajadayite satvara.m dehimahyam .. (1)

The first verse serves as a dhyAna shloka and enables one to contemplate on
the divine form of shAradA.

he! kamalaja-dayite!

shAradA is addressed as kamalaja dayite or the consort of the lotus born.
Brahma is said to have manifested from the lotus born out of the navel of
viShNu. She is the shakti or the power of the creator shR^iShTikartrI
brahmarUpA and hence the consort of Brahma.

shruN^gaxmAbhR^in-nivAse shuka-mukha munibhiH sevyamAna aN^ghri padme !

You reside in shringeri, Your lotus feet are worshipped by shukha and other
sages.

Those who are ever engaged in manana to obtain brahmasAxAtkAra are known as
munibhiH. shuka is the foremost of such brahma GYAnI-s. He being the son of
vedavyAsa was like sanakAdi muni who meditated on devi as there own self.

atha yo.anya.m devatAmupAste.anyo.asAvanyohamasmIti na sa veda yathA pashuH
.  (bh.a  1.4.10)
Those who worship without the knowledge that the devatA is his own self is
indeed ignorant (pashuH).

Lots of veda mantras proclaim that the divine mother is non other than the
self tvam vA aham asmi bhagavo devate aham vai tvam asi.

Similar to daxiNAmUrti, when devi assumed a form to bestow the knowledge of
the self she was surrounded by a host of brahma GYAnI-s like shuka muni who
were ever engaged on contemplation of her lotus feet.


svAN^ga-cchhAyA vidhUta amR^ita kara surarAT vAhane !

The sparkling effulgence of your body dispels the shine of the moon and the
vehicle of Indra.

shAradA being vidhyA devi is always meditated upon as davaLa gAtri yaa
kundendu tushhaarahaara dhavalaa, bhaasaa kundendu
sha.nkhasphaTikamaNinibhA bhAasamAnA.asamAnA.

Her bright white effulges exceeds the shine of the nectar filled moon
amR^itakaraH. The gait of her brightness defeats the celestial white
elephant airAvadam. Her deha kAnti emits both saulabhya and gAmbIrya.

shambhu shrInAtha mukhya amara vara nikaraiH modataH pUjyamAne !

You are being delightfully worshipped by shambu (parameshvara), shrInAtha
(viShNu) and other important devaa-s.

She being mahArAGYI, the ruler of this entire universe is worshipped by
shiva, viShNu and other devataa-s who are untiringly engaged in executing
her will.

Her worship is delightful not only for us but even for devaa-s hence the
phrase modataH pUjyamAne.


vAksavitrI ! vidyA.m shuddhA.m bhuddhi.m satvara.m cha mahyam dehi

vAksavitrI (one who confers speech) bless me with knowledge (vidhyA.m) and
flaw less intellect (shuddha bhuddhi.m cha) with out delay. This prayer is
repeated in all shlokas.

he! kamalaja-dayite! You reside in shringeri, Your lotus feet are
worshipped by shukha and other sages, the sparkling effulgence of your body
dispels the shine of the moon and the vehicle of Indra, You are being
delightfully worshipped by shambu, shrInAtha and other important devaa-s,
he! VaksavitrI ! bless me with knowledge and flaw less intellect with out
delay.

. jaya tungA taThastite ! jaya shruN^gAra devate !.
