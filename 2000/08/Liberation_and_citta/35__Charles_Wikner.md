The previous verse (4.69) is even more interesting:

      utpannAtma-prabodhasya tv adveSTRtvAdayo guNAH
      ayatnato bhavanty asya na tu sAdhana-rUpiNaH

      In the case of one who has achieved enlightenment,
      virtues like non-enmity persist naturally and without
      effort.  They are no longer practised as a means to
      any end.  [tr. A.J.Alston]

What the aspirant is practising is in fact the natural behaviour
of the realised man!  Thus Shankara's commentary refers to the
outward behaviour with jnAna not yet steady: now the behaviour
is practised; now it is natural.

The "non-difference" between the practice and the natural behaviour
appeals to me.  Moreover, it gives an insight into the underlying
qualities and a rational basis for the sAdhana-s and derived
practices, such as the tapas given in BG 17:14-19.

Agreed.  It is the harshness and implicit duality of controlling the
mind that bothers me; I guess such language is appropriate to empirical
life, but nonetheless find "control" (detachment and stillness) gentler
and easier when the mind is viewed in a more advaitic light, such as
in PD 13:20 (quoting Yoga VasiSTha):

      sa AtmA sarva-go rAma nityodita-mahA-vapuH
      yan manA"n mananIM shaktiM dhatte tan mana ucyate

      O Rama, the Self is all-pervasive, eternal and infinite;
      when it assumes the power of cognition, we call it the mind.
      [tr. H.P.Shastri]

Or again, a favourite passage from avadhUta gItA 9 that puts the mind
into perspective (and always raises a smile):

      mano vai gaganAkAraM mano vai sarvatomukham
      mano'tItaM manaH sarva na manaH paramArthataH

      The mind is indeed of the form of space.  The mind is indeed
      omnifaced.  The mind is the past.  The mind is all.  But in
      reality there is no mind.  [tr. Ashokananda]

Approach, and way of life too: in fact, a life of integrity - lit. asparsha.
