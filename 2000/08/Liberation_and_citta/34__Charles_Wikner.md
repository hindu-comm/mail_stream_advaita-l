That's super!  Thanks very much!

The original passage (AtmetyopAsIta, BU 1.4.7) on which the commentary
is based, seems synonomous with svasvarUpAsusandhAnaM bhakti (VC 32).
Sri Candrasekhara Bharati's comment on the latter is pertinent:

   By svasvarUpasandhAna contemplation on one's essential nature,
   nididhyAsana (profound repeated meditation) is meant.  That
   alone can serve as the immediate means to direct realisation.
   The continuous contemplation of the shruti text and the upadesha
   of the guru: sa AtmA tattvamasi (That is the atman; That thou art):
   "Thy essential nature is Brahman; thou art That only", is the
   indispensible means (asAdhAraNa kAraNa) of such realisation.  This
   contemplation (anusandhAna) is of the form of the exclusion of
   contrary ideas and is marked by a continuous flow of accordant ideas.
   ... Shama etc., are the cause of jnAna mediated by vicAra and
   nididhyAsana.  But nididhyAsana is the immediate cause for it.
   Because it produces direct realisation, it is said to be the
   greatest among the sAdhanas that make for jnAna which is
   revelatory of one's true nature which is synomymous with mokSa.
   Among the means for nididhyAsana, bhakti is the greatest, because
   it is direct and internal means.  [tr. P.Sankaranarayanan]

The sense I have is that tyAga-vairAgya-Adi creates the mental
environment as it were, in which jnAna can arise, and after
realisation that environment should be maintained lest karma
overwhelm Self-memory.

That accords with the description of the sthitaprajna given in BG 2:55.
Everything fits in neatly, as Vidya pointed out.

Thus discipline is not merely a process (leading to a result as it does),
but a way of life.

I got it.  Thanks so much!
