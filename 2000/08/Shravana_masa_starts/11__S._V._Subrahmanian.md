As I said in the mail titled "Rig Vedis (vs) Yajur Vedis", the month name is
derived from naxatra where it is full moon (pUrNima).  But, SravaNa as a
naxatra is also good for vidya Arambham (starting of education).  It is good
for beginning Vedic studies.

It is interesting to note that the month is supposed to be for auspicious
festivals for Shiva, but SravaNa naxatra is ruled by viSNu!

Sivaya viSNUrUpaya, SivarUpaya viSNave
Sivasya hrudyam viSNuhu, viSNuscha hrudayam Sivaha
yatha Sivamayorevam viSNumayah Sivaha
yathAntaram na pashyami tathame svastirAyuSi
