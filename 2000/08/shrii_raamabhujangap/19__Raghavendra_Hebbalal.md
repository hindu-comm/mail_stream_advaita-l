kR^itaanta.m : Lord Yama.


O shrii raamachandra, those beings who constantly
remember Your Holy and wonderful deeds, obtain You,
who are the destroyer of the samsaara-miseries and the

Support of the Universe. As a result, during their
final moments, they do not have the fearsome
sight of Yama and his attendants.

When one is devoted to the Divine Pastimes of the
Lord,
where will he/she have the time to think of such
trifles as Death ? The Lord takes care of His devotees
always. As He has promised all His devotees in the
giitaa (9:22) :
'ananyAshchintayanto mAM ye janAH paryupAsate |
 teshhAM nityAbhiyuktAnAM yogakshemaM vahAmyaham.h ||'


Corrections are welcome. I hope to finish this series
very soon.

Regards,
Raghavendra.
