O Lord raama, who stand as the bravest one, You have
defeated all Your enemies with ferocious valor.
How can your tremendous might be described ?
Because, You have broken the bow of Lord shiva in
Your childhood itself !

The bow of Lord shiva was worshipped by King Janaka, father
of siitaa maataa. During the svayamvara of siitaa-maataa, when
all others struggled to even lift that bow, Lord raama, while
attempting to string the bow, broke it.

Corrections are welcome.

Raghavendra.
