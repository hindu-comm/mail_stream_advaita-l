A summary of the meaning (translated from Tamil):

I offer my saluations to You who are the beloved Wife of ShrI NarayaNA,
the Father of Manmata (Cupid).
Golden coloured, You have the lustre of a crore suns.
You are easily accessible to your devotees.
Charumati and others do puja to you on the Friday before the full moon
day in the month of shraavaNa (the month of AvaNi, in the Tamil
calendar).
You wear the necklace of nine gems that was given to you by the devAs
and Guruguhan (Lord MurugA?).
You bless the poor devotees with wealth in order to protect them.
You have a mind that is one with you Husband.
Sarasvati, the Goddess of knowledge praises you.
You bless us with immortality and You give us what we wish for.
You protect Your devotees.
Wearing a garland of lotus flowers, You are the embodiment of goodness,
and play in the heart of Keshava.
