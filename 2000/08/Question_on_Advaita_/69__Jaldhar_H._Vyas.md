Sorry for the long delay in responding, but you have raised important
points and I wanted to show you the respect of a well-researched answer.

Perhaps but who gets to decide?  The "pre-cancerous" culture no longer
exists (if it ever did.)  Like it or not we are both children of the
cancer.

The Keralan Christians seem to believe it but ok.  There is however
historical archaological evidence of trade with Arabia and the West dating
to the Roman Empire.  And the settlement of Jews and Syrian Christians is
quite old even if not as old as the time of Jesus.

What I am trying to say is that he had ample opportunity to observe women
at varying levels of public religious involvement.  Enough to not
automatically assume that his cultural mores were the only possible
ones.  The fact that he assumed that Vedic mores were the only permissible
ones anyway is because he regarded them in a positive and superior way.

That is not the sole criteria for judging the matter.

The key word in your quote is iva.  The concept of a simile hardly needs
further explanation I think.

Granted.  But it makes no practical difference in the matter at hand.

I should revise my statement.  The mantras are relevant but only insofar
as they relate to an injunction or prohibition.

Why would anyone male or female study the Vedas in the first place?  (I
mean as a religious act.  Historians etc. no doubt have their own reasons.)
Veda is for the fullfillment of purushartha.  In the case of the
Karmakanda the purushartha is Dharma.  In the case of the Jnanakanda it is
Moksha.  As Vedic study itself belongs to the karmakanda let us look at
Dharma.  The Arthasamgrah says vedapratipadyaH prayojanavadartho dharma .
Dharma is that which is based on the Vedas (and by extension Smrti and
Shistachara), has a purpose, and yields an (auspicious) result.  Are the
rites practiced by women today based on the shastras?  Yes.  Do they have
purpose?  Yes.  Do they produce an auspicious result?  Yes.  So they are
already are practicing Dharma as well as anyone.  If that is so then they
have no reason to take up some other work because it would have no
purpose and thus produce no benefit.

For the purpose of Dharma ones wishes are completely irrelevant.  (except
for the kamya rites of which Vedic study is not one.)  From the
sociological point of view as well it is a very bad idea.  After in
America we may hear "We should worship Jesus if we want.  It would make
our lives a lot easier and after all there is nothing in the Vedas which
says we *can't* worship Jesus."  How long do you think Hindusim would last
with those sentiments.  If the Vedas survive to this day, it is because of
the dedication and fervor of those who believed its' study was an
obligation.  Wherever we see religions adopt an "anything goes" attitude
we see them sink rapidly into aimless hedonism.  The so-called "Hindu
Renaissance" is only what two centuries old now?  Yet how many of its
sects are moribund or have disapeared altogether?

The Advaitin is in a tough spot here because he wants to affirm the
validity of the Veda in general but *not* for the purpose of Moksha.  He
gets around it by saying that the knowledge of the Vedas is not the cause
of Brahmavidya but the remover of obstacles that prevent the rise of that
knowledge.  That satisfies bothe the views expressed in the quoted
passages.

Mimamsa sutra 1.1.2 is chodanAlakShaNo'rtho dharmah.  the distinguishing
feature of Dharma is command.  I do not have the Shabarabhasya but I
suspect it is describing implied injunctions not suggesting Dharma can be
based on non-injunctive sentances.

They mention a slightly different topic, the competency to know Brahman
but the issues are similar and Jaimini Maharshi is even one of the
authorities cited (though ultimately rejected.)

As I mentioned previously it is not a blanket right but covers certain
specific action only.

The Paraskara Grhyasutra.  I've not yet been able to track down the
Katyayana.

Then perhaps it is ok to reach into your step-mothers womb and slay your
unborn half-brother? (As Indra did to Diti.)  Not everything the Gods do
is to be copied.  They too are ruled by Dharma.

I'm saying they have no adhikara to do so.  I'm also that fact does not do
them any injustice.

Because no provision has been made for them to have this second
birth.  Why?  I don't know but there you have it.  And despite this the
Shudras have also been able achieve purusharthas.  So I don't see a
problem.

5% is not an anomaly but it is hardly a ringing endorsement of equality
either.

By historical, I meant do you have examples of female Vaidikas from the
19th century?  The 17th century?  The 13th?  The 7th?  How about the 2nd
century BC or the 5th?  Where is the tradition?  There seems to be a
notion among some Indians (I'm not saying you share it) that there was a
long ago Vedic golden age, then a black hole, then all of a sudden in 1800
history starts again.  I don't buy it.  I'm interested in the living
traditions.

Yes but this is because it is more intimately connected to the sacrificial
act not because it is chronologically older.

Ok.

Well of course! Isn't it a particular mindset we are discussing here?  The
whole issue of learning Vedas only comes up if you belong to particular
mindsets.

There may be bizarre methods of cooking where this is a concern but this
sounds more like an after the fact rationalization to me.

If they do not follow Dharma then they are by definition not
Dharmic!  It depends on the definitio of "Dharmic wife."  The only way to
break out of this vicious circle is to look at the historical
practice.  We see that all over India "Dharmic wives" have followed this
custom.  So if all of a sudden they are not there must be some other
factor than the desire to be Dharmic at work.

I would say it is prudish Western notions that are responsible for women
feeling embarrassed about such a natural thing.

In the Katyayana Shrautasutra of the Shuklayajuraveda that view is
mentioned but as a purvapaksha.  Are you sure it is not the same in the
Manava too?  Even so may I point out you have not shown equality.  In fact
the Shudra yajamana is explicitly singled out for special treatment.

Hmmm this further evidence that there was a difference of opinion a long
time ago and the restrictive party eventually prevailed.

Yes but it is too vague.  Other injunctions are needed to narrow things

It does have purpose.  To say that this is something that is not to be
done.  The purpose of Mimamsa (both purva and uttara) is to harmonize
divergent opinions.  Occasionally some had to be rejected outright other
times they were given as options.  That passage does not provide an
option.

See Shatapatha BrahmaNa 11.5.4.  It explicitly gives instructions for the
traivarnikas.

> Again, do you accept that one's varna is determined by one's birth?

Yes. Because that has been the accepted interpretation for all of our
recorded history.

But ask yourself why he felt the need to make what you call a "euphemistic
gloss"?  Because by that time the idea of caste being based on anything
other than birth was unthinkable.

It conforms with Dharma which is more expansive than just Shruti.
