Can you explain more on the name sthapati. I understand pati means
lord.  What does stha mean here? One the meanings of stha is possibly
unchangeable and shiva is called as sthaaNu. There is a temple in
suchiindram (near kanyaakumari) has a deity which is a combination of
shiva, vishnu and brahma. The name is sthaaNumaalayan (sthaaNu shiva,
maal - vishhNu, ayan = brahma).

TIA

Ravi
