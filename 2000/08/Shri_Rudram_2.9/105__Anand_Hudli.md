     || AUM namo bhagavate rudrAya ||

    atha namaka-dvitIyaanuvAke navamaM yajurAha
    -----------------------------------------------

   namo rohitAya sthapataye vR^ixANAM pataye namaH || 9 ||

  Salutations to the red complexioned One (rohitAya), to the Lord,
  (sthapataye) and salutations to the protector of trees
  (vR^ixANAM pataye).

  sAyaNAchArya's commentary:
  --------------------------
  rohito lohitavarNaH sthapatiH prabhustasmai rudrAya namo. astu|
  vR^ixANAM pAlakastasmai rudrAya namo .astu|

  (Salutations) to the red complexioned One. May salutations be to that
  Rudra, the lord . May salutations be to Rudra, the protector of trees.

 Note:

 BhaTTa-bhAskara notes that according to some, the "ro" of rohita means
 a speaker, and so rohita indicates Rudra who is beneficial to such
 speakers and messengers or He who is in such speakers, "kashchidAha
 roshabdo vAchakarUpastasmai hitAya tatra vA nihitAya."
