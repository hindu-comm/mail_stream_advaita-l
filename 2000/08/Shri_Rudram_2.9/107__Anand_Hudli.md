 BhaTTa-bhAskara mentions that sthapati can mean an architect, or
 a confectioner, one who sells sweets. He also analyzes the word
 sthapati as "sthAtA cha sarvatra pAtA cha sarvasya", meaning one
 who is everywhere and protects everyone.

 sthANu means fixed or motionless and is also one of the names of
 shiva (actually occurs in the shiva-aShTottara).
