Hari Om,

Yes, I also read the same explanation as given by Sri Vaidya Sundaram in some
book. The angavastra which men wear over their left shoulder is also called
" uttariiya ". Hence while wearing the third yagnOpavIta the person should do
aachamana and say " uttarIyArthE " and wear the third thread.

Now that Upaakarma festival is round the corner this aspect should be clarified
by a knowlegable person.
