 Shrimacchankaracharyo Vijayatetaram

Dear Sir,

Harih Om,

Let me introduce myself first. I'm a write and I write translations in
Hindi of old Sanskrit texts. In the last days I have been translating
Hastamalakiyam with Bhagavan Shankara's Bhashyam on it. As my work is
nearly complete, I was looking for some information about the Stotra.
While I was doing this on the net, I came across your excellent
web-site. Could you give me some relative information. Or at least tell
me a title of a book along with its address, in which I can find a
detailed study on this subject.

Thank you very much,

Siddhartha Krishna
