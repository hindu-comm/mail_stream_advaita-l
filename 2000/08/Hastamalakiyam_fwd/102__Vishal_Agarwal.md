For text, translation and a short study, please refer to the following:

The Hastamalaka; by E. B. Cowell; The Journal of Philology; Cambridge; 1876
(yes! The study is 124 years old!); pg. 161-169

Maybe there are modern studies as well as but I am not aware of them myself.

Dear Sir,

Harih Om,

Let me introduce myself first. I'm a write and I write translations in
Hindi of old Sanskrit texts. In the last days I have been translating
Hastamalakiyam with Bhagavan Shankara's Bhashyam on it. As my work is
nearly complete, I was looking for some information about the Stotra.
While I was doing this on the net, I came across your excellent
web-site. Could you give me some relative information. Or at least tell
me a title of a book along with its address, in which I can find a
detailed study on this subject.

Thank you very much,

Siddhartha Krishna
