>From late Wednesday afternoon to approximately this afternoon the
list and web site were down because a passing truck accidently cut the
telephone cables on our street leaving us without any service and it took
this long to navigate through the phone company bureaucracy to fix
it.  (Those Indian readers who think America is a model of super efficency
and this kind of thing only happens over there think again! :-)

It looks like no mail was actually lost so if you sent something please
wait and it should show up.  If it doesn't by Monday, please resend.

I apologize for any inconvenience.
