That's an interesting question.  There are some numbers that are
considered 'lucky' in our culture, 18 (parvanas of the Mahabharata,
Mahapuranas, vidyas), 108, 1008.  Why?  They all end in 8.  They all start
with 1.  Could 8 represent the 8 directions (i.e. the physical world) and
1 the one Brahman that pervades it?  That's pure guesswork on my part.

No you have to do 1008 which is 9 and a 1/3 malas.
