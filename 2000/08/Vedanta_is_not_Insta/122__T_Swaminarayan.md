By this do you not see that one will end up in
chaos?You can yourself be a srotriya by going through
the printed medium!The guru you are suggesting is then
no better than yourself who have gained knowledge from
reading the scriptures.In my opinion, reading the
various bhyashas of ACCLAIMED ACHARYAS is better thAn
settling for a Sotriya suggested by you.

No one seems to be able to vouch that among the
swamijis we come across in todays ashramas this one or
that one is a Brahmanishti! NO OFFENCE MEANT TO ANY
GREAT SOUL BY THIS STATEMENT.

I tend to agree with you. I could go one step further
by just clarifying that by VyaakaraNa you have
included the Language of Sanskrit as a whole.

Most certainly, you are right atleast about our
present janma's activities! That itself is sufficient
for us to get deeper into the studies of Vedanta.(To
most of us, our poorva janma activities are that much
hearsay only) While doing so, we should not forget our
Vyavaharika duties to our fellow travellers,
especially,our immediate family members like our
poojaniya parents.If you decide to take Diksha, it is
a different matter.

Your further similar considered thoughts are
welcome,which are,most certainly,to be ruminated upon
by all of us.

Warm regards. Hari Om!
