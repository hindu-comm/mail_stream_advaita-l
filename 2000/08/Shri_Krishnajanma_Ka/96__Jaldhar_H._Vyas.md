This Janmashtami I had the opportunity to listen to a very eloquent
speaker narrating the story of the birth of Shri Krishna and this prompted
me to read the original account in the Bhagavata Purana.

Background
==========

The descendents of King Yadu were known as the Yadavas.  One branch of this
distinguished family ruled the land called Saurasena (after one of the
kings of that line) whose capital was the city of Mathura (in modern
U.P.)  Other kings of this line were called Vrshni and Madhu.  Hence
Krishna Bhagawan is caled Yadunandana, Varshneya, Madhava etc.

Another branch ruled Vidarbha.  At one time Shura was the king of Vidarbha
and he had 10 sos the oldest of whom was called Vasudeva.  The king of
Mathura was called Ugrasena.  He had a daughter named Devaki who he wished
to marry to the noble Vasudeva.  Ugrasena also had a son called Kamsa who
was the exact opposite of Vasudeva.  Actually he was the incarnation of an
Asura called Kalanemi who had been slain by Vishnu Bhagawan.  He
remembered this in his present life and attacked Dharma and and dharmic
people with insane hatred.  Nevertheless at the wedding of his sister he
saw her off to her husbands home with lavish presents and ceremony.  Then
suddenly, a voice came from the heavens.  "You fool, the Eighth child of
the one you're leading into the chariot shall be your death!"  Seized with
terror, he dragged his sister down from the chariot and began to beat her
mercilessly while his men overpowered Vasudeva, Ugrasena, and the other
guests.

Vasudevas Advice
================

The Bhagavata Purana is well known as the authoritative source on
Bhakti.  But it also teaches Jnana too.  Vasudevas speach s oe of the gems
of Jnana you find spread throughout the Bhagavata.

Vasudeva said to Kamsa, "Shame on you the descendent of illustrious kings
like Bhoja for this shameful treatment of a woman.  Death is the natural
fate of those who are born.  Whether now or in 100 years time, it is
inescapable.  It is the material body that dies.  Then the Jiva hitherto
trapped by karma is set free and takes up another body.  Just as a walker
puts one foot on the ground and lifts the other into the air, then puts it
down and lifts the other one, or the grasshopper leaves one blade of grass
after finding another one, the jiva leaves one body and finds another
according to its accumulated karma.  In a dream, the Jiva forgets that "I
am so-and-so with such-and-such qualities." and takes up whatever shape it
desires. On waking up again, the dream-body is forgotten.  At the time of
death the fate of the Jiva is determined and thus Maya molds the five
elements into the Gods, men, beasts, birds etc. and the Jiva flits from
one of them to another.  Just as in a dish filled with water one can see
[the reflection of] the moon or the sun etc. even though the water is the
same, through avidya, the jiva falls under the illusion, "I am this
particular body."  Thus a wise man will never wish to injure any living
thing, For in truth he will only be injuring his own self.  This Devaki is
your own little sister.  She has only just reached childbrearing age.  So
have pity and stop beating this blameless woman."
