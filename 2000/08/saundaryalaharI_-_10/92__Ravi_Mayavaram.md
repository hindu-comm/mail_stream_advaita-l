O bhagavatI,

caraNayugaLa:  (Your) pair of feet
antaH:  from within
vigaLitaiH:  flowing
sudhAdhAra + AsAraiH:  streaming shower of nectar
prapa~ncaM:  the body (made up of seventy two thousand nADI-s)
si~ncantI:  drenching
rasa + AmnAya + mahasaH:  from the exuberance of nectarine radiance
        of the Moon (from the sahasrAra where You united with shiva)
svAM:  Your
bhUmiM:  mUlAdhAra with bhU tattva
punaH api:  once again
avApya:  having reached
bhujaganibhaM:  like a serpent
adhyuShTavalayaM:  coiled (three and a half coils)
svam + AtmAnaM:  Your self
kR^itvA:  having made
kuhariNi:  the hollow in the narrow tube in the central part of
           the lotus
kuLakuNDe:  in the mUlAdhAra cakra
svapiShi:  sleep


O bhagavatI, You drench the seventy-two thousand nADI-s in the
sAdhakA's body with the nectar flowing from Your feet. Now, reaching
Your own ground (mUlAdhAra) having returned from the sahasrAra of the
nectarine radiance of the Moon, you settle in the hollow of Your own
sphere in the mUlAdhAra  in the form of a serpent with three and a
half coils, and sleep there.


commentary:

In verse 9, the ascent of the kunDalinI from the mUlAdhAra to the
sahasrAra was described. In this verse, shri shankara describes the
descent from the sahasrAra to the mUlAdhAra. This verse and verse 9
are said to depict the meditation on the most subtle form of shrIdevI
consistent with that given in catushshatI.

anubhUya paraM gatvA pItvA kulaparAmR^itam.h
akulAtkulakaM bhUyaH kulAdakulaM mahaH
evaM mAM sundarIM dhyAyet sUkshmadhyAnaM prakIrtitam.h


sudhAdhArA + AsAraiH:  AsAra implies flow. dhArAsAra is not a
punarukti, repeat mention of the same point. dhArAsAra need to
be interpreted as a drenching flow.

caraNayugaLAntarvigaLitaiH:  from the space between Your feet. The
nectar that flows from there is the water that has washed shrIdevI's
feet and this is the water that fills the entire body of the sAdhaka.
Verse 4 already stated the capability of shrIdevI's feet in granting
moksha to the sAdhaka.

prapa~ncaM ci~ncantI:  the body with seventy-two thousand nADI-s is
drenched (with the nectar flowing from Your feet).

rasAmnAya mahasaH:  sahasrAra is described in this verse by this
expression, which means the nectarine radiance of the Moon. In the
yoga shAstra, the head is called the sphere of the Moon. SahasrAra
is in that sphere and within this is shrIcakra. The centre of
shrIcakra , the bindusthAna is the place of union of shiva and shakti.

svAM bhUmiM:  Your own position, the mUlAdhAra with bhU tattva

adhyuShTAnavalayaM:  three and a half coils

kuLakuNDe kuhariNi:  in the hollow of the kulakuNDa - the knotlike
form of the mUlAdhAra, where there is a hollow

>From the sahasrAra the kunDalinI again descends to the mUlAdhAra. Why?
This would be the case if she is still in identification with all the
past impressions born of the karmas of the jIva. Only in the case of
those whose minds have been erased of all impressions, the kunDalinI
does remain in the sahasrAra in complete absorption of shiva. In that
case samAdhi remains spontaneous and continuous.
