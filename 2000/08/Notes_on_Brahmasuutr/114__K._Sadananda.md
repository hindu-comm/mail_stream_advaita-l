Thanks Anand for the hearty welcome and the support.

If there are any errors in my notes please feel free to point them out.

The more I contemplate on the advaitic teaching the more admire its beauty
and its scientific approach in looking at the problem in its totality.

Your advice for all of us are well taken.

Hari Om!
