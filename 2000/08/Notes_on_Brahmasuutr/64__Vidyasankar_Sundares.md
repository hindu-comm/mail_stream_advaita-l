sUtra-bhUta and sUtra-sthAnIya indicate that something else is being
substituted, in lieu of a sUtra. That presumes that there is an expectation
regarding what a sUtra itself is, or should be. The other question is
whether this should be descriptive or prescriptive.

Any generic definition should take into account the general nature of the
sUtra style of composition. One cannot have one definition for the vedAnta
sUtras and another for say the nyAya or vaiSeshika sUtras.

The only one I can remember is madhusUdana sarasvatI praising Sankara and
sureSvara as having explained the meaning of the vedAnta better than the
sUtrakAra himself. Whether anything more than praise is intended in this
statement is not evident. In poetic alankAras, no negative judgement is
intended of the other, when praise is made of one.

Change the "need not" to "should not". I wrote in haste.

Not every philosopher belonging to a given school needs to comment primarily
upon the sUtras of that school, in order to prove his standing.

That is because we also accept that the mImAMsA sUtras are another medium
for interpreting the SAstra, but with respect to the karmakANDa. And we
don't see the pUrva and uttara mImAMsA as forming one particularly unified
system. dharma is codanA-lakshaNa, but brahma is svataH-siddha. Accordingly,
the two systems differ, and the media also differ, with the same SAstra as
pramANa. The multiple perspectives that get reconciled in the Advaita
central position allows to accept more than one medium, but for different
purposes. After all, like a prakaraNa or a bhAshya or a vRtti, a sUtra is
only a text composed by a human being, in accordance with his anubhava and
yukti. Sruti itself has multiple SAkhAs, along with mantra and brAhmaNa
distinctions.
