That would generally be correct: `vishvatomukham.h', ekaprayojanaM
pratyapexitArthasya kR^itsnasya pratipAdakam.h, etc.

However, why is this verse of any interest to Advaitins?  It is from
Madhva's bhAshhya (cited from the Skanda P.) and the passage includes
tenets not acceptable to Advaita, and indeed, one is not aware of any
classical Advaitin from Shankara down to Advaitananda in the 17th cent.
saying that this is the Advaitins' view.
