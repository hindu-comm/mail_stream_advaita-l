Certainly; I am trying to lay out the context as "within an Advaita work,"
only, and trust I haven't misinterpreted anything.

That is all that really is needed.

Very good, but then, a generic definition of what a `sUtra' is must match
all of these contexts (with each of them being a special case), and I
haven't seen one in an Advaita work; the `alpAxaramasandigdhaM' one seems
inappropriate.

Correct, but tradition has generally had few if any qualms living with
such apparent paradoxes; many others such could be found.

As referring to the `shArIraka', i.e., Badarayana, sUtra-s only, a
position I believe is shared by Ramanuja also.

It's not so much a question of reconciliation, as of finding a _generic_
definition for sUtra as used in shaastra contexts.

Which is my point precisely; that is exactly why the qualities from the
Puranic verse are not claimed for the Badarayana sUtra-s.

Actually, there are a few instances where Shankara's commentators (who
presumably did not reject his interpretations!) have "seen faults" in the
sUtra-s; I'm not making that up.  It will take me a little while to come
up with the right references, but I can if you're interested.

Certainly; Gaudapada did not.

That's the difference; *a* medium, rather than *the* medium.
