I didn't know the exact source of the verse,

VA: In various other works, I have seen 'Parashara Upapurana' also cited as
the source of this verse. I have not read the Padma/Skanda/Parashara Puranas
but one text where I have seen this verse POSITIVELY is the Brahmanda
Purana. I forget the address but the verse occurs at the end of the chapters
dealing with the Vedic Shakhas, characteristics of Brahmanas and Mantras
etc. Maybe you could pick up the MLBD translation (in 4 volumes) and locate
the same by looking at the index (look for the description of Vedic shakhas
etc.)
