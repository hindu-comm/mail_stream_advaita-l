All that Sankara says here is that the reference is to statements
in the Upanishads, about the nature of Brahman. He does not qualify
this in any further manner. And this is because the reference is to
the jnAna of both the kshetra and the kshetrajna. The idea that the
Advaitin considers only some things authoritative and other things
unauthoritative within the Upanishads is false. We consider them to
be all authoritative, but in different contexts and at different
times. For example, the injunction to marry and sacrifice cannot
be simultaneously applicable along with an injunction to renounce
and become a sannyAsin. The two are addressed either to different
persons or to the same person at different stages in life.

Note also that elsewhere in the gItAbhAshya, Sankara refers to quoted
verses as sUtra-sthAnIya, i.e. an entire verse can be considered
a sUtra, in certain contexts.

Well, such a position would have to presume that the sUtras of
Badarayana were written before the gItA. On the other hand, most
of the references in the sUtras to smRti are to the gItA. How does
AnandatIrtha interpret the word sUtra in the above verse?

Nothing that can't be reconciled easily.

The advaita tradition does not put too fine a point on the issue
of non-repetition. We don't consider it a "dosha", but find some
explanation that satisfies why a punarukti is sometimes necessary.
And that the sUtras do not satisfy these characteristics under
Sankara's interpretation is only held by those who reject Sankara's
interpretation. Those of us who do accept it do not see any such
faults in the sUtras themselves.

And the justification for this is also found within the bhAshya itself.
One needs to highlight the SAstra-yonitva and the textual samanvaya,
before moving to Ikshater nASabdaM, because the reference to IkshaNa
is from the SAstra, and samanvaya from at least two different SAstra
texts is presumed here.

Without getting into a big discussion about this, not so, under the

Well, we don't look at either Sruti or sUtra as a legal contract that
is a drab and literal document. We allow for poetry and figures of
speech. As for conflict between sUtra and Sruti, it is simply a general
acknowledgement that the sUtra is not an apaurusheya text. If there
were a conflict, hypothetically speaking, the Sruti would be balIyasI.
I am unaware of any specific instance where Vacaspati or Anandagiri
has pointed out that sUtra does conflict with Sruti.

You seem to be suggesting that an Advaitin need not even have commented
upon the brahmasUtras at all. How so? The Advaitin does accept the
sUtras as a medium of interpretation of SAstra-pramANa. If not, Sankara
could have simply commented upon the Upanishads and gItA, and ignored
the sUtras totally. As you can see, that is hardly the case.

Best wishes,
Vidyasankar
