I checked a printed version of that Purana (Krishnadas Sanskrit Series
#41, Varanasi, printed by Chowkhamba Press), but `alpAxaramasandigdham.h'
isn't in it, which is not surprising.  The editions of the Puranas vary
widely (and sometimes wildly! -- think `ravivAre cha Sunday cha' and the
Gita Press), and nowadays most of them are started with the `nArAyaNaM
namaskR^itya naraM chaiva narottamam.h' verse, which does not occur in any
pre-15th cent. Puranic manuscript.  (It also is the *second* verse of the
Mahabharata, not the first, on the evidence of the Kerala manuscripts of
the Mahabharata.)
