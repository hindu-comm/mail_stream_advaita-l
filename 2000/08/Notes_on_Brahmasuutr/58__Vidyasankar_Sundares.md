The quoted verse seems generic enough, regarding the principles behind the
composition of a sUtra. I have not seen any Advaita author defining a sUtra
in a wholly different manner. I didn't know the exact source of the verse,
and it seems like Sadananda didn't either; thanks for pointing it out.
Given its origin in a purANa, I don't see why the Advaitin should
particularly reject this description. What are the other things in the
source passage that would be unacceptable to Advaita?
