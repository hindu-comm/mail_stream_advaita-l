Messers Sadanand and Anand Hudli,

Since I find your posts on the Brahmasutra and Sri Rudram very good, may I
have your permission to archive/copy them on the GHEN forum for the benefit
of members there? In fact, I should have sought your permission earlier
since I have already posted some messages there (with due acknowledgement of
the source of course).

Thanks in advance,

Vishal
