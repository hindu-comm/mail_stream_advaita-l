Dear list members,

I recently came to know of two new websites, and thought I would share the
information with you all.

1. www.shakatapurammutt.com - The website of the Sankara Matha in
Sakatapuram (Bandigade), near Sringeri. This Matha is actually a very old
branch of the Jyotirmatha, located near Badrinath in the Himalayas, and
traces its lineage to Totakacharya, a direct disciple of Sankaracharya. It
has historically been known as the Srividya Peetham. The heads of this Matha
are particularly well known in south India as Srividya Upasakas and Gurus.
The website carries many interesting details.

2. www.ramachandrapuramata.org - Associated with the Havyaka community, who
are spread around the Gokarna area in the west coast of India. Most of the
Havyakas are Samaveda specialists, of the Ranayaniya recension.

If any of you comes to know of the presence of such traditional institutions
on the internet, please let me know the URL-s. I would like to include such
information on the Advaita FAQ page.

Yours,
Vidyasankar
