I think the translation is on the mark.  A salient point to note is the
word bodha -- thinking -- the activity of the buddhi or intellect.

Basically I think your question boils down to this.  If Brahman (in the
form of the Jiva) is enveloped by Maya and has "forgotten" its true
nature, how can it ever free itself?  The Neti Neti process cannot work
because it is an illusionary buddhi that is making an illusionary
distinction between "this" and "not this."

To describe what is happening, an analogy is given to the sun.  You see it
in the sky shining.  Then a cloud covers it and suddenly you can't see it
anymore.  But after the cloud passes the sun is visible again.  During the
entire time it never stopped shining, the shining just wasn't visible.
The sun is like Brahman and the cloud is like Maya.  The analogy is not
perfect because there is no external observer, Brahman "sees" itself but
it is good enough for our purposes.

How does the cloud pass from in front of the the sun?  One possible answer
to this could be that it eventually just does.  In other words
enlightenment is random and there is nothing that can be done to effect
it.  This view is rejected by Advaita Vedanta.  Instead Maya can be forced
to dissipate by revealing its own self-contradictions.  When all possible
subject-object relationships have been destroyed, what remains is pure
subject--Brahman.  How is this done?  Well, that's the tricky part and
that's the aim of Vedanta as a spiritual discipline.  The process of
"neti, neti" means the systematic analysis of every worldly phenomenon.
Once their falsehood has been proven and there is nothing left, Brahman
will shine forth without any further effort.
