namaste to you all,

Yesterday I found an old posting (10 Feb 2000) where Vidyasankar Sundaresan wrote the following regarding the links from the FAQ page: "Currently, I see that the page I had obtained for the Adhyatma Prakasha Karyalaya, Holenarsipur (Swami Saccidanandendra Sarasvati) is no longer available. The old address was www.culturalindia.com/karyalaya.htm. I have
been unable to find whether it is online at some other site. If someone knows more about it, please inform me."
   I guess you have already found the new address. In any case, the new address is: www.indiawebsites.com/karyalaya.htm 

Very best wishes

Stig Lundgren
