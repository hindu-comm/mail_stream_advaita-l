         || AUM namo bhagavate rudrAya ||

    atha namaka-dvitIyaanuvAke ShaShThaM yajurAha
    -----------------------------------------------

   namo bhavasya hetyai jagatAM pataye namaH || 6 ||

   Salutations to the destroyer of ignorance/saMsAra (bhavasya hetyai)
   and salutations to the Lord of the worlds (jagatAM pataye).

  sAyaNAchArya's commentary:
  --------------------------

 bhavaH saMsArastasya hetirAyudham.h | saMsArachchhetre rudrAya
 namo .astu | jagatAM pAlako yo rudrastasmai namo .astu |

 Bhava is saMsAra. Heti is its weapon (ie. weapon with which saMsAra
 is destroyed). May salutations be to Rudra who is the destroyer of (who
 cuts off) saMsAra. May salutations be to that Rudra who rules the worlds.


 Note:

  This Yajus of the Rudra-prashna clearly points out that Rudra is
  the destroyer of saMsAra which is only ignorance. bhaTTa-bhAskara
  notes in his commentary:

  kechidAhuH namo hiraNyabAhava ityAdibhiH paJNchabhirmantraiH paJNcha-
  brahmANi pR^ithagvarNAni pratipAdya tataH ShaShThenAnena saMsArasyo-
  chchhettA paJNchavaktro devaH pratipAdyata iti |


 Some say thus : The five mantras beginning from "namo hiraNyabAhave..."
 describe the five different kinds of Brahman and this sixth mantra
 describes the five-faced God, Shiva (paJNchAnana) who is the destroyer
 of saMsAra.

     || AUM namo bhagavate rudrAya ||
