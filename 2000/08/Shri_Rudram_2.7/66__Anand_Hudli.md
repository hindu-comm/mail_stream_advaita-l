Generally speaking, there can be no "pAThAntara" (alternative reading)
in shruti. There should be exactly one reading. The taittirIya
saMhitA says exactly "AtatAvine", but the vAjasaneyi saMhitA of the
shukla yajurvedins has "AtatAyine" instead. I do not know what the
two other extant Krishna yajurveda saMhitAs belonging to the maitrAyaNIya
and kAThaka shAkhAs say.
