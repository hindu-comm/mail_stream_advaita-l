      || AUM namo bhagavate rudrAya ||


    atha namaka-dvitIyaanuvAke saptamaM yajurAha
    -----------------------------------------------

   namo rudrAyAtatAvine xetrANAM pataye namaH || 7 ||

  Salutations to Rudra (rudrAya), who protects with an extended bow,
  (AtatAvine), and salutations to the protector of xetra's, sacred
  places (xetrANAM pataye).

  sAyaNAchArya's commentary:
  --------------------------
  Atatena vistAritena dhanuShA .avati raxatItyAtatAvI tasmai rudrAya
  namo .astu| xetrANAM pAlako yo rudrastasmai namo .astu ||

  One who protects with a bow that is extended (with its string) is
  "AtatAvI". May salutations be to that Rudra (who is AtatAvI). May
  salutations be to that Rudra who is the protector of xetra's, sacred
  places.

 Note:

 According to BhaTTa-bhAskara, "xetra" can mean the body as defined
 in gItA 13.1, (idaM sharIraM kaunteya xetramityabhidhIyate), or
 "xetra" can mean a place of pilgrimage (puNyaxetra) such as kAshI.
