namaste to you all!

For some months I have been reading the postings on the  advaita list, and
I´m very impressed by all the learned articles and comments  available
here! Some of the list-contributors are familiar to me now -  after all, I
have been taking part of your views and arguments almost  everyday since
early springtime this year - so I almost feel like I know you in  person!
   My name is Stig Lundgren. I´m 34 years old and I  live in Stockholm,
Sweden. I´m a scholar and teacher at the department of the  History of
Ideas, Stockholm university. My main topic as a scholar is 19th  century
idealistic philosophy, and I´m working on a book on the  swedish thinker
Carl Yngve Sahlin (1824-1917).
   However, it is advaita vedanta that occupies my  mind most of the time!
My main interest is the "early" vedanta of Gaudapada,  Sankara and
Suresvara. Among more contemporary vedantins I am  particularly interested
in the brilliant writings of Swami  Satchidanandendra Saraswati
(1880-1975), who also is the founder of Adhyatma  Prakasa Karyalaya in
Holenarsipur.
   I think the Advaita Vedanta Home Page  maintained by Vidyasankar
Sundaresan is great. Since there  are quite a few more or less
"neo-vedantic" sites on the internet, this  traditional vedanta site really
is important for information on the teachings of  Sankara and the dasanami
tradition. Jaya Jaya  Sankara!!

Very best wishes

Stig Lundgren
