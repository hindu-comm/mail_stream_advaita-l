We celebrated Janmashtami tonight.  I've just gotten back from our local
mandir which was jam-packed.  The police had to close of the street there
was so much traffic.

Tomorrow I'll post the the Krishnajanma katha.

namaste.

I am interested in advaita for the past many years. My interest is
in shrI shankara's prakaraNa granthA-s, and in His bhAShyA-s of the
upanishads, brahmasUtrA-s and bhagavadgItA. I hope to be able to
learn from the members' discussions.

Regards
Gummuluru Murthy
