 Actually, rather than whether a tithi is xaya or adhika, what is more
 important in general for observances is the concept of viddha and
 shuddha. A titthi, t, is viddhA if on the day of its occurrence,
 also occurs tithi (t - 1) (modulo 15, of course) partially. It is
 shuddhA if on the day of occurrence, (t - 1) does not so occur.
 The importance of viddhA and shuddhA tithi's arises, for example, in
 the case of determining ekAdashI. The bhAgavata (smArta) ekAdashI
 should NOT be a viddhA  tithi. Actually, it requires that the
 preceding dashamI should have ended at least 1 hour 36 minutes before
 sunrise on the day when ekAdashI is observed.

 Again, in general, when a tithi for an observance is viddhA, we have
 four possibilities because there are two days which become possible
 candidates for the observance, not one as would be the case for a
 shuddhA tithi. 1) The tithi t, required for the observance, prevails
 during the time for the observance (example, midnight) on both days,
 ie the day on which the tithi is viddhA and the next day. 2) the tithi
 prevails during the time for the observance on the first day but not
 the second day, 3) the tithi prevails during the time for the observance
 on the second day but not the first day, and 4) the tithi does not
 prevail during the time for the observance on either day.

 Depending on the particular tradition, the rule for fixing the date
 of the observance is arrived at. For example, the rule for JanmaShTamI
 is: if condition 1) or 4) holds, then the date of observance will be
 the second day, if 2) holds, the first day, or if 3) holds, the
 second day.

 The same approach is also used for naxatra-based observances.

VERSE 5
=======

adyaapi yatpuragataH sakalo.api jantuH
 xuttR^iD.h vyathaa virahita prasuveva baalaH |
saMposhyate karuNayaa bhajakaarti hantriiM
 bhaktyaa.anvahaM taaM hR^idaya bhaja miinanetraam.h || 5||


In a split form:

adya api yat.h pura gataH sakalaH api jantuH
 xuttR^iD.h vyathaa virahita prasuva iva baalaH |
saMposhyate karuNayaa bhajaka aarti hantriiM
 bhaktyaa anvahaM taaM hR^idaya bhaja miina netraam.h || 5||

Like a mother caring for her child, out of boundless compassion who
cares for all beings in HER city (Universe) even today  keeping them
free from the pangs of hunger, and who destroys all the distress of HER
devotees, O mind worship that miinaaxii daily with devotion.
