It also depends on the Sampradaya too.  The problem is the calander we
usually use these days is based on the cycles of both the Sun and the
Moon.  A Solar year is 365.25 days whereas 12 lunar months come up to just
over 354 days.  Therefore sometimes a tithi only lasts for part of a day
in which case it is skipped (kshaya) and sometime it stretches over two
days (vrddha.)  And  occasionally a "leap"(adhika) month has to be added.

In the case of an utsava fallng on a kshaya tithi, Smartas selebrate it on
the tithi before while Vaishnavas celebrate it the day after.  For
example the mandir I go to which follows Vallabha sampradaya celebrated
this last ekadashi on Saturday (Shravana Krishna 12)  while I celebrated
it on Friday (Shravana Krishna 10.) If an utsava falls on a vrddha tithi
Smartas celebrate it on the first day whereas Vaishnavas celebrate on the
second.
