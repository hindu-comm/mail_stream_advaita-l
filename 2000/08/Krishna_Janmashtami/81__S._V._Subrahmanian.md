I was under the impression that for people who are alive naxatra is used
for determining the date of celebration.  But for departed people, tithi is
used.  [Ofcourse one could argue if Krishna really departed...].  For eg.,
Rama Navami is celebrated only on the navami.  I don't know if an
alternative
date exists for Shri Rama also.   By the way how is Shri Shankara's Jayanti
celebrated, naxatra or thithi ?

[I also saw some confusion this year with regards to Hanuman Jayanti too.]
