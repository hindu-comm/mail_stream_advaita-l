Dear Prabhujis of Advita-L,

Sripada Shankaracharya had projected the verse, 'tat tvam asi' as the
Maha-vakya. But "Aum" or "Om" is the Pranava-mantra as well as the Maha-vakya,
as far as the Vedic Scriptures are concerned. This fact is well established in
the Bhagavad Gita also. The verse, 'Om Tat Sat' is a representation of the
Supreme Absolute Truth.

Dear Shri Bhaskar,

Most certainly what you state is very correct,but you have to continue your study and understanding of the scriptures further than what you have so far done.

The Mandukya Upanishad states:

Om Ityetad Aksharam idam sarvam,

Jagaritasthane Vaishvanaro' Akarah' Prathama Matra,

Swapnasthane Taijasa ' Ukaro' Dwiteeya Matra,

Sushuptasthane Prajgyaha 'Makara' Triteeya Matra.

Amatraschaturtho Avyavaharyaha,Prapanchopashamaha,Shivo Advaita Evam OMKARA  ATMAIVA,

Samvishatyatmana atmanam, ya evam veda.

An understanding of the above Scriptural passage will lead us to the understanding of the essence in

'TAT TVAM ASI'  ,    'SARVAM ETAD BRAHMA'  AND  'AYAM ATMA BRAHMA

With warm regards,

Swaminarayan.
