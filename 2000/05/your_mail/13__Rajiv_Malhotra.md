An interesting view is that of Sri Aurobindo. The prakriti-maya in potential
is intrinsic in Brahman. It is not some external veil for there could be
nothing 'other'.

No.  Even in its unmanifest state, matter is maya, a false superimposition
on changeless Brahman.  This is in contrast to Samkhya/Yoga which teaches
a kind of dualism where Prakrti is equal and completely distinct from
Purush (their equivalent of Brahman) which is just an inert observer.
