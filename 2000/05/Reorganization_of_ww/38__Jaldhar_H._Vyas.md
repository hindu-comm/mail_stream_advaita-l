I had hoped to get this done by Shankaracharya Jayanti (Monday) but alas
things are going a little slowly but I have started reorganizing our
website located at http://www.advaita-vedanta.org/

In the coming weeks things will be expanded much further so please do take
a look from time to time.

If you have some project in mind related to the subject let me know.  I'd
be happy to provide worthy projects with web space etc.
