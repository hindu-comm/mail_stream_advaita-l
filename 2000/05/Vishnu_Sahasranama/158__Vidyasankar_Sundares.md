>02.  Whether Jeevatma has any name and form

The deeper question is whether there is any Jeevatman beyond name and form.
Take away name and form, and what remains? Think about that, and then you
can understand Advaita a little.

>03.  Who is responsible for the "First Sin" of human being

Again, what is the "First Sin"? That of being human? The concept of
Original Sin is quite alien to the ways of thinking of Indian philosophies.
It is appropriate only in discussions of Judaic and Christian religions.
Asking who is responsible for such a thing is like knowing that the earth
is a globe and still asking where its edge is located.
