All statements in the shastras have to be balanced with each other.  In
the Mahabharata 1000 names of Vishnu Bhagawan are given.  In practice also
Vaishnavas disagree on what is the mahamantra.  You may prefer
"Harekrishna, Harekrishna" but the Pushti Margis prefer "Shri Krshna
Sharanam mama", others may prefer "Om namo Bhagavate Vasudevaya" etc.

All Dharmas that is all actions whether worldly or religious must be
performed not with the idea "If I will do this I will get a reward" or "If
I don't do this I will be punished" but dispassionately as an offering to
the Lord.

This is bhakti as applied to the karma marga.  Jnana is opposed to karma
but not to bhakti.  On the Jnanamarga, bhakti is faith in the Guru and the
teachings of the Vedas.  There is no negation of Bhakti just its
refinement to a higher form.

Sure we do.  Right between our ears we have all the equipment we need for
atma vichara in one compact, energy-efficient, grey container.  True the
kaliyuga has diminished the power of the intellect but the atma is
self-illuminating, it can always be apprehended.

We shouldn't.  Alone in a dark fearful jungle with dangerous enemies on
all sides we should gratefully accept any help we can get.  But we should
not squander that help, by remaining in that jungle, when through Advaita
Vedanta we can find an exit.
