Namaskarams.
When is Lord Shri Narasimha Jayanthi?? I think tomorrow is the smartha one
and day after is Vaishnava one. Are we supposed to fast tomorrow? In
iskcon,it is day after tomorrow and they do fasting till sunset and then feast.
Our family deity is Lord Shri Ramachandra Moorthy and in our house, there is
no practice of observing Shri Narasimha Jayanthi. But I would like to be
advised by the elders and learned.
Namaskarams,
Mani.
