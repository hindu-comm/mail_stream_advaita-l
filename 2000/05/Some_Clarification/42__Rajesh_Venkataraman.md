This verse is new to me(I am from Tamil Nadu) and is
not part of my SandhyA vandana(which has its origins
in the Sukla Yajur Veda). But to me the verse sounds
perfectly advaitic.

Can you let us know how our ISKCON friends interpret
this verse and reconcile it with
"SarvadharmAn parityajya mAmEkam SaraNam vraja
aham tvA sarva pApebhyO mokshayishyAmi mA shuchah"

If 'mAmEkam' is to be taken to mean the physical
entity Krishna(who is an avatAra of Vishnu), how can
he become Shiva? As far as I know physical
characteristics are always unique and no one can
become any other. And if you take Shiva and Vishnu to
be one and the same as indicated by the verse what is
it that 'links' the two?

Advaita's explanation is that the Atman(in the
subjective plane), which is the essence of every being
is identical in all beings, and physical
characteristics are just incidental and they obtain
their present form(whatever it is) due to their
prArabdhA.

Here you say that the Lord incarnated as Acharya
Sankara to wean the people away from the hold of
Buddhism by introducing them to the "lower" philosophy
of advaita so that they can gradually graduate to
"merging with the supreme lord"(whatever it means). If
that is so, (that the lord came to teach a lower
philosophy to help people grow) why should it be then
condemned later?

Do you ever condemn Kindergarten and all lower classes
just because you have become a graduate now? All those
classes were absolutely essential at that point of
time!

Here you quote that the Lord incarnated to misguide
people and increase population in the planet. Why
would the God take so much pains to incarnate to
MISLEAD people. What does he gain by doing that? If he
is a really compassionate lord why doesn't he guide
the errant ones on to the right path? Is he not
sadistic otherwise? Doesn't he have anything better to
do? How better is he than the Asuras? Even in our
Puranas the Lord incarnates only to help the Devas(who
are supposed to be good beings) and never to
'misguide' the Asuras. It is always only to teach the
Asuras a lesson so that they may improve.

Finally is it for guiding or misguiding that the Lord
incarnated?

Swami Vivekananda in his Chicago address said
"If anybody dreams of the exclusive survival of his own religion and the destruction of others, I pity him from the bottom of my heart, and point out to him that upon the banner of every religion will soon be written, in spite of resistance: "Help and not fight", "Assimilation and not Destruction", "Harmony and peace and not Dissension".

This is a message that Iskcon should read well. There is truth in other philosophies besides its own Hare Krishna philiosphy. So many great advaitic teachers have lived even in this century such as Swami Vivekananda, Sri Ramana Maharshi, Sai Baba etc. Were these teachers all mis leading people ?  What one needs is true spiritual awakening . Then one will be in a better position to understand the masters.
Till then follow a path in which one has faith and refrain from commenting on others.
Acharya Adi Shankara not only preached advaita but also wrote innumerable Bhakthi Shlokas. He had the large heart to compose shlokas in favor of any deity one wishes to think of,  so that one may practise as per one's faith.

Regarding Buddhism ,Adi Shankara only destroyed the degraded Buddhist cults and not the teachings of Bhagavan Buddha. Here is another quotation from Swami Vivekananda on this topic.

"Hinduism cannot live without Buddhism, nor Buddhism without Hinduism. Then realize what the separation has shown to us, that the Buddhists cannot stand without the brain and philosophy of the Brahmins, nor the Brahmin without the heart of the Buddhist. This separation between the Buddhists and the Brahmins is the cause of the downfall of India. That is why India is populated by three hundred
millions of beggars, and that is why India has been the slave of conquerors for the last thousand years. Let us then join the wonderful intellect of the Brahmin with the heart, the noble soul, the wonderful humanizing power of the Great Master. "
