One thing we must thank the ISKCONites and other VaiShNavas for is
the absolutely delicious, sAttvika food they serve in their temples. I have
eaten many excellent meals in Raghavendra Swamy Maths in Bangalore. The
ISKCON temple in Bangalore also serves some really delicious prasAda
after their weekend services. I have also heard that the ISKCON temple
in Juhu, Bombay serves " uniquely delicious" meals. When you eat at places
like the Raghavendra Swamy Math, usually, someone is singing kIrtans of
various dAsas in praise of Hari. It is a wonderful experience. Try it.
Then there are also  good Udipi Krishna restaurants all over the
world.  BhagavAn Hari has certainly blessed the VaiShNavas with the
art of cooking.
