Here Swami Chandrashekharendra Saraswati opines that Shankaracharya mainly
did not attack Buddhism, because by his time, the work had mostly been
completed and Buddhism was already in decline.  He thinks the credit
should go to Udayanacharya (Nyaya), and Kumarila Bhatta (Purva Mimamsa.)

This entire book "Hindu Dharma" is a treasure trove of information on all
aspects of Vedic Dharma by one of the foremost scholar/saints of modern
times.  I recommend it as a must read to everyone.
