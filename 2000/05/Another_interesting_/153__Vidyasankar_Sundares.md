There must be a mistake. Kumarila Bhatta is pre-Sankaran, but the only
significant Nyaya philosopher called Udayana was a post-Sankaran
personality. The tradition is that he and Sriharsha's father were
contemporaries. This Udayanacharya should have lived around 1000 CE, at
least two hundred years after Sankaracharya.
