Ravi, Vaidya and I want to keep the list on topic.  Too many discussion
forums for Hindusim become useless because they end up going all over the
place.  But we don't want to stifle discussion and we definitely don't
want to engage in censorship.  So we would prefer list members exercise
*self-discipline*.  It's a delicate balancing act and we don't always get
it right.  We encourage any list member with concerns to contact us
(listmaster at advaita-vedanta.org goes to all three of us.)


Jaldhar, Ravi, and Vaidya
