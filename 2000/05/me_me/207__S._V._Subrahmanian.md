It is interesting to note that the real problem is in the bleating of "me
me" (mamakAram), not in kAnta or tanayA or gR^haa or pashavAha.  It is "me
me"(mamakAram) that invites vrikaha(mortality) not kAnta or tanayA et al.

kaantaa ime me tanayaa ime me

evaM naro meshha samaana ruupaH
me me kR^itaH kaala vR^ikeNa niitaH |

This wife is mine, these children are mine, this house is mine,
and these cattle are mine, like this a man keeps on repeating "me
me" (pronounced like May, in Sanskrit it means mine) like a goat.
Hearing this "me me", comes the wolf kaala ( death)
  to snatch away his life.
