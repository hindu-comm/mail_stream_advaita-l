raama : O shrii raama,
shilaapi : Even a stone,
tvad-anghri-kshamaa-sa~NgireNu-prasadaat.h-hi:
           just by the Blessing of the dust of Your
           foot,
chaitanyam-aadhatta : obtained Vitality.
naraH : A human,
tvat-paada-dvandva-sevaa-vidhaanaat.h :
        By the dedicated Service of Your Feet,
suchaitanyameti : will attain to the supreme
                  Consciousness
ki.m : Where ?
chitram-adya : is the surprise.

O shrii raama, even a lifeless rock obtained vitality
by the contact with the dust of your Holy Feet. It is
no surprise,then, if an intelligent human being
attains Supreme Consciousness by the dedicated service
of Your Lotus Feet.

shrii sha~nkara is referring to the story of satii
ahalyA in the raamaayaNa. ahalyA was cursed by her
husband Sage goutama to become a rock. When shrii
raama touched that rock with His feet, the rock came
back to life. That, is the power of the Divine Feet of
the Lord.


Corrections are welcome.
Raghavendra.
