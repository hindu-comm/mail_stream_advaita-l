Few years back one of my friends asked me whether stones and rocks also
have a soul. I was about to say no, but fortunately this incident
flashed in my mind. It is not so correct to say a body or a rock
possesses a soul. It is actually the other way. The suuxma shariram can
identify itself based on its paraarabdha karma with any sthuula object.
It can be a rock or a human body. This misidentification leads the soul
to suffer with the states of the sthuula it is identifying with. In
bhagavatam we see that souls can identify themselves trees and suffer
that state.
