As Lord brahma and Lord rudra, He is the creator
and the Destroyer of the Universe. Since He is the
purusha, He is the Enjoyer of prakR^iti.

shriimannaaraayaNa in His trivikrama avataara measured

the entire Universe in three footsteps. So He is
referred to as the measurer. He is described in the
puruSha sUkta  as having 'atyatiSThaddashaa~Ngulam.h',
exceeded the universe,always by 10 finger-widths,
meaning that He is infinite. How can He not be able to
measure the Universe ?!

He is the netR^i or the Leader of the universe. As the
trimurti aspect of lord viShNu, He is the Preserver of
the Universe.

He has conquered the entire Universe. When He is all,
there is no surprise in His winning the Universe.

Finally He is the Supreme Father and Supreme Mother.


Corrections are welcome.
