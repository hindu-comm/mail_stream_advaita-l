Salutations to list members

May I know please in which scripture can we find the following Ganesha prayer?

srI vakratunda mahAkAya
sUryakOdi samaprabha
nirvignam kurumE dEva
sarvakAryEshu sarvadA

Normally before any auspicous events it is customary to recite this prayer to Sri Ganesha.  May I know when did this practice start?  Is it necessary to invoke Ganesha before beginning any undertakings in advaita sampradAya?  And other related info will also be appreciated.  

namaste
