This is the very first verse in the shrI-veda-pada-stava on Lord
chidambaresha, composed by Jaimini maharshhi.

it necessary to invoke Ganesha before beginning any undertakings in
advaita sampradAya?  And other related info will also be appreciated.

Yes, in the advaita sampradAya gaNesha is always worshiped before any
undertaking. gaNesha is also part of the pa.ncAyatana pUjA. You can
search for an excellent article written by Anand Hudli in the
web-archives.
