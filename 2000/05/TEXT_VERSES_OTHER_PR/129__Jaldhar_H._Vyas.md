I certainly agree with that. Let me say right now that my opinions on the
socio-political aspects of Advaita Vedanta are just that--my
opinions.  They are I think informed opinions based not justs on the texts
and thinkers of the tradition but my own experiences and observations of
attempting to put those tenets into practice in the world.

I agree.  However I think you are putting to much faith in statistics.
For example, If I am 4 feet tall and I'm apply to the NBA to be a
basketball player, arguing "the average height of my ethnic group is 6
feet 6 inches." won't get me anywhere.  Statistics tells you the average
trend.  It doesn't tell you anything about any particular point on the
graph.

Now  back to our subject, you're saying you have detected evidence of bias
against Hinduism.  Ok I believe you but what does that mean to me in my
life?  Apparently nothing.  So as not to appear selfish, let me also ask
what does this mean for my community?  Is anyone being prevented from
practicing Hinduism?  Are they losing their jobs, or being attacked?  Are
mandirs being burned down or anything?  In New Jersey we have a very large
Gujarati community, I'd say I know what's going on in it, My mother is
very active in organizations.  If there was some systematic repression of
Hinduism going on, I think i'd know about it.  If there are incidents
going on they should be dealt with but far bigger problems that exist are,
1.  Many Hindus are ignorant of their religion.
2.  Those that know do not always have the wherewithal to practice it.

It's not that the bias you've seen is not important but it is a lot less
important than these more pressing problems.

In the land of OJ Simpson and Monica Lewinsky?!!!  I think you need to get

And gossip columns have more influence on American attitudes than
scholarly journals.  Actually it is very interesting how American pop
culture has a pseudo-scholarly affection.  Look at the way the guests on
Oprah are careful to parade their Ph.Ds and MDs.  A big part of the appeal
of the New Age movement is the way it wraps up irrational ideas in big
smart-sounding words.  I don't think Hinduism wants to go there.

It's not the research but the interpretation of the results which is of
concern.  Sure everyone is doing it but that doesn't mean Hindus have to
join the band of vixtim groups looking for a quota.

But living in America will.  Listening to the interpreters of those
ancient texts (who also live in the world) will.

If I weren't interested in learning I wouldn't be replying to you.  Having
learnt what you tought I'm now rejecting it.

Yes.  Bias towards Hinduism is what I want to encourage.

Hence advaita-l is intented to inject Advaita Vedantic values into
the belief systems of others.  The difference between advaita-l and
propaganda is that it doesn't seek to force it's views on
anyone.  That is immoral and no Advaitin would want a part of it.  Anyone is
free to unsubscribe when they wish.  Sure life would be easier if everyone
understood and suported our beliefs but they have to choose to.  If they
don't well this is samsara and we have to deal with it.

Which Indians?  We're from Rajkot which was a princely state.  There was
no British presence in the administration there.  In fact most of my
ancestors were government officers of one type or another.

Yes there should be a Hindu presence.  A true Hindu presence not some
diluted, mixed up "Indic" presence.  Actually I look forward to the day
when "Hindu" is out of use and we have Smarta, Shaiva, Vaishnava etc.
presences.  But it might take a while to get there and we have to start by
getting our priorities straight.  The rest can wait for another day.

This is a very Greco-Semitic attitude isn't it?  Our shastras are not just
theoretical, they tell us how to live.  I have full faith in our shastras
and Gurus and believe they should be followed in all aspects of life.
