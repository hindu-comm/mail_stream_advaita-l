Matters to whom?  I don't doubt there are trends but what I'm trying to
get at is that ultimately all trends, movements and ideologies come down
to individual people.  The higher-level you go the more vague and less
relevant you get to the needs of individual people.

I wouldn't say blame.  I think the process of immigration occupies the
energy of the older generation and younger generation simply don't have
the means to practice it.  I'm sure you've heard of Hansons' Law.  It will
apply to Indians as much as it to every other ethnic group.

The person who wanted the mala hadn't any image problems.  His problem was
far more simple.

I don't know anyone like that.  I also don't think not declaiming your
Hindu identity to all and sundry means you are trying to hide it.  To go
back to the dhoti thing, it was very interesting to see peoples reaction
to it.  I was quite surprised by the negative reaction I got from many
people.  Now some were perhaps self-hating cowards, but most of them were
not.  The fact is, our culture sees fitting into society at large as a
positive value.  Those people thought I wasn't doing that.  (Btw, my
reasons for dressing that way are neither religious, or for ethnic pride
but because I find Indian clothes more comfortable in 90 degree
weather.  In most of the cases the problem with those who reacted
negatively was not that they didn't understand their own culture, but they
didn't understand America.  I don't think it's even fair to ask the
immigrant generation to understand America the conceptual leap is so
great.  Younger generations don't need to apologize to or react against
American culture, they are American but they lack information on what it
means to be Hindu.   That's the group that needs to be worked with.

Again, I don't think people by and large feel uncomfortable expressing
their Hinduism in this environment.  It's the values of our own culture
which urge them to keep things personal.  I find that younger people
(including myself) are more brash in outward displays of identity but that
is a measure of their assimilation into American modes of ethnic identity
not "Hindu" ones.

Advaita Vedanta counsels us to be like Jadabharata who inwardly was a
great sage but outwardly was shunned by society as a freak and a madman.
In America we don't have to go to such extremes.  Americans are very
generous, tolerant people their philosophy is to each their own.  This is
in contrast to England where I grew up.  There, there was a palpable
feeling amongst Indians that they were second-class citizens.  There, I
might agree with you.  Not here.  Here, frankly I don't think it matters
much if we are respected as long as we're free to practice our beliefs.

Hinduism itself.  The daily contact between articulate Hindus with other
people.  That's the only change that really counts.

Yes I can.  The difference is I'm only giving out my views to those who
ask for them.  If they don't want to know then I don't care.

Insofar as Academics print texts, maintain libraries etc.  They are
useful.  Academic interpretations are interesting but not practically
relevant.

New age movements are often annoying but mostly harmless.

Put it this way, insofar as there has to be propoganda at all, I want
Hindu propoganda.  Not Buddhist, not "Indic", not "Pluralist".

Well yes.  Propaganda is all about politics.  It's about getting one
viewpoint across regardless of objectivity.  If someone wants to conduct
propaganda in my name, I want to make quite sure it fits in with my point
of view.  And I don't take it for granted  that that someone is striving for
the same goal as me.

I think there is a better way of getting ones views across than
propaganda though.  It may seem old-fashioned in this cynical age but I
believe in the power of integrity.  Even if they end up not agreeing with
the message of Advaita Vedanta, I think people appreciate that the members
of this list will give them that view in an honest, straightforward, and
informed way.  By diluting that message we may temporarily gain more
sympathizers but we would be betraying their trust.

As I said before, it is not so much your data that I'm questioning but the
interpretation you're putting on it.

And once again you are generalizing about all Indians or all Hindus on the
basis of the behavior of some.  Yes, the British presence deeply affected
some segments of the population.  It hardly touched others.

What is "the community"?  Ideologically my faith is more like that of
South Indians than most of my Gujarati neighbors.  Yet the mandir I
usually go to follows the Vaishnava Pushti Margi sect.  Even though it is
ideologically incompatible, its' language, mode of worship etc. are more
attractive to me.  I feel rather uncomfortable in South Indian
mandirs.  Punjabis, I barely consider part of my religion at all.  Of
course all these groups share the pan-Indian beliefs and practices of
Hinduism so there is some common ground.  but is that enough to make a community?  I
think not.  If a Punjabis or South Indian
came to me for help, I'd try to help him become a better Punjabi or South
Indian,  there's nothing wrong with those things but theres

Amongst those people who I consider to be in my community, I see little
practical evidence of this bias you speak of.

The portrayal may not be perfect but it is adequate.  There are more
important things to worry about first.

I do not accept your either/or.  There is a big middle ground.  The
community of people I care about is larger than myself and smaller than
America at large.

I don't claim to be statistically relevant.  I do however claim that
statistically relevant, does not equal real life relevant.  Scientific

Because they ask me to?  Because one of the aspects of my dharma is to
teach those texts when asked to?

I accept there is pluralism and diversity.  I would rather see this
diversity expressed than some false unity.  However the mere existence of
different opinions doesn't mean they are all worth the same.  I am biased
towards the Smarta religion.  And the fact is the Acharyas of my religion
have treated Shaivism and Vaishnavism differently than Buddhism.  In fact
they have roundly condemned the latter.

The message I get from the shastras, is that desh and kala are maya.  So
modern-day America poses no special challenges and makes no more demands
than any other place and time.  Far from burying my head in the sand, this
actually frees me to take each practical situation that comes up in daily
life, deal with it--and drop it.  If you look at India the fastest growing
religions are traditionalist in orientation.  The 19th century reform
movements were attuned to the needs of their day but having made a big
emotional and theological commitment to a kind of do-good socialism, they
are floundering in todays capitalist India.  Traditional or
neo-traditional sects never made that investment so they find it easier to
re-orient to new situations.  The same is true in America.  It is the
liberal Jewish and Christian sects which are hemorraging members.  It is
fundamentalists who are innovating and keeping hold of their followers.

I listen to what the public is saying.  My public is different from your
public.  As to being impractical, well we've been impractical for how many
thousand years now?

Defensive?  I thought I was just answering your questions.  Be that as it
may everyone who lives in American society, has to become an
anthropologist, a sociologist, and a psychologist whether they want to be
or not.  Noone can afford to surrender those roles to "experts."

But not impressed enough to actually live by it eh?

This whole topic came up due to the assertion that Hinduism needs Buddhism
to give it "heart".  It continued due to the assertion that Hinduism needs
Buddhism to help defend against some vague threat.  What I know is that
neither of those assertions are true.
