namaste,
     The famous temple in that region is the krODa
shankara-nArAyaNa temple. I do not know much about the
place apart from that it has been mentioned in the
digvijaya. The stOtra consists of shlokas with dual
meanings; the same shlOka reads differently for Hari
and Hara. It is embedded in the digvijaya itself. If
you get the sringEri edition with the shlOkas in
Kannada script and translation in kannada, you can get
the stOtra. Swami Tapasyananda's translation contains
the translated shlokas too.

Regards,
Raghavendra.
