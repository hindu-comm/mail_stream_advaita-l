This is interesting information. Could you share publication details of this
early subcommentary? How is it known that he is prior to Anandagiri?

A signficant feature of N P's Tippana on C U is that it

This reminds me of a very careful study done by the late Daniel Ingalls,
comparing their two commentaries on the brahmasUtra. He has shown that
entire passages in Bhaskara's commentary are common to Sankaracharya's
commentary, and deduces that both of them seem to have closely followed the
earlier vRttikAra in these sections. Bhaskara also quotes entire passages
from Sankaracharya's gItAbhAshya.
