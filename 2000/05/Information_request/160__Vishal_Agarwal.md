Could members list some sources that give a bird's eye view of the life and
works of

1. Shankarananda
2. Balakrishnananda
3. Apayya Dikshit
4. Gopalayatindra
5. Narendra Puri

Maybe the introduction of a printed edition of one of their works that has
the relevant information. Thank you in advance.

Sincerely,

Vishal Agarwal
