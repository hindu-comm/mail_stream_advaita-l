22: sriimaan: One on whose chest the goddess Sri always dwells.

23: keshavaH: One whose kesha or locks are beautiful. Or, one who is himself
the three - kaH (brahmaa), aH(viShNu) and Ishaa (Shiva). Or, one who
destroyed the asura keshi in the kR^iShNa incarnation.

24: puruShottamaH: The greatest among all puruShaas - spirits. Or, one
greater than all individual spirits. In the GitA (15:18) it is said:

yasmaad xaraM atIto.aham axaraad api chottamaH
ato.asmi loke vede cha prathitaH purushottamaH

- "As I transcend the xara (the changeful) and the axara (the unchanging), I
am called puruShottama in the Vedas and in common language."
