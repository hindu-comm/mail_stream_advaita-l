25: sarvaH - The omniscient source of all existence.

Mahaabhaarata (Ud 70.11) says:

asatascha sataschaiva sarvasya prabhavaapyayaat
sarvasya sarvadaa GYAnaat sarvamenam pracakshate.

- "As He is the source of all things gross and subtle, and as He knows all
things at all times - He is called sarva."

26: sharvaH - Destroyer.  He destroys the whole universe at the time of
pralaya or cosmic dissolution.

27: shivaH - Pure one. For He is not affected by the three guNaas of
prakR^iti - satva, rajas and tamas.  The kaivalya upanishad(1.8) says: "sa
brahmaa sa shivaH - He is both brahmaa and shiva." In the light of this
statement of non-difference between shiva and viShNu, it is viShNu himself
that is exalted by praise and worship of shiva.
