On reading the works of astika authors with first-hand experience of
Buddhism whether Vedantins of various stripes, Mimamsakas or Nayayikas, it
becomes clear that they considered Buddhist teachings to be the vilest
heresy.  The poet Jayadeva (who lived at the very end of Indian
Buddhism) is the only author I've encountered so far who has had anything
good to say about Buddha and his teachings.  As I mentioned in my other
post they may have had warm personal relationships but on a philosophical
level?  Certainly not.

But Hinduism *has* lived without Buddhism for many centuries now.

If Buddhism survives today it is because of its enthusiastic adoption by
foreign cultures often in forms which would hardly be recognizable
to the classical authors.  India and Hinduism have not helped a bit.

This type of formulation is mildly insulting to both Brahmins and
Buddhists.  Neither has a monopoly nor deficit in brains or heart.

Thailand has many beggars, what are we to make of that?  Slavery was ended
in Tibet by the Communists not compassionate Buddhists.

Learning about Buddhism is important to understand the development of
Advaita Vedanta and other astika darshans but on a practical level it is
irrelevant.
