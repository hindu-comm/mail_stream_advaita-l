However what they meant by "knowledge of one's self" is often drastically
different from what Vedanta means by it.  In Samkhya/Yoga it is the Guru
with his special yogic insight who is able to impart the knowledge that
delivers one from bondage. In fact a lot of the discussion in the
Brahmasutras concerning the validity of the "Kapila smrti" or Samkhya
teachings as Pramana revolves around the omniescence of Maharshi Kapila.
Some schools took this further to even suggest that a Sadguru could
transmit liberation through touch.  (Viz the shaktipat of Kashmiri
Shaivism.)

For the Mimamsakas attaining heaven was the original goal.  Later they
adopted the idea of mukti but for them it just means ultimate freedom from
pain, there is not necessarily self-knowledge involved.  In any case the
means to this release are through the performance of Karma alone.

The Pancharatra Agamas are outside the Vedic cannon but naturally the
Vaishnavas find ways to harmonize their teachings with the Vedas just as
the Shaivas do with the Shaivagamas, and the Shaktas with the Tantras.
