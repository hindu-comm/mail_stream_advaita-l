You've missed the point by Jaldhar: does the Buddhist claim that there
exists a paramArtha satya that cannot be grasped by sense-experience or
the intellect but by the Self alone?

I had quoted from Cheng's book "Empty Logic" before on this list, and it
will do much good if you read what he has to say when he compares
mAdhyamika with advaita:

"But perhaps Nagarjuna's negation is quite different from Upanishadic
negation. The latter assumes the existence of an inexpressible essential
substratum, and the main aim is to describe, by negation, an absolute
which cannot be expressed. The Madhyamika negations do not assume an
inexpressible essential substratum, nor is their purpose to describe, by
negation, this reality, rather to deny that there can be such a reality."
