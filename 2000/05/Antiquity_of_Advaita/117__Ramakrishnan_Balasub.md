Thanks to Kartik for pointing out passages from relevant texts. I'll
try to post some relevant excerpts from sha.nkaras works later. But
one thing various people have overlooked (although Jaldhar touched
upon this) the fact that shruti (and smR^iti) pramANa *alone* can
produce realization. It would be quite clear to anyone not infected by
vacuous optimism that sha.nkara makes it quite clear that avidyA is
destroyed by the shruti pramANa only. shruti is a pramANa (means of
knowing), that should be quite clear. It's not a record of some
mystical realizations of some X or Y or Z. The Buddhists don't accept
shruti pramANa, hence their avidyA cannot be destroyed. There is no
question of the sha.nkara and Nagarjuna having the same "realization".
End of story.

Exactly. "I sat down in meditation and realized this truth, hence it
must be true" kind of stuff is not vedAnta. Old time list members may
remember the time when this list was overrun by such characters. Many
(if not all) of them were trying to use this list as a springboard for
guru-hood, again clear to anyone not infected by vacuous optimism.
Yes, at least I share your feelings.

That is true! But, I feel, the fact is, on the practical side, it is this
"woman and gold" that are foundation (or food) for this mamakaram.  It this
fact that makes a householder's life all the more difficult when it comes to
directing it towards Him.

It is interesting to note that the real problem is in the bleating of "me
me" (mamakAram), not in kAnta or tanayA or gR^haa or pashavAha.  It is "me
me"(mamakAram) that invites vrikaha(mortality) not kAnta or tanayA et al.

This wife is mine, these children are mine, this house is mine,
and these cattle are mine, like this a man keeps on repeating "me
me" (pronounced like May, in Sanskrit it means mine) like a goat.
Hearing this "me me", comes the wolf kaala ( death)
  to snatch away his life.
