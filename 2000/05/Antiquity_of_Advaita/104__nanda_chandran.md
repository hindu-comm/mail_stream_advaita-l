In the classical SAmkhya of Ishwara Krishna, GaudapAda and VAcaspati,
liberation is seperation of Purusha from PrAkriti. Purusha being pure
consciousness, it can liberate itself only by knowledge - knowledge of
itself as being distinct from prAkriti. Yoga since it concentrates more on
practice, also involves mind and body control along with the traditional
jnAna. But it's only the traditional jnAna of the Upanishads - knowledge of
the Self. The SAmkhya even has a super imposition theory similar to Advaita.

Are you sure about their view of mukti? The Miimaamsakaas have written
profound works on epistemology and I doubt if they were dogmatic enough to
say that mukti is attained through karma. Both KumArilla and PrabhAkara
incline towards the NyAya/Vaishesika view of the Self and the world. But
again KumArilla's view of the Atman actually angles more towards the JainA
view (an evolving Self), which goes well with his school's basic emphasis on
karma. PrabhAkara only insists that even after liberation one should perform
one's obligatory karmas since they have been enjoined by the shruti.
