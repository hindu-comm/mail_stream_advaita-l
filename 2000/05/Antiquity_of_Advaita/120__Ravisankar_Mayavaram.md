Interesting question.

>From the biographical accounts of Buddha's life I have read, he did
explore and learn other traditions like yoga before embarking on his
own. His earnestness in finding a solution to the suffering would have
definitely prompted him to study veda-s. We can probably say that he
outrightly rejected the karma kaaNDa. I think he must taken some of his
ideas from the upanishads.

Aside: shriivaishNava-s do not accept gautama buddha (Prince Siddharta
who became buddha) as an avatar of nArAyaNa. I  read this in two
different posts in bhakti-list. It seems there is a reference to buddha
in mahabharata where bhishma tells krishna that you came as buddha to
mislead asura-s. I read in that post that it is aadi buddha who is a
minor avatar of vishhNu and he was before krishna.  But one conflicting
point is annaamacharya in his kriti DOlaayam ... refers to the buddha
and kalki after krishna. (daruna budhha kalki dashavita avataraa).
Annamacharya is also a shriivaishNava.

In any case if you accept buddha as an incarnation of nArAyaNa then the
question whether he is a jnaani or not is not so meaningful. And if
nArAyaNa does not know the shruti, who else can claim they know it? If
you do not accept him as an avatara then it is a different ball game.
