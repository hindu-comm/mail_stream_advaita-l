See, this is sAdhya-sama. From Nagarjuna's perspective, you are assuming
that there is a something called paramArtha, and that understading the
SUnyatA of things is another thing. And then you conclude that therefore
there is a thing called paramArtha.

Do the prajnApAramitA texts say that this tathatA is the same everywhere and
at all times, that it is an unconditioned absolute? And if the paramArtha
truth is something other than the understanding of SUnyatA, what is samvRtti
then? So, are there three things now, samvRtti, SUnyatA and paramArtha?

Clearly, that is how the Vedantins and the Buddhists conceived it. This is
probably what taittirIya upanishad 2.7 means, when it says, asann eva sa
bhavati etc.

No. By remaining silent, he says that he neither endorses it nor denies it.
Nagarjuna also explicitly says that he has no ultimate thesis of his own to
propound. So again, there is more to it than logical quibbling.

Again, no. Absolutism does not have to mean monism or non-dualism.
Vaiseshikas had their absolutes, in the paramANus. Samkhya as well as Yoga
had their absolutes, purusha and prakRti. For the Mimamsakas, you could
label the apaurusheya Vedas as their absolute. And there would have
certainly been Aupanishadas, the proto-Vedantins, who had Brahman for their
absolute, whether in a saguNa or in a nirguNa sense, and whether in a
advaita or in a bhedAbheda sense.

Read above, he neither endorses nor denies an ultimate reality. So he
wouldn't agree that his stance would lead to nihilism, but that does not
mean that it would lead to absolutism either.

If you read the MAdhyamaka ShAstram, all of

What is the issue here? Is it the intelligibility of something that exists?
Or is it existence itself? Is it existence of a thing, or is it Existence
with a capital E? Does such a thing as Existence with a capital E even make
sense for Nagarjuna's teaching?

And that is precisely why his is the minority opinion in Buddhism, with all
the later authors criticizing Chandrakirti for it, and for misunderstanding
Nagarjuna totally.

So now it is only the Buddhist who is indulging in logical quibbling? I
thought both Vedantins and Buddhists were, in criticizing each other.
Besides, by the time Sankara and Advaita emerged, Buddhism had at least 1200
years of tradition behind it.

Nihilism may be the wrong interpretation of SUnyatA, under Nagarjuna's
logic. But so would absolutism, or eternalism, if you prefer to call it
that. That there is a higher truth does not make it an absolute/eternal for
Nagarjuna.

I'm quite aware that Nagarjuna uses the term prapancopaSama. But the
question is, does Madhyamaka imply anything ontologically at all? Aren't you
thrusting a Vedantic ontology upon him?

Granted the ethics and inward search are what matter practically. But
precisely because of that, we can allow for the fact that even if it is
the same, the fruit of the inward search gets reflected differently in
different buddhis. And we can also allow for the fact that the fruit of the
inward search might indeed be different. We won't know unless we have the
same experiential knowledge from both sides and certitude that they are the
same. That is an extremely tough call.

No, I don't say that I believe "in" both of the realities. But I can respect
a reality that I don't believe in, even if I believe that it is different
from the one that I do believe in, and even if the actual difference between
them is only a matter of my belief that they are different.

If the wise express it in many ways, that hardly amounts to their saying the
same thing. My statement about the modern dogma does not deny that Truth is
one. The Truth can be one, but whether everybody sees it that way is a big
question. I think all the similarities and differences and mutual influences
between the two systems lie in the details of the argumentation, which
cannot be dismissed as logical quibbling.
