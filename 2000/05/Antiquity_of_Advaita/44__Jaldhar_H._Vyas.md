As this was a long post, I'm replying to it in several sections.

The Gaudiya crticisms essentally boil down to two propositions:

1.  The Advaita philosophy was started by Shankaracharya.

2.  It is mainly directed against Buddhism even though it is only a
    rearrangement of Buddhist teachings.

Do these arguments hold water?

In the first matter it should be noted that Shankaracharya himself does
not claim any originality for his teachings.  In fact he notes that
without a parampara one is as good as blind.

Two pre-Shankaran works on Advaita Vedanta survive today.  The Karikas on
the Mandukyopanishad are by Gaudapadacharya who was Shankaracharyas'
paramaguru.  Mandana Mishra wrote the Brahmasiddhi.  He was a contemporary
of Shankaracharya and tradition says when he was defeated in debate by
Shankaracharya, he became the Acharyas' shishya under the name
Sureshwaracharya.

There are other names we know of through quotes by later authors but whose
works do not survive.  Upavarsha wrote vrittis on the Purva Mimamsa,
Brahma sutras, Bhagavadgita, and several Upanishads.  Shankaracharya
indicates his reverence for Upavarsha by refering to him as Bhagavan.
Sundara Pandya (whose name indicates he was probably a South Indian king)
wrote a vartika on the Brahmasutravrtti.  Brahmanandin wrote commentary
called vakya on the Chandogyopanishad.  A certain Dravidacharya wrote a
bhashya on this.

These authors are quoted by later Advaitins but most importantly for their
authenticity they are quoted by opponents of Advaita too.

The second proposition is more plausible but still falls short.  It is
true that Shankaracharya devotes a lot of energy to refuting Buddhist
tenets (whih are *very* different from Vedantic teachings) but
"astika" philosophies like Samkhya also come under fire.  The
very existence of Advaita Vedanta can be considered a refutation of some
aspects of Purva Mimamsa.  In one place in the Brahmasutrabhashya the
Pancharatra school (which was the forerunner of Shrivaishnavism) is
criticized.  There is literary, and archeological evidence for the
existence of the theistic sects (though not necessarily in the exact form
they have today.)  In fact the reason Shankaracharya started the practice
of Panchayatana puja was because the many different sects of Vaishnavas,
Shaivas, Shaktas, Ganapatya, and Sauras were too busy bickering with each
other to unite against the nastikas.

Shankaracharya did much to weaken the hold of Buddhism (as did Purva
Mimamsakas like Kumarila Bhatta, Prabhakara Mishra, and Naiyayikas like
Udayanacharya) but it did not disappear from India until several centuries
later.
