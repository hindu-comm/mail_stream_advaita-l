 I thought I understood what "unreal" means in advaita. You have brought me
 to my senses. Please explain what "unreal" means in advaita. We'll worry
 about Buddhism later.

 This is wrong as per advaita. If the world is defined just by what we know
 it becomes only an idea fabricated without basis by the mind. This is
 refuted by Shankara in the sUtra bhAshhya. See nAbhAva upalabdheH.
 The advaitin's point is that the world is perceived in a *substratum*.
 Such a world that is perceived in the substratum is negated at the dawn
 of jnAna in the very substratum where it was perceived.

 mAyA shows this??? This is news to me. Please explain.

 No, advaita cannot merely be an intellectual exercise. It cannot be an
 arm-chair philosophy. advaita dialectics, no doubt, seem to be intellectual
 exercises but they are, in fact, meant for use in manana, reflection on
 the vAkyas of the upanishhads. In dialectics, one has to be formal,
 precise, and use razor-sharp arguments. No handwaving such as
 "remaining silent" can be used.

 Silence is golden sometimes but sometimes it is the hallmark
 of a fool who avoids speaking lest he be recognized as such. Or silence
 may mean that what is left after "Knowledge eats itself up", as you say,
 is irrelevant. If you say something silly to an immensely learned person
 he may remain silent, thereby indicating that your remark is not worth
 responding to. If this is the sense in which the Bauddhas explain what is
 left after the world is negated, then it is totally different from advaita.
 So mere silence of the Bauddhas does not necessarily mean that something
 profound is being indicated.

 Note that I am not criticizing Buddhism as such. What I cannot agree
 to, until I see evidence otherwise, is that the silence of the Bauddhas
 implies or indicates Brahman as we advaitins define it.

 Please list some advaita works where this view has been accepted.
