Well Shankaracharya wants to position himself not as the promulgator of
new and original ideas but the rescuer of eternal truths which had for
various reasons become obscured.  I don't know if Buddha felt the same way
but later Buddhhist cosmology makes Shakyamuni just one historical
instance of an eternal and ahistorical line of Buddhas.  Originality is
not something that is prized in pre-modern cultures.   In fact many times
you see authors bend over backwards to show how unoriginal they are.

What are the Vedas if not the recorded experiences of the Rshis?  The
Brahmasutras and other interpretative works fit your definition of
framework but the Buddhists did not just reject (or ignore) that but the
Vedic experience itself.

Actually members of this list have mentioned sayings of his which show
considerable knowledge of classical Advaita Vedanta.  I haven't read him
myself so I can't comment on the veracity of that.

1. Why is a textual framework any less of a direct experience than
anything else?

2. One should not confuse any old vague mystical notions with Advaita
Vedanta.  In fact mysticism need not imply non-dualism at all.

Such a theory might have some merit if it could be shown that the
socio-politifical effects of Buddhism were any different from that of
Hinduism but there is little evidence of that.  Far from being the
proto-socialists of modern Indian mythology, they were probably more
elitist than anyone else.  Caste was not an issue for them because lay
life itself was irrelevant albeit accepted grudgingly as a necessary evil
to support the sangha.  (Later Buddhist movements gave more scope to
laymen but this was after the Indian period.)  Concentrated in large
viharas under royal patronage, they could not survive the Muslim
invasions.  Hindu movements were also affected but were able to rebound
due to their base of popular support.
