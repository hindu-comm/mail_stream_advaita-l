And you want us to presume you are?

The words "but perhaps" are not used by Cheng as an admission of his doubt
in this regard, rather it is his way of modestly offering his opinion on
a subject in which he is a well-known professor.

I have read Nagarjuna's work "mUla madhyamaka kArikA." (David J.
Kalupahana gives the Sanskrit original with translation, though his
explanatory notes aren't very good). In each of the roughly 30 chapters in
his book, Nagarjuna examines an entity (e.g. kAla parIksha -- examination
of time) and concludes that the entity is shUnyaM (empty). Nagarjuna's
central thesis is "sarvaM idaM shUnyaM" (All this is empty), and nowhere
does he admit of an absolute. In fact, he appears to be saying the exact
opposite, "There is NO absolute"! This is a far cry from VedAnta, where
Brahman is declared to be an absolute within the first three verses of the
Brahma sUtras. Shankara makes this point perfectly clear in his BhAshhya.

Nagarjuna also makes a judgment stemming from experience, "All entities
are subject to causation." Again in stark contrast, VedAnta firmly upholds
Brahman as transcending causation.

If you're referring to some mystical realization that you've had on
reading the kArikA, I would have to say, "No thank you, but I'm not
interested." I'm sure many others on this list share my feelings.
