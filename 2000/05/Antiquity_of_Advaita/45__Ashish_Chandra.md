A discussion/argument on the antiquity of the Advaita tradition had taken
place on alt.hindu. Vidyasankar Sundaresan had posted an excellent
refutation of some of the objections non-Advaita Vedanta traditions have.

It can be found here:
http://www.hindunet.org/alt_hindu/1995_Jan/msg00121.html

Another post dealt with some of the objections of the opponent is here:

Srimad GaudapadAcharya is often pointed to as propounder of a prachanna
bauddha (Buddhism in disguise) philosophy. Vidya posted another of his
brilliant write-ups to show what the he (GaudapadAcharya) has said in his
kArikas. Just to make this interesting, here is an extract from Vidya's
post:

"...GaudapAda's use of ajAtivAda assumes the eternal nature
of Brahman. Again GaudapAda's purpose here is to maintain the eternality of
Brahman, something the Buddhist does not consider at all. The Buddhist uses
ajAtivAda for momentariness, GaudapAda uses ajAtivAda to show that there has
to exist one eternal. Finally the four-fold negation of the Buddhist is
examined. KArikAs 82 - 86 explain that the Lord (the exact word he uses is
bhagavAn) is untouched by and above the four-fold negation. however, it
cannot be said that mAyA is also untouched by this four-fold negation.
Finally, at the end of it all comes the master coup - idam buddhena na
bhAshitam - this was not said by the Buddha."

I don't wish to judge bhedAbheda philosophy since I only know the principle
of it, but by going through the posts by some of the followers of
bhedAbheda, I can safely say that not one of them could refute what Vidya
said, and some of them even resorted to the age-old adage of
when-cornered-heap-abuses. Needless to say, its indeed refreshing to see
someone like Bhaskar trying to actually "discuss" his beliefs than
outrightly defend his position.
