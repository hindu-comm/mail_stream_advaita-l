Yes, absolutizing a Truth and calling it "paramArtha" is completely
mis-interpreting Nagarjuna. As he sees it, postulating a paramArtha is a
disease.

That is the Zen approach to philosophy.

In the book "Zen mind, beginner's mind," Shunryu Suzuki explains that the
Zen mind is not the mature mind that has already completed its studies and
is full of ideas. Rather it is the empty mind that has just begun to seek
and learn. The Zen mind is the beginner's mind.

If you can make the equation Empty mind = Self, you *MAY* be able to
reconcile advaita to Zen. But that still doesn't mean that mAdhyamika
is close to advaita when you speak of the two *philosophical systems*. If
there isn't the postulate of an absolute reality, the system cannot even
remotely resemble advaita, no matter what it says (or doesn't say).

Get your facts right. According to Nagarjuna, the dharma is shUnya.

He didn't.
