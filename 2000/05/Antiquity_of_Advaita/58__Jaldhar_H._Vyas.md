I'm sure your email program has a delete key.  Please use it on any posts
you do not find good to read.

Well I admit that particular tangent of that thread is straying from the
charter of this list a bit however in my opinion meta-discussion of the
works of Advaita Vedanta is a must.  They did not occur in a
vacuum. Part of the problem nowadays is a crisis of meaning.  Due to the
dislocations and upheaval in traditional society there are now many people
who have difficulty dealing with views you and I take for granted.  We
cannot simply turn our backs on those people.  We should always be
prepared to give them answers--not necessarily answers they like but
answers nonetheless.

Those people who have doubts and questions must feel free to voice
them.  This is the first and most vital step to removing doubts.

The beauty of the Internet is it is "elastic".  Adding more posts needn't
displace ones which are already there.  As one who has enjoyed and learned
from your posts in the past, I avidly await their resumption as I'm sure,
do many other people.  Please go ahead and write about what interests you
and don't let "irrelevant" posts bother you.

To list members who have hitherto remained silent, don't be shy.  This
list exists to help you understand Advaita Vedanta.  If you have questions
feel completely free to post them here.
