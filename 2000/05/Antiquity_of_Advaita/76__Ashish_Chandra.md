Rajiv,

Maybe I'm just getting caught up in the use of words. But I will give myself
another go at it.

AFAIK, neti neti does not negate per se. It negates the presence of any
qulificands to what it is actually describing. I think the verse reads
"Yenidam sarvam vijanati, tam kena vijaniyat? sa esh neti neti Atma". So the
presence of Atma (Absolute) is already presumed. A simple question to ask
would be, does Madhyamika admit to there being anything once "everything"
has been negated?


ashish

p.s. I have not read the entire post you posted about whether or not
madhyamika is non-theistic.
