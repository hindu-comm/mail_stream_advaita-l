While VedAnta negates the world on the basis of the Atman, the Self, the
pure subject, the Bauddhas who deliberately misinterpret the Atman to be an
eternal ego, negate the world on the basis of VijnAptimAtratA or pure
consciousness. While this VijnAptimAtratA is explicit in VijnAnavAda, it is
implied in the MAdhyamaka, which doesn't want to put it out in specific
words.
