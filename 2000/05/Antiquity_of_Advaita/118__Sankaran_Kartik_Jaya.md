There are two problems with this:

1) I'm not sure if you're saying that the Rishis obtained realization
after accessing the shruti (by means of supersensory perception) or
whether it was the other way around (they obtained realization and then
"saw" the shruti). In either case, they weren't "taught" the shruti. Why
cannot someone follow the same path the Rishis did and then obtain
realization, thus completely bypassing a "study" of the shruti?

2) You could very well claim that GauDapaada disagreed with Nagarjuna's
philosophy of mAdhyamika, however, there is every reason to believe that
he considered the Buddha a GYAnii. I'm yet to see a single argument
establishing why the Buddha is not to be considered so. Did the Buddha
study the shruti?
