> Yes. But language to them is not simply mental.

Doesn't matter.  The point is that language (in particular the language of
the Vedas) per the astika view is capable of informing us about truth.
This is the polar opposite of the idea that language is obfuscatory or
intrinsically meaningless.


Point is well taken. However, aren't the Vedas fully understood only by
someone at a higher state of consciousness? So 'capable of informing us
about truth' should be examined in light of the preparations required and
levels of those who made those statements in the old days.
