To say that jivas are real is vastly different from saying one should submit
to the power of Ishwara for salvation. All Astika schools - SAmkhya/Yoga,
NyAya/Vaishesika and even Purva Miimaamsaa - before RAmanuja hold that
salvation is to be obtained only by knowledge of one's Self. Bhakti is OK,
if it helps in acquiring knowledge of the Self. But nobody says that Ishwara
himself can deliver one from bondage.

The BhAgavatha and PancharAthra, though ShankarAchArya himself notes as
being ancient, are not Vedic schools, as the commonly recognized six are. Or
is there any difference of opinion in that?
