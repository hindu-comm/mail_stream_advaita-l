ShUnya is the invalidity of *all* pramAnas in the ultimate sense. But
Jaladhar, this is not the view of the Bauddhas alone. Even in Advaita the
pramAnas are ultimately invalid for Brahman is beyond the senses, mind and
intellect. That's why you have a phenomenal truth - samvritti satya and an
absolute truth - paramArtha satya. The pramAnas are only valid in samvritti,
but Brahman - paramArtha - cannot be grasped by them.
