So here is an important difference.  Brahman is not distinct from
trigunatmaka prakrti but is it's most refined form.  The nearest Samkhya
equivalent would be avyakta or mula prakrti which is not the same as
purusha at all.

The Samkhyakarikas use the word abhyasa to describe the analysis of the
seven modes of being.  These seven are properties of the
intellect.  Advaita Vedanta only admits of one type of being (Ok two if
you count non-being) and this is an innate property of the Self.

Really?  I'd like to know about that.  Purush is 100% seperate from
Prakrti in their system.  So it is dualist not non-dual.  This has
practical implications.  For instance omething like Jivanmukti would be
impossible in Samkhya.

I don't see what being dogmatic or otherwise has to do with it.

The differences with the Advaitin view should be readily apparent.

Both these darshans as they stand today have been "Vedantized" but in
their heyday they could not be reconciled to Advaita so easily.
