Does Advaita talk of a conceptual pAramArthika state? And that is the only
reality that there is. What does Madhyamika's "unconceptualized" absolute
amount to then, if that is what you meant?

We talk of energy pervading the entire material world. Yet, no one has seen
it and still everyone insists that it exists.

I hope you don't mind but I am having some trouble with the
"conceptualizing" part. While it certainly might be too abstruse a thing to
simplify, I understand Shunyata better when it is defined as per the
four-fold negation and then whetever remains is not absolute => nihilism.
Logically, I find it hard to understand how one can say that an absolute is
the presence of nothing and absence of everything.
