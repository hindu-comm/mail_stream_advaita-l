A related question of mainly historical significance. Is it really true
that at some point of time in medieval India, Buddhist monks were drowned
in the Ganga by supporters of the then Shankaracharyas? These claims are
made mainly by Christian fundamentalists as a shield whenever they are
questioned about the evangelization techniques (the Goa Inquisition, for
instance) employed by foreign missionaries in India.
