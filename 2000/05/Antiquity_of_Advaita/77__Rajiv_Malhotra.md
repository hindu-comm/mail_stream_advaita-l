A simple question to ask would be, does Madhyamika admit to there being
anything once "everything" has been negated?


ashish

My understanding of this is "Yes". Please refer to the article by Alan
Wallace sent yesterday directly on the question whether Buddhism is
nontheistic.

Rajiv



p.s. I have not read the entire post you posted about whether or not
madhyamika is non-theistic.
