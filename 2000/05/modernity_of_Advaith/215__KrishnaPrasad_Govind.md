A small cut&paste from an article about hologram,Universe, brain structure
etc.
..

A hologram is a three- dimensional photograph made with the aid of a laser.

To make a hologram, the object to be photographed is first bathed in the
light of a laser beam. Then a second laser beam is bounced off the reflected
light of the first and the resulting interference pattern (the area where
the two laser beams commingle) is captured on film.

When the film is developed, it looks like a meaningless swirl of light and
dark lines. But as soon as the developed film is illuminated by another
laser beam, a three-dimensional image of the original object appears.

The three-dimensionality of such images is not the only remarkable
characteristic of holograms. If a hologram of a rose is cut in half and then
illuminated by a laser, each half will still be found to contain the entire
image of the rose.

Indeed, even if the halves are divided again, each snippet of film will
always be found to contain a smaller but intact version of the original
image. Unlike normal photographs, every part of a hologram contains all the
information possessed by the whole.

The "whole in every part" nature of a hologram provides us with an entirely
new way of understanding organization and order. For most of its history,
Western science has labored under the bias that the best way to understand a
physical phenomenon, whether a frog or an atom, is to dissect it and study
its respective parts.

A hologram teaches us that some things in the universe may not lend
themselves to this approach. If we try to take apart something constructed
holographically, we will not get the pieces of which it is made, we will
only get smaller wholes.

As the dear members know, the "Whole in every  Part" reality is not new to
Vedanta and this slokA is very interesting in this context

Poornamadha poornamidham poornAthPoornamudhachyathe;
poornasya poornamAdhAya poornamevA vashishyathe.

The Whole is all That. The Whole is all This. The Whole was born of the
Whole. taking the Whole from the Whole, what remains is the Whole.
