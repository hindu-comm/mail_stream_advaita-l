Ellam Ondre

Foreword

On another occasion, when I asked Bhagavan to select some reading
material for me, he gave me a short-list of six books: Kaivalya
Navanitam, Ribhu Gita, Ashtavakra Gita, Ellam Ondre, Swarupa Saram and
Yoga Vasishtam. He laid particular stress on Ellam Ondre, telling me,
"If you want moksha write, read and practise the instructions in Ellam
Ondre."
