Namaste.

I  was introduced to the Advaita  Philosophy by the book in Tamil by name
'Dheivathin Kural' ( Voice of God) which was edited / classified by Ra.
Ganpathy and which contains the talks of   Shri Chandrasekarendra Sarswathy
Swamigal of the Kanchi Math.
It was quite interesting.

I am eager to learn further about  Advaita from this list members.

Regards

K. Kameshwaran
