Greetings Jaldharji:

Namaskar,

I am one of the admirer of this list for its objective and noble cause. I
was a member before and left the list because of work load and other
committments. I am happy to be back and I intend  to share my knowledge on
Advaita and at the same time hope to learn from you all.

I have strong convictions to Hindu Culture and its traditions and I maintain
a homepage which is dedicated to Adi Sankaracharya.  The Wehsite address is
http://www.geocities.com/advaitins/

I am one of the moderators of another list on Advaita Philosophy with the
mailing address - advaitin at onelist.com and the archives are available at
http://www.eScribe.com/culture/advaitin.

Thanks for the opportunity to be a member of this list

Harih Om!

Ram Chandran
