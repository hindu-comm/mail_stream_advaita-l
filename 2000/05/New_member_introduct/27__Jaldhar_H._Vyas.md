"sarva vedAntha siDHAntham gocharam thama gocharam
shankaram paramAnandham shadgurum pranadhosmyaham"

  Prostrations to shrI Adi shankarA.
How else could one express his interest in advaita and Adi shankarA
than to quote shrI shankarA Himself

  "lokAnuwarthanam thyakthvA, thyakthvA dhehanuvarthanam,
   sAsthrAnuwarthanam thyakthvA, swADhyAsApanayam kuru"

Dear friends ,
I am Krishna Prasad, and from whatever little and minuscule that I learned
and studied with God's Grace I have firm conviction in advaitha as the most
scientific philosophy that explains the Absolute (unexplainable) from the
realms of mAyA.

I thank you all for the response and hope to join advaitha-l

Om Shanthi
