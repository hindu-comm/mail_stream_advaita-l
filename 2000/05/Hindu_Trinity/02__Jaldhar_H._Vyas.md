Note according to Samkhya/Yoga Hiranyagarbha is equated with Maharshi
Kapila who is the founder of that darshan.  In the Bhagavata Purana,
Kapila is also called an Avatar of Vishnu Bhagawan.

Evidently in those days there were Vedantins (or Yogins) who believed in
combining Jnana with the ritual worship and meditation of
Hiranyagarbha.  Perhaps this is another clue to the lack of Brahma-worship
nowadays?  It did not so much die out but was abstracted into an
unrecognizable form.
