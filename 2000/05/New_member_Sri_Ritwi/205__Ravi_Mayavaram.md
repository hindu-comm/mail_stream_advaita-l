Hi,

My name is Ritwik Bhattacharya, and I'm a PhD student in the dept of
Computer Science at the
University of Utah. My interest in advaita vedanta started from the time
I used to attend lectures
and courses of Chinmaya Mission, in the 10th grade. I have tried to read
some of the translations
of Shankaracharya's commentaries on the Upanishads done by Swami
Gambhirananda of Ramakrishna
Mission, as well as a translation of his commentaries on the Brahma
Sutras. My main aim in joining
this list is to understand these better from the others on the list.

Thank you

Ritwik
