Btw, such requests should go to listmaster at advaita-vedanta.org not to the
list itself.

If you need to temporarily stop receiving mail from the list you can send
a message to listserv at advaita-vedanta.org  with the words

SET NOMAIL ADVAITA-L

in the body and nothing else.  When you come back send a message with

SET MAIL ADVAITA_L

or

SET DIGEST ADVAITA-L

if you receive the digest.  You can read any messages you missed in the
interim in the list archives.

Please let Ravi, Vaidya or I know at listmaster at advaita-vedanta.org if you
need any help.
