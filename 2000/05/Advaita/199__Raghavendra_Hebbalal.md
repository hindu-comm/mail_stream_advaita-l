The idea of 1 occurs when there are 2 or more
(including the observer) and you refer to one of them.
However, in the paramArtha state, only Brahman is. So
Brahman does not 'see' anything apart from it. In fact
brahman 'sees' no thing. So the word advaita  which
refers to the paramArtha state attempts to describe a
state of non-multiplicity or non-difference.
On the other hand, ekatA, would refer to two entities,
the seer seeing the seen as one.
