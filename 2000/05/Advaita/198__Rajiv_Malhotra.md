Om.

Why is advaita called so ?  Why not ekata ?  The Rishis (and Shankara) seem
to use two different means of expression.  They say "ekam sat" and also say
"brahma advayam".  Is there a significance in the use of ekam (single) in
the first and advayam (non-dual) in the next.  Or are these different ? Or
are they mere appropriate choices for the meter in which they were
cognized/composed.

Om.

There is a difference between unity with Brahman and identity with Brahman.
Could that be reflected here?
