Om shAnthi;

mAyAmthu prakrithim viddhi;
mAyinamcha maheswaram
(Please help me where this quote is from)

srI sankarA in viveka Choodamani:

* YoyamAtmA swayamjyothi pancha-kosha vilakshanam..

* ATha: param bramha sadadvidhIyam..

So can we say, follow advaita as a means (of negating the dualisam and mAyA)
  and the end is ekatam ?

Om tat sat.
Krishna Prasad
