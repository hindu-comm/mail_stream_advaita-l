Advaita Vedanta cannot really be called an idealistic philosophy.  The
stuff of the universe is real but misunderstood.  So there is never a time
when there is nothing.  However that "something" isn't necessarily what we
think it is.

There is the concept of krama mukti.  Those who are almost at the door of
moksha will be released then it is the rest who will be "recycled."

The souls have no independent existence.  They are one and the same as
Brahman but deluded by Maya.  When the obstacle of Maya is removed they
disappear.  (Actually they were never there.)

Yes.

In the Anandamimamsa section of the Taittireyopanishad, a comparison of
the different lokas is made to the bliss of Brahman.  Insofar as one is
seperated from ones true nature it is Hell and to be nearer to it is
Heaven.

I think the latter.  Remember one of the names of Bhagawan is Padmanabha,
He whose navel contains a lotus.  Fro this lotus Brahma is born to do the
work of creation.

The fate of the soul depends on its' accumulated karma.  Moksha on the
other hand has nothing to do with karma.  Karma can in no way cause Moksha
but it can remove obstacles that prevent Moksha.  So non-performance of
the recuired vidhis can have a harmful effect.

That passage is describing the difference between those who perform
actions merely for selfish reasons or as an end in themselves (they will
go to pitraloka) and those who avoid selfish actions and only do the
obligatory ones as a sacrifice to God.  (They will join Bhagawan.)

The Gita Supersite at http://www.cse.iitk.ac.in/gita has many editions and
translations of the Gita including this.  Previously, list members have
also recommended the translation by Allady Mahadeva Shastry.

As for the Bhagavata Purana, I have a Gujarati translation which mainly
follows the Advaita interpretation and a Sanskrit commentary.  I don't
know about other languages.  Once in the library I saw a book called "The
Advaitic Theism of the Bhagavata Purana" by Daniel Sheridan.  But I
haven't read it so I can't tell you if it is any good.  I think it is a
scholarly study not a translation anyway.

One thing we hope to achieve with the e-documents project is to put as
many works of our Acharya (with translations) as possible on the web so
that those of us who do not have good access to libraries etc. can make
use of them.

Yes.

I know that around here the South Indian mandirs usually have big programs
to celebrate the occasion.  My opinion is that as this is not a shastrokta
utsava there is no need to fast etc. but we should all do something to
remember and respect our guru parampara.

Any question which is asked with a sincere desire to learn and a
willingness to accept the answer is a good one and you shouldn''t be
embarrassed to ask it.  How else can we learn and grow?

Yes please do this.  We will all benefit from hearing the words of such a
saint.  If you are going to quote long passages, please check to see if it
is still under copyright and if it is, try and get the permission of the
copyright holder.
