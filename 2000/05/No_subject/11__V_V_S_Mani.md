Dear respected, learned members of the advaita list,
My namaskarams to you all.

As I am planning to go to India tomorrow on a three week holiday, I would
like a temporary delisting till then,though I would like to read all the
mail when I come back, but I donot know what will happen to the capacity of
the pc if it will take it or jam it etc. I hope to be back in Sharjah on
June 21 st. My other email address is (if required) vvsmani at excite.com  or
vvsmani32 at hotmail.com.
Namaskarams,Seeking the Blessings of all the elders,
Mani.
