Dear list members,

Let us not put up with the nonsense and crap generated by Bhaskar any more. If he has such lowly opinion about Advaita and Shankara why does he ever write to this list?
His intentions are malicious. 
Let us not tolerate such comments on Acharya Shankara who can never be compared with Ramanuja or Ananda teertha or Chaitanya.
Also his audacity to call Shiva worshippers as atheists!!
Let Lord Shiva, ocean of compassion and mercy, forgive this hapless soul.

Jaya Jaya Sankara,

Anand
