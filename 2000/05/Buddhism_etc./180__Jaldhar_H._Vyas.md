Then Shruti must be an uncommon form of knowledge no?  At least it is some
form of knowledge.  The various types of nastikas are not prepared to
admit that.

...that is still around today.  This thread has come around full circle to
my original point that Advaita Vedanta is a lot older than we think.  In
fact as Advaitins we believe that there never was a time when the
knowledge of Advaita Vedanta was not known.

True.  Like rituals, logical reasoning cannot cause mukti, only remove the
impediments to it.

I partially agree with you.  You are describing the polemic side of
Advaita theory.  But there is also the expository side.  This side
describes what the goal of atmavichara is.  It is through this aspect of
theory that Advaita Vedanta become a practice.  The utility of Advaita
Vedanta is not just that it is a good theory but a good practical way to
achieve mukti.
