Greetings Advaita-L,

I come to you looking to further my understanding of the process of
liberation. Obviously there are many liberated beings, but how did that
happen? Perhaps more importantly, why does the same principles applied
by another _not_ result in liberation? I find Sri Sankara's approach
particularly attractive because it is based on the intellect. This is
certainly more accessible to many people, these days, than bakti, or the
discipline of meditation, or kundalini manifestations. But as you can
see, I have much to learn; so I look forward to reading your
deliberations.

Larry

I fully agree on  Ravis reply to Shri Bhaskar
   This list is to used by those for those who really
want to know about Advaita Philosophy and not to
propagate prabhupadas garbage about dvaita .
