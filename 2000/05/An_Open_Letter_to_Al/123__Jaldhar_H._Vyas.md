There is no problem with you sharing views which are against Advaita
Vedanta (it is more than capable of handling them) however some list
members have expressed concern about the disrespectful tone of some of
them.  I know in some cases you are quoting what other people have written
nevertheless please edit out inflammatory words that contribute nothing to
your argument.

Speaking of arguments, you are beginning to repeat yourself.  How about
responding to some of the replies you got instead of just saying the same
thing over and over again?

I'm going to rearrange parts of your post to show how ISKCONs hatred of
Advaita Vedanta overwhelms their reason.

Too bad.  The Brahma sutras are the basis of Vedanta.  We can't pick and
choose what to consider a shastra.

Oddly enough many people understand it just fine.  Perhaps the fault is in
the reader?

First it was too elaborate, now it is not elaborate enough.

Now it isn't a shastra at all.

In fact now we don't even believe in shastras.

Wait a minute yes we do.

No we don't again.

This is all over the place.  it's typical of someone who blinded by
emotion is unable to think coherently.

I'm responding to selected parts of the rest which haven't been covered
already.

But he did quote Vishnu Purana.  Other Advaita acharyas did comment on the
Bhagawata Purana.

This is patently untrue.  Smartas are as likely to wotship
Vishnu Bhagawan or Mataji as Shiva Bhagawan.  Perhaps Prabhupada got
confused because we use rudraksha mala and tripundra tilak just like
Shaivas but we are not Shaivas.  In fact Shaiva philosophers have
attempted to criticize Advaita just as much as Vaishavas have.

He also established Shiva lingas and Shri Chakras in many places.  You may
be right that Shankaracharya preferred the form of Vishnu Bhagawan but no
way can you claim he exclusively preferred it.

If Shankaracharya was born to mislead people why are you suddenly quoting
this verse as an authority?  Besides the translation is
wrong.  Shankaracharya was not criticizing Grammarians or intellectuals in
general but pedants.  They're not the same thing.  Vyakarana is a vedanga
you would not be able to understand one word of the shastras without
knowing "du krnya karane".

Maharshi Atri cursed Vishnu Bhagwan to be worshipped by the image
of His feet.  There are many Pauranika stories of Munis cursing someone or
the other.

In Bengal people of all theological stripes including Vaishnavas eat
meat.  In fact one person I knew seriously argued that fish should be
deemed vegetables.  Actually the shastras do not explicitly condemn
meat-eating this is a matter of shishtachara.
