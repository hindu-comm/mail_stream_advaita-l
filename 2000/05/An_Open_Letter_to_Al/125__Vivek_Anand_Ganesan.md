Hello :

  If this is not ISKCON propaganda, I don't know what is.

  Oh, really! I think not.  Believe me, I have heard myself
the abuse that ISKCON-ites heap on Bhagavatpada.  It was a
complete shock to me because until then I thougth that all
Hindus respected Adi Shakara ( huh, ISKCON-ites are not
hindus, after all ).  If their acharyas respected Adi
Shankara, how come the current ISKCON-ites do not?

  BTW, despite all this abuse and rhetoric hurled at
advaita
and Adi Shankara, the advaitins that I have encountered
have
not responded in kind.  That should tell you that who truly
understands the concept of dignity and respect.  No more of
such facetious lies, please.

-Vivek.
