Raghavendra Prabhuji and Ravi Prabhuji,

Sashtanga Pranam

I am very much interested in Advita philosophy thats why i am taking all these
pains to send these messages to U all.

I am really shocked to see your mesgs &  am not able to understand how you have
come to the conclusion that i am filling my mails with unworthy stuffs.  Do you
think my quotes from BG, Bhagavata and other Puranas are all full of
indoctrination??  Its really pains me a lot by hearing Raghavendra Prabhuji's
comment on my mail.  The decorum which i have used to  present my view may not
be polished in etiquette and submissiveness.  I beg to apologise for that  but
please note you cannot get away with it by simply saying its all propaganda of
ISCKON.   I have put-in lot of efforts to compile this data for which i think i
will get suitable point to point clarifications from my learned friends of
Advita-L.  and at the same time i dont  think any escapism is going to take
place by simply throwing all facts in thin air.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!

bhaskar
