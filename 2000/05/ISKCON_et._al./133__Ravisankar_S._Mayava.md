This is my request to shrI Bhaskar.

If you are sincerely interested in learning advaita-vedanta
and confused about it, please raise your doubts here.

On the other hand, if your intention is just to bash
advaita-vedanta and send propaganda information of ISKCON. I
should say please stop. Do not use this list for bashing shrii
shankara and his teachings.  To put it more strongly, please do
not litter this list with prabhupada's garbage.


Thank you.

Sincerely,

Ravi
