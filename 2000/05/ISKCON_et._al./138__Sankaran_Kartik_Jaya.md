Why don't you ask the ISKCON masters what they think of the obvious
mishandling of verse 7.18 of the BG by Prabhupada?

First, here's the verse with its translation by ChidbhavAnanda:

-----------
udArAH sarva evaite GYAnI tu atmaiva me matam.h .
asthitaH sa hi yuktAtma maaM evanuttamaM gatim.h ..

udArAH noble; sarve all; eva surely; ete these; GYAnI wise; tu but;
atmaa self; eva very; me my;matam opinion; asthitaH is established;saH he;
hi verily; yuktaatma steadfast-minded;maaM me;eva verily;
anuttamam the supreme; gatiM goal;

 "Noble indeed are all these; but the wise man, I deem to be My very Self.
  For steadfast in mind, he is established in Me alone as the supreme
  goal."
-----------

The meaning is quite clear, and leads directly to an advaitic
interpretation. Compare it with the contrived translation by Prabhupada:

-----------
udArAH--magnanimous; sarve--all; eva--certainly; ete--these; GYAnI--one
who is in knowledge; tu--but; atmaa eva- just like Myself; me--My;
mataM--opinion; asthitaH--situated; saH--he; hi--certainly;
yukta-atma--engaged in devotional service; maaM--in Me; eva--certainly;
anuttamam--the highest; gatiM--destination.

                                  TRANSLATION

All these devotees are undoubtedly magnanimous souls, but he who is
situated in knowledge of Me I consider to be just like My own self. Being
engaged in My transcendental service, he is sure to attain Me, the highest
and most perfect goal.
-----------

Where are the words that are translated as "just like my own Self"?
