The messages which you sent have been floating around on the internet
for quite sometime now. I have seen them about gazillion times, in
some form or the other in the now defunct srh and srv. You don't need
to rehash all that stuff here. We are *not* interested in seeing
ISKCON propoganda material. You can kindly stop taking the "pain" of
cutting and pasting ISKCON propoganda material. We certainly don't
want you to take such a huge effortof cutting and pasting  and tire
your forefinger.

If you are really interested in advaita ask some relevant questions.
As Jaldhar said, kindly summarize your objections to advaita in a
short post. Please spare us these long winded posts with no content. I
am also not interested in seeing insulting messages on Vivekananda or
Ramakrishna. Edit the objectionable parts. Please post links to
relevant articles if necessary.
