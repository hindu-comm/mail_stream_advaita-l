This verse is from the Vedastuti, a deeply philosophical part of the

This verse is a warning of the dangers of ego. If the Jivas thought they
were eternal, indestructible and pervaded all locations at all times, then
there would be no difference between them and Bhagawan.  Thus they would
have no need to follow His codes of conduct and He would not need to be
their Lord.  Unable to perform either good or bad karma, they would remain
helplessly mired in a static samsara.  But by acknowledging their inferior
nature relative to Bhagawan, they are able to look beyond their "self" and
recognize that the great qualities they thought they had pale in
significance to the lordly qualities of Bhagawan. The Shloka asks
rhetorically, "By the words 'this' and 'that' what have you learnt?"  The
answer is "nothing".  One can split hairs, "this is one thing,that is
another thing"  to finer and finer degrees but it will not bring one any
closer to understanding.  On further reflection it will occur to the jiva
that the attempt to know Brahman through measurement of its qualities is
futile.

At *this* point the jiva is ready to contemplate on and realize the "Self"
as indestructible, all-pervading, and of the nature of Truth, pure
Consciousness, and bliss.
