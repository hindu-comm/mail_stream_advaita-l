Aha that explains everything.  The language of the Vedas is not strictly
speaking Sanskrit.  Panini took the language of the various Vedic shakhas
along with the refined usage of the day and combined it along with his own
linguistic observations under the guidance of Shiva Bhagawan (from whose
damaru the samjna sutras which are foundation of vyakarana are said to
have flowed.)  This "polished" (sanskrit) language is thus in a sense
artificial and doesn't precisely match any of the "natural" (prakrit)
languages.   There are other vyakarana shastras but they all were eclipsed
by the monumental work of Panini and his successors.

Specifically Vedic usages are described in the vedanga called shiksha.
Iconographically Shiksha is portrayed as a goddess who carries a large
club to beat people who mispronounce the mantras. :-)  There are different
Shikshas for different shakhas written by different sages.  Panini himself
wrote the shiksha for the Rgveda.  The Yajnavalkya shiksha which we use in
the Shuklayajuraveda doesn't have that rule you mention.

Panini is said to have come from what is now the Pakistani part of
Punjab.  However he carefuly notes the usages of the learned in other
parts of the country as well as the vedic texts.  His scientific grasp of
linguistics was a stunning achievement unmatched until the 20th century.

This sounds very interesting please proceed at your leisure.  Also if the
Professor has access to email, kindly extend an invitation to join our
list.  I'm sure we would all benefit tremendously.
