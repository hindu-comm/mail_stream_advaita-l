shrii shrii chandrasekharendra sarasvatii in one of his talks (I think
Acharya Calls), mentions brahma and vahni is pronounced as bramha and
vanhi. These are exceptions.  Before reading this, I used wonder why
M.S.Sheela's(a very beautiful) rendering of lalitaa sahasranaama
pronounces the name as vanhimaNDalavaasinii.

But in that talk (if I remember correctly) he does not elaborate why.
