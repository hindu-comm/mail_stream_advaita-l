It might be interesting to read the chapters on Shiksha in the book Hindu
Dharma by Sri Chandrashekharendra Sarasvati, the late pontiff of Kanchi. IN
brief, he summarizes how the various languages that evolved in India were a
result of the methods for Vedic chanting in those areas i.e. how it was ok
in Vanga desh (Bengal) to replace "va" with "ba" and so forth. I am posting
the link for one specific chapter from the Shiksha section but it will
probably be better if one went throught the entire section.

ashish

p.s. IN north India, UP etc, we pronounce, and write, Sita as Sita but its
written as Sitha in the South. Is this how its written in the southern
languages as well?
