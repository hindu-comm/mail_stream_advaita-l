Is this the Vidyalankara Prof. S. K. Ramachandra Rao of Kalpatharu
Research Academy (in B'lore). He is a great scholar. I have seen some of
his books (on shaalagrama kosha, shrii vidya, and  shriisuuktam) . The
research quality of his works are very high. Do they have a web page?


Also thanks for explaining the basis of pronouncing brahma.
