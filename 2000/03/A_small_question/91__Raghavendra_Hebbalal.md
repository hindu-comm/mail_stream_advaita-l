Prof. Saligrama Krishna Ramachandra Rao is a great
scholar(an authority) in various fields of which some
are iconography, psychology, musicology, literature
and vedAnta (especially advaita vedanta). He has
authored several books in Kannada and English. One of
my favourite books in Kannada 'Shaaradaapeethada
MaaNikya' is a biography of Sri Chandrashekhara
Bharathi. He also regularly writes articles for
Shankarabhaaskara, a quarterly in Kannada solely
dedicated to discussing shAnkArAdvaita vedAnta. And
his lectures are just superb.
Is it possible for Smt. Latha Vidyaranya to invite him
to join our list ? We can benefit from his great
scholarship.
Thanks again for the sutra on pronouncing brahma.

Raghavendra.
