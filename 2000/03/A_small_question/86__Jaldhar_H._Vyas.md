The modern Indian languages have diverged slightly from Sanskrit
pronounciation.  E.g. Bengalis say b instead of v, Gujaratis drop a at the
end of a syllable etc.  'bramha' is probably like this.  But the correct
Sanskrit pronounciation is brahma with a hma.

Paninis' grammar doesn't but later grammatical works often include
an appendix with extra sutras to convert from Prakrit to Sanskrit.
