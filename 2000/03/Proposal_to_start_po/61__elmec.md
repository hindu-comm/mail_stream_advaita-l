Hari Om,

I would suggest Sri Aashish to take up " Prabhodha Sudhaakara " which is
a small
prakarana grantha by Aacharya Sri Shankara. Recently I was reading its
translation in Kannada and I liked few of the shlokas so much that I
have marked
them and kept it for future reference. The language is very simple and
it should
interest readers of all levels.

Also, now that a discussion is going on on Jivan mukti, a small work
with very
serious import is the " Aatma vidyaa vilaasa " by H.H.Sri Sadashiva
Brahmendra
Saraswathi in which he has described the state of a jivan mukta very
well. It
contains 62 shlokas.

Regards,
Latha Vidyaranya
