shrii raama navami is on April 12th. Depending on which part of the globe
the date may vary. It is often said that shrii raama is the embodiment of
dharma. May HE guide us to the right thing we should  do.  I take this
opportunity to invite the members to discuss devotional articles on raama.

raama naamame naamamaayiram
(The name raama is equivalent to 1000 names)
