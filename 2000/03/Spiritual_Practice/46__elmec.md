The practice which has helped me most is chanting of simple stotras
which one
can learn by heart. Instead of simply learning it by rote if one can
understand the meaning and chant it, all the more effective it will be.
You
can say it aloud or chant it silently while doing the daily kitchen
chores.
Singing stotras while cooking adds extra flavour to the food and the
food when
consumed by the family definitely helps to build purer thoughts in their
minds. " Annaath manaha ". Previously whenever there were occasions of
missing
the daily japa because of extra work in the kitchen I used to get very
agitated. Now by God's grace I have matured into a more peaceful person
and I
firmly believe in the words " yat yat karma karomi tattadakhilam Shambho
tavaaraadhanam ". This strong belief helps one to tide over the trivial
agitations of the mind and helps one to do even the mundane work with
extra
enthusiasm.
