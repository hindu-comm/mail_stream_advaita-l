Sri Bharati Teertha Swamiji suggested the same when we visited Sringeri last
time.

For people who work on computers, you can plug in a CD and use ear phones too.

Or better yet, you can download music files from Ammachi site or from
Arunachala Ashrama on the web. With Real player and a set of ear phones you
can listen all day. It is great relaxation too!.

Sivaratri is tommorrow - the most auspicious night of the year. I am glad it
is again on the weekend.  Hope to spend the night in the local Siva VishNu
temple, with all night of Rudra - Chamaka and Lalitha SahasranAma.

Aum namah sivAya,

Savithri
