 Yes, but in the ultimate analysis advaita has to reject all categories
 except Brahman or sat, together with the pramANas. It is only in
 empirical matters that advaita agrees with the bhATTas.

 This is a very good question. We should bear in mind here that
 MadhusUdana is basically answering the question: What is the
 ontological status of the negation of the world? Is it absolutely
 real, empirically real or illusory? In answering this question,
 we should also bear in mind that negation of the world is a
 complex, consisting of two parts - a real part that is non-different
 from Brahman, and an empirically real part that has the same status
 of reality as the world. So MadhusUdana's answer to the question
 will be in two parts! In the first part, MadhusUdana shows how the
 negation can be treated as identical with Brahman, the substratum. In
 this case, it so happens that it agrees with the negation concept of
 the PrAbhAkaras. But bear in mind that the PrAbhAkaras will never
 use their concept of negation to prove the world is unreal. And
 we will see in the next part of MadhusUdana's reply that the negation
 of the world can also be viewed as empirical. That would satisfy the
 naiyAyikas, bhATTas, and others who hold that negation has to be different
 from the substratum.

 On this issue, it is clear the advaitin cannot take sides either with
 the MAdhvas, naiyAyikas or bhaTTas who say negation is a category by
 itself, nor with the PrAbhAkaras who say there is no category for
 negation and that negation is nondifferent from the substratum.
 Again, this is because the negation at hand is a complex one.
 In strictly empiricial matters, the advaitin's position agrees with
 the bhATTas who say that negation or absence is a separate category
 and is known through anupalabdhi, a separate pramANa.

 Again, the position of the advaitin on this particular issue of
 negation of the world matches (in the first part) with the PrAbhAkara's
 position.

  I believe it is my mistake too for not giving a brief recap
of the arguments so far. MadhusUdana started by accepting the definition
of unreality (of the world) as "pratipanna-upAdhau traikAlikanishhedha-
pratiyogitvam.h" (please see advaita-siddhi 10). Unreality is that
which is subject to absolute negation in the substratum where it is
cognized. So the opponent asks: OK. Now, how do classify this absolute
negation that you speak of? Is this absolute negation pAramArthika,
vyAvahArika or prAtibhAsika? This is what MadhusUdana is answering here.
He is not, at this point, showing the illusory nature of the world
using the silver-nacre example.

 Let me explain by giving meanings of specific phrases in the text.
 Then it should be clear. prapaJNchanishhedha - negation of the world,
 adhikaraNIbhUta-brahma - Brahman which is the substratum of (the
 negation of the world), abhinnatvAt.h - due to being non-different from,
 nishhedhasya tAtvikatve .api - even if the negation is (absolutely)
 real (pAramArthika), na-advaitahAnikaratvam.h - it does no harm to
 advaita (non-duality), na cha - And there is no, tAtvikAbhAva-
 pratiyoginaH - of the counter-positive (pratiyogin) of the real
 negation (ie.) , prapaJNchasya - of the world,  tAtvikApattiH -
 conclusion that it is real, tAtvikAbhAva-pratiyogini - in the
 counter-positive of the real negation, shukti-rajatAdau - in such cases
 as silver-in-nacre, kalpite- in illusions (literally imaginations),
 vyabhichArAt.h - due to the exception.

 vyabhichAra, as per nyAya terminolgy, is specifically the case where
 a paxa (subject) has the hetu (reason) but not the thing to be inferred
 (sAdhya). For example, if we are trying to come up with a rule that says
 "where there is fire there is smoke" then a case where a paxa (say a
 brightly burning incandescent electric bulb) has the reason (fire or flame)
 but there is no smoke (the thing to be inferred or sAdhya), becomes the
 "rule-breaker" or vyabhichAra. When this happens, we can no longer
 call the rule valid.

 Please go through the series at your convenience. The third part
 deals with the nyAya terminology and concepts that keep recurring
 in the arguments. One needs to be aware of some peculiarities of
 nyAya concepts. For example, a negation is always said to be of
 an object or attribute that is in a locus (substratum). nyAya does
 not allow negations of arbitrary things. The way to get around this
 is to formulate a negation as that of something in a subtratum, even
 though the thing being negated and the substratum do not necessarily
 have to have a physical "contained-container" relationship or occur
 as a thing physically on top of a substratum. When we say the world is
 negated in Brahman we do not mean that the world physically inside
 Brahman or the world physically on top of Brahman, the substratum, is
 negated! Such idiosyncrasies tend to increase in the case of navya-nyAya
 which highly formalized the concepts of the old school.
