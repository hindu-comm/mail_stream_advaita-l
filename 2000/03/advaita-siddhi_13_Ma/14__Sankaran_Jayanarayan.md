This posting has a small dose of western philosophy, which I studied for
my personal awareness and a comparitive study with advaita. So for those
who wouldn't find it interesting, it's a good idea to skip this post.

These are the same arguments given by a pre-Socratic Greek philosopher,
Parminedes, approximately 1200 years before Shankara!

Here's the basic structure of his argument:
"Everything" signifies "Everything that exists."  The fundamental
ingredient that goes into the making of everything is the substance
called "Being." Therefore everything is "constructed" of "Being."
Can there be anything that doesn't consist of Being, or consists of
non-Being? Clearly, no.

This leads to the conclusion: "There is only One (Being) that appears as
the many (forms)." (compare it with Brahman=sat, nAmarUpa=mAyA in advaita)

There are other similarities between Parminedes and advaita. Parminedes
goes on to show how Being always remains a constant, and that change is an
illusion. Paul Deussen was the first, I believe, to note the similarities
between the philosophies of Parminedes and Shankara.
