One can only marvel at the compassion that moves the wise to expound

Ah!  You have taken the prAbhAkara position to avoid the pitfall of
assuming a second "reality" (category or pramANa) in demonstrating the
pAramArthika aspect of negation. OK, I follow.

I found that word-by-word translation particularly helpful in mediating
between the Sanskrit and English.  Perhaps you would consider including
it in subsequent posts (at least for MadhusUdana's text) ?

Part three (or four) did not mention vyabhicAra :-(

You had earlier suggested Ingalls's "Materials for the Study of Navya
Nyaya Logic" -- I see that it is available from Amazon at $14.00.
I shall invest in a copy in order to better follow the argument.

Thanks for so generously clarifying and enlarging on your explanation
of MadhusUdana's argument.  I look forward to the ongoing series.

Regards, Charles.
