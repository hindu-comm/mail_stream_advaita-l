 I would recommend (the late) Prof. Ingalls' book without hesitation.
 If I remember correctly, he is said to have studied nyAya in a traditional
 way under a scholar called kAlIpAda tarkAchArya of Calcutta.
 Years ago, it was Ingalls' book that helped me understand the intricacies
 of navya nyAya. During those days I was rather crazy about the field
 of Knowledge Representation in Arificial Intelligence. What quickly
 caught my attention was the emphasis on formalization of nyAya
 terminology and language in navya nyAya. I dreamed up a scheme of
 machine representation of the navya nyAya formalization that lends itself
 to highly parallel (meaning efficient) inference, and presented
 the same in a conference on Parallel Processing in Pune, India.
