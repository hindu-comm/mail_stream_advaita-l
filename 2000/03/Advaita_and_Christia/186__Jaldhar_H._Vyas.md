If truth is unapproachable then there is no truth.  The consequences of
such a line of thinking are hideous.

Yes, and while we might not like to think about it, Hinduism has not been
immune to this.  But for the love of those images much good has been done
in the world too, far more good than bad.  Let's remember that too.

If moksha is random than what guarantee do we have that it will ever come?

As late as the '60s smart people were ready to declare the end of
religion particularly the orthodox kinds.  This forecast has proven
spectacularly wrong because let's face it fundamentalism works.  It meets
the totality of human needs much better than its competitors.  Yes it has
brought strife but it has also fought injustice (cf. the famous Christian
fanatic Martin Luther King) and brought people together.

Advaita Vedanta is not literalist (The Mimamsaka rules of interpretation
are more complicated that.) but it is fundamentalist.  I would say it's
basic assumptions are as follows.

1.  The present state of being we find ourselves in is not good.  (i.e. it
    is full of suffering etc.)

2.  It is possible to transcend that state of being to a better one.

3.  Advaita Vedanta is the method to transcend that state.

There room for doubt with all three steps.  You may be happy with life as
is.  You may not agree Advaita Vedanta is the right method. But if you
accept these assumptions then there is no doubt.  But you have
automatically placed yourself apart from all those who doubt.  You are a
fundamentalist.  However whether not you then become intolerant is up to
you.  If Advaita Vedanta has been less intolerant it is not because the
potential isn't there because it places great emphasis on being aware of
ones thoughts and keeping them in control.
