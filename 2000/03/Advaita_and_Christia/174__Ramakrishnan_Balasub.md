They sound very interesting.

In case anyone thought I was trying to be pedantic, I was trying to
illustrate a point, namely, the subjective nature of which religions
come under the "great religions" banner. To some it may be obvious, to
me it only seems subjective. Note I am not denying Christianity as a
great religion, but the concept of great religions is neccessarily
subjective. Oldtimers on this list may remember that sometime back
someone even posted some sayings by some sundry rock stars and
wondered whether they too were advaitins!  With rock musicians treated
like Gods, perhaps that is not very surprising. 20th century Agama-s
perhaps :-).

The discussion has been very interesting. I am not sure if you feel
otherwise (your statement above seems to indicate that). No doubt
there might have been "non-dual" insights in many religions. That
should not be surprising or cannot be disputed because advaita-siddhi
cannot be restricted to people of a certain time or place. The
question is whether there is any other religion which has the same
conclusion such as "jagat mithyA". Even such a non-dualistic system as
Kashmir Shaivism argue and controvert advaita on this point. "Oneness"
with the deity is more common. Again, as I said undividedness applies
only to brahman and cannot be carried over to empirical things like
systems of philosophies. That need not lead to strife necessarily. In
any case thanks once again for the references.
