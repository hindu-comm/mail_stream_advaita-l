In the words of Swami Vivekananda , 'Religion is the manifestation of the divinity already within  man"  or "Religion is Realization".  "Do this by philosophy, devotion , work or psychical control and be free".
The whole emphasis of any religion is this "Be free!" and that means dissolve all your presumptions, qualifications everything, even your individuality.
In this aspect every religion that has guided atleast one sincere seeker to the goal is true.

Whether the world was declared true by one teacher or not by another teacher is determined by who they are teaching. However the essentials of the religion will be the same.
When the soul feels the cry from within for liberation, when no amount of self effort is able to break the bonds of illusion, the only true religion is this,
"Renounce all formal religions and surrender on to me.
  I will free thee from all sins, grieve not !"
                                                                            Bhagavad Gita Chapter 18.

Christ said the same thing,

" Come on to me all those who labour and I will give thee rest".


Om,
        Anand
