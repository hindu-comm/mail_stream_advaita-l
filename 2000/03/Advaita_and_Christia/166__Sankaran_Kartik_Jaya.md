The words "GYAna" (Sanskrit), "Gnosis" (greek), "gnosko" (Latin), "know"
(English), "kennen" (German), etc. are all related, being words of
Indo-European origin.

But the word "gnosis" in Greek philosophy doesn't have anything to do with
mystical realization, in the advaitic sense or otherwise. It's simply a
referent to knowledge in the philosophical context.

This is most probably not accurate. There are stories about Plato, Jesus,
etc. visiting India to learn philosophy/religion, and not one of them is
taken seriously by historians.

Interesting! What's the name of this movie?

You can consult dictionary.com, a pretty good resource.

AFAIK, the word "dharma" means "to hold firm" and has its counterpart in
the Latin "firmus." Whereas the word "Dogma" is derived from "Dek" meaning
"to accept." I don't think they are related.

"Kerygma" means "to preach" -- not sure how it can be connected to Karma.
