Hello :
  I have been wondering about this for a while. I would
like
to learn more.  I have given a few bits of knowledge that
I have culled.  Any corrections and/or comments are
welcome.

I. Gnosis and Pistis
--------------------
  Since Early Christian theology was mostly influenced by
Greek philosophy most Christian terms are Greek.  I have
specifically come across two that have caught my attention.
Gnosis = Realization = Jnana ( Is it so? )
Pistis = Faith ( I don't know the Sanskrit equivalent ).
It is possible that there was some Indian influence on
Greek
philosophy, especially since Pythogras had studied in
India.
  Only recently did I learn about the Gnostic school of
Christianity ( from a Hollywood movie, no less ).  It seems
that this school was quite popular in the early days but
was
later persecuted by the doyens of orthodoxy.  They
emphasize
inner-realization ( Gnosis ).It also seems that a papal
bull
was passed that outlawed Gnosis and established only
pistis.

II. Dogma and Kerygma
---------------------
  These are two more terms which might have some
commonality
with Indian thought.  Specifically, Is
  Dogma = Dharma and Kerygma = Karma?

Thanks in advance,

-Vivek.
