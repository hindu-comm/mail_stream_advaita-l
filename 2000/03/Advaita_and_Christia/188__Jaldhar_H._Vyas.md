By the way if list members are not interested in the current topics of
discussion, they should feel free to start up another one (providing it
deals with Advaita Vedanta of course.)  You needn't wait for permission or
anything.

Bhakti is not necessarily just for the unready. Swami Madhusudana
Saraswati is an example of an Advaita luminary who upheld the highest
ideals of the jnana marga and was an ardent bhakta of Krshna Bhagawan too.
Yet despite that he also wrote a work called ratnatrayapariksha which
aimed to show that Shiva, Vishnu, and Devi are one.  That's the Advaita
ideal of Bhakti.
