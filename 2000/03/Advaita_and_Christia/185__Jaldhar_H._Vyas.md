Then perhaps you are right but I question how useful such a comparison
is.  Even before I knew anything about Indian philosophy in a formal
sense, I had the feeling that it is not so much about what to believe (or
not believe) but what to _do_ (or not do).  I call this a dharmic view of
life as opposed to a "spiritual" one.  Such a view entails looking at a
given text not just from the philosophical point of view (although that is
certainly important) but from a historical and sociological perspective
too.  If this is the way we look at say the Gita, it is only fair that it
is the way we look at the Bible.

That's a question:  Should we accept his views on the Bible?

The reason is because as Christians go Catholic and Protestant Christians
outnumber the Osbornes of the world 100,000 to 1.  If we truly belive in
tolerance than we cannot simply dismiss the views of so many people as not
relevant.  Instead we should take them seriously even if we wind up
disagreeing with them.

That just opens up another discussion.  If as you are saying Ramana
doesn't represent the views of Advaita Vedanta (and other people on this
list would disagree with that) then we need to examine what his views are
and how valid they are.
