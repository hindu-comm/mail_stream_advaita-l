There was a Catholic priest who made similiar statements (in the context
of Buddhism, he was Shri Lankan I  believe but I forgot his name) and was
excommunicated.  So it is very interesting to hear of things like
this.  However at the moment it is just fine rhetoric.  When Christians
start putting murtis of Krshna Bhagawan in their churches then it will
mean something.  Until then it is just appropriation, a form of cultural
imperialism.

If Hindus do this it is nothing to be proud of either.
