I am glad you agree on this point. There are many people who sidestep
this issue.

Realization of the self is *not* restricted to anyone. Sha.nkara makes
it clear that people outseide the varNAshrama dharma can also achieve
self-realization. The issue here is whether any philosophical system
other than advaita (say X) accepts the tenets brahma satya, jagat.h
mithyA, jivo brahmaiva na paraH and how they come to this conclusion.

Perhaps. A flat earth theorist may claim with absolute certainty that
the earth is flat. That doesn't make the earth not-a-sphere nor
invalidate the claim of the earth-is-a-sphere theorist. Just because a
1000 people claim validity for incorrect systems does not invalidate
the claims of the one system which is correct. Whether advaita is even
this one correct system is not really the point here.

But that hardly makes any sense. The compilers of the Agamas who were
at least as advanced as Ramakrishna (if not more) prohibit such things
as pointing the feet towards the statues. Surely it's not your
contention that they got these rules out of their hats? Of course for
a very advanced spiritual aspirant God's presence may be visible
everywhere, but for the run of the mill person these rules hold and
it's the duty of priests to point it out. But, I don't see a
connection between this and a comparative analysis of advaita and
other systems.

Heavens gate cult. I claim eschatological properties of UFOs have no
connection with advaita.

As I said, individual experiences of the advaita tattva is not
restricted based on place or time. I don't think Anand was questioning
that either. But as Anand correctly pointed out, there is no use
taking up one or two points of some religion and saying it is the same
as advaita.

Undividedness is only in brahman and not on individual philosophical
systems which are a result of avidyA :-).
