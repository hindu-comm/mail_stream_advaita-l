You are right. But it is not very easy to reach that
level of understanding, where spirituality tends to
become a choice more than a sacrifice.

I agree again. True viveka is not very easy to come
by. Through satsanga and study of scriptures,one can
come to an understanding that spirituality is 'better'
than materialism. But, for the bookish understanding
to rise to the level of viveka, there is a struggle
involved.

There is bound to be some pain during a struggle. Only
when one stops feeling the 'pain', does one come to
know that viveka in oneself has matured.
