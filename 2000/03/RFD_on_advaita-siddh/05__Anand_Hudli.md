 Please note that I put "sacrifice" in quotes in my message.
 It is not a sacrifice that causes pain but should cause
 happiness because one is convinced that one is making the
 right choice.  Also, I do not agree that any sacrifice
 (without quotes) comes with pain.

 If we take sacrifice to mean sacrifice as in the Vedas,
 there are many sacrifices that do not involve pain such as
 that resulting from killing animals. A sacrifice is like
 giving up something for someone or for the ultimate good.
 As long as the sacrifice is for a higher purpose I don't
 see why it should necessarily cause pain.
