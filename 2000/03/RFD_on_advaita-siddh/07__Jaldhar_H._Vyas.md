Think of it this way.  The jiva has had to endure hundreds of lives as
plants or animals in which it it suffered indignities such as being
trodden on or eaten.  Perhaps at some point it managed to achieve a human
birth but sqaundered it on frivolous activities.  Finally at long last
you've been in the position to hear the Vedantic teaching.  There may be
trials and tribulations ahead but they pale in comparison with what you've
already achieved.

I think what people should honestly ask themselves is "Am I making
progress?  Is my knowledge and practice better today than it was a month
ago? six months ago?  A year ago?"  If they can answer yes, there is
forward movement, It doesn't matter if the pace is slower or faster than
other peoples.  If they can't honestly answer yes then they need to make
a sober reassessment of their priorities.
