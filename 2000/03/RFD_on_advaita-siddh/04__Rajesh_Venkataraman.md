Will it be better if we don't choose spirituality in
favor of material wealth with the idea of
"sacrificing" something? Sacrifice generally is a
selection between choices which are equal or atleast
close to each other in the level of importance. Also
by sacrificing one of the choices one gets a certain
amount of pain.

Here, for a true viveki material prosperity is at best
an aid and spiritual pursuit is far ahead in his
priority list and he should not be pained to sacrifice
a little bit of material well being! So, where is the
question of sacrifice? If still there is a certain
amount of pain, the viveka is not strong enough, is it
not?
