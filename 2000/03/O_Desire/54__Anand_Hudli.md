 True, the world is more global than before. But that does not change
 anything at all as far as the core principles of dharma are concerned.
 The argument that people can follow any life-style they want and still
 achieve vairAgya leads us back to the Householder vs. sannyAsin issue
 which has been quite vigorously debated in the past on this list.
 Shankara has quite clearly stated in his VivekachUDAmaNi that one
 who strives both for material prosperity and spiritual realization
 is attempting to cross a river by catching hold of the tail of a
 crocodile! One cannot have both at the same time. One can have
 material prosperity for some time. But at some stage, he has to
 be able to say "Enough is enough. Desire can never be quenched."
 That is when he should turn to vairAgya.

 Note also, the verse from BhartR^ihari's does not talk about just foreign
 travel but about any travel one may do in search of a "comfortable life."
 That "comfortable life" often comes at a cost that is often not
 discussed in social circles. Only the glamorous aspects tend to get
 highlighted. But each individual who goes through the adventure of winning
 the "comfortable life" should know in his/her own heart that he/she is
 paying a price for this.
