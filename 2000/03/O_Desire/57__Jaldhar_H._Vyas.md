When there were gatherings of Brahmans the custom was (and still is) that
they would take it in turns to recite some shlokas while the others ate in
silence.

This is called pranagnihotra.  Agni in the form of Vaishwanara is the
digestive process so eating is considered equivalent to Agnihotra.

Something I've found handy when needing to eat in a strange place is to to
a restaurant that follows the Jewish rules on diet (Kosher.)  One of the
laws of the Jewish religion is that meat cannot be mixed with milk
products.  So if a restaurant advertises itself as Kosher dairy (They will
have a certificate from a Rabbi on the premises attesting to this) you can
be sure that no meat products are in use.
