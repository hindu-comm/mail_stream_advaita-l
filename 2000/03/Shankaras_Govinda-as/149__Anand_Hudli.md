 Yashodaa said to the child Krishna, " You are eating mud here."
 Govinda (Krishna) displayed fear of being beaten by her, just like
 a child. (In order to prove that He had not eaten mud) He opened His
 mouth to reveal the wonderful panorama of the lokaaloka mountain
 (which separates the visible from the invisible) together with the
 fourteen worlds. He is the foundation of the city of the three worlds
 (ie. the universe). He is the lustre or the brilliance of the universe,
 even though He is beyond the reach of vision. He is the Lord of the
 worlds, the Highest Lord. Offer obeisances to Govinda, the Supreme Bliss.

 It is wonderful that Govinda Himself displays fear. For, everyone else
 fears Him. Says the taittiriiya upaniShad :

   bhiishhaa .asmaadvaataH pavate| bhiishhodeti suuryaH |
   bhiishhaa .asmaadagnishchendrashcha |
   mR^ityurdhaavati paJNchama iti ||


 Out of fear of Him (Brahman) the wind blows. Out of fear of
 Him does the sun rise. Out of fear of Him do Agni (Fire), Indra,
 and Death, the fifth, run (function).

 These deities, though formidably powerful and lordly in themselves,
 undertake activities involving great effort, such as blowing, producing
 heat, rain, etc. Thus, Shankara says, it is reasonable to conclude that
 the deities function as they do out of fear of Him and under His control.

 And what is this Brahman? It is  Bliss , as the immediately succeeding
 text in the upanishhad says (in the Ananda miimaaMsaa portion).
 Govinda is this Bliss.
