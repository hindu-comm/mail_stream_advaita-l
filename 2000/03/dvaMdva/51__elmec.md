Thanks to Sri Shankar Jayanarayan for taking trouble to quote from Sri
Vishnu
Puraana the passage in which there is a very clear description of  how
both
the good and the evil are  but  manifestation of the same Brahman.

This makes it clear that those in whom we see an excess of evil
disposition
have only been born to expiate the bad deeds done in a previous birth
and
those in whom we see very divine disposition are born to expiate the
good
karma phala of a previous birth. Therefore we should not outrightly
condemn a
person as bad as his nature may be beyond his own control. We should be
sympathetic and even empathetic with such a person to help him overcome
those
negative qualities (Rajas and Tamas) by constantly exposing him to the
positive aspects (Sattva) of life and slowly wean him away  from those
evil
tendencies. This definitely requires Ishwara's grace upon that person.
We
ourselves can pray God on his behalf to show him the right path.

Regards,
Hari Om,
Latha Vidyaranya
