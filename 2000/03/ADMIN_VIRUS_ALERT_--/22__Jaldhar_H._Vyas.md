A message posted earlier today contained the happy99 virus.  Delete the
message which has the attachment happy99.exe immediately.  Do not open it
or click on it under any circumstance.

If you did inadvertantly execute this file go to:

http://www.symantec.com/avcenter/venc/data/fix.happy99.worm.html

to download a tool to fix it.  Do not send any email until then or you
will infect others!

This virus only affects Windows 95/98/NT users.  People using Unix, Macs
or web based email will not be affected but should delete the message
anyway.

(Before any gets cross with Mrs. Vidyaranya, this is a highly insidious
virus that can be spread unknowingly so it is probably not her fault.)
