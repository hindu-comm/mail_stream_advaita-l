--------------------

Your message to me of 08:41 PM 03/02/2000 +0500 arrived twice. The
second version contained the "Happy99.exe" worm virus attachment.

It has now infected the systems of everyone who received that post and
opened the attachment.

It causes one's e-mail program to send out duplicate messages contain-
ing the attachment to everyone to whom you post.

You must delete this worm and all of its elements from your system
immediately -- and notify all list members not to open the attachment
"Happy/99.exe".

For instructions for yourself and your list members go to:
