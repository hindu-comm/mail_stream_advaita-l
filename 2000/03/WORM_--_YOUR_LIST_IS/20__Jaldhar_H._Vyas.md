Thanks for the warning, I just sent out an alert too.

Let me emphasise that it is only Windows users who have opened the
attachment who are infected.  So there is no need to panic but the
message should be immediately deleted and the symantec tool run just to be
on the safe side.

I have deleted that message from the archives so people reading the
digest version of this list will not have this problem.
