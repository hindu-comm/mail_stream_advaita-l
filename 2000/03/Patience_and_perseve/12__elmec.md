I totally agree with Sri Anand's view of making life simple and get more time
for spirituality. But here is a hitch. If both husband and wife have similar
interest in vedaanta, they both will go for a less complicated life and hence
more contentment and more leisure to pursue their vedaantic interest. This sort
of interest in both the spouses is purely by divine grace. If on the other hand,
one has spiritual interests and other has materialistic interests, the spiritual
one has to make sacrifice of her/his interest in order to maintain peace in the
family. It is very hard to make a materialistically oriented spouse to
understand the abstract interest of the other. And if that spouse were to be
from a family where there was no religious interests also, God only should save
our friend. But, my friend, take heart, dont despair. If one has genuine
interest in vedaanta, then God will definitely create an opportunity to pursue
that interest somehow. Patience and perseverance one should have in this matter.
And no outward show of vairaagya is advised for a house holder in the interest
of marital harmony. We should firmly believe that it is God's will that  I
should play the role of a house holder and we should play the role to  the best
of our capacity in order to please Ishwara so that He may give us promotion soon
! We must have that vairaagya hidden in our antahkarana and we should believe
that looking after the husband and children are the foremost responsibility that
Ishwara has vested upon us. If we carry out this to His satisfaction, one day or
the other He will definitely release us from all these bondages - "
oorvaarukamiva bandhanaath mukshiiya "- should be our prayer to Him. As the
cucumber waits patiently to get ripened and get released from the creeper, so
should we patiently wait for our antahkarana to reach that stage of ripening
when Ishwara Himself will  release us and allow us to tread the jnaana maarga.

Hari Om,
