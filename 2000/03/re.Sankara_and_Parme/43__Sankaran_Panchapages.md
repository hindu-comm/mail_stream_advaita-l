Hi Karthik & others,
        I remember there was question about the relation between
Sankaracharya and Parmenides on the Indology list:

http://www.ucl.ac.uk/~ucgadkw/indology.html

Go to the search page and search for Parmenides, the results are very
interesting. Some people give references to specific articles comparing
Sankara and Parmenides, also Uddaalaka (Aruni) and Parmenides. Another
post discusses the philosophy of Parmenides, which seems to be basically
non-dualism.

Regards,
Ganesh.
