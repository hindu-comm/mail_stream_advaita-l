C. Rajagopalachari, in his translation of the Ramayana, gives the allegory
of Sita waiting for Rama as the bhakta waiting for the Ishvara. The bhakta
only needs to sit quietly and wait for the Ishvara to grant mukti.

Thanks for the info. I understand that Panchaayatana pooja is a method
of worship that one adopts at Nitya pooja at home.

But this shaNmatha is still giving me problem. Why did shankara
institute them ? Are the shaiva, vaishnava of these shaNmathas same as
shaivism, vaishnavism etc ? As I understand, shaivites usually follow
the advaita philosophy, vaishnavites follow dvaita philosophy and
srivaishnavites follow vishishtaadvaita. In what way are they different
from the shaNmathas established by shankara ? My confusion is worsening.
Kindly help !

Hari Om,
Latha Vidyaranya
