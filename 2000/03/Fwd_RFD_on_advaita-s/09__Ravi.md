I concur with you a 100%.  Otherwise, I wouldn't be working for
the same company (3 miles from home) for the past 11 years.  Not
working is not an option for me, tried that and went crazy.  As
someone recently mentioned on the list - a brain is a terrible
thing to waste.

Also, I am not sure that one can progress spiritually if one has
more time. How driven you are and your position in life are some
factors among a lot of others.

Life offers several choices every second - it is certainly wise
to keep in focus the more important goals in mind

Thanks,
Savithri
