Hello Deepak,

Since I also live in the Garden State, my suggestion is that you join a
study group at one of the local vedanta organizations. Textual studies alone
can take too long, become very dry, etc. Two come to mind. Arsha Vidya in
the Pocono mountains and Chinmaya Mission with chapters I many parts of NJ.
Please feel free to email directly to me in case you want to be referred.
But since you want an intro book, try ATMA BODHA (only 100 pages), whose
English translation is available from Chinmaya Mission.

Rajiv Malhotra
