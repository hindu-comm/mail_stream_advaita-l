As I said as much in the first part of this series, my feeble attempt
here is only to scratch the surface of the ocean that is advaita-siddhi.
It will take months, if not years, of full-time study to really
understand the depths of this work. Here, we are only scratching the
surface, just a little bit. It has been said that the
nyAyAmR^ita-advaitasiddhi debate is one of the finest that one will ever
see in the history of Indian philosophy to date. This makes a compelling
reason for us to study the advaita-siddhi.

 Yes. It means the bondage is not real. And the act of freeing oneself
 from the bondage is also not real, because there was no bondage to
 begin with. Let us say you have a dream in which you are sick and then,
 in the same dream, you may dream that you become cured of the sickness.
 Both the sickness in the dream and the cure in the dream are not
 real. Similar is the situation of the jIva, except that upon being
 cured of the "dream" sickness, the jIva "wakes up."

 The delusion or bondage is caused by avidyA or mAyA. And this mAyA
 is itself anirvachanIyA, meaning it cannot be classified as real or
 unreal. First of all, nobody can deny that there is bondage or sorrow
 in the empirical life. Suppose the delusion or bondage has been caused
 by a reality called God. Then one may argue that God has put us into this
 bondage because it was His intention to do so. So the conclusion can be
 drawn: we are not supposed to get rid of this bondage, because doing so
 would be going against the will of God. A desire for liberation should
 never arise. We should simply accept that we will be eternally bound.The
 argument that God put us in bondage because He wants us to liberate
 ourselves does not make much sense because we can ask: why did He put us
 in bondage in the first place? So a plausible conclusion is to accept the
 bondage that God has made for us. Obviously, this is a wrong conclusion
 because almost all systems in India emphasize that liberation is the
 ultimate goal of life. Now, if the conclusion is wrong, there must be
 something wrong in the premises on which the conclusion was based. And
 what was the premise? That the cause of bondage is real. This must be
 wrong. advaita tells us that the cause of bondage is avidyA, mAyA which is
 itself anirvachaniyA. Since now we at least know that cause of bondage is
 mAyA, we can start asking why we should suffer the bondage. This means we
 can have what is called mumuxutva or desire for liberation. Note that I am
 not suggesting that there is no God, rather He is not the cause of this
 bondage.
