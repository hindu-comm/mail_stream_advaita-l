I believe if you search the list archives there have been some posts from
Ramakrishnan on this.

It has been published in Sanskrit with the Chandrika of Jnanottama Mishra
a number of times.  Swami Sacchidanandendra Saraswati also wrote a tika in
modern times.

According to the NYPL catalog there is a Hindi translation by Swami
Krshnananda Sagara and a few of English translations.  I don't know how
good any of them are.
