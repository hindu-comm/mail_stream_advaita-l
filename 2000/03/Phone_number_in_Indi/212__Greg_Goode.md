Greetings to all Advaitins,

I'm looking for the phone number or any info on this publisher in India.
I'd like to get in touch with them.  Last resort would be to send a
snail-mail letter to the address below.

  Sri Vidya Samiti
  Malakara via Chengannur
  Kerala State, INDIA

Thanks for any info.

OM!
