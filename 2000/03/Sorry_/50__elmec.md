Hari Om,

I am extremely sorry for the inconvenience and annoyance caused to all
the List members for infecting all the systems with the worm Happy
'99.exe.

It was purely inadvertant. I myself did not know it till I heard from
many of the list members and I immediately got rid of it via the web
site suggested by Sri Vyas. I once again tender my apology to all of you
for the same. I shall hereafter see that such a blunder will not be
committed again.

Regards,
Latha Vidyaranya
