I have never had a vision of You, after becoming completely detached,
naked, beyond the three guNas, having destroyed the darkness of delusion,
having concentrated my gaze on the tip of the nose, and having known
Your attributes. Nor have I ever remembered, even in an agitated state,
You Shankara, who are completely untainted by the (evils) of Kali Yuga.
O Shiva! O MahAdeva! O Shambhu! Forgive my offense!

What is the use of other karmas? In order to attain MokSha, make the mind's
vR^itti's (activities) firm in Shiva, on whose head  the moon shines,
who is the destroyer of kAma, who bears the gaN^gA, who is Shankara
(bestower of happiness), whose neck and ears are adorned
by serpents, from whose eyes fire emanates, who wears the hide of an
elephant as a garment, and who is the essence of the three worlds.

Tonight (3/3) is MahAshivarAtrI (or tomorrow night depending on how you
calculate it). Let us pray that Shiva bestows His blessings on everyone.

Anand
