What is the use of all this wealth, horses, elephants? What is the
use of even having a kingdom (ie. power and wealth)? What is the use
of having sons, wife, friends, animals, houses? What is the use of
the body? Knowing all this to be liable to perish in a moment, O mind,
renounce it from a distance immediately! In order to realize your Self,
follow the advise of the Guru and worship the Lord of PArvatI, Shankara.

Even as one is seeing it, day by day, life is being shortened and my youth
is being reduced! Days that are gone will never come back! Time is
devourer of the world! lakShmI (wealth) is wavering like the waves of
water (with crests and troughs). And life itself is uncertain and of
short duration like lightning. Therefore,  You who provide refuge to
those who approach You for refuge, protect me even now who have approached
You for refuge!

With my hands, legs, words, body, actions, by hearing, eyes, or even
in my mind alone, whether as part of an enjoined act or as a forbidden
act, whatever offense I have committed, forgive me! Victory be to You,
O Ocean of compassion! O MahAdeva ! O Shambhu!
