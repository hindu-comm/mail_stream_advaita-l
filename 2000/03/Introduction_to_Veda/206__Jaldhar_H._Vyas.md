A new list member has asked for help on introductory works and I request
the members to help him by describing what what were the books or who were
the teachers you heard, which first got you interested in the subject of
Advaita Vedanta?

In my case, while I was raised on the Ramayana and Mahabharata, I treated
them more as thrilling adventure stories.  It was only later I began to
ask questions about the deeper meanings.  At that point my mother gave me
a copy of the Gita with the translation of Swami Shivananda.  Although I
no longer think it is the best translation of the Gita out there it
certainly did whet my appetite to learn more.  But after some unappealing
encounters with watered-down modern forms of Vedanta I would have given it
up if I hadn't discovered the translation of the Laghusiddhantakaumudi of
Varadaraja Bhatt by Col. Ballantyne.  This isn't a philosophical work but
a standard Sanskrit grammar.  I couldn't make head nor tail of it at first
but I was fascinated by how logically the sutras were organized.  I
resolved to learn Sanskrit and the rest as they say is history :-)
