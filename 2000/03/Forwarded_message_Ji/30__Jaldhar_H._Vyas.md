Yes.  He is the spiritual descendant of Swami Vidyaranya who adorned the
pitha of Srngeri during the 14th century.

At this point Yajnavalkya has already become a jnani but there is
still the remnant of the effect of former karma.  It is like if you drive
really fast and then hit the brakes.  The car still moves forward a bit
before halting because of its prior momentum.  This is why even for one
who has realized Brahman there is still the matter of manonasha and
vasanakshaya.

I don't think Krishna Bhagawan is implying that that is the only way to
get moksha but it may be one possible way.  As you say for a Jivanmukta it
would be superfluous.  But regardless of the method, as per Advaita
Vedanta, moksha can only come through jnana.

Karma cannot in anyway cause jnana.  But it helps in a roundabout way by
destroying the obstacles that prevent jnana.  The effects of karma may not
be just due to actions performed in this life but in prior lives.  If
there seems to discrepencies like you mention in the lives of saints it is
because of this prarabdha karma.

Once Brahman is known, moksha is inevitable but does not necessarily
immediately follow for the reason mentioned above.
