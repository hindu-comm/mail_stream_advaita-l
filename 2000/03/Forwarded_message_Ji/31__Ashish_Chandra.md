You might want to read Chapter 43 of Paramhamsa Yogananda's Autobiography of
a Yogi. He was a Paramhamsa Sannyasin of the Adviata order of monks. His
guru, Swami Sri Yukteshwar Giri, was a jivan-mukta. In brief, this chapter
is about the resurrection of Yogananda's guru and his guru's subsequent
revelations to him about the state of deluded jivas upon mortal death. Sri
Yukteshwar tells him that he (Sri Yukteshwar) had been directed by the Lord
to incarnate on an astral planet called Hiranyalok where those beings, who
have atleast had the experience of Nirvikalpa Samaadhi, go to. Sri
Yukteshwar had been incarnated to help the residents of this astral planet
in making progress towards the next state of being, the causal state,
subsequent to which was the immersion (vilay) into the body of Brahman. So
from that standpoint, having the experience of Nirvikalpa Samaadhi is not
the same as being a jivan-mukta.
