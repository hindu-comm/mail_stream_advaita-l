Very true. A person who believes in the tattwa of 'ekamevaadvitiiya' is himself
much above an ordinary mortal who is drowned in materialism. The very belief
that this body as well as this world are 'ashaashwatha' and that Ishwara alone
is our savior is sufficient to take the person high on the ladder of
spirituality.

And, about seeing or not seeing the 'non-duality', I am reminded of a line that
I had read somewhere. " Advaita is not the denial of duality, but the denial of
the reality of the duality " !
