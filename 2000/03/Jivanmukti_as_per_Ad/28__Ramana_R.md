I agree, this is what seems to be the general opinion. But is this backed
up by some scripture ??

Sri Ramana Maharshi says there is no momentary or permanent knowledge.
Either you know or you don't know.

I didn't mean to say if Sri Abhinava Vidyathirtha is/is not a Jivanmukta.
My question was - Did he become one at the age of 15 or 20 years, when he
had the experience(for the 1st time ??) of Nirvikalpa samadhi.
