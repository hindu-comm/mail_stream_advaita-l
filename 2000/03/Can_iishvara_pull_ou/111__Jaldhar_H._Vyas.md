What makes one eventually tire of Maya?  This is also a form of desire.

Yes.

Here's the thing, the Advaita Acharyas even though they taught it was
illusory supported religion.  Actually one particular religion--that of
the Vedas.  Why would they do that?  Because we (meaning the
entities participating in this mailing list) are beings of ordinary
consciousness not awareness.  We cannot just a priori assume that
awareness.

There was a short story of I think, R.K. Narayana about how in some
village in the '60s there was a boy who heard on the radio about Neil
Armstrong landing on the Moon but nobody would believe him.  The idea that
we are down here and the Moon is up there out of reach is perfectly
reasonable and only a lunatic would think otherwise.  It is only after the
shift in perspective from knowing science that the idea becomes
reasonable.  In the case of Moksha we should ask ourselves what is it that
can cause that shift of awareness?  The answer cannot just be
waiting.  After all cows have been staring at the moon for millenia
without thinking of landing upon it.  Can illusionary beings
"naturally" realize they are illusionary?  There is that inner atma that
shines forth which provides the push.  And we know the nature of that atma
from the shastras.  So while they may be "mere" scaffolding, the shastras
and the religious practices therein are the key to moksha.

But how can the inner witness intend anything?  It is that's all.  It is
the conscious jiva that desires the objects of samsara, then eventually
tires of them and desires liberation.  _Then_ desire is transcended.

For the most part, the philosophies that developed in India have not been
so pessimistic.  Even the Buddhists who recognized the truth of suffering
also held the hope that that suffering could be ended.

Yes we should always remember this but also realize that we have no other
choice but to go through Maya to transcend it.

Like the adage of the 10,000 monkeys with 10,000 typewriters eventually
coming up with the entire works of Shakespeare, it woul be possible given
the infinite length of time and the infinite variety of actions to
eventually achieve moksha but since we have the power of action why not
speed things up a bit?  Doubt is the stumbling block but that's the
function of Vedanta to eliminate the doubts.
