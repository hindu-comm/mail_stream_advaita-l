Two nits: first, the army offered was the `nArAyaNI-sainya' (literally,
Narayana's army) led by Krtavarma and consisting of "sons" of Krishna. The
Yadava army consisting of Pradyumna, Samba, Aniruddha, Balarama, etc.,
stayed out of the war while Satyaki alone participated but on behalf of
the Pandavas.  Also, the first choice was also offered to Arjuna for
having been "seen first" and also as the younger of the two.  Duryodhana
was however satisfied by the choice he was obliged to accept as he had
been assured by the asura-s that Karna, with the power of Narakasura
resident in him, would kill both Arjuna and Krishna.
