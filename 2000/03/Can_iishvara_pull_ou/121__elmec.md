Yes, as you say, most of the people gladly surrender themselves to the
sensual
pleasures thinking that it is the ultimate happiness that they can
derive. But there
are some like us ( List members !) who sense a cord of discontent even
amidst all
the pleasures and feel something amiss somewhere. It is such jiivas who
start
inquiring into the nature of pleasures and pains.

I think, in most of the cases of  Sadhakas, this shift in perspective
occurs
intuitively once they sense the vacuum amidst apparent fullness. They
start
questioning the meaning of this drama called life, the significance of
their own
role in it, who the director of this play is ? ? ? etc etc .  It is then
that they
turn towards shastra / a Guru / some elderly person who would be able to
answer this
sudden spring of doubts that has arisen in his mind. If it is a lady who
turns a
jignaasu  shastra is the last thing as she would seldom have direct
access to it.
