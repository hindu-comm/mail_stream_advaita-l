I have mentioned  that ' as long as the child is playing comfortably.......'
and not, ' when the child is suffering '. By that I meant  as long as the man
thinks he is happy, he seldom remembers God and thinks of God only when he is
in distress ( the ordinary Bhaktha ). " sankata bandaaga venkataramana ", as
we say in kannada.

Hence there is no question of ego in this. It is just that when the child does
not require mother's presence, she will mind other jobs, all the while
keeping  a watchful eye and ear upon the child.  And she is always there ready
to take care of it when situation requires. Similarly God is also watching
everyone with love and concern. He readily answers when bhaktha calls Him.

Yes, very true. That Love or God or Self or Atma is veiled by ignorance. The
bhaktha or the seeker has to make an attempt to seek that truth / to remove
this veil.  It does not reveal by itself. This is what I meant by ' the call
has to come from the child/bhaktha first '. The child only has to gesture by
raising both its hands and,  lo! mother comes rushing towards it to pick up
the child. Bhaktha has only to remember Him and He responds immediately.
