As matter of fact I do reject Krishnamurti but in this case it is the
substance of of what he said I'm responding to.  If one really believes
that truth is unknowable, then nothing anyone says about the truth is
valid including the idea that truth is unknowable.

But this doesn't work.  There was a medieval Indian saint called Kabir who
quite caustically attacked both Hindus and Muslims for their pomp and
hierarchy.  300 tears later guess what?  There is a Kabir panth with
priests and scriptures, and temples.

But the key is it is the man of knowledge or Jnani who is being talked
about here.  A Ramana or Ramakrishna may have been quite justified in
saying what they did from their perspective but that doesn't mean the same
perspective applies to us.  Strictly speaking, only the paramhamsa is a
real Advaitin.  All the rest of us are mere hangers-on.  Hopefully we are
taking steps to prepare for becoming Advaitins but we shouldn't confuse
the journey for the destination.

The upshot of passages like this if applied to the non-jnani is that jnana
is essentially a random occurrence that just "happens".  Such a view can
only encourage passivity and hopelessness.  As I mentioned previously, the
various darshanas that developed in India do not take such a fatalistic
view.

This is the kind of subject that has the potential to offend people.  I
think the truth is more important than someones feelings but I'll try not
to gratuitously offend anyone and I appreciate being told if I am doing
that.
