It's been a long time since I looked at a Bible but I'm pretty sure these
two statements are from Jesus talking about himself.  I don't think any
interpreter has held them to refer to the individual Christian himself.

Perhaps it is possible to interpret Christian teachings that way but
historically it has not been done which is an important thing to consider
if following the faith of ones forefathers is a goal.
