If that is so why there is so much emphasis on
liberation in our
shaastra-s? Why not pursue this game of saMsara for
ever? Any way the
duality is only a mithya!

But this is not so. From the point of view of jiiva
the suffering is
real.
No amount of intellectual reasoning can remove the
pangs of this
suffering.

Let us ponder on the following:

As long as the jiva is in its Vyavaharika state, all
intellectual reasoning  unfortunately takes place and
remains in this state of Vyavahara and it can never
mitigate the suffering of this Jiva , try as it may..


Eventhough Jiva is verily Brahman to start with, as
rightly averred by a member in this discussion,due its
adjunct,Maya,Brahman has been veiled from its own
reality and is languishing as the Jiva which can never
come out of this state of suffering unless it sheds
its ignorance by Intutive Knowledge of its own SELF
that it is verily BRAHMAN as Adi Shankara states:
"Brahma satyam Jagan mithya
Jivo Brahmaiva na parah"

Then again when this occurs ,in the words of
Gaudapadacharya:

"Prabodhe swapnavat sarvo vyavaharo nivartate
Etattat uttamum satyam yatra kinchin na jayate"

Meaning:

When Enlightenment dawns ,all vyavahara cease to exist
This is the ultimate truth that nothing ever comes
into existance.

Hari Om !
