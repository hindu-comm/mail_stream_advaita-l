The question is how does he realize this?  I'm sure it has not escaped
anyones attention that most people in the world are quite content to enjoy
the pleasures of the senses for their entire lives.  That's why hedonism
is called "lokayata" the way of the world.

To answer my own question, it is through listening and apprehending the
meaning of the shastras that a shift in perspective occurs.  Then that
very desire that caused sorrow can begin to be employed against itself.
