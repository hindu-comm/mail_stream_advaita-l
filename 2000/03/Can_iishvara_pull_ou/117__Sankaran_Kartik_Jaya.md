Yes. I too believe that one must not give up the faith that one was born
into at any cost.

Ramana Maharshi has said, "All of Vedanta is contained in the two Biblical
statements: `I am that I am' and `Be still and know that I am God.' "

Again, to a person who asked him about the Bible and the GItA, Ramana
said, "They are the same book."

It's highly unlikely that Ramana would've made such strong statements in
support of the Bible if it weren't non-dualistic.
