Shankaracharya is not the founder of the Smarta sampradaya but its
rejuvenator.  If you look in the archives, there was a series of posts by
Shri S.R. Marur about the history of our sampradaya a few months ago.

The Panchayatana puja on the other hand was founded by Shankaracharya at
least according to what I've heard.

Shankaracharya criticizes the vyuha theory of the Pancharatra Agamas
(which are the basis of Shrivaishnavism) and there is literary and
monumental evidence for Shaivism and Shaktism before that too.  It is
possible to find sectarian messages in the Vedas and Puranas but where we
think the theistic schools have gone wrong is in thinking that is the
_whole_ message of the Vedas.
