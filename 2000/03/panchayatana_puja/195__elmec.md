Here I would like to know why Shankara is called the
"Shanmathasthaapanaachaarya " ? When he introduced the " Panchaayatana
pooja "
system, was it not sufficient to end the sqabble over the superiority of
Gods
?
How can one person advocate six different sampradaayas ? I am quite
confused
over the terms Panchayatana and Shanmatha. Kindly clarify. (Hope you
dont
think my confusion is absurd !)

Hari Om,
