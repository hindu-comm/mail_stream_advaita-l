    I request clarification of a few doubts regarding this.

1. I have heard that the Panchayatana puja and the Smartha
   tradition were both very old ( i.e. since vedic times ).
   Adi Shankara revived these and re-instated them.
   Or, did he actually institute them?  Are there any
   evidences for pre-Shankaran origins of the Smartha
   tradition ( like temples, monuments etc. )?

2. At least in Tamil Nadu, most of the conflict between
   shaivites and vaishnavites seems to have occurred AFTER
   ShrI Shankara.  This has lead to some views that there
   was sectarian squabbling by the various bhakti cults
   which put paid to the essendtial "unity" of gods.
   So, did ShrI Shankara unite what were disparate elements
              OR
       did ShrI Shankara establish a unified, undivided
       tradition which was later on split in to sects?

Thanks.

-Vivek.

When Ramana says, "All religions are the same," surely

the Heaven's gate cult when he used the term "all
religions"? Does it
really require so much clarification?

Is it not time that we pause a while and ruminate as
to where this thread is leading us to? Do we all not
know that Religion ends where Philosophy begins?Why
are we talking about the various religions in this
forum which is devoted to Advaita as preached by
Shankara?Surely, Shankara did talk about religion to
many of his followers who were not ripe enough to
transend it! Even though Shankara preched Advaita with
Scriptural authority he also composed Saundarya Lahiri
in praise of the Shakti Goddess -Kali (Ref:
Panchayatana thread in this discussion somewhere).
Surely Shankara also established the Shadmathas with
six gurus to propogate them to the  respective
religious masses.

Nanyotosti Dhrishta, Nanyotosti Shrota, Nanyotosti
Mantha,Nanyotosti Vigyata, Eshata Atma Antaryami
AMRUTAHA!

Hari Om !
