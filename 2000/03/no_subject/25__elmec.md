Hari Om,

I do not understand how an attachment file has been posted under my
message with subject " patience and perseverance ". I also received
another copy of my message without the attachment . And many list
members have warned us of a 'WORM' contained in that attachment. This is
all very new to me and kindly tell me how to remove it. I have already
deleted many of the messages containing this attachment. I hope this
does not pose any serious problem to our computer.

Regards,
Latha vidyaranya
