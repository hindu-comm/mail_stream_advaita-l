31 according to the Vani Vilas edition which is probably the most
athoritative.  I guess this includes the dhruva or refrain as the missing
verse.

The copy I have with accompanying tika by an unknown author is not very
good but as far as I can tell:

1-13 (including the dhruva) Shankaracharya himself
14                          Padmapadacharya
15                          Totakacharya
16                          Hastamalakacharya
17                          Subodha
18                          Vartikakara (i.e. Sureshwaracharya)
19                          Nityananda
20                          Anandagiri
21                          Drdhabhakti
22                          Nityanatha
23                          Yogananda
24                          Surendra
25                          Medhatithi
26                          Bharativamsha
27                          Sumati
28-31                       Shankaracharya again

Not much is known about the other 10.  Anandagiri is the name of the
tikakara on most of Shankaracharyas works as well as the author of a
Shankara Digvijaya.  Medahatithi is also the name of a commentator on
Manusmrti.  One tradition is that these 10 were disciples of the major 4
and founded the Dashanami orders.  Others say Shankaracharya directly
founded them himself.
