ambhodhara shyAmaLa kuntalaayai
 taTitprabhaataamra jaTaadharaaya |
niriishvaraayai nikhileshvaraaya
 namaH shivaayai cha namaH shivaaya || 6 ||

I made few typos in the verse 6. I am  sorry for this. Thanks to Aravind
for pointing this out. It should be kuntala instead of kundala, and
prabhaataamra instead of just prabhaata.  Since I wrote from memory, I
made the errors.


HER hair is dark like water bearing clouds and HIS jaTa is raised and
radiant with a golden hue like a ripe mango fruit (golden color).  SHE has
none superior to HER and HE is the Lord of all. Such is the wonderful form
of ardhanaarishvara. I bow to shrii shivaa and Lord shiva.

kuntala is more appropriate which means hair of the head or particular
hair style. It took me sometime to understand the term prabhaataamra. I
was wondering how the mango fits here. Fortunately, when I was gazing at
the picture of shrii miinaakshii amman I have in office, the halo drawn
behind her head was golden yellow in color and looked for a moment like a
mango. That prompted me to understand it here as symbolizing the golden
color. Please note that I do not now sanskrit (except meanings of few
words), I contemplate on the words, use dictionaries and write the
meanings. It is quite safe to assume that they will have errors. So be
warned.

Corrections are welcome.
