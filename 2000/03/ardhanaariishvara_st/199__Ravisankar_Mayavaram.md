SHE dances in delight with captivating beauty at face of creation which
springs forth them. His dance of destruction is in fury  and the cosmos
subsides back in them. SHE is the mother of this world and He is the
Father. Such is the wonderful nature of ardhanaariishvara, I bow to shrii
shivaa  and Lord shiva.

Comments and corrections are welcome.
