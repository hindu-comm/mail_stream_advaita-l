mandaara maalaa kalitaa lakayai
 kapala maalaa~Nkita kaMdharaya |
divyaambaraayai cha digambaraaya
 namaH shivaayai cha namaH shivaaya || 5 ||

ambaaL's forhead is adorned with garlands made of mandaaram (Hibiscus) and
Lord's neck is adorned is adorned with garland made of skulls. SHE is
dresses  in royal and divine clothes and HE has directions alone has is
clothes. I bow to shrii shivaa and Lord shiva.


The word digambara indicates that HE does not wear clothes as a mark of
renunciation. The skulls indicate to the devotees that life in a body is
transient and impermanent, one day you will have to die, so do not get
mixed up with this world. digambara can also mean brahman. How can you
clothe something which is the biggest and the greatest. If so one could
say then that HE is contained in the dress and not outside it. A similar
sentiment is indicated in Bible, when Jesus says he has no resting place.
A principle that pervades everything can have no particular resting place.
