It is a beautiful interpretation !

As I read it I was reminded of what Sri Vinoba Bhave says in  his lecture on
Gita which he makes during one of the jail terms during our freedom struggle
addressing his fellow country men.

" One has to foster the body and cherish it so that one can make use of it to
carry out  'swadharma'. But a restricted and shallow identification of oneself
with the body sets the limits of my expansion. Myself and those related to me
through this body set the limit. We start building walls around us. wherever we
turn we see walls, walls and nothing but walls. Within these walls the germs of
base thoughts multiply and the health of our spirit is destroyed " .

By reducing ones possessions one may not reduce ones possessiveness ! - quote

I feel that a very poor person may always be dreaming of becoming rich one day
, while a very rich person may always be having nightmares of losing all his
riches one day. So a person who is a go-between these two states, say, a person
from middle class who would have tasted what poverty is at some point of time
in his life and who has also enjoyed some luxuries at other times of his life
would be in a better position to  understand the ephemeral nature of
materialistic life. He has a good chance of gaining viveka and vairaagya, I
feel. But whatever we may say here, it is the 'poorva janma samskaara' which
has the last
laugh !
