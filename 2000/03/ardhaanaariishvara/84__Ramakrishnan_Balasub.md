Thanks for this info. In this case the vishvarUpAya vai namo namaH
would have to be taken as a separate sentence, I guess. I tried to
interpret the verse as a whole. I agree my interpretation is forced,
but what is the fun if you can't give some forced interpretations once
in a while? :-).

The sa hariH occurs in the Andhra version of the tatittirIya AraNyaka.
I believe bhaTTa bhAskara (who lived before shAyaNa) recognizes sa
hariH. I don't have his commentary with me, but I can try to take a
look the next time I go to the library.
