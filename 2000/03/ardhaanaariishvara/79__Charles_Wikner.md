In anuSTubh meter the second or third syllable in each pAda must
be guru, and the extra M simply forces the previous syllable to
be guru by the rule saMyoge guru.  I would not read that M as a
vibhakti necessarily, but simply treat it as poetic licence.
This is not to negate your interpretation, but just to point out
that there is another (simpler) explanation.

The word idam, especially when contrasted to tat, convntionally refers
to this world, and the phrase idam sarvam almost invariably means this
world.  That tat and idam are neuter is by convention, but that could
be justified  by treating them as pronouns standing in for nirguNa-
and saguNa-brahman respectively (brahman being neuter).

The form given in the sUktam is grammatically correct as it is.  When a
visheSaNa is used in apposition it should follow the gender of the nAman,
however, when two nAme are placed in apposition their genders may differ.
For example, rAmo mama mitram (Rama is my friend) - mitram is neuter in
later Sanskrit, or so I understand.  As an interesting aside, the word
mama does not change with the gender of the speaker, i.e. the first and
second person pronouns (aham, tvam) are common gender.

Another illustration of this gender-bending grammar is in the mahAvAkya
ayam AtmA brahma (mA.up.2), where substituting the masculine form brahmA
would give a rather different meaning!

Ditto, neither am I.
