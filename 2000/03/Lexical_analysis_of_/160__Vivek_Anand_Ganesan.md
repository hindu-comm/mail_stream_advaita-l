Hello :

  I would like to know how the word "Brahman" is explained.
I am specifically interested in knowing about the meaning
of the root "Brih".  I have seen two different contexts.
a) "Brih" = expand, grow.
b) "Brih" = Great, majestic

Why is this so?

Thanks,

-Vivek.

----------------------

There has been discussion regarding the mother who does not intervene
on behalf of her child while the child is playing comfortably--but does
so if the child cries out.

But: she does step forth to rescue the child when it moves too close to
danger (the edge of a cliff) whether it cries out or not, doesn't she?

The question then remains:  "Does Ishavara step forth to pull a jiva out
from it's captivity in the world?"

It would seem not, given the nature of maya.  There is never any real dan-
ger in a jiva's apparent captivity in the world--since the jiva and Brahman
are always one to begin with.

To the perceiver who is going over the cliff, the danger seems real.  To the
watcher within, there is no danger at all.

Abiding as the watcher is the perceiver's true goal--and it's achievement is
his disappearance.

Have I erred in this?

Sincerely,

John
