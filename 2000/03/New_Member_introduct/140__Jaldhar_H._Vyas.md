Firstly may I introduce myself as a resident of India in Chennai and an
ardent follower of Shri Shankara's Advaitic Philosophy.It was my revered
father who initiated me into this realm of Advaita and preached to me the
basics of the important Upanishadic Texts.In fact he has left a whole lot
of manuscripts with reference to his own thoughts as well as his works by
way of translations in Tamil,The Mandukya Upanishad Mantras and the Karika
of Shri Gaudapada on this upanishad,The Brahmasutra Bhashya of Shri
Shankara and Ishta Sidhi by Vimuktatman.After his demise I have been
studying his writings as well as pursuing the study of Vedanta.  I am
presently visiting my children in the States and will be here for at least
the next six months.  I thought being a member in your list will give me
an opportunity to have satsang while in the states.  Also, discussions
could help me towards Awareness.
