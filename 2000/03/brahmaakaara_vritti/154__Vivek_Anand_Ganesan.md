  Many thanks to ShrI Swaminarayan and to Smt. Latha for
her
wonderful analogy.  I guess I had automatically assumed
that
"vritti" means transformation.  It is my understanding that
the "individual" consciousness does not undergo any
transformation during liberation.  So, I was curious to
know
if there is in fact an "expansion".  I guess in this case
the expansion is one of realization after removal of
ignorance.

-Vivek.
