A Jivatman in its quest for Self -Realisation passes
through a state of Brahmakara Vritti.
We have to consider Brahmakara Vritti essentially as a
state in Dwaitam
  and as a Chitta Vritti which should be negataed as
"Na Iti" -- "Not This"
Consider this:.
Patanjali in his yoga sutras states,
 Yogas chitta vritti nirodhaha,
Tada Dhrastuhu swarupe awasthanam.
meaning
Yoga is the negation of all Chitta Vrittis
Then the Dhrastuhu , the SEER- (SELF),  remains in His
original Swarupa.

May we invoke the Blessings of the Acharyas to
experience this state of the SELF.
