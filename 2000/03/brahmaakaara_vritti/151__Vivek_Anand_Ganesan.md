Hello :

  I came across the term "brahmaakaara vritti" in the
Jivanmukti thread. ( Many thanks to Smt. Latha for this
wonderful series ).

I have a couple of questions regarding this phrase.

a) What exactly does this mean?
   At the moment of Liberation, is there an "expansion"
   of the individual consciousness?

b) If it does mean the expansion of the individual
   consciousness that would imply that it was formerly
   bound or limited?  That limitation is not really real,
   is it?  In that case, how can there be an expansion?
   I mean, what does it expand in to?

Thanks,

-Vivek.
