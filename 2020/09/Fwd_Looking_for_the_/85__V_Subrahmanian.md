Subject: Looking for the source of this shruti passage
To: BHARATIYA VIDVAT <bvparishat at googlegroups.com>


Namaste

In the commentary to the Taittiriya Upanishad, Swami Vidyaranya cites this
passage  यक्षगन्घर्वाप्सरोगणसेवितमन्तरिक्षम्  while commenting on
'gandharva' and says it is from a shruti.  A search on the net for the
source did not yield any result.

Could anyone kindly help locating the source?

Thanks and regards
