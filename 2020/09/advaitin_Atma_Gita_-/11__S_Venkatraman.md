Namaste Subbuji,

I just listened to the commentary of Swami Paramarthananda on this verse of Panchadashi. He says Atma Gita also called Atma Purana is attributed to Shankarananda who is the Guru of Vidyaranya himself. According to him, Atma Purana is a voluminous work which analyses the Dasha Upanishads. It is similar to Anubhuti Prakasha of Vidyaranya and a Sanskrit commentary is also available on it.

Commenting on this verse, Swami Swahananda in Panchadashi published by Ramakrishna Mutt says, “Atma Gita or Atma Purana 131, probably by Sankarananda or Vidyasankara, the Pontiff of Sringeri before Bharatitirtha and Vidyaranya”. From the way numbers are used in this publication it appears that 131 is the verse no. in Atma Gita or Atma Purana.

Regards,
Venkatraman

A search for the verses commencing from 152 below does not yield any results.  Could anyone locate the source of the text called Atma Gita?  It is likely that it is part of Yoga Vasishtha.  In any case, the exact source of the text would give us more valuable verses for Mumukshu-s.
