Pranams to all of you.
अग्नीर्मूर्धा चक्षुषी चन्द्रसूर्यौ दिशः श्रोत्रे वाग्विवृताश्च वेदाः ।
वायुः प्रणो हृदयं विश्वमस्य पद्भ्यां पृथिवी ह्येष सर्वभूतान्तरात्मा ॥ ४ ॥

Krishnanda in his commentary on the Mandukya upanished (verse 3) says this verse from the Manduka upanishad refers to the Paramatma, that is Brhman.The verse seems to say it is the atma that resides in all the jivas.Would greatly appreciate clarification of what this specifically refers to.Thank you.Soma
