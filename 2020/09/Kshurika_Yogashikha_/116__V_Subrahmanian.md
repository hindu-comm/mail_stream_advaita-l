Swami Vidyaranya has cited an Upanishadic passage -

सुषुम्ना तु परे लीना विरजा ब्रह्मरूपिणी -   in the Taittiriya Upanishad
commentary.  Upon a search it is seen to be found in these two Upanishads:

Kshurika upanishad:

Yogashikha upanishad:

https://sanskritdocuments.org/doc_upanishhat/yogashikha.html

These form part of the 108 Upanishads listed in the Muktikopanishad.  Both
these Upanishads have the commentary of Narayanashrama/Shankarananda who
preceded Swami Vidyaranya.  Of course, the Upanishad Brahma Yogin
commentary is also there as part of the 108 Upanishads.

We come to know through Swami Vidyaranya's writings about the existence of
certain Upanishads (in the pre 14th Century CE)  that have not been cited
popularly by Shankaracharya and others.
