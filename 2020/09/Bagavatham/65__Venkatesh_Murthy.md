Namaste

Nonvedic practices and groups can be found in Vaishnavas also. First of all
the Srivaishnavites and Madhvas are not following Vedic practices strictly.
They are following more Pancharatra Agama practices.

There are nonvedic groups like Bauls. They are mixing Hindu and Muslim
religions and many prohibited practices. Kindly see -
