The above is not a correct assessment of the Mandukya Upanishad/Karika.
The very name Upanishad must have alerted you.  The Karikas are named: 1.
agama prakarana (Aagama means Veda) 2. Vaitathya 3.Advaita and 4.
Alathashanti.

Even though in certain chapters reason would seem predominant, yet, those
reasons are based on/conducive to the Veda.  There are shlokas that clearly
paraphrase the upanishadic statements.
