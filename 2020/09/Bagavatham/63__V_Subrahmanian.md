The commentary says nothing significant about this.  As already clarified,
the curse is about a certain group of people who practice rituals that are
not approved by veda/vaidikas.  A few days ago I had made this post here:

''Paashupata-s' as  Shiva Bhakta Vaidika-s   -  Kurma Puranam

https://sanskritdocuments.org/doc_giitaa/vyAsagItAkUrmapurANa.html?lang=sa

In this section of the Kurmapurana, where a number of 'Tirtha sthalam-s'
have been specified along with the phalam of performing rituals in those
holy places.  In the following selection, where 'Mahalaya', a ksehtra of
Mahadeva, 'Paashupatha-s', who are benign, shaantaaH, adept in
Vedadhyayana, adorned with Bhasma, meditate upon Mahadeva,   This
description goes against the bigoted view of some 'Vaishnavas' who hold
that 'Rudra is a taamasic deity worshiped only by avaidika-s. [Even
Govindaraja has said this in the Ramayana commentary.] The practice of
vaidika-s worshiping/meditating on Rudra was forcefully introduced by
Vidyaranya and Appayya Dikshita and the Sringeri and Kanchi Acharyas down
the line.'

The 'Paashupata vratam' is in the Atharva shira Upanishad and in many other
Upanishads where the mantras (also from the Atharva shira 'agniriti
bhasma...and the Mahanarayana Upanishad 'sadyojaatam..') to be chanted
while donning the bhasma, the method of preparing bhasma, etc. are
ordained.

कूर्मपुराणए उत्तरभागे सप्तत्रिंशत्तमोऽध्यायः

सूत उवाच ।
इदमन्यत् परं स्थानं गुह्याद् गुह्यतमं महत् ।
महादेवस्य देवस्य महालयमिति श्रुतम् ॥ ३७.१॥

तत्र देवादिदेवेन रुद्रेण त्रिपुरारिणा ।
शिलातले पदं न्यस्तं नास्तिकानां निदर्शनम् ॥ ३७.२॥

तत्र पाशुपताः शान्ता भस्मोद्धूलितविग्रहाः ।
उपासते महादेवं वेदाध्ययनतत्पराः ॥ ३७.३॥
