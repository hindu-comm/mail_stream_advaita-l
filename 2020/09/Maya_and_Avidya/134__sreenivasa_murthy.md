  Dear Sreenivasa Murthy,
Prranams,
I have been following your learned posts with keen interest. According to my limited understanding, the mind or ego itself is the Jiva. In deep sleep, there is neither ego nor mind nor jiva. In that state, the ego or the mind subsides unconsciously into the Self or Pure Consciousness, which is termed as Atman in Sanskrit. In the waking state, the ego/mind arises from the Pure Consciousness and all the worldly vyavaharaa begins to entangle this ego in various bonds. This is the samsaara bandham of the ego. Hope my understanding is correct. Thanks and regards, Ramesh Ramanan.

 Dear Smallpress,You write : "Would it be right to say the way the mind of Jiva works to project the world"I have a doubt. 
It is : is there a jiva separate from mind?
I request you to clear the doubt.
With respectful regards,Sreenivasa Murthy

 Dear Illustrious Members
Would it be right to say the way the mind of Jiva works to project the world, Maya works for the Brhman to project the world?
That is Ignorance is at microcosmic level and Maya is at Macro.
Are they both working to veil the same thing?
Thank you
Soma
