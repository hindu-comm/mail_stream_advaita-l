In a way, this theory finds approval in the Panchadashi.  It says 'Ishwara
srishti (involving Maya) is not binding.  On the other hand, is useful (for
moksha sadhana).  Jiva srishti (involving avidya) is binding.  The example
given is: Ishwara creates a female body, a maamsa maya stree. But the jiva
sees her in so many ways, mother, sister, wife, daughter, etc. etc. all
these are manomaya stree-s.  The former is innocent, the latter is binding.
