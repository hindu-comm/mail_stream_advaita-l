Dear Raghav ji,

In Advaita too all sadhana up to and including aparoksha jnana, is in the
realm of Prakriti.  It may be named variously as Maya, Mother, Devi,
Shakti, etc.  Since Brahman is akarta, nishkriya, kevala sakshi, all
bandha-moksha vyavahara is in the Maya level with Brhaman just providing
the consciousness.  While in Sankhya, Pradhana is svatantra, in Advaita it
is brahma adheena, and the adheenatva is just what is said above. The
Kanchi Acharya, in his Advaita Sadhana, that was painstakingly translated
by Prof V.K. ji and published in Advaitin forum years back, says: Shiva or
Shakti leads the sadhaka to the ultimate realization and once that happens,
erases itself.  Vyavaharika satya comes to an end.

Sri Ramakrishna Paramahamsa said in a similar vein:  There is Avidya Maya
and Vidya Maya.  When we pray and propitiate the latter, the former
releases her grip of bondage and it is the latter that succeeds in
redeeming the jiva from bondage. The whole play is within the realm of
sattva, rajas and tamas.  He also told the famous story of three robbers
and the wayfarer where the first two bind and the third releases.

regards
subbu
