 Interesting perspective andIt does not sound that simple to me :-)The meaning of Maya or Ma ya, is “not her” as it is F gender.Avidya veils our Self-awareness, the Atma, from us.Maya projects and envelopes us into a world of Names and Forms, and veils us from the only reality which is Brhman.When we transcend Avidya we will also transcend Maya and achieve advaitam.Pranam.Soma.

 Namaste,

A simpler explanation of these terms for those who may be interested:

mAyA : A key to deciphering the (possible) original meaning of this word
can be found in local Indian languages. For example, in Marathi, this word
means "motherly love". In-fact word mAya or mAyI means mother.
Ishvara's involvement in/ with the world in out of motherly love, mAyA.
Hence this worldly involvement does not lead to any binding karma.

On the other hand, jIva-s involvement in world is mixed with "incorrect
understanding of things = avidyA" to a larger or lesser extent. This
involvement in worldly affairs, to the extent it is rooted in avidyA,
leads to binding karma.

Hence the emphasis of overcoming avidyA with vidyA, jnAna, vijnAna.
Hence the repeated claims that avidyA is the cause of all sorrow.

Shrinivas Gadkari
