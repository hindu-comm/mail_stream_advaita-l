 Dear Smallpress,You write : "Would it be right to say the way the mind of Jiva works to project the world"I have a doubt. 
It is : is there a jiva separate from mind?
I request you to clear the doubt.
With respectful regards,Sreenivasa Murthy

 Dear Illustrious Members
Would it be right to say the way the mind of Jiva works to project the world, Maya works for the Brhman to project the world?
That is Ignorance is at microcosmic level and Maya is at Macro.
Are they both working to veil the same thing?
Thank you
Soma
