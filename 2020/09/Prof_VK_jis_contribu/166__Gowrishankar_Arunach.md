 Here is a link to a continuous text on 'Advaitamritam', a section of the
larger book 'Gitamrita mahodadhi' authored by Br.Sri Viswanatha Iyer, the
revered father of Prof VK ji. It is with the latter's untiring efforts did
the manuscript see the light of publication.

One can greatly benefit by reading these pages that condense the sublime
