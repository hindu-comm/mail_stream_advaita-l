Let me restate that.
Avidya, an the effect of mano vritti, veils the true nature of Jiva and instead effects its identity with the world of Names and Forms.
Maya Shakti effects the veiling of the true nature of Brhman and instead creates the world of Names and Forms.
Is this a valid way to think of the two?
Thank you.

Dear Illustrious Members
Would it be right to say the way the mind of Jiva works to project the world, Maya works for the Brhman to project the world?
That is Ignorance is at microcosmic level and Maya is at Macro.
Are they both working to veil the same thing?
Thank you
Soma
