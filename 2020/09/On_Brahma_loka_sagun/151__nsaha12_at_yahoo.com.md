 Recently, in response to someone's question, I prepared a list of
(selected) passages from the Prasthana Traya Bhashya on the topic of Brahma
loka, its attainment, the cause, jnana there and Krama mukti, bhoga there
and return to samsara, etc. The passages may be a source of information on
these topics. Terms like Hiranyagarbha, Sutratma, Karya Brahma, Apara
Brahma, SaguNa Brahma, Satya loka, etc. too find place here. The list can
be accessed here:
