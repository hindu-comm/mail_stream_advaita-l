THENKARAI: MARCH 25-26, 2017
Jagadgurus in Thenkarai

Jagadguru Shankaracharya Sri Sri Bharati Tirtha Mahasannidhanam and Jagadguru Sri Sri Vidhushekhara Bharati Sannidhanam
arrived at Thenkarai on March 25, 2017. A large number of devotees led by Sri V Vaidyanathan and Sri V Jayaraman
(sons of Dharmatma Vaidyasubrahmanya Iyer) welcomed the Jagadgurus to the Thenkarai Agrahara.

Prior to the arrival at Thenkarai, the Jagadgurus were received by the devotees at the neighbouring town of Sholavandan.
Sri Sannidhanam had Darshan at the Janakai Mariamman temple.

On arrival at Thenkarai, the Jagadgurus had Darshan of the Murti of Sri Adi Shankaracharya at the Sringeri Shankara Math.
After Dhuli Pada Puja was performed by Sri V Vaidyanathan, the Sabha to welcome the Jagadgurus began with Veda Ghosha
and a prayer song by Smt. Sharada Ramanan. After a citation in poetic Tamil was offered to the Jagadgurus welcoming them,
the Acharyas blessed the gathering with Anugraha Bhashanams.

Sri Sannidhanam in His Anugraha Bhashanam stated that we will all do well to remember the existence of other worlds or
Lokas and the fact of the law of Karma. Reflecting on the possible consequences of engaging in adharmic acts would help us
to increase our Dharma Shraddha. Sri Mahasannidhanam pointed out that man must cultivate noble qualities and engage in
Paropakara. He must never do unto others what he would not want to be done unto his one self – आत्मनः प्रतिकूलानि परेषां न समाचरेत्.
Sri Mahasannidhanam also remembered that Thenkarai had been graced by the Sringeri Jagadgurus many times, remembering
in particular the first visit of His Guru (Jagadguru Sri Abhinava Vidyatirtha Mahaswamiji) in 1958, when devotees led
by Dharmatma Sri Vaidyasubramania Iyer welcomed the Jagadguru.

[FYI: The above is a reference to the Golden Rule:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Rule
"The Golden Rule is the principle of treating others as you want to be treated. It is a maxim that is found in most
religions and cultures...The maxim may appear as a positive or negative injunction governing conduct: Treat others
as you would like others to treat you (positive or directive form). Do not treat others in ways that you would not
like to be treated (negative or prohibitive form)."]

Sri Sannidhanam performed the Sharada Chandramoulishwara Puja at night.

The following morning, Sri Sannidhanam visited the century old temple of Vishalakshi Sameta Kashi Vishweshwara Swamy temple
at Mullipallam. Sri Sannidhanam also visited Mannadimangalam, where He blessed the renovation efforts of the Adhishtanam
of Sri Jnanananda Bharati Swamigal (Sri R Krishnaswamy Iyer in Poorvashrama).

Later, at Thenkarai, Sri Mahasannidhanam and Sri Sannidhanam had Darshan at the Sri Moolanatha Swamy temple. The Jagadgurus
then gave Darshan, distributed Tirtha Prasada and blessed the devotees with Ashir Mantrakshatas.
