Namaste
While chanting gita etc., is it essential to do sandhi of the words? Or is
it only optional during chanting?

Example
अधश्चोर्ध्वं प्रसृतास्तस्यशाखा :
Or
अधः च ऊर्ध्वं प्रसृता : तस्य शाखाः
Or
अधश्चोर्ध्वं प्रसृता : तस्य शाखाः

The first would be the natural way of chanting. But are the second and
third manner of chanting regarded as acceptable or are they avoidable?

I request anyone in the know to answer.

Om
Raghav
