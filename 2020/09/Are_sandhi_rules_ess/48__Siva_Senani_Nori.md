Your understanding is right. The relevant rules are
संहितैकपदे नित्या नित्या धातूपसर्गयोः ।नित्या समासे वाक्ये तु सा विवक्षामपेक्षते ॥
Within a word (between dhatu and upasarga and in a samasta pada) and in poetry sandhi is compulsory; in a vaakya it is as per the wish of the speaker.
Regards,
Senani

मूलानि अनुसन्ततानि has 9 maatras
मू ला नि अ नु सन् त ता नि  9

छ्न्दोभङ्ग leads to changes in the number of maatraas which changes the
chandas itself.

Also in prose it's perhaps 'tolerable' to occasionally break the sandhi for
some ease of reading/comprehension, and do some pada vibhaaga, but
certainly not allowed in poetry. This is what I understand from Siva Senani
Ji's post.
