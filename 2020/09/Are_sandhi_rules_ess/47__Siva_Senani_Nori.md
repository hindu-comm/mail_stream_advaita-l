Namaste Raghav garu
Please refer to the sutra of Pingala इयादिपूरणः ।३.२॥ which sanctions usage of इय and उव for the sake of pada purana, as found in तत्सवितुरवरेणियम् and दिवं गच्छ सुवःपते
There is also another vaakya from Alankara Sastra or a general one but I don't recollect it - - only the artha was retained by me :-)

Regards,
Senani

Not merely a good practice, it is essential to follow sandhi rules. Sandhi is nitya in poetry.
Why? Otherwise there would be chandobhanga. It is said that it is okay if there is a mistake in vyakarana , but there should be no mistake in chandas.


That's remarkable. Thanks for sharing that. If you happen to come across or recollect that particular verse/passage stating the above essentiality of chandas over even vyAkaraNam, kindly share it.
Om
Raghav




Chandas is like devata and is held to be powerful in its own right without reference to the content.

Generally, BG shloka contains 4 pAdAs with each having 8 syllables. So, while chanting, 
we give a short pause at 8th and resume. There are exceptional shlokas that have more than
32 syllables and proper pause has to be followed. 

It is always a good practice to follow the sandhi rules as the chanting evokes a sense of 
rythm (गीता सुगीता कर्तव्या)

2nd option is more naive which is taught to kids. 3rd seems to be good. 

The Gita Press has recently published the 'सरल गीता that has markings where to pause.

Regs,
Sriram
