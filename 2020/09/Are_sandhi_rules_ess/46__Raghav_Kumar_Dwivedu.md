 For completeness. An example...
मूलान्यनुसन्ततानि 8 maatras

मू लान् य नु सन् त ता नि    8

मूलानि अनुसन्ततानि has 9 maatras
मू ला नि अ नु सन् त ता नि    9

छ्न्दोभङ्ग leads to changes in the number of maatraas which changes the
chandas itself.

Also in prose it's perhaps 'tolerable' to occasionally break the sandhi for
some ease of reading/comprehension, and do some pada vibhaaga, but
certainly not allowed in poetry. This is what I understand from Siva Senani
Ji's post.
