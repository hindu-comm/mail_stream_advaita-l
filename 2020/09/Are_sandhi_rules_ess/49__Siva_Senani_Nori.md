Namaste Raghav garu
It is improper to comment on recordings of great scholars, who have studied Siksha Sastra under competent gurus. If we sit in front of them, I am sure such doubts will not arise.
Pronunciation is best learnt from guru face to face.

A question on visargas and halantas at the end of a verse.

In this video (as also of several other artistes/sadhakas), the visargas at the end of a verse and also the halantas are pronounced as written - i.e., as sudden stops.
https://youtu.be/k3THo8l_4_4

Whereas it's common to hear the visarga at the end of a verse to be pronounced as "aha" in a word like "Raamaha" (half-mAtra at the end) rather than just "RaamaH" (abrupt stop).
Similarly the phrase 'pada-mavyayan-tat' is pronounced as pada-mavayayan-tatu" -introducing a half-maatra at the end. Is this latter manner merely a southern indian accented sanskrit (and therefore best avoided)? Or is it technically permissible?
Example - Challakere brothers who are considered the gold standard do introduce the half maatra (even a full maatra perhaps for visargAnta and halanta shlokas) as in ....

Are both manners of pronunciation acceptable? Is there any pANini sUtra or prAti-shAkhya rule dealing with this issue?

Not merely a good practice, it is essential to follow sandhi rules. Sandhi is nitya in poetry.
Why? Otherwise there would be chandobhanga. It is said that it is okay if there is a mistake in vyakarana , but there should be no mistake in chandas.Chandas is like devata and is held to be powerful in its own right without reference to the content.

Generally, BG shloka contains 4 pAdAs with each having 8 syllables. So, while chanting, 
we give a short pause at 8th and resume. There are exceptional shlokas that have more than
32 syllables and proper pause has to be followed. 

It is always a good practice to follow the sandhi rules as the chanting evokes a sense of 
rythm (गीता सुगीता कर्तव्या)

2nd option is more naive which is taught to kids. 3rd seems to be good. 

The Gita Press has recently published the 'सरल गीता that has markings where to pause.

Regs,
Sriram
