Namaste,

Generally, BG shloka contains 4 pAdAs with each having 8 syllables. So, while chanting, 
we give a short pause at 8th and resume.  There are exceptional shlokas that have more than
32 syllables and proper pause has to be followed.  

It is always a good practice to follow the sandhi rules as the chanting evokes a sense of 
rythm (गीता सुगीता कर्तव्या)

2nd option is more naive which is taught to kids.  3rd seems to be good.  

The Gita Press has recently published the 'सरल गीता that has markings where to pause.

Regs,
Sriram
