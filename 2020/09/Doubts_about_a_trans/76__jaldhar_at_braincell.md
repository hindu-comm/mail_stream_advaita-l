There is a shloka

tumburubharataparvatadevalAdayaH |
surAshcha te brahmAdiputratvAdR^iShyashcha ||

which I have translated as:

"Tumburu, Bharata, Parvata, Devala etc. being the sons of Brahma and 
others, are both Devas and Rshis.

It seems simple enough but I have a nagging feeling the translation is 
inaccurate.  Can anyone confirm or deny?
