Sadara praNAmam,
Saundarya Lahari is unusually vast and deep.
Hence there is no question of the best bhashya.
Each commentary is centered around a particular aspect.
Seen a work with 11 sanskrit commentaries and
English translation and notes edited and published
by Kanchi Kamakoti peetam.In it also, Lekshmi Dhara's
commentary is given as the first.
As far as English commentaries are concerned
the one by Pt.S Subramanya Sastri published by
Theosophical Society, Adayar is an excellent one.
Lectures by Sampoojya Chandrashekharendra Saraswati Swamikal
translated to English and published by Bhavan's gives many
aspects not touched by most of the Sanskrit authors.
