[Archive link](https://lists.advaita-vedanta.org/archives/advaita-l/2020-September/055526.html)

 Someone pointed out that the link to article #7 doesn't work. The link does indeed work
if the URL is typed and pasted directly on the browser:

http://svbf.org/wp-content/uploads/tattvabodha/7_Tattvabodha_jivaishvara Aikyam.pdf

However, since there is unfortunately a gap (space) on the above URL, it doesn't go
through when clicked on, so it can be modified as such:

http://svbf.org/wp-content/uploads/tattvabodha/7_Tattvabodha_jivaishvara%20Aikyam.pdf

The tattvabodha series in Chaturamnaya or Advaita-l hasn't been completed, but the
articles are complete in the set of links sent out previously (below).

Kartik

The name is actually Jayanarayanan ;-)

All the Tattvabodha material was once downloadable from the following link, but I see that it
doesn't work anymore:

http://svbf.org/wp-content/uploads/tattvabodha/

However, the links to the individual articles still work:
