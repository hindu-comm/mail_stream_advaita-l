Which is the 'supreme deity as approved in Advaita?

The terms 'anya devataa' in the Bh.Gita and 'devataantara' in the
Anandagiri commentary together raises the question as to 'which is that
non-anya deity in Advaita'?

Here are many passages from the prasthana traya bhashya and
Sureshwaracharya's vartika and Anandagiri's commentary that helps us
determining the above question.  In essence: the 'devataa' of Advaita is
Pure Consciousness and everything other than that is 'anya'.

I have not given the translation of the passages below.
