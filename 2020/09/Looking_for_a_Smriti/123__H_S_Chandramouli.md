Namaste.

I cited the Suta Samhita verse in response to the following two
observations by you in previous posts

<< This is interesting.  What I recalled is the Kaivalyopanishat mantra:
उमासहायं परमेश्वरं प्रभुं त्रिलोचनं.....which is somewhat close to the
context of the Kena mantra/bhashyam >>

And << Until we get the exact reference of the passage as cited by Shankara
(‘विद्यासहायवानीश्वरः’ इति स्मृतिः ।) >>.

The quote from Suta Samhita being very close to what you have cited from
kaivalyopanishad and is from smruti, I thought it could be what you were
looking for.
