Here is another involving talk:   https://youtu.be/G7L5UfDGSnY
The speaker, a veritable Tamil scholar, takes us on a tour of the
Kailas-Manasarovar arduous trip.  He makes it extremely interesting by
copious quotations from the Tamil literary works.  There is Vedanta,
wisdom, wit, and what not.  A really enjoyable talk.
