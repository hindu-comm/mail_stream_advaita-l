In this short talk, the very well read speaker Ilangai Jeyaraj, makes some
observations that are Vedanta friendly.

1.  That human life is falsity-oriented.  This reminds one of the problem
of adhyasa, mithyatva, of jivatvam/samsara.

2.  That there are so many ways through which one can attain the Supreme is
told by Sri Sureshwaracharya:  यया यया भवेत्पुरंसां व्युत्पत्तिः
प्रयगात्मनि...[By whichever way one gains the right knowledge of the Atman,
that way alone is falwless for him and there is simply no limit for those
ways.
