Salutations to Prof. VK. I met prof. VK first online through his posts on Advaitin list and latter met personally in Chennai when I was doing a sabbatical at IIT-Madras during 99-2000. He, in fact, organized my talk at the Sanskrit College in Chennai at that time. He joined us as a moderator of the list. We met again in Washington DC when he came with Smt. VK. He even attended my Vedanta Class at Durga Temple at that time. It has been a long and very friendly encounter and I learned a lot from him. He had gone through my books - 'Journey Beyond: A Non-dual Approach' and wrote a review on that.

 Here is a link to a continuous text on 'Advaitamritam', a section of the larger book 'Gitamrita mahodadhi' authored by Br.Sri Viswanatha Iyer, the revered father of Prof VK ji. It is with the latter's untiring efforts did the manuscript see the light of publication.

One can greatly benefit by reading these pages that condense the sublime message of the various Upanishads.
