The Paramahamsopanishat, a sannyasopanishat, is available here, in four
pages:

In the fifth chapter (विद्वत्संन्यासप्रकरणम्) of the Jivanmukti Viveka,
Swami Vidyaranya takes up this Upanishad and writes a complete commentary
throughout the chapter.  While comparing Swami Vidyaranya's reading with
the version given in the link above, it is found that there are very minor
variations.  The commentary is full of citations from shruti and smriti
texts making the study very fulfilling.
