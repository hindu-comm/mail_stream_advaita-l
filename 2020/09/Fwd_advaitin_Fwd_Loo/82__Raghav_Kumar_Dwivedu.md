Namaste Subbuji
Thanks for sharing that concordance to 223 Upanishads. Many of these
non-bhAShya Upanishads are not yet available in a searchable format, I
think.

It's interesting that even the second lines have been given separate
entries most of the time. For example,

आत्मना विन्दते वीर्यं gets an independent entry as also गतासूनतासूश्चं ,
but for some reason
तेन त्यक्तेन भुञ्जीथाः and other second lines not have an entry against
them. Perhaps I am missing something?

Om
Raghav
