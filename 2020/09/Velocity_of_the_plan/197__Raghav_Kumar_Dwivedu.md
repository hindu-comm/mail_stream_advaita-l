Namaste Pradyumna ji
Yes I understand the astronomical treatise Arybatiya (c.500 AD) text talks
of a heliocentric model of the solar system with elliptical planetary
orbits. Looks like this model was not built upon or propagated further by
his successors.

Look forward to your other studies too.

Thank you
Om
Raghav
