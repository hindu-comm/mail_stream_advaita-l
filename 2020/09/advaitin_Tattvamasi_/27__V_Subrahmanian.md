The Advaitin community are thankful to Sri Venkataraghavan for this series
of his study of the analogies involved in the Upanishadic teaching of the
Tattvamasi mahavakya.  it is not easy to fathom the intricacies of the
polemical arguments underlying this study.  Our following this series will
help enhance our appreciation of the Tattva involved in these analogies.
