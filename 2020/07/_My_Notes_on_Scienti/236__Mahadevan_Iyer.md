praNAms Sadananda sir,

     I haven't completely watched this video yet. But I have watched some 
old videos of Donald Hoffman on Robert Lawrence Kuhn's excellent CLOSER 
TO THE TRUTH series ( https://bit.ly/31e73ei ). I think what Donald 
Hoffman subscribes to is some form of idealism. There is an article 
about it, https://bit.ly/30kyS5o .

I only made short notes. Maybe the link was not rendering well. I will 
post it on the next post.

om tat sat

Mahadevan Iyer
