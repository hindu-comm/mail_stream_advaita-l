Namaste Durga Prasad ji, or anyone else.

Has anyone been able to make the right sequence of playlist for these
videos of Brahmashri Maniji available? I have failed across a couple of
attempts to get it right as it is erroneous beyond names and dates. Before
I put in a last effort which is further too time-consuming, it would help
if someone who has already done it shares the same.

Also does anyone know if there was anything covered beyond the
anumAna-parichCheda?

Kind rgds,
--Praveen R. Bhat
