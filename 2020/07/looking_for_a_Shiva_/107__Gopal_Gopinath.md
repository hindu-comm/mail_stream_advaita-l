 Harih Om

In a book by shri Anjaneyulu named as Siva-puranam, available as ebook at
TTD site, the author sites a sloka on Siva purportedly rendered by Vishnu.
The lyrics from the book are given below but it is a small part of what
appear to be a long verse  I have listed from recording at kanchi math.
Could someone kindly point to the source of this enchanting verse and if
possible, the whole text:

Bhukti-mukti-divya-bhoga-daayine Namah Sivaaya
Sakti-Kalpita-prapancha-bhaagine Namah Sivaaya|
Bhakta-sankata-apahaara-yogine Namah Sivaaya
Yukta-sanmanah-saroja-yogine Namah Sivaaya||

thanks,
..gopal gopinath
