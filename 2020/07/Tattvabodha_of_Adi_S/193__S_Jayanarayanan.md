Maybe I'm missing something here, because "prANa" is simply the air that one
takes into one's body by breathing in. It is believed that if one can control
the rhythm of this breathing, the control of one's mind becomes easy. This is
something that is "realized" by the practice of prANAyAma.

Hence I don't see any reason to elaborate on the *existence* of prANa.
