The word "PrANAyAma" is undoubtedly derived from the word "prANa", and is an
extremely important practice among those performing Vedic Kriyas. Here's a
detailed explanation of the practice of PrANAyAma by Ramana Maharshi in His
famous book "Self-enquiry":

 "Pranayama: According to the measures prescribed in
 the sacred texts, exhaling the vital air is rechaka, inhaling is
 puraka and retaining it in the Heart is kumbhaka. As regards
 ‘measure’, some texts say that rechaka and puraka should be
 equal in measure, and kumbhaka twice that measure, while
 other texts say that if rechaka is one measure, puraka should
 be of two measures, and kumbhaka of four. By ‘measure’ what
 is meant is the time that would be taken for the utterance of
 the Gayatri mantra once. Thus pranayama consisting of
 rechaka, puraka, and kumbhaka, should be practised daily
 according to ability, slowly and gradually. Then, there would
 arise for the mind a desire to rest in happiness without moving.
 After this, one should practise pratyahara."

If the word "prANa" in the above passage is taken to be anything other than
the standard meaning of "breathing", then the words like "rechaka" (exhalation),
"kumbhaka" (retention) or "pUraka" (inhalation) don't make any sense.

There could be a secondary meaning of the word "prANa" according to context,
meaning "Life-force". IMHO, it's the same prANa that one inhales imparting
energy to other parts of the body. To give a modern analogy, the oxygen that
is inhaled into the lungs is absorbed by the blood and transferred to other
parts of the body offering nourishment. In this sense, it is a "life-force".
