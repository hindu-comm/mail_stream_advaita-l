Namaste Kartik ji

In the tradition the five aspects of PrANa, viz.,  prANa, apAna, vyAna,
samAna and udAna are sUxma meaning not directly perceptible by the senses
being part of the rajo-amshaH of the five tanmatras which are subtle.

The air we breathe on the other hand is regarded as a sthUla bhUta (gross
element) and is derived by grossification of the tanmatras.

So I understand the five prANa-s to be the five powers which keep the body
physiology ticking in an intelligent, integrated way.

 Such a working of the body cannot be fully explained using the old physics
which imagined atoms etc., to be like billiard balls following
well-understood laws. But unfortunately most doctors and medical
researchers today are still stuck with 19th century physics in their
assumption that simple laws of molecular chemistry can explain away
everything about the body.

The traditional postulate of prANa in sAMkhya and vedAnta darshanas is the
first major divergence that vedic traditions have with modern science. When
it comes to the other still more inner koshas of manas, buddhi etc., they
are even more divergent with modern reductionistic understanding of nature
and the human being.

Since prANa represents that first point of divergence, I was examining the
idea. You may note that the next significant divergence is the denial of
the need to postulate anything like chidAbhAsa. In other words, for
reductionist science there is nothing special about the physical
configuration of the brain and the nerves etc., which make the physical
entity capable of manifesting chidAbhAsa while a chair or a stone cannot do
so. That distinction is denied by science while bhagavatpAda accepts that
while both the human organism and a stone are both (jaDa) matter, still,
just as a mirror/polished surface has a special capacity to reflect light,
the human upAdhi although material, still has something special about it
that allows it to catch the reflection of all-pervading Chit.

Om
Raghav
