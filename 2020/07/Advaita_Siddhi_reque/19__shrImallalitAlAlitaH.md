Raghav,
This is a totally different thing.
What you presented says that AtmA is neither विदित nor अविदित and is साक्षी
of all वृत्ति.
While siddhiH is telling that AtmA is known through eyes, since it is
perceivable by all instruments. The contradiction comes next, when the
other chapter tells that the sattva which is opposed to mithyAtva can not
be defined, etc.
Chandamouli,
That is unrelated too.
You are saying that सत् part of knowledge is प्रमा and घट part is
ignorance(you must say illusion, instead of ignorance though).
That was not the base of contradiction.

These confusions and this type of unclarity is based on not seeing the
original chapters of siddhiH.
I hope you see there first, then find the contradiction and then come back
to understand my reply, if needed.

I hope this is enough for this thread.
