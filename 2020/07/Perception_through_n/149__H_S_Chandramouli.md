Namaste Sudhanshu Ji,

Darkness is bhAvarUpa. Yes. It is a veil. It is destroyed by
Light/PrakAsha. This destruction of the veiling lasts as long as
Light/PrakAsha exists. Once this is absent, the veiling by darkness
obtains. The intensity of the veiling also depends upon the relative
strengths of the darkness and light. This is the nature of the veiling by
darkness.

Visual perception is dependent upon the strength/extent of veiling by
darkness other things remaining constant. And this is extended to the whole
ambience from the perceiver to the object of perception. Not necessarily
limited to that at the location of the object.When this is changed, for
example by way of night glasses, visual perception also changes because the
level of veiling is changed. When an opaque obstacle is placed between the
perceiver and the object, vision of the object is completely lost
irrespective of the level of light at the location of the object.

If it is abhAvarUpa, does it change this position?
Regards
