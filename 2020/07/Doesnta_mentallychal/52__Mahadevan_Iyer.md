Pranams Atman,

Doesn'ta mentallychallenged person deserve Moksha in this lifetime ?
In such cases, can bhakthi be analternative to Brahmajnanam ?
Does the biggest of the bhaktas have to be born again for attaining 
Brahma-Jnana ?

If not, this implies, some people, by birth, have no scope for Moksha in 
their lifetime. This further implies that, there is no free will.

What kind of previous janma karma makes a person take a birth with no 
scope for Moksha ?

OM TAT SAT.
