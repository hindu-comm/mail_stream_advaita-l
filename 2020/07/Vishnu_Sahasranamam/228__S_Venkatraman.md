Namaste to all,

An year or two ago, there was discussion On this forum on how the shlokas preceding and succeeding the Sahasranamam proper came into the tradition of chanting. I tried to locate them but could not. I will be grateful to anyone who can point to their location to the Advaita-l archives. 

Many thanks and regards,
Venkat
