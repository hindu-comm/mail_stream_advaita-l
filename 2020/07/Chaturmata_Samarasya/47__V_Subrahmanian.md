Mahamahopadhyaya Sri Polakam Rama Sastri lived in the last Century. He has
written a book 'Chatur mata saamarasyam' (Sanskrit) wherein he has listed
50 common points across the four schools: Dvaita, Advaita, Vishishtadvaita
and Srikantha mata.  He has also specially shown the concordance between
Dvaita-Advaita and Advaita-Vishistadvaita. The present file, in Sanskrit,
of 36 pages, is available here:
