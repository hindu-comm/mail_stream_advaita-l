Dear Sir,

I think Mandukya Upanisad with Gaudapada’s Karika translated by Swami Lokeswarananda and published by The Ramakrishna Mission Institute of Culture, Gol Park, Kolkatta should meet the requirements stated by you. If you shared your email address with me, I can send a few scanned pages of the book for you to satisfy yourself.

Regards,
Venkat

In other words not translate Sanskrit terms into English equivalent,  but keeping them as they are and explaining it in English. I also would like the Sanskrit verse broken into pada, that is the sandi broken.
