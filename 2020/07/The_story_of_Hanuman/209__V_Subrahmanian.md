It is well known that in the popular Hanuman Chalisa there is the name
'Sankara's son'.  He has also said that in the Vinayapatrika

The Shiva Purana too says so, as reported.  In this long chapter, 79, of
the Narada Purana, there is a story of Hanuman as told by Rama himself.
Maybe this could be the inspiration to Tulasidas to hold Hanuman to be
Shiva's amsha/son. The story portrays Hanuman as a great devotee, very well
praised by all, including Rama.  The original Purana chapter is here:

The entire chapter is available in English translation here:

There is a Hanuman Kavacha in the earlier chapter, number 78.

The Taarasaara Upanishad too identifies Shiva and Hanuman.
