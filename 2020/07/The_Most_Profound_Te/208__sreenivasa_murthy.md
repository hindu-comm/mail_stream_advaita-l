Dear friends,Here is profound teaching which is the essence of all upanishads.
When Pure Consciousness assumes the form of empiricalconsciousness on the one hand and of the objectiveworld on the other it imposes on both the marks of their unmistakablesubstratum or base, viz., itself. Empirical consciousness cognizes itsobject as real and the object on its part appears as real. For, reality isimmanent in both and is indivisibly one. Even the antithetical nature ofsubject and object cannot create a division in Pure Consciousness, which astimeless transcends both and yet underlies both.
Pure Consciousness means Brahman, Bhuma, Purusha, Atman, 
one's True nature
With respectful namaskars,Sreenivasa Murthy
