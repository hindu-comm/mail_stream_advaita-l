 Dear Sri Shriniva Gadakari,
You write :"When likes of Vishnu and Shiva are engaged in sAdhanA that spans yuga-s to understand
and perfect atma jnAna".Is it a fact? How do you know it?


Please permit me to draw your kind attention to the 
following commentary of Sr i shankara to shloka 50 of 18th chapter- Bhagavadgita.It reads thus :
avidyAkalpitanAmarUpaviSEShAkArApahRutabuddhInAm 
atyantaprasiddhaM suvijnEyam asannataram, AtmaBUtamapi,aprasiddhaM durvijnEyam atidUram, anyadiva ca 
pratiBAti avivEkinAm |bAhyAkAranivRuttabuddhInAM tu 
labdhagurvAtmaprasAdAnAm nAtaH paraM suKaM 
suprasiddhaM suvijnEyam svAsannataram asti ||
I followed only the pointers pointed by Sruti and 
as explained by Sri Shankara only to cognize one'strue nature and what I have found within myself 
 I have stated in my posting.
You can draw your own right conclusionsin the light of the above teaching of Sri Shankara.

With respectful namaskars,Sreenivasa Murthy

 Namaste,

When likes of Vishnu and Shiva are engaged in sAdhanA that spans yuga-s to understand
and perfect atma jnAna - may be, things are slightly more complex than what is written below.

Regards,
Shrinivas

Dear friends,Mantra 1-2-12 of Kathopanishad teaches 
the methodology for cognizing one's true 
nature within oneself by oneself.It states :adhyAtmayOgAdhigamEna dEvaM matvA dhIrO harShaSOkau jahAti || 

What is adhyAtmayOga?Sri Shakara in his commentary to 
the above mantra writes:cEtasa Atmani samAdhAnam adhyAtmayOgaH ||
That is all a student of Vedanta who 
wants to be an Atmavit has to do.Nothing more, nothing less.

This is the same as AtmasaMsthaM manaH kRutvA 
as taught in Bhagavadgita.
With respectful namaskars,Sreenivasa Murthy
