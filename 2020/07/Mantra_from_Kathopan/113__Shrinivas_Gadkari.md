Namaste,

When likes of Vishnu and Shiva are engaged in sAdhanA that spans yuga-s to understand
and perfect atma jnAna - may be, things are slightly more complex than what is written below.

Regards,
Shrinivas

Dear friends,Mantra 1-2-12 of Kathopanishad teaches 
the methodology for cognizing one's true 
nature within oneself by oneself.It states :adhyAtmayOgAdhigamEna dEvaM matvA dhIrO harShaSOkau jahAti || 

What is adhyAtmayOga?Sri Shakara in his commentary to 
the above mantra writes:cEtasa Atmani samAdhAnam adhyAtmayOgaH ||
That is all a student of Vedanta who 
wants to be an Atmavit has to do.Nothing more, nothing less.

This is the same as AtmasaMsthaM manaH kRutvA 
as taught in Bhagavadgita.
With respectful namaskars,Sreenivasa Murthy
