Dear ShriSreenivasa Murthy,

Based on my understanding:
- Understanding, realizing and experiencing the para tattva - "consciousness" that animates us,
 is no doubt a very important milestone in the journey.
- However, in my view, the "real journey" STARTS after this milestone is achieved.
- The journey beyond this milestone is "integrating" this understanding with every aspect of life.
- And this, in my view, is the most interesting phase - and the perfection in this phase of the
 journey is only "asymptotically" attainable.

Thanks and regards,
Shrinivas Gadkari

Dear Sri Shriniva Gadakari,

You write :"When likes of Vishnu and Shiva are engaged in sAdhanA that spans yuga-s to understand
and perfect atma jnAna".
Is it a fact? How do you know it?



Please permit me to draw your kind attention to the 
following commentary of Sr i shankara to shloka 50 of 18th chapter- Bhagavadgita.
It reads thus :

avidyAkalpitanAmarUpaviSEShAkArApahRutabuddhInAm 
atyantaprasiddhaM suvijnEyam asannataram, AtmaBUtamapi,
aprasiddhaM durvijnEyam atidUram, anyadiva ca 
pratiBAti avivEkinAm |
bAhyAkAranivRuttabuddhInAM tu 
labdhagurvAtmaprasAdAnAm nAtaH paraM suKaM 
suprasiddhaM suvijnEyam svAsannataram asti ||

I followed only the pointers pointed by Sruti and 
as explained by Sri Shankara only to cognize one's
true nature and what I have found within myself 
I have stated in my posting.

You can draw your own right conclusions
in the light of the above teaching of Sri Shankara.

With respectful namaskars,
Sreenivasa Murthy

Namaste,

When likes of Vishnu and Shiva are engaged in sAdhanA that spans yuga-s to understand
and perfect atma jnAna - may be, things are slightly more complex than what is written below.

Regards,
Shrinivas

Dear friends,Mantra 1-2-12 of Kathopanishad teaches 
the methodology for cognizing one's true 
nature within oneself by oneself.It states :adhyAtmayOgAdhigamEna dEvaM matvA dhIrO harShaSOkau jahAti || 

What is adhyAtmayOga?Sri Shakara in his commentary to 
the above mantra writes:cEtasa Atmani samAdhAnam adhyAtmayOgaH ||
That is all a student of Vedanta who 
wants to be an Atmavit has to do.Nothing more, nothing less.

This is the same as AtmasaMsthaM manaH kRutvA 
as taught in Bhagavadgita.
With respectful namaskars,Sreenivasa Murthy
