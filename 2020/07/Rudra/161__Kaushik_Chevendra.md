How is Rudra perceived in yajurveda other than shatarudriya.
Yajurveda 1.8.6d
एक एव रुद्र न द्वितीयाय तस्थुर्...
Eka eva rudra na dvitīyāya tasthur...

ie., *Rudra is truly one* for the knowers of Brahman do not admit the
existence of a second.
This same verse is repeated in svethavastaraha Upanishad and atharvasiras
as well.



यो रुद्रो अग्नौ यो अप्सु य ओषधिषु । यो रुद्रो विश्वा भुवना विवेश तस्मै
रुद्राय नमो अस्तु ।। (YajurVeda 5.5.9)

*The Rudra in the fire, in the waters, in the plants, the Rudra that hath
entered all beings, to that Rudra be homage.*

*Here Rudra is everywhere and everything.*

*Who is this Rudra ? Is he lord shiva(agni in Vedas)?*

*Atharva veda 7.87*
योऽग्नौ रुद्रो योऽप्स्वन्तर्य ओषधीर्वीरुध आविवेश ।
य इमाविश्वा भुवनानि चक्लृपे तस्मै रुद्राय नमोऽस्त्वग्नये ।।

*To Rudra in the fire, to him who dwells in floods, to Rudra who hath
entered into herbs and plants, To him who formed and fashioned all these
worlds, to him this Rudra, yea, to Agni, reverence be paid!*

*Who is the reason for liberation in Vedas?*

*Athrvaveda-*

भवाशर्वौ मन्वे वां तस्य वित्तं ययोर्वामिदं प्रदिशि यद्विरोचते।
यावस्येशाथे द्विपदो यौ चतुष्पदस्तौ नो मुञ्चतमंहस ।। (AtharvaVeda 4.28)

Everything that shines is under your control Oh Bhava and Sarva. *Oh Isha
you are the lord of all two footed and four footed, Deliver us from grief
and trouble.*

In yajnvalkya smriti mitaksara commentary states than any Vedic verse
recited without knowing the metre , rishi and diety doesn't give fruit. The
above all verse are addressed to Rudra devata alone.

ईशानादस्य भुवनस्य
īśānādasya bhuvanasya (RigVeda 2.33.9)

*who is Lord of the Universe.*

भुवनस्य पितरम्
bhuvanasya pitaram (RigVeda 6.49.10)

*Father of the Universe.*

न वा उ योषद् रुद्राद् असुरयम्
na vā u yoṣad rudrād asurayam (RigVeda 2.33.9)

*The strength of Godhead never departs from Rudra.*

सत्पतिं
satpatiṃ (RigVeda 2.33.12)

*Lord of the Existence.*

गाथपतिं
gāthapatiṃ (RigVeda 1.43.4)

*Lord of the Hymns.*

मेधपतिं
medhapatiṃ (RigVeda 1.43.4)

*Lord of the sacrifice.*


*The above verses too talk about Rudra only. Vedas mention the Rudra few
times but whenever he is mentioned he is always in the highest regard.
Vedas talk about all dieties as great. That is the greatness of Vedas all
gods are the manifestation of Brahman only. Each one engages in their
specific duties sustaining the universe. Showing puranic verse doens't
help. The priority is Shruthi>smriti>itihaas>puranas. So if puranas are
contradicting the Shruthi without any further doubt we can disregard it. So
if any purana talks about a diety less than others it's only to increase
the devotees bakthi alone. One cannot cherry pick verses from Vedas to
prove only supremacy of one God only. Every god is praised as supreme in
Vedas. *


*Now going further to understand who is this Rudra? We know Rudra manifests
through Prajapati and no further doubt about it. *

*Atharva veda 15.1*


1There was a roaming Vrātya. He roused Prajāpati to action.
2Prajāpati beheld gold in himself and engendered it.
3That became unique, that became distinguished, that became
   great, that became excellent, that became Devotion, that be-
   came holy Fervour, that became Truth: through that he was
   born.
4He grew, he became great, he became Mahādeva.
5He gained the lordship of the Gods. He became Lord.
6He became Chief Vrātya. He held a bow, even that Bow of
  Indra.
7His belly is dark-blue, his back is red.
8With dark-blue he envelops a detested rival, with red he pierces
   the man who hates him: so the theologians say.


The above is shiva alone any nuetral reader can understand.

I will conclude this by showing a puranic verse from varaha Purana a
"sattvika purana".
145.101.118-

*Narayana said-"The great lord shiva remains calm on my right side,who
really know this shiva knows me,*
*And those who know me know this shiva. Wherever Shiva is vishnu is also
there,and wherever vishnu is shiva is there".*

*The above verse are present in varaha Purana. These verses resemble the
verses of Mahabharata.*
*Now we can argue as shiva is antaryami of vishnu all verses of vishnu
belong to shiva only.*
*"Shivaya vishnu roopaya shiva roopaya vishnave"*
*Only an advaitin can understand this verses without twisting it in any
way.*

*I apologise if I made some mistake while writing this article. I am still
a kid and please correct me if any of these points are wrong.*
*Thank you very much.*
