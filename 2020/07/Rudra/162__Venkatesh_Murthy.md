Namaste

Advaitis believe Nirguna Brahman is the Only Truth. But it is for the
 devotees sake that Nirguna Brahma is taught as Saguna Brahma. This Saguna
Brahma can take any shape and form described in the Sastras. We dont argue
with Dvaitis and others who is the greatest God? Let them think Vishnu is
the greatest if it makes them follow the Bhakti Marga. Let Saivas think
Siva is the greatest if it makes them follow the Bhakti Marga. Nothing
wrong.

Among Advaitis also many people have a favorite God. They become very
devoted to that God. Some Advaitis become very devoted to Siva, some to
Durga, some to Ganesha, some to Krishna, some to Rama and so on.  Let them
do it.

This is all only like scratching the surface of the ocean. The depth is in
the Philosophy. If you want to dive deep into Advaita you have to think
about the below questions. Otherwise you will be only scratching the
surface and arguing against silly Dvaita theories. Kindly think about the
below questions. Many discussions have happened in the list before on the
questions. And they will happen in the future also.

How is the world Mithya? What is Mithyatva? Is there a difference between
waking state and dream? What is Avidya? Who has Avidya? Does Brahman have
Avidya? Does Jeeva have Avidya? Is there a seed Avidya or Moola Avidya? How
many Jeevas are there? Many  Jeevas? Only One Jeeva? What is the difference
between Ishwara and Jeeva? Does Ishwara have Avidya also? Who creates the
world? Is the world existing before I perceive it? Or does the world come
to existence when I perceive it? What is the role of Mind? Is Mind an organ
like the other organs? What is a mental Vrutti? What is Akhandakara Vrutti?
How does Brahma Jnana happen? Is it through hearing of the Vedic text only?
Or is it by repeating Sravana, Manana and Nidhidhyasana for a long time?
What is Jeevan Mukti? What is Avidya Lesha? Does the Jeevan Mukta still
have some Avidya Lesha? Or he is totally free of Avidya?

Other members may kindly add to the questions. There are other questions
also and I may add them later.
