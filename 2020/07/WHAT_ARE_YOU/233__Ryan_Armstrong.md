Namaste
When this knowledge is fully embraced, one reacts to what is directly
perceived - not what the mind presents.
Ideas of "my life" and "my actions" are gone from the mind.
The desire to "do things"  too does not manifest.

When the actions are performed thus, one see kindness having manifested by
the reactions of those served.
Here, these observations are often claimed by ahaMkAra and ideas of "I'm so
kind" are played with after the fact.
But the actual actions become effortless and free from ideas of results.

Of course this is all when the knowledge is fully embraced.
Kind Regards
Ryan
