Dear friends ?
What are you or What am I ?That is the ONLY Vital question for a mumukshu. 
The answer is:
The Self is Immutable.
While it is immutable, everything other 
than the Self is subject to change.The Self which is eternal awareness pervades, 
as it were, all the perishing functions of the mind.The Self is the WITNESS of the 
mental states like pleasure and pain.
The Self is the constant factor 
in all mental modifications 
 likememory, confusion, ignorance 
 and also in the different states of experience, 
viz. waking, dream and deep sleep.
The Self is not affected by anything external to it, 
whatever may be the state ofexperience.The Self is self-evident , self-luminous, 
self-existing and nirvikAri.
The Self is the unchanging WITNESS  to 
the thousand modifications of the intellect.
TheSelf (Viz. Brahman), the ultimate Reality, 
is one and non-dual, and is devoid of 
sajathiya , vijathiya and svagatha bhedha.THAT SELF ART THOU. 
 *

One, who is at this moment unaware of the above . 
if he cognizes it within oneself by oneself 
he will be an ATMAVIT or Jnani  for sure.It is so simple and direct.It is svasAkShikam and svAnuBavagamyam.
Why not do it and be kRuthArtas?
With respectful namaskars,Sreenivasa Murthy.
