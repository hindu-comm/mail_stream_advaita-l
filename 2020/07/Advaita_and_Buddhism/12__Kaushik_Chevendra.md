What are the major differences in Advaita and the nihlism school in
Buddhism.
In 2.2.28 of Brahma sutras the unreality of world was refuted. I read Shri
shankaras bhasya
but I couldn't completly understand. Can anyone please clarify what is the
difference in the budhism concept of unreality of world which was refuted
by vyasa and the unreality of world in Advaita.
