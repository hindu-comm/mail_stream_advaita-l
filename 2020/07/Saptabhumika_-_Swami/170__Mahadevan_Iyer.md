Pranams,

I am sharing my short notes on Sapta Bhoomika.

Sapta Bhoomika ( Seven Floors OR Seven Levels )
( As per Swami Paramarthananda Lecture on 05/07/2020 )

* Sapta Bhoomika Prakriya explains the process of MEDITATIVE BLISS.

* Extracted from Yoga Vasishta, Jeevan Mukti Viveka & Madhusudhana Geeta
Bhashyam.

THE SEVEN LEVELS 7️⃣

1. Shubhecha
2. Vicharana
3. Tanu Manasa
4. Sattva Pathi
5. Asamsakthi
6. Padartha Bhavaani
7. Turyaka

* Level 1,2,3,4 explains stages of  Liberation.


1️⃣ Level 1, Shubecha : Attaining Sadana Chatushtaya Sampathi.

2️⃣ Level 2, Vicharana : Shravanam & Mananam.

3️⃣ Level 3, Tanu Manasa : Nidhidyasanam.

4️⃣ Level 4, Sattva Pathi : State of Jnana Nishta & Sthira Prajna ( Attains
Jeevan Mukthi & the eventually Vidheha Mukthi. ). Gets Title - Brahmavid.


* Level 5,6,7 OPTIONAL PROJECT, only for Jeevan Muktha Jnani.

Project Explanation

Meditation on Self for attaining, " Special Spiritual Happiness ". This
type of Ananda is categorised as Prathibimba Ananda ( experiential
happiness). Hence, only available during the meditative state. But, this is
not Vishayananda ( objective happiness ). Hence cannot cause bondage.

Steps are HARD.

Step 1 : Take Sanyasa. ( Stop external transactions. )
Step 2 : Be Yogi.  ( Do Yoga Abyasa. Become an expert in Pathanjali's 8
step Astanga Yoga. )
Step 3 : Vasana Kshaya.  ( Stop internal transactions. )
Step 4 : Mano Nasha. ( Remove all objective thought. )

Attain Ability : To soak into one's own higher nature, in one's meditating
mind.

* This progress is represented as stages 5, 6 & 7 i.e Asamsakthi, Padartha
Bhavaani & Turyaka.

5️⃣ Level 5, Asamsakthi : Gets Title - Brahmavid Varaha. Remain in a
meditative state for a long time. Enjoy bliss. Limited waking state.
Voluntary waking up from samadhi.

6️⃣ Level 6, Padartha Bhavani : Gets Title - Brahmavid Variyyaan. Remain in
a meditative state for a longer time. No Voluntary waking state, because of
overwhelming bliss experience. Need an external entity to interfere to get
into the waking state.

7️⃣ Level 7, Turyaka : Gets Title - Brahmavid Varishta. Remain in a
meditative state all the time. Oblivious. No waking state. Even an external
entity cannot bring back into the waking state. Connection with the
material world is broken. Next Videha Mukti.

Important : In the last 4 stages Brahmavid, Brahmavid Varaha, Brahmavid
Variyyaan & Brahmavid Varishta there is no  gradation in either Self
Knowledge or Fulfillment.

Poornam,

Mahadevan Iyer
