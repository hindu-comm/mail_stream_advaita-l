All these schools of philosophy were taught by realized masters. They are
all talking about the same truth. However, when they verbalized it, they
did so in a way that it tackles the problem the student in front of them
was currently facing. When these teachings were compiled they seem to form
different schools of thought, which in reality are none other than rungs of
a ladder every student goes through.

Pranamam.
