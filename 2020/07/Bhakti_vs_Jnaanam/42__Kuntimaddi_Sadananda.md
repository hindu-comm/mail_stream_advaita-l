 PraNAms
In response to recent discussions on bhakti vs Jnaanam.
Bhakti should culminate with jnaanam and jnaanam should inculcate Bhakti.
Krishna says this in the 6th Ch. in two consequent slokas.
>From the Bhakti point - yo maam pasyati sarvatra sarvanca mayi pasyati..and from Jnaana point
sarva bhuutastam aatmaanam sarva bhuutanica aatmani.
In the third ch. He only mentions Karma yoga and Jnaana yoga -Bhakti yoga is not mentioned. Lokesmin dvidhaa nishTaa puraa proktaa mayaanaghaa, jnaana yogena saamkhyaanam, karma yogena yoginaam.
The reason is Bhakti is an essential ingredient for both karma yoga and jnana yoga.Shankara defines Bhakti in the Vivekacudamani.
moksha kaarana saamaagryaam bhaktireva gareeyasi, sva svaruupaanu sandhaanaam bhaktirityabhideeyate.
Hari Om!
