Vedantasara of Shri Sadananda is helpful to understand the Advaita Vedanta
darshana. It has many commentaries. Among them Vidvanmanoranjani is most
important one.

Dr. Ganesh Ishwar Bhat, one of the eminent scholars in the field of Vedanta
will teach this text.

We have come up with its first episode.
