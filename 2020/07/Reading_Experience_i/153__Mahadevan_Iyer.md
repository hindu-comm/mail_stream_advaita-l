Pranams,

In the Advaita List website, "
https://www.advaita-vedanta.org/archives/advaita-l/ " it was hard to read
messages. Some lines were very long and needed to scroll horizontally.

So I wrote a small script that improves the reading experience from the
website. I am sharing it here.

IMPROVEMENTS

1. Word Wrap. ( No need to horizontally scroll. )
2. Better Readable Font. ( https://www.lexend.com/ )
3. Larger Font Size.
5. Search Engine.

This is an external script, it does not modify the website. It acts as a
wrapper over the original website. So some installations are required.

It works on most new desktop browsers like Chrome, Firefox, Edge etc.

INSTALLATION

1. Download the "Tampermonkey" extension for your browser. (
https://www.tampermonkey.net/ )

2. Install Script from :
https://openuserjs.org/scripts/mahadevaniyer/Advaita_List_Word_Wrap

OR
https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/406521-advaita-list-word-wrap

3. That's all. Goto https://www.advaita-vedanta.org/archives/advaita-l/ and
you should be able to see the change.
