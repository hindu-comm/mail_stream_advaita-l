Pranams Shri H S Chandramouli,

The extension itself does not cause any problem. But, the scripts that we
choose to install does.

Many such scripts are available to install for different websites. These
could be written by anyone. One should be careful while choosing the
scripts. Bottom line is that, If you don't trust the writer then you should
not install that script.

 You can read the source code before applying :
