I agree with this.
Bakthi in both the schools is different

'Essential' is the key word.

The nature of that essentiality differs drastically between two schools.

Advaitins while denying Ishvara-ness of Brahman as the final reality, still
hold bhakti is needed (in this vyavahAra) only for upAsana. nirguNamapi
sadbrahma naamaruupagataiH guNaiH saguNaM upasanaarthaM tatra tatra
upadishyate... (Shankara in BSB 1.2.14)

For Dvaitin, this essentiality is way different and at the core of seeking
mOksha. Acharya Madhva says “mokshashcha vishhNu-prasAdena-vinA na labhyate
“ (mOksha and other purushArthas are not obtained without Vishnu's
grace).This position is very much in tune with Rgvedic assertion 'tEna
vinaH truNamapi na chalti' etc. In this sense the bhakti is essential to
gain Brahman's ultimate prasAda. There are countless pramANa on this
position.

(By whose grace alone, the greatly suffering are rid of the world, and not
otherwise; He is NârâyaNa, the Supreme, and the one fit to be contemplated
upon by those who seek to be liberated from the binds of karma.)

(To the un-knowing, Vishnu gives knowledge; to the knowing, He gives
moksha; To the liberated, He gives joy, and He alone is fit for all to
worship.)

I am not saying HH. Pejawara Swamiji does not know all these when He said
what he said. I am only clarifying this similarity (between two schools) is
quite superficial.
