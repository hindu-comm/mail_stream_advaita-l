That is how tolerating Advaita Acharyas are.
They don't throw accusations and slurs on other schools of philosophy
though the theories might be refuted by them.

It is noteworthy what Swami Vidyaranya in the Taittiriya Upanishad
commentary says 'Even though all the darshanas (sankhya vaisheshika, yoga,
jaina, bauddha, pashupata, etc.) differ in their views on jiva, ishwara,
moksha, etc. the path of Yoga (which is the condensed name for bhakti,
vairagya, shama, dama, tyaga, daivi sampat, etc.) that is required in all
the schools to attain whatever goal they specify* is the same.* There is no
difference in this.'

subbu
