PraNAms - a jnaani may behave like a madman - as in the story of Hatamalaka, the disciple of Adi Shankara.
Hari Om!Sadananda

 Namaste,

It is not a question of whether anyone deserves moksha or not, it is a
question of whether one has the qualifications necessary for the rise of
jnAna because of which one realises that one is mukta.

If a discrimating intellect and / or control over the mind and sense organs
are lacking because of unfavourable prArabdha, then ipso facto, the
possibility of jnAna arising until those conditions persist, is low. That
prArabdha does not arise because of fate, but because of one's own previous
actions.

Under those circumstances, the performance of karma yoga wherein actions
are undertaken as an offering to Ishvara and results accepted as a prasAda
from Ishvara - without a motivation for results - is the only way forward
to earn the required qualifications. Whether one performs karma yoga or not
is up to them, so free will does exist.

Greater the unfavourable prArabdha, greater is the effort required to
overcome it, but again the quantum of effort exercised is dependent on the
individual's free will.

Bhakti is one of the ways of karma yoga.

Until bhakti culminates in sva svarUpa anusandhAnam - accepting and abiding
in one's own nature as consciousness - the bhakta will continue in samsAra.
That samsAra can be anywhere - in this, human world, or in the higher ones.
Until jnAna arises (whether here or elsewhere), samsAra will persist.
