Dear friends,
 The following writing is from the pen of a 
Jnani of the 20th century. It is a very profoundpointer. 
QUOTE:

When Pure Consciousnessassumes the form

of empirical consciousness on the one hand 

and of the objective worldon the other

it imposes on boththe marks of their 

unmistakablesubstratum or base,viz., itself. 

Empiricalconsciousnesscognizesits object 

as real andthe object on its partappears 

as real.For, reality is immanentin both and 

Is indivisibly one. Even the antitheticalnature 

ofsubject and object cannotcreate a division

in PureConsciousness, which as timeless
transcendsboth and yetunderlies both.Unquote.
PureConsciousness means Brahman, Bhuma, Purusha,Atman, 
one's True nature.
With respectful namaskars,Sreenivasa Murthy
