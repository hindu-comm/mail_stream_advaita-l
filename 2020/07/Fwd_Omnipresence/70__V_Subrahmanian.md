A few years ago there was a ten day workshop on Vivekachudamani at the
institution headed by the above Swamiji. On the concluding day during his
speech he said 'All the three Acharyas have emphasized the need for
Bhagavad bhakti.'  I was present at the venue.

One can also see that there are both hardliners and moderates in this
school too. There are those who do not believe in Maniman, etc. stuff even
though they adhere to their philosophy. On the other hand there are those
who still sing those tunes of their founding times often to the chagarin of
their own fellow folk. Not a word in admiration or appreciation of Shankara
or Advaita is to be ever entertained or spoken as per the hardliners. The
other category does not subscribe to this attitude.
