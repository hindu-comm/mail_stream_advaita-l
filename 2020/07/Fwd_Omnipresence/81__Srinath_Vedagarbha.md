I am not at all denying there are great bhaktas in advaita sampradaya,
however what is the real knowledge of such bhakta? Does he consider his
upAsya devata really out there with all such kalyana guNas? or such guNas
are mere adhyAropa on NB? If former, he is not 'sampradayavit'. If later,
such bhakti  cannot be comparable with dvaitin's and thus the similarity is
superficial.

I can only assume (please note I say I assume)  -- given the fact that late
HH was a great social reformer (along with being a great scholar in Dvaita
vedanta) and true to His leadership in social reforming task, He could have
said that in the spirit of unifying thri-mathastha sampradaya folks.
