One can see that what Shankara has said in BSB 2.3.41 is in no way wanting
in the need for the grace of Paramatma:

परस्मादात्मनः
कर्माध्यक्षात्सर्वभूताधिवासात्साक्षिणश्चेतयितुरीश्वरात्तदनुज्ञया
कर्तृत्वभोक्तृत्वलक्षणस्य संसारस्य सिद्धिः ; तदनुग्रहहेतुकेनैव च विज्ञानेन
मोक्षसिद्धिर्भवितुमर्हति । कुतः ? तच्छ्रुतेः |

For both samsara siddhi and moksha siddhi, the indispensable role of
Brahman is emphasized by Shankara on the basis of the shruti.

In the BGB too Shankara has said a similar idea while introducing the 15
Chapter:

यस्मात् मदधीनं कर्मिणां कर्मफलं ज्ञानिनां च ज्ञानफलम्, अतः भक्तियोगेन मां
ये सेवंते ते मम प्रसादात् ज्ञानप्राप्तिक्रमेण गुणातीताः मोक्षं गच्छन्ति ।

Karma phala is abhyudaya or jnana praapti yogyataa and jnana phala is
moksha.
