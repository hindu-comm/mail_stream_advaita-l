Just as a sons love for his father doesn't change with regards to the
father becoming old. The bakthas love for saguna isvara doesn't change
whatever the Rupam might be(saguna or nirguna) because it's not the
attributes that are important for his love.

As I said sir I am still a mumukshu but I have expressed my views.
Thank you
