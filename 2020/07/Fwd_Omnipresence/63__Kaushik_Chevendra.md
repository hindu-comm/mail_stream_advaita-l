Also in Upanishads realisation is seeing atman(isvara or self) everywhere.
Please shed light on this.

But regarding panchantantra sir?
Dvaitas accept panchantantra . But panchatantra says souls are created by
vasudeva.
Thank you.

Namaste

The Dvaitis say Ishwara is the One and Only Independent Reality. The world
and souls are also real but they are Dependent Reality. If the Srutis say
Brahman was only existing in the beginning it means  Brahman the
Independent was existing. But the world and souls were also existing along
with Brahman as Dependent realities.

Kindly study the Paradhina Visesapti Vada of Dvaita to see more details.
