Shankara explains thus:  सर्वं समस्तं जगत्* समाप्तोषि सम्यक् एकेन आत्मना
व्याप्नोषि यतः,* ततः तस्मात् असि भवसि सर्वः त्वम् , त्वया विनाभूतं न
किञ्चित् अस्ति इति अभिप्रायः ॥ ४० ॥   Brahman pervades everything by being
the One Self.  Therefore, there is nothing that is bereft of You.

The very sattaa of everything is because of this Brahman, Sat.
