No doubt Davita accepts pratyaksha as pramaNa, but do not forget
applicability (or otherwise) of physical laws only to the entities revealed
(siddha) by the same pratyksha. Ishvara is not pratyksha siddha tatva.
Given that fact, you just cannot apply physics law on to Ishvara.

Shruti says Brahman is Sarva ("pUrshEvEdam SarvaM" of puruShasUkta) . It
also says Brahman is sarvanteryamin.   Sarva does not mean "all this is
Brahman". The very meaning of sarva is clear in Geetha "savam samApnOshi
tatOsi sarvaha" (God is all because He is in all).

Sarva and Sarvanteryamin goes together, because anteryamitvaM needs niyamya
vastu. This is how Dvaita does samanya of those two shruti assertions of
Sarva and Sarvanteryamin

Hope this helps.
