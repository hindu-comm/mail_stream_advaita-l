In the Brahma vaivarta Purana  https://sa.wikisource.org/s/13lr    there is
a dialogue on Ekadashi fasting. A verse here is:

गृही शैवश्च शाक्तश्च ब्राह्मणो ज्ञानदुर्बलः ।।
प्रयाति कालसूत्रं च भुक्त्वा च हरिवासरे ।। ९ ।।

A householder Brahmana, not in the knowledge of things, by not observing
Ekadashi fasting, will end up in a horrible hell.

The statement on Shaiva/Shaktas being Brahmins is significant in the face
of malicious propaganda by some Vaishnavas that Brahmins can be only
Vaishnavas and nothing else. If someone is a non-Vaishnava he is clearly a
non-Brahmin.

Another verse there says that it is a sin to have food on Krishna
Janmashtami, Ramanavami and Shivaratri: The sin is double than eating on
Ekadashi

जन्माष्टमीदिने रामनवमीदिवसे हरेः।।
शिवरात्रौ च यो भुङ्क्ते सोऽपि द्विगुणपातकी ।। ११ ।।

Incidentally, the Purana holds Hari and Hara days on equal footing.

There are other do's and don'ts that are worth reading.
