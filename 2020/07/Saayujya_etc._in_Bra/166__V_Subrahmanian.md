As an offshoot of a discussion elsewhere, there arose an opportunity to
survey the Bhashya for the topic of 'sayujya' in Brahmaloka which is a part
of Krama mukti too. Some related topics also came up and here is a
compilation of the relevant bhashya, vyakhyana, Advaitasiddhi and some
other sources, in a file -

Translations of the Bhashya/vyakhyana/Advaita siddhi are not given. Since
references are given, those requiring translations may access them online.
