Pranams,
I came across this beautiful Tamil devotional poetry with deep meaning.

Song : https://bit.ly/kalamam

Kalamam Vanathil by Subramaniya Bharatiyar

🎶 Kaalamaam Vanathilandha
Kolamaa Marathin Meedhu
Kalishakthi Yendrapeyar Kondu
Reengaara Mittulavumoru Vandu 🎶

* In the Forest of Time
In the Tree of Cosmos
With the name of Kali Shakthi
Buzzes a Bee! *

🎶 Thazhal
Kaalumvizhi Neelavanna
Moola Athu Vaakalenum
Kaalgalaa Rudayadhenak Kandu
Marai Kaanumuni
Voruraithar Pandu 🎶

* With Flaming Eyes
In a hue of Blue
And the Vedas of yore
As her Six Limbs
Thus, claim the Sages
Who’ve seen the Truth! *

🎶 Melumaagi Keezhumaagi Verulath Thisayumaagi
Melumaagi Keezhumaagi Verulath Thisayumaagi
Vinnumannu Maanashakthi Vellam
Indha Vindhaiyella Maangadhu Sei Kallam 🎶

* She becomes the Above and the Below
And all other Directions
The Skies and the Earth are what
She floods as Pure Energy!
All these Wonders
Are but mischief that She manifests! *

🎶 Pazha Vedhama Yadhanumulla Naadhamai Vilangumindha
Veerashakthi Vellamvizhum Pallam -- Aaga
Vendum Nitha Menrenaezhai Ullam. 🎶

* As the Ancient Vedas
And as the Primordial Sound that predates them
This Unbridled Energy exists Fiery!
Let this Starved Heart be an abode
Where She flows unchecked into! *

🎶 Aadhiyanj Sivanumavan Sodhiyaana Shakthiyundhaan
Angumingu Mengumula Vaagum -- Onre
Yaagina Ulaganaithum Saagum -- Avai
Yanriyor Porulumillai, Anriyondru Millaiyidhai
Aaindhidil Thuyaramellam Pogum -- Indha
Arivuthaan Paramanyana Maagum 🎶

* Shiva, the Source of all, - and
Shakthi, the Flame that powers him
Together are what’s Here, There and Everywhere!

When they are Together
The Many Worlds of Illusion perish

Nothing is without Them
Nothing is dependent on them, either
Whoever reads into this, has No Misery
Knowing this, is the Ultimate Knowing *

🎶 Needhiyaa Marasuseivar Nidhigalpala Kodidhuipar
Neendakaalam Vaazhvartharai Meedhu -- Endha
Neriyumeidhu Varninaitha Podhu -- Andha
Nithamutha Suthaputha Sathaperung Kaalipadha
Neezhaladaindh Dhaarkillayo Theedhu -- Endru
Nermaivedham Sollum Vazhi Eedhu 🎶

* They shall Rule with Justice
With Wealth plenty, a long life on the Planet
And attain Mastery over any Wanted Skill
They who’ve sought refuge
In the Shadow of
The Eternally Supreme, Kali
Who’s Beyond the Mind

“This is the Way”
Say, the Vedas *
