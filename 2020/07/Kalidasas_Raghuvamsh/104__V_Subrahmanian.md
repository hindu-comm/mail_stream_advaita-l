In the above interpretation, Parvathipa = the Lord of Parvathi, Shiva.
Rameshvara = the Lord of Ramaa, Lakshmi, that is Narayana. So the namaskara
is to both Shiva and Vishnu. But the shloka also says that the namaskara is
to 'Pitarau', the parents. Shiva and Vishnu can only be Fathers, if one
insists on this interpretation. There will be no mother.   माता च पिता च =
पितरौ |  This is my understanding.
