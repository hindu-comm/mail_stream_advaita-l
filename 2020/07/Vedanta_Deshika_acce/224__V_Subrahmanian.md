In the Sribhashyam of Sri Ramanuja, after the 'mahaa purvapaksha' there is
the indictment of Shankara as follows:

//तदिदमौपनिषदपरमपुरुषवरणीयताहेुतुगुणविशेषविरहिणां
अनादिपापवासनादूषिताशेषशेमुषीकाणां
अनधिगतपदवाक्यस्वरूपतदर्थयाथात्म्यप्रत्यक्षादिसकलप्रमाणवृत्त-तदितिकर्तव्यतारूपसमीचीनन्यायमार्गाणां
विकल्पासहविविधकुतर्ककल्ककल्पितमिति
न्यायानुगृहीतप्रत्यक्षादिसकलप्रमणवृत्तयाथात्म्यविद्भिः अनादरणीयम् ।//


 There are the commentaries of Sudarshana Suri (shrutaprakashika) and
Vedanta Desika for the Sribhashyam.  The 'TattvaTeekaa' is the name of
Desika's commentary. There, for the 'indictment' part, he says:

परमपुरुषोक्तिः ईश्वरोत्तीर्णताव्युदासाय | अर्थात्
त्रिमूर्तिसाम्योत्तीर्णतादिपक्षापोहः |

[The term 'paramapuruSha' is to refute the idea of a transcendental
Ishwara, which extends to the refutation of the idea of Trimurti saamyam,
that is, holding the Triad of Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva as of the same
status, non-difference and an Ishwara who transcends the three.]

The direct reference to the above concept in Shankara's words can be seen
to be in the countless citations he has given in the Vishnu Sahasra Nama
bhashyam on the topic of Hari Hara abheda and Trimurti saamyam.  In that
very VSN bhashya, Shankara gives the following etymology to the name
'Keshava':  कश्च अश्च ईशश्च त्रिमूर्तयः केशास्ते यद्वशेन वर्तन्ते स केशवः ।

[Brahmā, Vishnu and Shiva are the trimūrti-s - all of whom are under the
control of that entity which is called Keśava.]

Also, the Sureshwaracharya's Vartika verse and its citing and explaining by
Anandagiri in the context of the Brahma Sutra Bhashya:

See also the fundamental difference between Shankara's Vishnu and that of
Ramanuja in this article where too the Turiya Ishwara and Trimurti Samyam
concept is discussed:

The Sribhashyam, in the context is citing the Adhyasa Bhashyam following it
with the above stated personal indictment of Shankara.Hence, the gloss of
Vedanta Desika is to be understood in the context of Shankara.
