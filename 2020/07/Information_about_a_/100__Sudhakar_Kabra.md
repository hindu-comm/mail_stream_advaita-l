Respected members,

I am looking for any book which gives a comparative study of different schools of vedanta, like advaita,vishistadvaita, shuddhadvaita, dvaita preferably not as siddhanta but as interpretation of aphorisms likeTat twam asi,/ aham brahmasmi / prama and bhrama etc.

Any reference will be appreciated. Both digital format (PDF downloads) or publishers in book format will help.
Thanks
Sudhakar kabra
