In dvaita philosophy there is a difference between jiva, isvara, matter,
doesn't this compromise the omnipresence of isvara.
If isvara alone existed in beginning and nothing else how was matter
created in dvaita philosophy? He has to create matter from himself only as
nothing else existed.
What is the dvaitas reply to the above questions?
