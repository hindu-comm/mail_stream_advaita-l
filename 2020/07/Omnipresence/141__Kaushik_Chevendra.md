Sir I had sent by mistake to your personal mail regarding your answers. Let
me ask them in the group again.
You have said that brahman  is not visible to eye so need not obey physical
laws.
But this means brahman is formless. If he has form he will be seen.
When brahman and matter are at the same place one can have form that is
matter but the other can't.
If you say brahman is having definite shape he will have to obey the laws
of physics and matter.
For defying physics brahman has to be formless,then there isn't any problem.
