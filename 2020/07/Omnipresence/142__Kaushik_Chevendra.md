In the vishwaroopam shown to arjuna. What did arjuna see? He saw the whole
universe as part of krishna. He didn't see krishna as a controller or
antaryami in it. He saw only the whole universe as a part of krishna. So
everything was non different and part of him alone. Hence even then the
omnipresence isn't compromised.
And even though  krishna had form externally the world was actually
pervaded by his formless aspect only.

When krishna, rama, vishnu had taken form they were visible to everyone.
So the form with which the Lord pervades the universe is something
different.



I am afraid of your logic.

I have already told this above.



I had also told that if he has form he will obey physical laws. Indeed
there is no limitation for him to obey the laws.
But as he is the controller of the universe all the rules are made by him
and under the authority of him only including religious and physical laws
also.
Just as krishna is jagadguru and is all knowing yet he goes to gurukula as
the law says so, only due to the respect to laws he has made and for the
sake of human kind.
The point I tried to make above is irrespective of visiblity , form,
however,minute it is, will obey physical laws.



Sorry if I have said something wrong.
