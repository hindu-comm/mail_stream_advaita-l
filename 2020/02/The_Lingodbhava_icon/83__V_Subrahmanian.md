The Lingodbhava iconography

The 16th century CE text ‘Shilpa Ratna’, a compilation of many details
about icons, murals, paintings, etc. from ancient works, talks of the
Lingodbhava iconography.  Lingodbhava is the event described in many
puranas where Rudra appeared in the incomprehensible form of mighty
effulgence in front of Brahma and Vishnu.  The latter, bewildered by this
sight, take the forms of a swan and a boar to fathom the contours of the
effulgence and move up the sky and dig down the earth.

Here are a few images from the Shilpa Ratna Part 2 and the Linga Purana
where the iconography is explained.
