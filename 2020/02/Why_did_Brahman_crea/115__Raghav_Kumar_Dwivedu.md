An addendum to one para i wrote -

1. Now we can examine  the validity of a modified statement viz.
, "the jIvAtmA is the locus of avidyA", i.e.,
 "brahman with vyaShTi-sharIra as the upAdhi is the locus of avidyA" - what
if any is the flaw in this statement?

The reason for asking is not to contradict the basic dictum under question
viz jiva is a later product so he cannot be the locus of avidyA. Apologies
if the previous para had that obvious problem.

Rather i was reminded of one acharya saying that while neither nirguNam
brahmA needs GYAnam nor does the jada shareeram/antahkaraNam need GYAnam ,
but the jIvAtma who is a mix-up of the two does indeed "need" GYAnam.
