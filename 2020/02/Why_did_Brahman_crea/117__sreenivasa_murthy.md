 Dear Sri Venkataraghavan and other participants in this dialogue,

Mantra 7-25-2 of Chandogya Upanishad says : 
AtmaivEdagam sarvam ||

Mantra 2-2-12 of Mundaka upanishad says :
brahmaivEdagM viSvaM variShTham ||

Let alone avidya ,The whole manifestation has YOU /Atman/ Brahman as locus.
Is it not so?
Now the question, Why did Brahman create the world , needs ammendment.
It should read "Why 'I' created the world?".
Hence it becomes evident that the questioner should go/refer to himself
for the answer . That is the only place to go to get an authentic answer.

With respectful namaskars,
Sreenivasa Murthy whose locus is Atman

 Namaste Raghav ji,
Subbuji's interpretation of nApi gocara: fits the Sloka better.

Essentially, the object of ignorance cannot be a product of ignorance
itself, because ignorance always presupposes its object - i.e the ignorance
is always 'of something', and that object cannot be the effect of
ignorance, which is logically posterior.

I had an alternative interpretation, which admittedly doesn't fit the
context as well as the above - viz., ignorance is not revealed by the mind,
its effect, but by the sAkshi. This was based on what sureshvarAchArya says
(in the naiShkarmyasiddhi quote I had provided in the email earlier) that
the effect itself is of the nature of ignorance, and therefore, ignorance
cannot experience ignorance by itself - तस्य हि स्वरूपमेवाज्ञानं न हि
स्वतोऽज्ञानस्याज्ञानं घटते ।

However, the interpretation of gocara: as viShaya in this context fits
better - the objective of the shArIrakAkAra here is to say that it is
nirguNa chaitanya that is the locus and object of ignorance.

Regards,
Venkatraghavan
