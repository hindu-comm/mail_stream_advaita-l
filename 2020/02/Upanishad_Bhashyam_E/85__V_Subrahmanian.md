Sri Swami Paramahamsananda Saraswathi based in Tiruvannamalai has started
publishing a series of books in Tamil on the Upanishads. A few months back
his Ishavasya commentary had come out. The commentary is based on Shankara
bhashyam. Swamiji takes up each Upanishad mantra, first gives a word for
word meaning and then the meaning of the whole mantra. Thereafter he takes
up the shankara bhashya on that mantra and by bite sized components of the
Bhashya gives the meaning in Tamil. So his Tamil interpretation follows the
Bhashya very closely. After this the Swamiji gives his own commentary
(Madhuvarshini) on the mantra. After completing the entire Upanishad and
the Bashya as above, Swamiji takes up Anandagiri's Tika on the Bhashya and
covers it the same way as the Shankara Bhashya itself. The Tika is followed
by Swamiji's commentary Amritavarshini.

Both the binding and the quality of the print is excellent. I cannot
recommend the book enough. It is just too good. I got the book from the
Swamiji himself. He is a very simple man and very easily approachable. His
number is 8838220164. you can talk to him directly in case you want to buy
a copy yourself. he knows mw as Venkatraman of Chennai.

Someone said:  Ishavasya is priced at Rs 500.  A few days back he came out
with Kena Upanishad and I got my copy yesterday. It is priced at Rs 700. I
am yet to go through it but from a quick browsing I have no doubts that it
will be as good as its predecessor.
