Is this a misprint in the book or is Hanumanji not worshipped with Vedokta mantras?  If there is a mantra, which one is it?

>  In hanuman temples here in Sourth India ( Bengaluru in particular) normally we use Rigvedeeya 'pavamAna sUkta' ( which has four adhyAya-s) for doing the abhishekham to hanuman.  Sometimes I have seen 'manyu sUkta' as well for doing pooja / abhishekam to Narasimha and hanuman.  

Your humble servant
Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
