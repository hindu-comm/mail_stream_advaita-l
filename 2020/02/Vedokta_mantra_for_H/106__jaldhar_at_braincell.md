I'm interested in historical study but for Dharmic purposes we have to 
look to shastra and sampradaya for valid pramanas.  After all from a 
strictly historical point of view, the very concept of Puja is from "a 
later period" than the yajnas etc. of the Vedas.

Unfortunately, neither Pavamana Sukta or Manyu Sukta are part of 
Shuklayajurveda and I do not want to recite any mantra I which I have not 
learned from gurumukha.

The mantras for Madhu abhisheka I do know.  However after I asked this 
question, I had a talk with one of uncles who said that my late 
Grandfather didn't recite any mantras for the parshads only the Pauranik 
shlokas such "manojavam tulyavegam" and "tikshna danshtra mahakaya" etc. 
So now it is a moot point anyway.

There's a couple of other questions people asked me which I'll answer 
here.

1.  Am I going to make this compilation available publically or can I have 
a copy?

Sorry, at the moment this is just for my personal use and to help me teach 
my son.

2. Why is Skanda Bhagavan not mentioned?

Gujaratis, North Indians etc. also do believe that Kartikeya is the son of 
Shiva Bhagavan but He is not regularly worshipped in Puja and the only 
mandir to Him in my home town was actually founded by expats from Kerala. 
I don't know why this has come about.

3. Why Dattatreya instead of Bhairava?

As I mentioned, historical reasons.  Several elders of my family were 
disciples of Ranga Avadhuta who was a famous saint of the early 20th 
century and the disciple of Swami Vasudevanand Saraswati, one of the 
greatest populizer of Dattatreya worship in modern times.

4. What is the shastric basis for this list of Parshads?

I don't know but I'd like to find out.  It is not based on Shaivagamas as 
practised by the Siddhanti Shaivas of South India.  The Shiva Purana also 
gives a (longer) list which is different.  But these are the attendants of 
Shiva Bhagavan as worshipped in every Shivalaya where I'm from.
