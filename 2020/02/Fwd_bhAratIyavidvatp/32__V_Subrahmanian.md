Namaste

Some months ago I had raised a question about the source of a verse said to
be in the Padma purana.  I had received replies, suggestions, etc. Now I
located the entire text of verses where that verse occurs. It is appended
at the end of the 12th Canto in the book Srimadbhagavatam with many
commentaries.

Some shlokas are highlighted by me below. The specific verse that I had
asked before is the 11th one below. The 62 verses are stated to be in the
Padmapurana.  If anyone finds these verses in the extant Padma Purana
editions, kindly let me know.  Thanks.
