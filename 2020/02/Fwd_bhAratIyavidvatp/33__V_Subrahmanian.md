Vijayananda ji

Namaste.

There are four 'vrittis' (usually vritti is the name given to the kind of
text that you desire) that I know of on the Brahmasutras from an Advaitic
point of view, but they are not really short.

Sadasivendra Saraswati's vritti is available at

Haridikshita's vritti -

Ramananda Saraswati's vritti called Brahmamritvarshini is available at
