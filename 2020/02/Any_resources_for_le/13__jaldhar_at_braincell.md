Apart from the other sources mentioned, https://www.sanskritfromhome.in/ 
has a full range of courses from beginner-level to shastras.

I would advise you not really just on technology but to find some 
like-minded people you can study with face-to-face and some vidwan who can 
guide you in person.  This will lessen the chances of you giving up half 
way because, let's be honest, Sanskrit has a steep learning curve.  It 
takes patience and discipline before you can get to the "good stuff" but 
it is worth the effort for any serious sadhaka.
