May I make just a small correction in Siva Senaniji's post. The above link
has Sanskrit videos that are 120 in number but under half an hour each, so
around 60 hours total. Its quite a good resource and easy to follow even
for a child.

On the other end of the spectrum, there are many a pATha by Swami
Shantidharmananda Saraswati on Mahabhashya with Pradeepa and some Udyota at
https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOK49oELkE2M2HJg1LiNA3NUOnP0G4H4M.
There are some such on e-PG Pathshala,  as well, but more tuned to
University syllabus.

If someone knows of more Mahabhashya resources, please let me know. Thanks.

Kind rgds,
--Praveen R. Bhat
