Subramanian K
-------------

Academician and researcher based in India. Student of Vedanta.


Venkataraman Syamalam
---------------------

Studied the nature first objectively, as a researcher specifically all
that can be observed. Got to work on quantum coherence and decoherence and
thereby the entanglement of observed, observer and the observation.  Having
ignored the observer all the while had to turn inwards!(From the perception
of body mind complex)with the benefit of the teachings of Bagavan Ramana
Maharisi and Baghavan Bashyakara. Listening in person and audio, the blessed
lectures on Baghavan's Collected Works  and Bagavathpadas Collected works
(Sashtra and Stotra) staying aloof of all that which is not the subject in
being just the subject.
