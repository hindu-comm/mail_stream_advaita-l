This episode, alluded to in the episode in the Mahimna Stotra of
Pushpadanta, is also found in in some Puranas, including the Harivamsha.
The Mahabharata Shiva Sahasranama has the name ‘Viṣṇuprasāditaḥ’ which
means ‘Rudra is one who is pleased by Viṣṇu.’

According to Shiva Purana <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiva_Purana>,
Once, Lord Vishnu <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vishnu>, Lord of Vaikuntha
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaikuntha>, left his abode and went to
Varanasi to worship Lord Shiva <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiva> on
this day. He pledged to worship Shiva with one thousand lotuses. While
singing hymns in glorification of Shiva, Lord Vishnu found the last or
'thousandth' lotus missing. Vishnu, whose eyes are often compared to
lotuses, plucked one of them and offers it to Shiva. Lord Shiva becoming
intensely pleased with His love, restored Vishnu's eye and rewarded
Him the Sudarshana
chakra <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudarshana_chakra>, Vishnu's discus
and sacred weapon.[3]
