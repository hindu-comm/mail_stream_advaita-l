And what is the legitimacy of that when the upanishads themselves refer to 
itihasa/purana as the "5th Veda" and Shankaracharya has quoted from them?

I am reminded of the story of the Caliph Omar who supposedly ordered the 
destruction of the Library of Alexandria saying that "If these books are 
opposed to the Quran they are heresy and should be burned. If they confirm 
the truth of the Quran they are redundant and it doesn't matter if they 
burn."  Needless to say that sort of idea is alien to our dharma.


> He can as well use that time and energy for adyatmayoga

When it is known that Brahman is all, what kind of adhyatmayoga makes 
distinctions such as "waste of time and energy"?

You would be on firmer footing if you kept your criticism to shastras that 
teach duality but those are not what were being quoted in this case.
