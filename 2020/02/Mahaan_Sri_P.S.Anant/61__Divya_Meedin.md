Namaste Raghav-ji,

I am afraid I cannot answer in detail to your question on Salakshanam since
I have no Adhikara / competence to do so. Perhaps honourable members
well-versed in Vedas in this forum or any Veda Brahmasri you are acquainted
with, may best answer your question.

As for the Mahaan's advice on performance of Yagyam, it is generally
believed that interpretations of words of the exalted may lead to mistaken
notions / reasonings -  it is said in the scriptures that these are
compulsory duties for a Brahmin. The exact translation of the paragraph
that excerpt was taken from is as follows:

"Once Sri Mahaperiyava told the Sri Vadhyar thus "You must emphasize 'what
is Dharma' to the masses. You must tell all, especially to Brahmins, in the
strictest of terms, what they are to do and what they are not to do. It is
for this purpose that I have groomed you." Sri Vadhyar implemented this
very directive. He taught Dharma in emphatic terms to many. To a few who
had learnt Veda, He has declared in Sabhas in no uncertain terms, "Janma as
a Brahmin would not attain consummation just by Vedaadhyayana alone;
Oupasanam, Agnihotram, Somayagam, etc  are to also be performed"

In stressing so, the Mahaan was following His Guru Sri Mahaperiyaval's
directive, and that of Veda Maata. Perhaps these reasons alone might have
sufficed for Him.

Warm regards,
Divya
