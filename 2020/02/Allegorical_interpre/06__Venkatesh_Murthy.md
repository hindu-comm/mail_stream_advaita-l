Namaste
We even see today people do things for some minutes of pleasure and
accepting risks. A young man drives the car very fast and recklessly and
meets with accident and injury. Why did he drive so fast knowing there is
a  risk? There is no answer. Many people drink and smoke heavily knowing
there is a risk of cancer and early death. Why? There is no answer.

This is the message of the Bhagavata Sloka. They say the sex appetite of
many women is very high. Why they are like that even though they know there
is a risk of sin? There is no answer.
