Subject: [Advaita-l] Allegorical interpretation of PurANAs

Hari Om,

How do we really ascertain as to whether a particular description in PurANas is allegorical one or factual one.

For eg, how do we understand BhAgvat 6.9.9? Should we really believe it as a historical event or just ignore or give allegorical meaning.

Allegorical interpretation seems impossible here. Factual one absurd.
Ignoring it appears the only option left.

Regards.
Sudhanshu.
