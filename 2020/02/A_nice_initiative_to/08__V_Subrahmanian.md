Sri Sharma Sastrigal of Chennai is giving away exquisite images of Shankara
Bhagavatpada to institutions. He has also mooted the practice of observing
a Shankara worship on the Shukla Panchami of every month.

An initiative worthy of emulation by all admirers and followers of  the
unmatched Acharya.
