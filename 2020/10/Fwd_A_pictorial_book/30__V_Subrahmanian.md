A pictorial book in comic style, titled “Shankaracharya of Sringeri”, has
been brought out by The Centre for Brahmavidya, Chennai, recently. This
32-page book contains lifelike illustrations depicting the inspiring
biography and teachings of His Holiness Jagadguru Sri Bharathi Teertha
Mahaswamiji, the 36th Shankaracharya of Sri Sringeri Sharada Peetham.
Will God appear to us, humans? Is God partial? How does He grace one?  What
should one earn and save for oneself? –  The Jagadguru’s insightful answers
for questions such as these have been interestingly presented in this book,
in a style that would appeal to both children and adults alike.
His Holiness Sri Vidhusekhara Bharathi Sannidhanam released the book on the
sacred Vijayadadami day (26 October 2020) at Sringeri, and Sri
V.R.Gowrishankar, the Administrator & CEO of Sri Sharada Peetham received
the first copy.
This book is now available for purchase at a subsidised price of Rs 50.
