Did Ramana write his own verses or did someone write them down as he composed them?The Tamil is ver stylized, and seem to follow the sandhi pattern of sanskrit.I have never seen Tamil written this way anywhere else.Ancient and classical Tamil, say like Valluvar or Sambandar, the Tamil words are hard to understand but their origin is classical.Are there any other Tamil texts that are written in Ramanaâ€™s style?Thank you.Soma
