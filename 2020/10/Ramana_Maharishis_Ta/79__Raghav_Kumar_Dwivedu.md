Which tamil composition of Sri Ramana are you exactly  referring to? I have
it on good authority that his tamil very well follows the all standard
Tamil sandhi rules. You may need to mention specific details. Can you give
a couple of examples where Sri Ramana's tamil does not follow Tamil sandhi
rules?
