Response: Yes, Bhagavan has composed a lot of Tamil verses and poems, like
Ulladu Narpadu, Upadesa Unidyar, etc. Bhagavan took a lot of inspiration
for Avvudai Akkal, etc. His focus was on Tamil meters however. For example
Upadesa Unidyar is based on folk game played in Tamil Nadu Villages. Anma
Vidya Krithi is composed in the same manner as Ayye Methakadinam by
Gopalakrishna Bharati.
Namaskaram, Rishi
