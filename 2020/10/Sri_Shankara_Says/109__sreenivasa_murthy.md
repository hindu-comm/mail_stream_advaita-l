Deae friends,
Here is a very profound teaching from Sri Shankara :
Quote: satyEna laByastapasA hyESha AtmA ||Mundaka3-1-5Commentary to the above reads thus:tad hi anukUlam AtmadarSanABimuKIBAvAtparamaM sAdhanam tapaH| ESha AtmA laByaH ||

Unquote.This is susuKaM kartum and it is avyayam asdeclared in Bhagavadgita Chapter 9.
Mumukshus who have a sincere longing to know 
their true svarupa or Atmasvasvarupa are requested 
to utilise their time and energy for this purpose 
instead of indulging in discussions about anAtma 
which is absolutely a hindrance for Atmajnana.
With respectful namaskars,Sreenivasa Murthy
