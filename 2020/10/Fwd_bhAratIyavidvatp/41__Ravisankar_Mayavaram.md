Sunderji contribution to the Sanskrit Documents Website and advaita 
vedAnta related groups was IMMENSE (years of work done as a service). He 
is a great role model for many like me and I am grateful for that. I am 
deeply saddened by his loss and I pray to SrimAtA for his well being 
during this transmigration process and provide him the comfort and 
refuge. May She provide the inner strength to his family members and 
friends to cope up with this loss.

Ravi
