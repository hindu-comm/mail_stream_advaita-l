A useful web site is "The Wayback Machine" which is a service of the 
Internet Archive (https://www.archive.org/) It takes regular snapshots of 
the state of most web sites so you can "go back in time" and see how a 
site looked in the past.  This is very handy if the site moves or removes 
content as in this case.  This snapshot of sringeri.net from October 2009 
has the page you were looking for:
