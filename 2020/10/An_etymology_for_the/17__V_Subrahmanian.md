We have come across the term 'tripuTee' meaning the triad of knower,
knowing and known.  In the commentary to the Panchadashi 11.14, the
commentator Sri Ramakrishna Pandita gives an etymology thus: त्रयाणां
ज्ञातृज्ञानज्ञेयरूपाणां पुटानाम् आकाराणां समाहारः त्रिपुटी |  (The
collection of the three 'forms' of knower, knowing and known is called
tripuTee).  For the word puTa he gives the meaning 'form'.  I could not get
that meaning in the various dictionaries.
