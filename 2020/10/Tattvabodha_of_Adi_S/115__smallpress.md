>From Brahman reference, there is no avidya also. It is pureSatyam-Jnaanam-Anantam – they are swaruupa lakshanas – indicatory definitionsof the nature of Brahman, and not attributes of Brahman. 
When a seeker living in the world asks the question – how andwhy this creation etc. then the answers are provided for the seeker to inquirefurther since he does not seem to realize or understand due to ignorance of histrue nature and that he, as a conscious entity, cannot but be Brahman that does nothave ignorance. Hence in principle –ignorance is located on Jeeva – but Jeeva is a product of ignorance. Thisanyonya aashyara is like seed and tree. Since there cannot be anything otherthan Brahman (infiniteness) Vedanta says that the adhishtaanam or support for thejeeva-jagat-Iswara the triad is also Brahman only. Hence for operational purposes– it is said that the avidya is located on Brahman only since anything thatexists apparent or real has to rest in Brahman, even though from Brahman referencethere is no avidya nor the jeeva-jagat-Iswara triad. 

In essence, one must understand from what reference thesestatements are made. Most of us keep one leg on vyavahaara and another leg fromthe point of paaramaathika, and ask these questions. The reference states fromwhich these points are made must be clear. 

Hari Om!

Thank you for the response. Avidya leads to Kama which leads to karma, yes. But that does not seem to answer the question
how avidya can exist in Brhman? 
Thanks
