The standard explanation is that desire is generated due to avidyA or ignorance, which itself is said
to be ultimately unreal when Brahman is known as-is.

The sequence usually given is:

avidyA (ignorance) -> kAma (desire) -> karma (action)

Thank you for the response. Avidya leads to Kama which leads to karma, yes. But that does not seem to answer the question
how avidya can exist in Brhman? 
Thanks
Soma
