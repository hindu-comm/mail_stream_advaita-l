OM NAMAH SIVANANDAYA
Hari OM!

Revered Self,

Sadar Pranam,

Pardon a beginner level question.

I am familiar with consciousness and how everything is in fact
consciousness....I'm baffled as to understanding how everything is the same
consciousness and secondly how there is only one consciousness (Brahman).

So, I'd like to understand how the atman of individuals is in essence the
same and how it is Brahman.

Pranam,

OM
