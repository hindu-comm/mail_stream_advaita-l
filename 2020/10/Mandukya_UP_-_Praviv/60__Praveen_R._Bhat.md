Namaste Chandramouliji,

Sure, the difference can be explained in any way but the samAsa is
experiencer of something different. The Bhashya quotation proves the same
as below:

Here (in dream) though, due to mere vAsanA prajnA being experienced, it is
a *pravivikta = different bhoga*

As I said, the word pravivikta should not land into jIva, the experiencer,
but the word praviviktabhuk should land in that meaning. If you say jIva
experiences himself, I have no arguments per se siddhAnta-wise
(technically, there is kartR-karma-virodha to be explained, etc), but I
want to keep to the context of the question itself.
