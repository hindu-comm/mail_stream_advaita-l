Namaste.

Reg  <<  a subject who experiences the pravivikta object Finally, it means

Pravivikta is here interpreted  as ** different**. Should it not be
understood as  ** differentiating oneself or itself  ** ??. That is how
praviviktabhuk  is understood as jIva who differentiates himself, meaning
thereby that the dream creation is nothing but his own previous experiences
or vAsanas, his Sukshma sharIra,  and enjoys the same.
