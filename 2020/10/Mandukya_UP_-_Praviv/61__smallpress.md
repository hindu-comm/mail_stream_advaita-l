Thank you everyone for you kind attention to my query. I like the way Sri Praveen Bhat explains Praviviktam Bhuk as the sushma sharira. Makes sense to me. Thank you.

While I see the Vishvanarah: in the awake state what is the significance of Taijasa in the dream state? Is it the way dreams appear as if in daylight, and with other lights, even though we sleep in a dark room?
Within the upanishad Virat and Hiranyagarbha are not mentioned. Do they appear in karika or bhashya? What is the source for these names.
Thank you.
Soma

Namaste Chandramouliji,

Sure, the difference can be explained in any way but the samAsa is
experiencer of something different. The Bhashya quotation proves the same
as below:

Here (in dream) though, due to mere vAsanA prajnA being experienced, it is
a *pravivikta = different bhoga*

As I said, the word pravivikta should not land into jIva, the experiencer,
but the word praviviktabhuk should land in that meaning. If you say jIva
experiences himself, I have no arguments per se siddhAnta-wise
(technically, there is kartR-karma-virodha to be explained, etc), but I
want to keep to the context of the question itself.
