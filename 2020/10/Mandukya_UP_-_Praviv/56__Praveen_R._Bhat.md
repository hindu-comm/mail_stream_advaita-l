Namaste,

The simplest way to understand praviviktabhuk is praviviktam bhunkte. It
cannot be anything other than an upapada samAsa, AFAIK, meaning that
pravivikta is the object for bhuj-dhAtu and the entire compound stands for
a subject who experiences the pravivikta object. Finally, it means one who
experiences that which is different/separate. From what? From sthUla in the
prior mantra; ergo, sUkShma.

Kind rgds,
--Praveen R. Bhat
