Namaste.

Would not substituting the word  “ oneself “  for  “alone”  in the above
convey the understanding better.

This would also translate to substituting the word  “ oneself “  for “atma”
in the following cited from the same post.

<<  atma in the taijasa or dream mode also experiences through seven limbs
and
nineteen mouths but it, the atma alone is the creator and source of
phenomena  >>

I am not sure though if this is your intent. However it approximates to my
understanding of the position.
