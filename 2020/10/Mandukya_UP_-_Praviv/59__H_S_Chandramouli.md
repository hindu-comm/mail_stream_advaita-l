Namaste Praveen Ji,

I agree that the jIva experiences subtle objects. But in the current
context, I am only meaning that the subtle objects are not any subtle
objects, but only those that form part of the jIva himself. i am
understanding the sukshma shaRira as part of jIva. This understanding in
the current context is also borne out by the bhAshya itself.

<<  इन्द्रियापेक्षया अन्तःस्थत्वान्मनसः तद्वासनारूपा च स्वप्ने प्रज्ञा
यस्येति अन्तःप्रज्ञः, विषयशून्यायां प्रज्ञायां केवलप्रकाशस्वरूपायां
विषयित्वेन भवतीति तैजसः । विश्वस्य सविषयत्वेन प्रज्ञायाः स्थूलाया
भोज्यत्वम् ; इह पुनः केवला वासनामात्रा प्रज्ञा भोज्येति प्रविविक्तो भोग
इति ।  >>.
