Subject: [Advaita-l] Ramana Maharishi’s Tamil verses
Namaskaram Sir/Ma'am
Yes, Bhagavan did write a lot of Tamil verses He has composed in almost all
languages like Sanskrit, Tamil, Telugu, etc.

Ulladu Narpadu, Upadesa Undiyar, Arunachala Stuti Panchakam are all written
in Tamil and can be found online.

Subject: [Advaita-l] Ramana Maharishi’s Tamil verses
Did Ramana write his own verses or did someone write them down as he
composed them?The Tamil is ver stylized, and seem to follow the sandhi
pattern of sanskrit. I have never seen Tamil written this way anywhere
else. Ancient and classical Tamil, say like Valluvar or Sambandar, the
Tamil words are hard to understand but their origin is classical.Are there
any other Tamil texts that are written in Ramana’s style?Thank you.Soma
