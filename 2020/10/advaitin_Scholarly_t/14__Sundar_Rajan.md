 Namaste Davesx-ji,
>>so I don’t waste time listening to lectures and reading their commentaries>>
Didn't you just post in a previous message about the grand vision of Shankara and Gaudapada?. Out of curiosity, can I ask - How did you come across their grand vision without reading their commentaries ?. Did they appear in a dream and explained their vision to you?
But I do agree, you shouldn't waste time listening to lectures especially if your spouse is chasing you with a broomstick to get garden work done. Speaking from personal experience..

 Thanks ji -There areno experts who can understand THAT which is incomprehensible, indescribable andinexpressible, so I don’t waste time listening to lectures and reading their commentaries while my kitchen garden dwindles for lack of attention:-)
That doesn’t mean someone else should dismiss it prematurely,especiallyif there isneed for intellectual clarity.
