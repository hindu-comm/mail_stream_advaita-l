KODIMANGALAM: MARCH 26-27, 2017
Jagadgurus in Kodimangalam

Jagadguru Shankaracharya Sri Sri Bharati Tirtha Mahasannidhanam and
Jagadguru Sri Sri Vidhushekhara Bharati Sannidhanam arrived at Kodimangalam
on March 26, 2017, to a devout welcome by Sri N Venkataraman and other devotees.
Sri Mahasannidhanam and Sri Sannidhanam then proceeded to the Goddess Seethalakshmi
temple and had Darshan. Dhuli Pada Puja was performed by Sri N Girijashankar and
Sri N Venkataraman. The Ubhaya Jagadgurus blessed the audience with Anugraha Bhashanams.
Sri Mahasannidhanam said that the most important aspect of our devotion to God is to
be able to offer our own mind — भवतु भवदर्थं मम मनः — to be able to focus the mind at the
Lord’s Lotus Feet. This when done, even if only for ten minutes a day, brings about
our good. Sri Sannidhanam, in His elaborate Anugraha Bhashanam, explained a verse
from Sri Adi Shankaracharya’s Soundaryalahari outlining how the All-compassionate
Divine Mother bestows on the pure devotee the bliss of the Self.

At 8 am on March 27, 2017, Sri Sannidhanam offered worship to Goddess Seethalakshmi
in the temple. The Jagadgurus then gave Darshan, distributed Tirtha Prasada and
blessed the devotees with Ashir Mantrakshatas.
