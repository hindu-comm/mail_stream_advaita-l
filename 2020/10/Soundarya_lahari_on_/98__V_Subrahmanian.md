Wishing you all a very "happy Navarathri festival". Many prayers in Goddess
to bless with good health and prosperity to all.

On this auspicious occasion of Navarathri, students of Naada Surabhi are
presenting Adi Shankaracharya's composition - Soundary Lahari. A unique
effort to learn and perform sthotras on both vocal and veena together, have
been made by the students.

A series of 5 episodes, starting from 19th Oct till 23rd Oct, presenting 10
Slokas every day. We seek your continued support, encouragement, and
blessings.
