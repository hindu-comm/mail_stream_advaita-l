All that he has said stands automatically refuted as 1. There is a
commentary by an Advaitin of the 13th Century, several centuries before
Vijayendra. 2. Swami Vidyaranya has condensed that Upanishad in his
Anubhuti Prakasha in verse form by upholding Shiva only. 3. The Suta
Samhita of the Skanda Purana too condenses this Upanishad again upholding
Shiva alone as Para Brahman. Many others have held this to be of Shiva
Supreme, some puranas have used words in this upanishad to give explicit
meaning that Shiva alone is of this Upanishad.

Achintyam - this word he says applies to Narayana. But Valmiki Ramayana has
used this epithet for Shiva. I have written on this.

So, no effort needs to be taken by us to refute him.
