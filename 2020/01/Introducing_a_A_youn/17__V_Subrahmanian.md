A young scholar has arrived for Dharma Shaastra, Vedanta, etc.

 Glad that this illustrious son of Brahmasri Nannilam Rajagopala
GhanapaaThigal (who recently passed away) is carrying forward the rich
tradition.   This young man is a very well read scholar, sincere in his
intentions.

Here he is clarifying many doubts about pitru karma anushthanam, etc.
