Advaitic Brahman, etc. in the Kurma Purana,  Devi Vishvarupa of Shiva

The Kurmapurana part, in the following link, is a veritable treat for
Vedantins.  The Nirguna, Saguna, Dvaitavarjita Brahman is clearly stated.
We are reminded of the Lalita Sahasra Naama too. The manifestation of Devi,
Shakti, with eight hands, as the daughter of Himavaan reminds us of the
Lord manifesting as the child, with four hands, of Devaki-Vasudeva.

Many Bh.Gita explicit resemblances can also be seen in this section.

It is an enjoyable study of Vedanta in the Kurma Purana. The shlokas are
easy, not requiring much aid in understanding. Those requiring a
translation may look up the online resources easily available.
