Dear Praveen ji,

Kindly ignore this voice message as it did not record my voice correctly.

I wanted to say:  The jiva that is a product of avidya cannot be the locus
and object of avidya.  Only Nirguna Brahman can be the locus and object for
avidya. In other words, avidya has to have Brahman for its locus and it
conceals Brahman. It cannot have the jiva, which is a product of avidya,
for its locus and object.  I recalled this after seeing your words:

//..  that which is created after (if at all there is a created and an
after), cannot ever know the former.//
