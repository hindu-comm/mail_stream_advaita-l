 Namasthe,
This is not a post directly addressing the issue raised but a loud thinking on why inspite of clear cut answers available in the multitude of 'shruti, smRiti' and 'pRakaraNa granthas' strewn all over (Google is Great), one still misses the point and continue to act deaf !
The biggest problem is - our conditioning - that of taking everything in the 'cause-effect' order. Whereas while dreaming a 'MOTHER' AND CHILD' we do not question how both were seen together ! i.e we didn't see a lapsed time between the 'cause Mother' and then , later the 'effect Child' !
Another, is to think about the 'kaala'; say 'jaagrat kaala' in 'jaagrat avastha'. Like if one is in a room, then the room is certainly not in him ! That means the 'jaagrat avastha' is 'kaalaatiitam' !
Going into these kinds of understanding one will have to sharpen the intellect. So until the seeker goes thru the 'ShravaNa-Manana-Nidhidhyasanam' the seeker's instruments fails to grasp the subtlest of 'jnaanam' - advaitam.
With gross mind and instruments we fail to even recognize the failing instruments (which is upgraded by SMN) one's cognitive inadequacies, grasping inabilities, and consequent lack of faith and trust . And yet, we consider to be more brilliant than Shree Shankara who with 'shaastRa pRamANam, yukthi ' and ' anubhava' restablished the VedAnta and brought the Vedic thought on to the centre stage by conclusively conducting dialogues* (luckily not with guns!) with every other break away groups and even the ones which didn't even have a clue of what Veda is (Buddhism, Jainism etc), and yet considered themselves as discoverers of the TRUTH !
'Shwetaketu' after undergoing intensive training had to hear repeatedly nine times ! And that too every learning, training, and every aspect of his living was perfectly aligned to the Vedic way, the one designed exactly to take a person to the 'parama purushARtha', like the GSM we use to reach our destinations in the present day.
Swami ParamARthanada Ji always repeats, if you don't understand, repeat the 'ShravaNam', and continue that until 'mananam' is automatic leading to 'nidhidhyasanm' which will certainly lead to live the 'jnaanam' (JM). This 'sampRadAya' is a time tested one and one can doubtlessly get into the vehicle. After all we live our lives carrying this trust and faith in every facet of our living . Then why one has to demand that every signal until my destination has to be green even before i step on the accelerator !
Regards
Balagopal

 I was just the thinking it would be helpful to see the sAyaNa bhAShya for
that particular Rk mantra को अद्धा वेद क इह प्रवोचत् । कुत आजाता कुत इयं
विसृष्टिः and you posted it.

Thank you for that Praveen ji.

Prima facie, it's an arthavAda for durviGYetvam of jagatkAraNam.

But there is also a hetu given for the invalidity (anupapannatvam) of the
mind trying to know how creation started viz.,
यद्भौतिकं सर्जनं सृष्टिस्तेनार्वागर्वाचीनाः कृताः। भूतसृष्टेः पश्चाज्जाता
इत्यर्थः।
viz., an entity (possessed of mind etc) which was necessarily created later
in the sequence of creation, will find it impossible to conceptually
visualise how his own creation happened.

Then what is the Advaita teaching all about. I understand it to be - "the
mind cannot do viShayIkaraNam (objectification or a concrete
conceptualization) of jagatkAraNam and how it 'evolved' in the initial
stages to "become" jagat. But it's still possible for the shuddha
anatahkaraNam, when exposed to the mahAvAkya teaching to resolve in to it's
source and own up "i am brahman" by way of laxyArtham of that mahAvAkya.

The mystery of creation remains but the mind's doubts about AtmA and the
sources of sorrow are destroyed thereby.


Namaste

Raghav
