Namaste Raghav Ji,

Reg  <<But it's still possible for the shuddha
anatahkaraNam, when exposed to the mahAvAkya teaching to resolve in to it's
source and own up "i am brahman" by way of laxyArtham of that mahAvAkya.

The mystery of creation remains but the mind's doubts about AtmA and the
sources of sorrow are destroyed thereby>>,

I don’t think so. Mundaka 2-2-9

<<भिद्यते हृदयग्रन्थिश्छिद्यन्ते सर्वसंशयाः ।
क्षीयन्ते चास्य कर्माणि तस्मिन्दृष्टे परावरे ॥ ९ ॥>>

clearly mentions removal of all doubts, and that includes The mystery of
creation. And in my understanding, that is the ONLY way such a doubt is
erased.
Regards
