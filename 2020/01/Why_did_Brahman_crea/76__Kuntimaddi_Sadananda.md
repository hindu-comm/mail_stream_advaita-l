Subbuji - PraNAms

I have a problem in accepting this.

Brahman is the locus for everythingby definition since Brahman is infinite.

At the same time, Brahman cannot bethe locus for anything since it is infinite.

Therefore, avidya we can onlydiscuss at vyaavaharika level.

There the question is who hasignorance. One who does not know that I am Brahman definitely has the ignoranceand the instructions are for him to approach a teacher to remove thatignorance. The instructions are not for Brahman but for the Jeeva. Theignorance is in the mind of jeeva and it is the mind that has to learn.

Yes, there is annyonya aashraya -which Ramanuja makes a big deal about it in his Shree Bhaashya.

The anyonaya ashraya is there forall cause-effect relations ships - seed first or tree first.

It is resolved only by saying thatavidya is anaadi and the jeeva is also anaadi. One can only leave it asanirvachaneeyam.

At the paaramaarthika level - thereis no avidya nor jeeva too.

Ramanuja has a similar problem sincehe attributes to creation to karmas of jeevas - which again has anyonyaaashraya dosha.

In essence, this anyonaya aashrayadosha cannot be avoided - Only escape is anirvachaneeyam.

 Dear Praveen ji,

Kindly ignore this voice message as it did not record my voice correctly.

I wanted to say: The jiva that is a product of avidya cannot be the locus
and object of avidya. Only Nirguna Brahman can be the locus and object for
avidya. In other words, avidya has to have Brahman for its locus and it
conceals Brahman. It cannot have the jiva, which is a product of avidya,
for its locus and object. I recalled this after seeing your words:

//.. that which is created after (if at all there is a created and an
after), cannot ever know the former.//
