Exactly so, that is why that which is created after (if at all there is a
created and an after), cannot ever know the former. Who knows is always the
former; the former knows the former as there is no one else! Or sticking to
the context, one who knows doesn't know as to why the creation! As Bhagavan
Gaudapadacharya concludes देवस्यैष स्वभावोऽयमाप्तकामस्य का स्पृहा।
