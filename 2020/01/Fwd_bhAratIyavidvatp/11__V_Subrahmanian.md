Namaskaaram Mr. Subrahmanian,

Thank you for sharing reportage
https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/earliest-epigraphic-proof-for-saptamatrikas-found/article30399629.ece
of
this significant new find.

When I accessed the above link earlier today, I was unable to read the
entire article without a subscription.

Reportage of this find seems far lesser than the attention it (in my view)
deserves and for those who might be interested, here is another source
<https://www.ibtimes.sg/archaeologists-unearth-earliest-sanskrit-inscription-found-southern-india-36596?utm_campaign=/archaeologists-unearth-earliest-sanskrit-inscription-found-southern-india-36596>
that provides atleast some information without requiring subscription.

Best,
Megh

PS: There is more than one word/usage in this
<https://www.ibtimes.sg/archaeologists-unearth-earliest-sanskrit-inscription-found-southern-india-36596?utm_campaign=/archaeologists-unearth-earliest-sanskrit-inscription-found-southern-india-36596>
that
might seem problematic to some but sharing it is not an endorsement of
everything in it.
