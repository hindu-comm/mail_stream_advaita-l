Just to add to this post:

If the Linga Purana is held to be 'taamasic' then it follows by default
that the Atharva Shira Upanishad too is taamasic.  In order to ward off
this consequence, if it is held that the 'Rudra' of this Upanishad is to be
converted to another deity, then the same 'conversion' will have be done in
the Linga Puanam too to avoid its taamasic classification.

Vaidikas alone do not face such a predicament.
