Raghav - PraNAms
moha is one of the six enemies. kaama krodha, lobha, moha, mada, mascharya are supposed to be the six enemies of the mind that hijack the mind from equilibrium.Kamaa leads to krodha etc as Geeta sloka dhyaayato vishayaan pumsaH .. indicates.Krishna equates kaama and krodha essentially one- in the sloka -kaama esha kesha - rajo guna samudbhavaH where first two words are used but in the next line He uses a singular verb indicating both are the same.moha is translated as delusion.The perception of plurality is an illusion. Taking the plurality as reality is a delusion.Since moha involves taking the plurality as reality, attachments to BMI and to the sense objects takes place and what Swamiji summarized as samsara results.

 Namaste
A friend compiled the following senses of the word 'moha' based on Swami
Paramarthanandaji's talks.

'1. Expecting physical immortality.

2. Entertaining a hope that - one day, I will be happy forever ( _Nitya
sukham_) with external objects / experiences /persons ( _anatma vastu_).

3. Entertaining a hope that - one day, I will be secure forever ( _Nitya
abhayam_) in the presence of / owning some _anatma vastu_.'

Is there any reference from sanskrit for the above? I don't seem to
recollect it.

Also, does not the word moha also cover the sense of either
shobhanaadhyaasa or Raaga w.r.t to a person or relationship, as in the
cases of putra-moha or strii-moha etc.
