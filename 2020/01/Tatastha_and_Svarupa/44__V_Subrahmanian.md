Here is a unique statement of both the Tatastha and Svarupa Lakshana-s of
Brahman in just half a shloka.  This occurs, along with a number of
interesting ideas, in the Shiva Puranam on the occasion of Bāṇāsura vadha
episode.  Krishna, in a stuti of Shiva, says:
https://sa.wikisource.org/s/xn7

श्रीकृष्ण उवाच ।।
देवदेव महादेव शरणागतवत्सल ।।
नमामि त्वाऽनंतशक्तिं सर्वात्मानं परेश्वरम् ।। ४३ ।।
*विश्वोत्पत्तिस्थाननाशहेतुं सज्ज्ञप्तिमात्रकम् ।।*
ब्रह्मलिंगं परं शांतं केवलं परमेश्वरम् ।। ४४ ।।

In that underlined half-verse, Brahman (Shiva) is stated to be the
Jagatkaaranam (taTastha lakshanam) and Sat, Jnaanam (Svarupa lakshanam).
This latter epithet is very interesting in that while commenting on the
Satyam Jnaanam Anantam Brahma of Taittiriya Upanishad, Shankara, for Jnanam
says: It is Pure Consciousness, Jnapti, and not a mere transformation of
the buddhi  ज्ञानं ब्रह्मेति । ज्ञानं ज्ञप्तिः अवबोधः.  Brahman's svarupam
is Kevala ChinmAtram and not knowledge of any object. For this Shankara
uses the word 'Jnapti' which is what is used in the above Shiva Puranam
verse.

We are delighted to see this expression, after having experienced a similar
one in the Srimad Bhagavatam: upalabdhi-mAtram.  This term also means
Jnapti alone.  We have the Amara Kosha and Mahabharata giving the synonyms:

बुद्धिर्मनीषा धिषणा धीः प्रज्ञा शेमुषी मतिः। प्रेक्षो*पलब्धि*
श्चित्संवित्प्रतिप*त्ज्ञप्ति*चेतना॥    Both the terms Upalabdhi and Jnapti
are there in this collection.

Thus, we find the foremost Vedantin, Veda Vyasa, giving the Brahma
Lakshanam in the consistent form in the Purana-s.  Vedantins alone will be
able to grasp this as they alone rise above petty considerations of
theistic schools for whom all of Veda Vyasa's works are not acceptable;
some are rejectable as poison.

Another noteworthy feature above is the term 'ब्रह्मलिंगम्'.  We have the
famous 'Pandurangashtakam' of Shankara: परब्रह्मलिङ्गं भजे पाण्डुरङ्गम्

The word 'kevalam' in the Puranic verse is also noteworthy for it means:
Advaitam.  Shankara has cited the Shiva Puranam in the VSN Bhashya: ShivaH
Parama KaaraNam.  Other ancient Advaitins too have cited from this Puranam.

Om Tat Sat
