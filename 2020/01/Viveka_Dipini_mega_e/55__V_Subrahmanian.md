'Viveka Dipini' is a condensation of Shankaracharya's 'Prashnottara Ratna
Maalikaa'.  Vedanta Bharati has been teaching this work at many schools in
Karnataka for the last two years.  This mega event is organized to
commemorate this effort.

The event, at the Bangalore Palace premises, will be honored by the Union
Home Minister Sri Amit Shah.  Please access the image of the invitation
