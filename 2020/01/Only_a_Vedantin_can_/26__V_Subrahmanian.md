"All religious conflicts and quarrels arise because a devotee is unable to
disassociate his conception of God from a particular name and form."

- Jagadguru Sri Chandrashekhara Bharati Mahaswamigal

(Source: Thought of the Day - Sringeri Vidya Bharati Foundation, USA)

The wisdom in the above message encapsulates the entire scriptural lore of
the Vaidika Sanatana Dharma.  None other than a Vedantin can grasp this and
express it in such a way. Theological/sectarian schools can never aim to
reach these sublime heights of the Vedantin.  Their lot is destined to
wallow in bigotry. We see only Advaita Acharyas express such thoughts that
can never be comprehended by those who do not belong to the path of the
Vedanta.
