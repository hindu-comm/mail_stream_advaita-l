Shri Murthy,

Namaskara. You have stated it well. That gave actual relief...

 The subtility in Mahaswami's vachana about passionate adherence to the
duality of name and form (a generic noun) as a progenitor of violence
appears to be lost when the word Dvaita (a proper noun) is used.  In
general, one can see that passionate adherence of anything could be equally
dogmatic and this gives rise to conflicts and quarrels... this is true even
in the realms of religion and science.

As a disclaimer, on a lighter vein, as someone born in dvaita sampradaya, I
have not seen violent tendency against people of advaita or vishistadvaita
sampradayas amongst my kith, kin and tribal strangers all these decades...
Most probably those aasura sampatthi dvaitins and vishistaadvaitins
(paraphrasing Shri Krishna) have also acquired ability to be invisible...
