Thank you Raghav ji.  Although the 'crusade', 'jihad' mode of treating the
opponents are not there in the Vedic sectarians, a slightly different mode
of these has been adopted by them: Those who do not hold their deity,
Vishnu, to be the supreme, are taamasic, those deities themselves are
taamasic, much below the only highly Sattvic Vishnu, and are destined to
hell, andha tamas, etc. Hence for them Shankaracharya too is an asura,
paapi, deserving such a hell along with his followers.
