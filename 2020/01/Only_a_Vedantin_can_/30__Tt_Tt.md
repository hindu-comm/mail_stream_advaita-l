"Yet the Indian dvaita systems (thankfully) do not have a
bloody record of violence and persecution of fellow human beings purely due
to their religious beliefs, the way bloodthirsty jihads and crusades have
been the norm in Islam and Christianity?"  A lot of credit for this goes to
our Guru Parampara for keeping our Dharma-ahimsa live.  Our Gurus do not
incite violence.  If they were to, for instance ask their bhaktas to go
take revenge, then bhaktas would do so.  I am reminded of BAPS temple
terror attack in Gandhinagar many years ago.  The swaminarayan satsangis
were ready to give their lives and take revenge but H.H. Pramukh Swami
Maharaj didn't allow them to even entertain such thoughts.
Om Tat Sat
