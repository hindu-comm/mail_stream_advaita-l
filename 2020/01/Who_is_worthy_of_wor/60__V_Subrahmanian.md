Here is a line from the Bhagavatam, in the link provided already:

रुद्रं त्रिलोकैकगुरुं ननाम शिरसा मुनिः ॥ १४ ॥

Suta says: Markandeya prostrated before Rudra who is 'Trilokaika-guru',
which means: the Only Guru for all the Three Worlds.

This expression, an epithet to Rudra by Veda Vyasa, reminds us of a similar
epithet used by Sarvajnaatman, the 10th Century CE Advaitin, in his
Sankshepa shaariraka, to Vishnu, his ishta devataa.
