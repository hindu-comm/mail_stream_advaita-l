Dear Mumukshus,

Your true svarUpa is this :
One’s True svarUpa : 
its own ever-present self, 
never moving, never changing, 
never going or becoming anything. 
Ever-Present, homogeneous, 
self-knowing, self-luminous, 
self-existent, colourless, formless, 
full only of the “knowing itself”-pure knowing / being.
The Consciousness, having no form, has the capacity to take the shape of all forms. 
Consciousness “gives itself” to all apparent forms but loses itself to none of them.
                            OM TAT SAT


Please realize your true svarUpa Here & Now by cognizing
 the above stated acts within yourself by yousself.
May the Indwelling Divinity bless you with that wisdom.

With respectful namaskars,
Sreenivasa Murthy.
