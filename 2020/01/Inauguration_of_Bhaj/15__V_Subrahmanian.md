The link has a book containing songs addressed to various deities.  These
are also sung beautifully and recorded there.  One can hear these, learn to
sing them and engage in bhajans at their homes, nearby temples, their
groups, etc.  The text is available in multiple language scripts.  Pl.
share the link with other groups/friends.
