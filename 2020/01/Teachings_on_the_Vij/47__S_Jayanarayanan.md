SATHYAMANGALAM: MARCH 14-16, 2017
Kumbhabhishekam at Sathyamangalam

JAGADGURUS ENTER TAMIL NADU

Jagadguru Shankaracharya Sri Sri Bharati Tirtha Mahasannidhanam and Jagadguru Sri Sri Vidhushekhara Bharati Sannidhanam
entered Tamil Nadu in the evening of March 14, 2017. With Sri Mahasannidhanam gracing Tamil Nadu for the first time along
with His Uttaradhikari Shishya, ardent devotees from various parts of Tamil Nadu assembled just inside the Karnataka-TamilNadu
state border at Bannari and gave a rousing reception to the Ubhaya Jagadgurus with Poornakumbha Swagata. Phala Samarpanam was
then performed on behalf of the people of various districts and Prasadam from temples such as Rameswaram, Tiruchendur and Palani
were also submitted to the Jagadgurus. Sri Mahasannidhanam blessed the gathering with an Anugraha Bhashanam.

ARRIVAL AT SATYAMANGALAM

Sri Mahasannidhanam and Sri Sannidhanam then proceeded towards Sathyamangalam and were received at the Sringeri Shankara Math.
Dhuli Pada Puja was performed by Dharmadhikari Sri Venkataraman. In His Anugraha Bhashanam, Sri Mahasannidhanam said that
Sathyamangalam has always been blessed many times as the entry point into Tamil Nadu for the Sringeri Jagadgurus. Later that
night, Sri Sannidhanam performed the Sharada Chandramoulishwara Pooja.

SRI ADI SHANKARA TEMPLE KUMBHABHISHEKA

On March 15, 2017, Sri Mahasannidhanam performed the Kumbhabhisheka of Sri Adi Shankaracharya temple in the Sringeri Shankara Math
in Sathyamangalam. The Prathishta of a Utsava Murti of Sri Adi Shankaracharya also took place. Sri Sannidhanam performed the
Shikhara Kumbhabhisheka atop the Vimana Gopura of the temple. Thereafter, the Ubhaya Jagadgurus gave Darshan to devotees.
Sri Sannidhanam distributed Tirtha Prasadam.

GURU VANDANA

In the evening, a Guru Vandana program was held. Sri Sannidhanam in His Tamil Anugraha Bhashanam recounted the visit of
His Parapara Guru (the 33rd Acharya) to Sathyamangalam in the 19th century and His observation of Chaturmasya in 1891 CE
in Sathyamangalam. Sri Sannidhanam also remembered that Sathyamangalam occupies a unique place in the life history of
His Parameshti Guru and Jivanmukta, Jagadguru Sri Chandrashekhara Bharati Mahaswamiji (it was here that the Mahaswamiji,
who was not known to speak in Tamil, had to the pleasant surprise of all, delivered His first Tamil Anugraha Bhashanam in
chaste Tamil). Sri Mahasannidhanam in His Anugraha Bhashanam explained the qualities of a true devotee as explained in the
Srimad Bhagavad Gita. A true devotee would not hate any one; he would be affectionate towards all; he would be filled with
compassion on observing the suffering of others; he would be free of Ahankara or pride; he would be free of selfishness,
and would not state “this is mine, that is mine”; and be equanimous in joy and sorrow. Sri Mahasannidhanam said that the
Prathishta Kumbhabhisheka of Sri Adi Shankaracharya had taken place 25 years back. Now the Kumbhabhisheka had again been
performed. Sri Mahasannidhanam expressed happiness that the disciples at Sathyamangalam had come together and collectively
taken efforts to build the Sringeri Shankara Math, and blessed all the devotees.

Later that night, Sri Sannidhanam performed the Sharada Chandramoulishwara Pooja.

On March 16, 2017, Sri Sannidhanam visited the Meenakshi Sundareshwara temple and Sri Rama Anjaneya temple in Sathyamangalam
and had Darshan. After granting Darshan and blessing devotees with Aashirmantrakshatas, the Ubhaya Jagadgurus started from
Sathyamangalam and proceeded towards Gobichettipalayam.
