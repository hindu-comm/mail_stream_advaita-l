Sri Nithin Sridhar writes:

In this paper, I examine the influence of Advaita Vedānta on Sarvajña –one
of the most renowned Vīraśaiva saints. He was a Kannada poet and
philosopher of the 16th century. He is famous for his three-lined vacanas
or poems called ‘tripadi’. These poems deal with a variety of subjects
ranging from philosophy and devotion, to ethical guidelines and useful
nuggets for daily living.

After giving a brief background of the saint-poet, the paper talks about
various Advaitic ideas in the compositions of Sarvajña. It deals with
concepts like Brahman, īśvara, jagat, Jīvanmukta, māyā, jñāna,
Sādhana-Catuṣṭaya, and mokṣa as discussed by Sarvajña with appropriate
citations.

These central philosophical themes in the Hindu tradition as enunciated by
Sarvajña in his vacanas not only reflect the Upaniṣadic teaching, but also
closely follow the philosophy of Ādi Śaṅkarācārya. The paper makes a
significant contribution to understanding the influence of Advaita Vedānta
on other religious and spiritual traditions of India in general, and on
Vīraśaiva tradition in particular.
