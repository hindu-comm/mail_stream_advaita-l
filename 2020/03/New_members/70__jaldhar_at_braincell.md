Ramesh Seshan
-------------

I, Ramesh Seshan 61 years old have currently finished Bhagavath Gita 
understanding supported by Sankara bhashya commentary in understanding the 
same. After enrolling myself in the study of vivekachoodamani and progressing 
further in the pursuit of Advaitha Vedanta study, by taking up texts like 
panchadasi for assimilating, it is my sincere and earnest search to do enquiry 
on the self and experience the bliss of non dual self. My sincere prayers to 
the lotus feet of Adi Sankara and Jagadamba to know who am I.


S Venkata Subramanian

I am a student of Shastra.
