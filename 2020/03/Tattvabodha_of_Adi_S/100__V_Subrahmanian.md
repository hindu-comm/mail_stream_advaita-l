अग्निर् भूतानाम् अधिपतिः स माऽवत्व् इन्द्रो ज्येष्ठानां यमः पृथिव्या वायुर्
अन्तरिक्षस्य सूर्यो दिवश् चन्द्रमा नक्षत्राणाम् बृहस्पतिर् ब्रह्मणो मित्रः
सत्यानां वरुणो ऽपाꣳ समुद्रः स्रोत्यानाम् अन्नꣳ साम्राज्यानाम् अधिपति तन्
मावतु सोम ओषधीनाꣳ सविता प्रसवानाꣳ* रुद्रः पशूनां त्वष्टा रूपाणां विष्णुः
पर्वतानाम् मरुतो गणानाम् अधिपतयस्* ते मावन्तु
पितरः पितामहाः परे ऽवरे ततास् ततामहा इह मावत ।
अस्मिन् ब्रह्मन्न् अस्मिन् क्षत्रे ऽस्याम् आशिष्य् अस्याम् पुरोधायाम्
अस्मिन् कर्मन्न् अस्यां देवहूत्याम् ॥
