Namaste Jayanarayananji
You had written
"The power of any faculty (hearing etc.) of any
individual is only limited, both in quality and
quantity. If one has a limited power, then one
can infer the possibility of a total power of
which he/she is a part.

* So, for each faculty there is a correspond-
ing total power.
* Power itself does not have an independent
function unless there is a wielder of that
power - for example , seeing power is
wielded by the seeing person (jIva) and so
on. Similarly, for the total power, the scrip-
tures visualized a total power wielder,
known as presiding deity for that total
power - the adhiShThAnadevatA - and the sum-
total of the power of all adhiShThAnadevatA's, is
the power wielded by the Lord, Iswara or
Parameswara. The author gives the list of
the adhiShThAnadevatA's and the faculty that each
of the devatas presides over."

That was a lucid explanation about the idea of adhiShThAna devatA. Can you
please elaborate a little more on this concept?

I was reminded of Pujya Swami Dayananada Saraswati Ji, who would often say
that individual "laws" or powers that govern the functioning of the cosmos
at various levels - gross and subtle - represent an "aspect", a partial
manifestation of Parameshwara, and each aspect is invoked as a devatA viz.,
Indra , Varuna etc.

Could you elaborate, for instance, on -
1. Can we talk of there being adhiSThAna devatAs for other entities
encountered in vyavahAra?. Such as planet earth as a whole (prithvI devatA
surely), hills and mountains (maybe himavAn or some parvata devatA?), viral
diseases such as small pox, herpes zoster, nCov-19 etc., (maybe various
female devata-s govern their arising and spreading as per the beliefs in
vogue in indian folk traditions?).

 2. What about devatA-s for modern "discoveries" such as the power of
gravity which is such a huge cosmic determinant of the way things are in
this physical universe? Is there an adhidaivika aspect viz., a devata for
gravity?


3.  If we examine the case of cosmic laws that govern the energetic
functioning of all stars, then the Sun itself is just a small Star, one
among billions. So can we assert that this vedic devatA revealed as "sUrya"
is the wielder of the samaShTi power behind all stars which makes them
function using fusion etc., the way they do, not only our Sun?

Warm regards

Om

Raghav
