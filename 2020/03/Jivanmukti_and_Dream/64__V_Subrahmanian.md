In the 5th Canto, beginning, there is a dialogue between Priyavrata and
Brahmaa. In the course of the dialogue, the words of the Lord are recounted:
मुक्तोऽपि तावद्बिभृयात्स्वदेहमारब्धमश्नन्नभिमानशून्यः
यथानुभूतं प्रतियातनिद्रः किं त्वन्यदेहाय गुणान्न वृङ्क्ते १६

Even if one is liberated, he nevertheless accepts the body he has received
according to his past karma. Without misconceptions, however, he regards
his enjoyment and suffering due to that karma the way an awakened person
regards a dream he had while sleeping. He thus remains steadfast and never
works to achieve another material body under the influence of the three
modes of material nature.

The ideas of Jivanmukti, Prarabdha karma bhoga by him and the simultaneous
idea of his not identifying with it, on the analogy of a man who has woken
up from a dream not identifying with the dream person/s and events.

Sri Vijayadhvaja Tirtha, of the Madhva following, says: जीवन्मुक्तोऽपि
यावत् प्रारब्धकर्मनाशः तावत् स्वदेहं बिभृयात् |  [Even the Jivanmukta will
bear his body till the exhaustion of the prarabdha karma.]
