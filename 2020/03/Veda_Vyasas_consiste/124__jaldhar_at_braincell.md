It is not about flowers or brickbats.  This list is for people to learn 
about Advaita Vedanta, the path to moksha.  If someone is misleading 
others (or themselves!) about that subject it needs to be addressed.

I thought you were "a mumukshu who confines himself to Upanishads and Sri 
Shankara's commentaries"  As far as I know, Sri Shankara did not write 
articles for "The Mountain Path."  However I don't confine myself in that 
way so I'll gladly read the quote.

But I must ask you, Did "The Mountain Path" publish a February 1972 issue? 
Or any subsequent issues? Why if only one book is sufficient?  Did Ramana 
only ever read one book or quote one book.  In fact in a post on the same 
day as yours, Akilesh Ayyar gave an example of RM quoting the Mahabharata. 
Do you really think someone who reads/studies the Mahabharata consider 
doing the same to the Bhagavata "a waste of time and energy."?

For a would-be Advaitin you have some strange classifications.  These 
categories "simple minded mumukshus" and "eminent scholars" do not exist 
in our sampradaya.  The Vedantic process is the same for all alike viz. 
shravana, manana, and niddhidhyasana.  All these stages a mumukshu (one 
who _desires_ moksha) must pursue enthusiastically. Maybe he might fall 
short compared to others may be go further but he cannot avoid them.
