 Thank you HS ji.

However, Shankara says :

सामान्यविषयः अयं प्रश्नो न अप्रविभज्य प्रतिवचनं अर्हति इति - 

So, for the shloka:

ये शास्त्रविधिमुत्सृज्य यजन्ते श्रद्धयाऽन्विताः।
तेषां निष्ठा तु का कृष्ण सत्त्वमाहो रजस्तमः।।17.1।।

can we conclude the answer to be:

विधिहीनमसृष्टान्नं मन्त्रहीनमदक्षिणम्।
श्रद्धाविरहितं यज्ञं तामसं परिचक्षते।।17.13।।

When Arjuna poses the question that if a person performs the sacrifice with faith and under what category he can be placed.
The answer is found in 13th shloka as 'tAmasa'. 

I was discussing this also with one scholar and he said that the 1st shloka which is posed as question should be disassociated with this chapter and should be observed independently.

Namaste. 

Three types of human beings are recognized. First are thosewho are aware of the shastras but due to lack of faith in them act according totheir own sweet will and pleasure. They are termed as ones endowed with AsurItendencies or asurAs. The second category of human beings are those who knowthe shastras and with abundant faith perform actions in accordance with thesame. They are termed as ones endowed with daIvI (दैवी) tendencies or as daIvIs (दैवी). The third category are those who have noparticular concerns regarding shastras, but have firm faith in their elders andaccordingly perform acts in accordance with whatever their elders wereperforming irrespective of whether they conformed to shastras or not. Thetraits of both the first two categories are to be found in this third categoryin different degrees.

The first two categories are covered in Chapter 16 of BGwhile the third category forms the subject matter for Chapter 17. 

Thus there is no contradiction between the verses mentionedin the post as they pertain to different categories of human beings.

Namaste,

यः शास्त्रविधिमुत्सृज्य वर्तते कामकारतः।
न स सिद्धिमवाप्नोति न सुखं न परां गतिम्।।16.23।।

ये शास्त्रविधिमुत्सृज्य यजन्ते श्रद्धयाऽन्विताः।
तेषां निष्ठा तु का कृष्ण सत्त्वमाहो रजस्तमः।।17.1।।

With reference to above two shlokas of BG vide 16.23 & 17.1, the 
former is "शास्त्रं वेदः तस्य विधिं कर्तव्याकर्तव्यज्ञानकारणं विधिप्रतिषेधाख्यम्" ie., 
"not following the vidhi & nishedhas as per the scriptures and acts as 
per the impulsion of his passion" ; whereas, the later one is 
"शास्त्रविधिम् अपश्यन्तः वृद्धव्यवहारदर्शनादेव श्रद्दधानतया"
ie., by ignoring the scriptural injunctions who follow as per their elders.

If we go by the former one, one attains happiness neither here nor elsewhere. 
Hence, Bhagavan Krishna urges to follow the scriptural injunctions.

If we go by the later one, here also, scriptural injunctions are not followed
but the doer follows his elders and acts as per his sweet will and 
his faith is called स्वभावजा. 

When the later is स्वभावजा which is not as per scriptural injunctions 
'ये शास्त्रविधिमुत्सृज्य यजन्ते श्रद्धयाऽन्विताः' how come Bhagavan Krishna says 
"अशास्त्रविहितं घोरं तप्यन्ते ये तपो जनाः" and "अफलाकाङ्क्षिभिर्यज्ञो विधिदृष्टो य इज्यते".

Here, अशास्त्रविहितं (न शास्त्रविहितम्) and विधिदृष्टो (शास्त्रचोदनादृष्टो) are used. 

Are these not self-contradictory & mutually exclusive statements when the 
shraddha itself is 'svabhAvajA' which is based on not following the scriptures 
"शास्त्रविधिमुत्सृज्य".

Pls throw some light on the above.

Regards,
sriram
