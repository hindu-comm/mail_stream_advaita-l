HARI OM

In fact, I believe the essence of the teaching about "Jivanmukti" has been always the same, however there have been different approaches to the same goal within Vedanta. 
To have a nice review about the historical 'evolution' on "Jivanmukti", I recommend this book of professor Andrew O. Fort: 
JIVANMUKTI IN TRANFORMATION
Embodied Liberation in Advaita and Neo-Vedanta

Asunto: [Advaita-l] jIvanmukti (liberation right in this life) - A State or Stutus

It appears as though there has been a historical shift in the concept of “ jIvanmukti” (Liberation right in this life) — from the Upanishadic times to Shankara to Vidyaranya to modern day.

Perhaps from being a mere transitional “state” of a short duration before one attains videhamukti (liberation without the body), jIvanmukti seems to have become a prestigious “Status,” a position or almost an “ideal” to be achieved by a seeker.

Will appreciate receiving informed inputs. regards, _______________________________________________
