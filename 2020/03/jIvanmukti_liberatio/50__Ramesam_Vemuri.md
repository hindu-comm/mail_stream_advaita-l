Dear Shri Sreenivasa Murthy Ji,

Namaskarams.

Thank you for the very useful list of the Upanishadic and ShankarabhAShya
quotes regarding "mukti" and your narration on what the nature of 'me' is.

Needless for me to say that the Upanishadic position or Shankara's words on
mokSha are never in doubt.

The question I posed has a much narrower focus. It is about mapping
discernible changes (if any) in historical time in the teaching about one
living with a body as a Self-realized individual.

warm regards,
