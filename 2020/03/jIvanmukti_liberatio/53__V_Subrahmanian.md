This is what Shankara says in the Bh.Gita bhashya 9.22:

ननु अन्येषामपि भक्तानां योगक्षेमं वहत्येव भगवान् । सत्यं वहत्येव ; किन्तु
अयं विशेषः — अन्ये ये भक्ताः ते आत्मार्थं स्वयमपि योगक्षेमम् ईहन्ते ;
अनन्यदर्शिनस्तु न आत्मार्थं योगक्षेमम् ईहन्ते ; न हि ते जीविते मरणे वा
आत्मनः गृद्धिं कुर्वन्ति ; केवलमेव भगवच्छरणाः ते ; अतः भगवानेव तेषां
योगक्षेमं वहतीति ॥ २२ ॥

Essence: Those who have identified with Brahman do not desire (and act to
fulfill the desire) in living or in death.   Anandagiri clarifies:

योगक्षेमम् उद्दिश्य स्वयम् ईहन्ते - चेष्टां कुर्वन्ति, इति यावत् ।


आत्मविदां स्वार्थं योगक्षेमम् उद्दिश्य चेष्टाभावं स्पष्टयति -


न हीति ।

गुद्धिः - अपेक्षा, कामना । ताम् इत्येतत् ।


Others will work in order to fulfill their desires. But not the Jnani. He
has no desire and action (in living or death).

From this it is clear that the very idea of 'hoping to live long' is
antithetical to Advaita Jnani.

In fact Bhagvan Ramana has said: The jnani will be only waiting for the
fall of the body.  (Not literally, though). He gives the example of a man
who is carrying a huge load of firewood on his back/head will be keen on
unloading it (at the appropriate time/location).
