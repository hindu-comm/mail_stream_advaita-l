It appears as though there has been a historical shift in the concept of “
jIvanmukti” (Liberation right in this life) — from the Upanishadic times to
Shankara to Vidyaranya to modern day.

Perhaps from being a mere transitional “state” of a short duration before
one attains videhamukti (liberation without the body), jIvanmukti seems to
have become a prestigious “Status,” a position or almost an “ideal” to be
achieved by a seeker.

Will appreciate receiving informed inputs. regards,
