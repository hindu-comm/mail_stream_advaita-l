A small addendum -
The acharya says that the jivanmukta can live and teach even long after
GYAnam and in fact this is how the Advaita parampara survives to this day.

Otherwise the mahavAkya upadesha will be tantamount to a "suicide mantra" -
if student were to drop the body the moment he understands the mahAvAkya. A
single dose and it's all over. (OrE Dose uDane close) People will fear to
even come close to and hear the mahAvAkya teaching.

In this context, it can be said that a jIvanmukta will live long etc. (As
per his prArabdha.)

Sometimes the ramifications of jIvanmukti are colorfully rendered such as
in yogavAsiShTha included in Sri Ramana's supplement to forty verses on
reality.


सवसन्तस्य वृक्षस्य सौन्दर्याद्या गुणा इव ।। २० घनरसायनपूर्णसुशीतया विमलया
समया सततं श्रिया ।


Another thing is, I would agree with you if some student prematurely
concludes he has GYAnam and he is now "seeking to live long enjoying" the
phala of GYAnam. Such an attitude contradicts GYAnam and is usually a sign
of inadequate preparedness such as vairagya.

Om
Raghav
