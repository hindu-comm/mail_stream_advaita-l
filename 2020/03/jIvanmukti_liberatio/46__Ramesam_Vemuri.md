Subrahmanian Garu,

Namaskarams.
There is absolutely  no dispute in what you say, Sir.

The verses of BG 2.55 to the end of the chapter are a "means", as Shankara
says, "For, everywhere in spiritual science (*adhyAtma*-*shAstra*), the
very  characteristic attributes of the successful Yogin are taught as the
means (of attaining that stage), since they are to be attained by effort."

Now, having adopted the means, an ignoramus would eventually shed his/her
ignorance and abide in *jnAna *as a *jIvanmukta*. The question is whether
the phase of *jIvanmukti *is a short transitory state after which s/he
would be in total identity with the formless *brahman *(as *videhamukta *-
having completely disembodied) or whether s/he would look forward to live
long, drawing on the "fruits" of attaining the *jnAna.*
