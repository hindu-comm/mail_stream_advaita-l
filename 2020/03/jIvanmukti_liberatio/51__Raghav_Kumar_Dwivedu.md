Namaste Ramesam garu
The idea of a jivanmukta living long is quite ok. We have examples of
Trailanga Swami of Varanasi who came from Vizianagaram in Andhra and lived
most of his life in Kashi.  There is authentic historical evidence that he
lived for more than a couple of centuries. Sri Ramakrishna Paramhansa
attests to his holiness when he met him on a visit to Kashi circa 1860.

Even a couple of centuries of life as a jivanmukta is transient in the
larger picture, surely.

The problematic phrase is "hoping to live long" which does not of course
sit well with the idea of jivanmukti. And I suspect the Swamiji whom you
are having in mind would have used it in jest, rather than as a profound
doctrinal statement, given that even a straggler in Vedanta would know
better.
