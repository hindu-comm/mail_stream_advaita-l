In a way, the above could be seen positively too, for Shankara, at the
commencement of the delineation of the sthitaprajna (jivanmukta) traits in
the Bh.G 2nd ch. says:

यो ह्यादित एव संन्यस्य कर्माणि ज्ञानयोगनिष्ठायां प्रवृत्तः, यश्च कर्मयोगेन,
तयोः ‘प्रजहाति’ इत्यारभ्य आ अध्यायपरिसमाप्तेः स्थितप्रज्ञलक्षणं साधनं
चोपदिश्यते । सर्वत्रैव हि अध्यात्मशास्त्रे कृतार्थलक्षणानि यानि तान्येव
साधनानि उपदिश्यन्ते, यत्नसाध्यत्वात् । यानि यत्नसाध्यानि साधनानि लक्षणानि च
भवन्ति तानि श्रीभगवानुवाच —
श्रीभगवानुवाच — प्रजहाति यदा कामान्सर्वान्पार्थ मनोगतान् । आत्मन्येवात्मना
तुष्टः स्थितप्रज्ञस्तदोच्यते ॥ ५५ ॥
//In the entire Adhyatma Shastra, the scripture related to the Self, the
traits of the Jivanmukta alone constitute the means for the aspirant since
the goal of jivanmukti is attainable by effort. Hence, those traits that
are attainable thru effort are being explained here...//
So, it is a kind of imitation. One has to consciously come to 'behave',
conduct, like a Jivanmukta.
