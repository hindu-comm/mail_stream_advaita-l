Sri Ramesam Ji,

Namaskarams.

Reg  << But believe me that those teachers even coined terms like one
achieving "Self-realization but with *pratibandhaka-*s." I wonder if
Shakara ever said that there can be "Self-realization" if '*pratibandhaka-*s'
continue to be present >>,

You will notice that this is a very different issue from what you raised
initially. That is why I wanted to know the context in which you made the
initial observation so that the response could be relevant. I will
certainly respond to this current observation of yours after getting your
clarification on the first point. Incidentally I recollect that I had
discussed this very issue with another member through PM a few years back.
I think I know the context of your current observation.

Regards
