Sri Ramesam Ji,

Namaste.

My only doubt was if you were referring to western or our advaitic
commentators. I was not particular about the names per se. Response should
then be in accordance with that.

I cannot imagine what specific text  gave you the impression that  << does
the
seeker, after being liberated, continue to live and "hope to live a long
life" as a *jIvanmukta* >>. It could very well be a misunderstanding of the
relevant text. Perhaps you could  copy the relevant text itself which led
you to such an understanding?. Personally I do not think any text would
have concluded as such.

Regards
