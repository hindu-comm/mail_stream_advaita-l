Dear friends,
What is the way to understand the true import of the word "Tvam"
in the Upanishad teaching "tat tvam asi"
        and abide in and as that understanding?
Sri Shankara says :
      vijnatEryastu vijnAtA
          sa tvaM ityucyatE  || UpadESasAhasri 12-8
That is all.
The journey from 'nAnu' (me) to 'tAnu' (I) is over.
How Simple Atmajnana is!

With respectful namaskars.
Sreenivasa Murthy
