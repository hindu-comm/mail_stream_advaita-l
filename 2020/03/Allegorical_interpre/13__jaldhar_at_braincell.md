This is a question of pramanas.  Why do you think an allegory is not a 
fact?

Ok so you are defining factual as "historical."  Is that the only possible 
definition?

Shastras teach that what happens in the divine realm corresponds to events 
in the material world and vice versa.

There were four things that flow.  The Earth through which rivers flow. 
Plants through which sap flows.  Women through which menstruation flows, 
and the sea through which waves and foam flow.  These are material facts.

Indra committed Brahmahatya and to rid himself of it he divided them 
amongst those four things. This is a fact based on shastra.

Science says that coal is principally made of the element carbon.  That is 
a fact.  Science says that the human body is principally made of the 
element carbon.  That is also a fact.  Society says it is ok to burn coal 
for warmth but if you burn a human being for warmth it will send police to 
arrest you.  That is a fact.  And the reason for your arrest will not be 
that your actions were "unscientific."

I'm afraid that you have misunderstood what the shloka is saying.  Indra 
gave women the ability to feel pleasure from sexual intercourse as a 
_reward_ for taking the burden of one quarter of Indra's brahmahatya which 
manifests as the monthly period (which is often painful for women.)  There 
is nothing sinful about kama and artha in unison with dharma.  In fact 
guides to dharma shastra insist that seeing to his wifes satisfaction is 
one of the duties of a male grhastha.  Her needs may be very high or very 
low that is up to the individual couple.
