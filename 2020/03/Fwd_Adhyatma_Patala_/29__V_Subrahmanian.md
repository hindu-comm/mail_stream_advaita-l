Subbuji,

There are two translations of Adhyatmapatala, by R.S. Narasimhan and Trevor
Leggett. Both are not available on the internet. Both the books seem to be
out of print.

Some extracts from the Leggets books are available online at

regards
shankara

Dear Shankara ji,

There is bhashya of Shankara on the Adhyatma Patala section of the
Apasthamba Dharma sutras.  If there is any English translation of this
bhashya, could you pl. try and locate it?

it is for the sake of someone I am looking for this.

Thanks
subbu
