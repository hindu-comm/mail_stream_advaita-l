Ayurvedic Doctor Sri Gokulakrishnan Iyer of Srirangam has rendered the five
shlokas in a soul stirring way.

Pancharatnam is a short work of Srimad Appayya Dikshitendra in praise of
Siva-lingas located in five different holy places in Tamil Nadu that
represent the five Mahabhutas or elements. Lord Ekamranatha of Kanchi,
 Lord Jambukeshvara of Tiruvanaikkaval, Lord Arunachaleshvara of
Tiruvannamalai, Lord Kalahastishvara, and Lord Chitsabhesha of Chidambaram
represent
the Prthivi (Earth), Jala (Water), Agni (Fire), Vayu (Air) and the Akasha
Mahabhutas respectively.

These five verses and the sixth one giving the phala-stuti were found
scattered in different places in Srimad Appayya Dikshitendra Vijayam of Sri
KV Subrahmanya Sastrigal, a descendant of Dikshitendra. An attempt has been
made, by the Tamil Smarta, to collect all of them and present them here.
