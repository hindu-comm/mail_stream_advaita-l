Many thanks Sri Venkata Raman for sharing this story from the very text the
scholar mentioned.  Today, while listening to another discourse of this
very scholar, I was pleasantly surprised to hear this very story related by
him and what is more, he even cited the Shankara Bhashya passage I had
shared in my post.  Here is that very interesting discourse:

He cites Shankara's stotras, incidents, etc.
