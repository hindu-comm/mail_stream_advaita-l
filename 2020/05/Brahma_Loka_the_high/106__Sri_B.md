Subbu much appreciated for detailed replies. You mentioned: "Yes. If one strives for Nirguna Atma jnana but dies before attaining, he is called Yoga bhrashTa and will go to punya lokas, have bhogas, and return to this world to continue his sadhana from where he left in the earlier birth.” - I am bit confused….when we say ‘mukti', does it not mean ‘release from samsara - transmigration’. Where is the question of returning to this world. If a return is envisaged then it is no different to the concept of reward of going to the heaven and returning back to this world as preached in Christianity. It is either a ‘mukti’ or ‘transmigration’. 

Secondly are you able to elaborate on the gradations, I am just curious. When you say depends on spiritual practices, what are you implying, are you saying the belief system i.e. Vaishnava vs Shivasam? 

Thank you
Sridhar

Former is the result of shedding avidya and discovering the Self as the Brahman (nirguna), which happens instantaneously and while in this body.  On death of the body, the Jeevanmukta also gets freed of the sukshma sharira and therefore attains freedom from samsara, which is in my understanding, referred to as Videhi Mukti.

> Pitambara tika on Vicharsaagar mentions that Vaikuntha, Kailash, Deviloka etc. are Brahmaloka only. It is a special feature of this loka that it appears differently to different upaasakas according to their Samskaras. The same loka appears as presided by Vishnu being surrounded by Chaturbhuja brahmalokvaasis for a Vishnu Upasaka and presided by Mahadeva and surrounded by Trinetra-dhaari brahmalokavaasis for a rudra upasaka and so on. Others suggest that Vaikuntha, Kailasha etc. are different spheres of existence within Brahmaloka itself. Those who attain the highest level definitely have Krama-mukti at the end of a Kalpa.

Does it mean that the Atma will reside in an another world and will gradually makes its way to what (the Brahman?)
