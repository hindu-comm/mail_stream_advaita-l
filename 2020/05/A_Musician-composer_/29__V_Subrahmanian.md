Incident of a devotee with Jagadguru Sri Sacchidananda Shivabhinava
Nrisimha Bharati Mahaswamin

 Sri Maha Vaidyanatha Iyer was a great Carnatic Composer of the 19th
Century, from Thiruvaiyaru was a highly devout Shiva bhakta sbd performed
Sandhyavandanam meticulously even stopping his concerts at appointed time
for Sandhyavandanam.
.
It was his desire to visit Sringeri so he walked all the way from Tamil
Nadu to Sringeri. Upon reaching, the 33rd Jagadguru, Sri Sacchidananda
Shivabhinava Nrusimha Bharathi Mahaswamin was performing the routine Sri
Chandramouleeshwara pooja. Immersed in the bliss of Shiva pooja, he
instantly composed and started singing a kriti on Jagadguru Mahaswamin
(Abhinava Shankara). The composition is none other than " Sri Shankara
Guruvaram Chintayami Bhavaharam " in Raaga Naagasvaraalee which is a
beautiful kriti even to this day. Pleased by his vidwath in Carnatic music
and Shivabhakti, Jagadguru Mahaswamin composed a beautiful sanskrit couplet
praying for Iyer's long life. This very incident of mahatmas show how
compassionate our Jagadgurus were towards the Vidwans and Sadhakas who
followed and fostered their Swadharma without any compromise.
