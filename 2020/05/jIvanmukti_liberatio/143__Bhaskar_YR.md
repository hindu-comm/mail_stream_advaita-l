>  Sorry for the belated response. Just would like to hear more from you with regard to the following :


It appears as though there has been a historical shift in the concept of “ jIvanmukti” (Liberation right in this life) — from the Upanishadic times to Shankara to Vidyaranya to modern day.

>  Would it be possible for you to elaborate the historical shift from the Upanishad times to shankara's time.  It seems you are implying that shankara might have said something more / less with regard to the jeevanmukti. Some of the Later Advaita Acharya-s explained jeevanmukti based on gradations in jnana and experience of nirvikalpa samAdhi ( asaMprajnAta samAdhi in yOga terms).  Let us not discuss about it.  Interested to hear your view points only with regard to paradigm shift from Upanishads to shankara.   

Perhaps from being a mere transitional “state” of a short duration before one attains videhamukti (liberation without the body), jIvanmukti seems to have become a prestigious “Status,” a position or almost an “ideal” to be achieved by a seeker.

>  jeevanmukta or paramArtha jnAni has to continue in his current body as it is "inevitable".  The jnAni has no other choice but to remain in his current BMI due to prArabdha and as per some avidyA lesha.  So, Jeevan mukti is gauNa mukti as it has the remnants of avidyA  and Videha mukti is mukhya mukti because jnAni shed his prArabda janita deha too...this is  according to some.  

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!
