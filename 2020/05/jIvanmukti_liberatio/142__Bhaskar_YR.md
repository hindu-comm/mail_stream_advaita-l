The earlier *shloka*s in *aparokShAnubhUti* make it abundantly clear that the concept of *prArabdha* was brought in the *shruti *commentaries only for the sake of the ignorant.

praNAms Sri Ramesam prabhuji
Hare Krishna

The above is beautifully established by apt quotes.  My heartfelt praNAms to you prabhuji.  The jnAni's deha dhAraNa, his prArabdha, his socalled activities (questionable sometimes!!) etc. have been explained for those who are still seeing the 'physical body' of the jnAni.  But jnAni's realization is that he was / is / will ever be ashareeri only as he is nothing but brahman / Atman ( brahmavidApnoti paraM, brahma vidA brahmaiva bhavati)  Since Atman's svabhAva is ashareeratvaM there is no aviveka bhAva that he is dehadhAri.  In chAndOgya shruti bhAshya,  bhAshyakAra explains this very clearly : ashareerasvabhAvasya AtmanaH tadevAhaM shareeraM shareerameva cha ahaM iti avivekAtmabhAvaH sashareeratvaM.  I read somewhere, Sri DS of arshavidyA gurukulam gives an example of a person who has three wives, after his death which wife becomes a widow??  Obviously all the three wives...likewise, when socalled shareeri jnAni realizes that he is ashareeri in reality,  the wives of shareeri jnAni  i.e. saNchita, AgAmi, prArabdha all become widow at the same time. So, coming back to gati of the talks about  jnAni's continuation of dehadharaNa and resultant activities like upadesha, bhikshAcharya, daily routine etc. is for the ignorant he who still identifying the jnAni with his individual BMI.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
