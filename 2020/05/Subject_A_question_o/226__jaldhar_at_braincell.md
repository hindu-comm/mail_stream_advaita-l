Thank you.  Though I am wondering what that expiation is.  There is 
definitely a school of thought that holds return from sannyasa is 
impossible.  For instance the father of the famous Marathi Sant 
Jnaneshvara was expelled from his community when he tried to do the same.

Another interesting thing I learned from Swamiji is that Ubhaya Bharati 
was also named Sarasvani. I don't think this is mentioned in MDV is it? 
Perhaps it is told in a different digvijaya.

Anway I think I have this book and it is time for a reread.
