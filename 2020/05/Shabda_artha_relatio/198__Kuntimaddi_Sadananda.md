 Lokshe Sharma PraNAms
I think the reference is with respect to pratyaksha pramana.
Naming involves knowing. naama ruupatmakam idam jagat -
jagat is naama and ruupa - ruupa involves object's attributivecontent. Hence it is the specific object that I am seeing with itsattributes.

The existence of an object is established with the knowledge ofits existence.

In a sense, a conscious entity is required. Otherwise, theexistence of an object is indeterminate.

What you mentioned is with respect to shabda pramana and contextshould determine the meaning.

Hari Om!

Sadananda

How is it that name and object (referred by name) are same? In my
understanding names are just placeholders for object, like a bucket which
can hold different objects at different times. Bucket is not the object it
holds.

I see the following contradictions-

1. A name may refer to different objects in different contexts. So name
cannot be same as object.
2. An object may have multiple different names which may not be same. This
won't be possible if name and object are the same.
