Sri Shankaracharya says in Mandukya Upanishad bhashya

"Though the name and the object signified by the name are one and the
same,..."

(Source:

)

How is it that name and object (referred by name) are same? In my
understanding names are just placeholders for object, like a bucket which
can hold different objects at different times. Bucket is not the object it
holds.

I see the following contradictions-

1. A name may refer to different objects in different contexts. So name
cannot be same as object.
2. An object may have multiple different names which may not be same. This
won't be possible if name and object are the same.

Lokesh
