Hi Sridhar,
I am not sure what shravana is, I will find out :-) Right now I am focused on clarity in understanding the work itself.

Hello Soma, 
Spot on. I am sure you will enjoy the reading, as I did. I am hoping you are also doing shravana along side your reading. I found reading as a complementary exercise to shravana more productive, thatâ€™s just my experience. 
Regards
Sridhar
