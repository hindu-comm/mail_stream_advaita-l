 Dear Sri Raghav Kumar Dwivedula,Kindly refer to your posting dated May 19,2020.
Please permit me to draw your kind permission 
to the following Shruti mantrasand to the commentaries by Sri Shankara.This was sent to friend of mine 
who is also a member of this group. 

Quote :
The Advaitic position is this:ahamEvEdagM sarvam || Chandogya 7-25-1AtmaivEdagM sarvam || Chandogya 7-25-2Atmata Eva idagaM sarvam || Chandogya 7-26-1
Sri Shankara writes in his commentaries to 
Brahmasutra 3-2-19, BruhadaraNyaka mantra 2-1-19
and Bruhadaranyaka mantra 2-4-6:(1) AtmA sarvagatatvAt sarvAnanyatvAcca || Brahmasutra 3-2-19(2) AtmavyatirEkENa vastvantarABAvAt || BruhadaraNyaka 2-1-19(3) na hi AtmavyatirEkENa anyat kiMcit asti || Bruhadaranyaka 2-4-6
In the Light of the above teachings What relationship can exist between the object and its attributes which are nothing but appearances as per the Chandogya Sruti which says vAcAramBaNaM vikArO nAmadhEyam .Unquote.The truth about the above teachings can be verified 
and realised within oneself by oneself
by adopting the avastharaya prakriye as taught by Srutiand Sri Shankara only. 
and can arrive at the understanding 
brahmaivedagM visvaM variShTham as taught inMundaka Upanishad.

With respectful namaskars,Sreenivasa Murthy
