Pranams Sri Sadananda Ji,

I am not sure if while talking of difference between the Vivarana and
Bhamati Schools, you are really referring to the meaning assigned to the
term अनन्यत्वम्(ananyatvam) by the two schools. At the vyavahArika level,
relation between substance and its attributes you referred to earlier is
one of the several types of  अनन्यत्वम्(ananyatvam) dealt with in different
schools like nyAya,sAmkhya,VisishtAdvaita,Dvaita(Sri Madhvacharya school)
etc.

Please clarify.

Regards
