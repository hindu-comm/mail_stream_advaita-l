Pranams Sri Sadananda Ji.

As far as I am aware, there are no such differences between the two
branches of Advaitic thoughts in respect of such purely vyAvahAric issues.

To the best of my knowledge Advaitic stand mostly follows that of Mimamsa
School (Bhatta Branch) on such issues. So in your study you have come
across the Mimamsa School, you may safely consider the same as applicable
to Advaita as well. This is my personal view.
