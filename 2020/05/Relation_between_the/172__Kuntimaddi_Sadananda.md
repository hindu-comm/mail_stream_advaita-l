Chandramouli - PraNAms and thanks.
I thought there is a difference in viewpoints between Vivarana and Bhamati schools. Not sure though.
VisheshaNa and Visheshya taking an example of the sweetness of sugar and sugar.
I read of lot of criticisms of other schools of thought starting from Nyaaya vaisheshikas and Buddhistic concepts related to this, but not clear about Advaita siddhanta. Some discussion on samyoga sambandha as in pot on the ground, and swabhaavika sambandha - blue lotus. Yet not sure blue-ness and lotus-ness relationship as per Advaita.

Hari Om!Sadananda

Pranams Sri Sadananda Ji,

Reg << What is Adviatic position regarding the relationship betweenthe object and its attributes?>>,

As far as Sidhanta is concerned, this topic is of significancein those darshanas which admit of भेद(bheda). Since Adavaita does not admit of भेद(bheda) this topic isnot of any significance at the Sidhanta level. Both are mithyA only and treatedas such together. However at the level of vyavahAra (empirical existence), inthe Advaita system they are generally treated according to the Kumārila Bhaṭṭa’sview of Pūrva Mīmāṃsā, व्यवहारे तु भाट्टनयः vyavahAre tu bhATTanayaH.
