Viswa/Taijasa/PrAjna at vyashti level have their equivalent levels in
samashti as Virat/Hiranyagarbha/Iswara. References to them can be found in
Mandukya. You may also like to refer to verses 173 to 176 / Brahmananda
Valli of the Taittiriya Bhashya Vartika of Sri Sureswaracharya translation
and Commentary by R.Balasubrahmanian for an informative review.
