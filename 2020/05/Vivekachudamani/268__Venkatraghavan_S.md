Namaste all,

#Vivekachudamani Part 10 The tenth talk, concludes the commentary to the
second verse by Jagadguru Srimad Chandrashekhara Bharati Mahaswamigal. In
this talk, AchArya confirms that ब्रह्मात्मना संस्थिति: is different from
the four kinds of moksha such as sAlokya, sAmIpya, sArUpya, sAyujyam, which
the AchArya says, is mithyA. The primary mukti, that is referred to in
shAstra is the one that is attained through jnAna, knowledge. Verses 3 - 7
are briefly introduced. In these verses, Adi Shankara BhagavatpAda says the
one who has all the qualifications for moksha is blessed by Ishvara, but if
they fail to use these qualifications to know the self, there cannot be a
greater loss than that. Whatever one does - studying the scriptures,
performing several sacrifices, meditation, etc - unless one has attained
brahma jnAna, the knowledge of Brahman, there is no possibility of
liberation. A reference is made to the maitreyI brAhmaNa of the
bRhadAraNyaka upaniShad अमृतत्वस्य नाशास्ति वित्तेन - there is no scope for
moksha through wealth and all things achievable with wealth - to prove that
jnAna, knowledge alone is the means to moksha. https://youtu.be/s3f7xrdXLzs The
