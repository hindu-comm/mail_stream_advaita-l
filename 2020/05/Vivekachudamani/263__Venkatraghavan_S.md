Namaste,
#Vivekachudamani Part 006
The sixth talk, consists of the commentary to the second verse by Jagadguru
Srimad Chandrashekhara Bharati Mahaswamigal, wherein the AchArya analyses
the phrase ततो विप्रता - amongst those endowed with the right to study the
scriptures, birth as a brAhmaNa - one whose role is to exclusively focus on
the study and propagation of scriptures - is particularly conducive to
moksha. However, merely having an advantage is not useful, one should walk
on the path of dharma in order to secure the benefits of such an advantage,
hence the words तस्माद्वैदिक धर्ममार्ग परता in the second verse. What is
the significance of the word "dharma"?
