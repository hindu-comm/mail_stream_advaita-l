Namaste,
#Vivekachudamani Part 7 The seventh talk, consists of the commentary to the
second verse by Jagadguru Srimad Chandrashekhara Bharati Mahaswamigal,
wherein the AchArya analyses the phrase तस्माद्वैदिकधर्ममार्गपरता - greater
than birth as a human being, with the authority to solely focus on the
study of scriptures, is a life lived in accordance with dharma. AchArya
explains that the vedas are the only source of the knowledge of dharma, and
hence the word "vaidika" is used by Adi Shankara BhagavatpAda in the verse.
