Namaste,
#Vivekachudamani Part 9 The ninth talk, consists of the commentary to the
second verse by Jagadguru Srimad Chandrashekhara Bharati Mahaswamigal,
wherein the AchArya analyses the phrases 1) आत्मानात्मविवेचनम् - superior
to this, is the ability to discriminate between the self and the non-self. 2)
स्वनुभव: - the direct cognition of Brahman following nidhidhyAsanam or
meditation on the meaning of the import of shruti 3) ब्रह्मात्मना संस्थिति:
- the direct cognition of Brahman accompanied by vAsanakshaya and
manonAsha. The significance of these two, potentially confusing terms, is
briefly discussed here. Reference is also made to six the tAtparya linga-s
or marks of import, and to certain aspects from the jIvanmuktiviveka of
vidyAraNya mahAsvAminah. https://youtu.be/JbCueMxgh1Q The text in Sanskrit
