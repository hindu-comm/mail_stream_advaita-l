#Vivekachudamani Part 3

The third talk, consists of the invocatory verses by Jagadguru Srimad
Chandrashekhara Bharati Mahaswamigal to his commentary to the
Vivekachudamani. It also includes the start of his commentary on verse two,
and analyses the phrase जन्तूनां नरजन्म दुर्लभम् - amongst living beings,
the birth as a human being is very rare.
