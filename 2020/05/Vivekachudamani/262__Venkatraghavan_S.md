Namaste,

#Vivekachudamani Part 5

The fifth talk, consists of the commentary to the second verse by Jagadguru
Srimad Chandrashekhara Bharati Mahaswamigal, wherein the AchArya continues
his analysis of the phrase जन्तूनां नरजन्म दुर्लभम् - amongst living
beings, the birth as human beings is very rare.

In this talk, AchArya's commentary invokes the वैषम्यनैर्घृण्य अधिकरणम् of
the brahmasUtra to establish that Ishvara does not award a good birth to
some and punish others with a bad birth out of a sense of partiality
towards some and cruelty towards others. Rather, the type of birth that
Ishvara awards a jIva is a function of the types of karma-s performed by
that jIva. Incidentally, this chapter of the brahmasUtra also provides the
logical justification for the beginninglessness of creation.
