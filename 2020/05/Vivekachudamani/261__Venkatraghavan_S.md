Namaste,
#Vivekachudamani Part 4

The fourth talk, consists of the commentary to the second verse by
Jagadguru Srimad Chandrashekhara Bharati Mahaswamigal, wherein the AchArya
continues his analysis of the phrase जन्तूनां नरजन्म दुर्लभम् - amongst
living beings, the birth as human beings is very rare. AchArya establishes
that this phrase hints at an important doctrine in advaita - the existence
of the self as distinct from the body.
