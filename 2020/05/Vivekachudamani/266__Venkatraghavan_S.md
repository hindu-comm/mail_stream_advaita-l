Namaste,

#Vivekachudamani Part 8 The eighth talk, consists of the commentary to the
second verse by Jagadguru Srimad Chandrashekhara Bharati Mahaswamigal,
wherein the AchArya analyses the phrases 1) तस्माद्वैदिकधर्ममार्गपरता -
greater than birth as a human being, with the authority to solely focus on
the study of scriptures, is a life lived in accordance with dharma 2)
विद्वत्वमस्मात्परम् - greater than the performance of rituals is an
understanding of their meaning and significance. 3) आत्मानात्मविवेचनम् -
superior to this, is the ability to discriminate between the self and the
non-self. https://youtu.be/xtBjrdy7upg The text in Sanskrit is available
