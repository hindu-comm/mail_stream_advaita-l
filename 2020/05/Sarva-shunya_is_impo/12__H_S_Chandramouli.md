Namaste Sri Subrahmanian Ji,

Reg  << The
question would arise: But the mind remains?  Yes, the semblance of the
baadhita manas and the prapancha remain and continue to be perceived by the
person with the light of the Sakshi.  After the fall of the body of this
mukta, there is no more perception of the world and the mind body complex
>>,

This would seem to imply that there is nothing like jIvanmukti. Please
excuse me if such an impression is not intended. I do know that such a view
is prevalent among some advaitins. The post from Sri Sadananda Ji also
would seem to imply that.

I am citing below from commentary by HH Sri Chandrashekhara Bharathi
MahaSwaminah on verse 454 of Vivekachudamani.

<< तत्र तुर्यगाख्यभूमिकांगतस्य ब्रह्मवीद्वरिष्ठस्य
केवलनिर्गुणब्रह्मरूपत्वात् परकृतप्रबोधोपि नास्तीति त्रिविधमपि कर्म नास्ति ।

ब्रह्मात्मैक्यमवेक्ष्य साक्षात्कृत्य तन्मयतया स्वार्थे मयट्
ब्रह्मरूपतयेत्यर्थः ये सर्वदा संस्थिताः तुर्यगां भूमिमारूढाः तेषां तत्
त्रितयं त्रिविधमपि कर्म नहि क्वचिदपि कदाचिदपीत्यर्थः । ते निर्गुणं ब्रह्मैव
। >>
