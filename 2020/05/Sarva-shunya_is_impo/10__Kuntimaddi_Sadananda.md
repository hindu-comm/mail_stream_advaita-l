Chandramouliji - PraNAms
Even in Sushupti, mind, and chidaabhaasa are there but in the subtler state. There are experiences of a) absence of subject-object duality, b) awareness of kaarana shareera or ananda maya kosha resulting a) I slept very well, b) I did not know anything (absence of subject-object duality) and c) I was happy due to b). Thus the mind could recollect once it is awake. There has been extensive discussion in Advaitic literature that it is an experiential statement and not inferential statement. Saakshee is not an experiencer either.
In other words, the mind is functioning at very low level with chidaabhaasa maintaining the sustaining life.
This is my understanding.

 Pranams Sri Sadananda Ji,
I was referring to the revealing of the absence of mind **(refutation of mind and intellect)** in sushupti by Chaitanya as sAkshi. Such revelation (refutation) is not through mind and intellect because it is absent.

Not exactly. It is recollection of the samskAra of its refutation later by
the mind and intellect.
