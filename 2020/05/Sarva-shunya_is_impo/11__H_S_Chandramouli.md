Pranams Sri Sadananda Ji,

That is not my understanding. Mind (and chidAbhAsa) is resolved (laya) in
sushupti into its kAraNa namely avidyA. What is present is avidyA. Mind is
not present in subtle form, it is resolved into its causal (kAraNa) form.
The experiences you have mentioned are attributed to the revelation by
sAkshi of the three avidyA vrittIs (not antahkaraNa vrittIs or mental
vrittIs). Recollection on wakingup is certainly experiential and not
inferential.I am copying below relevant parts from Sidhanta Bindu of Sri
Madhusudana Saraswati

<< एवं जाग्रत्स्वप्नभोगद्वयेन श्रान्तस्य जीवस्य तदुभयकारणकर्मक्षये
ज्ञानशक्त्यवच्छिन्नस्य सवासनस्यान्तःकरणस्य कारणात्मनावस्थाने सति
विश्रामस्थानं सुषुप्त्यवस्था ।  >>

tadubhayakAraNakarmakShaye j~nAnashaktyavachChinnasya
savAsanasyAntaHkaraNasya kAraNAtmanAvasthAne sati vishrAmasthAnaM
suShuptyavasthA | >>

Translation  (All translations by Sri PC Divan Ji)  << In the same manner,
the resting-place of the individual soul tired by the enjoyment made in the
states of waking and dreaming and having (his) inner organ together with
(his) latent desires as limited by the power of cognition, resting in the
state of the (original) cause, is the state of deep sleep >>.

<<  न किञ्चिदवेदिषमिति कारणमात्रोपलम्भः सुषुप्तिः । तत्र
जाग्रत्स्वप्नभोग्यपदार्थज्ञानाभावेपि साक्ष्याकारं, सुखाकारं, अवस्थाऽज्ञानाकारं
चाविद्यायाः वृत्तित्रयमभ्युपेयते । >>

<<  na ki~nchidavediShamiti kAraNamAtropalambhaH suShuptiH | tatra
jAgratsvapnabhogyapadArthaj~nAnAbhAvepi sAkShyAkAraM, sukhAkAraM,
avasthA.aj~nAnAkAraM chAvidyAyAH vRRittitrayamabhyupeyate | >>
Translation  <<  Sushupti is the cognition of the cause only in the form “I
did not know anything”. It is believed that even though there is the
absence in that state of the knowledge the substances capable of being
enjoyed in the states of waking and dreaming, there is a triad of Vrittis
of avidyA which assumes the form of (one’s being) a witness, of (one’s)
being happy, and of being a state of ignorance. And owing to the absence of
egotism there is not one specific Vritti for in that case there would not
be the state of deep sleep >>.

In the absence of the अहङ्कार (aha~NkAra) naturally a question arises how
is it then that a man feels on rising that he was sleeping. The answer to
that is supplied by the following.

<< मुखप्रतिबिम्बाश्रये दर्पणे जपाकुसुमलौहित्याध्यासे रक्तं मुखमिति
प्रतीतिवदहङ्काराश्रयसाक्षिचैतन्यस्य स्मरणाश्रयत्वात् अहमस्वाप्समिति
सामानाधिकरण्यप्रतीतिः, न पुनरहं सुखीति वाश्रयतया । >>

<<  mukhapratibimbAshraye darpaNe japAkusumalauhityAdhyAse raktaM mukhamiti
pratItivadaha~NkArAshrayasAkShichaitanyasya smaraNAshrayatvAt
ahamasvApsamiti sAmAnAdhikaraNyapratItiH, na punarahaM sukhIti vAshrayatayA
| >>

Translation  by Sri PC Divan Ji  <<  The cognizance of the Self in the role
of the witness which is dependent upon egotism (for manifestation) takes
place by a case in apposition in the form “I was sleeping” owing to its
being the substratum of recollection, like the cognizance “the face is red”
which takes place on the superimposition of the redness of the china rose
on the mirror which is the substratum of the reflection of the face, and
not as being dependent (upon something else) as (in the feeling) “I am
happy” >>.
Meaning of the above in simpler language  ( By Sri PC Divan Ji)  <<  The
feeling that arises namely, ‘I was sleeping’ is similar to the feeling ‘My
face is red’ which arises on seeing one’s reflection side by side with the
redness of a china rose in a mirror, not to the feeling ‘I am happy’. The
difference is that while in the former the अहङ्कार (aha~NkAra) was not
present at the same time as the state of sleeping, in the latter it is
present at the same time as the enjoyment of happiness  >>.

It would be useful to refer to Panchadashi  Ch 11 verses 64-74which
explains sushupti and Anandamaya kOsha.
