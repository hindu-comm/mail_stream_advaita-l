Subbuji - PraNAms
Yes. That is true. Unfortunately many have misconceptions regarding this. Terms that are used - you have to go beyond the mind, mind has to be dropped - some based on Bhagan Ramana Maharshi's statement -maaanas santu kim maargane kRite,naiva maanasam, maagra aarjavaat'implying the mind itself disappears.
What really disappears is the mind with notions that I am = this.
Similarly nirvikalpaka samaadhi - presumption is there will not be the mind.
Mind with the absence of all notional though but with contemplative thought of Self or Brahman will remain.
As you mentioned the mind drops out only during vedeha mukti to become one with Hiranya garba.

True, mind alone can and needs to refute the anatma; sakshi has neither the
need nor the ability to do that. That mind which does that is the 'informed
mind, su-samksruta manas.' What is the samskara it gets? The Vedanta
shaastra provides the samskara to the mind by informing it that the Sakshi
that is beyond the mind is the Self. So, with this information,, samskara,
the mind does that discrimination and 'knows' that it has done it. The
question would arise: But the mind remains? Yes, the semblance of the
baadhita manas and the prapancha remain and continue to be perceived by the
person with the light of the Sakshi. After the fall of the body of this
mukta, there is no more perception of the world and the mind body complex.

Thanks for your observation which is a natural one and needs the above
explanation.
