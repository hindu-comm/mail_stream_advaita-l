Dear Sri Chandramouli ji,

This is the 7th, ultimate,  bhumika of the bhumika concept where the Jnani
who has gone into samadhi  can never come out of his own nor can others
bring him out.  For him there is no perception of the world nor his own
manas/buddhi activity.  He is completely lost for ever to the world, until
death, after which there is no question of talking about him.

The other bhumika-s lower than this where there is samadhi are
brahmavidvareeyaan 6 bhumika where he goes into samadhi and others can
succeed in bringing him out. For him when he is not in samadhi, the
external world is perceived and manas is active.  Below this is the
brahmavid vara the 5th state where he can go in and come out of his own
from samadhi.  The one below, the 4th is a Jnani but not samadhi type.  So
all these four types are jivanmuktas with the above differences.  So, the
condition I specified in my earlier post will be there for the three types
as above.

warm regards
subbu
