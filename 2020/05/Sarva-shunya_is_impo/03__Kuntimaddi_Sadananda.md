Subbuji PraNAms
The external principle as Saakshee is recognized only by Advaitins.
------------So, no one can refute or deny the ephemeral mind and the intellect, and the
world that is perceived and grasped by such intellect, without admitting
the eternal Atman. Why? Because, the mind and the intellect can be refuted
only through an alternative principle that is different from the mind and
intellect.
---------
Yes - but that refutation of mind and intellect is done by the mind only!
Just could not resist!
Hari Om!
