Harih Om Everybody
Actually, upon analysing the English Words more carefully:

   1. Cognition is the initial (first time) perception of any object /
   person by Mind through senses - First instance of learning - could be any
   subject or person etc.
   2. ReCognition is the Repeated-Cognition - i.e. when you perceive the
   same object or person by senses for the second or nth time, - the trigger
   of previous knowledge from memory - so it should be now more
   instantaneous.  This when it fails, we say, Oh I forgot.  We do not need to
   congnize this again, but to resurface it from memory.
