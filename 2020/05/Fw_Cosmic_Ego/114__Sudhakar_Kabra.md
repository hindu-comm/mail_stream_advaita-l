  Namaste Chandramouliji,

Hiranyagarbha is the cosmic sukshma sharira (subtle body) which contains manas, buddhi, chitta and ahankara (ego)


Indivdually ego is a product of ignorance (avidya) and is the main objection for self realization.If cosmic ego exists then what could be its function?Surely it cannot be a function of ignorance but can it be explained with some example to understand.


If my line of thinking is wrong then what should be the correct approach to understand.I will look up the reference given to get some hint.


Thanks and regards
Sudhakar Kabra

Respected members,
Can someone give hints to the following:

It is said that whatever is there in microcosm (Vyasti) is also there in macrocosm (Samasti )Yat ande tat pinde.

Microcosmic (Individualistic) ego is ahamkara. Is there anything called Cosmic Ego?If so, its explanation and/or references needed.

Namaste.

Viswa/Taijasa/PrAjna at vyashti level have their equivalent levels in samashti as Virat/Hiranyagarbha/Iswara. References to them can be found in Mandukya. You may also like to refer to verses 173 to 176 / Brahmananda Valli of the Taittiriya Bhashya Vartika of Sri Sureswaracharyatranslation and Commentary by R.Balasubrahmanian for an informative review.
