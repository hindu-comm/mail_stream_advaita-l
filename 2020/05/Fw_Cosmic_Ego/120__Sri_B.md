Hello Soma,
What I wrote is from my understanding of Sri Sankara Bhagavadpada’s Bhashyam on Sri Gaudapada’s Karika  on Mandukya Upanishad. 
Turiya is that substratum on which the three states are projected. I would avoid referring to it as ‘witness’ or ‘experiencer’ as it would entail dvaitam. A better drishtantham would be that of a screen on which a movie is projected. The screen reflects the light from the projector, similarly the three states are played out on Turiya. All of us get a glimpse of turiya in sushupti however, don’t have a recollection of it in the waking or dream state. This is because of avarna power of ahankara. All that one remembers, when one wakes up, is a desire to go back to sleep!!, the reason is ‘something’ which can’t be expressed is pulling us. Some people would say that they had a sound sleep, most would perhaps say “I don’t remember” or “I don’t know". If one manages to extend the deep sleep unto the waking state then that state is Sahaja Samadhi. That can happen only by shedding/removal of (apavadha) the ignorance (i.e effect of adhyaropa, superimposing the body, mind, intellect complex as the Atma), which is atma shakshat karam (Aham Bodham). 
Hope it helps.
Regards
Sridhar

Both has the power of - Avarna (veiling) and Vikshepa (projection) - which ensures Ignorance of Atma for an Individual and the Brahman of the cosmic. One can even argue that mind is the tool of Maya, through which it creates this illusion of ahankar. The pramana is the three states - waking, dreaming and the deep sleep. In deep sleep, as we know, absence of mind leads to absence of ahankar and equally absence of Maya, as an Individual is unaware of space & time. Space and time are aspects of Maya.

When realized the individual atma is no more because it devolves into Ishvara.What is its function? One of its attributes is it has no function that we can relate to. It exists, and it is all that exists. Soma
