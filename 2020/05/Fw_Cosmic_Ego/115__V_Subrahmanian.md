While the individual ego is avidya and an obstacle, the cosmic ego is also
in the realm of avidya but not binding. It does not have the limiting ideas
of 'this is he, different from me, etc.' Yet, the idea of 'I' in the
collective jiva corpus is there. This is not ridden with raga-dvesha. That
is why Shankara calls it 'svaccha' and the aspirant has to attain that
svacchatvam, he says. Transcending even this is required. The next step is
identifying with the Pure Self after which there is no more attaining.

This is how it appears to me.
