yathā taror mūla-niṣecanenatṛpyanti tat-skandha-bhujopaśākhāḥprāṇopahārāc
ca yathendriyāṇāṁtathaiva sarvārhaṇam acyutejyā(SB 4.31.14
<http://vanisource.org/wiki/SB_4.31.14>)
This is a verse from the Bhagavatam.
"By giving water to the root of a tree one satisfies its branches, twigs
and leaves, and by supplying food to the stomach one satisfies all the
senses of the body. Similarly, by engaging in the worship of the Lord
Achyuta, one automatically satisfies all living entities."

Can someone clarify what exactly the phrase sarvArhaNam acyutejyA means, in
the above verse?
The above verse can inducate that the upAsanam  of Ishvara through japa
dhyAnam etc., is not a "self-centred" or a purely solitary pursuit which
involves withdrawing or cutting oneself off from the whole of creation,
rather it (Ishvara upAsanam) keeps a person intimately connected to all of
creation. In that sense it is a type of paropakAra as well, as much as the
other reaching out activities like dAnam etc.
The ISKCON movement likes to quite the above verse though they take it
(wrongly) to mean that worship of all other devatA-s is subsumed under
Krishna worship.
