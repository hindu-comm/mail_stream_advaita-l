In this case they have the correct understanding as the Shridhari on this 
shloka indicates.  The import of this entire adhyaya is that Vishnu 
Bhagavan is the cause of all and pervades all.  Therefore by worshipping 
Him, you are worshipping everything that comes from Him.

Of course you can take this the other way.  By worshipping anything (that 
is fit to be worshipped) you are actually worshipping Vishnu Bhagavan 
albeit by an indirect route.  In fact that is what Krishna Bhagavan says 
in Gita 9:23.
