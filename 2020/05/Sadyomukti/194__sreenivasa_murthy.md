  Namaste,
I will make an attempt for the methodology to get mukti.
Mukti from what? Bondage.
Why bondage? Truly speaking you are not bound but because of ignorance (avidya) you feel so.
How to remove ignorance? Knowledge is the direct cause. (Though there are other paths as well)
Knowledge of what? Knowledge of the self because the self has the bondage.
How do you get the knowledge of the self? Like all teachings under a guru and following sravana, manana and nidhidhyasana.
At whatever level you are (say 25%) you slowly gain knowledge of the self. Don"t stop till you reach 100%. There are no short cuts and shashtras say continue, if not in this life time maybe next or lives to come since it is the bondage which is the cause of birth and death.
What happens when you reach 100%? Your bondage is removed and you get mukti immediately there and then. Thus path of knowledge could be long but once reached it is instant and thereafter full freedom. You have now become a gyani.
One of the sanskrit word for it is Jeevan mukta. I hope the methodology for mukti in short is explained.
There is another school of thought which objects and consider Videha mukti as final when the body falls off.
Regards,

Sudhakar Kabra

 Namaste,

sadyomukti is another name for jivanmukti, being sadyas = immediately (on
jnAnotpatti).

Kind rgds,
