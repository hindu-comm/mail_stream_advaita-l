Dear friends,
I came across with the following from the book 
"Talks With Sri Ramana Maharshi" published bySri Ramanashramam , Tiruvannamalai.
Quote :Dialogue :096M.: The ultimate Truth isso simple. 
It is nothing more than being in the pristine state. 
This isall that need be said.Still, it is a wonder thatto teach this simple Truth 
there should come into being so manyreligions, 
creeds, methods and disputes among them and so on! 
Ohthe pity! Oh the pity!Unquote.
Atmajnana is so simple , direct and immediate
and it has to be had within oneself by oneself.That is what the Upanishads are pointing out.

With warm and respectful namaskars,Sreenivasa Murthy
