During these paid holidays with my kids I used to do saptashati pArAyana on Ashtami, Navami, Chaturdashi, bahula trayOdashi pradOsha pooja & every Monday rudrAbhisheka, Sundays aruNa parAyaNa, Chaturthi saMkashta hara vrata etc.  keeping different upAdhi-s of different devata-s like vinAyaka, bhagavati, shiva, vishNu etc. during all these different pooja and kalpa I used to wonder why we should not accept bheda in upAsya devata in Advaita !!??  And for that matter shAstra also does not deny the bheda in upAsya devata and different phala by doing the upAsana of different devata.  So, is it an unpardonable sin if we  accept the bheda among different sOpAdhika brahman/s in the transactional reality where upAsya, upAsaka, upAsana hold sway ??  I am not talking about the hierarchical gradations and superior / inferior complexes here  but difference in the SAME tattva based on upAdhi vishesha.  So IMHO, there is indeed hari-hara bhedha based on upAdhi, there is indeed difference in upAsana / archana / pooja vidhi of different devata-s...And in paramArtha as we all know, as per Advaita, there is no jeeva, no Ishwara and all is ONE and secondless (ekamevAdviteeyaM) ...And just curious, where exactly the Advaita denying the bhedha here??  Whether, in Advaita,  bheda is rebutted just due to unwarranted gradation among them or bheda itself wrongly negated completely ignoring the upAdhi and shakti vishesha in that upAdhi ??  If it is former then ONLY gradation to be negated and not bheda, if it is later then it is debatable.  Any thoughts on this??

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
