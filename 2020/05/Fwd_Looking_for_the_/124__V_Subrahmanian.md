The view of Advaitins, based on Shankara's bhashyas, is that the Sri
Rudram's statements are to teach us that both the 'ghora' (terrible) and
'aghora' (benign) are manifestations of Brahman.  Instead of saying Brahman
manifests 'in' the terrible, benign, etc. as per Advaita it is correct to
say that 'Brahman manifests 'as' the ghora and aghora in creation. That is
what Shankara asserts with the help of not one but many shruti passages: he
cites the shvetashvatara there (just after the now discovered Paippalada
samhita): you are woman, man, young girl, the old man tottering with a
stick....  Of course the Advaitin would see this as: the name/form of the
ghora and aghora are mithya and the unnegatable vastu there is Brahman.
This part is not admissible to non-advaitins, as can be seen from this
example:  Pl. read this short article that examines the statements made by
noted Dvaita scholar Bannanje Govindacharya exactly in the Srirudram
context:

I do not know. Maybe vyakarana people can clarify.
