Namaste Subbu ji and Venkat ji

Based on the rudra prashna, I have heard it said that say such references
in mantras , to even venal and violent individuals, fraudsters and conmen,
waylayers, thieves etc in creation as also being that same Brahman - is for
prAyascitta (atonement).

 The idea being that Shiva alone has manifested as all these unsavory
characters in our life/world, to give us the necessary karma phalas.

Accordingly, acknowledgement of the same, without dveSha, chanted along
with mantras like नमः सहमानाय (third anuvAka - I salute the tolerant Lord,
who accommodates the transgressions of devotees who seek forgiveness
भक्तापराधक्षममाणाय etc.)  etc., works towards prAyascittam.

( Of course, in the brahmasutra context,  I understand that the denial of
multiplicity (nAnAtvaM) in brahman is done by asserting that Brahma is
manifest even in the gamblers and lower beings. )

Is vAvana = vA + avana (desire/joy?)


Om
Raghav
