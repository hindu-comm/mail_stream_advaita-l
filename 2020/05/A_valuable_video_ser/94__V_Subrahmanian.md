The Tamil Smarta will be publishing a series of YouTube videos for ten days
to commemorate the Aradhana of Sri TK Balasubrahmanya Aiyar which is to
take place on the 6th of June this year. Three works of Adi Shankara
Bhagavatpada, three of Srimad Appayya Dikshitendra and three of Sri
Sacchidananda Sivabhinava Nrsimha Bharati Swamigal will be published on
each day. On the 10th day there will be two short videos- one in Tamil and
one in English, narrating the glorious event of Sri TKB Aiyar's Niryanam
(Disappearance).

DAY 1:

Siva Padadi Keshanta Stotram of Sri Adi Shankaracharya (Parayanam)

In this Stotra which comprises of 41 verses Srimadacharya teaches us, in
great detail, how to visualize the form of Lord Siva. Before beginning to
meditate on the Lord’s form He meditates upon Mount Kailasa where the Lord
resides. He then moves on to the meditation on His weapons— (1) the bow
known as Sri Pinaka, (2) the axe, and (3) the trident, in verses 2, 3 & 4.
In verses 5 through 12 He meditates upon seven Deities that surround Him—
(1) the Deer, (2) Lord Vrshabha, (3) Lord Vinayaka, (4) Lord Subrahmanya,
(5) Lord Sasta, (6) Parvati Devi, and (7) Lord Nandin.
In verse 13 He imagines his own heart as the Lord’s residence, and
meditates on the Lord’s assembly on verses 14 & 15.
In verses 16 to 35 He meditates upon the Lord’s form from the foot to the
regions above.
The Tamil Smarta takes you on a journey of visualization meditation and
also teaches you the proper pronunciation of the Siva-padadikeshanta-stotra
in Sanskrit. Sit straight, and either close your eyes to meditate upon the
Lord’s form as you hear the chanting of the shlokas, or keep your eyes open
to go through the Sanskrit text of each shloka as the vocal goes on. And
let The Guru, Sri Sankara Bhagavatpada, guide you in contemplating on the
Divya-mangala-rupam of Bhagavan as you hear and/or chant each of the
shloka. This 22-minute guided meditation of Stotra-pathana (chanting) is a
highly recommended practice for everyone. No initiation or other
qualification is required for this unlike the study of the
Brahmasutra-bhashya or the Upanishad-bhashya.

Sri Gokula Krishnan Iyer of Srirangam is doing this amazing service
to Shankara Advaita.
