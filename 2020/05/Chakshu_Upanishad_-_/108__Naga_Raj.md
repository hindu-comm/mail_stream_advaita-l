Namaste All,
I heard about benefits of chanting Chakshu Upanishad (Krishna Yajur Veda)  for eye related ailments. I cannot find a swara intonations for the same. Does anyone have a pdf text or a rendering by a vedic priest. I found some youtube links but they are more sung in a song/poetic mode.

Thanks
