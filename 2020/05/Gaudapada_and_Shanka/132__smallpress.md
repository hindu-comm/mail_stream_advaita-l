Namaskaram.
My first post to this illustrious list. Thank you for inviting me in.
I know that Gaudapada was at least partly addressing the Buddhists 
and other atheistic schools while writing his Karika on the Mandukya Upanishad and keeps it free of personal deities.
How does Shankara's approach in his Bhashyam differ from that of Gaudapada's approach or does it at all?
Thank you.
