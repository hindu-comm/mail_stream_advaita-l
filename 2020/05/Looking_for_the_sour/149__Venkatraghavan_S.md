Namaste Subbuji,

It is not surprising that you didn't find any references in your search -
the paippalAda rescension in (near?) complete, publicly available form is a
relatively recent development.

Only a corrupted and damaged version of paippalAda manuscripts in Kashmiri
Sharada was publicly available until 1957, when a living tradition was
discovered in Orissa. Any publications of the bhAShya predating then would
not have been able to find the reference.

Regards,
Venkatraghavan
