I heard a part of a talk by a vishishtAdvaita speaker, Sri Dushyanth
Sridhar today on the Advaita academy global oneness lectures where he
mentioned that we believe that Sri Adi Shankaracharya chanted this at the
time of his mother's last moments.

But it looks like this stotra is well-known as having a different author
viz., bhAShya SvaminaH.
