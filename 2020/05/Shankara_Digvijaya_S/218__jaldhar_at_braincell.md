184| yamināmṛṣabheṇa nīlakaṅṭhaṁ jitamākarṇya manīṣidhuryavaryam |
sahasodayanādayaḥ kavīndrāḥ paramadvaitamuṣaścakampire sma ||72||

184. Hearing that the most respected thinker Nīlakaṅṭha was defeated by the 
Bull of the Restrained [i.e. Śaṅkara], the laughter of kings of poets such as 
Udayana etc., the chief dualists, became tearful trembling.(72)

(By Nīlakaṅṭha, Mādhavācārya apparently means Śrīkaṅṭha Śivācārya who wrote a 
brahmasūtrabhāṣya according to Śivādvaita.  But this is an anachronism. 
Udayanācārya the famoua Naiyayika could possibly be a contemporary of 
Śaṅkarācārya though many historians place him a generation or so later.)

185| viṣayeṣu vitatya  naijabhāṣyāṇyatha saurāṣṭramukheṣu tatra tatra |
bahudhā vibudhaiḥ praśasyamāno bhagavāndvāravatīṁ purīṁ viveśa ||73||

185. He extended the spread of his commentaries to Saurāṣṭra and beyond. 
Praised by many wise men, Bhagavān reached the city of Dvāravatī [i.e. 
Dvārakā].(73).

(Saurāṣṭra is the peninsular portion of Gujarat state.)

186| nijaśiṣyapadaṁ gatānudīcyāniti kṛtvā'tha videhakauśalādyaiḥ |
vihitāpacitistathā'ṅgavaṅgeṣvayamāstīrya yaśo jagām gauḍān ||161||

186. After making many disciples in the North, he went to Videha and Kauśala 
getting respect there. He went to Aṅga and Vaṅga and extending his fame there, 
reached Gauḍa.(161)

(In modern geographic terms, Videha is Northern Bihar and part of Nepal. 
Kauśala is the area of Uttar Pradesh around Ayodhya.  Aṅga is southeastern 
Bihar. Vaṅga is Bengal specifically the Ganga delta region. Gauḍa is eastern 
Bengal, what is now mostly Bangladesh.)
