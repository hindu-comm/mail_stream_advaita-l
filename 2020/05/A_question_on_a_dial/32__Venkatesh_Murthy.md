Namaste

Sannyasa is the last Ashrama before death. But a Brahmachari can enter
Sannyasa if he has Vairagya and necessary qualities. In very ancient time
Rishis were also married even though they did Tapas. Many Rishis like
Vasistha, Atri and Gautama were married. What is wrong in Siva doing Tapas
and marrying?
