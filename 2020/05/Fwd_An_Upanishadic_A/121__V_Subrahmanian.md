An Upanishadic Advaitic Etymology for 'Nr-simha'

The NrsimhaTāpinyupaniṣat has given an etymology to the terms 'Nr-simha'.
Shankara has brought out the purport of this etymology, which occurs as
part of the famous Nrsimha Mantra Rāja:

ॐ उग्रं वीरं महाविष्णुं ज्वलन्तं सर्वतोमुखम्।
नृसिंहं भीषणं भद्रं मृत्युमृत्युं नमाम्यहम् ॥

An article that brings out all this and also several other aspects
important to Advaita, such as māyā-avidyā identity, is available here for
download:
