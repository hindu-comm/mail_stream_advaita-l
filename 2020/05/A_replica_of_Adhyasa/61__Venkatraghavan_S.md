Namaste Raghav ji,
I don't think your email to me was sent to the group either. Copying it in
full below for the benefit of everyone else.

To clarify, I am using the term nimitta kAraNa as used in nyAya shAstra,
not in vedAnta. That is, this is a supporting cause - with its presence,
one attains the result. Think of a situation where there is a pratibandha
or an obstacle. Say there is an inhibitor, which prevents fuel from
catching fire. When the inhibitor is present, fuel does not burn even when
in the presence of a lit match. When the inhibitor is absent, and a lit
match is brought in front of the fuel, it catches fire and starts burning.
Thus, the absence of the inhibitor is necessary for the result of fire to
take place.

Similarly here - if viveka is present, the result of adhyAsa cannot take
place. If viveka and other such nimitta-s are (nidrA, etc) absent, and the
upAdAna kAraNa (ajnAna) is also present, then adhyAsa will take place. The
absence of viveka here is the nimitta kAraNa or supporting factor for
adhyAsa.

I am not saying that aviveka is some bhAvarUpa padArtha - it is viveka
abhAva. The bhAvarUpa padArtha is ajnAna, which is the upAdAna kAraNa.

So to answer your question - what is the difference between aviveka and
adhyAsa? - former is one of many nimitta kAraNa-s, latter is kArya.
1) In our dRShTAnta, the pratibandha abhAva is the nimittam, the indhana
(fuel) is the upAdAna kAraNa, and vahni is the kArya.
3) In our dARShTAnta, aviveka is the nimittam, ajnAna is the upAdAna
kAraNa, adhyAsa is the kArya.

Regards,
Venkatraghavan

>>
>> That is why, AchArya concludes his adhyAsa bhAShya saying एवमयमनादिरनन्तो
>>  नैसर्गिकोऽध्यासो मिथ्याप्रत्ययरूपः कर्तृत्वभोक्तृत्वप्रवर्तकः सर्व

>> why is shankarAchArya talking of adhyAsa instead? The answer is being
>> provided by the bhAShyakAra - तमेतमेवंलक्षणमध्यासं पण्डिता अविद्येति
>> मन्यन्ते । तद्विवेकेन च वस्तुस्वरूपावधारणं विद्यामाहुः । - The adhyASa

>> jnAna. This is spoken of in the sentence beginning with tadvivekena.
>> As the ratnaprabhA says:
>>
>> ननु ब्रह्मज्ञाननाश्यत्वेन सूत्रितामविद्यां हित्वा अध्यासः किमिति वर्ण्यत
>> इत्यत आह -
>>
>> तमेतमिति ।
>>
>> आक्षिप्तं समाहितमुक्तलक्षणलक्षितमध्यासमविद्याकार्यत्वादविद्येति मन्यन्त
>> इत्यर्थः ।
>>
>> विद्यानिवर्त्यत्वाच्चास्याविद्यात्वमित्याह -
>>
>> तद्विवेकेनेति |
>>
>>
>> The ratnaprabhA continues:
>>
>> तथापि कारणाविद्यां त्यक्त्वा कार्याविद्या किमिति वर्ण्यते तत्राह -
>>
>> तत्रेति ।
>>
>> तस्मिन्नध्यासे उक्तन्यायेनाविद्यात्मके सतीत्यर्थः । मूलाविद्यायाः
>> सषुप्तावनर्थत्वादर्शनात्कार्यात्मना तस्या अनर्थत्वज्ञापनार्थं तद्वर्णनमिति
>> भावः ।
>> Even so, instead of talking of the root cause avidyA, why is the avidyA
>> which is its effect (ie adhyAsa) being talked about? That is answered with
>> "tatra". The adhyAsa is on the basis of what was just said (because it

>> (such as kartritva-bhoktritvAdi), whereas when the same avidyA is present
>> in the form of its effect (adhyAsa), the very same avidyA is the source of
>> anartha. Therefore adhyAsa is being talked about predominantly, not avidyA.
