A pot for example, comes into being in the vast space and occupies a place
even while containing (pot)space within it. In the same way the jiva comes
into being and occupies a place in avidyA even while containing avidyA
within itself.  Thus do the wise hold.

Namaste.

This verse is cited in NyAyAmruta in support of its contention that jIva
cannot be Ashraya for avidyA. However it does not mention its origin.
Curiously in its response Advaita Sidhi cites the same verse and gives a
different interpretation to it, and contends that the verse does not
conflict with the contention of Sri Vachaspati Mishra in Bhamati that jIva
is the Ashraya for avidyA. Refer अद्वैतसिद्धिः

, अथाज्ञानवादेऽविद्याया वाचस्पतिसम्मतजीवाश्रयत्वोपपत्तिः (advaitasiddhiH

, athAj~nAnavAde.avidyAyA vAchaspatisammatajIvAshrayatvopapattiH ),
Ananthakrishna Shastri Edition.

However I must confess I am unable to make out which view the
interpretation given above supports !! No offence meant. It is just that I
do not understand it properly.
Regards
