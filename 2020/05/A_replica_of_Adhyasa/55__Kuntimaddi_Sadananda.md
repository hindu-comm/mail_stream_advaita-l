Sada jiNamasteCan you please clarify if by the cyclic process, you are referring to the fact that pUrva pUrva adhyAsa is responsible for uttarottara adhyAsa leading to the cycle of birth and death?
Yes - Any ignorance is anaadi, but ends with appropriate knowledge. Since creation, sustenance, and dissolution is a cyclic process there is no beginning - End comes only when one transcends the cycle or cause-effect relationships.------------------
Also can you kindly elaborate just a little on the anyonyAshraya idea in that last para you wrote.
Shree Ramanuja makes a big issue on this aspect in his mahapurvapaksha in his Shree bhaashya. Jiivs is born due to ignorance and ignorance is located in jeeva - Hence he says there is anyonya aashrya dosha - But he has the same problem - he accounts creation due to previous karmas - previous karmas are located on jeeva - seed and a tree situation. The cause-effect relationships are due to the beginningless cycle. The best resort is anirvachaneeyam which is actually khyaati vaada of Advaita.
Hari Om!
Sadananda--------------------------

The reason is that I understand the anyonyAshraya doSha to hold only for the view that avidyA is an antaHkaraNa doSha. On the other hand, the view that avidyA is a priori to even the mind, does not suffer from the anyonyAshraya doSha. Any corrections welcome....
Thank you for the honest elaboration of your thinking about why you are not at ease with avidyA as not-abhAva-rUpA.
OmRaghav


tat aikshataa, etc statements before creation do not refer to avidya but contemplative meditation for creation by Iswara.
In essence, my problem is in accepting the bhaavaruupa avidya than abhaaaruupa avidya. Experientially this does not seem to be valid as it is in the rope/snake case.
I am aware of the tradition of accepting the bhaavaruupa avidya.
Just voicing my concern. Some of the above aspects may have been pointed out by SSS, but I have not studied his works, perhaps Bhaskarji may be able to clarify.
Hari Om!Sadananda

Pranam Sadaji,
I didn't quite understand what you meant by the phrase partial jnAna abhAva
- do you mean partial abhAva of jnAna, or abhAva of partial jnAna? Also
what jnAna are we referring to?

The difference into vyaShti and samaShTi itself being on account of the
differences in the upAdhi, and the upAdhi itself being a result of avidyA,
the adhyAsa of the nature of satyAnRte mithunikaraNam should occur even
before the differences into vyaShTi and samaShTi emerge.

However, you are right that the "ahamidam mamedam iti naisargikoyam
lokavyavahara" refers to the vyaShTi level.

Regards,
Venkatraghavan
