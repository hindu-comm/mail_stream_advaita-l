Some months ago I had cited a verse, as told by Sri Mani Dravid
Sastrinah which means:  Just as a pot, even as it is produced in space (by
default), also is filled with space inside it (pot-space), so too the
antahkaraNam, even as it is produced by Avidya, affords locus for avidya in
it.  This way, there is no difficulty in holding 'antahkaranam is a product
of avidya and also the locus for it (avidya).'  If someone can retrieve the
verse, fine.
