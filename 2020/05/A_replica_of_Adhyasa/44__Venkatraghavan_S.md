Namaste Raghav ji,
To clarify, the phrase इतरेतराविवेकेन does not refer to avidyA, but simply
the lack of discrimination between self and non-self. The phrase,
मिथ्याज्ञाननिमित्तम् is the one that refers to bhAvarUpa avidyA being the
upAdAna kAraNa for the adhyastam.

As the panchapAdikAkAra says:

मिथ्याज्ञाननिमित्तः इति ।

मिथ्या च तदज्ञानं च मिथ्याज्ञानम् । मिथ्येति अनिर्वचनीयता उच्यते ।
अज्ञानमिति च जडात्मिका अविद्याशक्तिः ज्ञानपर्युदासेन उच्यते । तन्निमित्तः
तदुपादानः इत्यर्थः ॥

Regards,
Venkatraghavan
