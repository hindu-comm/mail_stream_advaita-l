In this system, ajnana (Ignorance) (Capital “I”) is considered an entity,a
veil/cover,which partially veils/covers another “entity” namely
Chaitanya(Consciouness). Thereby leading to its (Chaitanya) partial
ignorance (small “I”) or partial knowledge. The word “mithya” refers to its
(ajnana) ontological status vis-à-vis Chaitanya(Consciousness). So what is
the tautology about?

Well not exactly. In general parlance when it is said to be “false”,
‘ignorance” is understood with “i” in the small letter significance,
vyAvahArika sense. In other words,falseness is known through empirical
knowledge. In the case of ajnana or Ignorance, “I” has the significance of
Capital letter. It is an entity.That it is false is known (aparoksha) only
with Realization.Till then,any knowledge gained about it or its effects as
being false is only paroksha jnAna.
