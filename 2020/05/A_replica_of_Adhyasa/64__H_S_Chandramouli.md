Raghav Ji,

Namaste.

I will paraphrase what I wrote earlier in order to simplify matters.

Two definitions for adhyAsa have been given in the Bhashya.

<<  अध्यासो नाम अतस्मिंस्तद्बुद्धिरित्यवोचाम । >>  << adhyAso nAma
atasmiMstadbuddhirityavochAma | >>

and

<< स्मृतिरूपः परत्र
पूर्वदृष्टावभासः >>  << smRRitirUpaH paratra pUrvadRRiShTAvabhAsaH >>

There is the fundamental superimposition of avidyA on The Self which is the
primary cause of all Creation. This adhyAsa is covered under the first
definition given above.

Then we have the superimposition of the products of avidyA, like the
ego,BMI,objects etc, on The Self as opposed to that of avidyA itself. Both
the definitions given above are applicable to this. All types of
combinations of vishaya,vishayi,their dharmas etc are covered under this.

I presume this clears all the doubts.

You may also like to refer to Sidhanta Bindu of Sri MS translated with
notes and commentary by Sri PC Divanji for clarity. Many of the points I
have made in this thread are based on this.
Regards
