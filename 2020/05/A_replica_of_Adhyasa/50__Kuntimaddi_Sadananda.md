Venkatraghavanji - PraNAms
I am aware that the avidya is considered as bhavaruupa.
I had posted in the past (around 2000) a series on Adhyasa Bhashya based on my notes taken during Swami Paramarthanandaji Brahmasutra classes. It used to be available on Adviatin's website.
Experientially, however, I still have a problem in accepting the bhaavaruupa aspect of avidya.
Taking the rope/snake case, partial knowledge, I mean, is the satya amsha - that there is an object out there which is, say, 5ft, and coiled and lying on the alley.
There is a partial ignorance since I do not have complete attributive knowledge of the object out there.
Now, the question is, does the ignorance projects or my mind with chidaabaasa (upahita chaitanyam) projects the snake based on memory and saadRisyam of a snake and the rope?
Ignorance is only covering the knowledge while the vikshepa is by the upahita chaitnya, even though the cause for projection by the mind is the partial ignorance of the object out there. In essence, the viskhepa shakti comes from the upahita chaitanya or the activated mind due to chidaabhaasa.
For the case of the Self, I know I am sat and chit but not ananda which is limitless.
This is at vyashti level.
At samashti level, avidya, we call it as maaya shakti. There the total mind or Iswara with mayyashakti projects - Iswara we can call Him as upahita Chaitanya at the global level.
The same thing can be visualized for the dream projection where the global mind is the waker's mind and jiiva's mind in the dream is the mind of the dreamer-subject where he also has ekonavishati mukhaH as Mandukya Up. says.
One can argue that the mind itself is projection due to avidya - Here we are embedded in the cyclic process with anynonya aashrya, leaving it as anirvachneeyam.
tat aikshataa, etc statements before creation do not refer to avidya but contemplative meditation for creation by Iswara.
In essence, my problem is in accepting the bhaavaruupa avidya than abhaaaruupa avidya. Experientially this does not seem to be valid as it is in the rope/snake case.
I am aware of the tradition of accepting the bhaavaruupa avidya.
Just voicing my concern. Some of the above aspects may have been pointed out by SSS, but I have not studied his works, perhaps Bhaskarji may be able to clarify.

 Pranam Sadaji,
I didn't quite understand what you meant by the phrase partial jnAna abhAva
- do you mean partial abhAva of jnAna, or abhAva of partial jnAna? Also
what jnAna are we referring to?

The difference into vyaShti and samaShTi itself being on account of the
differences in the upAdhi, and the upAdhi itself being a result of avidyA,
the adhyAsa of the nature of satyAnRte mithunikaraNam should occur even
before the differences into vyaShTi and samaShTi emerge.

However, you are right that the "ahamidam mamedam iti naisargikoyam
lokavyavahara" refers to the vyaShTi level.

Regards,
Venkatraghavan
