This chapter of the Narada Puranam summarizes the content of the Padma
Puranam and says the Shiva Gita is part of it:

 देवरातसुताख्यानं पुराणज्ञप्रशंसनम् ।।
गौतमाख्यानकं चैव शिवगीता ततः स्मृता ।। २५ ।।
https://sa.wikisource.org/s/507

It also has a verse that says the Padmapuranam has the Bhagavata mahatmyam.
I had earlier shared a screen shot of the Bhagavatam multi-commentary book
where all the verses from there are given. One of the verses says: He is a
parama vaishnava who does not see difference across Hari, Hara and Durga
and holds all of them as Para Brahman.
