Namaste,

The best of his works are to be found in:
The Collected Works of Ramana Maharshi <https://amzn.to/3dNQtXk>
Talks with Sri Ramana Maharshi <https://amzn.to/2WwYj1K>
Guru Vachaka Kovai <https://amzn.to/3dLbNMV>

I wouldn't trust most books on him, as they generally misrepresent and
distort his teachings, but if you want a free guide that expounds his idea
of self-inquiry, I have published one here:

 .
