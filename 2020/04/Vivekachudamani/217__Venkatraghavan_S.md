Namaste

As a humble offering to Jagadguru Adi Shankara Bhagavatpada on the
auspicious occasion of Shankara Jayanti, a series of talks on the
Vivekachudamani, an important prakaraNa grantha by the AchArya, is hereby
commenced.

This work was commented on by the 34th AchArya of the Sringeri Sharada
Peetham, Jagadguru Srimad Chandrashekhara Bharati Mahaswamigal - a
jIvanmukta in recent, living memory. The talks will follow the commentary
by the Sringeri AchArya.

The text of the commentary is available on archive.org for those who wish
to follow the text:

Today being Adi Shankara Jayanti, the first talk is a humble attempt at
speaking of the glories of Adi Shankara - an avatAra puruSha.
