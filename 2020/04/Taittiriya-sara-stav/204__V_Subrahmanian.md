Taittiriya-sara-stava of Sri Jnanananda Bharati Swamigal

This is a short work written by Sri Jnanananda Bharati Swamigal, one of the
most exalted disciples of the Sringeri Shankaracharyas, in praise of Sri
Adi Shankara Bhagavatpada. In the fourth pada (quarter) of each shloka the
Swamigal addresses the mind and instructs it to worship the Lotus Feet of
Srimad Acharya to realize the Supreme Truth as expounded in the
Taittiriyopanishad. The fourth pada (quarter) of each of the shlokas in
this work resembles the last pada of each of the shlokas of Srimadacharya's
Lakshminrsimha Pancharatnam. As the name suggests, the first three padas
(quarters) of each shloka contains the essence of the Taittiriyopanishad.

REFERENCE: The Journal of Sri Sankaragurukulam published by Sri Vani Vilas
Press of Srirangam (Exact year of publication not known).

PS: I thank Dr. Sri Gokulakrishna Iyer of Srirangam for his efforts in
bringing to light this work and rendering it so well in the audio mode and
the textual presentation.
