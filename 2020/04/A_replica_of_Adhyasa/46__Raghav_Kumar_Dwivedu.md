Namaste Praveen ji
A doubt here -
1. You wrote - I think the Panchami just means hetu here.

2. I’d be a little careful using it as a causative for adhyAsa as it might
accrue the same flaw ajnAna being abhAvarUpa! 😊
(I am intrigued...!)
3. And then concluded with nibandhanam = kAraNam

Are not the ideas of "hetu", "causative factor" and "kAraNam"
interchangeable , or am I missing something here?

I think if you could elaborate point 2, it should clarify the entire
matter.

Also to check if the following ways of putting it are correct, please let
me know.
1. adhyAsa is caused by avidyA
2. avidyA is the hetu for the occurrence of adhyAsa.
3. avidyA is the kAraNam for adhyAsa.

Om

Raghav
