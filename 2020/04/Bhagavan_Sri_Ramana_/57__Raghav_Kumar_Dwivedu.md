EPIDEMICS DURING BHAGAVAN’S TIME – THE 1905 PLAGUE

The End of the 1905 Plague Epidemic

All in all, it was a peaceful time for Bhagavan Sri Ramana Maharshi and the
few sadhus who were with him at the Pachiamman temple during the six month
long quarantine there. Words such as quarantine were perhaps unknown then.
Such things made no difference to Bhagavan who had renounced the world and
had been living on a self-quarantine for almost a decade when the bubonic
plague of 1905 struck Tiruvannamalai.

Bhagavan used to swim in the Pachaiamman temple tank and roam about on the
hill side. As he would say later, “இந்த மலை மேல என் கால் படாத இடமே கிடையாது
There is no place on this hill which I have not set foot on.” He would also
go round the hill and perhaps his friends, the tigers and leopards would
also roam with him. As he would often say in the 1940s, reminiscing,
“அதெல்லாம் அந்த நாள்! Those were the days!”

When the epidemic was over after a long six months, public health workers
and police officials came to sanitize the town. They sprayed disinfectants
and got rid of the remaining rodents which were in the first place
responsible for the plague. When they completed their work they arranged a
bhajan and kirtan celebration. They established tents near Pachaiamman
Temple and since some of the prominent members among them had been coming
to visit Bhagavan during his stay, they requested Bhagavan to attend the
bhajans. When Bhagavan expressed his disinclination to join them, they
continued to press him. Suri Nagamma records Bhagavan’s enthusiastic
narration of the event in her 'Letters from Ramanasramam':

“There was a tank opposite Pachaiamman temple. They erected several tents
adjacent to the tank and arranged for the bhajan there. The bhajan,
however, was not of the ordinary type. In the big tent they left the
required open space in the centre and arranged chairs and benches around it
as in a circus tent. They brought edibles as for a tea-party and arranged
them all systematically as in an exhibition. There was no limit to the
flower garlands they brought. Collectors, Tahsildars and police were all
there. They arranged a special platform for me. As soon as I arrived, they
all got up, bowed before me, and requested me to sit on the dais. I felt
embarrassed. But, what to do? I never knew they would make such a fuss
about it. Having gone there, I had no alternative but to sit on the
platform. They tried to garland me, but I declined saying that they should
garland their own dignitaries. They did accordingly.

Till that was done, they did not begin the bhajan. After I had sat down,
they asked for permission to start the bhajan. After one party had
finished, another started, while the others took refreshments, soda and
other drinks. Till early morning there was thus continued eating and
continuous bhajan, by turns. I was the only one who did not touch or do
anything. I merely sat there. I felt satisfied and contented that they did
not press me to do anything. By daybreak all was over and there was not a
single soul, all had left along with the tents. Oh, they were all very
enthusiastic and exhilarated!”

The Supreme Jnani, who is just the சாட்சி மாத்திரம் साक्षी मात्र witness of
the world, witnessed the wild celebrations without himself participating in
any of it and without any reaction  With this all night celebration, the
epidemic of 1905 came to an auspicious end. Bhagavan and his devotees then
returned to Virupaksha cave.
