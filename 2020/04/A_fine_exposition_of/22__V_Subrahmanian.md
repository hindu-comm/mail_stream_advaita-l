Here is the playlist that I could get:
https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoAWWQG2advYXhRz41NCOntNCqTQyZDqY
It has 19 videos.

The above is a detailed exposition of Manikkavachagar's 'Shivapuranam'.
The exponent, Dr.Sudha Seshayyan, an accomplished Tamil scholar and a
Medical academician, is giving out the explanation in a very impressive
way. I have been hearing this series, though not in the serial order, and
find it very Advaita-friendly. She gives instances from the life and
teachings of Shankaracharya, Ramakrishna Paramahamsa, Ramana Maharshi, etc.
in a very telling way. She also includes Azhwars' compositions in
appropriate places.

I would recommend those who know Tamil to hear this series to great benefit.
