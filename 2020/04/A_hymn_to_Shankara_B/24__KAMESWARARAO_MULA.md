 Dear Subbu jI,
 Thank you for the wonderful link as I successfully downloaded 'Mudakarena pustakam'. I would like to mention out of my curiosity after listening to the melodic chanting, I could recognize him as smartha purohita Pandit shiva kumara sharma of the srigneri peetham. During my short stay there, I had the opportunity to interact him & his colleagues there for some time as they conducted the sahasra modaka homa with their enchanting vedic mantra's wit the seer's blessings. Although I started it with the srinadhadi guru tryam, this group continued wit their guru parampara stotram and still I can recollect their many vedic chantings.

One again many thanks for the link subrahamanyam garu.

Sri Guru Padaravindarpana Mastu
Kameswara

One can read the hymn in many language scripts.

One can access the audio rendered by Dr.Shivakumar Tangirala in perfect
diction.

The hymn can be learnt and taught to others, children, etc. and sung in
group.

regards
subbu
