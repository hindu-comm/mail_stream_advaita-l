Namaskaram sir,

Thanks for sharing. The website of Kamakoti Mandali, from which the article
in the link has been sourced, also has many articles on the Guru Parampara,
Advaita Vedanta, Dharma, Bhakti, Society etc.and a webpage devoted to
teachings and life accounts/experiences with Jagadgurus of the Sringeri
Sharada Peetam. I had the blessed opportunity to revisit the website upon
seeing your kind post. Thanks very much, sir.

Regards,
Divya
