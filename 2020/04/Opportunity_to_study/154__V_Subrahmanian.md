मुण्डकोपनिषद्भाष्य will be taught यथाशक्ति online via FreeConferenceCall or
Zoom in Kannada-Havigannada and maybe some English mix by Praveen R. Bhat,
from 1130-1230hrs IST daily, except Thursday and maybe some other days,
starting this week or the next. The course is free; donations are welcome,
but only from gRhasthas or those earning.

>From prior experiences, following is the strict eligibilty criteria:
--First and foremost, ability to attend the live pATha daily at given
timings with saucha, not via recordings and without multitasking!
--Average Sanskrit knowhow and, obviously, Kannada with some dialect mix
with an interest in mokSha-shAstra that is not academic.
--nityasandhyA at least once; in the case of a woman, if married, the
husband or if unmarried, the father should be doing nityasandhyA. In other
words, "I am spiritual, not religious" requests will be ignored. :-)
--shraddhA in the shruti and advaita-sampradAya.
--Studied at least basic Vedanta such as tattvabodha/ vedAntasAra from the
sampradAya. Self-learning through books doesn't count.

Those interested may kindly send their request to join the pATha with their
full name and responding to all the above terms by mentioning how are they
are placed w.r.t. each of the five terms by WhatsApp to 8554899210.

PS: Adding your gotra, vedashAkhA and pravara would be beneficial.

धन्योस्मि। गुरुपादुकाभ्याम्।
