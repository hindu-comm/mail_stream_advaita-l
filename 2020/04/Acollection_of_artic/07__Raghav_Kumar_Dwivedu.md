You mean dRShTireva sRShtih or the other viz., yat dRShTam tat sRShtaM (I
may not be using the exact words)? As far as I am able to make out, VP
would imply that dRShTireva sRShTiH to be inapplicable for pramA and VP
would include the idea of "an object originates even as it is perceived" to
be not fit to be termed pramA. VP would include it under either bhrama (if
unsublated) or bAdhita anuvRtti (if sublated).

I too was struck by the dismissal of abAdhtatvam as a necessary prayojakam
for a pramA, in the article of the author. That is why I highlighted the
point.

I am attaching the relevant pages in jpg format in a separate mail.

The word aGYAtasattAka and jnAtaikasattAka used by the author are evidently
from the standard model of AvaraNa nivRtti. I do not know the source. I can
only request other members to help.

There is a passage of Karapatri Swamiji who also references it.

जो वस्तु अज्ञातसत्ताक होती है उसी का आवरण हटाने के लिये वृत्ति होती है।
A vRtti occurs to remove the AvaraNa of only that object which is
aGYAtasattAka.

 सिद्धान्त यह है कि घटादि का प्रकाश घटाद्य-वच्छिन्न चैतन्य से ही होता है,
किन्तु जब तक वह आवृत रहता है तब तक उसका प्रकाश नहीं होता, क्योंकि ज्ञान
अनावृत चैतन्य से ही होता है। अतः वृत्ति का काम यही है कि आवरण की निवृत्ति
कर अनावृत्त चैतन्य से सम्बन्धित घटादि का ज्ञान कराये...
