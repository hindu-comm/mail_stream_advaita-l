Namaste Raghavji,

This is interesting indeed, but I have a concern as follows...

So shouldn't ajnAtasattAka be added to the VP definition itself then or am
I missing something? Where is such an assumption coming from?

IMO, quoting Bhagavan Madhusudhana Saraswati may not be right unless the
exact context is known. To that effect, I plead ignorance; could you point
me to the source I could look up to understand better? OTOH, I could say
that each object is coeval with the perception and that would exclude each
object-cognition from pramA. We wouldn't need this business of pramA at all
then! :-)

Kind rgds,
