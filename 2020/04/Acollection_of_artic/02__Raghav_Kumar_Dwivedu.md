There was an interesting article by Smt. S.Revathy (professor, Madras
Sanskrit College) on Vedanta paribhAShA. She says that the very condition
of an object being anadhigata is a sufficient criterion for a valid
cognition. In other words, the condition of abAdhitatvam as a criterion for
valid knowledge is superfluous.

Wherever the origination of the object is coeval with perception, it is
termed jnAtaikasattAka and that puts all such cognitions such as cognition
of shell in silver (here the object is jnAtaikasattAka), such cognitions
are not valid knowledge at all, according to VP.

She quotes Shri Madhusudana Saraswati from to substantiate this from his
work Advaita Ratna rakshaNa.

Incidentally the fact that the requirement that the object is to be
ajnaatasattaaka (unknown prior to its cognition) - an implicit necessity
for the condition of anadhigatatvam (unknown prior to its cognition -
implying that the object exists but is unknown) to be satisfied, places the
vedAnta paribhAShA epistemology clearly within the ambit of sRShTi dRShTi
prakriyas.
