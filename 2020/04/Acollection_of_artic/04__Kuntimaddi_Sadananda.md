Subbuji - PraNAms.
I personally do not agree with her assessment.pramaa means a valid knowledge -validity implies abhaaditatvam - If it is negated later by a better pramaana then the previous pramaa becomes bhramaa, just as in the rope/snake case. Snake perception was real since the secondary effects such as blood pressure went up and the associated fear and its effects which are measurable. When when I see a snake where the rope is, at that time, it is anadigatam from the point of the snake that I am seeing where the rope is. I am seeing it for the first time.
Even shell silver was valid knowledge until the guy picks us the so-called silvery object and examines to discover it is a shell.
Now apply this to the world. The world is also real until we use a better pramaana (Vedanta) to recognize what we have cognized is bhramaa. adyaaropa apavaada is relays on the abhaadita aspect only.
anadigata is from the point of the perceiver, subject - not from another person's knowledge. I am the only subject in the universe, from my reference. Hence anadigata reference is also from my point only. Adyaasa ultimately is from the subject level.
My 2c.

That is an interesting observation Raghav ji. In the Drishti srishti
prakriya the very pramana-prameya-pramiti operation is mithya. All
knowledge/perception activity is akin to dream perception.
