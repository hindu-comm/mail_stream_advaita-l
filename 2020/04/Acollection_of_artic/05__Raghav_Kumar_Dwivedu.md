Namaste Sada ji
What you wrote also seems to imply that abAdhitatvam is superfluous.

You said - Because the cognition of silver in nacre is valid for some time.
Only much later when the nacre is recognised, the earlier silver cognition
is sublated. In the interregnum, the silver cognition is to be treated as
pramA. It becomes bhrama only subsequently.

My question to you is that - even in the above case, i.e., going along with
your reasoning, the criterion of abAdhitatvam (to assess whether a given
cognition *as it arises* is valid pramA or not) become superfluous.

The article under question had advanced a different reason for regarding
abAdhitatvam as superfluous. It said that the object (silver) was not
aGYAtasattAka since the origination of silver is coeval with its cognition
and so silver cognition is not valid pramA.

But, for the moment,  leaving aside the exact reason, it looks like you
actually agree with the author (about abAdhitatvam bring superfluous)
although you advanced a different reason.

So, to summarize,  are you saying that abAdhitatvam is indeed superfluous,
since a cognition is regarded as pramA, atleast provisionally. (subject of
course to future sublation, which is not really important here since even a
valid cognition has that characteristic of future sublatability).?
