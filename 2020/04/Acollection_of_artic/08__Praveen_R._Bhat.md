I'm happy to see such juggernaut names, so please do drop names, but my
question was the context. And the entire work is most likely not the
context. :-)

I also meant whatever the author meant by coeval :-)

I think VP wouldn't consider it pramA but it surely falls under anadhigata.
And without abAdhitattva, it just won't work in that way.

Thanks, but I read the entire article before my earlier response requesting
exact Advaitaratnarakshana statement in context.

That is where I fault the author for faulting VP! You can't have a standard
model before VP analysis and further dismissal, as that VP *is* the
standard model. Why would one try to understand the definition of pramA
from VP while taking ajnAtasattAka definition from elsewhere and not used
in VP before! (Thinking ahead, there would be an issue with anupalabdhi too
w.r.t. ajnAtasattAka).

Each basic work starts defining technical words and cannot assume such
undefined words. With that perspective, I would expect the anadhigatatva
definition to include it if it's author meant so. Else one can use DSV, as
said earlier and dismiss entire SDV too!
