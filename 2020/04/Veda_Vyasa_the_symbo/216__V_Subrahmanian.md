In continuation of the post below, here is yet another verse, from an
edition of the Mahabharata, that states Veda Vyasa was a manifestation of
the Trimurti-s:

https://bombay.indology.info/mahabharata/apps/UD/Supp01.txt

01*0005_01 यः श्वेतत्वमुपागतः कृतयुगे त्रेतायुगे रक्ततां
01*0005_02 युग्मे यः कपिलः कलौ च भगवान्कृष्णत्वमायाग *
01*0005_03 * * * * * * * दन्ति मुनयो यो योगिभिर्गीयते
01*0005_04 स ब्रह्मा यदि वा हरो यदि शिवो यः कोऽपि तस्मै नमः


The last line translates to: Obeisance to Veda Vyasa, whoever he may
be, whether Brahmaa, or Hari  or Shiva.  There are some variations in
the reading. In one version the shloka ends:  Let that deity (any of
the Trimurtis) protect the world from degeneration.


The above depiction is from some old manuscripts, which have errors
also, as is evident from the last line. (Hara and Shiva are the same.
It could be Hari and Shiva.)
