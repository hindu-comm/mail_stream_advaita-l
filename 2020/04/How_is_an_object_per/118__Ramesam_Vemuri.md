Respected Sirs,

Namaskarams

I do not mean to argue, but would like to submit a couple of points
 for consideration because any general theory cannot have a very narrow
applicability.

i)  One does not have to always invoke a Creator Lord, if one  follows the
principle
of दृष्टिरेव सृष्टि: often quoted by Shri Subrahmanian Garu referencing his
Teacher  Dr. D.S. Subbaramaiya; and,

ii)  It is beyond logic that the same mind which is behind all the five
senses gets limited in its capacity to travel "out" toward the object
depending on the sensory organ - from an infinite distance when it moves by
itself to zero distance depending upon the sense.

regards,
