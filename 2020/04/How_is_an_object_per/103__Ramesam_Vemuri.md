Respected Sirs,

Namaskarams

When one postulates that the mind extends out to reach the object and
covers the object,
it seems to imply that the object pre-exists out there so that the mind
could go to it.
But then does not Advaita also tell us that the world (and hence the
objects in it) are a "projection" of the mind? This would imply that an
object cannot be out there unless the mind
itself has projected it in the first instance.

regards,
