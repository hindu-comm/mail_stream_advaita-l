Namaste Ramesam garu
Your question is interesting.


In dRShtireva sRShTi, I don't see how it makes sense to talk of the mind
going out and uniting with a (presumably pre-existing) object. Maybe I am
missing something here but as far as I can follow, the VP model of
perception assumes that the object is already there *a priori*.

So VP is assuming sRShTi independent of dRShTi.

Om

Raghav
