I don't quite understand the description of the process of perception provided by Bina Gupta.
However, I can say this from my personal understanding:

1) It is impossible to give a consistent and full explanation of the process of perception (e.g. Seeing)
assuming the existence of an external material or physical object (e.g. pot) without appeal to a
non-material of non-physical entity (i.e. Self or Consciousness). Vide Sankara's BSB 3.3.54-55.
In fact, this is the evidence of the existence of the Self as separate from the body, using the
phenomenon of perception.

2) Sankara says in his BSB 3.3.54 that the Self is of the very nature of Perception itself ("upalabdhisvaruupa") :
 upalabdhisvaruupa eva cha na aatmetyaatmano dehavyatiriktatvam .

The above indicates that the Self is literally identical with SEEING, HEARING, etc. In other words:
 Self = Seeing = Hearing = ...

If that is taken to be the advaitic standpoint, then the question of seeing an object (i.e. the "seen") may not be
meaningful, since ultimately the seen object is not really real, but SEEING is really real and remains a constant.
