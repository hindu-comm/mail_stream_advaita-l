Chandramouliji -PraNAms.Thanks for the clarification. I will go over it to understand the difference. I should have Shreeman Sastriji write up somewhere.---------
Ramesam gaaru -PraNAms
What you mentioned is more Vijnaana vaada and not Advaita.
The individual mind does not project the object and then perceive it. There is Iswara Srushti vs Jeeva Srishti. The individual mind can superimpose its raaga dweshas on top of Iswara Srushti. Vidyaranaya swami discusses this in the 4th Ch. of Pancadasi.

 Respected Sirs,

Namaskarams

When one postulates that the mind extends out to reach the object and
covers the object,
it seems to imply that the object pre-exists out there so that the mind
could go to it.
But then does not Advaita also tell us that the world (and hence the
objects in it) are a "projection" of the mind? This would imply that an
object cannot be out there unless the mind
itself has projected it in the first instance.

regards,
