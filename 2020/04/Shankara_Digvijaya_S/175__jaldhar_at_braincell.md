Shri Achyuthan wrote to say that according to the Shringeri tradition, it 
was the younger brother Bhoganātha who took sannyasa at an earlier age as 
Bhāratī Tīrtha and became the guru of his older brother.  (Mādhava took 
sannyasa at age 75.)

Despite the fame and authority of his writings Mādhava/Vidyāraṇya did not 
have any desire to hog the limelight for himself. In several of his works, 
such as the celebrated Sarvadarṣanasaṁgraha, he signs his name as 
Sāyaṇamādhava.  Whether this is simply out of respect or they collaborated 
is not known with certainty but it shows a lack of ego in any case. 
The last five chapters of his Pañcadaśī were composed by Swami Bhāratī Tīrtha.
Some of the Dīpīkās on upaniṣads ascribed to him are actually by or in 
collaboration with Swami Śaṅkarānanda another pupil of Swami Vidya Tirtha.

Some commentators on MDS interpret ghaṭānāṁ paṭala not as heap or stack of 
pots but "forehead of an elephant" -- a proverbially large object. 
Whatever the case may be, the meaning is the same; this short composition 
can still give the gist of its much larger source.
