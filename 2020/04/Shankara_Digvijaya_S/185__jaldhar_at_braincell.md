Ānandagiri in his pūrvāśrama was called Janārdana. Under that name, he 
wrote a work called Tarka Saṁgraha which despite what you might 
think based on the title is about Vedānta not logic.  He is believed 
to have been a Gujarati.

And incidentally Citsukha is the earliest known commentator on 
the Bhāgavata Purāṇa though unfortunately it no long survives.
