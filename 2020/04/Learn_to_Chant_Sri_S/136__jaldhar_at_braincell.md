Vyoma Samskrta Pathasala which has many excellent online courses for 
students at all levels of ability.  They have a new course coming up which
may be of interest to list members especially as Shankara Jayanti is 
coming up soon.

The Shankara Digvijaya Mahakavya is a traditional hagiographical biography
of Shankaracharya by Madhavacharya (purvashrama name of Swami Vidyaranya) 
It has 1843 shlokas.

Early in the 20th century, Pandit Mahabaleshwara condensed this down to 
214 shlokas under the name Shankara Digviyaya Saara.

The course will be conducted as a webinar every Wednesday starting from 
April 15 and continuing for approximately four months.

See https://www.sanskritfromhome.in/course/shankara-digvijaya-saara for 
details.
