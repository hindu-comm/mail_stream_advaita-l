My Buddhist friend Dhammaputta wrote to me regarding this:
Prof. Deshpande is right.
There is no reference to  "Om"  in  Pali  Buddhism.

Mahayana  Sutras  &  Vajrayana  Tantras,  yes  indeed
Theravada  says  Mahayana  is  Hinduism  in  the  guise  of  Buddhism
The irony is  that  non-Advaita  Hindus  say  Advaita  is  Mahayana
Buddhism  in  the  guise  of  Hinduism
