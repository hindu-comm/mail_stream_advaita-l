Some time back on this list we discussed the Buddhist scholar Bhavya, who 
is one of the earliest writers of any school to mention Vedanta.  While
the bulk of his works refute "heretic" (from his point of view) darshanas,
one part defends his brand of Mahayana from other Buddhists.  One of their
criticisms he says is that Mahayana is "prachanna Vedanta"!
