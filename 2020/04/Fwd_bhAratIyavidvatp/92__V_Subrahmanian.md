Subject: {भारतीयविद्वत्परिषत्} Adi Sankaracharya Puja Vidhi in 5 scripts
To: <bvparishat at googlegroups.com>


Namaste,

On the occasion of Sankara Jayanti I wish to share Adi Sankaracharya Puja
Vidhi in five scripts. The original compilation was done by Sri. Harsha
Rammurthy with Mantras. Here is a shorter version with only slokas which
could help many people who do not have the upadesam of mantras. Hope
this helps.

Jaya Jaya Sankara Hara Hara Sankara
