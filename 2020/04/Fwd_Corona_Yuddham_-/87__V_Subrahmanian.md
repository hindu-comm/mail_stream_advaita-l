https://youtu.be/bzhjM9Gn0UU      The video has English subtitles.

"Corona Yuddham", a song written by Ramnath Bhagavath on the war between
humanity and Corona virus. The song gives listeners, a quick glimpse of the
following:
1) The virus,
2) Global lock down
3) Economic crisis
4) Social distancing and prevention
5) Extolling front line warriors.
The song ends with instilling hope in us to destroy the virus

A lovely composition, in Tamil, set to the popular tune of 'mudaa karaatta
modakam' (sung by MS Amma)  bringing out all the aspects in beautiful
verses.  The song has all the traits of a poem, praasa, and what not. And
the rendering is also very appealing with the raaga and the sangati-s
flowing with ease.  My salutations to all those involved in this.
