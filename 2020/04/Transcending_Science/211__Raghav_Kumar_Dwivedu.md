Namaste Sada ji
Good to know about the new book transcending science and my best wishes.

In your post, at the end, there was an intriguing byline possibly of some
other book? maybe viz., "journey beyond the nondual approach".

"Beyond" the dual is the nondual - that may be ok to articulate it that
way.

But then,  your post tagged this oxymoronic phrase "beyond the non-dual"
which does not make much sense. The very word "nondual" when understood
correctly logically rules out any "beyond" to Non-dual.

Om

Raghav
