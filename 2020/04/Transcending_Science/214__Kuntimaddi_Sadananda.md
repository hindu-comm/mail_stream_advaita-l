There should be a colon - but the publisher put the first line with a large font with different colors and the second line - A Non-Dual Approach with a smaller font - white color, and removed the colon in the process.

 Thank you ji for the clarification.
"Journey beyond : A nondual approach"is fine.
Whereas"Journey beyond a nondual approach"did not make sense.
But some modern "gurus" have sometimes talked in that vein and that's incorrect.
The colon made the difference!!

The title is Journey Beyond: A Non-Dual Approach.What you say is correct. Non-duality is in spite of the apparent duality. Hence even the travel beyond has to be done using the apparent duality where 'kRitvaa jnaanam swayam nasyet, jalam kaTaka renuvat' as Shankara Bhagavat paada says in Atma Bodha. The oxymoron is inherent in the so-called Advaitic state.

 Namaste Sada jiGood to know about the new book transcending science and my best wishes.
In your post, at the end, there was an intriguing byline possibly of some other book? maybe viz., "journey beyond the nondual approach".
"Beyond" the dual is the nondual - that may be ok to articulate it that way.
But then, your post tagged this oxymoronic phrase "beyond the non-dual" which does not make much sense. The very word "nondual" when understood correctly logically rules out any "beyond" to Non-dual.
