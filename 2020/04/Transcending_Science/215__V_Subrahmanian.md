In the above context would it be correct to make the statement 'भेदः
व्याप्यः, अभेदः व्यापकः' (Difference is pervaded by Non-difference)? In One
there can be many. I am reminded of the famous
shloka which appears as a dhyanashloka in Vishnu Sahasranama is the last
shloka of Shrutisaarasamuddharanam of Totakacharya!:


भूः पादौ यस्य नाभिर्वियदसुरनिलश्चन्द्र सूर्यौ च नेत्रे
कर्णावाशाः शिरो द्यौर्मुखमपि दहनो यस्य वास्तेयमब्धिः ।
अन्तःस्थं यस्य विश्वं सुरनरखगगोभोगिगन्धर्वदैत्यैः
चित्रं रंरम्यते तं त्रिभुवन वपुषं विष्णुमीशं नमामि ॥

Here, the entire creation of an extremely wide variety, naanaatva, without
leaving out any category, low and high, living and otherwise, is stated to
be the very 'body' of the One Brahman. Only an Advaitin can appreciate this
without distorting the purport of the author of the same. The distortion
can take forms like:  The idea is of dependent and svatantra,
sharira-atma, taadaatmyam, etc.

The One Brahman is the Vyapaka and the variety is vyapya. Shankara has said
in the BGB that this relationship is one of adhyasta and adhishthana type.

बहिरन्तश्च भूतानामचरं चरमेव च ।
सूक्ष्मत्वात्तदविज्ञेयं दूरस्थं चान्तिके च तत् ॥ १५ ॥  13.15

 अचरं चरमेव च, यत् चराचरं देहाभासमपि तदेव ज्ञेयं यथा रज्जुसर्पाभासः ।
