Robert Gernon
-------------

I have been a follower of swami Vivekananda for many years, and only wish to 
expand my understanding of Advaita Vedanta teachings. I'm a seeking after 
truth, and am full of yet unanswered questions about the true nature of our 
existence. Who am I really? Why am I here? What is, here? Will I exist in some 
form, or fashion after I depart this life? Many, many, questions???

-------

I am Nagaraj, interested in Advaita Vedanta. I have been taking veda classes 
from a Guru in California. I am interested in reading on Upanishads and 
attending lectures.
