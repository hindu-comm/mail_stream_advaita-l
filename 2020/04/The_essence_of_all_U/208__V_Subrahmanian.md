In continuation of the above, here are some more references:

Srimad Bhagavatan 11.21.35

वेदा ब्रह्मात्मविषयास्‍त्रिकाण्डविषया इमे ।
परोक्षवादा ऋषय: परोक्षं मम च प्रियम् ॥ ३५ ॥
The three divisions of the Veda, karma, Brahma and devataa, have for their
supreme purport the identity of Brahman and Atman (jiva).

Sridhara Swamin says for the word ‘brahmaatmavishaya’ : the Atman, jiva, is
Brahman alone and not a samsarin.

In the Shaankara Prasthana traya Bhashya, we can see over 60 usages of
these terms ‘brahmaatma, brahmaatmaikya, brahmaatmaikatva’ giving the
purport of the identity of the jiva and brahman.

एतावान् सर्ववेदार्थ: शब्द आस्थाय मां भिदाम् ।
मायामात्रमनूद्यान्ते प्रतिषिध्य प्रसीदति ॥ ४३ ॥

ŚB 11.21.43

*The transcendental sound vibration thus establishes Me as the essential
meaning of all Vedic knowledge. The Vedas, elaborately analyzing all
material duality as nothing but My illusory potency, ultimately completely
negate this duality and achieve their own satisfaction.*

Sridhara Swamin in the commentary says: The Veda, keeping in view Me, the
Paaramarthik Truth, alludes to difference, bheda, which is only illusory,
maayaamaatram. And having alluded to bheda (adhyaropa), it negates
(apavada) it at the end on the basis of the shrutis such as ‘neha naanaasti
kinchana.’

Thus, the terms ‘brahmatma/aikyam/lakshanam’ are common to the Srimad
Bhagavatam and the Advaita Bhashya/other texts. These terms are the
characteristic marks of Advaita.
