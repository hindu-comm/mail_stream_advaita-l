Pranams,
I have read somewhere that Chaitanya Mahaprabhu was a dasanami sanyasi. Is
this true and are there any records to this effect ? Also it appears as if
he has shunned the teachings of Advaita Vedanta and infact preached quite
the opposite of it. Any information on the above will be appreciated.
Thanks and Regards,
