In their 'contact' page, I sent this comment: //In the article
http://www.krishna.com/chaitanya-mahaprabhus-sannyasa-initiation it is said
//...because a sannyasi in the Shankara-sampradaya thinks that he has
become the Supreme,//  Is there any supporting statement in the
Shankaracharya's Bhashyas or the tradition of followers of Shankaracharya
to substantiate the above statement?  Kindly provide any
references/responses. Thanks.//

subbu
