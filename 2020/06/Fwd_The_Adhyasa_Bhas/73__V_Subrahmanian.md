In the Adhyasa Bhashya, at the beginning, is this sentence:

तथाप्यन्योन्यस्मिन्नन्योन्यात्मकतामन्योन्यधर्मांश्चाध्यस्येतरेतराविवेकेन
अत्यन्तविविक्तयोर्धर्मधर्मिणोः मिथ्याज्ञाननिमित्तः सत्यानृते मिथुनीकृत्य ‘अह
मिदम्’ ‘ममेदम्’ इति नैसर्गिकोऽयं लोकव्यवहारः ॥

The gist of the above is: Even though a real 'admixture' of the subject and
object is impossible, yet, owing to the absence of discrimination between
the two, a mutual superimposition is seen resulting in mixing up the real
and the unreal giving expression to 'I am this' (aham idam), 'This is mine'
(mama idam) which is a naturally prevalent parlance.

The term 'idam' (this) is interesting in that we find the Bhagavad Gita
13th chapter starting with the declaration:

श्रीभगवानुवाच —

इदं शरीरं कौन्तेय क्षेत्रमित्यभिधीयते ।
एतद्यो वेत्ति तं प्राहुः क्षेत्रज्ञ इति तद्विदः ॥ १ ॥
'This' body is called the kshetra and the one who objectifies it is the
Kshetrajna, the Knower.
Further, the Kshetra (idam, this) is succinctly stated to comprise the:
महाभूतान्यहङ्कारो बुद्धिरव्यक्तमेव च । इन्द्रियाणि दशैकं च पञ्च
चेन्द्रियगोचराः ॥ ५ ॥   and
इच्छा द्वेषः सुखं दुःखं सङ्घातश्चेतना धृतिः । एतत्क्षेत्रं समासेन
सविकारमुदाहृतम् ॥ ६ ॥

The components of Kshetram, idam, This, are: the five elements, their
combined effects namely the ahankara, buddhi, avyakta (the Ishwara Shakti),
the sense and motor organs (10) and the antahkaranam (together 11) and the
five objects grasped by them (11) namely shabda, sparsha, rupa, rasa and
gandha. The entire graspable world constitutes these five objects. Also,
the transformations of the antahkaranam such as iccha, dvesha, sukha,
duhkha, the body-mind complex, the experience of sentience in this complex
and firmness.  The entire kshetram, idam, this, is thus the samashti and
vyashti prapancha consisting of the pramatru (knower jiva), pramanam (the
instruments of knowing) and prameya (the objective world of sound, touch,
etc.).
