dvātriṁśadatyujjvalakīrtirāśeḥ samā vyatīyuḥ kila śaṅkarasya ||96||

211. In this way, the cure for the sins of the Kaliyuga, the avatāra of Śiva 
Bhagavān, the fame of whose good deeds shone brightly, namely Śaṅkara, lived 
for thirty-two years.(96)

212| bhāṣyaṁ bhūṣyaṁ suśīlairakali kalimaladhvaṁsi kaivalyamūlyaṁ hantāhantā samantātkumatinatikṛtā khaṇḍitāpaṇḍitānām |

212. He wrote well-written commentaries capable of cleaning the filth of the 
Kaliyuga, whose foundational principle is oneness, and which caused the fake 
scholars of bad theories on all sides to cry out “alas! alas!” as they were 
defeated and dislodged from the wrong path with true knowledge.  What more 
could Śaṅkara do?(97)

213| iti kṛtasurakāryaṁ netumājagmurenaṁ rajataśikharaśṛṅgaṁ tuṅgamīśāvatāram |

213. Thus having completed his divine mission the Devas led by Vidhi [i.e. 
Brahma], Śatamakha [i.e. Indra], Candra, Upendra [i.e. Viṣṇu], Vayu, and Agni, 
reverentially came to lead him home accompanied by crowds of Ṛṣis and Siddhas.(103)

214| indropendrapradhānaistridaśaparivṛḍhaiḥ stūyamānaḥ prasūnaiḥ divyairabhyarcyamānaḥ sarasiruhabhuvā dattahastāvalambaḥ |

214. The Devas with Indra and Upendra [i.e. Viṣṇu] the foremost, vigorously 
praised him and worshipped him by showering divine flowers upon his head. 
Sarasiruhabhuva [i.e. Brahma] gave him a hand in mounting his bull and he 
resumed his divine form with matted hair adorned by the moon and to the sounds 
of praise, and accompanied by the Ṛṣis, he returned to his abode.(107)

|| iti śrīmādhavīyaśrīśaṅkaradigvijayasāraḥ samāptaḥ ||

Thus ends the Śrīmādhavīyaśrīśaṅkaradigvijayasāra.

(I have completed the translation.  Now the next step will be to go back and 
revise it.  I've made many typos and other errors along the way and there are 
phrases that could be expressed more poetically or less confusingly.  I hope 
to finish by Guru Purnima and make it available for everyone on our website.)
