199. [His disciples told the public] The elephant-like debaters, their 
foreheads oozing the musk of arrogance, quail in terror on hearing the 
roar of the lion Śrīmad Śhaṅkara the King of Teachers, the all-knowing. 
Flee far elephants of opposing theories! He fights with the sharp teeth of 
sannyāsa.  Making his home in the great forest of Vedānta, he hunts in the 
forest of duality.(60)

200. While hearing this noise, the King of Teachers went to open the 
southern door.  Then a crowd of debaters obstructed him with the intent to 
prevent him from opening the door so hastily.(62)

201| athābravīdvādigaṇaḥ sa deśikaṁ kimarthamevaṁ bahusambhramakriyā |
yadatra kāryaṁ tadudīryatāṁ śanairna sambhramaḥ kartumalaṁ tadīpsitam ||63||

201. The crowd of debaters said to the Teacher, “For what purpose are you 
doing this act in such a hurry? Nothing should be done in haste, only with 
due deliberation.”(63)

“Sir you say ‘anyone may test me.  I know the entire Vedas. There is not 
an atoms worth of knowledge I do not know.’ Oh Desirer of Success, take 
the test and you may enter this temple.”
