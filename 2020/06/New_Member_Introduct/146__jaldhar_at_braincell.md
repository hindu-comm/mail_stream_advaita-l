----------

I have been studying Vedanta, Traditional Yoga, and Samkhya for several 
years now, and have made progress, but have yet to meet or communicate 
with anyone who was knowledgeable in anything deeper or more subtle than 
New Age spirituality or neo-Advaita. The scriptures say that the company 
of wise or holy ones who have sought out the true nature of the self is to 
be greatly valued. The Yoga Vasistha is the greatest treasure I have ever 
found (or been able to recognize), and I think I would be over the moon 
just to meet someone who has read it. I am 48, living in Ontario, Canada, 
married, and working as a professional falconer.
