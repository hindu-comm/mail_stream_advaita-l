॥ Oṃ śrīmātre namaḥ॥

In Śrīdevyatharvaśīrṣam,

Bhaumāśvinyāṃ mahādevīsannidhau japtvā mahāmṛtyuṃ tarati ।
Sa mahāmṛtyuṃ tarati ya evaṃ veda । Ityupaniṣat ॥

Two such days are visiting us (16/June and 14/July). Both days have 
Bhaumāśvinī in Chennai (India). But in Austin, only on 16/June. Check 
your local Pañcāngam.


See the video message from Śrī Kānci Ācārya (content is mostly the same 
but with some changes to account for local traditions). I listened to 
the telugu and tamizh versions.
