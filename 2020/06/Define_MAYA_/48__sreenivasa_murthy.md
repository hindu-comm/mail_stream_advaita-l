 Dear Sri Mahadevan Iyyer,
Sri Gaudapada, paramaguru of Sri Shankara, 
says in Mandukya karike thus:
sA mAyA yA na vidyatE ||
What one sees by his eyes is mAya.What senses are showing is mAyA.
With regards,Sreenivasa Murthy

 Pranams Atman,
I came across many definitions & descriptions of Maya.

1. As per Wikipedia (
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maya_(religion)#Advaita_Vedanta)

 2. *MAYA – The seed-state as POTENTIAL ENERGY. *

( *Brahman with Maya = Ishwara* )



> Due to the connection between the PURE CONSCIOUSNESS (BRAHMAN) and AVIDYA

( *Brahman with Avidya = Jiva* )


3. MAYA - That which is *wielded by ( attribute of ) Ishwara to create Jiva
& Jagat*.
4. Maya is *Brahman with apparent Avidya*, which causes Ishwara.
6. Maya is the *Cosmic dream of Brahman.* ( but brahman is nirguna )
7. Maya is *Ignorance from Ishwara perspective* ( like avidya is ignorance
from Jeeva perspective )
8. *Maya is Anadi*, hence it has no inception. But *has an end through
Moksham*.

 - Is Maya a noun or a verb ?


 - Avidya is clearly understood as the ignorance of Jiva. The locus of
 avidya is in the jiva's mind. But what about Maya ? Could we say that the
 Maya is the ignorance of Ishwara ?


 - Kindly convey the best definition for MAYA ?

*Hari Om,*
Mahadevan Iyer
