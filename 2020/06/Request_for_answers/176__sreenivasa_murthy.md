 Dear Sri Khaaksaar. I thank you from the bottom of my heart for this illumining upadeSa.The mantras from the Upanishads were verifiedwithin myself by myself by applying the appropriate 
prakriyas . All my doubts and questions 
vanished after this verification.

This verification gave me the understanding/realization thatSelf alone is the SUBJECT illumining idagaM sarvamand never the entity 'me' who is also includedin this idagaM sarvam. Till now I was under the notion thatthe entity 'me' was the knower which was an absolute 
misconception. This notion was completely removed by the mantras.

Further, it also revealed that Sruti reveals the facts of LIFEwhich we are not aware of.Once again I thank you for this wonderful piece of upadESa.
With respectful namaskars,Sreenivasa Murthy.

Hari Om, Shri Murthyji and friends, Pranaams!

In ourhumble opinion, these questions can only be answered, satisfactorily, from thestandpoint of one’s own direct anubhava—hereand now—by taking recourse to the Upaniṣad mantras dealingwith one’s true svarupa. 

Accordingly,to address the central point of these questions, we present below two suchmantras from the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣadtranslated by Swāmī Mādhavānanda: 

3.7.23 …theInternal Ruler, your own immortal self. He is never seen, but is the Witness;He is never heard, but is the Hearer; He is never thought, but is the Thinker;He is never known, but is the Knower. There is no other witness but Him, no other hearer but Him, no other thinker butHim, no other knower but Him. He is the Internal Ruler, your own immortalself. Everything else but Him is mortal.

The samemessage is reiterated in the following mantra:

3.8.11 This immutable, O Gargi, is never seen but isthe Witness; It is never heard, but is the Hearer; It is never thought, but isthe Thinker; It is never known, but is the Knower. There is no other witnessbut This, no other hearer but This, no other thinker but This, no other knowerbut This.

Furthercorroboration can be sought from the BṛhadāraṇyakaUpaniṣad mantra 3.4.2: You cannotsee the Witness of the vision, hear the Hearer of hearing, think the Thinker ofthought, know the Knower of knowledge. How so? Yajñavalkaya says you cannot see the Witness because it is thewitnessing principle itself, and so forth. 

In this regard, Shankara’s commentary on Kena Upanisad 2.4 is also worthwhile to explore: nānyatdvāramātmanovijñānāya: There is no other door to Its awareness. (Gambhirananda’strans.). This is the uplabhadhi dvaram उपलभ्धि द्वारं....

The wholething boils down to intuiting who isthe knower, who is the seer, who is the illuminor (prakashaka) of these. It is the chaitanyavastu, the Self, the ever-present witnessing consciousness, the substratum ofall empirical dealings. 

In Āgma Prakaraṇa 12th Karika, we find: turyaṃ tat sarva druk sadā: Turīya is ever existent and ever allseeing (Nikhalananda, trans.). When this truth is known, says GK 1.7(18),duality ceases to exist-- ज्ञाते द्वैतं न विद्यते 

नान्यः पन्था विद्यतेऽयनाय॥ nānyaḥpanthā vidyate'yanāya, says the Svetasvatarupanishad 3.8: There is no otherpath.

Srigurucharansarojrajaratah,

🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏

Namaskaram.

To whom do these questions arise? You spoke of "we" and "the senses", "the
mind", "the states". So it follows there is a relationship between "us", or
said subjectively, "me" / "you", and our senses, our mind, and our
transition between the states, that we are aware of.

There is a state of deep sleep ("turiya"), when we aren't aware of the
aforesaid body and it's senses, or the mind and it's thoughts, or even the
sense of our self (the "me" we associate with, the "ahamkara").

In that state there are no questions, no associations, and yet there was a
"you" sans any associations, which is there now too. That is you ("tat
tvam asi"), the real you, the "atman", the eternal witness.

The "ahamkara" arises (and so does the entire universe arise), and so do
these questions we seek answers to too. The questions, the quest, and the
seeking is all the "ahamkara" (the intermediary between your body-mind, the
universe and you), looking for it's source, the "atman", the real you, for
the answer came before the question.

I hope this helps. I don't consider myself a learned member, and I'm sure
there will be more erudite answers forthcoming.

Best wishes.

Shiva
