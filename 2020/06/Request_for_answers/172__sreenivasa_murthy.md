Dear Friends,

How are weaware of the senses or of the sensations themselves? 


How do we come to knowthe mind or its intuitions themselves? 


And how do we come to know the presenceor absence 


of the mind itself together with its various modifications?

How do we ksow the appearance and disappearance of the States?

I request the learned members of this group to

clarify, in the light of the vedanta, the above doubts of mine.The clarifications are needed to be verified here and now.The help will be acknowledged with a deep sense of gratitude.
With respectful namaskars,Sreenivasa Murthy
