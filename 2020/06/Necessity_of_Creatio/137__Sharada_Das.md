Pranams,
I read few articles about creation and the differences among different
darshanas with respect to creation. One aspect that I could not figure out
was this - What is the necessity for creation ? Why not everything just be
in its primordial state ?
I hope I am not causing embarrassment by asking such a basic question. I am
just a beginner who is not sure how to formulate the question.
If anyone can point me out in the right direction, I shall be indebted.
Regards
