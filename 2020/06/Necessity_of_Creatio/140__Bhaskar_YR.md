IMHO, discounting the creator Ishwara or saguNabrahma earlier stages in Advaita sAdhana is very dangerous. Advaita accommodates upAsya brahma comfortably without sacrificing its ultimate tenet i.e. brahman's nirguNatvaM and nirvikaaratvaM.  In the jagadaadikaraNa bhAshyakAra taken all the pains that how jagat as kArya not different from its kAraNa.  For advaitins this srushti is one of the vibhUti-s of Ishwara and HE is the upAdAna, nimitta kAraNa and upAsana of the Ishwara (or upAsya brahma) has kriyAkAraka phala in the form of chitta shuddhi and krama mukti.  IshAvAsyam idaM sarvaM and even to get Advaita vAsana which ultimately leads us to paramArtha jnana that na nirOdhO nachOtpattiH, we need IshvarAnugraha.

Just my few thoughts.  

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
