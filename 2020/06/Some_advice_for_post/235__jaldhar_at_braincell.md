Welcome.

There is no need for formality, if you wish to ask a question or make some 
observation go ahead and do it.  There has been a lot of discussion over 
the years and you may find that your question has already been answered. 
You can check in the list archives at 
https://lists.advaita-vedanta.org/archives/advaita-l/ Unfortunately there 
is no easy way to search the archives.  (That's my fault and I really am 
going to get around to fixing this one of these days.)

If you are responding to a post, make sure, especially if you read the 
list in digest form, you only quote the parts you are responding to and 
trim away the rest.  That makes it easier to read and avoids having your 
message rejected by the list server software which enforces a maximum size 
limit on messages.  Also do not post images or other attachments, they 
will also be rejected.

Your message did not have a subject line so I have changed it to "Some 
advice for posting on Advaita-l"  A clear and concise subject line will 
help both present readers and those browsing through the archives.
