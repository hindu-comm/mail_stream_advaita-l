Dear friends,
From the posting of Sri Khaksaar, the following conclusionsemerge out according to my understanding :
"I am present and aware. 


That is what I AM. 


Everything else simply arises and sets 


in 'I AM', which isever-present 


and clear as that knowingness that knows 


and, therefore,transcends all appearances." 


Is this not what Upanishads are teaching?

Is this not what a student of Vedanta should 


realize/cognize within himself by himself?



with respectful pranams,SreenivasaMurthy
