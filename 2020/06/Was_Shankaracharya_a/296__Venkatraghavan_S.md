Namaste Raghav ji,
"So the word nArAyaNa used by Shri Shankara shows that he is not a
vaiShNava."

I suppose it depends on what the word vaiShNava means.

If it means someone who believes that Brahman has form, we too are
vaishNavas for we too agree that Brahman takes on the form that is dear to
the upAsaka to bless him.

However, we don't stop there. We say that all that exists is that viShNu
alone. Therefore, anything that appears to be different from Him, we hold
not to be real. The appearance of difference is merely that, an appearance.
When we, who say that all that exists is that mahAviShNu, how can we be
termed a-vaiShNava?

Who is anyone to say we are not one with Ishvara?

Regards,
Venkatraghavan
