I have had this question for a long time whether Shankaracharya was a
Vaishnava
I have listed a few reasons for it
1. The Geetha Bhashya starts with the mangalacharana as Narayanaha paro
avyaktha.
2. Geetha Adhyaya 18 Shloka 61
Ishwara sarva bhutanam hrudeshe arjuna tishtathi
Here shankaracharya comments as Eshwara eshanasheelaha narayana ityartha
3. The 3 amnaya peethas established by him were in vaishnava places viz
badrinath ,puri,dwaraka. Some people also believed that he had stayed in
kanchi for a long time which has the shrine of Varadaraja
4. During his mother's last days,shankaracharya gave him Krishna mantra
upadesha and composed bhaja govindam
5. Brihadaranyaka Upanishad :- eshate mama atma antaryami amrutaha
here while commenting shankaracharya has given the mening of antaryami as
narayana

Due to all these points and many more too, I have had this question
Please throw some light on this

Dr Pradyumna R
