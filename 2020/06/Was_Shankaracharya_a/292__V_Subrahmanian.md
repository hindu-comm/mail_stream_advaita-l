We can also note the following 'pramana' the Dvaitins have to 'prove' that
Shankara destroyed Bhagavata Dharma-s and sat-shaastras:  If Shankara was
really a  Vaishnava, why would he destroy Bhagavata dharmas?

Madhvas also quote purported Garuda purāṇic verses in the same vein as the
above:
The complete text of the Garuda purANa is available here:
http://fiindolo.sub.uni-goettingen.de/gretil/1_sanskr/3_purana/garup3_u.htm
tena saṃkaranāmāsau bhaviṣyati khageśvara /

dharmānbhāgavatānsarvānvināśayati sarvathā // GarP_3,16.71 //
[Owing to this, sAnkarya karaNam, this person will be known as ‘samkara’, O
GaruDa. He will destroy the complete bhAgavata dharma totally.]
On the basis of the above lines of the purāṇa, is there any evidence within
Shānkara bhāṣyas or any other sources of the writings of other Acharyas
that Shankara:
1. Destroyed Bhāgavata dharmas
2. Sat dharmas
3. Criticized sat śāstra-s.
Also, based on the following verses cited from Garuda purāṇa:
maṇimānnāma daityastu sankarākhyo bhaviṣyati /

sarveṣāṃ saṃkaraṃ yastu kariṣyati na saṃśayaḥ // GarP_3,16.70 //
