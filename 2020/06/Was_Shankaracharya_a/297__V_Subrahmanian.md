In Bh.Gita:

यान्ति देवव्रता देवान्पितॄन्यान्ति पितृव्रताः ।
भूतानि यान्ति भूतेज्या यान्ति मद्याजिनोऽपि माम् ॥ २५ ॥

In this bhashya:  यान्ति मद्याजिनः मद्यजनशीलाः वैष्णवाः मामेव यान्ति ।

Some non-advaitins show this bhashyam and question: Look Shankara has
accepted that 'Vaishnava-s' are the ones that attain the Supreme, even
though the shloka does not use that term.

To this I reply: the Vaishnava-s that Shankara is meaning are not the ones
that you mean: For Shankara 'attaining to the Lord' is Brahma atma aikya
jnanam and not going to that loka and residing with the formed Bhagavan.

As you say, the  Advaitic 'Vaishnava' is non-different from Vishnu, the
Vyaapana shiila, and not an entity that has a form by default and someone
who is ever different from everything else in creation. So, the concept of
vastu pariccheda raahityam is also embedded in Shankara's idea of
Vishnu/vaishnava.
