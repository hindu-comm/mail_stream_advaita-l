Namaste.

I don't remember the name of the scholar, but a Senior scholar has proved
the Madhaviya shankara was not authored by Madhava Vidyaranya and it was
authored by some pandit under Sringeri Pitha. How can NP know exactly these
verses?

One possibility remains that these two verses could be from Pracheena
shankara vijayam of which NP knew about, but there is a mention in MM that
is a multiplicity of shankara vijayam texts. This is a point to ponder
about.
