Namaste Krishnaprakasha mahodaya,

The issue of NP quoting mAdhavIya Shankara vijayam is discussed (and is
used to infer the antiquity of the mAdhavIyam) in pages 246-249 of the book
"Sankara's date" written by Sri R.M.Umesh (the link to this was sent by
Smt. Divya Meedin recently). The rumour of a pandit of the Sringeri Matha
writing the mAdhavIyam in the 19th century has been discussed (and
summarily dismissed with proofs) just before this - indeed this was
dismissed even earlier by Swami Tapasyananda of the Ramakrishna math in his
edition of the mAdhavIyam where he calls this rumour "bazaar gossip".

Regards,
Shyam

Regards,
Shyam
