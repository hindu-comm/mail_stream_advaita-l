Namaste Kathirasanji.

Great work by his holiness. I just went through the MM portion of the book.
It gives an extensive description of MM and other fanciful ideas. He is of
the opinion that "Kuto Munda" portion was directly lifted from MSV. However,
his holiness is not partial about MSV. He has critically analyzed portions
of it also. Thank you very much.

All publications of Adhyatma Prakasha Karyalaya are available for download
and online reading in their website.

Regards,
Kp
