Namaste

I had posted so before going through both of these books. Umesh writes that
the author of MM must only have had the text of MSV in mind. Obviously it
means that NP lifted it from MSV. However, Umesh doesn't recognize that
Visvarupa and Mandanamisra are considered as separate by the author of MM.
He writes that MM identifies Visvarupa with Mandanamisra. This is wrong
because Visvarupa is mentioned in opening verses of chapter 7 and only
after him takingsannyasa Mandana is mentioned as seated on an elephant
while indulging in conversation with Acharya.
