Sir,

You have not touched upon the issue of verses quoted above appearing
manimanjari (MM) which constitute almost similar phrases. The list of books
by NP presented here doesn't contain MV and MV.  Anyway, Shyamji has made
some clarification about these verses being dealt upon in the book
authored by Umesh.

Regards,
Kp
