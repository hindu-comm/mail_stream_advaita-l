Namaste sir,
With due respect to you, let me check the article once again and confirm
the name of the author. He seemed indifferent to any matha including Kanchi
pitham. He has criticized the work of  Anantandagiri also which gets
confused to be the work of Anandagiri who lived in an earlier timeframe. It
is this work of Anantandagiri which eulogized Kanchi pitham.

Regards,
Kp
