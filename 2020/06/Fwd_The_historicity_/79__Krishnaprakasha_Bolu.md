Namaste jaldharji,

My issue of concern is how NP arrived at similar phrases as they are in
Madhaviya Shankara Vijayam. It has to be noted Madhwa works have also been
interpolated time again as they have different patha (recensions) even for
the works of Madhwacharya which are collectively named sarvamoola granthas.

My apologies for spelling Anantanandagiri wrongly in the previous post.

Regards,
Kp
