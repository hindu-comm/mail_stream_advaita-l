Namaste.

I think what Umesh says is that MSV must have existed before NP wrote MM
and that MSV must have existed in 14th century. That exactly is the
timeframe in which Vidyaranya pada lived. Umesh is refuting those who
argued that MSV is based on MM. My main concern is settled and that is
whether NP wrote MM. Regarding MSV, Dr. Ra. Ganesh has also expressed
similar opinions in one of his lectures. At least these verses would have
been known to learned scholars of NP's time in the form of legends and he
must have borrowed them. Even if Madhavaracharya who wrote MSV, what was
the age gap between them? (This Madhavaracharya is the son of sayana or
syayana). There is enough time gap for NP to know about it if the  age gap
between Vidyaranya pada and Madhavaracharya is less than 30 years.
