Subbuji - PraNAms
The following statements got my attention:
Bhamati : 2. The mind is the instrument for realization.

Vivarana: 2. The mahavakya itself generates realization.
I am not sure if there is any conflict between the two statements.
'mana eva manushyaanaam kaaranam bandha moksha yoH'
Mahavakya vichara has to be done with the mind only -Hence there is vRitti vyaapti.
There is no phala vyaapti - since it is aparoxam.
The confusion is in the mind and realization also has to happen in the mind only - Mind activated by chidaabhaasa has the notion that 'I am = this' which is also ahankaara.
With mahaavakya vichaara using the mind, it has to recognize the pure consciousness that I am, is not the mind but that which enlivens this mind as well as all other minds too.
In addition, even the Prakriti that includes the mind is only mithyaa, and 'I am' is substantive for the mind and the world too. This understanding happens in a clear analysis (viveka) of the mahavakyas, by the mind.
Not sure, How Sri Madhusudana discusses this.
Shree Venkatraghavanji can shed light on this.
Hari Om!

Thanks for the post.
I like some concepts of Bhamati and some concepts of vivarana schools. Need to think about it.

 Copied from an old post of Sri Ravisankar Mayavaram:

1. Brief summary of
differences:http://ambaa.org/pdf/bhamati-vivarana-differences-brief.pdf

2. Points of Difference Between Bhamati and Vivarana, Based on the Bhumika
of Polagam Sri Rama Sastri, as explained by Dr. Mani Dravid Sastrigal and

I received these documents a while ago from Late Sri Sundararaman mama, I
might have shared these with Advaita-L before. Formatted version has no
new content, I did that for my ease of reading.
