Copied from an old post of Sri Ravisankar Mayavaram:

1. Brief summary of
differences:http://ambaa.org/pdf/bhamati-vivarana-differences-brief.pdf

2. Points of Difference Between Bhamati and Vivarana,  Based on the Bhumika
of Polagam Sri Rama Sastri, as explained by Dr. Mani Dravid Sastrigal  and
translated by S.N.Sastri.

I received these documents a while ago from Late Sri Sundararaman mama, I
might have shared these with Advaita-L before.  Formatted version has no
new content, I did  that for my ease of reading.
