Baskarji - PraNAms
What I meant was - as per vivarana school, locus of avidya is Brahman which Sureshwara also says in this book.As per Bhamati school, the locus of avidya is jeeva - the anyonya ashra dhosha is accounted by anaadi with the example of seed and the tree.
Hari Om!Sadananda

paNchapAdika vivaraNa is the work of later vyAkhyAnakAra, traditionally as we know, sureshwara is the contemporary of bhAshyakAra and at that time vArtikakAra does not identity himself with vivaraNa school or any particular school for that matter.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!

Bhaskarji - PraNAms

Isn't Shree Sureswara part of Vivarana School?

Hari Om!
Sadananda

He also negated any vedantic acharya teachings (Vivarana, Bhamati, etc), affirming that all the guru parampara was wrong interpreting Shankara (with the exception of Gaudapada, Adi Shankara, Sureshvara, and himselfâ€¦).
