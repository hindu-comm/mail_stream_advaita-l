Namaste.

I have heard from my guru  that it is an objection raised against the concept of Avidya of Advaita Vedanta. Though I have not pursued further.

Best regards

Kumar.

Subject: [Advaita-l] Explanation of "Saptavidha Anupapatti" ( The SevenUntenables )

Pranams Atman,
In a recent discourse, I heard about  "Saptavidha Anupapatti ( The Seven
Untenables )". But Swamiji did not elaborate on that topic.
I presume, these seven are anadhi, hence cannot be split into cause &
effect.

   1. Jeeva.
   2. Eashwara.
   3. Visudha chit.
   4. Jeeveshayorbidha.
   5. Avidya.
   6. Tatchitoryoga.
   7. Avidya Sambanda.

  I jotted down these seven from the discourse. Is this correct ?  Kindly
enlighten me.

*Regards,*
Mahadevan.N.Iyer
