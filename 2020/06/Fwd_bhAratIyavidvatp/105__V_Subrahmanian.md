The Advaita Vedanta is the pinnacle of Indian thought.According to many
scholars it is the most logical system of Indian Philosophy,and the
Sanskrit texts dealing with Advaiata Vedanta are the crest jewel of
Sanskrit literature.What had once been a philosophy known only to the elite
in India,was made available to all through out the world when Swami
Vivekananda's illuminating lectures in the west on Advaita Vedanta were
published.Many non-indian scholars have in recent times been fascinated by
the philosophy Advaita Vedanta and have set about studying Sanskrit in
earnest,though the Sanskrit language stands as a barrier to many. A
Dictionary of Advaita Vedanta is a humble endeavour to help such scholars
have easy access to the basic ideas of Advaita Vedanta. The Dictionary is
not an encyclopedia but will be handy and should serve as reckoner to those
students of Advaita Vedanta who do not know Sanskrit but understand
English. This book is the fruit of combined labour of a few competent
scholars,headed by the eminent Prof.Niriod Baran Chakraborty
