Hari Om Chandramouli ji,

Generally wherever mUlAvidyA is questioned, it is stated as abhAva. I was
going through Shiva Gita (which comes within Padma PurANa). In chapter 9,
verse 4, Bhagvan says avidyA to be triguNatmika and pariNAmiNI.

I too had/have inclination to treat avidyA as abhAva, but there are clear
statements in purANAs to the contrary. I must confess that avidyA is
clearly treated as bhAva in smritis.

Regards,
Sudhanshu.
