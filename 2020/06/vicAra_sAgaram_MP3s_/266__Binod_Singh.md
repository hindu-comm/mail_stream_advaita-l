PraNAma,

First of all, this group has done a wonderful job of explaining and
propagating Advaita Vedanta and I really appreciate the passion and
hardwork of all the members here. I hope for higher spiritual progression
for everyone.. Gurprasaad.

I am currently living in Canada and was supposed to go to India in April as
my family is in Delhi. But due to this Corona, I don't see travelling for
at least a year.
I was planning to get the CDs on "vicAra Sagaram" by Swami ParamArthananda
Saraswati ji from Sastraprakasika Trust in Chennai which runs
vedantavidyarthisangha.org or yogamalika.org

Unfortunately, they only deliver and transact in India only. I was hoping
if someone has the MP3s and can forward it to me. I can pay the due amount
as well by whatever means convenient . I have been waiting for a couple of
years to get the pravachanam and I don't want to delay studying
this grantha.

Please let me know if you need any details from me.

Regards,
Binod Singh
