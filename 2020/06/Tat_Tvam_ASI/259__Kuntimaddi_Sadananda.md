Umeshji PraNAms
It is not Shankara's statement - it is a scriptural statement.
Brahman means infinite - anantam.In infinite, there are no parts by definition.Scripure says it is of the nature of sat chit ananda or satyam, jnaanam and anantam.
It also says about creation - Pure existence which is of the nature of consciousness - one without a second - saw - and decided to become many.
Hence it is apparent transformation hence scriptures give three examples - just as gold becoming ornaments, just as mud becoming pots, just as wrought iron becoming nail cutters etc. It is transformationless transformation - called vaachaarambhanam vikaaraH - or namkevaste creation.
Since Brahman cannot undergo creation. Hence scripture itself says it vivartha transformation.
Gold remains as gold yet many ornaments with different attributes and utilities are apparently produced.
That is what is maayaa - makes impossiblepossible - or yaa maa saa maayaa - that which is not there but appears to be there.

At a transactional level, it is real just as rings and bangles are real.
At a higher level they are all the material cause.To recognize that oneness that pervades the whole creation requires a wisdom-eye.

 I am trying to understand how the entire Universe is Brahman only. What arguments Sri Shankara Bhagavadpada puts in his Bhashyas to bring home this realization that the entire Universe including all living and non living beings as Brahman or Consciousness?
