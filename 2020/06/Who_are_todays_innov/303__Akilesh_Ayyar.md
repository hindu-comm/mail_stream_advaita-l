Namaste,

Whether one agrees with their ideas or not, in the 20th century some
immensely creative holy individuals dared to restate the great truths of
Vedanta in new language and from new angles. Sometimes they appeared to
radically break with orthodoxy in doing so. This list might arguably
include Ramana Maharshi, Swami Vivekananda, Sri Satchidanandendra
Saraswati, and Sri Aurobindo.

Are there great Vedantic innovators today? If so, who, and why?

Akilesh
