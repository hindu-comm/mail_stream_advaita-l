Namaste all,

It has taken me nearly six months to resume work on the advaita siddhi, but
the next chapter- asatassādhakatvopapatti: - is available here:
http://www.advaitasiddhi.com/blog/pariccheda-1-http://www.advaitasiddhi.com/blog/pariccheda-1-asatassadhakatvopapatti
<http://www.advaitasiddhi.com/blog/pariccheda-1-asatass%C4%81dhakatvopapatti>

The pUrvapakshi's contention is that if *pramANa*-s are *mithyA*, they will
be unable to achieve their function - which is to reveal their object.
Therefore, if the *advaitin* uses *anumAna pramANa* to argue for
*jaganmithyAtvam*, he has to necessarily accept that the *anumAna* is
ultimately real for it to have validity. If he accepts that the *anumAna*
is real, then *jaganmithyAtva* is falsified (because the *anumAna*, which
is a part of the world, is real, not *mithyA*). If the *anumAna* is not
real, then it is not valid, and *jaganmithyAtva* is not proven.

The arguments used by the *siddhikAra* to refute this are the subject of
this chapter.

Regards,
Venkatraghavan
