PraNAms
I saved the website of Venkatraghavanji. I hope to study soon as it requires a committed study.
My PraNAms to Venkatji for posting these. Shree Anand Hudli had posted few articles on the Advaita Siddhi before.
Hari Om!Sadananda

 Just to inform readers/members that the Advaita Siddhi series in English
is highly appreciated. These laurels enthuse one to take the series
seriously and obtain the best benefit therefrom.

Pranams Venkatji,

I have little knowledge of Sanskrit / Nyaya but lot of interest in Advaita
Vedanta.
I started studying Advaita Siddhi using your translation as basis.
Your work is excellent, of high quality and immensely beneficial to a
sadhaka.

I urge all sadhakas to study Advaita Siddhi in original or at least
translation.
The book brings out the subtle points of Advaita and brings more clarity to
the subject.

I once again bow to Venkatji for his wonderful work.

🙏 Thank you and regards 🙏

Venkat ji Namaste

I was looking for this text translation for many years. Here it is now!😊
I just read the mangalAcharam verse and the translation. It's wonderful!!
Thank you very much🙏🏻

I have copy pasted the work and converted it into pdf and would like to
take print out and I would prefer reading like "Book reading".

Thanks once again.

I'd suggested Venkatji to publish a book, volumes even, as he goes along.
The language used was publishable already when he started.
