PraNAms
Just for the record. There were veera Vaishnavas and Veera Saivas in the south during Ramanuja time itself. As the story goes one Veera Saiva King was ready to capture Ramanuja to kill him. Fortunately, he could escape out of his kingdom with the help of some of his friends and relatives.
Ramanuja time was much before Madhvacharya.
Hari Om!Sadananda

That's true. In fact Trivikrama Pandita was said to have been born as a
prasada of the worship his mother performed for Hari and Hara. This is
recorded in the Madhva Vijaya. A contemporary Madhva scholar in a public
talk added to that information: the worship was done based on 'taaratamya'
: - )

 अभजद् भुवनप्रभू हरीशौ सुतकाम वसुदेवसूनु भक्ता॥13 44|| She was a devotee
of Krishna, that is, that was her ishta devataa. But She worshiped Hari and
Hara for progeny.
