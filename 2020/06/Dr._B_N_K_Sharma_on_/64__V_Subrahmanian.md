That's true. In fact Trivikrama Pandita was said to have been born as a
prasada of the worship his mother performed for Hari and Hara.  This is
recorded in the Madhva Vijaya.  A contemporary Madhva scholar in a public
talk added to that information: the worship was done based on 'taaratamya'
: - )

 अभजद् भुवनप्रभू  हरीशौ सुतकाम वसुदेवसूनु  भक्ता॥13 44||  She was a devotee
of Krishna, that is, that was her ishta devataa. But She worshiped Hari and
Hara for progeny.
