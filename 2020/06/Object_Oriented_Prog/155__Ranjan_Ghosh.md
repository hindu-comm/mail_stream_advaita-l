Dear Atman

Our mind always looks for physical world concepts to understand Advaita. When
I started reading Advaita last year, its similarity with Object Oriented
Programming occured to me. After going through your writings I find my
thoughts were not vague. You have put the comparision in a very lucid
manner and without any gaps. It was wonderful to read.
