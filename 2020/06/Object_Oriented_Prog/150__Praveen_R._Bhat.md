Namaste Mahadevanji,

That is quite a tangent, but interesting nonetheless. My vyAkaraNa teacher
Swamiji used to say that sUtras are like OOP, but I too can see how
inheritance and overloading applies to brahman as an abstract class. :-)

I am assuming that you stumbled across it in the book and didn't really
search "object oriented programming advaita" on Google! Else I'd be curious
as to why!

Kind rgds,
--Praveen R. Bhat
