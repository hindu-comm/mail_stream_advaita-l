Pranams Praveen sir,

Praveen Ji, In a naive way, I think we are also doing an abstract shristi
by programming ðŸ˜‹. For now it is asat, achit and very limited.

I am interested in ideas like Artificial Intelligence, Machine learning and
Automaton Simulation. I am writing an article on "philosophy of computation
and advaita", and stumbled upon it.

It was interesting, so I shared.

*Regards,*
Mahadevan.N.Iyer
