Subbu there is this book written by Sri Nochur Venkatraman Available both in English and Tamil. I have the English version and I found it absorbing. Sri Venkatraman has included Bhagavadpadaâ€™s shlokas , his compositions at appropriate place of Sri  Sankaraâ€™s biography.  I would recommend this book.
