Namaste Scholars,

According to ManiManjari, Achyutaprajna/Achyutapreksha belonged to a
tradition in which they only wore symbols of Mayavada externally but they
where devotees of Srihari. In that case, Achyutaprajna should have taught
Bhagavatham or any another text which glorified Mahavishnu, in the first
place.

Regards,
Kp
