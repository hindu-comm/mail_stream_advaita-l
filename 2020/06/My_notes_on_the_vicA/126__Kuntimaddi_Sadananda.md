Yes. That is right. But unfortunately our respective views were diametrically opposite.

Chandramouliji - PraNAms
It was written many years ago. Normally I take notes in a class and expand in my own way based on the class notes.
Hence, I mentioned it as Notes based on Swamiji's class. When I write it, I express the ideas in my own way as I understand. Some of the slokas that were quoted may not be there in Swamiji's pravachan.
Besides we had some discussion on the parinNama and vivarta on the basis of Panchadashi's text.Gold becoming ornaments comes under vivartha while ring becoming a bangle is pariNaama. Vaacharambanam statement applies - loham iti eva satyam. There was some discussion of milk becoming curds come under pariNaama.

 Pranams Sri Sadananda Ji,

Even if you have reference to the date on which the talk was delivered, I
think we can get reference to the talk number.
