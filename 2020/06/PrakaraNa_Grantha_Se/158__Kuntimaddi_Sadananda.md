PraNams
I would study 'Atmabodha' next. Also Geeta can be studied at any time - first before you study Upanishads and then again after you study Upanishads.One should study or listen to the talks from a teacher.

 PraNAma,

With His kripa, I have gone through Tattvabodha grantha and lectures few
times
I would like to know from your experience, which parakaraNa granths should
be read in sequence, before diving into Gita and Upanishads.

Gurprasaad
