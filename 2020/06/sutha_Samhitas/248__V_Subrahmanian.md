It is of interest that the Suta Samhita, Yajnavaibhava khanda, uttara
bhaga,  Brahmagita, has a summary in shloka form of many Upanishads.  Some
years back I had rendered them in the form of English articles which
Advaita Academy has.   Not sure of the URL where this could be accessed.
The shlokas are very easy to grasp the meaning thereof and added to this,
there is the Advaitic commentary too.

subbu
