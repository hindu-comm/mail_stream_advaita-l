Namaste.

It may be of interest to some that Suta samhita, in Canto 3, Mukti kAnda,
Chapter 9, includes a shortened version of Sri Rudra in stotra form. Thus
even those who are not adhikaris for chanting Sri Rudra, or who have not
learnt to chant the same with appropriate svara, can chant this version of
Sri Rudra. The words are practically repeats from the original. The well
known << नमःशिवाय >> also finds a place in the stotra.

For the information of those who may be interested.
Regards
