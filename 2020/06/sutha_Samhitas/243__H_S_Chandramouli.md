Namaste Sri Subrahmanian Ji,

Sri HH in his ongoing talks on Suta Samhita is referring to Bhashya by Sri
Bhagavatpada on Suta Samhita. But I do not find any references to any such
Bhashya by Sri Bhagavatpada. There is only a reference to Dipika by Swami
Vidyaranya. Can you give any link refernce to the Bhashya of Sri
Bhagavatpada on Suta Samhita.

Regards
