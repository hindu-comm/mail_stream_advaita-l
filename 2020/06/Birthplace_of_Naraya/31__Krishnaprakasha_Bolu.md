Today, I visited the Birthplace of Narayana Pandita near Kasaragod.
Contrary to popular belief, they have not reverted to Smarta tradition.
They are still continuing the practice of offering trikala (three times a
day) pooja to the deity of Lakshminarayana handed over to them by
Madhwacharya himself. They have maintained Vrindavanam for both NP and his
father Trivikrama Pandita. They have no information about any members of
their family settling in parts of Karnataka. According to Madhwa tradition,
they have settled in Ranebennur Taluk of Karnataka. This is where the
confusion starts.
