Sri Mani Dravid Sastrigal needs no introduction. Sri Sastrigal is fluent 
in samskritam. But his thamizh lectures are amazing too. If you are used 
the brahmaNa dialect of thamizh, it will be very natural and easier to 
absorb the content (same is true for the lecture 2 too).

Fortunate that so many of his precise/accurate/well explained lectures 
are available online.


Lecture 2: By Nannilam Sri Rajagopala GanapatigaL (Feb/2019 ~ 2 hrs)

If you google with Sri Ganapatigal's name, you will find tons of videos. 
He is considered an authority by thamizh Astika-s. This is part of his 
upanishad series. I also listened to his very nice 2 hour presentation 
on Chandogya, that covered only a small part. Aitareya being smaller in 
size, entire upanishad is covered here. There is a lot of humor in this 
lecture (MRI, maraNa bhayam, theriyuma/theriyadha, etc.).

If you know thamizh, his every video is worth watching.

Sri Ganapatigal recently passed away and his son Sri Krishna Ganapatigal 
(even though very young in age) has taken on that mantle. I listened to 
his two hour lecture on pitR pUjanam and it was amazing. I am grateful 
that their service is going on.
