Dear friends,Everyone's true svarUpa is this : Ever-present, homogeneous, self-knowing, 
 self-luminous, Self-existent. 
 Never moving (acalaH), never changing (kUTasthanityaH), Never going anywhere or becoming anything. 

One who cognizes the above pointers within himself 
by himself will attain sadyomukti, will be a jivanmukta.This must and should be the goal of everyone.
Thus declare Upanishads and sages.

With respectful namaskars,Sreenivasa Murthy
