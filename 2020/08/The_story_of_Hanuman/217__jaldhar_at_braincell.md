Yes in Northern parts of Bharat this is the common belief though I've 
noticed South Indians do not tend to think so.  Hanuman and Bhairava are 
said to be the Dvarapalas of Shiva Bhagavan and their images are placed in 
front of every Shivalaya in the North.  In my puja during this Shravana 
masa, Hanuman and Bhairava (actually Dattatreya in our case for historical 
reasons) as well as Ganesh, Devi, Nandi, Kurma and Ganga are worshipped as 
parshads before the main abhisheka.
