Yes. Shankara gives the finger poking case to clearly drive home the point,
by direct experience, that light indeed takes the forms/shapes of the
various objects it illuminates. Since we tend to lose sight of that, taking
for granted that light illuminates everything, so what? and lose the
phenomenon of light 'taking the shapes of things', Shankara speaks of the
finger poking.  When we do this, we can directly realize that light takes
the forms that the poking enables.

Swami Paramarthananda ji, in a class, said: When I ask you what all the
light in this room illuminates, you are most likely to list everything
except your own hand which is on the table or which is pointing to the
various objects (while enumerating them).

Thanks for bringing up the point.
