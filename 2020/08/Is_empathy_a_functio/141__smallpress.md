 With all due respect Bhat ji,Lalithalalitha’sresponses to my post was dismissive, insulting, and quite pointless.“If a person is asking whether empathy is a function of ahaMkAra, then itjust means that he lacks a clear understanding of the concept of ahaMkAra.
Now, if he claims that his idea of ahaMkAra is based on some vedAnta work,
then the lack of understanding can be attributed to many factors, like the
work may not explain the idea enough to make its implications clear, or the
translation/teacher is ignorant of the same, etc, or the student is
incapable.”This is not conducive to a discussion, nor respectful, and he was quite wrong.Everybody deserves respect, considering we are in an Advaita group.NamasteSoma

Kindly avoid personal comments on people, especially ones you do not seem
to know anything about! That website is painstakingly made with innumerous
hours, by extremely few qualified, to see to it that the works of the
scholars reach the people that they are intended to reach! It is doing a
great sevA. I prefer not to disclose more about the author as he doesn't
wish it so, but you should find it in the archives if you want to.

Kind rgds,
