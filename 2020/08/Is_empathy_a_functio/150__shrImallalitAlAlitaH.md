kArya-kAraNa-bhAva is not a relation.
You need another relation from those which are clearly defined by others
and accepted or corrected by vedAntin-s.

I appreciate that you presented your views here. It has helped me
understand from where your perception arises.
Milk is not upAdAna-kAraNa of curd, it's avayava-s are. And they are still
undestroyed. The difference in quality of Milk and curd must be defined
because of the difference of asamavAyI-kAraNa.

This observation is correct, but doesn't apply to the upAdAna which is
common to Milk and Curd, both.

Half correct.
No need for things to be generated simultaneously.
Red and Black color arising at different times in the same pot have
tAdAtmya.
