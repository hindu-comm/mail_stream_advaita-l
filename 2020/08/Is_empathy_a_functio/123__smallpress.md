 Thank you for your response.My understanding of ahamkara is from the study of Drk Drishya Viveka.May i know why you do not consider it as Vedanta? And can you elaborate on what you believe it is.Om NamashivayaSoma

 The way you understand ahaMkAra is not similar to what vedAnta uses the
term.
So, the question may not be relevant.
But, if you insist then, yes. Any mental modification, either good or bad,
needs ahaMkAra(chijjaDagranthiH). No vyavahAra is possible without it.
