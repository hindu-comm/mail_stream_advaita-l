If a person is asking whether empathy is a function of ahaMkAra, then it
just means that he lacks a clear understanding of the concept of ahaMkAra.
Now, if he claims that his idea of ahaMkAra is based on some vedAnta work,
then the lack of understanding can be attributed to many factors, like the
work may not explain the idea enough to make its implications clear, or the
translation/teacher is ignorant of the same, etc, or the student is
incapable.
