It exists in those two states, is correct.
But, it is not destroyed in suShupti, just stays as saMskAra. Otherwise,
after every nap there will be a new Raghava-ahaMkAra.

Actually, ahaMkAra is sAxi-bhAsya.
sAxI is avidyA-vRtyupahita-chaitanya.
And since ahaMkAra never appears without qualities, and since those
qualities and their relation is revealed by mano-vRtti; so a mixture of
avidyAvRtti and mano-vRtti are needed.

We use the word 'ahaM' to say/express it.

Correct.
Not knowing English is a hurdle for me.

Correct. That was said in a previous post clearly.

This is what I said as 'And since ahaMkAra never appears without qualities,
and since those qualities and their relation is revealed by mano-vRtti; so
a mixture of avidyAvRtti and mano-vRtti are needed.'

(I am knowing. I am doing etc.) What we experience empirically as this

Appears correct.
Just know that garva(pride) and the idea of oneness with body are also
represented by ahaM.
But, when we talk about ahaMkAra, we are talking about chijjaDagranthI only.
Most people take those two ideas and continue to talk, while ahaMkAra is
defined as what I told.

That thing is chaitanya, that's why we say the mixture chijjaDagranthiH.

They are not separate. But they are not one.
antaHkaraNa is pa~nchabhUtavikAra while chijjaDagranthiH is what we get
when that antaHkaraNa gets reflection of consciousness and appears sentient
and then continues to appear as kartA, bhoktA, etc.
In other words, ahaMkAra is jIva. And, antaHkaraNa is it's upAdhi.

If the same jIva arises from suShupti, then yes antaHkaraNa-saMskAra is
needed.
But, it doesn't mean that it is making avidyA-vRtti-s possible. avidyAvRtti
-s are present in jAgrat too, as in perception of ahaMkAra, sukha,duHkha,
rope-snake, etc.

It may allow our awakening, but the person who slept will die and a new
person  will awake.

So we have to say that avidyA is antaHkaraNa-saMskAra-avacchinna meaning

You are free to deduce based on what I said. I'm leaving this.

sUxma means that it can't work.
If you mean avidyA by sUxma, then OK.

avidyA is upAdAna.

The answer to this should also square with the idea that the antaHkaraNa

Remember
avidyAvRtti is a type of perception,  what we know as sAxi-pratyaxa.
This generates saMskAra.
And then we remember pleasure, ignorance, etc.
You don't remebmber those vRtti-s. You remember pleasure, etc.

The last portion hints lack of understanding where you say that "but are
not experienced at that time". Here it appears that you are talking about
lack of experience of avidyAvRtti-s and not pleasure, etc. That's wrong.


that very antaHkaraNa-saMskAra-avacchina-avidyA provides the upAdAna.

Correct.

Correct.
