Translation  by C. Kunhan Raja and Prof Suryanarayana Shastri  << Now, “if
this be so, between the quality and what has that quality there would not
be the  reciprocal relation of effect and cause ; indeed elsewhere has
never before been seen the reciprocal relation of effect and cause between
what are produced at 6he same time “. If this be said, it is not so ;
because this is intelligible even through the relation of material cause
and the effect of the material cause being seen to exist between what has a
quality and that quality, though simultaneous. And this sight is not a
delusion, because there is no sublator >>.
