This why higher Vedantic sadhana has been taught to be the domain of 
sannyasis.  A sannyasi is detached from the world and has no obligations 
to it.

A grhastha is defined by his attachments which run the gamut from his own 
self-love to ideally love for all beings.  Regulated by dharma, such 
attachments can be a source of great good.  The only dharma cannot do is 
provide is moksha.  Non-attachment is the only upaya for that.
