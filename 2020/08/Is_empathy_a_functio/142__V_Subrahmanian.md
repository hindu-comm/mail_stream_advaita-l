The Advaita sadhaka is asked to cultivate all the Atma guNa-s or sattva
guNa-s as stated in the Gita. This includes 'dayA bhUteShu'.  So, there is
nothing un-advaitic in this. It is by cultivating the mind with these
qualities that one can rise to the realization of the true nature of Atman
which is Brahman. Dvaita, in this context, is the stepping stone for
Advaita. Karma yoga is indeed taught for he who has not yet had the
Advaitic realization.
