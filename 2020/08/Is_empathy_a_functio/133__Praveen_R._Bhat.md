Kindly avoid personal comments on people, especially ones you do not seem
to know anything about! That website is painstakingly made with innumerous
hours, by extremely few qualified, to see to it that the works of the
scholars reach the people that they are intended to reach! It is doing a
great sevA. I prefer not to disclose more about the author as he doesn't
wish it so, but you should find it in the archives if you want to.

Kind rgds,
