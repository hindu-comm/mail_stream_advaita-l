Hari Om ji
Thank you for that detailed explanation. I wanted a few clarifications to
make sure I understand you correctly.

Can i take the example of a green snake being adhyasta on a rope? The
snakeness (dharmyadhyAsa) is not the (samavAya) cause of the (dharmAdhyAsa)
greenness?

You mean the vyAvahArika entities (kaaryas) are all in tAdAtmya sambandha
with their upAdAna kAraNam...

It is true that in place of samavAya we accept tAdAtmya only.

That aspect of ahaMkAra which is in tAdAtmya with the jAgrat-manovRttis is
the ahaMkAra-dhI while the causal aspect which continues even in suShupti
is the ahaMkAra in main sense of the word. Is that right?

Have you mentioned the idea of 'sthUla'-antaHkaraNa as a clause (upAdhi)
because someone can say that even in suShupti, there is a certain sUxma
vRtti implying some anuvRtti of antaHkaraNa is still there (in fact
vRtti-trayaM is there in suShupti I think it is said)?
