  Why are you unable to define what your understanding is and your source? It is possible due to your ahamkara that you have lost perception?Namashivaya.    On Wednesday, August 5, 2020, 08:38:58 AM EDT, श्रीमल्ललितालालितः <lalitaalaalitah at lalitaalaalitah.com> wrote:  

 If a person is asking whether empathy is a function of ahaMkAra, then it just means that he lacks a clear understanding of the concept of ahaMkAra.Now, if he claims that his idea of ahaMkAra is based on some vedAnta work, then the lack of understanding can be attributed to many factors, like the work may not explain the idea enough to make its implications clear, or the translation/teacher is ignorant of the same, etc, or the student is incapable.

 The way you understand ahaMkAra is not similar to what vedAnta uses the
term.
So, the question may not be relevant.
But, if you insist then, yes. Any mental modification, either good or bad,
needs ahaMkAra(chijjaDagranthiH). No vyavahAra is possible without it.
