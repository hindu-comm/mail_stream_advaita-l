No, since they are not dharma and dharmI.
At the same place, if you say that 'the snake is not samavAyI-kAraNa of
green color, then it will fit.

BTW, it does appear that you accept adhyAsa of *sarpatva* in  rope, but
somehow don't accept/know that snake is also superimposed. If so, just
correct that.
Both dharma(*sarpatva*, greenness) and dharmI(snake) are accepted as
superimposed.

Yes.

No.
The adhyAsa with shtUla-antaHkaraNa arises from avidyA and stays only in
states different from suShupti.
This mixed thing is called ahaMkAra.
We use the word 'ahaM' to say/express it.
The perception of ahaMkAra is ahamAkArA-dhI. (dhI is perception and
ahaMkAra is it's subject. Both are different.)
Both, ahaMkAra and ahamAkAra-dhI are accepted in only jAgrat-svapna.
And in those two states, all mano-vRtti-s are generated and since
antaHkaraNa is upAdAna-kAraNa of all vRtti-s, all vRtti-s have tAdAtmya
with antaHkaraNa(which is a part of ahaMkAra).

sthUla-portion was needed. That's true. But, not because of what you
thought.
It was added because that type of antaHkaraNa doesn't contribute to
ahaMkArAdhyAsa.What continues in suShupti, is not antaHkaraNa but it's
saMskAra. That's why you hear some laxaNa of jIva where
antaHkaraNa-tatsaMskArAvachchinna-avidyA-prtibimbita-chaitanya is defined
as jIva.

And whatever vRtti-s you are referring to in suShupti, are not
antaHkaraNa-vRtti. They are avidyAvRtti-s. So, you must correct yourself
there. They don't make me add sthUla-padam above.
