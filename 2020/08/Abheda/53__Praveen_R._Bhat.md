Undoubtedly so. Bhagavan Bhashyakara has already refuted all sorts of
possibilities in the dismissal of other darshanas. This is why it is easy
for us to see how later day darshanas sects are also in error. There are
many philosophies that Bhagavan Karikara also refuted, hinting at their
foundation in the misunderstanding of creation; it is all downhill from
there! We just have to look there to see how others also stand refuted that
came up mixing parts of various darshanas with new terms or flavouring.
