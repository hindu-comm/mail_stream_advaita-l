Namaste,


Terms like ahamkAra, manaH, buddhi and citta come from
sAnkhya shAstra.
antaH karaNa = inner organ, the entity that is involved in
all mental, emotional and intellectual activities
ahamkAra is that part of antaH karaNa that relates to abhimAna
manaH is that part of antaH karaNa that relates to sankalpa and vikalpa
buddhi is that part of antaH karaNa that relates to nishcaya
citta is that part of antaH karaNa that relates to anusamdhAna

In sAnkhya there are multiple puruSa-s, with common prakRti.

vedAnta improves sAnkhya by asserting that the multiple puruSa-s
are actually parts of a higher being. This non separateness
of puruSa-s at a higher level is roughly speaking the heart
of advatia. Everything else is hair splitting arguments.


Regards,
Shrinivas Gadkari
