Namaste.

Sorry the entire understanding is, I think, incorrect. Reference back to
Vedanta Paribhasha is certainly called for. The mental vritti actually is
said to uncover, NOT cover, the Chaitanya/Brahman associated with the
object, ball in this case. When the vikshepa shakti of mAyA projects the
object, ball in this case, it does so along with Chaitanya/Brahman which
remains veiled/concealed (partially). This veiling needs to be removed for
the object to be cognized. This is done by the mental vritti.
