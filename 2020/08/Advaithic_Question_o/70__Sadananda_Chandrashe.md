Namasthe,

I thank everyone who tried to respond to this discussion. I feel
overwhelmed for the great response the question got. I went through the
whole thread. 🙏🙏🙏.
I am not a textbook learner. My knowledge of Advaitha is just Aparoksha
Anubhuthi series of Swami Sarvapriyananda on Youtube and other few teachers
on Youtube and spotify podcasts.

Thank you Bhaskar Sir for bringing this example, because of which there
were so many clarifications afterwards.

Thank you Subbu Sir for the elaborate explanations of Swami Vidyaranya.
information in Verses  155, 156, 157. gave me something to think about, And
also created new doubts.





*155. It is said by the Shruti that Jiva and Ishvara are creations of Maya,
being reflections of Atman in it. Ishvara is like the reflection of the sky
in the cloud; Jiva is like the reflection of the sky in water.156. Maya is
comparable to a cloud and the mental impressions in the Buddhi are like the
water-particles which make up the cloud. The reflected consciousness in
Maya is like the sky reflected in the water-particles of the cloud.157.
Shruti says that this (pure universal) consciousness reflected in Maya is
Ishvara which controls Maya as well. The great Ishvara is the inner ruler,
omniscient and cause of the universe. *

I am of the understanding,
Brahman (universal Consciousness / Awareness / Bliss / Purusha / Eshwara /
INCONCEIVABLE) [Same as Atman within everyone] + Prakruthi ( Shakthi /
Inherent expressing ability of the Brahman)  =  Jagath ( when Brahman
Expresses ) [PRODUCT OF MAYA] [CONCEIVABLE]

Therefore When one sees this material world knowing the background he will
land at the INCONCEIVABLE.

Now,
Isn't it Jeeva the same as Jeevatma / Atman (in us) / Brahman /Ishwara
(universal) ?  Is not Eshwara [(god) (Saguna Brahman)] the same as
Jeevatma/Atman (Nirguna Brahman) within everyone ?
Anyways, As you say the wer of maya is also something which is very
powerful to conceive.

Thank you both Bahaskara Sir and Chandramouli Sir for explanations on the
differences and similarities in YOGA and Advaitha Vedantha.

I have no clashes between the two in my understanding. In my understanding,
Vedantha dissolves even the Yogic god to Brahman and thereby leading to
Higher Reality. But there is absolutely no difference in the truths except
the approaches and views in conceiving it. Anyways As stated in the
beginning i am just a toddler with few youtube lectures seeking for all the
gurus here for understanding. 🙏🙏🙏 I am convinced at least intellectually
that the ' Ball Is Brahman' 😀

Thank you Smasspress Ji  for this treasure. Yes I am aware of Swami
Tadatmananda and Arsha Boda. I, Infact i discoverd him through Youtube and
later started with his Mahabharatha series. Still lot to cover. I will go
through them.

Regards,
Sadananda Chandrashekaraiah
