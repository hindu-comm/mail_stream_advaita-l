In the 98th Dashaka of the popular Narayaniyam, we have a few Advaitic
tenets that are worth noticing.
A pdf containing all the shloka-s of this dashaka with English translation
and a few images from the commentaries of the Narayaniyam for the relevant
verses is uploaded here:

The above images pertain to Narayaneeyam and its commentary. Several
Advaitic tenets are brought out clearly in the original verses and the
commentary. That the world is akin to a dream, avidya is of rope-snake
nature, avidya itself takes the form of the avidya-dispelling vidyaa, the
world is negated and Brahman alone remains over, the gold-gold products
analogy for the world as an effect of Brahman....
