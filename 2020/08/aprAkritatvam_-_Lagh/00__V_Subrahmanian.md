In the 2nd Pariccheda of the Advaitasiddhi occurs the section on 'the
negation of any default form for Brahman':
ब्रह्मणो निराकारत्वोपपत्तिः

अत एव–“अरूपोऽप्राकृतश्च" इति स्मृत्यैवारूपश्रुतिगत्युक्तेः नारूपमित्यनेन
रूपमात्रनिषेध इति–निरस्तम्: स्मृतेरुपास्यपरत्वेन ज्ञेयब्रह्मप्रतिपादकायाः
श्रुतेः सङ्कोचे कारणाभावात्

The siddikara responds to a smriti passage 'arUpo aprAkRiteshca'.  The
passage corresponds to the page 744  printed book of the Ananthakrishna
Sastry edition.  The Laghuchandrika says what constitutes 'aprAkritatvam
and rarUpatvam':

तथा चाप्राकृतपदेन प्राकृतविलक्षणमायोपाधिकत्वेनारूपपदेन च
रूपसामान्यशून्यत्वेन उपास्यत्वमुक्तस्मृत्या लभ्यत इति बोध्यम् |

By the word 'aprAkrita' in the cited passage a form that is distinct from
prAkrita and is mAyopaadhika.  By the word 'arUpaH', what is meant is a
complete absence of the very category called rUpa.  This passage means that
such a Brahman is upAsya, meant for meditating.

Thus, the meaning of aprAkrita is: it is not of prakriti, that is, a
general sequential product of prakriti through the pancha bhuta
transformation but something attributed by the association of mAyA.

Anyone with a different/improved understanding is welcome with the
suggestion.
