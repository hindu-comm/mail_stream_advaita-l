Namaste.

Citing the स्मृति (smRRiti) vAkya << अरूपोऽप्राकृतत्वाच्चे >>  <<
arUpo.aprAkRRitatvAchche >>,  न्यायामृत (nyAyAmRRita)  contends that since
the word 'aprAkrita' is mentioned alongside 'arUpaH' in the स्मृति
(smRRiti) passage, it should be understood that what is denied is any
prAkrita rUpa for Brahman. Not that Brahman is absolutely rUparahita as
contended by advaita. Accordingly it contends  << सर्वैरपीश्वरे
लीलाविग्रहांगीकाराच्च। >>  << sarvairapIshvare lIlAvigrahAMgIkArAchcha|>>.

The response given is that in the स्मृति (smRRiti) vAkya cited, the context
is  upAsya Brahman or apara Brahman, and not para Brahman. Hence the
subject matter itself is different.

My understanding.
