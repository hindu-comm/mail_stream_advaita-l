Alas!  When I sent this post to the Advaita forum, it was not posted for
the reason it contained an image of the book.  Now I am posting it after
removing the image.

In the google groups BVP where several thousand members are there, it
becomes very convenient to post information with images.

Dear All:

We found this fragment of a Book.

Title/Author/Publisher info all missing

It appears to be a Shaiva Bhashya on Brahma Sutras.



https://archive.org/details/the-search-after-god-shaiva-bhashya-fragmentary-sri-kanth-aka-nila-kanth

2 Scholars who were also not aware of this Text said it appeared to be an
English Translation of Shri Kanth Bhashya.

Can anyone identify the Author/Publisher/Title.

I would love to order the Full Book.

Thanks and regards.
