Thanks for mentioning this.

The fonts on that website are superb.  I am especially happy to know they 
include the Unicode Vedic extensions.  A little while ago I wrote about 
how I was compiling a text on Shiva puja for my personal use.  I did it 
and I used the freely available chandas and siddhanta fonts for the 
vedokta mantras.  While those fonts are complete in coverage, they are not 
that great aesthetically.  The Adishila fonts look much better.
