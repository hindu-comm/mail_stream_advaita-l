Namaste

Here is the link to the document of some 350 pages in searchable format
consisting of the famous Saubhagya bhaskara commentary of Sri Bhaskara raya
Makhin to the Sri Lalita Sahasra nama.

The first  page of the document, consisting of the publication details, is
not showing in readable format. However the main body of the text is
unaffected.

I thank those who helped making this long felt need addressed.
