Hello sir.
I understand what you are saying. As the moderator of the group it's your
duty to keep the discussions on topic.
My only intention in that email is that I have no other source or person
who I can ask my doubts to.
Sometimes when I read a few things it scares me and disturbs me a bit. The
only option I have is to post it in the group.
But still I won't be posting in the group anymore.
Few respected and members of the group have emailed me personally.
They have provided me material for beginners. They have asked me to email
them if I have any doubts. I can't even describe the compassion and
guidance they have shown me. I once again thank them.


Om namah shivaya
Thank you
