Further, here is another reason why eternal hell interpretation to those
non-Vishnu bhaktas by Dvaitins is a logical failure: Imagine that a jIva
was indeed thrown into eternal hell. What is the reason he wasn't in hell
before? Because he was definitely not a non-Vishnu bhakta; meaning he was a
Vishnu-bhakta. Why was he born at all in that case? Shouldn't he have been
liberated already then?! At the very least it should be agreed that
Vishnu-bhaktas will be born again.

All systems that take no effort to avoid contradiction with other shrutis
have this flaw. Advaita Vedanta seems to be the only one that has ShaDliMga
analysis for tAtparyanishchaya and therefore, everything fits in line
without any contradiction. Dvaitins consider interpreting individual
statements on overall tAtparya and arriving at the overall tAtparya by
interpreting individual statements as having anyonyAshrayadoSha!
