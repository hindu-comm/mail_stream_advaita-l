Dear Kaushik,

>From your membership details, it is learnt that you are 10+2
and I understand you are 18+. 

These questions from a teenager who just passed high school 
indicate the seriousness.  A vedanta student should not approach
with such questions.  Reading books from here & there, cursory glance of
vedanta terminology from online sources etc. is not a good start. 

Take one prakaraNa grantha like tattva bodha etc. are delve deep into it.  

Though at this age of yours, I don't advise anybody to study vedanta.  
A firm and sound foundation of sanskrit is required. 

First study sanskrit, few kavyas, tarka sangraha, laghu siddhanta kaumudi then
go for vedanta study. 

regs,
sriram
