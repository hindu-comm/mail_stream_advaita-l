I-iv-10: This self was indeed Brahman in the beginning. It knew only Itself
as, ‘I am Brahman’. Therefore It became all. And whoever among the gods
knew It also became That; and the same with sages and men. The sage
Vamadeva, while realising this (self) as That, knew, ‘I was Manu, and the
sun’. And to this day whoever in like manner knows It as, ‘I am Brahman’,
becomes all this (universe). Even the gods cannot prevail against him, for
he becomes their self. *While he who worships another god thinking, ‘He is
one, and I am another’, does not know. He is like an animal to the gods. As
many animals serve a man, so does each man serve the gods. Even if one
animal is taken away, it causes anguish, what should one say of many
animals ? Therefore it is not liked by them that men should know this.*

*Unless *twisted or turned the above meaning is pretty straight forward.
The above being shruthi has higher value to the puranas you have quoted.



I sincerely apologize if I have said something wrong. I am ready to know my
mistakes. I am waiting for any respected elders of the group to further
add.
