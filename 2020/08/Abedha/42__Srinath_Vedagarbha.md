Thank you for agreeing yours is not an argument.

The hEtu  sAvayavatvAt anityatvaM is quite evident it is based on
pratyaksha. What about shruti hEtu "bR^ihanto hi yasmin.h guNAH" for the
laxaNa of Brahman?  Are you going to deny Brahman just because there exists
nAnatva of guNas?  Flaw in the "argument" is quite evident. Applying hEtu,
which was derived from pratyaksha, on to the paxa which is known only
through aagama. That is vyabhichArAnumAna in my humble opinion.

Also, your assumption of existence of boiling oil etc in eternal
andhatamas is unprecedented
