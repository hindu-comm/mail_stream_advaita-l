I have read more than 1 translations and the same is repeated. No change.
I'll try to get hold of the sanskrit verses if possible. It'll be better.
As the translators are nuetral I don't think they will try to change the
meanings in any case I'll bring the sanskrit version.

These I don't know. The elders in the group will answer to these I hope.

Actually it doesn't sir. At the time of construction of the pillar, Lord
wasn't seen. Only when he took the form as narasimha he was visible. So
again I raised this question before. When Lord rama, krishna, narasimha
took form they were visible to everyone. So the Lord prevades the world
with another aspect of his.
And if something or some property exists which isn't him then the supreme
lords omnipresence is compromised
I had told that air isn't visible to pratyaksha as well. But it obeys
physical laws. So laws applying only to viewable entities doesn't hold
water.
