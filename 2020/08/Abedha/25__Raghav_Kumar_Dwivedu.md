Namaste

This verse taught by Bhagavan Sri Krishna in the Bhagavad Gita is one of
many teaching advaita.

अनादित्वान्निर्गुणत्वात्परमात्मायमव्ययः ।
शरीरस्थोऽपि कौन्तेय न करोति न लिप्यते ॥ ३१ ॥

The Self , although dwelling in the body, does not act and is therefore
untouched by the results of action; it is not subject to decay since it is
eternal and free of any guNas.
