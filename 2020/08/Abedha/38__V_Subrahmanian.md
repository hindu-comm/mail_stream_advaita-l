According to Madhva-s, they have identified 21 'Ku-bhashyas' that Madhva
has refuted/rejected.  Of course this list includes Shankara, Bhaskara,
Yadavaprakasha, Ramanuja and others.  As per their Ishavasya
interpretation, all those who hold/subscribe to 'mithya jnana' (flawed
doctrine, that is, opposed to Madhva's system) are destined to andham
tamas.  So, the entire 21 are suffering in that region. The brand of
Vaishnavism of Ramanuja and all others who came after Madhva, Nimbarka,
Chaitanya, etc. are all unacceptable to Madhva and thus these individuals
and their followers are in andham tamas or on the way to it.. In fact
according to them whoever opposed, fought with and were slain by Bhima in
the Mahabharata  are asura-s and thus in andham tamas.
