 Yes. In one debate on tattvamasi/ atattvamasi, it was leveled against Mani
Dravid Shastri ji saying that things have to  be interpreted in the
context. The tAtparya has to be understood.

There is no anyonyAshraya as the mantras are learnt as taught by an Acharya
who already knows the tAtparya as taught. The ShaDliMga analysis is only to
justify our interpretation. Even if we reinterpret the statements earlier
misunderstood or superficially understood as per the tAtparya, there is no
such doSha. This is also why multiple rounds of study across levels helps
get a firmer understanding; mUla, followed by bhAShya, then TIkA, and
TippaNa. That no shruti or smRti should contradict another shruti is
well-known, at least in Advaita Vedanta.

Undoubtedly so.
