Namaste,

I am quite delighted to see you have studied Madhva's Mahabharta Tatparya
Nirnaya (MBTN).

My understanding is that actual attainment is not until end of Brahma
kalpa. There is no such thing as "jivan-mukthi" in the siddhAnta.

Vayu Purana as quoted by Sri Sankarshana Odayaru (in Dvaita tradition)

  muktiyogyAnAM tu yalliN^gaM virajAtaraNAvadhi
  tamoyogyAnAM tu yalliN^gaM gadayA vyapohati
  nityasaMsAriNAM tu yalliN^gaM hUN^kAreNa vinashyati |

For muktiyogya jIvA-s, lingadEha stays till virajA river. For tamoyogya-s,
it is removed by gadAprahAra by vAyu, and for nityasaMsAri-s, it is
destroyed by hUN^kAra
by vAyudeva."

Again, in my limited understanding is that ManNimAn will be doing his so
called "sAdhana" till the end of this kalpa. I may be subjected to
correction.

That is so in the ordinary sense. As long as there is a boon (or shApa),
the birth is determined. Also look at it from a different perspective --
the very karma they did (doing tapas and getting boon from Rudra)
determined their next birth. But the very intention behind doing such
karama is based on their svarUpa (of keep wishing/doing evil). Given that
Parabrahman is quite impartial to anybody, enables their wish.

I will dig into that.
