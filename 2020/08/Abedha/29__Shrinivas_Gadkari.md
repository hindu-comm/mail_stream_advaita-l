Namaste ShriSrinath Vedagarbha,

What I have summarized is my understating - and very likely it is not
fully aligned with any standard school of thought. This is the understanding
that I have arrived at based on my study and contemplation until now.

"identity+difference" that I am referring to:
One can use analogy of fire and spark here.
One can understand what fire (Ishvara) is by understanding spark (jIva),
Whatever tattva is inIshvara same is to be found in jIva.
This is the similarity.

InIshvara, each tattva is found it its grand state, in jIva it is in an attenuated state.
This is the (big) difference.

One falls down (hell) not based on what viewpoint one subscribes to but based on
what relationship one develops withIshvara. jIva has to realize the supreme efforts
that Ishvara is continually putting in for the sake of jIva-s and the entire creation.
This realization should develop into gratitude and love. This is bhakti in its
pure form. With this form of bhakti in heart, hell is very difficult to attain.

Regards,
Shrinivas

Your position of "identity+difference" has been explored extensively in Dvaita and rejected as untenable.

In acintyAbhedAbheda doctrine (as per Baladeva's Govinda Bhashya onBS), there are three aspects of shakti in Brahmn viz., para, apara and
mAya sakti. While trying to avoid Sri.Madhva's refutation on AdvaiticBrahma parimANa vAda, Sri.Baladeva takes the position of Brahma sakti-
pariNAma vAda by holding jIva is modification of apara shakti and jadaprakriti is modification of mAya sakti aspect. Brahmn in para aspect
remains changeless (nirvikAra).

As far as Dvaita is concerned, any theory of pariNAma of Brahmn,either involving directly of Him or through His sakti aspect would
undermine shruti's position B's nirvikAratvam and against divinity.

Acharya Madhva and his commentator Sri.JayaTirtha reject theseBrahma pariNAma vAdas on strong grounds. They anticipated this sort
of sakti-pariNAma vAda and thus refuted in their works (AV and NS). The central point of their refutation is based on questioning the very relationship between
these aspects of Brahmn.

What is the relationship between para, apara and mAya aspect ofBrahmn? Are they identical (abhEda) or identical-cum-difference
(bhEdAbhEda) ?

They can't be identical, for all three aspects have to transformsimultaneously in order to modify into jIva and jagat. In such a case,para aspect fails to remain as nirvikAra.

They can't be identical-cum-difference either, for atleast in respectof the identity part in 'identity-cum-difference' there again would bethe problem of overlapping of aspects and loss of nirvikArattvaof 'para' aspect. If it is argued, the 'difference part' (inidentical-cum-difference) will prevent this overlap & loss ofnirvikArattva, it is then asked, why such a useless 'identity' part
is still kept alongside 'difference'? Why not justdiscard the 'identity' part altogether and hold pure difference between them?

Thus, Sri.JayaTirtha's argument advocates, even sakti-pariNAma vAdinshould admit the eternal difference between their three aspects ofBrahma sakti. Para aspect acting as an efficient cause of thetransformation, still keeping nirvikArattva intact; and where asother two aspects modifying themselves into jIva and jagatrespectively and thus material cause.

But, when such absolute difference is admitted, those aspects failto be as 'aspects of Brahmn', for it violates shruti'sswagatabhEdattva of Brahmn on one hand and logical contradiction of
absolute difference in the unity, on the other. Thus, instead ofholding 'aspect of Brahmn' (bhAga) doctrine, it should be admittedthose aspects are nothing but the three fundamental principles assuch in the ontology, just as Dvaitins hold.

But, a (acintyA)bhedAbheda vAdin might object to this and still triesto justifies the relation of identity-cum-difference citingSri.Madhva's doctrine of bheda-abheda between guNa and guNI by virtue of acintyAsakti of Brahmn.

But, Acharya was very explicit in vyApti of his bheda-abheda-thru-acintyAsakti doctrine to jada and its attributes only. According tothis doctrine, Parabrahmn thru His acintyAsakti causes the bheda-abheda relation between insentient objects and their attributes.He never advocated such bheda-abheda between two sentients itself inone case (Brahmn-jIva) and a sentient and insentient in another case(Brahmn-jagat). Thus, it is indeed an illegal extension of Madhva'soriginal doctrine beyond its legitimate limits by acintyAbhedAbhedavAdin.

According to Acharya Madhva, Parabrahmn's power (acintyA sakti)should not be invoked in such a manner that it affects the verysovereignty of Brahmn.

Thus, Brahma pariNAma vAda in any flavor, either directly by Brahmnas in Advaita or through Brahmn's shakti as in acintyAbhedAbheda, isnot acceptable to Acharya Madhva.
