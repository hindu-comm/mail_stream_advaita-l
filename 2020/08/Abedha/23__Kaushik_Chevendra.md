Doesn't the Lord also even if a person does the the most worst sin. If he
takes shelter under hari he is saved.
Lord also says a confirmed sinner worshipping the Lord should be
considered  saintly as he has taken the best resolve.


Isn't Lord the inner controller for the tamsic souls as well?

Thank you sir.
