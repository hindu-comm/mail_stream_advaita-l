Alright, let's talk about logic.

This is wrong logic.  Per your logic only vishnu-bhaktas should have been
born.

If we were to apply your logic, Lord Krishana should be considered as
either ignorant or a liar when He says  "AsurIM yonimApannA mUDhA
janmani-janmani" (about tamasik jIvas).

Let's take a step back and question -- why would any jIva take birth after
birth even after they are intersencially said to be one of the three types?
In this question, are you denying the existence of three types of jIvas as
such? or are you questioning why they are put into the cycle?

Answer to both the questions is BG 101.

  There is no such thing as "free lunch". Everyone has to tread their
journey. Again, BG 101.

Correct, they will be born till they work towards and reach their
completeness. So also people with mithyA  jnyAna. There is nothing special
about vishnu-bhaktas in this context.

What are other shrutis which are in contradiction?

Correction -- it needs extra adhyArOpa-apavAda to explain away any
contradiction. Mere tAtparya lingas and samanvayA (as mandated by
sUtrakAra) are impotent in explaining seemingly contradicting shruti
assertions. Please note this.

It seems you are not educated about savakASha and niravakAsha statements.
