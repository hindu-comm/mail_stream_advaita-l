You have missed the point sir. My point was a tamsic soul or a sattvic soul
who worships hari is saved. That's what krishna says. Even a confirmed
sinner, a person who has commited the worst sin, if he worships krishna he
is saved from all sinful reaction. Let him be a tamasa soul or sattvika ,
hari is the saviour.
