Not mine, everyone's! It is a plain and straightforward derivation based on
Dvaita philosophy! As per Dvaitins' analysis, only Vishnubhaktas should
have been born. And maybe then they become other bhaktas or non-bhaktas or
whatever?!

Again, not mine, it is your philosophy where logic is also failing. Good,
shift the blame to Krishna! So as per Dvaitins, Krishna was a liar when he
said kShetrajnaM cApi mAM viddh, jnAnI tu Atmaiva me matam.

Also, talking about Krishna as a liar is not following "lets talk about
logic". Your pratijnA in this email itself fails.

The antaHkaraNa is of various types, yes, based on saMskAras gained across
janmas and that keeps changing as per additional karma, upAsana, etc.

I'm questioning how non-Vishnu bhaktas miss the eternal hell in the earlier
janma whichever be the type of jIvas you consider them to be.

Since we have diff interpretations of Gita, Gita 101 doesn't work.

Oh, so you're saying Vishnubhaktas wanting liberation is like free lunch?!
I agree. BG101, also agreed.

At the very least it should be agreed that

Well, then it is not that those with mithyA jnAna get eternal hell? What
exactly is Dvaitins' stance? Eternal hell and born again are contradictory,
logically, aren't they? Or being born again itself is eternal hell?! Again,
lets talk about logic pratijnA has been thrown out of the window.

If you didn't know that you wouldn't be on this arguing against Advaita.

Okay, your misunderstanding of mImAMsA has been noted.

Only as uneducated as all the Dvaitins are about Advaita Vedanta. That was
paying back in your own coin. As for the statement itself, it is from your
own famous Dvaitin Acharya in a vidvatsabhA. avakAsha is irrelevant in the
context as per your own, else he should have explained it when visheShaNas
and lakShaNas were being discussed.
