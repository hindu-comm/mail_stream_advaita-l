Many people do not understand or do not wish to understand that Advaita
endorses and validates bhakti and all the various worship traditions of
India. Ishvara, the Cosmic Intelligent Being is accepted in Advaita.

They wrongly think that the importance of Advaita as the mainstream/core of
the sanAtana dharma only came to the fore in the 19th century. That too
ostensibly for awakening "Indian nationalism"!!
