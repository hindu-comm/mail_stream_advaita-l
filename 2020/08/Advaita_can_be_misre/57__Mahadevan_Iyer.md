Pranams,

Such a shame. Devdutt Patnaik became best selling author by retelling 
Puranas. He has also his own Gita ðŸ˜•. I have heard his talks in litfests 
but never read any of his books. I always had good regards for him as a 
person who try imparts scriptural knowledge though his books.

This article clearly shows that he have no clue about, even the basics 
of Advaita. This is why, I think, qualified & knowledgeable people, have 
an obligation to propagate right knowledge. Otherwise  ignoramus like 
Patanaik, claiming to be an expert in Hindu culture, will spread his 
callow views as truth.

Regards

MD
