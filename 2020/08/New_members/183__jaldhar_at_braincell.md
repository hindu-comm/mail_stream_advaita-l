I am a teacher with university of Madras Interested in spiritual knowledge


Michael Dhvani
--------------

I have been studying advaita for more than a decade, mostly through lectures 
and writing by acharyas of Arsha Vidya Gurukulam. I find it to be the most 
consistent and inclusive of all existing religio-philosophical systems of 
thought and I am convinced that the vedantic conclusions on Consciousness and 
Reality provide the most relevant and revealing solution to the human problem. 
I have been searching for a platform to confide my advaitic queries and from 
the scope you provide I hope this is the right place...!


Tapas Chakraborty
-----------------

Have a deep interest in advaita vedanta philosophy, following swami 
vivekananda and By getting associated with this group would like to enhance my 
understanding in this area.


Sadananda Chandrashekaraiah
---------------------------

I have become interested in the philosophy after listening to the series of
lectures from swami Sarvapriyananda on Aparokshaanubhoothi. I am trying hard
to understand the nature of reality where we are living. Although it seems
hard to comprehend the truth advaitha gives me a great relief. I would like
to be a part of this group to know more about advaitha philosophy.

Shyama Chaitanya

Om Namo Narayanaya,

I left World Bank in 2016 to study Vedanta and am a monk now. I study (also
teach) with the guidance of traditional Acharyas at Kailash Ashram and
elsewhere at Rishikesh. I chanced upon a discussion on Madhusudan Saraswati
on the net and liked the richness of it. Would love to be a part of your
mailing list. Thank you in advance.  Om.
