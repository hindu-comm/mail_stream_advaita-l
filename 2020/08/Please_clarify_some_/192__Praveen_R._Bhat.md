sAkShi means witness. sAkShi is changeless, separate from jIva and also
called as jIvAtmA or kUTastha.

I don't know where this is in dRgdRshyaviveka (DDV); they are two separate
words to mean the same thing. In fact, there is no usage of chaitanya in
DDV as I see, there is chetana, which means sentient. chetanatA is
sentience.

Yes. And also same as chit.

They are the same, but AtmA is generally used for the innermost Self at the
individual level and brahma for the sacchidAnanda reality underlying the
microcosm and the macrocosm, bereft of any guNas. The saguNa brahma is
Ishvara, the Lord, macrocosm.

vikShepa, as one of the two shaktis of avidyA/ ajnAna, is the projection of
the world, as also the body-mind-sense complex which is the part of the
created/ manifest world. It is easy to miss the latter.

AvaraNa is the other shakti of avidyA/ ajnAna that veils the real nature of
AtmA.

Once you get these English meanings, it is better to stick to Sanskrit
terms, as they cannot have direct translations.
