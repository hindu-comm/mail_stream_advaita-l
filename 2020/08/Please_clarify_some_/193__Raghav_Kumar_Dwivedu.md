On AvaraNa and vikShepa, please see the above link


The *mind itself* is a part of the projected World. So we don't say the
mind "has" AvaraNa etc. Maybe you are already clear about this. But thought
I would reiterate this.

In deep sleep, there is no manifestation of the mind or world. No vikShepa
is present. But AvaraNa is still there.
