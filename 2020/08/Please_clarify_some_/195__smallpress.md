 Very interesting thought, Raghav. If no mind in sushupti, which seems right, how can there be avarana?Kindly clarify.Thank you.

On AvaraNa and vikShepa, please see the above link


The *mind itself* is a part of the projected World. So we don't say the
mind "has" AvaraNa etc. Maybe you are already clear about this. But thought
I would reiterate this.

In deep sleep, there is no manifestation of the mind or world. No vikShepa
is present. But AvaraNa is still there.
