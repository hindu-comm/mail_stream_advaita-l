In the Jivanmukti viveka, Swami Vidyaranya cites a verse from the Laghu
Yoga Vasishtha that comes as a clarion call for deep contemplation:

अन्तःशीतलातायां तु लब्धायां शीतलं जगत् |
अन्तस्तृष्णोपतप्तानां दावदाहमयं जगत् ||

[To those who have gained internal composure, the whole world becomes cool
and calm, while, to persons burnt by the flames of internal desires, the
world is one huge conflagration.]

What the world is is decided by what the mind is. Another dimension of this
is:

दृष्टिं ज्ञानमयीं कृत्वा पश्येद् ब्रह्मयमं जगत् |  (Aparokshanubhuti)

Om Tat Sat
