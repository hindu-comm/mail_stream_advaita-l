I meant as a reply to your asking about translation of Shankaracharya's
commentary, meaning on the prasthAna-traya. There may be other books also,
but the commentary-translations are good to have. You could try buying one
and then buy others, if you like it. Or check out the Gita translation
freely available on Gitasupersite, even before buying any.

Kind rgds,
