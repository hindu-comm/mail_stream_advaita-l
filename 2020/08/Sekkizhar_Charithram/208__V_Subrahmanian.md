Here is a grand series of discourses in Tamizh on the Periya Puranam.  The
scholar, though new to me, is a mine of information on Tamizh poetic lore
and Marathi bhakti literature. He is an accomplished singer too and is
soaked in Sampradayam. Those with a flair for Tamizh literature will
experience the joy of bhakti flowing through these compositions.

The Tattvam is also presented without fail.  One can access all the talks
so far and listen to them as a daily feature.
