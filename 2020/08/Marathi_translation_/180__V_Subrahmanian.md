Sri Sunder Hattangadi kindly supplied two links, both for the Part 1
(prathama pariccheda) only:

https://ia801003.us.archive.org/16/items/advaitasiddhimarathi/Advaita%20Siddhi-Marathi.pdf


Another link, for the same part:
https://archive.org/details/advaitasiddhimarathi/mode/2up

If anyone can look up the remaining part(s), that would be a great help.

regards
subbu
