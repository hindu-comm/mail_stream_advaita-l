Dear Sir

Dr BNK Sharma (late) was an eminent scholar and a serious researcher. He
was not prone to writing off the cuff. There are Advaita books which
mention funny things about Dvaita thought. On both sides there are people
who make statements. We need to give weightage to serious scholarship and
genuine interest in understanding the schools
