Pranams Shri Praveen ji,

I understand Praveen ji. Thats just how he is referred as in here. 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajneesh .

Please take my "Bhagwan" mention with a pinch of salt.

I personally, don't follow any particular GOD man.

But sometimes, during my morning walks, I hear his old Hindi pravachans. 
I find it easy to listen to and enjoyable at the same time. Hard 
Vedantic subjects require lot of attention & note talking. So, its not 
ideal for morning walks.

om tat sat

Mahadevan
