Pranams,

No offense intended.  Thats how he was popularly referred as, before he 
took the name OSHO.

I found it interesting, because I also felt the same, hence I shared it 
in the list.

I believe we can learn from everyone.

Please remove it from advaita list, if it doesn't belong here. I am 
unable to do it from my end.

Hari Om Tat Sat.

Mahadevan Iyer

Whatever that con artist called himself he has nothing to do with 
Advaita
Vedanta and doesn't belong in Advaita-l.

Well all I'm going to say is perhaps you should read a little further
about what the word Bhagavan means.
