Namaste,
The next chapter of the advaita siddhi, asata: sAdhakatvAbhAve
bAdhakanirUpaNam (the refutation of the argument that unreal things are
incapable of having causal efficacy) is available here:

http://www.advaitasiddhi.com/blog/pariccheda-1-asata-sadhakatvabhave-badhakanirupanam-part-2

This chapter takes up the various arguments made in the *nyAyAmRta* wherein
it is argued that an unreal object is incapable of causing a real effect.
The advaitin offers the dream and rope-snake as a counter-example to this,
and argues that unreal objects are able to create an empirically real
happiness / fear, etc. The dvaitin's retort is that in such cases, it is
not the unreal dream object or unreal rope-snake that causes fear - rather,
it is the cognition of the dream object and unreal rope-snake which causes
the effects - and such cognitions are real. This chapter in the advaita
siddhi offers important arguments in refuting this.

Kind regards,
Venkatraghavan
