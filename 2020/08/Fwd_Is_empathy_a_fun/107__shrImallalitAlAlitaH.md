I'll write here a few sentences in Sanskrit, since that is an easy way to
present paribhAShA-s.
अयुतसिद्धानां नित्यः सम्बन्धः समवायः इति तार्क्किकमतप्रसिद्धम् ।
यत्र यत्र च तार्क्किकैः समवायः स्वीक्रियते तत्र तत्र
मीमांसकैर्वेदान्तिभिश्च तादात्म्यम् अङ्गीक्रियते ।
तादात्म्यं नाम अभेदः ।
अत्यन्ताभेदस्य च सम्बन्धत्वासम्भवात् भेदसमानाधिकरणोऽभेदः तादात्म्यम् इति
परिष्क्रियते ।

तत्र उपादानोपादेययोः तादात्म्यं यथा तथा गुणगुणिनोः क्रियाक्रियावतोः
जातिव्यक्त्योः  केवलविशिष्टयोः अवयवावयविनोः अंशांशिनोः भवति । तत्र एकतरस्य
सत्त्वेप्यन्यस्योत्पत्तिविनाशदर्शनाभ्यां तादात्म्यस्य न समवायसदृशं लक्षणं
कर्त्तुं शक्यते ।
