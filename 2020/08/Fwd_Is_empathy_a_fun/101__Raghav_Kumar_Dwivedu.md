Namaste ji

For the record
Milk = protein (casein etc in thin form) + sugar (lactose) + water

Upon adding bacteria (lactobacillus) we get

Milk + bacteria ------> fermentation-------->
-----> proteins (coagulated or thick form) + lactic acid formation + water

The bacteria chemically "reacts" with (so to speak) the lactose sugars and
produces lactic acid. This acid causes a physical change in the protein
making it thick (coagulated).
