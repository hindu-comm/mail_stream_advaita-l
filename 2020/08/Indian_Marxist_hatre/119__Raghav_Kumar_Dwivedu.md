Sri Mani Dravida Sastrigal's photo adorns a Marxist diatribe against the
New Education Policy of the government just because it promotes study of
sanskrit. Reading the article is a good remedy for low BP.

The article is relevant for students of Advaita because, the Indian
left-leaning academia detests the Vedas and Vedanta. And therefore studying
sanskrit which is the language of the Veda, is anathema for them.
