Namaste.

In continuation to my last statement in the previous post, dream and
rope-serpent like creations are pariNAma of avidyA no doubt, kAraNa-kArya
only. But each and every creation therein is a direct transformation of
avidyA, without any sequential or followup transformation from one creation
to another. That is the distinction from the vyAvahArika state creation.
