If I understand you right, these are examples where the kAraNam belongs to
a lower order of reality than kArya. This is one type. Another example you
mentioned - it also accounts for the non-sublatability of GYAnam.

In the case of pot and clay they are samAna-sattAka. This is the usual type
- different from the earlier one.

In the third type of cases where the kAraNam is a vivartopadAna kAraNam.
There, the kAraNam (rope) belongs to a higher order of reality while the
kArya (snake) belongs to a lower order of reality. This is the third
variety.

So can we conclude that all three possibilities are there.
