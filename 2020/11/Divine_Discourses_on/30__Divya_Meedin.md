A special feature of this book is the inclusion of 6 holy speeches
delivered by His Holiness Jagadguru Srimad Abhinava Vidyatirtha
Mahaswamigal, that provide the most authoritative account of His Guruâ€™s
(Jagadguru Sri Chandrashekhara Bharathi Mahaswamigal) life and
achievements. They also give a thorough account of the nature and role of a
Sadguru, a knower of the Truth; all that a spiritual aspirant needs to know
about a Sadguru is contained in this book.
