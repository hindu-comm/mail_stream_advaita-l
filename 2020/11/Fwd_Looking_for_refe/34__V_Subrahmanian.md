Namaste

The following shloka is cited by Shankaracharya in the Prose section of the
Upadesha saahasri as:

 तथाचोक्तम् -

रूपसंस्कारतुल्याधी रागद्वेषौ भयं च यत्।
 गृह्यते धीश्रयं तस्माज् ज्ञाता शुद्धोऽभयः सदा॥

This shloka also appears in the 15th chapter of the metrical part of the
same text.

One is curious about the text Shankara is citing this verse from.  Any help
is welcome.

Thanks
