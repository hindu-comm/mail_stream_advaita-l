 Dear Sri Mahadevan,
Vedanta offers a solution to all the psychological problems.In the mantra Chapter 7 of Chandogya upanishad chapter1 
mantra 3 gives the solution to the problem. 
There it says tarati SOkaM Atmavit||The meaning of the above quoted mantra is 
"One who realzes his true svarUpa / AtmasvarUpa transcends sorrow".The psychological problems can never be resolved at its own level.The level at which all the psychological problems will permanently end 
has been revealed by the above quoted mantra.Please try this medicine as advocated by Upanishad sages.
With warm regards 
Sreenivasa Murthy

 Pranams,

Immense gratitude from the bottom of my heart to everyone who responded to
my query.

Thank you, Venkatesh Murthy Ji, Indeed "Sadhana Chatushtayam" is essential,
I did assume that I had all the prerequisites before delving into Vedanta.
I understand the lack of Vairagyam causes Mental distress.

Thank you, H S Chandramouli ji, Accepting the intricate nature of paapam &
punyam & developing contentment through that understanding is the key.

Thank You, Divya Meedin ji, for providing the helpful poster. Chanting,
Prayers & Acceptance helps.

Thank You, Kartik Vashishta ji. I had not been thorough with my Gita
learning. Thank you for suggesting Arjuna Vishada Yogam.

Thank You, Sivakumar ji & Murali ji, for suggesting " Durvasana
pratheekara shathakam ". I was not aware of it.

Thank You S K Jayakumar Ji, for your kind words.

Pranams,
Mahadevan
