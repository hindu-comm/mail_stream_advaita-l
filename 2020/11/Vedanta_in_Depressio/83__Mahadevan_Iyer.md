Despite learning & rationalizing Vedanta for many years, at times when I
face the anxieties & shortcomings of Life, I forget all Vedantic knowledge
& get severely depressed. At times I even question Vedanta. Have anyone
faced something like this? Have anyone found perpetual peace?

pranams,
Mahadevan
