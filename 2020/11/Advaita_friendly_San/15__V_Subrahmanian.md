Here in the first cited link, there is the line  हृत्पुण्डरीकं विरजं विशोकं
विशदम्परम् ।।


 we see an upabrhmanam, annotation, of the Kaivalyopanishat:



हृत्पुण्डरीकं विरजं विशुद्धं विचिन्त्य मध्ये विशदं विशोकम् ।
अचिन्त्यमव्यक्तमनन्तरूपं शिवं प्रशान्तममृतं ब्रह्मयोनिम् ॥ ६॥


One may compare this with the following:


Refuting Appayya Dikshita’s claim that the Upanishad hails Shiva as
Parabrahman, Vijayendra Tirtha first explains that the preceding mantra
refers to nArAyaNa in the cave of the heart:
hR^itpuNDarIkaM virajaM vishuddhaM vichintya madhye vishadaM vishokam.h
achintyamavyaktamanantarUpaM shivaM prashAntamamR^itaM brahmayonim.h
Meaning (According to ShrI Vijayendra): The Lord described in the
Upanishads, in the heart (hRit punDarIkaM), devoid of rajas (virAja),
removed from tamas (vishuddhaM), to be thought of  (vichintya) as prior to
meditation on the object of contemplation and after saluting the guru,
hence the middle (madhyE), clear to the devotees (vishadaM), free from
grief due to rajas and tamas (vishokaM), the inconceivable (achintyaM),
unmanifest to the ignorant (avyaktaM), unlimited form (anantarUpaM), most
auspicious (shivaM), bestowing grace and anger depending on the action
(prashAntaM), whose form is the Supreme Goal of Attainment (amRtaM), the
Cause of the four-faced Brahma (brahmayOniM).
ShrI VijayEndra says that this is a description of nArAyaNa owing to the
adjectives of supremacy.
