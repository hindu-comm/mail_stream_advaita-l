It is a money making scheme only. The priests want to earn some money.
The doctors also want to make money to prescribe medicines when there is no
infection.
When there is real Grahana some people don't follow any rules in taking
food and drinks.
That is the one extreme.  Following Grahana rules when there is no Grahana
is the other extreme.
