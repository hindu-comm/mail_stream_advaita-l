Few months ago, Veda Dharma Sasthra Paripalana Sabha had a sadas on 
solar eclipse and its observance. It was followed up with another talk 
on details on how to observe. It was very useful.

In that context, I learned that the Vedic tradition only considers 
umbral eclipses and penumbral portion *does not count*. Even for start 
and end times, only the eclipse caused by umbra is counted.  In 
addition, traditional panchangas does not even mention an eclipse that 
is totally penumbral.

Why is that (some) temples in the  US observe totally penumbral eclipses 
and do grahaNa shanti etc.? It is like taking antibiotics even though 
you have no bacterial infection. Please correct me if I am wrong. I feel 
some of the things like doing pitR tarpaNa etc. during that time may not 
even be warranted.

Is my understanding wrong?

Thank you.
Ravi
