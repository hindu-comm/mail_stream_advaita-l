Namaste to all.

While thanking   Sri Subrahmanian for reaching the message to the group, , I  would like to add an  important information  before the same is circulated to others, other groups  AND Institutes.

With the grace of God, blessings of my Gurus and good wishes of many,  I am  glad that    Swami Vivekananda Yoga Anusandhana Samsthana (SVYASA) have arranged the on-line  course thru (live) classes at the scheduled timing and also the RECORDED  SESSIONS   SHALL BE MADE AVAILABLE  to registered participants.

?For any clarification on the subject, please  call me.

Regards,
S K Jayakumar (Mobile : 9916494729)

Sri Jayakumar, member of Advaita l, is known to me for the past several years. He has distinguished himself as a remarkable teacher of Yoga, Bhagavadgita and many topics/subjects aimed at self-development.  Despite his visual disability his enthusiasm in all fields of life is an inspiration to many.

He is now doing a course online in association with the Yoga University S-VYASA, Bangalore.  Pl. see the flyer in the attachment for details.

The message may be passed on to other groups/institutions.

Pl. access the flyer here:

subbu
