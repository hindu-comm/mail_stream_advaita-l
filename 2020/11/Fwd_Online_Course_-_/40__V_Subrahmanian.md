Sri Jayakumar, member of Advaita l, is known to me for the past several
years. He has distinguished himself as a remarkable teacher of Yoga,
Bhagavadgita and many topics/subjects aimed at self-development.  Despite
his visual disability his enthusiasm in all fields of life is an
inspiration to many.

He is now doing a course online in association with the Yoga University
S-VYASA, Bangalore.  Pl. see the flyer in the attachment for details.

The message may be passed on to other groups/institutions.

Pl. access the flyer here:
