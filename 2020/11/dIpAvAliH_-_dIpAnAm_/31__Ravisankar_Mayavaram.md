I put together some notes quickly based on a bunch of videos from Veda 
Dharma Paripalana Sabha. You should be able to view this document. 
Created in a hurry (as it is already trayodashI in the US and will make 
it complete by next year :-). We have discussed things like yama-tarpaNa 
in our list before. All the 10+ audio/video links are all in Tamil.
