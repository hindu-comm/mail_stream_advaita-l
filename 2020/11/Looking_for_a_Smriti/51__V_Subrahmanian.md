I chanced to see a verse in the Kurmapuranam Part 2, Chapter 31

विद्यासहायो भगवान् यस्यासौ मण्डलान्तरम् ।  हिरण्यगर्भपुत्रोऽसावीश्वरो
दृश्यते परः ॥३१.४१॥


This comes very close to the context which is about Shiva and Uma.
Shankara has quite often cited a shruti/smriti passage not verbatim but
condensing the meaning. This latter is called 'arthataH anuvaadah' as
opposed to the former 'shabdataH anuvaadaH'.  The words 'vidyasahaaya'
'bhagavaan' and 'Ishvara' in the Kurma Purana verse seems matching the
words of Shankara: vidyasahaaya-vaan-IshwaraH'.
