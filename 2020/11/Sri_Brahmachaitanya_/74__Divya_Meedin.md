Difference between Baddha and Mukta

The baddha is of the world, tied down to its pleasures and pains, whereas
the mukta is free of them, and God is the only reality for him. Saints
completely dissociate themselves from the body; people ask, not about their
progenitors, but about the guru, the upasana. They are, for all practical
purposes unaware of the body; its awareness, ego, is all merged in God. The
baddha takes far more interest in the pleasures, the happenings, and
condition of the body and material existence; a lessening of such interest
indicates progress in the direction of absolvement; this becomes complete
when God becomes the sole reality.
We are baddha today because we take ourselves to be so; we identify
ourselves with this body, whereas we are, in fact, a part of the Basic
Reality. Consequently, the pleasures and pains of the body persecute us,
and are felt by us as real. The soul, actually, is unaffected, detached. We
take the soul and body both as ‘ourselves’, although we say ‘my’ arm is
aching or ‘my’ stomach is upset. Tacitly, therefore, we admit that we are
not the organs or their assemblage which we call the body, and the ‘owner’
or the ‘soul’ is different from, independent, of the body.
Our mind takes joy in sensual pleasures, so we have a soft corner for them.
But these pleasures being transitory, the joy, too, lasts only a short
while. Discontent also arises from dependence on other persons or things.
We should, therefore, never forget the true nature of our’ selves’.
This detachedness can only come from true devotion to God. An obstruction
to this comes from the ‘body-am-I’ conviction, which must first be ousted
from the mind. So let us ever carry the feeling that we belong to God, and
that whatever happens is by God’s will; this will gradually erode the
‘body-am-I’ belief. This does not call for penance, sacrifices, and such
other austerities, nor for relinquishing family life and retiring to the
forest, or any such other cumbersome and strenuous performance. Abandon all
doership, say you belong to God, and be happy and contented; this will
gradually attenuate the ego. Just as the ‘body-am-I’ conviction
consolidated itself into identity with the body, we shall recover our true
identity with the Ultimate Reality by repeating that we come from God.
