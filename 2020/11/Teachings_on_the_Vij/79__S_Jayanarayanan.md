RAJAPALAYAM: APR 4-14, 2017
Sharadamba Temple Kumbhabhishekam
ARRIVAL AT RAJAPALAYAM

The arrival of the Sringeri Jagadgurus, Jagadguru Shankaracharya Sri Sri Bharati Tirtha Mahasannidhanam and
Jagadguru Sri Sri Vidhushekhara Bharati Sannidhanam at Rajapalayam infused great joy in the devotees of Rajapalayam.
Upon reaching Rajapalayam in the evening of April 4, 2017, the Jagadgurus were accorded a grand welcome.
Sri Sannidhanam was then led in a grand procession. After arrival at the Rama Mandiram building, Dhuli Pada Puja
was performed by Guru Bhakta Mani Sri PR Ramasubrahmaneya Rajha and family. After Veda Ghosha and a prayer,
Swagata Patrikas in Sanskrit and Tamil were read by Vidwan Mani Dravida Shastri. Sri PR Ramasubrahmaneya Rajha
speaking on the occasion devotedly welcomed the Jagadgurus.

Sri Sannidhanam in His Anugraha Bhashanam pointed out that for success in all rightful endeavours, man needs the
guidance of a Guru. Devotion to the Guru fetches us all welfare. Sri Sannidhanam explained this with the illustration
of the Guru Bhakti of Sri Rama and Sri Lakshmana towards Sage Vishwamitra.  

SRI MAHASANNIDHANAM’s ANUGRAHA BHASHANAM

Goddess Sharadamba
Sri Mahasannidhanam in His Anugraha Bhashanam said that while it is the same Divine Mother who blesses us with
wealth and prosperity (as Goddess Lakshmi), with knowledge (as Goddess Sharada) and with victory over opposing
forces (as Goddess Durga), the pursuit of knowledge is of paramount importance because विद्याधनं सर्वधनप्रधानम् –
the wealth of knowledge bestows all. Hence it is necessary for all to do the Upasana of Goddess Sharada,
the bestower of knowledge. After Sri Adi Shankaracharya consecrated Sri Sharadamba and established the
Dakshinamnaya Peetham at Sringeri, the successor Acharyas have also consecrated Goddess Sharadamba in various
places in order to facilitate people living there to perform Upasana of the Goddess.

GRAND KUMBHABHISHEKAM OF THE SHARADAMBA TEMPLE

[..]

Kumbhabhishekam
At about 8:30 am on April 9, 2017, Sri Mahasannidhanam and Sri Sannidhanam first offered Pushpa to the Vigraha
of Jagadguru Sri Abhinava Vidyatirtha Mahaswamiji in the Pathashala premises. From there, the Jagadgurus arrived
at the temple of Goddess Sharadamba. After invoking the Grace of Goddess Sharadamba, the Navagrahas and His Guru
(Jagadguru Sri Abhinava Vidyatirtha Mahaswamiji), Sri Mahasannidhanam along with Sri Sannidhanam entered the
Garbha Griha of Goddess Sharadamba. Sri Mahasannidhanam then performed the Prathishta Kumbhabhisheka of
Goddess Sharadamba. Sri Mahasannidhanam and Sri Sannidhanam also performed the Prathishta Kumbhabhisheka at the
shrines of Sri Rajaganapati and Sri Adi Shankaracharya. Thereafter the Jagadgurus performed the Kumbhabhishekas
of the Vimana Shikhara and the Rajagopuram.

The Temple Architecture

The architecture of the temple, with the front Gopuram and the large Praakaara inside, has been designed so as to
resemble the Sharadamba temple at Sringeri. A large Mandapam, an Ardha Mandapam and then the Garbha Griha,
all in granite, exist inside the temple that houses the beautiful Panchaloha Vigraha of Goddess Sharadamba.
Beautiful sculptures of Sri Rajarajeshwari, Goddess Sharadamba, Sri Mahasannidhanam and Sri Sannidhanam adorn
the outer top of the side doors.

PUBLIC FUNCTION AFTER THE KUMBHABHISHEKAM

In the evening, a public function was organized as part of the Kumbhabhisheka. Guru Bhakta Mani Sri PR Subrahmaneya Rajha
submitted a citation to Sri Mahasannidhanam offering the temple to the Sringeri Math.  

At the request of the organisers of Rajapalayam, Sringeri Math CEO Gowrishankar released a biography of Guru Bhakta Mani
Sri PR Subrahmaneya Rajha penned in Tamil. Speaking on the occasion, Sri Gowrishankar said that Rajha and his family
belong to that rare category who have been born with material, cultural and spiritual wealth, and have taken efforts to
nurture and improve what they have received from their ancestors. Sri Gowrishankar spoke at length over Sri Rajha’s
philanthropism, humility, support for Vedic education and learning, and Guru Bhakti.

Sri PR Ramasubrahmaneya Rajha then explained how he has experienced the Grace of the Guru at various junctures in his life.
He also spoke on the importance of Guru Bhakti.

Sri Mahasannidhanam then released a Sanskrit book (with Tamil translation) on His Paramaguru,
Jagadguru Sri Chandrashekhara Bharati Mahaswamiji. The book contains a poetic work titled “Jagadguru Charitramritam”
penned by Sri Bhashya Swamigal and first published in 1963. The reprint has been brought out by the Lingammal Raju Trust
in Rajapalayam and was offered with Pranams by Smt. Sudarsanam Ramasubrahmaneya Rajha.

Sri Sannidhanam’s Anugraha Bhashanam
Offering Actions Unto The Lord

Sri Sannidhanam began His Anugraha Bhashanam by quoting the Gita verse –

  यत्करोषि यदश्नासि यज्जुहोषि ददासि यत् ।
  यत्तपस्यसि कौन्तेय तत्कुरुष्व मदर्पणम् ॥

Whatever you do, whatever you eat, whatever you offer as a sacrifice, whatever you give away, whatever penance you do,
offer it to Me.

Some immediately question “What do I get if I offer everything to the Lord?”. Even in the worldly sense, when a citizen
having a precious item in his possession offers it to the ruler of the land, he gets rewarded. Likewise, offering unto
the Lord fetches us many fold benefits in the path of welfare. Our offering does not bring about any change for the Lord.
It is for our own Shreyas that we offer all unto the Lord.

Sri Sannidhanam then commended Sri Rajha for having built the beautiful temple for Goddess Sharadamba. He mentioned that
it was divine Sankalpa that Sri Mahasannidhanam had performed the Kumbhabhisheka for the Goddess Sharadamba at Sringeri
(in February) and had then come to perform the Kumbhabhisheka to Goddess Sharadamba at Rajapalayam.

Sri Mahasannidhanam’s Anugraha Bhashanam
Dharma Shraddha

Sri Mahasannidhanam in His Anugraha Bhashanam stressed the importance of Astikyam – faith in the Vedas, in God, in the
law of Karma, the existence of other worlds, Punarjanma and in Dharmic conduct. Sri Mahasannidhanam said that it is important
for us to pray that our Shraddha in Dharma increases. When Shraddha increases, we engage in noble deeds that benefit all
around us.

Our Guru Bhakta Mani

Sri Mahasannidhanam then praised the Dharmic bent of mind and Sattvic tendency of Guru Bhakta Mani Sri PR Subrahmaneya Rajha.
In constructing the magnificent temple for Goddess Sharada and offering it to the Sringeri Sharada Peetham, Sri Rajha has
practised the tenet of the Gita that one must engage in actions without any selfish inclinations — “कर्मण्येवाधिकारस्ते मा फलेषु कदाचन”.  

Sri Mahasannidhanam then praised the devotion of Sri Rajha towards His Guru, Jagadguru Sri Abhinava Vidyatirtha Mahaswamiji.
Sri Mahasannidhanam remembered the contribution of Sri Rajha towards the installation of the Murti of His Guru in the
Adhishtanam at Sringeri and his offering of a garland of 108 silver coins containing the names of His Guru’s Ashtottara
Shata Namavali. Sri Rajha has also installed Murtis of Jagadguru Sri Abhinava Vidyatirtha Mahaswamiji in the Pathashala
in Rajapalayam and in his house named “Abhinava Vidyatirtha Kripa” at Sringeri.  

Sri Mahasannidhanam said that He had received the Prerana from Goddess Sharadamba to go on a Vijaya Yatra to conduct the
Kumbhabhisheka at Rajapalayam, and had accordingly commenced the Vijaya Yatra. Sri Mahasannidhanam then blessed Guru Bhakta Mani
Sri PR Subrahmaneya Rajha and his son Sri PR Venketarama Raja, with the CEO, Sri Gowrishankar, honouring them.
The event ended with Sri Ramasubrahmaneya Raja offering his heartfelt gratitude on the occasion and attributing everything to
the Grace of the Sringeri Jagadgurus.

At night, Sri Sannidhanam conducted the Rathotsava of Goddess Sharadamba in the temple.

SPECIAL ANUGRAHA BHASHANAM

On April 13, 2017, Sri Mahasannidhanam blessed the devotees of Rajapalayam with a special Anugraha Bhashanam. Sri Mahasannidhanam
explained that having had the fortune of having taken birth as a human being, the human body is to be utilised as a boat to
cross the ocean of Samsara that is filled with sufferings of all kinds. i.e. one has to engage in Dharmic actions,
purification of the mind, service to the Guru and the study and practice of Vedantic tenets, culminating in Atma Jnana –
Self-knowledge. Before the Anugraha Bhashanam, Swami Omkarananda spoke on the topic – “Acharya-upasanam” describing the
greatness of the Guru. After Sri Mahasnnidhanam’s Anugraha Bhashanam, Sri Sannidhanam blessed the teachers and students of
the Pathashala and also examined advanced Vidyarthis of the Pathashala.

PHOTO EXHIBITION ON THE 35TH ACHARYA INAUGURATED

As part of the Birth Centenary Celebrations of Jagadguru Sri Abhinava Vidyatirtha Mahaswamiji, the 35th Acharya of the
Sringeri Sharada Peetham, Sri Vidyatheertha Foundation of Chennai organised a Photo Exhibition titled “Pictures of Perfection”.
The exhibition was inaugurated by Sri Sannidhanam on April 6, 2017 in the TTD Kalyana Mandapam complex in Rajapalayam.
Sri Sannidhanam spent about an hour going through the photo exhibits depicting the early life of the Acharya, His Sadhana,
His Vijaya Yatras across India, temple consecrations, and His many initiatives undertaken for the sustenance and propagation
of Sanatana Dharma.

In the public function organised in the premises, Sri H Raja, National Secretary of the Bharatiya Janata Party, spoke on the
greatness of the Sringeri Sharada Peetham and the life of the 35th Acharya. Sri Sannidhanam in His Anugraha Bhashanam extolled
the qualities of His Paramaguru. Dignitaries including Sri H Raja and Guru Bhakta Mani Sri PR Ramasubrahmaneya Raja were
felicitated on the occasion.  

The following evening, Sri Mahasannidhanam graced the photo exhibition and walked through the various booths admiring and
relishing the depiction of the life of His Guru.

Residents of Rajapalayam as well as devotees visiting Rajapalayam visited the exhibition in good numbers. The exhibition
concluded on April 10, 2017.

Thereafter, the Jagadgurus arrived at Srivilliputtur and had Darshan at the shrine of Sri Adi Shankaracharya in the
Sringeri Shankara Math in Srivilliputtur. In His Anugraha Bhashanam, Sri Mahasannidhanam hailed the Kshetram of Srivilliputtur,
famous for the woman saint, Goda Devi or Andal, and blessed the assembled devotees.
