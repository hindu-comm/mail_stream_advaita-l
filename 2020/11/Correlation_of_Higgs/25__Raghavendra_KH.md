Friends,

According to physicist the Higgs boson which is lending existence in terms
of mass to the matter. without Higgs boson there is no mass of matter i.e
no existence. The physicists have discovered that : in the first 1/4th of
second after the big bang event, the material created didn't have mass. The
mass or existence is bestowed by Higgs boson also called God particle.
Are there any correlation attempts to speculatively equate Higgs boson to
सत् (Sat or Pure Existence) principle of Brahman ?

I am thinking aloud here, perhaps the experts in this forum could comment.

Raghavendra
