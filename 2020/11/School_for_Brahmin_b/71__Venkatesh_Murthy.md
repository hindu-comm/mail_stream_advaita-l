*School for Brahmin Boys*
ðŸŽˆ All expenses paid institution

*Important message for Brahmin parents:*

Kanchi Math has started a Veda cum regular school in *Ullal near Bangalore
University*. All castes are admitted here for CBSE system of regular 10+2
schooling. But Brahmin boys are given Veda class from 6 to 7 AM and 6:30 to
8 PM (approx times). This is in addition to regular schooling. They are
also provided with a 400 seat hostel with full Brahman food.

But one of the organisers of this institution in Kanchi Math was telling
that they can find monetary resources but are finding it difficult to get
Brahmin boys to join this all expenses paid institution! Now only 100 seats
are occupied in the hostel and 300 are vacant. He was requesting all
Brahmin families to utilize this opportunity and school.

As the boys lose nothing and gain Vedic knowledge along with regular
knowledge, this is the best place for them. They have got excellent class
rooms, labs, play grounds etc of very high standard. This is suitable for
every type of Brahmin family irrespective of rich, middle class or poor!
The decision of higher studies -if in Veda line or Science , Engg or
Medicine etc can be done after 12th standard.
