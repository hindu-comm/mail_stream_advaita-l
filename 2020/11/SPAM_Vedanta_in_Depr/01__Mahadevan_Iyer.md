Pranams,

Immense gratitude from the bottom of my hearts to everyone who responded to
my query.

Thank you, Venkatesh Murthy Ji, Indeed "Sadhana Chatushtayam" is essential,
I did assume that I had all the prerequisites before delving into Vedanta.
I understand the lack of Vairagyam causes Mental distress.

Thank you, H S Chandramouli ji, Accepting the intricate nature of paapam &
punyam & developing contentment through that understanding is the key.

Thank You, Divya Meedin ji, for providing

. Chanting, Prayers & Acceptance provides peaceful life.

Thank You, Kartik Vashishta Ji. I had not been thorough with my Gita
learning. Thank you for suggesting Arjuna Vishada Yogam (

Thank You, Sivakumar Ji & Murali Ji, for suggesting  "DurvAsanA pratheekara
sathakam" of Sri Vidyaranya.  I was not aware of it.

Thank You S K Jayakumar Ji, for your kind words.

Thank you & my deepest gratitude.

Mahadevan
