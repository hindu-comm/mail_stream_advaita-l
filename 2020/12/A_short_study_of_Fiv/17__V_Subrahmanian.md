This is a 13 page article in Kannada with citations from the Garuda
Purana's five chapters that are full of Advaitic teaching. Shankara's
bhashya quotes too are given.  Even those without Kannada knowledge can
read the article by confining to the Sanskrit Devanagari verses and the
Bhashya passages.
