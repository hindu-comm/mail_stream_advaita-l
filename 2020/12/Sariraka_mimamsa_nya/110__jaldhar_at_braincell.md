I don't think it concerns logic per se.  It is a compendium of summaries 
of the nyayas or adhikaranas in Sharirakabhashya similiar to the much more 
widely-known Vaiyasika Nyayamala of Madhavacharya.  As such as far as I 
can ascertain it has not been published separately but included in some 
editions of the Brahmasutrabhashya.

Probably the most accessible one (though long since out of print) is 
edited by Shri N.S. Anantakrishna Shastri in Calcutta Sanskrit Series Vol. 
1.  (University of Calcutta, Calcutta 1941.)

Prakashatma Muni did write another work called Shabdanirnaya along with 
vrtti which deals with aspects of logic, specifically Shabdapramana.  He 
expands on arguments made in his Vivarana and defends the Advaita view 
against primararily Mimamsakas.
