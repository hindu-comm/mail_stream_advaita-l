Namaskarams,

I've been looking for a book called "Sariraka mimamsa nyaya sangraha"
preferably in English or at least the original Sanskrit version. It's
written by prakashatma muni widely known as vivaranacharya.
This work said to be a classic that deals with explaining the brahma sutram
with nyaya (logic) in accordance with Adi shankaracharya's siddhanta.

Its a treasure. So, can some one help me find this book.

Thanks and Regards,
Venkat.
