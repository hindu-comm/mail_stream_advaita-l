Namasthe Sarvebhya:
I just wanted to bring it to your attention a series of talks going on by
Sri S R Anatha Murthy in Kannada language on Katopanishat Shankara Bhashya.
He is beautifully explaining the bhashya  in a series of talks twice a
week. You can follow him on you tube at this link:

Thanks
Indira Sastry
