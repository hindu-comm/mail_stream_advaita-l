 Dear Sri Akilesh Ayyar,
In one small single line sri Shankara defines what Moksha is.It reads thus :nityatvAt mOkshasya sAdhakasvarUpAvyatirEkAcca ||
The above truth has to be cognized within oneselfby oneself.It is so easy.Cognize your true svarUpa as is.The whole thing is over.
Sri Bhagavan Ramana says:
StepsIn Self-Realisation



I.Everyoneis the Self by his own experience. 

 Stillhe is not aware, he identifies the Self with the 

 bodyand feels miserable. 

This is the greatest of all mysteries. 

ONE IS THE SELF. 

Why not abide as the Self and be done withmiseries? 



II.Methodology
 Inthe beginning one has to be told that he is not the body, 
 because he thinksthat he is the body only. 
Whereas he is the body and all else. The body isonly a part. 

 Let him know it finally. 

He must first discern Consciousness frominsentience and be the Consciousness only. Later let him realize that insentience is not apart fromconsciousness. 

III.This is discrimination(vivEka).The intial discrimination must persist to the end. THE FRUIT IS LIBERATION.
 [TWR; 192]Please keep things simple.

With warm regards,Sreenivasa Murthy

Enlightenment is a contradictory idea because it stands on the border of
thought and non-thought. It is the exit from thought, but in that exit from
thought there is the recognition that the very idea of 'exit' was itself a
thought, and thus that there was never any exit, because there was never
any entrance. The insight destroys itself. And yet enlightenment can also
be viewed usefully as a series of these very recognitions. The mental
habits that chain one in thought, to the belief that one is a doing,
experiencing, decision-making person... one attempts to light these on fire
through self-inquiry and surrender. When in fact the habits are 'dry
enough' -- meaning weak enough -- to 'catch fire' once and for all, they
result in enlightenments so continuous they cannot be called enlightenments
at all.
