Enlightenment is a contradictory idea because it stands on the border of
thought and non-thought. It is the exit from thought, but in that exit from
thought there is the recognition that the very idea of 'exit' was itself a
thought, and thus that there was never any exit, because there was never
any entrance. The insight destroys itself. And yet enlightenment can also
be viewed usefully as a series of these very recognitions. The mental
habits that chain one in thought, to the belief that one is a doing,
experiencing, decision-making person... one attempts to light these on fire
through self-inquiry and surrender. When in fact the habits are 'dry
enough' -- meaning weak enough -- to 'catch fire' once and for all, they
result in enlightenments so continuous they cannot be called enlightenments
at all.
