OM NAMAH SIVANANDAYA

Revered Self,

Sadar Pranam,

I wish you all comfort and peace and all the good wishes possible for the
new year.

I am trying to find blessed Sri Sridhar ji's commentary on the blessed
Srimad Bhagvad Gita.

I have found a book by this title:
"Srimad Bhagavad-Gita: Text, Translation of the Text and of the Gloss of
Sridhara Swami."

I am not sure about the word "Gloss". Is this title indeed the book which
has the commentary of blessed Sri Sridhar ji on the most beneficial Srimad
Bhagvadgita?

Please let me know, I'll be grateful.

Pranam,

OM
Kartik Vashishta
