Gloss is the usual English translation for tika.  The actual name of the 
commentary is Subodhini but it is popularly known as Shridhari tika.

Yes it is an independent commentary on the Bhagavadgita.  But in the 
mangala shlokas he says:

bhAShyakAramataM samyaktadvyAkhyAtR^itirastathA |
yathAmati samAlokya gItAvyAkhyAM samArabhe ||

It is also interesting to note that although his personal inclination was 
towards Vishnu Bhagavan (his other works are his celebrated commentary on 
Bhagavata Purana and a commentary on Vishnu Purana) he salutes both Vishnu 
Bhagavan and Shiva Bhagavan.

This clearly shows the author was an Advaitin.
