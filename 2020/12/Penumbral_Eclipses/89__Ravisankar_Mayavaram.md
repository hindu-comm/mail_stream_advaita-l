I don't think it is about money. These are very service oriented, noble, 
and non-profit organizations. They greatly enrich the value of hindus in 
those areas. In most of these cases, they follow the panchanga computed 
by mypanchang etc.

My intention of asking that question is to understand if there are any 
scriptures that support the observation of penumbral eclipses.
