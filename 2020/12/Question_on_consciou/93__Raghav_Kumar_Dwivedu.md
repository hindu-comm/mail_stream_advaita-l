Going along with your idea -
If you are able to appreciate the above which you wrote, then you could now
examine the idea that -

If table, chair, etc are all in essence consciousness, where would you draw
a boundary in consciousness? As a matter of fact, there are no boundaries
that can be drawn in consciousness. Drawing a boundary would need two
things one whose "essence is consciousness" and another whose essence is
different. But that is not the case since, as you wrote, consciousness is
the essence of *everything*. Once there are no boundaries, that implies,
there is just ONE.
