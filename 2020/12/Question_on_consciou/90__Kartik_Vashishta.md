OM NAMAH SIVANANDAYA

Revered Self,

Sadar Pranam,

I am in doubt about consciousness.....

How is consciousness universal and the ONLY thing?

I can understand that every table/chair/river/mountain is consciousness in
its essence, I am however not able to logically believe that it is all the
same "universal"(for lack of a better word) consciousness.

My question is, how do we conclude that everything is ONE consciousness(in
its essence)? I am tending to think of every entity having it's
LOCALIZED(IT'S OWN) consciousness.....

I apologize for making demands on your time. Please respond if not
inconvenient to you.

Pranam,

OM
