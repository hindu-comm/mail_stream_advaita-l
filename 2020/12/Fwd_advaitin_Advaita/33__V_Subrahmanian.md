Subject: [advaitin] Advaita Sadhana in Pictures
To: advaitin <advaitin at googlegroups.com>


Might be helpful to some of the novices here.  A very good document with
pictorial representation of Advaita sadhana was forwarded to me recently.

This may not be accurate representation.  However, I found this quite
helpful. We need more of these, to make Advaita Sadhana easily
understandable, with help of modern tools.

(Authors unknown. Sharing  it, with thanks to the Unknown authors).
