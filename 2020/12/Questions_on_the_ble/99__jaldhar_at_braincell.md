That mantra, dravya, and tyaga are the three components of a yaga (or 
specifically one ahuti in a yaga or homa) is one of those "everyone knows" 
kind of things so I was hard put to find an actual statement to that 
effect.  But a bit of googling led to Swami Madhusudana Saraswati in 
Gudarthadipika on Bhagavadgita 4.24:

devatoddeshena hi dravyatyAgo yAgaH |

"yAga is defined as relinquishing material accompanied by a call to a 
devatA."

The Gita shloka itself shows how Brahman is the foundation of all the 
aspects of the yagna.
