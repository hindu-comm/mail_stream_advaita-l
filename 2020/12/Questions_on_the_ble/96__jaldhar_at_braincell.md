Yes I agree.  In Brhadaranyakopanishad II.4.1.5 Maharshi Yajnavalkya 
explains to his wife that even basic human attachments such as love of a 
wife for her husband are due to and grounded in love of atma.  So it 
the hallmark of a  sadhaka is that he can truly feel joy in the joys of others.

There have been sociological studies which note that heavy users of social 
media on the Internet tend to be have more negative emotions such as 
depression or jealousy than the average person.  It is because Facebook, 
Instagram etc, present a distorted picture of the true state of other 
peoples lives.  Some look at this and think "everyone has more or is 
happier than me" and this breeds resentment.  Of course it is not the only
reason but I do believe this is one of the main reasons that modern man 
feels more discontent than his ancestors despite having more material 
wealth than they could have dreamed of.  Dharma gives a much needed 
correction to distorted perspectives.
