Some commentators note that, unusually, Ishopanishad is in the samhita 
portion of its shakha (it is the 40th adhyaya of Vajasaneyi Samhita of 
Shuklayajurveda) instead of the Brahmana so it is connected to karma in a 
way that other upanishads are not.

The term tyaga itself comes from karmakanda.  In a yajna, when the 
purohita recites a mantra and says e.g. agnaye svaha, "To Agni svaha!" the 
yajamana makes the offering and responds idam agnaye na mama "This is 
Agnis not mine."  This formula is called tyaga.  The big difference is 
that the karma tyaga is for a particular object and purpose while the 
Vedantic tyaga is universal.
