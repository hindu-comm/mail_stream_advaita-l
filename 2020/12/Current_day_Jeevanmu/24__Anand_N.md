Namaste,

We speak of Ramana , Ramakrishna or Chandrashekara Bharathi etc as
Jeevanmuktas. I was just wondering if there are any present day Jnanis who
are alive today who would fit this category.

I would be keen to visit such current day masters, be in their presence and
take their blessings.

I do understand that any listing of such Masters is subjective and no one
can categorically state or verify that someone is Jnani.

Om Namo Narayanaya,
Anand
