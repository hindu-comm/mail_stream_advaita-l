3.1.2 Evolution of the sattva aspect

Since all these five elements are born out
of mAyA which has three guNas, they should
also have the three guNas because the prop-
erties of the cause (kAraNam) should pervade
the effect (kAryam) also. So, within the subtle
Space itself, we have saatvik AkASa, rAjasik
AkASa and tAmasik AkASa, etc.

3.1.2.1 Sense Organs

aspect of AkASa, the organ of hearing, the ear,
evolved.

>From the saatvic aspect of Earth, the organ of
smell - the nose - evolved.

The five sense organs evolved from the sattva
aspect of the five elements. Every element
has an essential property (guNa - for example,
Water-taste) and the corresponding sense or-
gan evolved from it (namely, tongue in this
example). Similarly the property of Fire is form
and the organ of perception of form is the eye,
which evolved from it, and so on.

3.1.2.2 antahkaraNa (inner equipment)

>From the total saatvic aspect of these five ele-
ments, the antahkaraNa (innner equipment) com-
prising of manas, buddhi, ahamkAra and citta,
evolved.

Here two more parts are added to the list of
subtle bodies (sUkshma Sareeram) mentioned
earlier, which are ahamkAra and citta, thus
making a total of 19. That means 19 parts are
to be created from the subtle elements out of
which five organs of perception and four in-
ner equipment are created out of the saatvic
aspect, since the sense organs and the inner
instruments are related to knowledge. To sum-
marize, the sauna aspect is responsible for the
creation of the jnAnendriyas and the
antahkaraNas.
