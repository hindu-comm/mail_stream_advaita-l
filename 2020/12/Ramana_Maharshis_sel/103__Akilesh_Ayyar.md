Ramana Maharshi's simple self-inquiry instruction -- to attempt to chase
and locate the "I" -- may seem, at first glance, to be quite different from
the more scriptural and thinking-based instruction of traditional advaita
vedanta. But this difference is only on the surface. Both ultimately come
to exactly the same method from just slightly different angles: quiet the
mind and discern away the unchanging by investigating the "I" thought. By
doing so, the normal I disappears and an intuition is generated which
destroys ignorance. What is left is the Self, which was always there, but
simply was't recognized because of that ignorance.
