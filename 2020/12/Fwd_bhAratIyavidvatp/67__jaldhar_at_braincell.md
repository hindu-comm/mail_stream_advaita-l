Sorry for the late response.  FYI, the list of texts on that page is based
on the collection "The Complete Works of Shankaracharya" originally 
published by the Vani Vilas Press, Shrirangam.  It was compiled by a board
of scholars with the approbation of Shringeri Matha.  IMO, it is the 
closest thing we have to a "canonical" list of Shankaracharyas writings.
