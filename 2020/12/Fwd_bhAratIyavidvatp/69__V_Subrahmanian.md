Subject: {भारतीयविद्वत्परिषत्} Introduction to the new treatise of Advaita
Vedanta with the critical edition.
To: भारतीयविद्वत्परिषत् <bvparishat at googlegroups.com>


Respected scholars,
Recently, I was awarded the degree of Doctor of Philosophy for the research
titled as "A CRITICAL STUDY OF VEDĀNTASIDDHĀNTACANDRIKĀ WITH UDGĀRA". I
have critically edited the text with the commentary along with the
translation and sufficient notes. You can have an overview of the research
work by reading the attached pdf of the abstract.
I am planning to publish the thesis in the next year.
Before that I am interested in briefly introducing the treatise. Thus, I
have formed a 'Whatsapp group whose link is - Vedāntasiddhāntacandrikodgāra
<https://chat.whatsapp.com/DsubB3yQE2u7dwm9XxtCx5>. Herein, I will weekly
introduce the treatise. You are keenly requested to join the group by
giving suggestions, asking questions, etc.
You are warmly welcome in the group with your valuable opinions.

Yours sincerely,
Rohan Achyut Kulkarni,
Research Assistant,
BORI, Pune
