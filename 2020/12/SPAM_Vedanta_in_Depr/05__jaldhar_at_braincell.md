The lists.advaita-vedanta.org server usually does antispam and antivirus 
checking on every message that is sent to it.  (Sometimes there is a 
hiccup so you occasionally see ***UNCHECKED***) If your email software 
allows you to look at the message headers, you can see a number of lines 
dealing with the results of these checks.

In this case however that **SPAM** does not seem to have been added by our 
server it seems.
