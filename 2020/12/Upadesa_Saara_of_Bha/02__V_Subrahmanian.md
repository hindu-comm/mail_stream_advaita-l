This is a very lovely rendering of the deeply meaningful work 'Upadesa
Saara' of Bhagavan Ramana. The children have been very well trained by Sri
Kuldeep Pai. The diction in rendering, the text and the meaning are all
great additions to the Video. One of the significant additions to the world
of Vedanta in the year 2020, was the publication of the book ‘Upadesha
Saarah – Tattvabodhini’ by Ramana Maharshi Centre for Learning, Bengaluru.
The book was released by Sri Ramanacharanatirtha Nochur Venkataraman and
Sri V Ganesan, a few months ago.
‘Upadeśa Sāra’ is one of the most comprehensive works of Bhagavan. It
contains the entire teaching of the Vedas — karma, bhakti, upāsanā,
prāṇa-vidyā and jñāna.
This book, titled ‘Upadesha Saarah – The Essence of the Vedas’, includes
the Sanskrit treatise ‘Upadeśa Sāra’ of Bhagavan Ramana Maharshi, along
with Tattvabodhini, a Sanskrit commentary by Atmavidyabhushanam Sri
Jagadeeshwara Shastri, a great scholar of Vedanta and one of the foremost
disciples of Sri Ramana.
Sri G Kameshwar, a software architect by profession, has rendered the
Sanskrit Upadesha Saarah and commentary into English.
The book can be ordered online from www.eganesha.in
