Respected scholars,

    Recently, I was awarded the degree of Doctor of Philosophy for the
research titled as "A CRITICAL STUDY OF VEDĀNTASIDDHĀNTACANDRIKĀ WITH
UDGĀRA". I have critically edited the text with the commentary along with
the translation and sufficient notes. I am planning to publish the thesis
in the next year.
Before that I am interested in briefly introducing the treatise. Thus, I
have formed a 'Whatsapp group whose link is - Vedāntasiddhāntacandrikodgāra
<https://chat.whatsapp.com/DsubB3yQE2u7dwm9XxtCx5>. Herein, I will weekly
introduce the treatise. You are keenly requested to join the group by
giving suggestions, asking questions, etc.
You are warmly welcome in the group with your valuable opinions.

Yours sincerely,
Rohan Achyut Kulkarni,
Research Assistant,
BORI, Pune
