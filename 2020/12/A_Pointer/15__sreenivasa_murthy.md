Dear friends,
Here is a pointer:
"The Upaniṣadsrepeatedly instruct that the mind, intellect, 

is the locus where the Self is to be realized and 

the instrument to realize the Ātman is also the mind alone 

and that such a mind ought to be rendered 

extremely pure and subtle to accomplish this task." 

Purity of mind means unburdened byall kindsofconcepts i.e. a clean slate; in other words to examine the teachingwithout the background of the previously accumulated knowledge. 

With respectful namaskars,Sreenivasa Murthy
