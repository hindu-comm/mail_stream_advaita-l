Namaskaram.

Beginning tomorrow 16th Dec., 8 pm India time, every day during Margazhi
month, we will have a Zoom lecture by Mullaivasal Sastrigal on Gita.
Details are in the attached flyer.

We have often heard Periaval highlighting the significance of the '4G's -
Gita, Ganga, 'Go' (Cow} and Gayatri. HH would like all of us to listen to
and reflect and master Gita during danur masam this year.

The lectures will be highly focused. Sastrigal has picked 30 key messages
from Gita, essentially a set of sanatana dharma's 'do's and 'don't's, and
relevant to each message, chosen two or three slokas . Periaval has kindly
approved the selection. Mullaivasal will anchor his lectures around these
messages and slokas, and, of course, draw from Gita, Upanishads and
Tirukkural.

Periaval has kindly agreed to deliver an Anugraha Bhasan on the opening
day, i.e., 16th December, 2020.

Kindly attend.

Sundar
