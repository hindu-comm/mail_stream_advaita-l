Namaste,
The next chapter of the advaita siddhi, dRgdRshyasambandha bhaNga: (the
refutation of a real relationship between the seer and the seen) is
available here:

http://www.advaitasiddhi.com/blog/pariccheda-1-drgdrshya-sambandha-bhanga-part-1
http://www.advaitasiddhi.com/blog/pariccheda-1-drgdrshya-sambandha-bhanga-part-2
http://www.advaitasiddhi.com/blog/pariccheda-1-drgdrshya-sambandha-bhanga-part-3

This chapter provides the *anukUla tarka*, or supportive reasoning for the
inference of the world's *mithyAtva*.

The *anukUla tarka* or supportive reasoning given by the *advaitin* in this
chapter is that there is no real relationship possible between the seer and
the seen (objects) - despite this, the world is cognised. Therefore, it
follows that there is an *AdhyAsika sambandha*, an unreal relationship
between the seer and the world. Therefore, the world too is unreal.

Kind regards,
Venkatraghavan
