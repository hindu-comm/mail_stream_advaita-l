Namaste,

I have gone through the goals of the list and the other aspects mentioned 
in your email.

I am a Sanskrit scholar with traditional learning and have retired from a 
reputed Sanskrit institution in India and have many books and articles to 
my credit.  I shall be glad to participate in the discussions and 
contribute to scholarly discussions in my own little way.

   Thanking you

   D. Satyanarayana
