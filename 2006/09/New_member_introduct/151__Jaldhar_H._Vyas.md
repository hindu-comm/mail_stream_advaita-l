  Hello Sirs,

My name
  is Alvaro, I was born in Madrid, Spain, in
  1961.

I'm a seeker.I want
  be a honest seeker.In my firts ages, I looking
  for the answers, the questions of the life:
  Who am I?, What is this creation ? Who is
  his creator?

And now, advaita tradition
  is the direction. The unicity of reality
  is very simple, very profound. The knowledge
  of atman (atmavidya)and the knowledge of
  advaita vedanta.
