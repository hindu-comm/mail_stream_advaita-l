Yes, and that is precisely why I asked this question. Though
pUrvamImAMsa is a darSana in its own right, it is still an element of
traditional vedAntic study. So are nyAya, various aspects of pAtanjala
yoga, vedAnga-s like vyAkaraNa, etc

When I said that the question does not strictly pertain to
advaita-vedAnta, what I meant was that it is not the focus of the
upaniShad-s and the various commentatorial & prakaraNa texts in the
vedAntic tradition. Nevertheless, it has its relevance for vedAntic
study.

Also, for non-saMnyAsI-s, it is relevant as an element of the pravRtti mArga.
