Namaste dear all.

While Abhishek-jis queries were answered by Shree
Ramesh Ramanan Ji, I would like to further draw the
attention of the respected scholars to the most
beautiful Statement that was referred from the Vedas,

"One becomes immortal by *knowing* Him alone" :- 

Far from contradicting the Truth, samAdhi fulfills it
and this is further evidenced from the following
references from Shree Shankaracharyas works.

VC 408. The wise man realises in his heart, through
Samadhi, the Infinite Brahman, which is something of
the nature of eternal Knowledge and absolute Bliss,
which has no exemplar, which transcends all
limitations, is ever free and without activity, and
which is like the limitless sky, indivisible and 
absolute.

Shree Balu jis observations that
samAdhi is BEING that is effortless and
is not   BECOMING  that involves effort were a joy
to read.

Kind regards,
Raghava
