Add another from mAndukya:

"sa eva sarvam. yad bhUtva yat cha bhavyam. sanAtanam.
jnAtvA tam mR^ityumatyeti nAnyah panthah vimuktaye."

Mark the emphasis on knowing and nothing else.

Shankara has been charged in many cases(and not
without reason) for twisting out the convenient
meaning from vedic verses. This is obviously not one
of them.

With regards,
Ram Garib
