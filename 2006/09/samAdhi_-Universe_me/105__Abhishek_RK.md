Namaste,

>From your post, it appears that you are out to "disprove" the doctrine
of "tameva vidvAnamR^ita iha bhavati" of the vedas. One must
understand that piecing together a number of quotations and trying to
"prove" an alternate theory of advaita is just amusing, to put it
mildly.

Regards,
Abhishek
