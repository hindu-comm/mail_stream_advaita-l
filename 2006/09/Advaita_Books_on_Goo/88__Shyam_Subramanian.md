Some other books related to advaita (and sanskrit literature in general) 
are at
http://www.new.dli.ernet.in/ . It has the complete works of  the 
bhagavatpAda
(published by vanivilas press in 10 volumes- I couldn't find volume I 
and III here)
, Swami candraSekhara bhAratI's commentary on the vivekacUdAmaNI (in 
sanskrit,
not the translation), and a host of other books scanned from Sringeri 
and other places
in India. The major problem is that they are not downloadable in book
format but only page by page.

Regards,
Shyam
