Hari Om!

I would appreciate the opinions of the learned members here in the 
matter of selecting a nice translation (in English) of Sri 
Sankaracharya's Vedanta-bhashya.

I cannot find such an edition for purchase on Amazon or Abebooks (UK) 
sites. I would like to find such an edition on some site for easy ordering.

Does anybody know of any suitable translations and, if possible, 
recommend some notable translations of Sri Acharya's Brahmasutrabhashya 
for my learning?

Many thanks!

D. Jay
