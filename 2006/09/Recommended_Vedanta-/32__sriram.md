Dear members
I find Brahma Sutras by Swami Vireswaranda of Advaita Ashrama is very
faithful to Sri Sankara`s Bhashya and gives word by word meaning in
Samskrit -my teacher used to say Samskrit is the correct word and not
Sanskrit-.It is worth a try in developing understanding of Brahma Sutras.

one moderator of this list, Sri Vidya Sankar, holds the translation in high
