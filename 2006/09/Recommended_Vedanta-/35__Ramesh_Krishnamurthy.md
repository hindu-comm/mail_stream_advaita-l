Some good Indian language translations are published by the Gita
Press, Gorakhpur. You can commonly find their stalls at railway
stations across the country. Their translations retain almost the
entire Sanskrit vocabulary with only the grammar changed to the
relevant language.

The Ramakrishna Math's Chennai Ashrama publishes translations in
Tamil. You can order them online at www.sriramakrishnamath.org. The RK
Math also has Hindi translations published by their Nagpur Ashrama.
