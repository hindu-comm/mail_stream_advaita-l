My personal experience is that after starting with the book, I shifted to translations in Indian languages, because reading in English was doubly laborious with uncommon words like nescience (avidya) and mediate (as opposed to immediate) being used too regularly for comfort.

Namaste Sri Senani,

Would you (and/or the list members) recommend any good translations of 
the AchArya's works in hindi or tamil ? (especially
the prakaraNa granthas as I am a beginner).


Thanks in advance,

Regards,
Shyam
