Dear list members,

Please identify this verse requested on a different list:

****************************
Verse on Aatma

In G.V.Iyer's movie on Adi Shankara there is verse that is chanted when Adi
Shankara takes sanyasa. Some parts of the verse that Ravi (a freind of mine) 
and
I could make out is as under:
aatma purastaat, aatmaa dakshinataH ...
aatmai vedagum sarvamiti
pashyatevam anvaana evam

The chanting is Krishna Yajurveda style, so I was wondering, if one could
identify the verse. I will greatly appreciate any help.
