devI bhAgavatam

In SrImad bhAgavatam Suka is a celibate. But in devI bhAgavatam there is a
story according to which Suka got married and begot four sons and a
daughter. In this story there are two v ery interesting discussions, one
between sage vyAsa and Suka and the other between king janaka and Suka, on
the mind being the cause of bondage as well as liberation. This story has
been posted on my website

http://www.geocities.com/snsastri/glimpses.html under the heading 'Bondage
and Liberation are only in the mind.  I invite the members to visit this
site.
