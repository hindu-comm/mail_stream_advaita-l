ShaNmata sthApanAchArya is a traditional title of bhagavAn shrI
Adisha~NkarAchArya. But this may relate to iShTa devata and may not be
related to pa~nchayAtana pUja. devatArchana or pUja is considered a
devayaj~na (agnihotra, aupAsana and other yaj~nas are also called
devayaj~na), one of the pa~nchamahAyaj~nas to be performed by dvijas,
as described in the smR^itis.

Looking at the number of questions you have asked, I feel it is upto
the *worshipper* to imagine all these qualities or more upon the
paramAtma to begin worshipping. :)

The accepted category for a devata to be worshipped is it should be
mentioned in the vedas and shAstras. Even Christianity is divided over
whether Jesus was human or divine. As per history, there are many
unsavourable incidents related with this personality too. For an iShTa
devata to be worshipped as per the rules of pUja, we should hold the
shAstras as pramANa.

Abhishek
