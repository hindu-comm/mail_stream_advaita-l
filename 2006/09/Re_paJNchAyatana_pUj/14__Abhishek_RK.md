Actually, more than anything, these sannyAsis do these pUjas to show
the path for the loukika people, rather than as an obligation. The
pa~nchayatana pUja is more important and obligatory for gR^ihastas.

Still, the veda says this in the context of the various vedic devatas.
The full R^igveda mantra 1.164.46 which is rarely quoted in full is

Indram mitram varuNam agnim ãhuh,
atho divyah sa suparNo garutmãn,
ekam sad viprãh bahudhã vadanti,
agnim yamam mãtarišvãnam ãhuh.
