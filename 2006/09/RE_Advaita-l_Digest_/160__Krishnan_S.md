Pranams.



With the respect to your query on '1200 years Vs 2500 years', you came
across on Kanchi home page, may I submit the following?



On Adi Sankara, scholars seem to agree on the following ONLY



            a) That he was born at Kaladi of Kerala

            b) That he was just 32 years when he attained mukti



And scholars seem to differ on rest of issues like



            a) when he was born (and hence when he attained mukti)

            b) What works he himself authored

            c) What mutts he himself established

            d) where he attained mukti



Looks like that we may never have closure on these issues to the
satisfaction of all
