Thanks for the suggestion, but if I'm indeed mistaken in assuming
that SSS thought that the author of the Pa~nchapAdikA possessed
"malicious intent", can you please provide me with quotes from SSS's
works that conclusively proves otherwise?

"Its been written by some person with a malicious and mischievious
intention...to sidetrack from traditional methedology. So if its
indeed written by PadmapAdAcharya, then he being shishya of Shankara
is under debate/question."

The link above did not contain the full thesis, but
http://www.advaitin.net/Discussion%20Topics/Vidyaranya%20-r_goodding.pdf
had it.

In any case, it does not matter that the author of the JMV =/= author
of the Pa~nchadaSI, but only that the author of the JMV = SV, which
Robert Alan Godding (not sure what kind of authority his words have)
seems to agree with.

In other words, my argument is: if the author of the Pa~nchapAdikA
was writing with "malicious intent", we have to conclude that the
author of the JMV was also writing with "malicious intent" (because
the latter quotes the former as an authority). Are we ready to accept
that the author of the JMV can possibly be writing with "malicious
intent"? If not, the author of the Pa~nchapAdikA cannot be writing
with "malicious intent".

Regards,
Kartik
