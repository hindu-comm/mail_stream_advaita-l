Well, we need then to be clear on what we mean by "tradition".  i agree Newton's law is not comparable to Brahma Vidya - but the tradition of being handed over is nevertheless comparable; for both are vidyas - the former concerning one Self and the latter what is matter......

  SSS only attempts to point out to an aberration from the tenets handled in the Bhashya and the Vartika - down the ages, where he feels later works have mis-understood the concepts and he tries to only point out to what is already said in the Bhasys and the Vartika, he does not "create" any new version.  Thus, what he tries to point out is the same "tradition"; that he believes is the correct understanding of the Acharya and the Vartikakara.

  We read in the news papers some time before that a guy pointed out an approximation in the computations adopted by Newton; and when substituted with actual value the results changed a bit.   Teachers before him too have handled these, but this guy has been sharp enough to see the rounding off.  what i am saying is - akin, SSS points to a current of understanding that is possible outside the sub-commentaries' interpretation, which is vivid and self explanatory.   It is thus possible that even in tradition, though there is a continuity in teaching, some understanding is not given the due consideration and focus it deserves; as a result we consider things as we understand.   Acharya himself points out to such instances in his Bhashya.  


  To conclude:-  All right understanding of correct position is ever handed over by Tradition but not all understanding is correct tradition.  The proof is the so many arguments we see in the Bhashyas themselves.If there is no chance for some idea to be misunderstood or understood inadequately, "even under the garb of tradition" wherefrom so many Purva Pakshas have come in the Bhashyas and the Vartika !!    


  ==================================



  1. Newtons law is not comparable to brahma-vidyaa. Brahmaa-vidyaa is
handed down from guru to disciple and needs a sampradaaya. If you
don't believe this, read shankara for yourself. Within a few random
pages you'll probably get to this.  A sampradaaya does not exist in a
temporal vacuum and restart magically after 1000+ years.
