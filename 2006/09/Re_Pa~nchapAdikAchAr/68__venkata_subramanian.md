First, traditional teaching and otherwise: Sri Venkat said that
Satchitdaanandendra Saraswati Swamigal (SSS from now) belongs to the
same "tradition" as Vidyaaranya et. al. The reason being even
Sureshvara disagreed with Sankara, and by extension SSS disagreeing
with 1200 years of advaitins does not mean he is not from that
tradition.

  --------
  Sorry, i never said this i think.  I never made the sentence that "SSS belongs to the same "tradition" as Vidyaaranya et. al.".

  The reason for that given - i do not subscribe.






Thanks & Regards,
Venkat.

Sadgurubhyo Namah.
