Namaste Sri Ramakrishnan,
I am eagerly awiting your critique of Sacchidanandendra's writings. Just to
put things in perspective, criticising his approach by claiming he goes
against "tradition" is a logical fallacy. See:
http://www.nizkor.org/features/fallacies/appeal-to-tradition.html.

Regards,
Abhishek
