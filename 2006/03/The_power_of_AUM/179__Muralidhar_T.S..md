Pranams to all,

While reading a book on the developments in theortical physics (The Fabric 
of Cosmos) I was fascinated to come across the concept that sound is the 
medium through which gravitational waves can be transmitted and might form 
the communication between various dimensions that we still cannot perceive( 
The String theory assumption). I try to meditate as often as possible and do 
appreciate the benefits of recitation of AUM. As I am not well read with 
respect to the scriptures I wish to know from the knowledgable people in 
this group about their thoughts on AUM recitation and the correct way to 
practise its recitation. I would be interested to also know if anyone can 
enlighten me more on the references in our scriptures of these physics 
theories.

Thank You,

Murali
