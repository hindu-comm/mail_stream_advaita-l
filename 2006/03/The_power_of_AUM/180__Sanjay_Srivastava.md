Have you picked up the "AUM" chanting by guru-upadesha or yourself?

The reason I ask this because I heard a talk by Swami Dayananda in which he
says that recitation of simply "AUM" has been discouraged by shastra-s for
a householder. Recitation of pure "AUM" may create premature disenchantment
from worldly life. For a householder "AUM" attached with some other name of
God such as "Om namo bhagavate vAsudevAya" or "Om namah shivAya" is
considered more appropriate. Chanting of pure "AUM" is usually for
sannyAsins.

Of course, it is a different matter if you have started "AUM" chanting by
guru-upadesha.
