I am afraid this is not the correct appreciation of vedic dharma. As Sri Ram
Garib pointed out, drinking to cheer up would not fit anywhere in vedic
dharma. It may be permissible only if it is a part of some accepted
religious practices (here also I am not sure if "soma" used in vedic yAga
was really an intoxicant) or accepted by shishTAchAra (such as kAla-bhairava
temple in Ujjain).
