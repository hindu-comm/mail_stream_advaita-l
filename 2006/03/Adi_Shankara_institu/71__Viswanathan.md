This is my understanding of Sri Shankara`s philosophy.Real Bhakthi is Athma
Vicaram

Very much correct, I feel. All other ritualistic worships may not be the
Bhakthi in the real sense

Subject: [Advaita-l] Adi Shankara institution of worship


> Dear members
> Sri Adi Shankara is attributed with revivalism of Hinduism which faced
opposition to some of its tenets like animal sacrifices in Yagas and
insistance of Vedas recital only by Brahmanas.He emphasised on Jnana Kanda
of the vedas.Logically put forth arguments to refute the criticisms of both
Buddhism and Jainism.This is as per recorded history.Adi Shankara is also
called Shanmatha sthapanachrya.He instituted proper worship of Souram-Sun
god-.Shaktham -Devi worship,Ganapadyam -Ganapathy worship,Koumaram-Skandha
worship,Saivam-worship of Lord Shiva,and Vaishnavam-Worship of Vishnu.He has
also given a number of literary works-mainly sthothras- like Soundhrya
lahari,Shivanandha Lahari,Subrahmanya Bujangam,Sri Ganesa Panchrathnam ,Baja
Govindham,Sri Mahishasura Mardhini Sthothram the list almost endless.
> He advocated that  Brahmaiva sathyam and Jagan mithyam.The very important
thing is that based on Vedas only He gave His Advaita and all His Bashyas
reiterated this great understanding that there is no duality and whatever
differences we see in the world outside are due to superimposition  on the
ever pernament Brahman and this superimposition springs from Anadhi Avidhya
which has to be removed by right knowledge.If one reads His Athma Bhodha one
will appreciate how in very clear logical steps He explains  that knowledge
alone will result in realising Brahman.
> The other literary works in praise of deities and pujas are intended for
the beginners so to say to lead them to investigate within themselves the
One without  the second.The grandeur of His literary works will definitely
propel one to further go up the path of Brahman finding.
> This is my understanding of Sri Shankara`s philosophy.Real Bhakthi is
Athma Vicaram.
