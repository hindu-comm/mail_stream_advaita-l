While no advaitin officially accepts the secondary
status of karma-kanda, let me point out that the seeds
of this dichotomy are embedded in the first principles
of advaita-vedanta. Advaita-vedanta is the only school
that bifurcates veda-s into karma-kanda and
gyan-kanda. Later vedantin scholars have rightfully
taken shankara to task for this arbitrary division of
veda-s. There was no reason to bifurcate veda-s into
two parts unless there were qualitative differences
between them.

Personally, I find this division very insightful.
Anything associated with action cannot have a
universal and eternal applicability as opposed to
knowledge which can be true for all times. I guess
this is an important reason for advaita-vedanta's
appeal to a motley bunch of non-traditional seekers.
However, purists and scholars of other schools have a
legitimate point when they accuse advaita-vedanta of
relegating a major portion of veda-s to a secondary
status.

With regards,
Ram Garib
