Yes, I admit you could make that same interpretation about Aurobindo's
works. The one criterion he has used in determining the psychological
meanings is that the meaning should fit into a consistent structure
throughout the veda, which he claims he has managed to find. Also, I thought
Aurobindo was a philosopher of the Advaita school of thought, perhaps I am
mistaken here.
