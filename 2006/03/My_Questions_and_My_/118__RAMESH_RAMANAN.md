Dear All,

  The Sringeri websites sringeri.org, sringeri.net and sringerisharadapeetam.org seem to have been hacked by some unscrupulous scoundrels for no other reason than ease of access and sadistic pleasure. I think the webmaster of the websites must be informed about this. I do not have the email address and hence, I can only hope that the situation is rectified at the earliest and that we are able to access the websites. Pranams, Ramesh
