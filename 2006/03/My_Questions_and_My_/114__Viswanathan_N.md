I understand that reading english translations will not be enough to come to
a point of appreciating the vedas. One thing you could do is to learn few of
the basic suktams (if you haven't done so already). It has to be noted that
especially in Yajur Veda there are two levels of meaning namely, vacyArtha
(apparent meaning) and lakShYartha (actual or intended meaning). Now all of
the english translations were made by interested parties who certainly were
not favourable to the Hindu religion. So IMHO it is very difficult to make
out any sense of their translations. The lakShyartha will be determined by
repeated chanting of and meditation on the mantras. So if you are desirous
of knowing the meaning of the vedas (including upanishads) better you
actually learn them and try to find out the meaning yourself.
