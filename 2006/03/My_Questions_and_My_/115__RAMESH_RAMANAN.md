Dear Mr. Viswanthanji,
    Sri  Chandrashekaraendra sarswathi swamiji belongs to the Kanchi Math and not sringeri. The website of Kanchi Math is www.kamakoti.org. The sringeri website has not been functioning properly for the past one week and the address is www.sringeri.org. Best wishes, Ramesh Ramanan.
