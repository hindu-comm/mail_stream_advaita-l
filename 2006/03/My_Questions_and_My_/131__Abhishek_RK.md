Perhaps they are ignoring the fact that advaita vedanta to be put into
practice needs one to be a sannyAsi. This however does not mean you should
not study it while you are not  a sannyAsi. Perhaps this is why vedas have
j~nAna and karma kAnDas. Also could you or any other member please give the
exact quote where Acharya speaks about this issue?

Regards,
Abhishek
