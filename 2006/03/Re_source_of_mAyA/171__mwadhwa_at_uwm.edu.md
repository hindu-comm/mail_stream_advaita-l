Quoting Viswanathan N <vishy1962 at yahoo.com>:

** What shri. Adithya is saying is the crux of Advaitha.
**   I certainly understand ....but they say mere undersatnding is not enough
**   but u have to realise it by experience....
**
**   what to experience? where? how?
**
**   Its also said that knowledge is the light by which drkness of maya
** disappears..
**
**   once after knowing..what more?

Well said Viswanathanji,

     mann ki mrigtrishNa jab samApt ho jaye to phir shanti hai aur Ananda...
    phir tehraav hai...rahi ka ruk jaana...antar main tehar jaana...aur kya!!
    bhAgnA samApta ho jAta hai...aur trishnAyein sab nikal jaati hain...
    waise jaise prANa nikalte hain...phir pRaNa bhi teher jaate hain,mann bhi...
    aur bandhan toot jaate hain...tab shabda bhi apna bandhan chod dete hain

    tab mann ki oopari satah par kuch girta hai to bilkul waise jaise dhalAn
    wali chatt par varsha ki boondein..jo girti to hain par beh jAti
    hain...teharti nahin hain..tehrengi kahaan..mann ke bandhan toot gaye to
    hridaya main sthapit ho gaya...bachA kya..ek samudra si gehrayi aur ek
    vishaalta jismain sab samA jaaye..ek shoonyata aur ek vishaalta...saath
    saath..donon ek jo hain...aur kya!!!

    bass chalna hi raha...to woh chalte rehna hai hi...
    na yoga raha...na bhoga raha...bandhan tootne par kise todna hai ab..kaun
    se bandhan hain ab jo tootne hain...jo hai woh to antar main hai hi..use
    kis mandir main ja kar dhoondhna hai..dhoondhna to samApt ho gaya.antar
    main jo mandir hai wahaan jab baith gaye hamesha ke liye to kaun sa mandir,
    kaun sa haridwaar raha baahar...jab hari ka dwaar bhi andar hi dhoondh
    liya..to aur kya
    bass aur kya....

well said Vishwanathanji...What more?
Well you made me poetic again...
Adityaji...keep searching..when the searching will be over naturally...you will
get all the answers to the questions you are posing now....that's why
Vishwanathanji didn't say anything about what you were asking and so wouldn't I
say anything....I hope you can understand hindi...

Pranaams..
Manish
