Greetings,

Thanks Manish ji

For the benefit of all those who don't understand Hindi.
I have not been able to preserve the poetic meter and rhyme.

When the illusions of the mind subside, peace and bliss take over.
Then there is steadiness. The wanderer rests, rests in his innermost
self. What else! The running stops, and illusions are thrown out, like
when prANa exit. Then prANa and mind both achieve a steadiness, and
all attachments are severed. At that point, the attachment to words is
also severed.

The outer surface of the mind then becomes like a slanted roof, on
which droplets drop but slip off without affecting. How would they
affect, the mind is now free of shackles and is affixed in the heart.
What is left then? An ocean-like depth and a largeness in which
everything is assimilated. A zeroness and an infinitude, together,
because both are one, what else!!

Only the walking remains, of course that walking shall continue. <--
[this I am not very sure of having translated accurately].
Neither Yoga remains, nor bhoga remains. What should one break after
breaking Attachment? What attachment is left now? Whatever is left is
in the innermost already. In which temple shall that be searched for?
The search itself is over now. When you are sitting eternally in the
temple that is inside, which other temple, which Haridwar now remains
outside? When Hari's dwaar (door) has itself been found Inside, then
what else! Just... what else!
