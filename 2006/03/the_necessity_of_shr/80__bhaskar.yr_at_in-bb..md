avidyA is neither existent nor non-existent and
cannot be defined.

praNAms Sri Amuthan prabhuji
Hare Krishna

AFAIK, avidya is not anirvachanIya but mAya has been described as
anirvachanIya (cannot be defined as sat or asat)  shankara clearly states
that avidyA is anAdi & naisargika to human mind which can be eradicated
completely through jnAna...

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
