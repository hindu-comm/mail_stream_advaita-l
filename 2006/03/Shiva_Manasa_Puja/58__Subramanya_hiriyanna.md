Dear All,
PraNamamyaham,
To supplement  to the explanation of Mr Giridhar Vyas, I would like to add
my comments as follows:
The shloka explains the prescribed shodasha-upachara puja in steps Viz.
Avaahana,Dhyana, Aasana, Snana(includes Padyam,Arghyam, Achamanam), Vastra(
Yajnopaveeta), Alankara by Haridra, Kumkuma, Sindhur Churanm, Gandha,
Akshyate &Chandana, Flowers and Bilavapatra,etc Dhoopa, Deepa,Naivedya
through Paayasam, Bhakshyam etc, Tamboola, Stuti by Purusha Sukta, Rudram,
Chamakam etc., Neeranjana, Mantrapushpa and Pradakshina, Kshamaparadhana,...
all the rituals in the Pooja Vidhi included.
Similar request to consider "*my every word I utter*" as your praise is also
found in Kulashekar Alwar's "*Mukunda Mala Stotra*" which I am reminded.
"*Aalapanam Pratipadam kuru ma Mukunda"*
Yours truly,
