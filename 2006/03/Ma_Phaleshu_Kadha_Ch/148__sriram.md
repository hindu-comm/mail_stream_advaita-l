dear sir
Ma Phalesu must be linked to Ma te Sangostva NiKarmani...
the Secret according to Krsna is NaishKarmya...
the lucid explanation of this is found in Aurobindo's Gita rendition.
as for the student in context... what is not under your control why worry
about it? and what is under your control don't worry about it either?

Subject: [Advaita-l] Ma Phaleshu Kadha Chana
