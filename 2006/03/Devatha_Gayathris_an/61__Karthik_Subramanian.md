Hello all,

  I have a small question/doubt here. Request the learned members of the group to kindly clarify.

  Does one require upadesha from the guru to chant the gayathris pertaining to the devathas, i.e. Ganapathi Gayathri, Rudra Gayathri, Narasimha Gayathri, etc?

  Thanks and regards,
Karthik
