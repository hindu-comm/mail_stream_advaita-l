Sri K. Sundararaman mAmA  kindly shared the PDF file of the book "Sri
Lakshmi Kataksham" and pictures of three yantra-s therein with me and asked
me to post it to the list.  I thank him sincerely for this help.

This book was originally printed in kaNNaDa lipi and through the efforts of
Sri KS, this was printed in Tamil/devanAgari lipi. The Tamil text follows
the format designed by Sri Nanganallur Sridharan and it enables a Tamil
reader to pronounce the text correctly. In addition to works on aShTa laxmI,
texts like viShNu kavacham  and others on Sriman nArAyANa is also given.

If you dont know Tamil, just ignore the introductory material. All the
stotra-s in the text are  given in devanAgari lipi along with Tamil.


Thanks.

Ravi
