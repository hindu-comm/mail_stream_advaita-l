What should be the correct position of our body and hands when saying 
abhivAdanam and pratyabhivadanam.  Some are saying before performing the 
namaskAram and some are saying after doing the namaskAram.    Also, when 
saying abhivAdanam, some are just touching the ears and some are keeping 
the finger behind the ears.  Can someone please let me know what should be 
correct position and the reason for the same?  Also, what is the reason 
for not saying abhivAdanam to women (other than the mother and Guru?s 
wife). 

Thanks
Basker
