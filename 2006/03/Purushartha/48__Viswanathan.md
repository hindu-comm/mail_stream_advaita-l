Pranams to all learned


We all know what Purushartha is. namely. Dharma, Artha, Kama, & Moksha

Recently read a poetic verses of grand old tamil lady " OOuyar", wher in she
defines:

Giving(whatever) to the needy is "Dharma"
Earning to live & give without hurting anyone is " Aartha"
Two living in communion of minds is " Kama"
and leaving all these three & realise that "Bhraman" is " Moksha"


So simple...so stright...containing the whole philosophy of Life
Isnt it!!!!

Aum tatsat
