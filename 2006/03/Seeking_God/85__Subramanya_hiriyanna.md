Om Namo Bhagavate Shankaracharyaya !
This is my first blog or todalnudi on this site.
To add to Santosh's reply, for the question of how many times one has to
pray etc., I would like to remind :
Yogarathova Bhogarathova, Sangaratova, SangavihInah
Yasya Brahmani Ramate Chittam, Nandati Nandati Nandatyeva

from Bhajagovindam. Hence once can pray whenever he is awake and always
irrespective of status in whihc one resides.
