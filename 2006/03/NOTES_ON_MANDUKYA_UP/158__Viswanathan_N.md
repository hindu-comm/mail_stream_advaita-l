Pranaams Manishji


  What you have said here and in reply the question on Maya are absolutely true and nothing beyond.

  When craving for any sort of experiences stops the mind disappears, when that happens all dualities (good/bad, birth/death, day/night....)disappear. The point thus you reach is the pinacle of Advaitha.
  But even your craving for that experience would be an obstacle to reach there....just drop every desire/ thought/what all you stored as knowledge ...everything, it will happen automatically at the point of 'shoonya'

causal relation of sat-chit-aananda swaroopa as another hysteria or
diplopia.....Advaita Vedanta is to take beyond causality...and Causality is in
the field of time-space model....
Keep practicing...it has to die...the causality part also...for slowly you
will reach where you will wonder, "Is there really any Cause!!!" The cause is
only of ignorance and that too is ignorance...otherwise there is no cause......
Where dharma-adharma..causal-non-causal...theism-atheism all lose meanings....
then... THAT ART THAT.. to which you are ascribing the causal source...

Quoting kuntimaddi sadananda :

** Shree Ram Garib - PraNAms

** Thanks for your mail.
**
** Creation cannot be done by inert material. Scripture defines Brahman as
** ananda as well as chaitanya swarUpa also - satyam, jnaanam, anantam
** brahma or sat chit ananda, brahman. sAnkya states that inert prakRiti
** is the cause for creation just like the way you have presented.
** Brahmasutra tries to dismiss that theory saying that Brahman who is
** conscious entity is the cause for creation. If it is just existence,
** alone it could be inert. Scripture also says about creation - atmaaana
** akaasha sambhuutaH , akaaShaat vayuH, vayoH agniH, agneH aapaH, apaH
** pRithivii, etc. Hence, Atma, the self, which is of the nature of sat
** chit ananda is the cause for creation. 'Sa kaamayata' - He desired and
** He created. Hence, Shankara says - abhinna nimitta upAdAna kArana -
** Undifferentiated efficient and material cause as Brahman. ManDukya is
** going to tell us more about this. I will be coming to the Upanishad
** portion slowly. I felt that unless some of the epistemological issues
** are ironed out, it is difficult to follow the Upanishad.
**
** Hari OM!
** Sadananda
