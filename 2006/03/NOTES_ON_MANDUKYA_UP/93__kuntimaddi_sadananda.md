Shree Senani - My humble praNaams.  That is a beatiful comment.  You are
right,  If  and when we know that the laxana does suffer the ativyApti. 
It is still swAbhAvika but not swarUpa.  You have correctly zeroed in
the problem. If sat chit ananda is understood as swarUpa the purpose is
served. You are right on that. sweetness is still its swbhAvika dharma,
but not its swarUpa dharma.  What term would you suggest to separate
just the necessary, and necessary and sufficient qualifications. 

Hari OM!
Sadananda
