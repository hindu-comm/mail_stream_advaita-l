I understand that Sri Sadananda does not want to be drawn into a discussion and
that his terminology has the sanction of H. H. SwAmi paramArthnandajI. Yet, one
question is nagging me which I pose to the learned members of this forum.

One of the defects of laXaNa is said to be ativyApti, literally 'spreading
beyond' [the object-set to be defined]. In the case of sugar, if sweetness is
said to be the laXaNa, it suffers from ativyApti because such a definition
would allow many other substances, including Equal, to be classified as sugar.
C6H12O6 as a definition of sugar would not suffer from such a dosha. Such being
the case is there a need to introduce two more technical terms swAbhAvika and
swarUpa laXanas?
