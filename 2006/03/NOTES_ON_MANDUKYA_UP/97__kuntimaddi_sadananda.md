I found lot of typos and missing words in the post.  My excuse is I am
using somebody's computer and internet facilities.

Cowness or gotvam.  Whatis that gotvam - is it a specific attribute? 
Gotvam is considered as deterministic qualification of a cow.  But what
is that gotvam? Vedanta Deshika says it is an integrated qualification
of all cow qualifications put together that peceiver sees in all cows -
it is its jaati laxaNa. It is different from horseness of the horse or
goatness of the goat. This is gathered by experience after seeing
sajaati and vijaatis. What is this gotvam - ultimately it is that cow
has - and what is a cow and cow is that which has gotvam.  We have a
circular definition.

Sorry for the confusion arising in my communication.
