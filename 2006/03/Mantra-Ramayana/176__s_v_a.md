  Can any one suggest where i can get Mantra-Ramayana by Neelkantha As i read an artilce, that how Ramayana epic had evolved from Rig-veda
As it's not a history, rather epic to explain Vedas. As Puranas&Smrits are for explaning mystery of Vedas. So please if you know tell, where i can get this book. And also see the article on advait-vedant.org
