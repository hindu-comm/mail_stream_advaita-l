An edition with Hindi translation was published by Prachya Prakashan, 
Varanasi in 1988.

An edition with Nilakanthas own commentary, Mantrarahasyaprakashika, and Hindi 
translation was published by Uttara Pradesh Samskrt Samsthana, Lucknow in 
1998.

An edition with English translation was published by B.R. Publishing 
Corporation, New Delhi in 2001.

Note these are available at the New York Public Library.  I have not read 
them so I don't know if they are any good.
