Thanks for the info. I have not yet completed one round of reading the
"big 10", so detailed studies of the others will have to wait.

What I would like to know is - is there a book/article/paper/website
that briefly describes the contents of each of the 108 Upanishads?

So far I have only come across sources (including Vidyasankar's site
www.advaita-vedanta.org) that classify the 108 into mukhya, sAmAnya,
yoga, shaiva, etc.

Vidyasankar-ji, in your website you have mentioned that there is an
overlap in content between the saMnyAsa and yoga Upanishad-s. So have
you undertaken any study of the same?
