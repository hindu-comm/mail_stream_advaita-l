Namaste.

  Sri Ramakrishna Mission has a publication titled, '108 Upanishadcharam'. It is a small book, concise edition, good for a start.

  Namaste,

Has any of our members done a detailed study of the Upanishads apart
from the "Big 10"?

Specifically, has anybody come across a compilation/summary of the 108
Upanishads listed in the Muktika? Possibly a summary of Upanishad
Brahmayogin's commentaries?
