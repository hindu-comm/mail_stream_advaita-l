Ththe mud pot simile of mandukya Upanishad.
  Just think of numourous mud pots of diff sizes, shapes colora available in a potter's shop. Think of Space inside any pot and that is outside. Is there any difference in the space withi and out.
  Now assume yourself to be one of the mud pots, than you have two choices to center our consciousness / or identifying yourselves either on the walls of the pot or the SPACE within.
   In vast majority (say 99.99%) of the cases consciousness is on the mud walls( that is your body, mind and ego) which are purely of temporary.
  Than you think yourself as separate individuals  and EGO, The Maya separating them from existence,develops. Naturally,you start believing Birth/ Death cycle...and Karma theory (based on logic' every action would have equal and opposite reaction') start its role, unfulfilled desires at the time of death based on which next birth, etc, etc...
  In rarest of rare cases , the shift of consciousness from walls to center happens. Immediately he realizes " He is That"...that he had never born or ever going to die...his  beginning less/ endless/ attribute nature, and Ultimate ONENESS of the whole existence.
  That shift , I understand as MUKTHI. When that happens he ceases to exist as Individual and becomes Whole.

+ Why does mAyA exist?

is mAyA itself beginningless and endless in the "absolute" sense?

+ - if not so, does it have a beginning in time?
