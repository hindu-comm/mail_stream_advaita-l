The points raised by shri. Abhishek is very much true.

Let me try to explain with my limited understanding:

- The ultimate truth is only "ONE" without name/form/ beginning or the
end.That ONE is very much in you too. To realisew that is the goal of
advaitha.
- all the forms and names are for the common  people, to visualise that ONE
in whatever for they can and start the journey. But as you proceed further
everything get dropped on thier own
- This aspect is clarified by many instances..for example, Ramakrishna
Paramahamsa finally dropping (of course with great difficulty) even the
image of KALI at the instance of his guru " Totapuri"
-Otherway of lookng is...You can take the example of electricity..it is one
and formless...but in daily life so many forms we see..Electric bulps.
tubelights, TV, radio, Acs, heaters, waching mach and even big Industrial
Machines....All these are for a purpose to be served...but behind everything
is the " Power' called electricity.
-Again this power too can neither be created or destroyed...just changes
from one form to another for external eyes...there in lghtning, wind, flow
of water, sunlight..even in the atoms..
- The ONE whis I am refering (say, Bhraman) is similar..when you see that
power behind creation call it 'Bhrama', sustaing lives 'Vishnu'  and ending
with " Shiva". And for your imagination, fancy...call what ever Durga,
skanda, ganesha...mariamma, muniamma whatever..
- All ritulas we carry is nothing but to gain  Physical/ Pshycologial
strenths or materials to carry out living and Nothing more
- This is what sage Ashtawakra says to Janaka..and so many sages in
upanishads under different circumstances and contexts and forms


This is what my undersatnding  about te basic " Advaitha".....Correct me if
I am wrong.

Pranams to all learned
Viswanath

But where did Shri Krishna say that Shiva and Ganapathi are different from
Him? On the other hand we have "shivAya vishNu rUpAya shivarUpAya vishNave|
shivasya hRdayam vishNu vishNoshca hRdayam shivaH||" which means Shiva is
not different from Vishnu.

2>Here another question is when the person goes to loka to whom he worships

That all paths lead to one goal is to be taken in the proper context. Anyway
I am not sure where Vivekananda's quote  is mentioned in the bhAshyas
followed by advaitins.
