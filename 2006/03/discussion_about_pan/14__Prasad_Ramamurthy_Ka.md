*Well* as far as the fourth ashrama [Sannyasa]  is concerned, except Brahma
Vishnu and Shiva (spouses) they do not meditate on other gods. In general it
is said that all those who worship God heads and others (ex. Indra,
Varuna,.... etc) are termed as devanAmpriya. If I remember right Ashoka too
had a title devanAmpriya. But devanAmpriya also means *fool* (as the person
would simply worship those God heads without worshipping the Ultimate).
