* I was under the impression that the pUrva mImAMsaka-s classified
every "statement" in the veda as vidhi, niSedha or arthavAda
(therefore, a mantra would also be divided into these 3 categories).

The mImAMsaka-s even consider the upaniShad-s to be arthavAda. Of
course, the advaita-vedAntins consider the upaniShad-s to be jnAna
kANDa, which is unrelated to karma of any kind.

However, if one divides up the rest of the veda into karma kANDa and
upAsanAkANDa, I was wondering whether the arthavAda portions would
mostly come under upAsanAkANDa.

So let me put it this way - to what part of the veda does the
vidhi/niShedha/arthavAda classification apply?
