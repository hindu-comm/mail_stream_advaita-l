But where did Shri Krishna say that Shiva and Ganapathi are different from
Him? On the other hand we have "shivAya vishNu rUpAya shivarUpAya vishNave|
shivasya hRdayam vishNu vishNoshca hRdayam shivaH||" which means Shiva is
not different from Vishnu.

That all paths lead to one goal is to be taken in the proper context. Anyway
I am not sure where Vivekananda's quote  is mentioned in the bhAshyas
followed by advaitins.

Abhishek
