Sorry for interfering in this discussion. I found this:

ag·nos·tic (n).

1.a. One who believes that it is impossible to know whether there is a God.
1. b. One who is skeptical about the existence of God but does not profess
true atheism.
2. One who is doubtful or noncommittal about something.

>From the above definition how does it follow that advaita is even anywhere
close to agnosticism? I feel this charge is made by modern western
researchers and trumped up by purvapakshis. No doubt that it does not fit in
either 1.a or 1.b of the above and 2 does not apply here.
