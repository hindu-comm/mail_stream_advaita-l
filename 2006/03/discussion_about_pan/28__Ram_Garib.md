This is the official line in vedanta. However let me
submit that my inherent distrust in karma-kanda
portion of veda-s has not seriously impaired my
ability to appreciate or even benefit from the
jnana-kanda of veda-s.

A vedantin is philosophically obliged to defend both
the portins to support apaurusheyatva of veda-s. A
layman who is hardly concerned about paurusheyatva or
apaurusheyatva of veda-s can still appreciate sublime
message in upanishadic portions. 

However, for an advanced sadhaka, the agnostic stand
will definitely lead to internal conflict at some
point of time.

With regards,
Ram Garib
