>From "Essentials of Krishna & Shukla Yajurveda" by RL Kashyap (published by
SAKSI- Bangalore):

"In the Rudra-homa or Gana-homa, the entire namaka hymn in TS(4.5) and the
chamaka hymn in TS (4.7) may be chanted with the associated ritual. But
these two steps are just two acts in the twelve day Vedic rite of
Agnichayana."

Therefore IMO Sri Rudrasuktam would not be arthavada but a mantra.

Abhishek

PS. As indicated in an earlier mail Agnisthoma and Agnichayana are taking
place once again in Kerala from 29 March 2006. Please visit:
