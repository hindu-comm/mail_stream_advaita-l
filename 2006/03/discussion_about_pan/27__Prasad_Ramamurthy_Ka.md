But I *strongly* beleive that we cannot selectively appreciate vedas. We can
get a number of proofs for proving Karmakanda and Jnanakanda are for one
single purpose. It would be avidya-ish to appreciate either of them in
separation. What  would be vidya-ish is to revere both Karmakanda and
Jnanakanda.

<Vyavaharika>

We could analogously say Karmakanda = practical and Jnanakanda = theory
(Say).

We would arrive at certain conclusions in science based on theories. But
every theory has to be supportedly concluded using experimentation
practically. But in Vedas it happens vice-versa. The Karmakanda  prepares a
man to eliminiate maya and thus helps in in understanding the Jnanakanda.
