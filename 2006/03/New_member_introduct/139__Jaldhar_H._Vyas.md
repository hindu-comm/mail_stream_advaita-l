I am Dr. Ayush Sinha, and I am A doctor in the Cambridge University in the
UK. I am an Indian and belong to Bhopal in India.I do not know much about
advaita vedanta but want to learn about it so as to understand the religion
better. I agree with the terms and conditions of Advaita Vedanta.

Kind Regards

Ayush Sinha
