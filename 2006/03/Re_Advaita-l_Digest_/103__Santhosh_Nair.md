Hi All
Actually, I had posted a mail thanking all of you who responded to my questions. But it bounced since the adresss was wrong with some extra text added to the matter. So I can't forward teh bounced mail.

I wish to thank all of you who responded to my silly questions in such a forum where discussions of much higher level are happening. But as I said, I could not find a better place to post them. 

I still have a lot of questions but I don't have time (lot of work these days) to post them all. I know I am also bothering those of you who are not intersted in such discussions with my mails. Sorry of that.

I have created a separate group at this address http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedantaqueries.

Currently, you might not find any new discussions on it as I have just started it. I invite all of you people who are ready and available to answer basic questions by people like me to join the group. (I am now afraid that I will be the only person who will be asking questions.!) 

Thank you all of you,
Santhosh.
