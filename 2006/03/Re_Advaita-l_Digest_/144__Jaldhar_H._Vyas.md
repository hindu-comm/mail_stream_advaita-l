I for one am a working person.  I am also in the IT field.  To be honest, 
I do not follow all the principles of Advaita Vedanta.  As a grhastha who 
has elderly parents, wife, children, who depend on me I simply cannot. 
That is why I try to follow karmayoga i.e. doing my duty as per shastras 
and society as dilligently as possible.  Vedic dharma operates on several 
different levels and does offer options for people in different 
situations.  What is absolutely wrong for the serious sadhaka is to just 
pick and choose what they are going to do.

It was mentioned in a previous post that the ideal is to follow the 
ashramas in order from Brahmacharya to Sannyasa.  However Shankaracharya 
says that one can take sannyasa from any ashrama because it is entirely a 
seperate category of behavior.

Whether it is feasible to take sannyasa or not is highly dependent on 
individual situations.  I know a family whose son became a (Vaishnava) 
sadhu straight after college and they were overjoyed by it.

There has to be honesty on both sides.  Loved ones have to ask whether 
their objections are really based on their childs interest or selfish 
motives?  Prospective sannyasis have to ask are they just trying to escape 
from worldly problems or do they have a real sense of vairagya?  Are 
people being hurt by this action?  (A sannyasi always wants to avoid 
that.)

As long as one feels attachment, one is not ready for sannyasa or the 
higher practices of Advaita Vedanta.  But that doesn't mean one has to 
stop in ones tracks.  There is plenty even a grhastha can do to increase 
vairagya.


5. What's the truth about heaven, hell etc?

It is not the same body that goes to heaven or hell, they are reborn 
there.

Rebirth.  The time spent in heaven or hell is proportionate to ones 
balance of good or bad deeds.

> c) If one goes to heaven, is that Moksha?

No.  Because as noted in b) heaven and hell are transitory whereas Moksha 
is permanent.  In our shastras we have many stories of sages who were 
advanced in tapa but get tempted by Indra with promises of material 
rewards.  But a true sage will consider even rulership of heaven as 
inferior to Moksha.

See a).

Well if a cat is reborn as a human, it will be able to do things a cat was 
not able to do.  Different levels of beings have different abilities and 
different rules.

Because we want them to be linked with us and return to our own families.
