 Please consider , when you talk about Yogas, what Acharyas view is!
In Brahmasutra bhasya, he rejected Yoga at commentry on sutra, " Eten Yoga Pratyukta"(by rejecting Sankhyas, Yoga is also rejected). Also read Brihataranyaka Bhasya where, he also said " No" to question which asks, viz. 'Any "Viniyog(Karma) is needed for Dnyan?. I hope , we can discuss on this issue. What you think my friends.
