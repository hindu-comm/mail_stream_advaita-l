While Shankaracharya is a critic of the darshan, I believe Vidyashankar
has collected several examples from prasthana trayi were he speaks
favorably of yogic practices.

praNAms
Hare Krishna

Yes,  there is a place for first 5 limbs of aShtAnga yOga of patanjali i.e.
yama, niyama, Asana, praNAyAma & pratyAhAra in shankara's advaita...but
interpretation of the next three limbs i.e. dhAraNa, dhyAna & samAdhi in
advaita differs from classic yOga system of patanjali.   Sri Vidyashankar
prabhuji says that only in the definition/experience of samAdhi, vEdAnta
differs from yOga of  patanjali...

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
