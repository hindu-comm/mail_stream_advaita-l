Hari Om,

Virat: Total of all gross bodies i.e Cosmic form of waker (vishwa)
Hiranyagarbha: Total of all subtle bodies i.e Cosmic form of dreamer
(Taijasa)
Ishwara: Total of all causal bodies i.e cosmic form of the deep sleeper
(Pragna)

If the above understanding is correct, then what do we mean by total of all
subtle bodies. Is it like total of all subtle bodies in all the lokas?

Can the learned members of this list help.

Thanks & regards
arun
