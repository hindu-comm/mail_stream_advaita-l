With regard to the above it has to be noted that Ashoka was no longer
following the vaidika dharma when he "adopted" ahiMsa but he had become a
bouddha. Noone can deny the harm caused by such pretentious ahiMsa to our
people. Also note that some (like Arabs and Turks) did take advantage of
ahiMsa followed in bouddha parts of Bharatvarsha and invaded the land. So
the harm was done in giving up of svadharma by some of our previous rulers.

Regards,
Abhishek
