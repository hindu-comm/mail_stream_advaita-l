I wish to bring to the notice of the members who have recently joined this
List my website http://www.geocities.com/snsastri

Apart from a number of articles on Vedantic topics, I have posted a summary
of Panchadasi chapter by chapter. I am now summarising Vivekachudamani,
topic by topic. In this summary I am giving also extracts from other
authoritative texts relevant to the particular topic.
