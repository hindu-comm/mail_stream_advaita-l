the projections of your mind. If you have done good deeds , that remais 
in your mind and project pleasent memories/experiences, that is swarga 
. if have lived the life bad way, the projections wud be mere 
reflections of your deeds like punishments or sufferings others underwent due to 
your actions. Certainly you will experience all these before your death 
itself. Or more probably when you can not settle your accoubts 
completely before death, you (the ego and mind ) take another form at much 
higher or lower stata according to your past deeds and left over desires in 
the mind" 


  Can you please provide some references from Upanishads or from Gita etc. 

  for the above statements.

  Namaste
