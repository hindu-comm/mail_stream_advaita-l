<mahA-rAmAyaNa-yoga-vAsiSTha> dwells most on this <pauruSa> "Paurusha" in the 8th Canto of the Mumukshu-Prakarana. Here the Muni Vasishtha the Supreme replies to the young melancholic prince Rama's compaints about Daiva and Niyati with his antidote of <pauruSa>. He sums up his view in 

   mUDhaiH praklpitaM daivaM tat parAste kSayaM gataH | 
   prAjJAs tu pauruSArthena padam uttamatAM gatAH || 2 | 8 ||

"When fools imagine Daiva Fate, thereupon they're in destruction; 
 the wise make use of Paurusha Power to attain the highest state." 

or again he says rather boastfully, 

   asmAbhir aparai rAma puruSair munitAM gataiH | 
   pauruSeNaiva saMprAptA ciraM gagana-gAmitA || 2 | 21 || 

"As for us, Rama, when a Purusha Person takes up the Muni business, by exercising his Paurusha Personality, he gets a long life as a Gagana-gamin Sky-Rover"



I just reiterate my prevous request. 

I would like the views of you wise Vedantis about <pauruSa>.
