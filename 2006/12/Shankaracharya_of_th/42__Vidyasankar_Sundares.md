Dear Sri Krishnadas,

As far as I am aware, the situation remains confused. There continue to be 
two separate establishments in the village of Joshimath itself, each 
disputing the validity of the other.

Unfortunately, court cases tend to have really long lives in India, for 
various reasons. Whether the succession issue in Jyotirmath could have been 
or should be decided by a judge in the Indian courts is a different matter 
altogether.

Regards,
Vidyasankar
