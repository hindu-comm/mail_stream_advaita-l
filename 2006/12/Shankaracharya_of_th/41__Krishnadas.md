Namaste,

Can anyone please advise the factual outcome of the High Court case of a 
few
years ago which met to decide upon the true incumbent of Jyotishpeeth?

The excellent essay by Vidyasankar Sundaresan in the year 2000:

http://www.ucl.ac.uk/~ucgadkw/position/shank-jyot-ascii.html),

states all the historical facts clearly up to that time, concerning the
various parties in the Shankaracharya of the North dispute.  However,
the recent High Court decision seems to remain inconclusive on this
sensitive issue.
