I thank Shri Ramakrishna for his efforts.  One of the long time complaints 
we've had is that sometimes the discussions on this list are at too high 
a level and there should be a more gentle introduction to Advaita Vedanta 
for novices.  I think you will find these articles ably fulfill this need.

So please read along as each unit is posted and feel free to ask questions 
if there is something you want clarification on.

The series will be archived at http://www.advaita-vedanta.org/kramakrishna/
