Shiva appears handsome wearing the skin of the intoxicated leader of 
elephants as His upper garment. His feet are worshipped by even the exalted 
BrahmA and Vishnu. He wears mattted locks of hair that are kept cool by the 
spraying of gaN^gA, the river ofthe Gods and siddhas. I seek refuge in that 
Chandrashekhara (Shiva)(the Lord who bears the moon on His head). What will 
Yama (Death) do to me?

The coiled up king of serpents has become His ear-ring and the nandI bull 
His vehicle. His glory is praised by the foremost among sages such as 
nArada. He is the Lord of the worlds, the destroyer of the demon andhaka, 
the desire fulfilling tree of those who have sought refuge in Him, and the 
subduer of Death himself. I seek refuge in that Chandrashekhara (Shiva)(the 
Lord who bears the moon on His head). What will Yama (Death) do to me?
