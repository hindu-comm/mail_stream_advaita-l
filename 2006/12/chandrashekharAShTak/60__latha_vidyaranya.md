  thank you so much, dear anandji, for providing us the entire translation of sri chandrashekaraashtakam. it was a beautiful and glorious description of chandrashekara. i have seen the efficacy of this stotra in keeping away the 'apamrityu'. mrityu each one of us have to face. but apamrityu can be kept away by chanting this stotra with all sincerity and devotion. i have chanted this on behalf of some patients in very serious conditions, in total faith and seen lives being saved.
  thank u so much once again.
  thanks to the list member who requested me to give a translation that inturn brought forth this beautiful translation by sri anandji.

He is affectionate towards His devotees. He is the inexhaustible treasure of 
those who worship Him, even though He Himself is without clothes(digaMbara). 
He is the Lord of all beings, the Supreme, Unfathomable, Unsurpassed One. 
His form is guarded by the earth, water, sky, fire, and the moon. I seek 
refuge in that Chandrashekhara (Shiva)(the Lord who bears the moon on His 
head). What will Yama (Death) do to me?

He is engaged in creating, then maintaining, and finally destroying the 
universe. His abode is all the worlds (He pervades all the worlds). Having 
associated with the host (group) of Ganesha's followers (gaNas), He lets 
them play day and night. I seek refuge in that Chandrashekhara (Shiva)(the 
Lord who bears the moon on His head). What will Yama (Death) do to me?
