He is affectionate towards His devotees. He is the inexhaustible treasure of 
those who worship Him, even though He Himself is without clothes(digaMbara). 
He is the Lord of all beings, the Supreme, Unfathomable, Unsurpassed One. 
His form is guarded by the earth, water, sky, fire, and the moon. I seek 
refuge in that Chandrashekhara (Shiva)(the Lord who bears the moon on His 
head). What will Yama (Death) do to me?

He is engaged in creating, then maintaining, and finally destroying the 
universe. His abode is all the worlds (He pervades all the worlds). Having 
associated with the host (group) of Ganesha's followers (gaNas), He lets 
them play day and night. I seek refuge in that Chandrashekhara (Shiva)(the 
Lord who bears the moon on His head). What will Yama (Death) do to me?
