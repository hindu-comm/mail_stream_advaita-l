Pranams Krisji

You are spot on. 

sAyaNAcharya says the goddess is the protector of worshippers. I was wondering why he interpreted it so; you have provided the answer!

Thinking aloud in a group of keen sadhakas indeed furthers one's understanding. 

Thanks,
Senani

This does not make sense. Why would God discriminate between wise and unwise and protect only the wise? God protects every one. So the translation of RaviShakar makes sense to me.
