>Couple of issues in the translation given by you. Normally the karma, that is the object of an action (here >'us') should be in dvitIyA vibhakti; since nah is also the dvitIyA of aham, why should we say that nah is the >shashThI?

>With the above, the meaning would be along the lines of "May the powerful (vAjinIvatI) goddess SarasvatI, the >protector of the wise (dhInAm avitrI), protect us well through consecrated speech (vAjebhih)"?

This does not make sense. Why would God discriminate between wise and unwise and protect only the wise? God protects every one. So the translation of RaviShakar makes sense to me.
