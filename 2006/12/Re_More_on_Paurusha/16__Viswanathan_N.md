  "I would not put it that way. "Spiritual evolution" is so vague. A person
who is fervently committed to Dharma consisting of yajnas etc. _is_
spiritually evolved."

  Sir,

  With due apologies, I disagree with the above statement. What is Dharma?
  Isnt't it totally relative! Doing yajnas alone cant be dharma. For a butcher , butching is Dharma (hope you recall the story of rishi who burnt a bird, going for  biksha, guided to a butcher by devote housewife)

   One who knows " Who He is", who doesnt have desires/ attachments and just carrying on his dutiful karma is spritually evolved. He needn' t even be a scholor of scriptures or priest doing rituals. Take the cases of Kabir, Meera, Bhakta Khumbhar.......


  Pranams again 

  Vishwanath

I would not put it that way. "Spiritual evolution" is so vague. A person
who is fervently committed to Dharma consisting of yajnas etc. _is_
spiritually evolved. The problem is that because he is not fully aware of
the facts, the heaven that he reaches will come to an end and he will once
again get caught up in samsara.
