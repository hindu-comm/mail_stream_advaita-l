As the gItA also says, yogaH karmasu kauSalam. Without understanding the 
results of karma, it is not possible to achieve the excellence in action 
that is indicated here. It is not that we should not expect action to 
produce results. Action always produces results, good or bad, but perhaps 
not in the timeframe that we like. The key is to not get attached to the 
results (yoginaH karma kurvanti sangaM tyaktvA AtmaSuddhaye), and not to get 
disappointed or carried away by them.

Regards,
Vidyasankar
