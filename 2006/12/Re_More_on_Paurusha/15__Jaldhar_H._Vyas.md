I would not put it that way.  "Spiritual evolution" is so vague.  A person
who is fervently committed to Dharma consisting of yajnas etc. _is_
spiritually evolved.  The problem is that because he is not fully aware of
the facts, the heaven that he reaches will come to an end and he will once
again get caught up in samsara.
