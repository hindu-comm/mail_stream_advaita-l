Namaste,

I am Vijayaraghavan Bashyam and my family hails from tirukkuDandai
(Kumbhakonam). I am currently a PhD student at UCLA. My interests are
primarily in trying to understand the positions of Sri Sankara's
followers on certain particular aspects of the karma kANDa. Although
slightly deviant from the mainstream topics, I hope that the archives
and future discussions answer my questions.

Regards
Vijay
