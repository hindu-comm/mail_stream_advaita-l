We welcome again Smt. Yasodha Sundaralingam, who used to be a member of the 
Advaita-L list. She has rejoined the list after a break, with the following 
introduction.

I have been a student of Swami Chimayanandaji and Swami Tatwanandaji for 
more than 2 1/2 decades. In fact I did join your list when we were in Lyon 
and my husband was working for Interpol. I was pretty regular in 
partcipation during those years - from the nineties upto 2000. Then we 
shifted to Madras- amd my teacher SW.Tatwanandaji was ill for nearly 2 1/2 
years. As such, totally immersed in serving/caring him - I sort of gave up 
my link with the list. Again the last 2 years were spent getting Swamiji's 
samadhi built and now I am keen to renew my association.

I have always enjoyed the participation and also the thought provoking 
articles that used to appear in this list.
