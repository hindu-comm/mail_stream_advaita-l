Thank you for your mail asking me to give a small introduction of myself.

I am a Telugu Brahmin hailing from Tiruchirapalli Town (Tamil Nadu).  I am 
employed in Jawaharlal Nehru University since 1973.  Our family deity is 
Turaiyur Govindaraja Perumal and Padmavathy Devi.

At JNU Campus, with a few like minded persons we as a group used to recite 
Vishnu Sahasranamam every Saturday along with Suktas, etc.  but this got 
terminated when a few members retired and left the Campus and myself moving 
out to my own flat.  However, the practice of house recitation still 
continues.  At JNU, had the fortune of anniversary of Satsang held 
rotationally in every member's house when certain havans were held besides 
recitation.  On a weekly basis one of the member, well versed in Sanskrit, 
Kannada, Hindi and English used to give discourse on the namavali and later 
on other aspects of Veda.

Subsequently with the starting up of Sanskrit Centre at JNU, got acquainted 
with scholars who specialize in Indian philosophy.  This prompted me to look 
for people and institutions where from I could understand a few more issues 
- I would like to call it as a self-educating experience than becoming a 
scholar, but perfecting myself with right way of life.

Shall be grateful if you could provide me that opportunity.

R Venkateswaran
