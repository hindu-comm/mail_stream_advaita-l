THere is a commonly quoted maxim that is said to concisely digest advaita,  
"Brahma Satyam Jagan Mithya Jivo Brahmaiva Na Aparah," roughly, "Brahman  alone 
is real, the world is mithya (neither real nor unreal) and, the individual  
soul is no different than Brahman" 

1. I don't believe this assertion comes from Sankara himself. Does anyone  
indeed know the origin of the phrase? and 
2. What discussion within any of Sankara's Bhasya BEST deals with  "Jivo 
Brahmaiva Na Aparah?
