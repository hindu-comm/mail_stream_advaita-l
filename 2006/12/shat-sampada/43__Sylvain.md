According to a sanskrit dictionary, "satsampada" (shat-sampad) is a vedAnta notion. Is it ?

However, we can't find datas on the Web about "satsampada", "shat sampada", "shat sampad".

How would you translate this notion in English ?
And how would you translate in English the 6 sampada : sama, dama, uparati, titiksA, shraddhA, et samAdhAna ?
