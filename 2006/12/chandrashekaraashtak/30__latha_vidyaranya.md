  namaste sri anandji,
  your translation is very apt and beautiful. i hope u have translated all the verses and please post them here once again. my translation is very crude and and was done using dictionary for various words, not out of any command over sanskrit language. 
  i request you, anandji, once again to please oblige us with translation of the complete stotra.
  thanking you in anticipation,
  hari om
  namste
