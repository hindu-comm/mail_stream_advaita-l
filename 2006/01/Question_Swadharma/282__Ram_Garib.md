Bhagvat Gita has been interpreted differently by
different commentators. However as moderators have
pointed out that this list is committed to the
teachings of shankara. In this context, as far as my
understanding of shankara goes, he has interpreted
"swadharma" as duties enjoined by ones' caste and
station in life.

With regards,
Ram Garib
