With *humility*  I  would  say there is no religion  with  wrong
credentials.  I  also  doubt the  symbolic  status  of a foreigner.  As
far  as I know  there  is no  Acharya  who has thought on these lines. The
Jagadguru's have never approached interpreting dharma that way and even
Paramacharya of Kanchi. There are many more examples what we can give.
Please go through the Hindu Dharma by Paramacharya, ( where he speaks
elaborately it is also available online) and I also support views of Jaldhar
and Sanjay and opine that it would be better for ourselves to introspect.

Reagards
