ITRANS gives some options which will lead to further confusion. For instance
nArAyaNaH  - naarAyaNaH; both with come out correctly in the software.
We can simplify by removing those options and therby the ambiguity.
Also, I remember there was some backward compatbility with (^N and
~N). In the case of anusvara, ".n" does not come out well when it is
at the end - like nArAyaNaM is better than nArAyaNa.n  and in the same
vein it does better phonetically  when it is inbetween Sa.nkaraM. But
Sa.nkaraM can be written better as SaN^karaM.
