I have some confusion here and request clarification.

This particular modification of mind which has been
called "akhandaakaara vritti" is also a vritti, isn't
it? Since a vritti can occur only in mind, how can it
be called non-intellectual? "manasa eva
anudrashtavyam" clearly rules out any mysterious
connotations associated with self-knowledge. Only
thing that differentiates self-knowledge from others
is the nature of akhandaakara vritti which does not
have a subject-object relationship.
