Probably not. See my doubts below.

In case of vedas, the premise is that they are
apaurusheya and hence the onus is on the opponent to
prove otherwise. (This is not a flawless argument as
Gangeshopaddhyaya has shown in Tattvachintamani.
However, let us assume it to be flawless for the time
being). 

For the semitic scriptures, the premise is not
apaurusheyatva but revealed status. Therefore, if I
argue for their apaurusheyatva, the onus is on me to
prove their apaurusheyatva. If one the other hand I
consider them "flawless" because of them being
revealed by a "flawless God", I run into a cyclical
argument. Flawlessness of an authored text cannot be
established logically unless I prove through some
other source the flawlessness of the author or
alternatively I accept "flawless-ness" of the author
also on axiomatic grounds.

I agree with you. There are no easy answers here.
