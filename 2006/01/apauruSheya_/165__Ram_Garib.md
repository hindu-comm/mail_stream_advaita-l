OK. I should have been more careful:-) 

shankara does not in fact treat it as "faith" but as
"faith which can be verified subsequently through the
fruit of jivanmukti". His position would have been
untenable if the "moksha" were an unverifaible state.
However, according to shankara, jivanmukti is
available here and now and hence verifiable.
Therefore, "apaurusheyatva" is more of a postulate
which can be confirmed by following the prescribed
path and hence not a blind faith.

That said, it is obvious to any student of shankara
that his treatment of "apaurusheyatva" of vedas is
very un-shankara-like. It leaves scope for future
interpretations and lacks the rigor of logic applied
elsewhere.
