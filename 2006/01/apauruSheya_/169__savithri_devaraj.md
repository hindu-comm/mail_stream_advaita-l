Namaste all,

Sri gurubhyo namaH
Not to interject here, but a couple of thoughts....

To me, that the vedas are apourusheya, is irrelevant.
There is really no need to prove or verify this. But
that they tell me I am the timeless paramArtha is key.
The purANas talk of Shiva or Ganesha, or viSnu. They
can be traced for authorship and times, but none of
these tell me the ultimate fact that there is an
absolute reality and that is the core of ME. There is
no need to have "faith" in vedas because it is
apaurusheya or because it is believed by the great
sages, etc., but because the subject matter is your
very core of existence. 

This must also be a reason why the truth is
transmitted from a shrotriya, brahmanishta, alive guru
to an eligible student, who realizes then and there
the truth of the statement. The very same brahman who
was in the heart of the original seer of the veda
mantras is also in the guru as well as in the student.
So it can be said - the vedas come from brahman, and
are brahman. 'brahmavit brahmaiva bhavati' - this
knowing (realizing) is not the same as knowing physics
or chemistry, it is more of a becoming.. (if that
makes sense). The knower, the means and the known all
sublate in this experience.

That all of us don't realize this truth immediately by
listening to the mahavAkyas is because of our
ineligibility. I do believe it brings about a certain
transformation/awareness in a keen listener.

my 2 cents,
regards,
Savithri
