i don't think the apauruSheyatva of the veda-s can be
verified 'after jIvanmukti'. for a jIvanmukta, there
is nothing but brahman. where is the question of
veda-s or their authorship? if at all aparuSheyatva is
to be verified, it can be done only by one who is
still in some dvaitAvasthA, probably a very advanced
yogi. there is no action (and hence no verification)
for a jIvanmukta. to my knowledge, apauruSheyatva of
the vedas is an axiom. at most, some arguments can be
given in favor of it. but proving or verifying it
seems impossible.

vAsudevaH sarvaM,
aparyAptAmR^itaH.
