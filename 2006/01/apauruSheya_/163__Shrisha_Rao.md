As unfortunately, your predicament is not unique, and is indeed something

There may be; unfortunately there is a tendency these days among people of 
all stripes (and not just at BHU) to first form the conclusion, by faith

Real scholarship, of whatever persuasion, is always rare.

There are other works by the late B.N.K. Sharma, esp. his `Philosophy of 
Madhvacharya', that might be of interest.
