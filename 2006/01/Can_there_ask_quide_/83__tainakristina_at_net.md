Dear list members,

I can not meditate almost at all, because I have no possibilities to get 
personal teaching and quiding, I only ask "who am I" and thinking 
everything is non-permanent etc. I also repeat Shiva's name and I 
concentrate think Brahma, Vishnu, Shiva.

Sometimes it happen strange thinks and therefore I would ask have there 
any teacher/guru with whom I would ask about experiences. I know as Sri 
Ramana Maharshi teach that everything what human experience is only 
EGO's action but when somekind happen I am not capable to ask "who am I" 
or "to whom this happen" because sometimes it happens states in which I 
cannot think.

I don't know is it correct to ask about meditation or other in this list 
because I have found in this list discuss about sacred teachings and 
nearest about advaita vedanta, so I think would it better to discuss in 
private way with someone teacher/s who read this list!

with regards

taina
