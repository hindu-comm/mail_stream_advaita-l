namo nArAyaNAya!

dear list members,

i've often come across terms like kundalini, chakra-s
etc. in some works on yoga, but i find it difficult to
even accept their existence. though i'm quite
skeptical about tantra stuff (like kundalini,
chakra-s...) in general, repeated reference to these
by shrI rAmakR^iShNa paramahaMsa and svAmi vivekAnanda
force me to stop and ponder over their nature. is
there any reference in sha~NkarAchArya's works (or
that of his followers) which deal with these from a
vedAntic viewpoint? do these actually exist or are
they only symbolic of stages in one's spiritual
journey? 

i'm asking this more out of curiosity than anything
else and hope it does not hurt anyone's beliefs.  

vAsudevaH sarvaM,
aparyAptAmR^itaH.
