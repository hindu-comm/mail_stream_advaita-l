namaste,

There is a book called "Yoga, Enlightenment and Perfection" (published 
by Vidyatheertha Foundation, Chennai) in which Abhinava Vidyateertha 
Mahaswamigal (previous Sringeri jagadguru) has described his experiences 
to one of his disciples. These include ascent of kundalini and some 
description of the chakras. From the description, it seems to me that 
these actually exist, and are not just symbolic. However, they are not 
physical entities inside the body.
