 prapa~nchasAra tantra is believed to be a work of
sha~NkarAchArya. Although there are people who contest
this, it has a commentary by padmapAdAchArya.
Various(like 7 or 8 different ones) commentaries on
the same which were authored in different centuries,
seem to attest that this is infact a work of
sha~NkarAchArya.

 I personally would be doubtful about all of them
being wrong.

saundaryalahari seems to talk about these. This is if
one wants to believe that it is indeed the work of
sha~NkarAchArya.

I think shArada chatushshati, a recent(19th century)
shrIvidya work dedicated to chandra shekhara bhArati
swAmin tries to explain these concepts from a vedAntic
view point. I cant exactly summarize as I did not make
a thorough study of this work. This is published with
English translation by Kalpatharu Research Academy,
Blore.

I am sure you are not talking about their physical
existence.
They are probably concepts similar to the pa~ncha
kosha-s like annamaya kosha.... Anandamaya kosha.
Surely these kosha-s arent something which can be
perceived by the physical eye. Likewise the concept of
these various chakra-s I guess.
