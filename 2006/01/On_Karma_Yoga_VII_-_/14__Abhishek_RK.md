Namaste,
Sorry to interfere in this series. Regarding Sri Murali's mail, to
understand Sri Sankaracarya's teachings one has to go to Sri Acarya's
mUlabhAShyas on the upaniShads, brahmasUtra and gIta in sanskrit. Many of
today's translators have made several errors in conveying the Acarya's
message. Perhaps then doubts of yours such as relating to buddha, karmakAnDa
will get cleared? By the way have you studied any of these prasthAna-traya
bhAShyas?

Regards,
Abhishek
