1. Please use appropriate subject line for your posts. Subject line
should be indicative of the message content. This is especially
important when you reply to digest. Have a subject line "RE: Advaita-l
Digest, Vol 33, Issue 7"  gives no idea to the reader about its
contents.

2. When you reply to a digest, please quote only what is essential. Do
not blindly quote all messages in the digest.

3. Please adhere to the list guidelines and scope. We are quite
flexible, yet, if your post belongs to other specialized lists like
"shrouta", you should consider posting it there.


Thanks.

Ravi
[on behalf of list moderators]
