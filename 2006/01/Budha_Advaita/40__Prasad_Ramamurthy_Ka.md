repeating what is there in the scriptures. If we doubt the very scriptures
that are the foundations  of sanatana hindu dharma then where do we assume
to stand. Vedic Sanction is unquestionable as the Kalpa authorizes us to
animal sacrifice. Hence it is not be questioned. But at the same time we are
accepting the alternatives what acharya Madhwa has given us and hence the
outright rejection of Vedas or vedangas are unacceptable as they undoubtedly
form the foundation of our views. I sincerely hope the satvikas of this
mailing lists are trying to convince the same. With humility I would say
that we do not have any malice towards Buddhism as a whole.

Regards

Prasad Kadambi
