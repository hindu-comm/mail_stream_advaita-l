Then why do Astikas talk so much about Brahman?

This is similiar to the Samkhya/Yoga view that realization comes 
automatically after the mind is stabilized through samadhi.  But this is 
not the Advaitin view.  It is not enough to reach a plateau, one must 
actively _know_.

If Buddha didn't know or refused to say, that is enough to discard him as 
a valid authority by Advaita standards.

Karma Yogis are only a subset of performers of karma.

I don't know exactly what you mean by evolution here, but karma is 
compulsory for anyone who subscribes to the notion "I" regardless of 
whether they accept responsibility or admit it or not.

There are two and only two options as far as karma is concerned.  All 
those who deal with duality must perform their obligatory duties 
regardless of any other disciplines they may take up.  only those who have 
renounced all duality (i.e. sannyasis) are allowed to give up their 
duties.

Brahma sutra 3.1.25 but see my other message for caveats by which Advaita 
Vedanta differs from the strict ritualist emphasis of the Purva 
Mimamsakas.

animal instincts aren't the enemy.  Ego is.

yes they were.
