If it is so, then Shankara would have spoken on it. I think it would be
difficult to accept the concept of shoonya as we have the karma phalas to be
taken along with us even when we leave this world.

Budha generally avoided talking about things that cannot be described by
words.

I don't know on what basis you say this. Because Kalpa the manual of rituals
is not written for a particular person. As far as I know except sannyasins
all other ashrams should conduct the rituals according to shruthi's and
smriti's.

*Yes* as far as i know it is Sanctified. But acharya's like madhwa has told
that we can use other materials as a substitute and it is also said that
animal sacrifice is vyarjya in kali yug.
