Karma phalas no longer affect a person who has gone beyond the mind.
  Karma Kanda rituals is only for beginners in the path. Cannot and need not be followed by advanced seekers as expoused in Gita itself. Nor feasible in Kaliyuga esp with shortage of time and money.
Animal sacrifices were performed by tribals and the like who anyway wanted to eat meat so were made to sanctify the meat by offering it to their deity first. It was just a method to get them to consume it as prasad so as to maybe lessen the sin and to gradually drag them away from the tendency.
  By ignorant persons I meant those who do rituals for rituals sake without trying to understand the significance of it.

If it is so, then Shankara would have spoken on it. I think it would be
difficult to accept the concept of shoonya as we have the karma phalas to be
taken along with us even when we leave this world.

Budha generally avoided talking about things that cannot be described by
words.

How can we conclude ?

I don't know on what basis you say this. Because Kalpa the manual of rituals
is not written for a particular person. As far as I know except sannyasins
all other ashrams should conduct the rituals according to shruthi's and
smriti's.

*Yes* as far as i know it is Sanctified. But acharya's like madhwa has told
that we can use other materials as a substitute and it is also said that
animal sacrifice is vyarjya in kali yug.

*Sorry* I did not get to whom you are referring here.
