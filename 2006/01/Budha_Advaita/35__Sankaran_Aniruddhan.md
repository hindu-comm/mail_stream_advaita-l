namaste Sri murali mohan,

I don't think it is necessary to assume that both Sankara and Buddha 
were enlightened in the same way. It is perfectly possible for both to 
be 'enlightened', Buddha in the buddhist way, and Sankara in the vedic 
way. It all depends, I suppose, on which tradition we follow. According 
to those who follow the vedantic tradition, the vedic way of 
enlightenment is the only true, ultimate one (and of course, according 
to the buddhists, their nirvana is the ultimate realisation). The only 
way to compare the 'enlightenment' of anyone inside or outside the 
tradition is to compare their teachings/experiences with those described 
in the vedas (and of course, interpreted according to Sankara). As far 
as I can see, they seem to be quite different.

The Buddha was called SAkya muni, not Sankya muni. He belonged to the 
SAkya clan of rulers of nepAl, hence the name. The sAdhana described in 
the gIta is called sAnkhya, which is different.

As far as I know, the bare minimum traditional AchAryas expect for 
laypeople is regular performance of daily sandhyAvandanam. Regular 
practice of brahmayajnam and the fire ritual is also considered to be 
essential.
