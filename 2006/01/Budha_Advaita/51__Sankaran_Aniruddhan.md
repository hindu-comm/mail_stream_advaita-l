But, the vedas spend thousands of words talking about brahman. Is all 
that useless? It is not possible to describe brahman directly, however 
it is possible to indicate indirectly. And most importantly, one should 
start off by first asserting the existence of brahman, which the Buddha 
never did. In contrast, for example the bhrguvalli in the Taittiriya 
Upanishad asserts right in the 3rd line "satyam jnAnam anantam brahma", 
listing out a possible "definition" of brahman.

Every AchArya in the sankaran tradition to this day have said that 
performing obligatory karma regularly is essential in spiritual progress.

Actually, I believe sankara has supported animal sacrifices in his 
brahmasutrabhashya. More knowledgeable members can confirm/deny this.

Again, the traditional analysis procedure assumes that the vedas do not 
contain cryptic/symbolic language unless the direct interpretation leads 
to a logical contradiction.
