The Vedas and other scriptures such as Upanishads and Gita are not only for the action oriented but addresses and provide guidance for people of all tempermants, the extroverts and the introverts. It provides both pravRtti and nivRtti margs and clearly explains pravRtti is for the starters but the goal is nivRtti .

One of the important goals of veda is: to provide
guidance
with jnAna and vijnAna to the action oriented,
pravRtti 
dominated section of society.

To use jnAna to instill nivRtti at a time when action,
and
pravRtti are needed is to lead a person against the
path of
the vedas. Whether one uses scriptures that claim
ultimate
reality as "shUnya", or "brahma", to bring about this
effect 
is irrelevant (in my opinion).

(Imagine if shrI kRSNa had used his wisdom to persuade
arjuna to giveup war and take up samnyAsa ....)
