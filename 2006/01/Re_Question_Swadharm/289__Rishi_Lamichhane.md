Dear Anantharamanji,

When I talk about transmission, I don't mean a specific formal
initiation or anything of that sort. I am referring to simply being
told  "you have do this". So essentially I agree that if you are aware
you have a nitya karma, you have to do it.

However, for something to be a nitya karma it has to be more or less a
living tradition (at least practiced 2-3 generations ago) and not one
that ceased to be observed many generations ago. You cannot be obliged
to find out about what your family did as nitya karma many generations
ago - among other things, it might impossible to find out. I'm not
saying you can't or you shouldn't, but you definitely are not obliged
to do so.

"Your interpretation would also mean that if one individual in the
line breaks the communication/transmission/initiation rule, then all
subsequent generations are de jure prevented from the performance of
nitya karmas altogether.  This is perhaps being far fetched."

Here I believe you have misunderstood my point. Assuming the person is
still an adhikari in the general sense, one can do the actions which
one's ancestors did as nitya karma. However, since one is doing
something that has not been practiced for a relatively long time (as
nitya karma anyway), it cannot be considered a nitya karma, but its a
karma like other karmas - its not obligatory.

However, I agree that it cannot be enough for just one individual to
break the line - it has to be a general breakage at some point in
one's extended family/community (not just immidiate family). The point
is that if no one in one's family practices a karma or has practiced a
karma for two or three generations, it cannot be considered a nitya
karma (even if you somehow came to learn that  four generations ago it
was). You can however choose to do the karma for punya and to keep the
tradition alive, which would be very commendable,

Again this is only an opinion but this is how I have been taught,

Regards,

RIshi.
