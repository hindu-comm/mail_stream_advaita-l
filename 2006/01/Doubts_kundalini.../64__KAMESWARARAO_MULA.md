Dear Arunkumar,
                            With ref to your qustion that chakras do really exist here is my explanation. Offcourse these are symbolic stages of spirtual journey, if you want to see with naked eyes, you cannot see those things. These chakras are the state of your conciousness about the nature, cosmosis and your self. Realized persons (One who understands him self completely and about the nature) can easily see some lower chakrs with the garce of SRIGURU. The so called Bioenergy i.e KUNDALINI stays in muladhara as a serpent (3.5 coils turned) with a face downwards. Once it becomes upwards, then one can easily believe or get into cotnact of these chakras.
  For all these to talk or discuss one has to find his SRIGURU.

  sincerely

  namo nArAyaNAya!

dear list members,

i've often come across terms like kundalini, chakra-s
etc. in some works on yoga, but i find it difficult to
even accept their existence. though i'm quite
skeptical about tantra stuff (like kundalini,
chakra-s...) in general, repeated reference to these
by shrI rAmakR^iShNa paramahaMsa and svAmi vivekAnanda
force me to stop and ponder over their nature. is
there any reference in sha~NkarAchArya's works (or
that of his followers) which deal with these from a
vedAntic viewpoint? do these actually exist or are
they only symbolic of stages in one's spiritual
journey? 

i'm asking this more out of curiosity than anything
else and hope it does not hurt anyone's beliefs. 

vAsudevaH sarvaM,
aparyAptAmR^itaH.
