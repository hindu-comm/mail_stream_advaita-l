That may be but this discussion is veering away from the focus of this 
list which is Advaita Vedanta.  All participants: kindly stay on 
topic.  Manish: you seem to be quite mistaken about what Advaita Vedanta 
is all about.  May I suggest you peruse the Advaita Vedanta Home Page 
(http://www.advaita-vedanta.org/avhp/) for a better grasp?
