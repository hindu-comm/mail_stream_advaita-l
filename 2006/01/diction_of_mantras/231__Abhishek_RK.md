Namaste,

Indeed shlokas authored by various authors can be read and pronounced
varyingly. But the same cannot be said of mantras from vedas as these must
be learnt from a competent Guru and pronounced exactly as per swara and
other rules. With regard to mantras from the vedas there is no other option
but to learn from a Guru. But for shlokas and prose like purANas,
viShNusahasranama, itihAsas etc one generally need not go to a Guru to
learn. But a mantra to be used in japa must generally be given by a Guru as
its power wil be more.

Regards,
Abhishek
