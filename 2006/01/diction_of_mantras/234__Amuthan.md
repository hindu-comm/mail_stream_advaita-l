fine, do what pleases you, but then don't add an
'advaitin' or 'vedAntin' tag to yourself. the above
frame of mind would more appropriately fit to one
following zen than one following sha~Nkara's advaita
vedAnta. as far as vedAnta is concerned, this 'no
philosophy, no scripture' stuff is only for a
jIvanmukta. remember that what you have said above is
also a philosophy in itself (and it is called
shUNyata)! strictly speaking, having no philosophy is
possible only when your mind is destroyed and that
happens only if you are a jIvanmukta, never otherwise.
