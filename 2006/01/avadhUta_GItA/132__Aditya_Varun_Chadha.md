Please explain step 3 above to bring out crisply the difference
between ajAtivAda and buddhism's sUnyatA.

by step 3, is it meant that there is no DIFFERENCE between God and
creation, or that neither exist independantly and there is only one
underlying substrate? to the untrained eye it does seem to be saying
that NOTHING exists, which is sUnyatA (buddhism)
