Namaste,

Shista means:

na pANipAda capalo na netra capalo yati:|
na ca vAkcapalaScaivamiti SiShThasya lakShaNam||

He will not be restless with his hands or legs; he will be self-controlled;
he will not be restless in his talk- such are the qualities of a SiShTha.

The actions and behaviour of such a person is SiSThAcAra. It is up to us to
rise to such a level. Also refer SrI kRShNa's statement in gIta 3.21 that
"Whatever a great man does, that very thing others also do; whatever
standard he sets, the generality of men follow also".

Regards,
Abhishek
