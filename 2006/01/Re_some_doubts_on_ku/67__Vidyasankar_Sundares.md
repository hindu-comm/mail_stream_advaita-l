Amuthan, turn to chapter 8 of gItA and compare SankarAcArya with madhusUdana 
sarasvatI here, especially verses 8.10-12. Also see chAndogya and 
bRhadAraNyaka verse, SataM caikA ca hRdayasya nADyas tAsAM mUrdhAnam 
abhiniHsRtaikA ... I believe the later yoga/tantra descriptions of kundalini 
emerge from some of the upanishadic meditations (upAsana-s) on saguNa 
brahman.
