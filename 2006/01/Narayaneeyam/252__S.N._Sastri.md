I wish to bring to the notice of the members the English translation of an
elaborate Malayalam commentary on Narayaneeyam of Narayana Bhattatiri on <
http://www.narayaneeyam.com>

 The vedantic import of the Slokas has been explained in a detailed manner
in the commentary and so it is of great interest to students of vedanta.
