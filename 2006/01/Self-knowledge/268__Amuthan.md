i earlier wrote:
'if you call........special knowledge chaser !'

it should have been:
'if you call........special knowledge chaser :-)'

it was (obviously?) a sarcastic statement! i just got
the ending wrong :-) what i meant to say is that any
reason that you give for choosing that special
knowledge can be given for chasing that special
experience. of course, the limitations of that
experience have been adequately addressed in the other
mail on self knowledge addressed to shrI S.N.shAstrI. 

anyway, back to your mail,

*all* experiences also includes deep sleep (suShupti).
there in no way except by nirvikalpaka samAdhi that
the truth spoken by the shruti-s can be seen during
suShupti.

and what makes you think that *everyone* 'chasing'
nirvikalpaka samAdhi 'fancies the truth in only
certain experiences and misses it in the rest of the
experiences'??? that is certainly not correct.
*please* see the other mail where MS clearly shows the
limitations of a mere attainment of nirvikalpaka
samAdhi.
