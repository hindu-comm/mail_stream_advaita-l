if you call one trying for nirvikalpa samAdhi as a
special experience chaser, then, one who learns
vedAnta is a special knowledge chaser! to get things
cleared about the role of samAdhi, please refer to the
other mail on self knowledge addressed to shrI
S.N.shAstrI. for everyone other than a uttamAdhikAri,
nirvikalpaka samAdhi is necessary, though that alone
is not sufficient.  

what you have said about cessation of thoughts is
incorrect. please have a look at shruti-s like,

'yachChedvA~NmanasI prAj~naH
 tadyachChejj~nAna Atmani.
 j~nAnamAtmani manati niyachChet
 tadyachChechChAnta Atmani' (ka. up. 1.3.13)

what you have said is true *only* for a brahmavit, not
for anyone of lower standards.
