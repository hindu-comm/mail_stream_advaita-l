Pranams!

Dear sir, if I read you right, I do think you do attach too much importance
to this trifle called the intellect!

Let me illustrate!

You consider love to be part of the manas? I think you are watching too much
Discovery and reading too little Rumi! :-)IMHO, it is like putting the
proverbial cart before the horse! Love commands, the intellect obeys. Why,
then do we say, quite truly, - love is a madness! In madness, where is the
room for the intellect to function? Why does a mother love her ugly son
while the world wonders - "what does she see in him?" Can the intellect even
begin to comprehend this thing called love - it would only be a naive one to
accept this. Love is transcendantal. Love is.

Take faith now. How does one explain it? The intellect is merely a register
to record its presence but it stems from a higher power. How did Nag
Mahasaya (a householder disciple of Sri Ramakrishna) make the ganges flow
out from his garden with nothing but faith? Why do they say - faith can move
mountains and Moses proved it! It lies in the intellect since poor humans
have just that faculty to know things but it is something much much bigger!

Sanjay mentioned intution. I think the same applies. Intution lets the
intellect take a 'firm conviction' if that is what you like to call it
Intution is higher than intellectual understanding. "I know this must be
true", one says without justification or reasoning or in most cases against
reasoning? How?

And last, let us take your erstwhile Jnani. Well, all the fellow (or felli)
can do is say that 'truth' can't be this, can't be that (Neti, Neti) till
s/he reaches a point where there is a flash of "reality" and all falls into
place. S/he cannot really intellectually understand truth anyway!

Please don't misunderstand me by thinking I attach less importance to Jnana
(or else I would not be on this list) but lets not lose sight of the bigger
picture - truth or love is bigger, grander and more inexplicable than any of
us!

Humble pranams, Mahesh
