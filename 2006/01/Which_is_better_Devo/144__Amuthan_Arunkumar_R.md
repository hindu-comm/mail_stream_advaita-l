what exactly is your point regarding the vaiShNava
schools' view of bhakti? i don't quite get your
argument here.

first of all, it is not correct to say that the bhakti
taught in the gItA goes against that taught in
non-advaitic vaidika darshana-s. secondly, i really
don't see any reason for speculating that the bhakti
taught in other schools is because of some foreign
influence. what is the basis for such an assertion?
