what you are saying must be correct. after all the jIvanmukta-s are
established in brahman already. actually I have probably used the
wrong word here (karma). I think karma means an action that has
consequences.  ofcourse for a jIvanmukta there is no more karma to be
performed, or in another sense, all actions of the jIvanmukta are
"inconsequential" because the establishment in brahman is already
completely realised.

this brings up a deeper confusion that I have: is a jIvanmukta "a
realiser of saguNa brahman only" or of nirguna brahman?

another doubt is: for an aj~nAnI, is bhaktI a karma? is "meditation" a
form of bhaktI? is this "meditation" a karma for the aj~nAnI? it is
evident from your statement that for a jIvanmukta these are definitely
not "karmas" that attract karmaphalas. but what about for an aj~nAnI?
