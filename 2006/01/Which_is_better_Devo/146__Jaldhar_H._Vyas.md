Shankaracharya wrote many beautiful bhakti-filled stotras.  Some 
historians doubt their authenticity but Shankaracharyas attitude towards 
Bhakti is crystal-clear if you read the Bhashya on Brahmasutra 2.2.42.  In 
this and the next few sutras, Shankaracharya refutes Vaishnavism but he is 
at pains to note that he is not against the idea of treating Vasudeva as 
the Lord, pradakshina of His murti, singing of stutis to Him etc. but only 
the philosophical aspects such as e.g. the 4 vyuha theory of the Pancharatra 
Agamas.
