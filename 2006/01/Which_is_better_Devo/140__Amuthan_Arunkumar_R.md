where did you find this explanation? i think it is not
correct. bhakti is NOT some form of karma (though we
aj~nAni-s often mistake it to be so). it is more
related to our own svarUpa (...svasvarUpAnusandhAnaM
bhaktirityabhidhIyate). consider shruti-s like 'raso
vai saH. rasagm hyevAyaM labdhvAnandI bhavati' (tai.
up.). the bhakti that jIvanmukta-s do is the same as
being established in brahman. shrImadbhAgavatam
clearly brings out this in the shloka 'AtmArAmAshcha
munayo nirgranthA apyurukrame. kurvantahaitukIM
bhaktimitthaM bhUtaguNo hariH..'

amuthan.
