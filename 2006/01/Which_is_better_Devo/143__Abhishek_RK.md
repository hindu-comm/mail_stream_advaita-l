Namaste,

Bhakti is involved both in karma and jnAna. Without bhakti noone would do
their nitya-karmas and no jnAni would be established in brahma. What is
defined in vaiSNava schools of bhakti is probably out of line of the
traditional teachings of AcArya Sankara. Also the gIta and other texts speak
of bhakti which is entirely different from that in the non-advaiti schools
which is probably an effect of the foreign religions but nowhere in the
advaiti school is such bhakti discouraged. Probably this speaks of the
open-minded nature of the AcArya's teachings. After all didn't He make the
several schools of His time to bow to the vaidika mode of worship without
seriously making them go away from their native traditions!

Regards,
Abhishek
