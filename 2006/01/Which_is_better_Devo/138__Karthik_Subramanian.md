  Dear members,

  Can somebody please clarify this query of mine. Which is better? Devotion or Self-realisation? I have read the biographies of several great masters, who have indeed realised the Self, but yet remain devoted to their Ishtadevata. For example, all of us know about Sri Abhinava Vidya Tirtha Swamiji of Sringeri Sharada Peetam. His biographies and many other books say he had mastered all yogic practices and realised the Self by the time he was 20 years old. This being so, whenever Swamiji used to return from any yatra, he used to literally hasten to have darshan of Sri Sharada. This can be even said of Sri Sacchidananda Shivabhinava Narasimha Bharathi Swamiji, who is considered as the incarnation of Sri Adi Shankara Bhagavadpada. Even his biographies say that he used to be immersed in samadhi many times, many times even at the cost of performing the pujas. But yet, in one of the stotras he has composed, he complains to Sri Sharadamba asking Her why does She keep sending him out on
 yatras, even though he would rather remain at Sringeri itself, performing the Goddess' puja.

  Upon reading these instances, sometimes there is a confusion caused in the mind regarding the greatness/betterness of Bhakti or Atmajnana.

  Request the group members to please clarify this (probably stupid) question of mine.

  Regards,
Karthik
