Namaste

Self-knowledge has to be intellectual. Unless you define intellectual
knowledge as something related to objective sciences.

Subject: the nature of Atma j~nAna (was Re: [Advaita-l] GITA - 2.21)

namo nArAyaNAya!

dear list members,

there seems to be some difference of opinion regarding
the nature of self knowledge (Atma j~nAna). i'm of the
opinion that Atma j~nAna is non-intellectual. it's our
svarUpa lakShaNa. apparently, some revered svAmi-s are
of the opinion that self knowledge is intellectual.
let's get things straight. i request the learned
members to share their understanding of this issue -
is self knowledge intellectual? 

vAsudevaH sarvaM,
aparyAptAmR^itaH.
