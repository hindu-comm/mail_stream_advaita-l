Its true
that its taken from various parts of Vedas.

praNAms
Hare Krishna

I think apart from vEda maNtras one can find slOka-s (from purANa-s/smruti
texts)  as well in mahanyAsaM...for example...gamAgamsthaM gamanAdi shUnyaM
chidrUpa rUpam thimirApahAraM etc. in apratiratha kavachaM, shodashAnga
raudrIkaraNAm, diksaMputanyAsaH...etc. etc. we can find lot of verses which
are not vEda maNtra-s.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
