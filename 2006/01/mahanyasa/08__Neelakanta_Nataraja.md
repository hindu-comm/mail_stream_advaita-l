Dear Prashant,

I would like to add few more things to what Bhaskar has said. Its true
that its taken from various parts of Vedas. For example, there is a set
of mantras starting from :

Aashushisshhano vrishabho na yudhmo ...

Its found both in Rig and Yajurveda. I do not know where it comes in
Yajur, but it comes in 10th mandala, 103rd suktha of Rigveda samhita. 

I had already spoken about Shivasankalpa. And as many of you are aware
of , Namah shambhave cha ... In sri rudram describes the face of lord
Shiva, that is why it comes very often in Mahaanyasa.

BR,
nattu

Dear nattu,

please explain me more about mahanyasa,I searched net using
google but couldn't find anything.even i came to know that 
books with
meaning or description are not available in bangalore 

do you know about
good books in english or kanada ? or website ?

praNAms
Hare krishna

Sri Ramakrishna Mutt has published mahanyAsAdi maNtrAH in kannada you
can
ask at Basavangudi...mahanyAsa mainly consisting of namaka (shatra
rudrIya/rudra prashna ) maNtra-s....its mainly all about  glorification
of
rudra.  So far I dont see any commentary on this mahanyAsa maNtra bhAga
since, it is,  I believe a collection of  maNtra-s from various parts of
vEda.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!
bhaskar
