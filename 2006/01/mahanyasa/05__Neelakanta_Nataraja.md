Dear Mr. Prashant 

Mahaanyaasa is the elaborated nyaasa what you do before chanting Sri Rudram. There are 2 versions of Mahaanyaasa. Boudhaayanoktha and Raavanooktha. Raavana was the person who laid out the rules for Mahaanyaasa. Boudhaayana has elaborated on the same. 

It describes various angaas of Parameshwara. It's a beautiful art, because it has a section called Shiva sankalpa. It describes each and everything to be a shiva sankalpa. 

More details, if needed in the next mail.

BR,
nattu
