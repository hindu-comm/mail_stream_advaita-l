My name is Sanaka BT Roberts and I live in the United States. My age
is 52. I have been interested in Yoga, meditation for many years. I
have read books about Sri Ramana Maharshi, Ramakrishna and study the
Upanishads, Bramasutras, Gita. I am interested in Advaita vedanta
therefore.

I have a doctor of divinity degree and practice the healing arts.

Thank You

Sanaka
