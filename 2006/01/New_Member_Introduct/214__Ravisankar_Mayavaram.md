Dear Sir,

I am a grahasta from Smartha Mulukunadu (Munikulanadu) brahmin family
of Yajurveda Apastamba sutra and Kashyapa gothra, and  based at
Singapore for the past three years. My name is Ravi Seshadri and I am
32 years old. I have been doing adhyayan of vedanta philosophy as an
amateur and seek the guidance and support of an organization like this
mailing list.

I humbly request you to include me in the mailing list.

With warm regards
SAIRAM

Ravi Seshadri
