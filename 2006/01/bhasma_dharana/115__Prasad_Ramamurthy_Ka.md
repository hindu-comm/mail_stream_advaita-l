It is said that;

bhasmanA shudhyatE kamsaym taamramAmlena shudhyate !
gomyena shudyate bhOmi nAristhu rajasa thatha !!


The body/mind gets purified by bhasma, copper utils can be purified by
tamarind, with the cow's dung the earth gets purified and women purifies by
the periods she would have.

I'm not aware of any Shruthi or Smriti references.

Regards.

Prasad Kadambi
