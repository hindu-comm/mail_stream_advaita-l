Is there any shruthi pramana for bhasma dharana. My
wife is a Madhva by conviction and she says that
wearing bhasma is nishiddha according to Varaha Purana
and that there is no shruthi basis for it either.

 I found some verses on the net from some puranas
giving the bhasma-dharana-vidhi. But I would like some
direct Shruthi or Smriti quotes. I would be much
obliged if some one can provide a detailed answer.

Thanks and regards
Sthanu
