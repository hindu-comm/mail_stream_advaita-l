Well I do agree with Arun, what should we expect with devotees carrying
tampura against armed mughals. But at the same time why sould we not take it
in the other sense that fight need not be physical. Any spritual seeker
should fight with the nature both internal and external.

Are we not seeing Jayendra Sraswathi fighting though he being a sanyAsi.
What all I mean to say is fight need not be physical.

P.S:

Last but not least does every saint, mahaAthma, sanyAsi , JAni *owe* an
explanation to this world .

Regards.
