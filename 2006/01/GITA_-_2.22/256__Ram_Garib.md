I have a doubt and request clarification.

Here gItAchArya uses the word "dehI" instead of
"AtmA". Is this use intentional or un-intentional?
Reason for my doubt is this - If self is said to be
changeless without any vikaara, how can it
re-incarnate? "dehI" here would fit more aptly with
sukshma sharira or karana sharira rather than the
usual meaning of "self". 

However, the usual meaning would be perfectly
consistent with previous "na jaayate mriyate.." verse.

With regards,
Ram Garib
