I think dehi is used in the sense that the jIvAtma is the adhidevata of deha
(human body), i.e., it is the cetana in the body. Also SrI krShNa in the
10th chapter (vibhUti yoga) refers that He (pramAtma) is the cetana in
bodies. So probably the one Atma is said here to be the adhiShTAna in the
body. Sorry for rambling.
