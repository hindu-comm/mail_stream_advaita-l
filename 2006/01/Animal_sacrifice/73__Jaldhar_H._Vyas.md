This doesn't sound right to me (atleast in relationship to kamya karmas.) 
Where in the brhadaranyakopanishadbhashya are you refering to?

Are you referring to what he calls kamavilayavada?  That's different.  The 
proponents of that theory want to enjoy karma for the express purpose of 
giving it up later because, they think, the more you give up, the greater 
the effect of its' renunciation.  This is wrong because jnana cannot 
depend on doing any amount of karma.

But kama by its very definition involves desire.  You only perform kamya 
karmas if you desire some result.
