Sureshvara, in his vaartika, explicitly mentions the theory that
kaamaya karmas should be given up and refutes it. They should actually
be done without desire. It may seem like a contradiction even with the
name kaamya, but the point is that results accrue *only* if done with
that desire in mind. This is where advaita differs quite a bit from
other schools.

The desire is what is to be given up, not the karma.

  Appaiya Diksita too takes a similar view, if i remember correct.   



Thanks & Regards,
