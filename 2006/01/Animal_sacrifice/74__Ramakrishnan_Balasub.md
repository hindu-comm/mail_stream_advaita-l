No. That's not what I am talking about. That's quite different. I
don't remember the verses offhand. I'll have to hunt for them. But I
believe it's the sambandha vaartika where the kaamavilayavaada is also
refuted (in some other place). The topic under discussion is what is
the connection between the puurva and uttara bhaagams of the shruti,
which has no connection with kaamavilayavaada.  Sureshvara also refers
to the fact that Sankara takes this topic up for discussion in a later
part of the bhaashya (which is only obliquely refererred to in the
upodghaata).  Will post when I get the chance.

I was under the impression karmas will give results no matter what,
till I read mahaasannidhaanams explanation that the desire has to be
present. Then of course I read the bhaaShyams more carefully and
shankara bluntly ridicules the apuurva theory of the miimaamsakas in
the suutra bhaaShya, which is essential for the theory "karma will
give results no matter what". I also came across those verses in the
vaartika.
