Please do.  After doing a little research I noticed these shlokas in 
the varttika which are perhaps what you are referring to?

Even though the kAmya karmas cannot cause liberation the view [1]
is that they are helpful to a man as a cause of non-attachment [2]

Just as the prohibited actions leads to non-attachment by turning one away 
from that which results in sorrow,[3]

api kAmya.m krta.m sarva.m du.hkhAtmakaphalatvata.h |
Aviri~nchyAtsvakArebhya.h syAdeva vinivrttaye || 1109 ||

So too, knowing kAmya works all eventually lead to results filled with 
sorrow, even upto the world of Virinchi[4], leads to non-attachment.

In order to explain the above concepts, the following is said.[5]
Thus the unity of meaning of the Vedas is established without doubt.[6]

[1] of Shankaracharya

[2] Because even though they are motivated by desire atleast they involve 
asking for the aid of a higher power not pure ego.

[3] Carrying out a prohibition is also an action.  E.g. if you are offered 
meat to eat and refuse.  By means of these prohibitions we wean ourselves 
away from ego.

[4] Brahma.  The highest reward of karma is Brahmaloka but it too leads to 
sorrow because of its transitory nature.  Knowing this makes one turn away 
from kAmya karma too.

[5] In Shankaracharyas' bhashya.  Shankaracharya makes the same point 
though in less detail.

[6] In other words as Ramakrishnan said, both the karma and jnana kandas 
have a single purpose: knowledge of Brahman, though one is indirect and 
the other is direct.

So I suppose this is reassuring to those who still desire but I don't see 
it as providing a carte blanche.  I don't see why this means one shouldn't
avoid desire as much as s possible as Sanjay said.
