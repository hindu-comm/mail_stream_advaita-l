What you state above has been stated as a puurva-paxa by Sankara and
refuted in his bR^ihad bhaaShya.

He states the entire veda has the subject matter as brahman. The
karma-kANDa largely teaches it indirectly (rites and meditation) and
hence is for mind purification *if done without any desire in mind*.
The upaniShads are about meditation (e.g, about vyAhR^itis) which
indirectly teach brahman, and direct j~naana (neti neti, etc).

Both kANDas have only brahman as content, though in a different way.

Sureshvara, in his vaartika, explicitly mentions the theory that
kaamaya karmas should be given up and refutes it. They should actually
be done without desire. It may seem like a contradiction even with the
name kaamya, but the point is that results accrue *only* if done with
that desire in mind. This is where advaita differs quite a bit from
other schools.

The desire is what is to be given up, not the karma.
