Hi Santosh,

     The only thing I have to say is not to worry about anything. Your saying
this thing as to if you can do anything "to reverse the negative effects" makes
you fearful. I will say that those who have said that mantras have any side
effects or this or that then don't get frightened, there is no point in that.
Fear is in the first hand the greatest enemy. The intention in your heart
determines everything. There are endless mantras and hence endless techniques.
Your intention is to realize god then who is going to stop you from that. On
the spiritual path there are endless things and confusions and you may find it
hard at times. The only thing is to keep going in that direction and not to
stop. If you are doing mantras not for your spiritual upliftment and for some
other gains in your mind then it is better to have negative effects so that we
may stop doing it for any other thing except for spiritual growth.

    Also let me tell you about the whole reason to do japa and mantras. It is
only to make your mind calm and attain its purity. All else is mere talk and
other mantras for worldly gains are not going to do any good to you. Sticking
to one mantra or japa has this thought behind it that it tries to throw away
all other thoughts that arise in your mind when you do some kind of japa. Also
it maintains devotion in you and also tries to bring surreneder.

    Japa is helpful to that extent where it may bring to your own inner depths
and tries to calm down the turbulent thoughts that arise in mind. The whole
story is of the mind and to calm it down to the extent where the water of mind
is not disturbed so that you may see beyond it at your own Self. Mind is the
only adjunct beyond which everyone will have to reach to have self realization.
So don't be afraid of anything, whatever is done is done, no fear, no worries,
no one is going to punish you for anything. My suggestion is, if you really
like japa, then stick to one japa of any deity or guru you have enshrined in
your heart. There are no side effects. Is there any side effects of taking the
name of God! Tell me if there is any logic and think for yourself! Mind is very
useful in subsiding mind itself. Taking God's name has a side effect, isn't it a
foolish thought. So remain pure at heart and do your japa whatever you feel like
with all your purity of thought. What else is needed, whom to ask and where to
go. Your own self will lead you to the supreme. The Self is the guru and the
external guru if there is any is also your own Self.
        If you are studying advaita then it will negate everything slowly and
finally accept everything, and that is the way. What else is needed. Keep going
and don't worry about anything. Self is the witness of everything, then where
are side effects brother.

I feel this email maybe of some use.

Pranaam,
Manish Wadhwa
