Dear Ramesh,

I would like to bring to your attention about "Koviloor Matam" in Tamil
Nadu. It may be a good source of getting Tamil versions of works such as
VivekaChudamani etc. Their website (see below) gives contact information.

The Koviloor Adheenam is hailed as the first school to bring out Tamil
versions of texts such as Viveka Choodamani and also teach Vedanta in
Tamil. Although we are attached to the Kanchi Matam, I used to visit
Koviloor as I had stayed nearby in Karaikkudi.

Below is the link to their website and a quote from their website:

http://www.kovilur.com/math.htm

"The Koviloor Aadheenam highly deserves the merit of being called the
First School of systematic Vedantic Studies through the medium of Tamil.
It was the Koviloor Aadheenam that brought out for the first time the
authentic and undistorted Tamil versions of 14 important Vedantic Texts,
which include Vedanta Cudamani, Viveka Cudamani, Pancadasi, Bagavadgita
and Jnanavasishta. The teaching of Vedanta, which started with Sri
Andavar Swamigal, has been maintained in unbroken continuum."

Regards,
Jagan.
