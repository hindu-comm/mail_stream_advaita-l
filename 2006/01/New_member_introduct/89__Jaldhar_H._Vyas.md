Hello,

My name is Andrew Heggie, 48 years of age, residing in Australia. As a
student of the School of Philosophy (founded by Mr. Leon McLaren in
London, and now established in many countries), I often come in contact
with the advaita-vedAnta tradition and would enjoy sharing in
others interest in that tradition.

Please find below the URLs of the School of Philosophy in both London,
and also Perth, Australia, where I reside:

www.philosophywa.com.au

Should you require any further details or information, please let me
know.

Many thanks for your patience,

Andrew Heggie
