My name is Vijayalaxmi Kambhampati. I am 40 years of age and live in 
London United Kindom. My family orginally comes from Andhra Pradesh in 
India and I myself have lived in India and did my schooling in India till 
16 years of Age. I work as a laboratory assistant and I am interested in 
Advaita because my parents follow Adi Sankaracharya's philosophy as much 
as possible.

Best Wishes,
Vijaya.
