Namaskaram,

I am Murali and am an Anaesthesiologist by profession wishing to know more 
about advaita tradition and the teachings of Sri Adi Sankaracharya. Being a 
smartha myself I feel the need to understand the writings and meanings in the 
vedas. I am presently working in the UK and have tried reading some of Sri 
Sanakarachary's works but need assistance in understading certain concepts.
Trust advaita-vedanta.org will guide me in achieving this.

Thanking You,
Muralidhar T.S.
