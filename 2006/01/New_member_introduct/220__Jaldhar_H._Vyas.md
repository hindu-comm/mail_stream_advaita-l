Namaste and pranaam,

          This is Manish Wadhwa, doing my Ph.D in electrical engg. from old
dominion University, Norfolk, Virginia, USA.
My country of residence is India.
Regarding my interests in Advaita Vedanta, then for me it is about BEING, not
about just taking interest or getting intellectually involved. I wanted to
joing this conversation as I felt like. Advaita Vedanta is the last link in the
chain of human evolution and spirituality, and I feel there it propounds the
highest philosophy that man can ever reach. If man has to reach the highest
truth then he will have to cross this chasm and advaita vedanta shows some
light in darkness.

Thanks a lot,
Manish Wadhwa
Norfolk, VA

**
** namaste,
**
** Welcome to Advaita-L. Please send us, within the next two weeks, a
** brief introduction about yourself, giving your name, age, country
** of residence, and explaining your interest and/or background in the
** advaita-vedAnta tradition. We request this information solely as a
** security measure for the purposes of managing this mailing list. It
** is not meant as a test of your sincerity or belief, or to exclude
** anybody.
**
** Please note that you will not be added to the list till such time as
** we receive your introductory email. If we do not hear from you over
** the next two weeks, we will assume that you are no longer interested
** in joining the list and your subscription request will be discarded.
**
** We request you to read the following carefully, to understand more
** about Advaita-L. You can also get a fairly good idea about us by
** browsing through our website, http://www.advaita-vedanta.org, and
** going through our archives at one of the following sites -
**
** http://www.advaita-vedanta.org/lists
** http://www.escribe.com/religion/advaita
**
** 1. Goals of the List
** --------------------
** The purpose of Advaita-L is to discuss advaita-vedAnta as taught by
** SrI Sankara and the smArta sampradAya.  Through these discussions,
** we hope to increase the understanding of our dharma from a traditional
** stand point, which the shankara maTha-s uphold right from the time of
** their inception.
**
**
** 2. List Policies
** ----------------
**
** 1) Advaita-L is a open and largely unmoderated list. You are requested
** to use self-moderation and care while you post your articles.
**
** 2) Discussions of Advaita-L center around advaita-vedanta as taught by
** the Sankara sampradAya.
**
** 3) Articles promoting bhakti within the framework of advaita-vedAnta
** tradition are most welcome.
**
** 4) Discussion of nAstika philosophies such as Buddhism, Jainism, etc.,
** are outside the scope of this list. However, scholarly articles comparing
** these traditions with advaita-vedAnta are permitted. You may send them to
** the list moderators for prior approval.
**
** 5) Focus of the list is also NOT on the new non-dual and neo-vedanta
** teachings. But, scholarly articles comparing these traditions with
** traditional advaita-vedAnta are welcome.
**
** 6) Please make sure that each post is of a reasonable size. If your text
** starts exceeding two to three screen lengths, then it is better to split
** it into multiple posts. When responding to a post made by another list
** member, please quote only the relevant portion instead of the entire
** post. This will give you more room for your own response. If you receive
** the list posts in the digest form, please delete all the other posts from
** your own response.
**
** 7) Please avoid sending attachments and chain letters to the group. Also,
** please make sure that your email software is configured to send your mail
** to the list in the form of pure text.
**
** 8) Rude and offensive postings are not allowed. When you disagree with
** someone, please be polite, impersonal, objective, and to the point. If
** you are offended by any message posted on the list, please contact
** listmaster at advaita-vedanta.org about it. We will try our best to resolve
** the situation.
**
** 9) Administrators of the list reserve the final word on issues like
** acceptability of posts. These decisions will be based on the list
** scope. In case of doubt, knowledgeable members of the list will be
** consulted.
**
**
** With regards,
**
** List Administrators.
