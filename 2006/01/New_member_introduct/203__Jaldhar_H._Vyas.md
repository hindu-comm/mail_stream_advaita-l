I am a avid student of Sanskrit and advaita Vedanta. I am interested in 
obtaining Tamil translations of old Advaitic texts authored by Sri Adi 
Sankara and others. I am also interested in translating some of these 
texts myself and posting them online for the benefit of those who know 
Tamil and Sanskrit. I am currently employed with a private organization in 
Mumbai. My email address is rameshramanan at yahoo.co.uk
