Only in the sense that either a) it purifies and takes
us closer to j~naana (advaita position) or b) performing them avoids
bringing harm, which is in turn essential to get the rewards of kaamya
karma (position of some miimaamsakas). Otherwise why svargakaamo
jyotiShTomena yajeta, sakalam cannot be interpreted in that sense.

That's true only in sha.nkara advaita vedaanta, not most of the other
schools. In fact if the miimaa.msakaa position is appreciated, this
comes as a revelation. As pointed out by Jaldhar and Sanjay, even the
name contradicts the advaitic interpretation, but one has to look
deeply to understand the position of advaita.
