Thanks for the eye-opener about kAmya karmas. It looks like two kinds of people
perform kAmya karmas:

1) One who has desire for svarga performs kAmya karmas in order to attain
svargaloka.

2) One who has no desire for svarga performs the same "kAmya karmas" for
purifying the intellect. In this context, the word "kAmya" is there just
because this karma is "usually" performed by one with desire.

So what if one has not performed a few saMskaaras? According to Gautama
8.22-25, there is no *necessity* for doing all the saMskaaras for one who seeks
mukti. One can perform a few saMskaaras, and then strive to develop the
requisite AtmaguNAH. There is no point claiming that it is "difficult" to
develop AtmaguNAH without saMskaaras - if there's a serious will to develop
them, the divine's ever-flowing grace will show the way. Also, if it were
really the case that there was an inherent difficulty in developing the
AtmaguNAH without the saMskaaras, I don't believe that Gautama would've
specifically mentioned that all the saMskaaras do not have to necessarily be
performed to develop the AtmaguNAH.

My point is - perhaps doing a kAmya karma will help purify the intellect. But
if the same can be obtained by doing only nitya karmas, and then optionally
going on pilgrimages, seeking the blessings of saints, etc. why concentrate on
a specific kAmya karma?

A GaNapati homam or VishhNu sahasranaama homam is indeed an excellent way of
worshipping GaNesha or VishhNu, and is highly recommended by many teachers.

But is it not the case that such homams have become popular nowadays because
most people have virtually abandoned the performance of agnihotra as a nitya
karma? Why not first attempt to do all of one's nitya karmas instead of
concentrating on a kAmya karma?

It is definitely inane to permit slaughter of animals at Christian and Muslim
religious occasions or for personal gratification of taste, but disallow it at
a Hindu sacrifice.

But I don't see how animal sacrifice of all kinds is necessarily "wise". Here
is an instance of Ramana Maharshi assenting that animal sacrifices at a Kali
temple can be stopped:

Extract from "Letters from and Recollections of Sri Ramanasramam" by Suri
Nagamma, pp.184-187:

---
One afternoon while I was thus wandering about with growing anxiety about
Bhagavan's health, I noticed some commotion in the temple of Goddess Kali which
is situated on the roadside between my house and the Ashram. I thought that
some special puja was being performed; when however I heard the bleatings of a
goat, I felt it must be the killing of the goat by way of sacrifice...while
returning home noticed that the idol of Goddess Kali was dripping with blood
and presenting a rather ghastly sight...

That afternoon when there was no one else with Bhagavan, I went to him,
prostrated and stood up before him. He looked at me enquiringly. Nervously I
said, "Goats are being sacrificed at the local Kali temple..." With a tender
look towards me Bhagavan said, "Yes, the bleatings are heard here also, but
nobody takes any action in the matter. What to do?" ... I also told him that
there was a legislation prohibiting animal sacrifices in residential areas and
that our area had recently developed and so some action might be taken...After
hearing me patiently, Bhagavan said, "To ask the devotees is no good. Let us
see if the worshippers heed to our protests. There is no need to be afraid of
speaking to them about this." When Bhagavan spoke thus, I felt I had been given
the strength of an elephant...

...we sent for the temple priests and spoke to them in a very convincing manner
that it might have been in order to perform animal sacrifices when this
locality was deserted with no human habitation around but now that the place
was full of people who had constructed houses and had started living in them
these sacrifices must stop...I told them that the District Collector and other
government officials were due to visit the Ashram shortly and if they persisted
in their activities, I would bring the matter to their notice, as there was
legislation against such sacrifices in residential areas. Out of fear of the
law and the government officers or of Bhagavan, they stopped the sacrifices
forthwith...Bhagavan was pleased when I told him all that had happened. With a
look of approval he said, "That is good. This has been happening for a long
time. No one has taken any interest in the matter. It was getting worse from
day to day. What to do? It has stopped at last."
