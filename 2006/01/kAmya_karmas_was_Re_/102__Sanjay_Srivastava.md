"Animal sacrifice" falls into the purview of state governments. There
is no country wide ban on animal sacrifice. It is banned in Karnataka,
Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat, Kerala, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu and
Pondicherry. There are some other states where it is not banned but
cannot be performed in public places.

Of course in all such cases, the ultimate discretionary authority is
local darogaa.
