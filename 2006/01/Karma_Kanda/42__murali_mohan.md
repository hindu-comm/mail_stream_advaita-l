I have heard some modern scholars and saints talk that the hindu scriptures were tampered with during the Mughal period with the intention of giving predominence to muslim customs and make the hindus of the time weak and accept the islam religion. It seems especially the mimansa part has been affected by the tampering. Could not have practices such as the part on animal sacrifice etc be added during this time to cater to some nefarious purpose? It is said that many of the Upanishads have 
been lost for ever. How do we assure that the Vedas we have now are as it was in the origin and has not been tampered with?
