It is said that Vedas have 2 parts - Sruti and Smriti - Sruti is irrefutable and 
applicable as it is at all times whereas Smriti has to be modified according to the 
needs of the time. Now Karma Kanda (which is part of poorva meemamsa?) is it part of Sruti or Smriti ? 
If Karma Kanda prescribed obligatory duties for all classes of people (other than priestly class and Kings), why was even hearing of Vedas prohibited for low caste people (molten lead poured into their ears even if they accidently happen to hear the chanting) ? Did not everyone had the right to know and practise their obligatory duties?
