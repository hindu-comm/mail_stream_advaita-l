Animal sacrifice was defended by mImA.nsaka-s like Kumaarila (against
Buddhism) few hundred years before Mohammed was born. It is well
attested in itihaasas and puraaNas.

Swami Vivekananda has defended animal sacrifices. In one of his
collected volumes he mentions that someone commented on sacrifice to
Kali and his comment was "A little blood is necessary to compelete the
picture".
