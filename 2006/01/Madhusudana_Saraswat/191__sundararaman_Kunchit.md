Please refer advaita-vedanta.org/Saradambal Sevasamiti trust where there is
a book in acrobat reader form giving summary of Advaithasiddhi and the
introduction gives background about Sri MS Saraswati and also about his
famous books.HH Sivananda group took upon themselves the presentation of Sri
MS Saraswati in Gudarthadipika for Gita commentary and his name became
famous.His Sinddhantabindu and Bhakthirasayanam are worth reading though
difficult.
