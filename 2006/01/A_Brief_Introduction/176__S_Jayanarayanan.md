Thanks for your kind comments. Naturally, it was possible solely due to the
grace of the Supreme Guru.

I'll do a search on the mailing list archives and post the links to the
articles soon.

Good idea, but they all need to be edited for errors first.

I don't know a mImAmsaka's reply to the above, but His Holiness Chandrasekhara
Bharati of Sringeri was once requested by a Christian for some upadesha. HH
replied that God must have given the man birth as a Christian because spiritual
development in that religion would be the best for him, therefore the man must
strive to become a good Christian instead of looking elsewhere. The
conversation is recorded in the book "Dialogues with the Guru".

This from HH is truly amazing, because HH defends the Vedas as being the ONLY
source of dharma on several occasions. Evidently, the conviction that the Vedas
are the source of dharma is for those who are born into the Vedic religion. For
others, the conviction comes from other scriptures, and HH didn't want them to
"change" their religion to an alien one. The gist is that each one must strive
for spiritual development in the religion that one is born into.

It's a mistake, and should correctly read "the body is not cognized during
*all* the three states of being".

I think Jha meant "North Indian" (GauDas) by the term "Aryans". His point is
that a South Indian would not have generally spoken of "One language
AndhradrAviDa", as Telugu and Tamil would've been noted as two separate
languages by a South Indian.
