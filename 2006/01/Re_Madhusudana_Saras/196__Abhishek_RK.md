Namaste Jaldharji,

He was active in social affairs.  He was highly esteemed by the Mughal
> emperor Akhbar and his minister Todarmal and was considered one of the
> sages of the royal court.  He asked them to intercede and prevent Muslim
> fanatics from interfering with Hindu pilgrims to Kashi and other holy
> places.  He is also said to have set up the order of Naga Bawas or armed
> Dashanami sadhus to protect dharma from its enemies. When Sant Tulsidas
> was encountering criticism for translating the Ramayana to the "vulgar"
> language of Hindi (Ramacharitamanasa) Swami Madhusudana came to his
> defence and gave his approval.


In the above MS is said to have began the Naga tradition but when I asked a
Swamiji on this he replied that it was SankarAcArya who did so. Could you
dig up some information on this?

Thanks,
Abhishek
