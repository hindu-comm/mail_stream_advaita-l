Dear List Members,

In BGB 4.5, the acharya explains why is it that Arjuna , and others, do not 
remember their numerous births. The reason, he says, is that the jnanaSakti 
is constrained by dharma and adharma.

Specifically, he says: 'dharmAdharmAdipratibaddhajnAnaSaktitvAt'.

In the 'dharma adharma Adi', what does the 'Adi' refer to? What else, other 
than our actions of dharma and adharma constrain our power of jnana?

Respectfully,
Murali Manohar
