i've seen dr. ramachandran twice here at iit. during
one of his talks on neuroscience (he's an amazing
speaker who keeps his audience always entertained
:-)), he did devote a large time to certain concepts
from indian philosophy like the 'self', 'the dance of
shiva', 'mAyA' etc. he seemed quite supportive of the
advaitic world view and sort of ended his lecture with
that. from all these, i'm led to believe that he has
more than just a curious interest in advaita.

i've not read the book either and probably shrI
jayanArAyaNan can furnish us more details.
