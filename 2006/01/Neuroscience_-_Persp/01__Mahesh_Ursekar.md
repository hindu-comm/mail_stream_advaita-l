Pranams:

I read a brief interview of Dr VSR in the Indian Express and I get the
impresssion that his world view is that "it's all in the brain" i.e. he is
not well versed with Vedantic thought. Since I do not have his book, I am
not able to ascertain this completely. Can you help me?

Humble pranams, Mahesh
