praNAms praveen prabhuji
Hare Krishna

prabhuji which vEda shAkha you belong to ??  If you know kannada I suggest
you to buy yajurvEda prAthah saNdhyAvandana book published by Vishnu
sahasra nAma satsangha, Banashankari (if you are a yajurvEda shAkhAdhyAyi)
where in you can find  bhasma dhAraNa maNtra-s, agni punaHsaNdhAna
mantra-s, yagnOpavIta dhAraNa maNtra  etc.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
