praNAm bhAskar-ji,

Thanks, I wanted some generic ones to refer to someone and also for my academic interest. Mostly, I want to know what all make up the nitya karma, approx listings of things such as arghya, etc. My understanding was specifics can then be handled by respective branch followings. I know Hindu Dharma book of kAnchi paramAcharya has quite a few things, eg.

For myself, I belong to krishNa yajurveda and I can't read kannadA (except in alphabetical bits). We've some of those published in kannadA by rAmachandrApura maTha that we follow. So I intend to get trained once again when I visit my native place :)

shivam shaantam advaitam,
--praveeN

praNAms praveen prabhuji
Hare Krishna

prabhuji which vEda shAkha you belong to ??  If you know kannada I suggest
you to buy yajurvEda prAthah saNdhyAvandana book published by Vishnu
sahasra nAma satsangha, Banashankari (if you are a yajurvEda shAkhAdhyAyi)
where in you can find  bhasma dhAraNa maNtra-s, agni punaHsaNdhAna
mantra-s, yagnOpavIta dhAraNa maNtra  etc.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
