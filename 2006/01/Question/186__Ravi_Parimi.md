Hello,

In Aruna prashna of the taittiriya aranyaka, at various places, there
are verses describing the solar system, aditya and aditi. A part of a
certain anuvaka mentions aditi and the 8 sons she had. I gathered this
from a book that contained translations of all verses of Aruna
Prashna.
It is possible that the Aruna Prashna may answer all of your questions..

I think Sun's name Aditya  is derived from his mother's name - Aditi.
I think this is some construction in Sanskrit where such derivations
are possible. For e.g, kounteya = son of kunti.

Hope this helps,
Regards,
--ravi
