Don't know if you covered this in your class but I thought I'd mention it;
Makarasankranti is referred to, in Gujarati atleast, as uttarayana but the 
true astronomical uttarayana i.e. winter solstice is on December 21st.  Makara 
sankranti is when the sun enters Capricorn a month later.

The Vedic Devas are sometimes ennumerated as 33. 12 Adityas, 11 Rudras, 8 
Vasus, and 2 Ashvinas.  Of these 12 Adityas, Vivasvata or Surya is the 
eldest and hence specially deserves the name Aditya.
