Dear members 
Sri Amuthan Arunkumar wanted to know authentic citations from Sruthy about the KUNDALINI and the CHAKRAS.He can study Thirumoolar`s Thirumandiram,Sri Adi Sankara`s Soundharya Lahari and Sri Lalitha Sahasranamam to get at the correct view of these concepts.They are within the human frame and require deep dwelling to identify them and realise the bliss when the kundalini reaches the Sahasraram at the topmost centre of the human brain.The Tamil poet Avvaiyar also speaks of this in Her Vinayagar Agaval.The whole concept is related to the controlled breathing of air with one pointed devotion to raise the kundalini which is spoken of as a serpent which is asleep in 2 and a 1/2 curls in Mooladhara which is the first chakra which is just above the genitalia.
Krishnamoorthy.
