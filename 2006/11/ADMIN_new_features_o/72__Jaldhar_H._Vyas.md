It has long been requested that we provide some way of reading and posting 
to the list via the web instead of email.

We are pleased to announce that you can now read advaita-l on the web at
GMANE.  As a bonus the list is also availabe via NNTP and RSS. See:

http://dir.gmane.org/gmane.culture.religion.advaita

for details.  Anyone can read but in order to post you must use the 
password to your list membership which was mailed to you after you joined. 
If you have forgotten what it is, you can request a reminder at:

http://lists.advaita-vedanta.org/cgi-bin/listinfo/advaita-l

in the section Advaita-l subscribers.

Also thanks to list member Murali Karamchedu,  we have added the following
