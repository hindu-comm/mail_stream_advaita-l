the word 'antarvyApti' has the same meaning as immanence. the
corresponding word for transcendence would be 'bahirvyApti'. as an
example where this is used, see the nArAyaNa sUkta 'antarbahishcha
tatsarvaM vyApya nArAyaNaH sthitaH' where brahman is described as both
immanent and transcendent

many other words give the meaning of immanence depending on the
context. see for instance, '...yena sarvamidaM tatam' (gItA.2.17),
'...sarvagataH' (gItA.2.24) etc.
