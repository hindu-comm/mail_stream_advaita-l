Dear Sri Venkat,

This will be my last mail on this topic.

SSS considered all these people blind!

The Brahma Vidya that is conveyed in the Sruthi - that is the Tradition, which SSS received from his Gurus.   Whether any logical explanation (like whether Avidya is Bhava or Abhava etc) those should be secondary details.

This is like me saying that Z is an alphabet in English with you
countering that Z does not exist in Swahili. AllI said was that IF Sri
Narasimha Bharati and Sri Virupaksha Sastri were brahmavits, then
accepting the pa~ncapaadika did not stand against getting
brahma-j~naana. I never said that to be a brahmavit you nedd to accept
the pa~ncapaadikaa. So using the pa~ncapaadikaa is not a problem,
period! Whether it's a necessity was not covered by me at all. As a
matter of fact, Sri Candrashekhara Bhaarati Svaaminah has clearly and
explicitly stated that to gain brahma-j~naana you need not even study
the shAnkara bhAshyas, so where is the pa~ncapaadikaa then?!!

SSSs own disciple, writes in a book published by SSSs own institution
that SSS gained knowledge by self-study. Yes, that's what I would
indeed choose to believe. Unless you have some other more convincing
source.

As far as I can see:

1. SSS repudiated Sri Narasimha Bharati and Virupaksha Sastri by
calling them blind men. So they were not his gurus.
2. SSS's disciple says that SSS gained brahma-j~naana by self-study of bhAshyas!

I have provided direct quotes in support of the above. It has been
countered, as far as I can see, by speculation only. I leave it to
unbiased readers to make conclusions for themselves.

Rama
