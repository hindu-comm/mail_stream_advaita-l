*Well* this cannot be accepted by me too. Sri Narasimha Bharathi is
a brahmavit *par excellence*.

   Boss this is a real sacrilege.  in my view an apachara.   Holenarsipur swamiji had his Bhashya Shanti Diksha and Mantropadesa from this Sringeri Jagadguru.  He had a very good Guru Bhakthi in his life.   He never never called the Sringeri Jagadguru like this.  in fact no one would call so.  He in fact learnt the Bhashyas from Virupksha Shastrigal and he was his Vidya Guru and he was very reverential towards him too.

  when we are talking about such great men, i think we must be very carefull.





Thanks & Regards,
Venkat.
