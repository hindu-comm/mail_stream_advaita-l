Name : Ratnam V Velichety
Age :        72

I had been on visit to London where I had he opportunity to read Hinuism 
Today- Since then I got interested and ardently wish to know and undestand 
the Advita Philosopy as propounded by Jagad Guru Shri Sankaracharya. I 
will be very thankful to receive the mail containig the information.

I am equally interested in subscribing to the hard copy of Hinduism Today- 
earlier I tried o subcribe for the same but could not do so . I will try 
once again on the web site. Hopefully I will succeed. If not I will seek 
your help.

Hope the above info will be adequate to add me to the mailing list.

Thanking you once again
