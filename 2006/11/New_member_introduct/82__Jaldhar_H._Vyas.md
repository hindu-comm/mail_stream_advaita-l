Hello,

My name is Vallish. I come from Mysore, Karnataka, currently in the US in 
NJ. I am 28 years old. I come from a Smartha brahmin family and follow the 
Sringeri mutt's tradition. I am interested in Advaita philosophy and also 
other Indian philosophies. I have had opportunity to read different 
aspects of Advaita vedanta and also listen to some very good scholars. I 
hope the discussion in this list would help in furthering the knowledge.

Regards
Vallish
