This book is available in online on DLI

DLI has translations in Telugu and Kannada, if you search using
naishkarmya, you get these links.

Original text is also availabe in ITRANS form at
http://sanskritdocuments.org/doc_z_misc_major_works/naishk.itx

While searching the UT Catalog yesterday, I found also one translation
by Raghavachar.
"The Naiskarmyasiddhi of Sri Suresvaracarya. English translation by S.
S. Raghavachar; with a foreword by Swami Adidevananda."



With best regards,
