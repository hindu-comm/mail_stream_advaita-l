Hari Om,
Namaste Members,
It is very true Rama Balasubramanian ji's statement that visishtAdvaitins
have very poor understanding of even the tenets of Advaita. henceforth,
however fancy arguments they (Shri Bhashyam in particular) may give can no
manner be accounted as counter factual arguments at all. Advaitins or the
members of this group must atleast be aware that we have brilliant texts
(dialectical) such as Naishkarmya siddhi - Sureswara, advaita siddhi-
Madhusudhana Saraswati and so on dealing with such issues and not be carried
away with fancy arguments posted on web.
