This sounds very interesting. Please do it. I have a Tamil translation
of the BSB and also some notes from Kadalangudi Natesa Sastrigal in
Tamil. He has some stuff from sub-commentaries and also translates
vidyaaraNyas vaiyaashika-nyaayamaala. You might want to get that or I
might be able to lend you my copy.
