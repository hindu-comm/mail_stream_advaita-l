Actually, from my reading of the JMV, it seems that it is precisely
yoga that distinguishes the kR^itopAsti from the akR^itopAsti --
because it is yoga that makes BrahmaGYAna steady. Since the
kR^itopAstis have already performed Karma Yoga, their GYAna is steady
when it dawns, but as the akR^itopAstis have not performed Karma Yoga
adequately, their GYAna requires effort in yoga for steadiness.

I'll try to write more about this in a later posting, as it appears
to be an important point.

Regards,
Kartik
