Thanks for pointing that out. I had specifically mentioned in my
posting that:

"In my personal opinion, SV is not so keen on *proving* that
YAGYavalkya was a GYAnimAtra, as in clarifying that SV is not merely
talking about SAstra-GYAna, but about aparoksha BrahmaGYAna itself
being insufficient for jIvanmukti."

There are some statements in Sankara's BSB that speak of  mithyA
GYAna remaining for "sometime" even for a Brahmavit. For example, BSB
4.1.15:

akartR^i AtmabodhaH api hi mithyAGYAnabAdhanena karmANi ucchinatti .
bAdhitamapi tu mithyAGYAnaM dvicandraGYAnavat.h saMskAravashhAt.h
ka~NcitkAlam.h anuvartata eva .

"The knowledge of the Self (Atmabodha) destroys Karmas by sublating
mithyAGYAna. EVEN AFTER BEING SUBLATED, MITHYAGYANA CONTINUES FOR A
SHORT WHILE OWING TO PAST SAMSKARAS."

Note that Sankara is explicitly saying that the "transition" from
mithyAGYAna to AtmaGYAna is not a 0-1 "step" (i.e. Atma is known and
mithyAGYAna is NOT YET completely destroyed). Rather, even after
Atmabodha, mithyAGYAna still hovers around for "some time"!

This is almost the same explanation Swami Vidyaranya himself gives
for the removal of avidyA. Besides, the above quote is in exact
agreement with Vidyaranya because he teaches that:

  vAsanA ~ saMskAra

Kartik
