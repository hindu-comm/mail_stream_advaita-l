KJ prabhuji:

I had already quoted Sankara's Brihadaranyaka Upanishad Bhashya a
couple of times before. Here it is again:

bhaskar :

prabhuji I am requesting you to parallelly quote shankara bhAshya also
while exploring the JMV...it is not on one instance live above...at every
stage of your presentation of JMV if possible quote shankara bhAshya also
from prasthAna traya...as said above, that would help us a lot to
understand shankara's stand on these issues...Hope you would take care of
this.

As far as 1.4.7 of BU is concerned, we have had enough discussions on this
issue earlier in this same list...Whether jnAni has any *obligation* to
observe these niyama vidhi-s,  Sureshvara in his bruhad vArtika deals with
this very issue explicitly..If time permits I shall quote the relevant
portion of it.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
