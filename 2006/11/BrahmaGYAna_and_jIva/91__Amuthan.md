i guess it is just a difference in emphasis whether the kRtopAsti-s
excel the kRtopAsti-s in yoga or vairAgya. as a matter of fact, for
precisely the same reason you have mentioned, i concluded that it was
a difference in vairAgya. this is because to grasp brahmaj~nAna, a
sharp intellect is necessary (the agribuddhi mentioned in Ka.Up.).
this sharpness of the intellect is obtained by yogAbhyAsa. to maintain
the obtained knowledge, renunciation of all desires and latent
tendencies that obstruct such a maintainance is required. thus, in the
sAdhanAs mentioned by bhagavatpAda after the dawn of samyagj~nAna, we
find (in BUBh.1.4.7) tyAga, vairAgya etc. being mentioned. thus, it
seems that vairAgya is what maintains brahmaj~nAna and hence that is
what differentiates the two category of seekers.

anyway, the basic point is that both yogAbhyAsa and tIvra vairAgya are
necessary.
