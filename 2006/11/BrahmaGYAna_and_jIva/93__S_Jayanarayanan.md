I just realized I missed giving the JMV quote for the above
(JMV-SM, page 108-109, JMV-RG, page 137):

  tasmAdidanIMtanAnAM vidvatsaMnyAsinAM GYAnasyAnuvR^ittimAtram.h .
  vAsanAkshayamanonAshau tu prayatnasaMpAdyAv iti sthitam .

  "So it is held that for the vidvatsannyIs of these days only 
  the GYAna continues. VAsanAkshaya and manonAsha are to be 
  accomplished by effort to make it steady (sthitaM)."


It is quite clear that the "modern students" (i.e. akR^itopAstis)
have to practice vAsanAkshaya and manonAsha to steady their GYAna.
