but let us also not underestimate the 'modern students' mentioned by
svAmi vidyAraNya by equating them with the present day 'armchair
vedAntins' who study vedAnta as an intellectual exercise out of mere
curiosity without the necessary renunciation and culture of mind that
it demands. those 'modern students' mentioned by SV achieved, even
though temporarily, vAsanAkShya and manonAsha. temporary vAsanAkShaya
and manonAsha is possible either during samAdhi or deep sleep. SV is
obviously not referring to the latter :). what this means is that the
'modern students' mentioned by SV - the akRtopAsti-s - are excellent
yogIs who have great powers of concentration, but lack the necessary
vairAgya to effect the complete cessation of the activities of the
body, mind and speech after the dawn of samyagaparokShaj~nAna. they
are strong in abhyAsa, but not so in vairAgya. a significant fraction
of current students of vedAnta have neither abhyAsa nor vairAgya to
their credit.

both kRta- and akRtopAsti-s are great yogi-s, but what distinguishes
the former from the latter is the achievement of an 'almost-perfect'
vAsanAkShaya and manonAsha as a result of upAsanA. in other words, the
kRtopAsti-s outscore the akRtopAsti-s with their dRDha vairAgya though
both are almost equal as far as yogAbhyAsa is concerned.

as an aside, i agree with you 100% that the relevance and importance
of JMV in the modern context is hardly debatable.
