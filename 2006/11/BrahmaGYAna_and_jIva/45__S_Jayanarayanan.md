Let's consider the differences between these two (call them 'G' for
GYAnI and 'S' for Scholar) that have been discussed so far in the
series:

1) G has saMyak-GYAna. S doesn't.

saMyak-GYAna is "Perfect knowledge". In the snake-rope analogy,
saMyak-GYAna is seeing rope-as-rope. S instead has mithyA-GYAna which
is seeing rope-as-snake.

2) G has aparoksha-GYAna. S doesn't.

aparoksha-GYAna is seeing Brahman *with no mediacy* -- meaning not
merely through book-learning or hearing, but directly. S in contrast
has only paroksha-GYAna.

AFAIK, there is a smR^iti quote from Apastamba dharma sUtra
2.9.21.13-16 that distinguishes AtmaGYAna from mukti, which I will
get to in a later posting in the series.
