This is a succint and well put statement. It ties in quite well with certain 
themes I had planned to cover in the Yoga and Advaita Vedanta series.

In this light, I will rearrange my upcoming postings on that thread a bit 
differently. I had planned to cover most of the gItAbhAshya references to 
Yoga first and then move on to other upanishadbhAshya-s. However, since 
bRhadAraNyaka bhAshya 1.4.7 and muNDAka bhAshya have been brought up in this 
thread, my next posting on the Yoga and Advaita Vedanta thread will cover 
these two texts, tying them in with upadeSasAhasrI and sureSvarAcArya's 
naishkarmyasiddhi. I will return to gItAbhAshya after a couple of posts in 
that thread.

Regards,
Vidyasankar
