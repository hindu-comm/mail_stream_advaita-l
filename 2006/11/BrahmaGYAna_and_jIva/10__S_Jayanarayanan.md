I received an email pointing out that refences to the JMV text needs
to be added to support my statements. Rest assured that plenty of
references will be provided in the subsequent postings. They were
omitted from the first posting only because it was meant to serve as
an outline for the forthcoming discussions.

Thanks,
Kartik
