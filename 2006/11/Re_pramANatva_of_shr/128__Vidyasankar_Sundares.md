For vedAnta, an important criterion for acceptance of smRti as pramANa when 
it does not conflict with Sruti is that they have been traditionally been 
accepted as such by learned people (SishTa-parigraha).

For example, in BSBh 2.1.3, when talking of sAMkhya and yoga, Sankara says 
"sAMkhya-yogau hi parama-purushArtha-sAdhanatvena loke prAkhyAtau, SishTaiS 
ca parigRhItau .." There is a combination of common acceptance, tradition 
and learning that validates why smRti texts are accepted as pramANa.

Regards,
Vidyasankar
