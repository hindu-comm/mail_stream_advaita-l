This will be my last posting on this topic.

I shall explain myself very clearly, and then leave it at that. This
is the FOURTH time (at least) that I'm posting this quote, so I will
make my question quite clear:

---
yady apy evaM SarIrAbdhakasya karmaNo niyata-phalatvAt
samyag-jnAna-prAptAv apy avaSyaM-bhAvinI-pravRttir
vA.n-manaH-kAyAnAm. labdha-vRtter karmaNo balIyastvAt, mukteShvAdi
pravRttivat. tena pakShe prAptaM jnAna-pravRtti-daurbalyaM. tasmAd
tyAga-vairAgyAdi-sAdhana-balAvalambena Atma-vijnAna-smRti-saMtatir
niyantavyA bhavati ...

The gist of the above quotation is, "even after the rise of right
knowledge (samyag-jnAna), due to the strong effect of prior karmA
(balIyastva), whose momentum is like that of a released arrow (mukta
iShu), and the relatively weakness of the newly acquired tendency
towards jnAna, it is necessary (niyantavyA) to maintain a steady
recollection of Self-knowledge (Atma-vijnAna-smRti-saMtati), assisted
by sAdhana-s like renunciation (tyAga), dispassion (vairAgya) and the
like.

My question is:

"Why does Sankara talk about the effect of Karma AFTER THE RISE OF
SAMYAGGYANA - where the effect of Karma should not exist at all?"

(Note: I'm NOT INTERESTED in the topic of niyama vidhi here.)

In other words, since you claim to follow the great "shuddha Sankara
mArga", I AM CHALLENGING YOU to answer the question of why Sankara
speaks of ANYTHING after GYAna, when NOTHING BUT BRAHMAN remains.

(Note that for Sankara, Samyak-GYAna refers only to perfect
BrahmaGYAna and nothing else.)

Regards,
Kartik
