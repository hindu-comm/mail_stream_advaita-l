    I am surprised to see such an assertion on the advaita list of all
    places. Ramanujas so called "objections" have already been considered
    and answered multiple times by Sureshvara and Sankara. Most notably by
    Sureshvara brilliantly in NaiSi (3.55-3.70). I am quoting from memory
    here.

I apologize for posting it without careful consideration. I will read
the reference you suggested.

With best wishes,
Ravi
