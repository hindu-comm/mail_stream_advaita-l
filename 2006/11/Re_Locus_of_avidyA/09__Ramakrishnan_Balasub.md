Dear Sri Devanathan,

Yes, indeed A => B is equivalent to not(B) => not(A). The necessary
condition for proving A <=> B is to prove A => B and *also* prove
not(A) => not(B) . This is what Sureshvara calls anvaya-vyatireka in
NaiSi 3.60-3.62. In this instance, he shows that avidya <=> existence
of objects, the "this" feeling and the feeling of "mine". This is the
place where he most clearly defines what anvaya-vyatireka is.

Rama
