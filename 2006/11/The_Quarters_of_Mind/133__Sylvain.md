In the Teachings of RAmana Maharshi, the Maharshi says the antaHkaraNa are five : jNana, manas, buddhi, chitta, ahamkAra. (see no 392).

Subject: [Advaita-l] The Quarters of Mind


I thought that Shankara spoke of the Manas Mind as being divided into four parts consisting of Buddhi Intellect, Chittam Affectivity, Ahamkara Egoity, and fourthly Manas itself, containing the others] and he spoke of this as the quarters of a silver dollar [karpaNa]. Mind, as I understand this, contains its own three parts, as a sort of Spiral Trinity/Quadernity. 

I have been looking at a quote from my guru Bhagavan Shri Ramana Maharshi, which questions this. 

He suggests that Chittam is this triply-self-containing mental organ. 

Can one of you wise men add a thought here?
