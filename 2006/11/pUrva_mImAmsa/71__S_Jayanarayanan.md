Yes. According to mImAmsA, ALL words and sentences are eternal. Of
course, "words" are not merely black ink on white paper. It is the
human mind that sees black ink on white paper and "understands" or
"(re)cognizes" them as words.

Yes.

Good question! I asked the same to a mImAmsA Pandit and he said that
it would take many days to answer that question. The expression he
used was, "It's a college degree in itself". So I don't (yet) know
the exact answer to that question.

But here's what I do know for sure -- all of us, when we use words in
a sentence, are "perceiving" the words, not creating them. The words
that already exist are revealed to us when we "see black ink on white
paper" or "hear phonetic sounds". If words were revealed by
pratyaksha, then a highly intelligent man who can understand only
Japanese should be able to cognize this sentence in English when he
sees the black pixels on white background (which is revealed by
pratyaksha) - but he cannot cognize the words. Hence words are a
revelation in themselves independent of pratyaksha and anumAna -
"shabda pramANa" or "Verbal cognition".

I'll find out more later on this topic on apaurushheyatva and get
back to you.

Regards,
Kartik
