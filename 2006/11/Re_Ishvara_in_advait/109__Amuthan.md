AchArya does in fact use the magician-illusion analogy. for instance,
in his dakShiNAmUrti stotra, he writes '...mAyAvIva vijRmbhayatyapi
mahAyogIva yaH svechChayA' (2). the difficulty in understanding this
arises only when we miss the fact that Ishvara can project the
universe from his arUpa aspect itself. the forms and lokAs of Ishvara
that exist are for bhaktAnugraha. they exist eternally.

btw, the dakShiNAmUrti stotra is a wonderful work which deals with
almost all the questions regarding Ishvara that we are discussing
here. it is interesting to note that AchArya praises dakShiNAmUrti as
both the pratyagAtman ('jAnAmiti tamevabhAntam' etc.) and as having a
particular form ('... yo mudrayA bhadrayA', '... charAcharAtmakamidaM
yasyaiva mUrtyaShTakam' etc.)

what about 'time'? it surely has existence only in vyavahAra. it
cannot be anitya since to assert that something is anitya presupposes
the existence of time.

only if there is avidyA, the notion of difference from brahman exists.
since brahman itself assumes the form of Ishvara using it's
anirvachanIya mAyA shakti, the above question is not valid.

Ishvara sAyujya, sArUpya etc. are accepted as part of kramamukti.
those who desire the respective lokAs reach the respective lokAs by
appropriate efforts. the final goal however is kaivalya. it is final
since that is when complete avidyochCheda happens.

there is no real modification. it is we who superimpose sarvaj~natvAdi
guNAs on brahman and call this brahman conditioned by mAyA as Ishvara.
this Ishvara is the same as jagad/dRshya kAraNa.
