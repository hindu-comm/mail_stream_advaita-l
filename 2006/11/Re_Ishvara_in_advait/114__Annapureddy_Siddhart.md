I agree with all but the last of the statements in the above paragraph (as
we discussed earlier). Could you please provide me a scriptural quote for
the "They exist eternally" part? Thanks.

Another example of eternality is the vEda. I am not sure about time because
it's not an entity. It's a convention for the ordering of events. In any
case, let me focus on the question of an eternal Ishvara within the
vyAvahArika world.

I am not sure what you mean. You are mixing up two analogies -- one, avidyA
as giving rise to the notion of jIva and Ishvara, and the other Ishvara
wielding the mAyA as a shakti. The usage of Ishvara as wielding mAyA
suggests that it refers to nirguNa brahma (the above magician analogy). And
if you want to use the first analogy, my "first objection" above still
stands.

The brahma sUtra 4.3.10 that I mentioned earlier refers to kramamukti. But
there it's mentioned (at least in svAmi Gambhiranandaji's translation) that
hiraNyagarbha who is the lord of that world Himself attains nirguNa brahma
along with the other liberated jIvas residing there at the time of praLaya.
So, there is no mention of an eternal Ishvara there.

Unfortunately,  both the above definitions fit the description of nirguNa
brahma or shrI mahAviShNu. Thus, the question still persists.

What I was wondering was whether the word "Ishvara" refers to nirguNa brahma
(as referred to in the vyAvahArika world) or some entity within vyAvahAra,
be it shrI mahAviShNu or shrI sadAshiva or any of the various forms
glorified as supreme in the itihAsas and the purANas (I am not particular
about which deity is being regarded as supreme.)

This part I mentioned earlier. But we are talking about the existence of an
eternal lOka and an eternal entity within vyAvahAra (independent of our
imagination), rather than forms superimposed for the sake of upAsana.

Shankara's  bhAshya

Thanks for the pointer. I will refer to it again soon.
