If Ishvara is defined as either jagadkAraNA or dRShyakAraNa ( I am
understanding them both to be the same, as jagad is simply the world
we see/perceive) then the aspect of Ishvara does not perish with the
multiple cycles.

vivekachuDAmaNi verse no.243 translation by Swami Chinmayananda (I saw
that this same verse appears as verse no. 245 in the sanskrit
translation by Sri chandrasEkara bhArathi mahAsvAminaH):

"The difference between them (Ishvara and jeeva) is only created by
superimposition and is not real. The conditioning in the case of
Ishwara is Maya, or mahat etc. And listen, the conditionings in the
case of the jeeva are the five sheaths."

>From the second part of the verse, we can infer that the Ishvara is a
modification of Atman by mAyA.
