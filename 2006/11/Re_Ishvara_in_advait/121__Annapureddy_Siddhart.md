Thanks for pointing this.

praNAm.h shrI Amuthan,
      I will make a few observations and rest my case. I agree with you that
the arguments are becoming pretty repetitive. Thanks for the pointer on the
bR^ihadAraNyaka upaniShat.h bhAShya.

Let's see if that is the case. Here are some assertions I am making:
-- nirguNa brahma is the substrate for the nAmarUpa, and is untouched by the
nAmarUpa (exactly like the snake and rope analogy). Thus, nirguNa brahma has
no name and form.
-- Ishvara (at least the kind you speak of) has some name and form
(presumably many such forms like shrI mahAviShNu or shrI sadAshiva. As I
mentioned earlier, I am not particular about the exact form(s).)
-- hiraNyagarbha has some name and form. His form comprises the entire
cosmos.
Let me know if you disagree with any of the above.

Now, given the above and the article on Sandhya worship, there are two cases
(the relation refers to the degree of their omniscience/omnipotence etc.):
-- hiraNyagarbha < Ishvara with name and form
-- hiraNyagarbha >= Ishvara with name and form
Note that hiraNyagarbha being a jIva, the second case is not possible. That
leaves the first case. This means that there is an entity between
hiraNyagarbha and nirguNa brahma that can be worshipped, and which has been
skipped by shrI chandrashEkhara bhArati. Is this your position when you say
that your position is consistent with the article.

As I mentioned earlier, I am not really particular about the exact form or
the number of such forms.

AFAIK, vyavahAra is by definition the world of nAmarUpa. And saguNa brahma
is in vyavahAra. Ergo, saguNa brahma should have name and form.

what defines saguNatva is the
> presence of a guNa. Ishvara is anAma and arUpa during pralaya,


You probably do not mean anAma and arUpa, but avyAkR^ita nAmarUpa.

but

If the saguNa brahma remains without names and forms, and manifests names
and forms later on, then this saguNa brahma can be nothing but nirguNa
brahma being discussed in relation to vyavahAra. I do not see where a form
like shrI mahAviShNu even figures in this discussion. (As you noted, we are
both agreed upon the nirguNa aspect of things, and in fact, we seem to be
saying the same thing. While I am using the term nirguNa brahma in relation
to the universe in praLaya and you are using the terms saguNa brahma/Ishvara
in his anAma and arUpa form.)

I agree non-manifestation is not destruction. But this begs the question: If
even Ishvara is subject to this non-manifestation etc., then do not all the
attributes like immutability etc. fall apart?

Thanks for pointing this. I will try to go through it soon.

please also note

This is curious because in the article hiraNyagarbha is referred to as a
jIva. But I should probably read the bhAShya to see the context.

it is true that AchArya uses terms like Ishvara, parameshvara etc.

(i reiterate,

In the article, hiraNyagarbha is referred to as having the entire cosmos as
his body, and that he is a jIva. How do you reconcile that with your
statement above?

Ishvara, who is verily anAma and arUpa, Himself takes those forms (why

I agree with all of the above. What I do not agree is the eternality part of
these special forms.

i guess it's time to put this thread to rest.


I agree. This is my final mail pending further investigation of the matter.
praNAm.h.

A.Siddhartha.
