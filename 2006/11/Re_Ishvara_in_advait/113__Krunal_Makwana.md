namo nArAyana

Dear All,

I am really enjoying the discussion on Ishvara in advaita vedAnta.

I was coming across the definitions of ishvara and I thought the best place to look would be Sankara bhashya on viSnu sahasranAma.

It is interesting to note that the word ishvara (independently) only appears twice and for both AchAya gives two different definitions.

1. ishvaraH - verse 4 - one who has unlimited lordliness or power over ALL things - I think this would include time etc.

2. ishvaraH - verse 8 - the omnipotent being

hope this helps (in anyway!)
Kind regards,Krunal
