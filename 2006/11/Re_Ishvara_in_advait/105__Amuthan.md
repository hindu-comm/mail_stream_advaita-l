namo nArAyaNAya!

dear shrI siddhArtha,

this is a reply to the second half of your mail dealing with Ishvara
within advaita vedAnta. before examining your reply, let me define
what is meant by the word 'Ishvara' to avoid any possible confusion:

define Ishvara as dRShyakAraNa ('source of what is seen'). that such a
source exists is known from shruti-s like 'sadeva soumya idamagra
AsIt'. that this source cannot be other than brahman is clear from the
word 'eva' in the above shruti.

(this definition is from the vyaShTi standpoint. from the samaShTi
viewpoint, Ishvara may be defined as jagadkAraNa. i'll stick on to the
'dRShyakAraNa' definition.)

yes, brahman seen as the source of vyavahAra is Ishvara.
let me make a few observations on what you had written earlier,

since nirguNa brahman itself is called Ishvara when viewed as dRShya
kAraNa, the correct way to state the above would be as follows:
'Ishvara exists, but His Ishvaratva is dependent on the existence of a
dRShya. if no dRShya exists, Ishvara remains as nirguNa brahman'.

in the first place, there is no meaning to statements like 'nirguNa
brahman is eternal'. for to assert that, you have to assume the
simultaneous existence of time and nirguNa brahman. but such is not
the case. the correct statement is: 'nirguNa brahman is neither
eternal nor non-eternal nor capable of being characterized by time in
any way'. on the other hand, since 'time' is a dRShya, the moment the
existence of time is accepted, it makes sense to say that Ishvara
(brahman viewed as the source of 'time') is 'eternal'. it follows that
Ishvara cannot be non-eternal.

while it is true that a particular form is deliberately superimposed
on brahman for the purpose of upAsanA, it is also true that certain
forms and lokAs exist independent of our upAsanA, i.e. their existence
is not a mere fanciful imagination as some think. (i think ramaNa
maharShi also pointed this out. maybe someone can provide the exact
reference.) even accepting the eternal existence of such lokAs or
forms does not affect brahman since 'eternal' existence is itself a
notion within mAyA.

suppose that a man A has two children B and C. is the father of B
different from the father of C? similarly Ishvara is the same though
two different sRShTi-s may be different.
