traditionally, advaitins have accepted all smRti-s which do not
contradict shruti as pramANa. so, as far as vedAntin-s are concerned,
a statement from the smRti-s is sufficient for proving the Ishvaratva
of shrI rAma or kRShNa.

you may also take a look at the series shrI Anand Hudli on references
to shrImad rAmAyaNam in the Rg veda (starting with
http://www.advaita-vedanta.org/articles/rig_vedic_ramayana/rig_vedic_ramayana-1.htm)

the omniscience of vyAsa, vAlmIki etc. is known from the smRti-s which
are accepted as pramANa. (like 'vyAsAya viShNurUpAya
vyAsarUpAyaviShNave' etc.)

the bauddha's claim regarding the omniscience of buddha has neither
shruti nor smRti pramANa. that is sufficient for a vedAntin to reject
buddha's omniscience.

sha~Nkara rejects kapila's views since they contradict shruti. this is
only in keeping with the basic rule that a smRti cannot contradict
shruti.

the bottomline in all these cases is the acceptance of both shruti and
smRti as pramANa by vedAntin-s. whether it is possible to know through
means other than shAstra pramANa whether A can know the omniscience or
otherwise of B, i don't know.

i don't know if this has been done. i'll leave it to the experts in
vedAnta to clarify whether advaitin-s accept the mImAmsaka's argument
against the possiblity of knowing if someone is omniscient or not. but
what i know for sure is that such an argument is not necessary to
prove the Ishvaratva of rAma or kRShNa since ample smRti pramANa-s
exist for proving that.
