I am not sure what the point of your mail was, so I cannot say much.

I was trying to find who/what is referred to by the word "Ishvara" (and not
about the mithyAtva of the attributes). Does it refer to nirguNa brahma or
an entity in the vyAvahArika world like shrI mahAviShNu?

praNAm.h.

A.Siddhartha.
