  This is total nonsense, blasphemy, and mud-slinging at best. If you didn't find any substantive arguments to counter-act Swamiji's writings. it is better to keep quite than twist and turn some words to suit what you want, and then appeal to readers' emotions. Trampling on others is not the way to get to the top....

  We have already established Swamiji's devotion to the Gurus mentioned above, and the Sringeri Swamijis' commendation of Sri SSS's contributions and achievements earlier.

  I don't understand why the moderators allow such politics in an august forum like this?? Why can't this thread be put to rest?

  Thanks,
  Savithri
