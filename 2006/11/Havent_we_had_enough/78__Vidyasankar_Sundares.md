To repeat, we do not actively moderate postings to this list. This means 
that what each member posts automatically reaches the in-boxes of all list 
members. One of us interferes only when a discussion gets out of hand and 
strays into a situation where there is more heat than light.

On the thread(s) relating to SSS's views and counter-views, we honestly 
thought it would quiten down naturally, especially after the two most 
frequent posters (Ramakrishnan and Venkata Subramanian) both said they had 
posted their last mails on the topic. It looks like everyone has said 
whatever they needed to say, so let us all agree to disagree and consider 
the discussion closed.

I will send a separate ADMIN message shortly in this regard.

Vidyasankar
