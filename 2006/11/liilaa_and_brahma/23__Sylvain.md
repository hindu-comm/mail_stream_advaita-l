In my relative understanding, brahman is One (eka) but can appear 
multiplicity, as i experience life.

Do you mean that liilaa or leela or the divine play is incompatible with 
brahman ?
If yes, i don't personally see any incompatibility.

Therefore, would you tell me in which kind of advaita does my conception fit 
?
