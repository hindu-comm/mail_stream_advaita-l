Because the observation of limits or otherwise depends on the viewpoint of 
the observer. As far as the attainer of Brahmaloka is concerned, by 
knowing Ishvara he has known all that is to be known there are no limits 
for him.  It is only from the nirguna viewpoint that we can see that there 
is still a limit. But unlike the limits of nama and rupa, this one takes 
no exertion to transcend, it goes away by itself at the appropriate time.

No that's not what I mean.  I'm saying literally when Maya (the 
multitude of names and forms.) stops, ceases to exist.  That is pralaya.

No Ishvara by definition is Brahman with the power of maya.  Maya only 
stops when Ishvara Himself stops.

The rest of your arguments on this topic have similiarly gone astray due 
to misunderstanding what I meant by pralaya.

As the latter occurs inevitably after the former why even make this 
distinction?  Particularly because it rests on the false concept of time.

  See, saguna brahman becoming nirguna brahman is not an "attainment" in 
the same sense as a maya-bound jiva attaining brahman (of either variety.)
saguna and nirguna brahman are one and the same. It is only because of 
maya they appear to be two.  When maya goes, the oneness effertlessly 
shines forth.

This shruti just says that moksha is not a bodily resurrection but an 
identification of the atma with paramatma.  So it does not directly relate 
to the topic we are discussing now.

Again let me remind you that the definition of jnana is relative to the 
context.  The ordinary egotists definition of self is no more than his own 
body.  Therefore his self-experience is equally limited and his attainment 
is equally limited.  the self, and the self-experience, and the attainment 
of the knower of gunas, and the knower of nirguna is progressively greater 
but each of them can honestly speak of themselves as 'jnani' and 'mukta' 
in their own context.

If Lord Brahma has this jnana then why does He have to wait till pralaya? 
Similiarly if all these jivas are learning jnana, do they all attain at 
exactly the same time just before the pralaya?

Krshna Bhagavan says we have to know Him to attain the avyakta and akshara
whether we know Him with gunas or without we still know Him.  Jivanmukti 
is a more direct approach whereas kramamukti is more roundabout.  But the 
latter is still a way of knowing Him.
