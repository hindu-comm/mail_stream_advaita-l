Shree  Madhava havyavahana, PraNAms.

I am adding my suggetion to Sadanandajis:

Please visit the website of Arshavidyagurukulam. This website lists the teachers and their address and telephone numberes all over India and also abroad.

You can attend the classes depending on your comfort zone with the teacher. There are 2 or 3 swamis and grihastha  Vedanta teachers of Arsha Vidya gurukulam who are teaching in various areas in bangalore. They are students of Swami Dayananda Saraswati.

Wishing you good luck
