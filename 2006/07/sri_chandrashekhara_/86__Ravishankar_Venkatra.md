Lathaji,

My understanding is this sloka was originally composed by Markandeya, when 
Yama came to take his life at 16. Lord Siva protected Markandeya and blessed 
him to be a chiranjeevi. Lord Siva also kicked Yama with His foot for 
troubling His devotee who was intensely absorbed in His bhakti.

Ravi
