I'll also confess that I'm a Vedantic student. But that does not stop
me from doing nitya-karmas. :) In fact while studying Vedanta I've
learnt that karma is a very potent tool for citta shuddhi.

The above is a "motherhood statement". Bhagavatpada didn't have such a
thing in mind while commentating on karma yoga.

I agree. Shri Krishna says that the same karma should not be given up
for any reason and doing so is due to tamas. We should however
understand here that He is talking abou the non-sannyAsi here. :)
