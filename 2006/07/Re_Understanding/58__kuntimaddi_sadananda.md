Shree Abhishekji - PraNAms.  I have discussed extensively the Karma yoga
in the Karma yoga series which were posted few months ago.  I have no
other position other than follow Lord Krishna's advice.

yat karoShi yadashnAsi ... tat kuruShva madarpaNam' - whatever you do
what ever you eat ... offer it to me. It is the attitude in the karma -
that chages karma into karma yoga.  

 That is what I try to follow.


Hari OM!
Sadananda
