The mimamsakas apparently choose the giving up of kAmya karmas and
performing nityakarma alone to attain mokSha. Adi Shankara
Bhagavatpada says the same in upadesha pancakam. However, He goes a
step further and says even those have to given up only once one enters
sannyAsa.

To atain karma yoga itself is not easy. From His biography, we learn
that  Sri Abhinava Vidyatirtha Mahaswamiji, once he entered sannyAsa
Ashrama, performed karma yoga until He was directed by Sri
Chandrashekhara Bharati Mahaswamiji to give up that and become j~NAna
nishTha. To "give up" karmas to Ishvara or perform niShkAma karma is
not so easy.

Regards,
Abhishek
