I don't know if I'm allowed to, but I wish to register my protest
against this. IMHO, this reflects the general anti-intellectual
atmosphere clouding Hindus today. Acharya Shankara Bhagavtpada also
took the help of King Sudhanva. Also, your pleading that this list "be
spared" suggests some ulterior motives may be behind such discussions.
With all due apologies, may we remind ourselves that we are not
discussing some "rahasya" that is not to be discussed in public? IMO
this list has enough competent scholars to answer to any debate or
topic within the scope of Hinduism.

Regards,
Abhishek
