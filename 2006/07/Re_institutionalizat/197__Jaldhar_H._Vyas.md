I'm no fan of the RSS but I don't think Elst is on the mark here. 
Secularists were willing to tolerate Hinduism when it was powerless, 
merely a picturesque decoration to bring in the tourists which would just 
wind down and eventually disappear.  But contrary to how they imagined, it 
is secular ideologies like communism and nationalism which are on the 
wane.  Now they are aware they have competition for hearts and minds and 
they will brook no rivals.
