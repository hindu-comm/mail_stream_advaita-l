namastE Ramaji,
         Please refer to this old post by Vidyasankarji on the
occurrence of "itihAsa purANah" in the ChAMDOgya upaniShat.h:
http://www.hindunet.org/alt_hindu/1995_Jan/msg00017.html

Here shaN^kara takes it to mean mahAbhArata and some other purANa. Is
there any reason why shaN^kara doesn't identify the reference in the
bR^ihadAraNyaka similarly? Thanks.

A.Siddhartha.

It seemed to me that
