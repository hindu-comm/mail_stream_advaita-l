It's somewhat obvious that it's a brAhmaNa sentence, and of course the
most important brAhmaNa sentences in the context of rituals are
vidhis. My ? mark was since I don't know the context of the sentence
and was unable to translate properly. Is there any reason for
interpreting vAyavyAm with vAyum?

Interesting thought, but I am not very convinced by it. Adi is
typically used in a series and the first in the series, or the
beginning, is usually placed befor aadi. I remember seeing
sR^iShTyadayah and never pralayAdayah. Moreover brahmANDadini is
simply the nominative or accusative plural of the neuter brahmADAdi,
and there doesn't seem to be any justification in interpreting
brahmANDAdi as some kind of bahuvrIhi (purANas ending in the
brahmANDa). Is that even kosher? I am not adept enough in the grammar,
but don't ever remember seeing a compund with aadi being interpreted
as a bahuvrIhI.  In any case, this is all predicated on the assumption
that shAyaNa knew this verse.

Remember that the lalitaa trishatii and sahasranaama are from this
puraaNa and evidently would have been important to shAyaNa, who
mentions vidyaatiirtha in his salutation verses.
