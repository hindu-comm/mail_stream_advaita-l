No frustration, I was genuinely wondering out aloud.

I checked Sankaras ChhAndogya bhAShya very quickly in the morning and
there seemed to be no diiscussion on what he thought itihaasa-puraaNa
meant in the ChAndogya verse. Swami Gambhirananda is usually very
precise in translating, so I shall double check after I go home today.

But it is a fact, and I know for sure, that Sankara inteprets puraaNa
and itihaasa NOT to mean the bhArata or any purANa (viShNu or
otherwise) in his bR^ihad bhAShya. And Sureshvara explicitly
contradicts this in his vArtika.

The current advaita tradition seems to accept Shankaras interpretation
and not Sureshvaras.

Unfortunately I don't have Anandagiris TIkA on any bhAShya other than
the mANDukya bhAShya. Can someone who has access to these please quote
Anandagiris opinion on this matter?

It'll be interesting to look at shAyaNas interpretation of the verse
in the taittiriiya-aaraNyakam 2.10, yadR^icodhite payasa.h kuulyA ....
yadbrAhmaNAni-itihAsAn-purANAni kalpAngAthA nArAshagm sIrmedasa.h
kUlyA ...

The last sentence lumps brAhmaNa passages-itihAsa-purANa and "tales of
heros". The passage basically talks about recitation of R^ig, yajus,
etc., and what kind of "sacrifice" it corresponds to. It would be very
interesting to see how shAyaNa interprets purANa and itihAsa here.
Again, I don't have access to shAyaNa's bhAShya. Anyone else?

Thanks!

Rama
