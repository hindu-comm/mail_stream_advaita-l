I suppose I must clarify this a bit.

There are many errors in that old posting of mine in alt.hindu. Chalk it 
down to youthful ignorance! I was also doing precisely that which I nowadays 
warn against - relying entirely on translations without actually consulting 
the original. I think if one were to go over every one of the spirited 
exchanges I used to have to with net people in the 90s, there will be 
mistakes galore.

That said, even in that old alt.hindu post, I did not say that Sankara 
bhagavatpAda interprets the phrase as "mahAbhArata and some other purANa." I 
was making a general statement that "in general" itihAsa means mahAbhArata 
and that in the bhAshyas, Sankara bhagavatpAda has quoted from vishNu 
purANa.

I am currently reading the relevant portions of the bhAshyas on chAndogya 
and bRhadAraNyaka and will add to Ramakrishnan's comments in this thread as 
appropriate.

Regards,
Vidyasankar
