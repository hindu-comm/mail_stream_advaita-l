That the important Vedic statements are those that impell action (vidhi) 
is the standard Mimamsaka party line.  "offer a white animal to Vayu" is 
also a stock Mimamsaka example of a vidhi.  So he seems to be saying 
Brahmana = vidhi.

I think a better translation would be "including upto Brahmanda".  See

So in this case, itihasa-purana = the Mimamsaka category of arthavada.

Isn't it interesting that Sureshvaracharya is held to have been an 
ex-Mimamsaka (even by those who don't agree with the identification with 
Mandana Mishra.)

Rather I think he is merely recollecting the traditional shlokas that 
name the 18 mahapuranas.
