To answer this question in detail, I'll have to quote Sankara and
Sureshvara who take opposing views in the bR^ihad bhAShya and vArtika.
I'll try to provide this later.

The traditional position is that any sMR^iti derives validity only
when not in conflict with shruti. The traditional position also is
that sMR^iti rarely contradicts shruti. In any case, statement such as
above would be interpreted as an arthavaada to eulogize the
mahaabhaarata. If it is indeed to be interpreted literally, people
would have stopped chanting the vedas except for the "essential" parts
dealing with nitya karmas and started chanting the mahaabhaarata,
would they have not?
