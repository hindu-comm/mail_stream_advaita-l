Werlingsji

  Spelling * is * very important as is the accent, in vedic mantras. Thanks for your vigilence.

  While on spelling, many Northerners find the Southern spelling of 'gam' in the place of an anusvAra wrong / odd / different as in 'axaramida.N sarvaM' versus 'axaramidagam sarvaM'. Followers of the TaittirIya recension (most of them are in the South) of the krishNa yajurveda pronounce the anusvAra as 'gam' when it precedes a syllable of equal effort - that is sibiliants s, S, and sh; and 'ha'. This is as per the grammar which governs the taittiriya recension. I believe the followers of mAdhyandina or vAjasaneyi recensions of the Suklayajurveda do not pronounce the anusvAra in such a manner,  but that the anusvAra is elongated (sa-varNa-dIrgha sandhi).

  Having said that, in written texts the special character of the inverted-omega-chandrabindu is the appropriate symbol for this elongated anusvAra, rather than carry a particular pronounciation into the written text.

  Dear all,



It seems to me that the first mantra of the MA. U is spelt, according all 
the sources I know and also from the transliterated text from the Sanskrit 
Documents site:



.. atha maaNDukyopanishhat.h ..



OM ityetadaksharaM ida.N sarvaM tasyopavyAkhyAnaM

bhuutaM bhavad.h bhavishhyaditi sarvamoMkaara eva

yachchaanyat.h trikaalaatiitaM tadapyoMkaara eva .. 1..



and not

Omityetadaxaramidagam sarvam



Of course there is no problem with spelling axaraM with an x as both x, ksh 
and kSh are acknowledged by Itrans.



Sorry to be the eternal "minor typos pinpointer". I do apologize and hope 
not to offend shrii kuntimaddisada.



praNAm-s



Guy
