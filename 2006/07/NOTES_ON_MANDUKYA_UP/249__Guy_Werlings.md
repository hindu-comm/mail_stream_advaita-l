Dear all,



It seems to me that the first mantra of the MA. U is spelt, according all 
the sources I know and also from the transliterated text from the Sanskrit 
Documents site:



.. atha maaNDukyopanishhat.h ..



OM ityetadaksharaM ida.N sarvaM tasyopavyAkhyAnaM

bhuutaM bhavad.h bhavishhyaditi sarvamoMkaara eva

yachchaanyat.h trikaalaatiitaM tadapyoMkaara eva  .. 1..



 and not

Omityetadaxaramidagam sarvam



Of course there is no problem with spelling axaraM with an x as both x, ksh 
and kSh are acknowledged by Itrans.



Sorry to be the eternal "minor typos pinpointer". I do apologize and hope 
not to offend shrii kuntimaddisada.



praNAm-s



Guy
