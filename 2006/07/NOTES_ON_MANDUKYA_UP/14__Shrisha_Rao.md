Thanks for the reference.  However, without having seen it, I would only 
remark that the established meanings of such appellations do change over 
time; e.g., when Sankara himself refers to `dvaitinaH' he always seems to 
mean the Sankhya adherents.  In that sense, though he rejects the Sankhya 
positions in many places in his BSB (starting with discussion of prakR^iti 
under `IxaternAshabdam'), it does not appear that he would accept his own 
position as a logical negation, or even see himself as the only opponent, 
of what he calls `dvaitinaH'.  As such, with apologies to Mr. Hacker, 
perhaps `Advaita' is not significantly better in this regard.

Regards,

Shrisha Rao
