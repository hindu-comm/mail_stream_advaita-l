Namaste,
The name of this communist mouthpiece "The Hindu" is a bizzare one.

One notable thing about these "secularists" is, whenever their notions
are subjected to hard-hitting criticism by scholars like Sitaram Goel,
Arun Shourie, Koenraad Elst etc (who are quite independent of any
"organisation"), they give such books the "silent treatment" (ostrich
syndrome). Virtually no magazine or newspaper in the "secularist"
press, reviews or quotes these worthy writings. Instead the standard/
authoritative writings on Hinduism by their own scholars are held
sacred.

Regards,
Abhishek
