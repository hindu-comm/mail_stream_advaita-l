Lakshmiji - You are absoluely right. I could not have said it better.
Your note reminds me of the Bhajagovindam sloka:

yogaratova bhogaratova
sangaratova sanghavihiinaH|
yadyat brahmani ramate chittam
nandati nadati nadatyeva||

One finds one's apppropriate guru due to blessings of the many lives
says Shankara. Appropriate guru will come when the student is ready to
surrender. That is the Law. 

Hari OM!
