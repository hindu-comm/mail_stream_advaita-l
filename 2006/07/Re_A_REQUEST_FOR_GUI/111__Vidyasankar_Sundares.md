In this thread, with respect to different organizations, I would suggest 
different respondents to agree to disagree and leave it at that. Each 
organization addresses different needs felt by different audiences. Each of 
us should decide for ourselves which kind of audience we ourselves fall 
under first, before approaching a guru or getting involved with an 
organization.

If you are in India and are interested in a SAstra-oriented and traditional 
form of study, I would suggest to look for personal guidance from scholars 
within traditional circles. If you fall outside either of the above 
conditions, then you should look further afield.

Regards,
Vidyasankar
