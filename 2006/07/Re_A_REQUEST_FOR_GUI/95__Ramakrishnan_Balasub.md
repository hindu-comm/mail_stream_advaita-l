I think Abhishek might be referring to the opinions he has received
about karmas from certain swamis. Traditionally sannyaasins encourage
non-sannyaasis to do the proper karmas. For example, a long time ago
when Sri Sannidhanam graced our house for a paada-puujaa (I was 15 or
16 then), and I went to do namaskaaram. Before that he asked me if I
do the sandhyaavandanam daily and asked me to recite "aapo hiShThaa"
as verification!

Not having any experience with Ramakrishna Mutt, I don't know what
advice their sannyaasis give householders. Of course, as you say the
target audiences are vastly different. I would say that their
structure is more Westernized than traditional Mutts, but not a
Christian one. It's more a mixture of the vedaanta and bhajana kind of
traditions. As you say "social service" has been adopted by even the
most traditional of mutts.

They have produced some outstanding scholars of vedanta. The
translations Swami Gambhirananda (8 Upanishads and Brahma Sutra) are
monumental. I wonder what kind of advice he gave to people who spoke
to him.

My personal opinion is that if one is obligated to nitya karmas, they
better do it. Studying vedanta texts in lieu of that is most likely
useless and even counter-productive.
