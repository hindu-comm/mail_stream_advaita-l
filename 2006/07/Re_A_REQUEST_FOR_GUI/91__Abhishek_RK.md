I disagree. I don't know how one can learn shAstras from those who
don't even follow the shAstras. Based on personal experience, these
organisations enjoin a Christian lifestyle while "studying" the
shAstras. Ramakrishna mission is practically a Christian mission
today. Personally, I've found a few good book in some of their centres
but the swAmijis there don't encourage karmas for sure!

Regards,
Abhishek
