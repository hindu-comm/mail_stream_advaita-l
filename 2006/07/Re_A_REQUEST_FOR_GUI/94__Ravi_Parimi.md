Perhaps Abhishek was expressing his concern about the futility of
learning vedanta from Swamis that do not emphasize the importance of
karmas. The trend of most modern Swamis seems to endorse initiation
into Vedanta without laying any emphasis on Karma. While doing this
may be good for the enlightened ones (or sanyAsis) this is not
necessarily true for the rest of the world.
