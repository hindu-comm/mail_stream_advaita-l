Attack the message, not the messenger :)

I am not talking about social service. I am talking about not performing
nitya karma. "Rituals" are not very popular in christianity, except perhaps
for Orthodox Christianity. Sitaram Goel also calls this organisation a
"Christian mission, for all practical purposes". Do you think he also is
shooting off his mouth?

Well, as many in the list have emphasised (refer archives), advaita does not
exist in a vacuum.

In any case, why should a sannyAsI bother about karma-s? Does

I am sorry, you are just not getting my point. All I am saying is sannyAsis
should not bother with karmas, especially not discourage it.

Translations/commentaries produced by the Ramakrishna Math say the same

Adi Shankara says that vedanta has to learnt from one who is in the
sampradaya. Refer Gitabhashya.

Another thing to be kept in mind is that the audience of the

This is a biased view. That nitya-karmas are performed by "only a small
fraction" is simply not true (I guess you mean Brahmanas here).

Regards,
Abhishek
