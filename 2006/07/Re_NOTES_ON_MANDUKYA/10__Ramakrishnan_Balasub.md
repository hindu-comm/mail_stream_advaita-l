I think I have mentioned, even very recently about karmas and how it
can be viewed as forming a continuous link with j~naana, with
quotations from Sureshvara. But the bottom-line is that those passages
you quote would be interpreted more or less exactly the same way by an
advaitin and the old bhedaabhedavaadins like Bhaskara. So, there is no
justification in calling advaita brahma-vaada, based on those
passages. That's all I was trying to say.
