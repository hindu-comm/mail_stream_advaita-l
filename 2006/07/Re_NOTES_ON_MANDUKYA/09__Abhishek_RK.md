Namaste,
I generally concur but, I also agree with Sri Vidyasankar who
mentioned in an earlier mail that it is very difficult to clearly
distinguish between karma-kAnDa and j~NAna kAnDa throughout the entire
vedas.
Anyway, "...brahmavAdinaH pUrvAbhimukhAssandhyAyAM
gAyatriyAbhimantritA Apa UrdhvaM vikShipanti tA etA Apo vajrI bhUtvA
tAni rakShAgMsi..."
(taittirIya AraNyaka dvitIya prashnaM) forms the source for the karma
of sandhyAvandanaM. It is clearly mentioned here that "brahmavAdinaH"
are those who perform such and such a karma as mentioned in the
mantra.

Regards,
Abhishek
