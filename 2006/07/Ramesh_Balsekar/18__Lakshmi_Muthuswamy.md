A suggestion to the sAdhaka.

Please stick to studying the Upanishads, BhagavadGita and Brahmasutras and Shankara Bhashya  in their originals under a competent guru first. 

Please make sure that the English translations are authentic.

Well this is going to take a long period of study. Well perhaps the other books and other authors can be read only when the prasthAna traya has been well understood and they have become part of us. 

Any other study will take the sAdhaka away from the study of Vedanta Shastra.
