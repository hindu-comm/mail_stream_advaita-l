There were several postings in January 2005 about books written by
this person, which you can read in the archives at
http://lists.advaita-vedanta.org/archives/advaita-l/2005-January/

IMHO: He's probably not Self-realized, and doesn't claim to be. He
writes speculative books on non-dualism though.
