  Namaskaram Lakshmigaru,
  I found an excellent English translation for Nirguna Manasa Pooja. Here is the link: http://celextel.org/adisankara/nirgunamanasapuja.html. The website www.celextel.org contains a rich collection of translations for many upanishads and many of Sri Shankara's works. Pranams and best wishes, Ramesh Ramanan.
