When using words like limit you must be clear about the context.  In a 
system where there are only 1,2,3,4, and 5, the "highest limit" refers to 
5.  However in a system where there is 1,2,3,4,5 and 6, the term "highest 
limit" refers to 6.

In the world of gunas, jnana, the "highest limit" of knowledge refers to 
identification with Ishwara.  Not so in the world of nirguna but if you 
bring that up, you are moving the goalposts.

The question is improperly phrased.  In so far as the atma considers 
itself to be at Brahmaloka, there is nothing limited about its jnana.

2. How do you justify that the state of liberated soul at BL with

I am not calling anything "salvation" but if you are talking about mukti, 
then as I said above, there is nothing limited about jnana in the saguna 
context and thus nothing limited about mukti as a result of that jnana. 
In the saguna context.

3. If it has limited gyan, then how do

What is this pralaya?  If I have dirt on my face, I may be considered 
"ugly" and if I wash it and groom it I might be considered "beautiful." 
But did my ugly face "merge" into my beautiful face?  Or did the removal 
of the dirt let the true nature of my face appear?

To answer my question, pralaya is when maya stops and the apparent 
difference between saguna Brahman and Nirguna Brahman is erased.

_If_ we assume.  My point is we can assume something else entirely.

AbrahmabhuvanAllokaH punarAvartino'rjuna |
mAmupetya tu kaunteya punarjanma na vidyate || 8|16 ||

All the worlds including the abode of Brahma are subject to return Arjuna.
But only by reaching me Kaunteya does one not know rebirth. (8.16.)

On the face of it, this shloka does pose a bit of a conundrum as it 
appears to contradict the brahmasutras.  So lets look at the context.

mAm -- me.  Who does this refer to?  Krshna Bhagavan, but who is Krshna 
Bhagavan.  The previous shloka (8.15) also mentions mAmupetya and there 
Shankaracharya glosses mAm as Ishvara.  Ishvara is contrasted with Brahma. 
Who is Brahma then? 8.17 explains it is Prajapati whose days 
and nights are 1000 yugas long i.e. whose lakshana is time.  8.18 goes on 
to say this Brahma is the avyakta of Samkhya/Yoga.  So the brahmaloka of 
this part of the Gita is not the same as the brahmaloka of the Vedanta 
sutras.  Remember both Sankhya and Vedanta have their basis in the Vedas 
and therefore use similiar sounding terminology at times.  So you have to 
look at the context to understand how a term is being used. 8.19 goes on 
to explain that those who achieve the Samkhyan Brahmaloka can fall from it 
because they remain bound by time.  However there is a being that is 
avyakta and akshara according to 8.20 who is not bound by time.  And 8.21 
says exectly what the Vedanta sutras say:  those who reach the avyakta and 
akshara, never return.

But you agree the sutra says no more births.  Isn't that the very 
definition of samsara?

Self-experience is the cause of attainment of Brahmaloka.

  and there

The merge is automatic because in the paramarthic sense, there was never a 
difference.  So a reason for merging isn't needed.

What are the "correct answers"?  To me it obvious that all the upanishad 
is saying is that those who have avidya have a different destination than 
those who have jnana.  Why would jnanis need Prajapati to give them "the 
final liberation teaching."?

Obviously this sutra is a rejoinder to those such as Samkhya and Mimamsa 
who had a different conception of mukti.

Why so?  Gunas are not imperishable.  What can be ended must have begun 
and there must have been a cause to begin it.  Only nirguna brahman is 
avyakta _and_ akshara.
