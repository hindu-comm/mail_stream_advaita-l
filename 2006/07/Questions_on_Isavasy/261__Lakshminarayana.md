I cannot answer your question directly but there is
enough justification to say that the word "vidya" here
in the ISa upanishad is not brahma-vidya. Because we
know from taittirIya upanishad that - brahmavid Apnoti
param i.e., brahma-vidya leads to the highest state.
So brahma-vidya cannot lead to greater darkness than
avidya. Sankara is therefore justified in not
considering vidya here as brahma-vidya.

Meanwhile, while we are at the subject, I have a
question for your dvaitic friend. I was reading the
material on ISa upanishad at the website -

http://www.dvaita.net/pdf/shruti/isha/ibtcomm.pdf

I was wondering how the word avidya can mean
"incorrect understanding" in verse 9 and "criticism of
incorrect understanding" in verse 10 and 11. It looks
like the meanings are opposite. You may reply to me
personally. Thanks.

I referred to the "Atman" shabda and found that the
ShaSThi vibhakti is "Atmanah" and not AtmA. Further
AtmA was listed as prathamA. I am not sufficiently
knowledgeable in Sanskrit to solve this. Also, do the
rules of grammar allow a split in the form of Ishasya
AvAsyam? What sandhi/samAsa will it be? Can someone
answer this please.

One possibility is that neither the bhAgavata purANa
nor the brahmANDa purANa were written by the time of
Sankara. Or even if they were written by the time of
Sankara it is possible that they did not achieve the
same status as vishNu purANa - a purANa which AchArya
quotes. 

I referred to the "List of Abbreviations" given in the
translated works of Sankara (except BSB) published by
Ramakrishna Mutt. Apart from vishNu purANa, I also saw
linga purANa, Siva purANa and vAyu purANa, though I
did not verify if they are quoted anywhere in the
commentaries.

swami gambhIrAnanda's translation of Sankara's
commentary -  "Compared with the non-dual state of the
supreme Self, even the gods are asuras".

The andhaM tasmas in verse 3 means the blinding
ignorance, blinding because there is no ability to see
the Atman.

The amRtam in verse 9 refers to the immortality of the
gods. The gods are supposed to have taken "amRtam" by
which they achieved immortality.

Obviously the two are referring to different things.
