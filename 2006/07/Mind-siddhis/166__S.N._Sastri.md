Sastriji - I would like to know how Mahatmas are able to read others'
thoughts? Personally I have seen some of the holy saints reading my own
thoughts and directing me accordingly. Similarly we have read such events in
the life histories of other saints.

Thanks,
Ravi

These are siddhis. The means for attaining these are given in Patanjali's
yogasutras.
