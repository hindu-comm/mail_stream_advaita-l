Please let us use the correct terminology: jnana and mukti.  The 
English words realization and salvation have connotations which may obscure 
already difficult concepts.

  then, how can you justify as per sri Shankaras

As with many Vedantic concepts, it is a matter of perspective.  The 
Krama mukti is the result of jnana where Ishvara or saguna Brahman is the 
object.  By placing limits on Brahman the jiva is also placing limits on 
his jnana.  Concepts such as time (pralaya) and space (Brahmaloka) still 
apply.

Jivanmukti on the other hand is result of jnana where Nirguna Brahman is 
the object.  Because all concepts are annhilated it appears to be 
immediate and instantaneous.

Is it justified to call a student who has completed his last courses but 
not received his diploma a graduate?  From his perspective he is.  There 
is nothing more to be done.  But an employer for instance, might want to 
wait until he actually sees the piece of paper before e.g. offering a job.


from the point of view of the kramamukta, he _is_ liberated.  Remember the 
brahmasutra says "There is no return"  The cycle of rebirth is over. 
There is no force that can bring him back to samsara.

Aside: it should also be apparent from this account that Brahmaloka is 
not the same as svarga (heaven) from which it is possible to fall.

Yes.

Then why would he see gunas in Ishvara which he supposedly identifies 
with?

No this doesn't make sense.  Acheiving mukti cannot be the qualification 
for being able to create, because it is by definition the trancendence of 
concepts such as creation, destruction etc.

This is the purvapaksha argument.  The passage speaks of being the lord of 
the mind, the lord of speech etc.  It is the siddhanta that this, as you 
say, does not imply unlimited powers.

Because as I said, mukti is liberation from samsara.

Mukti is orthogonal to "powers"  Such "powers" imply the existence and 
acceptence of samsara.  A mukta is one who has transcended such concepts.

Again, the siddhanta is not making this argument, the purvapaksha is. 
Ishvara has the power to enter and leave samsara because he is the 
producer of that system.  The jivas cannot because they are products of 
that system.

Lets assume somehow I was able to steal your identity and credit cards. 
If "Ramesh Badisa" has a credit limit of 1 million dollars on his 
Mastercard then I as "Ramesh Badisa" cannot spend 2 million dollars right? 
However if I could assume the identity of the credit card company I could 
raise the limit to  10 million or 20 million or whatever I wanted.
