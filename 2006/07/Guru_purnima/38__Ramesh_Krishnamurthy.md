That was an extremely interesting mail, Jaldhar-ji.

Can you tell us a bit more about the Dharmasindhu?

On the vyUha theory you mentioned in the mail, I understand it comes
from the pancarAtra Agama-s. Has any list member read any of the
pancarAtra texts? What is their importance in the various vaiShNava
traditions? From what I have read/observed, the pancarAtra and
vaikanAsa texts seem to be used only for temple rites by some
SrIvaiShNava temples in southern India. They dont seem to be known in
the rest of the country. Do the other vaiShNava sampradAya-s have any
use for them?
