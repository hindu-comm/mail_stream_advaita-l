This is the first shloka. Once again, I request the members to point
out any translating errors or typos.

1. Let the Veda be studied everyday (constantly)
2. The action enjoined therein (both nitya and naimittika karma)
should be properly performed
3. Through those actions, the prescribed wordhip of Bhagavan should be done
4. Attachment to those actions done with the desire for fruits thereof
(kaamya karma) should be abandoned
5. The heap of sins should be discarded
6. The defects in earthly pleasures should be (constantly) remembered
7. The desire to know the Atman should be strengthened
8. (Finally) one should leave home and hearth and get out expeditiously

(continued)

Regards,
Abhishek
