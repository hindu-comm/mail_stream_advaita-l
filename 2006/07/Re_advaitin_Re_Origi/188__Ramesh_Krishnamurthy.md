Well, initially I was a bit confused about what you meant by
itihAsa-purANa referred to *in* the upaniShad. Anyway that is clear
now.

But my question was about itihAsa-purANa as we normally understand
these terms i.e. the  mahabhArata, bhAgavatam, etc.

On issues such as SrI hanumAn jumping across the sea or the gigantic
proportions of kumbhakarNa, pratyaxa-anumAna would suggest that such
things are impossible. Neither do such incidents seem to have anything
to do with dharma or moxa, where the SAstra-s are supreme. So why
should they be interpreted as actual incidents?
