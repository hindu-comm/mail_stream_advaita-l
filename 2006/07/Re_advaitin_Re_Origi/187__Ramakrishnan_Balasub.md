I am not sure if I understand the question right. The itihaasa-puraaNa
mentioned in the veda passage refers to the a-historical legends and
stories in the veda itself. That is as per shankara.

If you are asking about the bhArata, viShNu puraaNa, etc., that is
different from Bhaskars original question. Yes, Hanuman jumped across
the sea,  it's a historical incident, what's the problem with that? In
any case, according to the suutra bhaashya, the itihaasas and puraaNas
are all acual incidents (unless it is obvious or there is some other
reason to interpret the story as an illustration). Shankara says that
just because we are not able to see the Gods, we cannot dismiss these
stories as mere imagination. So both puraaNas and itihaasas relate
actual incidents.
