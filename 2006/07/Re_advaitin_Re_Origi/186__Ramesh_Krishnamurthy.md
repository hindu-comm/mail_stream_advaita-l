So how are the itihAsa-purANa interpreted? Would an incident like SrI
hanumAn jumping over the ocean be interpreted as "historical"? Is
there any difference between the status of the itihAsa and the purAna
in this matter?

Swami Dayananda Saraswati of Arsha Vidya says that the itihAsa-purANa
is "part history and part poetry", though I haven't yet come across
any detailed explanation of this view.
