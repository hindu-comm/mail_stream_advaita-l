Looks like they are minor variations of the 'preceptors', invoked in
'Vyasa Pooja' from Mutt to Mutt.

Following is the 'Smartha Sampradaaya' in Kanchi Mutt. (Ref: 'Sankara
Vakyam', A Newsletter of the Kanchi Kamakoti Center of California,
Volume 9 Issue 3 dated September 2000 )

Pooja of six groups of preceptors is done, with the aavaahanam of
these preceptors in a 'Pooja Mandalam' done with lemon fruits

Each of the six groups consists of five (panchaka) preceptors.

They are

1.	Krishna Panchaka, consisting of Sri Krishna, Vaasudeva, Pradyumna,
Anirudha and Sankarshana.
2.	Vyasa Panchaka, consisting of Sri Vyasa, Paila, Vaisampayana,
Jaimini and Sumantu.
3.	Bhagavatpada Panchaka, consisting of Sri Sankara Bhagavatpada,
Padmapaadaacharya, Sureswaracharya, Hastaamalakacharya, and
Totakaacharya
4.	Sanaka Panchaka, consisting of Sri Sanaka, Sanadana, Sanaatana,
Sanat Kumara, and Sanatsujaata;
5.	Dravida Panchaka, consisting of Sri Dravidaacharya,
Gaudapadaacharya, Govinda Bhagavatpaadaacharya, Sankshepakaacharya and
Vivaranaacharya
6.	Guru Panchaka, consisting of the Guru, Parama Guru, Parameshti
Guru, Paraapara Guru of the Sanyasin and other promulgators of the
sampradaya ("anye brahmavidyaa sampradaaya kartaarah gurvaha").

In addition, pooja is offered to Sri Suka, Narada, Durga, Ganapati,
Kshetrapaalas, Saraswathi and the ten 'DikPalakas' (Indra, Agni, Yama,
Niruriti,Varuna,Vayu, Soman, Esanan, Brahma, Sesha)

Finally aradhana is offered to Suddha Chaitanya, whose aavaahana is
made in the Saaligrama. Samashti pooja is performed at the end.
