              Dear Bhaskarji,

  Namaskaram.  As the initiator of this query I wish to say that in pravrthi the male lineage is what matters in Gothram and in Varna.  The male lineage is the correct choice as has been proved by modern science.  (I am referring to chromosome mutation).  So viewed in this context, Vyasa and Vidhura are Brahmins.  

  Logically I tend to agree that a person of a higher varna can follow the dharma of a lower varna with EASE.  In this context no one can say that it was quite easy for Viswamithra to become a Brahmin.  If at all Viswamithra became a Brahma Gnani (which is beyond varnas).

  Regards,
  Kanchi

A Brahmana can therefore follow the Dharmas of other Varnas with ease i.e.
he can follow Kshathriya Dharma, Vaisya Dharma or even Sudhra Dharma, a
Kshathriya, likewise can follow Vaisya Dharma or Sudhra Dharma but not
Brahmana Dharma, a Vaisya can follow Sudhra Dharma but not Kshathriya
Dharma or Brahmana Dharma and Sudhra can only follow his own Dharma and not
of anyone else."

  then what about *vishvAmitra* erstwhile  kshatriya who followed brahmaNa
  dharma & became *brahmarshi*?? and then what about *vidhura* a jnAni but
  a dAsi putra, what about astAdasha purANa karta maharshi Sri VedavyAsa, a
  son of a fisher woman..were they engaged themselves in dharma bAhira
  activities??

  Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!

      Dear All,

 I recently read the following in another website.

 " There is an important aspect of the Guna play. A person born in one Varna can follow the Dharma of what can be termed as a lower Varna but not in the reverse direction. This is by taking Sathwam to be higher than the Thamas, though in terms of wordly needs both serve their purposes and therefore are equal. The higher and lower classification would be only in terms of knowledge of Reality such as transparency and opaqueness of the Anthakarana or mind. A Brahmana can therefore follow the Dharmas of other Varnas with ease i.e. he can follow Kshathriya Dharma, Vaisya Dharma or even Sudhra Dharma, a Kshathriya, likewise can follow Vaisya Dharma or Sudhra Dharma but not Brahmana Dharma, a Vaisya can follow Sudhra Dharma but not Kshathriya Dharma or Brahmana Dharma and Sudhra can only follow his own Dharma and not of anyone else."

 This reminded me of my late father saying the same thing years ago.  I am curious to know if there is a scriptural support for this contention.

 Regards,
 Kanchi
