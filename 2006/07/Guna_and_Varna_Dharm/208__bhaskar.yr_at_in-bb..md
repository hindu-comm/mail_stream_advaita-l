A Brahmana can therefore follow the Dharmas of other Varnas with ease i.e.
he can follow Kshathriya Dharma, Vaisya Dharma or even Sudhra Dharma, a
Kshathriya, likewise can follow Vaisya Dharma or Sudhra Dharma but not
Brahmana Dharma, a Vaisya can follow Sudhra Dharma but not Kshathriya
Dharma or Brahmana Dharma and Sudhra can only follow his own Dharma and not
of anyone else."
