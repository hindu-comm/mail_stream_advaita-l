Can any one know, or can post, translation of Mula-Madhyamika karika of Nagarjuna.Which closely resemble to Mandukya karika og Gaudpad. So i think it is necessary to understand, Madhyamika & Vidnyanvadi standpoint before, understanding Mandukya Karika, deeply.
         I also think, the Madhwa & other who call Shankara , buddha in disguise, is bcoz, Buddha like Shankara alwayas rejected, Karmakanda & Upalabdhivad, which Mimansakas & their hidden followers like MAdhwa & Ramanuja stand out for.
