I will await it with some eagerness. Thanks. I guess there is more to the
story than the quite simple and seemingly clear explanation of "borrowed
sentiency" given by Sastriji. I thought the analogy given of the birghness
of the moon as opposed to that of the sun explained quite nicely how an
"inanimate" thing can come to seem "animate". Was the analogy flawed in some
way?

In the meantime, I will look at Brahma sUtra 3.3.54 and read your link.

Thanks, Mahesh
