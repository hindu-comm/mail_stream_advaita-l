Sadanandaji, I agree with you here. If the physical
brain of the guru is destroyed, then the guru will not
be there to teach the disciple. He will be in a brain
dead state. Because the brain is still intact, the
capacity to think remains. The destruction of the mind
is more in the mental arena rather than a physical destruction.
