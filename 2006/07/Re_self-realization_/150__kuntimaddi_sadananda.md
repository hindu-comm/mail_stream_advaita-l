Shree Abishekji - PraNAms 

As I understand - it is not in the place of the mind, it is clear
understading that of Brahman is everything that includes Brahman in the
form of body, mind and intellect as well as in the form of the jagat
too.  Nothing gets destroyed other than our notions about the world of
objects or the reality we associate to the world of objects. Only our
notions gets destroyed since they are notions.

Hari Om!
