Namaste Maheshji,
         The term Isvara could be understood in several ways. In the
tattva bOdha (attributed to shaN^karAchArya), Isvara is defined as the
combination of the brahma (sAkShI, the Witness) + mAyA (which is
defined as triguNAtmika), while the jIva is defined as brahma + avidya
(which is again triguNAtmika). The difference between them though is
that in Isvara, the sattva is unaffected by rajas.h and tamas.h, while
in the case of jIva, the sattva is under the control of the other two
guNas. This is the definition you were referring to.
         Another definition (found in works like the dR^ik.h dR^ishya
vivEka attributed to svAmi bhArati tIrtha/svAmi vidyAraNya) for mAyA
is that it's the power of brahma which has the properties of vikShEpa
(projection) and AvR^iti (covering up). Thus, mAyA is "BY DEFINITION"
a power. And brahma when viewed with this attribute of having mAyA as
a power is called Isvara.
        I am presuming the difference in the definitions has to do
with the ontological vs. epistemological approaches taken by the
bhAmati and vivaraNa schools respectively, though I am not fully sure.
Hopefully others can shed light on this.

Hari Om.

A.Siddhartha.
