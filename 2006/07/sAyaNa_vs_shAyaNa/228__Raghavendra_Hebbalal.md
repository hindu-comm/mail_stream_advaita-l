namaste,
An off topic question - but I was just curious to find
the answer out.

I've seen for quite some time that mAdhavachArya's
elder brother sAyaNAchArya has been referred to as
shAyaNa on this list. In all the books I've seen
including Skt. ones, it just says sAyaNa. Where did
the 'h' come from? Assuming that "shAyaNa" was not a
spelling mistake,  I wanted to know the rationale
behind this.

Thanks,
-Raghavendra
