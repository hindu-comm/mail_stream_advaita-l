Hari Om,

My name Kris Manian and I am 55 years old. I live in Fremont, CA, USA. I 
am a devotee of Bhagavan Sri Ramana Maha rishi. I am drawn by Advaita 
discussions and dicourses. I happened to read your web page and was struck 
like iron to a magnet. From there I read a few posts on this news group 
and thought, how I missed this for this long. I am a seeker and thirst for 
knowledge and commentaries on the Upanishads. I will consider it a 
privelege to be included in this list.

Thank you
Kris
