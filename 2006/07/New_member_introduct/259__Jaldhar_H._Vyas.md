hi,

I am S.Kothandaraman, aged 66 and residing in Chennai. I am a retired 
teacher. Brought up in an orthodox and adavaitic envronment, I had always 
nourished a desire for advaitic reading and thinking.  I got my first 
glimpse of advaita from the compete works of Swami Vivekananda and since 
then I have been studying the upanishads and viveka choodamani. With a 
desire to know more I wish to join the advaita l group.

   Regards,
   S.Kothandaraman
