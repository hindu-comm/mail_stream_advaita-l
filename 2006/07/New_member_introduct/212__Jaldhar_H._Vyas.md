Hi,

I am Hari Ramakrishnan, aged 33 years. I live in Dallas, Texas, USA. Having 
read Deivathin Kural of Kanchi Maha Periyavaa, Ramana Maharshi's teachings and 
other Hindu Spiritual books, I understand that the self realization is the 
ultimate goal of life and would like to practice more towards that goal by 
having Satsang of like minded people in advaita vedanta group and reading 
spirutal articles.

Thanks.
