Shree Chandrashekar - PraNAms.

The four types are specified as general categories.  Human minds can
fall within those with different shades.  All humans have various
degrees of these mental moods.  If I say this is red color and the other
is blue - there are shades in between, but broadly one can examine the
predominant guNas. 

Even in a given human, the moods change from getting up to going to
sleep. In the morning after one has predominately sAtvic and hence
meditation and studies are recommended at that time.  As the sun goes
up, one has more rajasic vAsanas and one becomes very active and as the
sun goes down tamasic vasanas takes over as one gets tired and sleepy.

But indiviual tendencies determine if one is extrovert or interovert or
just lazy all the time.

Hope I am clear.  

Hari OM!
Sadananda
