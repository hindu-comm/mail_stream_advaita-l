Namaste,

I was recently reading "Sarvatantrasvatantra" -a biography of Prof SK
Ramacandra Rao by Shatavadhani R Ganesh. Sri SKRR was by birth a Marathi
Deshasta Madhva. He however had learnt Madhva Vedanta from Agnihotri
Yajanvitthalacharya, classical music from Sangitakalanidhi Rallapalli
Anatakrishnasharma, purvamimamsa from Nanjangudu Venkatesha Somayaji,
Advaita Vedanta from Asthanamahavidvan Panditaraja Palakkad Narayanashastri
as well as sahitya, tantra and other subjects from a host of  other
teachers. He also had learnt Bouddha darshana from a Tibetan Lama and Jaina
Darshana from a Jaina Muni from Vadodara. He was also a noted psychologist.
He had the good fortune of seeing the former Shringeri Jagaduru Sri
Candrashekhara Bharathi Mahaswamiji for about three times but accepted Him
as his "Atmaguru". He also left behind some wonderful books in kannada and
english. So we can see that he was a versatile genius of our times and we
were fortunate to have such a giant amidst us.

Regards,
Abhishek
