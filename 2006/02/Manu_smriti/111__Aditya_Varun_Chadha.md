I agree with you, but I must add that honest analysis and
understanding include the possibility of outright rejection as
"contradicting Shruti". Honest analysis of anything requires that we
atleast keep our mind open to possible refutation of the scripture in
question itself. otherwise the understanding is not really honest.
