An interesting point to note is that in the commentary
of this verse, shankara does not name the bauddha
schools even though he  is aware of them. This is to
maintain the consistency of the context, since the
teaching is coming from krishna, not from shankara. By
contrast, the kashmir shaivaite non-dual teacher
abhinavagupta specifically mentions the name of
bauddha school in his commentary, thus diluting the
context.

With regards,
Ram Garib
