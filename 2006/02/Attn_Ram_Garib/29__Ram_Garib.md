I guess UK has decent representation of chinmaya
mission, RK mission, and shivananda society. R K
Mission has got teachers of all varieties of vedanta
but some may not be authentic. Shivananda societies
are some times active and some times not. Chinmaya
mission is always active but you will need to move
over if you want more than basic study. Their UK
website is:

http://www.chinmayauk.org/

If you desire to approach it in academic way, I have
heard good things about Oxford Center of Hindu
studies.(Contact Dr. Godavarish Mishra)

Well, I had decided to bid farewell to vedanta (and
hinduism) full thirty years back. But I am plain too
lazy. Blame it my karma-s :-)

With regards,
Ram Garib
