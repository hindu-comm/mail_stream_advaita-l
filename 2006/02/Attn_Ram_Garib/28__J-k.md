Dear Ram Garib

  Any similar informantion about the UK? London area? 

  (It was definitely not easy to take on board the consequences of discussion on relationship between being a sudra and high standards required to study Vedanta. But if the taste was already developed, it seems reasonable to allow it to grow...)

  Kind regards.
