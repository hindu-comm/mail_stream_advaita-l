Dear Ramakrishnan

I happened to meet Prof SKRR in a seminar on corporate philanthropy in 2002.
He was a versatile scholar no doubt. As far as I know, he was a Madhva by
birth and was exposed to dvaita thought. Perhaps that explains the dvaita
influence in his writings. At the same time, based on his writings, one
could say he was more familiar with Shankaracharya's works those of
Madhvacharya.

Was he an advaitin or a Maadhva? Some of his writings made me think
that he is actually a Maadhva. Just curious. Thanks!
