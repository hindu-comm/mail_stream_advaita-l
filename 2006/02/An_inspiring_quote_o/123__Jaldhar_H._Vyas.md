One can argue that there is a little or a lot of Advaita in other 
religions but that is precisely a matter of "doctrines" isn't it?  We 
should not hesitate to reject those elements of other paths (Whether 
"Hindu" or otherwise) where they conflict with Vedic siddhantas.  And if 
that results in bloodshed so be it.  Actually I think remaining ignorant 
of doctrines is more likely to create an environment where violence can 
flourish.

This is exactly the method our acharya has adopted.  Throughout his works 
he has not hesitated to criticize other schools.  But he has also tried to 
see the good in them--where possible.
