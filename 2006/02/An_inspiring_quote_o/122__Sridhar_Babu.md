             || Namaami Bhagavath Paadham Sankaram Loka Sankaram ||

Dear Avdaitins

This is an inspiring quote, of Swamiji, that requires our great attention:

      Principles exist; we do not create them, we only discover them. . . .

Religion consists solely in realization.

Doctrines are methods, not religion.

All the different religions are but applications of the one religion
adapted to suit the requirements of different nations.

Theories only lead to fighting; thus the name of God that ought to bring
peace has been the cause of half the bloodshed of the world. Go to the
direct source. Ask God what He is. Unless He answers, He is not; but every
religion teaches that He does answer.
