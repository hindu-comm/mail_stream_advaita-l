Respectful sri Subramanyanji,

You are right in saying "The devotee starts identifying with the deity and
loses the sense of difference". Thats what my guruji says when you follow
Bhakthi marga... But even there , there shudn't be multiplicity.  you choose
one Ishta deivatha and stick to it.

Where as when you choose Jnana marga, you keep questioning and start
traversing within you rather looking out. When you go deeper you
automatically and conciously give up your " ahankar'. when that ahankar
dissappears the mind also dissappears and you start seeing that' self' in
everyone and everyone in you. I feel this is the state of " Aham Bhramasmi".
Than the universal love flowers within you and thats  the ultimate bhakthi
towards the Bhraman.

According to me what is generally known as bhakthi is the statring point,
where the seekers surrenders himself , without realising anything. But when
the surrender becomes total, the real Jnana he attains and thereby reaching
the  state of  'Aham Bhramasmi"

Incase of Jnana marga he conciously reaches that state (the path of
Shankara/ Ashtawakra) , whereas he moves to that state unconciously in
Bhakthi marga (case of Meera/ saint thaygaraja).

Bhakhmarga is simple and great path.But , unfortunately many stop in the
middle and without surrender and make the the whole scene a hypocratic
drama. Likewise in otherpath too people with halfbaked theoritical knowledge
start lecturing about vedantha only to boast thier egos. Either way if you
go thru completely, ends with dropping of mind / ego and ultimate
realisation.

This being my understandings, I wonder why to have five or ten devatahas,
ritualistic form of worships, etc...

( Being from orthodax Bhramin family,seen all these ritualistic practices
from closer point, aswell, seen and discussed these with realised
Gnanis too)

Hope I am trying to make my point clear and certainly free to correct myself
if I am wrong.

Pranams

Viswanath

Viswanathan,

I am not in agreement with you.

The devotee starts identifying with the deity and
loses the sense of difference.

Parabrahman manifests in the physical world as
entities real to the context of physical world(even
though this place may be illusionary).

The role of god(this concept will only cease to exist,
when there is perfect understanding of oneself) in
understanding of oneself is significant and important.
Pardon me if I might sound like a follower of Vishita
advaita. But even shankara's writings are  centered
around devotion , which will lead to knowledge.(Pardon
my ignoranc , if this is not the case).

Any way, I am sure you too would be appreciating the
role of Bhakti.

But let us say for instance, if I worship alcohol, and
if I start adoring this and start taking it regularly,
I loose control over myself and in due time, my
spiritual accomplishments would become void. Further
more this religion would make me commit acts which can
actually bring down my spiritual nature and take me to
a lower plane.

I am pretty sure the learned people here, will respect
this idea, that the procedure of worship must be
systematic and proper, for the unregulated mind to
establish control.


 For the brahmagnani, this question does not arise.


Regards,
Subramanian V.
