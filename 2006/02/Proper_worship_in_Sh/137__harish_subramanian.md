Viswanathan,

I am not in agreement with you.

The devotee starts identifying with the deity and
loses the sense of difference. 

Parabrahman manifests in the physical world as
entities real to the context of physical world(even
though this place may be illusionary).

The role of god(this concept will only cease to exist,
when there is perfect understanding of oneself) in
understanding of oneself is significant and important.
Pardon me if I might sound like a follower of Vishita
advaita. But even shankara's writings are  centered
around devotion , which will lead to knowledge.(Pardon
my ignoranc , if this is not the case).

Any way, I am sure you too would be appreciating the
role of Bhakti.

But let us say for instance, if I worship alcohol, and
if I start adoring this and start taking it regularly,
I loose control over myself and in due time, my
spiritual accomplishments would become void. Further
more this religion would make me commit acts which can
actually bring down my spiritual nature and take me to
a lower plane. 

I am pretty sure the learned people here, will respect
this idea, that the procedure of worship must be
systematic and proper, for the unregulated mind to
establish control.


 For the brahmagnani, this question does not arise. 


Regards,
Subramanian V.
