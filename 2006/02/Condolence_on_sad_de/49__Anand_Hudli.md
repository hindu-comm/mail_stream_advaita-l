I am sad to hear about Prof. SK Ramachandra Rao's demise. I had listened to 
some of his scholarly lectures on various topics, including vedanta and the 
vedas. His publications on the Rg Veda which includes a detailed explanation 
of Vishnu suktas, Srividya, Shiva worship, and other topics, brought out by 
the Kalpataru Research Academy (a Division of Sringeri Sharada Peetha), are 
highly valued. In many of these works, Prof SK Ramachandra Rao has edited 
and published the original text of many rare texts or texts that are not 
easily available. He was considered to be a versatile scholar because he had 
a detailed understanding and even mastery over many areas. The world has 
become poorer and will continue to do so as the number of such genuine 
scholars diminishes.
