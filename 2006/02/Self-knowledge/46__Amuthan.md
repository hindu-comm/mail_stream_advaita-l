asamsakti is not the same as the non-attachment that
one developed as a part of sAdhana chatuShTaya. there,
vairAgya springs forth from a discrimination between
what is eternal and what is non-eternal. but in the
present case, it cannot be interpreted that way. MS
interprets it to be identical with nirvikalpaka
samAdhi ('tatra savikalpakasamAdhyabhAsena niruddhe
manasi ** yA nirvikalpakasamAdhyavasthA
sA.asamsaktiriti ** suShuptiriti chochyate.' - 'when
the mind is withdrawn by means of savikalpaka samAdhi,
in it, ** a state known as nirvikalpaka samAdhi is
produced. this is known as asamsakti ** and sleep.'
thus, this asamsakti cannot be a part of sAdhana
chatuShTaya.

nothing can arise 'after' the destruction of avidyA
since the notions of time, arising, destruction etc.
presuppose avidyA. what i said earlier is that for a
brahmavit (in the same sense as that used in yoga
vAsiShTha), avidyA is not totally destroyed. because
of sattvApatti, the tattva j~nAna that he got from his
guru becomes aparokSha tattva j~nAna and this destroys
the residual avidyA left out. of course, for a
jIvanmukta there is neither mind nor body and hence
there is no question of any knowledge arising etc.

very true. i guess the meaning of the word 'brahmavit'
has to be found out based on the context where it is
used.
