you have completely missed my point. the topic here is
NOT how we understand sleep, but how the truth taught
in the shruti-s - brahma satyam - is experienced
*during* deep sleep. you earlier asserted that the
knowledge of advaita should be present in *all*
experiences. it is not sufficient to know the truth of
advaita in the waking state alone. unless the
intellect is sharp enough (and that occurs with the
perfection of dhyAna - samAdhi), it is impossible to
intuit the truth of advaita *during* sleep.

(BTW, the question of how we have a knowledge of
sleep, though not related to his topic, is quite
profound. it is possible, as you have elaborated in
your mail, to get a (parokSha) j~nAna of what sleep is
with shAstra dR^iShTi. but an aparokSha j~nAna of deep
sleep is possible only for one who has experienced
nirvikalpaka samAdhi.)

this kAraNa kArya and vyaShTi samaShTi vichAraNA is
done during manana. during nididhyAsana, whatever has
been said in that shruti has to be *done* (and not
just mentally thought of).

and it is not to be interpreted as normal buddhi
either! the sharp intellect that is referred to here
is the one that has tattva j~nAna as a result of
sattvApatti.

i hope you are not taking the word 'chasing'
literally! please note that to be 'established in the
knowledge that truth is available in all experiences'
is possible only for one who has had a direct
knowledge of brahman. such a one practises the triad
of tattva j~nAna, mano nAsha and vAsanA kShaya in
order to attain jIvanmukti. practising the triad
mentioned above is essentially the same as 'chasing'
nirvikalpaka samAdhi.

according to the description of nididhyAsana given in
the above reference, all the various vR^itti-s of the
mind are controlled with a nirodha vR^itti (AtmAnAtma
viveka) that springs from gurushAstra upadesha. in
case you didn't notice it, this can only end in
samAdhi. the description of nididhyAsana that you have
referred to is perfectly well summarized by the
following sUtra-s of bhagavAn pata~njali,

'tatpratiShedArthamekatattvAbhyAsaH' (1.32)
'to rectify that (in this case, vyAvahArika dR^iShTi),
practise of one subject (in this case, parokSha tattva
j~nAna (= AtmAnAtma viveka) that arises from
gurushAstropadesha) (should be done)

'vyutthAnanirodhasaMskArayorabhibhavaprAdubhavau
nirodhakShaNachittAnvayo nirodha pariNAmaH' (3.9)
'by the elimination of the outgoing tendencies (of the
mind, by means of AtmAnAtma vichAra) and by the rise
(= practise) of the controlling modification of the
mind (which in our case is the indirect knowledge of
the self that arises from gurushAstra upadesha), the
mind, at that moment, is said to be in a controlling
modification (nirodha pariNAma)'

these two adequately summarize the process of
nididhyAsana that you referred to. 

to understand what happens next, consider the
following: if i let go an apple in my hand, it is
bound to fall down. this is a consequence of the law
of gravity. the apple falls down whether you like it
or not :-) similarly, it is a consequence of a (not so
well known) law of nature (pertaining to the mind)
that a mind which is steadily resolved by nirodha
pariNAma attains samAdhi as is evident from the
following yoga sUtra:

'sarvArthataikAgratayoH kShayodayau chittasya
samAdhipariNAmaH' (3.11)
'when the mind is restrained from thinking of various
objects and is concentrated on one object (in other
words, in a mind that is in nirodha pariNAma), in it,
a modification called samAdhi is produced'.

thus, samAdhi is an inevitable consequence of
nididhyAsana. of course, the nature of samAdhi depends
on the particular nature of the nirodha pariNAma.
during samAdhi, the modifications of the mind subside
and so, 'tadA draShTuH svarUpe.avasthAnam' (1.3) - the
self is directly known. after this sattvApatti, the
parokSha j~nAna received from the guru becomes
aparokSha j~nAna.

vAsudevaH sarvaM,
aparyAptAmR^itaH.
