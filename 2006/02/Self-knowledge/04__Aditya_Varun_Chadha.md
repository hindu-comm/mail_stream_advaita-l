all emotions are functions of the brain, including love, hunger,
anger, etc. and are limited to this body. When different chemicals act
on the nervous system, it reacts in corresponding ways, and these
reactions we give a name, example love. This is pratyaksha pramANa.
Please do not confuse jurisdictions of science and scriptures, it has
been done too many times on this community.

or the simple scientific explanation: the sense of sight triggered
specific hormones to act on the nervous system, and there occured a
configuration change in the structure of the brain. based on various
attributes and the extent of a match, this reaction can occur almost
instantaneously, or over a length of time. this new configuration is
called "being in love".

there are simple scientific explanations for all these things (EXCEPT
the phenomenon of retention of memory across reincarnations).
Remember, Vedanta does not compete with science. Don't be offended if
science explains some of the phenomena that we THINK pertain to
spirituality, because Vedanta welcomes these explanations. Vedanta has
jurisdiction elsewhere, and that "elsewhere" (brahmanhood) may
provably be beyond science. but these simpler things (personal love,
emotions, and even enlightenment, ANY human experience for that
matter) are much more easily explained by science (these explanations
don't go against what Vedanta has to say).

Rumi is poetry. However much mysticism you may advocate, this only
gives pleasure to your Mind, maybe even changes your mind
configuration for extended periods of time. but it is all still
pertaining to the Mind.

about self realization, let me read more and THEN talk.
