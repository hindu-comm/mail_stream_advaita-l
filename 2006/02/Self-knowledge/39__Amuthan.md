i don't think what you have said above is correct.
bhagavatpAda says the following in bR^i.up. bhAShya
(1.4.7), 'yadyapyevaM sharIrArambhakasya karmaNo
niyataphalatvAt ** samyagj~nAnaprAptAvapi **
avashyambhAvinI pravR^ittiH vA~NmanaHkAyAnAm.' -
'since the karma which led to the formation of the
present body (i.e. prArabdha karma) is bound to bear
its fruits, activities of the speech, mind and the
body continue ** even after (one attains) samyag
j~nAna (= aparokSha tattva j~nAna) **.'

vAsudevaH sarvaM,
aparyAptAmR^itaH.
