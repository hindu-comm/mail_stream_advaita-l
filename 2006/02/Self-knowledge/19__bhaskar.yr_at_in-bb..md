but an aparokSha j~nAna of deep
sleep is possible only for one who has experienced
nirvikalpaka samAdhi.)

praNAms Amuthan prabhuji
Hare Krishna

Kindly quote me the shankara bhAshya reference for above
declaration...IMHO, nirvikalpa samAdhi is purusha tantra jnAna (attained
through human effort) which is limited in space & time and not vastu
rUpa/vastu tantra  jnAna or svarUpa jnAna...

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
