Dear Mahesh
IMHO the feeling of love if you mean that as between an adult members of the
opposite sex is only due to harmones and not vice verse.In children this
passionate feeling does not arise as the harmones have not been released in
their blood vessels.Puberty is only due to harmonal releases and it is a
mystery what triggers these releases.One`s the harmonal activity is started
what we call love comes into play and perhaps in most of the human beings
intellect takes care  and guides the individual from not falling a prey to
animalistic behaviour.
The love you have spoken of is in spiritual level and this is not as a
result of harmones but as a result of seeking Brahman in all living things.
Krishnamoorthy.

Pranams:

A common misconception - chemicals react to give rise to love. How do you
not know that it is love that is causing the chemicals to behave in the
manner you suggest?

To illustrate this point some more:

There is a story of a saintly lady (I forget her name now) who radiated love
to such an extent that she could sit among wild tigers and they would treat
her as her own! This cannot be due to a tiger's hormones gone wild, can it?
If it were local to her mind, there was no way the tiger would have sensed
it!

Humble pranams, Mahesh
