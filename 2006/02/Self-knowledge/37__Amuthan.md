i don't have an offhand quote from AchArya's bhAShya,
but svAmi satchidAnandendra sarasvatI mentions in one
place (again, i forgot where) that nirvikalpa samAdhi
is a mere experience of deep sleep. though what i have
stated does not follow from this, it should atleast
make it sound plausible.

samAdhi is a special state of the mind. during
nirvikalpa samAdhi the mind subsides and our identity
with the self which is ever present is directly
realized. how can this be puruSha tantra j~nAna? since
during samAdhi we remain as our own self, and since
svarUpa j~nAna is not something that is newly created,
it ought to be called vastu tantra j~nAna.

vAsudevaH sarvaM,
aparyAptAmR^itaH.
