       Name: K. Krishna Chaitanya
       Age: 24
       Country:  India
       I intend to join this group to discus the advaita philosophy of
Sankaracharya.  Also I want to know more about Sankara and His  works.
Right now I am going through a video lecture on  Bhajagovindam.  Last
month, I attended a lecture on Sankara  Bhasyam on Brahma Sutras.
       Regards,
       K. Krishna Chaitanya.
