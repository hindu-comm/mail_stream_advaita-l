Sir! Swami Chidbavananda was a great soul. Like him
many have interpreted scriptures out of compassion.
With due regards to him, let me submit that historical
and scriptural evidence is quite otherwise. If I start
giving contrary evidence, it will fill volumes and may
be inconsistent with the list policies. Suffice it to
say that interpretation where caste is based on birth
is much stronger and more universally accepted.

Secondly, what was the basis of caste in some ancient
time can at best be of academic interest now. Much
more important is the issue of how it is iterpreted
and implemented tody? 

Thirdly, even assuming that caste was based on guna-s
and karma-s and not birth, does not solve the issue.
As I said, many scriptural passages violate the basic
human dignity of non-dvija-s. Surely, we do not want
to argue that violation of basic human dignity is not
permissible for non-dvija-s based on birth but is
acceptable for non-dvija-s based on guna-s and
karma-s?

With regards,
Ram Garib
