Yes, that's the ideal, but non-Sannyasins are not prohibited from
studying Vedanta.

I think that Swami Vidyaranya in his Jivanmuktiviveka permits
everyone including Shudras to take up Sanyasa. I'm not able to find
the quote offhand though.

This doesn't seem correct. The Kovilur Math ( http://www.kovilur.com/
) teaches Vedanta in Tamil to virtually any good human being, and one
of the past Sringeri Acharyas has actually visited the place and
commended them on their practice and studies. Many of those initiated
into Sannyasa from this Math may not be dvijas, IMHO.
