I have no doubts that in every age there have been
mahatmas who have considered the official line
invidious and imparted the vedic knowledge beyond
caste considerations. As I said, the practice here is
not that important since hardly anyone ever reaches
this knowledge. It is the theoretcal stipulations that
take away the self esteem of an entire community. As a
hindu, how do we deal with such issues? These are
important questions that will keep us nagging unless
we develop broad consensus.

With regards,
Ram Garib
