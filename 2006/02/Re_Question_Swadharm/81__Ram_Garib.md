I am afraid this is not advaita stand. Unlike
maadhwaas and sri vaishnavaas, in smaarta tradition,
liberation is available only to a renunciate. This is
how taittiriya verse "na karmanaa, na prajayaa.." and
the shwetashwatara atyAshramibhyah.., have been
interpreted by advaitins. In advaita, there is no
possibility of moksha without sannyasa. In
jivanmuktiviveka, Swami Vidyaranya argues that even
the knowledge of self cannot bring moksha without
sannyasa.

But the result is also different for dvija-s and
shudra-s! By following swadharma, dvija-s gain
eligibility to study vedanta while shudra-s do not.
Not having to go through the self-discipline is no
consolation if it bars one from the pursuit of the
highest goal.

Note that while some commentators permit shudra-s to
gain vedantic knowledge through gita etc., others
including shankara do not.

With regards,
Ram Garib
