Namaste,

Is the result of one work different from the other? If done with karamphala
tyaga all work in svadharma is equally rerwarding. We should not be attached
only "certain" kinds of karma but recognise that karma is only a means and
not the end which is moksha. Moksha is already attained by all. The karmas
done is only to get rid of mental incoherencies and mistaken notions. Your
quotes themselves say this.

As Jaldharji has pointed out this is a mistaken notion.

Abhishek
