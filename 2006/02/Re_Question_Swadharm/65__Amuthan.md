i guess 'kRShNamUrti' is not a family name. tamilians
generally have the (strange) habit of appending their
father's name to their own and don't use their family
name. for instance, my surname is tAtAchArya and i
never get to use it except when performing vaidika
karma-s. instead, i have my father's name R... added
to my name. that's how things happen in tam land :-)

i have a request. will it be possible to shift this
entire discussion to some mailing list on indian
culture or social structure of india? since there is
no single and common ground based on which arguments
can be made, different people start off with different
assumptions and keep arguing endlessly. 

no doubt svadharmAnuShThAna is an important issue, but
i get a feeling that the discussions are deviating
along a tangent from advaita.
