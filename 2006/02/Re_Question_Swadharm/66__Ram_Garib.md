I did not have any intention of turning this forum
into a debate platform for caste issues. However, I
got such valuable perspectives on this issue from the
learned members on this board that I could not resist
my temptation to dig deeper.

I apologize if my persistence led to deviation from
the list scope.

With regards,
Ram Garib
