This is not the verse I had in mind. There is a verse either in the
Jivanmuktiviveka (or perhaps the Panchadasi?) where Vidyaranya speaks
of all four orders being eligible for sannyasa, only their garbs must
be different.

I did not mean to say that the Sringeri Acharya had overlooked
"official rules", but that the "official rules" themselves
accommodate eligible non-dvijas taking up Sannyasa. The Kovilur Math
for example has the approval of Sringeri for their non-dvija
Sannyasis, so your claim that Sudras have not been given Sannyasa in
the traditional way does not hold water.

You have also mentioned "Vedic knowledge" being imparted without
caste considerations. Even in the Kovilur Math, the *Vedas* are not
taught to non-dvijas, but only texts of Shankara such as
Vivekachudamani. The Sankara Maths have always been on the opinion
that secondary Vedantic texts such as Shankara's independent works or
the Yoga Vasishtha can be studied by anyone, but have always insisted
that the Vedas are to be learned only by Brahmins.

However, Vidyaranya also specifically says that the *external marks*
of a Sannyasi such as saffron robe, Danda, etc. are superficial
requirements for Sannyasa, and that the real requirements are Viveka
and Vairagya. The meaning is that it is possible to be a true
Sannyasi without the "official robe and Danda", but one cannot be a
true Sannyasi without Viveka and Vairagya.

Shankara does say that the Shudras have eligibility to study the
Smritis and Itihasas, which includes the Gita. Vide the Brahma Sutra
Bhashya 1.3.38: "shrAvayet.h chaturovarNAn.h iti chet.h
itihAsapurANAdhigame chAturvarNyasya adhikArasmaraNAt.h ."

As I said above, I was referring to a different verse where all four
orders are mentioned.

As to Sankara Maths giving Sannyasa to women, there is some evidence
for this. There is an old posting by Vidyasankar at
http://www.hindunet.org/srh_home/1996_4/msg00177.html about women
given Sannyasa in Sringeri. I have also personally heard about some
women Sannyasis at Sringeri, so I'll try to find out more about this
topic.
