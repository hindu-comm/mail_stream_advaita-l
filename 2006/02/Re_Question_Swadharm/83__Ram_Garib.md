Thanks Jaldhar for providing the quote  along with
your analysis. You have very well covered the issue
from the point of view of gaining of knowledge. I
still have a doubt though, as mentioned in my last
post. Look at it from the point of view of sannyasa.
Advaita does not entertain the possibility of
liberation without sannyasa. sannyasa is available
only to a brahmin (or dvija). Without sannyasa,
vedantic knowledge cannot give fruit.  Is it not the
same loop again?

With regards,
Ram Garib
