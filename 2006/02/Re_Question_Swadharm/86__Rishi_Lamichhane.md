Dear Anantharamanji,

I think we disagree on this then - keep in mind that perhaps your
position is the official position smArta position, but it clearly does
not apply to all Hindus.

Just one thing about the example of the person you knew. It seems like
other relatives of the person who did not migrate consistently would
have maintained a tradition to do sandhyavandanam, so it would not
have been a dead tradition in the general community/family, but just
in the immidiate family. So in that case, I agree that after learning
that his family does sandhyavandanam as a nityakarma, it becomes a
nityakarma for him too.

Regarding scriptural evidence of nityakarmas one has some problems. No
one follows all the injunctions in the dharmashastras and there are
many different dharmashastras which operated reigionally. Now as far
as I know (please do correct me) there is no pramana for saying "of
all the stuff in the dharmashastra, this is the minimum requirment" -
this is established by each tradition seperately.

So no one follows all of their dharmashastra and the parts that they
do choose to follow as minimum requirment does depend on the
individual tradition. Perhaps if someone wants to learn Vedanta from
an orthodox smArta, he should follow the smArta conventions regarding
"minimum requirments" - I don't know what this is though,

Regards,

Rishi.
