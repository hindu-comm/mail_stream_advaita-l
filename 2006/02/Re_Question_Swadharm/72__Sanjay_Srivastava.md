Just as the much debated punishments of manusmriti, here also there is
wide lattitude between the strict theoretical stipulations and actual
practice. I am not sure about shankara maTha-s, but otherwise pretty
much no other established institution insists today on a particular
caste. Chinmaya Mission, Arsha Vidya, Divine Life Society, R. K.
Mission and even Kailash Ashram do not officially ask for caste of
their students. Of course the official shankar maTha policy still
remains ambiguous, but deserving students should not find any dearth
of other equally qualified teachers.
