Here the point is not that one in a million will reach Sri Krishna. But Sri
Krishna Himself says "svadharmo shreyah". Shudras are not allowed sannyasa
because it is not their svadharma. If you say will they gain moksha,
shastras and Shankaracharya say yes.

Now we are getting into "rights". The duties of dvijas are much more heavier
and difficult while the non-dvijas do not have such onerous expectations.
Now do these duties constitute "rights"? In my humble opinion they don't.
This is because these duties are like "self-punishment" or
"self-discipline". The shudras do not need these "disciplines" at all! This
is the conclusion of "svadharma" in the shastras. The moment we start
equating present society or economic statuses with the shastric injunctions
we commit the blunder of trying to equate apples and oranges since present
Hindu society is not outcome of the shastras.
