Are you referring to 1.10 where he quotes from Suta
Samhita? I think his reference to Suta Samhita is to
establish that the one who has this knowledge is
beyond caste and orders (not the reverse). He has
given Maitreyi's example to show that women also are
eligible for this knowledge, but then he also
distinguishes knowledge of the self from liberation.

With regards,
Ram Garib
