As far as we are concerned, the common ground is Advaita Vedanta and 
Smarta tradition.

This just means we have to keep it factual and not assume.

I for one think this subject is squarely within the scope of this list. 
To practice Vedanta 100%, one must take sannyasa.  As most of us are not, 
it is of utmost importance for us to know and practice our dharma and in 
order to do this we must know what dharma is.  Often it is the "corner 
cases" that can provide the most illumination on a subject.  I thank Ramji 
for providing a perspective that normally we might not think about.

Unfortunately I got very busy just as things were getting interesting but 
I shall write more in a little while.
