A third argument is to say, there is really no difference, yoga is the same
as advaita, because ultimately the Oneness of brahman is to be experienced
through yoga practice. In this thinking, advaita is theory and yoga is
practice.


sAshtAnga praNAms Sri Vidya prabhuji
Hare Krishna

I think this is very important point that needs to be elaborated at
length...coz. most of the modern day advaitins believe that scriptures are
like manuals & practice of yOga & experiencing of time bound nirvikalpa
samAdhi is the *tool* to open the knowledge of brahma jnAna etc.  Sri Vidya
prabhuji, I hope, you take this point on priority & clarify us advaita
vEdAnta's stand on this...

Your humble servant
Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
