In my previous post on this thread, I had written,

The SvetASvataropanishat verse numbering (2.14) is on the basis of the 
edition of BSBh edition prepared by Nurani Anantakrishna Sastri, containing 
the sUtra and bhAshya accompanied by bhAmatI, vedAntakalpataru and parimala.

The actual verse quoted in BSBh is

pRthv-ab-tejo-'nila-khe samutthite pancAtmake yogaguNe pravRtte |
na tasya rogo na jarA na mRtyuH prAptasya yogAgnimayaM SarIram ||

In most publications of SvetASvataropanishat, this verse is numbered 2.12, 
with a reading that has the word duHkhaM (sorrow) instead of mRtyuH (death). 
Both readings are found in manuscripts. The 13th-14th century commentary on 
this upanishat by SankarAnanda reads duHkhaM and the AnandASrama Sanskrit 
series edition reports both readings.

Regards,
Vidyasankar
