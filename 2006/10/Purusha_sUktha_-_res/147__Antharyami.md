Hari Om,
Namaste members,
Purusa sUktha as far as i've known is used only for NArAyaNa and it is not
suiable for anyother deties. i'm alarmed by knowing the fact about the
practice of purusha suktha being used for siddhi vinAyaka ? that too in
sringeri? purusha suktha  cleary indicates vyUha vibava avatArAs of visNu as
indicated by 'paramE vyOman' in taitirIya AraNyaka. four first Rks of the
purusha sUktha deals with the vyUha doctrine of para vAsudEva. moreover the
'hri' shabdha indicates goddess 'BhU' and lakshmi to goddess mahalakshmi
(those who find ambiguity refer to lakshmi tantra - an agamic
literature)- hreescha
te lakshmischa patnyau is para vAsudevan who is NArAyaNa alone. thus usage
of purusha suktha to other deities such as vinayaka or durga is improper and
is against agamic practice.hope people dont have any doubt to recognize
vAsudEva as NArAyaNa. SankarAcArya sufficiently menions vAsudEva as NArAyaNa
alone.
