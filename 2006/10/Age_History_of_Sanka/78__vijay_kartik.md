What sort of a light were you throwing when you said that " Also a festival
called sankara jayanthi made it's way into the almanacs only after it was
instituted by the Mahswamigal" ?
You mean none of the almanacs knew about sankara jayanti till about 1910a.d
.?
You mean none of the amnaya mutt's and their devotees were used to
celeberate sankara jayanti till about 1910 a.d.?
The light which you are trying to throw comes from a fused bulb...

  Of course, the practice of celebrating Shankara every year on Panchami day of the particular month was indeed instituted by Sringeri Acharya since 1910

  This has been continued by all Mutts since then.

  If there is any evidenct to the contrary , I would like to see the same.

  As far as I know Kanchi Acharya Chandrasekharendra Sarawsathi never visited Kalady in all his lifetime even though he travelled all over India.

  So Kalady never got any prominence in the Kanchi Mutt activities until in the 1970's the Keerthi Sthup was put up. Reasons for this, I would not know.
