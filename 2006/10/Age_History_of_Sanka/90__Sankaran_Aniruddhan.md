namaste,

Please note that at least one of the lineages seems to have
had AcAryas who have taken sannyAsa later in life (for
example, Sri Virupaksha Sastry). On the other hand,
sringeri has a long history of AcAryas taking sannyAsa at a
very young age. There is nothing surprising that there is a
big disparity in the number of AcAryas (this includes the
dvAraka and pUri mathas).
