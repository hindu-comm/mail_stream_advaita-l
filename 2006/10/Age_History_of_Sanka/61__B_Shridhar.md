Dear All,

I sincerely apologise in case I have misunderstood the intent of his message
as I too have high regard for Sri Vidyasankar's exposition of various
subjects. In fact that is what made me sad to find such a grey area in his
article.

To explain one example where I could see a bias was :

3. Renounce the belief that any great person who lived in India in the past
would had to have lived before Christ. Countless great men and women have
lived in India not only in the very distinct past, but also roughly in the
two millenia after Christ.

Now while rest of sankaracharya mutts proclaim an age of sankara to be
before christ (through their guru parampara of more than 70 acharyas),  only
shringeri mutt claim for a post christ dated age for sankara. Now by his
statement one is asked to open his mind to consider a post christ dated age
for sankara.

Another example being :

6. Renounce the beliefs that, if an institution is prominent today, or if
it's head is worthy of respect, it has been always prominent throughout
history or that all the historical claims of the said insitution are
correct.

In the general perspective one can take these statements logically but when
one understands the bais of the writer then one cant help requesting
restrain from such a seasoned scholar on such sensitive issues. For any
student, the Guru and the mutt which he heads is the ultimate by whose grace
alone he can even grasp and visualise advaitam.

I once again apologise in case I have read his message with a bias which is
in me.

yours truly,

B. Shridhar
