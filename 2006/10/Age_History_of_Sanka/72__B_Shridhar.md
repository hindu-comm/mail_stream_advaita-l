If kaladi was unknown to the world then from the time of birth of adi
sankara to the time of the 33rd acharya of sringeri peetam, all the previous
acharyas of the sringeri, dwarka, jyotir mutt, kanchi must have been
searching for a place called kaladi and then Lo! they were enlightened by
the 33rd acarya of the sringeri peetam.

If you must know some data, please note that the 33rd acharya of the
sringeri peetham was the one who located the samadhi of Mother Aryambal at
kaladi and built her samadhi there. Kaladi was not discovered by the 33rd
acharya but the samadhi was discovered by him. Get your history straight
before your comment.

  Also, a festival called Shankara Jayanthi made its way into the almanacs
> only after it was instituted by MahaSwamigal.


One has to call this devotion !!!!!!
