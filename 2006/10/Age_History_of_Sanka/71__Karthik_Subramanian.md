Namaste Shridhar,

Also why are they celebrating the sankara jayanthi at kaladi instead of chidambaram ? Please forward facts instead of fiction."

Kaladi was unknown to the world until Sri Sacchidananda Shivabhinava Nrsimha Bharati Mahaswamigal, the 33rd Peetadhipathi of Sringeri Sharada Peetam, discovered it in 1910 and consecrated shrines for Sri Adi Shankara, Sri Sharadambal and Sri Aryambal there. Only in the latter part of the 1900s did the Kanchi Mutt construct the Keerthi Sthambam in Kaladi.

  Also, a festival called Shankara Jayanthi made its way into the almanacs only after it was instituted by MahaSwamigal.
