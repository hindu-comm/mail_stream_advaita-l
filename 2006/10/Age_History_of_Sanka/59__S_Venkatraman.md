Namaste Ram Garibji,

I also drew the same conclusion as Sridharji did. If one has read the
earlier article (or was it a post?) of Vidyashankarji, the conclusion,
rightly or wrongly, forces itself on to ones consciousness. It hurt but I
kept quite out of deep respect for Vidyashankarji's erudition.

praNAms,
Venkat
