Are we all here, to read mails like this ? It really *hurts*. Vidya is
doing his best  to keep  cool  but  are  you taking the very group for
granted ? If you have issues please assert. Also I would request you to
think before you mail. Why don't you respect the group for its *name* at the
least?

Well Moderators Are you hearing ??

Abhishek has already reacted to this thread, but I would only like to
supplement that if this continues probably I need to log off from the list.

Hope my words are not harsh.

Thanks for the understanding.

Regards

Prasad kadambi
