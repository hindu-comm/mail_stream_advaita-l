Dear Sri Vidyasankar,

If this is the way we are to learn advaita, we might as well not do it.

praNAms
Hare Krishna

IMHO, this is not about  *learning advaita*,  this is only an attempt to
show the collected data to prove which maTha is superior to which, which
maTha has more advaita Acharya-s & which has the oldest tradtion
etc.....Sri Vidya prabhuji rightly pointed out  that the *tone* of some
members is not good enough to maintain the etiquette of this list...I think
being The Chief Moderator of this group he has every right to put a full
stop to this discussion.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
