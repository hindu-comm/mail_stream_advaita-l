Dear Shri Shridhar,

  Kindly note that the Kanchi Mutt website mentions the following in the portion relating to Guru-Parampara

  - Krpa Sankara strengthened the Shanmata form of worship
  QUOTE.
   He devoted himself, heart and soul, to the eradication of degenerate, obscene practices that had once again crept into religion after the Bhagavatpada's time, and restored purity. It fell to the lot of Krpa Sankara to continue and perfect the noble work that Sri Adi Sankara had inaugurated. Krpa Sankara pursued with great vigour, the work of the Master and enhanced the greatness of Shanmatas introducing a chastened mode of worshiping Siva, Vishnu, Ambika, Surya, Ganapati and Skanda UNQUOTE- 

  - Ujvala Sankara ( and not Adi Shankara ) drove Jainism away
  QUOTE 
  He was a great fighter of heretics. He went on Digvijaya and during his tours he drove the followers of Jainism beyond the Sindhu 
  UNQUOTE

  -Abhinava Sankara was the one who ascended Sarvajna Peetham at Kashmir and not Adi Shankara.Abhinava Shankara is oftern confused with Adi Shankara
  QUOTE
  He was one of the greatest among the successors of Adi Sankara, so great indeed that he and his deeds are often confounded with those of the Great Bhagavatpada and his deeds
  UNQUOTE
  QUOTE
  He ascended the Savajna Pitha in Kashmir
  UNQUOTE

  The theory that achievements and attainments of 5 different Shankaras (Including Adi Shankara) belonging to the Kanchi parampara have been confused by historians as relating to life of one Adi Shankara has certainly been propagated by the Kanchi Mutt.

  The website extracts above are only a pointer to that and not the only evidence for the same.

  It is not very difficult to locate the specific publications articles of the Kanchi Mutt which say so.

  Of course one will find quite a few references on the web also referring to this theory of the Kanchi Mutt

You are basing your theory on the article which appeared on advaita-L who
inturn reproduced a part of some author's book who claim that kanchi mutt
follows such tradition ?
How did that author conclude about this prevailing tradition at the kanchi
mutt?
Now what is the locus standing of that author based on which you concluded
that such tradition is being followed by the kanchi mutt ?
Where has it been documented in the kanchi mutt that they follow this
tradition.
I expected much more mature and stringent argument rather than such hearsay
stories.
In this sense, I feel you are no better than the innumerable fanatics of
each mutt who engage in mud slinging on each other's mutt.


For eg, if Sankara is claimed to have lived 2500 years ago, did he live
> before Buddha and therefore did not deserve the epithet ' Bouddha matha
> kandana"


There has been some quarters claiming the birth of buddha to be around 2,800
years. This seminar on age of buddha was conducted about 3 years back in
mumbai when they concluded thus. Further the site recommended by sri shyam
subramanian makes interesting reading too (www.easterntradition.org)


Again, some of the books the Kanchi Mutt rely on refer to Sankara having
> been born in Chidambaram! How to defend this?


Please clarify which books the kanchi mutt rely on. Further in case the
kanchi mutt relied on chidambaram as adi sankara's birth place then why do
they have a adi sankara sthupi at kaladi - it should have been at
chidambaram. Also why are they celebrating the sankara jayanthi at kaladi
instead of chidambaram ? Please forward facts instead of fiction.


Again Kanchi Mutt says Samkara ascended Sarvagna Peetha in Kanchi and not
> at Kashmir as tradition used to say.


Some mutts like the sringeri say that adi sankara accended the sarvagna
peetam at kedarnath, some mutt say the place to be kashmir and others like
the kanchi mutt claim it is at kanchi. So you mean that sringeri, dwarka
and kanchi dont follow tradition by claiming a place different from
kashimir ? Now what do you call as tradition ??

Again if Sankara is back dated to 2500 years, how to counter the claim that
> then some of the slokas and works do not appear that old?


How do slokas appear old ?? do they grow a beard ???

Again come out with a claim that some of the works written by later

Who claimed as above ? Has the kanchi mutt site declared that they shall
present only works of adi sankara on their site and the works of the other
acharyas are not going to be published ?


I read Muka Panchashati as part of my Sanskrit literature class and also

You informed that when you learnt muka panchasati, there had been no
reference to muka kavi being a part of the kanchi parampara. But that
argument is not sufficient to prove that muka kavi did not belong to the
kanchi mutt. Dont you think so ?

What about the Kanchi Mutt version about Vidya Theertha and Vedanta

Kanchi mutt should answer that..


You should be aware that even in the recent years books elaborating on

Please give references of the books when you mention thus..

Is this the way you seek truth ???
