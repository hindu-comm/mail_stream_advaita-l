can some one tell me whether the following verse is from upaNishad ? if so
which one ?
'AhAra suddau sattva suddhi ; sattva suddhau dhruvA smrti ; smrti lambE
sarva granthInAm vipra mOksha'
this verse clearly speaks about  vegetarianism.
Namaste

Antharyami
[J.Devanathan]

The above statement is in Chandogya Upanishad, 7.26.2. The term 'AhAra is
interpreted by SrI Sankara as not only what is eaten, but also what is taken
in through all the senses organs. So it means that one should only see,
hear, taste, smell and touch what is pure. In the matter of food it means
that the food should be sAttvic and not merely vegetarian, because
vegetarian food can also be rAjasic or tAmasic.
