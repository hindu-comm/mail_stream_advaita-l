There is, in the "Talks" of Ramana Maharshi, a delightful table that analyzes the various states of <samAdhi>. He speaks of <savikalpa> and <nirvikalpa>, but does not mention a <bIja-samAdhi>. Perhaps this "seed" samadhi is the same as what Ramana calls "sahaja sthiti": where Samsara and Nirvana are one. But the "seed" image does not make sense in this context. 

My favorite book, the Yoga Vasishtha, does not disdain yogic practices like Pranayama, or even [in the 3d book] the use of mantras and magic charms to Vishuchika the Goddess of Pain. But all these instructions are just to suck you into into realizing that jagat is mayA. 

My personal definitions would be: 

<sa-vikalpa> with <vikalpa> concept 
<nir-vikalpa> without <vikalpa> concept

The Savikalpa Samadhi is to realize the oneness of the Prakrti: to see that all material forms, and all subtler forms, are entirely one. It may end with those forms dissolving into atoms of light, and that light may explode like an A-bomb, and every atom sings and warms you, and you are an explosion of light and joy;--you know that you are sarvAtma, but have not the guts to play, afraid to lose your identity. Some say that you only get the Savikalpa once in a lifetime. Once is enough. Everything will originate from that vikalpa.

Nirvikalpa is easy. There is nothing to bother with. Look at the back of your head. There is nothing there. Look at that nothing. 

I lie. It is not easy. It is hard work to be everything and nothing at the same time, and still post this message. 

Would that be Bija?

Namste Vidyashankar-JI;

  Often there appears to be significant confusion about the terms used in "advita" and "Yoga" that have same and/or similar meaning.


  Could you please share your thoughts on  the terms "nirvikalpa", "savikalpa" and "sabiija" samaadhi !

  Thank you

  Dr. Yadu

described as a prerequisite or as an accessory to vedAnta vijnAna. In this, 
they have the support of Sankara himself, who describes yoga practice as 
"jnAna-sahakAri-kAraNa" at numerous places in the gItAbhAshya.

In fact, an undue emphasis on Yoga, with its accompanying notion that a 
nirvikalpa samAdhi experience ratifies the vedAntic truth, goes hand in hand 
with much more modern constructions of vedAnta, from the 19th century 
onwards.
