All,

I have asked this question before, but did not get an answer. I am trying 
again now.

What state of samAdhi is equivalent to the experience of jIvan MuktA? I tend 
to think that sahaja samAdhi is the equivalent state. I would like to know 
know whether this is correct. In anyway are the states are different? Please 
let me know.

Thanks,
Ravi
