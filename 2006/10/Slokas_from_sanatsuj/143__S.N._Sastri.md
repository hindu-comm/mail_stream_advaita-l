Here is the transliteration of the two (or one?) smriti quotes, the
translation of which are found just in the above quoted portion:

//yam vinidrAH jita-shvAsAH santuShTAH samyatendriyAH
jyotiH pashyanti yunjAnAs-tasmai yogAtmane namaH

yoginas-tam prapashyanti bhagavantam sanaatanam//

Will it be possible for you to check if the above forms part of
the 'sanatsujAtiiyam'?  If it is found there, could you pl. give the
Bhaashyam, preferably  both transliteration (if it is not beyond
four lines) and the translation?

With  humble praNAms,
subbu
Om Tat Sat

Namaste Subbuji,

The particular sloka mentioned by you is sloka 55 of chapter 47 of the
Shanti parva of the mahabhAratam, It is in BhIshma's stuti of Lord Krishna.
The sloka is as follows:

Yam vinidrA jitashvAsAH  sattvasthAH samyatendriyAH .

JyotiH pashyanti yunjAnAstasmai yogAtmane namaH ||

The meaning is:  I bow to that  effulgent supreme Being of the nature of
yoga whom yogis who are free from sleep (all tAmasic qualities), who have
contolled their breath, who are established in sattvaguNa, and who have
brought their senses under control by constantly practising yoga see
directly (have sAkshAtkAra of).
