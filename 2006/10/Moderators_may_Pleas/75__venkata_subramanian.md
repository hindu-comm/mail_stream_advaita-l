By the above you can see for yourself that the "... there was an ancient
site that was revered LOCALLY as the birthhouse of Adisankara..." Which
means that kaladi was known to everyone and due reveneration was being done
there.
But you deciphered that the 33rd acharya discovered kaladi which was unknown
to the world till then.
You must be the new columbus here !!!


Furthermore, I never said that Kaladi was unknown from Adi Shankara's time

What sort of a light were you throwing when you said that " Also a festival
called sankara jayanthi made it's way into the almanacs only after it was
instituted by the Mahswamigal" ?
You mean none of the almanacs knew about sankara jayanti till about 1910a.d
.?
You mean none of the amnaya mutt's and their devotees were used to
celeberate sankara jayanti till about 1910 a.d.?
The light which you are trying to throw comes from a fused bulb...

Also, if you thought I was dragging you into a debate or initiating one or
