Please refer to this section of the udyOga parva for sAtyaki's speech
condemning shrI balarAma (that sAtyaki should speak against shrI balarAma, I
find very strange; but in any case):
http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m05/m05003.htm
It clearly talks of usurping of the throne by duryOdhana.

As for someone being dead on account of living in the forests, could you
maybe point out a reference (since I haven't seen this rationale being given
by duryOdhana or the others on his side). And in any case, the pAnDavas were
in touch with the people for all the 12 years in the forest (for example,
duryOdhana's insult at the hands of the gandharvas etc.)


Looking at the whole thing from a different angle, if any of the advisors

I agree with you fully on this. In fact, this is one of the reasons that
could have tied bhIShma down (in that he was never disregarded by any of the
kurus). But since madhvAchArya criticized bhIShma's actions, I was wondering
about the issues of dharma involved behind such episodes.

Again, I completely agree. But then the dvaitins would give the example of
vidura (and yuyutsu too, though yuyutsu's case stands on shaky ground, I
feel). praNAm.h.

A.Siddhartha.
