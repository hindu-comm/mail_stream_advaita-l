praNAm.h shrI Vidyasankar,
       Thanks for clearing up the following issues:

This again emphasizes for me that mOkSha and dharma are slightly orthogonal
to each other as puruShArthas (in the sense that the nature and the means of
attaining these are different).

I am not sure if the vishiShTAdvaitins have a definite position on this. The
dvaitins, as I mentioned earlier, have a definite position.

Thanks for pointing this out.

I meant it in the following sense. For example, when bhIShma was on a
rampage exterminating the pAnDava army, shrI kR^iShNa did not bother
breaking his vow to stay bhIShma. And He mentions several times that He
would transgress his vow if need be. This is something which is difficult to
associate with shrI rAma whose adherence to the Truth (literally) is
well-known (this is conjecture, but given the rAmAyaNa, this seems very
likely).

 Absolute non-violence is an ideal; the reality falls far short.

I agree with you fully on this. The question though is how far to the
right/wrong side one is. In this context, the question is if bhIShma's
action was the best possible given the circumstances/norms of the day. For
example, would bhIShma going on a pilgrimage (like shrI balarAma) be a worse
act.
