Dear Siddhartha,

I did NOT point out that it's ultimately the writings which matter.
Quite the opposite, actually. All I said was that we can certainly
independently examine the writings of SSS (apart from his supposed
reincarnation).

My point remains: shankara insists on approaching a brahmavit
personally. If we had blind men for 1200 years, who did SSS approach?
More on this in another mail.

Again see my other mail on this. So is your contention that the "blind
men" achieved self-realization anyway? In that case, we could as well
accept the pa~ncapaadikaa, no? It is clear (to me) that SSS's
contention is that brahma-j~naana CANNOT be attained by understanding
vedaanta through texts like pa~ncadashii et. al, and approaching
teachers in that tradition because they are all "blind" men. Best not
to indulge in revisionistic versions of SSS's claims.
