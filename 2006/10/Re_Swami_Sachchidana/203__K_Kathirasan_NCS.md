Namaste Ramaji,

I must emphasise that I have learnt a lot from your posts in this list.
However, for the sake of clarity with regards to what you have mentioned
earlier (quoted below), may I know with whom did you learn Vedanta from?
Is he/she a Brahmavit/Sampradayavit? If your views are to be taken as
authoritative, shouldn't we use the same yardstick so that we can also
better appreciate your views? 

Om Shanti 
Kathirasan

My point remains: shankara insists on approaching a brahmavit
personally. If we had blind men for 1200 years, who did SSS approach?
More on this in another mail.
