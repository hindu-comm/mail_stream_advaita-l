Dear List Members and Sastriji,

  I am looking for  a Tamil translation (along with the original Sanskrit text) of Swami Vidyaranya's Panchadashi. If any of you could help me with a good copy or guide me to a reliable resource from whom I could buy it, I will be highly grateful. Pranams, Ramesh Ramanan.
