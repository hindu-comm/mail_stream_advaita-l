Ramaji,

  since you have asked this question earlier also- , i think i can also answer this.

  He had his intitiation (Bhashya Shanthi) from Jagadguru Sri Sachidananda Shivabhinava Narasimha Bharathi Mahaswamigal.

  He studied under Hanagal Brahmasri Virupaksha Shastrigal and K.A. Krishna Swamy Iyer.

  He had his Samnyasa from Sri Bodanandendra Saraswathi Swamigal (hence the title Indra Saraswathi).    

  This is what i study from his life history.   

  By the way, i fully agree with you that tradition is not got by book reading.   But is it not a fact that this Swamigal has read in the traditional way under Gurus.  he never book read himself....

  Dear Abhishek,

Can you point out where I said that SSS is wrong because he "went
against tradition"?

Sankara is clear that brahma-j~naana is to be obtained through a
sapradaayavit only. My observation was that a sampradaayavit is not a
BOOK written by a putative brahma-j~naani. Question is very simple:

shankara is clear on the need to personally approach a sampradaayavit.
Who did SSS approach?

Can we leave irrelevant details on logical fallacies out of the
picture here?. As far as I can see only Vidyasankar seems to have
understood what I have been saying, although I have taken great pains
to write the same thing over and over and over again.
