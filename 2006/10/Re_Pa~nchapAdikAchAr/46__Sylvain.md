(K. K.) What I was trying to say was that there are very very rare souls 
like Ramana who may fit into that exceptional category of seekers. As a 
rule, Guru is indispensable and irreplaceable.

How MA AnandamayI (1896-1982) can be considered ?  The only guru she had was 
the Absolute Guru without incarnation.
She is certainly an exception.

Namaste Venkatji,

Sorry for giving the wrong impression. My exposure to traditional Vedanta 
came from learning at the feet of a Guru. Hence, I totally agree that 
approaching a Guru is indispensable. What I was trying to say was that there 
are very very rare souls like Ramana who may fit into that exceptional 
category of seekers. As a rule, Guru is indispensable and irreplaceable.

   <<But today the Shankara's Bhashyas and the Upanishads are
available in writing. Are we to still maintain that an Uttama Adhikari
will still be unable to gain Brahmajnana through the study of these
texts independently? >>

No Kathiresan Ji, i dont think we can ever take this position. whatever it 
is, even with all books, cassettes, one has to learn from his Guru, i dont 
think that can ever have any other substitute.   The Guru gives not only the 
Upadesa of the "words", he gives more than that, which a book or a cassette 
cannot.

  Sringeri Jagadgurus are very clearly mentioning this again and again in 
their upadesha.  i dont think any one can question that.







Thanks & Regards,
Venkat.

Sadgurubhyo Namah.
