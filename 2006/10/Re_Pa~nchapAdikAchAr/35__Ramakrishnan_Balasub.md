Actually it is only SSS who keeps dragging bhaamatii and vivaraNa, so
this is reply to that.

This is utterly irrelevant, because he was talking about *other*
traditions. Sankara was clear  that he belonged to sampradaaya and
salutes his guru, who removed his ignorance and clearly that's who
shankara approached. He did not call his guru a blind man and
purported to correct his "wrong" views.

That may be Sri Siddhrathas view. Shankara is unambiguous that
brahmaj~naana is to be had by approaching a brahmavit only. If you
consider that as of secondary importance, please feel free to do that,
but don't expect me to agree with you.

Why drag XYZ into the picture here? They did not claim that they had
intellects superior to everyone who lived the last 1200 years, did
they?!!

That's a separate point. But an equally important question in the
advaita tradition is as follows: since brahma-j~naana is to be had
only from a brahmavit, who did SSS approach? Otherwise it is nonsense
to talk about Sankara being a brahmavit and belonging to sampradaaya
and that only SSS understood him after that.
