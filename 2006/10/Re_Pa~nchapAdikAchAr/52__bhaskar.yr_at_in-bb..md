Actually it is only SSS who keeps dragging bhaamatii and vivaraNa, so
this is reply to that.

bhaskar :

This dragging,  Sri SSS thought,is indispensable coz. later vyAkhyAnakAra-s
like bhAmati & vivaraNa have not done justice to shuddha shankara
prakriya...instead they have devoted their time to invent new things to
counter the objections from dualistic schools...

This is utterly irrelevant, because he was talking about *other*
traditions. Sankara was clear  that he belonged to sampradaaya and
salutes his guru, who removed his ignorance and clearly that's who
shankara approached. He did not call his guru a blind man and
purported to correct his "wrong" views.

bhaskar :

If the *difference* between mUlabhAshya & vyAkhyAna is quite conspicuous, I
dont think it is a big crime to bring it to the notice of the shankara
bhagavadpAda followers...Sri SSS exactly did the same thing...during the
process, Sri SSS might have made some passing comments...prabhuji, I dont
know why you are holding those passing comments close to your chest &
pointing out now & then..unnecessarily..

That may be Sri Siddhrathas view. Shankara is unambiguous that
brahmaj~naana is to be had by approaching a brahmavit only. If you
consider that as of secondary importance, please feel free to do that,
but don't expect me to agree with you.

bhaskar :

you are welcome to have your own opinion on it...I have no objection, but
kindly read out onceagain in what context the above statement has been
made...you were telling that Sri SSS is wrong while commenting on
vyAkhyAnakAra-s & your thorough study of both vyAkhyAna & SSS works brought
back you to square one etc. !! we are asking you to show us your indepth
analysis of the same...instead of doing that constructive work, I dont know
why you are simply holding some trifle comments & making it a big issue...

That's a separate point.

bhaskar :

But you know prabhuji *this separate point* is the need of the hour!!!...No
need to mention, every one of us (especially followers of Sri SSS) eagerly
awaiting your scholarly analysis in which you have promised us to establish
where SSS is wrong & vyakhyAnakAra-s are right in interpreting shankara's
prasthAna trayi bhAshya.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
