Namaste Kathirasan-ji,

Sorry to barge in here.

So he valued the sampradaya and also said that the sampradaya was all
wrong? That is what Sri Ramakrishnan has been pointing out. Anyway, I
am no expert on SSS, so will not say anything more about him.

The bhAShya-s have always been available in writing. The upaniShads
too have been available in writing for several centuries.

In fact, you have answered the question yourself. The guru has to be a
shrotriya as well as a brahmaniShTha. If the ability to rattle off
mahavAkya-s was enough, one could have had a parrot for a guru. In
today's times one could have a tape recorder.

But books, tape recorders and parrots can never substitute a real
living human guru.

As far as an uttama adhikArI is concerned, a single sravaNa alone is
enough to attain brahmajnAna. There is no need to study any texts. But
teaching advaita-vedAnta to a disciple is a different story. Being
brahmaniShTha does not guarantee being a shrotriya.
