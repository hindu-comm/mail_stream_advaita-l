Namste Vidyashankar-JI;

  Often there appears to be significant confusion about the terms used in "advita" and "Yoga" that have same and/or similar meaning.


  Could you please share your thoughts on  the terms "nirvikalpa", "savikalpa" and "sabiija" samaadhi !

  Thank you

  Dr. Yadu

described as a prerequisite or as an accessory to vedAnta vijnAna. In this, 
they have the support of Sankara himself, who describes yoga practice as 
"jnAna-sahakAri-kAraNa" at numerous places in the gItAbhAshya.

In fact, an undue emphasis on Yoga, with its accompanying notion that a 
nirvikalpa samAdhi experience ratifies the vedAntic truth, goes hand in hand 
with much more modern constructions of vedAnta, from the 19th century 
onwards.
