I am 34, my name is David , I have an unshakable faith in the Vedanta, I 
mediated in an ashram when I was about 16 in Florida but live in Texas 
now. Once I had an experience I would like to explain that is what gave me 
this unshakable faith. In the state I entered there was only a point, 
nothing else was left, no time, no past, not even the present, only a 
single point in an ocean like void. There was no form, only the point. I 
have recently finished the book Advaita Vedanta A Philosophical 
Reconstruction and enjoy the works of Swami Vivekananda from time to time.
