some addnl info from my researches:

It is very common to use Sri Sukta mantras for
upacharam in Maharashtra for devi pujas. 

it is also common to use the 1st anuvaka of rudram for
upachara puja as detailed in Sri Rudram by Anna (RK
Math)

I was told that using Purusha Sukta for upachara is
very beneficial by some priests and is used in Siddhi
vinayaka temple and also in a book published by
Sringeri. 

However during this Navaratri, I was told by some Sri
Vidya upasakas that using the Moola mantram for
upacharam is the correct procedure. 

regards
Vishwam
