List members,

I have seen PURUSHA SUKTA mantras being used widely for pujas to deities.

Is it a normal practice to use SRI SUKTA mantras for the shoDasa upachAra 
pujas for Mother Goddess?

Some Telugu people were doing the navarAtri puja this way. They told me that 
it is common in Andhra Pradesh.

Your input is appreciated.

Thanks,
Ravi
