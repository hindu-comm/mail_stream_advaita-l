I have also read that Mahamhopadhyaya Karungulam Krishna Sastrigal too came to Sringeri with his friend Hanagal Virupaksha Sasthrigal; for requesting the Jagadguru to grant him Samnyasa; but the Jagadguru (Sri Chandra Shekhara Bharathi Mahaswamigal) did not consent.

I believe it is a custom of the sringeri matha that only
the Successor to the AcArya is initiated into sannyasa by
the AcArya Himself. I remember reading this in one of the
works on Chandrashekhara Bharati Swamigal (I don't remember
the exact reference).
