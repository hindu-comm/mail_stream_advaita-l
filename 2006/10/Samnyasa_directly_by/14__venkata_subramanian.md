You are right, I can quote one reference.

  In the life history of Sri Ramananda Saraswathi written by Krishnaswamy Iyer, you can find the reference.  When it came about granting Samnyasa to Krishnaswamy Iyer's father, the Jagadguru said that we cannot grant directly.   

  The Jagadguru hence asked Nelamavu Matham Peetadhipathi (Swami Kamalananda Bharathi) to give Samnyasa.

  It was such a long sighted vision that later the Nelamavu Matham Swamigal attained sidhi quite unexpectedly and the next successor was initiated by Sri Ramananda Saraswathi - as suggested by the Jagadguru.

  I have also read that Mahamhopadhyaya Karungulam Krishna Sastrigal too came to Sringeri with his friend Hanagal Virupaksha Sasthrigal; but the Jagadguru (Sri Chandra Shekhara Bharathi Mahaswamigal) did not consent.

I believe it is a custom of the sringeri matha that only
the Successor to the AcArya is initiated into sannyasa by
the AcArya Himself. I remember reading this in one of the
works on Chandrashekhara Bharati Swamigal (I don't remember
the exact reference).
