It is my privilege to introduce three new members to Advaita-L.

Regards,
Vidyasankar

1. Sri Subramania Sarma of Chennai, India - Quite a few members of this list 
may already know of and may have corresponded with Sri Sarma. He has 
painstakingly rendered the texts of the taittirIya SAkha of kRshNa yajurveda 
in devanAgarI font with Latin transliteration, along with swara marks. These 
documents are available in PDF format at 
http://www.sanskritweb.net/yajurveda/index.html.

2. Sri K. Sundararaman of Chennai, India, is also probably known to members 
of this list. Actively studying vedAnta with Sri R. Krishnamurthy Sastri and 
Sri Mani Dravid Sastri in Chennai, he is also instrumental in bringing out 
publications and organizing study groups and lectures on advaita. Some of 
the documents they have published are already available from the Advaita 
Vedanta website. More information can be found at 
http://www.advaita-vedanta.org/mullaivasal/ and

3. Smt. Sharada Chityala of Long Island, NY, USA is a devotees of Sringeri 
Acharya. She and her family coordinate a few activities for Sringeri Sharada 
Peetham, its branch in Srirangam, the Sringeri Vidya Bharati Foundation - 
USA and SVBF - Canada. She is also a representative for Tattvaloka, the 
English language periodical published from Chennai, under the auspices of 
the Sringeri Peetham.
