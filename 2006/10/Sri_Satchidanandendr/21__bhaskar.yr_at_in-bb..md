praNAms sri sAvitri mAtAji
Hare Krishna

Thanks a lot for your timely clarification about the relationship between
our paramaguruji & shrungeri traditionalists...Even today, Sri SSS's direct
desciple Sri K.G.Subbaraya Sharma  giving discourses on vEdAnta & shankara
siddhAnta  in Shrungeri Shankara Mutt, Bangalore.  He has also been invited
to speak on shankara bhagavadpAda during last shankara jayanti celebrations
in the august presence of H.H. Sri Bharati tIrtha mahaswAminaH!!....Sri
SSS's another direct disciple Sri H.N. Lakshmi Narasimhamurthy has been
honored by shringeri authorities & awarded him some testimonials couple of
years back!!!  From all this, it is clear that there is absolutely no trace
of  animosity between shrungeri saMpradAya vAdins & our swamiji & his
direct disciples.

List members may kindly note that our Savitri mAtAji has been translating
Kannada book on biography of Sri SSS into English & the same is available
in Satchidaanandendra saraswati yahoo groups...She has already completed 12
chapters in that book in a lucid manner..

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
