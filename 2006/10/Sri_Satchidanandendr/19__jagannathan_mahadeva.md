Namaskaram,

Thank you very much. This article is quite informative for someone who
had no background knowledge about Swamiji.

Below is an historical question (no other intention except to know
more of the history):
Kudali shankara mutt was the center of Sri Ramakrishnans email
sometime ago. I wonder if the above excerpt refers to the same Kudali
mutt. Was this mutt also a branch of sringeri or did it have a line of
teachers independent of the sringeri mutt?

Quite well said. If only we get that nishta in the course of inquiry!
But routinely there has been mudslinging in many directions - quite
unpleasant for anyone who tries to stay true to their own guru
parampara and still participate in a satsang group that is composed of
diverse groups such as this list. Not all of us are from the same
traditional line although we all owe our loyalty to sankara's
philosophy. I suppose we should learn to appreciate that.

Jagan.
