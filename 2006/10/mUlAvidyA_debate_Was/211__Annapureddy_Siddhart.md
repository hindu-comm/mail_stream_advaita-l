Yes. Martha Doherty says that shaN^kara rejects the dR^iShTi-sR^iShTi vAda.
References are Pg. 224 and Pg. 226. The references quoted are BSBh 2.2.28,
and GKBh 4.3.28.

There are several posts by Sri Ramakrishnan in the archives on DSV,

Probably, the existence of elements of dR^iShTi-sR^iShTi vAda in shaN^kara's
works lends strength to SSS's arguments. I am not familiar with all the
issues involved, but right now, the issue of the nature of mithyA (or
not-Self) is probably key to understanding the differences between the
tradition and SSS.
