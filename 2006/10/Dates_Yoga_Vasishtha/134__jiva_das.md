This business of dates is almost funny. I have seen well-argued estimates for Shankara at 800 C.E. and 800 B.C.E, They say that Yoga Vasishtha [my particular study] must antedate Kalidasa, because a verse of Kalidasa is quoted in one of the early Prakaranas. How do we know that Kalidasa did not steal the verse from the Quasi-Valmiki? 
   Should Vedantis be so obsessed about time?
