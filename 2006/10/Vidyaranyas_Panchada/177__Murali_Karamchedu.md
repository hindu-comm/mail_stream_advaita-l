Dear List Members,

I've combined all the pages of jnaananda bharati swamiji's book into one 
single pdf.

Here is the URL:

http://rapidshare.de/files/37139059/panchadashi__jnanananda_bharati.pdf

It is a big file (~47 MB), so please be patient.

I checked the copyright policy of the Digital Library of India initiative, 
it appears that one would not be violating the rules, if someone feels 
otherwise please let me know and I will delete the file. Here is what their 
policy says:

"All the books that are currently available online have either been checked 
against their copyright re-registration directory in which books prior to 
1963 which are not re-registered are deemed to be out of copyright, or have 
been agreed by the authors. "

Sincerely,
Murali Manohar
