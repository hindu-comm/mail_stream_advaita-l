    I will answer all of your questions if you can answer the following
    question for me:

    "If all that exists is Brahman, where is the "room" for such as a
    thing as avidyA?"

    In case you think I'm "objectifying avidyA", how about answering the
    equivalently posed question from a "subjective" perspective:

    "Who or what is the locus of avidyA?"

Ramanuja knocks the foundation of advaita-vedAnta in SrI bhAShya
taking up this issue. Please see
http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/sbe48/sbe48028.htm

If I am not mistaken  (based on the previous discussion on this list),
none has satisfactorily answered these objections.


(Sylvain, I think that the leela theory will not fit into the
framework of advaita-vedAnta with its non-dual partless brahman. If it
is ascribed to ishvara, we will be back to the same locus question).
