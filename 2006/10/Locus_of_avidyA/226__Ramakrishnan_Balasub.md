I am surprised to see such an assertion on the advaita list of all
places. Ramanujas so called "objections" have already been considered
and answered multiple times by Sureshvara and Sankara. Most notably by
Sureshvara brilliantly in NaiSi (3.55-3.70). I am quoting from memory
here.

The so called objections are merely **rehashes** of puurvapaxin
statements present already in Sureshvara and Sankara. And these so
called objections were already largely given out by Bhaskara et. al.
No attempt has been made to object to Sureshvara or Sankara based on
their answers (not in the Sriibhaashya at any rate). I request
advaitins not to repeat some assertions made by some
vishishTaadvaitins on the internet, who have a very poor understanding
of advaita. Just go and open a random page in Naishkarmyasiddhi and
you'll see these so called objections have been stated by Sureshvara
and answered already.
