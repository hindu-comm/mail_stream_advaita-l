The website does not matter. There are certain logical fallacies that
we all should avoid. Appealing to tradition (like appealing to
novelty) is one such fallacy. For example, some claim that such and
such a religion is true because it is so old. No advaitin makes such a
claim as far as I know. Instead all the advaita authors base their
philosophy on certian pramANas, which is a different matter
altogether. That is all I had in mind when I said appealing to
tradition is a fallacy.

Regards,
Abhishek
