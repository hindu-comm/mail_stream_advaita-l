Namasthey. I have a request question to the learned team here.. If
this question is out of place here, the moderators may please delete
this question from this listing. My request is below.

Recently I attended one Rudra Ekadasi function (prior to
Sashtiabdhapoorthy) wherein all the participants were asked by the
Sastrigal to do 13 namaskarams i.e. while reciting some slokas &
wherein everytime the Sastrigal Team complete the stotra para with
"UmA MaheshwarAya Namah", we have to do one namaskaram... Like that
13 Namaskarams. Pl let me know what is the stotra name ? Can this be
recited in the daily puja by anyone? Is this available to me in any
Tamil Font? Can you please email to me in any pdf/scan file in tamil
font or send me the link if available in the net?



Thanks
