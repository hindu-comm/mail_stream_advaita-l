Dear List Members,

Similar to the panchadasi, I have combined the files of the VC bhAshyA into 
one single pdf. The link is:

http://rapidshare.de/files/37143495/VC_bhashya_chandrasekhara_bharati.pdf

As before, I assume I am not flouting any copyright rules, should anyone 
feel otherwise, please let me know and I will delete it.

Sincerely,
Murali Manohar
