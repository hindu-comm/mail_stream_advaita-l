Namaste,

  I remember reading Yoga to mean 'Samadhi':

( http://www.advaitin.com/AdvaitaTerminology.html - this web link is missing)

'yoga' derived from the root yuj has two senses:
1. Samadhi or concentration of the mind
2. yoke or unite (As pointed out by Vidyasankar-ji)


BKS Iyengar's website also clarifies that 'Yoga' means Samadhi :

http://www.iyoga.com.au/library/tranquil.html

The words Yoga and Samadhi- are synonymous terms conveying the same
meaning, namely peace. The means and the end of Yoga is Samadhi
which is the experience of Shanti (peace) within oneself.


It is interesting to note the resemblance between the meaning of the
words Yoga and Samadhi. Samadhi means union, bringing into harmony,
fixing the mind for attention on a single thought, intense
contemplation or meditation. Yoga is derived from the word, Yuj,
which means to join, to bind, to attach, to direct and concentrate
one's attention on, to use and apply. It is union of the Individual
Self with the Universal Self.
