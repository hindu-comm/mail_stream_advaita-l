Namaste Kathirasanji,
        Thanks for pointing out the book on vegetarianism in the Hindu
dharma. I could not reply earlier as I was away on a trip.

Could you also (or someone else) point out a good analysis of the episodes
in the mahAbhArata for learning about issues of dharma  -- reasons why
bhIShma did fight with the kauravas, whether it was dhArmic or not, etc.
Thanks.

A.Siddhartha.
