Subject: [Advaita-l] Unreal Can Point to the Real - parables of

> Unreal Can Point to the Real
> ============================
>
> A person went to sleep. He soon had a dream in which he
> beheld himself being chased by a ferocious tiger. Since the tiger
> was by far swifter than him, the distance between them shrank
> rapidly. He was overcome with fear. So terrified was he that he
> abruptly woke up, his forehead wet with perspiration. The tiger
> seen by him in the dream was undoubtedly unreal. However, it
> was instrumental in bringing about a real effect,awakening.
>
> Some people raise this objection : "According to the Advaitins, the
> world is illusory and Brahman alone is real. If so,
> the teachings of the Vedas, which are included in the cosmos,
> should be unreal. Hence, they cannot produce true knowledge.
> Consequently, Advaita philosophy, which is based on the Vedas,
> should be worthless.". This objection is invalid.
>
> Advaitins speak of the unreality of the world only from
> the standpoint of the Absolute. From an empirical standpoint,
> the world and the Vedas do exist.
>
> Another reply of the Advaitins is that an unreal object can,
> as in the example considered earlier, lead to the real.
>
> Hence, though being illusory, the Vedas
> can bring about enlightenment and, thereby, establishment in
> the Supreme.
