Dear List Members,

Happy Deepavali to all of you.

I've converted a few more books from the DLI and uploaded them onto a 
rapidshare folder.

Here is the URL:
http://rapidshare.de/users/LQZ6GA

Password: 'advaita' (no quotes)

I will continue to post any files I convert there until a more permanent 
home is found for them.

Sincerely,
Murali Manohar
