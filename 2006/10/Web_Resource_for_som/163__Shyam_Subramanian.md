I think this is a subset of the texts at 
http://www.sub.uni-goettingen.de/ebene_1/fiindolo/gretil.htm#Intro
which seems to have a whole lot of sanskrit texts. Some other links are 
at  http://home.wlu.edu/~lubint/texts/index.htm .
Of course, sanskrit.gde.to and http://www.sankara.iitk.ac.in/ (along 
with its associated
http://www.gitasupersite.iitk.ac.in/ , http://www.vedanta.iitk.ac.in/, 
http://www.yogasutra.iitk.ac.in/ etc) are probably well known.

Also, I would like to thank SrI murali manohar for his efforts in 
putting the pa~ncadaSI translation
in pdf form.

Regards,
Shyam
