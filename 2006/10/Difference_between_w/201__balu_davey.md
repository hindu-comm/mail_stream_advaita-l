Sri Sastriji,
Pranams & Deepavali greetings.
Your statement even the Maha Vakya ' I am Brahman ' is valid only in
vyavaharika  state is cent per cent true. Non-duality(advaita) is the
natural/unmanifest state, substratum.  Absolute is the substratum for
the empirical and phenmenal stand points/experience. In existence
alone things appear to disappear. In silence alone sound,whether music
or noise, is born to disappear.
pranams once again
