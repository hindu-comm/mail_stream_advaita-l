This is explained in the drishti-srishti vaadham
(based on my understanding, and I may be wrong here),

the analogy here is that the waking state is as real
as the dream state and as the dream state is unreal
(this is an acceptable statement and does not require
proof) so is the waking state.

by shifting the problem from proving that the waking
state does not exist, we just need to prove that the
waking state is as real as the dream state, which can
be logically derived by reasoning, by bringing out the
similarities in the two states.

Vishwam
