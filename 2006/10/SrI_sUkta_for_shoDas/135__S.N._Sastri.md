I have seen PURUSHA SUKTA mantras being used widely for pujas to deities.

Is it a normal practice to use SRI SUKTA mantras for the shoDasa upachAra
pujas for Mother Goddess?

Some Telugu people were doing the navarAtri puja this way. They told me that
it is common in Andhra Pradesh.

Your input is appreciated.

Thanks,
Ravi

Though not as common as the use of vedic mantras, SrI sUkta is also used for
shoDaSopachAra in pUjA to devi. This is an approved practice.
