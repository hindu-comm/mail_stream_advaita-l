Though not as common as the use of vedic mantras, SrI sUkta is also used
for
shoDaSopachAra in pUjA to devi. This is an approved practice.

S.N.Sastri

praNAms Hare Krishna

Yes, alongwith puruSha & Sri sUkta, we do use namaka maNtra-s also for
shOdashOpachAra pUja if one of the deity/symbol is shivalingaM... Anyway,
for shuddhOdaka snAnaM after paNchAmrutaM, we do recite whole sUktaM of
purusha, Sri.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
