pranams to all

  i would like to add that most of the temples here in bangalore too follow
  the same procedure of using purusha & sri suktham for the shodashopachara
  and this is how i have also been taught the devatarchana vidhi.Also
  various  standard books like the
  "Rigvedeeya devataarchanam" published by 'shri mutt' , hariharapura
  prescribe the same procedure.

  What about mahAgaNapati pUja ??  I have not heard any vEdic maNtra while
  doing mahAgaNapati shOdashOpachAra pUja  except at the time of AvAhana
  (gaNAnAntvA ganapatiM havamahE etc.), shuddhOdaka snAnaM (normally we use
  rigvEdIya sUkta *AtUna idrakshumantam chitraM grAbhaM saMgrubhAya...),
  maNtra pushpa (nishusIda gaNaptE ...again part of gaNEsha sUkta or
  gaNEshArthavashIrshaM )... Apart from this, for arghyaM, pAdyaM,
  AchamanaM, vastra, AbharaNa etc. etc. either  we use some stOtra or
  simply say, Sri mahagaNapatayE namaH, arghyamarghyaM samarpayAmi, pAdyaM
  pAdyaM samarpayAmi etc...Even in varasiddhi vinAyaka vratam we use
  purusha sUktam for pUja...not any *gaNesha* specific maNtra-s...Any info.
  on this??

  Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
  bhaskar
