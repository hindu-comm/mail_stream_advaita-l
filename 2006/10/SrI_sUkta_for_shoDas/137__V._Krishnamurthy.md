Namaste all

This is just to inform you all that as per my father's upadesha in 1953
I have been using both Purushasuktam and Shrisuktam in the
shodashopacharapuja in the daily panchayatanapuja as well as in the
special pujas on Shri Rama Navami, Janmashtami, Navaratri puja,
Vinayakachaturthi  Shivaratrietc. - though on these special days other
shlokas relevant to the particular deity (even these shlokas are not
what is printed commonly in books for these pujas. My father has
advaita-oriented shlokas for each occasion) are added for every
upachara. But the main mantras I use are an interweaving of the Purusha
suktam  with the Shri suktam.  It goes like this:

1. sahasra-sIrshhA purushhaH .... atyatishhTad-dashAngulaM;
hiraNyavarNAm hariNIM.....jAtavedo ma Avaha.     This is for AvAhanaM
2. purushha evedagum sarvaM .... yadannenAtirohati;  tAM ma Avaha
jAtavedo ... gAmashvam purushhAnahaM    This is for AsanaM

This goes on for all the shodashopachAra like this.

PraNAms to all
