Hi,

  I am Viswanathan from Chennai, India (currently in Pune, but relocating 
soon). I am a student oif Swami Paramarthananda (disciple of Swami 
Dayananda Saraswathi), and have been hearing / attending his classes 
(www.yogamalika.org) for about 3 years now.

  I would like to join this list to know about the views of other people, 
and especially to know more about the discussion that happen related to 
other beliefs such as Buddhists, tarka, mimamsa and nyaya shastra, their 
arguments and how advaita counters those arguments.

Thanks,
Viswanathan
