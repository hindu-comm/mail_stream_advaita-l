This is with reference to the Mayavada.This has been the point of
controversy since a very long time.Even Buddhism is called
"Mayavada"because since the Buddhist argument centres on Mayavada.There is
one important difference between Buddhism and Shankara's
"Brahmavada"because the substratum for the appearance of the world is
Brahman,where as for the Buddhism,the appearance has no substratum.It is a
mere appearance without a substratum.Hence,Shankara's definition of
Advaita is "Brahmavada"and not Mayavada.
