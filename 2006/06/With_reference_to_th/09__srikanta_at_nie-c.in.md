I have been following with interest the etymology of the word"Naryaana"and
the comments thereon by others.The recent Email by Sri.Rama says that the
worship of exclusively the God Narayana was not accepted by
Madhva.Infact,the whole of the controversies in the Bhakti cult reached a
crescendo only after the  mixing up of religious worship with philosophy
by the later cultists,be it Shaivaites and vashnavaites started.In his
Sutrabhashyas,Sri.Shankara never uses a particular personal God in his
commentary,just as other commentators use.That is the reason,why
Sri.Sankara's bhashyas stand out as most logical and rational in the
Vedanta school.
