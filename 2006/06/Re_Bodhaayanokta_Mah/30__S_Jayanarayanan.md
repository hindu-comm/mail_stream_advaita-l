I trust you are aware of the Sanskrit Documents Site at
http://sanskrit.gde.to/ .

The mahAnyAsam.h is at
http://sanskrit.gde.to/doc_trial/mahAnyAsam.html

The purushha sUktam.h is at
http://sanskrit.gde.to/all_txt/purushha.txt

The above documents are in the Itrans, but are easily convertible to
PDF format. The missing ingredient is svaras.
