(Jaldhar H. Vyas)  I don't believe I've heard those terms before.  Can you 
explain which context you heard them in?

                      *

These words : vyaktAvyakta, martyAmartya, kAlAkAla, sakalAkala, along with 
others : niruktAnirukta, shabdAshabda, mUrtAmUrta, appear in a book from 
Ananda K. Coomaraswamy (1877-1947), in a book probably titled Hinduism and 
Buddhism, since the French is Hindouisme et bouddhisme.
