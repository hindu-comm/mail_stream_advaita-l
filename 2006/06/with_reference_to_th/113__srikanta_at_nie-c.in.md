The line means"Being(or becoming)the Divine(devo bhutva), he verily begets
the divine(devam yajeta).The word "devo"(shining)here means the powers of
the Divine Gods like Indra and others who have become "Devas"and
"Devam"(The resplendent) is the special powers they obtain in heaven,and
"Yajeta"is like  begetting those powers,just like in the line"svarga kamam
yajeta"-they beget  Divine powers of heaven.
                          N.Srikanta.
