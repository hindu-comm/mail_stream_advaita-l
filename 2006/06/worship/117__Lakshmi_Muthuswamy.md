Namaste Dr.yadu

yadyatkarma karomi tattadakhilaM shambho tavaara dhanam

I would like to add the 27th sloka from Adi Shankara' s Soundarya Lahari

japo jalpah shilpam sakalamapi mudrA viracanA
gaitih prAdakshinyam ashanAdhyAhuti vidhih
praNAmah samveshah sukhamakhilam AtmArpaNadrshA
saparyAparyAyastava bhavatu yanme vilasitam

AtmArpaNadrshA = having offered my body, mind, prANa and my spirit to you and by the blessing of this knowledge that I am your svarUpa - jIvAtma paramAtma ikyam

jalpah =  let all the prattle that is done on vyavahara of the world

japah bhavatu = may it be your mahamantra japa

sakalam shilpamapi = let all the activities performed by the movement of the arma and the legs

mudrAviracanA bhavatu = may it be the ten mudras - samkshobam, vidsAvaNam, AkarshaNam, vasyham, unmAdam, mhAnkusham, kecari, yoni, trikandam

gatih = let even the accidental walking 

prAdakshiNyam bhavatu = may it be pradakshiNam circumambulation for you

ashanAdi = let the food and the drinks consumed

Ahuti vidhih  bhavatu = may it be the sacrificial rituals/ homa anushthAnam

samveshah = let the lying on the ground

praNmah bhavatu = may it be my prostrations namaskrams

evam = in this manner

Sukham= all that can give me comfort and joy

me = my

yat = whatever

vilasitam = play, sport or pastime, enjoyment

akhilamapi = including all the above

tava = your

tava saparyAparyAyah  bhavatu = may it be in the form of Your puja

This is  prayer ultimate.

 I understand Kanchi ParamAcharya has written exhaustively on Soundarya Lahari in Daivattin Kural book-6 in tamil. Could some one translate the interpretation of this sloka from the book.
