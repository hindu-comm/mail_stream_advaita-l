Srikantaji - PraNAms.
advaitam word comes in the seveth mantra itself in the description of
turiiyam.  Because of the importance of the word, Goudapaada writes one
full chapter of kaarika - advaita prakaraNam. In the 12th mantra the
equation of amaatra of Om with turiiyam is discussed. The descriptions
of turiiyam and amaatra of Om run somewhat parallel. 

Hari Om!
Sadananda
