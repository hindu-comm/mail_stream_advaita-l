Namaste.
Regarding how the word"Advaita"came about,we see this in the !2 sloka of
the "Mandukya Upanisad"It was SriGaudapada preceptor's
preceptor(Paramaguru of Adi Sankara who for the first time systematised
"Advaita"
through his karikas on Mandukya Upanisad.
Advaita means,Non-dual.The Brahman appears as the world.
SriGaudapada says:Advitam paramartho hi,dvaitam tad bheda ucyate.
