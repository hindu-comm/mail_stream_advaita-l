I have posted Nirvanashatkam of Sri Sankaracharya as a pdf text on my
website

www.geocities.com/snsastri.  The slokas have been given in Devanagari script
with English translation and detailed notes. Hastamalakiyam is already
there. 70 slokas of Satasloki have been posted so far with translation and
notes. I invite the members to visit this site. I would like to invite the
attention of members who have recently joined to the item 'Terms and
Concepts in Advaita'.
