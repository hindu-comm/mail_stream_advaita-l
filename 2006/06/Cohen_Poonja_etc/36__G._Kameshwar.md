  My thoughts on an aspect of the above posting....

  Sri Ramana's being was that state of Advaita that there was no bheda-buddhi....just as stated in the Dakshinamururthy Ashotra of Bhagavatpada, there was no room for shshya-acharya bheda at all....while anyone can have the bhava that Ramana is his or her guru, Ramana himself had no vritti that anyone was apart, and thus who is to be a disciple or otherwise....

  while this logic is equally true of all Jnanis, some may have an Acharya role in vyavahara, when they do have 'declared' shishyas....For Ramana, this wasnt the case....

  best regards
