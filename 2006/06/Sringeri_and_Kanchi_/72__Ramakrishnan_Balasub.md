I have no disagreements with what you write. But I also think all
these siddhis are quite rare. Most of the miracle mongers are very
likely cheats. That's what Mahasannidhanam has mentioned in one
conversation (published in a book). For the layman, if the amazing
James Randi did not advertise himself as a magician, he would look
like a yogi with siddhis. He might just have to make his beard longer
or act eccentric, with hopefully some mystic mumbo-jumbo thrown into
the mix :-). By paranormal phenomena, I mean obeying known physical
laws. I don't think these are transcended that easily.

The sAdhana pAda the second chapter mentions the Abhyasa of ashtAnga yoga and the phalam of the abhyAsa thereof in the third chapter vibhUti pAda. There are quite a few listed. There is no emphasis or mention of any particular practice to gain the siddhi . This requires years of intense training and abhyAsa in this janma under the guidance of a competent AchArya or may fructify with very little abhyAsa as a continuation of the previous janma. At the end of the chapter Sage Patanjali  also says that siddhis are a hinderance to spiritual sAdhana.

Spend their lives seeking these experiences again and again and may be more and more of them.  Sometimes they can go insane. Sometimes they get stuck poerforming these siddhis and lure the common man.
