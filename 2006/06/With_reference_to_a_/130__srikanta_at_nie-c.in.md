Wit reference to the above,the equivalent name for "Kataka" is
"kadukkai"in Tamil,a natural purgative which is still used in Ayurveda and
siddha medicinal systems.The name"Kataka"in sanskrit is named"Kadukkai"in
Tamil.Incidentally,the"kadukkai"was used by Sri Ramana Mahrshi in his
ashram by Sri Ramana himself and his disciples.Many devotees used to bring
bagfulls of "Kadukkai"to the Ashram,as is found in books on the Life of
Ramana.Its Kannada equivalent is "Alalekai"which is used by reputed
Ayrvedic pundits.
