Dear ShrI Sastri

Thank you for this message.

In the Capeller's Sanskrit-English Dictionary, a search for the word 
unmanifested result with - avyakta -.

In the Cologne Digital Sanskrit Lexicon, the same search result with 
aprakaTa -.

Are « thoughts » considered as avyakta or aprakaTa ?

Sylvain
