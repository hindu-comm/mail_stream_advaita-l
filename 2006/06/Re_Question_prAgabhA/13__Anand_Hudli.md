The liN^ga sharIra does not get destroyed but goes back to its causal state 
in deep sleep. The situation is similar to the destruction of a pot by the 
stroke of a hammer. The pot does not exist in its own form, ie. as a pot, 
but it exists in its causal form, the clay. Please see, for example, advaita 
siddhi's third definition of unreality 
(http://www.advaitasiddhi.org/part19.htm).

However, there is no functioning of the liN^ga sharIra in deep sleep. One is 
not aware of things such as the mind or intellect as in the dream and waking 
states. Yes, the intellect does function in the dream state because there 
are instances of problem solving in dreams.

Anand
