Namaste Hudliji,
                    I have a question on your explanation of the
liN^ga sharIra and avidhyA. When you said that the liN^ga sharIra
dissolves in deep sleep, how then could it have been generated again
(with all the corresponding vAsanAs) when you come out of deep sleep
(or is it the case that the deep sleep you refer to here is not the
dreamless sleep that we all experience). Or if you meant that the
liN^ga sharIra is dormant in deep sleep, that still means that it's
existing. Could you please clarify this issue? Thanks.

A.Siddhartha.
