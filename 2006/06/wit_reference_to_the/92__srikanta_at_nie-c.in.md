I am reading with interest the above discussion.from the advaitic point of
view the views of "Pratibhasika"and "vyavaharika"points are tentative
assumptions only.However one goes through the analysis of these points one
gets entagled in the mire of logic.For a Jnani like Gaudapada,all the
states including waking state is false at one stroke.All are  appearances
in Turiya.He declares:
Prapanco yadi vidyeta nivarteta na samsayah!
Mayamatram idam dvaitam advaitam paramartathah!!

Svapanamaye yatha drste gandharvanagaram yatha!.

In the Alatasanti prakarana,he declares that even the mind is not born

Etasmat jayate na cittam citta drsyam na jayate!
Ye pasyanti te jatim khe vai pasyanti te padam!!
The appearances for the mind are not born,nor even the mind.Those who see
the birth of the mind,see the footprints of the bird in the sky!

                                                      N.Srikanta.
