Regarding the discussion on the meaning of the word"Avyakta",in  the
vedanta and the Sutrabhasya of Sri.Shankara,the word"Avyakta"is meant that
it is unmanifested.That is,which is in the "Hiranyagarbha Brahma".there is
difference between "sankalpa"and "thoughts"."Sankalpa"means which is
already determined.But,thoughts cannot be categorized under this."Avyakta"
means "asphuta"which is not clear.
                                                   In this way in the
discussion of the
word"asat"Srisankara
takes the meaning of
"avyakta"and not as
nullity or emtyness,as
a Bauddha does.
