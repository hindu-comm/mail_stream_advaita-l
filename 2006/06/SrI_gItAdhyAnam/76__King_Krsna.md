Lakshmi gaaru,

Thank you for the reply to my post.  You mentioned
that SrI gItAdhyAnam is a work of SrI madhusUdhana
saraswati.  If so can you please tell the dvaitin's
stand on this.  Do they accept this.  From what I have
observed it seems to be that V.Advaitin's accept the
sloka.  So how would they interpret the meaning of the
word advaitaamruthavarshiniim.

Thanks and Regards,
K. Krishna Chaitanya
