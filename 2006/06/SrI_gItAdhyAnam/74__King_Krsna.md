Dear Members,

SrI gItAdhyAnamu

pArthAya pratibOdhitAm bhagavatA nArAyaNEnaa swayam
vyAsEna grathitAm purANamuninA madhyE mahAbhAratam
advaitAmRtavarshNIm bhagavatE mashTAdaSAdhyAyinI
mambatvAmanusandadhAmi bhagavadgItE bhavadvEshiNIm

This a sloka from SrI gItadhyAnam, which appears at
the beginning of most of the books on
Srimadbagavadgita.

May I know the source of SrI gItAdhyAnam.  Is it
accepted by all the different schools of vedanta. 
What is the dvaitins stand on this particular sloka. 
It clear mentions that gIta shower the knowledge of
Advaita.

I got a copy of Sri Ramanuja's Gita Bashya from the
Ramakrishna Mutt, Mylapore.  There is mention of the
above sloka in the introductory pages of the book.

Regards,
K. Krishna Chaitanya
