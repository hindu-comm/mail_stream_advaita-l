Dear list members,

 Thank you all who answer me about a definition on sin from advaita vedanta point of view, and hinduism in general. The explanations were ALL relevant, especially from  Dr. Yadu Moharir, and  from Sadananda with the wisdom words of  Swami Chinmayanandaji. 
God Bless You all.
Best Regards,
M.D.B.R
