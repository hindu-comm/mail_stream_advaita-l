Dear list members,

IÂ´d like to know a definition on sin from advaita vedanta point of view, and hinduism in general. And, if its possible some indication of this in books and sites. Some people says that in the Bhagavad GIta, the best word for pataka or papa, or words like that, is not sin, what do you think about that? The problem is to define sin in the bhagavad gita's point of view, seems like sin had two definitions, one is about the bad result of action, and the other side, is a bad action.

Best Regards,
M.D.B.R
