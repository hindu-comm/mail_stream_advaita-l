Hello!
Do you have the transliteration for the chant by Sureshwara Acharya
TO THE ONE WHO IS PURE BEING CONSCIOUSESS AND BLISS
WHO DWELLS IN THE MNEDITATIVE POINT BINDU AND THE INNER SOUND NADA
WHO IS EMPTY OF BEGINNING MIDDLE AND END 
TO THE GURU OR GURUS
BE THIS BOW
Thank you in advanced for the information - I heard the chant on a Richard  
Freeman CD (The Yoga Matrix) and would love to chant it myself but can't make  
out all the Sanskrit words.
Sincerely
Jill
