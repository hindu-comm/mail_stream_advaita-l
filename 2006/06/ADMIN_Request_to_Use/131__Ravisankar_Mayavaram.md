When posting to the list, please use appropriate subject lines --  one
that would convey the  main subject addressed in the post.

If the thread derails into something else, then you can change the
subject line and indicating in the contents that you have changed the
subject line.

Please avoid using individual poster names in the subject lines, such as,
"In reply to so&so's message".  It is makes very little sense, when
you are reading the archives.  In a list, unless you are starting a
new thread, you always reply to what someone else has posted, that
need not become a subject line. Inside your post you can always
mention it by quoting *only* the appropriate portions from the
previous message.
