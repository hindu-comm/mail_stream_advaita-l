The brahmavaadina.h in the yajur veda typically discuss the detail of
some ritual or some meditation associated with it. While advaita (as
we accept the term) accepts this as valid, rituals and meditation are
indirect descriptions of the non-dual brahman. So it's a little
different from the upanishads, which have the most direct way such as
neti. neti, etc. The exposition in upanishads (direct) is what we
typically call advaita these days.
