Dear List Members,

I am trying to understand a particular sentence in the gUDhArthadIpikA, 
under 4.35. Here MS says:

yatpUrvoktam jnAnamAcAryairupadiSTaM jnAtvA prApya |
odanapAkaM pacatItivaktasyaiva dhAto: sAmAnyavivakshayA prayogaha. |

(Loosly, the first sentence is translated as  "knowing, having acquired, 
that aforesaid
knowledge instructed by the AcAryA"; the second sentence qualifies the verb 
in the first
one. It says, the verb should be treated as the figure of speech similar to 
the sentence
cooking the boiling rice)

I dont get the relevance of the elaboration, from odanapAkam onwards,  of 
this figure of
speech for the word jnAtvA here. Could someone help me understand please?

It goes on to say 
Na punarmohamevaM bandhuvadhAdinimittaM bhramaM yAsyasi
(You will not be under such delusion again such as killing of relatives 
etc.)


The BG verse is 4.35:

yajnAtvA na punarmohamevaM yAsyasi pANdava |
yena bhUtAnyaSesheNa drakshyasyAtmanyatho mayi ||


Respectfully,
Murali Manohar
