exactly, stating something is not a proof of that something. thats
what the vedas also do.

the "true" theory, if it exists, _may_ be established by refining
current understanding (changing theory). the chance is FAR less if a
static archaic theory is adhered to without justification.

who's trying to prove? only trying to presuppose the existence of a
conscious self here. But God forbid I assume the existence of a
conscious self without studying the vedas! (please read sarcasm)

that's what vedic statements are. speculations on the part of the
seers. go to 1.

yeah, science has to agree with the "fact" that the priest should not
sit facing west during the concluding of a yagya. only then will the
yagya bear fruit.
