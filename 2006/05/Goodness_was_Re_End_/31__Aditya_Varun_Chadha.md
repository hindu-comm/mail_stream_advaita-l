The basic principle of advaita is the identity of Atman and brahman.
brahman is the essence of all existence, the supreme, ONLY existing
"being". Atman is the Self, and is the same as brahman, for brahman
alone exists. The existence of brahman is not contingent upon the
vedas. The vedas ONLY state the fact of its existence. If another
"seer" comes up with the same statement without resorting to the
vedas, is he wrong? No.

That brahman exists can be understood without resorting to the vedas,
albeit having not taken the vedic route, one might end up _calling_ it
"Chunky". Chunky exists, and exists alone.

Did brahman come into existence only when (or after) the vedas were
heard/penned down? You believe in the infallibility of the vedic
seers. I do not believe in it. So I can say that while brahman exists
and exists alone (with or without resorting to the vedas), I can also
say that the the vedic yagyas for sons or rain are useless, without
affecting my independent belief that brahman alone exists.

In fact, I came to know the words "advaita", "brahman", "Atman" etc.
_much_ after I felt and formulated the universal uniqueness of
existence. Only then did I start exploring. So was my belief wrong
until I started exploring the vedic version of the same phenomenon?

the point is that the belief in the onlyness of brahman can be
acquired and held without ever reading the vedas. no derivation, just
waking up one day and saying, YES, brahman exists. How to justify this
claim? No justification required, just like vedas don't give any
pratyakSa justification for the onlyness of brahman, they just state
it. So do I, without resorting to the vedas.

Or he/she has never read any of these Slokas and he accepts the
onlyness of brahman through coming up with these concepts through
thought, dreams, etc.

Again, no justification required. I hold the belief, without even
knowing about the vedas. I believe in it. Period.

in other words, we are not here to discuss our own delusions of what
the truth is, but rather to discuss the delusions of the Vedic seers
of what the truth is.

If a jIvanmukta has never read the vedAs and is jIvanmukta, he saw the
axioms of advaita as pratyakSa. If I come up with some axioms of
Zermello and Frankel by myself and derive some of the theorems that
their set theory derives, I can say that I derive part of ZF
set-theory from my own original work. All I need to show is internal
consistency, and as long as I cannot derive a theorem that is
disproved in ZF-Set theory, I have come up with part of ZF-Set-theory
by myself.

Either you revise your basics of logical thinking, or point out the
flaw in my thinking.

So what you are saying is that an "advaitin" is defined as one who
studies and follows the vedas. So there cannot be a jIvanmukta who has
not completely read the vedas. nice.

u cannot expect advaita to nod at the whims and fancies of the vedic
"seers" either. I am arrogant enough to say that the vedas CAN be
wrong on certain statements. It is not upto traditionalists to force
me to cut down ALL relations with the vedas. I accept parts, I reject
parts.

Understand that it is you who BELIEVES that the vedas are infallible.
Same thing as someone believing einstein is infallible. On the other
hand, I am saying that einstein was fallible, but his theory of
special relativity sounds pretty correct.

don't talking without substance. study of the vedas does not guarantee
understanding of advaita, not studying the vedas does not guarantee a
non-understanding of advaita. that is all I am saying.

justify (prove) your "simple fact". Show me how advaita is affected if
I say that the priest should face South (and not in the direction
prescribed by the vedas) during a particular yagya.

con·tra·dict:
To assert or _express_ the opposite of (a statement).

atleast know the words you use.

There's nothing to be offended about here. Your replies are not very
"straight" anyway. show me the illogical nature of my statements.
