Dear Members
Can anyone post on this list where the Book " Raghaveeya Yadava" written by
a Tamil Poet in Samskrit is available preferably on the Net. I learnt that
this is a wonderful composition in which the sentences read from left to
right is Ramayana and the other way, it is Bhagavata. The whole  book
consists of 40 verses only and published by LIFCO Books. But I am unable to
get this book from any shop in Mumbai.
