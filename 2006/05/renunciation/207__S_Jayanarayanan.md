All of the above words are close in their meanings, with some subtle
variations. The Sanskrit word "saMnyAsa" is usually translated as traditional
renunciation.

A friend of mine once attended a satsang of American devotees of Ramana
Maharshi that involved a charge of $15 per person (for no reason other than the
satsang gathering itself). My friend recalled an instance when RM had
prohibited the use of RM's name to make money. Nowadays, my friend conducts
satsangs in his own house free of charge.

Point is - if one unable to adhere to dharma, practising Atma-vichAra is quite
meaningless.
