tyAga is relinquishing ownership.  Its origins are in sacrificial 
concepts.  When one makes an offering, it is followed up by a statement 
that the offering is for some God not for oneself.  From this it expanded 
to mean relingushing all material posessions.

nivRitti-mArga is the whole process of decreasing attachment that 
culminates in renunciation.

Vairagya is dispassion.  A lack of interest in worldly ambitions which is 
the key to renunciation.

I would agree that sannyasa most directly means renunciation.
