Namaste.The discussion on the etymology of the word"Narayana"is
interesting.The word"Narayana"can also be interpreted as
"Nara+ayana",which means the path of Naras,i.e Men.Just like
"Dakshinayana" and "Uttarayana","Narayana"also means the one who follows
the path of "Naras".In the "Mangalacharana" of the IV th chapter "The
Alatasanti"prakarana,Gaudapada pays homage to"Dvipadam Varam",the best
among the bipeds,i.e Men.SriSankara in his commentary
writes,'Purushottama"following the Bhagavad Gita.
N.Srikantan.
