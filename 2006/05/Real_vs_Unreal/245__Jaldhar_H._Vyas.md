I think the use of the word real can cause this type of confusion.  So 
better terms would be true and false.   The problem is not so much that 
the rope is not really a snake; after all it can still have real effects 
such as giving you a heart attack if you step on it in the middle of the 
night.  The real issue is understanding.  We misunderstand the true nature 
of the rope when we mistake it for a snake.  This misunderstanding causes 
the dukha of samsara which has to be remedied by mukti.

Classical Yoga darshan believed in multiple first-order real atmas 
(purushas)  Ishwara is a seperate kind of first-order real.

Classical Samkhya dispensed with Ishwara altogether.
