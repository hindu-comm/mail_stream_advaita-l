The AtivAhika-sharIra is the combination of what ?
In other words, what will be the baggage of the egocentric jiva after the
physical body is destroyed ?

Detailed descriptions of the course of the jiva after death , extracted from
Sri Sankara's Bhashya, are given on my website www.geocities.com/snsastri

in the article 'Transmigration' under the heading 'Terms and Concepts in
Vedanta'. If any further clarification is required I shall provide the same.
