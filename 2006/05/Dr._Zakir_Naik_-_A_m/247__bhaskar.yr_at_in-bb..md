Dr.Zakir Naik is a scholar in Islam religion but speaks with great
authority about Christianity & hindu dharma as well (he quotes Rig,
YajurvEda, BG & other hindu scripture by heart with exact verse & chapter
nos.!!!)..just wanted to know whether anybody in this group met him
personally or via E-mail for any discussion??  Just an inquisitive
question...since the subject is out of the scope of this group...I request
members to directly write to my ID...
