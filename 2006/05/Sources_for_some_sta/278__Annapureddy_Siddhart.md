Namaste all,
         Could someone point out the sources for the following statements:
-- In this post by Anand Hudliji,
http://lists.advaita-vedanta.org/archives/advaita-l/1998-April/009003.html,
he says "Shankara himself agrees that even a hundred shruti statements
cannot make fire cold." Which work of Samkara records this?
-- Also, while talking to a Vaishnava friend of mine, he was mentioning how
Narayana is a proper name and not a title because of the "second" na used at
the end  (in accordance with a grammatical rule of Panini). He also
mentioned that Appaya Dikshita gave up on establishing the Siva
Sarvottamatva because of this. Could someone provide more background on the
grammatical issues involved and the source for Appaya Dikshita's statement?

Thanks.

A.Siddhartha.
