The GItA Bhaashhya 18.66 (Swami Gambhirananda's translation):

"The validity of the Vedas holds good only with regard to matters
concerning the relation between ends and means of Agnihotra etc.,
which are not known through such valid means of knowledge as direct
perception; but not with regard to objects of direct perception etc.,
because the validity of the Vedas lies in revealing what is beyond
direct perception. Therefore it is not possible to imagine that the
idea of egoism with regard to the aggregate of body etc., arising
from an obviously of false knowledge, is a figurative notion. Surely,
even a hundred Vedic texts cannot become valid if they assert that
fire is cold or non-luminous! Should a Vedic text say that fire is
cold or non-luminous, even then one has to assume that the intended
meaning of the text is different, for otherwise (its) validity cannot
be maintained; but one should not assume its meaning in a way that
might contradict some other valid means of knowledge or contradict
its own statement."

This is mentioned in Mr. S.N. Sastri's valuable webpage at
http://geocities.com/snsastri/

This has been discussed several times before. I would request your
friend to provide the exact reference of Appayya Dikshita's work
first.
