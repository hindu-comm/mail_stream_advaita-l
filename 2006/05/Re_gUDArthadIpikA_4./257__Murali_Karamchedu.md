Not if we use 'cooked rice' as the goal being pursued by cooking; as you 
articulate later.

If we pursue the second part of  interpretation, where food/odanapAkaM/na 
mohaM reflect the result, then is it really a redundancy that is being 
brought out? Seems more like the imminence or inevitable concomittance of 
the result.
