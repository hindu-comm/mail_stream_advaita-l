I was holding off on responding to this till I got the reading of the 
gUDhArthadIpikA confirmed. vaktasya is not grammatically correct, as the 
root is vaktR (speaker) and the word would get declined like pitR (father), 
bhrAtR (brother) etc. The genitive case would therefore not be vaktasya but 
vaktuH.

I was mentally emending the reading to odanapAkam pacatItivat tasyaiva (= 
odana pAkam pacati itivat tasya eva), but would like to confirm if that is 
the case before I try to interpret the metaphor. If the reading of the text 
is indeed ... pacatItivaktasyaiva ..., then the pada viccheda (parsing) of 
the phrase is unclear to me.

Meanwhile, please note that odana refers not just to rice, but to cooked 
rice (in general, any cooked grain).

Regards,
Vidyasankar
