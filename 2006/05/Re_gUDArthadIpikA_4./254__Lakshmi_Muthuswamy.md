Namaste Vidyasankar 

Thanks for pointing out the error.
Yes I know that vaktA shabdha is from Vakthru like pitRu.

Sometimes it gets over looked by me becuse of the
cholesterol coating in my budhhi and becomes specilaised in
nonthinking.

I am relooking at the verse and I did not see trhe roiginal
when I gave the interpretation. 

thanking you once again

om namo narayanaya
lakshmi Muthuswamy
