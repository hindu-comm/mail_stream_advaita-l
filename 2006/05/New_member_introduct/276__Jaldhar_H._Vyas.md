I am a 23 year old Indian student currently doing PhD at University of 
California at San Diego in Bioinformatics. I have been intrigued by 
questions regarding the existence of life, and feel that Advaita has the 
most scientific explanation to these. My knowledge of the scriptures is 
very limited, but I am trying to overcome this by reading about Vedas and 
Upanishads. I hope that by joining this list, I will be able to further 
explore various facets of Advaita and will be able to learn from 
knowledgeable people.

Thanks
Nitin
