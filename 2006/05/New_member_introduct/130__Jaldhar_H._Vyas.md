Dear Moderators of Advaita list,

I am Jagannathan Mahadevan, aged 31, from Dallas, Texas. I am married with 
a daughter who just turned 3. I was originally inroduced to this list by 
Shri Jayanarayanan (Kartik) who I have known for some time. I am basically 
from Chennai in Tamil Nadu and came here to the US for higher education in 
1999. We are Smarthas and I was initiated into upakarma when I was 12. Our 
family has ties to the Kanchi matha and I have been fortunate to take 
blessings and listen to Kanchi Periyaval several times when I was young. 
My interest in Advaita Vedanta was spurred when I attended lectures by 
Pujya Swami Dayananda Saraswati of Arsha Vidya Gurukulam.

Sincerely,
Jagan.
