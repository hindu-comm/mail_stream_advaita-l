  I have been teaching History at the Jesus & Mary College for over 23 
years. My main research has been on Shivaism. I teach the history of 
religions to the MA students of delhi University wher the topics I cover 
are Shivaism, Vishnuism and Tantrism. In the last three years or more I 
have been reading the Upanishads and other putatively authored texts such 
as the Saundaryalahari and Shivanandalahari. My next monograph in fact is 
on the former. I have been going to Oxford frequently and some of the 
scholarsr there have been working in the theology dept, got me addicted to 
this kind of reading.
