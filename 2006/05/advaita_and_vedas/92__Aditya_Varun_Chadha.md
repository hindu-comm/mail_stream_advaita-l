This basically resolves the discrepency between what Sri Jayanarayanan
was saying (the eternal existence of "words"), and what I was saying
(the eternal existence of _concepts_ that our words represent, not the
words themselves). The thing to realize is that every word has a LOT
of baggage associated with it that is implicit. for example "advaita"
is not merely "non-dualism", it is much more. so "advaita" and
"non-dualism" eternally exist as different words AS WELL AS different
concepts. no two sounds ever really "mean" the same thing. so while
what I was saying (that it is the meanings, the concept behind words
that are eternal) is correct, it is also correct that every
non-identical pair of uttered sounds represents a non-identical pair
of concepts, and thus words themselves can be said to exist eternally.

So my current goal is not "jIvanmuktI", but say "realization of
chunkyhood". they are NOT the same as long as both are given the EXACT
same definition, down to every syllable and intonation.
