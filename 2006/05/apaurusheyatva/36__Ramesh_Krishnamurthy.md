Dear Sylvain,

Apaurusheyatva is more of a philosophical concept than a dogmatic
assertion. Here are some excellent posts in the archives from our
resident vidvAn (scholar) Sri Vidyasankar. Please go through them and
they should answer most of your questions.

It is also important to know that the Veda's role in Hinduism is quite
different from that of the Bible or the Koran in their respective
religions.
Very few Hindus read the Veda per se. Instead we have hundreds of
texts notionally based on the Veda that address different issues or
are meant for different audiences. The most well known and widely read
of these is the Bhagavad Gita.

Note also that it is NOT necessary to study an apaurusheya text to
achieve moksha. Apaurusheyatva is a concept related to the Vedic
exegetical tradition and has no bearing on moksha or on the
holiness/saintliness of any other book.
