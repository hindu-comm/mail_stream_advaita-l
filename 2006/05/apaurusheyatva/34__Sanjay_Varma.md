that will depend on the state of the pen-handler, remember that the
ahamkara can be completely vaporized.

They do, (Sri Ramakrishna not only said but lived it too). What one
should follow is a matter of personal belief. not everybody is born a
paramahamsa. most seekers require a firmly set path, at least
initially.

Every written book has a human pen-handler, but with the vedas they
were never penned down for centuries. (actually, Lord Ganesha is
believed to be the first pen-handler for the vedas - definitely not
human!). Your question was probably to do with the original revelation
not the pen-handling. You'll have an answer to that when you have an
answer to your point #2.
