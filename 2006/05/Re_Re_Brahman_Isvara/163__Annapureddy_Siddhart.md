Shree Viswanathan garu,
        Namaskaramu. Thanks for your kind words. I agree with you at some
level that all these vadas do not finally matter much. A person could
probably attain realization without all these vadas. But once we accept that
the Vedas are an infallible source for understanding Brahman, it becomes
imperative that we have a correct understanding of the words of the Vedas
and their meaning. For example, how do we know Dvaita is incomplete? We say
that we know that because we have rightly interpreted and understood the
import of the Vedas. It is at this juncture that all these vadas assume
their significance. Also, apart from all this, the stances of the various
schools are of independent philosophical interest too.

Cheers.

A.Siddhartha.
