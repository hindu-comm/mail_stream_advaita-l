Shree Viswanathan gaaru,
               Namaskaaramu. I agree with you that this world of dualities
that we see around us seems real, until we realize Brahman. In fact, Advaita
Vedanta says that this world is ultimately unreal in the sense that it gets
sublated at some point (and is not eternal). It does not say that this world
is an illusion in the sense that a hare's horn is an illusion.
But your analogy of

  Namaskaramu. I understand what you said. But still I feel that both the
> physical external world as well the inner Bhraman are real, atleat to begin
> with (just as all the charactres& events in the dream appear real untill u
> wakeup). Say in that anology of occean and waves, Only when you go deeper
> and become aware that you are the occean itself (rise the level to that
> level) you realise that you are that behind all without Birth or
> death.Untill than it wud be just too thoritical to keep saying the waves
> are just an illusion.
