I also feel that manana+nididhyaasana is the same as aatma-vicaara.
Also RM has given slightly varying explanations of what he thinks
aatma-vicaara is in different places. Taken in conjunction with the
upadeshasaahasrii's teachings they are quite similar.

I suggest that people stop looking for *exact* matches in teachings.
This is a very Western notion and also a very Christian notion!  The
definition of nididhyaasana by even Sankara and Sureshvara don't match
and are vastly different. What is the point in seeing if it matches
exactly with RM?!! The tradition is not a bunch of parrots each
repeating the previous parrots sayings. There is considerable scope
for "inventiveness" while still being restrained by the traditional
"method".
