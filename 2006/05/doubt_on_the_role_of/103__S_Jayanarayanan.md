Although RM does not place much emphasis on manana, he does consider
intellectual understanding to be an important step. e.g.

Of course, I took it as granted that shravaNa presupposes sAdhana-chatushhTaya.
In other words, I meant:

sAdhana-chatushhTaya --> shravaNa, etc. --> Atma-vichAra --directly--> GYAna

RM is firm on this point:

Atma-vichAra --directly--> GYAna

But Sankara speaks of shravaNa-manana-nididhyAsana as the path to GYAna. That's
the reason I take the path as I mentioned previously, so that there is no other
"direct route" to GYAna except Atma-vichAra. Hence even nididhyAsana eventually
culminates in Atma-vichAra.

One may suppose that nididhyAsana is nothing but Atma-vichAra. But AFAIK,
nididhyAsana is continuous meditation on the mahAvAkya. RM has never at any
time said that Atma-vichAra requires a vAkya. This is the reason why I
personally feel that nididhyAsana is different from Atma-vichAra, and that the
former must eventually culminate in the latter.

The way I understand it: when one is a beginner studying a certain subject, one
first learns the ideal, and then the deviations from the ideal. e.g. When one
is studying geography, one first learns that the earth is a sphere, and only
later that the earth is a geoid.

Similarly, the "ideal" path is one where sAdhana chatushhTaya and
shravaNa-manana-nididhyAsana are all done preliminary to the "final
Atma-vichAra that directly results in GYAna". But in non-ideal situations, one
can even attain Brahma GYAna without sAdhana chAtushhTaya (examples in the
jIvanmuktiviveka).

IMHO, Atma-vichAra is not nididhyAsana, for the latter requires a mahAvAkya
while the former does not.
