I don't know if this grammar question ever got addressed in this thread, so 
here goes.

lokaM + amuM = that world (dvitIyA vibhakti, accusative case). The root is 
adas = that, which has a very irregular declension. In the masculine, it 
gets transformed to asau (e.g. asau vai tapann apAm Ayatanam) in the 
nominative case up to amushmin (amushminl loke) in the locative case. Please 
refer a good Skt grammar companion for full details.

Regards,
Vidyasankar
