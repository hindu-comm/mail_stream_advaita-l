fine. agreed.

RM says at one place that meditation on the mahAvAkyAs
produces purity of the mind. nevertheless, the
conditions that are required for the success of RM's
Atma vichAra are well contained in the sAdhana
chatuShTaya requirements. it is not *necessary* to
undergo nididhyAsanam to start Atma vichAram though
that may be helpful.

to summarize my understanding,

bhagavatpAda: 

A. for uttamAdhikArIs:
sAdhana chatuShTaya sampatti --> shravaNa -->
akhaNDAkAra vRtti.

B. for others:
sAdhana chatuShTaya sampatti --> shravaNa, manana,
nididhyAsana --> akhaNDAkAra vRtti.

ramaNa maharShi:
sAdhana chatuShTaya sampatti --> Atma vichAra --> ahaM
sphuraNa (= akhaNDAkAra vRtti).

nididhyAsana doesn't culminate in Atma vichAram. both
nididhyAsanam and RM's Atma vichAram have only one
goal, namely the attainment of akhaNDAkAra vRtti or
equivalently aparoksha Atma j~nAnam.

true. RM's Atma vichAram and traditional nididhyAsana
are NOT identical. they are similar in the sense that
both have akaNDAkARavRtti as their goal. again, RM's
Atma vichAram is similar to traditional manana in the
sense that the true meaning of the 'i' is sought in
both cases. but as i said earlier, the similarity ends
there. 

vAsudevaH sarvaM,
