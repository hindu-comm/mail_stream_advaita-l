actually, i thought (and still think) that it would be
very difficult to meet svAmi dayAnanda sarasvatI in
private since he would be very busy training his
disciples and also since i don't know anyone in his
Ashram. however, if i get such an opportunity, i'll
definitely raise these questions and let u know what
happened. thanks for the suggestion.

vAsudevaH sarvaM,
aparyAptAmRtaH.
