while the above route is certainly RM's, it is not the
only possibility. one other route is SCS --> S,M,AV
--> GY. but IMO, SCS --> S,M,N --> AV --> GY is not
correct. 
(SCS: sAdhana chatuShTaya sampatti, S: shravaNa (*),
M: manana (*), N: nididhyAsana, AV: RM's Atma vichAra,
GY: aparokSha Atma j~nAna.)

(*) RM's idea of shravaNa and manana is not
necessarily the same as bhagavatpAda's though it is
inclusive of the latter.

vAsudevaH sarvaM,
aparyAptAmRtaH.
