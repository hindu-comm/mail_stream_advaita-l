Amuthan:

If you happen to meet Swami Dayananda at Rishikesh during your visit, 
please do raise your doubt. His explanations are often very insightful. 
More so in this case, since he credits his reorientation to vedanta to 
yogi ramayya and his commentary on upadesha sAram is a masterpiece. We 
all will be benefitted.
