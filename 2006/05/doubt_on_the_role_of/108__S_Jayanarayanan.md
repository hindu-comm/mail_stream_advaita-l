There are two teachings:

1) Sankara - "shravaNa-manana-nididhyAsana is the way to GYAna."

2) RM - "Atma-vichAra is the *only* way to GYAna."

Therefore your claim that both shravaNa-manana-nididhyAsana and Atma-vichAra
are *two* ways to GYAna will not be accepted by RM, because he teaches that
there is no way other than Atma-vichAra leading to GYAna.

That's the reason I feel it may be that:

shravaNa-manana-nididhyAsana = Atma-vichAra (Swami Dayananda Saraswati)

or

shravaNa-manana-nididhyAsana culminates in Atma-vichAra.
