Namaskaram Mami,

  Defeanetly uttra khanda was added by some weird thinking persons and not part of original Ramayan.This incidence as well sending seetha back to Aaranya are just wild  imagination which only belittle the the character of Purushotama- Rama
   We are already in neck deep soup becaz of these bullshits (sorry for using such words , but couldnt help)

  Namaskaram,

Please read the chapters 73 - 76 of Uttara khAndA of
Valmiki Ramayana.
ch 73. A brahmana arrives at the palace gates of Rama. he
is carrying the dead body of his son and laments and blames
the king for the death of his son.

ch 74. Devarishi narada explains the cause for this
apamrithyu of the Brahmanas son. The cause being the
unauthoriused practice of penance with no adhikara by a
sudra.

ch 75. Sri Rama goes around his empire in the aerial car of
kubera, ir order to trace this unrighteous sudra. Rama
finds him practising penance in the southern direction.

Ch 76. Killing of the sudra by Sri rama and coming back to
life of the Brahmanas son.
