A big problem with most sanskrit books is they don't have indexes.  Which 
makes searching through a book the size of the Ramayana next to 
impossible.  Can you tell me roughly where (at least which kanda) this 
episode is supposed to occur?

No that's true. However it is the only reason where the idea of adhikara 
is relevent don't you think?

Shankaracharya does not claim to have established his own philosophy.

Only for one kind of debate.  I don' see why he couldn't discuss any of 
the core concepts of Vedanta solely on the Smrti.

Although in theory smrti is based on shruti, in practice it is the other 
way around.  We approach Shruti through the prism of Smrti and even more 
importantly shishtachara.  For example my daily religious activities are 
based on what I learned from elders and gurus and from prayogas which are 
like "recipes" based on dharmashastras which are themselves a condensed 
edition of smrtis and kalpasutras which are based on the Vedas.

So too a traditional Advaitin would probably spend more time with 
siddhantaleshasamgrah or panchadashi or brahmasutra commentaries than the 
"raw" upanishads themselves.

It's a authentic source.  But so is the Gita and in fact the brahmasutras 
quote it many times and also other parts of the mahabharata and manusmrti.

No I think not.  But it is a pretty contrived hypothetical.  For the 
reasons I mentioned above, someone who "belives in the infallibility of 
the Vedas" believes in a whole chain of interpretation and redaction of 
the Vedas.
