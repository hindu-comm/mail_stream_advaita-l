You can argue that in the other direction.  In many cases what you
perceive is conditioned by your own experiences, culture etc.  People in
the USA would be horrified to eat dog meat but would not blink at eating
beef which we would find disgusting.  In both cases, the taste of the meat
does not explain the (often physical) reaction.  How do you seperate the
pratyaksha caused by shabda from the shabda caused by pratyaksha?

When they form complex systems, it becomes pointless to talk about the
simple mechanisms.  Knowing about the simple mechanisms has no predictive
power.  I think this is a big problem with reductionism as applied to
ethics instead of nice co-operative atoms.

In the 1970s-80s New York was a very dangerous place with high rates of
crime of all types.  When Rudolph Guliani became mayor, he tried a novel
approach.  He directed the police to crack down on minor crimes like
begging, graffitti, vandalism etc. stuff which they normally wouldn't pay
much attention to.  Taken in isolation, these types of crime were minor.
But suppressing them brought the rates of _all_ types of crime down
because it is theorized people felt safer or more proud or some other
counter-intuitive thing.

Another of my interests is Linux and Open Source software which is also a
case where simple actions (individual programmers) can lead to complex and
impressive results.  (Software better than Microsoft's.)  but it has
produced its share of failures too.  A big reason why many companies
aren't using Open Source software yet is because it can be too much of a
gamble to know if you are going to end up with a diamond or a dud.

The problem is when you try and quantify the pratyaksha reasons.  What
percentage is due to "I wouldn't like it," what percentage is due to "I
could get in trouble" etc.?  If you don't know that you cannot isolate the
variable for your experiment.

In that case we have plenty of evidence from history.  (and as I
mentioned before I think the evidence is against egalitarianism.)  But how
can historical evidence be used as the basis of an experiment?  We are
trying to predict the future are we not?

One doesn't even have to be a philosopher to know the mind can play tricks
on you, desire can overpower reason or reason can simply fail to be
applied.  It is better to place faith in somebody elses senses if
objectivity is the goal.

You mean the Vedas?  The same ones you are trying to falsify?  Tautology.

You cannot realistically isolate the variable, set up a control or even
objectively define the result.

Btw, When we talk about studying it is not just idly leafing through the
pages, but a deliberate program of actions starting with upanayana,living
in the house of the Guru, placing samidha on his fire, learning suktas for
upto 12 years, and concluding with samavartana.  It is done for spiritual
reasons and though there may be material or intellectual benefits, they
are secondary.  It is a cultural performance of great significance to the
performer and society.  After all people don't just suddenly start picking
up 3,000 year old volumes because they finished the newspaper early.

I am assuming that this theoretical woman wants to study the Vedas because
she thinks there will be some spiritual benefit to it.  On the basis of
that assumption, I am saying that there will be no benefit.
