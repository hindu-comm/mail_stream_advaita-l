  So you were born in England and now you stay in the USA. I wonder how you achieved this without crossing oceans. And by the way, it looks like you have visited India zero number of times.

  Needless to say, you are misunderstanding. Atleast this gentleman was trying to suggest that this could be a case of a pot calling the kettle black. But that's not the point either. The point is whether or not one should take the opinions of such people seriously.

  How many surveys have you conducted on women who are learning vedas? How many cases did you study in each survey? How do you know that these surveys represent the entire spectrum of women who study vedas? How did you measure their spirituality? Or is this just an out-of-thin-air baseless claim that you are making?
