Namaste,

Sorry for the delayed response to this post. Have been travelling over
the last 3 days.

If you are referring to Vidyasankar's post on 7th April, I have read
that agree with it wholeheartedly. Vidyasankar's post on 18th April on
the Satyakama Jabala issue is also instructive.

Best wishes to all members on the occasion of Sankara Jayanti

dhanyosmi
Ramesh
