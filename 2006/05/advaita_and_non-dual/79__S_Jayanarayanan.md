Sankara rarely says, "This is true because I say so."

Instead, he says, "This is true because experience/logic/scripture
says so."

It is only in two realms that mImAmsA-VedAnta accepts scriptural
authority as supreme:

1) dharma in mImAmsA
2) Atma-vidyA in VedAnta

Hats off to your honesty.

Ramana Maharshi, who is accepted by most "traditionalists" as a
GYAnI, has sometimes given suggestions on dharma that is not always
in line with tradition. e.g. He permitted women to take up sannyAsa,
which was never part of the tradition at least at that time, perhaps
even nowadays in orthodox circles. But even RM was of the opinion
that *VedAnta* reigns supreme when it comes to removing ignorance of
the Self.
