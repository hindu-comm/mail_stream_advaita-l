  It is not at all easy to renounce the externals of home, family and money if one has also not mentally renounced everything. On the other hand, it is easy for the mind to fool itself into believing whatever it pleases. Call us stick-in-the-mud or whatever else, 
but there are strong reasons why so many of us on this list value our tradition highly.

  Aum.

  Traditionally yatidooshaNa is considered extremely bad. Having coming across an alleged ubhayabhrashTha (one fallen from both grihasta and sannyAsa Ashramas), and reminded about yatidooshaNa, I asked why it is considered very bad. The answer was very illuminating: "because at least for a moment, they did renounce everything, which is more that what you have done. With practice, maybe they will permanently renounce."
