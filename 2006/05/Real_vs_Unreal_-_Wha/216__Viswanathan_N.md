Hi My dear friend


  Maya is not the energy nor any material substance.
  maya is nothing but "The illusion"  which makes you feel the  unreal as Real......  thats it

  Hello all

Thank you for your explanations about what is real/unreal.

I would like to ask you: what maya is in itself? Is it an energy? Is there
any "material" substract in it that may be impressed by our action of
focusing in any direction? What is it made of?

I hope my english was enough to make my question clear. Thank you a lot
