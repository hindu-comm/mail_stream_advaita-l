I agree with your views about the scalling the conciousness. Certainly Mahabharatha might be a real event spread across so many characters/period/geogarphical area.
  I strongly belive Krishna was the peak of conciousness of all persons, ever lived. He was 100%complete personality (either as child, lover, politican,warrior,friend,guru )in every aspect of life and uncomparable to anyone else. Thats why I was trying to see him at 10000 level while seeing Budhha/ Jesus at 1000. For normal people like us raching level of Buddha/ Jesus itself is dream, leave alone krishna's level. May be, thats why he is called "Purushotma"

This is probably nothing more than trivia, and I apologize if this message
does not belong to this list. David Hawkins has come up with a consciousness
scale ranging from 1 to 1000, in the log scale with base 10. So a
consciousness level of 2 is 10 times higher than a consciousness level of 1,
for example. A consciousness level of 1000 represents the highest possible
level of consciousness. By using applied kinesiology, he has found that the
average human consciousness level is 200. And obviously, he also found that
Krishna, Buddha and Jesus had a consciousness level of 1000. The implication
is that there certainly existed such people, for them to have registered a
consciousness level. Which also means that the Mahabharata also was a real
event (or atleast based on a real event). I do not know how much scientific
validity applied kinesiology has, so take this with a pinch of salt, if you
must.
