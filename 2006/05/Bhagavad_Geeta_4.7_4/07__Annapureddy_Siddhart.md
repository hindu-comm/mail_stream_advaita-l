Sadanandaji,
    Pranamamulu. Thanks for your extensive comments. You made these two
statements:
"I bring in Iswara, who is different from me as the creator of this
universe, which is
different from me." and
"Yes, Iswara can save us by his infinite compassion, if we let Him."

These appear to me to be contradictory. When the very notion of Isvara is a
figment of our imagination, how can Isvara save us. Any help can only come
from us, from the purification of our mind -- is it not? I am comfortable
with this position, but is this the position of traditional Advaita Vedanta
too?

Also, certain verses of the Bhagavad Geeta, like 4.7 and 4.8, seem untenable
if we
consider Isvara as only an imaginary entity. I am comfortable with this
position too, but
I wonder how traditional Advaita Vedanta would have defended itself against
criticism from other schools (as to which is a faithful interpretation of
the Bhagavad Geeta).

Please let me know if I missed something. Thanks.

A.Siddhartha.
