Sadanandaji

Pranams.

Based on your explanation, this is what I have understood. Please correct me
if I am wrong.

From the Brahman point of view, there is no mAya, which is the same as
saying that a jiivanmukta does not see any duality. mAya only exists from
the jiiva point of view. Even the jiiva point of view (as separate from the
Brahman point of view) is because of mAya. In fact, everything that we
perceive as real is because of mAya. Then the question arises: where does
mAya come from? The only explanation I can think of is that even the
presence of mAya is because of mAya, which is something of a loop back on
itself. But I am unable to comprehend the meaning of this, how does mAya
arise out of itself? And what is the relation of mAya, jiiva, jiiva point of
view, etc. with Brahman, if from Brahman point of view, all these do not
exist? So, in short, where does the entire concept of mAya come from?

Thanks
Sailesh
