Shree Kartikji,
                Namaste. Thanks for pointing the source (and the
context) for Samkara's statement. Regarding the Appaya Dikshita
episode, my friend too only heard it being said. When I searched the
web, I found only a single link attesting to that statement, and that
too from a Vaishnava, so I wanted to verify its authenticity. Thanks.

A.Siddhartha.
