In shooting off my post on 'nArAyaNa', I committed the mistake of referring to the dental 'na' repeatedly as palatal 'na'. What excuse, except lack of well established knowledge and rigour in application, could be offered for such a basic mistake? The learned members are requested to kindly bear with such clumsiness.

  Apologies
  Senani

Namaskaramu. Thanks a bunch for the explanation on the word
"Narayana" and the valuable information on Sanskrit. That was really
nice. Please see my comments below.

As you rightly pointed out, even the so-called proper nouns have
derivations in Sanskrit. The difference between a "proper name" (Mea
culpa. Bad usage) and a "title" that I intended is this -- Siva
meaning auspiciousness, it could be used either for MahaDeva or
Narayana. And there is no restriction on such usage. But the word
Narayana on the other hand, although it has meanings that could be
derived, is supposed (according to my friend) to refer to only one
particular being.

One more derivation from a Dvaita perspective was this. Na ara --
without any doshas, i.e., Laxmi Devi. Ayana meaning shelter. Narayana
is he who is the refuge of Laxmi Mata, one without any doshas.

You hit right on target. This was what I meant. Thanks.

A.Siddhartha.
