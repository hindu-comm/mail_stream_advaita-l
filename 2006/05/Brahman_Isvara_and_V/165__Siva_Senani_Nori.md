  The distinction is made because of the limitations of language and in order to communicate the concept of Reality. Why only here - in every statement involving brahman or aatman a similar second is talked about. Just because a mention is made of a second, it should not be assumed that such a second - be it mind or external world - is Real.

  Yes, that would be easier to comprehend, and it is indeed recommended as an intermediate position before Real is realised. In fact the concept of antaryaamin is remarked upon by Sri Sankara in the commentary on BrihadaaraNyakopanishad. Such an all-permeating internal-ruler is the lower, saguna brahman or Isvara.

  The traditional view is that Advaita is what is expounded in the vedas including the upanishads.

  Self is indeed something distinct from the world we are in; the Self is the Real whereas 'the world we are in' is unreal.

  Yes, creation of this 'world' is associated with Isvara. It is not so much to explain regularity as to explain its being. Whence has this illusion come? From Isavara, due to maaya.

  > Hence the question, what is the definition of Isvara?

  Isvara is Brahman associated with maaya. Or the saguNa-brahman is Isvara. This Isvara creates the world and descends (avatarati) into it, paritraaNaaya sadhUnaam... and all that. 

  But, of course, none of this is Real Ultimately. It is all an illusion, and that illusion has elaborate rules, and detailed codes, and so on. Actually even as I write, my head is spining, but I believe that is what the theory is.
