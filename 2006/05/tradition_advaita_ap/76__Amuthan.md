namo nArAyaNAya!

dear shrI manIsh,

it is not my intention to hurt you or not to talk to
you etc. i just said that there was no point
continuing to argue *in that thread*. please take it
in the right spirits.

thanks for your advice regarding yoga vAsiShTha and
aShTavakra gItA. i have read parts of these, but not
fully.

and regarding the definitions of Atman and brahman, i
guess you have misunderstood the main thrust of my
argument. to clarify my point, please note that only
advaita vedAnta asserts unity of Atman and brahman.
other darshanAs don't. so, before talking about the
unity or difference of Atman and brahman, it is
necessary to clearly define what one means by Atman
and brahman. these definitions are obviously not the
same (if they are the same, where is the question of
their unity or difference?). the essence of our
existence is Atman and the ultimate source of the
universe is brahman. *within* advaita vedAnta, since
both Atman and brahman are the same, these definitions
may be used interchangeably. *please* look into the
context in which the definitions were given earlier.

to put it in other words, i'm not saying that Atman is
not brahman. Atman IS brahman according to advaita
vedAnta and i accept that. the issue here is NOT
whether Atman is brahman, but what one means by Atman
and what one means by brahman.

i'm sorry for the delay in the posts on bhagavad gItA.
i'll start posting from next week.

vAsudevaH sarvaM,
aparyAptAmRtaH.
