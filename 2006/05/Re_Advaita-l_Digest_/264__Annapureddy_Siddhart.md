Shree Siva Senaniji, Jaldharji, Viswanathanji, Kashyapaji, Shreemati
Lakshmiji,
             Thanks for your opinions on the episode of Sri Rama and
Shambuka.
Please see my comments/questions below.

If we agree that Shambuka was killed for violating the rule about Sudras not
being
eligible to do penance (and not for trying to ascend into heaven in his
mortal coil, or
for trying to usurp the position of Indra), then I see a problem. There is
also a rule that
Kshatriyas should not take up the duties of a Brahmana. But we have the
example of
Brahmarishi Viswamitra who violates that rule. Similarly, in the case of
Shri Parasurama,
who violates the rules governing Brahmanas. How do we reconcile these two
episodes?

This is interesting. I felt the traditional view was that Ramayana and
MahaBharata
were authored in their entirety by Valmiki and Vyasa, as opposed to the
Indologists'
view that there would have been several interpolations (for example, that
Bhagavad
Geeta is probably a later addition). And also, that people have been as
careful in
preserving the contents of the Itihasas, as they have been in the case of
the Vedas.

The sin, at least in its effect, was definitely not minor. A Brahmana's son
died because of
the Adharma (or so, the story goes).

This seems also to be the Dvaitin view. That Shambuka had the soul of an
asura.
Btw, could you point the source for this translation (I mean what is the
authoritative
source for this Pushtimargis' story). Seems like this is not in the
Sanskrit version you were mentioning. And also, I too do not remember this
incident
from when I read this episode a while ago.

Thanks.

A.Siddhartha.
