Senaniji,
my understanding is that this apparent projection of brahman as the
universe, which we may call "creation" is not an event that took place
at a certain place at a certain time. It has always happened,
continues to happen and will continue to happen forever, everywhere in
the universe. this is the reason why we see signs of intelligent
design (the supreme intelligence of ishvara) in all we can observe in
this material world (anytime/anywhere).
