I don't think scientists are sure either. none considers molecules to
be alive. I remember reading somewhere that viruses are considered to
be on the borderline between the living & non-living. but I'd say that
that spark always existed. the transition from what we consider
non-living to what we  consider to be living is gradual and just a
part of the evolution process.

> Whatever be it, it occured accidentally.

about as accidentally as the rest of the evolution process, before and
after the transition, which I believe - same as you do - not
accidental at all.
