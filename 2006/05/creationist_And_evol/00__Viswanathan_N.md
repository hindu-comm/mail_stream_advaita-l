your actions are initiated, controlled and bound by praktihic dharma. Its part and parcel of it, than what do you mean by your actions creating prakrithi.
  the whole scene ,ie, cause, action and effect are all part of prakrithi. 

  you have a choice,  to think you are doing and hence you are enjoying. Than you are the doer and you are the enjoyer. Thus startes the cycle of samsara,ie, cause lead to effect lead to cause to effect to cause.......on and on and on. As the result "Ego' is created and getting strenthened at each step of this cycle. So desires/pleasures/pains/frsutrations and this goes on and on... to settle this account birthh , death and birth this cycle also goes along . (this is the case with 99.99% of the people). So, here you are the creator

  The alternate is just move a bit aside and start watching the ehole scene as  observer.. than you realise neither you are doer or enjoyer, all happens on its own according to praktithic dharma..
  here no action, no cause or effect,no pleasure or pain, no birth or death... end of all polarities...end of whole dualism... you remain 'ONE"  that is advaitha. 

  According to Advaitha the whole prakrithic existance/ activities  are termed as Maya ( generally meant as illusion/ unreal...but prefer to  take it as impermenant/ unstable/ ever changing). IN this case there is no creator as nothing called creation exist.

Do you mean our actions cannot create prakriti ?
