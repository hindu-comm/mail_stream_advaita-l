I think to understand about the exisitence  as whether it is by creation/ evolution, it is better to understand about creator first (I am not presupposing the creation theory- rather about 'YOU'). So try to find answers for these  first:
  Who is "He" or what is "That"? where he/it is? How he/it is? Why he/it is?When it happened?.......

  Just keep books/ scriptures aside , for a while... go deep into your self and search... you will get all the answers as well the the answer- whether its creation or evoution.

I don't think scientists are sure either. none considers molecules to
be alive. I remember reading somewhere that viruses are considered to
be on the borderline between the living & non-living. but I'd say that
that spark always existed. the transition from what we consider
non-living to what we consider to be living is gradual and just a
part of the evolution process.

about as accidentally as the rest of the evolution process, before and
after the transition, which I believe - same as you do - not
accidental at all.
