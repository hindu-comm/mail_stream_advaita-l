Thank you very much for the thoughts.

This is similar to my thoughts as well. I too feel that the path to
understanding the self and sAkShAtkAram is very cleary laid out in the
tradition (sankara parampara). However, sometimes I do get a doubt
whether the svaDharmAnuShTaNa is really taking place. This is probably
due to my incomplete understanding of what constitutes svaDharma.

I will definitely visit the website address you had given me. I am
aware of Swami Dayanandji of the AVG.

Jagan.
