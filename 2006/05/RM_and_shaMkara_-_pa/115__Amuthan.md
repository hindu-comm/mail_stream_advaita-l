the case of j~nAnIs like RM is different. they don't
endure pain in the same way as a mumukShu. a mumukShu
associates his 'i' with the body by default. hence, he
considers certain modifications of the body as being
painful and certain others as being pleasurable. but a
j~nAni's 'i' naturally identifies with the self. he
doesn't actually cognize a body. it is we who cognize
his body. when we see a particular change in a
j~nAnI's body that would be considered as painful if
it happened in our own body, we think he suffers. but
the truth is that there is no 'he' who suffers.

there is no doubt that a mumukShu needs the will power
to endure the various modifications of the mind and
the body. that is why titikShA is included within the
sAdhana chatuShTaya requirements.

a correction: parokSha means indirect and aparokSha
means direct. hence, direct knowledge is called
aparokSha j~nAna.

aparokSha j~nAna is the same as sAkShAtkAra. during
sAkShAtkAra, the mind assumes the form of the self and
the false identification with the body subsides.
sAkShAtkAra is also known as akhaNDAkAra vRtti, ahaM
sphuraNa etc.
