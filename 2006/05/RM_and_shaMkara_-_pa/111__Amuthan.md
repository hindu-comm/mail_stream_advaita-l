i guess i need to refine the latter statement. RM is
certainly of the opinion that traditional shruti based
manana and parisa~NkhyAna are useful aids for a
mumukShu (i.e. one who has not realized the self)
since they  produce strength and one-pointedness of
the mind. Hence, it can be seen that (M (,N) --> AV) =
M*. (M,N stand for traditional manana and nididhyAsana
and M* stands for RM's view of manana.) seen this way,
your view D fits within RM's view. 

vAsudevaH sarvaM,
aparyAptAmRtaH.
