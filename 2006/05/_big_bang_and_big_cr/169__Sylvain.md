Namaste

According to my the very limited intellectual spiritual information, the 
cosmologic theory of « big bang / big crunch » representing an eternal prAna 
of material existence is very similar with pralaya (big crunch), kalpa, 
yuga, manvantara, etc.

Is this cosmology treated in advaita vedanta ?
