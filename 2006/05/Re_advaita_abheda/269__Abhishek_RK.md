Namaste,

Actually, advaita vedanta stresses the unity of atma, brahman and
jagat. I wonder why only atma and brahman are considered in deriving
the word "advaita".  The word "vedanta" is used in most/ all of the
Shankara Bhashyas. "sarva vedAnteShu ca Ishvara hetukA  eva shriShTayo
vyapidishyante" (BS, 3.2.41), for example. But is the philosophy of
Adi Shankara Bhagavatpada referred to anywhere as "advaita" in the
advaitic or vaishnava traditional works? If not, how did this name
come about?

I understand Shandilya Muni in "Shandilya Bhakti Sutras" says that
Badarayana is an "advaitin".

Regards,
Abhishek
