  Non-brahmins - kshatrIyas and vaisyas - are permitted, rather expected, to learn and recite vedas - they are only prohibited from teaching them. Dvjija is a twice-born, first the actual birth, and second, the initiation (upanayana). The upanayana-samskAra is prescribed for both kshatrIyas and vaisyas and by that definition they are also dvijas. They are duty-bound to wear the yaj~nopavIta and worship sandhya thrice a day. That many generally do not do is no different from the fact that many brahmins also do not do as vihita, prescribed. It is also true that many non-brahmin dvijas stopped wearing the sacred thread, as have many brahmins, the Sikha. The absence of outward symbols is unfortunate, but the absence of learning is of greater concern.

  Regards
  Senani
