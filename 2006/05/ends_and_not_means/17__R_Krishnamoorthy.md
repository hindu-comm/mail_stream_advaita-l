Dear members
In my view we are all only speculating as to why there is no specific 
sanction for women to recite/study The Vedas.Either we accept the sayings of 
the Vedas intoto or leave them for selective adoptation.Human beings are 
born to grow atleast in mental stature compared to other speciesfrom uni 
cellular organism to giant elephants.Perhaps the size of the brain has 
accomplished this.All  other living organisms are as they were centuries ago 
but humans have evolved to attain the present mental capabilities.This is 
because  of his discriminative power and memory and interpration of 
forefathers dictums evolved  and passed on to posterity.As Times change the 
useless ones are discarded new ones having been picked up.As the ancient 
Tamil Grammer Thol Kappiyam says there is nothing wrong in discarding old 
and picking up new ones as time passes.-Pazhayana kazhithalum pudhiana 
puhuthalum Vazhuvala kala varainayinane-.So applying this we need not
 discourage any one who has real interest to study vedas as there appears to 
be a genuine interest to know about what the shruthi says about "Beyond" 
matters especially in the context of changed times.R.Krishnamoorthy.
