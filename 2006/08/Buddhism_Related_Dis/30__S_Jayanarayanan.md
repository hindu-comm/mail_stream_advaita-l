No one violated the list policy. The policy does not imply that all
posts SHOULD be sent to the moderators for approval.

If moderation begins every time the word "Buddhism" is mentioned,
discussions will not happen. Moderation ought not to cripple one's
understanding.

It is impossible to understand portions of advaita, especially
Gaudapada's Karikas, without a clear understanding of Buddhism, and
this discussion was started by Vidya for that reason. I don't see any
reason whatsoever the questions why the posts on the questions on
Buddhism should not be permitted.

If you please, I would be interested in how you can explain the
Alatashanti Prakarana without at least a rudimentary discussion on
Buddhism.

How can one become a "scholar" of both the traditions without asking
questions and getting answers?

I don't know of a single person living in this planet who can claim
to be a scholar of both these traditions.

I personally feel we should have discussions on Buddhism that help us
understand advaita. In the *rare circumstance* that a person in this
list wants to propagate Buddhism or being Buddhism-related
discussions for its own sake, Vidyasankar Sundaresan should exercise
his discretion as moderator.
