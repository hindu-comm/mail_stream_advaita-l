Please, allow me this post since it may link buddhism to advaita vedAnta.

Udana Vagga, VIII.3 seems to be clear on non-duality of nirvAna 
consciousness, if ever one of you would be interested in reading this in 
pali or sanskrit.  Here are two English translations of this short saying.

By the way, is pali easily understandable for a sanskrit reader ?


(Udana Vagga, VIII.3, translated from the Pali by John D. Ireland)
There is, bhikkhus, a not-born, a not-brought-to-being, a not-made, a 
not-conditioned. If, bhikkhus, there were no not-born, not-brought-to-being, 
not-made, not-conditioned, no escape would be discerned from what is born, 
brought-to-being, made, conditioned. But since there is a not-born, a 
not-brought-to-being, a not-made, a not-conditioned, therefore an escape is 
discerned from what is born, brought-to-being, made, conditioned.


(Udana Vagga, VIII.3, translated from the Pali by Thanissaro Bhikkhu)
There is, monks, an unborn - unbecome - unmade - unfabricated. If there were 
not that unborn - unbecome - unmade - unfabricated, there would not be the 
case that emancipation from the born - become - made - fabricated would be 
discerned. But precisely because there is an unborn - unbecome - unmade - 
unfabricated, emancipation from the born - become - made - fabricated is 
discerned.
