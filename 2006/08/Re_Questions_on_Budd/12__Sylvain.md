(Lakshminarayana) Being a buddhist, nAgArjuna cannot accept an eternal Atman 
or brahman.

                         *

Is it possible "anatta" or "anAtman" only means that the "individual soul" 
(liNga-sharIra) is not permanent ?
Siddharta Gautama said there is "unborn" (ajAta?), which seems equivalent of 
"eternal Atman".
