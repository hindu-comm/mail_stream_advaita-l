But is it necessary to study sanskrit for realizing
brahman? It is highly counter intuitive to suggest so.
Translations into English may not be as good, but what
about translations into other local Indian languages? 

I am also curious to know how, for example, sanskrit
is absolutely essential for understanding brahman. Thanks.
