As the saying goes: "Good enough" is the enemy of the Best.
Translations are "good enough", but that's precisely the problem!

For example, it may be all right to do only the arghya pradAnam.h and
gAyatrI japam.h as part of one's daily saMdhyA. But if you ask a
Guru, he will ask you to do it in its entirety.

I said it is "imperative", meaning it is an *exhortation* by our
Sampradaya and Jagadguru, to study the Sanskrit language (including
grammar) "if and when possible" (in case one does not have capable
teachers or good books, etc. there may be excuses) -- so that one can
comprehend the scriptural teachings in the original language.
