namo nArAyana

Dear Lakshminarayanaji,
> As bhaskarji says, neti neti is the best description> of brahman, which has also been called satyam, jnAnam,> anantam.I find the above statement amusing on the grounds that brahman is 'neti neti' and then described as satyam, jnAnam and anantam (SJA). 

Even on the highest level of pAramArthika satya you cannot still label SJA to brahman or could you?

Kind regards,Krunal
