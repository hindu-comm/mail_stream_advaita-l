In what sense in Atman/brahman an *eternal* entity? I suppose by
"eternal" is meant that which is beyond space, time & causation. But
in what sense is Atman/brahman an *entity*?

The concept of the substratum is something I have never quite
understood. That shUnyatA is not a metaphysical/transcendental entity
is fine. But what is brahman?
