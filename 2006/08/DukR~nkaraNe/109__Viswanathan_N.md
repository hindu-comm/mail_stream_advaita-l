Sadanandaji

  Very well said. In fact ultimately only by dropping everything including
  the very mind itself, you reach home,ie, you see your true 'Self'. Otherwise , we tend to cling to the boat for helping in crossing the river or ladder for helping us in climbing.
  Thats what all the realized ones say either a layman turned jnanai like Shri Nisargadutta mahraj or a scientist turned janani like swami Virajeshwara.

  Thats why I kept saying 'End'  not 'Means'....'Content' not the 'container' or as I was tought in my professional life 'Content over Form'

  Pranams

Lakshmiji - PraNAms.
You have raised an important issue. From my understanding, What is required is only full shraddhaa
(faith) in the scriptuall statement 'tat tvam asi' - The biographies of Shree Nisargadatta Maharaj
(authr of 'I am that') and Anandamayima (the fisher woman from Kerala)are revealing.
Everything else is only to establish that shraddaa. 
To quote characteristic response of Bhagavan Ramana Maharshi in all these types of questions, "it
is not necessary but it is helpful"; if I can add an additional phrase to it, 'but for those who
think it is needed, it is necessary'. 

Hari OM!
Sadananda
