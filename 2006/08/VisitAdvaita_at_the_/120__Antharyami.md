Hari Om,

It is quite polemical but radical suffice to delineate the jIva tatva as in
accordance with that of the visistAdvaita, except for the latter attributing
jIva utpatthi (multifarious distinctions among jIvA's issued by pAncarAtra
Agama ) which Adi Sankara selectively rejects. At the vyAvahArika level the
nAma rUpAdi lakshanA'a interminably persists, justifying the existence of
jIvAtma at the vyAvahArika level, thus accommodates well with the organs of
liberation vide, AnukUlya samkalpa ; prAdikUlya varjana; kArpanyam and so
on. The primary knowledge to be sought by the jIva is that : mAya is none
other than Brahman and Avidya is mithya. The distinction of mAya and avidya
is held by SurEswarAcArya using durukta nodes in his vArtika. Identification
of mAya prior to realization of 'ayamAtma Brahman' is mandatory. As far as
the attempt to substantiate Brahman, Advaita clearly mentions that Brahman
is satasat vailakshanya (T.Up.) indicating Brahman, imperceptible : existing
beyond options and sides. True Advaitins, , must never indulge in
contemplating the Brahma Tatva through verbiage. Pot and its existence along
with its distinctions 'are' real on the plane of mAya at vyAvahArika level.
It's simply the presence that ought to be perceived not the existence
through manifestation.
