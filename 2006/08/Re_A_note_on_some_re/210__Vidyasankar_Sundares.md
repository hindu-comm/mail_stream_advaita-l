I notice I sent out the following with an incomplete sentence.

The last sentence should be,

In appayya dIkshita's case, many things are explained if one takes into account the historical background of fierce rivalry among various
camps led by vijayIndra tIrtha (dvaita), tAtAcArya (viSishTAdvaita) and appayya dIkshita. It was an atmosphere where all three leaders
had varying degrees of influence with the local king and there was a lot of courtly intrigue.
