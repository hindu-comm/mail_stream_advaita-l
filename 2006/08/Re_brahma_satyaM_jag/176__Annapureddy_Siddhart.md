praNAM Anbuji,
       Please see my comments below:

> In my understanding Iswara is Saguna Brahman and not Nirguna Brahman.


This is exactly what I said. The nirguNa spirit becomes the saguNa in
combination with mAyA.

It is
> not right to say that Maya is dependent on Nirguna Brahman for that would

mAyA is anirvachanIya only in the sense that it is not real (existing at all
three times, being conscious, being all-pervasive etc.), nor is it unreal
(in the sense of a dream world).

Another angle to look at it is that vEda asserts that nirguNa brahma is the
only reality, but we still see the mAyA in our empirical lives. It's not
unreal like the dream world. Hence, mAyA is anirvachanIya.

I do not see how mAyA being dependent on nirguNa brahma would contradict
mAyA being anirvachanIya.

Also it would contradict
> Nirguna Brahman as being Absolute.


Absolute in the sense of being the ONLY reality. For example, if we take
nirguNa brahma out of mAyA, nothing remains.

A Videha Mukta merges with Nirguna Brahman and not Saguna Brahman.


What does this merging mean (I was sticking to the definitions of tattva
bOdha and vEdAnta sAra)? This merging seems to mean different things in
different sub-schools. Could you let me know what merging means for you?

A Mukta
> never comes back, that is the assertion of our Vedas.


Ishvara, also, being nityamukta should never come back then. But we see shrI
rAma and shrI kR^iShNa amongst us. How is this explained?

All jeevas are

In the version I presented, mukti has the meaning that AvaraNa no longer
deludes the jIva.

Hmm...it seems like the theory of advaita vEdAnta you are talking about
starts with different premises. Could you maybe, if possible, present a
short summary of what the definition of jIva, Ishvara, mOkSha are? Thanks.

A.Siddhartha.
