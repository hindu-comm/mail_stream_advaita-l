How? The first part of your statement sounds like it contradicts the
second. Anyway, see: "His writings of this period are filled with
references to Plato, Plotinus, Clement, Philo, Augustine, Aquinas,
*Shankara*, Eckhart, Rhinish and other Asian mystics." and " his
metaphysical writings aimed, among other things, at demonstrating the
unity of the Vedanta and Platonism" from
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ananda_Coomaraswamy.

While Advaita Vedanta or even Dvaita and other systems are clearly
defined in numerous works, the karma-kANDa portion of dharma, or
pravR^itti dharma, is the one that is most misunderstood by academics
in the West and manipulated by interested parties in India. So I'd
like to see Hindus  who practise Dharma to take up the study of the
larger karma-based philosophy (excluding "Vedanta") of Hinduism in
academia.

For example, see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asvamedha. Is this the
view of traditional shrauta paNDitas?

Regards,
Abhishek
