Yes, the last Hindu academic of prominence that I have heard of is Ananda
Kumaraswamy (or Coomaraswamy), a Sri Lankan Tamil Brahmana.

Yes this trend has to grow and hopefully be repeated in India too.

I've experienced this even on the internet: Westerners treating Hinduism as
a dead religion. As a Hindu author puts it, if Hindus tried to put forward

Egyptian mummies came to life.

An unfortunate characterstic among Indian academics too who for most of the
time try to deny that Hinduism exists!
