Dear Sri Jaldhar,

Trust you are keeping well. I had some questions and I would be glad if you
could forward it to the learned members in the advaita-l list.

I primarily wish to know how the divitIya anuvaka of the purusha sUkta is
interpreted in the smartha tradition. Second, i also wish to know if Adi
Shankara has commented upon the MudgalOpanishad.

Thank you,

Regards,

Malolan
