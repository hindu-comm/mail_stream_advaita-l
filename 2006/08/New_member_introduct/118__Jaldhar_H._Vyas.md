Hari Om,

I'm a student of philosophy pursuing post graduate at University of 
Madras, Chennai. Though a VisistAdvaitin by origin, I am much inclined to 
the philosophy of Advaita vedAnta. The very reason to join this group is 
to learn more about Advaita literatures vide ., Naishkarmya siddhi, Brahma 
siddhi of SureshwarAchArya ; Advaita siddhi of MadhusUdhana Saraswati & so 
on. Further more, Ii'm ideologically bothered about the controvery that 
perpetually persists in the authorship of many Advaita literature's such 
as Shri Adi Samkara's DakshinAmuthi stotra - its vArtika of 
SureshwarAchArya and many others. Hope i may soon be a member of your 
group. i seriously aspire for the same.

PranAms,

Antharyami
