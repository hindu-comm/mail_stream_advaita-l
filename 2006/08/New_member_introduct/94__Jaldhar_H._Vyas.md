Hello
my interest in Advaita Vedanta goes along with my interest in indian
culture. I am a portuguese nacional, 58 yeras old, graphic designer by
profession. I've studied History of Indian Art in India in tha Banaras
Hindu University. For the last ten years I read and ask about the
world. Advaita can be a way to end this dual tension between me and
the universe.
