My name is Peter. 56yrs of age.  A background in transpersonal psychology
and psychotherapy.  A student of 'Eastern traditions' in general for many
years, of Advaita Vedanta, and in particular a devotee of Sri Ramana
Maharshi.  I am a member of "Advaitins" Yahoo Group, and a number of
RamanaMaharshi Yahoo Groups, for a few years, and from time to time receive
recomendations to join Advaita-l due to benefit from the quality of its
contibutions from experienced members.  Thus, I have finally subscribed and
send this introduction.

Please let me know if you require any further information.

sincerely,

Peter
