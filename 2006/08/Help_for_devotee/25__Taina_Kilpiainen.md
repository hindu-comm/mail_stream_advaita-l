Dear list member who lives in UK,

I am sorry I put message which don'd handle advaita
vedanta. 

I am asking help to one indian devotee who have got
work offer from UK, near London.

Is 27.500 pound yearly salary good/bad to cover taxes
and all living costs (rent, gas, electric, work
travelling, food etc) in living UK.

Some his friend have said salary is not enough to
cover all living costs after taxes so he asked my help
to enquiry about this.

So if anyone UK list-member would help in this thing.
