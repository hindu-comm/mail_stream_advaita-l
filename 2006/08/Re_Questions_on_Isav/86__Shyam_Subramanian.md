Namaste Sri Vidyasankar,

Sorry for nitpicking on something completely peripheral to your excellent
posts: I hope you don't
mind.

IMO, it is not correct to say that "vedaH gets transformed to vedo when
followed by specific kinds
of consonants" .  Simply because the transformation process resulting in
vedo
(vedas -> vedar -> vedo when followed by specific consonants or "a" )
does not involve the generation of "vedaH" at any stage. As I understand it
(and
as I am sure you know), a visarga is generated (r -> H) only when either a
pause follows or a
"khar" (kh, ph, ch, Th, th, c, T, t, k, p, S, sh, s).

My knowledge of sanskrit grammar is limited to sandhi rules, so
feel free to correct me if I am wrong.  If you meant otherwise,
do excuse me for taking a "literalist" interpretation of your
statement :-).

Regards,
Shyam
