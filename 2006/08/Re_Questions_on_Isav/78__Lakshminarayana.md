I am not sure I understand this. Swami Gambhirananda's
translation says  "amRtam : immortality,
identification with the deities - that very fact of
becoming one with the gods being called immortality."
How does krama-mukti come into the picture here?


Can you also tell me what is the difference between a
vArtika, vRtti and TIka? Are there any translations of
these available? Is it possible to learn sanskrit and
advaita-vedAnta (in its original language)
simultaneously? Thanks.
