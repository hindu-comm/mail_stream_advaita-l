Namaste Friends,

Ganesha Chaturthi on Sunday 27th August marked the arrival of Lord Ganesha
in millions of Indian homes and also the beginning of the 10 day Ganpati
festival when the Elephant headed God is worshipped. Many friends, Indian as
well as those not Indian, have asked the significance of this worship.

I am attaching a link to the intellectual and scientific reason for this
worship. Hope you enjoy reading it.

 One of the questions we are often asked or maybe ask ourselves is 'How do
we worship an elephant-headed, pot-bellied, broken-tusked god who travels on
a rat?' But strange as it seems, every little peculiarity of Lord Ganesha's
has a deep spiritual significance. Click on the link below to read about it:

 I take the opportunity to wish you the very best on this auspicious
occasion. Best wishes on the the occasion of Ganesh Chaturthi! Please visit

Warm regards,

Kamal
