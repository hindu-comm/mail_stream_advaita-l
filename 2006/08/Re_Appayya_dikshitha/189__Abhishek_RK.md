Your attempts to "show" the great Appaya Dikshita in such poor light
is itself enough to show your ignorance and bias. Incidentally,
several vaiShnavas have already "shown" that all the great advaitins
like Adisha~Nkara, vidyAraNya and others are actually vaiShNavas! We
really don't don't need any more such historical revisionisms.

What have you got against this important historical personality that
makes you speak like this?

This really shows your painful ignorance of ShaNmata sampradAya of
shrI Adisha~Nkara which includes *shaivam also*. What this means is
advaitins can have bhagavAn shiva as their iShTadevata and still be
advaitins. They may hold their iShTadevata above other devatas, but
that in no way goes against advaita or shA~Nkara sampradAya.

Regards,
Abhishek
