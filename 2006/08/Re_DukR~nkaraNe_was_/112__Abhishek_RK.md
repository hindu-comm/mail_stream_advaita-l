Namaste,

I agree. Many concepts in the Vedanta, not to mention the Vedic
mantras, are completely distorted if it is attempted to translate them
into English. I feel this is so because the two languages (Sanskrit
and English) are at the diametrical opposites in development and
maturity.

Regards,
Abhishek
