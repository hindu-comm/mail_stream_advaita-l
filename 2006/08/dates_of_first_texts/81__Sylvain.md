Namaste

On another list, someone claims that the notion of  " love " first appeared 
in the jewish sacred texts, around 12 centuries before Christ.

This person also says that buddhists took back the jewish notion of " love " 
in presenting " compassion ".

May i ask which hindu sanskrit word most accurately represent notions of  " 
love " and " compassion " (karuna?) and when this notion is commonly 
recognised to have been written first ?
