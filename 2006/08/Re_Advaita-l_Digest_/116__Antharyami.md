Hari Om,

Abhishekji !
i'm an amateur learner of sanskrit. the points putforth by you on the
yOgacArA/ madhyamnika cults with Advaita were informative relating it with
other nAstika traditions (i differ with your opinion - anyways). i am quite
intrested in confirming the meaning of the last sloka you habitually
indicate at the end of your discussion. ie.,
calA lakShmIshcalAH prANAshcalaM jIvita yauvanaM|
calAcale ca saMsAre dharma eko hi nishcalaH||

calA lakshmIshca - ever distorting (anithya) is wealth.
calA prAna - so do the prAna (not that is eternal)
calam jIvita yauvanam - yauvanam here tends to mean static ? jIva is
distorted or does it claim that the youthfulness of jIva is anithya ?
calAcale ca samsAre - emphatically  ascribes anithya to samsAra
dharma Eko hi nishcalah - apparentlly its evident to regard dharma alone is
self settled.

Also kindly let me know the source for this sloka.

PranAms,
