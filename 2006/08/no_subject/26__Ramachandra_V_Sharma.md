Hello all,
        This message is regarding Puranas classification and Advaita philosophy mention in Vishnu puranas.
Primarily Puranas can be classified as Vishnu Puranas, Brahma Puranas, and Shiva Puranas. 
Vishnu Puranas are considered as consisting of Satwika component only.
Brahma Puranas are considered as consisting of Satwika as well as Rajas. While Shiva Puranas consist of Satwika, Rajas, Tamas.

That should not take away any credit from Shiva Puranas.

Vishnu Puranas and advaita concept:
======================================
1. In Vishnu Purana the story of Jada Bharatha and Sage Ribhu tell us they were Advaita philosophers.

2. In Varaha purana story of Kapila to King and some more stories are dedicated to Advaita.

3. In fact most portion of Kurma Purana in which Lord Vishnu tells Narada about Ishwara Geeta which is Advaita philosophy.

Regards,
Ramachandra
