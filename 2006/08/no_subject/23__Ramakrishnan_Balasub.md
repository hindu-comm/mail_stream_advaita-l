Here we go again. Yet another Srivaishnavite trying to impose his
"vishnu-is-the-best" stuff on Sankara. This has been dealt extensively
by me before on this list (with proper quotations from various
bhaashyas). I suggest the archives.

I wonder why many Srivaishnavites are trying to get Sankara's approval
for their pet theories. Frankly, and quite bluntly, nonsense such as
found below is not going to convince any smaarta.
