Namaste,
The below arguments are quite ridiculous and below any level of truth.
Such mindless criticism of anything is exactly that: "mindless", and
is highly suspect to being motivated by adharma and confusion. The
spiritual value of maThas cannot be discounted from a Dharmic
perspective, but slandering can come only from a secular angle and is
not too uncommon in many circles.

Regards,
Abhishek
