Subject: [Advaita-l] Books for Reference

praNAM all,
       Could someone let me know about the availability of the following
books of svAmi chandrashEkhara bhArati in the bay area (or elsewhere in
the
USA).
-- Dialogues with the Guru
-- The call of the Jagadguru

Also, can someone suggest a basic reference for the position of the
bhAmati
and the vivaraNa sub-schools on different issues.

Thanks for the help.

A.Siddhartha.
