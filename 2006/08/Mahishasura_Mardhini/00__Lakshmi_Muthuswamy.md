Namaste,

  Reciting the Lords name in the form of stotras and shlokas, there is no time specification. Anytime that you remember the name of the Lord, that moment is an auspicious moment. 

  There are restrictions for the chanting of the Vedas but not for stotras, sholas and nama japa.

  I have been reciting the Mahishasura Mardhini Sloka (of Shankaracharya)
daily morning.. Recently my friend told me that it cannot be recited
daily as there are only specific days in the week etc

Can this learned forum clarify as what are all days are OK for its
recitation and why it is so ?
