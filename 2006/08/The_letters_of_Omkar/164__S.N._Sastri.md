The great Polymath Srimad Appayya Dikshita makes an interesting statement
about the constituent letters of the praNava Om in his work
'SivArkamaNidIpikA'.  He says: "It is well known from works such as
PrapanchasAra of SrI Sankara that Om (aum) is the combination of the first
letter of the first veda, the middle letter of the middle veda and the last
letter of the last veda".

The first letter of Rgveda is 'a' of agnimILe'. The middle letter of
yajurveda is 'u' of the word 'samudro'  which comes right in the middle of
this veda. The last letter of sAmaveda is 'm', since this veda ends with the
words 'samAnam varam'.
