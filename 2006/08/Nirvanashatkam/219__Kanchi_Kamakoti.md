Dear Sastriji,

  I was talking to my friend Anbu who thought ashtakam would normally have eight slokas.  That's why I asked you.

  Regards,
  Kanchinathan

Namaskaram. Please bear with me for asking a dumb question as I am a
novice. I saw your posting of Nirvanashtakam on your website. There are
only six slokas. What happened to the other two?
