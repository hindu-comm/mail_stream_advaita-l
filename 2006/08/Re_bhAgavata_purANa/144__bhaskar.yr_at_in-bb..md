Of these, six are Sattvic Puranas and glorify Vishnu; six are
Rajasic and glorify Brahma; six are Tamasic and they glorify Siva."

Hare Krishna

I would like to know what would be the criteria that is going to determine
whether one purANa is sAtvic  or tAmasic??  It seems some purANa-s have
been classified as tAmasic only because  these purANa-s eulogizes shiva
bhagavAn??  But in socalled sAtvic puraNA-s where vishNu bhagavAn is the
main deity, shiva bhagavan has also been given the equal importance &
glorified on par with vishNu.  So, IMHO, these classifications are purely
subjective opinion of some bigoted  schools.  By the way, dEvi bhAgavata
comes under which category??

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
