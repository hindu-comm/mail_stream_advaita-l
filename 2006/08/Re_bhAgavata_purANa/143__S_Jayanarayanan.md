I have come across an English translation of some Puranas by Smarta
Pandits that contained a couple of references in the foreword about
such a classification to be found in the Puranas themselves, but
unfortunately I can't remember the source offhand now. However, the
two Puranic references given disagreed with each other as to which
Puranas were Sattvic, Rajasic and Tamasic. It should be noted that
there are references to the Bhagavata Purana in other Puranas.

Swami Sivananda also teaches such a classification, but doesn't
provide detailed references:

The Puranas
By Sri Swami Sivananda
"The main Puranas are: Vishnu Purana, Naradiya Purana, Srimad
Bhagavata Purana, Garuda (Suparna) Purana, Padma Purana, Varaha
Purana, Brahma Purana, Brahmanda Purana, Brahma Vaivarta Purana,
Markandeya Purana, Bhavishya Purana, Vamana Purana, Matsya Purana,
Kurma Purana, Linga Purana, Siva Purana, Skanda Purana and Agni
Purana. Of these, six are Sattvic Puranas and glorify Vishnu; six are
Rajasic and glorify Brahma; six are Tamasic and they glorify Siva."

The Wikipedia, although not always a trustworthy source, gives a
reference from the Padma Purana:
