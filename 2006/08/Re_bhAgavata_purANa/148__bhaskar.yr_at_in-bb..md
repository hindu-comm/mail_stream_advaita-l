Swami Sivananda (who cannot be labelled "bigoted", btw) does not say
that the rule for the classification of Puranas is according to the
deity being extolled, but that it his *observation* that those
Puranas that have been classified by the Puranas themselves as
Sattvic generally glorify Vishnu, etc.

praNAms Sri Karthik prabhuji
Hare Krishna

Thanks for your kind clarification...but still I am not clear on what basis
we can do this classification &  favouring vishNu bhagavan by saying all
purANa-s pertaining to him is sAtvic  & putting shiva bhagavan in the realm
of tAmasic world:-))...btw, one more doubt, does this classification of
purANa-s also implies gradation within purANa-s themselves??  is there
anywhere mentioned tAmasic puraNAs are inferior in its doctrine when
compared to that of sAtvic & rAjasic purANa-s??  again, upto what extent we
can consider tAmasic purANa-s as valid pramANa??  Anyway, it is really
strange to hear that shiva mahApurANa is tAmasic since the very word shiva
itself means *auspicious/gracious/benign* (maNgalakara)...

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
