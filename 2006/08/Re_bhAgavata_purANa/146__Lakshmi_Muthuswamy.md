"devi bhagavata comes under which category??

  namste bhaskarji,

  must be a combination of all three sattva-rajas-tamas!! three in one.

  Since the Devi Bhagavata deals with the leelas of the cosorts of the trinities viShNu, lakshmi -sattvic, brahma, sarasvati -rajasic, shiva, parvati -tamasic.

  om namo narayanaya
  Lakshmi Muthuswamy
