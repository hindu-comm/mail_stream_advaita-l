Even if the dates of the purANa texts as we currently know them are post-Sankara, it doesn't follow that their number was different in earlier times. The Indian tradition is quite strong in remembering and transmitting these kinds of numbers. We need to free our minds from the tyranny of the written word and look at the purANa-s as orally transmitted texts that were relatively more elastic in their scope and therefore subject to change over time.

As far as advaita is concerned, there is no particular advantage or disadvantage conferred by taking a position on whether vyAsa is considered an incarnation of nArAyaNa or not.

itihAsa-purANa is definitely considered as part of SAstra. See for example, various references in brahmasUtra and bhagavadgItA bhAshya-s.

However, in the vedAnta tradition, purANas were never considered to be commentaries on the veda and there was never any school that needed to interpret the vedAnta according to purANic references. To describe the bhAgavata as a commentary on the upanishats and to interpret accordingly are relatively very recent trends in some schools.

It would be interesting to know the SAstra pramANa for classifying the purANa-s thus. I don't know whether a scholar like appayya dIkshita ever felt the need to address this classification.

No. vedAnta = uttara mImAMsA. There are three starting points (prasthAna-s) for vedAnta: revelation (Sruti - upanishats), remembered traditions, (smRti - gItA, primarily, but also yogaSAstra texts, Apastambha/ASvalAyana/baudhAyana/ ... sUtra-s, manusmRti etc.) and logic (nyAya - brahmasUtra-s). Please note that the gItA is part of the mahAbhArata, the primary itihAsa text. Numerous sUtras in the brahmasUtra read, "api ca smaryate," "smaranti ca" etc. Most of the times, the reference is to the gItA. Inasmuch as the brahmasUtra is the primary sUtra of uttara mImAMsA, we have to note that the interpretation is not only of upanishat texts, but also of the gItA and affiliated texts.

Perhaps this was because in the historical prime of the advaita tradition, the purANas were considered to be simple enough to not require further commentaries on them. In upadeSasAhasrI, Sankara specifically says the sAdhaka should study vyAsamata (the thought of vyAsa) and the upanishat-s. This has to be a reference to primarily the gItA and secondarily the mahAbhArata itself.
