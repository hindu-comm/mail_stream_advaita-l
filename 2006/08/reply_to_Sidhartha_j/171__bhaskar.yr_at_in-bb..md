Adi Sankara does not take sides to saiva and
VaisNava sects. His philosophy transcends beyond such distinctions  wherein
he affirms Sri NArAyaNa alone as SaguNa Brahman.

praNAms
Hare Krishna

I'd like to see the reference in prasthAna trayi bhAshya for your above
statement i.e. narAyaNa *alone* is saguNa brahma...Ofcourse, shankara says
in gIta bhAshya krishnastu bhagavan svayaM...but it does not mean
shankara/shiva bhagavan is not!!  but it is interesting to note that
whenever shankara speaks about *pratIkOpAsana* in sUtra bhAshya he gives
only the example of sAligrAme vishNuH and NOT liNgE shaMbhuH...

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
