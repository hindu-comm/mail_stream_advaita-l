The third shloka:

vAkyArthaH suvichAryatAM shrutishiraH pakShaH samAshrIyatAM

brahmAsmIti vibhAvyatAmaharahargarvaH parityajyatAM

1. The meanings of the Mahavakyas should be carefully enquired into
2. The conclusions of the Upanishads (shruti-shira-paksha) should be taken
up and practised
3. Wrong and useless discussions (dustarka) should be abandoned
4. Those arguments (tarka) which support the Vedas should be ever remembered
5. That 'I am Brahman' (Brahmaasmi) should be constantly contemplated upon
6. Pride should be given up
7. The feeling that the body is the self should be discarded
8. (Needless) arguments with the learned (budhajanair-vada) should be
discarded

Regards,
Abhishek
