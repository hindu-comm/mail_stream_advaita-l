Namaste,

If gauDapAda makes use of mAdhyamika logic in his
kArikA, then why does Sankara merely dismiss the
shUnyavAdins as nihilists? One possibility is that
Sankara misunderstood shUnyavAda, but this appears
unlikely given that gauDapAda understands it well and
Sankara himself displays a good understanding of other
buddhist schools, especially vijNAnavada, which is the
other mahAyAna school.

Does Sankara imply that the shUnyavAdin's logic leads
directly to nihilism? If so, how?
