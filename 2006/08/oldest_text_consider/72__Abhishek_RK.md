"I salute the Guru parampara which starts with Sadashiva, with
Shankaracharya in the middle and includes all the other Acharyas".

This shloka is usually chanted in the smArta sampradAya, but other
sampradAyas have similar shlokas to pay their respects to their lineages. I
don't know if there is any source as such.

Regards,
Abhishek
