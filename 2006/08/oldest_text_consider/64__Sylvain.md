Thanks for your reply, Krunal.

Do you know the approximate date of those writings ?

Subject: RE: [Advaita-l] oldest text considering everyone as oneself


namo narayana,

Dear Sylvain,

> What is the oldest hindu text that claim the importance of considering 
> everyone as oneself,

sarvam khalu idam brahma (chandogya upanishad 3.14.1) + ayam AtmA brahma 
(bR^ihadAranyaka upanishad 2.5.19)

Everything is verily brahman + Atman is brahman

>loving others,
yastu sarvaaNi bhuutaanyaatmanyevaanupashyati .sarvabhuuteshhu chaatmaana.n 
tato na vijugupsate  isha up. 6

He who sees all beings in the Self itself, and the Self in all beings, feels 
no hatred by virtue of that realisation

>or advaita ideas ?

To my knowledge, the phrase 'advaita' or non-dual comes from the mandukya 
upanishad verse 7.

I don't know if i am correct with the above but I pray to the scholars to 
correct me if i have made any mistakes.Kind regards,Krunal
