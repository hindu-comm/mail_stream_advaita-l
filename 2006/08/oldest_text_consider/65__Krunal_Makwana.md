Dear Sylvain,
> Do you know the approximate date of those writings ?

As the quotes that i have given you are upanishad texts, they are classified as shruti, hence no date can be given as shruti are classified to be sanAtana (eternal).

But if you are asking when these divine revelations were put to pen and paper, only the scholars of this list would be able to answer that.

I hope i have assisted you in this matter.Kind regards,Krunal
