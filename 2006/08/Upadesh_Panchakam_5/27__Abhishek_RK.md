(Resending with heading)

The fifth and final shloka. As said in the introduction, this describes the
actions of a Brahmajnani.

1. Solitude must be enjoyed
2. The mind must be concentrated on Brahman
3. The Atman, which is all-pervasive should be well perceived
4. It should be seen that this world disappears in the light of such
knowledge
5. The gathered fruits of the actions of the previous births (sanchita
karma)should be destroyed through such knowledge
6. Such a one will not be touched by future actions
7. The actions, the consequences of which are being suffered in this
birth, (prarabdha karma) should be endured
8. Thereafter one will exist in the form of Parabrahman

Abhishek
