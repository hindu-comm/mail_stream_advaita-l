Yes I slightly misstated the case there.  The Mahabharata and Puranas were 
composed at the beginning of the dvapara yuga when Maharshi Vyas foresaw 
the evil of the coming Kaliyuga.

If you count from the first recitation which was at the sarpa yajna of 
King Parikshit then it is quite clearly in the Kaliyuga which began after 
Krshna Bhagavan left His mortal body.  The other Puranas are also said to 
have been first recited in the 1000 year sattra in Naimisharanya.

Apart from the the already mentioned 1.4.3 Shukadevaji says in 2.1.8:

idaM bhAgavataM nAma purANaM brahmasaMmitam |
adhItaVAndvAparadau piturdvaipAyanAdaham || 8 ||

This purana called Bhagavata was first revealed by Brahma.  At the 
beginning of the Dvaparayuga, I learned it from my father Dvaipayana [i.e. 
Vyasa]

There are many other references in the 1st skandha especially to Vyasaji
being the author of the Bhagavata and teaching it to Shukaji. 1.1.3 is yet 
another.

Unfortunately my source (the introduction to a Gujarati translation of 
Bhagavata purana) doesn't state the exact verse but only gives the quote:

sa AshrayaH paraM brahma paramAtmA parAtpara iti bhAgavate |

If anyone knows where in the VishnusahasranamabhAshya this quote is to be 
found (if it is to be found at all) please let us know.

  Neither, rAmAnuja quotes any such

Advaita commentators such as Shridhar Swami take para and avara in 1.1.7 
to refer to saguna and nirguna aspects of Bhagavan.

Which should not stop us from accepting it as an authoritative shastra. 
My surname Vyas comes from my ancestors' association with Bhagavata katha 
and we are 100% Smartas.

  It was interesting to know about the

Well the tradition calls him the author.  Undoubtedly he incorporated 
older material though.
