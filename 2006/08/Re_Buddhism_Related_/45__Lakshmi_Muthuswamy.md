I have some issues with the above. Firstly, It is wrong to say
"Atman/brahman is not an entity that exists". This is really
unbelievable seeing this in a advaita- list.
And "It is that which lends existence to all entities, be it the
computer, the table or the jIva. It is existence itself. What is, is
Atman/brahman" This sound more like Bauddha mata to me. So far I've
never heard of any advaitin speak this way!

Abhishek, from the above post of yours, it is very clear that brahma Atma aikayam has been very well understood by you. Excellent.
