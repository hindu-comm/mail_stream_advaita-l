An interesting observation. Jainism is much older than Buddhism and forms
part of the shramaNa tradition. I don't believe that the shramaNa
tradition is diametrically opposed to the brAhmaNa tradition as the latter
has been much influenced by the former. For example, in the vedas and
smR^itis, non-vegetarianism is not made a vidhi, but it could have come
about due to the shramaNa influence. IMO, even though this topic is out of
scope of this list, the shramaNa influence on vaidikas should be studied.
But as Jaldhar mentions, even this influence is probably not much, when you
consider the fact that Jainism has been around for a long long time in
Bharat. Possibly, the shramaNas have been more influenced by the brAhmaNas
than the other way round; but without historical proof, we can't say
anything for sure.

Regards,
Abhishek
