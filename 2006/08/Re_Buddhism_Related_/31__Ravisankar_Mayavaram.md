namaste Karthik:

1.  Any discussion on this subject should be text based and it should
have prior moderator approval. The text under question should also be
quoted in the messages and possibly in the original language.

2. The prakaraNa you mention was discussed in the past and the common
background for the terminology was also discussed. There is nothing
wrong in discussing that again,  but the material posted should show
rigor. That is one of the reason, I prefer that one of the moderator
compiles these posts and sends them to list.  I specifically requested
Vidyasankar's help because of the academic nature of this discussion.

3. We don't want the discussion to derail to "what Sri Buddha taught
is same as advaita-vedAnta, it was later misunderstood .... etc.
etc.". Even this claim is OK to discuss if the there is sufficient
textual reference and discussion is based on that.


Since you are very interested in this topic, we can evolve the
modalities through a private discussion. May be you can help Vidya (if
he agrees) to compile post the material on this subject. But I
strongly believe that this discussion has to be edited. May be one of
us can create a blog (which is easy to control and moderate the
followups) and the post the compilation once a week to the list. This
compilation will also add a lot of value to the archives.

I any case, we can discuss in privately and any one who want to
participate this can post to listmaster at advaita-vedanta.org. If I do
not repsond quickly please do not mistake me. This month is an
important month (we had varalakshmi vrata last  friday, this week we
have upAkarma and gayatrI japa, later we have krishna janmAshTami and
then  ganesha chaturthi).



WIth best wishes,

Ravi
