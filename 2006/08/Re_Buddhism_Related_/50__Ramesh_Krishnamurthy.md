What Sri Amuthan & Sri Lakshminarayana said is precisely what I meant.
The Atman is not an object of perception.

My thanks to Sri Amuthan & Sri Lakshminarayana for their posts.

What is meant by "independent of that Atma"? When viewed as the Atman,
there is no nAmarUpa, as the Atman is undifferentiated. When one uses
the word 'pot', it connotes a particular nAma-rUpa, which is mithyA.

As Amuthan said above - "existence is brahman and the pot is mithyA".
Hence my earlier statement - "What is, is Atman/brahman". This is more
accurate than saying "Atman exists".

I am making this request once again - pl read the article named
"Samadhi" by Sw. Dayananda Saraswati. Here is the link again:
