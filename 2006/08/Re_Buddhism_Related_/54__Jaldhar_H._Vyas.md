All Tirthankaras are Arhats but not all Arhats are Tirthankaras. 
Interestingly my neighbour, an educated Jain Shravaka (layman) whom I 
asked about this explained it as "An Arhat is a Jivanmukta."

In the Vishnupurana passage I quoted, Vishnu Bhagavan calls his followers 
Arhats not Himself.

I meant ultimate in the sense of last.  There is no metaphysical concept 
beyond this point.

Sorry, I am refering to Gaudapadacharyas Mandukya karikas 4.83-84. 
Neither Gaudapadacharya  nor actually Shankaracharya identify the 4 
incorrect theories but Anandagiri's tika says they refer to Samkhya, 
Charvaka, Jaina, and "Shunyavadi" (not specified further) Bauddhas.
