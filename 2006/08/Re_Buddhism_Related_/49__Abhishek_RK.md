That is in the context of a particular prakriya. One cannot selectively
quote such statements, instead it would make more sense within the
particular context. That is why when I saw Sri Ramesh just say randomly that
the Atma does not exist I was quite amazed.

i'm afraid you're again wrong. take any experience

Yes but in what sense? sarvaM cha nAmarUpAdi sadAtmanaiva satyaM vikArajAtaM
svatastu anR^itameva. So all forms *are* sat (not mithya) when viewed as the
Atma, but independent of that Atma they are mithya. This is what I have
understood.

As I said earlier, I could be wrong in saying that this *is* a buddhist
view, as I am not familiar with bauddha mata.

Abhishek
