I agree 100% with Kartik. The kind of "moderation" Sri Ravi suggested
is a sure-fire way of killing the discussion. This is not to say that
anything and everything should be discussed. But bauddham is an
important element of our philosophic tradition and a part of the same
culture as vedAnta and the other darSana-s.

The very fact that scholars spend so much time on debating the
similarities & differences between advaita-vedAnta and some of the
bauddha schools is an indicator of the relative closeness of the two
traditions. New issues keep coming up and so debate & discussion are
very much needed.

Maybe I should use "bauddham" or "arya dhamma" or some such term to
bypass the moderator :))

Anyway, what I am dying to know is - is anybody planning to write
something on the equivalence or otherwise of mithyA and shUnyata?
Kartik, what about you for a start? You are quite a scholar yourself,
and have read a lot on the two traditions.
