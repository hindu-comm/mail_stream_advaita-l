Namaste Shri Jaldhar,

Sorry for the late reply on this topic.

Does Anandagiri mention any reason why the
shUnyavAdin's point of view is expressed by using a
double "nAsti"? I can understand the usage of "asti"
for referring to the sAmkhya viewpoint, but the others
are a little bit vague. It would therefore help if
Anandagiri also has something to say on the reference
to jains and charvakas in this verse. Does he discuss
this issue in more detail?

Interestingly you said - "shUnyavAdin (not specified
further)". Are you hinting at the possibility of a
non-mAdhyamika shUnyavAdi bauddha?
