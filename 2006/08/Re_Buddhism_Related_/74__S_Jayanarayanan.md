Thanks a lot for developing list guidelines to help foster
discussions on this subject.

I'm not sure I can take on a "leadership" role in the discussions, it
is more likely to be a "bystander" role. I will however send the
moderators a write-up concerning the false statements that can be
made on this topic so that future discussions can steer away from
these potholes. This may take some time though.
