Namaste,

Apologies for jumping into this.

I have some issues with the above. Firstly, It is wrong to say
"Atman/brahman is not an entity that exists". This is really
unbelievable seeing this in a advaita- list.
And "It is that which lends existence to all entities, be it the
computer, the table or the jIva. It is existence itself. What is, is
Atman/brahman" This sound more like Bauddha mata to me. So far I've
never heard of any advaitin speak this way!

Brahman is not said to be "knowable" in the paramArthik sense. It was
used here to emphasise that Brahman is existence and that we "know"
because of Brahman.

May I remind you that these are allegations? And allegations are *not* facts.

If one is biased towards towards physics or chemistry, one could
easily say advaita and such subjects are so similar.

Only to some people who have internalised their opponents' arguments
as their own.

Abhishek
