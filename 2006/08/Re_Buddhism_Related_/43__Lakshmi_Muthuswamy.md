You would do well as a headmaster in a government school in India. No
teacher would dare to absent himself :)"

  Namaste Rameshji,

  I burst out into lughter reading the above statements of yours. I am still laughing as I am posting this reply.

  Looks like the teenager in you who is writing !!!  

  Did you have a lot of issues with your teachers and headmaster during your schooldays? The moderators must be reminding you of them, perhaps. 

  Never mind. Your post has been a source of Ananda for me. Thank you for the few moments of joy. These moments of joy makes one feel very light for some time.
