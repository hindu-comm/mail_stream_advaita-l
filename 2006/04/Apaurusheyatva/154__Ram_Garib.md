Re-arrangement works for yajurveda. How about atharva
veda? We know at one time it was not counted among
veda-s. What led to its acceptance as veda?

Apaurusheyatva of veda-s is more of a philosophical
stand than assertion of a fact that occurred (or did
not occur). Consider that sankhya-yoga assertion about
veda-as-the-word-of-God led to cyclical fallacy in
their argument. Apaurusheyatva is an attempt in
improving the philosophical basis of veda as a
pramana. Other than that, it does not seem to have
much use.

With regards,
Ram Garib
