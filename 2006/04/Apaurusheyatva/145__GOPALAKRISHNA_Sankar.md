Please dont use the word 'disgusting' whenever we refer puranas and their stories.
Its Bhagavan's leela, we the human beings with vyavaharika eyes cant comment on them.
Please dont take it personally, we should always respect Puranas and their stories.
There are so many members who are into this forum and they shouldnt get Bhuddhi bhedam,

NA BHUDDHI BHEDAM JANAYEAD AGNANAM.....

Pranams.
Gopal

In fact the Vamshabrahmanas of the Shatapatha Brahmana mention some 60
generations before Yajnavalkya.

Point of information: according to the shastras, seeing the onset of the
Kaliyuga and fearing the diminished mental capacity of the people would
cause them to forget Dharma, Krshna Dvaipayana took the various mantras
which were the "property" of different Rshis and organized them into 4
and taught them to his 4 pupils who then taught them to their many pupils
who were the founders of the various shakhas.  This is how he got the
name Veda Vyasa ("arranger of the Vedas") He taught the Yajurveda to
Vaishampayana as you said, whose quarrelsome student was Yajnavalkya.

Actually the shastras are silent on how exactly some people came to see
mantras.  Meditation is one theory.  Some have even suggested it was the
hallucinogenic powers of the Soma plant.

The story in the puranas is a bit more disgusting.  Yajnavalkya was the
best but Vaishampayana had 1000 other students.  After the quarrel,
Yajnavalkya vomitted up all he had learnt and the students became tittira
birds to eat it up.
