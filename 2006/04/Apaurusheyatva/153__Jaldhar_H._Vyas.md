For one thing, most of the contents of the Shuklayajurveda are the same as
the Krshnayajurveda, just arranged differently.

Personally I do. It didn't necessarily have to be a "conversation" though.

Sure.  In fact that's a good analogy because the mantras are seen as being
part of the fabric of the universe itself just like scientific laws.

Exactly.  We call it Einsteins theory, purely be convention.  Now imagine
someone said "Einstein was a Jew so as Hindus we don't have to believe in
relativity."  That would be absurd right?  This is the whole point of the
doctrine of apaurusheyatva; that we should look at the meaning of the
words of the Rshis instead of trying to second guess them based on their
personalities (or gender etc.)
