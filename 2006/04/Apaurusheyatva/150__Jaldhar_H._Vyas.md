Needless to say we don't accept Madhva's interpretations as an 
authoritative source of our tradition.  We do agree that originally Veda 
was undifferentiated and its present shape is due to Maharshi Krshna 
Dvaipayana called Veda Vyasa

See for example Vishnu Purana 3.6.  Maharshi Sumantu was given the 
Atharvaveda.

What is your source for this?

Actually the contents of the Atharvaveda are rks and substantially the 
same as the Rgveda.  This why I'm thinking a seperate editorial process 
(but not so different as to drive AV out of the canon altogether) is the 
best explanation.

The Rshis were often quarrelsome and temperamental (look how many times 
in our shastras some hapless person gets cursed or some demon gets a boon 
and starts causing mayhem) but its a stretch to draw too many conclusions 
from this I think.
