Tradition holds that veda was one in satyuga and was
known as mula-veda. See Acharya Madhwa's bhashya on
atharvana upanishad(1.3) below:

 "mUlaveda iti hyAkhyA kAle kR^itayuge tadA"

In the treta-yuga, Lord in the form of
Hayagriva divided the mUla-veda based on poetry,
prose and svara/music -- Rik, Nigada and sAma. I
believe this is the explanation generally given about
mention of trayi-vidya in scriptures.

In dvapara, Lord in the form of veda vyasa is supposed
to have extracted a few rik-s from rig Veda, yajus
from the Nigada, and sAma from sAmaveda. However, here
also I have not seen atharvana mentioned seaparately.

If atharvaNangirasau is taken as a school of veda,
then how do we explain angiras' quarrel with upholders
of trayi vidya, since presumably, everything would
have been covered in rik, nigada and sama. Isn't it?

With regards,
Ram Garib
