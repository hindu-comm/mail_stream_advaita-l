It is told in many Puranas.  The account I gave was based on Vishnu 
Purana, III 4-6

I am assuming this story is authentic, for now.

Some points.

1.  the contents of the Shuklayajurveda are not substantially different 
from the Krshnayajurveda.  Only the arrangement is different.

2.  In that same Vishnupurana account it says that Krshna Dvaipayana is 
only the Veda Vyasa of the present age.  In fact in every cycle of 
creation there is a Veda Vyasa who organizes the Vedas in the same way. 
So presumably  Surya Bhagavan knew those mantras from before and taught 
them.

3. There are no more Rshis ecause of the deterioration of the human mind 
since the "golden age" (krta yuga)

Ok perhaps I wasn't clear.  What I meant that relativity is called 
Einsteins theory not because relativity depends on him in some way but as 
a courtesy because he was the first to discover it.  In the same way, some 
names of people are associated with certain Vedic texts because they were 
the first to discover them.  Presumably in the next yuga cycle, there will 
be a different set of names associated with them, but the mantras 
themselves will be the same.

On this point I would like to note that many scholars of both the orthodox 
and historical-critical variety think that Buddhism was already on the 
decline by Shankaracharya time and the credit for that should go to Purva 
Mimamsa, Nyaya-vaisheshika philosphers, along with bhakti movements like 
the alvars etc.  This doesn't affect your question though.

Apaurusheyatva only addresses certain types of opponents.  Obviously 
nastikas are not going to be swayed by that so a different approach has to 
be taken.

While I think we take rationality further than most religions, in the end 
ours is also based on faith and as you said you either accept it or not. 
But some forms of faith are more helpful than others.  apaurusheyatva 
prevents end runs around rationality via "enlightened masters" rearranging 
everything on a whim.
