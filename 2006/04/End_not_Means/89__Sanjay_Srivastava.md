There are two issues involved here. The experiment as you suggested involves
yogic ability to look into the future not the past. Therefore such ability
does not solve the issue rather raises further complications of determinism
vs. free will and the question of moral accountability in case of an already
determined future.

Secondly, effects of transgressions cannot be measured even in this life,
not to talk of past or future lives. Is their any measurement possible of
merit/demerit earned through such acts?

Note that I am not suggesting any inferiority based on caste or gender.
However, it makes sense to be safe than sorry in matters where we do not
know anything with better certainty.

A pramANa can never contradict with another pramANa. If they seem to
contradict, then they need to be reconciled considering the domain of their
influence.

You can accept the shruti, you can reject the shruti or you can decide to
pick-and-chose what to accept and what to reject. All three approaches have
their pros-and-cons. It is impossible to logically prove superiority of one
over the other. However, the three approaches lead to very different results
and conclusions and ultimately, it rests with the individual to decide what
he wants to do with his life.
