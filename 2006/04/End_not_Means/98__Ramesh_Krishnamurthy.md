To my knowledge, there is no categorical denial in the Sruti.

The Satapatha Brahmana of the Yajurveda provides the procedure for
Upanayana for Brahmana-s, Kshatriya-s and Vaishya-s. As there is no
procedure mentioned for Sudra-s and as the language uses the male
gender, the traditional interpretation is that only male Brahmana-s,
Kshatriya-s and Vaishya-s can undergo Upanayana and recite the Veda.

For that matter, even the Deva-s are not supposed to recite the Veda
:)) If you read the archives, you'll see that Jaldhar makes this point
many times.

So "Aham Brahaasmi" and "women should not recite the Veda" are not on
the same level.

In practice however, all these things are dictated by tradition and
not what the shaastra-s say. People do or do not read the Veda because
of tradition and not because the shaastra-s say they should or should
not.
