Dear Jaladharji,
The Arya Samaj in Bangalore under a subcommittee called "Veda Bhashya
Samiti" has taken up an uphill task of translating all the four Vedas to
Kannada under the scope of " Mane Manegu Veda" meaning Vedas to every house.
They have planned 20 Volumes of 600 pages and already 12 volumes are
released. The cost for the whole set is Rs. 4200/- .
I learnt that the translations are biased and carries the direct meaning and
not the hidden meaning. It is for the Erudite to offer their opinion if
anybody has gone through them.
I am not aware of the activities of Brahmo Samaj, . though there seems to be
activities in Arya Samaj Bangalore

"Yasya Brahmani Ramate Chittam, Nandati Nandati Nandatyeva"
(The mind playing with Brahman ever revels)
