The case of WHAT the tradition says about something like recitation of
the vedas by women was solved as soon as the relevent scriptures
became accepted into the traditional canon. The case of WHY the
tradition is what it is, was never a solved case. And I don't see it
being solved for a long time, longer if we refuse to discuss it.
