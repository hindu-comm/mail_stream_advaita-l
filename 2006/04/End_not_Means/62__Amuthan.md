namo nArAyaNAya!

dear shrI manIsh wadhwa and shrI vishvanAthan,

as shrI vidyAsha~Nkar sundareshan pointed out in an
earlier post on this thread, a *lot* of effort is
required *before* one can effectively look inward. it
was to stress on this that i pointed out that quote
from svAmi vivekAnanda.

i would like to point out that this issue of 'women
and veda-s' is NOT a problem that has remained
unsolved for centuries. until recently (about 100
years back), this *problem* never existed.

the notion that one has to be in a 'notionless' state
is also something that has to be got rid of :)

tradition is necessary as long as attachment to this
body exists. getting out of 'the bondage' of tradition
is not something that has to be artificially imposed.
it happens automatically just as a dry leaf falls from
a tree.
