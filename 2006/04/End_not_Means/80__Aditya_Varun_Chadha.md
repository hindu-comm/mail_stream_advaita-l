the "still small voice" does not have scriptures as a NECESSARY
prerequisite. nAstika societies are no more or less "harmonious" (in
terms of ethical behaviour) than Astika ones.

scepticism SHOULD be used as a tool for clarification of old
assumptions and claims, but ofcourse, comes with the possibility of
falsifying those claims. Without a hint of scepticism are we not being
blind?

to measure adhikAra by measuring the effect of letting women study the
vedas and recording the demographics of how many attain mukti. Thanks
for clarifying the quantity subject to measurement yourself. Yes, the
existence of such an experiment proves that the Sruti's stand on women
studying the vedas IS falsifiable.

No, I don't think I'd get the Nobel prize, because it would not be
that significant a result. The existence of such an experiment is
trivial to see.

Actually, the second point is not an assumption. it is a logical
consequence of the existence of the experiment that you yourself have
clarified above. So whoever believes that Sruti is not FALSIFIABLE
(different from "false", mind you) against pratyakSa when dealing with
issues of Acharan, they are simply wrong. come on man, you yourself
admit to the existence of the experiment and its conductability.

Do you see the qualititative difference between "brahman exists" and
"women should not read the vedas"? the difference is that the first is
not falsifiable but the second is. No two ways about it. by specifying
the exact experiment, you yourself have proved that the second
statement is falsifiable.
