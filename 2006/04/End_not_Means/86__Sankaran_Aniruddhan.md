Only if the vedas claim some 'effect' (ill or good) from women chanting 
the vedas. There may or may not be any observable effect. My understanding 
is that the only reason for the orthodox position is our vedic 
*tradition*. Again, this is not because women have any inherent physical 
or mental defect.

I myself am a little bit ambivalent on this issue. I understand that the 
orthodox scholars want to hold on to tradition. However, there have been 
some bad practices that have been condoned in the name of tradition.
