If one accepts shruti as pramana for ethics then its words should be 
enough.  If one doesn't then why does it matter if one can study it or

Also how can we discuss "why"?  Science deals with phenomena not 
motives.  Any other mode of interpretation would be just as subjective as 
the present one.
