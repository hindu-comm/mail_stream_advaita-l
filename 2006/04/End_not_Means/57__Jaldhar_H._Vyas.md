The bottom line is that Advaita Vedanta is a body of knowledge with
history, doctrines, heresies, controversies and options.  In other words
it should be treated just like any other field of knowledge that you want
to learn. The only difference between it and lawnmower repair or table
tennis is that the result of knowing it is transcendant rather than
immediate. (Though I admit that's quite a big difference.)

Speaking with my moderator hat on I don't think I would want to stop you
from writing that sort of thing.  But speaking with my contributor hat on
I probably would not respond much.  That's not using the power of the
internet to its potential in my opinion.
