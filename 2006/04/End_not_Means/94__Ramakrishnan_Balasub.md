No. Pretty much every hindu group guarantees that moxa is available
irrespective of access to veda *recitation*.

I suggest that everyone re-read the post Vidyasankar mailed within the
last month on the distinction between the parama-pursuShaartha, namely
mokshha, and social reform with respect to veda *recitation*
tradition. The two are mutually orthogonal in some senses.
