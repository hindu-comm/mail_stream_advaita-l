ofcourse the dhArmic standing of an action cannot be derived from
pratyakSa because dharma is defined by the scriptural canon. But this
dharma itself is open to questioning, that is where pratyakSa comes
in. Where did the scriptures come from?

I shall attempt to show you how the scientific method can be (and is)
applied to come up with appropriate action-reaction schema.

Do a thought experiment. You reward the murderer with money. Put
yourself in the murderer's situation. A large sum of money would do
you good. so you extrapolate that the large sum of money would do the
murderer good, and so the murderer would be motivated to commit the
crime again. But letting and encouraging a murderer to commit murder
isn't really good because he could in principle some day kill you. so
you decide on option B instead, which through a similar thought
experiment is shown to discourages the crime. So through thought
experiment you have reduced the problem of what should be done in the
above case to what should be done to ensure basic self-preservation
for yourself and others. Self preservation is something ingrained
through evolution, not through scriptures alone (although they do
encode this pratyakSa knowledge).

Aum :-)

yes I am, and I never said making a moral judgement is wrong. But the
basis of morality (pertaining to AcharaN) is ultimately based in
pratyakSa (which happens to be encoded in the scriptures also).
