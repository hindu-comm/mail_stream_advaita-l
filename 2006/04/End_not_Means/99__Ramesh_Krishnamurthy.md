If my statements offended anyone, I unreservedly apologize.

In fact, I apologize to Jaldhar too if my statements offended him,
though I dont think they did.

I sincerely respect Jaldhar for his efforts at understanding the
tradition even while living in a foreign land. What I find problematic
is his bitter opposition to any kind of reinterpretation or reform,
which I believe is because he views the tradition from afar. Please
read through the archives and see the difference between his posts and
those of Vidyasankar, Ramakrishnan or Sanjay Srivastava and you will
see the difference in tone.
