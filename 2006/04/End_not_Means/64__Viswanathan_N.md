If some one says J.Krishnamurthy is not advaitin,I really dont know what to say!!!  Sure he has not claimed to be , but dont go by mere definitions (not by letter but look by spirit ). He may not be proclaimed advaitin , but certainly a 'non-dualist'.  why, even for that matter, I would call  OSHO as authentic Advaitin compared so many of swamijis. (Just read his book on Bhaj Govindam, no one can ever give better commentry on that great work of Adishankara)

As Amuthan pointed out it was a solved question until some latecomers
tried to unsolve it again.

For the monkey, to use Sanjays example, who is only imitating without
understanding, everything seems like a burden and a chore. The answer is
don't be a monkey! To a child, it seems really unjust to be doing
homework when one could be playing outside in the sunshine. Yet the
parents insist on it no matter how much whining or arguing. Because they
know in the long run it is for the childs own good. And when that child
grows up he realizes they were right. The curse of India is so many of
its people seem to prefer to remain monkeys/children.

Manish, do you or have you ever actually lived in the West? Because
writing from New York, the notion that the people here are in any less
bondage or thinking whatever they want is laughable. They have different
types of bondage that's all.

What good is being in a notionless state if 10 minutes later you are back
in front of the TV or at the job, or doing the laundry again? If you
really want that notionless state, by all means take sannyasa and renounce
everything. If you only give up your religious duties while remaining
enmeshed in all other notions you are delusional not notionless.

...he wasn't an Advaitin.
