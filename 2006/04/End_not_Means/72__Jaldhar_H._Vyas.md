It is an open-and-shut case.  The problem is some people are arguing a 
different case.  There is also no need for debate when we can't agree
what we're debating!  In any case, the point Manish was making was 
adressed in the very first reply.  I don't feel the need to restate it 
when there are other more interesting topics to discuss.
