A typical society only has one policeman for every few thousand citizens. 
Pratyaksha shows it is very easy to commit a crime without being caught. 
Yet civilization hasn't disintegrated into an orgy of muder, rape, and 
theft.  Why?  Because the "still small voice" of which poets speak is a 
more powerful motivator of behavior than a crude fear of punishment.

This is fine in theory but it doesn't match reality.  In real life, no one 
approaches ethics in a vacuum.  We all have been brought up in ways which 
influence our behavior.  It has to be that way because unlike some animals 
who are equipped for life and independent within a few hours of being 
born, humans require many years of interaction with other humans before 
they can survive on their own.

So the skeptical position, no matter how useful it is (and I agree that it 
is) is ultimately a pose.  This is why for all their good intentions, I 
think people who rely on a skeptical approach to the "why" of religion, 
end up with weakened faith.  They are a substituting a new set of 
assumtions and claims not clarifying the old ones.

It is saying women have no adhikara to learn Vedas.

Really?  What is the SI unit of Adhikara?

It is also important in the design of an experiment to know exactly what 
you are trying to measure.  "effect on society" is too broad and vague. 
There are some historical examples I think are relevant.  For instance, 
Modern Hinduism is said to begin with Ramamohan Roy whose Brahmo Samaj 
scandalized Calcutta society at its inaugural meeting by: having a woman 
read from the upanishads.  Where is the Brahmo Samaj now?  The Arya Samaj 
also made a tenet out this issue.  How successful has the Arya Samaj been? 
But to point this out also relies on some assumptions on my part.

If you could measure how many Vedic-studying women got mukti as opposed to 
a control group that studied e.g. Ramayana then I suppose that would be 
more definitive.  And you would get a Nobel prize for sure :-)

But there's the rub.  Astikas don't accept these assumptions.  So we are 
back to square 1.
