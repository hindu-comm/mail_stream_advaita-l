1.  All humans organize into societies

I think we agree on that one but

2.  All societies have more concepts than just the bare essentials.

and I agree that it is _necessary_ that it is so.  Ethical values must be
wrapped up in myths, rituals, power relations etc. in order to propogate
through generations.

There are certain themes in civilization(e.g. the "Golden rule" and I
might add role specialization by gender) that pop up all over the place
and yet there is a hell of a difference between the Eskimos in Greenland
or hunters in the jungles of Africa and Vedic Dharma.

In any case the point I want to make is that human behavior cannot be
reduced to simple stimulus-response (fear of punishment etc.)

Oh I'm in favor of more than a hint.  But it should be borne in mind that
all systems of belief (including non-religious ones) boil down to
assumptions taken on faith.  I personally am skeptical that gender
neutrality is a viable proposition over time yet people continue to
believe it.

And what will be your criteria for attainment of mukti?  Where is mukti
defined?

I hope you now see that in fact the experiment is impossible.

No I do not.  Both are statements for which only the Vedas are pramana.
