The books you're reading are fine, especially those by Ramana
Maharshi are the best in the tradition that are easily accessible to
Westerners.

Ramana Maharshi had several devotees/disciples from the West,
including Paul Brunton, Arthur Osborne, S.S. Cohen, etc. all of whom
have written books about RM that you can find in most Hindu
bookstores. Some books are:

"Guru Ramana", By S.S.Cohen.

"Glimpses of the Life & Teaching of Sri Ramana Maharshi", By Frank
Humphreys.

"My Life and Quest", By Arthur Osborne.

"A search in secret India", by Paul Brunton.

Yes, according to the advaita tradition, the Self is not something
that is conscious, but is consciousness itself.
