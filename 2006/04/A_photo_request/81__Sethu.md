We are looking for a large photo of Sri Shankaracharya with five disciples
for the Jayanthi pooja at our temple here in Northern California
(www.livermoretemple.org). If anybody in the area is able to give/ loan one,
please get in touch with me ASAP - Tel: 925-216-5757. Or email me a fairly
good size jpeg file (12"x16" @ 200dpi) and I will print it out -
facestudio at hotmail.com

Many thanks in anticipation. Sincerely.



Sethuraman.
