Namaste,

Also:

1. name rAma is derived from ram, the agni bIja. He
   who has "worn", "assumed" the ram bIja is rAma.
   (in hindi: "ram bIja dhAraNa karane vAlA rAma")

2. dasharatha - one who reins the 10 senses - the mind
   that controls the senses (as opposed to a mind 
   that is controlled by the senses). rAma is 
   dasharatha Atmaja (born of the self of such a 
   controlled mind).

3. single name rAma is equal to the entire 
   sahasranAma of vishnu.

Regards,
Shrinivas
