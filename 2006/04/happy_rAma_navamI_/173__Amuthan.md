yes, that's the most beautiful part of it. had it not
been for mahAtmAs like ramaNa maharShi, it would have
been very difficult to appreciate verses such as

'chaturvidhA bhajante mAM..... ** j~nAnI cha **
bharatarShabha'  

'AtmArAmAshcha munayo nirgranthA apyurukrame.
 kurvantyahaitukIM bhaktimitthaM bhUtaguNo hariH..' 
etc... 

for j~nAnIs, there is no real distinction between
bhakti and j~nAna. it is only in j~nAnIs that we can
find pure bhakti. similarly, those who do niShkAma
bhakti automatically get j~nAna. 

i never knew that akSharamanamAlai was written in
nAyaka-nAyakI bhAva. unfortunately, i haven't tasted
that work yet and i'll do that asap. thanks * a lot *
for providing the necessary motivation even if that
wasn't your intention :)

vAsudevaH sarvaM,
aparyAptAmRtaH.
