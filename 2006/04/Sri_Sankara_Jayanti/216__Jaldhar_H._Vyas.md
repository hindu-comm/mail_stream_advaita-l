As other posters have mentioned, Shankaracharya Jayanti is Vaishakha 
Shukla 5, i.e. May 2.  May 13, is Vaishakha Purnima.

As for the most important date, I would say that would be Ashadha Purnima 
or as it is more popularly known, Guru Purnima (July 11 this year.)  On 
Guru Purnima, we pay our respects to the entire Guru Parampara from 
Shriman Narayana, including Shankaracharya, up to the present day.
