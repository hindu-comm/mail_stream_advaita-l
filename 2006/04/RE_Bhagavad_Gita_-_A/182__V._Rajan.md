I would not categorize Prabhupad's philosophy as Dvaita, it is
basically a weird mix on Christianity and Hinduism, that said the BG
from there is rather biased. If you go to think we can see lot of
parallels between ISKCON and Christianity and I think the Sankara
supersite at iit K is a better source.
