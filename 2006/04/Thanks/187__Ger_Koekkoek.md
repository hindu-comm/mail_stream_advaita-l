Thanks to you all.
You gave me a lot of very serious, deep and even caring answers.
You answered me in such a wide range of different ways of thinking within our subject, and this all in such a well said way that I had to write a book to answer you all in a proper way. 
I go to print it all out, and slowly reply so here and there, on this or that. 
Some of your replies really did help me a bit,
So again, sincerely, thanks.

With greetings,
Ger
