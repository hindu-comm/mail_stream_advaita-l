 Rather than  seeing Brahman as  the third person siiting somewhere and comming down when dharma is on decline,   we shold take in this way....... 

    "The all pervading consciouness (Brahman) manifests itself in requiered form to correct imbalance and reinforce the balance in the existance".

  Here by balance  I mean balence between Dharma & Adharma. In my opinion those two are also relative and not absolute and thats why I used 'balance'.

Whenever Dharma is on the decline O Bharata! [Arjuna]
And Adharma begins to increase, I project myself [into this world]

To protect the good and destroy evildoers,
To establish Dharma, I am born in every age.

Krshna Bhagavan _is_ Brahman. Brahman is not outside the universe but 
pervades it from the insentient rocks and oceans to the most divine and 
realized beings.

It is Brahman who underlies the creation of the visible universe, it is 
Brahman who cause its end and in between it is Brahman who maintains its 
state. This happens over and over again.

But it is the nature of Brahmans power of maya to conceal and disguise the 
natural shape and the rhythm of the universe. Brahmans avataras keep that 
maya in check. It is like in the human body; organs like e.g. the thyroid 
perform vital tasks to keep you alive but if they are overactive, it can 
be a danger to your life. So you have regulatory hormones to keep 
everything at the appropriate level. In the same way Dharma goes up and 
down at times but Avataras keep them overall at the appropriate levels.
