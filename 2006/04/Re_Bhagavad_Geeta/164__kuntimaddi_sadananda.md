Shree Ram Garib - thanks for the enquiry.  Actually it is the collection
of the discussion I have been having in advaitin list since its
inseption and in advaitaL before that.  Someone has compiled all these
and during the past 6 months I have been spending time to reorgnize it
subject-wise, and now looking for a publisher. It is nealy 600+ pages. 
Ones a publisher is fixed, it will depend on them to release it on line.
 That may be what many publishers are doing now-a-days anyway. I will
definitely let you know.  

Hari OM!
Sadananda
