Namaste,

The following parable from "Edifying Parables" of the Jivanmukta former
Jagadguru Abhinava Vidyateertha Mahaswamiji may be of use here:

A sannyAsi was not observing any regulations with regard to food and
spiritual practices. A householder approached him and asked, "You do not
seem to be observing any regulations whatsoever. You eat as you wish, spend
your time loitering and do acts that are unbecoming of a sannyAsi. Is it
proper for you to be like this? The sannyAsi replied "Everything is brahman.
The body and mind perform actions whereas I am the pure concious Atma which
is unstained. As such, it matters little to me what the body and mind do.
Indeed everything is brahman."

The householder queried, "Will you come to my house for bhikSha?"  "Yes",
replied the sannyAsi. "I have no objections. To me, who revels in the Atma,
nothing matters. I shall come." That afternoon, the sannyAsi went to the
householder's place and sat down to have a meal. However, his host did not
offer him even a drop of water. As minutes passed, he became restless. His
host deliberately ignored his uneasiness. Finally, unable to withstand the
delay any longer, he shouted, "What do you mean by keeping me waiting? I am
quite hungry. Serve me fast."

The householder came up to him and said, "I fail to  realise how hunger and
thirst could arise in you who are totally immersed in the bliss of the Atma.
You are all-pervasive, for such is the nature of the Atma. I am unble to
offer you water for, being omnipresent, you already pervade it from within
and without." The sannyAsi got up saying,"Do not speak like that. I am
unable to bear my hunger." He then left in search of food.

The sannyAsi lacked self-control and dispassion. Hence he did not adhere to
the rules meant for unenlightened mendicants. He misused advaita philosophy
merely to explain away his misconduct. His unrestrained behaviour fetched
him much sin; his advaitic declarations offered him no protection from
demerits.
Regards,
Abhishek
