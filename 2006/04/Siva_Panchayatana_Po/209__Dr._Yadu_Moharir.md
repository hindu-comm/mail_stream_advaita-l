Nmaste Krishan-Ji:

  Welcome to the group.

  Can you please enlighten us on "Siva Panchayatana Pooja" ?

  How does this differ from the conventional "pa~ncaayatana pUja" and it's significance ?

  Thank you,

  Dr. Yadu

We belong to Taittiriya Sakha of Krishna Yajur Veda. At home,
we have Siva Panchayatana Pooja. For many years, we are performing
(Taittirita Aranyaka Pratama Prsna based) Surya Namskaram every
Sunday.
