[forgot to post this yesterday.  Sorry. --Jaldhar]

Namaste,

My spiritual musings started on a serious note when I got out of my
undergrad studies and joined a company in Hyderabad. It's here that I
found time to stay alone which initiated a lot of questions about the self
and of the nature around me. I was also fortunate to find my friend's
family adopt me as their daughter and care for me. It was wonderful to
meet these people since it was a lot of spiritual talk. I've been at it
since then and have been a reader of this website. I don't know what is it
that is really compelling me to join the mailing list too. But I'm just
exploring where this would lead me from here.

Currently I work as a Software Engineer with UGS in the US. I'm 27 and
love to muse on the working of the mind.

Hope to gain more understanding of myself from this mailing list.
Regards,
Rashmy
