I think that mAyA, the illusion of duality itself, is witness to the
profound simplicity of brahman, the Oneness. I think a prerequisite to
brahman-consciousness is being conscious of the richness of the
illusion itself. To feel Oneness, one has to first understand the
existence of the illusion of many-ness. I was saying previously that
upon realization some mAyA gets destroyed. I think I was wrong. It is
only through mAyA that we reach the beyond-mAyA. There is no shortcut
to the process.

The temporary nature of things can be known and felt through observing
them directly. Thus by observing mAyA we observe its internal
temporality. But mAyA as a whole itself may not be a "temporary"
phenomenon. It seems that brahman consciousness is simply the highest
level of consciousness. In it, what we call mAyA does not "vanish" or
get "annhilated", one simply comes to know the underlying substratum
of mAyA, which is brahman. mAyA is said to be unreal because it is
simply not the final substrate. There is a monist substrate that
inherently implies the temporality of any event in mAyA.

For example, observing that the bright side of the moon is of
different shapes when observed by us at different times is not FALSE
per se. It is just a limited perspective. When we come to realize the
mechanics of planetary motion, we realize the underlying principle
(substrate) of the mAyA of the shape-changing moon. So to observe and
realize that our current perspective is limited, we have to observe
and correct our perception itself. This is the basic principle behind
j~nAna yoga, as well as the scientific method.

I think that although in the "final leap" it is the mind that is
destroyed (because that is the final "thing" whose substratum has to
be known), the mind is an indispensible tool in reaching the edge of
the cliff. When j~nAna yoga is finally applied to the instrument of
j~nAna yoga itself, the instrument is destroyed and the j~nAna alone
is left. But to get the mind to destroy itself we have to hone the
mind to learn to destroy other "limited perspectives". When the mind
is practiced enough, then it is inevitable, the mind because of its
conscience, has to apply its own method of j~nAna on itself.

While I agree that our thoughts CAN lead us astray, I think without
the discipline of observing our thoughts and channelling them, finding
their underlying substratum and their own temporality is extremely
hard if not impossible.
