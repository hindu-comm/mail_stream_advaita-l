It is interesting to think about today's date April 1 - Fool's day... 
  Well mAya is this initial fooling around that itself tries to bring its own destruction; for there in it is its own liberation....lower nature has to die to shine forth the true nature...
        It can be found at many places that this mAyavAda and advaitavAda have been considered the same....needless to say...it is this so called mAyA's job to destroy the self-oblivion and bring forth the sun of self-consciousness....
       It is how it is...to catch hold of it is like trying to hold sand in one's hands and the harder you try the more it slips....
               Ger, I appreciate your efforts to bring forth your thoughts with such wisdom....I saw that you have done full justice to the concept of mAya...It is a great understanding to see the gods and all else that is in this world of appearance as mere mental illusions or delusions or some tricks of mAya...as it becomes at the higher stages of mental evolution..or mental destruction or breaking of mental illusions...and the culmination of this mental mAya is its own extinction...which is very natural if the effort is there...
          Adityaji....things can be seen in any way..for till mind keeps thinking in its set patterns or notions it won't be said to be out of bondages....
         regarding mAya, then it is the one who tries to break the illusion of snake in rope... it is mAya itself which is here snake..and then after making self conscious ....there it shows the rope... when that is there Brahman consciousness has been developed.... 
             Regarding thoughts then the greatest conquerer is the conqueror of mind as they say...the equanimity of mind  and (also thoughtless state) has been considered always the highest state....staying in it firmly is extinction of the world outside..or the extinction of mAya.....(then whatever falls on the mind is like drops that fall but don't affect it...)
  for it has been established).....practice is the greatest reward in itself...
  experiencing it is sweetness and pleasure of highest kind...the spiritual blessing...
  what else...PLAY remains...then be a part....(then walking remains, then that shouldst continue.....)
                Vishwanathanji, Thanks a lot for Ashtavakra Gita verses.
