Rope-snake example.

I am grateful to Shri Jayanarayanan who has pointed out the other upanishads
in which the rope-snake example is mentioned.

The translation of the sentence from nirAlambopanishad is: "Like the
delusion of a snake on a rope, the delusion of gods, human beings, other
creatures, plants and trees, male, female, castes and Ashramas, the limiting
adjuncts of bondage and liberation, and various other differences on Brahman
which is non-dual, all-pervading and is itself everything, is avidya".
