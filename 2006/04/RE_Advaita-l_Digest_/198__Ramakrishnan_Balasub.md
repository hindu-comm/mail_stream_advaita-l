That's a pretty accurate summary, and written well. As for Osho =
advaita, I guess it's time for that ugly monster to rear its head once
again :-). There's no need to equate anyone who speaks mystical
mumbo-jumbo with advaita. Clearly, advaita != mystical mumbo jumbo.
There are many people floating around claiming to teachers of
"advaita". Why, I even came across a web-page where people can submit
their names and be listed as teachers of "contemporary" advaita. You
can even submit your "writings" and the kind of balderdash you can
find there is absolutely amazing. The point is that these people want
the stamp of a tradition on them, which enables them to part the
gullible from their money more easily. I guess some people think that
any nonsense that appeals to them is Ok, especially if it is supposed
to have been sanctioned by a 3000 year tradition (which includes
Ramana Maharshi of course!). But they are too lazy and/or hedonistic
to actually get schooled in and follow the tradition of advaita. It's
a massive con-job, no less. Some notable exceptions are genuine
advaitins like A.J.Alston and Trevor Leggett.
