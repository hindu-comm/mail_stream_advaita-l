Namaste Sri Ramakrishnan,

Great to see a post from you. I have read many of your posts in the
archives and must say they have amazing clarity. Do you still live in
the US?

Anybody here heard of a person named Andrew Cohen? I think he is a
"grand-disciple" of Ramana Maharshi. It is not clear what his present
views are. But I came across the link below which includes an
interview with Sw. Dayananda Saraswati of Arshavidya Gurukulam in
1998.

He clearly misinterprets the traditional position and even makes a
factual error - he says that the Shankaraacharya-s do not recognize
RM's enlightenment. From various posts in the archives (incl some by
Sri Ramakrishnan) we know that the acharya-s of Sringeri, Kanchi and
Puri have clearly acknowledged RM's enlightenment. The acharya-s
generally dont bother to comment about this or that guru. In RM's case
they have quite explicitly acknowledged him.

IMO, the differentiation that Sw. Dayananda Saraswati makes between
the mystic and the Vedaantin is admirable. He does not criticize
mysticism anywhere (the Vedaantin can be a mystic too), but clearly
brings out the point that the Vedaanta is a systematic teaching
methodology. Cohen has a problem with this, but he also has a problem
when Swamiji says that there might be many unknown people in India who
are enlightened!! Does he want Swamiji to recognize the "mysticism" of
new-agers only?

I have no problem with the new-agers but they shouldnt call their
teaching Advaita if they dont want to follow the tradition. Worse,
they are misinterpreting it and making it sound like some bookish
tradition. All the emphasis on morality and chitta shuddhi is
forgotten.
