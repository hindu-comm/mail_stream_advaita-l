By "Adi Sankara Avataram", do you mean the chapter in the maadhaviiya
shankara vijayam detailing his birth? If so, you can obtain a copy of
the shankara vijayam, along with the Tamil translation, from Sringeri
Mutt Publications. I have given details of this book in the list
before. You can search the archives for that. As far as I am aware,
this book (or any parts of it) is not available on the web.
