I have given some arguments only to clarify a viewpoint. In case I
have offended list sentiments, I'm sorry, and please let me know.

You appear to be saying that good = something that gives pleasure or
that which helps preseve one's body. etc.

This is called the "utilitarian theory of ethics", and is indeed the
most common worldly view.

According to this view:

1) Free Fornication is a good thing.

2) Eating dead bodies as they are a source of vitamins, minerals and
proteins is a good thing.

3) But studying the Vedas does not result in any directly perceptible
utility and is therefore "useless".


So when you promote the study of the Vedas to women, be sure to tell
them that, "According to my view, there is no problem with women
studying Vedas. But also according to my view, there is no use of
anyone studying the Vedas. Besides, free fornication and controlled
cannibalism are good things."


Good luck with that! If the women who're interested in studying the
Vedas are of the mindset that I think they have, they will run away
from your view!
