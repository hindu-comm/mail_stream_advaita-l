Dear fellow-seekers,

Om Namah Pranavarthaya,
Shuddha gnanaika murthaye, 
Nirmalaya Prashanthaya,
Dakshina murthaye namaha

Quote "
Shruti is a seperate pramana precisely because its injunctions and
prohibitions are _not_ amenable to outside perception or inference.  The claim is being made that women should not recite not because they are frail or mentally deficient but simply because they can't.  No further explanation is needed because shruti is its own authority.
"

Would be greatful if anyone clarifies these doubts regarding "Shruthi is a separate Pramana ". The usage of the word _not_ conveys the meaning that "This is someone's personal belief system" and "not universal". 
If anyone is objective about a fact(in terms of a "yes" or "No", there should be atleast a few counter-arguments to the same, which according to me would convince all "doubting thomases", the validity of the _not_. Preferably,
1) The actual injunction in the scripture
2) The actual words of a living - enlightened master (not somebody who'se words are quoted,(since quotes are subject to the problem of misinterpretation)
3) Direct experience of the individual.

In this mail, would try to implore 1) and 3) here, since my master has already given an answer to this query...ie. 2) is already done.

In mathematics, A Pramana could be equated to a Theory(or a corollary) and it defenitely needs proof, comprehensible by the human mind-intellect.

Would be good to hear from anyone in this group, who has through direct experience learnt that the Vedas shouldn't be recited because of one's gender in fact if there is a woman who says, she has had problems  after chanting the vedas, it would be great concurrence to this view. 
Are there modern/ancient medical researchers who have concurred to this view. Like I mentioned earlier, today's enlightened masters(Mata Amritanandamayi) has women priests in their temples, who chant and do all the rituals necessary for prayer. 
Will they have problems in future?

Does this cause any problems in the female body-mind-intellect, if not does this bring out bad-luck to the person who chanted it????? What happens........... What happens..........

In fact, would be grateful to anyone who could help me out here. Is there an online version of the Shruthi, or if you could give me a pointer to any of the publications, that have the verse that quotes "Women should not recite the Vedas", it would greatly add to my knowledge...

With my limited knowledge and time, have managed to read a few of the works of ancient literature(except the shruthi's, smrithis, puranas or the Vedas).

Everything stated in most of the other scriptures, be it the Yoga Sutras, or Gita, or Ashtavakra, Narada's Bhakti sutras, Yoga Vasishta, Tripura Rahasya, are mostly experiential knowledge, where the ancient scientists(rishis) have experimented over ages and brought this knowledge over to mankind.The modern epics notably "The gospel of Sri Ramakrishna", "The Divine Play of Sri Ramakrishna", "On the path to Freedom- Swami Paramatmananda" dont talk about such limitations. 

In fact, any person willing to experience them could infact use these works of literature, as a guide(ofcourse under the right circumstances, which could include, the presence of a master).
