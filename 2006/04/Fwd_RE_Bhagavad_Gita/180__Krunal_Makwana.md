namo nArAyana,

Dear All,

The 'bhagavad gItA as it is' is totally against Advaita Vedanta and Sri SaMkara, and having studied SaMkara, rAmAnuja, madhUSudan saraswatI and prabhupAda, prabhupAdas translation and commentary is totally unorthodox to the other views. 

Although rAmAnuja is against AV he still does not try to manipulate the scriptures but tries to remain faithful to the scripture and the saMskr^it language.

Forget his commentary (prabhupAda) but he pops the phrase 'the supreme personality of godhead' from thin air, lol!

No disrespect to the other philosophies but stick to either Sri SaMkara or Madhusudana bhASya.

Krunal
