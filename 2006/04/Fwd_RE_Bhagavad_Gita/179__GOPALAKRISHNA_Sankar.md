Dear members,

I also support this.
Being advaithee forum, please try to pass on the information that are having Pramanas and followed by the sishtacharas.

This is my view not to hurt to anybody (No personal emotions)

With Humble pranams
Gopal

  The bhagwadgeetha you mentioed by shri.AC Prabhupadha is totally dwaitic and biased against Advaithic.
