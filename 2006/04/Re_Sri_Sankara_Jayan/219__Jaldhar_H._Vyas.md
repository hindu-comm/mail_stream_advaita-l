They haven't read their own site.  There is an article on Shankara Jayanti 
by Swami Shivananda at

http://www.divyajivan.org/articles/siva/shankara Jayanti.htm

The last few lines of it say:

   Shankara Jayanthi falls on the 5th day of the bright half of Vaisakh
   (May-June). On this day, study his works, pray and meditate. May you be
   showered with his blessings!
