Well, the answer on this all is in the hands of the one woman who joined 
this forum.
Did you read anything that helped you?
And what is your opinion on this all?
Are you still there?
With greetings,
Ger

I am afraid we are mixing up here advaita vedanta and mysticism. In advaita
vedanta self-knowledge comes from "shastra-yonitvat." Looking inwards is a
part of nididhyasana, but not sufficient by itself. In fact, a distinct
trend is to consider shravana as the angi, and manana and nididhyasana as
anga-s. Accordingly, listening to scriptures from a qualified teacher is the
principal discipline in advaita, and manana and nididhyasana are helpful
aids.

Developing an understanding of advaita has nothing to do with the learning
of veda-s. One is for moksha and the other for dharma. For advaitic
knowledge, we have numerous examples of sages who never learnt veda-s
and numerous examples of vedic pundits who remain ignorant as ever. Confuse
the two, and you start seeing contradictions in women advaita teachers and
not learning of veda-s.

In that case, you have to specify "wrong" in what sense. If you say "wrong"
in the sense of "being less egalitarian", I am entirely with you. Vedic
tradition is definitely not one of the shining examples of egalitarianism.

However, may I suggest that egalitarianism may not be a relevant issue here.
An spiritual tradition should be judged by its effectiveness or otherwise in
ensuring spiritual evolution of its members. It can be called "wrong", only
if it has failed in this objective. If someone has some data to prove that
caste or gender based restrictions on eligibility of certain texts, have
actually harmed the spiritual evolution of that gender or caste, then I am
all against such restrictions. But is that what we are arguing here? If
you believe that in dharma, egalitarian approach is "right" and caste or
gender based differences are "wrong", then you have to prove your argument
on basis of actual results of spiritual good rather than its conformance to
some concept which you think should be considered better.
