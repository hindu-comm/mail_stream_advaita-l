Here are some short responses to a couple of posts.

I'm afraid wishing thaat something was true doesn't make it so.

Good.  Tomorrow I won't go to work. I'll send my daughter instead.  And if 
she complains that she is only 4 I'll tell that its just a state of mind.

Well I consider myself to be modern (and a thinker even :-) and that's 
precisely what I'm saying.  But is what I mean by "fit" the same as what 
you mean?

pratyaksha is no foundation for a system of ethics.  If while I'm walking 
I perceive that someones wallet is sticking out of his pocket and I can 
steal it without him or the police or anyone else noticing does it now 
become an acceptable thing to do?

Shruti is a seperate pramana precisely because its injunctions and
prohibitions are _not_ amenable to outside perception or inference.  The
claim is being made that women should not recite not because they are
frail or mentally deficient but simply because they can't.  No further
explanation is needed because shruti is its own authority.

No argument from me there.  But the same also applies to would-be 
reformers too.  Unfortunately too many of them are less than honest in 
their interpretations.  As an aside, a big reason I am so orthodox today 
is because of my perception that "modern" Hindus are largely fools and 
knaves.

Um I'm not sure Gargi was a Rshi however it is true that of the 400+ Rshis 
of the Rgveda, there are about 20 or so with arguably feminine names. 
Even if taken at face value (and it need not be.  Read on.) that's a 
whopping 4%.  Hardly an endorsement of equality.

But does that mean she was taught the Vedas or taught Brahmavidya?  Those 
are not the same thing especially from the Advaita point of view.

Also what evidence do we have that Maitreyi or Yajnavalkya actually 
existed?  Yes we believe they did but from the Mimamsaka perspective it is 
also quite possible they are just literary characters.  The Mimamsakas 
went to great length to deny personality to the Rshis precisely to avoid 
this kind of second-guessing.

If it is unecessary why would she even want it and why would anyone bother 
to give it in that case?  Initiation is a means to an end not an end in 
itself.  If the result has been acheived, it is no longer relevant.  This 
is the precise reason why Sannyasis in the Advaita traditions give up the 
yajnopavita (the symbol of Vedic initiation) etc.  It is not that they are 
against it, but if they are no longer in the sphere were Vedic commands 
hold true, what is the point?

So to be fair, their are puranas, itihasa, Gita, Yogavasishtha etc. by 
which one can know.  Which in fact are more well known than the Vedas. 
There are also innumerable people who will tell you.  So where is the 
unfairness.

You have inadvertently revealed the hidden sexism that underlies a lot of 
the "women should learn the vedas" talk.  Why is reciting adityahrdaya or 
sahasranamas not evidence of keenness or seriousness?  What about women 
who don't know Sanskrit at all but recite e.g. sundara kanda?  Are they 
too to be deemed not serious.  Why should a woman have to copy a man for 
brahmajijnasa?  Especially when we Advaitins believe karma and jnana are 
as seperate as the north and south pole?

My wife who is an educated woman is also probably quite capable of 
reciting having heard me or others countless times.  My children also like 
to play puja and in the process they repeat what they hear.  This is 
inevitable unless you lock yourself into an airtight soundproof box when 
you pray.  But as children grow in understanding and mature into adults 
they should be taught what is right and wrong.  My 16 month old son 
doesn't mind taking off all his clothes and running around the house 
screaming.  I don't  condemn him for it.  But if he is still doing that at 
35, you bet I will!

Incidently, the story of Satyakama does not prove what people think it 
proves.

You know that bit about murder being bad?  Well based on debate I have 
decided it no longer fits in with the times so as of...um...April 15, 
readers may feel free to kill anyone they like without burdening their 
conscience.

Remember, the source of authority in Advaita Vedanta is not only texts (a 
superset of "books") but also shistachara.  A proper analysis includes 
history and anthropology as well.

This shades into a)  A person has authority only if he is familiar with 
texts and tradition.  Texts and traditions get chosen because of their use 
by authoritative
