agreed.

I don't know, you tell me what you mean by "fit". When I say "unfit" I
mean that their brains with all the neurons and the structure is
incapable of comprehending the Vedas like males can comprehend.

You are restricting the circumference of pratyaksha too much. Ever
heard of the brain being able to derive subtler concepts from simple
concepts? The danD nIti of nature is enough to infuse ethics into the
mind. When you refrain from a "bad" action in a particular case where
your action would be undetectable, it is a result of pattern matching
in the brain, not because you remember some verse from some Veda. Do
you imply that irreligious people are more often inethical than
religious people? if so, unfortunate misconception. if not, please
clarify.

Calling a spade a spade by showing that Shruti says something specific
is one thing. But stopping there and not asking why is quite
unacceptable, atleast when there is a pratyaksha doubt. But you HAVE
addressed that question later in your mail to some extent.

My turn to ask you how you define "fool" and "knave" in this context.
Just curious.

Aren't the Upanishads Shruti? What does it matter whether the
characters existed or not?

perfectly fine.

are there any scriptures as general as the Vedas that are prohibited
for men to recite? If yes, fine. If not, then again, asking the
question WHY is can bear some fruit.

I think you have missed the point. Ofcourse reciting these scriptures
is not anything "lesser". The question boils back to whether men have
such restrictions in the tradition. Ofcourse here I am refering to the
hypothetical you that you have concocted in the above argument.

Incidentally, your stating that you think you know what people think
it proves does not show that you really know what people think it
proves. maybe you can elaborate at your convenience.

I challenge you to show me the proceedings of such a debate. I claim
that I will be able to show that your "decision" is either based on
incorrect premises, or your idea of "murder" is different from the
idea that a majority of humanity has.

These sources of authority overlap in their jurisdiction. The history
and anthropology you allude to are forms of pratyaksha pramANa.
