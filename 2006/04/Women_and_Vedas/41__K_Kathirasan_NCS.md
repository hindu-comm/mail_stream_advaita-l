Namaste Jaldharji,

You mentioned: 

"Shruti is a seperate pramana precisely because its injunctions and
prohibitions are _not_ amenable to outside perception or inference.  The
claim is being made that women should not recite not because they are
frail or mentally deficient but simply because they can't.  No further
explanation is needed because shruti is its own authority."

Do you have explicit references from shruti of such prohibitions?
Thanks.
