I think this view most accurately represents the mainstream Advaita

Not to mention it is actually far more condescending to people it is
trying to help.

What I don't get (I'm not being glib here, I really don't.) is why they
would want to do so?  Yes, I'm sure there is an intellectual fascination
for some but the ones who are interested for religious reasons?  In my
previous conversations all I have been able to gather is that they somehow
feel it will make them more "spiritual."  But personally when I think of
the people I admire for their spirituality (or don't as the case may be) I
have never felt that how much they new about Vedas was relevant.
