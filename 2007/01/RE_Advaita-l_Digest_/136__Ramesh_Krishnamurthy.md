Apart from Maharshi Yajnavalkya, I think Ramana Maharshi is a great
example of this in recent times.

For that matter, it is not clear whether Sankara took "formal"
sannyasa at any time. It is possible that his guru initiated him when
the two met on the banks of the Narmada, but Sankara had already
renounced the world by then.
