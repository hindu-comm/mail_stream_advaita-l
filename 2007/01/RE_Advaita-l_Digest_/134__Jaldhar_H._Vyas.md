It's not quite so clear cut.  There are some dharmashastras that suggest 
it or that only dvijas can.  There are others that say anyone can. 
Within the Advaita sampradayas there are orders of sannyasis who 
subscribe to each of these theories.

If the vidya that sannyasis seek is truly ever present and all-pervasive 
and only veiled by Maya then there will always be some way for a person to 
renounce avidya even if it isn't the particular way they imagined.
