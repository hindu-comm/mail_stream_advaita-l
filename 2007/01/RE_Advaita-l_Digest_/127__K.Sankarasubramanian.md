I have a query to pose to the learned members here.. Is there any
compulsion in the sastras for everyone to get into Sannyasa Ashrama ?
Can we not get Moksha without going through the Sannyasa Ashrama ? If
Sannyasa Ashrama is a compulsion, what about ladies ? Pl let me know if
there is any such Sannyasa Ashrama for ladies.
