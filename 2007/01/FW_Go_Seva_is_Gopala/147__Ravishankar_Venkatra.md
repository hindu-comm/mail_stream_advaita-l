Friends,

I am forwarding a message from another list where I am a member. When you 
read the message below, you would be able to appreciate what is being done 
to protect cows in America especially. It is a small start, but with more 
help from others, it has a huge potential to become as a lifestyle for many. 
Please help by passing this among your friends.

I talked to Sri. Sankar Sastri, when he gave me additional information about 
the project.

It costs $45 a month to raise a cow. $1 buys 10 pounds of feed for the cows. 
Any money big or small could be used by him.

He is also looking for someone to help him in his chores. The person will 
get free accommodation, free vegetarian food and also $500 per month.

Thanks,
Ravi
