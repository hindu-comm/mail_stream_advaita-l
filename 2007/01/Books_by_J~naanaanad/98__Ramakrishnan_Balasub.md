In the past we had a discussion (??) about JBS/Krishnaswamy Iyer, and
I provided a list of books I have or have read before. Please search
through the archives for that. A good news for admirers of JBS. Some
of his old books have been republished. Note that he has written over
100 books.

The ones I obtained recently (all in Tamizh) are:

1. Srimad Aachaaryendra Vaibhavam - A condensed biography of Sri
Saccidaananda Sivaabhinava Narasimha Bhaarati Mahaasvaaminah
2. Sri Guru-krupaa-vilaasam - 3 volumes - on Sri Candrashekhara
Bhaarati Mahaasvaaminah - some parts of the books seem to have been
published in English (Sparks froma divine anvil, etc), when I flipped
through these. But this is comprehensive and has more material.
3. Sri Ramananda Caritam - Biography of JBS's father, who also became
a sannyaasi in later life.

All books are available from:

Sri Candrashekhara Bharati Brahmavidya Trust
