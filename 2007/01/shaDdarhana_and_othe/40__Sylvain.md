As an Occidental, I am quite sure that advaita is slowly being discovered 
and appreciated in Occident.

- Meister Eckhart (1260-1328) a christian who is not recognized by the 
christian religious institutions was very close with the advaita point of 
view.  He is (only today!) being translated in modern German, English, 
French and certainly other languages.

- Arnaud Desjardins, still among us, greatly contributed to present advaita 
in French speaking world.  I think he was the first westerner to film MA 
AnandamayI.

- Many westerners are discovering advaita nowadays because they realise 
advaita is « open », « tolerant ».

I see a great future for advaita.
