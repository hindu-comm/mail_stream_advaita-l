But spiritual wisdom is the primary object of all our schools.
Everything else is only a tool that can help us reach that goal.

Only if the goals are the same....

By the way, what I find problematic is that your basic framework seems
to be at odds with the Indian tradition. What about testing western
philosophy on our benchmark - i.e. producing 'spiritual wisdom'? I am
not particularly knowledgeable about Western philosophy  but from what
little I have read about it, and from your own comments, it seems to
be little more than armchair discussion. In that case, should we
dismiss it because it doesnt meet our benchmarks?

You do have a point there. But again, the goal must be kept in mind.
Only a person who has some level of mumukshatva will be able to
appreciate our schools. It might indeed make sense to make use of all
the advances in logic, linguistics and other disciplines, but that is
only possible when the right people (i.e. those who have some
mumukshatva) have access to these disciplines. I doubt if the average
university academic, however brilliant he may be, is the right person
to do all this. On the other hand, I am sure somebody like
Ramakrishnan (our list member), or maybe yourself, is much better
placed. I am told there is some excellent research going on at a new
research centre that has been established at Sringeri.

By the way, have all these academic philosophers ever produced a
decent critique of Advaita or any of our systems, something that
really challenges these systems? Dont tell me they haven't done so out
of respect for our "religious sentiments".

I only meant that the academic's opinions are of academic interest :).

By the way, did you read my earlier post - wherein I tried to explain
the difference between philosophical schools & sects in the Indian
context? There has been no response from you on that
