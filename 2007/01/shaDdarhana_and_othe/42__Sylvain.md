I will be grateful if you can translate the gist in English.

               *

Because I don't master English, nor translation, i translate only one sentence from the philosopher Hegel.
According to the article you ask me to gist, Hegel (who greatly influenced Western philosophy) wrote 
« For Indians, superstition doesn't exist as opposing to reason; but all their live and thinking are a unique superstition because for them everything is a dream.... »

Philosophy is reserved to the Greek heritage. 

Later, Husserl will go in the same direction. 

I add that Christian missionaries classified all hindouism as « polytheistic » which is simply wrong.  

However, advaita is developing in the Occident because people can emancipate from the « classical philosophers » and « missionaries » interpretations.
