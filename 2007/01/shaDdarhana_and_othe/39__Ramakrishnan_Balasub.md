Dear Sri Ram Garib,

I think with my digressions on the many biases of among a large
percentage of Western academics shrouded my main point. Any philosophy
has certain fundamental suppositions to it. The Western assumptions -
as exemplified by Russell and his many philosophers - have been
subject to many criticisms for example by Schrodinger. See [1] and
[2].  He praises Vedanta as offering a better solution.

So my question why blindly take the Western ideas and suppositions,
and try to win approval? I appreciate your point abut being imprecise,
etc. But I suggest you are also looking at the wrong place. Arindam
Chakrabarti, a professor at Univ of Hawaii, Western trained and quite
reputable, has related his experience with the scholars at the
Tirupati University. He says that the teachers while using bhaashyas,
constantly refine their arguments and when he introduced some Western
style crticisms, they took that up and modified their lectures to
include those also. He relates how dynamic the tradition really is. So
you may be better off examining the fast disappearing "traditional"
pundit, than institutions like ICPR.

I disagree that Hinduism is treated with kid gloves by Western
academecians. The kind of drivel which comes out is absolutely
stunning. And if Hindus even come up with some solid objections, they
are written off as neo-nazis, no less.
