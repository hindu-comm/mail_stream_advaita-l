Yes.  I personnally studied in philosophy and I think this sentence is correct. it is probably due to western "ethnocentrism" or "culturocentrism" (variations of egocentrism).  I guess the idea is « How people that were colonized could develop a notable philosophy, a significant spirituality ? »

However, as a westerner, I tell you that advaita vedanta has a great future in the Occident.  The attraction for the wordly goods coming with invasive capitalism nearly suffocated authentic spiritual burst in the Occident.  So 
more and more Westerners discover advaita.  By the way, the successful Conversations with God seems very close to advaita to me.
