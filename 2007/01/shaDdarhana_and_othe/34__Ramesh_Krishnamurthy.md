Response:

That philosophy is an academic matter that can be an object of
research at a university is in itself a western idea. It's true that
we use the term 'acharya' for our sages & scholars, but they are quite
different from the typical university professor.

Just as a bureaucrat's opinion about academic matters means nothing,
an academic's opinion about our darshana-s means nothing.
