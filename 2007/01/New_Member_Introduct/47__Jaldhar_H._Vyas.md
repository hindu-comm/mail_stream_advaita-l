Hello,

   I was reading the forum posts regularly as I am interested in Vedanta. I 
work in the IT division for a Mortgage Company in VA.I am deeply drawn by 
the teachings of Ramana Maharishi, Paramacharya of Kanchi and Yogacharya 
BKS Iyengar. I would like to participate in the forums by exchange of 
views.

Ramani
