Subject: jIvanmukti & sarvaj~natvam


Namaste,

I remember a discussion late last year that touched on the subject
whether a Jivanmukta was a sarvaj~na or not ?.

Technically,

brahmam eve jagat kAraNa.m, sarva kAraNa.m api
kAraNa vij~nAnena kAryavij~nAna.m bhavati

jIvanmuktaH brahma j~nAniH
brahma vij~nAnena sarva vij~nAna.m bhavati.
tasmAt "jIvanmuktaH sarvaj~naH"

Is this understanding correct ?

My intent of asking this is just to better understand the shastra.

Thank you,
Aravind
