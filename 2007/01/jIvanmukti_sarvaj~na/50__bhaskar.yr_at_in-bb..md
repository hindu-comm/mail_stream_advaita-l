Namaste,

I remember a discussion late last year that touched on the subject
whether a Jivanmukta was a sarvaj~na or not ?.

Technically,

brahmam eve jagat kAraNa.m, sarva kAraNa.m api
kAraNa vij~nAnena kAryavij~nAna.m bhavati

jIvanmuktaH brahma j~nAniH
brahma vij~nAnena sarva vij~nAna.m bhavati.
tasmAt "jIvanmuktaH sarvaj~naH"

Is this understanding correct ?

Kindly allow me to share my part of understanding...sarvajnatva
(omniscience), sarvashaktitva (omnipotence) etc. etc. attributed to
nirguNa, nirAkAra brahman only in the duality (vyavahAra)..the jnAni's
realization is not that ahaM sarvajnA, ahaM sarvashaktha etc. his
realization is that ahaM brahmAsmi, nAhaM karta, nAhaM bhokta, kEvala
nirguNa..So from the empirical point of view the *embodied jnAni* ( I dont
know how far it is fair to use this term) cannot claim that he is Ishwara
or sarvajna/sarvashakta...coz. these qualities presupposes the duality i.e.
ruler & ruled or baddha jIva, a supreme controller Ishwara and the platform
of jagat. whereas jnAni transcends these dualities & realizes his
yEkamEvAdvitIyatva.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
