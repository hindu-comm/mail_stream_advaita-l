There is no point in these kind of comparisons.Its all due ti circumstances. 
  Ramana lived in a highly spritualistic/ civilized cociety where as Prophet Mohammed lived among nomadic tribes of deserts. Why even Krishna induced Arjuna in to the war against his wishes... So you say Krishna is not as good as ramana!!!   

  Truth is one and the paths to rach are many and based on the circumstances....Why compare????

You hit the nail. There is no comparision between Mohammad and Raman maharshi. Thtought his life Mohammad faught war while Raman Maharshi showed love and compassion.

If you can prove that, you may be interested in corresponding with the
folks at http://www.faithfreedom.org/ since they have agreed to take
down their site if proven wrong -

If you want to compare how they lived their lives, this book might be
interesting:
"Twenty Three Years: A Study of the Prophetic Career of Mohammad" by
Ali Dashti. It is available from amazon.com.
