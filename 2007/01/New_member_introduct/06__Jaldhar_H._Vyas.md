Hello:

My name is Abhilash. Male, 26. Smartha. I was directed to your site by a 
friend of mine. I am an engineer and also a graduate in Sanskrit 
literature. Currently I am pursuing Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering at 
Cornell University. My family is traditionally a follower of Shringeri 
matha. I have been interested in vedanta since my teens and have had the 
fortune to sit at the feet of Sri K. G. Subraya Sharma. I hope to learn 
more about vedanta through discussions at your forum. Please let me know 
if you need any other information.

-- Abhilash
