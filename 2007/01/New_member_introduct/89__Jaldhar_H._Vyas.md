I have been studying Advaita-vedanta for the past few years. I have a 
reasonable understanding of Advaita, but not whether it is the right 
understanding or in precise accordance with the scriptures !! I have read 
some postings in your website and wish to ask questions so that my doubts 
and misunderstandings can be cleared up. Thank you.
