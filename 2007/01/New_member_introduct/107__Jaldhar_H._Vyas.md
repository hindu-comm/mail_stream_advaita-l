My name is Shankar Mallampalli. I live in Jacksonville, FL with my wife 
and twin toddlers. Born 38 yrs ago in interior Andhra in a brahmin family 
that worships Lalithambika and Sadasiva. Spirituality is the main pillar 
of my life and purity is what I constantly seek.  I am interested to read 
through and follow all Vendanta discussions here in this group.

Please make me a member of this group.
Thanks.
Shankar
