One detail that I forgot to mention: The VNM has a vyaakhyaanaa by
Srimad Bhaaratii tiirtha Svaamina.h himself. The notes by JBS are
based on this. Only the verse parts are available in Sanskrit, the
vyAkhyaana has not been published here.

The published book has a shrImukham from the current head of Srigeri
Matha, also name Sri Bhaaratii Tirtha.
