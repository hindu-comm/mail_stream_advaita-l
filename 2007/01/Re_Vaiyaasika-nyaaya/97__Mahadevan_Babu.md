By the Grace of Achrayals,

I thank the great person, who posted this invaluable Panchadasi  
comments by Sri Sri Jnanananda Bharathi swamigal.

What a great Janani he was.

I am not sure if anyone of you have read his PurvAsrama father Sri  
Sri Ramananda Saraswathi Swamigal's great book "Dharma Vimarshanam"  
printed by the same Sri Vani Vilaas Press.  Sri Ramananda Swamigal  
was given Sanyasa by H.H.Sri Kamalananda Narasimha Bharathi Swamigal  
in presence of H.H. Chandarshekara Bharathi Swamigal.  Unfortunately,  
I don't have a PDF copy, but this book is a great commentary on  
practical rules to be followed and is a great guidance for day-to-day  
life for all ashramas.

These books are great treasure and I am very happy that this forum is  
sharing it with so many Mumukshus like all of us.

Om Tat Sat

Babu


It is a great
