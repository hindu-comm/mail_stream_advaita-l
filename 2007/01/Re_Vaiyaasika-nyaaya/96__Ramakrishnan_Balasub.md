Thanks! Good catch, I missed that. I noticed that the VNM is listed as
a forthcoming publication in the pancadashii. I checked again
yesterday and in the introductory note, Sri Ramasubramanya Raja (the
publisher) has thanked one Sri Venkatarama Sastri for proof-reading
the handwritten manuscript. I wonder how many of JBSs publications
have not seen the light of the day yet.
