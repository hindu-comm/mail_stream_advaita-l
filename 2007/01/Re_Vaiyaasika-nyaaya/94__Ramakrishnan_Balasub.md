Ravi,

I think he may have, but I am not sure. It sounded like this is the
first time the VNM translation of JBS is being published (from the
preface), it seems to have existed only in manuscript form. I have
read/have about 15 books by him. It would be great if someone could
compile a bibliography of JBS. I consider him one of the best writers
in the English/Tamiz languages. Perhaps the next time I visit India,
I'll eqnuire around.

Rama
