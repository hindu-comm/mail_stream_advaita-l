Hello,
  Sri Natesan wants to do a english translation or give meanings in english to Uma Sahasramam a work composed by Kavya Kanta Ganapati Munni. Ganapathi Munni lived during the days of Bhagawan Raman Maharishi and he was on of those rare tapaswis who existed in India and has produced several notable works in Sanskrit, one of which is the Magnum Opus "Uma Sahasramam".
Sri Natesan aged 93, lives in Bangalore  was also present during Ganapati Munni's and Bhagawan Ramana Maharishi's days. Anybody who is knowledgable in Sanaskrit and can spare time to do the work may please contact Sri Natesan at his Bangalore residence 080-23318142. Mr Natesan (aged 93) a little hard of hearing. He lives with his grandson.
Translation in English will benefit many ardent devotees and readers. The Shasramam is supposedly contains many shlokas that can be chanted for specific remedies.The work has to be done at Bangalore (I suppose).

Thanks

Ramani
