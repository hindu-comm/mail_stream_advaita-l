I believe Ramana said that (Cmiiw) you dont have to be saMnyasI to achive
what he did, in an interview. This may be against the smrutis.

But I am curious, how many in this news group are practicing Advaitins?
How many can go in to or gone in to samadhi state? If at all possible
can you explain how that was?

Another question is, if most of the participants in this group agree with
Amuthan's statement, then is your discussion about Advaita in this group
for theoritical purposes only? (or an ego trip to show that I know so much
but I dont practice:-)
