the vRtti mentioned above is variously known as brahmAkAra/
akhaNDAkAra/ AtmAkAra vRtti, ahaM sphuraNa, nirvisheSha-Atma
sAkShAtkAra etc.

according to sha~Nkara, the immediate knowledge of brahman that arises
because of vedAnta vichAra destroys aj~nAna and leads to anAtmavRtti
nirodha. this immediate knowledge of brahman is the same as brahmAkAra
vRtti. from the yoga point of view, it is a form of saMpraj~nAta
samAdhi where the mind assumes the form of the self.

the siddhAnta is that brahmAkAravRtti destroys avidyA (dehAtmabhAva)
and finally destroys itself. the destruction of the brahmAkAra vRtti
by itself would correspond to a transition from sampraj~nAta to
asaMpraj~nAta samAdhi, in the above scheme of classification.

AchArya gauDapAda talks of brahmAkAra vRtti in his mANDUkya kArikAs as follows:
'yadA na lIyate chittaM na cha vikShipyate punaH.
 ani~NganamanAbhAsaM niShpannaM brahma tattadA..' (mA.kA. 3.46)

the resolution of brahmAkAra vRtti into the self after destroying
avidyA is known, for instance, from verses like:
'aj~nAnakaluShaM jIvaM j~nAnAbhyAsAdvinirmalam.
 kRtvA j~nAnaM svayaM nashyejjalaM katakareNuvat..' (Atmabodha 5)
the j~nAnAbhyAsa mentioned by AchArya is the
shravaNa-manana-nididhyAsana process (= vedAnta vichAra)

it is important to keep in mind that according to sha~Nkara, it is not
chitta vRtti nirodha that produces Atmaj~nAna. it's the other way
about - by steadily holding on to Atmaj~nAna, which arises from
vedAnta vichAra, chitta vRtti nirodha is effected permanently. this
doesn't mean mano nigraha is not necessary. mano nigraha is absolutely
necessary for vedAnta vichAra. however, permanent chitta vRtti nirodha
is impossible without Atmaj~nAna.

vAsudevaH sarvaM,
aparyAptAmRtaH.
