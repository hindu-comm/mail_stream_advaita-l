namo nArAyaNAya!

dear shrI vinAyaka,

the vRtti mentioned above is variously known as brahmAkAra/
akhaNDAkAra/ AtmAkAra vRtti, ahaM sphuraNa, nirvisheSha-Atma
sAkShAtkAra etc.

Dear Sir,

Thank you very much for your beautiful explanation. May I know the 
scriptural source for the statement: Disappearing of vritti is nothing but
transition from samprajnata samadhi to nirvikalpa samadhi?

Yours in Sri Ramakrishna,

Br. Vinayaka
