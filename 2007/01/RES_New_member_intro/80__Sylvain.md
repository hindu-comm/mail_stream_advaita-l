Dear Asad Mustafa Rizvi

i am from christian background.  i think non-duality (advaita in sanskrit) 
in universal.  i found clear traces of non-duality conscience in sufism (Ibn 
Arabi, Jallal al Din Rumi), in christianism (Meister Eckhart, in the New 
Testament, etc.

In the case of RAmana Maharshi, it is clear to me He is from hindu 
tradition, even if He is not narrow-minded, short-sighted on it. He is not 
restricted to it.

i think you can find Peace, Allah in your tradition.  The important, i 
think, is not to force others to follow your particular way.

Non-duality is not restricted to any doctrine. Let's take advantage of it.
