Rizviji is right to good extent. Ramana is well known and  revered by all advaita vedantis, but what is the percentage of advaita vedantis as compared to ritualistic hindus many of whom might not even heard of Ramana.  Dwaitic
  hindu scholors  who could have knowledge of Ramana wont agree with his teachings.

teacher in the tradition of Advaita-Vedanta (which is why you have
come to this list). The word 'Advaita' is sanskrit for 'not-two' i.e.
non-duality. Advaita-Vedanta is very much a part of mainstream
Hinduism. In fact, if Advaita-Vedanta isnt mainstream Hinduism,
nothing is. Non-duality is an ancient and very well-established
tradition in Hinduism, starting with the Upanishads.

Dear Mr. Amuthan and Mr. Ramesh:

I may be mistaken about mainstream beliefs of hinduism, but my observation was not without any basis. I personally know quite a few hindus. When I got curious about Ramana Maharishi, I first asked them about him. Frankly, they were as clueless as me. Some of them had vaguely heard Ramana's name, some showed a namesake respect but most of them did not know anything at all about him. 

Mind you, I am not talking about irreligious atheist type hindus. I am talking about mainstream, God fearing, temple going hindus. In my circle of hindu friends, I do not know anyone who knows about Ramana Maharishi's teachings. Though it is possible that I might have met a seriously biased sample of hindus yet not very likely. I have a pretty large circle of hindu friends. 

It makes me wonder if advaita vedanta is really as prominent in hinduism as you say it is.

Jazakallah
Asad Mustafa Rizvi
