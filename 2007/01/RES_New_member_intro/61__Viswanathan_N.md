  whether you call Brahman or Allah or Jehovah it really doesn't matter...
  Its 'The Truth'  'the Consciousness'.... isnt it!!!  I too have read bit about
   Al- Mansoor and other sufis and Basically they are no different from Shri Ramana.Who can ignore great Kabir?

  Welcome Rizviji

I would like to say that I am also Muslim, converted to Islam about 9 years
ago and I also think that Sri Ramana Maharshi says the same in depth what
Islam says and all other true religions do, in the world.

Thank you for your participation in this group.
