Dear Asad,

This list caters to Advaita Vedanta as taught by Sankara, so you will
find a lot of "technical" discussions based on Vedanta. Although the
list does respect Bhagavan Ramana Maharshi, it doesn't focus on his
teachings.

If you are primarily interested in Bhagavan's teachings, here are a
couple of yahoogroups mailing lists that you might want to take a
look at:

http://groups.yahoo.com/group/The_Sage_of_Arunachala/

Regards,
Kartik
