dear Rizviji

  You are right any relgion at surface level would look dualistic(dvaita) and at depth it would be sure be non- dualistic (advaita).
  The movement you drop your false self (ego) all remaining in the existence is
  HE. Thats why the vedic statements like " aham brahmasmi'  ' tatvamasi '...
  and even Al- Mansoor's  ' Ana'l Huq" .

  Warm regards
  Viswanath

But, hope youe are aware that the western/ prophetic religions like Islam, Christianity and Judaism are nearer to dwaitic school rather than advaita school of thinking.

In the name of God, most gracious, most merciful.

Dear Viswanathan sir;

I cannot say anything about other prophetic religions but Islam works at several levels. At the base level, it is an ethical guide. At the highest level, it is a direct experience of divine unity. The holy Qura'n declares that He is nearer to you than the nearest. The sufi aims to realize his unity with Allah (swt) by merging his individual self with Him. Hope it helps.

Jazakallah
Asad Mustafa Rizvi
