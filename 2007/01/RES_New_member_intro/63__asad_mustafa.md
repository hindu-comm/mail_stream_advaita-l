  Dear Viswanathan sir;

  I cannot say anything about other prophetic religions but Islam works at several levels. At the base level, it is an ethical guide. At the highest level, it is a direct experience of divine unity. The holy Qura'n declares that He is nearer to you than the nearest. The sufi aims to realize his unity with Allah (swt) by merging his individual self with Him. Hope it helps.

  Jazakallah
  Asad Mustafa Rizvi
