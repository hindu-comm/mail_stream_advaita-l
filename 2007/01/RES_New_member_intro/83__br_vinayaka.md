  In the name of God, most gracious most merciful.

  AFAIK, neither are non-dualist teachings of Ramana Maharishi considered mainstream hinduism. And if I am not mistaken, they are considered heresy by followers of Vishnu god.

  There is no end to human arrogance about complete understanding of God's mysetries. As Rumi puts it, "She allowed me a glimpse while re-arranging her veil. My vanity made me think that she was now exclusively mine."

Dear Asad,

This saying Rumi's is excellent. Even though this is not a forum to discuss  about Sri Ramakrishna i would like to mention that he practiced islam and was initiated by a Sufi saint.   Very clearly he told that at the culmination of his islamic sadhana he realized saguna brahman and later his mind transcended it and realized the nirguna brahman.

Yours in Sri Ramakrishna,

Br. Vinayaka
