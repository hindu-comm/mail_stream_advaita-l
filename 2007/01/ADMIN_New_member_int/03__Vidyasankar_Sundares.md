My name is Vishnu and I am currently residing in the USA for the past 8 
years. I am a native of Bangalore India . My family and I  traditionally 
belonged to  the  SMARTHA brahmin (Advaitha) school of thoughts.  About 
thirty years ago my father was greatly influenced by the Dvaitha school of 
thought and after much debating with some scholars decided to go that route. 
We have been strictly practicing it since then. I came across this 
subscription list through google and was interested in closely following the 
discussion / debate threads from a lot of other like minded people. I would 
be greatly  interested in being a part of this mailing list.

Thanks,
Vishnu Sharma
