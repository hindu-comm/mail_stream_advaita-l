Pranams to all.
My name is Shyam Subramanian, and I am currently living in the US.

I have been a student of Pujya Swami Paramarthananda-ji for many years and 
have also benefitted immensely from Pujya Swami Dayananda-ji's works and 
teachings.

I look forward to being an active member of this august forum.

HariOM
