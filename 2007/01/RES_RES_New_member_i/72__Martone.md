  In the name of God, most gracious most merciful.

  AFAIK, neither are non-dualist teachings of Ramana Maharishi considered
mainstream hinduism. And if I am not mistaken, they are considered heresy by
followers of Vishnu god.

  There is no end to human arrogance about complete understanding of God's
mysetries. As Rumi puts it, "She allowed me a glimpse while re-arranging her
veil. My vanity made me think that she was now exclusively mine."

  Jazakallah
