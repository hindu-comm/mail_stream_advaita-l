  It may not be relevant to this list but I think a clarification is needed here.

  Sufism is not different from Islam. Although prophet Muhammad (PBUH), is a very important link, he is not the first in the tradition, which started from Adam (PBUH). The message of divine unity lay scattered untill it was consolidated in the revelation of the holy Qura'n. Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) took it from there and explained the subtelities of the message to his chosen companions. Others who were not chosen to receive this highest message of the holy Qura'n felt jealous and accussed the real torch bearers as heretics after death of the holy Prophet (PBUH).

  Sufism is not against other schools of Islam. It acknwoledges their validity on a relative level but trancends them all at the level of the absolute.

  Jazakallah
