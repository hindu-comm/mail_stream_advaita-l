Advaitic mind is ultimate state of non dualism. Its the 'end' and what scriptures say is one of the means. Ultimately it is dropping your ego completely, say its suureneder to God or surrender to Self or what ever. in other words when 'you' are not there "It' is there. Just drop that " I " and all attached to it my religion, my culture, my tradition...my.... my..... . You can achieve anywhere anytime , in fact rightnow right here. No big condirions ....

  This how I see it and this is how I put it in words.
