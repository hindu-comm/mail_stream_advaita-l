It is true that the grace of a Guru is essential to know the Truth.But,to
come to that one has to be aware of the transitorines of Life and the
World.Practically speaking,in these days, it is hard to get a Guru who is
honest and who is a "Brahmanishta".The Gurus themselves are too occupied
with the World and their own problems and are groping in the dark.Unless
one has the conviction about Vairagya and Viveka himself no Guru can help
him.This is the first step.What is the use if our neighbour is a
millionare?
