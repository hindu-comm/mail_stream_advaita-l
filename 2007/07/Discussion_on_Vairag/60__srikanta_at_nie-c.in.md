With reference to Dr.Prasanna Srinivas on the role of a Guru.He has quoted
Aurobindo's example.But it doesnot happen with every one.First it is
necessary to understand that this world is transient(vairagya) and one
must obtain viveka.Shankara says in his Brahmasutra Bhashya that Viveka
and vairagya are the prime requsites for a seeker.Without this any amount
of quoting from the scripture is of no use.It just becomes "Shuka
jalpita"(parrot talk).Also one has to work towards the goal.The Guru can
only pointout the way.But it is for the seeker to put effort and work
towards it.
Namaste.                                               N.Srikanta.
