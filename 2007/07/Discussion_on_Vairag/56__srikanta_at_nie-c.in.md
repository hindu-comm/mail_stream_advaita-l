We all start out in life and the world with some assumption and
conviction.But something happens which skakes our assumption and
conviction and wakes us up.What else these assumptions,if they are not
Maya?.It is this awakening which makes us to think deeply about life and
our dealings with it.Truly,Vairagya is a tool in our hands to meet life
and the world more convincingly.
