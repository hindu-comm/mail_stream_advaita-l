namo nArAyaNAya!

dear SrIrAm,
  getting AtmavidyAvilAsa isn't an easy task (interpreted any way!). i
finally managed to get a copy, thanks to one our list members SrI
Sankara nArAyaNan. i made a .pdf version of it for personal use. i'll
probably mail it to SrI jaldhar so that he can upload it in the
advaita list homepage.

  the work is one of the finest i've come across when it comes to
explaining how an Atmaj~nAni lives. it is indeed a great delight to
read it. it is a must read for anyone who wants to know what it means
to be 'free' in the advaitik sense of the term. no wonder all the
recent SR~Ngeri AcAryAs had it for their nitya-pArAyaNam.

vAsudevaH sarvaM,
aparyAptAmRtaH.
