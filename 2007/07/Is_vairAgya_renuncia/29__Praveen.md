praNAm all,

I'm inline with most of what Sukumar-ji and Amuthan-ji wrote, but IMO,
its not just about a vairagi's own feelings about a situation, but
whether he bases his feelings on what others might think. Unless all
of it is happening as a natural reaction, without conscious effort,
one has not graduated to become a vairagi in the true sense. Till
then, it is a bundle of one's own thoughts, biased by prArabdha, on
how to react in a particular situation, with its own additions of
karma.

These questions, IMHO, also fall under a similar category of "How does
a jnAni react to certain circumstances?"
