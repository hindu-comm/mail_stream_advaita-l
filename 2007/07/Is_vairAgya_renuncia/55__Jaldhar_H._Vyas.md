Namaste, I dont think Asoka is a good example for vairAgya,
even after he converted to Buddhism. According to Asokavadhana,
which is a buddhist text, Asoka slaughtered 18000 jains even
AFTER he converted to Buddhism, because of a perceived insult
of the Buddha by a jain monk. He realized his mistake only when
one of his favorite (buddhist) monk was mistaken to be a jain
and killed. I doubt if any real vairAgi (if that's a legitimate
word) would indulge in such acts.
