  I am thanking all of you for accepting me

  please allow me to share my views with you.

"The practical applications of advaita" 
 ---------------------------------------
 dear friends
  first of all,we want to have 
                       clear idea about
 advaita
 -------
      advaita means - the stage of "athma 
 knows itself everywhere"
   how this is possible?-- the question arise
 before us.

"the simple practise of advaita"
             "Try to behave like a sun"
in your thyana.
 then assume"
 your light of athma sorrounding all of the
 world and nothing else other than you"

 this practise makes you to go further
 steps in your spiritual leval.
   "Advaita thoughts starts from your food"
  because  " food only makes the human body,
  depend upon your body your activies are
 created"
    therefore "Be the vegetarion"
    you know
 "The pure advaiti one part of god"
      therefore he cannot go the wrong path.

  I will continue my views in my next mail
     Thanking you for share the great moments
 with you
              yours friendly
                  r.thirumurugan
                  (s/o n.ramakrishnan)
