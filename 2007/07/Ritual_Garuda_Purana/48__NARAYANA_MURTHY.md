Vyas mahaSayA,

  namaskaram.
  =================================
  Shri Vyas :

  This is why the Garuda Purana and allAdvaitic works will tell you that 
until the time when one is mentally and physically ready for sannyasa,
 all the nitya and naimittika Karmas _MUST_ be observed.
  ====================================

  In addition to performance of nitya, naimittika karmanushtanas, the other pillar of smarta sampradAyam - devatArAdanam / upAsanam - also helps a sadaka in focussing his mind.
