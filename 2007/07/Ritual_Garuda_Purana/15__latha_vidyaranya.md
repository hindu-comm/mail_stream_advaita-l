hari om,

  "The entire universe is but a yajna (a"mere" ritual). "

  beautifully said! the sun rising every morning and going down in the night, moon and stars appearing, the seasons, everything in the universe is a ritual. the microcosm is but a reflection of the macrocosm. what i think is happening outside is all happening inside me. look for the Truth within which is also there without magnified in all its glory!

And what is a "mere" ritual? The entire universe is but a yajna (a
"mere" ritual). Our sense of individuality (ego-sense) is but a
ritual. The very performance of ritual yields this insight. Thats how
all our ego-denying philosophies arose.

Seeing through the mere ritual that the universe is, one realizes the
truth, and even this realization is but a mere ritual!

But one has to learn to use the boat first, isn't it? Of course, its
all a ritual!

In praise of ritual
