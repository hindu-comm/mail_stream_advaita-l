Namaste.

I have a MS and PhD from Indian Institute of Science and currently working
as a scientist in Fair Isaac Co. I am a resident of Bangalore, currently in
San Diego and will be back in India by August 2007.

Our family is devoted to the Acharyas of Sringeri Shankara Matham. H H Sri
Achaaryaal has blessed my father with His Holy padukas and your truly with
shivalingam and salagramam for puja after mantra upadesham. I am a novice
student of Sri Bhagavadpada's works. I look forward to benefit from
satsangham.
