This is with reference to the Shiva Linga in Thrissur"Vadukkunathan".This
word means the 'Lord facing North",just like 'Dakshinamurthy"which is "The
Lord facing south".It is said that Shankara's father Shivaguru and his
mother Aryambha,took the vow and did penance for the birth of the
child.They observed"Bhajanam"which is observance of the penance with
vows.The place is very sacred and was a flourishing medical centre for
Ayurveda.Lots of Ghee are offered to the Shivalinga,and old ghee is kept
piled up in a place.this is said to stomachache when consumed as prasadam.
