Namaste shrii Rama |
Thank you very much for your additionnal clarification on VaDakkunAthan. As 
a fact, I was going to send another message to shrii Ramesh as in nearly all 
occurrences found on the Internet the name appears with a double k.
Sorry, this is far from advaita, but very useful for a confused Frenchman 
like this little self of "i".
Thanks again.
