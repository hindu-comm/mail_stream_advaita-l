>From my Tamil Grammar knowledge, I was inclined to say vaDakkunAthan.
The vaDakku +  nAthan. The 'n' doesn't duplicate. On the other hand I
believe it is vaDakkutthisai (Northern direction), the 't' duplicates.
When I saw the reply by Ramesh, I was a little puzzled. I asked my
wife, who is from Kerala, and she confirmed that it should be
vaDakkunAthan. But she wasn't able to give the syntactical rule for
it. I'll ask my father-in-law who is pretty good at Malayalam Grammar
and confirm it.
