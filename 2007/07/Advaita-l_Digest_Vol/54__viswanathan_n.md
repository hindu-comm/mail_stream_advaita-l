Dear Bhaskar Prabhu
Hare Krishna

Your question about vairagya ,esp, in real  life situations,  is very 
practical and relevent to every householder like us.

Here is where the concept of living in "present"  comes..... "Right Now 
Right Here"  should be the approch to the life.

Scene one....condole the death and console the near ones when you are there 
in that scene....  be there totally,without even thinking of those at 
home....  be there bit more time if need be, but the movement you are out of 
that place ..come out completely

than the scene changes..you are at home. If still time is there, take your 
people for a movie. Let them enjoy. (assuming they dont even know the dead, 
as you said)

According to me I was neither touched nor involved in neither of the places. 
Nevertheless  I do perfrom just the 'act' of consoling or enjoying. I remain 
unaffected . (the scene you mentioned , once practically came across in my 
life)

Is it this called vairagya???? Whatever..... I remain unattahced to the 
surroundings, but I do respond
to the scene as I am expected to.

>pretend) according to the demands of life *situation/circumstance*??  like,
>looking sad & weepy guy at the cremation of his friend  & looking joyful,
>wonderfully happy  husband when he is with family !!  Or,  should he wear

>'sukha dhukhE samEkrutvA' etc. etc.  or dhHkEshu *duHkhi*, suKhEshu *suKhi*
>without wearing any permanent tag or dis-associating himself with neither
