hari om,

  "If one believes in Vedanta but can't put it into practice that is not something 
to be ashamed of but a problem to be worked on.  The Shastras provide 
the key".

  ..............not to be ashamed of , but a problem to be worked on............. truly inspiring words! so many times we are in a dilemma becoz of one belief, but unable to practice it always in all spheres. thanks, these words resolve that dilemma. its really a big load off......... i shall work on it :))

  namaste
