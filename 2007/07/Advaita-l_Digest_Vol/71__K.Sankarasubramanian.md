Dear Sir

Namasthey... I need a clarifications from the learned group here... 



Is there a vedic/ sastric substantiation that aacharam is more precious
and prioritized than  the aacharyaals... 



Given the choice, do we need to comply first with the aacharams and then
only with the aacharyaals directions



Pl elucidate
