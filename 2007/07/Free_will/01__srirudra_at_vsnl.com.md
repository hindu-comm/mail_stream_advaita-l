Dear Members
About the concept of free will  i would say that there is no free will as such just as the gravitational force controls all matters -inert as well as living -of the earth the so called free will is a prisoner of the cosmic will-ie.,Iswara.Bhagawan Sri Ramana holds the view that everything - all acts-  are predetermined.An individual is always free not to identify himself with the body and not be affected by the pleasures and pains consequent on its activities. Ref-Ramana Maharishi by Sri Arvind Sharma-pages61 to 67.
R.Krishnamoorthy.
