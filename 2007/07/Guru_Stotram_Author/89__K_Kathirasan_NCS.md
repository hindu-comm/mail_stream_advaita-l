Namaste 

As stated by Sri Sriram, the Guru Stotram appears to have been culled
and modified from the Guru Gita. The Guru Gita appears in the Skanda
Purana. 

Warmest Regards,
Kathirasan K

This is the query regarding Guru Stotram - Akanda Mandalakaram.....  by
Mr.
Dev Babu. The above is found in Guru Gita.
Guru Paduka Stotram was composed by Sri Sachidananda Shivabhinava
Nrusimha
Bharathi Swamigal, one of the previous Shankaracharyas who adorned the
Dakshimnaya Sringeri Sharada Peetam.

Regards,
Sriram
