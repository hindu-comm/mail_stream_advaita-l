This is the query regarding Guru Stotram - Akanda Mandalakaram.....  by Mr.
Dev Babu. The above is found in Guru Gita.
Guru Paduka Stotram was composed by Sri Sachidananda Shivabhinava Nrusimha
Bharathi Swamigal, one of the previous Shankaracharyas who adorned the
Dakshimnaya Sringeri Sharada Peetam.

Regards,
Sriram
