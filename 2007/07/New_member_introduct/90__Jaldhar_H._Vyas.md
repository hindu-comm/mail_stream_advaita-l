Hi,

       I am Sandeep. I am 25 and working as a software engineer in Bangalore.

Last year or so one of my friend Prashanth Bhat gave me one book "Paramartha
Chinthamani" (from Sachidananda Saraswathi Swamiji) and
that changed my whole perception about our vedas and infact philosophy as a
whole...

My whole purpose of joining this group is to submerge in ocean of advaitha
(as lots of people putforth their views)

Hope you will accept my request and I get a chance to be a member of this
holy group.

Thanks and Regards,

Sandeep
