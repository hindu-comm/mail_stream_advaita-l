My bad, it's indeed 12, not 1. I mis-counted ;-). However, it seems my
wording was ambiguous. Of the 12, 10 of them have 2 Ahutis each, so a
total of 10*2+2 = 22 Ahutis for the rAShTrabHR^it group. For example,
the first goes (using Wikners notation):

The bulk of the mantras in the Apastamba gR^ihya-sUtra are not to be
found in the samhitA or the shAkhA. I think we can safely assume lots
of borrowing. Note that the kAThakam, aruNam and the
svAdhyaaya-braahmaNam are originally from the kAThaka branch, as
pointed out by BhaTTa bhAskara Mishra. Of course phonetic evidence
also confirms this traditional view. Now the kAThakam consisting of 3
chapters forms the 9, 10, 11th chapters of the 3rd aShTakam of the
brAhmaNam, and the other two are the 1st and 2nd chapters of the
AraNyakam. This was a wholesale borrowing to say the least.

Note that unlike the shukla-yajur veda, the jayaadi is mandatory for
any smArta sacrifice following the Apastamba sUtra. So there is no
excuse to omit it.
