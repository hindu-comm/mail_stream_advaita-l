The pAraskara gR^ihya sUtra also mentions these homas but interestingly 
only in the context of the marriage vidhi.  The Shuklayajurveda prayoga 
books include them but you are right that most shastris don't know about 
them or omit them.

PGS puts 3 first and 4,5, and 6 are replaced by 5 ahutis to Agni.

The information I have matches your description.  But interestingly it 
doesn't say these mantras are from TS.  Indeed they are given without 
svaras at all so until your article I thought they were sutrokta not 
Vedic.

Same in PGS though once again they are given without svaras.

As I mentioned before the PGS puts it first.  Also the Shuklayajurvedic 
tradition thinks there are only 12 ahutis.

It is interesting that the Shuklayajurveda was supposed to have broken off 
from the Krshnayajurveda but it seems even afterward they did "borrow" 
occasionally.
