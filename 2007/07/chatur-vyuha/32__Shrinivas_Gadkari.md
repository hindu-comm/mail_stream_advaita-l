Namaste,

In upanishad's we often find statements equating
manaH, prANa, prajnA with brahma. Thus there is
some value in defining a manomaya brahma,
prANamaya brahma, and prajnAmaya brahma in 
addition to the unqualified brahma.

Possibly this led to the concept of chaturvyuha:

1. manomaya brahma = aniruddha vyuha.
   Related deity being chandra/ soma

2. buddhimaya/ prajnAmaya brahma = pradhyumna
   vyuha (kAma deva). Related deity being 
   hiranyagarbha (brahma deva). 

3. ahamkAramaya/ prAnamaya brahma = 
   samkarSaNa. Related deity being rudra
   (note rudra has also been assigned 
   the deity of prANa-s, same holds true
   about hanumAna who is considered 
   mahA rudra - the eleventh rudra)

4. cittamaya brahma = unqualified brahma
   = vAsudeva. Related highest deity being 
   kSetrajna.

Regards,
Shrinivas
