Dear Members 
Conclusions arrived at based on Tarka will be more accurate as here personal prejudices get eliminated  as the tarka is to find out the truth ie.,what is right and not who is right.In olden days there were graceful acceptance of defeat in tarkas between proposers of new theories and purvapakshies and this resulted in buiding up refined truths.Ofcourse we do find contrary situations too which were few and far between.Anubhava is subjective and may vary from person to person as all situations may not be identical and some times clouded by personal prejudices the person may not see the other point of view.
R.Krishnamoorthy.
