After that we have homa-s for the kANDa R^iShis and sadasaspati. This
is followed by vedArambam. After vedArambam, we have jayAdi homam.

praNAms
Hare Krishna

jayAdi hOma, we do only if we do the *agnimukha* according to YajurvEda
prayOga.  We dont have to do  jayAdi hOma (atleast in our practice)  if the
*agnimukha* prayOga according the R^gvEda.  Just for info.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
