vyAsa pUjA as the start of cAturmAsya is for sannyAsins only. However, there 
is no prohibition from householders/students doing a pUjA on the same day to 
vyAsa the same way as one would do a pUjA to gaNapati or Siva or kRshNa. 
During the upAkarma, to my knowledge, there is no specifically separate 
vyAsa pUjA. vyAsa is mentioned along with other Rshi-s in the kANDa Rshi 
tarpaNa.

Regards,
Vidyasankar
