Just before the upAkarma homa, vyAsa is invoked into a kalasha filled
with water and Shodasha-upacAra pUja is performed using the puruSha
sUkta mantras. After that a simple svAha for prajApati and indra. Then
svAha with agnaye, somAya, agnaye in that order. Finally, with
vyAhR^iti for prajApati.

After that we have homa-s for the kANDa R^iShis and sadasaspati. This
is followed by vedArambam. After vedArambam, we have jayAdi homam.

Regrettably most pundits omit vyAsa-pUjA and jayAdi. More regrettably
for the diaspora, most priests do not know how to do jayAdi, or even
the jayAdi mantras in the first place.
