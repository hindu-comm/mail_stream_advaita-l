Namste Rama-Ji:

  Possibly not having recognized the significance of theses rituals Brahmani's may be omitting them. 

  Could you please provide some details "vyAsa-pUjA and jayAdi" ?  Personally I am not familiar with "jayAdi puujaa" and may benefit the list.

  Best Regards,

  Dr. Yadu

Regrettably most pundits omit vyAsa-pUjA and jayAdi. More regrettably
for the diaspora, most priests do not know how to do jayAdi, or even
the jayAdi mantras in the first place.
