The Inheritance of the Endless Empirical Past
All that you have inherited, all that you have brought with you through
innumerable crores of births in the past, all that you have seen, heard,
enjoyed, tasted, read or known either in this life or in the past lives are
hidden in your subconscious mind. Why don't you master the technique of
concentration and the way of commanding your subconscious mind and make full
and free use of all that knowledge?
