Dear Atmaswaroopa, OmNamo Narayanaya,

Chaturvidah Purusharthas known as Dharma, Artha, Kama,
Moksha.
 How a person should go about to accomplish these
Purusharthas? Is there any priority or sequence or
time and space in Vedantic approach?

 Many a time, Artha and Kama are looked down as 
conflicting  to the Dharma or Moksha. Is it really so?
Yet, majority are entangled in these two purusharthas.
Why?

The ultimate goal of a seeker being Moksha, should he
delink himself from Artha and Kama?
Members are requested to offer their views.


In the service of the Lord,
C.Gunnala
