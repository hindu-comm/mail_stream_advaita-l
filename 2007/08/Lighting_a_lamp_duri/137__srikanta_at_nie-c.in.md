With reference to the above topic,lighting a lamp(it is not merely a
lamp,but a Kuthuvilakku in Tamil which signifies the auspiciousness)that
is being lighted.The "Jyothi" signifies light.It is not right to light the
lamp with shoes on,as the function is inagurated with the invocation of
God's blessings.There is a certain convention in our tradition for
auspicious occassions like Puja etc.
