The Theo-centric Vision
That man who, living in the midst of temptations of the world disciplines
his mind by devotional exercises is the true hero. The true hero can look on
any direction he chooses while carrying a heavy burden on his head.
Similarly, the perfect man whose mind is thoroughly disciplined has his eyes
constantly directed towards God even when he is weighed down by the burden
of worldly duties.


Om Tat Sat,
Sriram
