To those list members who would be in Hyderabad on 16th Sept 2007,

The third Bhagyanagar Veda Sabha is being organised by the Nori Narasimha Sastry Charitable Trust at Shankar Mutt, Nallakunta starting from 7:30 am and expected to end at 7:00 pm, along the lines of "parIkshApaddhati". The Sabha shall be presided over by Brahma Sri Yanamandra Venkata Subrahmanya Ghanapathi, and expected to be attended by Krama- and Ghana- pATHis of the four vedas from the twin cities and surrounding areas.

The sabha shall consist of seven rounds, each round covering one ashTaka of the Krishna Yajur Veda. In each round, the President and Vice-president start with a 'panasa' which is then continued by other scholars reciting the next panasa in pairs and so on till all the attending scholars get a turn. At the end of each round, scholars of other branches of Vedas recite appropriate selections from those particular branches. Normally this format is followed to test vedic students and award the successful candidates with certificates of proficiency and hence the name. The practice in AP is that in each district such examining councils are convened once every year. The present council does not count - in popular perception, or acceptance by temples etc. - as an examining council but follows the same format.

Lunch shall be served between 12:00 noon and 2:30 pm.

All those interested are welcome.

N. Siva Senani
