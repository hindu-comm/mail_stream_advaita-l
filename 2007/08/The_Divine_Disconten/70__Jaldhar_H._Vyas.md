That type of sadhana can also have problems.  It can degenerate into 
narcissism (See Indra and Virochana in Chandogyopanishad.)

Rather ones attitude to God should be that expressed in the first rk of 
Ishopanishad.  "All of this is pervaded by the Lord, what is in the world 
and beyond it."  This feeling naturally leads to vairagya as expressed by 
the rest of the rk.  "Do not covet for whose indeed is wealth?" (It is 
Ishvaras not ours.)
