The Divine Discontent

Spiritual hunger means thirst for God's Darshan. Spiritual hunger is the
ultimate meaning of every activity in life. The dissatisfaction and the
necessities of the life show that everyone, unconsciously, does suffer from
spiritual hunger and it is not appeased until the Spirit within is realised.
Without this divine discontent there is no real progress.

dissatisfaction and restlessness that remain even after obtaining all the
necessities of life show that everyone, consciously or unconsciously, does
