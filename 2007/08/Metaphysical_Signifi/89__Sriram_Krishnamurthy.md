Metaphysical Significance of Man
Intellect can move only in a vicious circle of possibilities. It hovers
round an object: deeper, it can never go. It cannot enter into, and be one
with it; and be it noted, without complete identity, knowledge is
impossible. Intellect accepts the evidence of the senses and the result of
inference, but it rejects as spurious the deepest subjective intuitions.
Profound insight tells us that there is something more in man than is
apparent in his ordinary consciousness; something which originates all
thoughts and emotions, a finer spiritual presence which keeps him ever
dissatisfied with mere earthly pursuits. The doctrine that the ordinary
condition of man is not his final state, that he has a deeper self, an
immortal Spirit, a light that can never be extinguished, has the longest
highest intellectual ancestry.
