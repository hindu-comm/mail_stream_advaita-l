This is with reference to the Email of Sri.S.N.Sastri (August 9,2007)
regarding "Naishkarmyasiddhi"of Sureshwaracharya.There is a book by
Prof.SS.Raghavachar published by "Prasaranga"of University of Mysore.There
is also the book by Prof.Hiriyanna.These two books are authentic and no
where it is stated in the slokas that Jnana has to be combined with action
or Dhyana for realisation.Sureshwaracharya discusses elaborately that
Jnana cannot be combined with any auxiliary practice.
