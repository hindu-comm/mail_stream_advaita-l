Man: His Divine Destiny

Be men among subhuman beings, the immortals among mortals, gods among
saints, and one with the Supreme Lord amongst all gods. Know
yourselves and shine in your native Light. This is your glorious
destiny. The poetic genius, the religious genius, the philosophic
genius are all but faint flashes of the inner Light latent in your own
heart.
