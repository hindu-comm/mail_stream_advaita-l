Writings of Ananda Coomaraswamy are an excellent resource for such 
comparative study; one book that
particularly covers your interest is "Buddha and the Gospel of Buddhism", 
published by Munshiram Manoharlal (ISBN: 81-215-0096-6, Amazon link: 
http://www.amazon.com/Buddha-Gospel-Buddhism-Ananda-Coomaraswamy/dp/1846647398/ref=sr_1_3/102-8375464-6942508?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1187191432&sr=1-3 
).

Part III of the book focuses on Vedanta, Samkhya, Yoga and 'Buddhism and 
Brahminism'.

Hope this helps.

Best,
Murali Manohar
