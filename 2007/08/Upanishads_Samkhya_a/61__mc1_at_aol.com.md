The Upanishads, Samkhya and BUddhism are three of the earliest and individually most seminal sources of Indian wisdom. I am interested in aspects of Buddhism that have grown out of the earlier two systems - ideas that might have given birth to early Buddhist categories of thought. For instance, karma and rebirth, whatever their origins, gave rise to these concepts within Buddhism albeit with intention as a substantial difference and allusions to nonduality was seen in the Creation Myth of the Vedas. 

Might any of our revered subscribers suggest additional concepts or know of any easily available study on this topic. Thanks. -michael chandra
