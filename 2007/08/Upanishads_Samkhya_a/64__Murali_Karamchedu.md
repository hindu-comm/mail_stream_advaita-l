Wikipedia has a fairly good writeup on Coomaraswamy 
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ananda_Coomaraswamy ), although if I remember 
correctly from biographical essays  by Durairajasingam and Rama Coomarasway, 
he was a geologist by training (just to nitpick! ).

I agree that his interpretation is sometimes idiosyncratic, particularly the 
way he approaches punarjanmA, for example in his essay on 'Time and 
Eternity'; but I never got the impression that he did not read the primary 
sources. If anything, his writings are overdone with references and 
footnotes to sources. Is there any particular reason that you would draw 
that conclusion? Just curious.

Best,
Murali Manohar
