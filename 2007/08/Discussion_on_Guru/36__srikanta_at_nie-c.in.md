In his Email of August 2,Kathiresan writes that,"Guru"is one's own and not
a general commodity.There are tow types of Gurus.One is "Bodhka Guru" who
is teaching,the other is "chodaka"Guru,who is in every one's heart.If we
follow only the :bodhaka"Gur,he can take you only upto a certain point.He
canno make the horse to drink water.They may also be misguided if one
doesnot have a strong conviction about himself.The"Samithu"which is
mentioned by Kathresan is not literally the "Twigs" from the Banyan
tree.In the olden days,the Rishis used to keep the fire alight.The seeker
has to conventionally carry a bunch of these twigs,to signify that he is
offering to the fire all his propensities born out of ignorance.You have
the right to follow any Guru you have mentioned,and ultimately,it should
be seen that you are benefitted and not the Guru.
