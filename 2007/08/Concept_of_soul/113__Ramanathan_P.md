The way this thread ended for Mahesh-ji appeared
amazing but I had not read through the conversations
carefully enough to see what all the talk was about.
But in this email, it seems more in line with what I
imagined.

The domains of science and religion are not the same.
In Vedanta, the primary conclusion of Advaita is what
sustains its proposed spiritual concepts regarding the
nature of gross and subtle realms. So Vedanta's
consideration of the gross is not for its own purpose
but to show the path to Brahma-jnana. This latter
point is what Sri Ramakrishna is also emphasizing. If
this is really understood, then it will be clear that
Vedanta has always a candid look at its own
gross-world descriptions. At one point, they may be
emphasized and finally they may be called eulogy. For
they deal with maya.

Given the intent of Vedanta, it has its own way of
going beyond the gross realm, and that again is
reflected in Sri Ramakrishna's example. If the
scripture says 100000 leaves, the emphasis ('fresh
look') of it being 100001 in truth is irrelevant;
accept either if you feel it necessary, then go beyond
the counting. Such concepts are maya/superimposition
to begin with, and to argue over the dream is due to
ignorance. That is why Bhagavatpada's vision
accomodates for the dualist and the ritualist and the
scientist, giving each person's beliefs full validity
(for that practisioner) at the relative level but
emphasizing their non-validity from the absolute
standpoint. He does not care to get each fighting with
the other; rather do your counting and get beyond.
