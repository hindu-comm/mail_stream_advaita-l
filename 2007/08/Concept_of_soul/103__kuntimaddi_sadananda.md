Maheshji - PraNAms

The basic understanding is 'Life' pulsates when the
upaadhis are conducive. This is true any where in the
universe, not necessarily only on this earth.

Second understanding from Vedanta point is any
conducive environment is nothing but the union of the
subtle and gross bodies. Subtle bodies are anaadi or
beginning less - that is how Krishna starts his
GeetOpadesha. End of subtle body occurs when there is
no karma left. Adhyaasa or error is when the
antahkaraNa is taken as real rather than just
reflected consciousness. 

Third understanding that follows is death is when the
subtle body leaves the gross body. Ch. Up provides a
detailed description of how subtle body travels and
take up life as baby through father to mother as it
enters the world. The very conception is the beginning
of 'Life' where the gross body has become conducive
for subtle body to take its roots. If it aborted it
only means that subtle body has to find another host
to settle! - same story as benign cells that you
mentioned. 

Now you can apply these principles to either cancer
cells that are living or dead, or bacteria living or
dead, or even to virus, living or dead, or to the new
cells that scientists have assembled, whether they
become alive or dead. The story is the same. Subtle
body enters when the upaadhis or gross cells or
assemblage of the cells.  This is true whether the
cells are 'so-called' natural by mutation or arising
from infection or 'so-called' man-made which are
nothing but assemblage using what is available.  In
principle there is no creation other than assemblage
of what is there since any thing new is violation of
law of conservation propounded by Lord Krishna - that
which is non-existent cannot come into existence and
that which exists cannot cease to exist. All creation
is just assemblage and destruction is dissembling,
since they are fundamentally made of parts,
amShatvaat. Consciousness is niramshaH, therefore
indestructible. 

You can apply these principles to any cells - benign
or not. The story is the same. 

The reason the subtle bodies exists is due to karma,
says Vedanta. They are beginningless since the
fundamental cause is ignorance which is anaadi. The
whole creation, so called man made or god-made is
essentially due to this karma which is due to
ignorance. Subtle bodies will find a gross body that
is determined by kaaraNa Shariira (vaasanaas) which is
nothing but karma in subtle form. Hence Krishna
defines karma in Ch. 8. as that which is the cause for
creation. 

I know you question does not pertain directly to all
the above -  I am providing in general sense so that
you can apply to all the cases you mentioned. The
vedantic model is self-consistent and factual as I
take myself what I am not identifying myself with the
subtle body which assumes different gross bodies -
like 'vaasamsi jiirNaani yathaa vihaaya' - that is the
fundamental truth - valid for all 'Life' forms-
starting from virus. 

With this I take leave from this topic since I have
stated all that I understand. 

By the by kuntimaddi is village name in Andhra.  For
some reason my father named me as Sadananda - He must
have good reason.

Hari Om!
Sadananda
