Pranams Ramesh-ji and all who helped clarify this concept for me:

On independent continued discussions with the aforementioned disciple of
Swami Parthasarthy, we seem to have come to same conclusion as Ramesh-ji.

My problem was w.r.t a group of cells that are removed from my body, grown
in a culture and replaced back in my body. In this case, the cells were
initially under the purview of a my subtle body, assumed independent subtle
bodies when in the culture and then again seemed to return to my own subtle
body. This seemed like an abberation of sorts. The merger/demerger that
Ramesh-ji talked about.

The disciple's example to solve this (she no longer thought it was time to
"switch theories") was a little easier to understand as compared to
Ramesh-ji's . Break a twig from a tree, plant it in soil till it grows for
some time and then regraft it back into the tree. If one can accept that
this does not violate the principle of subtle bodies then neither should the
cell example.

So from my side, this thread stands closed.

Thanks to all again for your kind help and patience, Mahesh
