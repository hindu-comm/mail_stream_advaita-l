Namaste,

This will be my last post in this thread.

"jIva-soul", and "cell-soul" are different 
stages in the evolution of a soul. 

If a soul can be associated with a stone,
associaton with a cell is certainly a higher
stage. In cell it has association with some
form of jnanendriya-s and karmendriya-s.
In in-animate objects karmendriya-s are
completely missing, at best very very 
rudimentary jnanendriya may be available.

Regards,
Shrinivas
