Pranams Kuntimaddi!

Thanks for your explanation but I don't think you have addressed my concern
adequately.

1. What happens when some cells are extraced from your body as a tissue
culture or suitably preserved while outside you. The individual cells of
this culture continue to exhibit the same behavior as when they were in your
body. They are living without the enlivining principle of your subtle body.
According to your explanation, how is that possible?

2. Why do you differentiate between bacteria (prokaryote) and other cells
in your body (eurkaryote). They are both living. Why does one have its own
subtle body while the other not?

Thanks, Mahesh
