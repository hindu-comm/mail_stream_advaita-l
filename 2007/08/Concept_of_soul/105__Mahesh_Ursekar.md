Pranams Shyam-ji:

First off, let me address some of your concerns about "sensationalizing that
research". I was afraid of the same and so I had already done some basic
spadework. One of the scientists mentioned in my article link, Jack Szostak,
is associated with Harvard Medical School - a reputed institution. The
other, Mark Bedau, has considerable publications in an area called
Artificial Life - something we are talking about here (
http://www-users.cs.york.ac.uk/susan/bib/nf/b/markabed.htm).

As per your very pertinent question as to what is life, I agree that is hard
to answer. I have been thinking along the same lines too. I came up with a
working definition "something that can grow and reproduce (i.e. create more
of its kind)" is life. The cell that is being created falls into this
category.

Lastly, like you, I agree that Vedanta is supremely elegant, fullfilling and
profound (otherwise I wouldn't be on this list). I also agree that it does
not have a quarrel with science or for that matter any other discipline. The
orignal post was to resolve certain holes that arise in Vedantic (or for
that matter any religious) thought when we attempt to define the concept of
the soul. The whole point was to remove my doubts by sharing this
information with the more knowledable members on this list.

Thanks, Mahesh
