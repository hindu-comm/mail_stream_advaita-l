Dear Sri Vishwaji,

I have said and I quote: "Sookshma sareeram can exist without sthoola
sareeram but cannot exist without
kaaraNa sareeram.  KaaraNa sareeram can exist without sookshma sareeram but
needs
praana to sustain it."  If you look closely you would understand that these
three entities (sookshma sareeram, kaaraNa sareeram and praaNa) are together
when they enter and leave the body because it is the sookshma sareeram that
transmigrates.  If we separate each of them to have a clear understanding of
each, then sookshma sareeram is nothing but the gods of organs (without whom
the organs of the gross body (sthoola sareeram) would not function.  For
example in a dead body the eyes are perfect however they cannot see for the
gods who man them have left.

As I said before, all the three sareerams are inert and 'life and death'
belong to them.  The sentience without which these bodies have no existence
is beyond their reach (but depend on the sentience for their functioning)
and is actually called jeeva (microcosm) or Easwara (macrocosm) as they are
looked at differently. The Sentience per se (Brahman) is the beyond and is
actually anirvachaneeya.  Since there is nothing apart from Brahman, Easwara
is known as Saguna Brahman.

The advocates of micro and macro frankensteins do not understand that they
are only talking of inert things even when they refer to 'life'.

Regards,
Anbu
