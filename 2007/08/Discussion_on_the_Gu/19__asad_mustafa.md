In the name of God, most gracious, most merciful.

  Thanks Mr. Jaldhar for your very informative post. 

  I have not read much about Ramakrishna. However, I have read a few lectures by Vivekananda and I think he talks advaita - not tantra rituals. He does not have the clarity or the style of Ramana, yet I do not think that he represents any sect other than advaita.

  Jazakallah
