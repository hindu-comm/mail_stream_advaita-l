Dear Werlings,

Please read Gospel of Ramakrishna completely.  We are not competent enough
to criticize / censure / comment on evolved souls like Sri Ramakrishna. Sri
Ramakrishna was initiated into Nirguna Brahman meditation by a follower of
Shankara sampradaya named Sri Totapuri.

Om Tat Sat,
Sriram
