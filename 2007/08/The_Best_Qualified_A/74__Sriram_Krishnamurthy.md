The Best Qualified Aspirant
The uttama adhikari, who is, ever ardent, silent and serene due to the dawn
of proper knowledge, ever the same among the diverse men of the world,
undisturbed by the distracted activities of the workaday world, calm and
peaceful, withdrawn himself from the bustle of life, unmindful of what is
happening on earth, disinterested either in this or that, indifferent to the
pleasures of a so-called successful life-that is really fit indeed to
receive the ultimate Wisdom of the Lord and the Truth. Even if there is the
slightest desire lurking inside other than for the realisation of the
Divine, that person will not be able to comprehend the true import of the
Upanishadic teachings or the instruction by the spiritual teacher. He will
have thousand doubts and distractions in the mind that make impossible all
spiritual activity.

Om Tat Sat,
Sriram
