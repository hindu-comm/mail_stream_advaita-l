An Integral Study of Man
Man is not merely a biological phenomenon. There is in him a psychical
apparatus packed with latent potentialities, power and possibilities;
saints, prophets and Yogis are a living proof of this fact. A philosophical
insight into the psychical being of man drives us into believing in the
reality, to the Cosmic Consciousness of the Divine Life Force as the basis,
as the life of psychical entities. We need to understand man not only at his
biological and mental, but at his psychical and spiritual levels
