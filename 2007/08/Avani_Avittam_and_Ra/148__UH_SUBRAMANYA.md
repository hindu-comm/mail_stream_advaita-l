Sarvebhyo Namaha!
The Revered Shankara has stated in the Gita Bhashya- Peetikha "
"BrahmaNatvasya hi rakshaNena rakShitaha syat vaidiko Dharmaha. 
Tadadheenatvat varNAshrama BhedAnAm"
meaning
" The Vaidika Dharma is protected  by protecting  Brahmanism only. The 
difference in four Varnashramas is under control of Brahminism"
Hence it is necessary that all Brahmins should do Upakarma as well as nitya 
Naimittika Karmas like Sandhavandana, Pooja etc as enumerated by Shankara 
himself " Vedo Nityam AdhIyatam, Taduditam karmasvanushtIyatAm, to be in 
Brahminism. This is further reinforced by the following Shloka
" Janmana Shudro JayatE SamskarAt Dvija UchyatE, Vedavittu VipraHa 
BrhmajnAttu Brahmanah"
Regards,
Subramanya UH

Subject: [Advaita-l] Avani Avittam and Raksha Bandhan Greetings to all


> *RAKSHA BANDHAN* is called Avani Avittam in South India. This falls on the
> full moon day of the month of Sravan (August-September). It is an 
> important
> Hindu festival. Hindus wear a new holy thread and offer libations of water
> to the ancient Rishis on this day.
>
> Recitation of the *Vedas *on this great day is highly beneficial. This
> festival is also known as Upakarmam, and is specially sacred to the
> Brahmins, who have been invested with the sacred thread.
>
> When a Brahmin boy is invested with this thread, symbolically his third 
> eye,
> or the eye of wisdom, is opened. The holy festival of Upakarmam reminds 
> one
> who wears the sacred thread of its glorious spiritual significance. 
> Brahmins
> also offer libations of water to their ancestors, to whom they owe their
> birth; to the great Rishis, to whom they are highly indebted for their
> spiritual knowledge; and to the *Vedas *themselves. The true Hindu never
> forgets his benefactors!
>
> The followers of the four different *Vedas *have their Upakarmam on
> different days.
>
> On this day, Sachi, the consort of Indra, tied a holy thread or amulet
> around the wrist of Indra, when he was defeated by the demons. Then Indra,
> the king of gods, gained victory over the demons by the power of this
> protection (Raksha means "protection"). He then recovered the lost city of
> Amaravati.
>
> In North India, on this day, an amulet known as a Raksha or Rakhi, is tied
> round the wrist of brothers by the sisters as a protection from evil 
> during
> the coming year. Brahmins and Purohits similarly tie amulets round the
> wrists of their patrons and receive gifts. A Mantra is recited when the
> Rakhi or the silken thread is tied. The silken thread is charged with the
> power of the Mantra, which is as follows:
>
> Yena baddho balee raajaa daanavendro mahaabalah;
>
> Tena twaam anubadhnaami rakshey maa chala maa chala.
>
> "I am tying on your hand this Raksha, with which the most powerful and
> generous King Bali himself was bound; O Raksha, don't go away; don't go
> away."
> The power of this Mantra protects the wearer from evil influences.
>
> Om Tat Sat,
> Sriram
