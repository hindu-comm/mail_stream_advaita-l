This is with reference to Dr.Yadu Mohrir's Email on the above topic.While
it is true that the sruthi cannot tell everything,one has got the sense to
follow Dharma and eschew adharma.'Dharmo raksati raksitah"is the popular
saying.That is,If one safeguards the "Dharma",then 'Dharma"will rescue
him.This is followed in all other religions,like Buddhism and Jainism.Just
like we have the right to live,other beings also have the right to
live."Dharma" in the wider sense means "being".If one has the audacity to
violate this principle,then one pays for it.This is the cardinal
principle,nay, the fundamental principle one has to follow above all other
purusharthas.If one goes about following the Artha and the kama without
caring for others suffering that is wrought by the man who violates
it,then he is bound to pay for it.This is not only for the righteous
living but also he is bound to incur sin.All religions are equivocal in
this declaration.
