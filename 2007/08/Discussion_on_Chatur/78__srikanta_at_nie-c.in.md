With reference to the above,I would like to add that,without knowing
"dharma" which means the Ashrama Dharma as
Brahmachari,Gruhastha,Vanaprastha it is not possible to reach the
"Sannyasa"order(which is the qualification for Moksha)for the common
people.Hence the sastras prescibe the stages.The socalled "Vividisha
Sannyasa" is for the Sarvakarma sannyasi.Sri.Shankara in his Brahmasutra
Bhashya says that it is possible to start Jnanakhanda without going
through the Karmakhanda if one possesses the qualifications of
Shama,dhamadi shatkasampatti.It is not also possible to know about the
Moksha without knowing the why and wherefore of it.
