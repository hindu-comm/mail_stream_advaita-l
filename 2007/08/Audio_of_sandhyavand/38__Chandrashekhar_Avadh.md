Shri S.V Subrahmanian,

Is there any chance of getting the sandhyavandana mantras for dakSiNa
Andhra sampradAya yajur veda in mp3 or other format?  I know the tamil
method whereas my son has been taught in dakSiNa Andhra sampradAya (We
recently conducted his Upanayanam. We are mulakanadu telugu Brahmins).
Although he has picked up the exact sequence and is able to recite the
mantras to a large extent with the help of a one time demonstration by
the shastrilu (duly captured on video) and a book in dakSiNa Andhra
sampradAya in Sanskrit, the flow of mantras with the due pauses and
pronunciations is missing since the Shastrilu recited the slokas word by
word. My son now needs the flow of mantras with the correct pauses and
pronunciations. I have searched all the leading audio shops in Chennai
for the same but could not get one. Can you help?

Regards,

A.Chandrashekhar
