Dear Sri Sastri,

May I make a suggestion? The contact information for the Sanskrit
department at the Mahatma Gandhi Institute in Mauritius is given in the
following website.
http://mgi.intnet.mu/academic_struct/sans_dept.html. It would carry
significant weight if you contacted Dr. Roodurmun directly and brought
his attention to the error in the book, rather than anybody else.  

With namaskaras,
Vidyasankar
