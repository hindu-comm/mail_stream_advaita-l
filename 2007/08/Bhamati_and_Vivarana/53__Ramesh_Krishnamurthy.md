Sir, please read Sri Sastri's mail carefully. Sri Sastri has been
pointing out errors in the book by PS Roodurmun. PS Roodurmun
incorrectly states that Sureshvaracharya supports
jnAna-karma-samuccaya, whereas the correct position is that
Sureshvaracharya rejects jnAna-karma-samuccaya in the
naiShkarmyasiddhi
