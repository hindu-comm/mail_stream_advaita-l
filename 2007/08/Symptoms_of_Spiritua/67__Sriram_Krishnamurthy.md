Symptoms of Spiritual Adolescence
Man seeks in the accomplishment of ambitious projects the happiness that he
feels he is in need of. But he finds that worldly greatness when secured, is
a delusion and a snare; he doubtless does not find any happiness or peace in
it. He gets degrees, diplomas, titles, honour, power, name, fame; he
marries; he begets children; in short he gets all that he supposes would
give him happiness. But he finds no rest. Pious men, saints and sages
declare that this restlessness of every man-this state of discontent,
dissatisfaction and uncomfortable-ness, of being ill at ease with himself
and his surroundings is solely due to the loss of the companionship with the
Infinite Reality, and an occult urge towards it.
