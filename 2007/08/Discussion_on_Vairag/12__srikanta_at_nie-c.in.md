This is with reference to Sri Anbu's Email on the above topic.He writes
that the "Samith"which is referred to is the dried Banyan twigs to signify
that the desires have dried up.This is not correct.A seeker approaches a
Guru because he does not know how to free himself from the desires.The
Mundakopanishath sruthi says"nasti akrtam krtena".Hence he is still in the
ajnana avastha.In the olden days those who are following the Karma
Khanda(the meemamsakas)used to offer offerings to the fire to propitiate
the Gods.The offering is a stage in Upasana.He only who gets the Vairagya
approaches a Guru.It does not also follow that all will approach a
Guru.The wise ones like Ramana had no Guru.In the Bhagavad Gita Bhagavan
says:Lokesmin dvidha nishta pura prokta mayanagha!
     Jnanayogena Sankhyanam karmayogena yoginam!!
Also,the Jnana does not occur to every seeker in the same way.Just as a
person who boards a train has his own destination,the person gets
enlightened in that way.Once enlightened,it is his own.
