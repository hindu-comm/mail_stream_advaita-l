Shree Subramanian, PraNAms

Thanks for correcting my misunderstanding.  What you
said is correct, I have provided a free translation to
indicate that one cannot identify a BrahmanishTa from
looking at external factors.  Shotriam of course would
be recognized when he talks. As per Mundaka Up. sloka
the guru should be both shotriam and brahmanishhTa.
The spirit of the statement is one cannot evaluate
Guru from his looks as I was responding to statement
regarding dishonest gurus floating around. 

Anyway your point is well taken and I understand my
misunderstanding that you have noted.


Hari Om!
Sadananda
