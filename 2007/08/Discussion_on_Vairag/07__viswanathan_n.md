Namaste


While going thru this posting regarding one thing really struck me.
""Day after day countless people die. Yet the living wish to live
forever. O Lord, what can be  greater wonder?"
I think this can certainly be viewes  from the other angle.
Day after day we keep seeing other people die. True. But has anyone ever 
seen him'self' Dying???
No...No one can, because the Self never dies. When self never dies how it 
can watch its own death. So what we are seeing as others dying is mere 
illusion. Like wise the birth too, no one has seen his own birth.(whether it 
is the even of comming out of mother's womb or the conception itself)
When you understand this, ie, both birth and death are mere illusions, how 
can you gat attched to anything? When there is no sort of attachment where 
is the question of Vairagya and what for??
