In the name of God, most gracious, most merciful.

I am surprised that no one has mentioned Ramana's direct method of enquiry as his practice. Ramana repeatedly asks for calling the bluff of ego through constant enquiry instead of relying on rituals. Isn't the whole point of advaita shedding the illusion of duality created by ego? As Persian sufi master Hafez puts it:

  "..you are your own veil Hafez.
  get out of the way."

  Jazakallah
