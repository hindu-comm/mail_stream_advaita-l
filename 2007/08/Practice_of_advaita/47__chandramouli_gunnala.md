Dear Atmaswaroopa, Om Namonarayanaya,

Delighted to see your mail. Shatkam gives a meaning of
six slokas. Each sloka has four lines or stanzas.
The referred line is in the 5th sloka (second line)/
18th line from starting.
 Sorry for the communication gap, if any. 
 Hope that this clarification would sort out thing to
your satisfaction.

In the service of the Lord, 
Gunnala C.
