Sree Ramesh - PraNAms

Just for info.  Shreeman Vedanta Deshika was the one
who formulated VishiShTaadvaita on a firmer basis. He
represents VaDahalai sampradaaya and is respected
throughout. He was around 15th Century, if I remember
correctly.  The sataduuShaNii is more polemical work
and does not attack any individuals. The book is
similar to Advaita Siddhi of Madhusuudana Saraswati.
An English version, not necessarily in the same
format, is done by Shreeman S.M.S. Chari entitled
"Advaita -VishiShTaadvaita" one can get this book on
line.  According to Chari maama, Shree Ananta Krishna
Shastri has written ShatabhuuShaNii - but in stead of
taking one by one objection, Shree Shastriji has given
general description of Advaita Philosophy. Shree
Shastriji has written extensive commentary on Vedanta
Paribhaasha of Dharmaraja Advarin. A glimpse of that
work you can see in book of Prof. Bina Gupta on
'Perceptions in Advaita Vedanta', which can be
downloaded. 

Taking a particular philosophy as puurva paksha is
standard method of philosophical discussions.  There
is nothing wrong with that.  Bhagavaan Ramanuja's Sree
bhAShya on Brahmasuutras where he takes Advaita as
puurva paksha is worth studying.  There are seven
untenables against avidya concept of advaita Vedanta.
Dr. Grimes has taken up this as part of his Ph.D
thesis.  

What you are complaining is personal attack by many of
Dvaitins  trying to repeat some of the arguments from
B.N. Sarma's book. I found SarmaÂ’s book it very hard
to read.   

I agree with Vidya that personal attacks are bellow
ones dignity and are not worth responding to. We had
one Shree J N who was making fool of himself by silly
arguments and was thrown out of this list as well as
advaitin list. It is better to ignore these rattling
noises than to give importance to them.


Hari Om!
