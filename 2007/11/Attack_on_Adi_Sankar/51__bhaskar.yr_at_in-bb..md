As we say in kannaDa "durahankArakke udAsInavE maddu"
-can be translated as "Indifference is the right
medicine for ego bloats"(bad ego - literally).

praNAms prabhuji
Hare Krishna

That is nicely put...it reminds me one more saying in Kannada (bit harsh
but appropriate for those who  indulge in this type of activity )...*naayi
bogaLidare dEvalOka haaLe* Yes, there are numerous diluted texts which
downplay the doctrine of advaita & bhagavatpAda in a very cheap
manner...but how does it matter??  gaudapAda in his kArika beautifully
says,  it hardly affects the mahut / gaja if a street dog barks  at the
height & majesty of elephant...( I donot remember the exact quote )...

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
