** Many descriptions of advaita-vedAnta start by assuming a
cause-effect relationship between brahman and the world, only to
negate it later. The 2nd brahmasUtra "janmAdyasya yataH" is an example
of this.

Such a preliminary assumption is quite natural & useful, but if one
persists with it for too long, one may "get lost in the forest".
Personally, I feel that elaborate discussions on various kinds of
causality are a potentially risky diversion. They are probably more
relevant for debates with other schools.

Ramesh
