>namaste... dear sri ramesh, could you please elaborate on the excerpt
below, for our benefit. 'What does the mithyatva of
>causality lead to? ajAtivAda. One can explain ajAtivAda without ever
taking recourse to causal models such as
>pariNAmavAda & vivartavAda.' pranams. ...prem 

If I may jump in here with a short comment :

Indeed, ajAti-vAda can be described without pariNAma or vivarta models.
But if we start from either pariNAma or vivarta model of causality and
if we understand the mithyAtva of causality correctly, then we are
clearly led to ajAti-vAda 

Best regards,
