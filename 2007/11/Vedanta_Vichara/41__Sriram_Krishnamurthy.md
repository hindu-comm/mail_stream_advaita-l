Hi all,

Source of the article : Swami Sivananda.

Vedanta Vichara
Hard thinking, persistent thinking, clear thinking, thinking to the very
roots of all problems, grappling with the fundamentals of all intellectual
situations, a firm grasp of and penetration into the very presuppositions of
all thought and experience, is the essence of Vedantic sadhana. Deep
thinking necessitates a taking of recourse to intense Sadhana. A subtle,
calm, clear, pure, sharp, one-pointed intelligence is needed for
understanding and meditating on the goal of the boldest of all philosophical
efforts: Brahman.

Om Tat Sat,
Sriram
