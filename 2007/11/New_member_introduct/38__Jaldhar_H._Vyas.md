First of all my prostrations to the Adhi Guru!


I belong to the Angirasa-Bharahaspathya-Bharadwaja lineage, Bharadwaja
gothra, Drahyayana sutra, having Sama veda as the main veda for adhyayan and
having Sriram as name.

I have got the deep thirst to drink the nectar.

Can you please provide me an opportunity to lead myself from darkness to
light?

Regards,
Advaita Vedantist
