Name: R.Ashok
Age: 31
Country of residence: India

Background/Interests: belong to smartha tradition by birth and am keen in 
convincing myself of the purpose of human life. Believe that Sri Sri 
Sankara's teaching and exponentiation of the Vedas would help me realise 
what is needed. Though I am not fit to be called as a devotee of Sri Sri 
Chandrasekara Bharathi swamigal, would like to make myself fit to be one 
of them.

Dharmo rakshathi rakshitahah,
Ashok
