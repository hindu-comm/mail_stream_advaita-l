This is regarding Vidyasankar's point about modern scientific
theories. There is the concept of svarUpa lakShaNa that SrI Kuntimaddi
Sadananda often refers to, and which was also the basis of the long
post on mithyA that I had sent some time back.

Now, if science were to establish such a thing as a fundamental
indivisible particle, would not the absence of svarUpa lakShaNa for
objects be compromised? How important is the absence of svarUpa
lakShaNa for objects in establishing the mithyatva of causality and
hence the truth of advaita?
