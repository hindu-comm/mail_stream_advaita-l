The emphasis of the sad vidya is sad vidya only and
not on sRiShTi. The discussion started with the
question by Uddalaka how 'eka vijnaane sarva vijnaanam
bhavati' - discussion is with the emphasis on kaarya
kaaraNa samaanaadhikaraNa - knowing the cause one can
know all the effects orginated from that cause. 

 Hence creation is brought in to show that Sat is the
cause for all creation - more importantly that sat is
nothing but you - tat tvam asi and the whole creation
is just 'vaachaarambhanam vikaaro naamadheyaH' to
emphasize the mithyaa aspect of the creation. In fact
the vaachaarambhanam statement provides a strong sRiti
statement for the world to be mithyaa.   The details
of creation emphasizes only the grosser elements
leaving out aakaasha and vaayu, which are more subtle.


Hari Om!
