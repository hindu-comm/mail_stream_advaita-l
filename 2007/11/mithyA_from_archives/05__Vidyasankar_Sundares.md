The chAndogya upanishat, in the sadvidyA section (dialogue between uddAlaka and his son), talks of a division of three elements into parts and intermixing of these parts. This is called trivRtkaraNa. In his bhAshya on this upanishad, Sankara bhagavatpAda explains, in two powerful short sentences, exactly how the pancIkaraNa theory applies in brahmajijnAsA. "pancIkaraNe 'pi samAno nyAya iti. ..." The "samAna nyAya" is with respect to trivRtkaraNa, which is given in Sruti. The reason pancIkaraNa is brought in here is to arrive at samanvaya of the various accounts of creation in the different texts.

And if one reads the pancIkaraNa work itself, one realizes that the emphasis is not really on 'explaining' the process of creation. Rather, the idea is to use the pancIkaraNa theory as a take-off point for teaching a meditation on the praNava, very much in line with mANDUkya upanishat.

Best regards,
Vidyasankar
