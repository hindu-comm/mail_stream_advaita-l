This is with reference to the discussion on mithyatva,fundamental
particles,waking state,dream state and the deeepsleep state.In his
Brahmasutra bhashya Sankara examines in detail the different
theories:Sankhya,Vaisesika,Nyaya,Yoga,jaina,Buddhist schools of thought
and refutes that none of these theories are tenable.in the
Mandukyopanishath karikas Gaudapada also follows the systematic approach
of examining all the theories and points out the "Anirvachaniya" concept
of the Atman.The fundamental particles,the various states are true from
the vyavaharika plane only.As long as one is dealing with the vyavaharika
plane they are true in the trasactions,like the Maya hasti(magic
elephant)in the karika.All the states are superimpositions on the brahman
like the rope on the snake.
