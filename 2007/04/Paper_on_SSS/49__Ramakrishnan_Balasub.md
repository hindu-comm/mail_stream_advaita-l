Good point! What I meant by observer in this context was the ego or
the internal organ, as I tried to make clear with some examples.
Indeed the ego itself is the observed, as pointed out by the example
given by me from the Naishkarmya Siddhi. As you point out, using
"observer" is misleading since, aatman is the saakShi, and I myself
use it in that sense in some other places. Very sloppy writing on my
part! I will correct that. I should really be saying that the
superimposition of the ego, or something like that. Let me think about
how to phrase it better. I am going to be off on work the next week,
but if I get a chance, I'll correct that and upload a new version.

Thanks!

Rama
