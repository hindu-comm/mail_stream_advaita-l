To mark Shankara jayanti I have been busy making some changes to the web 
site.  Some of this is boring, behind-the-scenes stuff like upgrading the 
operating system etc. but some maybe of interest to readers.

I have uploaded all the parts of Shri K. Ramakrishnas introduction to 
Advaita Vedanta series.  It can be accessed at 
http://www.advaita-vedanta.org/kramakrishna/

The Mullavaisal Heritage Trust has made available an English translation 
by Shri S.N. Shastriji of Shri Mani Dravid Shastrijis lectures on the 
Adhyasa bhashya -- the most important part of Shankaracharyas 
brahmasutrabhashya.  It can be downloaded in PDF format from 
http://www.advaita-vedanta.org/mullaivasal/mani_dravid_lectures.html

A while back, our own Anand Hudli posted on the list a translation of the 
chandrashekharashtakam.  It is now available from 
http://www.advaita-vedanta.org/texts/

I hope you find this useful and if you have any suggestions please let me 
know.
