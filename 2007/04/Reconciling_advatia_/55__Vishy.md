"The minute I heard my first love story
I started looking for you,
not knowing 
how blind that I was

Lovers don't finally meet somewhere 
They're in each other all along"

  Excellent one......    That's why I always feel sufis are nearer to the truth (Advaitic) than many other Hindu sects.

Rumi has a take on this that members may find
interesting:

"The minute I heard my first love story
I started looking for you,
not knowing 
how blind that I was

Lovers don't finally meet somewhere 
They're in each other all along"

Jazakallah
