namaste...

  dear sri vidyasankarji,

  down below is part of your last post on the subject.

  the 'chit' / 'chaitanya' referred to by you below, are they the same as the 'chit' in
  'sat- chid-ananda'. if so i require some help by way of elaboration. in addition
  references to brahma sutra bhashya would help me read further.

  thanks & best regards,

  pranam.

  ...prem

of purushottama is still qualified by kshara and akshara, cit and acit, jaDa 
and caitanya; and it is therefore always sa-viSesha (qualified by the 
above).

Best regards,
Vidyasankar
