You are saying that bhAvarUpa adhyAsa has as its kAraNam an
abhAvarUpa aGYAna. This is strange for two reasons:

1) It seems that a real effect (bhAvarUpa adhyAsa) can arise out of
an unreal cause (abhAvarUpa aGYAna). This is not what advaita
teaches, AFAIK.

2) This is out-of-sync with traditional AchAryas who teach that
aGYAna is bhAvarUpa -- see for example the series posting by Anand at
http://www.advaita-vedanta.org/archives/advaita-l/2007-March/019127.html
in this regard.

Can you please cite the references/sources for your information?

This again contradicts the Sringeri AchAryas' teachings on aGYAna,
where aGYAna is said to be the upAdAna kAraNam of adhyAsa -- with
support from Sruti. Please refer to Anand's posting above.

It would be great if you can provide references from the
Sruti/smRRiti/bhAshhyas for your statements.
