Namaste,

   My spiritual name is Satya and I receive this name from Ajati/ George 
Macavei a Romanian Advaita teacher that lives in Tirunnamavalai. His guru 
is Swami Shantananda Puri. I spent some weeks in Tiru last year, attending 
Swami Shuddhananda Advaita courses and my intention is to stay as much as 
I can in each year in order to receive more and more advaita knowledge. My 
favourites are Shankaracharya and Ramana Maharshi. My special texts are 
Mandukia Karika, Viveka Chudamani, Avadhut Gita and many other beautiful 
and deep texts.


   My birth name is Daniela Porutiu, I'm 42 years old, I'm from Romania, 
I'm Finance Manager into a multinational Japanese company called Yazaki. I 
started by practicing yoga at 25 years old with an Indian Guru in Romania. 
Currently I feel that Advaita is the ultimate knowledge in order to reach 
the Truth and I establish myself in Advaita.
