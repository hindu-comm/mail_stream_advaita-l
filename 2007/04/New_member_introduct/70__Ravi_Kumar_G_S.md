Dear learned friends,

I have a slightly unrelated request: I am learning to chant Rudra-Chamaka
and other Veda Mantras from an Acharya, and would like to supplement it with
listening to the chants while on the go. Could you please direct me to a
website/label that provides vedic chants in downloadable mp3 versions?

Grateful thanks and Pranaams
