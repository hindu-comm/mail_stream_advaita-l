if you are in chennai, you may check out the ahobila maTha oriental
school in west mAmbalam where kids undergo vedAdhyanana almost
everyday in addition to their laukIka studies. while i was doing my
undergrads at chennai, i underwent adhyayana of certain parts of the
taittirIya samhitA there and based on my experience there, i can
assure you that they do a very good job. they have vedAdhyayana twice
a day, in the mornings from 04:30 to 07:00 hrs and in the afternoons
from 15:30 to 18:00 hrs and the training is pretty rigorous. they
study regular subjects during the day. the vedAdhyayana typically
starts when the kids are about 8-10 years old (immediately after their
upanayana) and it takes about 6 years to complete one veda completely.
most kids do complete adhyayana of the veda to which they belong.
