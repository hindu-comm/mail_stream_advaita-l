Hare Krishna

I think in Sri Dakshina Murthy Veda Vidya Peetha, Chennenahalli, Magadi
Road is conducting courses like this...Sri Sri Ravishankar International
School, Art of Living (Sri Ravishankara) too in Kanakapura Road has this
facility I believe...But not sure pls. contact the concerned...I once heard
through Sri Krishna Bhat, RigvEda SallakshaNa GhanapATi that in his
Anandaashrama there is a facility for both modern & traditional
education....Let me find out...

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
