praNAm all,

Ram-ji, Jaldhar-ji,

I'm assuming Abhishek is tied up with something else (since he didn't
mail up in a while and there was no response to the last copy I marked
him). I'm herewith copying to Nataraja, who has studied Vedas since
childhood with parallel modern education. I hope he gets the mail.
Maybe he could be helpful.

Nataraja, would you be able to give some pointers?

AFAIK, talking to Ramakrishna Math at Basavanagudi and Sringeri
Shankara Math nearby could also be helpful, if not already done.

Thanks,
--praveen
(PS: There is a possibility that Abhishek and/ or Nataraja may have
filtered the mail into a folder to check later. If so, we could try
mailing them separately.)
