You had asked:

"dont you think shankara himself clarified his position with regard to
this??  In the sUtra bhAshya shankara clearly says shruti is NOT the only
pramANa in brahma jignAsa but shruti etc. intuition etc (anubhavavasAnatvAt
bhUtavastuvishayatvaccha etc....). are the valid pramANa. Ofcourse in the
dharma jignAsa shaastra is the ONLY pramANa..."

Comments:

Translating 'anubhava" as intuition appears to be insufficient.
Anubhava is direct perception or cognition, knowledge 
derived from direct experience. When anubhava becomes a pramANa,
there is no need for shruti. BhagavatpAda in vivEka chUDAmanI says

"avijnyAtE pare tattvE shAstrAdhItistu niShphalA
vijnyAtE api pare tattvE shAstrAdhItistu niShPkhalA " - (59).

- study of scriptures (shruti) is useless for an ajnyAni as well
as a jnyAni.

The implied meaning here seems to be that shruti is pramANa for a mumukShu.
A mumukShu has no anubhava; so how is it a pramANa? If anubhava is 
translated as intuition, Without the benefit of shruti, how does intuition
lead him to Brahman. My understanding is that shravaNa and manana is what
leads the seeker to Brahman during nidhidhyAsana.

K. Ramakrishna.
