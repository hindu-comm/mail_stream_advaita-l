Dear Thiru Ramakrishnan

While I have not yet studied the paper, one of the rules of discussion stands out:

----- Original Message ----
From: Ramakrishnan Balasubramanian rama.balasubramanian at gmail.com

Please do not enter the discussion if you are already convinced by
SSS, and feel the need to proselytize the rest of us. 
----------------------------

For the most part, I am with you on discussions derailed etc., but what kind of discussion is this going to be if the opposition cannot participate?

It is only fair that followers of SSS be given the opportunity to defend the views of SSS, even if it amounts to proselytization. Again, to be fair, not all followers of SSS dilate endlessly, derail discussions, take off on tangents etc.. To quote but one instance, Mrs. Savitri had earlier posted a very precise summary of SSS's views.

Of course, it is perfectly possible to interpret the above rule in a way which makes the discussion open to participation by followers of SSS. The copulative conjunction 'and' is critical in this view. Participation is forbidden only when both the conditions of a) being convinced by SSS, and b) feeling the need to convert others to SSS's interpretation of Sri Sankara are valid. If somebody were convinced by SSS, and out of general love for humanity and with an aim to enlighten everybody, presents the views of SSS properly, the second condition is not met, so participation in discussion is still allowed. However, many sensitive persons are likely to think that participation is not welcome, and might prefer to stay off.

I request the administrators to welcome the views of followers of SSS as well. 

Regards
Senani
