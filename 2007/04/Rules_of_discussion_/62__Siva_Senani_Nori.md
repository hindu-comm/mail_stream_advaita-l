Sri Vidyasankar sent the following clarifying on the rules of debate. From this, it is very clear that participation by the followers of SSS is indeed welcome.

Jaldhar, Ravi and I read through the rules that Ramakrishnan wants to abide 
by and okayed them before he posted them to the list. So perhaps a 
clarification from one of the moderators is necessary here.

Our intention is to see a thoughtful discussion, not to prevent it. By 
definition, the two extreme poles of this discussion can only be defined 
between those who are absolutely convinced that Swami Saccidanandendra 
Sarasvati is right and those who are equally convinced of the opposite. As 
you noticed, the key conjunction is the "and" - it applies only to those who 
take a strident and almost missionary stance. The idea is that everyone 
should avoid the tendency to "prove by assertion" or "prove by repetition".

As moderators, we expect that both sides confine their attention to the 
topics of substance, rather than express emotional opinions on sampradAya 
etc. Thus, the focus should be on topics like the 
epistemological/ontological status of avidyA and/or mAyA, whether 
bRhadAraNyaka and mANDUkya upanishad texts say something mutually different 
about sushupti, etc. It goes without saying that the proposed rules (or code 
of conduct for this discussion, I would say) apply equally to all 
participants, on both sides of the debate.

Hoping that everyone keeps the tone and content of the discussion at an 
elevated level,

Best regards,
Vidyasankar
