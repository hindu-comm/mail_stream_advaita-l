In the Email regarding the above topic it is said that "Avidya"is
abhavarupa.If it is abhavarupa(some thing which does not exist)then how
does it give raise to misapprehension.A non-entity cannot give raise to a
real entity.In the Bhagavadgita it is said "na sato vidyate
bhavah,naabhavo vidyate satah".In fact,it is said on the nature of
"avidya" that it is "anirvacaniya"(Indeterminate or
durghata,inexplicable).From the stand point of avidya it is real,from the
standpoint of Brahman it is 'tucca"-a nullity,and from the point of nyaya
or logic it is anirvacaniya.
