Dear Members,

I am desirous of learning Krishna Yajurveda (moolam) Gurumukhataha. Whom
can I approach in Bangalore? (I have not yet enquired in Sringeri mata
in Bangalore as people there are busy as Mahasannidhanam is camping in
Shankarapuram).  Any pointers will be extremely helpful.



Thanks,

ram
