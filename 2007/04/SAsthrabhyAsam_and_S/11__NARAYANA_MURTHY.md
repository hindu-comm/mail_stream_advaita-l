Sri Amuthan MahaSaya

  praNAmah

  I had been on an unscheduled trip to Gaya and had darshan of GadAdara and AkSayavata.  very kind of you for deliberating on "Sasthra vyAkhyAna kauSalam" and "SabdajAlam" verses as per the commentary of Sh Chandrasekara Bharathi swaminah.

  Another verse #47 adding further clarity is :

  "vedAntArtha vichAreNa jAyate gnyAnamuthamam
  tenAtyantika samsAraduhkhanASo bhavatyanu"

  by getting involved in vednta vichAram, one gets gnyAnam and gnyAnath samsAraduhkhanASam.

  may be its a checklist given by Sankara to deplore where one is led by the vichara in those verses.

  warm regards
