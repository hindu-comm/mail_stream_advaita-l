Namaste,

I checked and don't have this book with me. 

I am guessing that "this anubhava" below in your
paragraph refers to the sushupti anubhava (sAkshi of
the avastha-traya-viveka) that is a universal
experience where all waker jnAtrus can swear in unison
that there was no jnAtrutva in that state.

Briefly, in sushupti, there is no seeking, learning,
ego, etc., hence our essential nature is pure
knowledge, and jnAtrutva which belongs only to the
waking and dream states, is mitya and exists only
because of adhyasa. Since this anubhava cannot be
refuted by any being at anytime, it can easily be
called the ultimate loukika pramANa. Please note that
this is still an indirect knowledge, only shAstra
vAkya from guru can give direct knowledge/experience
of paramArtha.

Anyway, there are hundreds of places where he quotes
unequivocally that Sruti is the only pramANa for
atman-brahman aikya, and how shaAstra vAkya removes
ignorance. 

Regards,
Savithri
