namaste Srikanta,

You are making baseless accusations. We have not censored or moderated
your messages. All we repeatedly asked was to frame the subject line
correctly.  If we are moderating your messages, we would have stopped
this message of yours  from appearing.

I think this post of yours crosses the line. I will take up this
matter in private with you.

With best regards,

Ravi
