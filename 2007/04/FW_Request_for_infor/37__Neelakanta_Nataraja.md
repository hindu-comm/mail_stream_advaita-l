Hi Nattu,

Thanks for your response. However, you seem to have mailed me alone,
instead of the list. You may want to resend it there. I'd pitched in
the thread to introduce you to the person who requested the info,
since I knew your balancing tradition and modern education perfectly.

The way you've managed both and finished your MBA too, is really
inspiring for all. Congratulations!

Best wishes on your sadhana,
--praveen
