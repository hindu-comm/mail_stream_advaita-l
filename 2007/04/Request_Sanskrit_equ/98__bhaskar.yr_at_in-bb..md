I request the Sanskrit scholars in this list to provide the Sanskrit
equivalents for the terminologies epistemic & ontic.  The author of *Paper
on SSS* uses these terms very frequently to present his stand on avidyA...I
would like to know the paryAya/ samAnArthaka pada in Sanskrit for these
terminologies...I can assure that this is not an attempt to emphasize
terminology over philosophy...just curious to know :-))

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
