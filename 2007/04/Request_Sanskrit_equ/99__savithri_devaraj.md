Namaste Bhaskar - 
I may not be directly answering your questions, but
this sidenote might help.

Dictionary meanings of Ontology - The branch of
metaphysics that deals with the nature of being. 

Dictionary meaning of Epistemology - The branch of
philosophy that studies the nature of knowledge, its
presuppositions and foundations, and its extent and
validity.

The two are closely related because any study of
knowledge (object of knowing - prameya, right
knowledge - prame), its means and validity (pramANa),
etc., presupposes a being (pramAtR^i). And what that
being is, is a question of ontology. Our being will
already impose an interpretation. Thus the
interdependence between ontology and epistemology
begins with human perception.

The study and inter-relationships between pramANa,
prameya, prame and pramAtR^i is the study of human
perception and pramAnas in ascertaining right
knowledge. This, you might say, is ontology and
epistemology in general.

You might know that these have been dealt in detail by
Sri Satchidanandendra Saraswati Swamiji in his Kannada
book "Shankara bhagavatpAdara SarvasammatopadeshagaLu"
in chapters 
5.PramANakrR^itya and
6.Loukikavaidika PramANagaLu

Regards,
Savithri
