It is irrelevant, since I am quoting SSS as using the words in his own
works. The meanings of epistemic, etc., are clear from www.m-w.com.
The whole point of my paper is to show that categorizing avidyaa as
epistemic or ontic is a *Western* notion, and advaita does not fit
into neat cubbyholes provided by Greek derived philosophical terms!
