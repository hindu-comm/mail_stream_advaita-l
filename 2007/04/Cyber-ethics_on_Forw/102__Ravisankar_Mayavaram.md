namaste

Whatever that is posted on our list is on a public archive, you can
pass the information on by just sending the link.  I have forward the
messages what I have benefited from and I invariably include the link,
so that the reader can verify the original content for himself.

In the case of Rama's paper, it is on a public website, just passing
on the link should be enough.

Don't worry too much about these things.


Ravi
