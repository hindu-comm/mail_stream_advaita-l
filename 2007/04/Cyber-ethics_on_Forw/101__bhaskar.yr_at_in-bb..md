Hare Krishna

Though below mesg. is from advaitin list, I think this rule is applicable
here also...I donot know whether Sri Rama prabhuji is member of advaitin
list....Hence I am forwarding my mail to this list.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar

 Kindly pardon me for not knowing this rule...After reading the above, I            
 think, I have violated this rule....Without taking the consent of Sri Rama         
 prabhuji I've forwarded his paper to two of my friends who are not members         
 of this list but interested in vEdAnta. I onceagain apologise for this             
 rules violation...
