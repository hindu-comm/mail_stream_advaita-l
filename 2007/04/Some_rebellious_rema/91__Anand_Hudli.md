There is nothing wrong about changing one's mind about a school of thought 
after a more in-depth study. As one progresses in the study, it is quite 
possible that the shortcomings of the approach become obvious. Or, one may 
start the study with a poor opinion of a school but a detailed study may 
convert that opinion into a more favorable one.

We have heard of examples of  even more extreme cases when a person studies 
a particular school in great depth with only an intention to  refute it! For 
example, kumArila bhaTTa is said to have studied buddhism, and in more 
recent times, rAmAchArya is said to have studied advaita with similar 
intentions.

An important "pre-requisite" in such studies is that one should have enough 
of an open mind to be able to grasp the subtleties of the system under 
study, else there would be the risk of misunderstanding those subtleties. It 
is this pre-requisite that was not met by those who tried to learn advaita 
with the intention of refuting it
