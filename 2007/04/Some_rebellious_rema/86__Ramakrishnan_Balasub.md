Absolutely. It was not intended to be discussed online because of list
rules regarding certain topics regarding sampradaaya, etc. I thought
hard about whether I should delete that section in my final version.
However, I chose to leave it in because of certain problematic trends
I see in studying bhaashyas. The Indian concept of bhaashyas,
vaartikas and TIkAs is quite different from the Western notion of
"commentaries". Just look at the definition of vaartika, and see what
leeway is given to the author of a vaartika. The problematic trend I
see is creation of advaitic Jerry Falwells, which IMO is not good. The
last section was to emphasize that a Western education combined with
lack of rigorous training in allied subjects such as nyaayaa and
miimaamsaa, can be quite dangerous to say the least, as evidenced by
serious philosophical inconsistencies.
