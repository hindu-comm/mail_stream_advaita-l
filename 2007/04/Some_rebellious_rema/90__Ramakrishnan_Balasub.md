BTW, section 6 has ***facts***, and a theory which fits the facts
well. If there are any problems with the facts, get back to me and I
will modify them, and also alter the theory behind it. If there are
enough errors, I will change the section considerably. Stop calling it
baseless accusations, etc., just because you don't like my
conclusions.  I am not here to please you, if you didn't know that
already.
