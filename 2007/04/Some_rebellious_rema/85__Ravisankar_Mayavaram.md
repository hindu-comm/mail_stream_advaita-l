namaste Bhaskar,

( I am sending this note as one of the moderators)

* If someone clarified or claimed something  to you in private and if
they  are not willing to post that to the list -- then it is an issue
you have to resolve  with him/her  in private.  There is no point
getting frustrated about that on the list.

*  As per the rules for (his participation in the) discussion, Rama
clearly states that "8. If you don't follow the rules above, don't
expect me to reply". This means you can post in the way or order you
want [but it should meet the general list guidelines], but do not
expect Rama to reply.

* Please do not include images, it will be removed by the filter. We
do not allow non-text content.

* Language you choose to use  it reflects your own quality. So the
tone you use is your choice (as long as it is within  list tolerance
policy). Key is to write it in a way readers can easily understand.
You may write a rebuttal of the paper and present it to the list.   As
I stated above, do not expect a reply.  You can disagree with someone
on factual basis and that will be a stronger rebuttal than calling
names  such as "only fools will write like this". In fact, despite
your claim in the footnote, this messages reflects quite poorly on
you, especially considering the fact that  you have set an exemplary
example all these years with  your polite and confident writing style.

* I do not find section 6 offensive or unprintable and not even the
line  "Indeed none of his works are about the philosophy of advaita,
but are oriented almost exclusively towards contradicting previous
commentators of Sankaracarya."  or the assertion  "that he is a
textual analyst and not a philosopher".  It is a view of the author,
you are welcome contradict it factually by quoting passages  from the
works of SSS . If I am not mistaken, even though this is part of the
paper, it was not intended by Rama to be discussed online ==> which
means you can reply, he may or may not respond.

I wish you could have sent your reply to the list moderators.

With best wishes,
Ravi
