Dear Smt Devaraj,

As you may be aware, in several threads over the last few months, 
Ramakrishnan had mentioned that he was preparing this paper. We are 
discussing it on the list simply because it is not irrelevant for the aims 
and purpose of the list.

The decision to put up the paper on his own site, instead of hosting it on 
our website or posting the entire content to the list is driven by a few 
factors, (a) author's choice, (b) size constraints and (c) convenience. As 
you can see, he is further editing the paper as the discussion progresses on 
the list.

As a general request to all participants, please keep your equanimity and 
enter into the discussion. No matter how frustrating or annoying it seems, 
and I'm sure both Bhaskar and Rama feel these, please do not let it out in 
public. This will both help maintain decorum on the list and help each of us 
to develop self-control and patience.

After all, we will have not even taken the first step towards really 
qualifying for vedAnta study, if we do not develop Sama, dama, titikShA, 
uparati etc.

Best regards,
Vidyasankar
