praNAms Bhaskarji

praNAms Sri Siva Senani Nori prabhuji
Hare Krishna

Sri Vidyasankar had earlier clarified that participation by the followers
is indeed welcome; the moderators only wish to avoid proof by assertion or
repetition. His mail is reproduced below for your ready reference.

>  Oh!! thanks a lot...I have not received this mail..oflate, I have not
been receiving all the mails from Advaitin list and in received mails there
is a prefix *possible spam*...I dont know what exactly the problem...

I am sure a lot of people are eagerly awaiting for your and other followers
of SSS's response. I particularly want to know how the followers of SSS
reconcile the notion that pratyaksha / anubhava is the kingpin of pramANas
with the Sankaran principle of Sruti being the pramANa when it reveals
something not immediately experienced (Brahman is the foremost of such
revealed things).

>  dont you think shankara himself clarified his position with regard to
this??  In the sUtra bhAshya shankara clearly says shruti is NOT the only
pramANa in brahma jignAsa but shruti etc. intuition etc (anubhavavasAnatvAt
bhUtavastuvishayatvaccha etc....). are the valid pramANa. Ofcourse in the
dharma jignAsa shaastra is the ONLY pramANa...

Regards
Senani

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
