Namaste Ravi,

This is totally unfair. Why allow some guesswork and
hearsay to be published on the list, and say it is out
of bounds for list discussion? Yes, the quoted
sentences are conjecture and opinion on the part of
the author! Seems like the moderators of the list
endorse such baseless opinions.
It would seem best to get rid of sections that are
out-of-bounds for discussion from the paper..Isn't it?

Regards,
Savithri
