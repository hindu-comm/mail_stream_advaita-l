praveen:
My line of thinking is so:
If jIvo brahmaiva nA para and brahmavid brahmaiva bhavati, then why
not? So, capacity to cover even the reality of the self "for whom"
(hidden from whom?) is to be added to understand the statement better.
That jIvA which has become (figuratively) brahmaN, does not remain
covered by mUlAvidyA. Therefore, ajnAna is false knowledge thats a
positive entity making the jIvA identification and bindings thereof,
which is removed by jnAna, a positive, true knowledge.

praveen: The ignorance about the rope, if negative entity, would only
mean "not-understanding that its a rope", why would it be "projection
of the snake"? That positive presence of the snake brings in the
argument of false knowledge. And any true knowledge destroys false
knowledge, be the latter positive. In this case, the knowledge of the
rope and removal of the projected snake is a single thing.

Kartik-ji, prime number was a good example, thanks.
