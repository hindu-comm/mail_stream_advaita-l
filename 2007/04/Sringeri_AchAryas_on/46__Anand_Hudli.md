It is clearly a mistake to treat mUlAvidyA as something that really rests in 
Brahman. PadmapAda makes it clear at the outset by using the word 
mithyAjnAna (mithyA ajnAna) that this ignorance is only mithyA, 
anirvachanIyA. It is this unreal ajnAna that has its locus as Brahman. As 
such, the whole situation of ajnAna having Brahman as locus is also unreal. 
Upon the dawn of Brahman realization, the ajnAna disappears and so does the 
very "fact" that the ajnAna had Brahman as its locus.

A related objection, albeit couched in sophisticated language, appears in 
the second definition of unreality in the advaita siddhi 
(www.advaitasiddhi.org). MadhusUdana SarasvatI has provided an apt reply to 
this.

Anand
