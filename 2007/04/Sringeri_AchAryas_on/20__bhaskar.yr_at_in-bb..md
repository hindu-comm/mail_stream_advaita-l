praNAms Sri Karthik prabhuji
Hare Krishna

Thanks for your clarification through vaak & artha analogy...But I'd have
been much obliged had it been more to the point of discussion i.e. Avidya
as per vivaraNakAra.

Karthik prabhuji:

You seem to imagine that all things bhAva-rUpa must be "solid" --
indicating a material basis for reality.

bhaskar :

Yes, vivaraNakAra implies that there is an entity called mUlAvidyA which is
the *material cause* for both adhyAsa & world!!! They say (and you can find
it from Ananda Hudli prabhuji's mail) that this bhAvarUpa avidyA covers up
brahman and because of this *alone* (please note it) two types of adhyAsa
such as agrahaNa & anyThAgrahaNa as well as the world are produced....there
is no stage where you can get rid of this mUlAvidyA... VivaraNakAra-s donot
grant pUrNa mukti even for jIvanmukta-s. They say since there is a trace of
ignorance (avidyAlEsha)in jIvanmukta-s, only after getting rid of this
physical body (vidEhamukti) they will attain the ultimate in advaita...

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
