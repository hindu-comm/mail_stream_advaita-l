praveen: As far as I understand vivaraNa, I see that removal of
tulAvidyA removes the jIva's individuality. If my understanding is
wrong, I stand corrected (following the explanation of what tulAvidya
does and what its removal would mean then). If the jIva's
individuality is removed, what becomes of him apart from brahmaN?

Next, what happens to mulAvidyA then. For this, I await clarifications
from Anand Hudli-ji's series moving fwd. But till then, I see that it
remains as is, as it was, since its *mulAvidyA* and I don't see why
brahmaN should remove it. Although its universal mAyA, brahmaN is not
affected by it. "The locus of mulAvidyA being brahmaN means that
brahmaN is affected by it" is something that I don't assume. But I
understand it as "the locus of mulAvidyA is declared as brahmaN since
it deals with the problem of wherefrom did avidya come in the first
place". IMHO, it also, therefore, means that mAyAvAdins consider mAyA
as not-to-vanish after realization too (the way it was, is, and will
be), but the realized is not affected by it, since he's become
brahmaN. Thanks, this exchange has still deepened my understanding.

praveen: I do not know vivaraNa in enough detail, so thanks for the
ready reference. I agree with the two steps that you mention, but I
still don't see that they are *necessarily separate* steps, per se.
Nonetheless, I'll await Anand Hudli-ji's series to further for a
better understanding of the same. (btw: I guess you meant vritti
should pervade *snake*.)

Thanks again, shankarArpaNamastu,
