Ignorance or ajnAna in the sense that Chitsukha describes it is the 
ignorance associated with the validity of knowledge. This is a little hard 
to understand and so examples will help. Suppose we are told something about 
an object but we do not know if what we know about the object is true. 
Another example is that we assume the Self is a doer, experiencer, has a 
body, etc. but we do not know if what we assume is valid. In these examples, 
there is no lack of knowledge (nobody says the Self is not known in any 
sense at all)  but we are ignorant of the validity (or otherwise) of what we 
know.

It only amounts to a denial of nonsublatability to ajnAna, although it is 
beginningless.

I do not see the how the difference between pragabhAva and atyanta-abhAva 
can be brought up here.

Yes.

PrakR^iti and this Darkness are the same. There is no explicit mention of 
the three guNas in the nAsadIya sUkta. But since PrakR^iti is said to have 
these three guNas, we can infer accordingly.

The Seer is PrajApati ParameShThI, presumably BrahmA himself. If we take the 
Creator to be God (Ishvara), He can never be deluded like us humans. As 
Creator He knows the creation is only an apparent transformation of Brahman.
