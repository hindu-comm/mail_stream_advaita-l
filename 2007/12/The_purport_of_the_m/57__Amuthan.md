building upon this, it would be useful to reflect on the following
verse from the gItA:

'ajo.api sannavyayAtmA bhUtAnAmISvaro.api san.
 prakRtiM svAmadhishThAya sambhavAmyAtmamAyayA..' (4.6)

besides stating the essential identity of saguNa and nirguNa brahman,
the above verse and the immediately preceding bhagavad vacanam 'tAni
(bahUni janmAni) ahaM veda sarvANi' show a crucial difference between
a bhagavad avatAra and a jIvanmukta - an avatAra has ISvarAtma j~nAna
even during the avatArakAla whereas a jIvanmukta is _not_ a sarvaj~na
or a sarvaSakta in the same sense that ISvara is. to state it in more
technical terms, a jIvanmukta has Atmabrahmaikya j~nAna whereas an
avatAra has AtmeSvaraikya j~nAna.
