namaste...

  dear sri sastri-ji,

  Your post on the subject was very enlightening.

  There is a topic which has remained unresolved for me, which is, 'What is meant by Avatara from the advaita point of view'. How does Avatara compare with Jivanmukta? I am aware that the avatara is one who has maya under his control, or he is manifested by his own maya. 

  Could this be explained or discussed?

  pranam.
