Thank you very much for having pointed out for all of us the enlightening 
verse of the nArAyaNIyam (98.7).

I decided to copy your quotation in a separate file in order to be able to 
use it also at a later time. Moreover, I also tried to convert it into 
devanAgarI by using Itranslator; but the result was not up to my 
expectations. I suspected and easily came to the conclusion that your 
encoding was not pure Itrans but a mix of several encoding systems, 
especially for the sibilant sh (instead of shh or Sh) and the vowel ri (R 
instead of R^i or RR).

If I am right, to be read properly by Itranslator the text of the shloka in 
Itrans should have been:



bhUshhAsu svarNavadvA jagati ghaTaSarAvAdike mR^ittikAvat

tattve sa~ncintyamAne sphurati tadadhunApyadvitIyam vapuste |

svapnadrashhTuH prabodhe timiralayavidhau yadva-

dvidyAlAbhe tathaiva sphuTamapi vikaset kR^ishhNa tasmai namaste ||



instead of



bhUshAsu svarNavadvA jagati ghaTaSarAvAdike mRttikAvat

tattve sancintyamAne  sphurati tadadhunApyadvitIyam vapuste |

svapnadrashTuH  prabodhe  timiralayavidhau yadva-

dvidyAlAbhe tathaiva sphuTamapi vikaset kRshNa tasmai namaste ||





I do apologize for being once more the hair-splitter and fussy member of the 
list. Any person proficient in Sanskrit will have of course corrected these 
minor defects straight and by himself (without waiting for me), but this 
finicky message may also perhaps be of some help for others and namely 
beginners in Sanskrit. I do hope my attempt will not be misinterpreted.



Yours in Lord GuruvayUrappan!

Subject: [Advaita-l] advaita in one Sloka


The essence of advaita vedAnta is given in a nutshell in the following Sloka
in nArAyaNIyam of  nArAyaNa bhaTTatiri (daSaka 98, Sloka 7):--

bhUshAsu svarNavadvA jagati ghaTaSarAvAdike mRttikAvat

tattve sancintyamAne  sphurati tadadhunApyadvitIyam vapuste |

svapnadrashTuH  prabodhe  timiralayavidhau yadva-

dvidyAlAbhe tathaiva sphuTamapi vikaset kRshNa tasmai namaste ||

tattve sancintyamAne- When one reflects on the true nature of things,
bhUshAsu svarNavadvA—like gold in ornaments, or,
ghaTaSarAvAdike—in pots and other vessels,  mRttikAvat—like clay,
jagati- in the universe,
tat advitIyam te vapuH—That non-dual aspect of thine (alone),
adhunA api—even now (when we experience the universe as existing),
sphurati- shines.
svapnadrashTuH- for the dreamer,
prabodhe- on waking up,
timiralayavidhau—when the darkness is removed (by light),
jIrNarajjoH  ca- of the worn-out rope also,
yadvat tathA eva—in the same way itself,
vidyAlAbhe—on the dawn of knowledge,
sphuTam vikaset api—the Reality will also shine clearly,
(he) kRshNa, tasmai te namah—O kRshNa, prostrations to Thee, who art that
(the Reality).

   When one reflects on the true nature of things, one will realize that,
just as there is nothing but gold in all gold ornaments, and nothing but
clay in all pots and other earthen vessels, so also, there is only Thy
non-dual Self in reality even when this universe is seen as existing. This
Reality will shine clearly on the dawn of knowledge, just as the things seen
in a dream are found, on waking up, to have never existed  and the worn-out
rope (which was mistaken for a snake) is seen clearly when the darkness is
removed by a light. O kRshNa, prostrations to Thee who art that Reality.
