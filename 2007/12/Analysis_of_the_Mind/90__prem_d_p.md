Shree Prem - PraNAms

The fact that you say they are supra-normal implies
they are beyond the normal means of knowledge or
pamaaNa - pratyaksha and anumaana, etc. We can know
them only through shabda pramaaNa or shaastra
pramaaNa. Objetifyable means they can be tested
either through pratyaksha or indirectly by anumaana
that is by deductive or inductive reasoning. 

For shaastra pramaaNa to work, I should have faith on
the shaastra.

Even heaven and hell and dharma, punya and paapa etc
all come under the same things. 
Even consciousness we have a problem in establishing
objectively since it is the very subject. Scientists
are now exploring how consciousness arises in matter. 
Once we objectify consciousness for analysis it is no
more consciousenss - since anything that is
objectified is inert and mityaa.
