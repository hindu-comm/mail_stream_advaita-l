Hi Anuj, welcome to the fold. But before joining any ashram, please check out its credentials thoroughly or you will soon be disillusioned. It is better to watch and participate from the outside instead of becoming a member. Best wishes and love, Ramesh

moving back to India (New Delhi) sometime in the next month after
having spent 10 years here in the US. I am 28 and have decided to
follow my spiritual calling and join an ashram to further my
understanding of Vedanta over the next 3-4 years. I am joining this
group because I would like to read about other's ideas and have a
place to learn from like minded people.

I hope this is all you needed. Oh1 yes, and I agree to the terms and
conditions of this group/website. :)

Namaste,
Anuj
