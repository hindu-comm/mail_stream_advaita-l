>  Aloha from Hawaii,

>  My name is Kristine Holasek, age 39, and I live in Honolulu, Hawaii (USA). I
>  practiced Zazen for about a dozen years, but after Roshi Aitken retired I
>  couldnÂ’t get interested in working with a teacher. For that reason my
>  teacher became everything around me, including my books, which lead me to
>  the realization that Advaita is my true passion. I vow that I now want
>  nothing but the truth.
