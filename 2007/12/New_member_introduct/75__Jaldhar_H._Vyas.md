Hi,

My name is Sharath T. I am Indian by nationality.

I'm a student of Life Sciences. I have been pursuing the nature of reality 
since quite long, I don't know for how long. But that was when I actually 
started to seek answers to some important questions in the literatures. As 
I have been doing so, a few questions have continuously been nagging me 
and I feel very restless when I face then in contradiction to their very 
source. I have not joined any group of discussion before, but a few 
questions these days have brought me to this resource to which I look 
forward to getting my doubts answered by someone who has actually seen 
through the reality as mentioned in authoritative literatures such as the 
Brahma Sutra.

I hope this short introduction will suffice.

Sharath T.
