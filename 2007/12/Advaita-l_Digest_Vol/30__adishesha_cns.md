Dear Sri Anuj

Namasthe

>From your letters I understand that you are intending
to become a Swami. That is good. I would like to bring
to your kind attention about real vairagya and the
temporary vairagyas those have dealt in various
oriental works. You can cross very your mindset with
these and take decision thereafter.

True Vairagya : If one develops an undying interest in
Brahma and decides that the present birth should be
the last birth to him.

Temporary vairagyas : These are of three kinds.
Certain circumstances make us to take sanyasa. but
after some time when the emotions recede the aspire of
becoming a swami will fade.

01. Puraana vairagya: While listening or discussing
about philosophy the idea of taking sanyasa will
occur. But after some time the same will fade.

02. Smashaana vairagya: When the near and dear ones
die the idea of taking sanyasa will occur. But after
some time the same will fade.

03. Prasuthi vairagya: When a pregnant lady undergoing
labour pains she takes thousand oaths not to mate with
her husband any more. But after delivery as the time
passes she forgets her oaths and longs for her
husband. This kind of vairagya is known as prasuthi
vairagya.

You are authority to check what type of vairagya you
have developed. If it true one please go ahead. If not
please wait till the true one develops.

Another point. One can himself initiates into sanyasa.
But generally people try to affiliate to a certain
smpradaya.

One can become a swami / sanyasi instantaneously by
pronouncing 'Praisha Manthras'.

(Please refer to Devanagari (Sanskrit) script for
correct pronunciation).

The Praisha Manthras are;

Om Bhuuh Sanyastham Maya

Om Bhuvah Sanyastham Maya

Om Suvah Sanyastham Maya

Om Bhuurbhuvasuvah Sanyastham Maya

Note:- Earlier in the days of yore, Advaithi Sanyasis
used prefer not to take a new name after becoming a
sanyasi as it again tantamount to identifying himself
/ herself with body or corpse than with Brahman.

But todays law of the land do not permit so. Therefore
you can choose a new name of your choice which can
remind you always Brahman.

Regards 

adishesha
