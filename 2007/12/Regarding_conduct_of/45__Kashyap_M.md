Dear people,
  My pranams to all of you.

  Some mails are being circulated which is telling about the conduct of Swamijis etc.

  I would like to say that we should be clear about what we want from Swamijis. Whether he moves only with the priests or Brahmins or some other people is totally irrelevant.Our only goal should be that of unity with our true self.

  In that context all the things mentioned are totally irrelevant. We should try to be honest seekers of knowledge. We are not here to observe his duties or the way he conducts himself.After all he also has the responsibility of running a 
  huge institution like the Matha etc,so he has to mix with specialised people and we need not be irked by that. 

  Moreover his responsibilities and way of conduct would have 
  been advised by his Guru.

  I have read a few books on Sri Sri Sri Chandrasekhara Bharathi Swamiji and he always used give instructions either in the form of verbal communication or just a glace to any seeker who was honest,irrespective of any race or caste or any such thing. We even see instructions given to people belonging to Muslim and Christian faith.

  After all what we want from Swamijis is the grace and blessing hence we need not break our head thinking about their daily conduct towards outside world.

  I offer the words in this mail to the lotus feet of the Divine Mother

  I apologise if there is any mistake in the above.

  HARI OM

  Kashyap
