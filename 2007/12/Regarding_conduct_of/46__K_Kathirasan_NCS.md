Namaste Kashyapji,

Pls see this gita verse: 

yad yad acarati sresthas tat tad evetaro janah
sa yat pramanam kurute lokas tad anuvartate

"Whatever action a wise man performs, the common men follow. And
whatever standards he sets by his acts, the world follows." (3:19)

Therefore the subject you have mentioned is NOT 'totally' irrelevant.
But perhaps not that relevant for a mumuksu or jijnasu. 

Warmest Regards,
Kathirasan K

Subject: [Advaita-l] Regarding conduct of Swamijis

Dear people,
  My pranams to all of you.

  Some mails are being circulated which is telling about the conduct of
Swamijis etc.

  I would like to say that we should be clear about what we want from
Swamijis. Whether he moves only with the priests or Brahmins or some
other people is totally irrelevant.Our only goal should be that of unity
with our true self.

  In that context all the things mentioned are totally irrelevant. We
should try to be honest seekers of knowledge. We are not here to observe
his duties or the way he conducts himself.After all he also has the
responsibility of running a 
  huge institution like the Matha etc,so he has to mix with specialised
people and we need not be irked by that. 

  Moreover his responsibilities and way of conduct would have 
  been advised by his Guru.

  I have read a few books on Sri Sri Sri Chandrasekhara Bharathi Swamiji
and he always used give instructions either in the form of verbal
communication or just a glace to any seeker who was honest,irrespective
of any race or caste or any such thing. We even see instructions given
to people belonging to Muslim and Christian faith.

  After all what we want from Swamijis is the grace and blessing hence
we need not break our head thinking about their daily conduct towards
outside world.

  I offer the words in this mail to the lotus feet of the Divine Mother

  I apologise if there is any mistake in the above.

  HARI OM

  Kashyap
