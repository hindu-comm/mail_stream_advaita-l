 Dr. J.C. Bose (1858 â€“1937) is said to have discovered that trees and plants
have life and react to stimuli. I do not know whether this was known to
science earlier. Scientist members of this group must be able to say.

But it is interesting that this has been stated by Sri Sankara himself in
his bhAshya on chandogya upanishad, VI. 11. 2:--

"That a tree is possessed of a soul is indicated by such signs as exudation
and drying up of sap. From the illustration in the Sruti that the non-moving
living things are possessed of consciousness, the view of the Buddhists and
the vaiSeshikas, who hold that the non-moving things have no consciousness,
is seen to be without substance".
