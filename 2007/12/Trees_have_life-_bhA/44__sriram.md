Dear Sri Viswanathan
The harmones control the moods and brain controls the secretion of  these 
harmones through sympathetic nervous system.A man is declared dead when his 
brain is dead.So I think brain is the seat for consciousness and by 
anaesthesia it is put to sleep and the individual does not feel any 
pain/sensation which shows that brain is the cause for our consciousness.
R.Krishnamoorthy.
