Namaste Sriniji,

I found the Chandogya Upanisad Sankara Bhasya that refer to gayatri. They are at 3:12:1-9.

Subject: [Advaita-l] Gayatri Shankara Bhashya

I found several references in books and on the web of
Shankaracharya's Bhashya to Gayatri mantra.

I own comple works of Shankaracharya in 10 volumes
published by Samata. I did not find Gayatri Bhashyam
in it. 

Does anyone know if it a part of any works of Shankara
or elsewhere ?

Thans a lot in advance.
