> Namaskara,
> I have a doubt regarding the BG Chapter 10 Shloka 21. The english
> translation of the shloka is:
> 
> Among the Adityas I am Visnu; among the luminaries, the radiant sun;
> among the (forty-nine) Maruts I am Marici; 
> ** among the stars I am the moon. **
> 
> Why is MOON referred to as a STAR?
> Is the translation of 'nakshtra' as a star fine?
> 
> Does this match with the today's definition of the star or moon?
> 
> Pranams,
> Chakra
