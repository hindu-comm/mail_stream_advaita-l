praNAm,

IMO and understanding, the mind you're possibly mixing here is with
the mind "as defined by science" when you put in words such as "...
especially the brain". On the contrary, manas of Vedanta or Sankhya
puts it, is hardly so and possibly more of a conglomerate. I hope you
find it interesting and satisfying to look for an answer in that
direction.

You'll possibly get more technical and useful answers than this in
other replies here, but I'd non-technically put so: whatever it is
that, though the birthless Self, identifies itself in relation to this
world, creating an individuality as jIva, and multitudes therefore, is
what carries forth to other births.

gurorarpaNamastu,

Of course, the sense of PERCEPTION and Realness that seems associated with the mind/thoughts is due to SELF (CONSCIOUSNESS). Self illumines the mind, but mind belongs to the material part (body). This being so, WHO is there to take RE-BIRTH? WHO is the CARRIER of VASANAS to the next birth?
