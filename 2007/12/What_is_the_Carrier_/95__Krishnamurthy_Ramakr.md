Shri Kalyan,

Your message is interesting! I am curious of the source of your statement - 
" the sukshma sarira the subtle body leaves the body and enters into another
career. Is the body having consicouness after the death - yes - but not
perceived because the sukshma sarira is absent in the dead body to get
brightened with the help of the consciouness."
 The shruti/smriti that I am aware of, describes that the Atman
(Consciousness) leaves the body with the subtle body; The Atman with the
upAdhi of the subtle body is referred to as jIvAtma. This is very clear from
the following two verses of the gITa;

"mamaivAmshO jIvalOkE jIvabhUtah sanAtanah
manah shaShTAni indriyANi prakritisthAni karShati " - (15-7)

"sharIram yadavApnOti yacchApi utkrAmati Iswarah
grihItvaitAni samyAti vAyuh gandhA nivAshayat " - (15-8)

Shankara bhAsya on the latter verse reads as follows;

"Iswarah dEhAdi sanJGAta svAmI jIvah; yadA cha pUrvasmAt sharIrAt
sharIrAntaram avApnOti tadA grihItvA EtAni manah ShaShTAni indriyANi samyAti
samyak yAti gacchati - Iswara is jIva who is the lord of the body and sense
organs; When he leaves the previous body and obtains a new body, then he 
goes forward with the froup of sense organs, whose sixth component is manas
".

According to your statement the subtle body alone leaves the physical body
and enters in to another physical body. If so, is the subtle body sentient?
I am 
interested in understanding the shruti pramANa related to your statement.

Regards,
K. Ramakrishna.

Subject: [Advaita-l] What is the Carrier of Vasanas? (Sharath T Poojary)

Hari Om

I just want to to share my understanding with you.

At the time of death of the body, the sukshma sarira the subtle body leaves
the body and enters into another career. Is the body having consicouness
after the death - yes - but not perceived because the sukshma sarira is
absent in the dead body to get brightened with the help of the consciouness.


Therefore the antakarana - part of subtle body never get destryoed till the
liberation moksha and the causal body till the pralaya kala as per the sruti
pramanam.

Hence the Ego the part of antakarana continues till the dawn of the
knowledge. So long as we have the deha abhimanam the ego continues to exist.

Namaskarams

Kalyan
