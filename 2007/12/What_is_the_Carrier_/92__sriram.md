Dear Sri Sharath
Your question is logical.But according to Brahma sutras the Pranas carry the 
vasanas and exit through the brahmaranthram.If you go through the chapter 
regarding what happens to the pranas and the soul you will get an
answer to your genuine pursuit.Faith is the key as all this is subjective 
knowledge.Each one has to research individually and the knowledge is so 
subtle words will not be adequate to describe the outcome.This is my 
analysis.

>>Hi,

>>When they say the soul is born again and again, WHOM are they refering to?

>>You see mind is actually material in nature. It is caused by the

>>material part (body). This being so, WHO is there to take RE-BIRTH? WHO is
>>the CARRIER of VASANAS to the next birth?
>>
>>I hope someone who has seen through this problem will help me see it too.
>>I'm anxiously waiting for a reply.
