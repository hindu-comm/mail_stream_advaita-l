Congratulations on your decision, or the call as I prefer to think of
it as. If it helps, may I mention that one of the Swamijis at
Rishikesh Sivananda ashram suggested the same 3 yr course to me?

Although I didn't take it due to my being choosy and biased, or
incapability, or whatever, I do think that any practical step towards
Vedanta is good enough. I also believe that the path chalks itself out
for the right student. In that light, and on reading your attitude, I
feel that you're about to have a blissful experience ahead, be it
anywhere. Best wishes.

May God and guru be your guide!

praNAms again,
