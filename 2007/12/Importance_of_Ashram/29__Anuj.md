Thank you Mahesh, I am actually going to be visiting the ashram for 4 days
this week while Swamiji is there to get a feel for the place. I know I will
be happy there to have like minded people and time to my-self.
I appretiate your support and know that Swamiji's no 'BS' style :) is
particularly why I like him. Sorry about the pun.

Happy New Year, and may peace be with you

Anuj
