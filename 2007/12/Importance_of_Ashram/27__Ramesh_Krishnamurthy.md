This talk of "blending east & west" always makes me squirm in my seat.
Most people who make such claims are actually 99% west and 1% east.
Our problem is not the need to assimilate western paradigms but the
need to first understand our own.

I am not sure what you mean by "superstition" and "blind beliefs" but
rituals are quite central to Indian ways of learning. All our
philosophies are children of the ritualistic tradition, and not
rebellions against ritual as some modern historians would like us to
believe.
