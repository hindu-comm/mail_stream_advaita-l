>PeriyavaaL was giving darshan. A bhaktA asked: "Since Lalitha SahasranAnam
mentions that AmbaaL is the mother of all this world we all become
sahoDharAs. If this is so, why to move with some people without physically
coming in touch with them or touching them? How is this untouchability
appropriate?" 
PeriyavaaL: For this question the answer is in the very next nAmAvaLi.
"AmbaaL who is the Mother of everyone has also established the regulation of
varNASrama. She is also the varNASramaviDHAyinI ! ----------- 

=====================================================
