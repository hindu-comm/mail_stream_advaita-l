Sri Ramanan, I think I see where we may differ (again, no disrespect,
I realize most of you here are much more well versed in this
philosophy than I) in our intentions. I believe each seeker has to
find their own teacher based on their own and the teachers
temperament. Kind of like the need for varying degrees of Bhakti,
Karma and Jnana yoga's based on each seekers own preference.

Now, although Sri Bharathi Teertha Mahaswami may be the best in your
and many others eyes, I believe to learn or unlearn (as the case may
be) requires a confort level with one's guru that has less to do with
the best and more to do with the kind of compassion, patience and
mutual respect each party has for one another. I thinkk you'll agree
this is something one cannot stumble upon, it may take a few attempts,
maybe a lifetime and there are many examples of those who had to do it
mostly themselves...so I'll keep Sri Mahaswami in mind as my journey
continues :)

Anuj

Swami Parthasarathy is very well-known and he has written very good treatises on Vedanta and the Gita. He has extensively lectured on Vedanta as well. But if you could get Deeksha from Sri Bharathi Teertha Mahaswami and be under his guidance, that will be the best you can get in this yuga. There just can not be any second opinion on that. Next to this will be discipleship under a senior monk of the Sri Ramakrishna Order. I do not know much about Swami Parthasarathy's Ashram, but I think, it ranks third in my list of preferences if I were to join an Ashram. Best wishes, Ramesh Ramanan.
