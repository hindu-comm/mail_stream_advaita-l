Hi Karthik,
RamaNa maharshi also was enlightened out of his own experience. Enlightening
out of one's own experience is advaita. If a guru is not the instrument,
it does not mean there was no hand of guru; It goes without saying that the
guru led him up to that stage in the prior life or lives. All that was
needed in that particular life was a trigger to bring out that experience
and enlightenment. The role of a guru is never overstated. Can you receive
a PhD degree without the advice of a PhD or equivalent experience?
Regards,
Krishnamurthy Ramakrishna.

Hi,

  @Anuj

  >> From Budha, to Ramakrishna to Christ, they all grew out of their own
knowledge to become enlightened. <<

  Few questions:-

  1. If all these grew out of their own knowledge to become enlightened and
if you intend to quote that as example, why ever do you need to go and study
under Swami Parthasarathi? 

    2. Does this mean that the role of a Guru is overdefined? 


  3. Could you please elaborate on the enlightenment of the Buddha and the
Christ? 

  By the way, Sri Ramakrishna indeed became enlightened out of his own
knowledge, but he received guidance from three great masters - Bhairavi
Brahmani, Totapuri, and last but not least, Bhavatharani.


  @Jagan

  >> For all that you know the sringeri swamiji may not even admit someone
that is not a brahmana or not done veda adhyayana <<

  What makes you so sure about this?

  >> HH Chandrasekhara Bharathi swamigal himself has said that advaita
cannot be taught but only experienced. In one of the quotes he mentions to
an aspirant that he may at best clarify some grammar of the vedic texts but
cannot teach advaita. <<

  Isn't there any extent to interpret the words of a world-renowned
Jivanmukta in a literal way?

  HH Chandrashekhara Bharathi need not had to utter a word. Just a brief
glance of his conferred the highest knowledge on several people. The
erstwhile Peetadhipathi of Sri Yoganandeshwara Saraswathi Mutt, Yedatore,
Sri Ganapathi Bharati was one such person that had this good fortune. A very
ordinary patashala vidyarthi that he was, a glance from HH changed his whole
life. He attained vast knowledge of the Veda, Vedantha and Shastra. He is
known his knowledge of Purvamimamsa and for the performance of several
mahayagnas like the Garudachayana and Darshapurnamasa. After becoming a
Turiyashrami, he shone as one of the greatest realized masters.

  @Ravi

  >> When I look at the videos in Sringeri's website or any others in which
Sringeri Swamiji appears, he is often flocked by  priests or brahmins only,
and seems to maintain quite a bit of physical distance between himself and
devotees. I cannot help wondering if Adi Shankara himself laid down such
laws to be followed by all the leaders of the Shankara matha in subsequent
years. If a book listing such laws does exist, can someone please point the
same
to me? <<

  The following is quoted (edited by me for brevity) from a discussion at
www.kanchiforum.org/forum/

  ----------- "AbrahmakIta jananI" -- a nAmAvaLi in Lalitha SahasranAmam.
The nAmA next to this is varNASramaviDHAyinI. Combining these two names,
PeriyavaaL (Kanchi Paramacharya) answered a question. 

  PeriyavaaL was giving darshan. A bhaktA asked: "Since Lalitha SahasranAnam
mentions that AmbaaL is the mother of all this world we all become
sahoDharAs. If this is so, why to move with some people without physically
coming in touch with them or touching them? How is this untouchability
appropriate?" 
  PeriyavaaL: For this question the answer is in the very next nAmAvaLi.
"AmbaaL who is the Mother of everyone has also established the regulation of
varNASrama. She is also the varNASramaviDHAyinI !  -----------
