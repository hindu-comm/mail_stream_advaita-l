Thank you both Siva and Ramesh, I agree that there are places which
might not be cohesive for my purposes so I must be cautious.  Where I
am planning on going however (http://www.vedantaworld.org/) is a
sincere and time proven place. I have met the founder Swami
Parthasarthy personally and some of his disciples as well and know
that this is the right place for me to further my understanding and
search.

Please visit the website so you may see for yourself.

Thank you again for adding me to the list and I look forward to the
knowledge that resides within.

I am sure Mr.Anuj would have contemplated on choosing a good Ashram as he is 28yrs old.  Infact  in this present yuga, only ashrams can provide proper requisite for sastras prescribed spiritual practice.  Grahasthashram life or living the life of bramachari outside the ashram setting without being watched is dangerous as the progress cannot be watched for.   I consider Ashram's life is drinking nector.  There is no point in watching the nector from outside.
> Even to study Vedanta we need like minded people.  Otherwise why in olden days Gurukul has been created?  Currently we don't have that kind of system.  Ashram offers a great place to study Vedanta under the true guidance of the noble Guru.  The Advaitic knowledge is a transcendental knowledge.  Only a true teacher alone can impart that.  The knowledge outside this system will be only scholarly.  The uselessness of this has been pointed out by Adi Shankaracharya in Baja Govindam.
> Having said that, I should say the compassion Rameshji is having for his anuj Mr.Anuj is really huge.  I am sure he really wants his anuj to select an enlightened master so that he is not disappointed.  I completely agree that part. My main objection comes only on his later part of his statement where he suggestes "it
