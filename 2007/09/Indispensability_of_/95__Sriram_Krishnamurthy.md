Sri Gurubhyo Namaha

*Indispensability of Guidance from Guru*

Cases of those who had attained perfection without study under any Guru
should not be cited as authorities against the necessity for a Guru; for
such great men are the 'exceptions' in spiritual life and not the common
normality. They come into existence as spiritual masters as a result of the
intense service, study and meditation practised in their previous lives.
They had already studied under their Guru. Their present birth is only its
continuative spiritual effort. Hence, the importance of the Guru is not
lessened thereby.

Om Tat Sat,
Sriram
