Dear Shri Murali Manohar,

 Just for your information, an English translation of MS's Siddhantabindu is
available at

www.geocities.com/snsastri/siddhanta.pdf

It is also available on www.celextel.org

Regards,

S.N.Sastri





MS is the author of several advaitic works such as the gUdArthadIpikA,
advaitasiddhI,  vedantakalpalatika etc. He is believed to have lived between
1540 and 1647 AD. He was born to pramada purandarAcArya ( purodana
bhattAcArya) in Bengal. His forefather, shrI rAma mishrA had migrated from
Kannauj to Navadvip in Bengal, during the times of Raja jayacandrA of
Kannouj and shahAbuddIn gorI.



In the next post, along with the first verse of this work, I will also post
excerpts from his own TIkA where he considers a whole host of questions,
beginning with whether bhaktI is a purushArthA at all.

To state the obvious, there are bound to be errors in my attempt, I ask your
help in correcting them so I may learn better.

Humbly,
Murali Manohar
