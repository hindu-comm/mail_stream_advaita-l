Thanks for the thesis like post on existence. I have a few questions
especially about cycle of birth-re birth

?        Even at death this ?mind? doesn?t get dissolved as other components of the body (as long ^^^ its not >empty).Unfortunately, this body can not continue to exist that longer to fulfill all these endless desires, so the mind >takes another body to get them fulfilled. But, since the desires keep growing, this cycle of leaving one body and acquiring >another continue(s) endlessly. This is called Birth-Death- Rebirth.

As per the above, then the desires a man develops can only be completed if he is born as a man again and so is the case with women. This means that the man/women proportions will remain constant for ever. 

Also, animals and inanimate things like rocks do not have desires and they do their karma much more perfectly than humans. So they will not be born again or in the worst case they will be born the same species, for example a tiger in pursuit of its prey falls and dies, so due to its desire will be born again as a tiger or a similar one that eats the same kind of prey. But animal lives are totally in the hands of humans as they can destroy or selectively multiply animal species, for example growing a whole lot of cattles like cows, goats, chickens etc. and killing elephants, tigers for game or money. 

The human population keeps growing does not jibe with this theory unless we say that the soul with the mind sub divides
and some desires of man can still be completed as a women, some by animals and some by inanimates. Are there indications of this theory in shruti/smrithis?

thanks
Kris
