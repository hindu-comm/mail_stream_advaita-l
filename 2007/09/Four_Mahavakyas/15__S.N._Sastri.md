Dear Shri Gunnala,

Please see the detailed notes under the sub-heading 'The Mahavakyas' under
the item ' Terms and concepts in Vedanta' on website
www.geocities.com/snsastri

S.N.Sastri


Four Mahavaakyaas- one from each Veda- are very
important and powerful.These spell out the non-duality
of Jiva and Brahman.

Could enlightened Vedantins discull these Mahavaakyaas
in detail for the benefit of seekers.

In the service of the Lord,
C.Gunnala
