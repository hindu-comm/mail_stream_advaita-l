This has reference to Sri.Guy Werling's Email on the terms "Vidya" and
'Jnana".Sri.Shankara in his Bhashyas distinguishes between "Vidya" and
"Jnana".By "Vidya" he means "Upasana",which is still "Dvaita Bhava",where
the worshipper takes the form of the "Diety" he worships,and by "Jnana" he
means that which is generated by Sruthi.There is a detail discussion on
the topic towards the end of the Isavasyopanishad and also in
Chandogyopanishad.
