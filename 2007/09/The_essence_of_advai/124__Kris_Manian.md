Prabhaji,
     Let me share my understanding from the Ocean-wave analogy.
Wave is nothing but water with (kinetic) energy and action. Energy and action brings forth ego and the "I" ness.
This brings new characteristics to the wave even though it is essentially water. So is the delusion of 
Jivaatma. 

Another analogy is when Hydrogen and Oxygen combine you get water that is completely different
from where it came from.

Hari Om.

Kris
