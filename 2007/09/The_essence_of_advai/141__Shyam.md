Pranams Prabha-ji
  Yes, manifest srshti is not Ishwara's dream - you are right in not extending that drshtAnta beyond its logical frontiers.
  I think what you are trying to say/ask is "Why did Brahman manifest as the Universe? If this was because of a limitation on the part of Brahman, then can he be said to be Omniscient?"

  This is my understanding.
  There is a space-time-construct that we are enmeshed in where causality has to be assigned.There is milk right now visible to me, and tomorrow it has become curd. What caused this to happen? A "cause" has to be posited.
  As far as avidya is concerned it is anaadi, or beginingless.
  Now when we hear the term beginingless, our mind, again by its default mode of functioning, thinks of beginingless as meaning something very very very old..something before Krishna, Rama, etc.etc.Time itself is a created entity just like space, and so beginingless essentially means something that is beyond this time-space-causality matrix. 

  So it is not that "first" we posit Brahman, as One, without a second.
  "Then" this "homogeneous" Brahman develops ignorance about Itself. 
  And "from this" the worlds and universes get created. This mode of thinking should be discarded.

  In essence there is no reality other then Brahman.
  What you see is Brahman alone. What you are is Brahman alone.
  This which should be apparent is not - to whom? to me, to whom it is not apparent.
  Instead what is apparent to me is duality, which is mithya.
  This is because of avidya. This avidya - this entity "i" have always had. Why? there is no answer because it beyond cause. That is Maya. It exists, for me, because i perceive duality which is its "effect", but it is not Real, because this duality is purely notional, and disappears with the right knowledge.

  Now let us go back to the water/ocean/wave example.
  From the standpoint of the water - water is. 
  The word wave - it is just a word. it is a concept - a concept for whom??  for the many waves that look upon themselves as waves.
  Did the water "create" the waves? no! there IS nothing but water. The wave is not a separate "thing" that required to be created. In fact the water for all its omniscience could NOT create a single wave that was not water when water alone IS. But the waves (let us say) perceive themselves as waves. This is a notional ignorance on the part of the waves which harbor this "wave-sense" So the concept "wave" is relevant to them. And now with this "wave"concept that they firmly cling to and conclude to be their nature, comes the "ocean" if wave-samsara.
  What is the substratum of the ignorant wave? water
  What is the substratum of the "liberated" wave? water.

  Brahman(water) is not a "knower" It is that know-ING - that objectless awareness - that illumines the notional ingorance of the jiva(wave) as well as its notional liberation.
  This very knowing - this awareness - is never under the delusion of duality - it lends its reality as it were to this delusion so that the jiva knows - but knows himself himself to be something he is not.
  I am Devadutta is a mix of "I am" which is borrowed from Brahman and "Devadutta" which is borrowed from avidya. Fortunately in the wake of knowledge, when the notional Devadutta as someone separate from Brahman disappears, what IS is "I am"

  Maya is the power or shakti of Brahman. Saying Brahman can be subjected to or under the influence of avidya is like saying my wondrous power of sight can cause me to go blind. KNowing ones identity as Brahman one obtains the Highest goal, One returns not from That, which is the Supreme - what a pity it would be if that Goal were always at-risk for and on the alert for this "other real entity"called maya! Nothing Real can ever be "covered" by something which borrows its real-ness from it.

  So jiva/i, is/am, under the spell of avidya. this avidya is beginingless. So don't look for a cause for this avidya. Why? Not because the question is inconvenient, not because the answer is difficult, but because what is begininglesss CANNOT HAVE a cause. And Brahman is beyond both cause and effect. When we say it is vivarta upaadaana kaaranam it is only form the standpoint of the ignorant jiva who demands a cause, for a duality that has no reality to begin with. This is the only aim of Ma Shruti when in her infinite kindness and compassion for the jiva she talks about "He desired" "Having brooded on that knowledge, He created" etc etc" 

  Now, with regards to what Shri Amuthan-ji talked about, I agree with him, but only partially. I dont think asking questions about maya, brahman, how, why, etc necessarily means one is not a mumukshu, and that one is dabbling in speculative philosophy.
  What else is mananam but the asking - repeated asking - of doubts, and more doubts, and in the process crystallizing this knowledge in one's intellect.
  So doubt, you MUST, and frequently, BUT under the safe umbrella of Shraddha. Not "is this true?" but "what is preventing me from understanding the truth in this?" Let the answers come to you. These questions are not like "what is the capital of Ukraine?" which you can quickly loop up in a encyclopedia brittanica, turn to Page 555 and line 2, and find out. As a mumukshu, as a jijnasu, these questions are most natural. With the right attitude they are also very beneficial. Moksha comes from understanding the shruti vakyas. When we have lingering doubts about "tat" and about "tvam", then how can these be simply ignored??how can we put "unnecessary" labels on these questions and lock them away?? I do agree that when it comes to Maya, it is best to not enquire "into" it, as Swami Vidyaranya-ji himself warns in the Panchadasi.

  It is like solving a jigsaw puzzle - you have so many pieces strewn around, that do not fit, slowly some small pieces fit, and then some, and before you know it, pieces that did not find the right place before now are so obvious. And so it is with atma-vichara - if a particular concept, an idea, does not seem to "make sense", do not discard it (- more importantly do not discard Vedanta!), but let it simmer in the depths of your intellect, introspect, and wait for MayaDevi herself to uncover the cloaks of her own Mysteries.
  And this is precisely where both karmayoga, and bhaktiyoga play a very important role - they dont directly give you answers, but they help prepare the mind, and render it fertile, so as to enable the intellect to finally "get it". Most indispensible factor of ALL is a Guru, a shrotriya brahmanishta, who can directly provide you with answers as and when these very valid and critical questions arise.

  PraNAms Shyamji!

Again, an excellent example. Your examples are great fun to read.

But, why do I have dreams? My answer has been that its because I am limited.
I consider having a dream delusional/limiting. In the dream I saw an old man
who I did not know before. He explained things that I did not know before. I
could have this dream because I am limited in knowledge (plus space, time,
and all other dimensions), but if I had infinite knowledge (and was not
limited in anyway) would I have a dream? I think not. Hence I assume that
Brahman could not have a dream. That is causing me to have these doubts. Do
you think that my assumption is wrong?

Hari OM!
