Pranams Senani-ji,

Thank you very much for the response. I am hoping that Sastriji, Maheshji
and all other scholars would weigh in on this :)

I have great difficulty with this concept. Since Brahman is pure, complete,
knowledge (omniscience), is it not reasonable to argue that it could not be
deluded by anything including power of Maya (which itself is not separate
from the Brahman)? If Brahman could be (prevailed upon), then one could
argue that Brahman is not omniscient or omnipotent? Could you kindly explain
where I am going wrong?

Prabha
