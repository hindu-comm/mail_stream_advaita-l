muNDaka upanishad says satyameva jayate. taittirIya upanishad says brahman is satyam, jNAnam, anantam. bRhadAraNyaka upanishad says brahman is satyasya satyam. We have so many instances of brahman and satya being associated in the upanishads. How important is it for an aspiring brahma jNAni to speak the truth? Is it necessary that he or she must not speak lies?
