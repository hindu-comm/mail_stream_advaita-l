Sri Gurubhyo Namaha

*Psychological Wisdom and Reasons for Courage*

Brooding over impure thoughts adds to their evil force. Do not become a prey
to these haunting dangerous thoughts. Entertain counter-thoughts; good
sublime thoughts of God and His Divine Glory. By japa, fasting, charity and
selfless service, you can easily destroy the impurities of the complex mind.
The evil thoughts, for lack of attention and by the pressure of good
thoughts, will die a natural death. What was the state of Jagai, Madhai and
Ajamila in the beginning? Were they not rogues of the first waters? Where is
the cause for despair? Be sincere and make efforts.
