Namaskarams,

  I recently had an occasion to read an online article that discussed Advaita & Dvaita and while reading certain passages in it, some doubts crept up in my mind reg Dvaita. So I thought I would check with you regarding the same and hence request you to clarify.

  The following is the passage :-

  "The World is true. An object is defined to be 'True' if it exists in any one of the three divisions of tim i.e. past, present or future. For instance, we see a temple and the knowledge 'This is a temple' arises. The temple is 'true' because the temple continues to exist. 
  Suppose, we mistake a rope to be a snake. After close inspection, we realize that it is not a snake but only a rope. Now, the knowledge regarding the snake is a false one and hence the snake is also 'false'. Since the knowledge regarding the world is not as said in the above illustration, the world is 'true'."

  I found this Dvaitic exposition reg the snake and the rope to be quite logical as opposed to the well-known Advaitic exposition offered for the same.

  Request knowledgable people to kindly clarify the same for me.

  Regards,
Karthik
