Principle and its Perversion-I
There is the truism, i.e., "Viaragya is really a mental state, mental
detachment." The mind takes hold of this definition to justify a heedless
sensual life without self-restraint or principle. The argument will always
be, "O! I am not attached to all this. I can rise above it in a moment. I
enjoy it as a master. Mentally I am detached." Contact with Vishyas has
toppled down even tapasvin like Vishwamitra. Therefore, do not take vairagya
lightly. Cultivate vairagya diligently. Safeguard your vairagya carefully.
Be vigilant. Watch the mind!
