*Sadhana Panchakam*
*By Adi Shankaracharya
Translated by Swami Chinmayananda
Published by Chinmaya Mission, Mumbai*

1.
Study the Vedas daily.
Perform diligently the duties (karmas) ordained by them.
Dedicate all those actions (karmas) as worship unto the Lord.
Renounce all desires in the mind.
Wash away the hoards of sins in the bosom.
Recognise that the pleasures of sense-objects (samsar) are riddled with
pain.
Seek the Self with consistent endeavour.
Escape from the bondage of 'home'.

2.
Seek companionship with Men of Wisdom.
Be established in firm devotion to the Lord.
Cultivate the virtues such as Shanti etc.,
Eschew all desire-ridden actions.
Take shelter at a Perfect Master (Sat-Guru).
Everyday serve His Lotus feet.
Worship "Om" the Immutable.
Listen in depth, the Upanishadic declarations.

3.
Reflect ever upon the meaning of the Upanishadic commandments, and take
refuge in the Truth of Brahman.
Avoid perverse arguments but follow the discriminative rationale of the
Sruti (Upanishads).
Always be absorbed in the attitude (bhav) – "I am Brahman".
Renounce pride.
Give up the delusory misconception – "I am the body".
Give up totally the tendency to argue with wise men.

4.
In hunger diseases get treated.
Daily take the medicine of Bhiksha-food.
Beg no delicious food.
Live contentedly upon whatever comes to your lot as ordained by Him.
Endure all the pairs of opposites: heat and cold, and the like.
Avoid wasteful talks.
Be indifferent.
Save yourself from the meshes of other peoples' kindness.

5.
In solitude live joyously.
Quieten your mind in the Supreme Lord.
Realise and see the All-pervading Self every where.
Recognise that the finite Universe is a projection of the Self.
Conquer the effects of the deeds done in earlier lives by the present right
action.
Through wisdom become detached from future actions (Agami).
Experience and exhaust "Prarabdha" the fruits of past actions.
Thereafter, live absorbed in the bhav - "I am Brahman" !

Om Tat Sat,
sriram
