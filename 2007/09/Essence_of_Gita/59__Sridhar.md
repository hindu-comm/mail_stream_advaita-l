                                  :Essence of Gita: 

There was a great queen endowed with extreme intelligence who loved to hear Bhagavad Gita.

She invited many great scholars, and requested to teach "Bhagavad Gita." 

The day was fixed and one of the most reputed scholars, started the discourse, chanting the first verse: "DHRAMA KSHETHRE KURU KSHETHRE."

She immediately requested to stop the discourse, saying, I have learned the essence of Gita. Everybody was wonder-struck, and requested her to explain the essence further.

She meticulously rearranged the words used, saying:"KSHETHRE KSHETHRE DHRAMAM KURU", implying, wherever you are, perform your actions which are firmly rooted in Dharma.
