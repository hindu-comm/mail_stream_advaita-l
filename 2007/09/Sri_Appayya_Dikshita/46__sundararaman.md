  Ram Ram
  Sri Appiah Dikshitha's book Siddhanthalesa Sangraha was published by
Srimad Appiah Dikshithendra Granthavali prakasana Samithi Secunderabad
edited by Sri SR Krishnamurhti Sastrigal.Sri Sastri has prepared a 32 page
Executive Summary which is itself a superb document.Unfortunately this book
is not currently available and the Samithi people do not reply for letters
or emails.Can anybody throw some light as to where the old published copies
may be available?
  Thanks
  K Sundararaman
