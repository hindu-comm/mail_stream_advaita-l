Dear Mr. Sundararaman,

I remember browsing Sri Appayya Dikshita's works at Jayalakshmi Indological
book house. Please enquire at Jayalakshmi Indological book house at
Apparswamy Koil Street, the street opposite to Sanskrit College, Mylapore,
Chennai. Their phone number is 044- 24990539. Sunday is a holiday for them.
