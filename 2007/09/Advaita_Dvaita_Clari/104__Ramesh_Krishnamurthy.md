Yes, from the paramarthika perspective, notions of good & bad deeds
are unreal. Karma itself is unreal.

One can understand this through an incident in Sri Sankara
Bhagavatpada's life. When he was in Varanasi, he discussed Advaita
with several scholars. One day, he was walking through a lane when an
elephant charged at him. He jumped aside to avoid getting crushed. A
scholar who observed the incident asked - "if the elephant was mithya,
why did you jump aside?", to which the acharya replied, "the elephant
was mithya and my jumping aside was mithya too".

Even moksha and samsara are unreal, from a paramarthika perspective
