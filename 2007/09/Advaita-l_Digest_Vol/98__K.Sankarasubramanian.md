I have a question to ask on Advaitin.. 

I understand that the Advaita saints are also called "Eka Dandi", which
means that, they have a single Dhandam (stick) representing Athman &
Bhraman are one and the same

Does it mean that Dwvaita saints always hold two Dhandams (stick)
jointly in their hands on the principles of dwaitha?  

Just a small clarification please if it is not objectionable
