Namste:

  There is a shloka pertaining to trdaNDa sa.nnyasa in manusmR^iti -


  vaagdaNDo.atha manodaNDaH kaayadaNDastathaiva cha |
  yasyaite nihitaa buddhau tridaNDiiti sa uchyate || manu. 12.10||

Meaning - That man is called a tridandin in whose mind these three, the control over his speech (vaagdaNDa), the control over his thoughts (manodaNDa), and the control over his body (kaayaadaNDa), are firmly tied together using intellegance.

  AFAK - These type of sa.nnyaasii's do not have to get rid of shiikkhaa, suutra and kacchha.  They can reenter gR^ihasta aashrama any time.  In mahabharat at the time of subhadraaharaNa arjuna embraced tridaNDi sa.nnyaasa at the recommendation of kR^iShNa.  Thus arjuna managed to stay in the city of dvaarakaa for four months.

  In Bhddha literature this is referenced as "tedaNDika".

  Regards,

  Dr. Yadu

Well, not sure with dvaita saints, but all vishishtAdvaita saints have
tridanda (3 sticks).
