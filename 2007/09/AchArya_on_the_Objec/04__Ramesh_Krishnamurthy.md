Indeed, translation is an art. Also, the same word may be understood
differently depending on one's vasana-s. To me, delusion is a somewhat
negative term - a better equivalent for avidya than maya. The negative
term has its utility in the sense that it prods the seeker to overcome
it.
Maya to me has positive connotations - the wondrous world of name and
form, which is empirically real, of which the shastra-s are a part, in
which the laws of physics operate, which pulsates with energy, and so
forth.

As they say Shiva is Shakti at rest, Shakti is Shiva in motion!
