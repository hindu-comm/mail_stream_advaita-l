The nirguNa here is not the carbon but the property (interpreted as intrinsic dharma).

  IMO - Finding and utilizing the trikaalaatiita dharma is the real spirituality.  Thus I am trying to fish out the spirituality.

Dear Yadu-ji,

As an advaitin one's goal is to realize 'nirguNa
brahman' which is *property less* and devoid of *names
and forms*. Isn't it? This is what shruti tells us
repeatedly. Anyways, thanks for updating the different
utilities of carbon. :-))

Yours in Sri Ramakrishna,

Br. Vinayaka.
