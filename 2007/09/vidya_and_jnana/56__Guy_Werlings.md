sambhAvya shrii Ramesh,

Thank you very much for your kind attempt to anwer my query. I read 
immediately and quite eagerly the sanskrit text of the  muNDakopaniShad but 
could not find the searched expression "saH vidyA yaH vimuktaye".

If you or any other member of the list could help me, I should be very 
thankful to you.
