Dear Sriramji.
It is stated by HE Shri shri Bharati Teertha Swamiji that One can attain 
Godlihood  by doing the following

"If people spend their free time reading spiritual books, chanting the name
of Ishwara and performing worship of God, they will attain higher good"

I am reminded by one Stanza of "Viveka Chudamani"  by Shankaracharya wherein
it states:
"Vadantu ShastrANi Yajantu Devan, Kurvantu KarmANi Bhajantu DevatAha 
Atmaikya BOdhena vinApi Muktihi na sidhyati brahma shatantarEpi."
Another he says "Na Yogena na SankhyEna karmaNA nO na VidyayA, 
BrahmAtmaikabOdhEna MokShaha sidhyati nAdyatha"
and many more on the same issue.

Thus I feel that one cannot attain Godlihood or Moksha  just by reading 
books or by chanting the Names of Ishwara or by performing the worship. They 
have to remove Ajnana and realize the reality that "I am Brahman" and this 
world is unreal.
However these will serve as a way/Marga to attain the 4th Purushartha.
Regards,
Subramanya UH
