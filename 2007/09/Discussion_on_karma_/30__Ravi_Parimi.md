Nice point. I've also seen instances where Sanyasis participate in
homas, pujas, social activities (supposedly to save our heritage),
start proceedings of weddings etc. Such activities are unbecoming of
sanyasis - seems like most of these activities are motivated by
financial pursuits (in terms of developing their ashrams) or gaining
fame..
