Could you please provide a reference/example for the above statement? I 
thought it was fairly obvious to all list members that saMnyAsins in the 
advaita tradition formally renounce all karma, whether Srauta or smArta.

e.g. when the sacred thread (yajnopavIta) is worn, the saMkalpa refers to 
"Srauta-smArta-vihita-nityakarma-anushThAna". The renunciation of all karma 
by saMnyAsins is symbolically represented by throwing away the yajnopavIta 
too.

Regards,
Vidyasankar
