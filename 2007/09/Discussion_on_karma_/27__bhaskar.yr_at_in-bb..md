Can you explain Shrouta Karma and Smarta Karma?

praNAms
Hare Krishna

I had asked the same question in Shrouta group sometime back...Here is the
reply from Sri Ganeshprasad prabhuji:

// quote //

Shrouta karmas are primarily those ordained by the vedas. Example would be
soma yagas, agnihotra etc.
Shrouta is prakriti to smartha and griya karmas. Smartha karmas and grihya
karmas are those ordained by
the smritis and grihya sutras. They are the shodasha samskaras,
prayaschitta prayogas etc. Shrouta karmas
are usually performed in tretagni while smartha and grihya karmas are
performed in either the loukikagni
or grihyagni.
