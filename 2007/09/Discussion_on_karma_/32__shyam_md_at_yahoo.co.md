One has to be careful here in differentiating between a ashrama sannyasi and a jnani.

If there is a ashrama sannyasi who still has notional do-ership and is not "realized", then certainly he needs to be careful in ensuring that any karma he does is BOTH in keeping with the dharmic injunctions as well as is performed with the sole aim of attaining chittashuddhi and chittanaischalyam. On the other hand, in the case of a jnani, saying a jnani does anything itself is a erroneous notion, so where is the question of any do's and don't's - with regards to the type of karma. A jnani's body-mind allows the Cosmic Will to continue to utilize it for the benefit of humanity.
The jnani being bereft of any ahankara entertains no notion of do-ership - so how can anything be either proscribed and how can anything be prohibited - the "entity" that these injunctions could have been applied to is dead and gone - so whether he lives in a Himalayan cave as a mauni-baba or in the midst of the din of the metropolis seemingly undertaking mundane secular activities - makes no difference whatsoever to his equipoise - which is ever-established in the Self.

I agree the fact that sanyAsis are not bound to nitya karma but saying that
they are not allowed to perform puja, homas etc seems abit too far fetched.

Let us remember that bhagavadpAda also performed his mothers funeral rites
even though it was against tradition. 

If our saints do not show us the path of rituals and puja to do, then who
will? 

In the swaminArAyana sampradaya, the sanyAsis are still bound to do karma,
regardless if they are 'realised' or not. 

I was also just looking at some pictures of mahA sannidhAnam of shR^igeri
matha doing puja and abhisheka on deities, is this also wrong?

Kind Regards,

Krunal
