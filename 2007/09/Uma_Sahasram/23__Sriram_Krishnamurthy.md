Dear all,
This regarding a query by a list member regarding Uma Sahasram. This work
was the Magnum Opus of Sri Kavyakanta Vashishta Ganapthi Muni, disciple of
Bhagavan Ramana Maharshi. Sri Nayana(a name kept by Sri Ramanar) is the
incarnation of Dundi Ganapathi of Varanasi.He was the person responsible for
naming  Brahmana Swami who was engaged in natural Tapas at Thiruvannamalai,
Tamilnadu (Arunachala) as Bhagavan Ramana Maharshi, after ascertaining his
original name was Venkataramanan. Sri Kavyakanta strong conviction was that
Sri Ramana was the incarnation of Sri Subrahmanya(Thiru Muruga in Tamil).

The work Sri Uma Sahasram can be found at the following link. For Devanagari
please click the respective parts under *Slokas in
Devanagari.*
