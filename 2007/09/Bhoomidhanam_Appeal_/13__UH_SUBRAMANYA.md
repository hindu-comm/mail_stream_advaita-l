Thank you Bhaskarji for opening my eyes. Now I am convinced that even 
Karmakand is also necessary mainly for 2 reasons for Chitta sudhi and for 
Nitya Naimittika Upasana. They are essential to prepare us for Jnana but 
they directly don't lead to Moksha. I was of the opinion that we can neglect 
Karmakanda if we follow Vedanta Darshan.
Regards,
Subramanya UH
