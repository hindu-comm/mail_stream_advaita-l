The Core of Conscious Spiritual Effort
So vehement, self-assertive and rebellious is the egoistic self of man that
it refuses to be changed from its vicious state to state of virtue, goodness
and saintliness. It is a great blunder to think that the mere act of
renunciation is a sufficient achievement in the spiritual life. The
eradication of egoism in all its aggressive forms comprises the very core of
spirituality and all spiritual Sadhanas.
