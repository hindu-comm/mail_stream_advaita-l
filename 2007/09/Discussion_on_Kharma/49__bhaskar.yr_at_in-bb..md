A paramahamsa sanyasi (like those belonging to the Shankara Order)
does not have shikha, upaviita and bahir agni. All the ahutis are
given by him to the jnAnAgni. Even gayatri japam is not there for
them. They alone are competent to do pranava japam.

How about pooja & upAsana??  is it recommended for saMnyAsins  to do
*shodashOpachAra pUja* to presiding deity at their respective place ??
We've seen, in advaita tradition, saMnyAsins (including peeTAdhipati-s)
doing *dEvatArchana as per paNchAyatana pUjA method..., I heard my parama
guruji Sri SSS also used to do pUja to kOdaNda rAma... I am just curious to
know, what saMkalpa they do before pUja...what they do instead of Achamana,
praNAyAma etc.  Is there any separate method for saMnyAsi-s to do
dEvatArchana?? Any info..??
