This has reference to the Discussion on Kharma Khanda.Though the sanyasins
are free from karma khanda,they do have certain karmas pertaining to their
order.For a Paramahamsa sanyasin like Shankara there may not be karmas,but
throughout his B.S bhashya he also refers to different karmas,perfomed by
sanyasins.this shows that he was familiar with the karmas.Also,in the B.G
there is a discussion on the slokah where karma khanda is extolled,where
in it is said"na buddhibedham janayet..........vidvanyuktam samacharan"-A
vidvan should not create division in the mind of the karmis and must
himself fulfill them well.There is also a detailed discussion in the
Bhashya with the tika,where it is discussed what sort of karma is to be
performed by the sanyasin.
