Dear Shri Shyam

Fantastic explanation on Jivatama paramatama [Ayikya] oneness by giving a
beautifful example oft quoted in the vedanta - water & the wave. Advaitam
well explained for our understanding.

My understanding of what you explained is as follows:

the worldly experiences we have are belonging to the Jivatman the limited
individual with I ness and my ness & the moment the Jivatman understands
that he is brahman then the limited feeling disappears & he looks in all the
jivatman the brahman like many waves are there but all the waves should have
the understanding that they belong to the water only & their existence
depend on the water only.

Hari Om

Kalyanasundaram
