Here is a Sloka from chapter 3 of sanatsujAtIyam which must be encouraging
for beginners in the study of advaita who find difficulty in understanding
some of the finer points.

kAlena pAdam labhate tathAyam

tathaiva pAdam guruyogataSca |

utsAhayogena ca pAdamRcchet

SAstreNa pAdam ca tato'bhiyAti ||13

13. The disciple learns one-fourth from the guru, one-fourth by his own
effort, one-fourth by discussion with his co-disciples, and one-fourth by
the efflux of time. (The expression 'through the Sastra' in the last line
means 'by discussion with other disciples' according to Sri Sankara).

 Thus the points which are not clear in the beginning will become clear in
course of time as the student keeps on studying.
