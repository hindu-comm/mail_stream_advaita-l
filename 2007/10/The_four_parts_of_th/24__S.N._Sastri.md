Dear Shri Subramanya,

It is interesting to see that the verse quoted by you has exactly the same
meaning.

Regards,

S.N.Sastri


Dear Sastriji,
PraNamAmi,
After reading your posting, I am reminded of another shloka from Mahabharat
which gives the same meaning:

AcharyatpAdamAdattE
pAdamshishya swamedhayA
pAdam sabrahmacharibhyah
pAdam kAlakramenacha

Regards,
Subramanya UH
