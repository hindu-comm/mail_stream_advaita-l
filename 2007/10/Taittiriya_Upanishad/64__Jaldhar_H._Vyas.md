I'm also writing to the list because the information may be of interest to 
others.

The Vanamala tika on taittiriyopanishad by Swami Achyutakrshnananda Tirth 
a prolific 17th century writer and commentator on Advaita Vedanta was most 
recently published Chinmaya Foundation of Education and Culture, Madras,
