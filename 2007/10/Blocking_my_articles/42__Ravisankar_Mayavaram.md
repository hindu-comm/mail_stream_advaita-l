Jaldhar,

Can we do something delete Ger's introduction?

In ambaa-l we used give a choice, whether the intro can be posted on
the archive. Later we modified that to a warning stating that it will
be posted on the internet (as former became a real pain).

We should do the same - that is put in CAPS  that - WE WILL POST YOUR
SELF INTRODUCTION ON OUR ARCHIVE (which is public).

Ger,

It  has been on our list policy since inception to have a public
archive. I thought Europe is more liberal than the US.

Ravi
