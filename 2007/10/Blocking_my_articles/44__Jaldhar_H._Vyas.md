I am dealing with this offline but list members should bear in mind that 
anything they write here is going to be publicly available both on 
advaita-vedanta.org and at search engines and other places on the 
Internet.

I agree with Ravi that we can make this clearer.  I'm currently 
overhauling the subscription process so I will bear this in mind.

And fwiw, even right now, when posting introductions, I edit out 
addresses, phone numbers and other sensitive private information.
