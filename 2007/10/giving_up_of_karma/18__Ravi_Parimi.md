Namaste,

Most vaidika karmas are kamya karmas only - done with a motive to
fulfill one's desires. While these karmas may be performed by
grihastas, sanyasis shouldn't have any need to perform these, as they
do not desire any of the glorious results that the vaidika karmas hold
in store.

In the case of a nitya karma like sandhya vandanam, the mantras at
several places emphasize doership of the karmi  (prataH sanDhyAM
kariShyAmi, .... araBhey etc..) Also, what use is saMkalpa to a
sanyasi, who has renounced gotra, nAma etc?
