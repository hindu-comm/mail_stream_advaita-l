praveen:
Thanks for bringing out an important point. To extend my
understanding, using the point you make is that: the more such
'obvious' reasons exist, the more difficult it would be to be a
parvrAjaka in the 'physical' sense, and more 'inconsistencies' will be
observed moving forth. And as you rightly say, there is no point
looking for a justification beyond this... and that will hold good,
hopefully!
