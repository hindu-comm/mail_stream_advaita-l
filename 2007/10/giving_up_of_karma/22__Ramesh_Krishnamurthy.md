Bhaskar-ji, you have misunderstood my question totally. dharmashAstra
verdicts are not the issue at all.

I am trying to get a *technical* understanding of what is meant by
renunciation of karma when one enters the saMnyAsa Ashrama.

In other words, is it a matter of tradition that one stops vaidika
karma on entering saMnyAsa or does it have anything to do with the
advaitic non-acceptance of jnAnakarmasamuccaya. If it is the former,
the matter ends there, but if it is the latter then more explanations
are in order.
