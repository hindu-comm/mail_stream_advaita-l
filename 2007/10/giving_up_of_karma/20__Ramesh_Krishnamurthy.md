Your points above don't answer my question. Whether most vaidika
karma-s or only a small minority are kAmya karma-s is immaterial to my
question. Even gRhastha-s are generally advised to avoid kAmya
karma-s. If avoiding kAmya karma-s was the point, then saMnyAsI-s
should simply avoid them alone. Why avoid nitya & naimittika karma-s.

On nitya karma-s emphasizing doership, the same holds true of any
number of pUjA-s also. They are full of words like samarpayAmI,
dhArayAmI, kariShyAmI, and so forth.

The same point as above. If kAmya karma-s are the issue, then only
they should be avoided, why avoid all vaidika karma-s?

And again, if a saMnyAsI can perform candramaulIshvara pUjA, SrIvidyA
upAsanA, etc then what is the issue with vaidika karma-s?

I am aware that certain types of saMnyAsi-s wear yaj~nopavIta etc. We
had a recent discussion on that as well. My question was in the
context of daSanAmI saMnyAsI-s only who are supposed to give up
vaidika karma.
