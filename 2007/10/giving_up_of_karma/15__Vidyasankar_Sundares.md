This is indeed a problem in today's society. Being a maThAdhipati and retaining the
ideal of saMnyAsa to the best extent possible is a highly challenging thing in any
age and is perhaps more so today, given the state of communication technology.
Sadly, if we who live in civil society only offer respect to the commercially successful
swamis, then there is great danger of the very ideal getting lost. It then becomes the
responsibility of those of us who know otherwise, to lead by example.

Regards,
Vidyasankar
