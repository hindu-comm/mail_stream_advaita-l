Incidentally, this reminds me of the old debate on whether the
bRhadAraNyaka "enjoins" SravaNa, manana, nididhyAsana (SMN). It was
said that this is only a "recommendation" and not a vidhi.

Taking off from the above, is there a niShedha on saMnyAsI-s
performing vaidika karma-s, or is it only a "recommendation"?

One might say that dhyAna, SMN, etc are very purpose of taking
saMnyAsa and these are not be regarded as actions. In other words, it
is only ritual action that must be avoided. If that were to be the
case, then surely any mantra-based upAsanA should be avoided.
Possibly, saMnyAsI should not go to temples either. But that does not
square up with facts.
