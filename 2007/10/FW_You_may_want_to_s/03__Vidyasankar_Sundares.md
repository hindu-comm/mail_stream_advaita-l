I got the following email from an interested reader of the list archives. The cAturmAsya observances have just got over. Typically, it is a practice for various pundits and vaidika scholars to congregate in the presence of a maThAdhipati and hold discussions on various issues pertaining to the SAstras. The following link may be helpful for those list members who are interested in calendrical calculations. It will also show the general reader that traditional Indian astronomical calculations are still being done and carried forth vigorously.

Best regards,
Vidyasankar
