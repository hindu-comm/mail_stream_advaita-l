You are right, I should have stated that differently.  Perhaps we can say 
it has chitta but not chaitanya?  Well, in any case I don't think we will 
see many rocks applying to join the list :-)

You are also right.  But it has been observed many times in the past on 
this list that advaita is not "one" but "not two"  That's an important 
distinction because "two" is the natural viewpoint for the human species 
and to get from understanding "two" to understanding "not two" is the goal 
of sadhana.  Identification of Brahman with an ever-widening set of 
objects is a quite valid means to that end.  The danger for the sadhaka 
would be to consider a piece of metal or a rock (or even God or "the 
self") to EXCLUSIVELY be Brahman.  The only way to permanently ensure this 
mistake is not made is sannyasa --  withdrawal from the objects of the world.
