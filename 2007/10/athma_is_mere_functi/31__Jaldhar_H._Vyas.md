It is the jiva that needs the body to function.  The whole point of 
Vedanta is to free the atma from needing the body!

And that atma is not a limited created entity but all-pervading Brahman.

Why does it matter?  A rock or piece of metal is as much Brahman as you or 
I except it lacks consciousness so it cannot know this.  If perchance it 
could develop consciousness and understand non-duality then it could 
achieve moksha just like you or I.

This is incidentally why I like to leave the word atma untranslated. 
"Soul" has too many connotations which confuse the issue.
