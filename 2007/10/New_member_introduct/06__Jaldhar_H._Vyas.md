Nameste. Pranaam. :)

I am ankur dave. from india. in internet I live with name as "ganu".
I am native from india. In india I am from rajasthan. and by caste I am
brahmin.

Just some months back I came to this site. And I was really looking for 
some site wher we are talking about vedas. I know some of the vedas and I 
can read. And other then this I can read other some sanskrit pujas too, 
all these things I learnt in my child-hood from our sanskrit teacher and 
who was master in reading all vedas and some other famous mantras. ( a 
kind of gurukul )

I have not such knowledge of Advaita Vedanta. But I will love to be part 
of this community. I think from this community I will get to know so many 
other things , which I am missing.

please approve my submission. :)
