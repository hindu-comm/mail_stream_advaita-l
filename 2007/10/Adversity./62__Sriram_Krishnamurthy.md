Dear all,

Source : Swami Sivananda.

*Adversity.*

 It draws out the faculties of the wise, makes the idle
industrious. A smooth ocean never made one a dexterous captain of a ship.
The storms of adversity rouse the faculties and talents of an individual
and generate prudence, skill, fortitude, courage, patience and
perseverance. Adversity makes one think, invent and discover. Great
persons and saints have been tried, smelted, polished and glorified
through the furnace of adversity

Om Tat Sat,
Sriram
