Dear Sri Vidyasankar
Thank you for the Email of Oct 3,2007.This is for the historical
information.That the monks belonged to the "Bhagavata sampradaya" as said
by me is corroborated by the website provided by Sri Ganesh ramachandran
himself.The website:http://www.dvaita.org/madhva/Anand T1.html.
The website reads"Madhva was known as Vasudeva,as a child,and was born in
response to a prayer by some brahmanas of the Bhagavata sampradaya......"
                                                        N.Srikanta.
