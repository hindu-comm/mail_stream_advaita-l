OIne thing I forgot. Let's keep this principle above in mind when
reading any book accepted by the tradition. A tradition will not form
around nonsensical ideas. Only thing is that I would change "pointing
out flaws" in the above to "pointing out alleged flaws", at least
regarding the mAdhavIyam. People have not found flaws in it for 700
years already, so I doubt if there are any. In any case, my personal
reading shows quite no flaws (for whatever that's worth).
