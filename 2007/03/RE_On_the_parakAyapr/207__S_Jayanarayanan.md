Here's another objection (probably brought up earlier in this
thread):

Did not Vishnu-in-Krishna's-body remain dharmic, whereas
Sankara-in-king's-body flouted the rules of dharma?


The above objection is raised by Sarasvati in the Madhaviya Sankara
Digvijayam (SD) when Sankara is about to ascend the Sarvajna-Pitha.
Sankara replies that the present body of his will not be tainted by
the actions of another body. Is this explanation valid? Yes!


The actions pertaining to two bodies need to be considered when
evaluating dharma:

1) Sankara-in-sannyasin's-body: Never flouted dharma.
2) Sankara-in-king's-body: Never flouted dharma (because the king is
permitted to behave sexually).

Therefore, even considering the rules of dharma, Sankara's actions
have been flawless.


As to the objection about Sankara "indulging" in sexuality, that has
already been answered in the previous email.

Regards,
Kartik
