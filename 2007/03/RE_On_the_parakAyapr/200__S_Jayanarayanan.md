Your objection could also be held against the Vishnu Purana or the
Bhagavatam:

"Why should Krishna play sexually with the Gopis at all? Why not
simply give them mukti by love/worship portrayed in a non-sexual
manner? Why the elaborate drama about Krishna stealing the Gopis'
clothes in a sexually charged environment?
*Mastery of yOga* by Vishnu could have been highlighted in a far far
better way by the author of the Vishnu Purana or the Bhagavatam (i.e.
Veda Vyasa!)..Dont you know how beautifully yogic powers have been
glorified in books like Autobiography of a Yogi, Living with the
Himalayan Masters etc.."

In case you missed my previous posting:

"The above objection is raised by Sarasvati in the Madhaviya Sankara
Digvijayam (SD) when Sankara is about to ascend the Sarvajna-Pitha.
Sankara replies that the present body of his will not be tainted by
the actions of another body. Is this explanation valid? Yes!

The actions pertaining to two bodies need to be considered when
evaluating dharma:

1) Sankara-in-sannyasin's-body: Never flouted dharma.
2) Sankara-in-king's-body: Never flouted dharma (because the king is
permitted to behave sexually).

Therefore, even considering the rules of dharma, Sankara's actions
have been flawless."

Regards,
Kartik
