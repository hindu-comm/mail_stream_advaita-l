Dear Bhaskar, Srikanta,

Please read bhagavatpAda's bhAshya on bRhadAraNyaka upanishad 6th adhyAya, 
4th brAhmaNa. You will find that he does not shy away from commenting upon 
sexual matters.

In the objections you both raise, it is all a question of attitudes. The 
authors of the Sankaravijaya texts didn't share the same viewpoints that 
many of us have nowadays. And from the mAdhavIya Sankaravijaya text (whoever 
its author may be), it is very apparent that the author knows advaita 
vedAnta very deeply and champions its philosophy. Don't you think he would 
have thought through all the supposed ramifications of the story?

The brahmajnAnI can seemingly act in ways that violate ordinary norms. There 
is no dosha here, because he has transcended the stage where one worries 
"kim ahaM sAdhu na akaravam? kim ahaM pApam akaravam?"

Vidyasankar
