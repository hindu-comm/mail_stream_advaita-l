I just quoted, without translation, from the end of the second section of 
the taittirIya upanishat (brahmAnanda vallI). It means, "Did I not do 
something right? Did I do something wrong / Did I sin?"

AnandaM brahmaNo vidvAn | na bibheti kutaScaneti | eta(g)M ha vA va na 
tapati | kim aha(g)M sAdhu nAkaravam | kim ahaM pApam akaravam iti |

The teaching here is that the perfect jnAnI, who knows the bliss of brahman, 
is unafraid of anything. Having transcended all action, both good and bad, 
he is untouched by either puNya or pApa and doesn't worry whether he does 
good or bad. Of course, this does not mean that he acts willfully. Rather, 
he has burnt up even the seed of will or desire to act.

Best regards,
Vidyasankar
