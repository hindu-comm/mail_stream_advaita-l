Shri Shyam subramanian,

  Thank you and very kind of you for the information on books by gnyAnAnanda Bharathi swaminah.  Many of the books like sachchidAnanda bhArathi vijayam, Jagatguru granthamAlA were earlier published by VANi vilAs press of Shrirangam.  Some of the other books I mentioned may be out of print. Or if tried may  be available in madurai.

  Regards
  N.Murthy
