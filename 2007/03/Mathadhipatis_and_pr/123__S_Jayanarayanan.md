Jagan, I have little doubt that JBS was in his own way trying to make
peace between the Sringeri and Kanchi Maths, but the fact is that the
whole article makes the implicit assumption that it is the duty of
the Mathadhipati to propagate dharma, which the Sringeri Acharya does
not agree with.

In other words:

Kanchi: "It the Mathadhipati's duty to propagate dharma."
Sringeri: "It is NOT the Mathadhipati's duty to propagate dharma."

The above fundamental schism in the views of the Maths has not been
recognized by RG, which makes the article somewhat ineffective.

Therefore, instead of writing:

"...the inaction of the person who was blamed was not due to inertia
or inability but due to nishta which belongs to a plane higher than
activity."

RG should have concluded:

"The Sringeri Acharya cannot be blamed for his inaction because it is
not the duty of the Mathadhipati to propagate dharma."

HH did support activism of dharma -- but he would not begin any such
movement, nor did he believe that it was *duty* to begin such a
movement, even though he was a Mathadhipati.

I have no comment on the above, but will point out one possible
misunderstanding below:

Note that the Sringeri Acharya would only lend his name in support of
a movement if it were begun by someone else, but never did he
consider the propagation of dharma to be his duty.

The more pressing question is -- does it mean that the common man
does not have to know dharma? Hardly, for the Sringeri Acharya made
it crystal clear that it was the *duty* of everyone to learn dharma!

---
G: Does Your Holiness mean then that it is better for them to remain
ignorant?

HH: Certainly not. It is their duty to learn, as I have pointed out
before. It is not for them to say that they remain in ignorance
because somebody else does not teach them.
---


Besides, the reason that HH did not propagate dharma is clear --
because HH strongly believed that if there is no desire to learn
dharma, there is no point teaching it:

---
G: Ordinarily it may be so. But learning of Dharma is not so simple. 

HH: Why not? Even now the intelligence which you have inherited from
a long line of saints and seers (sages) is sharp enough to grasp the
subtlest conceptions; even now your parents perform for you the
sacred ceremony of initiation (sometime between the ages of eight and
sixteen, when a Brahmin child begins to understand right from wrong,
he is initiated into Brahminical Dharma); even now there exist
innumerable works dealing with dharma in all its aspects; and even
now there exist a large number of competent teachers who will teach
you, if only you ask them to do so. What excuse then have you for
continuing in ignorance?

G: It may be, we have none, if only our attention is drawn to our
duty to learn; but is there not a corresponding duty on those who
know to teach?

HH: There is no such absolute duty. Those who know are bound to teach
only those who do not know, but seek to know. If they prefer to
remain in ignorance, the teachers are not to blame at all for not
attempting to teach them. 

G: There may still be persons who are ignorant not because they
prefer to be so but because they do not know at all that there is
something to learn. How many, for instance, know what an agnihotra or
a soma yaga is (couple of Brahminical rituals)? There are many who
have not even heard of these terms. Is it not the duty of the
Brahmins to tell them that there are such things to be performed by
the Brahmins?

HH: Have those persons even cared to ascertain what are the duties of
the Brahmins, the community to which they profess to belong? They say
that they are Brahmins and still want other Brahmins to tell them
what a Brahmin ought to do. Is that reasonable, especially when they
do not make the slightest attempt to know?
---

HH simply did not believe that teaching a person his/her dharma will
help if the person did not wish to learn about dharma. OTOH, if a
person really did seek to learn, then it is the duty of the teacher
to teach dharma.

I have not yet done this, but will do so soon.
