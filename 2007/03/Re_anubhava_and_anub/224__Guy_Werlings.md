Dear SrI Srikanta,

Namaste |

Thank you for your e-mail. When starting to write down about a personal 
reminiscence of a lecture I delivered a long time ago in Paris, I relied 
only on my memory and did not look at my notes of those days.

anubhava and sArvatrika anubhava come exactly in line with the examples that 
you are giving.

anubhUti appears in the Monnier-Williams as:     f. perception, knowledge 
from any source but memory;

but the word is mostly linked to the word aparokSha in the title of the 
famous treatise by San^karAcarya AparokSha anubhUti, where is seems to mean 
the direct, immediate, intuitive experience or perception of the invisible - 
the realization of Brahman. Thus anubhUti also seems to have the meaning of 
"experience", but with a special emphasis on "realization".

VandanAni,

Guy
