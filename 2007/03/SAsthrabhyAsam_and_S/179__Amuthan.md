i apologize for the above inaccuracy. the verse 'vAgvaikharI...' does
not assert the necessity of shAstra pANDitya. both this and the verse
'shabdjAlaM...' imply that shAstra pANDitya is fruitless unless it is
condusive to AtmasAkShAtkAra. the necessity of having a clear
understanding of the shAstrAs is known from verses like 'medhAvi
puruSho vidvAn UhApohavichakShaNaH'.
