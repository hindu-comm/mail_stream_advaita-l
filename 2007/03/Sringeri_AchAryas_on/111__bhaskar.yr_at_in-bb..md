One may ask whether it is appropriate to look for the cause of this
beginningless, seemingly endless, natural phenomenon called adhyAsa. Should

we accept it as such and not analyze it further?

praNAms Sri Ananda Hudli prabhuji
Hare Krishna

I know you dont want to discuss all these issues in detail due to your busy
schedule...kindly allow me to share my part of view on mUlAvidyA.

In the Agama prakaraNa of GaudapAda kArika adhyAsa/avidyA  has been
explained without any ambiguity.  And says adhyAsa is of three types i.e.
non-perception (agrahaNa) is the causal ignorance (kAraNAvidyA)  and
mis-understanding (anyaThAgrahaNa) & doubting (saMshaya) are the effective
ignorance (kAryAvidyA).  Whereas vyAkhyAnakAra-s says that mUlAvidyA is the
material cause for the universe and ahaNkAra and also three types of avidyA
i.e. agrahaNa, saMshaya & viparIta jnAna and at the same time they say that
it is mere kalpita (imaginative)...question is if it is mere imaginative it
would definitely not be the material cause for adhyAsa....if it is material
cause for adhyAsa it is not kalpita by adhyAsa.  And main problem is since
it is a thing (bhAvarUpa) it is impossible to remove it by any amount of
knowledge...

Anyway, let us not go into the details of it...I shall wait for your next
mail.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
