It is not only Padmapada, but also Sureshvara who accepts Ignorance
as a Material Cause:

http://www.advaita-vedanta.org/archives/advaita-l/1998-September/010134.html

"Further BUBhVa 1.4.371 (purushhavida brAhmaNa),

asya dvaita indrjAlasya yat.h upAdAnakAraNam.h |
aGYAnaM tat.h upAshritya brahma kAraNaM uchyate ||

Having relied on that ignorance which is the material cause of this
great magic of duality,
It is said that brahman is the cause [though there is no cause nor
effect, but brahman alone]."


Can Sureshvara be wrong too -- in ascribing a "Causal Power" to
Ignorance?

Kartik
