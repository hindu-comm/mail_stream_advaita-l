Dear Sirs,

I am Prem Pillai, belonging to Trivandrum. I am an engineering graduate 
with masters from IIT Madras. I work as a design engineer.

I have some familiarirty with Advaita Vedanta, mainly, thor' the works of 
Adi Shankara himself (translations of vivekachudamani, now reading 
brahmasutra bhashya), Swami Vivekananda, Swami Rama Tirtha etc. I have 
also read Sri Aurobindo.

I am a serious student (self taught) of Hindu philosophic traditions and 
would like to interact and discuss with people of similar interests.

Sincerely,
Prem
