dear sir,

   thank you very much for considering my entry into the group.  My name is
   shankar and I am 58 years of age.  I live in Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India.
   I am a translator.  I am deeply interested in Advaita.  I am an ardent
   admirer and devotee of Adi Shankara. I look forward to getting
   enlightenment from your learned scholars.

   thanking you,

   yours truly,

   shankar
