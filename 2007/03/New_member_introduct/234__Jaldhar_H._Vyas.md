Hi,

My name is Varun Sud, and I am working in a company at Seattle. I am 23 
years of age, and have studied some works of Vivekananda. I also had some 
interest in ISKCON. But I get confused by their claims about 
Shankaracharya, and I am hoping to get enlightened from the members of the 
forum so that I get a correct picture of what Shankara taught. Nothing 
like learning advaita from advaitins.

   ~Varun.
