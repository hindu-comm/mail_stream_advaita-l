    My name is Srikar Rajamani and I am a computer software professional
living in California, USA. I am a devotee of Shri Shankara Bhagavatpada,
and a student of his philosophies.

   I came across your website, and feel it would be a good satsang for me
to learn & discuss about Advaita, and share my inputs, should I have any.

  I hope this brief introduction is sufficient to be added as a member of
the list. Please let me know if you need further details.

   Looking forward to hearing from you and being added to the list.



With best regards,

Srikar Rajamani.
