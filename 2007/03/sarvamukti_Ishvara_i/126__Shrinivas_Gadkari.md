Namaste,

Some thoughts on this topic, with specific reference 
to Gita chapter 15:

1. Broadly speaking there are two entities: kSara 
   puruSa(-s) and puruSottama. 
2. kSara puruSa-s exists in the realm of mAyA, 
   puruSottama is the "One" beyond mAyA.
3. Within kSara puruSa-s there exist levels based on 
   "spiritual evolution". Let us represent these 
   levels by: ....., L(N-1), L(N), L(N+1), ....
4. In general, L(n), with n ranging from -INF to 
   + INF (INF = infinity)
5. Define the limiting kSara puruSa : 
   lim n -> +INF L(n) = akSara puruSa.
6. Ishvara is this limiting condition, attainable 
   only asymptotically.

Regards,
Shrinivas
