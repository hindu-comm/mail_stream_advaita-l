Dear list members,



Is there an institution/patashala/gurukula/ where both traditional
education (principally Vedas) as well as loukika (modern) education are
simultaneously imparted (with stress on traditional education)? I need
this information as I plan to have my son study Vedas as primary
education and modern education as secondary and I myself not competent
to teach Vedas/shastras. Any information will be extremely helpful. My
son now is just 4 month-old but I want to plan for it and if there is no
alternative I intend to start one.



Thanks,

RAM
