Dear Sri Werlings,

It is good to see a post from you after such a long time. We could all 
certainly benefit from your words backed by long experience.

Unfortunately, that often happens. On the other hand, the traditional Indian 
view has been "vAde vAde jAyate tattvabodhaH." If by the word vAda, we 
intend dialogue, then one can indeed keep truth as the goal, instead of 
getting distracted by negative connotations of the word debate.

>·                     Another of my own guidelines was formulated like 
>this: «whatever is not indispensable to do, it is indispensable not to do - 
>whatever is not indispensable to think, say or write, it is in dis pensable 
>not to think, say or write».

That would also be a wise course to follow for all of us.

Best regards,
Vidyasankar
