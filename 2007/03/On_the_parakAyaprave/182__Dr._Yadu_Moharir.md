  Namste:

  This discussion reminds me of two wonderful quotes:

  Regards,

  Dr. Yadu

  ============================================

  âWhen a thing is new, people say: âIt is not true.â 
Later, when its truth becomes obvious, they say: âIt is not important.â 
Finally, when its importance cannot be denied, they say: 
'Anyway, it is not new.ââ

--William James (1842-1910)


    All truth passes through three stages: 
   First, it is ridiculed; 
   Second, it is violently opposed; and 
   Third, it is accepted as self-evident. 

-- Arthur Schopenhauer (1788-1860)
