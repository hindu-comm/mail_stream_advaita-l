I read with interest the xcellent writing on the S.B intoduction with
quotes by SSS.But there is a point which needs clarification:
"Therefore,those who imagine that the object superimposed is primarily
meant by the term avidya,and it is that which has got to be removed by
true knowledge,not only do violence to Shankara's words,but also disregard
a fact of nature and even common sense, in as much as no one believes that
the apparent silver in nacre has yet to be removed first by the true
knowledge of nacre,and not one's own false notion of it"(S.BIntro)

could she clarify this without using negative sentences?
                     Bhava Shankara Desika me saranam.    Om namo Narayanaya.
                                    N.Srikanta.
