Humble writings always make pleasant reading. Humility is the hallmark
of a seeker. Scholarship should be the hallmark of one who has the
Atma anubhava or the experienced. Without the experience of the truth
no amount of exposition can convey the meaning because there is no
conviction without experiencing the truth.

I like this exposition particularly. As you have pointed out, no
amount of scholarly investigation or even a teaching about the
"gradations" in blue, can bring the student close to understanding
that the color itself is an illusion.

Jagan.
