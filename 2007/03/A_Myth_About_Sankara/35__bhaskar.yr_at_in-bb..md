What I interpret Karthik as meaning is that Shankaracharya is not an
authority by virtue of being Shankaracharya but only by virtue of being a
true expositor of shastras.

sAshtAnga praNAms Sri Jaldhar Vyas prabhuji
Hare krishna

I dont think Sri Karthik prabhuji is questioning the personality status of
shankarachArya in advaita sampradAya...his questioning is about the *very
validity* of shankara bhAshya within the advaita sampradAya.  So it is more
of a doctrinal status of shankara bhAshya within advaita saMpradAya !!!  I
dont thik shruti & shankara bhAshyas relationship is something like text
book & digest to say text is more authoritative & digest is lower in status
...shankara's bhAshya vAkya  is shruti vAkya samAna since it has come from
the very mouth of *brahmajnAni* whatever brahmajnAni says it is on par with
shruti vAkya...We cannot simply label it as a lower standard authority that
too within the path of advaita vEdAnta..

Thanks for the clarification prabhuji...I humbly request you to participate
in the list activities more actively if your time permits.

Your humble servant
Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
