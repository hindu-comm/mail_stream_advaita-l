Exactly.

But Bhaskar's defense of Sankara's commentary as being an authority
on par with Sruti argues that this is because Sankara is a
Brahmajnani. No doubt Sankara was a Brahmajnani, but that still
doesn't make his statements equal to Sruti or Smriti in terms of
authority. This is precisely the reason that a Vartika-kara can go
against the Bhashya-kara when the Bhashya-kara goes against Sruti or
Smriti.

For the record: I never characterized SSS anywhere close to the above
terms, and do respect SSS for his devotion to Sankara.

I can accept SSS's doctrine as "loyal opposition" --  provided the
policy of the "ruling party" constituted by the Sankara Maths is
accepted as primary doctrine. It is like when we say, "exceptions
prove the rule", there must be a rule in the first place for there to
be an exception!
