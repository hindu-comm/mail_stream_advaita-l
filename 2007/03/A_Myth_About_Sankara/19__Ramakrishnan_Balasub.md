No, No, No! Both the Bhamatikaara and Viavaranakaara themselves say
that they AGREE with shankara. It is *misinformed* people who claim
that they disagree with sankara.

At the risk of repeating myself for the 50th gazillionth time,
citsukhaacaarya has shown how they BOTH agree with Sankara, although
the expositions are indeed different.

The case of Sureshvara is quite different, he explicitly says that
what Sankara said about sannyaasa was ***durukta*** and proceeds to
give an explanation based on smR^iti.

Two quite different situations indeed, and clearly "both sides  are
not wrong" as you claim. Only one side is wrong, and I know who it is
:-).
