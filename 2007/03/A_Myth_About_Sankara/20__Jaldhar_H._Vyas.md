Given that the bhamati and vivarana disagree with each other obviously 
only one can agree with Shankaracharya.  Now you say Chitsukhacharya 
reconciled bhamati and vivarana  with each other and with Shankara.  Well 
who is to say some recent Chitsukhacharya couldn't also reconcile Swami 
Sacchidanandendra too?

Which is further proof that shastra not a personality is the pramana 
doesn't it?

And tell me if a person can go as far as to say use a phrase like durukta 
without being disowned by his Guru or drummed out of town by that Gurus 
followers what exactly did SSS do which was so unforgivable?

is making a tempest in a teapot.
