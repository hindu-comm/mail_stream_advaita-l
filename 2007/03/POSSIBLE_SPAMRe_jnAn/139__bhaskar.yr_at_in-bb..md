Dear Bhaskar,

praNAms Sri Karthik prabhuji

Karthik prabhuji :

Many apologies for my past email in this thread. I had unfortunately
written it very quickly without giving it much thought.

bhaskar :

Oh!! no need for any apologies prabhuji....we are sailing in the same
boat...we are all jignAsu-s in the jnAna mArga..In that quest with
different perspective we do very often have to undergo situations like
this...

Karthik prabhuji :

I do look forward to reading your objective analysis of BU 3.5.1
though. If time permits, I shall write an objective reply to your
postings later.

bhaskar :

Take your time prabhuji, I am not in a hurry...If I strayed anywhere while
quoting bhAshya references, kindly do bring it to my notice.

Thanks,
Kartik

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
