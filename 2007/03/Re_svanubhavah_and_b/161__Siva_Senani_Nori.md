You are right; deSa, kAla, and vastu are oft quoted paricchedas, whereas the three guNas are not usually referred to as paricchedas. I stand corrected and better informed. Thank you.

i think AchArya is referring to the absence of desha, kAla and vastu
parichCheda in nirguNa brahman when he uses the term
'parichChedatrayashUnyatva'.
