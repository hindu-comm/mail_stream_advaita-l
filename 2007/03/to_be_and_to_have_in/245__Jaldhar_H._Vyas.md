I was interested but as you may have noticed I have not been very active 
of late.  Anyway as the respondents have said, the lack of "to have" is 
more due its replacement by the case system rather than any 
philosophical reason.  A few vestiges of this survive in English.  For 
instance you can say "I have a body" or "I am embodied."  There is no 
"have" in the second phrase but em- takes its place and the meaning is the 
same.
