Namaste,

I am interested in this question as well and hope our Sanskrit
scholars will shed some light on this. Here is my understanding:

A direct translation of <to have> may not be present in Sanskrit, at
least in the way we understand <to have> v. <to be> in English. The
usage of kta and ktavatu pratyayas, however, replace the need for a
<to have>. For example, consider the dhaatu kRu=to do.
In the three li~ggas, we have,
(1) kRu + kta "=" kRutaH / kRutaa / kRutam.
(2) kRu + ktavatu "=" kRutavaan / kRutavatee / kRutavat


Both (1) and (2) have the same meaning "something/someone that/who has
done". They are both adjectives. Their usage depends on
kartari/karmaNi prayoga (active/passive voice) and some special cases
(gatyarthaka dhaatus).

kta and ktavatu permit sentence construction without using verbs. Such
a construction would be literally translated as "I (am) the one who
possesses the body." The am (as in, I am)=asmi is optional.

<to get> = praapnoti.
