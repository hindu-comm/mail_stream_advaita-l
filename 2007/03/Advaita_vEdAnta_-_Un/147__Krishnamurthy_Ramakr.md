Pranam,
Thanks for Unit 21. I have a few questions/clarification request.

>is also called the Marker body or Linga sharIra.

Is Jiva same as subtle body which is also called as Linga sharira?

Instead of saying that the whole gross body is a constituent of subtle body,
why specify individual
organs only? and say there are 19 constituents? Or is it to eliminate the
inner parts of the body
such as heart, lungs etc? But then they also require "subtle
space, subtle air, subtle fire, subtle water and subtle earth etc."
