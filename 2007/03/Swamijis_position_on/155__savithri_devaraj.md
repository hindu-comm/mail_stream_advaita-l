Namaste Srikanta-ji, Bhaskar-ji,

I am not sure I can add anything more worthy than what
has been explained, but here is my try -

True knowledge removes one's own misconception that
there was silver there. It is only the false notion
that is corrected (a subjective fault).

True knowledge doesn't uncover 
the-apparent-silver-in-nacre (there is no objective
fault to be cleared).

Hence Avidya does not really exist. 
It is a mistaken notion - Adhyasa, as Shankara says. 

Hope it helps somewhat,
Regards,
Savithri
