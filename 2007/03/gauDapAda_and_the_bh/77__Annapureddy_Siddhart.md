praNAm.h All,
       One of the gauDIya sites (
http://www.veda.harekrsna.cz/encyclopedia/sb.htm) mentions that gauDapAda
quotes from the bhAgavata purANa in his uttaragItAbhAShya.

Some relevant quotes from the site:
<quote>
But Gaudapada, teacher of Govinda who was teacher of Sankara, mentions the
Bhagavatam in his Uttaragita-bhasya and in his commentary on Sankhya-karika
makes reference to other two verses.
</quote>

<quote>
Nevertheless, the studies of experts like M. T. Sahasrabuddha tend to verify
that those texts are of Gaudapada and that Sankya-karika-vritti and
Uttara-gita don't only mention verses but the latter mentions directly the
Bhagavata Purana.

Please let me know if you have any information/pointers regarding this.
Thanks.

A.Siddhartha.
