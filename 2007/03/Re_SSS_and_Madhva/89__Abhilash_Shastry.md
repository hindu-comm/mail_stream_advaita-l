Sorry to be belaboring this.

It is *Anandgiri* who is saying that gaudapada won the
*grace* of narayana. How is it comparable with the
other episode?

I have never met my param guru Sri Sacchidanandendra
Saraswati. But can I deny his grace? Now suppose I
claim that I met him in Bhopal after his death and he
told me that his disciples were teaching it wrong and
therefore he gave me the correct teaching to
propogate; is this episode comparable with getting his
grace? 

There are several perfectly legitimate reasons to
start a new tradition, as buddha had. However neither
delusion nor deception is a good one.
