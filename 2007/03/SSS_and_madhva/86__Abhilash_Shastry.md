I think if our non-sense detector is not buzzing at
such claims we need psychiatric help rather than
vedantic. 

I don't really know if we can logically prove that
pigs can't fly. May be some of them can and good for
them. And may be some people meet dead persons and
learn useful things from them. Good for them too. For
the rest of us who are not so privileged, let us work
with the assumption that things follow natural laws.
