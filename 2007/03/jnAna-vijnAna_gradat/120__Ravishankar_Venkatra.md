Sampradaya is following SanyAsa Dharma per scriptural injunctions. Of 
course, they are the adhikArIs for Vedanta study also. Bhamati or Vivarana 
traditionally have been accepted in Vedanta study, no question about that at 
all. However, direct experience has nothing to do with these two schools. 
People have experienced Brahman before these two streams came into existance 
and they continue to do so after their existance. In that way, they have 
nothing to do with direct experience of Brahman. I hope that makes it clear.

Well, we should examine the reason for that reason. If that is making us 
spiritually evolve, that would certainly make sense to do so.

Thanks,
