Namaste Sri Kartik,

Thanks for the clarification. But pls appreciate the fact that the
living Advaita Vedanta Sampradaya is far greater than the 'perimeter' of
the shringeri matha. There are many lay mathas and teachers who form a
greater part of the Sampradaya. So it is not that Shankara's teachings
will vanish if Shringeri matha one day decides to close down. 

Moreover may I urge you to appreciate that half the truth of what we say
depends on how we conduct ourselves. Sri Ravi rightly mentioned that
Vedanta is for Sadhus or rather adhikaris. We may not be Sadhus but
nothing can stop us from aspiring to cultivate the Shatka Sampat while
discussing Vedanta. If my message offended you in anyway, I am truly
sorry.  

Warmest Regards,
Kathirasan K

jnAna,superior-inferior jnAna nishTa etc. etc. PART-I

The full quote is:

"H.H. Chandrasekhara Bharati Mahaswamigal of Sringeri has himself
admitted to gradations in the establishment of Atmajnana. Therefore,
by arguing against it, SSS is aligning himself directly against the
Sringeri Math.

I must point out that this list firmly stands by the Sringeri Math
when it comes to understanding Sankara's doctrine."


The context in which I said the above was -- SSS's ideas are
contradicting Sringeri Math teachings. I think it is safe to say that
this list will side with the latter. I got this idea from the list
charter at:

1. Goals of the List
--------------------
The purpose of Advaita-L is to discuss advaita-vedAnta as taught by
SrI Sankara and the smArta sampradAya.  Through these discussions,
we hope to increase the understanding of our dharma from a
traditional
stand point, which the shankara maTha-s uphold right from the time of
their inception.

Note the terms "sampradAya" and "shankara maTha-s".

Regards,
Kartik
