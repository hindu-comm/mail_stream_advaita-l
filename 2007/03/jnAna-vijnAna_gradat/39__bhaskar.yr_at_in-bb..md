I have had different view points on the Sankara's date to post here (from
what Sri. Vidyasankar had to say) which I had researched several years ago.

It was more of a presentation of the material from different view points
for
both of us, for the reader to take whatever he/she thought was appropriate
enough. Personally, I do not think that there is much to conquer in this
area for anyone.

Hare Krishna

In my humble opinion, discrepancy in shankara's date & time is completely
off the topic & needs to be discussed in a separate thread...so that we can
focus on the subject matter of this thread...Kindly pardon me if I said
anything wrong here.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
