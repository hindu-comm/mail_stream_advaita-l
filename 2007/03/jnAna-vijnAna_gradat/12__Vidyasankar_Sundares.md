I think a lot of us are getting carried away in this discussion and 
introducing numerous extraneous dimensions to the topic at hand. I also 
thought my earlier post about the scope and purpose of this list was clear 
enough, but apparently not. I will send a separate ADMIN mail after 
discussion with the other moderators and request members to abide by the 
guidelines.

For now, suffice it to say that this list is not officially affiliated to 
any institution. We have not imposed any such criterion for list membership 
and have no intention of shutting out anybody who has a genuine interest in 
Advaita Vedanta, no matter who they are and what their antecedents are.

Regards,
Vidyasankar
