Kartik,

Unfortunately I do not know how such statements can be made unless we know 
what exactly Sringeri mutt follows. When you consider SSS is aligning 
against Sringeri mutt, the Acharyas of the mutt do not think so. The direct 
disciple of H.H. Chandrasekhara Bharati Mahaswamigal openly visited the 
place and helped SSS cause for propagating his writings. So what is the 
Sringei tradition?

Not only Sringeri mutt, but other mutts also join to help SSS. 
Sankaracharyas are sanyasis practising the tradition everyday. They can 
accept SSS in spite of the differences. They breathe Advaita, it is a full 
time work. For us in the list, this is more of a learning and not physical 
practice. Truly speaking, we should not be discussing so much Vedanta if we 
are not following Sanyasa Ashrama now. That is what H.H. Chandrasekhara 
Bharati Mahaswamigal would say. By listening to HH, we would become fit to 
talk Vedanta eventually.

May be you know something about SSS we all do not know, which is what is 
causing all these. Suppose everyone here accepts to your statement that SSS 
does not understand Advaita, would the problem be resolved? Advaita is more 
of an experience which is why it will stand the test of time. It is just not 
intellectual debates all the time. Please do not get personal, at least 
others do not see any valid reason for this.

Sorry if I have overstated anything...

Ravi
