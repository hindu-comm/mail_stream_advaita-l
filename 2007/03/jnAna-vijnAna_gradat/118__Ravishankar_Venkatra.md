Rama,

Interesting. Now I know where this conversation is leading to. I am trying 
to recollect from my memory some of the earlier posts on the same article by 
Ra. Ganapathi. It looks to me that you are extrapolating too much on what 
Ra. Ganapathi wrote. In fact, I read it the other way. Ra. Ganapathi had 
some anger on Krishnaswamy Iyer, which went away after reading the book. I 
do not know how it is damaging anyone's reputation.

Further I feel it is not correct to discuss about people who are not even 
alive. I will not be replying to this topic anymore.

God bless,
Ravi
