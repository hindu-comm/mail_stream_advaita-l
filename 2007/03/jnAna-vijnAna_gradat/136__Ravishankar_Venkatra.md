This very topic has been brought unnecessarily, absolutely without any 
connection, several times by the same members, who are trying to have a 
different agenda now. Where were you all that time? Either you were not a 
member of this list or you were a mute spectator.

Bringing this up is very relevant for me now, as I need to decide whether to 
continue my membership with the forum. It has relevance now to what is going 
on now, or as I perceive it as a general trend.

Sermons would not be required if people knew how to be sensitive to other's 
emotions.

Thanks,
Ravi
