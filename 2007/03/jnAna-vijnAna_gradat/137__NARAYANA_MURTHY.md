In the ongoing topic   JnyAna and gradations of JnyAna  I have my doubt from this verse #2 of VC wherein ACArya Sankara says

  AtmAnAtmaviveCanam svanubhavo brahmAtmanA samsthiti:

  with specific reference to the topic, I have following doubts on the above verse viz.,


   Why prefixes are added before the anubhUti and its sustainment
  Su  anubhavaha
  Samsthithihi
  Since I do not not even have parichayam of  vyAkaraNam, I am not sure whether the padAnvayam  above is correct or not.  But considering the way I have observed the words above, it prima facie appears that Acharya shankara contemplates gradations in JnyAna by adding a prefix Su to the anubhavam and sustainment or for contemplated further derailment by adding a prefix samyak  to the sthithi?

  PS:  This is from my elementary knowledge; if it is defective I would be more than willing to correct the same.

  Regards
  N.Murthy
