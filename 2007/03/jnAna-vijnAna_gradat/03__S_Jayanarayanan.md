The full quote is:

"H.H. Chandrasekhara Bharati Mahaswamigal of Sringeri has himself
admitted to gradations in the establishment of Atmajnana. Therefore,
by arguing against it, SSS is aligning himself directly against the
Sringeri Math.

I must point out that this list firmly stands by the Sringeri Math
when it comes to understanding Sankara's doctrine."


The context in which I said the above was -- SSS's ideas are

1. Goals of the List
--------------------
The purpose of Advaita-L is to discuss advaita-vedAnta as taught by
SrI Sankara and the smArta sampradAya.  Through these discussions,
we hope to increase the understanding of our dharma from a
traditional
stand point, which the shankara maTha-s uphold right from the time of
their inception.

Note the terms "sampradAya" and "shankara maTha-s".

Regards,
Kartik
