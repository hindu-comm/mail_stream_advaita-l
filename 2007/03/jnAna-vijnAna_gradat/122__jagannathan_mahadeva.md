Dear Kartik,

I suppose you are trying to categorize your analysis of RG's article
into your own classification of what it may have meant. Are you saying
that the whole article was only about leadership to spread dharma?
Were there not other details on what RG felt about the two sages and
their outlook? (The note on Sri JBS is only apparent after the
sringeri matha followers, in this list, made efforts to point to it
and it still is not the main focus of the article!)

<quote>
For the fourth issue of Arya Dharmam of the year Dundhubi (1922), Sri
M.N. Subrahmanai Sastri had sent an article in which he had lauded the
active spirit of Kanchi Periyaval in going to every nook and corner of
the land and giving new life to the Vedic traditions thereby. He had
also written that others in the same position had not cared to exert
themselves similarly. It was evident that he meant the Sringeri
Acharya. The Editor asked Periyaval whether the portions relating to
his good work done by him alone be retained, deleting the aside on the
other Acharya.
<unquote>

Even if the editor were claimed to be ignorant it does not affect the
main theme of RG's article. I guess that the "offending" parts are
obvious only to the people who put themselves deliberately in a
particular camp and view the article through the eyes of history (Sri
JBS's reference).

The editor in question, may really not have come across the fact that
HH did not believe that his duty was to lead a propaganda. What do you
expect periyavAl to instruct the editor? To belabor the point that HH
did not believe that it was not his duty to "lead" an effort? or to
simply state that HH had a different and probably greater
predisposition as the head of an orthodox school! Also the critical
claim was not periyavAL's but that of the writer/editor who probably
feels the same as the questioner in the quote you had provided about
HH (portion reproduced below).
HH's views are not necessarily generic to sringeri given that the past
heads have been involved in different levels of activism such as
vidyAranya swaminah whose political acumen and involvement as a
kingmaker is well known. Besides, the quote on HH you had provided,
and reproduced below, never says that HH did "not support" such
activity to encourage people to uphold dharma.

There are several heads of institutions today, including those that
claim traditional scholarship of advaita vedanta, that are leading
large movements to create awareness of hindu dharma. What would you
tell of them? Would you tell that they are wrong in their actions
because they disagree with HH's own personal belief?

<quote>
G: The almighty God and the Rishis (Sages) are not visible now, but
you in whom the people repose confidence are present before them in
flesh and blood; and they naturally will pay more attention to your
words than to the religious dictates embodies in books.

HH: Be it as you like. Wherever you go, tell the people, "The Vedas,
the divine commands of the Lord, have enjoined on you these duties.
The Smritis of the Sages also enjoin the same duties. Perform them
properly and reap their benefit. The Acharya also wants you to do the
same." Let not the people continue in adharma for want of a word from
me in support of the authority of the Vedas and the Smritis. You may
tell them that the Vedas and the Smritis have my emphatic support and
that I also enjoin on them the duty to obey them, as you seem to
think my injunction specially valuable.
<unquote>

It will be best if we shed the baggage of history when interacting on
this list, which is and should be for advaita vedanta. All of us
appreciate the role of different institutions and the heads and there
ends the matter. In any case I am not sure if you ever got to post
brahmagyana and jivanmukti-#6. I was away for several days in the past
and might have missed it.


Jagan.
