Namaste Sri Ravi,

Txs for the clarification. Let us also not forget that Sringeri Matha is
itself part of Sampradaya. It didn't create it. The Sampradaya , on the
other hand, stands by its own merit purely by passing down the Advaita
siddhanta through a living tradition of shrotriya brahmanishtas who may
not prefer to preside at a peetham. One is a subset of the other. 

So it would be better if we stuck to Sampradaya first and then mathas.
This way we can avoid the pitfall of subscribing to a dogma blindly,
instead of a well founded siddhanta. 

Warmest Regards,
Kathirasan K

namaste Kathirasan:

 Yes, what Kartik wrote is true and this has been my
belief/understanding always.

I do not remember whether we explicitly stated this anywhere. If not
before, we should do it at least now.   I would like to know what
Jaldhar and Vidya think on this matter.  This is what we state in the
welcome letter and I think this implies the above.

"The purpose of Advaita-L is to discuss advaita-vedAnta as taught by
SrI Sankara and the smArta sampradAya.  Through these discussions,
we hope to increase the understanding of our dharma from a traditional
stand point, which the shankara maTha-s uphold right from the time of
their inception."

When there is a dispute in understanding the doctrine of
advaita-vedAnta, we have  no choice but to go back to the sampradAya
and Sringeri maTha is the obvious and the best choice.   But we should
allow room to raise some of these disputes so that we can understand
the objections and thereby the siddhAnta better.

The only place I think, as a policy, we should not  take a specific
side is regarding the date of Sankara. But this is not a doctrinal
issue.

For the record, I think Kartik's response to Bhaskar was needlessly
rude in this thread and such a tone is not acceptable.

Ravi
