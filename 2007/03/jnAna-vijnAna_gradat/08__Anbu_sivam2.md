I am 100% with Ravishankarji.  People tend to forget that all arguments
starts with the ego.    They have to keep this in mind when attacking Kanchi
Mutt or any other mutt.  My simple question to people who dispute
ParamacharayaL is: "What do you want to achieve in this?"

With Narayanasmrithi,
Anbu
