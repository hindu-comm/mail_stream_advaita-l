This list is for Advaita Vedanta as taught by Shri Shankara.  It is not 
formally affiliated with any math or particular guru.  Purely on a 
historical basis if nothing else Shringeri has a claim to the most 
authentic interpretation of Advaita Vedanta as taught by Shri Shankara. 
However that is not to say it is the only possible interpretation
  and if there are other perspectives on what "Advaita Vedanta as taught by 
Shri Shankara" means then they are also welcome here though not everyone 
might agree with them.
