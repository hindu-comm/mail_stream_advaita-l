"Time and again sanyAsis of the tradition have been belittled to
promote a particular point of view."

I agree 200%. Sri J~naanaananda Bharatii, author of 100+ very lucid
books on advaita, priya-shiShya of Candrashekhara Bharati and
Mahasannidhanam, has been belittled by that article pretty badly.

Oops, my bad, that's not what you were talking about were you? What
you are saying is no one should contradict anything which comes from
the Kanchi Mutt, and we'll all live happily thereafter. A small price
to pay - let's belittle JBS. That's not too bad a price, right?

the link you sent.
