I certainly thought of the two being inter-related in some way. To subscribe 
to the list we need to go through advaita-vedanta website, at least that is 
what I did.

I can agree that you have painstakingly worked on correlating conflicting 
material to a conclusion. To my consternation however, I find that 
researchers like W.R. Antarkar and others, after exhaustive work on the same 
material, come up with different conclusions. In that light, I have noted 
the conclusions to be personal opinions. While that may be the case with the 
hagiographies, other material evidences could be studied in a non-partisan 
faction, to bring more credibility to the correlations.

Since last two days, I have been thinking about my posts and the rejoinders. 
I was wondering whether I had a gross misunderstanding of the situation 
leading me to connect multiple events. I was a bit naïve too, I guess, in 
linking Ra. Ganapathis article in my post, without thinking too much of how 
the same link was used earlier to bring in controversies. No more reasoning 
to be applied at this stageI rest my case here.

I have been a list member for several years (more than 5 if I remember), and 
I must admit that my knowledge did grow in multiple areas associated with 
Advaita Vedanta. Currently, I have decided to take some time off from this 
forum. I will be missing Sri.Anand Hudlis posts on Vivarana and Advaita 
Summation by Sri. Ramakrishna.

Thanks to all of you (Jaldhar Vyas, Ravi Mayavaram, Vidyasankar Sundaresan 
and Vaidya Sundaram?) for having me as a member for this long period.

Seeking the grace of BhagavAn KArtikeyA residing on top of Palani hill and 
BhagavAn DattAtreyA, I end this note wishing you all peace and happiness.

God bless,
Ravishankar Venkatraman
