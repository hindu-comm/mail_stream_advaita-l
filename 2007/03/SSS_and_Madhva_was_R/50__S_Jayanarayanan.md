Sorry. I sent out my previous email before I received Jaldhar's email
above.

I agree that my reply to Bhaskar yesterday was a bit personal, and
will remedy that in my future emails.

Resoning based on the scriptures ought to be in line with the
Sampradaya. If someone uses "logic" to argue against the doctrine of
the Bhamati, Panchapadika, Jivanmuktiviveka, Vivekachudamani -- how
exactly can that person be called a Sampradayavit?

It is interesting that Madhva goes only one step further -- he also
argues against Sankara.

Is there really that much difference between the two -- insofar as
they take a stance against the Sampradaya?
