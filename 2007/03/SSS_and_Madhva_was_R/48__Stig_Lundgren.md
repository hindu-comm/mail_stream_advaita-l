Please don´t ascribe to me the view that "every other view is wrong" or that
"only-what-i-say-is correct". I do not personally subscribe to this outlook,
regardless if any other followers of SSS happen to do that or not. It is my
honest conviction that moksha is possible not only for followers of SSS, but
also for followers of Bhamati, Vivarana and other advaitic interpretations
within the sampradaya. If moksha was possible only from the very teachings
of Gaudapada, Shankara, Sureshvara and SSS, then there wouldn´t have been
any jivanmuktas between the years (approximately) 1000 and ~1950, and this
is obviously not the case.

Warmest regards
Stig Lundgren
