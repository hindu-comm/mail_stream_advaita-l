let me just rephrase what has been said earlier regarding this issue.
i'm sure shrI jayanArAyaNan (or shrI rAmakRShNan, for that matter)
doesn't really intend to hurt followers of SSS. after all, the
literacy levels of sha~Nkara's and sureshvara's works are in general
very high among followers of SSS and this is indeed worthy of the
highest appreciation. but what spoils the show is that followers of
SSS talk very nicely about being open and all that while at the same
time maintaining stubbornly that 'only' SSS's view is the 'shudda
sha~Nkara prakriyA' (whatever that means) and that every other view is
wrong. what shrI jayanArAyaNan is probably trying to do is to
desperately 'wake up' followers of SSS from their typical and stubborn
'only-what-i-say-is-correct' attitude and engage them in a honest and
open debate. even otherwise, i guess it's quite normal to get
frustrated when what one repeatedly says with the necessary evidence
is repeatedly ignored as being incorrect without providing a proper
rebuttal. so far, none of shrI jayanArAyaNan's critique of SSS's
philosophical views have been answered satisfactorily by any of the
followers of SSS. i hope to see a proper defence of SSS's views soon.
