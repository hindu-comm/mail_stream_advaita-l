That is precisely the reason SSS *himself* gives to discard Padmapadas
work - that it does not belong to the *shankara sampradaya*.
*shuddha-shaankara* is a common term in many of their publications.

I have my opinions on this, and I haven't seen anyone give any proper
reasons to change it. In any case, I'll take your advice, and there
will be no more posts from me regarding the sampradaayic validity or
otherwise of SSS's doctrines.
