Dear Rama,

You wrote:
"This is precisely the reason that I took care to point out that Kartik
was talking about the common obsession with *terminology*, not about
philosophy. I knew someone or the other would come up with the remark
above. In any case, it should have also been clear from the rest of
Kartiks message."


My reply:
I was just trying to make a funny remark. I tried to be somewhat cheerful in
contrast to all the not-so-respectful remarks on SSS, made by Kartik.

Warmest regards
Stig Lundgren
