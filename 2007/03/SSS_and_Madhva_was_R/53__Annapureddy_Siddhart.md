Could you tell us what your position vis-a-vis bhAmatI and vivaraNa is? Are
you saying that while the two works use different terminology, the
philosophy they teach is exactly the same?

What do you mean second-guessing? On a particular issue, if a saMpradAyavit
expresses an opinion, you might as well write it down, and a person who
reads it would get the same (theoretical) understanding. It might be
difficult/impossible to convey an experience through language, but I am not
sure if any of the vEdAntins claimed that language was an inadequate means
for explication of the epistemology/ontology. Otherwise, there would not be
much point to writing so many works on vEdAnta by all these
brahmavits/sampradAyavits.

Because any bhAShya can give you a theoretical understanding at best, while
training with a brahmavit/sampradAyavit helps you gain the experience for
yourself.

"Critical scholarship" is needed to first establish faith in a particular
system (esp. for the so-called "second grade students" who comprise the
majority of the seekers), to show that the system is not inconsistent, has a
well-defined problem and a solution (in vEdAnta, the problem of bandhana and
the solution of mOkSha) etc. And I am not sure if anyone claimed "critical
scholarship" will effect a change in consciousness (though that is well
possible); what is claimed is an articulate presentation of the system.

The bhaaShyas are only a crutch for *second-grade

One should first know who to choose as a guru before one can avail his "mere
presence". How is one to know whether one is supposed to approach the
shrungEri guru or the uDupi guru?

In my opinion this bhAshya studies disease is

Reading of the Sanskrit texts is useful for the reasons above. And from the
above, you are also claiming that the philosophy has not changed from the
times of shaN^kara. This makes me presume that you feel there are no
differences whatsoever between the bhAmatI and the vivaraNa in terms of
philosophy. If that is so, I could focus on some differences (either
perceived or real) between the two subschools, and maybe you can tell me why
they are not differences at all.
