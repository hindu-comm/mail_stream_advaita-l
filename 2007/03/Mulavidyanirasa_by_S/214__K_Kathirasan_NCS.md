Namaste list members,

I believe many in this list could not have had the opportunity to read
the Mulavidyanirasa by Swami Satchitanandendra Saraswati (SSS). For
those who may be interested to study the text in English would be
greatly pleased to know that AJ Alston has translated this work and
AFAIK it is only sold at Shanti Sadan (UK). You can buy the book online
at this location: www.shantisadan.org . The book is titled as the 'Heart
of Shri Shankara'. 

Warmest Regards,
Kathirasan K
