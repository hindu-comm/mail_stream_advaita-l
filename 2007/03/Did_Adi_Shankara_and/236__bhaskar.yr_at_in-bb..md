I wanted to ask knowledgeable advaitin members if this
is true - did Adi Shankara and his followers resort to
such tactics?

>  The only source for all these meaningless/baseless  incidents is
shankara's biography....As of date around 22 different versions of
biographies on shankara available in the market in various languages,
deviating each other right from shankara's birth time to his disappearance
from the earth!!  Most of these biographers belong to some saMpradAya (such
as kAnchi kAmakOti saMpradAya, shrungEri saMpradAya etc.) & biased enough
to uphold the supremacy of their respective saMpradAya....So,  you can be
rest assured that incidents such as quoted by you can only be a concocted
allegories & it has nothing to do with *real life incidents of shankara*
which is still a puzzle to all historians...

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
