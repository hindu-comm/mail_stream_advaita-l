praNAms Sri Srikanta prabhuji
Hare Krishna

that "balya" stands for what we call as
childlike(mugdha),just as a child is with respect to shame and all that,
and mouna indicates an all knowing jnana state.Shankara states that a
Jnani's status is like that of a child.

N.Srikanta.

>  I am interested in vyAkhyAnakAra's vyAkhyAna on this maNtra...I heard
that sUtrabhAshya vyAkhyAna *ratnaprabha* & anandagiri tIka hold the view
that these pAnditya, bAlya & mouna have been interpreted as shravaNa,
manana & nidhidhyAsana...Sri Sivasenani Nori prabhuji, on my request, has
already provided Anandagiri's tIka in original text through private mail
where it is said like above...I am waiting for ratnaprabha's comments..

>  BTW, shankara's bhAshya with regard to bAlya & mouna slightly differs in
sUtra bhAshya & bruhadAraNyaka bhAshya.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
