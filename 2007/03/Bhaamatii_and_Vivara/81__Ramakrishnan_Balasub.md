A brief comment on just this, since I am busy now. A more detailed
post may follow later. My opinion is of no use. Let's just take the
advaitic sampradaayavits such as Citsukha and Madhusuudana Sarasavati.
They have clearly shown that the philosophy they teach is EXACTLY the
same, the difference is due to some other things which are tangential.
Of course the "tangential" points are sometimes worthy of
argumentation, as is clear from the expositions of the bhAmatI and
vivaraNa themselves. No one is denying that.
