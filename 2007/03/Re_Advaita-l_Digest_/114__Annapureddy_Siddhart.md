I am aware of these earlier advaitins, but this is what the dvaitins would
say -- that there is no continuity from vyAsa to the earliest historical
person X (who happens to be bhagavAn upavarSha; btw upavarSha was respected
both by mImAmsakas and vEdAntins, and Hajime Nakamura in his work on early
vEdAnta notes that upavarSha was likely not an advaitin accepting the
unreality of the world.) I am not using the upaniShadic and purANic figures
because both the traditions could quote amply from those sources. (Also,
there seems to be a chain of teachers prior to Ananda tIrtha, although it's
not clear if they were vEdAntins.)

In addition let us also remember that there are several works that are

Please note that for vEdAnta, dharmashAstras, itihAsas and purANas are
probably the only sources commonly accepted by both the traditions (Also, in
my limited exposure to dvaita vEdAnta, I haven't seen much emphasis even on
the dharmashAstras.)

praNAm.h shrI Abhilash,

No problem. I just wanted to find the traditional position on such issues.

What I was saying was this: Anandagiri is an accepted sampradAyavit. And he
makes a claim. The claim is either true or not. You are saying that such
claims cannot be true (and I am not sure if that is the traditional
position). If the claim is not true, Anandagiri is indulging in false
speech. This brings up the same possibilities -- either Anandagiri is
deluded, or malicious (if we eliminate the case that what he says is true).
This then raises the question of how good deluded or malicious people can be
in guiding others to mOkSha?

Other possibilities I could think of is that Anandagiri just used
metaphorical language or he wanted to promote bhakti amongst followers of
gauDapAda etc. But I wanted to know what the position of the tradition is on
such issues?  (Btw, the possibility of metaphor could be extended to Ananda
tIrtha too.)

praNAm.h shrI Ravishankar,
       I agree totally with your observations on this issue.

A.Siddhartha.
