Dear Rama,

Many thanks for your reply and your suggestion of the book by Sri D.S.
Subbaramayya. Was this book written in Sanskrit or English?

Warmest regards
Stig Lundgren





I suggest the 2 volume set by D.S.Subbaramayya on the Dakshinamurti
Stotram, published by the Sringeri Mutt. The books are very
comprehensive and was written at the command of Sri Mahasannidhanam
himself. Sri Mahasannidhanam praises his disciple (the author Sri
Subbaramayya) as both a vidvaan and also one who has direct experience
of the reality. It presents all view points, bhAmatI, vivaraNa, etc.,
and show how they are all applicable. Interestingly the view of SSS is
notable by its *complete* absence. The books were published towards
the end of Sri Mahasannidhanam tenure (1998-1990 time period).
