Stig,

The books are in English, with many extracts in devanaagarii +
translations in English. The first volume is about 750 pages and
covers shlokas 1, 2, 3 and 8. It also has a couple of chapters on the
background and how everything "fits in". The second volume is somewhat
smaller, although it contains the rest 6 shlokas.

I bought the first volume in the Sringeri bookstall back in 1996.
Unfortunately they did not have the 2nd volume even then. I tried
various bookstores in Madras, with no luck. I got the 2nd volume from
a university library about 5 years back, but I do not have a copy of
it.

It's unlikely to be available for purchase anywhere. You probably have
to go to some good library.

In this regard, I also highly recommend the translation of Sri
Krishnamurti Sastrigals book on IShTasiddhi-VivaraNa, by our own list
member Sri S.N.Sastri, which my wife got for me from Madras recently.
It's very, very good.

Rama
