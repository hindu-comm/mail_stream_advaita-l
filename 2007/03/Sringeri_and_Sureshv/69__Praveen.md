Fortunately, I'd managed to trouble the bookstall people at Shankara
maTh, Bangalore, less than a year back to fetch one volume from a old/
discarded documents loft, while the other was on the shelf! The
hardbound cover and some pages were badly damaged, but seemed
definitely readable :) Unfortunately, its currently in a carton
awaiting its shift between houses (and I'm assuming the author to be
same)!

One could check with them if they have any more copies found anew.

@Jaldhar: Hoping my memory is serving well, did you carry back a copy
of this book while at Bangalore from Shankara maTh? I think then too
they'd only one volume.

Rgds,
