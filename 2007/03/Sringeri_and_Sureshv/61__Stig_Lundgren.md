It is of course correct that Sureshvara did not comment upon Shankara´s
BSBh. But it is sometimes claimed that Sureshvara´s views on the locus of
avidyA paved the way for what later became the Vivarana standpoint, and that
Sureshvara´s standpoint where closer to the later Vivarana than the (also
later) Bhamati. Hence my question (regardless of whether this claim is true
or not).

On the other hand, there´s a tradition saying that Mandana Mishra and
Sureshvara where in fact the very same person.

Warmest regards
Stig Lundgren
