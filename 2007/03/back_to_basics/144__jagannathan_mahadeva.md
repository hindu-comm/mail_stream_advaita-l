Namaskaram Sri nArayaNa mUrthy,

I understand. I did not brush away any inaccuracies, but rather took
note of it as it was pointed out. But I wish to let you know that I
have no clue whether RG nurtured a grudge or otherwise. Also I have no
bias at all with Sh. JBS and will eagerly wait for the next chance to
read his books -  in fact I have already read excerpts, with great
relish, from kArtik's postings and some online resources.

I really do not possess a lot of scholarship but I have listened to
the words of those that are and also saints such as appAji from
doddEri in karnataka. Thus I try to correlate my experiences and notes
with the observations made here.

Sincerely,
Jagan.

But being factually wrong ( I deliberately avoid using a harsh expression here) and belittling Sh.JBS takes the sheen out of the article.  Don't you think the purpose of the article could have been better served without this factually wrong note which only serves the opposite?

Sh.Rama wrote that Sh.JBS penned about 100+ books.  I have gone through about 10+.  Irrespective of what one says due to one's affiliations, the works of Sh.JBS whether on Vedanta or on anyother topic would speak for themselves for generations to come.
