The moderators of this list feel a need to specify a few guidelines for 
future posts on the ongoing discussions in the list. This is in recognition 
of the facts that

a. the topic of Swami Saccidanandendra Sarasvati's writings and whether he 
is right or wrong is not going to vanish,

b. we would like list members to discuss the various issues raised by his 
writings in a mature manner,

c. and there is little to be gained by painting oneself into a hard corner. 
There are lots of issues about which one need not be inflexible.

Keeping the above in mind,

1. Only specific philosophical positions held by various authors should be 
discussed and debated.

2. It is unnecessary to discuss whether someone was part of the sampradAya 
or not. Everyone has had their say, each person is sticking to their 
position and there is no use in further belaboring the point.

3. Please try not to get personal when responding to other's posts. Let us 
try to keep the tone of the discussion at a high level.

4. Please do not write any post in high emotion. A friendly suggestion about 
this - if you feel irked by somebody's post and have an urge to immediately 
write a response, do write it up by all means, but save it as a draft and do 
not send it to the list immediately. A few hours or a day later, revisit
what you wrote and reevaluate whether you absolutely need to send it into 
the public domain.

Best wishes,
