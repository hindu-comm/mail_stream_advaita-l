Hari Om,

http://www.jagadgurus.org/

I see some interesting books on Advaita vedanta in 'Books & Magazines' 
section of the above web-site. At the end of the section, it was mentioned 
that "To obtain copies please send e-mail to acharyal at vedas.com".   I have 
been sending emails for last six months but no one is responding.

Would like to know whether any member has any news about this?

Thank you

Regards

-- Durga
