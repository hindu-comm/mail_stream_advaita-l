It occurs to me that there isn't much difference between SSS and the
dvaitins.


SSS: "Back to Sankara-Suresvara! Everyone after Sankara-Suresvara is
wrong!"

Dvaitins: "Back to Badarayana-Vyasa! Everyone after Badarayana-Vyasa
is wrong!"


The similarity goes deeper. Madhva as well as SSS had advaitin Gurus
who were part of the Sampradaya, yet both abandoned the doctrine
taught by their Gurus and chose to travel their own high road. SSS
was an a-Sampradayavit, as testified by his own Guru.


SSS nitpicks on the most insignificant details in post-Sankaran
authors, to the extent of pointing out extremely minor differences in
terminology, just as Dvaitins nitpick on the most insignificant
details of scriptural support establishing Advaita.


SSS: "Where does Sankara speak of 'Avidya-Sakti' -- this is new
terminology, and must be outside the realm of Vedanta since Sankara
hasn't referred to it."

Dvaitins: "Where does Badarayana speak of 'Adhyasa' -- this is new
terminology, and must be outside the realm of Vedanta since
Badarayana hasn't referred to it."


The similarities are striking!

Kartik

"If Sri BAdarAyaNa himself had supported the adhyAsa theory,  
then Sri Madhwa would have followed suite, and  I could have
helped you with your request.   But that is not the case.  In fact,
I would like to know myself  where adhyAsa-theory is found in
prasthAna-traya !!"   -- A Dvaitin
