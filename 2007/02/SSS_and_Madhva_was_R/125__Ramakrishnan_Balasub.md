This is precisely the reason that I took care to point out that Kartik
was talking about the common obsession with *terminology*, not about
philosophy. I knew someone or the other would come up with the remark
above. In any case, it should have also been clear from the rest of
Kartiks message.

BTW, in case anyone did not connect up the dots, it seems to me that
Kartik is saying that you can take the "XYZ did not use that
terminology or explanation" - so lets go back to XYZ, and claim all
authors after him were wrong.
