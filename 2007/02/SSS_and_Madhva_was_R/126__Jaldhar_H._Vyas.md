Nevertheless this line of criticism creates more heat than light.  Let's 
keep the conversation on a higher level shall we?  Also Kartiks last reply 
to Bhaskar got a little personal and that is not the kind of atmosphere 
we want on advaita-l.

My 2 cents.  I don't think I buy all of Swami Sacchidanandendras' critique 
but it does not strike me as being outside the realm of Advaita tradition 
and the efforts to portray him as outside the sampradaya seem a bit 
strained.  But if people are using that critique to avoid the later 
Vedantins that's a grave mistake.  Advaita Vedanta developed the way it 
did for good reasons.
