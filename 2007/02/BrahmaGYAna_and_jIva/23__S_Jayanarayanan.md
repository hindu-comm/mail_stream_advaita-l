If there is any doubt on GYAna, it wouldn't be AtmaGYAna.

VidyAraNya likens the state of the GYAnimAtra to that of a person who
knows fully well that the rope is a rope, but still has residual
"fears" from the prior experience of seeing the snake.

It is unlikely that a "verification" of AtmaGYAna can be done by
taking recourse to scriptural statements, because the truthhood of
the scriptural statements are lower in status (aparAvidyA) to that of
AtmaGYAna (parAvidyA).

I think you're right. There are some who "adjust" themselves to GYAna
quickly and become sthitapraGYas. There are those who find it
difficult, and have to make effort to steady themselves to abide in
GYAna.
