Namaste ji & the rest,

Actually my statement was from the Vyavahara standpoint. It would still
make sense. 2 points from 100 is still not full marks. So it doesn't
really matter who says what but rather what is being said. I can't
believe that the discussion has gone to an extent of quoting great
personalities to establish the nature of ignorance. Isn't our own
experience enough? Will anyone ever say that I am a jnani with unsteady
wisdom? Both the Samsari and the Jijnasu (be it a man of unsteady
wisdom) are but ajnanis. 

Warmest Regards,
Kathirasan K

Namaskaram Sri Kathirasan

I would think that this is still true, because, although no teaching
is possible from the absolute standpoint, in the paramArtika there is
no room for vyavahAra. Whether even one calls it GYAna, aGYAna or
avidya also is of no consequence.

It is only when we enter the realm of teaching tradition that we have
to endure the rigor of the tradition because we simply have no choice.
I think this is somewhat a helpless situation when we have conflicting
traditions of teaching.

Jagan.
