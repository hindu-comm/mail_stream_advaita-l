Namaste Vinayakaji,

Swami Dayanandaji attributes his learning of traditional Vedanta to
primarily Swami Pranavananda and Swami Tarananda Giri. 


Warmest Regards,
Kathirasan K

Dear Kathirasan-ji,

Not only with regard to vasana kshaya but in many issues like samadhi,
realization of the self etc. there seems to be a striking similarity
between the views of Swami Dayananda and SSS.

Yours in Sri Ramakrishna,

Br. Vinayaka

Namaste

It seems that SSS was not alone in his contention that Vasana Kshaya is
alien to Shankara's teachings. Swami Dayananda of Arsha Vidya Gurukulam,
who happens to be a teacher not associated with SSS, also maintains the
same view. One may find his views in his Biography 'Swami Dayananda: A
Traditional Teacher of Brahmavidya'.  

Or take a look at this page:
http://www.shiningworld.com/Books%20Pages/HTML%20Books/What%20is%20Adwai
ta%20Vedanta.htm where the author presents the gist of Swami Dayananda's
views on Vasana Kshaya. 

So it may not be right to say that SSS alone had such a view.  

Warmest Regards,
Kathirasan K

In case someone is wondering whether it is only Bhaskar who has
misunderstood SSS, here's a quote from "The Method of the Vedanta",
where SSS criticizes the Bhamati for propounding the theory that
latent impressions need to be effaced after Self-knowledge (page
624-625):

"All that Sri Sankara's commentary in fact says here is that
Ignorance is the superimposition of a false appearance due to lack of
discrimination, whereas knowledge is determination of the true nature
of the real through discrimination. It is clear that it does not say
that, when the truth has been ascertained through a discriminating
cognition, the latter will have to be repeatedly re-affirmed. There
is not a shadow of doubt, however, that the author of the Bhamati,
through his prejudice in favour of Mandana, takes Mandana's doctrines
of the persistence of an impression of Ignorance (Brahma Siddhi, p.
35) and the need for repeated re-affirmation of knowledge and passes
them off as explanations of Sri Sankara's commentary. It is declared
repeatedly in the Bhamati that (even in the case of the enlightened
person) the impression (Samskara) of Ignorance, understood as
synonymous with Vasana, had to be suppressed by direct intuition
obtained through repeated re-affirmation of knowledge of the truth
(Bhamati, English translation p.61,108,127). This doctrine is
expressly refuted by Sri Sankara in his Commentary on the
Brihadaranyaka Upanishad 1.4.7 (translation Madhavananda, p. 131)."

Obviously, SSS denies the validity of (at least parts of) the Bhamati
because the text propounds the doctrine that Vasanas may persist
after the Self is known -- precisely what the Jivanmuktiviveka (as
also the Brihadaranyaka 3.5.1) teaches.

There is absolutely no doubt that SSS did not comprehend the
difference between steady and unsteady Atmagyana.

Regards,
Kartik
