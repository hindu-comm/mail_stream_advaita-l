Dear Kartik,

I´m afraid my only intention here was to point out that even though Swami
Satchidanandendra Saraswati did refute the opinion that Vivekachudamani is a
work by Shankaras pen, and even though he didn´t approve of all standpoints
presented in Jivanmuktiviveka, he nevertheless considered those two works to
be most important works within the Advaita Vedanta tradition. He did not
consider as useless all works written after Sureshvara, as some people seems
to believe.

Warmest regards
Stig Lundgren
