SSS has done two things:

1) Present Sankara's teachings as-is, sans "extraneous influences".
2) Condemn post-Sankaran authors as being unfaithful to Sankara.

The first contribution is laudable, but the second is of poor taste.
SSS was not content merely presenting Sankara's commentaries to the
beginner, but he was keen on using his ideas to censure the later
advaitins such as the Panchapadikacharya.

Thus it is not uncommon to find students of SSS who use such
"superior logic" to the level of not accepting even scriptural quotes
that go against SSS's works. Whereas a minor difference (which is not
actually a difference at all) between Sankara and the
Panchapadikacharya renders the whole of the Panchapadika redundant.

For example, when I first pointed out that Vidyaranya has
distinguished Self-knowledge from Liberation, Bhaskar said:

"From my understanding, it is like saying, since our advaita AchArya
Sri VidyAraNya saying that there is difference between these two, we
have to accept it....I hope that would not be the case &  Sri Karthik
prabhuji will address these issues in detail in his subsequent posts
by providing logical answers with proper supportings from shruti-s"

After I provided the relevant shruti reference -- the Brihadaranyaka
Upanishad 3.5.1 that speaks of the GYAnI as giving up desires --
Bhaskar goes into denial, saying:

"...under these circumstances, where is the question of *leaving
desires* AFTER atma jnAna??"

In other words, disbelief continues even if the Brihadaranyaka
Upanishad says so! IMHO, it seems like SSS is idolized to the extent
of being greater than Vidyaranya, greater than Ramana Maharhi,
greater than H.H. of Sringeri, and GREATER EVEN THAN THE
BRIHADARANYAKA UPANISHAD!

Again, to quote Bhaskar:

"...calibrating jnAni-s like jnAni mAtra & jIvan mukta etc. etc. and
entrusting him certain disciplining acts (vidhi-s) etc. etc. are due
to lack of grasping the truth behind the jnAni-hood as enshrined in
shruti-s"

In other words, Bhaskar is implying that Vidyaranya did not grasp the
truth behind Self-realization as taught by the scriptures!

It is one thing praise one's own Guru, it is an entirely different
thing to condemn another's!

So what do SSS followers think when Ramana Maharshi says (Talks
#289):

"Some extraordinary persons get drdha jnana (unshaken knowledge)
even on hearing the Truth only once (sakrchhravana matrena).
Because they are krthopasakah (advanced seekers), whereas the
akrthopasakah (raw seekers) take longer to gain drdha jnana
(unshaken knowledge)."

Ramana Maharshi evidently accepts Vidyaranya's classification of
different grades among students!

There are other ways of pointing this out. SSS could easily have
said, "The Panchapadika is an advanced work that will not be clear to
the beginner student, so only the greatest scholars should study it."

Why the needless insinuation about the Panchapadikacharya being a
blind person?
