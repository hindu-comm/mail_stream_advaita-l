I'll explain the problems with the quotes provided in a little more
detail in this posting. Unless there are **unambiguous** quotes from
SSS showing that he comprehended the distinction between steady and
unsteady AtmaGYAna in his writings, there's no point in further
discussion in this thread.

Since you've equated your "BrahmaniShTha" with "BrahmaGYAnI" (who can
be either a GYAnimAtra or a sthitapraGYa), your sentence reads as:

"But from an empirical viewpoint, they (i.e. BrahmaGYAnIs) still need
to counteract the pUrva vAsanAs, and some amount of discipline is
required for that (which is exactly what svAmI vidyAraNya's point is
in JMV)"

The above statement is ambiguous/incorrect for two reasons:

1) Note that the above sentence is NOT true for BrahmaGYAnIs in
general, because it is not true for at least one kind of BrahmaGYAnI
-- the sthitapraGYa.

2) Besides, the part about "from an empirical viewpoint" seems like a
third-person's view of the BrahmaGYAnI, not the BrahmaGYAnI's own
viewpoint.

It is very easy to interpret the statement as referring to the state
of the sthitapraGYa.

The reason: the mention of "when knowledge is acquired" implies that
the person considered is a BrahmaGYAnI. Once the knowledge has been
acquired and the person is a BrahmaGYAnI, the "auxiliaries" are
"absence of pride" etc. which are the same as (or at the very least,
similar to) the qualifications that are known as
sAdhana-chatushhTaya.

There is no problem in saying that the auxiliaries --
sAdhana-chatushhTaya -- remain in the state of the sthitapraGYa as
natural characteristics. I've already quoted this in the discussion
of the sthitapraGYa in the JMV:

"  'All that led to the realization are to be brought about by 
  effort; they are the means. To the sthitapraGYa, they remain
  as natural characteristics."


Therefore, what SSS could be saying is that the pre-requisites for
AtmaGYAna don't really "come to end" after steady Self-realization --
rather, they find their consummation in the Self.

The point I'm making is:

The quote provided is ambiguous. It DOES NOT NECESSARILY IMPLY the
state of the GYAnimAtra, for it can ALSO easily be interpreted to be
in line with the state of the sthitapraGYa. This quote therefore does
not prove that SSS comprehended the difference between steady and
unsteady AtmaGYAna.

I don't want to get into this topic now, but suffice it to say that
since Sankara himself uses the term "sthitapraGYa", it only refers to
this person.

Again, the reference provided is ambiguous.

I'm saying that both the GYAnimAtra as well as the sthitapraGYa have
saMyak-aparoksha-BrahmaGYAna. Re-read your objection above to
understand that by your own contention, the quote CAN be interpreted
to be the sthitapraGYa.

This quote is also ambiguous, because it can be interpreted to be the
state of the sthitapraGYa.

Again, I must emphasize that I'm looking for an UNAMBIGUOUS QUOTE
from SSS to the effect that he comprehended the difference between a
GYAnimAtra and a sthitapraGYa, not a quote that can be interpreted
otherwise.

For example, the person whose state is quoted above could easily be
interpreted in two ways:

1) The sthitapraGYa. "Fortified by disciplines" could mean that the
final state of the person (i.e. sthitapraGYa) has BEEN OBTAINED with
effort, not that effort is being made after realization.

2) As that of a seeker of BrahmavidyA, not a Brahmavit. The
"steadfast absorption in the absolute" CAN mean Atma-vichAra,
otherwise the term "duty" CANNOT be applied to all wandering monks in
general, which is what the quote is trying to do.

Since you've brought up this alternate topic here, I will mention in
a later posting of mine about the authorship of the vivekachUDAmaNi,
who I believe was not Sankara.

Have you read my posting on the reconciliation between the JMV and
Sankara's works? The main point there was that the JMV does not have
to parrot everything that Sankara says in order to be in line with
Sankara's works. Rather, the JMV is taking one aspect of Sankara's
works -- viz. sAdhana-chatushhTaya -- and expanding on it and its
relationship to BrahmavidyA and mukti. It is unreasonable to expect
that new ways of explanation or new terminology will not appear in
works such as the JMV for this very reason.

It is not like there is a "gap" (again, I'm not sure what you mean by
this term, but I'm going to assume it to denote a deviation) between
Sankara and VidyAraNya, but only that the latter goes deeper into a
certain aspect of the former's work without contradicting it. For
example, VidyAraNya considers the "akR^itopAsti", which is among the
most important terms in the JMV, but it does not appear in Sankara's
works. True, it is possible to understand Sankara's works without
this term, but introducing this term clarifies so many things in the
JMV that would've been impossible to do so without it.

Why shouldn't this be the same case with the pa~nchapAdikA as well?
Perhaps "mUlAvidyA" was required to understand the pa~nchapAdikA,
just as "akR^itopAsti" is required to understand the JMV. This need
not imply that there was any kind of deviation of the pa~nchapAdikA
from Sankara's works, just as there is no deviation of the JMV from
Sankara's works.

Now you're talking about "good chances" without a solid argument to
stand on.

That is a question that needs to be answered BEFORE dismissing the
pa~nchapAdikA.

Of course, as I've pointed out, the above objections with
"akR^itopAsti" being substituted for "mUlAvidyA" in the context of
the JMV can be made, but those objections are easily refuted.
