Thanks for the detailed explanation. However, I don't think that SSS
has singled out the Bhamati as having been influenced by Mandana. SSS
thinks the Panchapadika also to be following Mandana, which is
probably a mistaken opinion.

There are two positions:

1) Effort after Sravana is required of everyone.
2) Effort after Sravana is required only of the person who lacks
perfect qualifications.

I'm not sure that SSS distinguishes between the two positions. If he
has, I'd like to see some definite evidence for it.

Here's a quote from "The Method of the Vedanta" where SSS claims that
the Panchapadika follows Mandana (page 156):

"Here, in contradiction to his own express teaching, he accepts, in
the manner of Mandana, the idea that immediate apprehension can arise
from repeated affirmation. WHY HE DOES SO IS UNCLEAR {emphases mine}.
...
And the author of the Panchapadika follows Mandana in other points of
his teaching, as when he says: 'Similarly, we see the continuation of
fear arising from the erroneous notion of a snake even in the case of
a rope that has been correctly known as such, when that correct
knowledge is forgotten'."
