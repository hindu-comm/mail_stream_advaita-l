Criticism should be leveled only after every effort has been made to
resolve all contradictions.

For example, we have the following statements in the upanishhads:

KaTha 1.2.20: "The desireless man sees the Self."
BR^ihadAraNyaka 3.5.1: "After Self-realization, one renounces
desires."

The above statements *appear* to be contradictory, but are they
really? The first statement does speak of Self-realization after
renunciation of desires, but allows for the possibility of
Self-realization before renunciation of desires. Also, perhaps the
two statements are speaking of two different kinds of students.

I'd be interested to know why exactly SSS felt that the JMV's views
were not fully in line with Sankara.
