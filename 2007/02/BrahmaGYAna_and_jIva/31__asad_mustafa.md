In the name of God, most gracious, most merciful.

Just a curiosity.

Ramana Maharishi says that as you start enquiring into
the nature of self, it vanishes. And the real non-dual
Self starts shining in its place. The path to this
realization is self-enquiry. Where is the need for
technical exegesis of scriptures? 

Jazakallah
