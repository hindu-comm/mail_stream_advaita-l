Well said!

This is the point I've been making repeatedly - that the Gurus of the
Vedanta tradition, such as Yajnavalkya of the Brihadaranyaka
Upanishad, Sankara, Vidyaranya, Ramana Maharshi, H.H. of Sringeri,
etc. have all accepted the distinction between steady and unsteady
Self-realization. SSS stands alone in his lack of approval.
