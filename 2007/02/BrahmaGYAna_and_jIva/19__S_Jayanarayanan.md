It is interesting that VidyAraNya likens the sthitapraGYa's state to
that of a woman who, although outwardly involved in housework, is
completely absorbed in thinking about her lover. Whereas a GYAnimAtra
is likened to one who sometimes thinks of her lover, sometimes the
housework. The aGYAnI, of course, would be someone who is only
involved in the housework, and is not in love at all.

In Bhagavan's usage, he uses a terminology that is different from
VidyAraNya:

Bhagavan <--> ViydAraNya

jnani  <--> sthitapraGYa
ajnani <--> aGYAnI
One who has a glimpse of the ultimate reality <--> GYAnimAtra

It would be correct to say that the unsteady GYAna is due to the
incomplete removal of vAsanAs, but the main point of the JMV is that
AtmaGYAna can be samyak (perfect), and aparoksha (direct), yet
asthitam (unsteady). This is the state of the GYAnimAtra, whom
Bhagavan refers to as "one who has a glimpse of the Self."

Kartik
