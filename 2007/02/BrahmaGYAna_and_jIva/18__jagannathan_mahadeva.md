Kartik,

In the quote from the Talks you had provided bhagavAn Ramana Maharishi
seems to be calling the person who only has glimpses of the self as an
"aGYAni."

Is this only a case of contextual usage? If bhagavAn were answering
someone else would he then have referred to the person in the question
as one with "unsteady GYAna"?

Would the teaching tradition change or be misinterpreted if I were to
call the "unsteady GYAna" as partial removal of vAsanAs?

Jagan.
