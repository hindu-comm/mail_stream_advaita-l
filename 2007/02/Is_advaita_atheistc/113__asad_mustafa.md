In the name of God, most gracious, most merciful.

I have a querry. Is advaita vedanta atheistic
religion? 

I see Ramana making few references to God. Similarly,
most of  the discussions on this list are also without
reference to God. I understand that 'vedanta' comes
from veda. Is veda polytheistic or monotheistic or
atheistc?

Jazakallah
