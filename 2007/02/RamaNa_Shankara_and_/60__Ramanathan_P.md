Sri Vishwanath, I can only say a few brief things 
according to my personal opinions.

First do we believe in God as a personal being/truth 
who would correspond to the devotee, etc? That is, do 
we accept the words of Sri Krishna in the Gita? We can

understand each other's personality; the brain 
accomodates for this. But definitely even this with 
regard to God is a big question mark. So your question

on incarnation comes later.

If you accept the personal aspect of God as true as 
yours at least, then why should it bother whether He 
who created this universe out of His will, etc, can 
also incarnate in response to His creation? 

So the real question is the former: to what extent do 
you accept God as a personal reality? Brahman as most 
use the term is rather an abstraction, and it is 
doubtful if many understand it as a spiritual reality 
and not as a material completeness.

The standpoint of the scriptures, etc. is that teh 
truth behind all observables is consciousness: a 
Self-operating Principle and not what appears to be 
merely law abiding. This is Brahman, more or less: by 
itself, it is nirguna; put our perspective in middle, 
it is saguna. The appearance includes you and me and 
earth and sky. So why not a Sri Rama and a Sri
Krishna? 
That is, if you accept that it is more than just plain

material law and rather a Conscious Truth that
governs, 
then leave open the possibility of something more than

what you can affirm through reason alone. That 
Conscious truth is at the back of all our
consciouness; 
it need not reveal its true nature to one and all. 
Perhaps if you seek it within, more will be revealed. 
The scriptures are all founded on such revelations.
