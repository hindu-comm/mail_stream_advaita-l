PraNAms,
In response to Shri Manian, advaita means only ONE - there were no two any
time. 
Brahman and jIva are not two different entities. We have not covered
jIva yet; this could be the cause of confusion for some; We will see
this when we come to understand jIva.
Suppose for argument sake, there is a first creation, per Shri Manian's
logic.
What is the basis for the existence of jIvas? There is no past karma;
so every jIva created is a fully realized jIVa - a replica of Brahman?
A realized jIva has escaped the cycle of births and deaths. So what does
this birth of a realized jIva mean? If it is for dharma samsthApana
(establishment of dharma),every jIva is a realized soul; so where is the
need for establishment of dharma?
First creation thus violates the nitya - ever present characteristic of
Brahman.

Besides if there were no plants and animals, how is life possible?
"jIvO jIvasya jIvanam - life of one jIva is facilitated  by another jIva"
So how is life possible without food chain. So the first creation cannot
be explained. As much as anAdi- beginningless time is beyond our
comprehension, first creation is not explainable. All the three philosophies
- dvaita, vishiShTadvaita and advaita are on the same page on this.

Hari OM
K. Ramakrishna.

Thanks. But I have difficulty understand this, even an endless loop has
a beginning, right?
There must always be a first time for anything, no?
If we take your arguement then, looks like Jiva and brahman are two
separate entities and has been
in existance for ever and will continue that way for ever.
