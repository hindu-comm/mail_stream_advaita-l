"There was no such initial state - karma is beginningless. The universe with all jIva-s still exists in subtle form even after dissolution, and these get 'recycled' into the next cycle of creation."

  This explanation looks too elusive nd certainly doesnt answer the point raised!!!
  When the whole karma thoery is about cause and effet, how it can be beginingless??? Can someone be clearer on this please.

Probably one of whatever species Brhman wanted, right? (Most probably no
animals, birds, insects etc as they are considered lower forms to human and only are
born due to human's bad karma) Because there was no cause for
a vast number of species or vast number of humans as there was no karma to start with. 
There would have been no sorrow, no pain and only all bliss, probably like the Garden of Eden? 
So what do you think started off this chain of Karma and the world as we see it now?
