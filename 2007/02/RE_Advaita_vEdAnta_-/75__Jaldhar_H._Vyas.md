Perhaps,  but it is an important distinction to make. Karma is the side 
effect of avidya--the ignorant notion that there is "I" who "does" things. 
The only way to be truly free from actions is to get rid of that avidya. 
Just not acting is by itself not enough as Krshna Bhagavan shows in the 
Gita.
