Thanks Krishnamurthy ji. I have more questions.

 Let us take the very first time the Jagat was created, when there was no karma
at all for Jivas. At that time how many humans and creatures would have been born?
Probably one of whatever species Brhman wanted, right? (Most probably no
animals, birds, insects etc as they are considered lower forms to human and only are
born due to human's bad karma) Because there was no cause for
a vast number of species or vast number of humans as there was no karma to start with. 
There would have been no sorrow, no pain and only all bliss, probably like the Garden of Eden? 
So what do you think started off this chain of Karma and the world as we see it now? 

Pranam
Kris
