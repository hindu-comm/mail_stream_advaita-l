Namaste,

Another approach to understanding vijnAna:

Let us translate jnAna as knowledge (about
something).
Example: brahmajnAna = knowledge about brahma.
In the same spirit, vijnAna can mean knowledge
about vi-kAra (the sound vi). And in sAmkhya, 
vikAra is the "cause" of transformation of
prakRti. So vijnAna then is the knowledge that
enables one to understand the "science" of
transformation of prakRti. In this context, it
is not surprising that scientific knowledge
in general is referred to as "vijnAna" in
many current Indian laguages.

Regards,
Shrinivas
