Not quite. vi is a prefix (upasarga) that is used to denote division (e.g.,
vibhAga), emphasis (in vijJAna), change (vikAra, vichitra), opposition
(kreeNAti=buys, vikreeNAti = sell). So vijJAna can be said to be "special
knowledge". It does not refer to any transformation. Incidentally, the word
"science" comes to from the Latin scient = to know. The noun scientia =
knowledge.
