Mahesh,
     My understanding of this scientific experiment is as follows.:
The mind is still only one which makes cognition based on information
available.
It is some what similar to a search engine which has information cataloged
(indexed) on several systems
that are networked. If the network among the cataloged systems malfunctions,
you might get different
answers for the same search at different times. Still the search program is
only one and the information it got
was different based on which network was working at that time.

So I think in this case, the mind is still only one, but it produces results
based on what is available at that point in time.
As Amuthan Ji said, this is still damaged brain and mithya makes you think
that there are two minds when in fact
there is only one.

Pranam
Kris
