My apologies for bringing up the topic again. I wish to learn why the
differences between the tradition and SSS are important, and I am sure (and
hope) the moderators would understand as long as the topic does not snowball
into a shouting match.

Again the topic rised its hood
> onceagain and as usual  targetting my beloved parama guruji Sri SSS


Frankly, I am not sure how SSS was targeted by either shrI Jayanarayanan's
or my mail. People have at best said that SSS could be/was wrong (Note btw,
in just the same way as SSS said prior advaitins were wrong). I am not sure
if disagreement necessarily means disrespect, and as long as there is no
disrespect, discussions could prove fruitful.

But JMV did not say there is a gradation in AtmaGYAna. The gradation claimed
is wrt the force of the vAsanas.

But again JMV did not say something needs to be done to become brahma.
Something needs to be done to attain jIvanmukti. And emphasis is placed on
jIvanmukti rather than simply AtmaGYana for obvious reasons.

jnAni in absolute sense...brahma jnAna is not an objective knowledge like

Could you let me know if this is your position -- that no one can become an
AtmaGYAni unless he is already firm in the "inner and outer discipline"
(Please see the quotes I gave to shrI Jayanarayanan from the Method of
Vedanta.) In other words, are you contending SV (svAmi vidyAraNya's) claim
that AtmaGYAna could arise without perfection in the inner and outer
discipline. Do let me know. Thanks.

A.Siddhartha.
