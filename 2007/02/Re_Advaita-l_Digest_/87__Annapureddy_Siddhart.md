What shrI Bhaskar argued for in his mails was that there is no difference in
the AtmaGYAna of a GYAnimAtra and a sthitapraGYa (or so I understand it).
And I feel the usage of steady and unsteady with AtmaGYAna (rather than to
establishment in AtmaGYAna) contributed to the confusion. (If this is not
the case, I will take up the discussion with shrI Bhaskar later on).

Apologies, I used "brahmaniShTha" in the sense of a brahmaGYAni, and the
expression "different grades" to refer to GYAnimAtra at one end of the
spectrum to sthitapraGYa at the other end.

Could you tell me how this paraphrasing of yours is different from what I
said above? (I am confused by your "this is exactly what the JMV does NOT
intend", as I do not see that I wrote anything vastly different.) The only
assertion I made (that could be contentious) was that a GYAnimAtra also does
not have any rebirth (and this was my deduction, so I could be wrong).
Please let me know if this is not true.

Yes. I agree with this. The confusion probably resulted from my using
"different grades" instead of GYAnimAtra and  sthitapraGYa.

If only a sthitapraGYa is being referred to, then what does the expression
"carrying knowledge to perfection" mean in the above quote? Knowledge is
discrete, i.e., you either have knowledge or not. There are no grades in
knowledge. Thus, the above could not have referred to knowledge, but to
establishment in knowledge.

Also, the context of the above quote is a seeker and not a sthitapraGYa. The
title of the chapter is "The limits of spiritual practice" in which the
different practices for a seeker of brahmaGYAna are discussed. In fact, the
last sentence in the above quote "when we speak of resort to the means of
knowledge coming to an end when knowledge is acquired, it does not mean that
these auxiliaries also come to an end" show -- (a) that the seeker is being
considered here, (b) even after acquiring knowledge, the inner and outer
discipline need to be carried out for "carrying (the acquired) knowledge to
perfection".

I do not have the shAN^kara bhAShya in Sanskrit on this quote. But I am
surprised that even for a sthitapraGYa (according to the definition of
sthitapraGYa by SV), "wrong knowledge, though cancelled, may continue for a
time through the force of impressions (saMskAra)".

Are you saying that this is not the case with a GYAnimAtra? Even according
to SV, GYAnimAtra  has samyak.h aparOkSha brahmaGYAna, right?  So, how did
you conclude that the above refers to a sthitapraGYa, and not a GYAnimAtra.

The very title of the section refers to a "firm establishment in the
> Self".


I am not sure how you concluded that the GYanimAtra is not being referred to
here.

If the AtmaGYana were to be steady, then there would be no need for further
effort in any practices (for attaining vAsanakShaya and manOnAsha). But the
very references to discipline even after attaining brahmaGYAna show that it
is intended for firm establishment in brahma.

I am deleting the discussion on another quote. Maybe we can focus on the
above for now.

Is it the case that you consider vivEkachUDAmaNi as authoritative, and the
fact that it follows JMV makes JMV authoritative? Traditionally,
vivEkachUDAmaNi is ascribed to shaN^kara, while SSS ascribes it to
shaN^karAnanda. If you feel vivEkachUDAmaNi makes JMV authoritative
(presumably by borrowing from it), that would make vivEkachUDAmaNi a later
work (in other words, not of shaN^kara's pen). And SSS made the point that
much earlier works like the paJNchapAdika are not in line with shaN^kara,
then why should we even consider the vivEkachUDAmaNi (a much later work) to
be in line with shaN^kara.

At the outset, let me make it clear that "I" am not saying anything. I have
been trying to understand the differences between the tradition and SSS. And
SSS did say that prior advaitins and advaitin works (starting from the
paJNchapAdika) deviated from shaN^kara. And this means that they
misinterpreted the prasthAnatrayi. And hence, according to SSS, they could
not be shrOtriyas (where the term is taken to mean correct knowledge of the
interpretation of scripture).

By the very words "CANNOT IN ANY WAY", there is a connotation that,
potentially, there is a gap in shaN^kara's thought and the later works. In
other words, while the later works do not contradict shaN^kara in letter,
there is a good chance that they are not faithful in spirit. To give an
example, consider the advaitin and the dvaitin interpretations of the
prasthAnatrayi. I am not sure if "the doctrine of dvaita vEdAnta cannot in
any way be interpreted as being in line with the prasthAnatrayi".

Even otherwise, take the example of mUlAvidyA. If no one has any experience
of the existence of such an entity, one might as well take another theory
that does not resort to mUlAvidyA. In other words, the rule of Occam's
razor.

As I've pointed

I am not sure if SSS disagrees with the above distinction. AFAIK, the
differences lie mainly in the bhAva or abhAva nature of avidyA.

just as it is meaningless

As I mentioned above, it's Occam's razor. Why talk of something when there
is no need to?  (Please note that I am not very familiar with the importance
of mUlAvidyA in the tradition. Right now, I do not see the use of it. So, my
question is also to know more about it, rather than just dismissing it).

A consistent theory of advaita vEdAnta which does not make an appeal to
mUlAvidyA. This is what I mean.

I can argue that curly-brackets {} can be "done away with" in

Note that this is just syntactic sugaring (i.e., human convention). If a
machine were to be given this task, one would eliminate all needless things,
and get it down to the bare minimum. So, the question is, "is mUlAvidyA
simply syntactic sugaring? Or is there a fundamental importance attached to
it in the tradition?"
