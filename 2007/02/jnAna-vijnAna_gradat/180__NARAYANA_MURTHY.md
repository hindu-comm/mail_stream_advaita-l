  Shri Bhaskar prabhu :-


"When an able shrOtrIya brahma nishTa jnAni teaches this jnAna to an uttama adhikAri, during shravaNa itself both jnAna & vijnAna automatically happens...Whereas  those who have not been taught by brahmanishTa can only have shastra pAnditya which is exclusion of anubhavAtmaka vijnAna. "


"But befofe doing I earnestly request prabhuji-s here to not to drag the *individual names* of some exalted personalities & try to compare them & say who's superior to who & who's knowledgeable than who... etc. etc."

Prabhuji, "anubhavAtmaka vignyAnA", "happening of automatic jnyAna and vijnyAna" and "able shrotriya brahamanishTa jnyAni" - are these terminologies too subjective?



are there any yardsticks withinwhich you can measure these terminologies? - albeit uttama adhikAri (the sishya per se) is well defined by shankara in viveka chudamani



Although not explicit, there is disguised contradiction in the first and second quote

Shri karthik :-



"I must point out that this list firmly stands by the Sringeri Math when it comes to understanding Sankara's doctrine."

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

sustained contributions by acharyavaryaas of this vyakhyana simhasanam and the "Uttama Adhikari sishyaas"  of their holiness stands testimony to this fact. As I had read earlier in the list, even shri.SSS was motivated in study of Acharya granthas by AchAryAs of Sharada peetham.



no offense.  But use of better phrase in place of "Absolute Nonsense" would still make better sense.

N.Murthy
