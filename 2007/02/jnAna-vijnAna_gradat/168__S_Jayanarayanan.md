Absolute nonsense.

There is no such thing as gradations in Atma-jnana. The other person
who has repeatedly pointed this out in this list is Annapureddy
Siddartha Reddy, who has specified that it is GRADATIONS IN THE
ESTABLISHMENT OF ATMAJNANA.

Show me where Vidyaranya speaks of gradations in Atma-jnana! You are
obviously raising a straw-man argument here.

H.H. Chandrasekhara Bharati Mahaswamigal of Sringeri has himself
admitted to gradations in the establishment of Atmajnana. Therefore,
by arguing against it, SSS is aligning himself directly against the
Sringeri Math.

I must point out that this list firmly stands by the Sringeri Math
when it comes to understanding Sankara's doctrine.

There is no disagreement between Vidyaranya and Sankara on any of the
above points.

Au contraire.

"Panditya" itself is taken as referring to Paramartha Atmajnana!

Sankara is saying that the Paramartha Atmajnana is nothing but the
Self that is revealed after ignorance is removed by
Sravana-Manana-Nididhyasana on scriptural statements!

!!!!!  Hello...!!!!!!

It seems as if you're trying to say that "Jnana Nishtha" can refer to
the Mumukshu (as you've indicated in your summary below)!

WOW -- talk about twisting theory by debasing terminology!

And why not, may I ask?

There is no problem in assuming that Sankara only means Paramartha
Atmajnana by the term "jnanotpatti" throughout his Prasthanatrayi.

This easily fits into Vidyaranya's thesis that effort needs to be
made to attain steadiness in Atmajnana.

Again -- where is the evidence for your tall claim?

It appears to me that you are simply *stating* your hypothetical
theory rather than *establishing* it.

No contradictions with Vidyaranya here.

Not at all. "Jnana Nishtha" always only refers to the Jnani.

This has not been proven.

As I mentioned above, "Panditya" itself can refer to Paramartha
Atmajnana.

Which is redundant, because there are too many potholes in your first
posting.
