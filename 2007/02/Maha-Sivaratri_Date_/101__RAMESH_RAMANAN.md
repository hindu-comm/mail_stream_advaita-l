Dear Sri Jayanarayananji,

  I do believe that Mahashivratri falls on February 16, 2007, Friday in India. As the US is about 10 hours behind Indian time, may be, the same festival may be celebrated later in the US. But I don't understand how it could be on February 15, 2007 in the USA. Pranams, Ramesh
