What is the correct date for Maha-Sivaratri this year? There is a
conflict among US-based (Feb. 15th) and India-based sources (Feb.
16th). Does it mean that US and India adopt different dates for this
festival?


February 15 (US-based sources):

SVBF

Shiva-Vishnu Temple in Livermore, California

February 16 (India-based sources):

Panchangam

Thanks,
Kartik
