Some of the temples in the US celebrate festivals based on adjusted 
panchangam published primarily for the US. This takes the tithi in India and 
sees how long the tithi is available on the previous day here to decide 
whether the festival should be celebrated the previous day or the next day. 
Some times it follows the Indian calendar also.

This has been going on for some time, at least I know for the past 2 years. 
I understand from a friend in Chicago that the temples in Chicago do not 
bother about this adjusted calendar. They follow the Indian panchangam along 
with a time lag for the US.

Thanks,
Ravi
