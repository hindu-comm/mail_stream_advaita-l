To be precise the east coast is 10.5 hours behind and the west coast is
13.5 hours behind.

Earlier you mean.  You subtract as you go westwards.  But I think there is
a different reason:

Is it because krshna 13 is a pradosha? My reading of nirnayasindhu is that
according to Skandapurana if pradosha occurs on the 13th, Shivaratri
should be celebrated then rather than of krshna 14 however I'm not sure
I've translated it right. Further information gratefully accepted.
