I don't agree with your contrived explanation, but be that as it may.
Perhaps we can give SSS the benefit of doubt in the above context.

How about this quote then, where the topic is the Panchapadika (p.
463):

"Here the doctrine is that the power of Ignorance persists throughout
the three states, accompanied by the latent impression of the ego.
But several points are not explained. When Ignorance has been
abolished through metaphysical knowledge, how can it in some sense
continue through a latent impression?"

SSS has phrased his objection in the form of a question. In other
words, SSS is incredulous that a latent impression can exist after
metaphysical knowledge!
