Dear sir

I'm very much interested in learning and sharing my views in advaita 
vedanta. I'm a devotee of the Jagadguru of Sringeri Sharada Peetham and 
I've attending classes on Upanishads.

Please enroll me as a member so that I can improve my knowledge on 
advaita.

Thanking You

J.R. Sankaranarayanan
