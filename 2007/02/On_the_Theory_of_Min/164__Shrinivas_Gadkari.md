Namaste,

One of the most fundamental demonstrations of the 
role of consciousness ("to my understanding" - this
phrase is to be understood for any deductions made
herein) is in the field of quantum physics.

The story in brief follows:
1. We start with two entities:"the observer", and 
"the observed universe".
2. Laws of science attempt to systematically
formulate the observations made by the observer
about the observed universe.
3. Let us postulate, the observer itself is
an abstraction of the phenomenon in the observed
universe.
4. The most fundamental formulation of our
understanding of the universe today is in terms
of quantum physics.
5. Quantum physics formulates a "state equation"
for any and every aspect of the universe. Call this
set on entities that the state equation describes
as a "system". The state equation has information 
within it to predict:
(a) Probability that the system will be in any of the
allowed states, and
(b) How these probabilities evolve with time.
6. When the system is left on "its own", it evolves
according to the state equation - this is the
so called "wave like" behavior of the system (and
in fact the universe in general).
7. When an observer attempts to observe the system, 
the state of the system STOPS evolving, and collapses
to one of the allowed states. This is the so called
"particle like" behavior of the system (and in fact
the universe in general).
8. To give an example, the snapshots of the universe
that we register by whatever means (seeing, measuring
etc.) are the outcome of particle like behavior. 
While, all the physical and chemical (and also 
biological) properties of the constituents of the 
universe are the outcome of the wave like behavior.
9. However, if the observer itself is an abstraction 
of the phenomenon in the observed universe, it is an
abstraction of some quantities with the state
equation. 
10. Also an observer attempting to observe a system
itself is a system that should evolve according to 
some state equation.
That is - it should evolve in a wave like manner.
The collapse of the state equation is unexplainable.
11. That is there should be no particle like 
phenomenon at all.
12. However, if observer is postulated to be an entity
"different" for the observed universe, everything 
falls in place: 
(a) The system (universe) by itself, evolves in a 
wave like manner, while (b) When an observer interacts

with the system it forces a particle like behavior - 
collapse of the state equation.

Whether one agrees with the arguments listed above
or not, to some extent also depends on Faith. For
a determined critic, no amount of explanation
will suffice.

Regards,
Shrinivas
