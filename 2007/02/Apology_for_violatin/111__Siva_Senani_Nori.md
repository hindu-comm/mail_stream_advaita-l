Sir

Thanks for pointing out my unthoughtful acts. Before reading the dharmasastras, one should follow dharma first, and definitely not violate it flippantly (I mean I was under no pressure or obligation to put up the extracts). I sincerely regret my thoughtless action and hereby vow to act with caution in future.

Regards
Senani

Dear Siva Senani,

The books is probably still copyrighted. The copyrights seem to belong
to the BORI. It may be best to not post it on the web.
