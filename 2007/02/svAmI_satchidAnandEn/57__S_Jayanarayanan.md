Find any quote of mine, in any mailing list, where I spoke of
"partial Brahman-realization" as being advaita siddhi, and I promise
to become a mute follower of SSS.

As I've never spoken of this in any context, let alone the
discussions on the JMV, there are two possibilities here:

1) You genuinely believe that the JMV considers "partial
Brahman-realization", in which case I can only direct you to re-read
my postings. I cannot help you understand the JMV any other way.

2) Since the thesis of the JMV is iron-clad, the technique adopted
here is that of creating and defeating a strawman.

You're referring to the BSB 3.4.47.

I'll study that passage carefully, and prepare myself so as to be
able to prove you wrong when you post on it :-)
