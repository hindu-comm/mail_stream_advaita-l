In the midst of other ongoing discussions, the above post seems to have got 
ignored. We have a basic description at our website, 
www.advaita-vedanta.org/avhp, but it is a barebones version.

To really get into the fine points of the two sub-schools, I would suggest 
to get hold of a good translation/study of appayya dIkshita's 
siddhAntaleSa-sangraha. There is an old 1935 translation by Sri S S 
Suryanarayana Sastri, from the Dept of Philosophy, Univ of Madras, and there 
is a newer 1990 translation by Esther Solomon, from the L D Institute of 
Indology, Ahmedabad.

Regards,
Vidyasankar
