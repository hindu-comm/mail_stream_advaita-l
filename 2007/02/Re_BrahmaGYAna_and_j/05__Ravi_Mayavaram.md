namaste Savithriji,

I agree with you that using all caps was unnecessary and rude.

United Nations Climate Report (on 5th page) cites heated debates that happen in
vedanta circles as one of the leading causes for global warming :-)) Al gore has
even requested us to use some portions of our archives for his next
documentary!! We are not that far away from weather :-))

I think bringing in SSS was not that disconnected. At least I expected it to
come up  because it is quite relevant some of the recent discussions. But it
should have been done respectfully.

This process is nonlinear. Anyone following patanjali's raja yoga will know that
only an accomplished yogi can perfectly follow yama and niyama. Rarely you will
find a beginner who meets the prerequisites of sAdhana chatuShTaya. But this
high standard is set to indicate that to attain a perfect/steady Atmaj~nAna one
has to ultimately meet these standards. 


With best wishes,
Ravi
