There is a very pithy verse in naishkarmyasiddhi on this -

niyamaH parisaMkhyA vA vidhy artho 'pi bhaved yataH |
anAtmA-adarSananena eva parAtmAnam upAsmahe ||

Whether one takes the meaning of the upanishad (e.g. vijnAya prajnAM kurvIta 
etc.) as a niyama vidhi (limiting injunction) or a parisaMkhyA vidhi 
(excluding injunction), only through not seeing (adarSana) the not-Self 
(anAtma) do we worship (upAsmahe) the supreme Self (parAtmAnam).

Regards,
Vidyasankar
