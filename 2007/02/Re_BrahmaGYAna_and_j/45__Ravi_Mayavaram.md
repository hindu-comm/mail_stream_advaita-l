While dealing with prasaN^khyaana in naishhkarmyasiddhi this issue is discussed
in detail. This is what I understood, corrections are welcome.

* shravaNa + manana is enough to reveal the knowledge and remove any samshaya
about pramaaNa and prameya etc.

* nididhyaasana is not actually meditation on  this knowledge.  brahman is not
going to be revealed by such a (repeated) meditation, if it was not revealed
before. nididhyAsana is constant warding or holding of viparyaya or incorrect
knowledge, such as jagat is real and so on.

* In the context of what Kartik posted, I think, such a nididhyAsana destroys
vAsana-s which constantly bring such incorrect ideas to the surface. 


I tried to understand using an example.  In the case of adhama adhikArins,
shravaNa and manAna may reveal Atmaj~nAna by say creating crack the cover of
darkness (like a break in cloud cover revealing Sun). But this is not same as
rising above the darkness to have a uninterrupted vision.  For such cases,
nididhyAsana is the step of holding of this darkness enveloping again, till one
 completely overcomes it.
