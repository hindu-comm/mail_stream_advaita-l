Dear all,

This mail is not about advaita or sAdhana per se.  But
it is an ancillary Vedic
topic namely the Sanskrit language using the Paninian
system.  My teacher has
compiled a list of good Sanskrit grammar books that
one should possess in order
to be serious student of Sanskrit.  I am sure you
understand that this list
cannot be unique.  It is one teacher's opinion of what
a simple/good collection
is.

I am forwarding this for the benefit any Sanskrit
aspirants in this list as
members of such lists typically have overlapping
interests.  

This is for your information.  Please follow the list
policies and do not enter
into elaborate discussion on its contents.

With love,
SVS

(more than a thousand

Tripathi and Sudhakar

 This has two of the

good Hindi translation.
> 3. "The Astadhyayi of Panini" by Srisa Chandra Vasu,
published by Motilal

Kasika.
> 
> There are also small books which have only the
Astadhyayi sutras - Sutra

the sutras and an

one that I have a few

Pandey, published by

>

numbers of the sutras where

> 1. "A Dictionary of Sanskrit Grammar" by Kashinath
Vasudev Abhyankar and J.
> M. Shukla published in Gaekwad's Oriental Series
#134.
> 
> For those who want to make a gradual entry into the

Sanskrit" - First Book.

Ramlal Kapoor Trust.
> This book is also available in Hindi.  There is a
part two also (but only in

> 
> The Siddhanta Kaumudi is the re-ordering of Panini's
Astadhyayi by topic,

400 years ago.  There are

good ones:
> 1. "Siddhanta Kaumudi" with Tattvabodhini commentary
edited by Vasudev
> Lakshman Shastri Panashikar, published by Chaukhamba
Sanskrit Pratishthan,
> Delhi.  This is a re-print of the famed old Nirnaya
Sagar edition   It has a

Patha etc.) at the back.
> 2. "Vaiyakarana Siddhanta Kaumdi" in 4 volumes,
edited by Giridhar Sarma
> Chaturvedi and Parameswarananda Sarma Vidyabhaskar -
published by Motilal
> Banarasidass.  This edition has two Sanskrit
commentaries - particularly the

the most popular, even

> For those who prefer English:
> 3. "The Siddhanta Kaumudi" by Srisa Chandra Vasu
published by Motilal

> 
> The most popular Sanskrit grammar text studied today
is the Laghu Siddhanta

> "Laghu Siddhanta Kaumudi" with Bhaimi Vyakhya (6
volumes) - published by
> Bhaimi Prakashan, 537, Lajpat Rai Market, Delhi -
110006.
> 
> One should have at least one edition of the Kaasika
and one of the Siddhanta

planning to make some more

> 2. "Madhaviya DhatuVritti" edited by Vijayapala
Vidyavaridhih, published by
> Ramlal Kapoor Trust.  This is a very respected
Sanskrit commentary on the
> Dhatu Patha by the great Vedic commentator
Sayanacarya.
> 3. "KshiraTarangini" commentary on the Dhatu Patha
by Kshiraswami - edited by
> Yudhishthira Mimamsaka, published by Ramlal Kapoor
Trust.  A very old

footnotes.
> 
> 
> The most well-known and original thesaurus of
Sanskrit is undoubtedly the

complete without this one.  Of

> 1. "Namalinganusasana alias Amarakosa" of Amarsimha
with Sanskrit commentary,
> edited by Pandit Sivadatta Dadhimatha and revised by
Vasudev Laksmana
> Panasikara, published by Chaukhamba Sanskrti
Pratishthan (reprint of old

particularly useful because the

etymology of each word.
> 2. "Amarakosa" in 3 volumes with South Indian
Sanskrit commentaries edited by
> Prof. A. A. Ramanathan, published by The Adyar
Library and Research Centre. 
> Gives good explanations but without sutras.
> 
> The following is a special dictionary contaning all
the indeclinable words in

full of good information

> 1. "AvyayaKosa - A Dictionary of Indeclinables"
published by The Sanskrit

make some photocopies.
> 
> Volume I of "Laghu Siddhanta Kaumudi" with Bhaimi
Vyakhya (mentioned above)

derived using the

the Astadhyayi which

Panini.  Some of these are very

Unadi sutras - see sutra

are also part of the

the first affix given is

sutras along with good

published by Ramlal
