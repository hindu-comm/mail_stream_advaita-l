Hari Om,
Advaita is neither a theist nor atheist but trans theist. it presupposes
open theism initially, to develop into the agnostic atheism and finally
culminates to trans theism. Sankara is purely theistic as he strongly
condemns niriswara theories of Samkhya.Sankara fashions his arguments with a
blend of traditional religiosities along with the sophistications of
metaphysical arbitraries in the mode of agnostic reservations of judgments
about the ultimate Nirguna Brahman at the pAramarthika standpoint that makes
him be amicably regarded as a trans theistic personality
