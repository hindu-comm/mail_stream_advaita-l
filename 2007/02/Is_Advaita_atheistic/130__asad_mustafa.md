In the name of God, most gracious, most merciful.

Thanks everyone for their informative posts.

However, from these responses I get an impression that
certain parts of vedas proclaim montheism, others
polytheism, some trans-theism and yet others atheism.
Is it not internal contradiction?

Jazakallah
