It is distinct, for the person who sees only paramArtha. The one who sees 
only paramArtha, by definition, does not see any vyavahAra, so the question 
of the distinction between vyavahAra and paramArtha does not even arise for 
him. Nor does the question of the removal of distinctions, in this state.

However, for the sake of those of us, who habitually see only vyavahAra, a 
clear distinction is made, in order to reveal that the paramArtha state 
exists, that it is possible to realize it, and that vyavahAra disappears in 
it.

Regards,
Vidyasankar
