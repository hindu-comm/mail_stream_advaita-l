Dear Sir,

Does shankara comment anywhere that for realization taking formal sanyasa is a must? I have heard that there is a scriptural passage also in support of this(I am unable to recollect the source). Shankara seems to have upheld this view in one of his introduction to the upanishad(aitareya?)

Regards,

Br. Vinayaka
