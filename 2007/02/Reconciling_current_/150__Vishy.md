Dear Maheshji

  Pranams. Though I too have read little bit on advaita vedanta, I am not an expert to quote like other learned  members .

  However, let me try to put my little understanding in this way....

  Take this simile.....

  Take human as a modern day Personal Computer, all peripherals being various indriyas...
  Than the 'chip'  can be compared  to the physical brain and the software which is needed to run the PC (operating system) as "Mind"  which of course cant be seen but very essential for functioning of the PC. This software (OS) is the one under continuous process of development from various experiences of past.

  But even with all this the PC doesn't function without the ' Power'  in some or other form. This 'energy' can we call 'the consciousness"?

  Does this comparison make any sense???/

A lot of what you say is based on the Tripura Rahasya and talks of "a still
part of the mind and the moving part." such that "The moving mind is what is
termed as the mind, in general, and the still mind remains as the
consciousness!"

I have not read the book nor am I familiar with the above theory so cannot
comment on your post in any intelligible way. If you (or any other member
familiar with this text) can throw some light as to how it explains the two
tests that I cited in my post, it would help tremendoulsy. Furthermore, I am
curious if this theory is in consonance with 'standard Vedanta' theory of
mind.

Pranams, Mahesh
