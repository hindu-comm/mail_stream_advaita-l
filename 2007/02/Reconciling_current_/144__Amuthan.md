the condition here is similar to what happens between two births. the
person whom you were in any of your previous births could be quite
different from who you are now and you typically have no clue about
that. even death, which is far more physically destructive than any of
the disorders we are talking about, does not cause any harm to the
sUkShma sharIra (ref. gItA 'vAsAmsi jIrNAni...').

the two cases are not entirely similar either, the difference being
that in the split brain case the shift in personality happens at a
much shorter time scale and occurs alternatively within a single
lifetime. but it is still true that actions done (with any one of
those personalities in the split brain case) imprint the corresponding
vAsanAs in the manas and generate the corresponding saMskArAs. in this
sense, there is no 'damage ' to the sUkShma sharIra which serves as a
receptacle for vAsanAs and a generator of saMskArAs. (btw, by a
'damaged' brain, i was having in mind any condition of the brain which
is not normal.)

thus the cases you have referred to are purely physical disorders and
affect the manas only in the sense that they add to the already
existing store of vAsanAs.
