Sri Kathirasan

I don't think Sri Ramakrishnan committed a mistake; we quote English translations of the Sanskrit sentences of various acharyas authors all the time and don't necessarily add a disclaimer that the translator might have committed a mistake. In this particular case, it is not clear that the translator had committed a mistake, and till such a mistake is proven, we should assume that the translation is faithful, as is the custom in such matters.

If it is clear that he has, then Sri Gangolli should be censured, not Sri Ramakrishnan, for propagating a false view. If any of the sishyagaNa of Sri Satchidanendra Sarasvati Svami can kindly provide the original Kannada, the original intention would be immediately clarified. 

Quite apart from that, my posts do not contain a literary criticism - that is I have not taken the word 'kingpin', examined its use in sports (bowling - among the ten pins, it is the largest pin in the centre) or its literary extensions - and I restated the views in my own words drawing from the tone and content of other teachings of SSS made available. And then, we have a strong suggestion from Sri Bhaskar, one of the most vocal followers of SSS on this list in the last one year, that 'anubhava' triumphs Sruti. What does that show? If not 'kingpin' there is some other status attributed to anubhava, high enough that subscribers to SSS's teachings believe that such an anubhava is more important than Sruti.

Finally, a positive perception of SSS can always be created by thoughtful followers.

Namaste Sri Rama,

I find no reason why you should relegate all of Sri Bhaskar's mails to
the trash can? The mistake was yours to have not verified the quote.
Let's face it... we did see so many threads with the word 'kingpin' in
the subject line. Moreover, you are justifying how your mistake is
acceptable. Don't you think that this could have created a negative
perception of SSS's teachings? 

Warmest Regards,
Kathirasan K

Dear list members,

Some quick notes.

1. I had noted that just one of the excerpts was a translation, but
unfortunately in an ellipitical manner, in my conclusion section.
Unfortunately, I neglected to note that *this particular passage on
anubhava was the translation*. My apologies if anyone got confused.

2. No problem, there are many equivalent passages in SSSs own works.
This will be substituted when I get the time. The intent is what is
important, not the particular word, be it kingpin, supreme, etc.

3. Obviously I am human and can miss a few sentences in the list here
and there. If Siva Senani thought this passage was written by SSS
himself, I apologize. It was written in KannaDa and it was translated
by SSS. The rest of the quotations are ALL directly from SSS's own
pen.

4. Note that the Karyalaya is presenting this book AS A GENUINE
TEACHING OF SSS. So, let's just take it that the translation is not
out of line with SSS's teachings according to the esteemed disciples
of SSS who form the kaaryaalaya. As a matter of fact the translation
is not ot of line with regard to content, and I'll modify the paper a
little later, after I implement changes by Prem and Vidyasankar

5. I am now completely fed up with Bhaskars personal attacks, and
henceforth all his emails will be relegated straight to the trash-can.

Rama
