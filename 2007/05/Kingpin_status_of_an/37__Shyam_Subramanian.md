Dear all,

This book by SrI satchidAnandendra sarasvati svAminaH is in the digital
library of India (http://dli.iiit.ac.in/ ) along with other works written by
Him. I downloaded it and even sent it Sri Senani before realizing that it
was first published in 1996. If any of the list members know for sure that
there has not been a copyright violation, I can send it to the list.

Regards,
Shyam
