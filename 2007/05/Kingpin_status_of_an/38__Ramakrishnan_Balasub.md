There is something fishy about these texts being in the Digital
library. First of all, the other books by SSS in the Digital library
could not have been published in 1881, as the Digital library claims.
SSS was (if I recollect right) 95 years old when he passed away in
1975. So in 1881, he should have been 1 year old, or so !!!

Someone with access to Karyalaya authorities should report this
violation and get those texts removed.
