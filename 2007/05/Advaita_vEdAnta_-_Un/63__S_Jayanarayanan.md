Yet another piece of nonsense! To say that "our perception is void"
is ridiculous, because according to Advaita Vedanta, our Perception
is Brahman Itself! Please consult Brahma Sutra 3.3.54, or even the
Drk-Drshya-Viveka.

Are you saying that Brahman is NOT the intelligent and material
"support" of Jagat and Jiva? Unless "support" means something
different from "cause", you have just gone AGAINST one of the
fundamental tenets of Advaita Vedanta, where Brahman is said to be
BOTH the intelligent as well as the material cause of the Jagat!

"One is the view of the brahmasUtra that brahman is at once both the
instrumental and the material cause of the universe."
