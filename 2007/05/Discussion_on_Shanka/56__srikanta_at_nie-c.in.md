I am following with interest the discussions on the interpretation of the
word"srutyadayah",the place of "anubhava","tarka" in understanding the
Shankara Vedanta.Perhaps it may not be out of place to consider
Prof.Hiriyanna's exposition on "avidya","Maya" and the nature of "avidya"
and "Maya".He was one of the authorities on Advaita Vedanta who could
explain these topics lucidly through his books on Indian Philosopy.
