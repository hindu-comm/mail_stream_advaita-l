Dear Vijay kartik

  pranam.

  if you reside in chennai, contact Sringeri Bharathi Vidyashram, Chennai or Tattvaloka Auditorium chennai.  I read that Anugraha Bhashanam of Jagadguru  Sri Bharathi Theertha MahaswaminaH and other functions of Sankara Jayanthi Celebrations at Sankara mata, Bangalore were telecasted live at these places. Chaturamnaya sammelanam, being a rare event (hope earlier took place in 1974 or 1978) - I hope may be again telecasted live over these places.
