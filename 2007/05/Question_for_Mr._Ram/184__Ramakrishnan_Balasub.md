Dear Sri Ranga Rathnam,

I do not have the book you quote below, nor have listened to Sri Mani
Dravids lectures.

In the context of epsitemic errors, what I meant was this. The basic
adhyaasa, superimposition of the real and unreal is what leads to
epsitemic errors. This is because the notion of epistemic assumes
apriori the existence of a pramaatR^i (not saaxin), who undergoes
change. So, avidyaa cannot fundamentally be epistemic. Now, the paper
does not discuss the mechanism of epistemic errors, nor discussion of
avidyaa by later advaitins. This is too much to be discussed in one
place. I hope to write in detail about these in some later publication
and show that although terminology between shankara and some later
advaitins can vary greatly, they capture essentially the same
philosophy. The paper as it is is narrowly focussed and pretty much
refutes the interpretation of avidyaa by SSS, that's all.

Rama
