praNAm all,

(Apologies, this is my third mail to the list today, but only the
first directly about SSS)

Namaste Bhaskarji,

I know you did take a stand as to your last post on the thread, but
may I kindly ask you to confirm, (be so in a private mail, if you
decide not to respond in the thread) if the following is really what
you meant (emphasis mine)?

> If the later vyAkhyAnakAra-s ...
> ... adopted THEIR UNIQUE METHOD OF APPROACHING NON-DUAL
> PHILOSOPHY OF SCRIPTURE ...so be it..we dont have any issue with it...but
> for god's sake let them not announce that THEY ARE INDEED TEACHING *ACTUAL*
> VIEWS OF SHANKARA!!!

And if so, I'd appreciate if you could help me see if this is your
personal opinion or is it a considered SSS's viewpoint (too)? For the
latter, I'd be glad if any SSS follower could clarify this for my
benefit.

Thanks much,
--praveen
