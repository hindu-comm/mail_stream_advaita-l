I have been reading and watching from the side line so far. I am a beginner and do not know
much about SSS or any body. I did learn quite a bit from the dialogs.  But this 
so called "Insults" and "Personal attack" comments are really funny. 

We are discussing about "Misconception of this whole physical world in Advaita". 
Can we say "Shankara is insulting our intelligence?"
Against this it is trivial to say "You mis-understood or quoted out of context".
If this is taken as an insult, may be preaching/discussing Advaita is meaningless.

There is a saying "Even elephants can slip", to mean that Any body can make a mistake. 

There is a story that even Sankara did make a mistake when he asked a low caste person to
get out of his way.

I really enjoy the erudite writings of Rama and appreciate his deep understanding and passion
of Advaita and Sankara's teachings.

But this personal attack thing is at best laughable.

Pranam
