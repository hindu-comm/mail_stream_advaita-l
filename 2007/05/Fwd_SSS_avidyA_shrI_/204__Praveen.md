praNAm all,

namaste Yadu-ji,

Here's a thought: I think *questioning* the guru, seemingly
contradictory, to understand the teaching better is more of *opening
the door*. Guru-droha would be *arguing* against it to *override* the
teaching.

Just to lighten the moment, I recall a statement (hopefully properly)
from western philosophy in this context. Plato seems to have said
about his disciple Aristotle that the latter is "like a calf that
kicks its mother after sucking her dry of her milk".

Thanks,
--praveen
