Thanks for this series of mails. You are indeed right that there is no
*published* refutation of SSS by shriisannidhanam. However, I know
that he doesn't consider SSS to have interpreted shankara correctly.
This was stated by him in a conversation to a very reliable source. I
usually am careful with second-hand information, but I am very, very
sure about the reliability of this source. Actually, this is what
prompted me to take a second, more thoughtful look at SSS's writings.

Of course, as you explained, the foreword I quoted from your mail,
explicitly goes against SSS's contentions anyway. A rose by any other
name, etc.
