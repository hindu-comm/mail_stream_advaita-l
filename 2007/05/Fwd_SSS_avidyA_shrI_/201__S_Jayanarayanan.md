I would modify the above statement as:

"In the Vedic tradition, it is indeed an unpardonable sin to argue
against ***the core of*** one's Guru's teachings after accepting the
Guru as an authority and learning respectfully from him."

As a matter of fact, Sureshvara has argued against some specific
points in Sankara's teachings (with relevant quotes from
Sruti/Smriti), but never against the Guru's core teachings. OTOH, SSS
has dismissed the very core of practically the entire post-Sankaran
tradition as nonsense, so there's a gulf of difference between the
two.

This is significant, because SSS himself derives his lineage to
Sankara from the post-Sankaran Gurus!
