I have been observing how certain people resort to personal attacks under 
the garb of showing respect. Instead of "flaming", familiar to discussion 
group members, which is openly hostile and insulting, this trick of masking 
the personal attack with apparent respect, conveyed by words such as 
praNAms, prubhuji, etc., has been perfected by some.

There is an exact oppposite technique used in Sanskrit literature called the 
nindA-stuti. Here, often God or an indifferent lover, is subjected to 
nindA-stuti. On the surface, the words indicate censure (nindA), but the 
deeper meaning is actually a prayer or praise (stuti).

However, some in this list prefer to use "stuti-nindA."
