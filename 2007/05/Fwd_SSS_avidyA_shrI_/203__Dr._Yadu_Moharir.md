Namste Kartik-Ji:


  Does adavita support views regarding "gurudroha"?

  guru is supposed to open the does for learning and not tie him (disciple) down to himself?

  Thank you, 

  Dr. Yadu

Actually, I would dispute that -- in the Vedic tradition, it is
indeed an unpardonable sin to argue against one's Guru's teachings
after accepting the Guru as an authority and learning respectfully
from him. Kumarila Bhatta, after learning the doctrine of the
Bauddhas and arguing against it, consumed himself by fire because he
believed that he would be setting a bad example for others in the
Vedic tradition to commit Guru-droha.

Kartik
