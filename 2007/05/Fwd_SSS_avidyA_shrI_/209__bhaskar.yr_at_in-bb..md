Is that right?

Let us compare what HH Bharati Tirtha and Appayya Dikshita have said
with what you have maintained.

praNAms Sri Karthik prabhuji
Hare Krishna

Can we come out of this type of debates atleast in future??  you know I can
reply with my version of thoughts  to your accusations & I too know, in
turn you'll come up with your own version of reply :-))  Both of us,
atleast at somepoint of time should realize that this is going to be a
never ending story....From my side, for the time being, I've realized the
futility behind these type of discussions...If you are still interested to
continue,  pls. let me know,  let us continue this *discussion* off the
list.  I've said whatever I felt in my previous mail...if you need further
discussion on that and if you want to share the *knowledge* of these
discussions with the members of this list, we may have to take the
permission from  list moderators to carry out these discussion on the
board!!! .  Choice is yours prabhuji.  But if you ask me, it is the high
time to channelize our discussion more towards philosophy rather than
philosophers!!!... And I earnestly think you have plenty of philosophy in
stock to share with this forum...As you know, you still owe an explanation
with regard to first brAhmaNa & second brAhmaNa in bruhadAraNyaka maNtra
(3.5.1). Prabhuji, I think you still remember the *pot holes* that you've
pointed out in my observations which are still empty & desparately in need
of shankara bhAshya vAkya amruta dhAra....Hope you would fill it with that
nector very shortly :-))

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
