Or maybe Bhaskar was just being polite did you consider that?  Quite 
frankly the peevishness and lack of vinaya of those who claim to be 
defending Advaita siddhanta seems more of an "outright insult" than the 
use of salutations.

It's a shame. We moderators shouldn't have to take drastic steps, but 
posters will be banned unless they can learn to express their views with 
civility.  Vigor and resolve are fine.  Personal attacks are not.
