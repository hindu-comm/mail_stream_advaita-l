That being the case, would you care to explain how your assumptions are
valid as per Sruti or SA~Nkara bhAshya?

praNAms Sri Siva Senani Nori prabhuji
Hare Krishna

Pardon my ignorance...I am not able to get the intent of your mail...Kindly
let me know, in my mail, which are the assumptions on my part without
proper supportings from shankara bhAshya ...As far as my knowledge goes I
have appropriately quoted shankara bhAshya vAkya references in support of
Sri SSS's interpretation of nature of avidyA (from adhyAsa, sUtra, gIta,
taitirIya bhAshya).  Kindly note that my mail is not a rebuttal of any
paper. Please also note that since the *rules* dictated by author of Paper
on SSS is not acceptable to me, there is no question of any refutation of
it. Hence I have drafted my understanding of avidyA under a different
subject heading...I might have used some terminologies used in Paper on
SSS...but that does not anyway mean that I am after that!!!  If you find
anything in contradiction to lOkAnubhava / bhAshya vAkya or if you have any
specific problem with my mail,  kindly let me know, I'd definitely try to
explain it to the best of my ability.  IMHO, there is no point in comparing
my mail with Paper on SSS...As you know the intention behind these two
efforts are entirely different.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
