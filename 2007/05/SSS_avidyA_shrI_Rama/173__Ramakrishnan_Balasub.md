BTW, you are under some illusion that later advaitins held that there
are more than 2 categories - the real and unreal. That is quite
incorrect. The point is what is the *mechanism* that causes the
superimposition of the two, is that epistemic, ontic or neither? SSS
has staked out his postion clearly - it is epistemic.

Again, please, please, please do not drag later advaitins or theri
descriptions into this discussion. The paper is about SSS's
interpretation, and whether it offers a *consistent* philosophy. This
is completely uncorrelated with what my opinions on later advaitins
are. Think about that for a minute.
