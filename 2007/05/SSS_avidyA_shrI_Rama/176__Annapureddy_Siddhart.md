praNAm shrI Jayanarayanan,

I did read the quotes. But given the lack of context for those quotes,
I could not conclude much from them. And I have come across enough
instances in literature where statements taken at face value
contradict each other, but samanvaya sets them in the proper context
and brings out a coherent opinion of the author. And I feel the same
could be true with SSS. If he made two apparently contradictory
statements, I would try and find out what he intended, before
concluding that his philosophy is incoherent.

I understand that my argument goes against SSS (if he did hold the
position you ascribe to him). But I have also noted that for a person
who lived almost 90 years (?), engaging a number of scholars in
debate, it is surprising that he did not have a position on this third
ontological category (which makes me feel he never intended a third
ontological category in the first place). Or maybe he did have a
position on this third ontological category, in which case I would be
interested in knowing more about it.

As I ventured to say in my mail to shrI Ramakrishnan, one reason could
be imprecise use of language (presumably).

praNAm.

A.Siddhartha.
