I think you missed out reading page 5 of Rama's paper, where SSS
himself is quoted as saying in one of his own works (direct English
quote - not a translation!):

"AvidyA is subjective and has been explained by Sankara as the
natural tendency of the mind to superimpose the self and the not-self
on each other."

The reference is given as page 9 of:

[7] Svami Satchidanandendra Sarasvati. Misconceptions About Sankara.
Adhyatma Prakasha Karyalaya, Hoelenarsipur, Hassan Dist., Karnataka,
India - 573211, 1995.


You really need to read Rama's full paper before concluding that he
has done anything less than a thorough job!

You have just argued against the theory that "the mind does the
superimposition of the Self and not-Self on each other".

If so, your arguments are targeted precisely ***against*** SSS, who
held such a false theory!

That is then another point against SSS: why did he say at one point
that the mind does the superimposition of the Self and not-Self, and
at another say that the mind itself is part of the not-Self?
