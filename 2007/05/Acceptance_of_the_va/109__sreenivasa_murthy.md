From: H.N.Sreenivasa Murthy
  Pranams to all.

  Dear Sri Vidyasankar Sundareshan,

          The meaning of the words, Anubhava / sArvatrikapUrNAnuBava have been given in Mantra 2-5-15 of Brihadaranyaka Upanishad which reads as follows:

         tadEtadbrahmApUrvamanaparamanantnaramabAhyamayamAtmA brahma
         sarvAnuBUrityanuSAsanam ||
     The word "sarvAnuBUH" gives the meaning of anubhava/sArvatrikapUrNAnuBava.

  Sri Shankara, In Upadeshasahasri  slokas 18-195, 18-210 and 12-8, has clearly
  defined and explained the meaning.

  HH SSS, in his work "Mandukya-rahasya-vivritiH"  states:

  anuBavaSabdEna cAtra na pAtaMjalAditantrAntarIyayOgajasamAdhijanyastapOmantrAdisiddhijanyO vA

  In other words anubhava/sArvatrikapUrNAnuBava is none other than  
  Brahman/Atman/ Self/ one's True Svaroopa whose charecteristics are :
  svataHsiddha, svayaMjyOtiH,  hEyOpAdEyarahitaH, AvirBAvatirOBAvavarjitaH,
  kUTasthanityacaitanyasvarUpaH, hAnOpAdAnarahitaH, . 

  My understanading is based upon the  above quoted passages and the teaching of my Revered Guru.

  I do not  have the required command over English language to translate the above Sanskrit words and passages into English language. I may please be excused  for not  providing  the translation. Experts in the field are requested to
  provide the necessary English translation for the benefit of readers who are not conversant with Sanskrit and I will be much obliged for the help rendered. 

  With warm and respectful regards,
  Sreenivasa Murthy.
