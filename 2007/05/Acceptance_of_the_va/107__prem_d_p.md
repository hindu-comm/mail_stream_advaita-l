namaste...

  dear sri anbu sivam,

  that was a brilliant observation.

  to me there is nothing called 'blind faith', it is almost a contradiction in terms.
  because, to continue with the analogy, the 'blind' can have no faith in 'light' !
  even when we think that we do not know, we do know, we are children of light, 
  the rightful heirs to all knowledge. the light is in our own hearts, and by faith
  what we mean is the distant light which percolates down to the very roots of our 
  mundane existence, 'fitting like a hand in the glove'. this distant light to me is
  the sruti. and this is how, as sri murthy says, sruti is a 'matter of fact' and not
  so much a mere matter of 'faith', even for an ajnani.

  pranam.

  ...prem

  Dear Abhilash Shatryji,

Suppose Sri Srinivasa Murthyji says 'yes' to your querry, would you believe
him? If not it becomes clear you do not believe him even before you wrote
him the question. If the answer is yes, of course, your question was
superfluous!

Regards,
Anbu
