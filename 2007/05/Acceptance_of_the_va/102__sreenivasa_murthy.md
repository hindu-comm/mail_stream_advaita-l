From: H.N.Sreenivasa Murthy
  Pranams to all.

  Dear Sri Siva Senani Nori,

        Three quotations from Sri Shankara  in respect of the above mentioned subject:
          A]  yathABUtArthavAditvAt vEdasya || 
                  [Brihadaranyaka Upanishad: 1-4-10]
          B]  na hi vacanaM vastunO6nyathAkaraNE vyApriyatE |
                kiM tarhi yathABUtArthAvadyOtanE ||
                 [Prashna Upanishad: 6-2]
          C] j~JApakaM hi SAstraM na kArakaM iti sthitiH ||
                 [Brihadaranyaka Upanishad : 1-4-10]

         The above quotations emphasize the fact that Sruti reminds us of certain actual facts WHICH WE ARE NOT AWARE OF. Question of faith/belief does not come into the picture at all as it deals with existing facts. Only thing needed is that those facts which Sruti reveals, facts concerning YOU and YOU ALONE are to be cognized within yourself by adopting methodoligies as prescribed by Sruti only.

  With warm and respectful regards,
  Sreenivasa murthy.
