No argument that Sruti plays the most important role
in advaita vedanta. 
The reason Sruti is important is because it removes
the adhyAsa/avidya to reveal the ever known brahman,
not because it presents a previously-unknown brahman.

I don't understand why Pure Consciousness can't be
deduced or inferred from the deep-sleep experience. I
agree its a hypothesis, until it is understood
intellectually and becomes paroksha jnAna.

Yes, sleep from the jIva perspective is
tAmasic/negative, meaning that its mano-laya not
mano-nAsha, but that's no reason to deny the blissful
experience of sushupti, which is none other than our
own swaroopa. TurIya is not a fourth state but the
substratum of the three - which would be available to
a man of knowledge at all times. 
What about - "api ca na kadAcit jIvasya brahmaNA
satsampattirnAsti. swaroopasyAnapAyitvAt.
svapnajAgaritayostUpAdhi saMparkavashAt pararUpApatti
mivApekshya tadupashamAtsushupte svarUpA
pattirvakshyate." Su Bh (3-2-7). This roughly states -
There is no time when the jIva is removed from
brahman, because his true nature can never really
desert him ever. But, giving concession to the fact
that due to his upAdhis in waking and dream states, he
has as though taken a different svarUpa there, we say
that he attains his true svarUpa in sushupti. That's
all. This is a good way to understand and reconcile
sruti vAkya "aham brahmAsmi". There is no point
arguing beyond this. I could go on quoting from
Satchidanandendra Saraswati Swamiji's Shankara
SiddhAnta pages 55 - 80, where he is specifically
talking this same issue.

In whose experience is the seed form of ignorance?
What is there to be ignorant of? I submit that this
seed ignorance can neither be deduced nor inferred.
How do you reconcile the above statement? You know
AdhyAsa bhAshya was specifically written by Sankara to
talk about avidya/adhyAsa, why there no mention of
this seed avidya there?

Savithri
