I understand that the Sankaracharyas of the four Amnaya Peethams- Dwaraka, Badarai, Puri and Sringeri are meeting in Bangalore over the coming week-end.

  As per my information the program is:

  19th May-Saturday   Sankaracharyas' will meet first at the Sringeri Shankar Mutt, Bangalore in Basavangudi

  20th May-Sunday  Sankaracharyas' will attend a gathering at Palace Grounds , Bangalore where a mass chanting of Soundarya Lahari will be conducted. It is expected that one lakh persons will join this mass chanting.

  I had read earlier that , a few months back, a similar mass chanting was held under the auspices of Vedanta Bharati.

  Does anyone have more information on this event of great significance?

  Two of Shankara's stotras have been uploaded to the advaita siddhi website. 
The first one is a favorite of mine, the LakshmI-narasimha Pancharatna. This 
small stotra has many gems hidden in it. Can you find them? I have found a 
few.

I had written the translation of this stotra a few years ago and posted it 
here. I have since updated it with more notes, including quotes from the 
BhAgavata, where PrahlAda, the Vaishnava par excellence, teaches his friends 
about Vishnu Bhakti.

The other stotra is the Shiva-aparAdha-KShamApaNa stotra, which Shankara 
has, obviously out of compassion, composed for the benefit of those of us 
who have committed an offense by not worshipping Shiva.
