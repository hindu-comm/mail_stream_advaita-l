As the person responsible for putting up files on the site let me comment on my 
criteria.  I am looking for information which will help sadhakas get a better 
understanding of Advaita Vedanta.  But placement of an article on the site does 
not equal 100% endorsement of its views  by the moderators or any math or 
sampradaya.  Remember essay comes from the French verb for "to try" and if it 
tries to be informative and accurate that is good enough for me.  I offered 
Ramakrishnan space to put up his paper because I felt it met the criteria 
mentioned above.  He chose to put it on his own site instead.

Btw, the same offer applies to followers of Swami Sacchidanandendra too. I 
noticed there doesn't seem to be much information available about him on the 
web.  Why don't you, Bhaskar, Stig and other followers prepare an introduction 
to his life and teachings?  I think it would make a fine edition to
advaita-vedanta.org
