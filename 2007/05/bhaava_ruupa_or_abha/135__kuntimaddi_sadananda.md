Shree Anand and Rama 

PraNAms to both of you.

Could you discuss based on your understanding of
advaita Vedanta as presented by Shankara and
post-shankara advaitic masters, whether avidyaa
belongs to bhaava ruupa or abhaava ruupa.  Bhagavan
Ramanuja  in Shree Bhaashhya criticizes extensively
the bhaavaruupa avidhya as basis for his mahaapuurva
paksha.  

Epistamalogically, how is the Ignorance should be
treated- as Bhaava ruupa or abhaavaruupa? 

Hari Om!
