praNAm all,

Assuming that an eligible seeker is the one who has followed (and
mastered) sAdhanA chAtushTaya. In which case, aren't all advaitins on
the same page w.r.t. moksha being instantaneous on hearing shruti
vAkya from a guru? Are there some advaitins who say that even for such
a seeker, practice and meditation is required?

Thanks much,
