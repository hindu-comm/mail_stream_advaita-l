But, you didn't answer my question - HOW?

NOW, we are going in circles, when you start repeating
my own words to me. 
If you care to answer, my question was, and I repeat
here - What is the role of "manana/nidhidhyAsana on
the sruti vAkyas" if it doesn't help internalizing
them?
Sure, this will be the last post on this topic.

Savithri
