Namaste Praveenji,

No, not all advaitins believe that moksha is
instantaneous even for a fully eligible (sAdhana
cAtushtaya sampanna) seeker. 

Not to open another can of worms, but since you ask,
there are those who believe that moksha can only be at
the fall of the body, i.e, when you attain knowledge,
your body falls off. Others believe that though a
person can live as a jivamukta, he still has some
avidya-lesha and that he can only achieve liberation
after death of the body. These people believe that
videha-mukti is the only form of liberation. And still
some others even believe that hearing the maha-vAkyas
are not enough, but they have to repeat the
maha-vAkyas to achieve liberation. 
So, I am not really sure how much these people
emphasize sAdana-cAtushtaya sampattih. Although they
may believe it's a pre-requisite for jnAna, they seem
to discount it a lot. 
This is what I have gathered from my readings, I can't
tell you any more about this.

Hope this helps,
Savithri
