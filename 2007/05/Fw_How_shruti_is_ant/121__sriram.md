Dear Members
I could see this mail only now.I think Faith in  the Sruthi means a positive
one that Its sayings are hundred percent true and following the same will
definitely lead to Liberation/moksham.A guru is required to understand the
sayings of the Sruthi  in the right manner.
Sri Sachidanendra Saraswathi Swamigal is attributed to have said that Sri
Adi Sankara had held the view that Anubhava also plays a part and that this
is more valid than the Sruthi.I think this debate appears to me as an
avoidable one as we all
know that Adi Sankara illuminated the Advaitha Siddhanta ONLY from the
Sruthi Vakyas and how one should read them and understand.Our logic may not
be sufficient to fully get at what exactly is meant by  the Sruthi when it
says Aham Brahmasmi,Tatvamasi,Aham Athma Brahma ,Prajnanam Brahmethi etc
.Sri Adi Sankara for our own benefit dwelton
these Maha Vakyas and gave His Bashyas on them  so that these are understood
in the
right manner.Those who seek mumukshathvam follow His Path.Anubhava is
one`s own self experience need not necessarily verifiable by others under
lab
conditions.The sadhaka   is content and he derives the benefit/satisfaction
by
following the Path shown by his Master .That is that. Mother only shows to
the child that so and so is its  father and the child accepts that.No
further examination of Dna and all that.Sruthi is called as Matha and it
shows that Brahman is verily cognisable.That is that.Sri Sengalipuram
Brahmasri Anantharama  Dikshithar always will say Veda  matha.
R.Krishnamoorthy.

the list; now Sri Bhaskar has replied to my response. I am reproducing the
whole thing for the convenience of members who might be interested, and also
summarising it for the majority who would not be interested that keenly.
>
> Summary: Sri Bhaskar wants to know if Sruti is a hypothesis, or an article
of faith (faith); whether we should blindly accept something like
'tattvamasi' or verify it (accept it and internalise it); the basis for
considering Sruti as antya-pramANa (it is axiomatic); and whether faith is
Sruti is essential to understand Sri Sankara's teachings (yes).

> He then clarifies that he did not say that one should verify Sruti out of
mistrust (I think he has), that SSS does not hold that "the vEdic
declaration would require subsequent verification by some other accepted
means of right knowledge" (fair enough) and that it is not Sri Bhaskar's
stand that "*after* reading & understanding  shruti we have to go to some
other place to do something else to realize its truth!!"
>
> The above led me to conclude that Sri Bhaskar and I agree on the fact that
the word of Vedas is final, does not require any further investigation or
verification. To me, it then follows that only SrutyanugrihIta tarka can be
used, not anubhavA~Nga tarka.

However, listening is not comprehending, and hence SravaNa has to be
followed up by manana and nidhidhyAsana; once the teaching of Sruti is
comprehended, the differences of agent, object, and action vanish.

well. Out of what motive do you then "investigate by actual perception  or
through some other means of knowledge" the cautioning of the Rishi that
there is a giant on the other side of the country? The answer is mistrust.
If you had trust in the Rishi, you would take it at face value. Say, our
father tells us that he has robbed of his wallet in the market. Do we then
investigate this, by say, asking mother whether she has seen father take the
wallet while going out, or checking the bank transactions to investigate and
know that the wallet contained the amount father claimed it contains, or do
we trust our father? A Rishi is like our father, and should be similarly
trusted.

does need verification by any other means, we are saying the same thing, and
have no difference of opinion. That also leads us to therefore accept only
SrutyanugrihIta tarka, and not anubhavA~Nga or anubhavAtmaka tarka in
brahma-jij~nAsA.

your phrase of "NOT ONLY shruti but anubhavAdayaH" does not refer to Vedas
but a way of understanding Vedas. And, anubhava and others are in addition
to "this technique of understanding vedas", not in addition to Vedas.
