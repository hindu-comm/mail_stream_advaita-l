Sri Bhaskar

praNAm.

Kindly pardon me I have never questioned the authority of scripture in
shankara vEdAnta.  My doubts are there with a genuine interest to know what
exactly does it mean when we say *shruti is the antya pramANa*....If I take
your words & say it is ONLY blind faith in scriptures just coz.

* Faith is belief that is not based on proof. If you are told something, and will believe it after proving it then such a thing is called a hypothesis. Or to paraphrase you, faith is by definition blind.

 it is our fore fathers collection of gems in their highest status.

* I guess speed-reading has its problems. I used the above phrase in a context which condemns that; it does not state my belief. 

  It leads to the
conclusion that shAstra has to be believed to be an authority just as we
put faith in the declarations of champions in that field..In other words,
that would imply the dependence of the scriptures on some other source of
right knowledge for its efficacy.  What does it mean??  if some Rishi
cautions us that there is a big giant on the other side of the country, the
truth of that statement either should have to be believed blindly or that
statement would have to be investigated by actual perception or through
some other means of knowledge

* In case of Apta-vAkya, we assume it is true, till we know better, but do not go about verifying out of mis-trust.

...If our case is former, then we are *blind
followers* of shruti, if our case is later, the vEdic declaration would
require subsequent verification by some other accepted means of right
knowledge!!! 

* This is the crux of the difference. I guess you would attribute the above stance to His Holiness Sri Satchidanenra Swami. *** SRUTI VAKYAS DO NOT *N*E*E*D* VERIFICATION BY OTHER MEANS *** (it is a different matter that they being the Truth are capable of being verified); other means like anubhava are also available to understand / interpret Sruti vakyas correctly with respect to Brahma-jij~nAsA, which is not the case with dharmajij~nAsA. The mere availability of other means does not make those means of understanding, more important than what is to be understood.

In that case it is not an antya pramANa. As said earlier,
after hearing the truth in scriptures, there is some work still pending to
verify truth behind this declaration....

* The Sruti is called antya pramANa precisely because no further "verification" is required. 

Anyway, thanks for your time & patience to answer my queries prabhuji.

* Sir, you are remarkably polite; I hope, I can be a tenth of that.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
