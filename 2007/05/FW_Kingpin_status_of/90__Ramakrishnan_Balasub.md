I already pointed out in my paper that this single quote alone was a
translation! This itself shows that as usual people are commenting
without reading. BTW, the choice the word kingpin has nothing to do
with the ideas. The point was *glossing over the fact of
shrutyaadayaH* and also comparing anubhava to pratyaxa and anumaana.
Hopefully you are not saying that in kannaDa pramaaNa means something
else than in Sanskrit?!! Further, this is his own kaaryaalaya which is
publishing the book as an authentic view of SSS. No problem I'll find
another quote and insert it. I have many equivalent quotes from SSSs
own books :-).
