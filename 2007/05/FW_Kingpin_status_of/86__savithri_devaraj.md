I am sorry, I don't understand this. 
It says the first edition came out in 1996. The talks
wers conducted by Swamiji in 1966 in Davanagere, he
wrote his book in Kannada after the series of 21
talks. The translator Mr.D.B.Gangolli translated and
published this in English in 1996 for the first time.

The earlier reference to this book said it was
authored by Swami Satchidanandendra Saraswati Swamiji,
It is important to note that it was translated to
English by a translator, the choice of quoted words
are not Swamiji's.

Thanks to Sri Shyam Subramanian for pointing to the
electronic version of the book.

Regards,
Savithri
