Dear Bhaskar,

What is the connection between section 6 and Gangollis book in the
Digital library? You just can't keep from personal attacks, can you?
No problem, I'll just ignore it and attribute it your basic training
by ISKCON :-). The joke is that I had asked the list-members not to
discuss section 6, and Bhaskar very kindly keeps bringing it up in
completely irrelevant contexts :-).

BTW, I use the book by Gangolli (not the biography) a single time in
the entire paper regarding anubhava. No problem, I'll find some
equivalent quote and push this to the foot-note section! Apparently we
have list-members who know SSS better than the kaaryalaya authorities.
Absolutely no problem at all, I can accommodate them :-).

Rama
