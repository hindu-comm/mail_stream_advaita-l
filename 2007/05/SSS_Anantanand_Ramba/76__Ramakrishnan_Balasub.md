One thing I forgot to mention. Prof Rambachan actually tries to
*devalue* the role of anubhava quite a lot in his paper and book,
unlike me. Also note that the Prof. is mainly combating views that
anubahava is some kind of mystical state, which is a modern
interpretation by Radhakrishnan and others.

A review of this book appeared in Philosophy East and West and Arvind
Sharma had critiqued the book. Interested readers may consult their
local library. Again, note that this book and my paper are *entirely*
orthogonal, and we address completely different things, and in this
sense the paper complements the book. I leave it to the advaita list
members to actually read the book and either confirm or refute my
assertion for themselves. Quite clearly, spin doctoring has begun to
quote random things out of context, and people are trying to gain
legitimacy by quoting a well known Professor.
