Who said the good Prof doesn't agree with my views, or vice-versa?
It's kinder-garten stuff that nirvikalpa-samaadhi does not take
precedence over shruti. This has been explicity stated by Vidyaranya,
among others and emphasized by many recent advaitins like
Mahaasannidhaanam. Why do all these people following SSS think that
only they know this?

BTW, why are you dragging Vacaspati here? First of all I don't think I
ever referred to Vacaspati Mishra in my paper (as any kind of
authority at least). So quoting the Profs paper because *you think* it
contradicts Vacaspati is of no use, and absolutely irrelevant. And
second, I am not interested in correcting your wrong ideas of what the
great Vacaspati said.

The problem is that you think Vacaspati said something, and that I
believe it. The fact is that Vacaspati never said what you think he
said. In any case, unless you can find something that the good Profs
paper being contradicted in my paper, the reference is useless. If you
do find something that he contradicts in my paper (I might have missed
it), let me know, and I'll think about it.

I already said that the good Professors study is somewhat
complementary to mine because we address slightly different topics.
