I would like to highlight a different nuance to the above discussion. Sruti 
sometimes speaks in hidden ways, which are not necessarily in conformity 
with regular human experience. In such instances, one looks for a 
metaphorical/allegorical interpretation, instead of the literal one. In 
other instances, the text in question gets characterized as "arthavAda", for 
the sake of praising a particular ritual action or the man who carries it 
out. To that extent, there is a "re-examination" of Sruti, but this is part 
of the effort to understand what the text intends, in that particular 
context. As far as brahmavidyA is concerned, the point that Sankara 
bhagavatpAda makes is that the texts teaching non-difference (abheda) are 
not to be interpreted in a merely metaphorical sense nor are they to be 
understood as arthavAda. Thus, "ayam AtmA brahma" is not merely a ritual 
identification of AtmA and brahma, nor is it a statement of metaphorical 
similarity, nor is it mere praise of the AtmA.

Again, one needs to be very careful here, to avoid logical inconsistencies. 
anubhava, in the end, also only reveals that one's own experience that one 
is brahman is in line with the knowledge revealed by Sruti. Where this 
anubhava helps is in strengthening the individual person's establishment in 
brahman knowledge; it does not add anything to take away from the knowledge 
revealed by Sruti. There is a crucially nuanced distinction involved here.

The take-home message from Sankara here is that Sruty-Adi and anubhava-Adi 
are routes for brahma-jijnAsA, i.e. investigating, understanding and knowing 
brahman. Otherwise, in the above formulation, we have a circularity with the 
Sruti part, inasmuch as Sruti (=veda) is being characterized as a technique 
for interpreting the veda (=Sruti). Also, in the final sentence, traditional 
advaita vedAnta would be more comfortable with a statement that what 
anubhava reveals is consonant with, or correlates with, or is in line with 
what Sruti teaches. Any statement about one reinforcing the other 
immediately gets mis-understood otherwise.

We need to be clear about the distinction between and also the overlap 
between an investigation into brahman and an exercise in interpreting Sruti. 
That is why advaita vedAnta does not enter into a conflict with pUrva 
mImAMsA as far as dharma-jijnAsA is concerned. Where pUrva mImAMsA is 
rejected is only in the field of brahma jijnAsA, which involves interpreting 
the jnAnakANDa.

Best regards,
Vidyasankar
