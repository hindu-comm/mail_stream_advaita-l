* So, strictly based on the above, are you willing to say Sruti is useless
for brahmajij~nAsA? The correct meaning of yato vaco... is that words
cannot described, not that Sruti does not reveal Brahman. Sruti indeed
reveals Brahman, and it indeed is the way of knowing Brahman.

praNAms Sri Siva Senani Nori prabhuji
Hare Krishna

I've written somany mails today, this is my last & short one...Kindly note
that brahman is ultimately *apramEya*.  pramANa-pramEya vyavahAra
presupposes pramAtru....vEdAnta questions the very existence of
pramAtru...the shAstra does not specifically reveal Atman as its
object....The shAstra only aims at the removal of distinctions conceived by
ignorance....The shAstra is to be considered as a valid means of knowledge
only to this extent...says shankara in tattusamanvayAt adhikaraNa in sUtra
bhAshya.  Shankara further clarifies that it is well known fact the Atman
is not an adventitious thing for any one of us since it is self-evident.
One's own self is not to be ascertained for one-self by some means of
knowledge, means of knowledge are there for only  ascertainment of unknown
external objects ... Whereas the Atman is a self established ever existing
entity which should be there  prior to the very idea of objects and means
of knowing them...Hence, kEnOpanishad says he is beyond vidita & avidita...

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
