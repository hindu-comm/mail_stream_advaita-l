Needless to say, the stuff below is recognized by every vedantin after
shankara. And this is also a big "criticism" of the advaita by other
schools, that the veda is ultimately unreal in the advaita school. So,
this is really something everyone, not just advaitins, know already,
and hence not addressed in the paper. I presume the extract below has
nothing to do with my paper. If it does, please let me know if
anything in the paper conradicts this.
