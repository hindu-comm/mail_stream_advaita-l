Two of Shankara's stotras have been uploaded to the advaita siddhi website. 
The first one is a favorite of mine, the LakshmI-narasimha Pancharatna. This 
small stotra has many gems hidden in it. Can you find them? I have found a 
few.

I had written the translation of this stotra a few years ago and posted it 
here. I have since updated it with more notes, including quotes from the 
BhAgavata, where PrahlAda, the Vaishnava par excellence, teaches his friends 
about Vishnu Bhakti.

The other stotra is the Shiva-aparAdha-KShamApaNa stotra, which Shankara 
has, obviously out of compassion, composed for the benefit of those of us 
who have committed an offense by not worshipping Shiva.
