Namaste Sri Raghavendra,

Perhaps the Vedanta Paribhasa of Dharmaraja Adhvarindra may me of help
to you.

Subject: [Advaita-l] pramANas for Advaita: which work defined them first
?

sarvebhyo namaH,

I have read in non-Samskrit books that the pramANAni
for advaita as five or six which are pratyakSha,
anumAna, shabda, arthApatti, upamAna (and
anupalabdhi). For dvaita darshana, for example, it
seems that the pramANas are only the first three. 

My question is which work and by whom was it decided
that these are the pramANas? Specifically, does
AchArya discuss pramANAni in these specific terms
anywhere? I would appreciate it if someone could show
me any bhAShya/prakaraNa grantha specific references.
If not, which work discusses it in detail? 

dhanyavAdAH,
-rAghavendraH
