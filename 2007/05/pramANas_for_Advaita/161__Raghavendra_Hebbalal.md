namaste kathirasan-mahodaya,

Thank you for the reply. 

I had heard of this work before and thought that this would be one of those where pramANas would be discussed.

Now I have a follow up question.

Is that the first work where the pramANas were formulated like this? Is there any old (er) work which relates these terms to shAnkara-bhAShyas and shows that these pramANas are the only ones used and none else? 

dhanyavAdAH,
-rAghavendraH

Namaste Sri Raghavendra,

Perhaps the Vedanta Paribhasa of Dharmaraja Adhvarindra may me of help
to you. 

Warmest Regards,

sarvebhyo namaH,

I have read in non-Samskrit books that the pramANAni
for advaita as five or six which are pratyakSha,
anumAna, shabda, arthApatti, upamAna (and
anupalabdhi). For dvaita darshana, for example, it
seems that the pramANas are only the first three. 

My question is which work and by whom was it decided
that these are the pramANas? Specifically, does
AchArya discuss pramANAni in these specific terms
anywhere? I would appreciate it if someone could show
me any bhAShya/prakaraNa grantha specific references.
If not, which work discusses it in detail? 

dhanyavAdAH,
-rAghavendraH
