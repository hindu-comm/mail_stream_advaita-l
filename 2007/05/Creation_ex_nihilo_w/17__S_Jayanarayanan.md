I CHALLENGE you to find me ONE instance of ANY advaita VedAnta
AchArya who has maintained any one of the following:

1)  abhAvarUpa (Cause) --> bhAvarUpa (Effect)

2)  abhAva (Cause) --> bhAva (Effect)

3)  asat (Cause) --> sat (Effect)


All of the above are variations on the theme of "Creation ex nihilo",
and are simply NOT ACCEPTED BY ADVAITINS.

Regards,
Kartik
