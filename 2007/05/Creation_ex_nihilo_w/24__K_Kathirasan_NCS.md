Namaste Sri Kartik,

I am a quite surprised that a sampradayavit like yourself requesting for
shruti pramana for avidya! :) Hopefully Brahma Sutra 1.1.3-4 convinces
you that the subject matter of Shruti is Brahman, not avidya, esp so in
the Nivrtti Marga. 

Warmest Regards,
Kathirasan K

Do you have support from Sruti, Smriti or Sankara's works for the
above claim?

Or is purely your own speculation -- if so, I'd like to see some
solid logical reasoning behind it!

I would agree if it comes with concrete support from either Sruti or
Reason -- but preferably both.

Thanks,
Kartik
