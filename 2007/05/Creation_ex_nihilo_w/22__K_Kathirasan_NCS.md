Namaste Sri Kartik,

What if erroneous knowledge is due to absence of knowledge? Would you
agree? 

Warmest Regards,
Kathirasan K

In case you are unaware of what Causation is:

CAUSATION MUST INVOLVE CHANGE.

In your above example, what is the CHANGE involved? Let us see:

Ignorance (Absence of Knowledge) -> Ignorance (Absence of Knowledge)

Note that there is NO CHANGE INVOLVED IN YOUR EXAMPLE. HENCE THERE IS
NO CAUSATION.

Again, note that Anand's example is different from yours, principally
because he took into account Ignorance as not merely Absence of
Knowledge, but PRESENCE OF ERRONEOUS COGNITION. In other words,
Ignorance can come in two forms:

Ignorance = Absence of Knowledge (CANNOT BE A CAUSE)

Ignorance = Presence of Erroneous Cognition (CAN BE A CAUSE)

It is the second kind of Ignorance that can be considered a CAUSE for
Perception of the World.

Regards,
Kartik
