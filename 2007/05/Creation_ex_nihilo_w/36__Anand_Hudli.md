By orthodox I meant the six schools of philosophy (ShaD-darshanas) - nyAya, 
vaisheShika, mImAMsA, vedAnta, sAnkhya, and yoga. I should have realized 
that using the word "orthodox" in the context of mUlAvidyA discussion is 
risky and would invite trouble!

Even the followers of the vivaraNa school say that the mUlAvidyA is only 
mithyA. Remember PadmapAda clearly says that adhyAsa is mithyAjnAna-nimitta, 
ie. adhyAsa is caused by ignorance which is both unreal, mithyA (actually 
anirvachanIya) and ajnAna, the insentient avidyA shakti. So there is no such 
a thing like an existent mUlAvidyA that "rests in Brahman" which is what I 
have heard repeated on this list even after clarification. Besides, 
PadmapAda and his followers have the support of the shruti, (see the last 
article on the vivaraNa).

Anand
