Actually, it is not Anand, but his opponents who claim that the
Hare's horns are real, but the hare on which it rests is unreal! This
is the essence of the ABSURD claim:

  Non-Existent Cause --> Existent Effect


Please feel free to keep the above claim as a personal gem, but to
pass that Cacophony off as advaita VedAnta -- WITH SUPPORT IN NEITHER
LOGIC NOR SRUTI NOR EVEN SANKARA'S WORKS -- is inexcusable!
