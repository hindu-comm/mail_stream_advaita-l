Let me illustrate this. Suppose you buy your first DVD recorder and you
find yourself not knowing how to operate it. What would you attribute
the ignorance to? Would it be something in your head that obstructs you
from knowing how to operate it or is it the absence of the 'operating
knowledge' of the DVD Recorder? The ABSENCE of the 'operating knowledge'
caused an EXISTENT effect of not knowing what buttons to press. Quite
simple right? Do we REALLY need shabda pramana to come and rescue us
from this simple issue?

Thanks a lot for clarifying the complicated issue with a simple
analogy...this is what is required (lOkAnubhava) in understanding the
simple truth behind the complicated jugglery of words!!  If I extend this
analogy to the vEdAntic adhyAsa, the non-dual nature of ours is
misunderstood naturally by the human mind such as I am saMsAri, I am
father, I am mother, I am tall, I am drarf etc. etc. This misunderstanding
which pertains to the mind is called adhyAsa.  And due to this adhyAsa he
assumes brahman as world (just like looking the snake instead of rope)
this assumption is called adhyArOpa and the world is adhyArOpita.  This is
also called loukika/lOka saMvrutti in gaudapAda kArika.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
