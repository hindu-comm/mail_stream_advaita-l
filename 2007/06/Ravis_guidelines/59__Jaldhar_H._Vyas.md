I don't think this is a valid analogy.  First of all the recent lengthy 
arguments were about the nature of _advaita_ siddhanta.  There is nothing 
wrong with enquiry--even loud, boisterous enquiry--on this topic. 
Secondly, the advaitin never quarrels with anyone means that he should not 
argue just to say "I'm better than you." But he can and should critique 
dvaita in all its forms from the advaita viewpoint.  In fact 
Gaudapadacharya repeatedly does exactly this.

The moderators had to put their foot down because the arguments were 
devolving into personal attacks not because they were arguments per se. 
Personally I may have been slow to respond because I felt there was some 
light in all the heat.
