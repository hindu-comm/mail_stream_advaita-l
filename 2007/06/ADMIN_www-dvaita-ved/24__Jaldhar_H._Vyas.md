A few days ago the computer that hosts advaita-vedanta.org started 
displaying some problems.  The web server went down (though as you may 
have noticed the list itself did not.) and I was unable to 
login to restart it.  Today I got my ISP to reboot the machine to fix 
these problems but when it came back up the entire file system got 
trashed.  Luckily the most resent backup was only 5 days old so not a lot 
of harm was done.  I've spent much of today cleaning things up and we 
should be back to normal now.

I'm too tired to do anything else now but I'll start dealing with pending 
list business from tomorrow.
