Dear Sundaresan and all,

Pranams & Sri Gurubyo Namaha.

I am very glad to see Shri Michael Coman's article/books being  
discussed in length here.  He is being referred to as Sri  
Vasudevacharya here in Sydney.  He is doing enormous service to all  
asthikas here in Australia by taking so many weekly classes in Gita,  
Upanishads & Sanskrit classes.  I am very fortunate as one of his  
students to be attending his classes every other week.

You can reach him on http://www.srivasudevacharya.com/
