sarbebhyo namaH |

To my yesterday's thanks to the answers sent to me by SrI Sreenivasa Murthy
and SrI Ramesh Krishnamurthy I now wish to express also my deepest thanks to
SrI Siva Senani Nori for his remarkable contribution. I must confess that in
all my translations I tend to be a "maniac" of etymology an always tend to
trace a word to its "root", which is often quite illuminating; and for us
Westerners, it is also quite attention-grabbing to see how a Sanskrit word
or root has reached us in our languages - e.g. Hari, root hR^i has reached
us in the Latin "cardia", French "coeur", English "heart", German "Herz",
and I can tell you this was very striking for my audience when I was
delivering lectures in Paris 35 years ago.
If I may be allowed to add a personal comment, it is highly comforting to
read in the list a contribution of the high quality of SrI Senani instead of
the by far too usual vain debates in which some members seem to forget the
teaching of the Maa. Kaa. 2.24: "vaada iti vaadavidaH - Disputers identify 
It
with disputation" - a statement that comes as a comment on (or answer to) 
the
two shloka-s:
anishchitaa yathaa rajjurandhakaare vikalpitaa 
|sarpadhaaraadibhirbhaavaistadvadaatmaa vikalpitaH || 17||nishchitaayaaM 
yathaa rajjvaaM vikalpo vinivartate |rajjureveti chaadvaitaM 
tadvadaatmavinishchayaH || 18||and after which starts a lonng list of false 
"identifications":praaNaadibhiranantaishcha bhaavairetairvikalpitaH 
|maayaishhaa tasya devasya yayaa sammohitaH svayam.h || 19||17. Just as in 
the dark a rope whose nature has not been fully ascertained is imagined to 
be various different things such as a snake, a line of water and so forth; 
in exactly the same way the Self is imagined in various different ways.18. 
When the rope is realized to be a rope, all illusions about it cease, and 
only the rope remains. Realization of the Self is just the same.19. It is 
imagined to be (identical with) Praana {the life force} or other eternal 
realities.This is the Maayaa of the Divine One, by which He Himself is 
deluded. Thus, based on 2.24I understand that "vaada is only an illusion" 
according to SrI GauDapAdAcArya.praNAm-sGuy

bahuvrihi compound of the word dharma - by saying that which has some > 
dharma - attribute - is dharmah, that is a jiva.>> This paradox resolves 
itself when we see that GuaDapAdAchArya is using > Buddhist terminology to 
disprove the thesis of the Buddhist nihilists; > since the usage is 
Buddhist, the vyutpatti contradicts the siddhanta of > advaita and so Sri 
Sankara ignores the vyutpatti and merely says "AtmAkhya > dharmah" (that 
dharma which is called Atma - gloss on 4-81).>> The above thesis needs proof 
of the following:> 1. The usage is same as the Buddhist usage - first show 
what the sense is, > and then show that it is the same as used by 
Buddhists.> 2. alAtaSAntiprakaraNa's object is to refute the Buddhist 
nihilists> 3. Circumstantial evidence in support - that other scholars 
studiously > avoid this sense of the word dharma while analysing the word 
because of > this complication.>> With the hope that the extended length of 
this post would be tolerated, > here is the proof:>> 1. In addition to the 
twelve kArikas quoted by Sri Guy Werlings, the word > dharma is used in 
twelve other kArikas as well (2-25, 3-1, 4-1, 4-6, 4-8, > 4-10, 4-21, 4-33, 
4-41, 4-46, 4-54, 4-97). Out of these twenty four > instances, in one 
instance (2-25) it means the vedic rites as used by the > purvamImAmsA 
school; out of the twenty three other occasions, in 17 it > means self / 
atman / jiva, in five (4-21, 4-33, 4-41, 4-54, 4-82) means > some kind of an 
element (with an elephant being cited as an example by Sri > Sankara in 
4-41), and in one kArika (4-99), it occurs twice meaning > "element" in the 
first half, and the self in the second half. The > explanations given by Sri 
Sankara include 'Atman', 'bAhyadharma' [as > opposed to cit] (4-54), 
'vishayAntaram' (4-99, 1st half), dvaitavastu > (4-82) and hastyAdIn (4-41). 
>From a holistic analysis of the fourth > prakarana it emerges that the word 
dharmah is intended to mean, a vastu, > padArtha or vishaya, or an element 
in general, and the Atman in > particular. Compare this with one of the 
Buddhist usages (p5, P. V. Kane, > History of Dharmasastra, Vol I, Part I): 
"Another meaning of dharma > peculiar to the Buddhist system is 'an element 
of existence', i.e. of > matter, mind and forces". Mahamopadhyaya P. V. Kane 
gave five references > in support of the above. This definition of "an 
element of existence" fits > the usage in the alAtaSAntiprakaraNa like a 
glove, so much so that Sri > GauDapAdAchAya uses dharma in the place of 
bhAva - precisely 'an element > of existence'. Karikas 4-6 and 3-20 are 
exactly identical except the > "bhava" in the advaita prakarana (the third 
one) is replaced by dharma is > 4-6 and Sri Sankara does not offer any 
remarks on 4-6 merely observing > that the karika has already been 
commentated on.>> 2. In the introduction to the fourth chapter, Sri Sankara 
says that the > siddhanta was established in the three previous chapters and 
now in this > fourth chapter the views of the dualists and the [Buddhist] 
nihilists are > refuted and indicates that, to that purpose, some material 
is repeated. > Indeed quite a few kArikas are repeated in the fourth

is that except in > 3-1, the usage of the word to mean ' an element of 
existence' or self is > restricted to the fourth chapter alone; and there

not used in the sense of > self or an element of existence, and an attempt 
is made here to use the > word in that sense - in other words, use the

puzzling aspect of Sri Guy Werlings question was that Dharma > is a much 
analysed word. The first example to illustrate the difficulty of > 
translation is 'dharma'; the sense it takes is a long list - and yet, this > 
sense of 'an element of existence' is not usually given. I first checked > 
MM Sri P. V. Kane's seminal History of Dharmasastra (in a long discussion, > 
a single line refers to this usage at the end). While he counts the number > 
of times the word occurs in the Rig Veda samhita (53), and mentions that > 
it occurs hundreds of times in the Brahmanas, Aranyakas and the > 
Upanishads, and even mentions the unusual usage (to mean 'apurva' as used > 
by the purva-mimamsakas in Br. U. 2-5-11), he ignores the two usages > 
mentioned by Sri Srinivasa Murthy on the list (KaTha Upanishad, 1-1-21 and > 
2-1-14) where "dharma" means jivas. In his commentary on kaTha 1-1-21, Sri > 
Sankara does not give the etymological derivation, but simply says > 
'dharmAkhya Atman', (the Atman called as dharma). Coming back to Sri Kane > 
it is not as if he focuses on the dharmasastra and ignores the > 
Upanishads - as a Mahamahopadhyaya and a learned scholar it hardly needs > 
mentioning that he has a thorough mastery of the Upanishads. Actually, he > 
quotes quite profusely from the Upanishads and SA~Nkara bhAshya throughout > 
his extra-ordinary work, but he is quiet on the two kaTha references. In > 
fact these two, along with the Br. U. 2-5-11 are the only instances in the > 
entier corpus of the vedas, where the word dharma takes a sense not > 
mentioned in the long list of meanings usually given. Swami Harshananda of > 
Sri Ramakrishna Math in his small booklet on Dharma mentions all three. > 
The long list of meanings in Monier Williams does not include the present >

> 1. In addition to the twelve kArikas quoted by Sri Guy Werlings, the word 
> dharma is used in twelve other kArikas as well (2-25, 3-1, 4-1, 4-6, 4-8, 
> 4-10, 4-21, 4-33, 4-41, 4-46, 4-54, 4-97). Out of these twenty four 
> instances, in one instance (2-25) it means the vedic rites as used by the 
> purvamImAmsA school; out of the twenty three other occasions, in 17 it 
> means self / atman / jiva, in five (4-21, 4-33, 4-41, 4-54, 4-82) means 
> some kind of an element (with an elephant being cited as an example by Sri 
> Sankara in 4-41), and in one kArika (4-99), it occurs twice meaning 
> "element" in the first half, and the self in the second half. The 
> explanations given by Sri Sankara include 'Atman', 'bAhyadharma' [as 
> opposed to cit] (4-54),  'vishayAntaram' (4-99, 1st half), dvaitavastu 
> (4-82) and hastyAdIn (4-41). From a holistic analysis of the fourth 
> prakarana it emerges that the word dharmah is intended to mean, a vastu, 
> padArtha or vishaya, or an element in general, and the Atman in
> particular. Compare this with one of the Buddhist usages (p5, P. V. Kane, 
> History of Dharmasastra, Vol I, Part I): "Another meaning of dharma 
> peculiar to the Buddhist system is 'an element of existence', i.e. of 
> matter, mind and forces". Mahamopadhyaya P. V. Kane gave five references 
> in support of the above. This definition of "an element of existence" fits 
> the usage in the alAtaSAntiprakaraNa like a glove, so much so that Sri 
> GauDapAdAchAya uses dharma in the place of bhAva - precisely 'an element 
> of existence'. Karikas 4-6 and 3-20 are exactly identical except the 
> "bhava" in the advaita prakarana (the third one) is replaced by dharma is 
> 4-6 and Sri Sankara does not offer any remarks on 4-6 merely observing 
> that the karika has already been commentated on.
>
> 2. In the introduction to the fourth chapter, Sri Sankara says that the 
> siddhanta was established in the three previous chapters and now in this 
> fourth chapter the views of the dualists and the [Buddhist] nihilists are 
> refuted and indicates that, to that purpose, some material is repeated. 
> Indeed quite a few kArikas are repeated in the fourth chapter - and as we 
> have seen 3-20 has been reproduced after changing one word. Much of the 
> material in the chapter is a clear refutation of the nihilist view, and 
> 4-99 mentions Buddha explicitly "na etad Buddhena bhAshitam". From the 
> analysis of where the word is used, what is striking is that except in 
> 3-1, the usage of the word to mean ' an element of existence' or self is 
> restricted to the fourth chapter alone; and there earlier kArikas when 
> used are adapted to the specific terminology being used. Thus it is clear

> mentioned by Sri Srinivasa Murthy on the list (KaTha Upanishad, 1-1-21 and 
> 2-1-14) where "dharma" means jivas. In his commentary on kaTha 1-1-21, Sri

> on the two kaTha references. In fact these two, along with the Br. U. 
> 2-5-11 are the only instances in the entier corpus of the vedas, where the 
> word dharma takes a sense not mentioned in the long list of meanings
