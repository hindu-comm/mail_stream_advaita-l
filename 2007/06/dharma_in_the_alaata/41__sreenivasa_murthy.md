  Dear sri Guy Werlings,

          In the mantras 1-1-21 and 2-1-14 of the Katha Upanishd the word "Dharma" appears. It has been used in the sense of Atman and Jivas respectively. To know the correct import of that word, please read 
  Sri Shankara's commentaries on those mantras.

  With warm and respectful regards,
  Sreenivasa Murthy.
