Dear Sri Werlings,

The phrase "based on" in phrases such as "based on tarka" or "based on
anubhava" is extremely misleading. This is another place where the
English cannot directly substitute for the Sanskrit. In some sense,
the tarka is based on anubhava, because it uses anubhava. But the
justification for using it comes from shruti only. We can't experience
any tarka, so anubhava cannot justify any tarka. The situation is
similar to the pratyakSha and anumAna. anumAna is completely "based
on" pratyakSha, because you can't infer without observations. But it's
validity is not obtained *from* pratyakSha, it is indeed a
self-established means of knowing.

Rama
