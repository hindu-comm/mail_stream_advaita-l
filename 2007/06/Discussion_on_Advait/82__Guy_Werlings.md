As a fact, there is nothing to forgive. Here I may quote not from any 
vEdAnta text but from Mr Jack Crenshaw who wrote humorously but rather 
truly: "It seems patently obvious that being offended is a state of mind of 
the offendee, not the offender. I can make all my best efforts to keep from 
offending someone, but does this guarantee that they won't be offended? Of 
course not. In the end, I have no control over whether they are offended or 
not, because their state of mind is their state of mind, not mine. It's 
pretty obvious that someone who is determined to be offended can be so, 
regardless of how far we go to prevent it".
Let us forget about these previous discussions and be friends and brothers 
in the sanAtana dharma.
With warm and respectful regards,
Guy W.
