From: H.N.Sreenivasa Murthy

  Dear Sirs,
      One's own True nature  And Being (Sat) itself  is the GRACE OF GOD. It is Grace as well as God. There is only Grace as God Which is SELF ITSELF. It does not descend from above or given by  a God who is different from  THE SELF. 

  With warm and respectful regards,
  Sreenivasa Murthy
