Greetings.

I would like to make a humble suggestion to the
moderators of this group. 

Would it be possible for the topic summary to be
hyperlinked to the actual thread that runs below it ?
In this way, it is easy to click on the preferred
thread link and access it right away. As it stands
now, there is a need to scroll down all the other
threads to reach the desired one.

Rgds

Jai Simman,
Singapore.
