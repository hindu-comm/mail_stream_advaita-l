Dear Srii Ravi,

Apart from the reactions that came through the list to my second
posting as to your guidelines, I have received a direct mail from
shrii N. Srikanta requiring explanations and clarifications. Of course
I answered directly to him also, but I am sending you here below an
extract of my e-mail, which is not in a straight line connected with
his questions about my remarks on the guidelines.

shrii N. Srikanta had mentioned incidentally: "I have done
considerable research on the Mandukyopanishad and the Gaudapada
karikas". And in my answer to him I explained my own away frequenting
the Gau° Kaa° as follows:
"You mention that you have done considerable research on the Mandukyopanishad
and the Gaudapada karikas.
Although you probably do not care, I can tell you that I have been
doing approximately the same thing for the past 45 years, with a
difference on which you will perhaps not agree. As far as I am
concerned, I cannot say that I have been doing much "research" but as
per the recommendation of my vEdAnta teacher, I have been frequenting
daily the MANDUkya KArikA. My teacher considered that by studying a
Scripture or a philosophical text, you bring down the text to your own
present level of consciousness while by
frequenting (reading it aloud) every day, you bring up gradually your
level of consciousness to the level of the text, so that in the end
the real meaning of the text can flow out from the text into your
consciousness.
Accordingly I am proceeding as follows: on Mondays I am reading the
chapter 1, on Tuesdays chapter 2, on Wednesdays chapter 3 - and as the
chapter 4 is fairly long, I am splitting it into four parts of 25
shloka-s that I read respectively on Thursdays, Fridays, Saturdays and
Sundays. In this way, I am covering the full KArikA in one week. It is
only in case of needs that Iresort to a word for word translation or
to shrii shaN^kara bhAshhya".



Should you, dear shrii Ravi, find this kind of approach of any
interest at least to some members of the A-list, please do not
hesitate to include it into one of the next digests. But as already
said I want to stress again that I have not been committed by anybody
to "teach" anyone, and that this way of frequenting a text should by
no means be understood as a teaching of mine.
