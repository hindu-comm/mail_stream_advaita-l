I have read and understood the list policy and will abide by the same.

I am aged 39 and a native of Bangalore born in a smartha family and
presently living in Bangalore.

I am not educated in sanskrit. Thus, have little bit knowledge on basics of
Advaitha/Visishtaadvaitha and Dvaitha system of philosophy on reading books
of scholars in those systems in Kannada and English and thru internet.

Thanks
sukumar
