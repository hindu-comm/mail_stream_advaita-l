I would second Jaldhar's suggestion to try to translate well-known texts 
with the help of a dictionary and a grammar text book. Apte's collegiate 
Sanskrit-English dictionary will be good to start with for the vocabulary 
and any of the textbooks you are using will be good to help with the 
grammar. To the CBSE textbooks, I would add the Saral Sanskrit Sikshak set 
of textbooks from Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan.

Best regards,
Vidyasankar
