namaste...

  dear sri vidyasankarji and other list members,

  i would like to request you to kindly suggest the best way forward for
  a self-study of sanskrit. the purpose is primarily to be able to read
  our scriptures in general and shankara in particular, in original.

  i have practically no knowledge of the language but has a rather
  good familiarity with the vocabulary from my mother tongue and also
  quite at home with devanagari. 

  i have recently actually embarked on this self-study using the CBSE
  sanskrit textbooks and guides starting from Class V and working
  my way slowly up. Is this the best way?

  For your valuable suggestions please.

  pranam.

  ...prem
