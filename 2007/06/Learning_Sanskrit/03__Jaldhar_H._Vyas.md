That's certainly one way to do it.  However I think it is better to pick 
one work and translate it word by word with a dictionary and grammar at 
your side.  The Bhagavadgita or Hitopadesha are two good choices as the 
Sanskrit is fairly simple yet the subject matter is interesting.  I think 
this makes the inevitable memorization of vocabulary and syntax more fun 
and thus more likely to stick in the mind than the random passages and 
exercises found in the textbooks.
