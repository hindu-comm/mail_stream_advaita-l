1. Please restrict yourself to two messages per day.  If you
constantly violate this rule you will lose your posting privileges.

2. When the thread becomes controversial, please think twice before
posting to the thread. Ask yourself if this is really necessary. It is
not like ancient times, where a person who loses the debate changes
his position and follows the winner. Now a days, people simply stick
to their position no matter what. Hence, beyond a point,  debates
become meaningless.  To some extent they are useful in educating the
neutral readers.

3. Be polite and considerate in both your intent and words. This is
something all of us learning and let us all try our best.

With best wishes,

Ravi
