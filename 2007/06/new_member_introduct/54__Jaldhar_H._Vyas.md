Hello.  I am Polly Jacobs.  I am 36 years old.  I reside in Japan most
of the time, however I am from the USA.  I have studied yoga for many
years and have looked into various eastern schools of thought.  I am
drawn to / interested in the advaita vedanta tradition due to its
apparent clarity and lack of contradiciton.  So far I have only read
things here and there.  I would like to study more...

Thank you.
Polly
