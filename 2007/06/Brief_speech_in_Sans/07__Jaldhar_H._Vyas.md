Sanskrit ("perfected, systematized") differs from all Prakrit ("natural") 
languages in this way.  That's because Sanskrit is the only language 
until modern times where the grammar came first than the speech. If you 
speak ungrammatical English then you are just speaking bad English.  If 
you speak ungrammatical Sanskrit then you are not speaking Sanskrit at 
all.
