This leads to a very narrow definition of samskritam.
If not Kalidasa, what are the examples of pure Sanskrit literature?

It leads us to conclude with some certainly, that the grammars
available to us were preceeded by the spoken language.

Certainly, and such persons are to be commended for it. But too many
who might have otherwise been succesful, give up along the way.

Please do read some of the works of Sri Chamu Krishna Shastry. For
example, the article "sarala-samskritham katham" in the booklet
"idamittham". The reason is that it mentions such points as you have
above. However, one other expression, sprinkled liberally throughout
the article is "aarambha-stare". They're goal is not a-panini
samskritam, nor is it some diluted samskritam. They simply present a
staged approach to samskritam. Samskrita-Bharati, in recent times, has
been a party to reviving the ancient practice of "shalAkA-parIkShA-s"
