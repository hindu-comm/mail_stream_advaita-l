Namaste to all.

This is my first participatory act in the group discussion. I am astonished
to  see the high quality  of discussions . I was quite charmed by the
wonderful explanation  of Grace by Sri Prem and Sri Sadananda.As Sri Prem
has indicated , the Mumukshatwa is the link between the phenomenon and the
noumenon. The  impulse to be free is from the land of noumenon , manifesting
in the domain of phenomenality. The  explanation , the form ,  is later
given by the mind.

In the dream , if you see the dream of waking state  itself, it is obvious
that the origin is  not earthly , it is the divine itself. The dream  of
waking state itself , although coloured by the phenomenolity , is no less
important , just because it is coloured.It is the divine  calling you
towards him. In the Gita, the Lord  says, -------    Dadami Buddiyogam tam ,
yen mam upayanti te.

Here Buddhi given by the Lord  itself is the Grace of the Lord.

Sri Sadananda's  expression is  great  in terms of  today's language.I fully
agree with him.

Looking forward to   more scintillating  discussions.

Dilip Dhopavkar
