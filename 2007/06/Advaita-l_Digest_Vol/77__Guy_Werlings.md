Dear shrii Vidyasankar,



Thank you very much for your kind, rapid and precise answer as to 
anubhavAN^gaatvena.

I understand, however, that according to the Monier-Williams, aN^gatva means
n. a state of subordination or dependance, the being of secondary 
importance, the being unessential.

And this seems to me somewhat strange in the context. I had understood 
anubhavAN^gaatvena tarkaH as "reasoning based upon experience" - not 
"reasoning being of secondary importance to experience". Or should I 
understanding it as "reasoning depending upon experience"?

I should be very grateful to know what the true purport according to you is.

A "secondary question": in your anwer you mention aN^gatvena as the 
instrumental of aN^gatva,which I ought to know, but in the text in which I 
read the expression it seems to have been "anubhavAN^gaatvena" with a long a 
in Â°gaatvena - is this just a typo?
