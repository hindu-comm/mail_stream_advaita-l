Prof. Comans's paper is very important indeed, but I think it does not 
adequately address one key discussion of brahmAtmavidyA and citta vRtti 
nirodha (which, by the way, is the definition of yoga/samAdhi) in the 
bRhadAraNyaka bhAshya 1.4.7. We have discussed this particular topic on this 
list in the past. When our web-server is back up, I will search and send out 
links to the relevant posts in this regard.

Regards,
Vidyasankar
