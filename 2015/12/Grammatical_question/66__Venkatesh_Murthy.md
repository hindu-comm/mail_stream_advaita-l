 Namaste

I agree with you it is Bahuvrihi. Like महाधनम् is stand alone
Napumsaka Linga because Dhana is Napumsaka. It means a lot of wealth.
But when we say महाधनः पुरुषः  here Mahaadhana is adjective for
Purusha. Mahadhana must also become Pullinga. It means a Man having a
lot of wealth. When we say महाधना नारी the adjective is for Naaree in
Stri Linga. The adjective Mahadhana must also become Strilinga only.
It becomes Mahadhanaa Naaree. It means a Woman having a lot of wealth.

> In the third sentence: तदेतत् सत्यं यथाभूतं विद्याविषयम् ;

> एतत् सत्यम् कीदृशम्? यथाभूतम् । पुनः कीदृशम्? विद्याविषयम्.  [ विद्यायाः
> विषयं  यत् तत्   सत्यम् ] So, here too we have the anyapada paradhānatvam,
