No, its is the vyutpatti of the word viShaya.

I cannot see what is the problem in accepting Bahuvrihi Samasa with

The problem is that here viShaya = vastu, while you're making entire
compound = vastu. Even if you do insist that, viShaya will still be
pradhAna and Panian rules call that as tatpuruSha. You cannot call it
bahuvrIhi because uttarapada is pradhAna.
