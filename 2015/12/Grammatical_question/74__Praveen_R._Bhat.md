I meant that too, but only with reference to the compound,
karmaphalalakShaNam, not aparavidyAviShayam.

'Satyam' of the earlier Mundaka mantra (āpekṣikam) is in the domain of

Please mark your own words, "viShaya of aparavidyA. You yourself are using
ShaShThi tatpuruSha, since its the most befitting meaning and comes
naturally. :)

That satyam is visheShya and then vidheya also alright; there is no
disagreement there. However, the vivakSha changes. What you're saying, as
far as I can tell, is that the aparavidyAvishayam is karmaphalalakShaNam
satyam. I am saying that the karmaphalalakShaNam (hetu-garbha-viSheShaNa;
hetu for its being satyam) aparavidyAviShayam is ApekShikam (visheShaNa)
satyam. The background for this is that in two mantras, this one and
former, there were the words tat etat satyam, one w.r.t. aparavidyA and the
other w.r.t. paravidyA. Bhashyakara differentiates the former as ApekShika,
while the latter as pAramArthika.

I disagree. He clearly says that that the napuMsakatvam is due to the
vyutpatti used, while you are saying that the napuMsakatvam is due to
bahuvrIhi. Moreover, bahuvrIhi doesn't fit as per my understanding of the
context. Since tatpuruSha is inline with the TikA, Swami Paramarthananda
ji's explanation, Kailash ashram explanation and I think (I don't have the
book right now) Swami Gambhirananda ji's too, I have no clue as to why you
would like to see bahuvrIhi. I rest my case. Thank you.
