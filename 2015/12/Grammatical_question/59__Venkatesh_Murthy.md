Namaste

It may be Bahuvrihi Samasa and not Tatpurusha Samasa. Interesting
story is Rameshwara. Is it Tatpurusha or Bahuvrihi?
If Tatpurusha it is Ramasya Ishwaraha. If BahuVrihi it is Ramaha
Ishwaraha Yasya Sah. It can be Rama or Siva. Because Rama is always
worshipping Siva and Siva is always meditating on Rama.

Similarly Avidya Vishaya is Bahuvrihi. Avidyaa Vishayaha (Asti) Yasya
Tat. That has Avidya as Vishaya the subject matter.

Bahuvrihi itself is Bahuvrihi. Bahuvrihi literal meaning is Lot of
Rice. But it is not Lot of Rice but person having lot of rice. A rich
man.
