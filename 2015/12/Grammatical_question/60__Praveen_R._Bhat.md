Namaste Venkateshji,

Thanks for your response. The possibility of bahuvrIhi is ruled out and
hence the question. Had these been bahuvrIhi, the TikAkAra wouldn't have
brought out a vyutpatti to justify the neuter gender. Moreover, bahuvrIhi
is anyapadapradhAna, so that needs to be justified too. Here, what is being
talked about by the samAsa is the viShaya, subject; uttarapada being
pradhAna, it is tatpuruSha.

PS: In both your vigrahas of rameshvara, tatpurusha or bahuvrIhi, only
Shiva is represented. However, it can also be karmadhAraya; only then Rama
is represented by the samAsa.

Kind rgds,
--Praveen R. Bhat
