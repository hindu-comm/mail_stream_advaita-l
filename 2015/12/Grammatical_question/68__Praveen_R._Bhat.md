Namaste Subbuji,


Thanks for your response. My reply is inline please.

 There you go. This same applies to the later compounds also because the
same topic continues. More below.

Shankara uses the compound as well as gives the vigraha vākyam for both the

Possibility, yes, I too thought so before writing my first mail, but that
is not so in this context, which is precisely why टीकाकार Anandagiri gives
a व्युत्पत्ति for विषय justifying नपुंसकलिङ्गम्, in as many words.

This is the bhāṣya vākyam:
> यदपरविद्याविषयं कर्मफललक्षणम्, सत्यं तदापेक्षिकम् ।

> कर्मणः फलं कर्मफलम् [षष्ठीतत्पुरुषसमासः] कर्मफलं (एव) लक्षणं यस्य

सत्यम् here is the subjective complement for the समास, not अन्यपद.

> अपरविद्यायाः विषयं अपरविद्याविषयम् (षष्ठीतत्पुरुष). अपरविद्याविषयं यत् तत्
> (सत्यम्) अपरविद्याविषयम् सत्यम् । Here, the compound word, as a bahuvrīhi,

 This is surprising! My understanding differs, as explained below.

For example वीरपुरुषः रामः . वीरश्च असौ पुरुषश्च वीरपुरुषः
> [विशेषणपूर्वपदकर्मधारयः]. This adjective,  no doubt a compound, qualifies

Then, one could use the अपेक्षा/ आकाङ्क्षा and make any compound,
especially, all कर्मधारयs बहुव्रीहि; दशरथपुत्र, for example! My
understanding of Panini's definition of बहुव्रीहि is different from this.
What is definitely a तत्पुरष *also* in any विग्रहवाक्य, cannot be a
बहुव्रीहि because all the समाससंज्ञाs in Panini sutras operate with the
restriction via the अधिकारसूत्र १.४.१ आकडाराद्-एकासंज्ञा। The अधिकार सूत्र
that gives the संज्ञा of बहुव्रीहि is २.२.२३ शेषो बहुव्रीहि। That being so,
whatever you are trying to make a बहुव्रीहि with an आकाङ्क्षा on a समास
will already have become कर्मधारय or some other तत्पुरुष via other
preceding sutras since the उत्तरपद प्रधानत्वम् will remain. Not only can it
not get another संज्ञा but is also not शेषः anymore.


In my opinion, since these adjectives are not standalone, they qualify to
> be bahuvrīhi.

I differ, as discussed above and previously. What would be your opinion on
why टीकाकार took the pain to bring a different करणव्युत्पत्ति that goes
against the regular derivation of विषय via masculine अच् प्रत्यय which
could easily be done away with by just saying its a बहुव्रीहि since it
qualifies something else. Not only that, he could have even said that it
represents वस्तु/ object.

> Your opinion on this is welcome.

My opinion remains the same, as already expressed with the question
relating to the प्रत्यय, because I exhausted all possibilities of those
being बहुव्रीहिs, including the ones you gave here. That is the reason I
started my first mail by saying that they are तत्पुरषs.

Thanks once again for your time.
