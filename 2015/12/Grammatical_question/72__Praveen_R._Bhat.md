Yes, that is how I meant it too, just that I explained with a विग्रह वाक्य।
My understanding holds even if you say वीरपुरुषः रामः धीरः अस्ति। Also,
वीरपुरुषः will remain कर्मधारयः and not become बहुव्रीहि for the same
reasons mentioned before and also below.

Surely we can, except that the पदs in the समास should not be denoted. If,
for example I had to take the stock example दृष्टसमुद्रः and use it as an
adjective to say दृष्टसमुद्रः रामः, I would be saying दृष्टः समुद्रः येन सः
रामः। What you were expecting to do though is to have the उत्तरपद
प्राधान्यम् as well as बहुव्रीहि।

That may well be. It could be बहुव्रीहि here, representing not सत्यम् but
अपरविद्याविषयम्। The विग्रह changes but the meaning doesn't change.

Sorry, I am back to my subjective complement argument. सत्यम् is विधेय not
विशेषण here.

The reasonable meaning is brought out by Swami Paramarthananda ji so: "It
has been said that the nature of karma phalam is satyam, the truth".
