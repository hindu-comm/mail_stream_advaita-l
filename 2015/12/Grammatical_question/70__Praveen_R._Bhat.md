Sir, let me state my understanding of adjective first. In the sentence,
वीरः रामः धीरः अस्ति, वीरः is an adjective while धीरः is a subjective
complement. If I say both are adjectives to Rama, then the sentence will
mean that the brave,steady Rama exists! My विवक्षा is clearly to say that
the brave Rama is steady. Similarly here, कर्मफलानाम् लक्षणम् अपरविद्यायाः
विषयम् (उक्तम्) आपेक्षिकम् सत्यम् अस्ति । सत्यम् becomes a subjective
complement, IMHO. Of course, you could have other अन्वयs still the विग्रहs
for the compounds will remain तत्पुरषs. So not bahuvrIhis as per my
previous mail again.

Not in my understanding of Panini. Perhaps, someone more knowledgeable can
enlighten further.

Again, IMHO, yes. That will either be a karmadhAraya or another kind of
tatpuruSha.
