I meant a compound word as adjective like 'virapuruṣaḥ' to the noun 'rāma.'


Can we not have a bahuvrīhi compound as a viśeṣaṇa at all?

I am afraid the above is not the case, at least in the bhāṣyam context.  It
will be 'कर्मफलं लक्षणं यस्य तत्’. This is because that 'satyam' in that
sentence is about the 'certainty of the actions, vedic, giving their
fruit.' So, that 'satyam' is of the nature/atribute that is 'karmaphalam'.
I do not see any reasonable meaning in the vigraha suggested as
कर्मफलानाम् लक्षणम्.
