Sri Chandramouli ji
Namaste.
Regarding the difference between the Brahman of Advaita and Sabda of Vyakarana, the short answer is that there is no difference if we understand that VaiyAkaraNas worship Sabda as Brahman; what Advaitins do not accept is that Brahman, in the ultimate view, is of the form of Sabda (Sabda is Brahman is agreeable to Advaitins for everything is Brahman, the reverse that Brahman is of the form of Sabda, in the Advaitin's view is limiting the limitless Brahman). There is absolutely no issue within the realm of SagunopAsana. Now is nirguNabrahman the same as Sabda? It depends on how we want to interpret; if we take a literal interpretation of received texts, we have to say Advaita is opposed to SphoTavAda (since BhagavatpAda condemned SphoTavAda in DevatAdhikaraNam) and therefore have to interpret Sabda as a "property" of Brahman (actually, Sabda ought to be the property of AkASa, but we will let that be). However if we take a sympathetic view, then the meaning of "Brahman is of the form of Sabda" is that since Brahman is beyond Sabda (यतो वाचो निवर्तन्ते), and yet Sabda remains the only means to Brahman (ब्रह्मणः शास्त्रप्रमाणत्वम्), that Brahman is of the nature of Sabda is a proper resolution. For most advaitins the first position is the natural one to take - and easier, I might add. I am in the process of exploring the second position or something similar to it. I don't think the journey has ended. The second position has the obvious difficulty of explaining sphoTavAdanakhaNDana in DevatAdhikaraNam. Two plausible explanations are a) paravAsanayA (paraphrasing NAgeSabhaTTa), i.e. due to the influence of MimAMsA [1], b) to ensure that sAdhakas are not misguided; it might be possible to propose that Brhaman = Rasa etc. (as Alankarasastra very nearly does - they say rasAnubhUti is brahmAnandasahodarI) and so on, and in the confusion, proper understanding might be diluted.
Anyhow, leaving the critical issue in the unresolved position, I give below descriptions of Brahman by BharRtrRhari in BrahmakANDa and will follow it up in the next email with translation of two or three kArikAs from jAtisamuddeSa and maybe all of DravysamuddeSa to show how close the descriptions are. You might find that, except in point no. 2 below, Advaitins will agree with all other descriptions. Numbers in parentheses refer to the kArika number in VAkyapadIya.

(1.3)

8. यस्य च एकस्य सर्वबीजस्य भोक्तृ-भोक्तव्य-रूपेणभोगरूपेण च इयम् अनेकधा स्थितिः – which, though one and the seed ofeverything, is seen in the differentiated state of consumer, the consumed andconsumption (1.4)
