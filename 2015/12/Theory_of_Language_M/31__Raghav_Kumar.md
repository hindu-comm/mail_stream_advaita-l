Namaste Siva Senani garu
Thank you for the explanation...
A few follow-up points ....

1.   I remember reading a tract from mahAmahopAdhyAya Ganganatha Jha that
 the prabhAkara-mImAmsA  work 'prakaraNa-panchikA'  holds that for proper
nouns, convention (sanketa) is the basis for the shabda-artha sambandha.
Eg., we name a baby Devadatta. So the denotative power of the word
Devadatta to denote that particular baby began at a point in time. So the
shabdArtha-sambandha in this case is anitya. While for nitya-jAti-s,  which
are all of Vedic origin, the connection between gauH and cowness is nitya.
Nothing new here to what i already said before. Is this the Gurumatam while
the other view you expressed (given in the next para)  is the  BhATTa view?

 You wrote that  mImAmsA examines even words representing proper nouns and
says that we can view even them as a class e.g., Devadattvam as a class
consisting of innumerable individual instances viz., Devadatta1,
Devadatta2, Devadatta3 and so on representing Devadatta as he grew up, aged
and grew old etc. (if i understand you correctly).

With this position, would not the class called Devadattvam have begun at
some point in time (viz., with the birth of the child named Devadatta.)?
What would be the status of the Devadattvam jAti before the birth of the
child? Are we to take it that the mImAmsaka also says that even before
birth the denotative power of the word Devadutta to denote its artha was
existent but latent (in the mind)  and afterwards it manifests and connects
with an external referrent when the child is born ? (like even gotvaM was
latent for some time after sRShTi until suitable conditions emerged for the
manifestation of individuals of the gotva class) This would be identical
 to the vyAkaraNa position.

2.   A very remarkable thing you wrote is -
 "All other words, whether mere mis-pronunciations or Arabic or Innuit
words might work for communication but they started off as corruptions of
Sanskrit words. As to proof of transformation, we might have it or not, but
simply assumed that they are transformations. "

In other words can we say that even a language such as Tamil is but a
transformation of the deva-bhAShA Sanskrit?
 This sounds strange but is the necessary corollary which follows from the
inevitable force of  logic. (shruti-matas-tarka ofcourse)
1. The autpattika sUtraof Jaimini saying that shabdArtha-sambandha is nitya
accepted by bhAShyakAra and all other advaitins, mImAmsaka-s and
vaiyAkaraNa-s.
2. The jagat has  (as though) been created and  evolved through Vedic
shabda-s is the siddhAnta of vyAsa in the Brahma Sutra .(through
shabda-prabhavatvaM explained by bhAshyakAra in devatAdhikaraNaM BSB 1.3.28)

>From 1 and 2 , it follows that if bhAshyakAra is right then, Tamil has to
be a transformation of Sanskrit. (I repeat these words since they seem hard
to imagine.) If I have missed any steps which can give rise to an
alternative conclusion, kindly indicate...

(I understand the words pika, nema etc to be authentic Vedic words which
are extant among mleccha-s and became extinct among shishTa-s. So we merely
figure out the meaning of some Vedic words with a little help from mleccha
usages. We need not say that Veda contains mlechha words. I suppose that is
why you wrote that certain Vedic words are (merely) 'categorized' as
mleccha words. )

Raghav Kumar
