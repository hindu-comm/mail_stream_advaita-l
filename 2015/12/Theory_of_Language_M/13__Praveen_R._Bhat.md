Not at all; your sub-clauses were useful. I didn't misunderstand that it
was not a pUrvapakSha, but perhaps I should have phrased my question
better. Apologies for repeating the question but I intended to ask as to
why does the pUrvapakShi consider यण् ordained in the place of इक् as wrong
translation/ interpretation when it is called as a *substitution/
replacement*? Only if said to be a *modification*, then the translation
could be construed as being wrong. Or...

... is the pUrvapakShi considering that Panini is substituting only a
letter not a word? I would have thought that when Panini says अचि परतः, the
इ in दधि gets य् आदेश it is not different from saying that दधि gets दध्य्
आदश meaning that replacement of a letter is replacement of the word as well.
