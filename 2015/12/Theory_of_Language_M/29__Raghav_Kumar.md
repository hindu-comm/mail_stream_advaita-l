Namaste Siva Senani garu

On shabda-nityatvaM

This has been accepted by advaitins, mImAmsaka-s and vaiyAkaraNa-s. Quite
obviously an important convergence. I have a few rather basic doubts
regarding this.

1. The shabda and artha sambandha is not nitya when it comes to proper
nouns like a  man named (who else but...) devadatta etc.. For,  in such
cases convention (sanketa)  is the basis and this is pauruSheya. He is
anitya and he was named so upon his birth. ( Because the person is anitya,
we cannot form a valid syllogism that 'all words have anitya sambandha with
their meanings, like even in the case of Devadatta '   Only in the case of
common nouns denoting classes such as the gotva jAti for cows etc., the
shabda-artha connection is said to be nitya, the jAti-s being nitya.

 For the mImAmsaka the universe is in a steady state condition and the
Earth is assumed to have always had the idyllic bovine economy, so the fact
that the jAti-s are nitya follows naturally and the words like gauh
denoting the jAti-s were always in vogue and were not born of any human
convention at some point in time.

 For the Vedantin, sRShTi is there and the powerful idea of the Uinverse
being created from the Word comes in. The shabda-prabhavatvaM of  jagat
implies that the Veda mantras encapsulate all the concepts and ideas
required to 'store'  the knowledge of all the nitya jAti-s of the Universe,
at the time of pralaya. The  jAti-s like cowness, human-ness etc., do not
change from kalpa to kalpa. yathA purvam akalpayat. Just as in the previous
cycle of creation, even so is it this time, the first-born recollects the
Vedic sentences with their meanings and thereby creates the Universe with
its denizens.

My question is  - what is the status (nitya or anitya, and pauruSheya or
apauruSheya)  of the shabdArtha sambandha for non-Vedic words, let us say,
from a non-Indo-european language like Arabic or Innuit etc.  Is the
connection between the shabda 'jamal'un' and its artha viz.,'an animal with
a humped back which takes you across the desert and drinks lots of water at
a time'  paurusheya or apauruSheya nitya? What about Sanksrit common nouns
like sangaNaka etc for a computer?

 Prima facie, there seems to be no harm is positing that, except those
words (i.e., Vedic sentences)  which are necessary to ensure jagataH
shabda-prabhavatvaM, all other (non-Vedic origin Arabic or Innuit) words or
words like sangaNaka can well be labeled pauruSheya in origin. But would
not this go against the autpattika sutra quoted by Acharya Jaimini
espcially as understood by the vaiyAkaraNa-s?


The other alternative would be to say that all words and their meanings in
all languages (except proper nouns) are apauruSheya nitya - they are all
potentially there in Brahman. (we could even give supporting logic from
satkAryavAda for this view).  So our analysis is truly language
independent. But i am not clear if the idea that many other non-Vedic words
are also apaurusheya nitya is compatible with advaita siddhAnta.

Also on a totally different note, it may be a challenge to claim
apaurusheya nitya status for onomatopoeic words like cuckoo, hoopoe,  kAka
etc., where sanketa (human convention) is the plausible origin.

 I do recognize that in the entire discussion above, I took a chronological
view of the shabdArtha sambandha being nitya or otherwise.
 The vaiyAkaraNa would  possibly trace each word backwards ontologically
along the four levels of vAk to arrive at the Sabda-tattva, and the nitya
sambandha between words and menaings inheres in the Sabda-tattva (without
changing it in any way.) All words and meanings are in shabda-brahman but
shadba-brahman is devoid of all differentiation in to words and meanings. -
Such is my present understanding.
