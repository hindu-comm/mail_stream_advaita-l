The BG verse cited above is, along with the bhṣyam:


   - त्रैगुण्यविषया वेदा निस्त्रैगुण्यो भवार्जुन ।
   निर्द्वन्द्वो नित्यसत्त्वस्थो निर्योगक्षेम आत्मवान् ॥ ४५ ॥

   अग्रे पठन्तु...
   <http://advaitasharada.sringeri.net/php/format.php?bhashya=Gita&page=02#BG_C02_V45#त्रैगुण्य>
   - श्रीमद्भगवद्गीताभाष्यम् । द्वितीयोऽध्यायः । श्लोक ४५ - भाष्यम्
   त्रैगुण्यविषयाः त्रैगुण्यं संसारो विषयः प्रकाशयितव्यः येषां ते वेदाः
   त्रैगुण्यविषयाः । त्वं तु निस्त्रैगुण्यो भव अर्जुन, निष्कामो भव इत्यर्थः

 The above is with regard to that part of the Vedic corpus which teaches
attainments within samsāra. What the BG teaches above is: One aught not to
stay in that part of the Veda and ideally has to rise above it to come to
Atmavidyā.  No doubt this vidyā too is available in the Veda itself, in the
Upanishad portion. The Atman/Brahman is the one beyond the three gunas and
all attainments, using the veda, other than the Atman will be in the
triguṇa realm only.  That is the purport of the above verse.

The entire Veda, as a pramāṇ (both for abhyudaya and niḥsreyasa), is within
the vyavaharika is another matter.

Adhyasa bhāṣya:
तमेतमविद्याख्यमात्मानात्मनोरितरेतराध्यासं पुरस्कृत्य सर्वे
प्रमाणप्रमेयव्यवहारा लौकिका वैदिकाश्च प्रवृत्ताः, सर्वाणि च शास्त्राणि
*विधिप्रतिषेध**मोक्षपराणि ।*
and hence alone the entire veda is mithyā from the pāramārthik position.
