Namaste Sri Siva SenAni ji,

Thanks once again for your posts.

Re the below, I have a query:

If the interpretation of the vyAkaraNa sUtra is one of restriction of
usage, it would mean that the identity of the first sabda is dependent on
the the sabda that follows it, or something that occurs after it in time.
Such an interpretation would mean that the effect precedes the cause. How
can that be possible? Also, is nityatvam of the sabda not affected thereby
(because there is a cause effect dependency)?

Of course, one possible answer is that the first sabda and second sabda
always existed as dadhya and atra, and that the rule is merely observing
that the first sabda is not dadhi, but dadhya and is attributing the
exception (a different first sabda) to the start of the second sabda.

Regards,
Venkatraghavan
