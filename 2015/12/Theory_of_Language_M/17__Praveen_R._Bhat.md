Precisely why I asked the question. vaiyyAkaraNas would usually not use the
word पद unless it fits the definition of one of the 4 sutras, main ones
being १.४.१४ सुप्तिङन्तम् पदम् as you mention below and १.४.१७
स्वादिष्वसर्वनामस्थाने, latter being the pada-derivation stage jargon with
specifics. So I wanted to know if there was something more to it, because
in the context of grammar, unless the word gets a पदसंज्ञा that word will
not fall in the संज्ञाप्रदेश of anything that operates on a पद।

A small correction, you mean ti~N, तिङ्।

In fact, technically, any sound can be categorized as a शब्द; e.g., bee's
buzzing is called अव्यक्त-शब्दः and unclear speech is अव्यक्तायां वाचि
शब्दः। However, a pada is mostly a declined shabda. So रामः is a पद but राम
is not (unless in vocative case, of course) and that is why we have
रामशब्दवत् and not रामपदवत्।

True, it looks like an impossibility, captured in mere 4000 sutras!

First time I started studying the mAheshvara sutras, not even Panini sutras
then, I was thinking that all the headers, packets, and what have you in
today's networking or data compression world, has all been done in the best
possible way by Maharshi Panini already. Our teacher, a programmer in his
pUrvAshrama, told us that every object-oriented language programmer should
learn Panini sutras. :)
