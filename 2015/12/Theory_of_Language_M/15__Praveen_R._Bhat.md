Namaste, Siva Senani ji,

Thanks, that was very helpful. Its good to see that Mahabhashyakara clearly
states that Agama is also not a modification but a replacement of the
entire "pada". However, it is curious as to why Patanjali uses the word
pada instead of shabda in the context.

Kind rgds,
--Praveen R. Bhat
