Namaste Siva Senani ji,

First of all, thanks for both of your wonderful posts. While awaiting your
3rd post in the series, may I ask the following clarification?

Why would the usual translation be wrong, when the वृत्ति for इको यणचि
would have to say that इकः स्थाने यण् आदेशः भवति? Isn't आदेश (or आगम/ लोप
for that matter) always supposed to be a replacement and not a
modification? In that case, the word दध्य् formed by replacing a letter is
not the same word, unless said so by another पारिभाषिक sutra; is this right?

Of course, Bhashyakara Sabariswami's answer seemed to clinch the argument.

Kind rgds,
