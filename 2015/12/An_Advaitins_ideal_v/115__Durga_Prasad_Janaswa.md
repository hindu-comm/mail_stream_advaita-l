Hari Om,
Namaste.

I am unable to play the audio.   I am getting the following error message
when trying to play the audio file>

File reading failed:

VLC could not open the file
"C:\Users\subbu\Downloads\AUD-20151230-WA0016.3ga" (Bad file descriptor).

Your input can't be opened:

VLC is unable to open the MRL
'file:///C:/Users/subbu/Downloads/AUD-20151230-WA0016.3ga'. Check the log
for details.


Appreciate any help.


Thanks and regards
