Namaste,

////////

We celebrate it as " Vaikunta Ekdasi" or Mukkoti, as all the vaishnava temple 
are rushed with full of devotees and one this day (Only once in year) 
the northern gate i.e Vaikunta Dwar will be opened and people we are in need of 
mukti/moksha will enter through the gate and take the blessing of lord vishnu. 

///////////

People rush towards northern gate to get Mukti ....and once the 
gates are opened, they enter Vaikunta :))

So, vaikuNTa prApti is guaranteed for all those who rush towards
the northern gate...

regs,
sriram
