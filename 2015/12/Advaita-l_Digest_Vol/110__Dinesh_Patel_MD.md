The discourse going on is amazing
Many years of learning and deep learning is what brings to us 
As a novice person I find some what difficult to understand the smooth thoughts passing by and frequently confused by capital letter and the rest
It appears that this discourse is for postgraduate students of Vedas and Hindu scriptures 
In order to disseminate wonderful discourse to the common masses 
Do you have another group who deals with beginners or can you elaborate slowly the discourse 
 So proud of this group
 Eager to learn the self, inner spirit coming for ages with simplification for us
 Best 
Dinesh
