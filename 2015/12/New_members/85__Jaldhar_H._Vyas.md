----------

I have been a student of Advaita for over 40 years. I am a
physicist/mathematician, interested in the philosophical foundations of
physics, and their relationship to Advaita. A 'two way' dialogue is very
important at the present time. I intend to set up a website dealing with the
connections between Advaita and modern physics and philosophy!!!
