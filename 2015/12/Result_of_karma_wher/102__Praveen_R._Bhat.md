I am aware of the Shruti vAkya, since thats what Bhashyakara means when he
says akaraNe pratyavAyaH shrUyate. My question is only as to whether the
statement is traceable, that is, in which Shruti/ where does the statement
occur?

I also know the differences in how we interpret pratyavAya vs mImAMsaka-s,
so you didn't have to take the trouble to write up the rest of your mail.
There is a lot of discussion on pratyavAya that went on this very list some
years back. Sorry if my question wasn't clear.

 Rgds,
