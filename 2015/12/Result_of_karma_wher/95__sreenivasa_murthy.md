Dear Sri Praveen Bhat,
At the end of your postings the following Upanishadic mantra is seen : /* Through what should one know That owing to which all this is known!
 [Br.Up. 4.5.15] */ What does the mantra trying to convey to you? Have you tried to understand the advice given by the mantra?

Then,won't you think that one should put his energy and time to know THAT which is one's own own true svaUpa knowing which all this will become known ? Is it not better instead of putting a questatio coming under the category of "idaM" ? Please ponder over.
With warm regards,Sreenivasa Mrthy.

 Subject: [Advaita-l] Result of karma where result is not mentioned

hariH oM.

Namaste all,

I had heard in the context of arthasaMgraha that wherever a result is not
mentioned for shruti-prescribed karma, such as nityakarma, pUrva mimAMsakas
take it as svargaH. Is this view correct and if so, where is such a view
mentioned?

If not, could someone guide me onto what pUrva mimAMsA says in this regard?

Thanks much,
--Praveen R. Bhat
