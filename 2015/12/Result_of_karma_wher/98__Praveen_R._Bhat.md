Namaste Swamiji,

Thank you for your response and guidance. I don't have much background in
pUrvamImAMsA, so I went through a book to find what you quoted.

Maybe, there are different versions, but I didn't find these in 4.3.5-6-7
(4.3.5 was एकस्य तूभयत्वे संयोगपृथकत्वम्) but reading further, I think that
the sutras say so--

Any result not mentioned along with the karma/ vidhi should be searched
elsewhere, said as a response to objection in 4.3.10 चोदनायां फलाश्रुतेः
कर्ममात्रं विधीयेत न ह्यशब्दं प्रतीयते and then the translator has put a
note in the sutras that follow, to the effect that the connection is by
principle of एकवाक्यता। I suppose that एकवाक्यता for Mimamsakas is स्वर्गः।
4.3.15 says स स्वर्गः स्यात्सर्वान्प्रत्यविशिष्टत्वात् that (reward/
result) is heaven because it is desired by all, and 4.3.16 प्रत्ययाच्च and
by reason of (our) experience.

I may have even looked up incorrect sutras since it seems to be in the
context of वश्वजित्। I'd appreciate if you could write up something on this
topic, when you find time. Its always a pleasure to read your emails.
