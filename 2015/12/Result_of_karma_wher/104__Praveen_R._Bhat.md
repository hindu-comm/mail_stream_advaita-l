Sorry, that was an oversight, lax on my part. I meant karmas prescibed by
vidhis.

That the phala is imagined is something I didn't not know.

My understanding was that the phala mentioned elsewhere in the shruti is to
brought into the shruti where it is not mentioned. So I thought it was
inference being mentioned somewhere else remotely. If the phala itself is
imagined elsewhere too, then it would be arthApatti.

This is very useful elaboration. Thanks.

This is what I meant by inference above. Is it not anumAna being used here?

Now, I understand the method a little better.

I think I was mixing up the result itself directly with the shabda.

The book I referred to, said that to be ekavAkyatA to say that svarga being
the final goal for mImAMsaka-s, they bring in such a phala into other
places too.

Okay.

This is what I had asked in the first mail, whether it can be applied to
non-kAmyas like nityakarma.

Okay, so avoiding pApa itself becomes the motivation for nityakarma.
