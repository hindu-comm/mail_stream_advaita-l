hariH oM.

Namaste all,

I had heard in the context of arthasaMgraha that wherever a result is not
mentioned for shruti-prescribed karma, such as nityakarma, pUrva mimAMsakas
take it as svargaH. Is this view correct and if so, where is such a view
mentioned?

If not, could someone guide me onto what pUrva mimAMsA says in this regard?

Thanks much,
--Praveen R. Bhat
