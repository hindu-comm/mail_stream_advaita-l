Namaste Sreenivasa Murthy ji,

It is amusing to know that you found my signature mantra more interesting
than the mail content itself. Thanks for all your assumptions about me,
what I haven't done, what I do, unsolicited advice on what I should do, but
most of all, for breaking out of your abidance in true svarUpa to respond
to my idaM-category mail.

Kind rgds,
--Praveen R. Bhat
