​No difference. You just went for sUtra-s, while I mentioned adhikaraNa-s.

I'll try to write something.
But, it will be better if you could present your present understanding of
three adhikaraNa-s and the problems you are facing.
Then I will be able to help you understand the parts which are tricky or
unfamiliar.​
