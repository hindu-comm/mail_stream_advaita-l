Namaste

Here is a part of the talk delivered by Vidwan Sri Mani Dravid Sastriṇaḥ in
Bengaluru on 27th Dec. 2015, on the topic of 'Advaitam' in Sanskrit.  The
occasion was a function to felicitate the renowned scholar Sri Bannanje
Govndacharya on his 80th birthday.

Owing some defect in recording a third of the totally 30 minute talk could
not be captured.
