An error has crept into my earlier post.


In place of


<< This leads to the understanding << That which is perceived as existing (
in the vyavaharic sense ) is NOT Brahman >> and << That which is perceived
as nonexisting ( again in the vyavaharic sense ) is NOT Brahman >> .


please read as follows.


<< That which is perceived as existing ( सत् in the vyavaharic sense ) ,
Brahman is NOT THIS ( नेति - न इति - न इदम् ) >> and << That which is
perceived as nonexisting ( असत् again in the vyavaharic sense ) , Brahman
is NOT THIS ( नेति - न इति - न इदम् ) >>.


I sincerely regret the error.


Regards



Chandramouli
