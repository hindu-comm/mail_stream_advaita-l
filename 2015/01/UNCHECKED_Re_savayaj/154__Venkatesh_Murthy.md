Namaste

Kindly see the statistics below -

Human population in 1800 - 1 Billion
In 2012         - 7 Billion
In 2030         - 8.4 Billion
In 2050         - 9.6 Billion

But animal population has reduced greatly. Say Tigers.
India has half of Tiger population - 1706 in 2011

Lion Population

In 1950 - 400,000
In 2004 - 16,500 to 40,000
Asian Lion in 2010 - 411

You can see Human Population is Growing very fast and Animal Population is
shrinking very fast.

Many Wild animal species are becoming Extinct. There are many endangered
animal species like Swamp Deer and Himalayan Musk Deer.

This bad Scene was not there in ancient times. There was robust population
of animals and MINIMUM population of people.

In this situation Yajnas with animal sacrifice was done. Killing animals
was not causing Imbalance in Nature.

Now change the Scene to Modern Day. Now we should not kill animals but
protect them. Every animal life saved is a Punya Karma.
