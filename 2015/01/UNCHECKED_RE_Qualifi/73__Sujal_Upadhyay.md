Namaste,

To add to the above explanation of point #2, I would like to add that for
choosing a successor of the peetham, both scholarlyness and inner purity is
necessary. Hence the divine intervention is necessary in choosing the
successor. I feel that Jagadguru also has divine eyes which help him see
the past and may be past lives of his disciples. Afterall not all become
eligible to become a Shankaracharya :)

Sri Abhinav Vidyatirtha's guru Sri Chendrashekhar Saraswati III didnt much
cared about the activities going on in matha and so his disciple had to
take care of it.

OM

nothing but unhappiness" - Bhagawan Ramana Maharshi

He who lacks faith, lacks all
It is the faith int he name of lord that works wonders
