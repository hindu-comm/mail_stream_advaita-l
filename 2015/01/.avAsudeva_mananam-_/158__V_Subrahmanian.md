There is a recently published book (by the Sringeri Peeṭham) titled
'Vāsudeva mananam' of Sri Vāsudeva Yati (priced Rs.50) with the Sanskrit
text in Kannada script  and a Kannada translation-explanation by Sringeri
Kavi Narasimha Sharmā.

We are planning to start a weekly study group with this text, in Kannada,
at the Sringeri Shankara Maṭha, Bangalore, shortly.  Anyone interested in
participating in the group may contact me offline.
