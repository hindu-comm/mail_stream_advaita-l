Dear Sri Sriram ji,

Nice to hear about this.  If you have the book, could you please let us
know if the revered author has said in the book that he is commenting on
the Shiva sahasra nāma that is present in the ānuśāsanika parva of the
Mahābhārata?
Could you also provide a scan of the relevant page/s?

warm regards
