Namaste,

A great madhvA scholar by name shrI BH Ananda tIrtha (DOB : 02-05-1948), who was born to mahAmahOpAdhyAya, pada-vAkya-pramANa shrI BH padmanAbharAya sarma, wrote a gloss for shiva-sahasranAma in telugu.   He was the pradhAna shishyA of shrI satyapramOda tirtha of uttarAdi mutt and studied the madhva shAstra under His Holiness.

shrI Ananda tIrtha, was a mahArASTra paNDita, who studied under various stalwarts like mAmiDEla sitarama sAstry, shrI brahmadatta jignAsu, shrI BNK Sarma, shrI chArudEva shAstry etc. He was awarded "vyAkaraNAchArya" and "niruktAchArya" birudAvaLi from Banaras Hindu University and in Puna Madhva Sammelana, He was awarded "shrI madhva-shAstra-ratnAkaraH". He was awarded the "sAhitya-vAchaspati" in Jaipur paNDita sabha.  

When such a great madhva scholar wrote a short commentary of shiva-sahasranama, without any inhibitions, rest of the madhvas can be ignored who are just a small fry.  

Some of the explanations are wonderful to contemplate that present thought-provoking meanings.

Sometime back, shrI rAma publishers, printed this work which is out of print now.

regs,
sriram
