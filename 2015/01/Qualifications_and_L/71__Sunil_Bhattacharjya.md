Namaste,
The reciting of the Vedas properly is important and for that one also has to study the Vedangas well. Of the Vedangas the more prominent ones being the Jyotisha (which includes both astronomy and astrology ) and Vyakarana. That is not to say that the other Vedangas can be ignored. However the most important thing is that one has to understand the Vedas and it becomes more difficult when one knows that the Vedas need paroksha interpretation. If properly put, all these will do doubt excite the present-day youths. Permit me to give one example, below :

The Rigveda in the beginning itself, says about the seven offsprings of the sun, which are nothing but the seven planets, including the Earth. In the Geocentric representation the Sun exchanges place with the earth and we get the first seven grahas of the Navagraha. The the eighth is the Ketu or Dhumketu or Comet and the ninth is the Svarabhanu, mentioned in the Veda. Svarabhanu becomes divided to Rahu and Ketu in Astrology. One who is non-conversant with the paroksha ways of the Vedas, may get dumbfounded and may not be able to relate the modern Hindu Jyotish to the Veda.

 Om!
The intention of my original mail was not to pass or seek judgment on the happenings at Sringeri, in terms of specific selection. It is not my job.
My main intention was to explore and compare how a modern youth who does not go to recite Vedas but has engaged in other studies, would develop to be a complete spiritual being. How to compare the mental development, and chances of such a person reaching the same Vedic goals.
Then I wanted to know the general profile of education of such 'pool' of students available for selection of an Acarya, as Sri Vidyashankar mentioned in his mail. Are they Veda pathis or Vidwans of (6 or less) Darshanas. Are there facilities now a days for regular high school and college education as well, as they grow up?
I know that a sanyasi in general is not a scholar, as we see in the world. But, mahA vAkya upadesha, in the sense of making one understand, is not a small job that can be done in a brief time. Also, in such an important ceremony as sanyasa deeksha, that step can't just be a upachara, leaving the actual study for later time. But, if the student has already done, say Vedanta Shiromani, but now takes sanyasa, then mahA vAkya upadesha is just a upacara. So, I wanted to hear any ideas on this matter.
If the current Acharya can use a microphone to address, perhaps there is nothing wring in typing an email, if it works for them, or have someone else type. How does it matter? Keeping up and propagating Dharma is the goal.
So, if people can comment on these, without getting into pro or against the present Sringeri situation, that will serve the purpose.
Om!

Om!
"rituals of pITArOhaNa would start from 22nd Jan'15 which is followed by mahAvAkya anugraha on 23d Jan'15."
Would someone clarify, what kind of prior education or training is expected for such selections, here at Singeri or elsewhere, not as a rule but as a general guideline. From the other posts I learn that, for Srinegi acayra / peetha adhikara, Yajurveda Adhyayana is the minimum expected. My further question is, is prior education in other Darshanas supposed to have been completed; or is the new initiate expected to start such studies after the initiation.
Related questions are:
1. If, for example, Vedanta studies have been accomplished, howmahAvAkya anugraha will be significant.2. If Vedanta studies have not been completed, howmahAvAkya anugraha will make 'complete' sense. Is it traditionally accepted that aftermahAvAkya anugraha, the sanyasi will start studies, meaning indirectly thatmahAvAkya anugraha does not do the job?
Further, in general what mental felicitation the new acarya select is supposed, or we can assume, to have accomplished in the earlier ashrama, and how can we, compare such overall mental felicity in children with other secular education, if not in Veda or Tarka etc. This is primarily to compare and contrast what one can accomplish in life, not necessarily to become a pithaadhipati, but to start as an ordinary individual at a similar age, but achieve atma jnana, starting at the age of say 21, but undergoing studies with similar commitment as the acarya towards dharma.
Om !

Namaste,

One of the joyous moments for us.

Shri Bharati Tirtha Swamiji has announced His uttarAdhikAri in sringeri. All the rituals of pITArOhaNa would start from 22nd Jan'15 which is followed by mahAvAkya anugraha on 23d Jan'15.

One of the brilliant brahmachArIs of sringeri veda pATashAla shri Kuppa Venkateshwara Prasad has been selected as the uttarAdhikAri who is the son of a great vedic & tarka scholar shrI kuppa siva subramanya avadhani garu, who served as veda pATashAla principal in Keesaragutta, near Hyderabad, and is the veda principal of TTD currently.

Let us all pray our due respects to the jagatguru-dwayam of sringeri now.

regs,
sriram
