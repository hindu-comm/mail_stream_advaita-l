SrI mAtre namaH 

Namste SrI Ananda ji and SrI Venkata Ji 

I'm grate full to you for this information. You wrote
" It is also a common practice to use the Riks of the shrI sukta for the
ShoDashopachAra pUjA of female deities." I agree with you that it is a common practice but there is one exceptional case ( especially being a upAsaka of her a) there is restriction on use of SrI sUktaM for dhUmAvatI pujA . After my initiation in this lore , I asked my initiators that how by using veda mantra I may worship her . He told me of 'yathA linga mantras , ( He was not a vedic brahmin but was a tantric brahmin raised up to shAmbhava bhAva ) .When I asked for srI suktaM he told me of 'pratangirasaM and Ugara mantra ' of my svashAkhA for her worship .
He told me to do upAsana in ' pAutra bhAbhA ' ( like a grandson of goddes dhUmA ) . Even it can't be used for worship of "saubhAgya dhUmAvatI ".
 One more thing he told ( about srI suktaM ) was for random fruit in case of srI sutaM it must be recited with ' yAchaka bhAvA '.

SrI Venkata Ji wrote " I have a copy of shrIsUkta nyAsa ...........rishis are: Ananda, kardama, chikleeta
..." 

But rishIs I have seen somewhere are: Ananda, kardama, chikleeta and Indirasuta . ( I will be great full if it is clarified )
