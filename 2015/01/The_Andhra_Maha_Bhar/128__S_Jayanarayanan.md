One more such instance in the Mahabharata (Sauptikaparva), where Krishna speaks of Shiva as the Supreme:


http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m10/m10017.htm

The holy one {i.e. Krishna} said, "Verily, Drona's son had sought the aid of that
highest of all the gods, the eternal Mahadeva. It was for this that he succeeded in slaying,
single-handed, so large a number of warriors. If Mahadeva be gratified, he can bestow even
immortality. Girisha can give such valour as will succeed in checking Indra himself.
I know Mahadeva truly, O bull of Bharata's race! I know also his various acts of old.
He, O Bharata, is the beginning, the middle, and the end of all creatures.
This entire universe acts and moves through his energy."
