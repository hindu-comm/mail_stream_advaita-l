Dear Jaldhar bhai,

Generally, it is the pandit that arranges all the material. For reference
books, Gita Press at Mumbai or in Malad (East) can be helpful. They do keep
janoi and books on karma kand in Gujarati and Hindi.

Chinmaya Mission, which is very close to IIT-Bombay, has a sanskrit
learning series of around Rs. 2000.00.

Bhartiya Vidya Bhavan, chawpati carries activities of training Pandits, but
I do not have much information. It is far away from IIT-Bombay.



OM
