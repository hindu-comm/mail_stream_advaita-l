Namaste Jaladhar Prabhuji,

Please visit the following link which enlists most of the information:

http://sanskritdocuments.org/atul/bookstores.html

Also, you can visit Sringeri Mutt  http://www.sringeri.net/branches/maharashtra/mumbai 
 which houses Sringeri publications and a few basic pooja items.

For most of the pooja items, GIRI trading is the best alternative. You can visit their website: www.giri.in/

Thanks
Abhinand
