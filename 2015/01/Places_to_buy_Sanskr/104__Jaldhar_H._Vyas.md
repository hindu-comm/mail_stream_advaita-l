I'm back from Mumbai and finally free of the post-conference busy work. 
Thanks to all that replied to my question.  Unfortunately I had no free 
time and was unable to go to any of the places suggested.  That's ok I had 
no particular title in mind.  I'm just an inveterate collector of books. 
For the janoi items too, it actually turns out I have almost everything 
needed and there is still time to get one of the frequent visitors to 
India from amongst my friends or relatives to bring anything I might find 
I lack.
