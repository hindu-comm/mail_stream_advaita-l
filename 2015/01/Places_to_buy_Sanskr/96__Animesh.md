 Another thing  I want to ask ( I'm sorry if it is personal ) will you perform upanayan of you son in Orthodox manner . I mean to say strictly according to pAraskara grihya sutra  or in accordance with current practices ( I mean to say is including lokAchara  of Gujaratis  where several folk practices { family ritual   etc } are included.  I have herd of several practices  like processions of boy whose is to be initiated { if I'm not wrong it is called varaghodA } , haridra snAna of boy ( haldi ) .

Another thing I would like to mentioned , while in previous discussion on tarpan , I have mentioned of  difference between current practices and authentic pratices of sukla yajurveda ,
 In shukla yajurvediya bramhakarma I have found a pAraskarokta  prayoga of sandhyavandan of sukla yajurveda.  I have checked the prayoga, it is authentic and strictly follows pAraskara's trikandikA snAna sutraM.


If it seems to be that my question is personal then please reply personally .
I would like to hear your reply and if you want then I will mail you the prayoga text's pdf .

Regards 
Animesh
