Next Thursday - Monday I will be making a quick trip to speak at a 
computing conference at IIT-Bombay.  It's a very hectic schedule but I 
might have some free time on Friday so I was wondering if anyone knew of 
places to buy Sanskrit books in Mumbai?  I also need a few items for my 
sons Janoi which we hope to perform this year.

Any advice will be appreciated.
