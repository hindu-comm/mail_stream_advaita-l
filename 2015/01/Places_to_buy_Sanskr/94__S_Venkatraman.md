Dear sir,

You can try at

Giri Stores
Modi Niwas, Opp. Matunga Post Office, Matunga (East), Mumbai, 400019.
Tel no. 022 24121344, 24123140. 

They are a very good source for religious and spiritual books and puja materials in Mumbai. I would have loved to be of more help but have very recently moved from Mumbai to Chennai. 

Regards,
Venkatraman

It's a very hectic schedule but I might have some free time on Friday so I was wondering if anyone knew of places to buy Sanskrit books in Mumbai?  I also need a few items for my sons Janoi which we hope to perform this year.
