I have not heard of a Saraswati Gita in the Mahabharata or elsewhere.  The 
Mahabharata does contain a Mahatmya of the Saraswati river and the tirths

It is the Aranyaparvan which has the Saraswati Mahatmya I mentioned above. 
Whether it has Srividya secrets I don't recall but then they tend to be 
secret. :-)
