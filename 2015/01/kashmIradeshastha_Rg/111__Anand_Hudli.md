The viniyoga of the 15 Riks of the shrI sUkta has been explained in the
prapanchasAra tantra, attributed to Shankara BhagavatpAda, in the 12th
paTala. The text says:

AvAhanAsanarghyakapAdyAchamanamadhuparkasekAni| vAsobhUShaNagandhAn
sumanoyutadhUpadIpabhojyAni| sodvAsanAni kuryAdbhaktiyuktaH
panchadashabhirathamanubhiH| vyastairapi cha samastaiH pUjAyAM
saMyatAtmakaH siddhyai|| iti

The commentary by PadmapAdAchArya is as follows:

vyastaiH samastairityatra vyastaishchaturdashabhiH nivedyAntaM datvA shrIM
bIjena chaturdashenaiva vA gaNDUShopachArAdikaM samarpya samastena sUktena
pradakShiNastutinamaskArAn vidhAya sheShaM shrIM bIjena kRtvA antyena
chodvAsayedityarthaH|

This means one should offer 14 upachAras (services) ending with the
naivedya (food offering) with the first 14 Riks of the shrIsUkta. Next, one
should offer water for rinsing the mouth (gaNDUSha) and other services with
the bIja mantra of LakShmI devI, namely shrIM, or with the 14th mantra of
the shrIsUkta (ArdrAM yaH kariNIM...Avaha). Next, one should offer
pradakShiNa (circumambulation), stuti (prayer), and namaskAra (prostration)
with the entire shrIsukta hymn. Other services should be offered with the
shrIm bIja mantra. Finally, one should offer the udvAsana service (bidding
farewell) with the last mantra of the shrIsUkta (tAM ma Avaha
...puruShAnaham).

So according to the prapanchasAra tantra and the commentary thereon, the
following is the viniyoga of the 15 shrIsUkta mantras:

1.  AUM hiranaNyavarNAM ... AvAhanaM samarpayAmi.
2. AUM tAM ma Avaha...   AsanaM samarpayAmi
3.  AUM ashvapUrvAM ... arghyaM samarpayAmi
4.  AUM kAM sosmitAM... pAdyaM samarpayAmi
5. AUM chandrAM prabhAsAM... AchamanaM samarpayAmi
6. AUM Aditya varNe... madhuparkaM samarpayAmi
7. AUM upaitu mAM... snAnaM samarpayAmi
8. AUM kShutpipAsAM... vastraM samarpayAmi
9. AUM gandhadvArAM... AbharaNaM samarpayAmi
10. AUM manasaH kAmaM... gandhaM samarpayAmi
11. AUM kardamena ... puShpaM samarpayAmi
12. AUM ApassRjantu... dhUpaM samarpayAmi
13. AUM ArdrAM pushkariNIM... dIpaM samarpayAmi
14. AUM ArdrAM yaH kariNIM... naivedyaM samarpayAmi
15. AUM tAM ma Avaha ... udvAsanaM samarpayAmi
