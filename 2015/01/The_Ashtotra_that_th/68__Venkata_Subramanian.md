 Subject: [Advaita-l] The Ashtotra that the Sishya Swamigal used on the Pitarohana day

Namaste Venkata,

This aSTOttara nAma is specially chanted ONLY during the pAda pUja 
to AchArya by uttarAdhikAri which is a unique one in sringeri parampara.

This is not printed anywhere and ALSO NOT TO BE SHARED.

These 108 names are only shared by AchArya to His uttarAdhikAri 
and thus is shared only during paTTAbhiSEka mahOtsava.

The person who officially administered the pAdukA pUja is my old friend
and it is he who told me about this.

regs,
sriram
