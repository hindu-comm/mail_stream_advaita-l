Dear Sri Venkatesh Murthy,

Of course, he says that. He is a Srivaishnava scholar.

Let me pose a counter to you. As a member of the Advaita-L list, why don't you take up the SAnkarabhAshya on this verse and share with the rest of the members here, what you think about it? The entire text of the gItAbhAshya is available online, in case you don't have a print publication, both at the Gita supersite from IIT Kanpur and at the Advaita Sharada site from Sringeri. 

Wouldn't our Acharya's bhAshya be the correct explanation for BhG 9-11? Or at least the first explanation that Advaitins should attempt to understand?

Best regards,
Vidyasankar
