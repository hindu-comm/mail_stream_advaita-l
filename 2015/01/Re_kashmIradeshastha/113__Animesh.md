Namste SrI Ananda ,





You wrote
" It is also a common practice to use the Riks of the shrI sukta for the
 ShoDashopachAra pUjA of female deities." I agree with you that it is a common practice but there is one exceptional case ( especially being a upAsaka of her ) there is restriction on use of SrI sUktaM for dhUmAvatI pujA .  After my initiation in this lore  , I asked my initiators that how by using veda mantra  I may worship her . He told me of 'yathA linga mantras , ( He was not a vedic brahmin but was a tantric brahmin raised up to shAmbhava bhAva )  .When I asked for srI suktaM he told me of 'pratangirasaM and Ugara mantra  ' of my svashAkhA for her worship .
He told me to do upAsana in ' pAutra bhAbhA ' ( like a grandson of goddes dhUmA ) . One more thing he told was for random fruit in case of srI sutaM it must be recited with ' yAchaka bhAvA '.
