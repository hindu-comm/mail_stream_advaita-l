It is unlikely that Shri Bharati Tirtha Svaminah himself manages these
Faceboo and Twitter accounts. There are probably managed by devotees
of the Sringeri Math or by people directly associated with the Math. I
don't see why the Swamiji must personally manage such things, because
he has a number of knowledgeable people around him who convey his
message (in the form of videos, etc.) to the Internet.
