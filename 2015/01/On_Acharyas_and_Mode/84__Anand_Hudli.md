I would like to point out that there are Facebook groups such as
GREATNESS OF SRINGERI SRI SARATHA PEETAM,
SRI SRINGERI MUTT, and also SRINGERI VIDEOS, which are all engaged in
disseminating information about the happenings at Sringeri Math and in
encouraging discussions among members. There is also a Sringeri Math
Twitter account that provides tweets.
