namaskaram Sarma garu,

I have changed the subject line.  First of all, I am overjoyed by the
announcement of the successor by the Sringeri Acharya . I was eagerly
waiting for this for a while.

On the use of modern technology, I believe Acharyas are quite familiar with
this and have very knowledgeable people around them to help them utilize it
when they see a need to use it.

Two months or so ago, Kanchi Matha scheduled a live video conference with
devotees in Austin, TX.  Sri Sri Sankara Vijayendra Swamin presented his
anugraha bhashanam and then had one-to-one  brief conversation with each
family in the audience. Program went for around two hours. I think they did
this with few other cities as well. This was initiated by a technology
company giving them the equipment and the maTha wanted to see if that can
be put to use.

As far as their relevance to their society, those who are in need of their
guidance seek them for help. It is like the light from Sun, available to
all for free - all you have to do is come out the dark cell to receive it.
In TN, Sri Sri Chandrasekharendra's Saraswati's talks where published as
many volumes in Tamil and was quite well received by all (not just
brahmanas). Matha also significant respect and attendance from non-brahmana
communities.

Ravi
