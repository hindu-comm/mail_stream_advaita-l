Namaste

//////

According to different sampradAya ( tantric tradition ) and gurU paramparA 
( master pupil lineage ) the text of stotra varies

///

Very true.  

Though "siddha-kunjika" varies from tantra to tantra, there is a "brihat mahA siddha kunjika" which was practiced by a great avadhUta near amarakanTaka kshEtra. This was handed down to shrI Omkaranatha shukla, which was mysteriously passed down to us.  This is again guru-mukhaika-vEdya. 

Apart from this, to unravel the mysteries of dEvi-mAhAtmyaM, the following tAntrika stOtrAs have hidden secrets:

1) siddha-chaNDi mahAvidyA sahasrAkshara vidya 

    The above vidya takes off with the sloka: 

     vandE parAgama vidyAM siddhichaNDIM sangItAM
     "mahAsapthasathI mantra swarUpAM" sarvasiddhipradAM

2) shrI garbha chaNDI pATaH : which again consists of "garbha-argaLa", "garbha-kIlaka", "garbha-shApa-vimOchana", "garbha-rAtri-sUkta", "garbha-chaNDi-mUla-mantra", "garbha-rahasya"

3) gupta-sapthasathi 

Apart from these, the very most important aspect in "chaNDi-anuSTAna" is "shikhA-bandhana" because shikhA-bandhana confers mantra-siddhi, Ojas, balaM, dIrgha Ayu (vide the mantra "dIrghAyutvAya balAya varchasE shikhA"). 

For any mantrAnuSTAna, shikhA-bandhana is mandatory.
