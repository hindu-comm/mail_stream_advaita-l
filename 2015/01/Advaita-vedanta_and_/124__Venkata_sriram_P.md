Namaste,
shrI kAvyakaNTa gaNapati muni says that owing to "bhrAnti" (delusion), the brahman appears asjIva. It is this "bhrAnti" that is extolled as "rAtri-dEvata" in Rg veda and in purANa as "jyESTa-dEvi".
In dEvi-mAhAtmyam, vide the sloka:
yA dEvi sarvabhUtESu bhrAnti rUpENa samsthitAnamastasyai namastasyai namastasyai namO namaH
the dhUmAvati is extolled as bhrAnti (avidya) here.
If properly worshiped, She clears up the dhUma (camouflage) lakSaNa (the AvaraNa lakSaNa) and confers the clear vision of swa-swarUpa jnAna.
