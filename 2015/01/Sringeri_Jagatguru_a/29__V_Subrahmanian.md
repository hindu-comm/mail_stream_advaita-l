Dear All,

Soon after announcing the name of the successor designate, HH the Jagadguru
made a remark:

Upon coming to the pīṭham one will not have feelings like 'I belong to this
or that locality, etc.'  The attitude will be:

अयं निजः परो वेति गणना लघुचेतसाम् |
उदारचरितानां तु वसुधैव कुटुम्बकम् ||

The conditioned thinking that 'this is mine and that is not' is that of the
immature.  Those endowed with a broad mentality will view the entire
universe as their own.

It was significant that the Jagadguru said the above.  True to that saying,
the Acharyas who occupied the Pīṭham have endeared themselves to people of
all linguistic and provincial denominations.  They have addressed
gatherings in Tamil, Kannada, Telugu, Hindi and Sanskrit. On a daily basis
they interact with innumerable devotees in these languages.

regards
