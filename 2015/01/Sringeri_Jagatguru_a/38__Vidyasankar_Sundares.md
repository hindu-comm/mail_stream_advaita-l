Dear Sri Venkatesh Murthy,

Many wishes for a happy new common era year in 2015. May I suggest that you should
choose the wording of your mails appropriately, if the intention is not to hurt? It is not
just the tone of the questions you raise, but also the content, which is often problematic.

The nomination of a successor to any of the Sankaracharya Peethams is not a question
of giving a chance to people from different communities. Firstly, it is the decision of the
current Acharya. Secondly, the Acharya can only choose a successor within the candidate
pool that is available. In recent history, the vast majority of brahmacArins who are sent
to Sringeri to study happen to be from Kannada and Telugu speaking communities, not
Iyers or Nambudiris or Konkanis. Narasimha Sastri, who became Swami Chandrasekhara
Bharati (till 1954) was born in a Kannada speaking family, by the way, not Telugu.

Thirdly, please read up on the well documented history of Sringeri over the last six
hundred years or so. There have been, in the past, Acharyas who came from Tamil Nadu
and from Maharashtra as well. Finally, it is not just about scholarship and intelligence.
There are many other qualities over and above these that the selected person has to
satisfy. Suffice it to say that in Sringeri tradition, the current Acharya makes a very careful
choice after observing students over a long time and only announces the decision when
all things fall in place. It is not a decision taken lightly and it has little to do with the
language of the family in which he was born.

Best regards,
Vidyasankar
