Namaste

In Sankara Dig Vijaya also and in the Sankaracarya movie also the other
disciples of Adi Sankara felt Sureshwaracharya was not right person to
write on Sutra Bhashya. They wanted Padmapada to write it. Sureshwaracharya
had to come in his next Janma as  Vachaspati Mishra Avatara to write on
Sutra Bhashya. If even disciples of Adi Sankara can have feeling of Paksha
Pata we Naradhamas can have it also. I am not against any person chosen by
Swamiji. He will be very great Swamiji for Sringeri Peetha. It is not my
intention to hurt feelings of others. I am sorry if someone got hurt.

But I can say there are many bright scholar boys in Iyers, Namboodiris or
Kannada or Tulu or Konkani speaking Brahmins also. They can be given a
chance also. Do they have to take  next birth in AP to get a chance? What
is wrong to ask this?
