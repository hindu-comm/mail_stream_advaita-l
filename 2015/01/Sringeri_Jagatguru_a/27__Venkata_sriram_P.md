Namaste Murthy Ji,

Pls don't rake up controversies that are unknown to us.  

The uttarAdhikAri is chosen which is a "divine intervention" of Mother Sarada.  Swamiji goes inside the sanctum sanctorum, closes the door and bolts from inside to seek the approval of Mother Sarada. 

If Mother Sarada approves, the flower from the Mother's hand drops down. Apart from this, Mother appears in the dream and advices His Holiness to appoint a suitable successor by pointing Her hand towards a vidyArthi in the dream.  

These are couple of signals that are given by Mother Sarada Herself. 

So, there is no room for Iyer / Sastry / Sarma politics involved, as far as Sringeri Peeta is concerned.

reg,
sriram
