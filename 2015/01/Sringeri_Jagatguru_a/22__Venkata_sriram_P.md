Namaste,

One of the joyous moments for us.

Shri Bharati Tirtha Swamiji has announced His uttarAdhikAri in sringeri.  All the rituals of pITArOhaNa would start from 22nd Jan'15 which is followed by mahAvAkya anugraha on 23d Jan'15.

One of the brilliant brahmachArIs of sringeri veda pATashAla shri Kuppa Venkateshwara Prasad has been selected as the uttarAdhikAri who is the son of a great vedic & tarka scholar shrI kuppa siva subramanya avadhani garu, who served as veda pATashAla principal in Keesaragutta, near Hyderabad, and is the veda principal of TTD currently.

Let us all pray our due respects to the jagatguru-dwayam of sringeri now.

regs,
sriram
