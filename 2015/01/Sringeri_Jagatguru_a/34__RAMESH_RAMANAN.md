Dear Members,
Pranams,

i agree with Sri Vidyasankar totally. In fact, we, ordinary people have no business poking our nose into the selection of a successor for Sri Bharathi Theertha Mahaswamigal, who is a towering spiritual personality and even he does not make the choice of his successor on his own. He seeks and gets the blessings of Sri Sharadamba, in accordance with the time-honoured practice established by all the preceding acharyas and only then announces the name of his successor. Spiritual qualities like maturity of the mind, ripeness of dispassion and discrimination, scope for .further spiritual progress, are all considered thoroughly and the one candidate with the highest and best possible potential is selected with the blessings of Sharadamba. We will be committing an apacharam/offence to our Sri Bharathi Theertha Swami and also to Sri Sharadamba by questioning the choice of the successor. We should humbly and joyously bow to his decisions. The post of a Peetadhipathi is not auctionable or transferable in terms of a rotation or shift basis.

When Sri Chandrashekara Bharathi Mahaswami was about to be chosen, there were many disputes within the Matham with many names being discussed. One person was highly qualified in terms of academic and philosophic understanding in theory, but he seems to have been a shady and dubious character. Sri Shivabhinava Sachchidhananda Bharathi Mahaswami seems to have said that instead of nominating him as successor the Math would be better off without a successor. So, there lies the issue. Choosing someone as a spiritual successor is not the same as choosing a political successor. There can be no politics in spiritual choices. Ramesh Ramanan.

 Namaste,
The question has come to the wrong place. It should have been addressed to the Sringeri Math. Secondly all the answers are at best only guesswork. So let's close this thread and keep on keepin on the path of discussing advaita vedanta. Can we resolve to keep 2015 away from partisan thoughts. I know the 'vyavaharic satta' impels one to jump with such questions and its easily said than done to curb it. But as Bhagavan said - "..abhyAsena tu kaunteya vairAgyeNa cha gR^ihyate "(BG 6 / 35)

 Dear all,The selection is not on the basis of linguistic or provincial considerations. The spiritual merit of the candidates will be kn own only to the Acharya who has observed them. Only the highest spiritual qualifications matter in the selection of successors to the Peetham. We should not superimpose our petty minds on the Acharya and assume that he has selected a native Telugu speaker as he himself is a native Telugu. Acharyas are above considerations of language. What is the guarantee that the nambooodiris and iyers are equally spiritually qualified, though they may even be better qualified than the chosen candidate in terms of academic and intellectual skills? I am a Tamil and will accept any candidate chosen by Acharya without questioning. We should respect the Acharya's choice and wait for the successor's performance in due course. Only then, we will know whether the Acharya was right or wrong. Ramesh

 Dear All,

Soon after announcing the name of the successor designate, HH the Jagadguru
made a remark:

Upon coming to the pīṭham one will not have feelings like 'I belong to this
or that locality, etc.' The attitude will be:

अयं निजः परो वेति गणना लघुचेतसाम् |
उदारचरितानां तु वसुधैव कुटुम्बकम् ||

The conditioned thinking that 'this is mine and that is not' is that of the
immature. Those endowed with a broad mentality will view the entire
universe as their own.

It was significant that the Jagadguru said the above. True to that saying,
the Acharyas who occupied the Pīṭham have endeared themselves to people of
all linguistic and provincial denominations. They have addressed
gatherings in Tamil, Kannada, Telugu, Hindi and Sanskrit. On a daily basis
they interact with innumerable devotees in these languages.
