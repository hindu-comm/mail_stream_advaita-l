 Dear all,The selection is not on the basis of linguistic or provincial considerations. The spiritual merit of the candidates will be kn own only to the Acharya who has observed them. Only the highest spiritual qualifications matter in the selection of successors to the Peetham. We should not superimpose our petty minds on the Acharya and assume that he has selected a native Telugu speaker as he himself is a native Telugu. Acharyas are above considerations of language. What is the guarantee that the nambooodiris and iyers are equally spiritually qualified, though they may even be better qualified than the chosen candidate in terms of academic and intellectual skills? I am a Tamil and will accept any candidate chosen by Acharya without questioning. We should respect the Acharya's choice and wait for the successor's performance in due course. Only then, we will know whether the Acharya was right or wrong. Ramesh

 Dear All,

Soon after announcing the name of the successor designate, HH the Jagadguru
made a remark:

Upon coming to the pīṭham one will not have feelings like 'I belong to this
or that locality, etc.' The attitude will be:

अयं निजः परो वेति गणना लघुचेतसाम् |
उदारचरितानां तु वसुधैव कुटुम्बकम् ||

The conditioned thinking that 'this is mine and that is not' is that of the
immature. Those endowed with a broad mentality will view the entire
universe as their own.

It was significant that the Jagadguru said the above. True to that saying,
the Acharyas who occupied the Pīṭham have endeared themselves to people of
all linguistic and provincial denominations. They have addressed
gatherings in Tamil, Kannada, Telugu, Hindi and Sanskrit. On a daily basis
they interact with innumerable devotees in these languages.

regards
