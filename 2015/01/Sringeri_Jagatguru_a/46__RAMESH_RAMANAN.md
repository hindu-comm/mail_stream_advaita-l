Namaskarams,
Do you mean to say that the in-coming Shankaracharya must sit at the computer/laptop and click the mouse and send emails to all his followers? The Maths established by Sri Shankara are very orthodox and I definitely do not see this happening even after another 300 years, forget about right now. I think Bharathi Theertha Mahaswami has guided many of his devotees silently in his own way in spiritual life and I expect the same approach from the new Shankaracharya also. I do not think that he will make a marked departure from the established traditions and practices. So, if you are expecting any such change, just forget it right now. I am not being rude (i have no intention of hurting anyone), but being practical. May be, they could ask the manager or administrator to dash off emails to devotees, but only that much can be expected. Ramesh Ramanan.

 Namaste,

I do not understand that instead of getting happy on hearing this news,
some are always questioning.

Sanyasins are taught to remain silent. It is the duty of householders to
approach them, but instead we want everything at the click of mouse. It is
like a river changing her course to quench thirsty.

Sanyasins are often tagged as 'corporate gurus' as they keep expanding
their foundation. After a certain level of expansion, the founder looses
his grip over foundation and then the corruption begins.

I personally believe that if you take initiative yourself, then this karma
is bound to be a sakAma karma though you keep saying it is nishkam karma.
AS one progresses spiritually, desires are uprooted, even the sAttvika
ones, and one becomes absolutely neutral. It is staying in this state of
neutrality that produces powerful aura, which in-turn is responsible of our
feeling of 'peace' in their presence. It is this 'neutral' state of mind
that helps us transcend 3 guNa-s

Sanyasins are the once who are an inspiration to us, but it is always us
who keep questioning them, the way they have to look, behave, sit, etc.

Now please do not justify this as 'freedom of expression' These phrase has
done much damage to Hindus than most others.

OM
