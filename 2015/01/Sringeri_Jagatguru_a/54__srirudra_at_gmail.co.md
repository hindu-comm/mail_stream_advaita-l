Dear Sri Sujal

You have said that in business corruption or greasing the palms of the Government servants is unavoidable.

May be you are speaking from your experience. But I beg to differ.I am not a business man.From my experience I have found that if you are honest and go by the rules -there are grey areas I know which are pitfalls-one can avoid corruption.Among Government officials including RTOs there are very good people. Only that patience is required and persisistence too.If you are asked to come again donot quarrel do accept and go again.Note down in your diary.Again go on the day prescribed.If it is repeated say a number of times but your papers are ok,you can confront the person and show your record of visits.The person will know you are a hardnut to crack and he will sign your papers.But if you are in an urgent situation this is not possible.That is how greasing the palms comes in.So better plan and avoid last minute approaches is my advice.Otherwise go without it or seek alternative course. I have found that God helps those who help themselves.R.Krishnamoorthy

Namaste,

Well Said Jaldhar Bhai,

As I have said earlier, use technology to our benefit, but never be a slave
of it. Whenever I feel an 'urge' to sit on pc or to watch TV, I try to
substitute it with chanting mantra OM. By God's grace, if I hold on to
mantra, in few seconds the force of 'urge' decreases. Then it is left to me
whether to watch TV and keep fueling the 'urge' or do something else
connected with spirituality

And by doing so he gives me a model to live my life. Maybe I might never

Though I agree with you that Sringeri Acharya is our role model, we as
housholders must do something that me not be ethically permissible for a
sanyasin. The crux is to have a balance between ethics and practical
solutions. the way I have found out as a businessmen is that it is the
'initiative' taken by us that creates problems. e.g. if I wish to expand my
business, then I may bribe purchase officers, on the other way round if a
Govt officer is asking for a bribe, then it is not my initiative to give
bribe, but someone is asking for a bribe and it is difficult to get rid of
him. So giving what he asks, after negotiations, will be like 'throwing
bone to a dog'. What matters is our initiative and not what we are told by
our seniors or compelled to do. Ofcourse one may raise his/her head and
object the process, so it is left to an individual. For me, living
spiritual life is important, so I have to let go if someone takes away my
hard works credit, but if anyone tries to stop me from meditating or
reading shastras, then I will not compromise, not even a bit.

Those who are practising japa daily will know that it our attachment that
breaks our japa and we get involved in day-2-day issues. So the culprit is
our own dis-satisfied desires.

Sorry for being off topic. Coming back,

There is a saying,

'First you make Habits and then Habits make you' :)

OM

Sujal
