Thank you for clarification. But I have one point. Swamiji Chandrasekhara
Bharati was from Mulukunadu Brahmin community. This is a Telugu speaking
community but living in Karnataka. They use many words from Kannada but the
language is Telugu only. But they do not use Urdu words like Telugu in
other places. But the word Muluku I think is from  Urdu word 'Mulk' meaning
country. According to SK Ramachandra Rao's book on Swamiji Chandrashekhara
Bharati of Sringeri Peetha also he was from Mulukunadu community.

Not only Swamiji Chandrashekhara Bharati of Sringeri Peetha but also

   - Sri Sacchidananda Shivabhinava Narasimha Bharathi
   <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sri_Sacchidananda_Shivabhinava_Narasimha_Bharathi>-
   33rd Jagadguru of Sringeri Sharada Peetham
   <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sringeri_Sharada_Peetham>
   - Sri Abhinava Vidyatirtha
   <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abhinava_Vidyatirtha>- 35th Jagadguru
of Sringeri
   Sharada Peetham <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sringeri_Sharada_Peetham>
   - Sri Sankara Vijayendra Saraswathi
   <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vijayendra_Saraswati>- 70th Jagadguru and
   Junior Seer of Kanchi Kamakoti Peetham
   <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanchi_Kamakoti_Peetham>

The above also are from Mulukunadu Brahmin community. They are Telugu
speaking. Source is -

The last 3 Swamijis plus present Swamiji plus next Swamiji are from Telugu
speaking families. I do not know about earlier Swamijis.
