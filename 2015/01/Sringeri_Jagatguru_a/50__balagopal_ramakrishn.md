Namaste,
Yes, the administrator can apply the modern tools ( internet, mobile telephony etc) to expand the reach ( the existing website* can be improved). Even this group is able to function due to it's (internet's) blessing. Knowingly or unknowingly the very many discussions in this group, mostly by very learned members, is benefitting many who may otherwise may not have much chance to even glance at the existence of this knowledge ( the only way for all souls ( ignorance)) owing to their preoccupations in the secular activities (though our tradition does not differentiate between secularaka karma yoga and spiritual ).
Some of the respectful members of this group must already be either in close contact or in an influential position to urge the administration suitably.
Regards
Balagopal

 Namaste Sri D.V.N. Sharma ji,

Changes are bound to happen. there is no denying it. The question is not
for modernization, but for the 'lack of effort' to reach out to them. Sure
a Guru can use technology, but then the problem is that, due to the fast
life, we have lost patience. There are often incidents when a college girl
or boy will put earphones in head
 and cross road and railway tracks. No wonder, when it comes to railway
tracks, someone will pull them back and they may get a tight slap as a
'wake up call'.

We have become slaves of technology. My nephew will play games on mobile
instead of enjoying the company of family members when we are out for a
dinner in a nearby hotel. His parent and grandparent (got to mention them
too ;) ) will not object his behavior. Even when someone visits our house,
youngsters and even some (modern) elders will have a look at their mobile
every 10 minutes.

In today's world there is no patience, and so tolerance for anything has
reduced too, hence there is no peace. How are you going to stop this
onslaught. Swami ji may ask some of his followers to take up the job, but
then they the purpose if giving direction will be defeated, as the
volunteers themselves, due to intense activity, have become restless.

When you play video game, e.g. first shooter, 3rd person shooter, it
requires reflexes. So mind will run fast along with the character (1sr
person or 3rd person). The game lasts for 15-20 or even 30 minutes. Now
this is like sAdhanA. Imagine you practicing increasing the speed of
thoughts for 30 minutes daily. After certain years what is going to happen?
your mind i.e speed of thoughts will increase. Now how will you arrest
thoughts or atleast decrease the speed of thoughts. No wonder you are going
to suffer from insomnia. You know these days the business of psychiatrist
is the most blooming profession. It is the 'need of an hour'. People get
upset very fast. (and this phenomenon of 'dipping in depression' is
increasing day-by-day. resulting in loss of faith and ... the chain goes on)

Use technology, but don't by it's slave. We must also be able to live
without it. Can you live without watching TV, without mobile, without
internet and without PC for 1 week, even for a day?

Sorry for being off topic, but people will take things out of context, as
against technology means BAN on technology. Criticizing something does not
mean issuing a COMPLETE BAN. It is aimed at restricting it's use so that
we may not become it's slave. 100 % implementation is not possible. If I
tell you, stop watching TV, stop using internet, you will not immediately
stop watching TV and using internet, but will will try to restrict use.
Depending upon the strength of mind and will power, your reduction in usage
of TV or net will depend.

btw, using car as a mode of transport is not a Taboo :)

OM

Sujal
