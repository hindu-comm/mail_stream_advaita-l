Namaste,
You said as follows ;QuoteBut I can say there are many bright scholar boys in Iyers, Namboodiris or
Kannada or Tulu or Konkani speaking Brahmins also. They can be given a
chance also.Unquote
If that is so, why not then, someone from Kashmir to Assam, be also considered for the august position ? Is not the Sringeri Peeth one of the the most prominent Peeth and does it not command respect throughout India?

As regards the Peethadhipatis , it appears that Adi Shankaracharya kept in mind that a person, familiar with the local conditions, could take that responsibiltiy better. According to some accounts, Prithvadhara (also called Hastamaklaka), the son of Prabhakara, hailing from Gokarn in Karnataka, was the choice for the Sringeri peeth. As regards Sureshwaracharya, he appears to have always accompanied Adi Shankaracharya till the latter took samadhi, and later on he acted more like a roving ambassador of Adi Shankaracharya to all the Peethas. That could also be the reason why more than one Peetha associate him with them.
Now I have a question. Where did you find that Sureshvaracharya had to take a birth to become Vacaspati Mishra in order to write the Sutra-bhashya ? Of course, there is no denying that some scholars have pointed out that Vacaspati Mishra had a soft corner for Sureshvaracharya.

Regards,

In Sankara Dig Vijaya also and in the Sankaracarya movie also the other
disciples of Adi Sankara felt Sureshwaracharya was not right person to
write on Sutra Bhashya. They wanted Padmapada to write it. Sureshwaracharya
had to come in his next Janma as Vachaspati Mishra Avatara to write on
Sutra Bhashya. If even disciples of Adi Sankara can have feeling of Paksha
Pata we Naradhamas can have it also. I am not against any person chosen by
Swamiji. He will be very great Swamiji for Sringeri Peetha. It is not my
intention to hurt feelings of others. I am sorry if someone got hurt.

But I can say there are many bright scholar boys in Iyers, Namboodiris or
Kannada or Tulu or Konkani speaking Brahmins also. They can be given a
chance also. Do they have to take next birth in AP to get a chance? What
is wrong to ask this?
