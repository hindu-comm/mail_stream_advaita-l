//It seems that this link also contains the Sthothra/Shloka that the newly 
selected Swamiji Sri Vidhushekara Bharathi used to worship
Sri Bharathi Theertha MahaSwami. //

Sri Vidhushekhara Bharathi chanted this shloka about his Guru in his 
anugraha bhAshaNam
"ajnAnam jAhnavi tIrtham vidyAtIrtham vivEkinAm
sarveshAm sukhadam tIrtham bhArati tIrtham AshrayE"

Hope this was what you were referring to. He also did pAda pUja for his 
guru - I couldn't follow the archana in the video. 

Sri Gurubhyo namah
