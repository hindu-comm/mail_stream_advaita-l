Dear all,Pranams,I got this link from a member on our advaita vedanta board. It seems that this link also contains the Sthothra/Shloka that the newly selected Swamiji Sri Vidhushekara Bharathi used to worship Sri Bharathi Theertha MahaSwami. I am not able to see this on my computer, as the video software on my computer is not functioning properly. RAmesh Ramanan.

Dear Ramesh,
I saw in the advaita someone enquiring about the slokas recited by the Junior pontiff of Sringeri Mutt. Perhaps you could see this and forward the same.
Hare Krishna. Jai Shri Radhey Krishna!
