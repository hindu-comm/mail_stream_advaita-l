Dharma is based on shruti, smrti, and shistachara.  To strictly follow the 
sUtra without current practices would actually be the _opposite_ of 
orthodox.  And Maharshi Paraskara would be the first to agree.  For 
instance in discussing the appropriate age for Upanayana, the sutra says:

aShTavarShaM brAhmaNamupanayediti | garbhA.aShTame vA |  ...  yathA 
ma~NgalaM vA sarveShAm |

"A Brahmana should receive upanayana at 8 years.  Or eight from 
conception.[1] [Then after giving the ages for Kshatriyas and Vaishyas] 
Or for all[2] whenever it is auspicious."

[1] i.e. the nine months of pregnancy can be counted as one year making 
seven the right age.

[2] All the traivarnikas that is.

In the last sutra "whenever it is auspicious" is understood to mean 
"according to Shistachara." This is just one example to show there is 
quite a bit of flexibility (though hardly anything goes.)  My son is ten 
years old.  When he was younger he had a speech impediment that would have 
left him unable to pronounce the mantras correctly.  The doctors said that 
it would clear up by itself so we decided to wait until it did and I don't 
believe we violated any norms by doing so.  Still, in the main, the vidhi 
will follow the sUtra.  One notable exception is that the brahmachAris' 
upavastra is supposed to be a kR^iSNAjIna or skin of a black antelope. 
Quite apart from finding such a thing, contemporary Hindu norms are dead 
set against leather items being allowed into sacred areas.  This is 
another example of why we have to look at tradition and consult elders not 
just read books.

"pIThI choLwu" or haridra snana is considered an integral part of this 
ceremony nowadays so we will be doing that.  The varghoDA procession is 
more to do with marriage not janoi.  There are some other "folk" 
traditions which will be done as well.

Yes the prayoga books describe this as "sUtrokta trikAlasandhyA" and this 
is usually the way I do sandhyavandana.  My guruji said most of the other 
stuff that is added today is to do with the upasana of Gayatri Devi and is 
of tantric origin.  Nevertheless he taught me the full way too.  I don't
regard one as being more "authentic" than the other as both are supported by
shistachara.

Yes please do (to my personal address not the list.  The list server will 
reject it.)

According to the prayoga books I have, the minimum is 12,000.  (About 111 
malas.)

The samkalpa for this vidhi suggests that doing this japa absolves the 
father of defects in their dvijatva and confers the adhikara to perform 
upanayana for their son.
