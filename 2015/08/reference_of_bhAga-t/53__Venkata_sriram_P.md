Namaste,

Sri.Bellamkonda Rama Raya Kavi, while interpreting the "tat-tvaM-asi" 
mahAvAkya, has said that this points towards advaita only which is
also the vyAsa nirNaya.  He cites a reference sloka from skAnda purANa 
(vide 70th chapter of kAshi mAhAtmya) to prove that the sage veda vyAsa has 
upheld the use of bhAga-tyAga lakSaNa in interpreting the mahAvAkya.

The slokas are given below:

pratyagbOdhO ya AbhAti sO(a)dvayAnanda lakSaNaH /
advayAnandarUpO yassa pratyagbOdhalakSaNaH //

itthaM anyOnyatAdAtmya pratipattiryadA bhavEt
aikyajnAnaM yadOtpannaM mahAvAkyEna cha AtmanOH //

tattvamasyAdi vAkyESu lakSaNA bhAgalakSaNA /
sO(a)yaM ityAdi vAkyasya padayOriva nAparE //

The above 3 slokas are from skAnda purANa which is vyAsa virachita.

Which implies that the "tat-tvaM-asi" mahAvAkya points towards 
jIva-brahma-abhEda tattva which was approved by vyAsa Himself.

However, I need the exact location of these slokas in kAshi mAhAtmya.

Grateful if the source can be shown.

sriram
