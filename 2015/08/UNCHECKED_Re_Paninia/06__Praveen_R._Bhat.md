Namaste, Siva Senani ji,

Thank you so much for the detailed explanations. I am just a beginner in
Paninian grammar and so I cannot claim to have understood well everything
you explained, especially due to lack of exposure to Niruktam. Also sorry
about the typo of मनिन् instead of मनिण् the very cause for वृद्धिः being
णिति परतः !


Our Sanskrit teacher keeps telling us of some words seeming non-derivable
now as "पृषोदरादिवत् साधु", thanks for that reference too.

Kind rgds,
--Praveen R. Bhat

> 4.584) --> आत्मन् (पृषोदारिद्वात्) (This dhatu was used because the verb

> Since Niruktam is the science of etymology and since the word AtmA is

> the use of यथा (which occurs in the twelve words classified as "upamas" in
> the NighaNTu 3.13) offers three mantras as examples. The last example is
> the Rk आत्मा यक्ष्मस्य नश्यति पुरा जीवगृभो यथा (10.97.11) [1]. While
> explaining this mantra, Yaskaacaarya gives the etymologies of the word AtmA
> - and these are closed to the Smriti quoted by Bhagavatpada. Yaska's words
> are (3.3.15): आत्माऽततेर्वाऽऽप्तेर्वाऽपिवाप्त इव स्याद् यावद्व्याप्तिभूत
> इति।
> Here Yaska offers the etymology of AtmA from two roots - अततेः, आप्तेः .
> These are explained by Durgaacaarya (the commentator of Niruktam) as
> सर्वमेव हि तेनातितं भवति, सर्वगतत्वात्। Here the derivation given by Sri
> Praveen Bhat fits in, only the uNAdipratyaya is held to be maniN (मनिण्)
> [2]. The second derivation in Nirukta is explained by Durgaacaarya as
> सर्वमेव हि तेन व्याप्तं भवति सर्वगतत्वादेव। Here the derivation is not
> offered by Durgaacaarya, but Mukund Jha Sharma who wrote a Niruktavivritti
> (following the commentary of Durgaacaarya) gives the following Vyutpatti (p
> 136): व्याप्तर्थस्याप्धातोः (स्वा० प०) (i.e आप् व्याप्तौ) मनिनि पस्य तत्वं
> पृषोदरादित्वात् [3]। That is: आप् + मनिन् --> आत् (पृषोदरादित्वात्) + मन्
> (अनुबन्धलोपः) --> आत्मन् । For the two other roots also, we have to resort
> to पृषोदरादीनि यथोपदिष्टानि ॥6.3.109॥ or बाहुलकम् as indicated by Sri
> Praveen Bhat.
> As Patanjali indicates in the Mahabhashya (under 3.3.1), the Unaadi
> pratyayas are an attempt to respect the views of Yaaska and SaakaTaayana
> who believe that all nouns are derived from verbal roots. Further, "that
> which is not said to be derived from base and affix must be imagined" (यन्न
> पदार्थविशेषसमुत्थं प्रत्ययतः प्रकृतेश्च तदूह्यम्॥). So having given one
> pratyaya मनिण् to derive आत्मन् further pratyayas are not listed, as there

> [1]. The meaning of this Rk is: As I praise these medicines and take them
> in hand (यदिमा वाजयन्नहमोषदीर्हस्ते आदधे।), the AtmA of the disease is
> destroyed before [the administration of the medicine], i.e the disease will
> not recur, just like the AtmA of a captured bird [perishes before it is
> actually killed] (आत्मा यक्ष्मस्य नश्यति पुरा जीवगृभो यथा).
> [2] In the sUtra सातिभ्यां मनिन्मनिणौ, the principle of yathAkramam is
> applied. Therefore मनिन् is taken after षो  अन्तकर्मणि (सा + मनिन् -->
> सामन्) and मनिण् is taken after अत सातत्यगमने. The इत् "ण्" in मनिण् serves
> the purpose of satisfying the condition णिति for application of अत
> उपधायाः॥7.2.116॥
> [3] According to the sUtra पृषोदरादीनि यथोपदिष्टानि ॥6.3.109॥, Panini
> teaches that the open-ended list of words starting with Prishodara (one who

> SishTas. In other words, these words cannot be analyzed and their form
> cannot be derived.
