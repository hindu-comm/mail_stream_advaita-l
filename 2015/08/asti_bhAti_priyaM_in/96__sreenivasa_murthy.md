Respected Sir,
 It is rather surpring to see that so much of unnecessary discussions, explanations, arguements, counter arguements-are going on about the undeniable vastu whose svarUpa is Knowing is Being & Being is Knowing, self-evident, self-established, AvirBavatirOBAvavarjita and AgamApAyirahita. YOU are that vastu. 
When one writes something YOU are illumining the words / sentences appearing as thoughts and putting those thoughts on paper. YOU exist PRIOR to the appearance of these thoughts which are being illumined by YOU. By pratyagdRuShTi one can realise this fact within oneself by oneself. Kathopanishad says : AvRuttacakShuH .Mother Sruti says : AtmanyEvAtmAnam paSyati ||Please do this sAdhana and see for yourself whether all these verbal exchanges are necessary or not. What a mystery that a simple fact like this is overlooked!

With respectful namaskarams,Sreenivasa Murthy

Dear
Bhathi is light that is illumination.The object has to show that it is there.If it is an inert object then it's bhathi will be reflected light.Its capacity to reflect the light shone on it however poor it may be may be taken as its bhathi.Na thathra suryo bhathi na Chandra tharakam nema vidhyuthothi bhanthi kuthoyam Agni:..........Sarvamidham vibhathi.This sloka speaks about bhathi which means illumination or light.
The object's existence is to be felt by any one of the five senses of the perceiving entity.This inherent thing in an object can be taken to mean bhathi .Priyam is the relationship developed between the object and the perceiver which is due to avidhya.
These three are adhidaivam aspects so to say.Nama and rupam are Jiva made.These are Maya oriented.This is what my understanding of the sloka.R.Krishnamoorthy.
