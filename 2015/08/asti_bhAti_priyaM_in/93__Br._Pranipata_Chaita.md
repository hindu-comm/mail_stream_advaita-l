>Then how does bhAti (in the verse) is explained? -- durga prasad

One should understand the term bhAti as (anu)bhAti.

The bhAShya to the question - kiM u bhAti vibhAti vA and its answer - taM eva bhAntaM anubhAti sarvaM (kaThA II.ii.14&15) will throw more light how - idaM sarvaM tasya bhAsA vibhAti.

Hari Om! Pranipata
