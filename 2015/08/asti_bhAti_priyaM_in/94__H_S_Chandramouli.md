Sri *Br. Pranipata Chaitanya* Ji,


Pranams.


Reg your observation << One should understand the term bhAti as (anu)bhAti.

The bhAShya to the question - kiM u bhAti vibhAti vA and its answer - taM
eva bhAntaM anubhAti sarvaM (kaThA II.ii.14&15) will throw more light how -
idaM sarvaM tasya bhAsA vibhAti. >> ,


( anu ) bhAti would be appropriate when only the nAma rUpa aspects are
included in the reference to object/experience. However in the verse under
consideration , the bhAntaM aspect of taM is included as an aspect of the
object/experience itself by use of the term bhAti as one of the five
aspects. Hence in this context , in my opinion , use of the term bhAti is
appropriate and should not be understood as (anu)bhAti.


Respectfully submitted


Pranams and Regards


Chandramouli
