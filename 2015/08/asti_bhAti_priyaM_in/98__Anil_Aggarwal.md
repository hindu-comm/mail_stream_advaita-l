Finally one can know oneself only via reflections - it is similar to - I can recognize the presence of original sunlight (saakshii)by looking at the luminous moon in the sky and RECOGNIZING OR REALIZING that the luminosity is due to sunlight that I cannot see otherwise other than via reflections. The same is applied to the mind that acts like a conscious entity or pramaata.

Bhaati is also used in the same sense and hence Pranipataji made that statement since the SAT part of the inert is reflected as asti -  while the chit part is vai illumination by the conscious subject since existence of an object is established by knowledge of its existence.. Please think about it. The statement I think comes from Advaita Makaranda of Lakshmidhara kavi.
