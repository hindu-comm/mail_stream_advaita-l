Namaste,

My friend, guide, philosopher by name shri.yanamandra srinivasa sarma delivered discourse in sanskrit on NADA UPASANA.  He is a great scholar of sanskrit, music, mantra shAstra and is a srividya upAsaka.  He learnt Rg-veda kramam under his father shri.yanamandra venugopala sastry garu (srividya deeksha name "sriyAnandanAtha") who is an authority in chaNDi-yAga and Agama shAstra.  Later, learnt yajurveda followed by deep study of nyAya, tarka and vedanta under mahAmahOpAdhyAya vishwanAtha gopalakrishna sastry garu.  

Here are the links.  The discourses are in sanskrit.
