Namaste Subbuji,

He had delivered the same in sanskrit too.  I think wrong link has been posted.  
I would find out and let know.  I am in touch with Sri.Sarma Garu.  

He is a great nAdOpAsaka and a great scholar of sanskrit who was awarded 
Ph.D in sahitya and alamkara from Rashtriya Sanskrit Samsthan, Tirupathi.

He also composes & tunes kritis in sanskrit that are sung by famous Malladi Brothers.

One such kriti on vAk dEvata is "kAmadhEnukAM AshrayE..." was composed by Sarma Garu's father 
which was sung by Malladi Brothers in USA during their live concert.

regs,
sriram
