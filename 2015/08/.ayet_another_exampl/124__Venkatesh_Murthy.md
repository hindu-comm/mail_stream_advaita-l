Namaste

OR the reason may be the blogger of Narayanastra may be confused to
think Advaitis and Smaartas are the same. All Smaartas are Advaitis
because they accept Adi Sankara as the Guru and his philosophy. But
there are some Advaitis accepting Adi Sankara and his philosophy but
not following Smaarta customs. They may be born in Vaisnava, Saiva or
Sakta families but become Advaitis philosophically like Sri SK
Ramachandra Rao. He was a great Advaiti born in Madhva family.
