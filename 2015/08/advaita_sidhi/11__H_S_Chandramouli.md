Dear Sri Anand Ji,

I came across a work " advaiatasidhi sarasamgraham " by Sri Swaminathan at
the link  << http://www.advaita-vedanta.org/sarada/Siddhi.pdf >> . Is this
a  translation of the complete Advaita Sidhi of Sri madhusudhana Saraswathi
 or a condensed version of it.

Regards

Chandramouli
