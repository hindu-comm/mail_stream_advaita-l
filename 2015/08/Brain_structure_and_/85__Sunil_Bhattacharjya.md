Yes, it has long been known that there occurs physiological changes in the brain with its use. It was reported long ago that the brain size of the London Taxi-drivers was generally bigger than that of the common people as the taxi-drivers have to remember the details of the many roads in that city.

 Dears
This is just to inform our members that there is an e book by one Norman Doidge which deals with plasticity of human brain.He has said even if one hemisphere of the brain is removed the other half can be made to take over the functions of the lost side to a creditable extent.It requires some conscious effort by the patient helped by a Neuro specialist.He says music plays an important part and the ear according to him has evolved into brain as part of evolution.The book gives anecdotes of such people who were affected by brain injuries ,diseases like Alzheimer's and dementia but we're able to lead a tolerably normal life thanks to brain plasticity.The brain does change itself by developing new glial and neuronal circuits by proper stimuli through touch,music/ sounds and conscious efforts to move limbs which were earlier not movable.
This is nothing to do with advaita but I thought some members who are also interested in the function of brain apart from Vedantha can get interested.

One has to reinterpret them without stepping on to the things where objective tools are no more valid particularly in the analysis of subtle things like mind, thoughts, and of course consciousness.
