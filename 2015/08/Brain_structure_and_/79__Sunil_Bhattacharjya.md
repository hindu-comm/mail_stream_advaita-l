Om Namo Bhagavate Vasudevaya
Dear Shri Bhatji,
You have asked a very important question about the relation of Buddhi and Atma. Let me try to reply to my understanding, as briefly as possible.

The Atman is without body, form, egoism, mind and the senses. and it is not affected by the miseries of the samsara. Being without sensation it appears to be sleeping at the cavity of the heart. The Atman shines in the cavity of the heart, though it pervades all.

The Vedanta (Upanshad) tells us about our body of the five Koshas and the Mind is third Kosha and the 4th and the 5th Koshas are of the Ahamkara and the Buddhi. When with the annihilation of karmaphala the Atman is reflected in the mind, there is dawning of Jnana and the individual self begins to see the mahabhootas, the sense objects, the mind, the ahmakara and the buddhi and in fact all the five koshas or sheaths, reflected in itself. By merging the grosser elements in the finer elements, such as merging the senses in the mind, merging the mind in the ego, merging the ego in the Buddhi, merging the Buddhi in the Maya and the Maya in the individual self and finally the individual self in the Supreme self, there is the oneness, the emancipation. The Lord has told us the ways of the yoga for achieving this.

Regards,Sunil KB

Pranaams Sadaji,
True. For a moment I remembered the very special diet Br. Up. asks the pregnant mother to take if she wanted her child to learn all the four Vedas. That diet is, of course, forbidden in the Kali yuga.

Regards,Sunil

Sunilji - PraNAms. These are fishing expeditions. Correlation of gross mater with subtle entities. They can only be proven if converse is made true as necessary and sufficient condition.

Hari Om!
