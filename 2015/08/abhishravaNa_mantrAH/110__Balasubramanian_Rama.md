The yAjuSha-mantra-ratnAkara published by the now defunct vaidikavardhinI
press (republished as a facsimile copy in recent times) has the
abhishravaNa mantrAH. I heard that the karnataka tradition has a different
set of mantrAH. Is this true?

Is there any source text describing the arrangement of mantrAH?

Thanks for any information.

Rama
