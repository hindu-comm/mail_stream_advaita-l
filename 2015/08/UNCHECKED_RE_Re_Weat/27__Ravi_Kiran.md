Yes, precisely, when there is no body (upAdhi) to experience in sushupti,
how can one experience ajnAna in sushupti  :-) ? If ajnAna cannot be
established by experience in sushupti, why deprive the perfect  brahmee
sthithi drstAnta of sushupti, in jAgrat for manana?

Yes, understand that Mandukya prakriya is different from rest of the
bhAshya (Chandogya, Brihadaranyaka, Prasna etc). The purport is not lost,
if we look at the sushupti experience for manana and not limit it to an
ajnAna avastha...

Yes, as that which is available in sushupti is present verily in jAgrat and
svapna  and realizing that sushupti in jAgrat through ....
