Namaste,
If Ganesh puja is the issue, there is a way out. Ganesh puja on the Ganesh-jayanti day is equally effective. That day is around February each year. Your friend will be able to convince his priests on this. The Navaratri also has two such periods several months apart : the Vasanti-Navaratri and Sharadiya-Navaratri.
Don't worry about what the dvaitins say. There is saying. If one lights more lamps in the Diwali, your neighbours may say that one is showing off and if one lights less lamps in Diwali, people may say that one is a miser. Normally one takes the help of the priest to decide if any problems arise and what priest recommends is taken as the Brahma-vakya.

  Namaste

I am trying answer a difficult question. Kindly help me.

In our Sastras they say Pitrus are Pratyaksha Devatas reference
'Maatrudevo Bhava Pitrudevo Bhava' and so on. Our Pitrus are visible
Gods. They are seen with Pratyaksha Pramaana. The Gods like Brahma,
Vishnu, Maheshwara are not Pratyaksha but known in the Sastra like
Purana, Veda and so on.

But what happens when there is a contradiction? My friend's father
expired on Ganesha festival day. When his yearly Sraddha comes on
Ganesha festival my friend has to do Vaarshika Sraddha only. There is
no Ganesha festival for him and his family. This means Pratyaksha
Pitru Devata is more important than Apratyaksha Devata like Ganapati.

Dvaitis can say this is showing Pratyaksha is more powerful than other
Pramaanas like Sruti and Purana. This is the Dvaiti's pet theory. If
Adaviti is saying Sruti or Smruti Purana is more powerful the Ganesha
festival must be celebrated on yearly Sraddha day. But only Sraddha is
performed and Ganesha festival is not celebrated.

How to answer this?
