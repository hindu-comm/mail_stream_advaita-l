All questions and explanations are only for the upAdhi-sahita jIva in
jAgrat to have nirupAdhita Brahma jnAna

In the presence of jnAna svarUpa (prajnAna ghaNa), what need is there for
any jnAna or ajnAna ?

when we exist as the sva-svarUpa, why need for jnAna in sushupti?

All jnAna is required in jAgrat where ajnAna is experienced ..

If you experience ajnAna clearly/candidly in deep sleep and you can
describe it, you are surely not in sushupti, you may be in dream or some
mano-avastha :)

All such necessity for cognition of BrahmasvarUpa arises in jAgrat and
hence the importance of sushupti drstAnta for manana in jAgrat, to those
who so wishes to make use of it, to de-invest/de-identify the reality given
to jAgrat :)
