PraNAms to all.

Shree Arsha Avinash has transcribed the B. Geeta talks of Swami Paramarthanandaji with his blessings. There is word-by-word meaning and commentary on the sloka. One can down load the entire book in pdf format-meant for self-study for those who are interested.

Greatful to Arsha Avinash to undertake this monumental work for the benefit of the sincere seekers. The URL is provided below.
