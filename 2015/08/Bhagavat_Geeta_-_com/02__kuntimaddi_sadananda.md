 PraNAms to all.

 Shree Arsha Avinash has transcribed the B. Geeta talks of
 Swami Paramarthanandaji with his blessings. There is
 word-by-word meaning and commentary on the sloka. One can
 down load the entire book in pdf format-meant for self-study
 for those who are interested.

 Greatful to Arsha Avinash to undertake this monumental work
 for the benefit of the sincere seekers. The URL is provided
 below.
