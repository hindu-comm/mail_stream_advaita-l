Namaste all , 

Very rare are followers of jaiminIya shAkhA of sAmavedaM , following podt have rare ' jaiminIya sAmaveda rUdraM' text .Following text is entirely different from that of kauThuma  and rAnAyanIya shAkhA of sAmavedaM ( That was posted earlier ) ,especially the swaras are marked in different style ( kauThuma  and rAnAyanIya have numerical digits and two or three latters for swara marking ) having only letters  for swara marking .
I request group members to visit the post .
