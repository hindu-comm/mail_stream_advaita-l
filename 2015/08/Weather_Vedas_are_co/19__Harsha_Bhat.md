Ok Sir,
                          I will not mix up the two metaphors,now let us
take the seeing snake in rope example....
When we come to know that it is rope not snake,the snake and hence afraid
because of snake gets remove,,,I accept that....

But the knowledge of rope is realized right ?because of which miss
understanding of snake in rope gets removed right?

So,there should be the knowledge of rope then after .....

Similarly after brahma jgnana (Athma jagrathavasta)...there should be the
knowledge of self after moksha....So,moksha should be waken up state (Athma
jagrathavasta)....after moksha not deep sleep state..where there is no
knowledge of self...

Another thing is ,you compare deep sleep state to moksha,dreaming state to
samsara(jagath)....

Similarly...to which state you compare to waken up state?...is it samsara
or moksha?..or waken up state doen't exist at all??
