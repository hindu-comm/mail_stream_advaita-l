I would qualify your statement and say that it depends on the level of
spiritual maturity of the aspirant. Within advaita tradition, mantra japa
would fall under upAsana, and is an accepted preparatory step required to
earn the qualifications necessary to commence vedAnta shravaNam, mananam
and nidhidhyAsanam.

In answer to Sri Boris' question, hare krishna mantrA is a great mantrA and
if chanted with sincerity and devotion, will greatly advance you in your
spiritual quest.

Regards,
Venkatraghavan
