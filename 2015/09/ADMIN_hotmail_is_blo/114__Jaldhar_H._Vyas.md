Since about the beginning of the month hotmail (and other Microsoft 
properties such as msn.com, outlook.com etc.) have not been delivering 
mail from advaita-l.  I've been investigating and it seems that either 
accidently or maliciously we have ended up on their list of spammers which 
we most assuredly are not.  I am in the process of resolving this with the 
appropriate people and hope to restore service to the affected subscribers 
soon.  I beg you for your patience in the meantime.

[I realize that because of the block you probably won't be able to see 
this but hopefully you are reading the archives or something.]
