Namaste all,


Pujya Swamiji took mahasamadhi at Rishikesh ashram, where he started his
journey into Vedanta, leaving his mortal body at 2220hrs yesterday. As a
great teacher, accessible to all with an open heart, he continues to live
on in the teaching tradition and hundreds of teachers He created worldwide.

I'm inspired much by his दया, compassion, which he showered on all by truly
living up to his name - Swami Dayananda!

निवसतु मयि नित्यम् श्रीगुरोर्दिव्यदृष्टिः। May the Guru's vision of Oneness
always be in me.

Kind rgds,
--Praveen R. Bhat
