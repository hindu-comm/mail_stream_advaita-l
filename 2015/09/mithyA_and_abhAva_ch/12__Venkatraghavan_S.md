Namaste Sri Venkatesh.

I'm not sure if that is their argument, but if it is, I think that would be
a flawed argument - for something to go out of existence, it is not
necessary for the thing it is dependent on to go out of existence.

If that is the case, as Brahman is eternal, everything else that derives
its existence from it also would necessarily be eternal, and nothing can
ever die. However, we do see things being born and things dying. Therefore,
if things depend on BhagavAn for their existence, their death does not
necessitate BhagavAn's death. It simply means that the existence that
BhagavAn lends to them is withdrawn.

VedAs' nityatvam is also mithyA only - their existence is only in
vyavahAra, they have no independent existence in paramArtha. BrihadAraNyaka
shruti says यत्र वेदा अवेदाः, because in paramArtha, Vedas have no
independent existence.

Regards
Venkat
