What happens to Adhama Adhikari, you did not say. Because this type of
people is more than 99%. To them we have to say yes the snake is real
and it will bite you if you don't follow our rules. If you follow the
rules it will protect you. This is the Dvaitis method.

Most of the religions are to prevent people behaving like brutes. It
is simple. If a person cannot control himself and behaves like a brute
he must be afraid of God. But if a person can control himself and not
behave like a brute himself he will not have to be afraid of anybody.
