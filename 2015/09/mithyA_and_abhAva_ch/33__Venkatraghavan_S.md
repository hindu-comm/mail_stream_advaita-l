Namaste.

Sri GaudapAdAcharya refers to hIna, madhyama and utkrishta sAdhakas in the
advaita prakaraNa of MandUkya KArika (3.16) :

आश्रमास्त्रिविधा हीनमध्यमोत्कृष्टदृष्टयः ।
उपासनोपदिष्टेयं तदर्थमनुकम्पया ॥

There are three kinds of adhikAris - hIna (weak), average (madhyama) and
excellent (utkrishta), based on their intellect. Out of compassion, upAsana
has been prescribed for them (the weak and average candidates) .

Sri ShankarAchArya explains in his bhAshya of this kArika that upAsana
(devotion or discipline) and karma have been prescribed  specifically for
the madhyama and manda adhikAris:

उपासना उपदिष्टा इयं तदर्थं
मन्दमध्यमदृष्ट्याश्रमाद्यर्थं कर्माणि च।
