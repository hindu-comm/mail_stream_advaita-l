Namaste

In the Mandukya Karika Sri Gaudapada has said 'Adavante Ca Yan Nasti
Vartamane'pi Tattatha'. The thing not existing in the beginning and
end but only in the middle present time is not existing now also. If a
thing has a Pragabhava प्रागभाव before and a Pradhvamsabhava
प्रधव्ंसाभाव after it gets destroyed ignorant people think it is
existing in the middle period. But Sri Gaudapada has said even in the
middle period also it is not existing. Therefore the words like
प्रागभाव and प्रध्वंसाभाव have no meaning.

The word Abhava अभाव also is meaningless Paramarthataha परमार्थतः.
Why? Because you can say something is absent if it is different from
Sat. But Sat is never absent and there is nothing different from it
and only Sat is there.
