And Sri Venkataraghavan said -
'If B is non different from A, but appears to be different, i.e the
difference is only an illusion, then as long as the illusion is
perceived, you can say that the dependent thing is eternal in the
lower order of reality (illusion) but not in the highest order of
reality (the truth). The independent thing is eternal in all orders of
reality, but it can be the ONLY eternal, independent thing.'

I think the difference between the two sides is Dvaitis also say the
Svatantra Satya has Pravrutti according to His own Sveccha. He can act
as He wants. But Paratantra Satya Jeeva cannot act as he wants. He has
to follow rules made by Svatantra Satya.

Advaitis cannot agree to this because if you say Svatantra Satta means
freedom to act as you like this is not Brahman. Brahman cannot have
any action. It is Actionless in Advaita. But in Dvaita the Para Brahma
Vishnu will act. He is born again and again. Sambhavaami Yuge Yuge.
