Venkatesh Murthy Sir,
                                         You said,

///Cit is the Jeeva. Jeeva is Brahman in Advaita.

That means,chit is brahman...or in other words,chit is not mithya but it is
sathya...or very brahman...

So,in advaita chit is sathya...that means brahman can be categorisable..as
chit swarupi...

If brahman is chit swarupi,how can brahman is  non-categorisable?

As unpanishad says brahman is non-categorisable....

regards,
Harsha  Bha
