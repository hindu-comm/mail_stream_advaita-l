Hari Om,

Pranams.

For the last few days, I am not getting emails from Advaita-l mailing list.

In the archives, I saw the following in one of the emails on the subject:

"Good point, but here the question is not whether VedAs are svatantram or paratantram, but whether they have svatantra sattA or paratantra sattA?
If something depends on something else for its existence, it has no independent existence of its own. This is the advaita position: that VedAs themselves have no svatantra sattA- they ultimately have to depend on Brahman for their existence."

Vedas being apauruSeya (अपौरुषेय), the relation between Brahman and Vedas need to be understood carefully. It is discussed in Brahma Sutra: 1.1.3 shAstrayonitvAt (शास्त्रयोनित्वात्) under two heads:

1. (Brahman is omniscient) because of (Its) being the source of the scriptures.

2. (Brahman is not known from any other source), since the scriptures are the valid means of Its knowledge.

"The Vedas are given out by the Supreme Being at the beginning of each cycle of creation without effort as in breathing out. But even He does not have liberty in creating the Vedas. He creates them exactly in the same way as they were in the previous kalpa. That in turn is in the same form as in the kalpa previous to it. Thus the same Vedas are given out again and again in each kalpa. Creation is beginningless and so there is no such thing as the first creation of the Vedas. Though the Supreme Being gives out the Vedas in every kalpa, he has no liberty in creating them. It is because of this lack of absolute freedom in creating that the Vedas are called ‘apaurusheya’."
