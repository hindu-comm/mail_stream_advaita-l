Pondicherry: JUNE 13-14, 2012

Rise in Life Through Dharmic Means

Jagadguru Shankaracharya Sri Sri Bharati Tirtha Mahaswamiji arrived at Pondicherry on 13th June evening.
After Dhuli Pada Puja was performed, Vidwan SLP Anjaneya Sharma read out the Swagata Patrika in Sanskrit
and Sri Ramakrishnan delivered it in Tamil.

In His Anugraha Bhashanam, the Jagadguru said that, while everyone wishes to rise in their lives, many
do not know the path that must be taken to achieve this. There is a Sanskrit verse that humorously says
people resort to even nonsensical antics to attain fame – be they braying like a donkey or even breaking
a pot or tearing apart clothes – 

घटं भिन्द्यात् पटं छिन्द्यात् कुर्याद्वा गर्दभध्वनिम् ।
येन केन प्रकारेण प्रसिद्धपुरुषो भवेत् ॥ 

It is a blunder to try to come up in life by indulging in actions that are prohibited by the Shastras.
It is not wrong to wish to come up in life. However the means to it must be understood well. The means
have been laid down by the Shastras. We have had great ancestors who had accomplished a lot in their lives,
while adhering to the boundaries prescribed by the Shastras. 

Today people mistakenly feel that one cannot come up in life if one sticks to Dharma and Nyaya. Understand
that your fall is imminent if you transgress Dharma and Nyaya. The Jagadguru quoted examples from the
Ramayana and Mahabharata with Sri Rama and Sri Yudhishthira as ideals and Ravana and Duryodhana as
possessing characteristics to be shunned. Sri Rama stood for Dharma and it was Ravana who met his fate
at the hands of Sri Rama. Yudhishthira had the firm resolve to undergo suffering to any extent for the
sake of upholding Dharma while Duryodhana amassed and enjoyed what was not his, by unjust means. He met
with such a fate that he had none of his kith and kin to even perform his last rites. Yudhishthira himself
performed his last rites. 

The Jagadguru pointed out our implicit faith in Dharma is demonstrated by the fact that though
five thousand years have passed since the time of the Mahabharata, and eons have passed since the time
of Sri Rama, we only name our children after Sri Rama and Dharmaraja. No child is named Ravana or Duryodhana
as they are Adharmikas. We do not wish to even utter their names. The greatness of the name of Sri Rama is
highlighted in a verse that when one opens the mouth to utter the syllable “ra”, our sins are pushed out
through the mouth, while they are stopped from reentering when we utter the next syllabe “ma” – 

राशब्दोच्चाराणादेव मुखान्निर्यान्ति पातकाः ।
पुनः प्रवेशभीत्यात्र मकारस्तु कवाटवत् ॥

This greatness is because Sri Rama was an exemplar of Dharma. The Vedas state that Dharma has the power
to remove sins – 

धर्मो विश्वस्य जगतः प्रतिष्ठा । लोके धर्मिष्ठं प्रजा उपसर्पन्ति । धर्मेण पापमपनुदति । धर्मे सर्वं प्रतिष्ठितम् । तस्माद्धर्मं परमं वदन्ति ।

Dharma must be adhered to for the welfare of the entire world for Dharma is the foundation of the world.
People seek those who adhere to Dharma. Everything rests on Dharma and hence Dharma is regarded as Supreme. 

Sri Rama’s greatness is summed up by a statement – रामो विग्रहवान् धर्मः – Rama was Dharma personified. The reason for
mentioning this is that when people wish to come up in life, they must do so by Dharmic means. 

Be it wealth or status, a time will come when they will be of no use. Sri Adi Shankaracharya has also
pointed out in His Bhashya that only one who adheres to Dharma will be revered as a Mahatma. 

The Jagadguru reiterated that the Shastras are not against the acquisition of wealth. However they point
out the means to such acquisition has to be Dharmic – न्योपार्जितवित्तेन कर्तव्यं ह्यात्मरक्षणम् । It is perfectly fine to earn
wealth by Dharmic means, enjoy it and engage in charity. Money that flows in through unjust means will
flow out as quickly as it arrived. 

Most people do not realize that one may be able to escape the long arm of the law but can never cheat
Ishwara who is witness to all our actions and resides in our hearts – 

ईश्वरः सर्वभूतानां हृद्देशेऽर्जुन तिष्ठति ।
भ्रामयन् सर्वभूतानि यन्त्रारूढानि मायया ॥

Even though the Puranas describe myriad sufferings in store for various kinds of sins committed, no one
realizes that he is answerable to Yama, the Lord of Dharma after death. Instead, people brush this off
nonchalantly. Not a single person has taken to heart the fact that they have to face the consequences of
their Adharmic actions.

If you are an Astika, you must not overlook this fact. So if you wish to hold your head high in front of
Ishwara after death, stay away from Adharma. In the Mahabharata, when Sanjaya narrated that Abhimanyu was
mercilessly and cunningly killed by six powerful warriors (Atirathas) led by Duryodhana, even Dhritarashtra
was unable to bear it. He expressed great regret at this unjust act and said, “What answer would I be able
to give if, after death, the Lord asks me to justify this act of my son?”. Sanjaya replied “This is not
the only question that you will have to face, O King! You will also be answerable to a number of other
questions related to past events: Why did you cooperate when a plan was hatched to murder the Pandavas
in the palace made of lac? Why did you allow Draupadi to be humiliated in your court? Please prepare
answers for all these quesitons, O King!” 

This illustration is relevant to bring about the understanding that no wrong-doer can escape from the Lord.
One may have wealth, power and fame on earth and thousands of followers to do one’s bidding and think that
he is unquestionable. However, none of these will help when you stand in front of Ishwara. You will be alone
and must be prepared to face the consequences. 

Hence be afraid of doing any Adharmic act. Do not muster the courage or will to do Adharma. Have the foresight
to think of the consequences you will have to face if you indulge in Adharma now.

The Shastras point out that it is desire (kama) and anger (krodha) that make one commit an Adharmic act.
Hence take efforts to destroy kama and krodha. The two – kama and krodha – remain inside us and instigate
us to indulge in Adharma resulting in our own suffering. Hence the Lord declares them to be our enemies in
the Gita – 

काम एष क्रोध एष रजोगुणसमुद्भवः ।
महाशनो महापाप्मा विद्ध्येनमिह वैरिणम् ॥ 

The impact of strong desire and intense anger is such that they cloud a person’s sense of judgement.
The strong desire to possess something overpowers the person’s intellect and makes him to do an Adharmic act.
Just as dirt that has settled on a mirror affects its capacity to reflect well, a mind filled with
desire or anger loses its sense of judgement and engages in Adharma. Hence learn to curb desire and anger.
Show your anger upon anger and not on anyone else. If you learn to despise anger, you will never get angry.
Then you lose motivation towards performing Adharma. You will not need to face consequences of performing
Adharma when you goto Paraloka.

The Jagadguru summarized the entire Bhashanam stating that man must rise in life only through Dharmic means.
Only if one stays away from Adharma, will adherence to Dharma be possible. Adharmic actions spring forth
only due to kama (desire) and krodha (anger). One cannot extricate oneself from indulging in Adharmic acts
if one has not controlled kama and krodha. Hence, one must not give way to kama and krodha, stay away from
Adharma and come up in life through Dharmic means. 

The Jagadguru recalled His visit to Pondicherry along with His Guru in 1982, His own visit 25 years back and
blessed the gathering that they remain Dharmikas and attain Shreyas. The Jagadguru then performed the
Sharada Chandramoulishwara Puja.


At the Sringeri Shivaganga Math

On the morning of 14th June 2012, the Jagadguru graced the premises of the Sringeri Shivaganga Math at
Pondicherry and was received with Poornakumbha honours by the Mathadhipati of the Math,
Sri Sacchidananda Bharati Swamiji. The Jagadguru graced the Math on the occasion of the Kumbhabhisheka day
of the shrine of Sri Anjaneya at the Math. 

In His Anugraha Bhashanam, the Jagadguru said that the Sringeri Shivaganga Math is a Shakha (Branch) Math
of the Peetham, and was established by the 24th Acharya of the Sharada Peetham,
Jagadguru Sri Abhinava Narasimha Bharati Mahaswamiji in the 17th century. The Math has since had an
uninterrupted lineage of Gurus who have been beacons of light in matters of Dharma for people in and
around the Shivaganga region near Bangalore in Karnataka. 

The Jagadguru added that, more than a century ago, the then Mathadhipati,
Sri Subrahmanya Abhinava Sacchidananda Bharati Swamiji of the Shivaganga Math had been a recipient of
the Anugraha of His Parameshti Guru, Jagadguru Sri Sacchidananda Shivabhinava Narasimha Bharati Mahaswamiji.
The Swamiji had undertaken tours in the southern parts of the country and had attained Videha Mukti in
Pondicherry. A Samadhi was constructed in Pondicherry, and ever since, a branch of the Shivaganga Math had
sprung up in Pondicherry and has been serving the Astikas in the region. 

The Jagadguru recalled that Sri Sacchidananda Subrahmanya Bharati Swamiji, the Paramaguru of the present
Shivaganga Swamiji, had come to Chennai to perform Padapuja to His Guru,
Jagadguru Sri Abhinava Vidyatirtha Mahaswamiji in 1960, the year in which the Sringeri Jagadguru had
last observed Chaturmasya in Chennai. 

The Jagadguru also described that the present Mathadhipati Sri Sacchidananda Bharati Swamiji as composed
and engaged in Anushtana and striving for the welfare of all. The Swamiji had received Mantra Deeksha from
His Guru, Jagadguru Sri Abhinava Vidyatirtha Mahaswamiji and was deeply devoted to the Acharyas of Sringeri.
The Jagadguru conveyed His blessings for the Swamiji and for all the devotees assembled. The Jagadguru then
had Darshan at the shrine of Sri Anjaneya. Afterwards, the Jagadguru blessed 200 differently abled students
and gave a special Darshan to 2000 children of the Vivekananda School. 

At about 3:30 pm, the Jagadguru started towards Chennai. Enroute the Jagadguru had Darshan of the huge
Panchamukha Anjaneya Swamy at Panchavati in Pondicherry. In their welcome speech, the temple authorities
mentioned that the temple was established due to the blessings of the Jagadguru. The Yantra Pratishtha at
the base of Sri Anjaneya Swamy had been done as per the Jagadguru’s directions. Earlier the Jagadguru also
had Darshan of Sri Valamburi Mahaganapati and Sri Pattabhiramar. The temple also houses a Goshala and the
“Sringeri Sri Sharada Mata Prasada Mandapam” where Annadanam is performed daily. The Jagadguru offered
Vastram to Sri Anjaneya and blessed the gathering with an Anugraha Bhashanam highlighting the greatness
of Sri Anjaneya.
