This verse from the māyāpanchakam of Shankara is relevant here:

Vidhiharihara vibhedham api akhande

Batha virachayya budhaanapi prakaamam

Bhramayathi hari hara bhedha bhaavaan

Aghatitha ghatanaa pateeyasee maayaa



In the absolute, division-less Brahman, Maya, that which makes impossible
possible, creates the various differences of BRAHMĀ, HARI and HARA and
alas, it deludes even great scholars into crafting the differentiation of
HARI and HARA and thereby make them fight amongst each other.
