It is a lot to take in and not all of it will "stick" straight away but we 
think it is important for him to get familiar with all these things as 
soon as possible.

Thankyou for your kind words.

During the shravana masa I have been daily reciting the first sukta of the 
rudradhyaya in which the name also occurs (and the entire 8 adhyayas on 
Mondays) so he has gotten familiar with that too.  Right now with the 
Ganeshotsava going on we have been studying Ganapatiatharvashiras.  Again, 
mastery will be a slow and arduous process but the idea for now is to make 
him atleast aware of the vast ocean of shastra.
