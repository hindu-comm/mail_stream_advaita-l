I've been away from the list for quite a while now because on Jyeshta 
Shukla 7 my son Nilagriva had his Upanayana and Shaiva diksha.  Since then 
we've been spending a couple of hours a day on learning sandhyavandana, 
puja mantras and Sanskrit.  Now that the school year has started we've cut 
back a bit but he still wakes up at 6am and does some adhyayana with me 
before starting the daily routine.  And I've more time for the Internet 
again.  So if you've written to me recently and not gotten an answer, I'm 
not ignoring you and haven't forgotten you.  Expect a response shortly.
