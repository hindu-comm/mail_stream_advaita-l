Dear Sri Jaldhar ji,

It is very heartening to note that you have initiated your son at the right
age.  Pl. keep up the tempo of all that you have started: svādhyāya,
sandhyavandana ritual, Sanskrit learning, etc.

Let the Mothers Savitri, Gayatri and Saraswati shower their choicest
blessings on the vaṭu Nīlagrīva.  Teach him soon the Sri Rudram where occur
the words: nīlagrīvāḥ śitikaṇṭhāh...

warm regards
