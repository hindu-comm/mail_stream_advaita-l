In my opinion it is not wrong to expect the fullfilment of ones actions 
but to understand that success or failure does not "belong" to oneself 
(i.e. ahamkara) but is due to Bhagavans krpa.  Arjuna has anxieties about 
fighting but after Krishna bhagavan has cleared them, he fights to win. 
But as a person of samyagdrishti he experiences even grave setbacks such 
as the death of Abhimanyu with equanimity.
