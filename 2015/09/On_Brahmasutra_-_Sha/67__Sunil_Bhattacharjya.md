Namaste,
The historical studies have been made so far in a sporadic manner. I hope the historians will look at it earnestly. 

Ashwaghosha and Nagarjuna were contemporaries of Kanishka and the date of Kanishka from the Pauranic source as well as from Astronomical studies comes out to be the beginning of the 13th century BCE.
It has also been reported that the Buddhist teaching in Nalanda was vibrant till the end of the 12th century CE, i.e. till. Bhaktiyar Khilji (d.1206 CE) destroyed all that was in Nalanda and he is reported to have killed about 10,000 students and teachers there.
Buddhist Nyayaikas as well as the early Hindu Nyayaikas were active within the period of two millennium or so (from the time of Ashwaghosha/Nagarjuna to the time of Bakhtiyar khilji)
Regards,Sunil KB

The sutras and other discourses weren't written until much later. I think 
it is quite fair from a historical point of view to say that Shakyamuni 
did not propound a systematic philosophy.

Not even close. Buddhism had already been mostly forgotten in India by 
the time of Navynyaya. Only the oldest transitional figures between the 
old and new schools of Nyaya such as Udayana acharya had direct experience 
with debating Buddhists.
