Perhaps I am, but I'm just being realistic.

Corruption should be dealt with, but not for the sake of accomodating
foreigners over the native population. I only based my comment on the tone
of Mr. Knapps recollection and the fact that he is one of these "new age"
type writers that I am leery of to begin with. No offense intended, my
apologies. I dont want to tarnish the memory of swamiji with these kind of
things.

Namsakra,

Santosh
