Sir,
  Brahman is sat-chit-ananda
That means,chit is brahman...or in other words,chit is not mithya but it is
sathya...or very brahman...

So,in advaita chit is sathya...that means brahman can be categorisable..as
chit swarupi...

If brahman is chit swarupi,how can brahman is  non-categorisable?

As unpanishad says brahman is non-categorisable....

regards,
Harsha  Bhat
