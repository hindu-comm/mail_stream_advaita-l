If you have jIvanmuktivivekaH with you, then go to last chapter where he
explains the upaniShad.
The upaniShad vaakya is:
असौ स्वपुत्रमित्रकलत्रबन्ध्वादीञ्शिखायज्ञोपवीते स्वाध्यायञ्च
सर्व्वकर्म्माणि संन्यस्यायं ब्रह्माण्डञ्च हित्वा कौपीनं दण्डमाच्छादनञ्च
स्वशरीरोपभोगार्थाय लोकस्योपकारार्थाय च परिग्रहेत् इति ।

Without going to commentary of vidyAraNya, observer that kaupIna, daNDa and
AcchAdana are for use of own body and for good of loka-s, both.

What is the use for own body, is explained by shrIvidyAraNya:

स्वशरीरोपभोगो नाम -

                    कौपीनेन लज्जाव्यावृत्तिः

                     दण्डेन गोसर्पाद्युपद्रवपरिहारः

                    आच्छादनेन शीतादिपरिहारः ।

लोकस्योपकारो नाम -

                    दण्डादिलिङ्गेन एतदीयमुत्तमाश्रमं परिज्ञाय
तदुचिताभिवन्दनभिक्षाप्रदानादिप्रवृत्त्या (लोकानां) सुकृतसिद्धिः ।

So, the use of daNDa is to protect own body from cow, snake, etc. This is
the dR^iShTa-prayojana for sannyAsI. Benefits, which loks(people) get may
be fo many types, and that doesn't relate to sannyAsI.

Then says that acceptance of kaupIna, etc. is favorable(for deha, etc.),
hence that is not essential for paramahaMsa:

कौपीनादिपरिग्रहस्यानुकूलत्वमभिप्रेत्य मुख्यत्वं प्रतिषेधति(उपनिषद्)

तच्च न मुख्योऽस्ति इति ।

यत् कौपीनादिपरिग्रहणमस्ति तदपि अस्य योगिनः परमहंसस्य मुख्यः कल्पो न भवति ,
किन्त्वनुकल्प एव ।


But, he supports that acceptance and maintenance of daNDa, etc. is
essential for vividiShu-paramahaMsa:

विविदिषासंन्यासिनस्तु दण्डग्रहणं मुख्यम् इतिकृत्वा दण्डवियोगस्य निषेधः
स्मर्यते -

दण्डात्मनोस्तु संयोगः सर्वदैव विधीयते ।

न  दण्डेन विना गच्छेदिषुक्षेपत्रयं बुधः ॥

इति ।

प्रायश्चित्तमपि दण्डनाशे प्राणायामशतं स्मर्यते - दण्डत्यागे शतञ्चरेत् इति ।

That's why sentences are found which say that daNDa-deha-saMyoga should be
maintained, he should not go without daNDa beyond iShuxepatraya. And hence
there is a prAyashchitta for daNDa-nAsha. Mind that original sentence says
'daNDa-tyAga' while shrIvidyAraNya translates it as 'daNDa-nAsha', because
daNDa-nAsha is being taught for vidvat-paramahaMsa here.

Now, for a sannyAsI who is intensly engaged in shravaNa, manana,
nididhyAsana, yoga and vAsanA-xaya this maintenance of specific type of
cloths, daNDa-s will cause problems , so he should shun them. This is said
there:

यथा विविदिषुः परमहंसः शिखायज्ञोपवीताभ्यां रहितो मुख्यः तथा योगी
दण्डाच्छादनाभ्यां रहितः सन् मुख्यो भवति ; दण्डस्य वैणवत्वादिलक्षणम्
आच्छादनस्य कन्थात्वादिलक्षणञ्च परीक्षितुं , दण्डादिकं सम्पादयितुं
रक्षितुञ्च चित्ते व्यापृते सति चित्तवृत्तिनिरोधलक्षणो योगो न सिद्ध्येत् इति
। तच्च न युक्तं , न हि वरविघाताय कन्योद्वाह इतिन्यायात् ।

You take sannyAsa for GYAna and chittashAnti. So, when daNDa, etc. start to
cause hindrance, you should shun them.

Other dR^iShTa-prayojana is to keep sannyAsI aware of his duty, i.e.
brahmaniShThA. This is also mentioned by vidyAraNya:

ननु दण्डग्रहणविधिवासनयोपेता विविदिषासंन्यासिनो योगिनं दण्डरहितं परमहंसं
नाभ्युपगच्छन्ति इत्याशङ्क्य

आह (परमहंसोपनिषद्)

ज्ञानदण्डो धृतो येन एकदण्डी स उच्यते ॥

काष्ठदण्डो धृतो येन सर्व्वाशी ज्ञानवर्ज्जितः ।

स याति नरकान्घोरान्महारौरवसञ्ज्ञकान् ॥

तितिक्षाज्ञानवैराग्यशमादिगुणवर्ज्जजितः ।

भिक्षामात्रेण यो जीवेतस पापी यतिवृत्तिहा ॥

इदमनन्तरं ज्ञात्वा स परमहंसः ।

इति ।

परमहंसस्य योऽयमेकदण्डः स द्विविधः - ज्ञानदण्डः काष्ठदण्डश्चेति ।

...................................

एवं सति मौनादीनां वागादिदमनहेतुत्वात् यथा दण्डत्वं तथैव
अज्ञानतत्कार्य्यदमनहेतोः ज्ञानस्य दण्डत्वम् । अयं ज्ञानदण्डो येन परमहंसेन
धृतः स एव मुख्य एकदण्डी इत्युच्यते ।

मानसस्य ज्ञानदण्डस्य कदाचित् चित्तविक्षेपेण विस्मृतिः प्रसज्येत इति
तन्निवारणार्थं स्मारकः काष्ठदण्डो ध्रियते । तदेतच्छास्त्रार्थरहस्यमबुद्ध्वा
वेषमात्रेण पुरुषार्थसिद्धिमभिप्रेत्य काष्ठदण्डो येन परमहंसेन धृतः स पुरुषो
बहुविधयातनोपेतत्वात् घोरान् महारौरवसञ्ज्ञकान् नरकान् आप्नोति ।

....................................................

एवञ्च सति ज्ञानदण्डकाष्ठदण्डयोर्यदन्तरम् उत्तमत्वाधमत्वरूपं
तदिदमवगत्योत्तमं ज्ञानदण्डं यो धारयति स एव मुख्यः परमहंसः
इत्यभ्युपगन्तव्यम् ।

So, a person who has taken paramahaMsa-sannyAsa may be vividishu or vidvAn.

If he is vividiShu, he should maintain daNDa, etc. for his safety and to
show to others his sannyAsitvam.

If he has mahAvAkyopadesha and has known oneness with brahman, i.e. if he
is a vidvAn, who isintensely engaged in brahmaniShThA, i.e. shravaNAdi,
vAsanAxaya and yoga; then he should shun all signs of sannyAsa to increase
intensity.


More for both sannyAsI-s:

Worshiping God is for that sannyAsI, who is not trying to become yogI:

यस्तु देवपूजायां निर्बन्धः स्मर्यते

भिक्षाटनं जपः शौचं स्नानं ध्यानं सुरार्चनम् ।

कर्तव्यानि षडेतानि सर्वथा नृपदण्डवत् ॥

इति ; तस्याप्ययोगिविषयत्वमभिप्रेत्य नावाहनम् इत्यादि आम्नातम्
(परमहंसोपनिषदि) ।

He should not make/maintain maTha for attachment to that is a hindrance for
yogI:

अत एव भिक्षुरनिकेतस्थितिरेव । यदि नियतनिवासार्थं कञ्चिन्मठं सम्पादयेत्
तदानीं तस्मिन्ममत्वे सति तदीयहानिवृद्ध्योश्चित्तं विक्षिप्येत ।

Similarly he should not accept pots made of gold/silver:

यथा मठो न परिग्रहीतव्यः तथा सौवर्णराजतादीनां भिक्षाचमनादिपात्राणामेकमपि न
गृह्णीयात् ।

तदाह यमः -

हिरण्मयानि पात्राणि कार्ष्णायसमयानि च ।

यतीनां तान्यपात्राणि वर्ज्जयेत्तानि भिक्षुकः ॥

इति ।

मनुरपि -

अतैजसानि पात्राणि तस्य स्युर्निर्व्व्रणानि च ।

..........................

इति ।

Again paramahaMsopaniShad for avoiding/shunning gold, etc.:

यस्माद्भिक्षुर्हिरण्यं रसेन दृष्टं चेत् स ब्रह्महा भवेत्
यस्माद्भिक्षुर्हिरण्यं रसेन स्पृष्टं चेत् स पौल्कसो भवेत् .......

etc.


Now, I request you not to bring present sannyAsin-s, either daNDin-s or
paramahaMsa-s, because they may not be doing everything according to
shAstra-s. What they are doing according to that, of which most important
is tyAga and shravaNAdyabhyAsa, is recommended and everything else is not
to be supported(just to save our faith and hence ourselves).

After mentioning shAstra-s it is quite clear for us what is correct and
what is not. So, let us support right things and ask sannyAsI-s, directly
or otherwise, to follow these rules and help them in whatever way we could.

This varNAshramadharma-chyuti(fall from shAstra-prescribed activities of
other varNa-s and Ashrama-s) is also to be accepted by non-sannyAsI-s and
they should also try to do/live more according to shAstra-s.

I thing any deviation from the above mentioned will make this thread dirty.
So, please avoid anything like that.

Let truth prevail, just by supporting it and accepting our failures first.
