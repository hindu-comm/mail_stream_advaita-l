Namaste,

I would like to share a beautiful verse from "bhAmini vilAsa" which was composed by the celebrated poet shrI. jagannAtha paNDitarAya.

malayAnila kAlakUTayO ramaNIkuntalabhOgibhOgayOH /
shwapachAtmabhuvOrnirantarA mama bhUyAt paramAtmani sthitiH //

Let my mind attain equal vision towards the cool breeze of Malaya Hills and the poisonous fumes from snake; towards beautiful hair locks of a damsel and the snake; towards a chandala and a brahmin.

regs,
sriram
