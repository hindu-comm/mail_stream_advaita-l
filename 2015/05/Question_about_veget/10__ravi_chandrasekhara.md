Dear Jaldhar and all,
Do shastras differentiate meat eating (for food) versus that obtained fromyagna ? If so, then does meat eatingcontradict Manu Smriti statements condemning meat eating ?Does meat for food need to be obtained only via yagna ?
Also in prior posts over the years, on this list, meat eating is based on jaathi/varna shistachaara and not necessarily based on region of residence or one's occupation.

 Dear
Jainism did have some influence on the eating practices of South Indians.We have shaiva vellalars too who do not take non vegetarian food.Shaiva is used to specify pure vegetarianism.Like Vaishnava word indicates this in the North especially Punjab,Haryana etc.
But it cannot be said that Jainism brought vegetarianism.To be sathvic which aids purity of the mind vegetarianism has been found to be helpful.About Garlic/onion consumption these are said to drag ones mind towards Thamasic tendencies and therefore to be avoided.Gita 18th Chapter will be helpful to know about foods to be avoided and foods to be preferred.
