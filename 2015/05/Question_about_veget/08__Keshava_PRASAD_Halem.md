namastE. praNaams to Sri Jaldhar Vyas ji for a detailed point by point explanation.
I do not know, but i believe that the Sruti+smRti together deal with exhaustive details as to every bit of every step in every procedure involved in every one of the activities, particularly of the yajnaas, right? If so, then (having accepted that the Sruti+smRti do deal with animal-sacrifice in yajnaas)a related sub-question is - do they give therein the same level of exhaustive details in terms of the nature & preparation of such animal-sacrifice etc; i am just curious.
