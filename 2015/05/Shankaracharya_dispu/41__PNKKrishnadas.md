The dispute over the crown of Shankaracharya of Dwarika and Jyotishpeeth, a
court in Uttar Pradesh's Allahabad district, on Tuesday ruled that Swami
Swaroopananda Saraswati was the rightful Shankaracharya.

This is an important decision by the Allahabad court system for the rightful
parampara lineage of this vital peeth, at Jyotishpeeth Badrikashram.
