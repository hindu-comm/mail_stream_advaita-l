HariH OM!

sarvebuyo namaskāaraḥ,


I am searching for an Advaita grantha titled "Advaita Vidyā Tilakam"  by
Samara Pungava Dīkṣitar.

I couldn't find any reference in any digital archives.

I understand that there is also a commentary on this grantha in Devanāgari
and I am not aware of the commentators name.

Can anyone in the list guide me to any information?
