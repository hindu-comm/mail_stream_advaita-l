Humble thanks to the learned scholars in throwing light on my query on
vanaprashthAshrami.

Kindly bless me in knowing the co-relation between 'Ashrama' and
'purushArtha' which is abundantly referred to in various scriptures.

1. Does the 4 'Ashrama' directly co-relate to the 4 'purushArtha'?
2. Or, is there any hierarchical relashionship?
3. Or, is it simply a natural truth of life for an Asthika?
