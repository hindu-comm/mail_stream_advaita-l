Namaste
The quoted bhaashya explains the dala, Ekaatmapratyayasaaram, that occurs in the mantra. A word to word meaning is given below:
एकात्मप्रत्ययसारं जाग्रदादिस्थानेषु एक एवायमात्माइत्यव्यभिचारी यः प्रत्ययः, तेनानुसरणीयम् ; अथवा, एक आत्मप्रत्ययः सारः प्रमाणं यस्य तुरीयस्याधिगमे, तत्तुरीयमेकात्मप्रत्ययसारम्
एक+आत्म+प्रत्यय+सारम् = one+Self+knowledge+fit to be followedजाग्रत्+आदि+स्थानेषु = in the states starting with the wakeful (i.e. wakeful state etc.)एकः = oneएव = onlyअयम् = thisआत्मा = Atmaइति = thusअव्यभिचारी = unchangingयः = that whichप्रत्ययः = knowledge [is there]तेन = with thatअनुसरणीयम् = fit to be followedअथवा = orएकः = oneआत्म+प्रत्ययः = Self-cognition, i.e. being conscious of one's own Self, that such and such constitutes "I"सारः = essenceप्रमाणम् = valid means of proofयस्य = of whichतुरीयस्य = of Tureeyaअधिगमे = understandingतत् = thatतुरीयम् = Tureeyamएक+आत्म+प्रत्यय+सारम्=one+Self+cognition/awareness/consciousness+essence

Ekaatmapratyayasaaram is that which is fit to be followed by the unchanging or firm knowledge that there is only one Atma in the states such as Wakeful state, or Ekaatmapratyayasaaram refers to the Tureeya, in understanding which Self-cognition is the essence, i.e. the valid means of obtaining knowledge.
The purport (taatparya) of the first gloss is that Tureeya is called Ekaatmapratyayasaaram because It (Tureeya) can be understood with the firm, unchanging knowledge that there in only one Atma in the four states. Here the word "saara" has been glossed as "anusaraNeeya"; if something, say A, is fit to be followed by something else, say B, it means that A can be obtained by, or understood through, B.
The purport of the second gloss is that Tureeya is that in understanding which Self-consciousness is the essence, that is a pramaaNa (valid means of obtaining knowledge).

 Subject: [Advaita-l] Need explanation for "ekatma-pratyaya-saram"

I am having little trouble in understanding this description of turiya in
Mandukya upanishad.

Can anybody explain the Shankara Bhashya portion for the term ?

The Bhashya says- एकात्मप्रत्ययसारं जाग्रदादिस्थानेषु एक एवायमात्मा
इत्यव्यभिचारी यः प्रत्ययः, तेनानुसरणीयम् ; अथवा, एक आत्मप्रत्ययः सारः
प्रमाणं यस्य तुरीयस्याधिगमे, तत्तुरीयमेकात्मप्रत्ययसारम्,
^^^

Can anybody translate it word for word?

Thank you in advance.

Regards,
Nithin
