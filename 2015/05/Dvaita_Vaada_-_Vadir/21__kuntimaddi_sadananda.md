Yes Vidyaji - Thanks.
 In that sense the shrotavyaH, mantavyaH and nidhidhyaasitavyaH differ from drashTavyaH.

As such, the word drashTavayaH simply means, icchasi yadi moksham, AtmadarSanam kuru. The action 
indicated here is not really an action that is to be undertaken in order to establish a new result. The AtmA
is svayaMsiddha, so it is only a way of using speech.

Best regards,
