Another response:

The Gita vivRti of Sri Raghavendra Tirtha too says for this verse 13.32 the
word nirguna means that which is devoid of the three gunas.

In the Kannada Book 'Mata Traya Sameekkshaa' authored by
Dr.A.V.Nagasampige, a renowned scholar of Dvaita, under the section 'Dvata
mata', on p.158, under a topic heading: 'nirguna shrutiya Antarya' takes up
this very Shvetashvatara mantra and comments:

//In a preceding mantra (6.2) is the word 'guNI' (sakalaguNapUrNa).  And
hence the word 'nirguNa' of the present mantra means: He is devoid of
prAkRta (sattva rajas tamas) guNas.  //

Further, since an earlier mantra has said 'guNI', there is no need for the
upanishad to repeat that same idea by the word 'anirguNa'.  Also, it would
go against the popular meaning: 'devoid of the three gunas' and only
assert the presence of the three gunas.

What is pertinent to note is that the above Kannada book takes the word as
'nirguna' only.

In the Bhashya admitted to be of Shankara, for the word 'guNI' the meaning
is: apahatapApmAdimAn (one endowed with all pure qualities such as freedom
from sins).  For 'nirguna' the meaning is: free from the sattva rajas tamas
gunas.

In the same way, if the word 'nirguna' is held to be 'free from heyaguNas'
as is with the Vishishtadvaitins, then too, the 'anirguNa' will only be a
negation of this and end up admitting heya gunas in Brahman.
