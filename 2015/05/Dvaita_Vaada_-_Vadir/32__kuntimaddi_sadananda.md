Anandji - PraNAms

Agreed. 

The question is only 'If you think you lost, then  search for it' - In the case of the gold chain example, the chain or self that I am is never lost other than the notion that it is lost, since one is seeking for it. The self-evident but apparently not self-evident situation opens up different opinions.  The point is both schools understand the problem and each acharya is trying to explain from different perspectives. As long as one looks at the problem from the problem reference, then the solution is very clear. 

There is statement by a swami - As long as seeker and the sought are one and the same, any seeking on the part of the seeker is bound to fail, since in the very seeking the seeker has resolved that the sought is not there where the seeker is. In stead of self, we can apply to this for the search for happiness as every living being is doing life after life. 

The rest of course is, what I consider, as of academic interest. 

Hari Om!

 Dear Shri Sadanandaji,

 In the gold chain example, the
 bhAmatI view, can be explained as applying a general rule
 "if you have lost something of value then search for
 it" instead of the rule "if you have lost a gold
 chain then search for it." So the person is expected to
 search for it, perhaps by walking, questioning his friend,
 etc. In fact, the bhAmatI school holds that shravaNa,
 manana, nididhyAsana are all necessary for Self-realization
 in general, while the vivaraNa school says shravaNa is the
 primary means. 

 Anand
