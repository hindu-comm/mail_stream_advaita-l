Dear Sri Anandji,


 Namaskarams.


 Thanks for the detailed discussion on the issue. While you have stated
that


 << Shankara's commentary on Br. Up. 2.4.5 makes it clear that realization
of
the Self is through shravaNa, manana, and nididhyAsana, which means
"draShTavyaH" is only a term being used to refer to shravaNa, manana, and
nididhyAsana, taken together. >>


 others have indeed taken the view that the term << draShTavyaH >> is the
desired Goal to achieve which shravaNa, manana, and nididhyAsana are the
means and hence the two are to be distinguished. Since this Goal concerns
jnana it is considered that , as discussed elsewhere in vedanta , “
draShTavyaH “ is not considered a vidhi here also. I do not think there is
any different view on this from any quarters.


 As regards shravaNa, manana, and nididhyAsana , as you have brought out ,
there are differing views. For the first three alternatives namely apurva /
niyama /parisamkhya vidhis, you have also mentioned the supporting Bhashya
references relied on by the respective groups. From your comments on verse
115 of the Vartika by Sri Sureshwaracharya I presume you are concluding
that he considers this to be a parisamkhya vidhi. I have come across
another respected author who mentions that Sri Sureshwaracharya considers
this as either niyama or parisamkhya << niyamah parisamkhya va >> . However
for the fourth alternative namely << vidhi abhava ( no vidhi ) >> held by
the Bhamati school , you have not mentioned if they rely on any supporting
Bhashya references. Are there any such supporting references or is it to be
concluded that its view is contrary to the Bhashyam. No doubt Sri
Subrahmanianji has cited BSB 1-1-4 in this regard to conclude that it is
not a vidhi, but Sri Sureshwaracharya also has cited the same ( as
mentioned by you ) Bhashya for his conclusion. I would be grateful for a
response.


 Regards
