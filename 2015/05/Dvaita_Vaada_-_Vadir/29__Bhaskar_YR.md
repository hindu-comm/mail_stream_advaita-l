<< what is Sri Bahagavatpada's view on the issue ? >>

IMHO, bhAshyakAra makes his position clear in this regard (whether upanishad's vAkya sharvaNAdi sAdhana vidhi para or not ) in tattusamavayAt sUtra bhAshya (1-1-4) and in ubhayalingAdhikaraNa (3rd adhyAya 2nd pAda) which I think has already been quoted here.  And again, shankara's insistence with regard to repeated sAdhana of sharavaNa in 4th adhyAya (which also quoted earlier) yathA avaghAtAdeeni tandula nishpattiparyavasAnAni tadvat etc. & in 3-4-47 can be treated as apUrva vidhi since in some cases where shravaNa itselt fetches the jnAna to the uttamAdhikAri-s (those who do not have ajnAna, saMshaya and vipareeta jnAna)  and in such instances further sAdhana-s like manana & nidhydhyAsa are not necessary. This has been clarified by  bhAshyakAra himself  in the very next sUtra of the 4th adhyAya.  In short, since brahma jnAna is vastu tantra and NOT purusha tantra, any amount of vidhi-s (injunctions) which is purusha tantra, carried out by sAdhaka would not necessarily result in svarUpa jnAna which is self-evident.  So, the 'tavya' pratyaya in shruti vAkya 'shrOtavyO, maNtavyO etc. not strictly imposing any injunctions in shravaNAdhi sAdhana it is there just to turning  our mind from external distractions to ultimate purushArtha.  

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
