In this regard this statement of Shankara in the BSB 'Tat tu samanvayāt'
the very fourth sūtra, will be helpful.  There the discussion is whether
the Atman is a product of action or not.  In that context Shankara has said:

तत्रैवं सति यथाभूतब्रह्मात्मविषयमपि ज्ञानं न चोदनातन्त्रम् । तद्विषये
लिङादयः श्रूयमाणा अपि अनियोज्यविषयत्वात्कुण्ठीभवन्ति उपलादिषु
प्रयुक्तक्षुरतैक्ष्ण्यादिवत्, अहेयानुपादेयवस्तुविषयत्वात् । किमर्थानि
तर्हि ‘आत्मा
वा अरे द्रष्टव्यः श्रोतव्यः’ (बृ. उ. २-४-५)

इत्यादीनि *विधिच्छायानि वचनानि* ? स्वाभाविकप्रवृत्तिविषयविमुखीकरणार्थानीति
ब्रूमः । यो हि बहिर्मुखः प्रवर्तते पुरुषः ‘इष्टं मे भूयादनिष्टं मा भूत्’
इति, न च तत्रात्यन्तिकं पुरुषार्थं लभते, तमात्यन्तिकपुरुषार्थवाञ्छिनं
स्वाभाविकात्कार्यकरण- सङ्घातप्रवृत्तिगोचराद्विमुखीकृत्य
प्रत्यगात्मस्रोतस्तया प्रवर्तयन्ति ‘आत्मा वा अरे द्रष्टव्यः’ इत्यादीनि ;

One may read the Swami Gambhirananda translation for this on p. 35 of the
Advaita Ashrama edition.  The gist of the discussion is: Why then are there
sentences *that are of a semblance of vidhi,* such as 'the self is to be
realized; it has to be heard, etc.' there?  The reply is: such sentences
are there to weaning the aspirant (who is naturally prone to engage in some
or the other activity to attain some worldly goal) from activity and turn
his attention to the contemplation of the inward Self.

Thus, according to Advaitins the sentence 'आत्मा वा अरे द्रष्टव्यः
श्रोतव्यः’ (बृ. उ. २-४-५)
<http://advaitasharada.sringeri.net/php/format.php?bhashya=Brha&page=02&hval=%E2%80%98%E0%A4%86%E0%A4%A4%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%AE%E0%A4%BE%20%E0%A4%B5%E0%A4%BE%20%E0%A4%85%E0%A4%B0%E0%A5%87%20%E0%A4%A6%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%B0%E0%A4%B7%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%9F%E0%A4%B5%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%AF%E0%A4%83%20%E0%A4%B6%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%B0%E0%A5%8B%E0%A4%A4%E0%A4%B5%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%AF%E0%A4%83%E2%80%99%20%28%E0%A4%AC%E0%A5%83.%20%E0%A4%89.%20%E0%A5%A8-%E0%A5%AA-%E0%A5%AB%29#BR_C02_S04_V05>'
is not a vidhivākya like agnihotram juhuyāt.  In the latter, a new,
non-existent, goal, fruit, is produced by the enjoined action.  Whereas,
the Atman/Brahman is an already existing 'siddha' vastu which need not be
produced afresh but only requires to be known/realized as 'I am that.'
Hence, there is no vidhi involved here.  In another context, such
vidhi-like sentences are explained as: ajñāta-jñāpanam vidhiḥ' = a 'vidhi'
is that which makes known that which lies unknown.
