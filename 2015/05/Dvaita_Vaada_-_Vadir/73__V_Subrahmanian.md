There are many other examples in the Upanishads for the above concept:

अग्निर्यथैको भुवनं प्रविष्टो रूपं रूपं प्रतिरूपो बभूव ।
एकस्तथा सर्वभूतान्तरात्मा रूपं रूपं प्रतिरूपो बहिश्च ॥ ९ ॥ Kaṭhopanishat
2.2.9,10

वायुर्यथैको भुवनं प्रविष्टो रूपं रूपं प्रतिरूपो बभूव ।
एकस्तथा सर्वभूतान्तरात्मा रूपं रूपं प्रतिरूपो बहिश्च ॥ १० ॥

सूर्यो यथा सर्वलोकस्य चक्षुर्न लिप्यते चाक्षुषैर्बाह्यदोषैः ।
एकस्तथा सर्वभूतान्तरात्मा न लिप्यते लोकदुःखेन बाह्यः ॥ ११ ॥

In the next mantra, the Upanishad explains the purpose of the above
examples and how the Supreme Brahman despite appearing as various
jīvas/beings, is not affected by the ups and downs of the upādhi-attached
jivas:

एको वशी सर्वभूतान्तरात्मा एकं रूपं बहुधा यः करोति ।
तमात्मस्थं येऽनुपश्यन्ति धीरास्तेषां सुखं शाश्वतं नेतरेषाम् ॥ १२ ॥

किञ्च, स हि परमेश्वरः सर्वगतः स्वतन्त्रः एकः, न तत्समोऽभ्यधिको वान्योऽस्ति
। वशी, सर्वं ह्यस्य जगद्वशे वर्तते । कुतः ? सर्वभूतान्तरात्मा । यत एकमेव
सदैकरसमात्मानं विशुद्धविज्ञानघनरूपं नामरूपाद्यशुद्धोपाधिभेदवशेन बहुधा
अनेकप्रकारेण यः करोति स्वात्मसत्तामात्रेण अचिन्त्यशक्तित्वात्, तत् आत्मस्थं
स्वशरीरहृदयाकाशे बुद्धौ चैतन्याकारेणाभिव्यक्तमित्येतत् — न हि
शरीरस्याधारत्वमात्मनः, आकाशवदमूर्तत्वात् ; आदर्शस्थं मुखमिति यद्वत् —
तमेतमीश्वरमात्मानं ये निवृत्तबाह्यवृत्तयः अनुपश्यन्ति आचार्यागमोपदेशमनु
साक्षादनुभवन्ति धीराः विवेकिनः, तेषां परमेश्वरभूतानां शाश्वतं नित्यं सुखम्
आत्मानन्दलक्षणं भवति, नेतरेषां बाह्यासक्तबुद्धीनामविवेकिनां स्वात्मभूतमपि,
अविद्याव्यवधानात् ॥

9     As the same non—dual fire, after it has entered the world, becomes
different according to whatever it burns, so also the same non—dual Atman,
dwelling in all beings, becomes different according to whatever It enters.
And It exists also without.

10     As the same non—dual air, after it has entered the world, becomes
different according to whatever it enters, so also the same non—dual Atman,
dwelling in all beings, becomes different according to whatever It enters.
And It exists also without.

11     As the sun, which helps all eyes to see, is not affected by the
blemishes of the eyes or of the external things revealed by it, so also the
one Atman, dwelling in all beings, is never contaminated by the misery of
the world, being outside it.

12     There is one Supreme Ruler, the inmost Self of all beings, who makes
His one form manifold. Eternal happiness belongs to the wise, who perceive
Him within themselves—not to others.

रूपं रूपं प्रतिरूपो बभूव तदस्य रूपं प्रतिचक्षणाय । इन्द्रो मायाभिः पुरुरूप
ईयते युक्ता ह्यस्य हरयः शता दशेति । Br.up.2.5.19

"He (the Lord) transformed Himself in accordance with each  form and each
form of His was for the sake of making Him  known. The Lord (Indra),
through His mayas, appears  manifold; ...''
