This will not happen since the jiva is that Chaitanya that has identified,
owing to avidyā, with the body-mind complex.  Hence this 'person' (jiva)
alone will be experiencing the suffering and not the shuddha chaitanya that
is a mere sākṣi.  Even Dvaitins accept an antaryāmi that always resides in
the jiva.  If the antaryāmi is not the one suffering the pains of hell
according to them, the same applies to the advaitins too.

Here too, same as above.  It is the jiva, the chaitanyam that is
identifying with the body-mind complex is the one who does the
purificatory/expiatory karma.  Shankara has dealt with this in the BSB.


> देहान्तःकरणादेश्च न पापाश्रयता तव ।
> सुप्तौ सर्वलये पापाधारप्रसङ्गतः ॥
> The body, mind and other things cannot have sin because in deep sleep

The jiva is the āśraya.  He does not disappear or die in deep sleep.  Same
with pralaya too.  The BSB 3.2.9 deals with this. Read the original in
advaitasharada site and the translation here:

See the above references.

One can see BSB 2.3.41:

सापेक्षत्वं च ईश्वरस्य सम्भवति सतोर्जन्तूनां धर्माधर्मयोः ; तयोश्च सद्भावः
सति जीवस्य कर्तृत्वे ; तदेव चेत्कर्तृत्वमीश्वरापेक्षं स्यात्,
किंविषयमीश्वरस्य सापेक्षत्वमुच्यते । अकृताभ्यागमश्चैवं जीवस्य प्रसज्येत ।
तस्मात्स्वत एवास्य कर्तृत्वमिति — एतां प्राप्तिं तुशब्देन व्यावर्त्य
प्रतिजानीते — परादिति ; अविद्यावस्थायां कार्यकरणसङ्घाताविवेकदर्शिनो
जीवस्याविद्यातिमिरान्धस्य सतः परस्मादात्मनः
कर्माध्यक्षात्सर्वभूताधिवासात्साक्षिणश्चेतयितुरीश्वरात्तदनुज्ञया
कर्तृत्वभोक्तृत्वलक्षणस्य संसारस्य सिद्धिः ; तदनुग्रहहेतुकेनैव च विज्ञानेन
मोक्षसिद्धिर्भवितुमर्हति ।

// For the soul which in the state of Nescience is blinded by the darkness
of ignorance and hence unable to distinguish itself from the complex of
effects and instruments, the sa*m*sâra-state in which it appears as agent
and enjoyer brought about through the permission of the Lord who is the
highest Self, the superintendent of all actions, the witness residing in
all beings, the cause of all intelligence; and we must therefore assume
that final release also is effected through knowledge caused by the grace
of the Lord.//

The above case is a pūrvapakṣa for Advaitin. Shankara , while refuting the
vijnānavāda doctrine of the Bauddha uses the above arguments.  In Advaita,
as shown above, there is one continuing Atman and therefore no such defects
as Sri Vādirāja assumes arise.  If only he had studied the Bhāṣyas and most
importantly, understood them, the above objections would never arise.  The
foregoing verses of the Dvaitin is yet another demonstration of the typical
Madhva, where objections are made without studying or properly
understanding advaita.  Having realized this, the present day scholars of
Dvaita take steps to invite Advaita scholars, listen to them expounding
advaitic bhāsya/texts.
