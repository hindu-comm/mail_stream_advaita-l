Response:

Yes, it is indeed stated so.  However, in the very next sentence starting
from 'tathaapi' the observed fact of taking one to be the other, adhyāsa,
is also stated.

The parā, 'outside, is nothing but the adhyasta anātma.  When the correct
realization arises, it is of the nature: what was wrongly
perceived/understood as the anātmā (body-mind) (pratibimba), is actually
the ātmā, the Pure Consciousness. This is called bādhāyām
sāmānādhikaraṇyam.  Shankara has given this example in the BGB 4.24:

ब्रह्म अर्पणं येन करणेन ब्रह्मवित् हविः अग्नौ अर्पयति तत् ब्रह्मैव इति
पश्यति, तस्य आत्मव्यतिरेकेण अभावं पश्यति, यथा शुक्तिकायां रजताभावं पश्यति ;
तदुच्यते ब्रह्मैव अर्पणमिति, यथा यद्रजतं तत् शुक्तिकैवेति । ‘ब्रह्म
अर्पणम्’ इति असमस्ते पदे । यत् अर्पणबुद्ध्या गृह्यते लोके तत् अस्य
ब्रह्मविदः ब्रह्मैव इत्यर्थः ।  The gist of the above is: 'That which was
wrongly seen/grasped as silver, is actually the shell.'  Thus, that which
was wrongly seen as different (elements of a yāga, in this BG example)
entities, nānātva, is actually the One Brahman.  So, the entire 'yuṣmat',
the 'outside', including the pratibimba, is actually the asmat, the bimba,
upon enquiry.  Hence there is no contradction or any otherdefect in the
adhyāsa bhāṣya to the siddhānta.

The above is not in line with the advaitic view of the BSB on the upama.
Shankara takes that adhikarṇa to be deciding that the Upanishadic Brahman
is nirguna, adviteeya.  All bheda is negated by the upanishads themselves.
He has provided several such passages in the adhikarana bhashya.  And takes
the 'ata eva cha upamā sūryakādivat' to teach: It is only because the
Upanishadic Brahman is adviteeya and nirguna, the Upanishad is giving the
example of the sun and its reflections in many water-mediums.  The two
quotes Shankara gives in the bhashyam are themselves teaching that the
bheda is created due to upādhis.  Hence, the sutra is not at all to teach
the bimba-pratibimba bheda.  On the other hand it is teaching the
adviteeyatva of the bimba.  When the aupādhika bheda is given up by
realizing the illusory nature of the upadhis, what is left is the
secondless Brahman (no second entity of any kind: sajātīya, vijātīya and
svagata bheda).

All this arises because of not taking the overall view of the adhikarana
consisting of several sutras.  One can argue in the above manner even with
respect to the 'advaita shrutis' where the views of the Advaitin and the
Dvaitin with respect to these shrutis are completely different.  In any
case the two scriptural passages that Shankara cites settle the issue for
the Advaitins.

अत एव चोपमा सूर्यकादिवत्
यत एव च अयमात्मा चैतन्यरूपो निर्विशेषो वाङ्मनसातीतः
परप्रतिषेधोपदेश्यः, अत एव च अस्योपाधिनिमित्तामपारमार्थिकीं
विशेषवत्तामभिप्रेत्य जलसूर्यकादिवदित्युपमा उपादीयते मोक्षशास्त्रेषु —
‘यथा ह्ययं ज्योतिरात्मा विवस्वानपो भिन्न बहुधैकोऽनुगच्छन् । उपाधिना
क्रियते भेदरूपो देवः क्षेत्रेष्वेवमजोऽयमात्मा’ इति, ‘एक एव हि भूतात्मा
भूते भूते व्यवस्थितः । एकधा बहुधा चैव दृश्यते जलचन्द्रवत्’ (ब्र. बिं.
१२) इति चैवमादिषु ॥

In the above, the first passage is not identified so far while the second
one is referenced as from Brahmabindūpaniṣad.  The unreality, aupādhikatva,
of bheda, duality, is what is taught in those passages.  Shankara gives the
first one to exactly match the wording of the sutra; sūryaka is reflection,
vat = yathā, indiciating the upamā bhāva. In the second passage it is
chandra's reflection instead of the surya's.
