Yes, in RK Mission publication (sasvara vEda mantra in Kannada)  with the saMhita mantra (which ends with rAtristomanna jigyushe) these khila mantra-s also have been printed which mainly sounds like popular durgA sUkta & phala shruti.  But during the chandipArAyana also we chant only rAtri sUkta which starts with mantra rAtri vyakhyadAyati and ends with rAtristomanna jigyushe.  

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!

The Rgveda samhitA sUkta 10.127 is followed by other mantras from the khila portion, and all these mantras taken together are known as the rAtrisUkta.
