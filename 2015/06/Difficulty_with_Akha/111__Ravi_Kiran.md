Even though the Source of the original Light (Brahman) is void of all
vrttis, as it is  jnAna svarUpa (Pure Consciousness), the jnAna of the
Source is taking place in jagrat. As we know, in the very first effulgence
or illumination (sphUrana) from sushUpti to jagrat , adhyAsah has occurred
( Pure consciousness with antaHakaraNa ) and it continues until jIva goes
to deep sleep. So, any jnAna in jagrat is of chidabhasa, be it of the
Source and it is vrtti based. But, there is viseshatha in the svarUpa jnAna
vrtti, as it takes shape as akhandakara vritti (niShprakArikA) which I
learnt from this thread discussion.

Just sharing the understanding ( pl take the idea alone, since i dont have
the scholastic way of presenting , but interested in very few threads on
this forum, where i wish to participate for bettering my own clarity on the
subject :)

Namaste
