I feel that, simply stated Akhandakara Vritti is what is described in Isha
Upanishad Mantra 6 & 7 that says, a a Jnani as a person who perceives his
Atman in all objects and All objects in Atman. I feel, this is what
constitute Akhandakara Vritii. Other learned people please correct me, if I
am at fault.

Regards,
Nithin
