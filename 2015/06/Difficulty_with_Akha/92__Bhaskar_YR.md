Kindly share your understanding of these terms and their similarities or differences if any.  So that it would be beneficial to one and all.  As far as my  understanding with regard to samyagdarshana, it goes like this : sa cha bAhyalOkO nAstyasmAkaM AtmavyatiriktaH, sarvaM hi asmAkaM AtmabhUtameva sarvasya cha vayaM AtmabhUtAH...is this sarvAtmabhAva something different from akhandAkAravrutti??  Since I am unable to find this term 'akhandAkAravrutti' in prasthAna traya bhAshya ( I may be wrong here) I am trying to understand this term with samyak jnAna.  Hence seeking your clarification.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
