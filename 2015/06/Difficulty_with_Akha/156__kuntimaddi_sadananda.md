Aurobind Padiyatji - PraNAms

Provided a crisp explanation. 

vRitti in a general sense can be considered as modification of the mind, while in particular sense as thought. In deep sleep state, there is akhandaakaara ajnanaa vRitit - - unchanging - I do not know - a homogeneous unchanging vRitti - a modification of mind due to its folded state expressed as the absence of subject-object duality. 

You have taken aptly the mirage water example. Iswara sRishTi is still  there, and the perception of the plurality and the subject-object duality is still there just as perception of the so-called waters of the mirage. Yet there is akhanda jnaana vRitti that there is no waters in the mirage waters. Thus jagat's mithyaatvam is understood in spite of vyaavaharically there is an apparent plurality. 

Akhandaakaara jnaana vRitti is constant or continuous awareness or knowledge that I am sat chit ananda in spite of apparent plurality at transactional level. In that sense in contrast to akhandaakaara ajnaana vRitti in the deep sleep state expressed as I do not know - it is akhanda jnaana vRitti of swaruupa jnaanam as aham brahmaasmi.

Bhagavana Ramana puts this as - aham aham taya, spurati hRit swayam, parama puurNa sat. - I am - I am - I am - that spontaneously raises in the mind but this I am in contrast to previous I am, paramam and puurNam and Sat swaruupam. 

Hari Om!

 Dear Sri
 Chandramouliji,

 No need to
 be confused.

 First I said
 the word vritti is being used for want of a better word.
 Here
 the word vritti is being used as that
 which substituted all other vritti
 even
 though it is not a vritti by itself.

 Second I said it is a state and not a vritti
 with the above in mind. But as
 explained any
 state has validity only in vyavaharika level, but this is
 not
 a vyavaharika state but a paramarthika
 avastha and the word avastha is for
 explaining from the vyavaharika point of view.
 Because once known there is
 no return to
 vyavaharika state. Vyavahara seen only by those who are
 aspiring to get there, but not who has known
 the "to be known". From the
 view
 point of one who has known the Truth as Sathyam Jnanam
 Anantham, there
 is nothing more to be known
 and he becomes a "krthakrthyah" or one who has
 nothing more to be done. His Vyavahara is not a
 Vyavahara from his point of
 view but only
 from those who see him from Vyavahara. It's called an
 Aabhsam.
 So when you mix up
 both these views they may appear to contradictory.

 For the one who thinks a
 mirage is water, he will think that the one who
 knows the truth of mirage and warns the others
 there is no water it is an
 Aabhsam, is not
 telling the truth. He is also seeing apparently water
 only. But the one who knows it is not water in
 spite he also has all the
 same appearance of
 water, knows the truth and do not get deluded.
 Same way when all that appears as many is in
 essence only one. For bubble
 floating on sea
 can see waves, froth and the deep waters, but knows all
 are
 water including itself and there is
 nothing other than that.

 I've used some examples for clarity but
 they also have limitations.

 Pranams,

 Aurobind Padiyath
