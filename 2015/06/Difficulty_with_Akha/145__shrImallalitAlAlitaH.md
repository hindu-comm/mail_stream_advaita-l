I can see that Ananda Hudli has propounded things in better language,
citing original with examples and showing differences.
I thank him for that. This forum needs such people who know shAstra-s and
can express in English, and have patience to propound in a step-by-step
manner with examples.

I'm feeling shy for not having such qualities.
