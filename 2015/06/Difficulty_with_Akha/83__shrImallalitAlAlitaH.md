​I've heard this.
I can confirm that they are talking about nirodha-pariNAma, and not the
akhaNDAkAravRtti. Their talk is useful to lay persons. It is not going to
help in scholastic talk, like that of vAdirAja and madhusUdana-sarasvatI.
If you want to understand their works, you have to define it in clear
terms, not in vague way. That too according to definitions famous in their
thougt-system.
I've hinted in past that niShprakAraka-vRtti = akhaNDAkAravRtti. But, I'm
not going to put it here until your previous notion is not tested and found
wrong by yourselves.
