Pranams

Thanks for the detailed response from *श्रीमल्ललितालालितः*

Just sharing my understanding from this thread:

1. akhaNDAkAravRttiH results in brahmavidyA or
jivAtma paramAtma ekatva jnAna (knowledge of the mahAvAkya)

2. As per the below defintion of charama jnAna, other vRttis based on
prArabdha
( though it is seen as bAdhita vRtti or sublation, in light of the charama
vRtti )
doesn't arise. There is just the unbroken homogeneous eka charama vRtti

So, one would understand it as synonym to jnAna samAdhi, having no
knowledge or awareness of the nAma rUpa prapaNcha.

Namaste


Hari Om!
