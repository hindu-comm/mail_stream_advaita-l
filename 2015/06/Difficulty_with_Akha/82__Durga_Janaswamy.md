> I am having difficulty with understanding the Akhandakara Vrtti that
> is the Final Vrtti. Vaadiraaja has two objections . Firstly the
> Akhandakara Vrtti does not have any Content or Phala. It is
> Nishparakaraka. If there is a Pot Vrtti there will be a Pot Content.
> But in Akhandakara Vrtti there is no content like the Advaitis are
> saying. There is no Contentless Vrtti in the world. If you say the
> Illusion 'there is no silver' is cancelled there will be a cancelling
> Vrtti like 'this is a shell'. 'This is a shell' is not a contentless
> Vrtti. There is no contentless Vrtti like 'there is nothing' like
> Advaitis are saying.
> 
> Secondly Advaitis are saying there is a Final Akhandakara Vrtti Jnana.
> It will destroy other Vrttis and destroy itself also. Then we enter
> Non-duality. How can you say the Akhandakara Vrtti is Final? If you
> say this you should be saying it in Non-duality condition. But in
> Non-duality there is no thought or Concept of anything. All concepts
> are Illusions in Advaiti's book. Then the Akhanadakara Vrtti Concept
> is also Illusion. It is like hare's horn. It is fictional.
