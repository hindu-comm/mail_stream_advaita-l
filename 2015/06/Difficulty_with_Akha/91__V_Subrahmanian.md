It is well known that the term 'akhaṇḍākāravṛtti' is not found in the
bhāṣya.  However there are unmistakable vākyams in the bhāṣyas that mean
the term:

1. Bṛhadāraṇyaka 1.4.7:
यदैवात्मप्रतिपादकवाक्यश्रवणा*दात्मविषयं **विज्ञानमुत्पद्यते**,* तदैव
तदुत्पद्यमानं तद्विषयं मिथ्याज्ञानं निवर्तयदेवोत्पद्यते ;
आत्मविषयमिथ्याज्ञाननिवृत्तौ च तत्प्रभवाः स्मृतयो न भवन्ति
स्वाभाविक्योऽनात्मवस्तुभेदविषयाः ;

Even as, as a result of shravaṇa etc. the direct realization, vijñānam,
having for its content the Atman, arises, it dispels its object
'mithyājñānam'.  To give an example: when a pot is not known and one
activates the right pramāṇa to know it, the knowledge 'this is pot/I know
the pot' arises thereby dispelling the ignorance pertaining to the pot in
the form 'I do not know the pot.'

2. Br.u. 3.5.1
अमौनं च आत्मज्ञानानात्मप्रत्ययतिरस्कारौ पाण्डित्यबाल्यसञ्ज्ञकौ निःशेषं
कृत्वा, मौनं नाम अनात्मप्रत्ययतिरस्करणस्य पर्यवसानं फलम् — तच्च निर्विद्य
अथ ब्राह्मणः कृतकृत्यो भवति —* ब्रह्मैव सर्वमिति प्रत्यय उ**पजायते** ।* स
ब्राह्मणः कृतकृत्यः, अतो ब्राह्मणः ; निरुपचरितं हि तदा तस्य ब्राह्मण्यं
प्राप्तम् ;

'Everything is Brahman' - such a conviction arises.

3. Brahmasutra bhashya
ब्रह्मसूत्रभाष्यम् । चतुर्थः अध्यायः । प्रथमः पादः ।* आवृत्यधिकरणम्*
 । सूत्रम् २ - भाष्यम्

 तस्मात् सर्वदुःखविनिर्मुक्तैकचैतन्यात्मकोऽहमित्येष आत्मानुभवः । न च एवम्
आत्मानमनुभवतः किञ्चिदन्यत्कृत्यमवशिष्यते ; ......यस्य तु न एषोऽनुभवो
द्रागिव जायते, तं प्रति अनुभवार्थ एव आवृत्त्यभ्युपगमः । तत्रापि न
तत्त्वमसिवाक्यार्थात् प्रच्याव्य आवृत्तौ प्रवर्तयेत् ;
Here the experience is stated: It is of the form: I am that Secondless
Sentient Self that is free of all misery.  This arises as a result of
shravaṇa, etc. For the one to whom such a direct realization does not
happen promptly, to make that happen repetition is prescribed.
