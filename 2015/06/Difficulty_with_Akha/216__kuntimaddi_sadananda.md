PraNAms

The fact is very simple, direct and self-evident (that is why it is called no phala vyaapti). It is the very subject Knower who is currently confused by taking anaatam as the self or aatma. For him, teaching is required to recognize or reclaim his true nature- End of the Story. 

 It is further complicated first, by the sophisticated word - Akhandaakaara vRitti - second sanskrit derivations and commentaries, and further commentaries - As I understand: The word which neither scriptures used or  Shankara used but latter Advaita Acharyas had to use it to counter arguments of the non-advaitic daarshanikas purvapakshaas.  

Currently I take myself what I am not as myself, therefore suffer.  I have to drop that misunderstanding . That can be dropped by correct and clear understanding that involves I am pure sat chit ananda but expressing myself with the traid - jiiva-jagat-Iswara - in essence  I am infinite or aham brahma asmi and everything else or anaatma is just appear to be there for only transactions and not there from absolute point - For this I need the Vedantic teaching which says the world is nothing but naama and ruupa with the substantive - the self that I am. This understanding has to occur for the mind that is confused currently. Hence it can only happen in the waking state since inquiry is required using a pramaana by the mind that is confused. 

Krishna puts this in simple direct teaching as - sarvabhutastam aatmaanam sarva bhuutanicha aatmani or from Bhakti point - yo maam pasyati sarvatra and sarvanca mayi pasyati. One who sees himself in everything and everything in himself - or one who see Me in everything and everything in Me - That seeing or recognition as FACT and not just as THOUGHT is self-realization and that factual knowledge remains in the mind all the time (provides all the lingering vaasanas that contribute to confusion have been sorted out) - is same as akhandaakaara vRiti - A fancy name for the simple self-evident fact, but being missed due to vaasanaas. 

With that understanding - every thing else or anaatma become vibhuti of my own self. Hence anaatma does not perturb my clear understanding even while I am transacting with the traid - jiiva-jagat-Iswara. 

My apologies to scholars here if they feel offended. 

Could not resist

Hari Om!
