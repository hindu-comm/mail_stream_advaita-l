Dear Sri Chandramouliji,
You are right when you say that a state cannot be beret of both thought and
thoughtlessness. For "a state" is valid only from the vyavaharika point of
view and the very nature of it is built on thoughts and intervening absence
before the next one. In Paramarthata "Atma vyatirekena kinchit naasti ".
Neither the original Upanishads nor the Bhashya ever mentions the term
"akandakara vritti". This has crept in from later commentators attempt to
explain the inexplicable.
Even though the word akandakara is not mentioned you can get a clarity if
you can go thru the Bhashya on Brhadaranyaka where detailed explanation of
" Brahmaivedam sarvam" is being discussed in the beginning.
Pranams,
Aurobind Padiyath
