Correct. Just replace brahmAkAravRtti with brahmapramA, and everything will
be fine.
I hope you know that you were talking about vRtti revealing nature of it's
subject, and such vRtti is called pramA.
vRtti may be of two or three types - pramA, bhrama, ubhayavilaxaNa, should
be noted.

yes, brahman is creator, brahman is jagat, brahman has existence or
knowledge of all or Ananda, etc. are such vRtti-s. Even pot exists - is
such vRtti, because existence is brahman.

These all vRtti-s are apramA, though.
So, if you would have used the term pramA instead of vRtti here, then my
answer to your question would have been 'no'.

Note that only brahmAkArAkhaNDavRtti is pramA(compared to other vRtti-s) in
our system, because it has no bAdha.

I request others, who understand these concepts and can present with
examples in lengthy posts, to write more here for benefit of others.
