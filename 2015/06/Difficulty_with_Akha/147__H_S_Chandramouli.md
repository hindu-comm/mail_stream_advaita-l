Dear Sri Ravi Kiran Ji,


 Reg your query

Dear Sri Anand Ji ,


 Reg << "This is that Devadatta", "You are That", etc. >> ,


 should not the complete statement of the knowledge be of the form << I
recognize This is that Devadatta . I recognize You are That etc >> . I feel
the determinate and indeterminate nature mentioned by you refers to the
Vishaya only and not to the complete understanding. The issue under
discussion is whether such knowledge ( determinate or indeterminate )
includes all three components “ I “ ( pramatru ) , “ recognize “ ( pramana
) and “ this is that Devadatta “ ( prameya ) or not . In my understanding ,
it does.

What do you intend to say by the above understanding ?

Pl clarify the implication of this wrt svarUpa jnAna.."I recognize You are
That"

Thanks

Namaste >>



  Please refer to the thread on “ difficulty with akhandakara vritti “ . I
had posted my understanding of the term “ akhandakara vritti “ to which
certain objections were raised , specially with regards the triputi
pramatru, pramana and prameya. Sri Anand Ji had posted his understanding of
perception. I had sought clarification from him as above specifically
related to my understanding of “ akhandakara vritti “ and objections there
on. You would have seen his response also. Thankfully , he has confirmed my
understanding to be correct.


 That is the context . Sri Anand Ji had used the expression << This is that
Devadatta , You are That etc >> in his post. I just copied the same in my
query. It did not occur to me at that time , nor was it intended by me ,
that “ You are That “ may be construed as the Maha Vakya “ Tatvamasi “ . I
just took it as a common coloquial expression. I hope I am clear.


 Pranams and Regards
