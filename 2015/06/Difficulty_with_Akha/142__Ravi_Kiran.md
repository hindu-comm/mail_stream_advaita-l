ghaTa is illumined by the chidabhAsa  to have ghaTa GYAna  ( ignorance of
the adhiSThAna Brahman where all such GYAna occurs is not removed - bhedam
( ajnAna of Brahma svarUpa) remains as ever before)

While, in case of brahmaGYAna, where it is direct illumination, such bhedam
is removed resulting in jivAtma paramAtma ekatva jnAna ...
