Sreenivasa murthyji - PraNAms

First thanks for your kind mail.

I respect the scholars, even if there are disagreements. My prostrations to all of them.

I only go by the issues and not by personalities. This is my training as a scientist.  I have not read the comments will do so slowly.  I know I am right not out of arrogance but out of clear understanding. 

I plan to discuss this - akhandaakaara vRitti aspect with Swami Paramarthanandaji this Friday when I meet him after his class. I learned a lot from his discourses. 

There is a beautiful sloka and some times puzzling sloka in Vevekachadamani - I think Vidya had commented on this before. 

avijnaate pare tatve shaastraadeestu nishpala|
vijnaatepi pare tatve shaastraadeestu nishpala|| 

This is not pointing out to any body here or elsewhere but to myself that clear understanding of the scriptures is important since it is pointing out to the aparoxa jnaanam - which akhandaakaara vRitti should correspond to. 

Hari Om!

 Dear Sri Sadanandaji,
 Icompletely agree with your observations
 mentioned in the second para of your posting dated 29th june
 2015. Blind followers of the socalled sampradaya will not
 hesitate to crucifya person who gave vent for such thought
 positions.Such crucification of a Vedantinby the
 orthodoxy of India happened in Karnataka during 20th
 century.
 With respectful
 regards,Sreenivasa Murthy.

  Subject: [Advaita-l] Difficulty with
 Akhandakara Vrtti - or more with the word itself.
 
 PraNAms

 The fact is very simple,
 direct and self-evident (that is why it is called no phala
 vyaapti). It is the very subject Knower who is currently
 confused by taking anaatam as the self or aatma. For him,
 teaching is required to recognize or reclaim his true
 nature- End of the Story. 


 It is further complicated first, by the sophisticated word -
 Akhandaakaara vRitti - second sanskrit derivations and
 commentaries, and further commentaries - As I understand:
 The word which neither scriptures used or Shankara used
 but latter Advaita Acharyas had to use it to counter
 arguments of the non-advaitic daarshanikas purvapakshaas.


 Currently I take myself
 what I am not as myself, therefore suffer. I have to drop
 that misunderstanding . That can be dropped by correct and
 clear understanding that involves I am pure sat chit ananda
 but expressing myself with the traid - jiiva-jagat-Iswara -
 in essence I am infinite or aham brahma asmi and
 everything else or anaatma is just appear to be there for
 only transactions and not there from absolute point - For
 this I need the Vedantic teaching which says the world is
 nothing but naama and ruupa with the substantive - the self
 that I am. This understanding has to occur for the mind that
 is confused currently. Hence it can only happen in the
 waking state since inquiry is required using a pramaana by
 the mind that is confused. 

 Krishna puts this in simple direct teaching as
 - sarvabhutastam aatmaanam sarva bhuutanicha aatmani or from
 Bhakti point - yo maam pasyati sarvatra and sarvanca mayi
 pasyati. One who sees himself in everything and everything
 in himself - or one who see Me in everything and everything
 in Me - That seeing or recognition as FACT and not just as
 THOUGHT is self-realization and that factual knowledge
 remains in the mind all the time (provides all the lingering
 vaasanas that contribute to confusion have been sorted out)
 - is same as akhandaakaara vRiti - A fancy name for the
 simple self-evident fact, but being missed due to vaasanaas.


 With that understanding -
 every thing else or anaatma become vibhuti of my own self.
 Hence anaatma does not perturb my clear understanding even
 while I am transacting with the traid - jiiva-jagat-Iswara.


 My apologies to scholars
 here if they feel offended. 

 Could not resist

 Hari Om!
 Sadananda
