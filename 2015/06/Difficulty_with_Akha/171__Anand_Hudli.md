Yes, svarUpa abheda could be described as non-difference of the substratum,
although I prefer to call it non-difference of the essential nature, to
explain better laukika examples such as "this is that Devadatta". Actually,
tAdAtmya is used in different senses by advaitins. For example, advaitins
hold that there is an identity (tAdAtmya) between an object and its
attributes. Or, they could speak of AdhyAsika tAdAtmya, the identity, due
to superimposition, between "this" and "silver" in the erroneous cognition
"this is silver."

So it is clear that tAdAtmya is not precisely the relation between terms
such as "tat" and "tvam" in a nirvikalpaka cognition.
