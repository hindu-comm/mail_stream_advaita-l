If you are translating​



​*​*

*​phala*​ as content(*viShaya*), I don't what to say.

Right from here you are wrong.

If vAdirAja presented like this, I will like to put the blame on him.

It is
Nishparakaraka.

​I'll also like to say that if your understanding is that niShfala =
niShprakAraka, then you need some serious study, at least of
tarka-sa~Ngraha.

I don't know how do you come to niShprakAraka = nirviShaya?
​



> There is no Contentless Vrtti in the world.

What do you mean by contentless: 1. devoid of real content, 2. devoid of
illusory content?

Their is third type of vRtti which has no real or illusory content,
vikalapa-vRtti. So, in this sense there is a contentless vRtti.

You could improve your sentence by adding GYAnAtmaka-vRtti instead of vRtti.

​Sorry, we never say like this. Your understanding is very poor.

​Correct.
​



Then we enter

​ ​

Non-duality.

​I can't understand how could one enter non-duality? Is it a room like
thing?
​

​No need. Without entering a room I can talk about that.
​

​You are talking as if non-duality is a mental modification, like nirodha
of yogI-s. Let me make it clear, it is not.

Now, the objection based on this assumption dissolves.
​

​Yes, correct. We accept.

What's harm in accepting so for us?
​



> It is like hare's horn.

​Get your concepts clear for things appearing in illusion are not accepted
as alIka.
​



It is fictional.

​That's correct, but you are using fictional(*prAtibhAsika*) and hare's
horn(*alIka*) in same sense, which we don't accept.

I've not given any explanation here, because they are quite popular among
any student of advaita-vedAnta.

Just get your concepts cleared by help of others. I'm negating what is
incorrectly blamed on us by you(because a learned person like vAdirAja
can't be so ignorant of ).

If you ask further, and none replies, I'll continue.
