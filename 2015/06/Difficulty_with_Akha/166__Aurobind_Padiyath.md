Dear Sri Chandramouliji,
Hari Om!!
I have not misunderstood you nor your questions. Since the reference was to
Brahma Jnana and Akhandakara Vritti, I thought of giving the difference the
two. As you rightly said the context in which these are being used are to
be taken into consideration and answered.

Hari Om!!!
