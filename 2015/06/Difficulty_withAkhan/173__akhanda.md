The akhandaakaara vrtti is mentioned in the scriptures, though perhaps 
not using the term "akhandaakaara" but as " Brahmakara-vrtti, 
Brahmavrtti or atmakara-vrtti".

Sri Sankaraacharya reproduces some verses from the Tejobindopanishad 
(verses 130 to 133) in his Aparokshanubhuuti, which clearly talks of a 
brahmavrtti (v. 129) and the need to develop it further (v. 131) till it 
grows into maturity (v. 132) (or nishthaaa).

The sequence given in this text also implies that nidhidhyaasana leads 
to samadhi, which leads to the akhandaakaara vrtti.

A very important topic indeed.
