If we consider,

"akhanda" in the sense of "partless" (unitary knowledge of Brahman)

or

the akhaNDAkAratva or niShprakAratva or brahmAkAra of vRttiH as without any
objective qualities, dispelling ignorance of Brahman

I would understand, they will culminate to give the same meaning or
tAtparya is same ( the difference is in the prakriyA used )

Thanks
