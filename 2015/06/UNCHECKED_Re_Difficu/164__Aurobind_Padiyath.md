Sri Chandramouliji,
I do not want to dispute what you quoted and establish my views against
such knowledgeable masters.
A vritti for me is in the vyavaharika level and result of mental activity.
Having said that how can an activity which has limitations of reach
(space)and limited validity in time can be called Akhanda?
Mandukya refers to the Akhanda Aakara vritti in a totally different name
viz. Amanibhava meaning a state or existence of "No mind".

When the Guru tells an apt Shishya "Tat tvam asi " all his vritti settles
like the dropping of kataka fruit in a muddy water. Swami Chinmayanandaji
used to give a very down to earth example of a purgative removing all your
torture of indigestible food and related trauma and leaving you in the
happiness of your own nature. The indigestible food are the vritti that we
have accumulated and the expunged state is the freedom and fullness of your
own nature.
The closest vritti which you can say Akhandaakara is for one who meditates
on Aakasha as Brahman which is explained in the beginning of Chandogyam.
There the vritti that Brahman will be Akhanda since you can't bifurcate the
Aakasha,  but that is not the truth. Aakasha is not Brahman. And your
vritti will be of Aakasha.

Pranams.

Aurobind Padiyath
