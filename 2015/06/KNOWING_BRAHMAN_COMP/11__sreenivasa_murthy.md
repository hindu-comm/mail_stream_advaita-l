 Dear Readers,
 Sri Shankara in his commentary to Sutra 1-1-1 writes :
 sarvasyaAtmatvAcca brahmAstitvaprasiddhiH || AtmA ca Brahma ||
 Is there knowing Brahman incompletely also? NEVER. Eitherone realizes Brahman or does not realize at all. Eitherone knows or does not know. Such titles like "knowing Brahman completely"are misleading and a student is likely to be misled.  What have the members to say regarding such titles?
With respectful regards, Sreenivasa Murthy
