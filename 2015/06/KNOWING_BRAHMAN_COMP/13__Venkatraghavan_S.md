Dear Sri Sreenivasa Murthy,
As the article argues, the use of the word "completely" is in the context
of knowing Brahman in its attribute-less, nirguna form. It looks at several
instances in  shruti and smriti where the word "completely" is used and
shows that in each instance it refers to the nirgunatvam of Brahman.

The article specifically addresses your question at several places when it
says that "completely" does not imply (erroneously) a sumperimposition of
parts on the partless Brahman.

If a student were to read only the title and not the article, they could
get confused - but that is like saying if one chooses to close their eyes
and walk, they will fall. They should simply open their eyes.

Regards,
Venkatraghavan
