Thanks for sharing that. In which scripture does Shankara mentions his? I'd like to read up on it. 

Vivek.

But he also mentions that this Jnanam can be attained either here and now , in this birth itself , called Jivan Mukti or later after reaching Brahma Loka called Krama Mukti . Your first observation above could very well refer to the latter category . They are figuratively considered as having “ attained liberation “ on casting away the current body as those who reach Brahma Loka by this method are not considered to return to this Loka any time later , but attain Moksha at the end of the Kalpa from Brahma Loka itself.

Or, as when a dark room is lit up, the darkness disappears, the chittha shuddhi leads directly to self-realization, for which a study of Vedantic literature is not required. Further, Sri Ramana Maharishi has said that he may have completed most of his sadhanas in his previous birth,  which has fructified in the current birth. This could apply to the saints, who do not seem to have read vedantic literature in their present birth. Sri Ramakrishna was almost an illiterate person, who also forgot how to sign his own name, though he did attend some schooling. His knowledge of Nirvikalpa Samadhi was through direct experience. He may also have finished all of his spiritual readings in an earlier birth and in this birth, that past reading may have speeded up the process of his self-realization.

Though it may not be beneficial in this birth, it is bound to be beneficial in a later births." This could apply to both secular and spiritual knowledge. We see so many child prodigies and some children have been recorded for their ability to recollect their past lives. The child prodigies may have completed their education in their previous lives and may have acquired success in retaining such learning through intense efforts, which fructify in a later birth.
