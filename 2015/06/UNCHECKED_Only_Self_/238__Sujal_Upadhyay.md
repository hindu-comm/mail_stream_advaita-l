Namaste,

It should read 'You can't expect them to be fully developed,else you are a
GYAnI'.

I recalled it from a Discourse on Vivek Chudamani where Sat Sampatti was
being explained. Dont read shastras these days, hence cant quote exact
source.

btw, unlike other members, who are all scholars, I dont remember the
source, just the cream part, the essence. Weak memory.

Hari OM
