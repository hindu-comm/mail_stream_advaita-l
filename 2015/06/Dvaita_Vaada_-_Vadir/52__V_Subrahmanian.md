Every jiva requires two types of jnāna - vyavahāra jnāna and svarūpa jnāna.
The pramāṇas like pratyakṣa, anumāna and śabda are required for obtaining
both the above types of jnāna.  By securing vyavahara jnāna (to dispel
ajnana about vyavahara/vyavahara objects, disciplines like physics, maths,
vyākarana and even vedānta) vyavahāra viṣayaka ajnāna is dispelled.  By
securing svarupa jnāna, the appropriate means and method of applying the
pramanas, the svarupaviṣayaka ajnāna is dispelled.

vyavahāra jnānena vyavahārasiddhiḥ, svarūpa jnānena mokṣasiddhiḥ.

Thereby without employing the terms mūla and tūla avidyā we can explain the
situation.
