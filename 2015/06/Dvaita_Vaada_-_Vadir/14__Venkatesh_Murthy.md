Namaste

किञ्च प्रत्यक्षसचिवा बाध्या भेदश्रुतिः किल ।
बाधकं तद्विरुद्धैक्यवाक्यमित्यपि को वदेत् ॥
Who can say the Bheda Sruti agreeing with PratyakSha - Sense
Perception can be invalidated and the Abheda Sruti against the Bheda
Sruti will make iit invalid?
शस्त्रानुबद्धो हस्तीन्द्रहस्तः शत्रोर्न मारकः ।
शस्त्रेण शकलीभूतः शतॄणां मारकः किल ॥
If Abheda Sruti can make Bheda Sruti invalid it is like you are saying
the King of Elephants fitted with a sword will not kill enemies but it
will kill them after it is cut to pieces with the sword.
उक्तवाक्यार्थनिर्णीत्यै प्रत्यक्षानुसृतिर्नृणाम् ।
त्वं तु हन्ताक्षरोधेऽपि वाक्यार्थे निर्णिनीषसि ॥
Men will follow the Sense Perception experience to decide the meaning
of Sruti Vakya. But alas you will decide the meaning of the Sruti
Vakya is the Literal meaning - वाच्यार्थ even though it is against
Sense Perception.
एवं सत्यग्निना सिञ्चेदिति वाक्यं प्रमापकम् ।
कुतो माभूदक्षरुद्धतदसिद्धार्थबोधकम् ॥
If this is your position why are you not taking the Literal meaning of the Vak
ya Agnina Sinchet - sprinkle the fire? It is against Sense Perception.
गताध्वनि पुनर्गच्छन्मार्गं निश्चिनुतेऽखिलः ।
कदध्वीकुरुषे त्वं तु पताध्वनि पुनर्गतौ ॥
After completing a journey by a road a person always takes the same
road to return. But you will take a bad road to return after your
journey.
स्वाक्षसिद्धतृणाद्यर्थं वदन् शाकुनिकोऽखिलैः ।
किं मान्यते हन्यते वा तत्सिद्धिर्भूषणं गिराम् ॥
A person knowing Omens will predict a thing like a straw and so on.
These things can be proved by Sense Perception. He will be honored if
Sense Perception can prove his saying. Otherwise he will be killed.
The Sense Perception proof is the ornament of his words.
Vaadiraaja is saying we have to test a Sruti Vakya meaning with Sense
Perception. The meaning must and should agree with Sense Perception.
स्वाक्षसिद्धिः स्ववाक्यस्य यदि दूषणमुच्यते ।
तर्हि स्वदुष्टमेवार्थं मानय श्रुतिम् ॥
सर्वज्ञव्यासवाक्यं च श्लोक्यं न स्याज्जगत्त्रये ।
If you accept Sense Perception proving a Vakya is a defect you accept
the Sruti is telling you defective things only. Then the saying of the
Omniscient Vyaasa will not be praiseworthy in the three worlds.

Vaadiraaja is saying if Sruti Vaakya is telling us only defective
things Vyaasa's work of compiling Vedas will not be praiseworthy.

परेण दृष्ट एवार्थे तद्दुर्भ्रान्तित्ववारिका ।
परमाप्ततमस्योक्तिर्व्यर्थीभवति किं वद ॥
The Supremely Trusted Vyaasa has experienced things opposing the Bad
Illusion theory. Tell me why are his words useless?

If everything is a Bad Illusion like Advaitis are saying Vyaasa's
compiling of Vedas and writing Mahabharata and 18 Puranas will be a
waste.
