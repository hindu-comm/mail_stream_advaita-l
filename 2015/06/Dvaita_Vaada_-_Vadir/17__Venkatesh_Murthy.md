Namaste

Moreover Adi Sankara has said in his Gita Bhashya -
यत्तु उक्तम् ‘श्रुतिप्रामाण्यात्’ इति, तत् न; तत्प्रामाण्यस्य
अदृष्टविषयत्वात् । प्रत्यक्षादिप्रमाणानुपलब्धे हि विषये
अग्निहोत्रादिसाध्यसाधनसंबन्धे श्रुतेः प्रामाण्यम्, न
प्रत्यक्षादिविषये, अदृष्टदर्शनार्थविषयत्वात् प्रामाण्यस्य । तस्मात् न
दृष्टमिथ्याज्ञाननिमित्तस्य अहंप्रत्ययस्य देहादिसंघाते गौणत्वं
कल्पयितुं शक्यम् । न हि श्रुतिशतमपि ‘शीतोऽग्निरप्रकाशो वा’ इति ब्रुवत्
प्रामाण्यमुपैति । यदि ब्रूयात् ‘शीतोऽग्निरप्रकाशो वा’ इति, तथापि
अर्थान्तरं श्रुतेः विवक्षितं कल्प्यम्, प्रामाण्यान्यथानुपपत्तेः, न तु
प्रमाणान्तरविरुद्धं स्ववचनविरुद्धं वा ।

Even if a hundred Srutis say 'Fire is cold or not brilliant' it is not
valid. Sruti will be valid only for things not available to us by
Sense Perception. If Sruti may say  'Fire is cold or not brilliant' we
have to take a different meaning. Sruti will not contradict other
Pramanas like Pratyaksha. It will not contradict itself.

In Adhyasa Bhashya -

तस्मादविद्यावद्विषयाण्येव प्रत्यक्षादीनि प्रमाणानि शास्त्राणि चेति ।
Therefore the Pramanas like Pratyaksha and Sastra are for person with
Avidyaa only.
Why? पश्वादिभिश्चाविशेषात् There is no difference from animals in Vyavahara.

पश्वादीनां च प्रसिद्धः अविवेकपूर्वकः प्रत्यक्षादिव्यवहारः ।
तत्सामान्यदर्शनाद्व्युत्पत्तिमतामपि पुरुषाणां
प्रत्यक्षादिव्यवहारस्तत्कालः समान इति निश्चीयते । It is a familiar
fact that the animals use their means of perception etc without
discrimination. From this fact of similarity the conclusion can be
drawn that so far as empirical behaviour is concerned the use of the
means of perception of the wise is similar to that of animals.
