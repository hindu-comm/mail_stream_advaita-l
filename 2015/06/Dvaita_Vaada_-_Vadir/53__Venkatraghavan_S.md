>>>Advaitis have tried two times to explain Pot Illusion. First they say
it is superimposed on Witness Consciousness. It is not correct because
external thing cannot be superimposed on internal consciousness.

All talk of external and internal is itself an avidya.

There is no distinction between external consciousness and internal
consciousness - all consciousness is brahman. There is also no distinction
of external thing and internal thing - all "things", with the exception of
brahman, are mithya.

All illusions can have only one adhisthanam - Brahman. So whether you talk
about the adhyAsa of mind on Brahman, or the adhyAsa of pot on Brahman, the
*nature* of the adhyAsa is the same (even though the Aropita vastu is
different), and very importantly, the *identity* of the adhishthAnam is the
same - Brahman.

Brahman and avidya can and do co-exist. No harm comes to advaita by making
that statement - but it should be understood that avidya's existence is
only a borrowed one. It has no paramArtha sattA.

Regards,
Venkatraghavan
