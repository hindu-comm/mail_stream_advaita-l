Namaste Vivek,

bhagavatgItA kinchiadhItA
gangAjalalava kaNikApItA
sakrudapi yEna murAri samarchA
kriyatE tasya yamEna na charcha 

says Acharya Sankara in bhaja govinda stotram

Again in the same stotram Acharya reiterates as:

gEyaM gItA nAma sahasraM

The meaning is self-explanatory I hope.

Apart from being a mOkSa shAstra, BG is a great user manual for us in our day-to-day life.

Now-a-days, it is being taught in several Management Institutes also for Personality Development,
Stress Management, Skill Upgradation, Personal Excellence, Public Relationship etc. 

So, in laukika vritti also, especially, in pravritti mArga, the BG helps you to excel personally.

In either ways, it is a excellent scripture handed down by Bhagavan Krishna, who was a great politician,
philosopher, acharya, friend and above all a Jagatguru.

regs,
sriram
