Sir,
                          In advaitha Brahman is Termed as Nirguna....the
same brahman is called as Nishkala,Nirvikaara,Shanta,Nithya
Truptha,sat-chit-ananda....etc...

Here
Nishkala meas indivisible,,,,

Nirvikaara meas never changing...

Nithya Truptha...means Self Satisfied..

Shantha,,,,Cool...

Nishkriya...without any activity...

Sat-chit-ananada....Every Happy....


These are not Brahman's attribute???

If these are brahman's attribute definitely brahman is not brahman is
nirguna...

And even we cannot say brahman as avarchaneeya...because we can call
brahman by nirvikaara,shantha...sat-chit-ananda...etc...
