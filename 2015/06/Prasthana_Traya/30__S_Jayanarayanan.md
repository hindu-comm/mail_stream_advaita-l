Not to contradict the Swamiji, but it has been my opinion that they are all PhD's in varying disciplines: Brahma Sutras are a PhD in Logic and Analysis, Upanishads are a PhD in Theology, and Bhagavad Gita is a PhD in Poetry.

If one studies Asthadhyayi with Mahabhashyam fully, then one has mastered Vyakaranam. Similarly in Vedanta, if one studies the Prasthanatrayee, one has mastered Vedanta. Prakarana granthas primarily present extracts of Prasthanatrayee, occasionally expanding upon them. The key difference between Prasthanatrayee and Prakarana granthas is that the latter present only the Siddhanta view and does not get into the Khandana of other views.
