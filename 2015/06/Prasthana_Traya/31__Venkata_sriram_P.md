Namaste,

Dear Sri Nori,

I thought Swami Paramarthananda's recommended order was Bhagvad Gita 
as being the equivalent of Bachelors degree

///

In Sringeri, the Bhagavat Gita is taught at the end.  

There is a step-by-step process in teaching.  One can't expect a tiny tot to study  
calculus and mathematical equations when he is struggling to understand the 
basic mathematics.  

So, best practice is always to follow the path of our traditional acharyas.

regs,
sriram
