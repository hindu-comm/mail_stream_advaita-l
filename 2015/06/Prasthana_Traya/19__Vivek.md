Hari Om,

I was wondering if it is enough to study the Prasthana Traya through talks of Swami Paramarthananda and translations by Swami Gambhirananda (Gita, Upanishads, Brahma Sutras)

If you study those works thoroughly, is there really any need to study any of the Prakarana Grabthas? If so, which ones are the most important ones?

Thanks,
Vivek.
