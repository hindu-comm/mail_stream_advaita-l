This should have appeared in the Forum ID earlier. But looks like it has
been been forwarded to the personal ID. Brought to my attention by Sri Ravi
Kiran Ji. Hence I am forwarding here for info of members. I have also
forwarded the subsequent responses also.

Dear Sri Sadananda Ji,


 Namaskarams.


 There is absolutely no doubt that Realization is a Vyavaharika term only.
This has not been disputed nor comeup in the discussion at all. But my
question remains. You state that


 <<  In all knowledge of x,y,z, there is chidaabhaasa -since mind is
involved.  >> .


 What about the knowledge of Sushupti << I know I slept well >> .
Chidabhasa is dormant/inactive. But still knowledge is there. This
knowledge is therefore not attributable to Chidabhasa.


 We can also consider from another viewpoint , the difference between jada
( inert ) and svaprakasha ( selfevident ) vastu. The fundamental difference
is that for cognizing a jada vastu an illuminating entity is needed whereas
for cognizing a svaprakasha vastu another illuminating entity is not
needed. For both nodoubt mind is involved as the instrument for cognition.
According to you Chidabhasa is needed for both the above cognitions. Then
there is no difference between them.


 My point is Chidabhasa is needed for cognizing all inert vastus . But it
is not needed for cognizing Svaprakasha vastu ( It is so by definition
itself ) . Mind is no doubt needed for both as the instrument for
cognition. Hence my understanding is that Chidabhasa is not responsible for
Realization ( loosely worded as Self cognition ) . Atman/Self being
selfevident no other illuminating entity is needed for that. This was my
earlier question and I think it has not been addressed except restating
that Chidabhasa is responsible and needed for the “ cognition “ of
Atman/Brahman. My earlier observation hence remains.


 That the cognition is at vyavaharika level only has not been disputed .


 Pranams and Regards
