PraNAms

In that Swamiji makes distinction of swaruupa jnaanam vs vRititi jnaanam. Brahma jnaanman is Vritti jnaanam only since it is born out of pramaana. However - (he did not discussed here but discussed elsewhere) that there is no phala vyaati unlike the case of tuula avidya naasha jnaana vRitti  - the destruction of the ignorance of the inert object.

 Brahman jnanam itself involves understanding substratum of everything is nothing but Brahmna and the objective world is only mithyaa. Brahma satyam- jagan mithyaa, jovobramaiva - Hence Brahma jnanam involves understanding I am Brahman meaning I am akhandam and I am there in every perception - pratibhodha viditam. That constant awareness of I am -that raises spontaneously (no phala vyaapti) in the mind is akhandaakaara vRitti jnaanm since it still involves the mind. Determinate and indeterminate perceptions may not have much to do with akhandaakaara vRitti jnaanam.

 Many of the members are familiar with
 the talks of Swami Paramarthananda. I
 was listening to talk no 94 on Bruhadaranyaka Upanishad
 today. Towards the
 end of this talk he very briefly refers to “ akhandakara
 vritti “” and
 asserts the aptness of the term “ vritti “ therein.
 Those who look for
 authoritative confirmation on such issues may like to refer
 to this talk.
 The link is

  serial no. 7 , talk 94. Each serial number covers 12-15
 talks. Hope this
 info is useful.
