Thanks for sharing..

Even though Brahma jnAna or akhandakara vrtti is vRtti jnAna, it is
seamless, without any parts, unlike any other vishaya jnAna..

If we accept any khanda in it, whatsoever and draw similarity with other
vishaya jnANa, there *is* a difference in the comprehension of Brahman and
Brahma jnAna, which verily goes against the Sruti vAkya - brahmavid
brahmaiva bhavati
