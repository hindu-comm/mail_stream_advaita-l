I will be speaking for myself only. To be very brief , in the current context , by Brahma Jnana , I meant “ ajnana naasha “ . By Swarupa Jnanam , I meant Brahman .

praNAms Sri Chandramouli prabhuji
Hare Krishna

Very interesting observation.  Could you please elaborate how ajnAna nAsha i.e. brahma jnAna is not same as svarUpa jnAnaM or realizing that he is brahman??  Are brahma jnAna (ajnAna nAsha) and gaining svarUpa jnAna (brahman) two different steps??  

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
