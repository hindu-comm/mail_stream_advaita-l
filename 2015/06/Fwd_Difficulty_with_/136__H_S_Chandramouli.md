Sri Ravi Kiran observed


 << Not familiar with the term "svarupa Jnana" of Brahman used distinctly
from BrahmajnAna here.. hence, this clarification:

When we say, "svarupa Jnana", it is Brahman itself or knowledge of Brahman,
which is not same as BrahmajnAna ? >>.


 I will be speaking for myself only. To be very brief , in the current
context , by Brahma Jnana , I meant “ ajnana naasha “ . By Swarupa Jnanam ,
I meant Brahman .


 Regards
