Dear Sadananda,

Thanks for your response. I do have the Brahma Sutra talks you mention. I guess if Swamiji decides to do Bhasya classes on BS it will be a while. Gita only being on 13th? Still got some time left on that also then. 

I'm going to try find the PDFs you mentioned in the archives. Thanks for that!

Vivek.

What is going on now are discourses on Shankara Bhasya on Bhagavat Geeta not on Brahmasutra - His is doing now 13th.Ch of Geeta. I have listened to his Brahma suutra's  and I have written extensive write up based on his talks and was posted in both advaitin and advaitaL lists some 10 years ago. I have covered the first 5 sutras along with Adhyaasa Bhaasya. They are available in pdf form in the archives of advaintin list for those who are interested. Some write ups on Nishcala dasa's Vicharasagara also can be found. One can get more info at www.advaitaform.org. and under Discussion on vedanta.
