Sir,

              Can any one tell the meaning (Mainly Vakhyartha) of this
verse from Madukhya Upanishad......in advaitha point of view....


“prapanco yadi vidyeta nevarteta nashamshhayaH |
Maayaamaatram idam Dwaitam
Advaitam paramaarthataH || ”
“ vikalpo vinivarteta kalpito yadi kenacit |


Some this is the verse from Madukhya Upanishad...and some say it is from
Goudapada's Madukhya Karika.......Why this uncertainty...

What is the exact difference between Madukhya karika and Mandukhya
upanishad.....

Please answer...
