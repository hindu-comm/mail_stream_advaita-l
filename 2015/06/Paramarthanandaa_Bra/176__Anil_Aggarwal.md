I have previously been in touch with the Trust that has the exclusive rights for disseminating the lectures and they sent a spreadsheet - which has the list of currently available lectures on CDs.  The only way to get the actual lectures is through these CDs sent via post after paying the published price.  If we want all the lectures, it is a cost of about Rs. 4 lakhs or so per spreadsheet (I may be wrong but the amount was not affordable for many).  I tried this route by finding a student going to Chennai, giving the appropriate cost for His Bhagavad Gita classes and received upon his return a box of CDs, which I then copied to my computer and transferred to my android phone for easy listening.  The Trust has a website where 4 recent lectures can be heard but it is "rolling" and if we miss one, it is gone.
