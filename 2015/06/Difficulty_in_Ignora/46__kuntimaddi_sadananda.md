Sreenivasa Murthyji – PraNAms

Your questions are loaded. There are others who can provide better answers to your questions.  I can only provide my understanding.

Epistemologically, Knowledge without a qualifier cannot be defined. It is only knowledge of some x or y; which are by definition objective knowledge. Pure unqualified knowledge that which is undefinable is what Vedanta calls it as jnaanam as in satyam, jnaanam, anantam- brahma. Hence it refers to pure consciousness and is therefore undefinable other than saying it is infinite – prajnanam brahma. 

Hence when we are discussing the tula avidya we are discussing ignorance of objectifiable entities – say, physics, chemistry, astrology, etc. If I ask you, Do know Chemistry- the very question implies an objectifiable entity, and you can say – I do not know or I know. When I asked, in response, you have looked into your memory and based on the information report that I know or I do not know – in essence it is-  I know that I know orI know that I do not know.  You have the knowledge of the presence or the absence of the knowledge of chemistry – viditam vaa avidtam vaa – That YOU KNOW. Here we used the word – knowledge two times. I know that I know and I know that I do not know. The first KNOW does not refer to any particular knowledge while the second one does. The first one refers to pure consciousness and the second one refers to the vRitti jnaanam. Hence in Kenopanishat – it says consciousness is revealed in every knowledge – pratibodha
 viditam matam; our problem is we are paying attention to the second know and ignoring the first one. This is one way of looking at the two types of knowledge.

Actually, in the perceptual knowledge (elaborately analyzed in say, Vedanta Paribhaasha in terms of perceptuality condition – for reference, I have provided a critical analysis of the text and is stored in the website www.advaitaforum.org. But there are  other texts also available on the epistemological issues), this aspect has been discussed in terms of perceptuality condition – where consciousness of the subject and existence of the object expressed as vRitti are joining together for one to be conscious of the existence of the object. Thus we have vRitti jnaanam when I know chemistry that removes the avidya vRitti of Chemistry – This is called vRitti vyaapti and phala vyaapti (Shree Pranipataji pointed in his mail to me after seeing my post in the list that the terms vyaapti is used for this). This in all objective knowledge – there is vRitti vyaapti and phala vyaapti. – I did not know chemistry and now I know chemistry. Jnaana vRitti is
 required to dis-cover or to remove the ignorance covering the knowledge of chemistry. In essence knowledge of Chemistry is eternal but I am removing bit by bit by jnaana vRitti as I learn Chemistry. 

Only problem in the objective knowledge is the more you uncover the more one finds what is uncovered is very little compared what is covered. Hence one becomes super specialist in narrower and narrower area – in mathematics it is called delta function – knowing more and more about less and less. However in all these the first knowledge ever remains the same – I KNOW – that I know this and I do not that etc. Scientists only dis-cover laws - not invent them - implying they uncovered the cover that is covering the knowledge. This discovery is done using pramanas- pratyaksha, anumaana etc. Pramana is means of uncovering the cover over objective knowledge. 


How to know about the Knower, who knows and is present in every knowledge? – now we are asking about the self-knowledge. Truth is one cannot know - since it is aprameyam not an object of knowledge. Yet I do not know this Knower. The problem here is even though I KNOW is there or knower is there in every knowledge (pratibodha viditam) yet I do not this knower – for one thing it is the subject I which cannot be objectified and second is due to muula avidya – I take myself to be other than what I am – hence I identify this first knower (whom Krishna calls as kshetrajna) is local buddhi, which itself is an object of this knower! Hence I have misconceptions about this knower, I, as I take myself to be I am this, this starting from buddhi. I am the subject and this is an object. The ignorance of myself is self-evident in this very equation. This forms the fundamental ignorance or muula avidya.

 Since I KNOW is there in every knowledge, but I am not paying attention to it due to lack of clear understanding of the nature of this - I Know. For this only I need Vedanta which points 1) that I am pure consciousness that enlivens  the buddhi as instrument of knowledge and 2) more importantly even the instruments and the means – all nine yards also I am as I am the upaadaana kaaraNa of the buddhi and the objective world also. 

Ramanuja for example differentiates the objective knowledge as dharma bhuta jnaanam since it involves vRitti jnaanam and dharmi jnaanam or self-knowledge, without involving vRitti. Since objects (and thus creation) is infinite (virat purusha) a dharma bhuuta jnaanam for a jiiva is always limited and he can never become sarvajna like Iswara and therefore He cannot create like Iswara in his model. Hence jiiva becomes angee or part of the total virat purusha or Brahman.  

Advaita Vedanta emphasizes the fact that – eka vijnanaane sarva vijnaanam bhavati – when I know – referring to the the first KNOW as I am that very knower and that I am is Brahman , then other objective knowledge reduces to the knowlkedge of superficial names and forms, without any substantive  (adhiShTaanam) of their own, or essentially reduces to mithyaa jnaanam. Hence I have substantive knowledge when I know I am Brahman and that is not phalam as in objective knowledge since I am all the time Brahman even when I do not know that I am Brahman. Hence inquiry is required using Vedanta. – tat vijnaasva – brahma jignaasa – where inquiry is required or jnaana vRitti is required to remove my misconceptions about myself to dis-cover I am Braham. Since Brahman cannot be covered, even the so-called discovery is also mithyaa only. Hence there is no phalavyaapti only vRitit vyaapti intems of vedanta vichaara. 

I do not know if I have addressed your question properly. I just wrote what came to my mind.

Hari Om!

 Dear Sri Sadnanda,
  I request you to clarify in what sense you have used
 the word "knowledge" in the sentence "removing the obstacles
 covering the knowledge". Who illumines the existence of the
 obstacles?Who is the remover of the obstacle? These
 questions arose inwhen going through your reply. As a
 scientist, have you cognized the existence of these two
 kinds of ignorance?As a self-evident, self-evident
 principleI am not aware of these two kinds of avidyas.
 Will you please help me in cognizing these two avidyas in my
 anuBava. IKNOW that I do not know.This isin my
 anuBava. To which category of avidya doe it belong
 to?Please help me in understanding your statements so that
 I can start doing sadhana toget rid of the two avidyas.
 A statement can never be established as a fact by giving
 an analogy. It has to be shown as a fact in one's own
 anuBava or life.
 With respectful pranams,Sreenivasa Murthy

 PraNAms

 Jast a note: 

 For tula avidya there is jnaana VRitti and phala vRitti
 while for muula avidya, there is jnana vRitti but no phala
 vRitti, since self knowledge is self-revealing and not a
 product of some Vritti. Jnana vRitti is required to remove
 the obstacles covering the knowledge. Sureswara provide a
 beautiful example to illustrate this.

 In a pitch dark room one cannot see anything. To see
 anything a light (say torch light ) is needed. As I focus
 the light on each object, each object gets revealed - that
 is jnana vRitti to reveal the object and phala is result of
 the knowledge of the object. 

 In the process I see a pot upside down. To see the pot I
 need the torch light. Out of curiosity, I lift the pot to
 see what is inside. I find a candle burning there. Now do I
 need the torch light to see the burning candle? Same thing
 applies to muula avidya. I need vedanta shastra jnaanam for
 removing the obstacles covering the knowledge. However there
 is no phala vRitti since what is discovered is what has been
 evident all the time.

  Dear Sri Venkatesh Murthy
  ji,



  Regarding your observation


  << But the words
  मूलाविद्या and
  तूलाविद्या are not found in Sankara
  Prasthana Traya Bhashyas. May be they were
  explained by later
  Advaitis. >> ,


  it is no
  doubt true. In fact what I had mentioned in my post was
  based on
  one of the schools of thought
  elaborating on the Bhashyam. There are other
  schools of thought as well. But to answer your
  main question without
  getting into these
  alternate schools of thought I recap your question here
  again.


  << If the earlier
  covering Ignorance is destroyed when I see the
  pot how can the second
  Ignorance - Adhyaasa
  arise? If the first covering Ignorance is
  destroyed the second Ignorance must not arise.
  Because Vaadiraaja says
  Advaitis say the
  Avaraka Ajnana - covering Ajnana is the Material
  Cause of the Adhyaasa. Then if this is true I
  must not see the pot. >> .


  Covering Ignorance, second
  Ignorance - Adhyasa , Pot ( using your
  terminology ) can all be considered as products
  of one and the same Avidya
  , akin to several
  crystals of salt and the Ocean itself. ( All the salt
  crystals are products of one and the same Ocean
  water only ) . There is
  nothing like first
  Ignorance, second Ignorance etc. Destruction of one or
  more of the salt crystals has no effect on the
  other crystals or the Ocean
  itself. Thus the
  view of Sri Vadiraja , as stated by you , has no
  validity.



  Regards
