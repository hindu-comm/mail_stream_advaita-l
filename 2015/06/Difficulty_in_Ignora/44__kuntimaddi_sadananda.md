PraNAms

Jast a note: 

For tula avidya there is jnaana VRitti and phala vRitti while for muula avidya, there is jnana vRitti but no phala vRitti, since self knowledge is self-revealing and not a product of some Vritti. Jnana vRitti is required to remove the obstacles covering the knowledge. Sureswara provide a beautiful example to illustrate this.

In a pitch dark room one cannot see anything. To see anything a light (say torch light ) is needed. As I focus the light on each object, each object gets revealed - that is jnana vRitti to reveal the object and phala is result of the knowledge of the object. 

In the process I see a pot upside down. To see the pot I need the torch light. Out of curiosity, I lift the pot to see what is inside. I find a candle burning there. Now do I need the torch light to see the burning candle? Same thing applies to muula avidya. I need vedanta shastra jnaanam for removing the obstacles covering the knowledge. However there is no phala vRitti since what is discovered is what has been evident all the time. 

Hari Om!

 Dear Sri Venkatesh Murthy
 ji,



 Regarding your observation


  << But the words
 मूलाविद्या and
 तूलाविद्या are not found in Sankara
 Prasthana Traya Bhashyas. May be they were
 explained by later
 Advaitis. >> ,


  it is no
 doubt true. In fact what I had mentioned in my post was
 based on
 one of the schools of thought
 elaborating on the Bhashyam. There are other
 schools of thought as well. But to answer your
 main question without
 getting into these
 alternate schools of thought I recap your question here
 again.


  << If the earlier
 covering Ignorance is destroyed when I see the
 pot how can the second
 Ignorance - Adhyaasa
 arise? If the first covering Ignorance is
 destroyed the second Ignorance must not arise.
 Because Vaadiraaja says
 Advaitis say the
 Avaraka Ajnana - covering Ajnana is the Material
 Cause of the Adhyaasa. Then if this is true I
 must not see the pot. >> .


  Covering Ignorance, second
 Ignorance - Adhyasa , Pot ( using your
 terminology ) can all be considered as products
 of one and the same Avidya
 , akin to several
 crystals of salt and the Ocean itself. ( All the salt
 crystals are products of one and the same Ocean
 water only ) . There is
 nothing like first
 Ignorance, second Ignorance etc. Destruction of one or
 more of the salt crystals has no effect on the
 other crystals or the Ocean
 itself. Thus the
 view of Sri Vadiraja , as stated by you , has no
 validity.



 Regards
