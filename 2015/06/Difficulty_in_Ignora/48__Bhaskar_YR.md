But the words मूलाविद्या and तूलाविद्या are not found in Sankara Prasthana Traya Bhashyas. May be they were explained by later Advaitis.

Not meant for any debate.  Just sharing my thoughts after reading the above sentence.  Yes, there is no mention of jeevAshrita tulAvidyA and brahmAshrita mUlAvidyA in shankara's prasthAna traya works.  And the ignorance which has produced the indefinable 'snake' in the rope is called tUlAvidyA in vyAkhyAnakAra's works and obviously they say it is something different from brahmAshrita mUlAvidyA.  If this mUlAvidyA is quite different and it has the locus in brahman itself then to get rid of this mUlAvidyA, first jeeva has to get rid of his / her individual tUlAvidyA and then he should concentrate on eradication of mUlAvidyA.  But this mUlAvidyA has the Ashraya of brahman itself, so for the eradication of this brahmAshrita mUlAvidyA, jeeva has to first become brahman and then try to do the sAdhana which helps him to achieve it.  Moreover as per vyAkhyAnakAra-s, mUlAvidyA is anirvachaneeya, anAdi without any AkAra, amsha or avasthA but at the same time they are telling mUlAvidyA's part (amsha) is tUlAvidyA and both (mUla & tUlAvidyA) will get removed by the aid of Atma vidyA simultaneously.  If that is the case, what is the need of this bifurcation in avidyA and attributing one avidyA to brahman and another avidyA to jeeva??  After the effacement of tUlAvidyA what would be the status of jeeva?? Is he continue to identify himself with BMI due to mUlAvidyA though there is absence of rUlAvidyA??  What is the fruit (phala) of eradication of tUlAvidyA ?? how this is different from phala of mUlAvidyA vinAshaM??  Like this lot of questions arises in one's mind and unfortunately we donot have any source in prasthAna trayi bhAshya to get these doubts clarified.  

Anyway kindly don’t think I am starting a separate thread for debate  on mUlAvidyA and tUlAvidyA.  If what you heard already  about it is suffice to counter the dvaitins' objection, you can just skip this mail and goahead with your defense of advaita. 

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar

Namaste

Many thanks and Pranams to Sri Chandramouli and Sri Venkataraghavan for explaining so nicely and it is like Lord Siva Chandramouleeshwara and Lord Vishnu Venkataraghava both have cleared my doubt. A brief answer may be given.

Brahman is the Ashraya for मूलाविद्या the Root Ignorance. If we have to know Brahman the मूलाविद्या must be removed. Then we know Brahman.
Similarly any object like Pot is the Ashraya for तूलाविद्या the Modal Ignorance. If we have to know Pot the तूलाविद्या must be removed. When we see a Pot the तूलाविद्या  'Veil of Ignorance' gets destroyed by Pot Vrtti and we know the pot. But the Pot Adhyaasa is still there. It is not destroyed. Why? Because the मूलाविद्या is not destroyed. It is the Material Cause for the Adhyaasa of pot and all objects in the world.
Unless and until the मूलाविद्या is destroyed the Adhyaasa will not be destroyed. Sravana, Manana and Nididhyaasana are required to destroy मूलाविद्या.

But the words मूलाविद्या and तूलाविद्या are not found in Sankara Prasthana Traya Bhashyas. May be they were explained by later Advaitis.
