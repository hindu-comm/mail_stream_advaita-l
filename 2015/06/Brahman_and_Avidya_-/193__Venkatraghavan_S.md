Sri Aurobind,

>>Do you say that mAyA which has no fundamental existence has a location in
Brahman?
Yes, with one small change to the wording - mAyA which has no fundamental
existence, *appears to exist* in Brahman.

 That apparent existence is only possible because of brahman lending
existence to it.

Regards,
Venkatraghavan
