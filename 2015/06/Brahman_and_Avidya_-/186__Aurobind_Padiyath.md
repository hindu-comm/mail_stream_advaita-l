Sri Venkatraghavanji,
Hari Om!!!
First let me define each terms I will be using for clarity then the
explanations
1. Brahman, Atma are synonyms and are used as interchangeable. Since both
of are Achintyam and Avachayam we can only use the roopam in which the
Brahma swaroopam or Atma swaroopam is standing for the expressive aspects
of respective Tatwams, only for comprehension purpose and not in Reality.
2. Avidya The general mistake that takes place here is many a places it is
used instead of Maya. While Maya is the shakti of Eswara Avidya is the
mis-apprehension of the non-aprehending objects. While one is the cause the
other is a result. Since the cause is in the result this error happens.
3. Jnana and knowledge. As you rightly said the difference should be clear.
While Jnana is self effulgent in nature knowledge needs Thrpudi of the
object subject and the act of knowing. Mistaking for one to another can
lead to confusion.

Now to my views:
Brahman and Avidya are mutually exclusive and will not co-exist. Tamah
prakashyoh viruda swabhavat. But Brahman and Maya can, as Maya is the
wielding power which gives rise to Adhyasa or mis-apprehensions. The best
example for is Light and Darkness itself. There is no independent existence
for Darkness. But it can encroach into areas where the light becomes weak
and Darkness can be seen only in the presence of Light. But only Light can
dispel darkness not the other way. This power of Darkness to encroach into
areas of Light with the permission of light is the example for the power of
Darkness or Maya.

Avidya is a result of the encroachment of darkness into areas of light and
in pure light it has no existence. Nor in absolute darkness where the
existence of the mistaken object itself is unknown.

Now to the location of Avidya. Avidya is located only in the anthakarana as
it is a product of Budhi upon the influence of Maya. This Avidya can be
identified only in the waking Budhi. One to be aware of that, it has to be
part of his Sareera as he recognizes it as I am ignorant, I do not know
etc.. In the deep sleep since This experince of even the sareera is absent,
even the ignorance is absent hence my statement that in deep sleep there is
no Avidya.

When we say Brahman is Virodhi to Avidya do not mean Brahman is Virodhi to
Maya. Brahman is Virodhi to Avidya because it,Avidya, being the effect gets
destroyed in Brahma Jnana. But a Jnani can differentiate the play of Maya
while established in Brahman and does not get deluded, like seeing a
mirage. For him Maya is a non existent aspect of Brahman appearing to be
there until the Videha Mukthi or Jeevan Mukthi takes place. There after he
becomes Brahman till then he is only a Jnani. Brahmavith Brahmaiiva Bhavati.

Pranams.
