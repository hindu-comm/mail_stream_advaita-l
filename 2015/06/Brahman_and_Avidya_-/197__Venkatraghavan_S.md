Sri Aurobind,
Both Atma gyAna and Atma avidyA are in the vyAvahArika plane only.

When talk of Atma avidyA removal is made, it is to be understood to mean to
remove the notion that Atma avidyA has any fundamental existence. SAdhana
is needed to realise that SAdhana is not needed.

>From a paramArthika point of view, there is nothing to remove, nothing to
be realised, no bandha, no mumukshu, no gyAni. Brahman is ever attained,
hastAmalaka-vat.

Regards,
Venkatraghavan
