Namasthe,

Does any body know about remedial mesaures from  Ramayana during different dasa bhukti periods? I would like know which sargam for a khandam is to be read when one is having a particular dasa and bhukti. I was told that a text by name Rama-bhakti-kalpa-latika carries this information. If some body has the text and can share I would appreciate or if they know and share it that's also appreciated.

Thanks
Ramani
