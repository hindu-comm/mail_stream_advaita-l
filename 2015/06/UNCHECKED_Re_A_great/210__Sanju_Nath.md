प्रणाम,

It has been a great pleasure to know about the great contributions of  Sri Sriramachandrudu Achaarya.   I have been hearing one lecture daily of शंकर भाष्य of भगवद् गीता by one of his eminent शिष्य श्री Karnam Arvinda Rao guru in Advaita Academy, and it is enlightening to know the great परम्परा from which I partake whatever little knowledge I am able to imbibe.

धन्यवाद 
संजू
