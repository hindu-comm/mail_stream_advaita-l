Sri Chandramouli

>> But according to Advaita , this is not something to be just understood (
the way we study and understand any other subject ), but something to be
realized intuitively ( aparoksha ).

Just wanted to clarify here - aparoksha gyAna, stated several times by
Swami ParamarthAnanda is simply knowledge about the true nature of myself.
There is no "mystical" element or "intuition".

There is a chance that as used in that statement, it could be wrongly
interpreted that understanding or knowledge is insufficient, which I
understand to eminently not to be.

Regards,
Venkatraghavan
