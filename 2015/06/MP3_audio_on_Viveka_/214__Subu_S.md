Dear Members
Namasthe
I'm honoured to be allowed into this erudite list. Thanks to the list mods and fellow members for letting me in. 

I'm interested in listening to proper chanting of Viveka Chudamani, the mula slokas (NOT a pravachan). Should any of you have a Mp3 audio file of a proper chanting of the moola slokas could you pl share it with me on this e mail ? or share the URL / link ?
thanks in adv and pranams again
