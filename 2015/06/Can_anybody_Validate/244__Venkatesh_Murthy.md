Namaste

We should not discuss Matha politics here. Who is correct? Who is
wrong? Who knows? This politics is all because of Maayaa. We should
not be worried by it. Because Maayaa is not real. Like Maayaa will
take Ashraya under Brahman this politics is taking Ashraya under
Mathas. But the wise man will know this and will separate Maayaa from
Brahman. The dull person will get affected by Maayaa.
