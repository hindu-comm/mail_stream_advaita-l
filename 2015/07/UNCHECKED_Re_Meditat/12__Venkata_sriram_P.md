Namaste,

Initially, it would be difficult owing to the formation squint eye.  By practice, it would be
steady gaze.

But prior to this, initially, one is advised to do "trATaka" abhyAsa ie., gazing constantly
at the fixed object (preferably a small dot) which winking of the eyelids.  A maximum of 
10 inches distance should be maintained while gazing at the dot. 

As one achieves the perfection in the gazing, the quick movements of the sight gets reduced
and one would be able to fix the gaze for a longer period without closing the eyelids.  

Then, the next stage of meditation should be on tip of the nose ie., nAsAgra.  Many are of the
opinion that nAsAgra means the junction of two eyebrows ie., bhrukuTi (the seat of AjnA chakra).
But, the ideal position is the nose tip which is clearly visible through eyes open.

abhyAsa is very important.  It is the constant practice which yields results.

regs,
sriram
