Namaste, 

When the guru initiates a disciple to sanyasa he gives a new name to the disciple for his new life (initiation is considered a new birth). It is evident that Shri Govinda Bhagavadpada found that his disciple had the name of none other than Lord Shiva and no other name can be more appropriate than that for his this disciple. That I think could be the reason why Adi Shankara's name was not changed after initiation to Sannyasa.

 Namasthe
                      Thanx for remanding such
beautiful stories.
Coming to Ravi Kiran sir ,
                        My question is not
misguided queries,My question is genuine doubt,
I din't question about sanyasathva of adi shankara and his guru parampara,I
got a doubt ,when all sanyasis have different purvashrama and sanyashrama
name,why not shankaracharya has such different names.....And my doubt is
cleared by learned scholars of this form.

I too have great respect to adi shankaracharya,And mine is not kutharka.It
 is correct question.

Regards,
Harsha Bhat
