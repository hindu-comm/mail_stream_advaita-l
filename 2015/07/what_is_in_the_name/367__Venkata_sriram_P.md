Namaste,

/////

That I think could be the reason why Adi Shankara's 
name was not changed after initiation

////

There are exceptional cases in modern times also.

Bhagavan Ramana doesn't have any yOga-paTTa but 
is respected and held in high esteem by all the AchAryAs
of sringeri.  

However, it shouldn't be taken as either way.  One shouldn't move away
from tradition and achAra.  

regs,
sriram
