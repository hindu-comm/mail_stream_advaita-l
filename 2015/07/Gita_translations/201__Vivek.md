Hari Om,

Speaking about translations and not commentaries. 

I have two translations of the Gita, one by Swami Gambhirananda (Shankara Bhasya by RK Math) and one from Gitapress and find the English translations very different. 

For the study of Vedanta, is one preferred?

Could someone elaborate on this?

Appreciated,
Vivek.
