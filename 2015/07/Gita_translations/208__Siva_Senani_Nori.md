Namaste

For pocket edition, Gita Press translations (i.e. simple translations, without explanations) are good. To check if any given edition is in line with Advaita or not, pick one or two Slokas for which you have read the Bhashya and check the translations to see whether they agree with Saankarabhaashya or not. For instance, in the famous Sloka सर्वधर्मान् परित्यज्य, Bhagavatpada explains that dharmAn = dharmAn ca, adharmAn ca; or in the Sloka द्वाविमौ पुरुषौ लोके the aksharaH purushaH is defined by Sankaracharya as Bhagavan's MaaayaaSakti.
