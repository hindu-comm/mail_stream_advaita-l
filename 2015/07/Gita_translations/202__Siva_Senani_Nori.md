Translation by Swami Gambhirananda is according to Sankaracharya's Bhashya. Gita Press books are of very good quality, except their explanations of Gita, which do not follow one particular Acarya's commentary.
By all means go for the Swami's translation.

 Subject: [Advaita-l] Gita translations

Hari Om,

Speaking about translations and not commentaries. 

I have two translations of the Gita, one by Swami Gambhirananda (Shankara Bhasya by RK Math) and one from Gitapress and find the English translations very different. 

For the study of Vedanta, is one preferred?

Could someone elaborate on this?

Appreciated,
Vivek.
