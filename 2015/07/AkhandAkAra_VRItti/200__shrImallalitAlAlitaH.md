​Actually those who can't understand that we are talking of vyvahAra-level
and trying to fit advaita-vedAnta to pratikarma-vyavastha, which is
loka-siddha, can't understand these intricacies.
vedAnta doesn't accept that attributeless brahman can be revealed in
saMsArAvasthA, that too by ghaTa-GYAna.​
