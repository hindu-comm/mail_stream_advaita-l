Venkata sriram sir,
                                         I also even heard that some
Advaithis call madhvacharya as Madhu dvaithya. May I know the person and
where he called madhvacharya as Madhu  daithya???


I heard that Vidhyaranya called madhvacharya as madhu daithya in Madaveeya
shankara vijaya....Is it true??
