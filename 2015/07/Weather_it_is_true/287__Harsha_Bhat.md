Namaskara,
                                  I have heard a famous madhva pontiff
saying, vidhyaranya got defeated by akshobhya thirtha at mulibagilu kolar
district karnataka,on the vakhyartha of tat-tvam asi..
Where vedantha deshika (famous vishitadvaitha vidhwan)...as the
mediator....declares akshobhya thirtha as the winner.And also as
vidhyaranya was vidhya paksha pathi...he created a monument with this
regard of his defeat at mulibagilu...

I have seen many madhva websites saying  so...

Weather vidhyaranya got defeated by akshobhya thirtha?

Can any learned scholars ,tell the truth behind this...
