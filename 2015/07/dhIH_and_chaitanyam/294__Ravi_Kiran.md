and this is our experience

In this sentence,

the body illumined by Kutastha is *more* illumined by the light of Kutastha
reflected in the intellect (Chidabhasa)

Any thoughts, why the *more* is used here (body is more illumined by the
light of chidabhasa) ? Is it only in the sense that it is a more common
experience of all beings ?

ps: understand the "more" usage in the wall example as being much brighter
when compared to direct Sun rays
