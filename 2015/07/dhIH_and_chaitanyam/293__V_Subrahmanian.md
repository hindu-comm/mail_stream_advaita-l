The Panchadashi gives the example of a wall being illumined by the Sun,
which is a general illumination of the wall. Supposing a mirror (many
different mirrors) is placed in front of the wall so as to capture the
Sun's reflection and at the same time to direct the mirror-sun on to the
wall. Now, apart from the general sun-illumination there is another
mirror-illumination, a bright patch on the wall.

The general illumination (on the wall) is the Kutastha illumining the body.

The mirror-illumination (on the wall) is the chidābhāsa illumining the
body.

While the former is always there, the latter keeps fluctuating, in deep
sleep it is not there (the I-experience is not there).

When one reads the entire chapter one can appreciate a lot of vedantic
points.  The English translation is available here:

However it is best to learn it under an Acharya who will have a commentary
too to explain from.

This brighter patch is the chidābhāsa.
