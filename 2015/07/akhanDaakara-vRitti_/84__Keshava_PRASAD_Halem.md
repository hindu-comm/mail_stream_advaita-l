namastE.praNaams My Dear श्रीमल्ललितालालितः

[i further corrected the changed title of the thread -the correction, picked up from your usage, is an indication of my ZERO-knowledge of samskRtam]
It seems to me, if i have read your posts/mails carefully enough without misunderstanding, that you are in the process of propounding this idea:"akhanDaakara-vRitti" = "niShprakaaraka-vRtti". Am i right?That is great. Godspeed to your efforts.However, coming to the details, i have raised some questions in my earlier posts/mails that i wish to get answered/clarified by you. The reason is that my subtle-sense (sUkShma-buddhih) is sensing some possible inconsistency/inadequacy somewhere, unless you are in the process of working it out now after having read those of my questions that i posed yesterday - see may last several emails/posts for which i am still waiting for your response.Keshava PRASAD HalemanemOkShakaamaarthadharmahjanmanaa jaayatE jantuḥ | samskaaraat hi bhavEt dvijaḥ || vEda-paaThaat bhavEt vipra | brahma jnaanaat hi braahmaNah ||
