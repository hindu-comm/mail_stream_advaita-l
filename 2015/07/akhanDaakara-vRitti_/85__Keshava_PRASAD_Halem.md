namastE.praNaams My Dear श्रीमल्ललितालालितः

We are talking about vyavahAra; vRtti-janya-jnAna inparticular.


Let us consider any object in the vyavahArika that is theusual perceptible world, say a simple ghaTa and a simple paTa.A knowledge of the ghaTa arises from the ghaTAkAra-vRtti asusually understood.A knowledge of the paTa  arises from the paTAkAra-vRtti  as usually understood.

What will be that knowledge of the same ghaTa/paTa arisingfrom an akhanDAkAra-vRtti associated with it?
You said that it will be of the nature of viShEShaNa-rahita or nirviShEShaNa . . .


So then we can consider the following four cases: (1) "ghaTAkAra-vRtti-janya-jnAna   of the ghaTa" on the one hand, and(2) "akhanDAkAra-vRtti-janya-jnAna of the ghaTa" on the other hand. 
and again, 
(3) "paTAkAra-vRtti-janya-jnAna    of the paTa" on theone hand, and(4) "akhanDAkAra-vRtti-janya-jnAna of the paTa"on the other hand. 

Of course we accept that (1) & (3) will be quitedifferent! 

Will it be that (1) & (2) [as also (3) & (4)] be the same knowledge, ordifferent?If same why same?If different why different, and how muchdifferent will be those two from one another?Will it be that (2) & (4) be the same knowledge, ordifferent?If same why same?If different why different, and how muchdifferent will be those two from one another?
I am eagerly waiting for you response.Keshava PRASAD HalemanemOkShakaamaarthadharmahjanmanaa jaayatE jantuḥ | samskaaraat hi bhavEt dvijaḥ || vEda-paaThaat bhavEt vipra | brahma jnaanaat hi braahmaNah ||

[i further corrected the changed title of the thread -the correction, picked up from your usage, is an indication of my ZERO-knowledge of samskRtam]
It seems to me, if i have read your posts/mails carefully enough without misunderstanding, that you are in the process of propounding this idea:"akhanDaakara-vRitti" = "niShprakaaraka-vRtti". Am i right?That is great. Godspeed to your efforts.However, coming to the details, i have raised some questions in my earlier posts/mails that i wish to get answered/clarified by you. The reason is that my subtle-sense (sUkShma-buddhih) is sensing some possible inconsistency/inadequacy somewhere, unless you are in the process of working it out now after having read those of my questions that i posed yesterday - see may last several emails/posts for which i am still waiting for your response.Keshava PRASAD HalemanemOkShakaamaarthadharmahjanmanaa jaayatE jantuḥ | samskaaraat hi bhavEt dvijaḥ || vEda-paaThaat bhavEt vipra | brahma jnaanaat hi braahmaNah ||
