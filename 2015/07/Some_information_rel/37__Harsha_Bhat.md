Sir,

                         I don't know about Sri srivathsa 's doubts.....But

One thing Dharmastala temple is not founded by madhvacharya,but by Vadiraja
swami as said by Madhvas...But  Virendra hegde's Family says that the
temple is founded by Annappa Daiva....

And Regarding Madhvacharya calling Shankara as manimantha
Daithya...Madhvacharya himself calls Shankara as Manimantha Daithya in
Mahabhrath Tatparya Nirnya

His followers even today chant vayustuthi were they worship madhvacharya as
hanuman who killed manimantha daithya (Shankara) in his previous birth...

Some of madhva's like narayana pandithacharya call shankaracharya as
widow's Son,he even defame Ubaya Barathi (Sringeri Sharadamba)...with very
ugly stories in his book Manimanjari and Sumadhva Vijaya....


Regards,
Harsha Bhat
