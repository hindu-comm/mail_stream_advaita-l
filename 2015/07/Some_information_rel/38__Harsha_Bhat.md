Sir
                       How sure are you that krishna came from idol and was
sitting on madhvacharya's lap???

Weather he came in your dream and said like that???...that is also can be
created story by some dvaithis maybe....

According to agama shastra udupi krishna's Idol is Idol of Subramanya
Swami.....

And other Thing..Mahabharatha Tatparya nirnaya...Is a book by
madhvacharya...It is well known fact that he called shankara as manimantha
Daithya in that book...

And narayana pandithacharya...who lived in madhvacharya's time wrote book
manimanjari where he calls shankara as widows son( U got its meaning
!!!!)...
He even wrote in ugly language about relation ship of shankaracharya with
Ubhaya Bharathi (Sringeri sharadamba)...etc..
