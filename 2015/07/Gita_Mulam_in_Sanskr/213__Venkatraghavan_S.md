Pranams to all the scholars here

This list is a treasure trove for seekers and experts. I'm equally amazed
at the amount of advaita literature available online. The LORD (or the
brahman) does NOT leave us alone (us=> those limited by the upAadhi's).
Advaitik Knowledge follows even when we are wandering on the net ! Lists
like these are living proof that knowledge is found everywhere for the
earnest seeker. All I have to remember "..Atman Atman nithyamanthrayata.."

By the way I am looking for an online version with the Gita Mulam in
Sanskrit + Shri Adi Shankara's Bashyam translated into English. I know the
Gita Super site has something like this, but that's available verse by
verse (as far as I know). I'm looking for online version of the whole book
, IF available

thanks and pranams again


PS : I'm looking for Shri Adi shankar Bashyam only and not Gita press
Gorakpur etc. I have a hard copy of the Gita Press version.  --

Regards
Subu
