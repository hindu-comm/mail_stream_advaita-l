Now a question:Is it possible for one to have an akhaNDAkAra-vRtti [niShprakAra-vRtti]associated with an object in the physical world, say a ghaTa or a paTa like object?OR is it that an akhaNDAkAra-vRtti [niShprakAra-vRtti]is by definition always associated with only brahma-vastu?

For Keshav,
I've to say that I've read your posts and they are difficult to understand.
In clear words, they are not close to my understanding. However, the anvaya
of akhaNDa to AkAra and Akara to vRtti is correct, if I must make a remark.
If you read my post in original thread I've given definition of AkAra. That
may help you.
