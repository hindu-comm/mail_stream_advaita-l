Dear Sir,
This was my first question to you:

 I would be most grateful if you can give the specific reference within
advaita siddhi that defines akhandAkArA as such.


To which you replied:

​"See beginning of ​2nd parichchheda and search whole brahmAnandI wherever
he has mentioned about this term."

The second pariccheda has this definition of akhandArthatvam as
"aparyAyashabdAnaM padavRtti-smArita-atirikta-agochara-pramAjanakatvam"

When I asked for your explanation of how this "reconciles" with your
definition of akhandAkAra, you say that there is no need for
akhandArthatvam to be same as akhandAkAra. I never said or implied those
two terms to be the same - I requested for a reconciliation of
akhandArthatvam with akhandAkAra as per your definition.  Just like you
expect others to understand your statements properly before commenting on
them, I request you to do the same of others' statements.

Btw, *you* gave the reference to second parichcheda in advaita siddhi. If
that is not the correct reference for akhandAkAra, why did you give it in
the first place?

I agree with your conclusion though, we are at different levels - we should
leave this as is, we are not communicating clearly.

Regards,
Venkatraghavan
