 Sadaji,

 My shashtaanga PraNAms to
 you. Thank you for the beautiful 
 description(as always)of the akhandaakaara
 vRitti. Your method of 
 explanation and
 way of expression are incredible, and I read your works 
 on the forum http://forum.advaitaforum.com very very
 often! Your 
 write-ups are in-depth and a
 great aid to nidhidhyaasana.

 Hari Om,
 Anil

 Yes there is no phala vyaati since it is aporoxam but it is
 not for that reason it is called akhandam.

 akhadaakara vRitti only because the apparent but apparently
 real khandana of jiiva-jagat-Iswara bhinaatvam is removed
 and ekatvam which is akhandam is the jnaanam vRitti.
 jiiva-brahma ikya bodhaka jnaana vRitti in essence is
 akhandaakara vRitit jnaanam.
