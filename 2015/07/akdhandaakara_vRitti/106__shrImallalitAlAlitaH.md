​Wrong sentence written because of lack of understanding.
vRtti is GYAnam, it doesn't give rise to some other GYAnam.

Wrong sentence as previous one.
So, it should be 'how do you express ghaTa-viShayaka-akhaNDAkAra-vRtti'?
The best answer is, it can't be expressed.
But, if you need to understand anyhow then consider it as GYAna of ghaTa
without mentioning ghaTatvam as it's dharma.

​akhaNDAkAravRtti or niShprakAraka-vRtti is different from saprakAraka or
sakhaNDa one, otherwise why should we use different words for them.

​The difference will be in the way they reveal ghaTa. One will reveal only
ghaTa and other will reveal it with it's quality/ties.

thought he will correct this after learning!!​
