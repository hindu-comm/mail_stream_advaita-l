​I'm sorry to say that your this understanding is also not in line with
those who coined this word and defined it.
Obviously, I didn't define it like this.
If you think that svAmI told you, then I seriously doubt his understanding
of this term. He may be defining this technical term without reading
original texts which mention this term. He may be defining this
system-specific-term according to his present limited learning, similar to
what most were doing here.​
