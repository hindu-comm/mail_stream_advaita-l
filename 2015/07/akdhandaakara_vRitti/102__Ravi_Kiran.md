Here, the jnAna from the vAkyArtha of 'prakRShTaprakAshaH chandraH'  is of
single entity ...prakAsha

Could not follow the 'remnant traces of viShEShaNas' in this dRstAntha ?

if such is possible, this does not qualify for akhanDAkAra-vRtti

in that case, akhanDAkAra-vRtti is synonym for brahmAkAra-vRtti , and it
should be niShprakArika
