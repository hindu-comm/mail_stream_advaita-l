प्रणाम,

A good teacher understands the material and is able to convey that material in accordance with the level of the शिष्य।  I have not understood much from श्रीमल्ललितालालितः's writing and I have tried to re-read the three posts again and again.  It is too "jumpy" and relies on too much homework of go and study the books in original and then think about it and then you will understand.  The questions/comments posed by other members have made more sense than the answers given.

Perhaps I do not have the qualification yet.  As also is implied, I'm at KG level trying to understand PhD material.  But on the other hand, I read आचार्य श्रीसदानन्द's writing, or hear स्वामी परमार्थानन्द talks, I am able to follow much more.

I'm not sure if श्रीमल्ललितालालितः can consider writing a thorough article on this that brings together the concepts that we can digest, maybe not me, but others more qualified in this group.

My deepest apologies for the direct email, but this is how I feel after reading this thread for the past few days/week.

धन्यवाद,
Sanju
