The words are peculiar in the sense that they don't reveal anything apart
from which the vaktA wished to say.
If vaktA just tried to convey oneness of devadatta as one, then they don't
present any other quality of him.
Say, when I say that 'ghaTa is red', I just want to convey the idea of
redness of a specific pot. Whether the pot has parts, or not, or it is
hard, soft, etc. is not intended to be said. So, even if they are present
there, there could be no shAbdavRtti of that AkAra. So, just because vastu
is sakhaNDa, it doesn't make GYAna sakhaNDa. GYAna becomes sakhaNDa when it
reveals the vastu as sakhaNDa.

BTW, if there is no possible akhaNDAkAra-GYAnam in this world(apart from
brahmaGYAnam), then the objection of dvaitin-s would be there could be only
sakhaNDa-GYAna of brahman, as only such GYAna rises from shabda and hence
brahman is saguNa. I hope to avoid this only, we used the soyam, etc.

No. If you accept cause-effect relationship and have read my old posts,
as you claim, then you may have come across the cause mentioned to accept
niShprakAraka-GYAnam for ghaTa, etc. If not, then read again.

So then we can consider the following four distinct cases:

> (2) "akhanDAkAra-vRtti-janya-jnAna of the ghaTa" on the other hand.

Unless you learn to use words correctly, I'm talking of Sanskrit words,
I'm ignoring your post.

Expect my reply late, if you write now.
