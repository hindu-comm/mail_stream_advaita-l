Anandji and Shreman lalitaalaalitaH  - My shastanga PraNams.


I have discussion with Swami Paramaathaanandaji this morning. 

He mentioned, in essence, that jnaanavRit that eliminates the jiiva-jagath-Iswara bhinnatva ajnanam is akhandaaram vriti. Yes there is no phala vyaati since it is aporoxam but it is not for that reason it is called akhandam.

It is called akhadaakara vRitti only because the apparent but apparently real khandana of jiiva-jagat-Iswara bhinaatvam is removed and ekatvam which is akhandam is the jnaanam vRitti. jiiva-brahma ikya bodhaka jnaana vRitti in essence is akhandaakara vRitit jnaanam. 

My sincere apologies to you both and to others if my posts created any confusion. 

Learning never stops.

Hari Om!
Sadananda
