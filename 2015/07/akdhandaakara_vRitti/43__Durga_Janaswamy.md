Is it
jnaanavRit that eliminates the jiiva-jagath-Iswara bhinnatva ajnanam is akhandaaram vriti

or

jiiva-brahma ikya bodhaka jnaana vRitti is akhandaakara vRitit jnaanam

or

both are one and the same?



Thank you and regards

> It is called akhadaakara vRitti only because the apparent but apparently real khandana of jiiva-jagat-Iswara bhinaatvam is removed and ekatvam which is akhandam is the jnaanam vRitti. jiiva-brahma ikya bodhaka jnaana vRitti in essence is akhandaakara vRitit jnaanam.
