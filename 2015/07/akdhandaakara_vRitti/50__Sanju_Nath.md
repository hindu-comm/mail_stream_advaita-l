A humble suggestion, if श्रीमल्ललितालालितः considers it practical.   If he can write an article/series of article/blog post based upon his considerable understanding of this topic and term, it may be beneficial to many who have been following this discussion.

धन्यवाद,
Sanju

If the shavaNAdi sAdhana is required to acquire AV, then what is the difference between vedAnta vAkya janita paramArtha jnAna (samyak jnAna) and this AV??

I would expect only answers without expecting counter commanding questions like what is your understanding of this term, that term etc. :-)  Hope prabhuji-s in this group would help.
