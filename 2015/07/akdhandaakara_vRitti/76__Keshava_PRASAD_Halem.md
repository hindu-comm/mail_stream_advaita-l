namastE.praNaams My Dear श्रीमल्ललितालालितः
Thank you for your patience in responding in spite of the irritation caused thereby.
Now, therefore, allow me repeat in my own words, from what i have understood from your writings in this forum :[BTW i haven't yet studied advaitasiddhi / vEdAntaparibhASha - i may need much more time for that]
We are talking about vyavahAra - vRtti-janya-jnAna - in particular.Let us consider any object in the vyavahArika that is the usual perceptible world, say a simple ghaTa.A knowledge of the ghaTa arises from the ghaTAkAra-vRtti as usually understood.What will be that knowledge of the same ghaTa arising from an akhanDAkAra-vRtti associated with it?Will it be the same knowledge, or different?I guess that it will be different because of the fact that the ghaTAkAra-vRtti is different from the akhanDAkAra-vRtti associated with it.If different, how different will be those two from one another?"ghaTAkAra-vRtti-janya-jnAna of the ghaTa" -and- "akhanDAkAra-vRtti-janya-jnAna of the ghaTa". Keshava PRASAD HalemanemOkShakaamaarthadharmahjanmanaa jaayatE jantuḥ | samskaaraat hi bhavEt dvijaḥ || vEda-paaThaat bhavEt vipra | brahma jnaanaat hi braahmaNah ||

Is it possible for one to have an akhaNDAkAra-vRtti [niShprakAra-vRtti]associated with an object in the physical world, say a ghaTa or a paTa like object?OR is it that an akhaNDAkAra-vRtti [niShprakAra-vRtti]is by definition always associated with only brahma-vastu?

You know, anyone will hate to say same thing again and again. I'm telling this about second question. 

If you understand that I was refuting it's relation with brahma-vastu only, then it makes sense to deduce that I accept that this vRtti is possible for other objects. Otherwise, why should I insist to cover सोयम् and प्रकृष्टप्रकाशश्चन्द्रः etc.?
