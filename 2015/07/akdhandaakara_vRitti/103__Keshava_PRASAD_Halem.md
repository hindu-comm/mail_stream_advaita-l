namastE My Dear Ravi Kiran.
I am sorry, i get confused while reading your messages, may be because you resort to 'inline-editing' of the text on which you are commenting - which gives me a mistaken impression as to whether indeed i had written something like that at all !
Now, coming to a response to your query (if i understood it correctly) - it will be clear once we receive the responses from Sri LalitAlAlitaH to the questions that i have posed earlier, and sought clarification. After all, i am in a mode of operation wherein i am trying to understand whatever has been written by SriLalitAlAlitaHand most of my thinking process is therefore driven by those ideas/concepts. Because i myself have encountered many questions in that process, for which i need clear answers before i can proceed further, it will be presumptuous to unilaterally answer your questions at this stage.Of course, based on my own(IMHO)opinion shared earlier (before i decided to put on this new hat) i may be able to give you some answer, but i would rather desist from it to avoid mix up of my roles (changing hats)! Hope, you will bear with me.
Thanks a lot.

Anyone can have akhanDAkAra-vRtti to the extent that anyone can have brahmAkAra-akhanDa-vRtti janya brahmajnAna,



no more no less. And when one does have akhanDAkAra-vRtti [niShprakAra-vRtti] the vRtti-janya-jnAna is sarvAtmabhAva jnAna.

This is not true, if you look at the example quoted bySrIlalitAlAlitaH
When one replies to
question 'which is moon' as 'prakRShTaprakAshaH chandraH', the sentence
generates akhaNDAkAravRtti; because the question was not about quality.
here, theakhanDAkAra-vRtti [niShprakAra-vRtti] is not resulting in Brahma jnAna (sarvAtmabhAva).
The so calledakhanDAkAra-vRttiassociated with some examples/analogies likeसोयम् and प्रकृष्टप्रकाशश्चन्द्रः etc. cannot be truly said to be akhanDAkAra-vRtti because of some remnant traces of viShEShaNas therein, although they may serve as good pedagogical examples/analogies to facilitate the teaching/learning process.



Here, the jnAna from the vAkyArtha of 'prakRShTaprakAshaH chandraH' is of single entity ...prakAsha
Could not follow the 'remnant traces of viShEShaNas' in thisdRstAntha ?
if such is possible, this does not qualify forakhanDAkAra-vRtti
in that case,akhanDAkAra-vRtti is synonym forbrahmAkAra-vRtti, and it should beniShprakArika
