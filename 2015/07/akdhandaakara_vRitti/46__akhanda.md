Sadaji,

My shashtaanga PraNAms to you.  Thank you for the beautiful 
description(as always)of the akhandaakaara vRitti.  Your method of 
explanation and way of expression are incredible, and I read your works 
on the forum http://forum.advaitaforum.com very very often! Your 
write-ups are in-depth and a great aid to nidhidhyaasana.

Hari Om,
Anil
