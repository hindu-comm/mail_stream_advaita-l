It should, because it is accepted that any vishiShTa-GYAna expects it's
cause before it, which are niShprakAraka-GYAna-s of visheShya and
visheShana.​

Pure existence is imperceptible

​Wow!! If niShprakAraka-GYAna is not accepted by advaitin-s then why did
naiyAyika-s, dvaitin-s objected it and advaitin-s supported it?​

​I'm lost here. I don't understand what you are talking of. I need more
clear version to refute or support.
I'll again remind you that you have to talk on vyAvahArika-level and count
even brahmaGYAna as vyAvahArika.
