Why stop with your limited vision? Let us go to shrI-chitsukhAchAryaH, who
in his tattvapradIpikA said this :
संसर्गासङ्गिसम्यग्धीहेतुता या गिरामियम् ।
उक्ताखण्डार्थता यद्वा तत्प्रातिपदिकार्थता ॥
I've seen वेदान्तसारः , and I think sadAnanda only used this term, but has
not defined it. Correct? Check commentaries, definitely in Sanskrit and
those of credible authors, for the meaning.
