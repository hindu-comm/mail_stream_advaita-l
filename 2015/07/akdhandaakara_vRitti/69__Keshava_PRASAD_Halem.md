namastE.praNaams My Dear श्रीमल्ललितालालितः
Here is an earnest appeal to you, my dearश्रीमल्ललितालालितःfrom my side.You know it, and you know that you know it.Can you not be kind enough to share it in its full detail,with all members here,at least for the sake of those silent members & prospective members who would take it in the spirit of enhancing their knowledge - to add a little bit from your lot ?
OK, there is this term "akhaNDArthaka-vAkyam" and there is this other term "akhaNDAkAra-vRttiH".
So, then you can give the definition of both; explain the difference, and also explain what is applicable when and why so etc., with all the references/citations to original authentic texts/SAstras etc. If & when it so happens that some thing is just your opinion, you may as well make it clear [did AdiSankarabhagavadpAda also said 'mE-mata' somewhere] and of course you may still be kind enough to explain the reasoning & justification etc.
Once that is done, then if & when there is some scope for discussion etc., that is another issue.
[i for one have shared whatever is my little understanding; i do not claim that to be final; i am always open to the possibility of further refinements in my understanding; ever eager & willing to learn, i hope]

​That is definition of akhaNDArthaka-vAkyama. Why should definition of
akhaNDAkAra-vRttiH be same as that?
I ask people here not to expect any answer from me now on. I've now
understood that we are on different levels and talking different language.​
