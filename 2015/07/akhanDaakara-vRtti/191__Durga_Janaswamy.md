Hari Om,
Pranams.

Namaste श्रीमल्ललितालालितः

Thank you for appreciating the manner of raising my doubts.
As suggested by you, now I have started reviewing your email-postings since May-01, 2015 in the archives of 'advaita-vedanta.org mailing list' .
Your teaching style is different. It is stimulating, to say the least, to me and other members of advaita-l group. Few times, some frustration is getting spilled in to emails.

I have learned a lot in last few days. I will be communicating with you shortly with my doubts.

Thank you and regards
-- durga prasad
