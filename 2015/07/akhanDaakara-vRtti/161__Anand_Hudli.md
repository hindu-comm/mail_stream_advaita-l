that devadatta.  It can be instant process but the mind has to drop the two
contradictory attributes to arrive at oneness of this and that devadattas

of tat tvam asi - the previous notions inhibit seeing that equation. Soyam

I am not sure what exactly is being discussed, so I'll just say this. I
remember seeing comments to the effect that anything with attributes cannot
be the object of  "nirvikalpaka" or indeterminate perception. However, we
have the example of "this is that Devadatta". Both the Devadatta seen now
as "this" and the Devadatta seen earlier as "that" have attributes. They
are both men, with parts such as hands, feet, etc. What is going on here?
Although Devadatta is very much a perceivable person with attributes, the
crucial point here is that the perception "this is that Devadatta" does not
involve any of those attributes. It is exactly expressing an identity
between two objects, this Devadatta and that Devadatta, nothing less,
nothing more. So there is no "appeal" made to any attribute in the
knowledge "this is that Devadatta", although Devadatta does have
attributes. Obviously, the same Devadatta could be an object of determinate
perception, "Devadatta is stout", "Devadatta is short", etc.
