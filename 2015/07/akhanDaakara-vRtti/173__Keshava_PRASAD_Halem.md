namastE.praNaams.My Dear Friends:
Every member in this group who has carefully watched my writings/emails/posts/etc, ever since i joined this group, might have seen, and can easily testify to the simple & true fact that - i usually do not react to such words/sentences/etc that are out of the way, that are irrelevant to the topic at hand, that are used (whether deliberately or otherwise) indiscreetly as a possible diversionary-distraction technique, etc.
Having said that, and in keeping up with the above stated 'principle' of mine, i hereby desist from reacting to whatever comments as made byश्रीमल्ललितालालितःthat everyone can read for oneself for whatever it is worth or otherwise.
praNaams.

Sure enough, i am not interested in any argument just for the sake of argument.

​You are talking as if arguments are without any aim or are themselves impotent.
That's not the case.
This is same as if one was engaged in argument whole life to prove his point, but when any argument comes from other side, he neglects them saying they are just words!!??
I've seen many people like that.
I think you wasted too much of my time.

Anyway, those who are of such exalted mental state, should not engage in arguments and definitely not question anything.​
