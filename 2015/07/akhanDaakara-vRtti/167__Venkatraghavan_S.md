Namaste Anand ji,
Thanks for clarifying. This is my understanding, I think its the same as
what you are saying:

1) "this devadatta" has attributes, "that devadatta" has attributes.
2) the underlying devadatta has attributes.
3) however, the sentence this is that devadatta, simply says this devadatta
= that devadatta. That statement doesn't tell us anything about the
attribute of the underlying devadatta, nor does it require the presence or
absence of attributes in the underlying devadatta. It simply says the
underlying object is one, without talking about the attribute of the
object. Therefore its an akhandArtha vAkyam.
4) the knowledge that this sentence "this is that devadatta" produces is
akhandArtha vritti.

Regards,
Venkatraghavan
