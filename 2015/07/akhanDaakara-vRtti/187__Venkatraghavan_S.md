Sri SadAji
PraNams.

I am not disputing the nature of the bhAga tyAga process, or that devadatta
has attributes or not. As stated previously, I do agree that devadatta has
attributes.

The meaning of the sentence is simply that there is an underlying
devadatta. Until we have performed bhAga tyAga we don't know what those
common attributes are, but the knowledge that there is a common devadatta
implied by the sentence is not the same as the knowledge of such a
devadatta's attributes. Knowledge and verification of that knowledge are
two different steps.


Regards,
Venkatraghavan
