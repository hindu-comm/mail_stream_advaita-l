You are talking as if arguments are without any aim or are themselves
impotent.
That's not the case.
This is same as if one was engaged in argument whole life to prove his
point, but when any argument comes from other side, he neglects them saying
they are just words!!??
I've seen many people like that.
I think you wasted too much of my time.

Anyway, those who are of such exalted mental state, should not engage in
arguments and definitely not question anything.
