namastE.praNaams.My Dear Friends:
Let me take some time to share my humble observations, after having been somewhat more active in interacting with this group during the last few days/weeks/etc.
One's words (whether uttered or lettered) are like one's signature, especially for a learned one.
I do not know, but the learned-seniors(jnaanavRddhaaH) in this group will be able to provide a myriad examples, anecdotes, etc, with references/citations to original texts in our SAstras, to justify this view.
Self-discipline in the use of words is the starting point in all aantarika-saadhana.All efforts in aadhyaatma-saadhana goes futile if-&-when one hasn't put due effort towards this basic self-discipline.
May God Bless Everyone.

Every member in this group who has carefully watched my writings/emails/posts/etc, ever since i joined this group, might have seen, and can easily testify to the simple & true fact that - i usually do not react to such words/sentences/etc that are out of the way, that are irrelevant to the topic at hand, that are used (whether deliberately or otherwise) indiscreetly as a possible diversionary-distraction technique, etc.
Having said that, and in keeping up with the above stated 'principle' of mine, i hereby desist from reacting to whatever comments as made byश्रीमल्ललितालालितःthat everyone can read for oneself for whatever it is worth or otherwise.
