Namaste,

/////

Shankara Bhasya and Madhusūdana Sarasvatī's  
commentary differ from each other on Bhagavad Gita

//

"Differ" is a objectionable word to use.  The very first sentence of gUDArthadIpikA says:

// bhagavatpAda bhASyArthaM AlOchyAtiprayatnataH prAyaH pratipadaM
kurvE gItAgUDArthadIpikAM //

After deeply and thoroughly studying the shankara bhASya, I am proceeding forth
to comment on the bhASya called gUDArtha-dIpikA.  The name itself suggests 
that it illumines the hidden secrets of shankara bhASya.  

So, it is very much in line with shankara sampradAya.  

regs,
sriram
