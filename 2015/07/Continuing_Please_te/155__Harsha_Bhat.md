Namaste....


           Whole advaitha sidhanta says Maya jagathaha...jagath is just
imagination of chit....as snake  is imagined on rope...

But the presence of word yadi..in the verse...

"vikalpo vinivarteta kalpitao yadi kenacit"

Says that this world is not imagined by somebody...Which is agaist to
advaitha sidhanta...Right??

regards,
Harsha Bhat
