Sri Mani Dravid Shastrigal -- Vedanta Paribhasha video classes in Hindi

Hari Om,
Pranams.

You can find the video classes in this link:

In the later classes, a gentleman was raising doubts in Hindi while Sri Mani Dravid Shastrigal was giving lectures.
And obviously that gentleman was present during video recording sessions.
If any of the our group members happen to be that gentleman or attend these video recording sessions, please contact me.
I would like to communicate with them.

Thank you and regards
