praNAms 
Hare Krishna

At the end of mahAnyAsa chanting we do sAshtAnga (urasA shirasA drushtyAmanasA vachasA tathA, padbhyAm karAbhyAM karNAbhyAM praNAmOshtAnga uchyate) namaskaarams by chanting mantra-s like hiraNyagarbhasamavartatAgre, brahmajagnAnaM, mahEdyau pruthivi etc.  (not stOtra-s) and at the end of each mantra we say umAmahEshvarAbhyAM namaH.  .  But we do only 8 namaskArams not 13.  

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar

Our new member Shri Peri Murthy sent along this query in relation to a question which was asked on the list back in 2006.  At that time there wasn't an answer either.  Is there anyone who can shed some light?

Dear Sir,

early this month, I had an opportunity to participate in Ati Rudra Maha Yajnam in BadriNath.
during the Aruna-prasna chanting, I observed the same & have same question as below.

when googled, bumped into your thread from 2006.
did any one responded to your question ? will you please let me know the
13 namaskara strotras ?
                 Sub: stotra ending in UmA MaheshwarAya Namah
