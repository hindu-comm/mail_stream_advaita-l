The three Acharyas Sankara, Ramanuja and Madhva have rejected
Bauddhas. Kindly see the Sutra Bhashya for 2-2-32. Adi Sankara has
said

किं बहुना ? सर्वप्रकारेण — यथा यथायं वैनाशिकसमय उपपत्तिमत्त्वाय
परीक्ष्यते तथा तथा — सिकताकूपवद्विदीर्यत एव ; न काञ्चिदप्यत्रोपपत्तिं
पश्यामः ; अतश्चानुपपन्नो वैनाशिकतन्त्रव्यवहारः । अपि च
बाह्यार्थविज्ञानशून्यवादत्रयमितरेतरविरुद्धमुपदिशता सुगतेन
स्पष्टीकृतमात्मनोऽसम्बद्धप्रलापित्वम्, प्रद्वेषो वा प्रजासु —
विरुद्धार्थप्रतिपत्त्या विमुह्येयुरिमाः प्रजा इति ।
सर्वथाप्यनादरणीयोऽयं सुगतसमयः श्रेयस्कामैरित्यभिप्रायः ॥ ३२ ॥
Gambhirananda Translation -
Moreover Buddha exposed his own incoherence in talk when he instructed
the three mutually contradictory theories of the existence of external
objects, existence of consciousness and absolute nihilism or he showed
his malevolence towards all creatures, acting under the delusion that
these creatures would get confused by imbibing contradictory views.
The idea is that the Buddhist view should be abjured in every way by
all who desire the highest good.

Similarly Ramanuja has rejected the Bauddhas 2nd Adhyaya and 2nd Pada
and written conclusion in 2-2-31 like this -  'निरस्ताः सौगताः' the
Bauddhas are rejected. How can he give respect to Buddha? Not
possible. The Vaishnavas belief is Buddha Avatara was to mislead
Daityas and bad people. His teachings must not be followed by good
people. Show me one Vaishnava doing Pooja to Buddha.
