Namaste,

Acharya Sankara started the dasanami-sampradAya (tradition of 10 names)
for sanyasis. Prior to AchArya, there were no yOga-paTTAs (sanyAsa-nAma).

Sankara Bhagavatpada was the only acharya who streamlined the path of sanyAsa
and hence one of His 108 names is "parivrAjAshramOddhatrE namaH".

Since then, all the acharyas followed His footsteps that has become the tradition.

regs,
sriram
