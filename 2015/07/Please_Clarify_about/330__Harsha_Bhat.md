Sir,
                                 Just for the sake of interest I have asked.
when we see odd out of even,We will have tendency to know why it is so,No?

Like that ,I observed this oddness...(I won't say it as wrong)  with
shankaracharya...that is I asked this question...

I have heard shankarcharya said that all his advaitha follower sanyasis
should have their name end with (Ten endings)..i:e
tittha,bharathi,vana,ashrama,aranya etc...

But shankaracharya's name, even his guru govinda bhagavathpadacharya and
gouda padacharya's name won't end with these title....

That is why I got curiosity ..about this...
