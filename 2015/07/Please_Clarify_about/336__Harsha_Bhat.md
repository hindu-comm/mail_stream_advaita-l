Sir,
                         I don't know much,but I think bhagavat pujya
pAdAcharya , is not the sanyasa name of adi shankaracharya ,but It is a way
of respecting him....

Because even madhvacharya  is called as srimad ananda thirtha bhagavath
padacharya,in many of his work...

It doesn't mean that his sanyasa name is bagavath
padacharya...madhvacharya's sanyasa name was poorna pragna.....
