Namaskara,
                                       All sanyasis in general will have
different Purvashrama name and Sanyasashrama  Name.But Coming to
shankaracharya,His purvashrama name is same as sanyasashrama name that is
shankra.

And also his name will not end with Bharathi or thirtha,vana,aranya  etc
....that all advaitha sanyasis name end with these titles ..

Why is so?

Can any learned scholars put light on this part please???

Regards,
Harsha Bhat
