Chandramouli ji - PraNAms - you may be right. I am just pointing out the
facts reationally as we know. shaastra-yuki and anubhava should be the
basis for analysis and anubhava evolves as we have universal observations
that need to be accounted. What I mentioned (not the attributive knowledge)
was somewhat discussed in Vichara Sagara of Nischaladaasa which we are
studying under Swami Paramarthanandaji - and the current topic is pramaaNa
analysis.

 Sri
 Sadananda Ji,
 Basically the
 discussion so far pertained to what is presented in Vedanta
 Paribhasha and Advaita Sidhi. Very different from what you
 have considered here. I may be wrong.
 Pranams and Regards
 Chandramouli

 Just for some thought,  but not to confuse.



 There are several aspects involved - pramaa vs bhramaa,
 smRiti and perception, and whether smRiti comes under
 separate pramaana. Anandaji also brought in - the internal
 perceptions - such as emotions- anger, happiness, or certain
 moods of the mind.



 Looking from a rational point - The perception for the first
 time (I think V. Advaita - classifies as indeterminate - not
 sure about tarkikaas) there is no role  of smRiti. and no
 jaati also here. When a child sees a cow for the first time,
 a white cow, and mother says - my dear this is a cow- now
 the cognition of cow and knowledge of the cognition as cow,
 as supported by aapta vaakya follows - otherwise just
 cognition of an object without a name.  Here pramaa and
 pramaata are involved at antaHkarana level. From my point,
 all cognitions are attributive in the sense that senses can
 only gather (reflective) attributes of the object perceived
 since original attributes are inseparable from their locus -
 and vishaya - the cow remains fortunately outside!



 The first cognition forms a memory sometimes being referred
 to as samskaara or vaasaana, hence part of kaaraNa shareera
 - this may be called as avidyaa vRitti.



 When the child sees another cow which is black, and the
 mother says this is also cow, - cognition, recognition as
 well as instincts of jaati are coming into play.



 Hence even in perception for the second time on - smRiti is
 coming into picture in recognition part. Hence perception
 involves both cognition and recognition to some extent or
 memory is playing a role in the knowledge. Hence avidhyaa
 vRitti or vaasana samskaara coming in the recognition
 process and not a cognitive level.Hence we have both
 antaHkarana vRitti and avidyaa vRitti due to vaasanaas or
 samskaara or memory.



 In the sRiti alone without cognition - as someone
 remembering a cow - then there is no cognition but only
 internal perception - if we call this as perception.



 Bhranti comes when the cognition is incomplete (since
 cognition is mostly attributive and attributives are
 incomplete due to absence of required secondary conditions
 such as light etc) and smRitti say snake while seeing a
 rope.



 smRiti is some have classified as antaHkarana vRitti while
 some others as avidya or kaarNa shareera vRitit.



 With jaati only the general attribute say cowness of the cow
 comes into picture - this happens only after second perhaps
 reinforced cognition-recognition cycle.



 Hari Om!

  Dear  Sri Anand Ji,



  Is not sopadika bhranti (

  सोपाधिक भ्रान्ति )
 considered

  avidya vritti ,

  even though it can be

  classified as objective knowledge ? Please clarify.
