 From : H.N.Sreenivasa Murthy Pranams to all.
Here is an anecdote :
 Once in the forest the Buddha was asked by one of his disciplestoexplain the workings of karma. The Buddha took in his hand asnatch of leaves and said to the disciple: ‘What is greater, the number ofleaves in my hand or those on the floor of the forest in whichwe sit?’The disciple replied the leaves on the floor of the forest.The Buddha then said, “In the same way, what I teach you is butthe small number of teachings necessary for you to be liberatedfromthe cycle of life and death.”The implication of this dialogue is that there are manyteachingsavailable but they are not necessary if we wish to be liberated.THE END
Mantras 2-1-3 &2-1-4, Mantra 2-4 of Kena Upanishad andcommentary of Sri Shankara on those mantras are enough to a sincere mumukshu who yearns for advaitasiddhi. In the most direct and simple way the Upanishadic sages have pointed out the goal and the path to reach that goal .The uniqueness lies in the fact that they have taughthow to have advaitasiddhi by using one's day to day experiences common to all human beings.It is a journey from nAnu (me) to tAnu (I / Atman / Brahman), that is all.
With respectful namaskarams,Sreenivasa Murthy.
