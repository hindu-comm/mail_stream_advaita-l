Dear Keshava Prasadji,
In addition to those two incomplete translations by Ganganath Jha, Karuna Bhattacharya etc, the following litearture on the Advaitasiddhi (You all must have known it from Potter's Encylopaedia on Bibliography) in English may be of help in understanding this abstruse text (Of course, it would be great service if someone comes forward in undertaking the project to translate at least the mulam. I've heard Professor N. Veezhinathan, Chennai was assigned this job by ICPR, but am not sure how far he has gone with that).
