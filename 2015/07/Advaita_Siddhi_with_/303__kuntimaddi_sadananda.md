Anand - PraNAms

I have all those books you mentioned. Shree Goda Vekateswarulu started teaching me some time back at my request since he normally teaches in Tamil which I do not understand  He had to stop for health reasons. 

Anand - since you have studied this, why don't you take up this project. It requires Navya Nyaaya brackground to unravel the vikalpa-s 
Giving a clear exposition will help many students of Vedanta. 

I know you can do it, only requires some commitment. However many will benefit from the work.

Hari Om!
Sadananda

 I just want to clarify
 that Mahamahopadhyaya Ganganath Jha's (incomplete)
 translation is of only the advaitasiddhi text
 (mUla), not the Guruchandrika.
