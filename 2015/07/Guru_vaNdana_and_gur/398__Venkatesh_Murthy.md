Namaste

In one Bhagavata story a King's son is dead and everybody is weeping.
The boy's Jeevatma comes out and questions them why they are crying
when the Jeeva has taken many many Janmas. In each life he had
different father and mother. This father and mother are only for this
life. Next Janma there may be different father and mother. Next life
there may be different wife and children also. We should not be too
much attached to family for this reason.

Some couples do some rituals to be husband and wife in next Janma
also. But I doubt this will definitely make them husband and wife next
Janma. The Purohita will get his fee definitely.

Kindly don't think this thought of mine has anything to do with Sri Sada prabhuji's close bond with his family members etc. I think this thought pattern would be entertained by all the sAdhaka-s who are sailing in two boats i.e. rAma & kAma.

> As a matter of fact like Sri sada prabhuji, for me also my family is quite attractive, my wife is beautiful and my kids are wonderful.   When my wife serving everything at my sitting place, when she sings Carnatic classical music melodiously, when she does not speak a single word to my relentless cacophonies at home, I often think I am really blessed to have a wife like her,  when my first son doing all the work of mine (like washing my car, arranging my clothes in cupboard, keeping my books in order etc.) and chanting veda mantra-s early in the morning after sAndhyAvandanaM , I think my son is the best son in the world, no one can match him.  So is my affection towards my second son when he is without prior asking ready with the pain gel in his hand to apply it to my aching ankle and knees as soon as I returned from badminton court :) My mind often exclaims with unbound happiness, bhaaskara, dhanya, dhanya, you are really blessed to have caring wife and kids like this, you are the happiest man in the world.  But at the same time my vedAntic mind, with equal force bangs me with series of questions, is this not the mAya in the form of beautiful wife and kids and their (socalled) unconditional affection towards me, is this not the trap that is enough for you to be there in the samsara chakra forever??  Is this not the samsara bandhana that you want to get rid of in pursuit of the ultimate??  How long this happiness would stay with you??   You idiot, greedy, selfish mind think about the impermanence of this saMsAra & don't think about the beauty of this samsara you will be trapped forever if you think your samsara is the only beautiful thing in this world.  Is this not a pessimistic view??  I know how to balance my sAdhana and samsara and I know how to detach myself from these bondages at any point of time, counters my materialistic mind shamelessly.  And finally my vedAnta read mind with a regret in its voice says : if this is your fate, what can I do, one fine day you will realize, what I am saying is not a pessimistic view but it is a realistic view point of vedAnta and after saying this verdict my vedAntic mind vanishes in thin air giving way to my materialistic mind to enjoy the 'SAMSAARA'.  My humble praNAms to that vidyAvidyA svarUpiNi mAya.
