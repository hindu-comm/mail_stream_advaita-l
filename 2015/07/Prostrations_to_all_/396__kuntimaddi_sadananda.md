Today is Guru-Pournima. My prostrations to all my teachers, starting from my mother and father.

I had many teachers who shaped my thinking. Taught me how to think not just what to think.

My spiritual teaching started with JK books and ended up with vedanta under guidance of Swami Chinmayanadaji. I learned a lot both inside and outside the class rooms under the tutelage of Gurudev. My prostrations to Him. Many teachers shaped by thinking - to name just a few - Swami Tejomayandaji, Swami Dayanandaji, Swami Paramarthanandaji, Swami Dheeranandaji, Swami Iswranandaji.. and the list goes on.

I have also learned a lot from my mother and from my darling wife, Mrinalini - how to be compassionate and how to be helpful to others even at the expense of your own health. They taught me that compassion is required to match the dry objective outlook. My wife has been a silent but encouraging partner in all the philanthropic activities we have been involved. I must say that many others via discussions on Advaita has shaped my thinking - some correcting my mistakes and some challenging my notions and some encouraging with kind words. My thanks to all of them and to Chinmaya Mission that shaped by thinking and Advaita Academy for providing a venue to express my understanding. Life has been an enchanting beauty; thanks to that vision provided by all my teachers. My Sashtanga PraNams to all on this auspicious day. 

Hari Om!
Sadananda
