Ananda ji 

You said:

-The knowledge that comes to your mind then is "this is that pot", i.e. what you see now is the same pot that you saw in your home. But the knowledge, "this is that pot" does not involve any attribute of the pot, such as color or even the special figure on it, although the recognition may have been based on attributes. It is a simple case of recognition, "this is that object", without focusing on any attribute of the object. -

I am confused by the following statements: 

Is recognition different from knowledge when you say - knowledge 'this is a that pot'  does  not involve any attribute of the pot. Obviously this is not any other pot but that pot implies recognition. Unless one is seeing for the first time, the cognition and recognition involves comparison to some extent current attributes with those of previous ones. 

Pot itself is akaara and recognition of an object as Pot itself involves attributive knowledge since it is not pot not a jug. This is that pot involves as you mentioned recognition and some common attribute of this pot and that pot. Without a basis of some common attributes one cannot say this is that pot - 

Epistemological -there is always knowledge of x or y, or objective knowledge, but pure unqualified knowledge is undefinable and that is Jnaana swaruupam or Braham. 

Hari Om!
Sadananda
