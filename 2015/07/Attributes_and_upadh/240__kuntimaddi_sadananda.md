 If the definition of the akhandArtha vAkya (samsarga anavagAhi - VedAnta
paribhAsha; samsarga asangi - tatvapradIpika) is that different parts of
the sentence refer to one and only object without any relational
connection, the implication is that the different parts of the sentence
cannot have qualifier/qualified, part/whole, cause/effect, including for
the purposes of our discussion - an attribute/locus relationship.

The above statement seems to refer to pramaa from Shabda pramaana and not pratyaksha pramaana- related to language in communication. Am I worng?
