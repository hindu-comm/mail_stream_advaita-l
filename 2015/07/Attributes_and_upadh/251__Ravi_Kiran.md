Regarding the example itself, is it not that, had  Vishnumitra had
perceived devadatta earlier (A - during childhood days when they used to
play :) and after many years ( grown up), seeing devadatta again (B) and
not knowing A = B, when yaGYadatta says -  this is that devadatta ,
all the discarding
happens as detailed above ?

My question specifically is - if  Vishnumitra is seeing devadatta for the
very first time in his life and
yaGYadatta says -  this is that devadatta, does the above discarding
happens, lakShaNA vRRitti of the type bhAga-tyAga, since there is no
context of 'that' as far as Vishnumitra is concerned ?

Thanks
