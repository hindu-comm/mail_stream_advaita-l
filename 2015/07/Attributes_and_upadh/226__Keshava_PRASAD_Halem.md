namastE.praNaams to all the learned-seniors.praNaams to my dear Sri Sadananda ji.
Thank you Sri Anil Gidwani for thinking of that question.

IMHO:
That is indeed an excellent question, which when clarified will help us towards a better understanding of the issues that we are grappling with - about akhanDAkAra-vRtti / niShprakAraka-vRtti.

Thank you Sri Sada ji for the excellent answer to the question - namely, that the upAdhi can be considered as the locus of the attributes.
Of course, it would be great if you or some learned-seniors in the group can help us with exact references/citations to original texts of the SAstras wherein we can find the authentic definition/explanation/etc.But in any case, your answer seems to be intellectually appealing/convincing.
Going further into the next stage we seek an answer to the following - [invyAvahArika] -
Q1: Can an upAdhi (say corresponding to an object ghaTa) exist independent of all the attributes ? If so, how do weThat is, if-&-when all the attributes of an upAdhi are discarded, does that upAdhi remain as anattributeless-upAdhi ? If so, how do we distinguish between one attributeless-ghaTa-upAdhi-G1 and another attributeless-ghaTa-upAdhi-G2 ?
Q2: if-&-whenan object ghaTa is stripped of its upAdhi, does that object lose all its attributes as well, having lost their locus, and still remain as an upAdhi-rahita-object which is therefore devoid of all its attributes ? OR is it true that the object having lost its upAdhi, cannot exist any more ?
Thank you once again.

 Anilji - PraNAms

Uapaadhi is the locus for attributes. Devadatta's case the individual with his BMI is the upaadhi. Attributes are perceptible and deductible. Perceptible are his height, color etc that one can see or hear etc. The deductible are how intelligent he is or how kind and lovable , he is etc.

Senses obviously grasp the perceptible ones. Mind can deduct based on what is perceived and his behavior under circumstances.
The perceived and deductible attributes along with image is stored in the memory for future recollection. 

In the case of this is that Devadatta, I see Devadatta with current perceptible attributes and when the teacher says that Devadatta, the memory of that Devadatta seen in different place and time is recollected. Since the equation demands the contradictory attributes to be dropped and only equate the essence and knowledge can be immediate if the recollection is fast! 

Hari Om!

 Can anyone explain the difference
 between attributes and upaadhis? In 
 the mahaavaakyas, are the attributes to be negated through 
 jahaajahallakshaNa, or the upaadhis?

 Thanks,
 Anil Gidwani
