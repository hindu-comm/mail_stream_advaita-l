Ravi Kiran:

 Regarding the example
 itself, is it not that, had Vishnumitra had
 perceived devadatta earlier (A - during
 childhood days when they used to
 play :) and
 after many years ( grown up), seeing devadatta again (B)
 and
 not knowing A = B, when yaGYadatta says
 - this is that devadatta ,
 all the
 discarding
 happens as detailed above ?

 My question specifically is -
 if Vishnumitra is seeing devadatta for the
 very first time in his life and
 yaGYadatta says - this is that devadatta,
 does the above discarding
 happens, lakShaNA
 vRRitti of the type bhAga-tyAga, since there is no
 context of 'that' as far as Vishnumitra
 is concerned ?
 --------------------------------
 Ravi Kiranji - PraNAms.

The point Pranipataji was making is the equation involves  one Devadatta  from memory and one from direct perception. Memory need not be based on previous perception - it can be based on shabda - or hear say about Devadatta by his friend Yagnadatta. 

The contradictory attributes of this and that devadatta are there and bhaaga tyaaga is involved in unitary knowledge
. 
Hari Om!
