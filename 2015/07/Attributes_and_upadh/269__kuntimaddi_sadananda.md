Typo It should say 
Pot itself is akaara and recognition of an object as Pot itself involves attributive knowledge since it is a pot not a jug

 Ananda ji 

 You
 said:

 -The knowledge that
 comes to your mind then is "this is that pot",
 i.e. what you see now is the same pot that you saw in your
 home. But the knowledge, "this is that pot" does
 not involve any attribute of the pot, such as color or even
 the special figure on it, although the recognition may have
 been based on attributes. It is a simple case of
 recognition, "this is that object", without
 focusing on any attribute of the object. - 

 ---
 I am
 confused by the following statements: 

 Is recognition different from knowledge when
 you say - knowledge 'this is a that pot' does
 not involve any attribute of the pot. Obviously this is not
 any other pot but that pot implies recognition. Unless one
 is seeing for the first time, the cognition and recognition
 involves comparison to some extent current attributes with
 those of previous ones. 

 Pot itself is akaara and recognition of an
 object as Pot itself involves attributive knowledge since it
 is not pot not a jug. This is that pot involves as you
 mentioned recognition and some common attribute of this pot
 and that pot. Without a basis of some common attributes one
 cannot say this is that pot - 

 Epistemological -there is always knowledge of x
 or y, or objective knowledge, but pure unqualified knowledge
 is undefinable and that is Jnaana swaruupam or Braham. 

 Hari Om!
 Sadananda
