Pl clarify ....did not quite understand this example above..

1) Vishnumitra is seeing the new person ( devadatta) for the first time  (
as told, asked yaGYadatta who the new person is)

2) yaGYadatta replied - this is that devadatta.  ( here yaGYadatta
recognizes devadatta - ok)

3) by the process of partially discarding contradicting features - since
Vishnumitra is seeing devadatta for the first time , how does this
discarding happen for  Vishnumitra ? ( since there is only a single
perception for the first time ? )

 Or is it the recognition that one was always that sat/Atman/brahman alone,
even when one had identified oneself as jIva prior to mahavakya-janya-jnAna
?
