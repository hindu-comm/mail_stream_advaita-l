>So how will he be able to figure out what attributes to discard and what to keep using the process of bhAga-tyAga-lakShaNa ?

Hari Om Shri Kesava Prasadji, Pranaams!

bhAga-tyAga or jahal-ajahal lakShaNa is further refinement of jahal-lakShaNa.

That which contradict another pramANa/anubhava is discarded.

In jahal lakShaNa the omission is total/complete whereas in bhAga-tyAga abandonment is partial. 

If one understands jahal-lakShaNa, bhAga-tyAga will not be intriguing.
