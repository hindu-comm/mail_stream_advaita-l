namastE.My Dear Sri R. Krishnamoorthy ji:
Thanks.Sri Sada ji mentioned (if i have understood him correctly) that upAdhi is the locus of attributes, but then that they are inseparable. Anyway, irrespective of whatever fine distinctions in the technical terms associated with the issue at hand, the questions that i posed earlier still require to be addressed.
