PraNAms SadAji,

This is still a perception because it satisfies the condition that the
pramANa chaitanyam (the chaitanyam enclosing the thought "this is that
devadatta") is unified with the prameya chaitanyam (the object (devadatta)
enclosed) at the point of knowledge generation.

Regards,
Venkatraghavan
