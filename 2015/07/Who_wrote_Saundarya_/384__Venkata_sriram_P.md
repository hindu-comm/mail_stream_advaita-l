Namaste Venkatesh Ji,

///
But why did he say he is Dravida Sisu a baby of the Dravida country
///

Where did Sankara Bhagavatpada say that He is draviDa-sishu? Read the
sloka again with proper care.  Here is the anyvaya:

dharaNidharakanyE ! tava hrudayataH sArasvataH payaHpArAvAraH
stanyaM parivahati iti manyE yat dayAvatyA tvayA dattaM (stanyaM)
AsvAdya draviDa shishuH prauDAnAM kavInAM kamanIyaH 
kavayitA ajani 

O Daughter of the King of Mountains ! Thy heart is filled with Milky Ocean 
which is of the form of Knowledge Divine.  Thy Heart, unable to withstand
the Divinity in itself, came forth and bulged out in the form breasts that 
are overflowing with milk which according to me is jnAna.  Why, because,
it has been heard that a certain draviDa shishu (tiru jnAnasambandar) 
having drank the milk, has became a great poet.  

regs,
sriram
