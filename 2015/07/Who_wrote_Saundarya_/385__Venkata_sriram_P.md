Even if you say he is describing his Mother how can a son 
describe body parts of his Mother

/////

Lack of knowledge of tantra shAstra would yield dangerous conclusions.

Sankara is sarvajnA who knows the intricacies of mantra shAstra and yOga shAstra.
He Himself encoded His name as the authorship of saundaryalahari in the 1st sloka
itself.  

Now, coming to the description of female anatomy, for a ordinary naive, uninitiated
in srividya, the anatomy seems physical. If we go deeper into the intricacies of
rahasyArtha, they stand for something else.  

Well, has not Sage Valmiki described the physical anatomy of Mother Sita in several
places of rAmAyaNa ? What do the madhvAs say? 

Thorough study of shAstra with the help of AchArya who is steeped in sadAchAra,
anuSTAna is required to unravel the mysteries. 

regs,
sriram
