If a son can look at his mother naked why did Sati Anasuya make the
Trimurtis Brahma, Vishnu and Mahesh into babies before giving them
breast milk? There may be some Sadhakas worshipping naked Goddess. But
they are not Sattvika worshippers. Adi Sankara taught only Sattvika
worship not the Vamachara Tantra.
