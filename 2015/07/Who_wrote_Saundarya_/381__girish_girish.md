It is very clear in last line of the 100th verse - twadIyabhirvAghbhi tavajanani vAcAm stutiriyam...
It was She who has come out of AchArya's work. 
What more authentication is required when the great paramAchArya himself does not dispute this....
No answers can satisfy non-believers and believers will have no questions... We need to believe the 'guru-vAk'.

Further, the entire SL is not just description of a woman.  She is mother of the Universe and parabramha mahiShi....  It is meaningless to even think that it is description of a woman...(shive sRungArArdrA itarajajane kutsanaparA.....) Unless one gets into thought as to why such a description is given, he cant understand the essence of it.  

As far as I am concerned, I have been greatly benefited by reciting the SL and can feel the presence of AchArya during the recital...

Further, even the lalithA sahasrAnAma also has the description of various parts of the Mother as seen by the vashinI and others .  So what is the problem.  Our medhAs cannot even think about this 'katichana chidAnanda laharim'........

 Pranams, 

 I think you have got it
 confused. The word 'Dravida Sishu' refers not to Adi
 Shankara but to the noted Saivite Saint of Tamil Nadu, Sri
 Thirujnana Sambandhar. Sri Adi Shankara must have been aware
 of Sri Jnana Sambandha being given breast milk by Mother
 Goddess Parvathi and so, he is referring to that incident.
 As regards your other observation of a bala brahmachari
 describing the parts of a female body, one way of explaining
 it is by saying that Adi Shankara was a Sarvajna and so he
 knew everything. If this explanation does not seem to be
 acceptable, then, it could be that the Mother Goddess
 herself inspired him with the required knowledge for the
 same. It is simply impossible to deny his authorship of the
 book, because Sri Chandrashekarendra Saraswathi Mahaswamigal
 of Kanchi has nicely commented on the book, saying that it
 is an authentic work of Sri Adi Shankara.
 Pranams once again, Ramesh Ramanan.
