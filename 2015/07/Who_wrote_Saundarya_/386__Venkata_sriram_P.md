Good post Dear Ryan ! I second your thoughts.  

Bhagavan Ramana composed "aksharamanamalai" that are His 
outpourings.  What a beauty in His composition and what a sweet
relationship between Bhagavan Ramana and Arunachala Shiva !

Both are ONE and IDENTICAL and yet BOTH PLAY HIDE AND SEEK.

That is the beauty of expression with jivanmuktas !

regs,
sriram
