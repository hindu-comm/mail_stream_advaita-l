It is a different issue what Adi Shankara suggested and what he did not.
But the fact is people have worshiped Mother in her Digambari form and they
love her as much as other 'sattvika worshipers'. Ramakrishna was not a
vamachari! In my personal view, Vama-marga itself has nothing wrong in it.
It is only the misuse that must be condemned. People are misusing even the
'sattvika' processes now a days.
