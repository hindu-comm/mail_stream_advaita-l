Namaste

In the TV programme Satya Darshana I heard Adi Sankara the author of
Prasthana Traya Bhashya and the best of the Yatis and a Baala Brahmachari
cannot be author of Saundarya Lahari. How can he describe every part of the
female body details for 50 Slokas ? Even if you say he is describing his
Mother how can a son describe body parts of his Mother? Someone may say Adi
Sankara was Siva Avatara only. Siva can describe His own wife Paarvati and
Her body because He is Her husband. But why did he say he is Dravida Sisu a
baby of the Dravida country and drinking Her breast milk Stanya in Sloka
75? How can he act as husband in one place and son in another place?

Someone must have written Saundarya Lahari and put his name as Dravida Sisu
Sankaracharya.

There are many Bhashyas for Saundary Lahari? What are Bhaashya Kaaras
saying? Kindly clarify. Some Dvaitis are taunting me. I have to give a
suitable reply.
