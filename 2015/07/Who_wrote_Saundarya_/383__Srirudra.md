DearSriVenkateh Murthy
With reference to the word Dravida Sisu some hold the view that it refers to Sri Thiru jnana Sambandhar.There is an episode that when as a child He was left on the banks of a tank while His father Shiva Padha Hrudhayar was taking bath,the child wept not seeing his father a while and Sri Parvathi took compassion and gave the child Her Milk and the child got pacified and from that day onwards began singing in praise of Lord Shiva and His consort.This episode is also used to fix the time of Sri Sankara .But some do not agree with this and hold the view that it -Dravida Sisu -refers to Sri Sankara Himself .R.Krishnamoorthy.
