The authorship of viveka chUdAmaNi, saudarya lahari and other minor prakaraNa grantha-s is always questionable outside the tradition.  However these works have been accepted as genuine works of shankara within the tradition and jagadguru-s like HH Sri Chandrashekhara bhArati and Sri Chandrashekharendra Saraswati of Sri Kanchi mutt have written commentaries on VC & SL respectively without doubting the authorship.  For that matter  they donâ€™t even talk about the controversies existing in this issue anywhere in their commentary.  However, Sri SSS, prof. SKR, arshavidya gurukula teachers etc.  enquire more deep into these issues submit their viewpoints why it cannot be the work of prasthAna traya bhAshyakAra. 
All that I want to say, authorship of these works is still an open issue outside the Amnaya tradition. 

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!

Subject: [Advaita-l] Who wrote Saundarya Lahari?

Namaste

In the TV programme Satya Darshana I heard Adi Sankara the author of Prasthana Traya Bhashya and the best of the Yatis and a Baala Brahmachari cannot be author of Saundarya Lahari. How can he describe every part of the female body details for 50 Slokas ? Even if you say he is describing his Mother how can a son describe body parts of his Mother? Someone may say Adi Sankara was Siva Avatara only. Siva can describe His own wife Paarvati and Her body because He is Her husband. But why did he say he is Dravida Sisu a baby of the Dravida country and drinking Her breast milk Stanya in Sloka 75? How can he act as husband in one place and son in another place?

Someone must have written Saundarya Lahari and put his name as Dravida Sisu Sankaracharya.

There are many Bhashyas for Saundary Lahari? What are Bhaashya Kaaras saying? Kindly clarify. Some Dvaitis are taunting me. I have to give a suitable reply.
