PraNAms

Anything other than Brahman is mithyaa. Chandogya upanishad describes sad vidya  Vedas also part of transactional reality since pure sat chit ananda alone is ekam eva adviteeyam - one without a second - no sajaati, vijaati swagata bhedas. 

Hari Om!
Sadananda

 Namaste,

        
        
     Weather in any
 upanishad or
 vedas ,they say vedas as "Aveda"?.
 What is the pramana to say that vedas are false in ultimate
 reality?

 For that one advaitha pandith gave me a vakhya "Vedaha
 Avedaha"...and he
 says that this vakhya is from veda only...which says vedas
 are false in
 ultimate reality.

 Weather this vakhya is really present in any veda
 (upanishad)?

 Can any learned scholar tell in which veda (Upanishad)..the
 vakhya "vedaha
 avedhaha"..is present...and also tell me the meaning of this
 verse ,if this
 vakhya really exists...


 regards,
 Harsha Bhat
