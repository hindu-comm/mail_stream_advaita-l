Namaste,

It is a good practice to start with "dakSiNAmurti stotra". 

In advaita sampradAya, this hymn has a very prominent place and daily chanting is recommended by traditional acharyas.  It was the favourite of Bhagavan Ramana also. Chanting with bhAva & artha 
is most important which leads the mind into meditative mood.   

Simultaneously, study of vivEkachuDAmaNi, vEdAntasAra and laghu vAsudEva mananam 
can be taken up.  

regs,
sriram
