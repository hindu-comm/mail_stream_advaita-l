Dear Ramesh,

Thanks for the nice reply. I agree with what you say but also feel like once vedanta is really grasped it’s good to keep a daily study of the scriptures for refreshment and inspiration. 

I’m going to have a look at the books of Ramana you mentioned.

Vivek

PS: still hoping for more replies in regard to study order :)

The upanishads also says that after having grasped the essentials one should throw away books like blades of grass or straw. Kunju Swami , a disciple of Sri Ramana wanted to learn Vedanta from someone outside the Ashram. He sought Sri Ramana's permission for the same. Sri Ramana said: "Today, Vedanta, then Nyaya, then Tarka and then something else. What books did I read? Read yourself. If you can abide in your natural state, everything will come of its own accord. You are the treasure-house of knowledge. There is no need to go out and seek knowledge from printed books. Just abiding in one's natural state without any interruption is sufficient and it is the most excellent task on hand. The time available is limited and one should not fritter/waste it in reading too many books, if your goal is self-realization.

To Teach him a lesson on the futility of excessive reading, Indra came in the shape of a crow or something and started lifting all the drops of water from the ocean to try it (It is impossible). When Bharadwaja saw this and remarked that the crow was being foolish, Indra came in his original form and told him that it was much better than reading too much of the Vedas. He also lifted some handfuls of a mountain and showed to Bharadwaja and told him that after living for 300 long years, Bharadwaja had managed to grasp only that much of the Vedas. Then, Bharadwaja realized that abidance in the natural state was the goal and nothing else should interfere with it. So, he gave up his addiction to book-reading. Sri Ramana says that a heavily read man becomes arrogant and is no better than a donkey carrying too much luggage. He also said that a heavily read man has too many families in his mind (in the form of books) and will mistake heavy reading as a substitute for genuine spiritual practice, whiich will be a total tragedy and waste of precious human birth, the sole purpose of which should be the attainment of and abidance in one's natural state WITHOUT any interruption whatsoever at the earliest.

It is for you to decide what you want to do with your life and I am nobody to advise you on that.

Almost all of these books are available freely online in Adobe Acrobat pdf format and you need not shell out excessive sums of money to grasp the spiritual truths.
