Dear Sri Subuji,
Pranams,

You are already that Brahman, therefore, there is no question of reaching Brahman. There is nothing but Brahman alone. We mistake the word to be real as it is and apart from Brahman and hence, our mistaken notions of being apart from Brahman and our need to reach and merge into Brahman. A devotee once asked Sri Ramana how can I reach, grow, expand and stabilize in Brahman (Something to this effect, not necessarily in the same words). Sri Ramana told him: "You are already that Brahman, there is no question of reaching, expanding or stabilizing. Brahman alone is real. You need to only get rid of your ignorance that you are different or separate from Brahman. Nothing else is required. 

Pranams, Ramesh Ramanan.

May we all reach that stage where everything dissolves into that Brahman !

Namaste

GauDapaada wrote Kaarikas on the Maa. Up. divided into four prakaraNas. This is the tradition in Advaita. Others take some or all of these Kaarikas as Upanishads.

Given below is the translation of Swami Lokeswarananda of the Kaarikas you quoted from Aagama-prakaraNa, under Mantra 7:

17. If the phenomenal world really existed, then, of course, it would have disappeared. But it does not exist. It is only an illusion. The fact of the matter is that Brahman alone is real.

18. If the manifold - such as teacher, disciple and teaching - has been conceived of only for some purpose, it will end when that purpose has been fulfilled. When, as a result of the teaching, Self-knowledge has been maintained, the manifold will cease to exist.

These are accurate vaakyaarthas. The key to understanding lies in the unsaid questions of the opponent: 

First he asks: "If you say that understanding the reality of Advaita is through the dissolution of the world, we have a problem. Either the world exists in reality or it does not. It cannot be the first because if it were so, then the Reality would be that the world exists. It cannot be the second because something needs to exist for it to dissolve."

The answer - at the level of vaacyaartha - is: "if the world were seen, that is if it really existed, it would have dissolved". By the force of "if" (यदि, yadi), the taatparya (purport) is: "but that is not true; in reality, the world does not exist". This begets a question: "then what is that we see around us?" The reply is: "Oh! that is an illusion. maayaamaatram idam dvaitam. In Reality, there is no second to Brahman. advaitam paramaarthataH "

This is further clarified in the poorvaardha of verse 18. "If for some reason [1], the vikalpaH - manifoldness - has been conceived, then that will dissolve"

I hope the meaning is clear.

Regards

N. Siva Senani

[1] Here "kenacit" has to be taken "kenacit kaaraNena", and not "kenacit purusheNa" or "kenacit aNgena" (like buddhi), because illlusion is due to avidyaa, not any particular person or an organ in him. Further the word "upadeSAt" in the uttaraardha of the Kaarikaa suggests that UpadeSa is the reason for splitting the One Brahman into teacher, student and subject.
