Very nice explanation, Sri Siva Senani ji. I shall render in Kannada just
the sense in which the 'if' is used, as explained by you, just to make it
even more closer to the member who I am sure knows the language:

ಒಂದು ವೇಳೆ ಪ್ರಪಞ್ಚ ಇರುವುದಾದರೆ, ಅದು (ಸರಿಯಾದ ಅರಿವಿನಿಂದ) ಹೋಗುವುದು.  ಆದರೆ,
ಪ್ರಪಞ್ಚ ಇಲ್ಲವೇ ಇಲ್ಲ ಮೂರೂ ಕಾಲಗಳಲ್ಲೂ. ಹಾಗಾದರೆ ’ಈ ಪ್ರಪಞ್ಚ ಆರೋಪಿತವಾದರು, ಅದು
ಜ್ಞಾನದಿಂದ ಹೋಗುವುದು’ ಎಂಬೀ ಮಾತು ಯಾಕೆ? ಈ ಪ್ರಶ್ನೆಗೆ ಉತ್ತರ : ಬರೀ ಉಪದೇಶಕ್ಕಾಗಿ ಆ
ಮಾತನ್ನು ಬಳಸಲಾಯಿತು ಅಷ್ಟೆ. ಆ ಉಪದೇಶದಿಂದ ತಿಳಿದು ಬರುವ ಸತ್ಯವೇನೆಂದರೆ: ಈ ಪ್ರಪಞ್ಚವು
ಮೂರೂ ಕಾಲಗಳಲ್ಲೂ ಇಲ್ಲ ಎಂಬುದೇ.  ಆ ಉಪದೇಶವಿಲ್ಲದಿದ್ದರೆ ಈ ಸತ್ಯ ತಿಳಿಯಲು ಸಾಧ್ಯವಿಲ್ಲ.
 ಆದ್ದರಿಂದ ಮಾತ್ರ ಆ ಮಾತು ಬೇಕಾಯಿತು.

ಈ ಕಾರಣದಿಂದಲೇ ಅದ್ವೈತದಲ್ಲಿ ಈ ಸತ್ಯವನ್ನು ಉಪದೇಶಿಸುವ ವೇದವೂ ಒಂದು ಹಂತದಲ್ಲಿ ಸತ್ಯವಲ್ಲ
ಎಂಬ ನಿಲುವು. ವೇದವಿಲ್ಲದಿದ್ದರೆ ಈ ಸತ್ಯ ತಿಳಿಯಲು ಸಾಧ್ಯವಿಲ್ಲ.
