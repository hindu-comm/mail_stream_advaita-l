Namaste,

There is an upanishad vAkya (sve.upa.) which says:

yasya dEvE parAbhaktiH yathA dEvE tathA gurau |
tasyaitE kathitA hyarthAH prakAshantE mahAtmanAH ||

Who has highest love for God and for the Guru as for God, to that mahAtma, 
the truths here taught shall shine in full. 

The shAstrAs reveal itself to those mahAtmAs who have equal devotion to 
Ishwara and guru.   

regs,
sriram
