SrI mAtre namaH ,

Namaste all,

In contrast with rUdraM of krishna yajurveda , shukla yajurveda have  rudrAshtadhyAyI .Literary rudrAshtadhyAyI means eight chapters dedicated to rUdra .Following post describes of rUdrAshtadhyAyI with audios ( mp3 format ) .
 I have posted maithila recitation style  which is closest to original recitation style of shukla yajurveda , except small peculiarity due to maithila language  and a pdf file of it in devnAgrI script.
