>From : H.N.Sreenivasa MurthyPranams to all.
"Answering he question" - One question arises, answer is being given. Then another question arises, answer is given. This is an endless activity. This is the way dialogues are taking place. Is it possible to end this chain of question-answer?

The answer is YES. Upanishads give the answer.If a mumukshu cognizes, becomes aware of that kUTasthacaitanya which is anudita andanastamita, which exists prior to the appearance of the question-answer an end will come to the desire ofquestioning / doubtingitself. That is, there will be ending of jnAtRutva itself.
Mantra 2-4 of Kena Upanishad declares thatone who knows theknower of the mental pratyayas within himself by himself will attain immortality.
Please try this experiment.
