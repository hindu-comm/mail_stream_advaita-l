Hari Om,
Namaste.

Thank you, it is clear. 

I have few more doubts.

You wrote "Where the mind is the object itself". Here object =विषय (viShaya)
Is it correct?
1.
कामः सङ्कल्पो विचिकित्सा श्रद्धाश्रद्धा धृतिरधृतिर्ह्रीर्धीर्भीरित्येतत्सर्वं मन एव  (बृहदारण्यकोपनिषद्1.5.3)
kAmaH sa~Nkalpo vichikitsA shraddhAshraddhA dhR^itiradhR^itirhrIrdhIrbhIrityetatsarvaM mana eva  (bR^ihadAraNyakopaniShad1.5.3)

These are attributes of mind.  Bhagawan Sankaracharya saysdhIH (धीः)  as praj~nA (प्रज्ञा) in thebhAShya.
Please elaborate the word: dhIH.
2.
In घट इच्छा 
इच्छा का विषय  :  घटाकारवृत्ति  is  अन्तःकरण वृत्ति
इच्छा का ज्ञान  :  इच्छाकारवृत्ति  is  अविद्यावृत्ति
Is it correct? 
In ghaTa ichChA 
ichChA  viShaya : ghaTAkAra vR^itti is antaHkaraNa vR^itti
ichChA j~nAna :  ichChAkAra  vR^itti is avidyA vR^itti
Is it correct? 

3
In घटधीः
धीःका विषय  : घटाकारवृत्ति  is  अन्तःकरण वृत्ति
धीः का ज्ञान :   धीःआकारवृत्ति  is  अविद्यावृत्ति
Is it correct? 
In ghaTa dhIH
dhIH  viShaya  :  ghaTAkAra vR^itti   is  antaHkaraNa vR^itti
dhIH  j~nAna :    dhIH AkAra vR^itti  is  avidyA vR^itti
Is it correct? 

4. Support 'I am thinking about solution for a math problem'.
Please tell me the above statement in the above model (viShaya and j~nAna) and associated antaHkaraNa  vR^itti and  avidyA  vR^itti.

Thank you and regards
