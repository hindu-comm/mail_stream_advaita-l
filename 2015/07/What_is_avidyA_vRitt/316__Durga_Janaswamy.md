Hari Om,
Pranams.

Thank you.
Few more doubts:

1. What is the reason for subjective knowledge being accepted only as avidyAvRtti but not antaHkaraNavRtti?

2. Is there any reason why both illusion and subjective knowledge are put in the same category: avidyAvRtti?

3. I understand dhIH,  the mental state is a vRtti, an antaHkaraNavRtti.
Now objective knowledge, such as that of a pot, is antaHkaraNavRtti. This antaHkaraNavRtti being a
mental state, is in turn an avidyAvRtti. In summary we have only avidyAvRtti?

3. You wrote
"objects such as a pot which are capable of direct vyavahAra but do form the content (viShaya) of a jnAna"
But there is a content such as object (eg. pot)?

4. Please suggest what tool shall I use to transliterate portions of your text into Devanagari.
I tried some but not successful.

Thank you and regards
-- durga prasad
