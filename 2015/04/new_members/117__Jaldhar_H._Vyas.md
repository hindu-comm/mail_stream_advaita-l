HariH OM!  I am a follower of smartha sampradaya and hence naturally the
Advaita sampradaya also.  I have firm conviction on the basic tenets of
Advaita Vedanta as enunciated by Bhagavadpada and all other great advaitins
following Sankara.  I am also a student of Vedanta studying Prakarana
Granthas to strengthen my knowledge of Advaita.  I would like to benefit
from the scholarly discussions in the list.  Kindly enrol me as a member of
the list.

my sole interest now is share to one and all the presence of ALMIGHTY
AUTHORITY here in this very world to re-establish THE ADI-SANATANA
DEVI-DEVATHA DHARMA, which is now called as HINDUISM. THANKS for this
opportunity.
