Sir,
1) even when upanishads say brahman as nirguna,vishistadvaita changes it to
no bad guna.....so ,when upanishad say NETI-NETI  as "NOT THIS NOT THIS"
....vishistadvaiti without any authorization change it to "NOT ONLY THIS
MUCH  NOT ONLY THIS MUCH"
2)similarly when upanishad say brahman as nishkala or without
parts....vishistadvaithi say brahman with parts like "Jada- chetana"
meaning living and non-living....


what you say for this?
