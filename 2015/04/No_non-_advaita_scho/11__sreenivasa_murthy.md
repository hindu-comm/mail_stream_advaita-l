 Respected Members,
 There will be an end to this debate if it can be established as a fact here and now the following : " Even now only Advaita is here and there is no non-advaita Viz., duality ". Is it possible to establish / showit as a fact in everyone's own life?
With humble namaskarams,Sreenivasa Murthy
