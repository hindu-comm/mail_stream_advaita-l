Namaskaar to all,

 As I have said jaldar vyas sir ,that I will not post such thing in
advaitha form...

Hearing my humble request he took me back to advaitha form....I am very
much thanks  for that...

Now I want to  reply to one of jaldhar sir's point ...that is
he says....

Advaita-l is also not a forum for politics.  There are plenty of other
places where you can complain about the Indian government.

For this my reply is.....

That day,I requested all brahmins to tell their cast as just brahmins,and
asked them to not tell their cast name,when census people come to their
home.Thus brahmins should show our unity to govenment.Here I am not
complaining about indian government.I am just telling how other are trying
to divide brahmins.

As a brahmin ,I have to tell all my  brahmin bandhus to notice this and
show their unity to government.Here I am not asking brahmin bandhus to
protest against this with government.Here I am just trying to
make awareness among brahmins.

I even heard that ,they have Plan  to give reservation to brahmins,based
 on brahmin subcast .....

Now tell me weather my that post is irrelevant to your advaitha form?...


You people talk about history,but not concerned about present day
situation.....

Karnataka Government already started the census,it will continue till 30th
of this month.....

So,this email is specially dedicated to all karnataka brahmin bandhus......

regards,
Srivathsa Rao I
