Sir,

   Actually kashmir shaivism is dynamic form of advaita,where as advaitha
is static.
I even heard that doing all the yoga steps of kashmir shaivism is very
difficult as it is influenced by kaula practice.
But I liked the matured thinking of kashmir shaivites .
    Great regards to abhinava gupta one who is gems among kashmir
shaivites.
