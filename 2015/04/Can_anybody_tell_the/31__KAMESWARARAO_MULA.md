Dear members, Kashmir shaivism is not the dynamic form of advaita at all. It is based on Pratyabhijna hridya, i mean reaching the conciouness by the methods not this , not this and leading absolute conciouness, reaching immortality by worshiping lord shiva. Where as advaita is non-duality based on shankara's siddanta's and works, Both are entirely different but reaching the ultimate goal reality, truth, oneness with prakarati.regardsKameswara

 Sir,

 Actually kashmir shaivism is dynamic form of advaita,where as advaitha
is static.
I even heard that doing all the yoga steps of kashmir shaivism is very
difficult as it is influenced by kaula practice.
But I liked the matured thinking of kashmir shaivites .
  Great regards to abhinava gupta one who is gems among kashmir
shaivites.
