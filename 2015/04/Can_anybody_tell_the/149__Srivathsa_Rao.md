Namaskaaram,

                             I herd that north indian amnaya peetham,don't
have CONTINUES lineage of guruparampara as that of sringeri sharada peetham.

What is the reason for that?

And also I even heard that jothir math of badrinath,uttarakand....din't
have peethadipathi for over centuries.....

Is it because of muslim attack???


Can any leaned scholars tell the reason for this??


reagards,
Srivathsa Rao I
