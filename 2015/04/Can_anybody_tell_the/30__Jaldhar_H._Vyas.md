Nonsense. Kashmir shaivism has only superficial resemblence to Advaita 
Vedanta just like Buddhism.

In this darshan, the one absolute known as Paramashiva has kriya shakti. 
If it were so He would be subject to change and decay.  How can that be 
confused with the one, unchanging Brahman of Advaita Vedanta?

Also see my post on pratyabhijna from Nov. 30 2014 in the archives.
