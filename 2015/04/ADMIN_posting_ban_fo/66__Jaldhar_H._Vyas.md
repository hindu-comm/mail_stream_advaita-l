Shrivatsa Rao is banned from posting to advaita-l until he can figure out 
how to stay on topic.

Advaita-l is not a forum for bashing other philosophies.  If you wish to 
correct other peoples misunderstanding of Advaita Vedanta then do so in a 
reasoned, systematic way with reference to primary sources.

Advaita-l is also not a forum for politics.  There are plenty of other 
places where you can omplain about the Indian government.
