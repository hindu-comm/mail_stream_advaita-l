Sri Bhaskar,

When we were doing the adhyayana of Achhidram, my guru Sri Ramaganesa
GhanapATigal referenced a portion of the Taittariya BrAhmaNa 3.7.3.2 which
refers to the Agni being in the right palm of a BrAhmaNa.  He too mentioned
in this context that Rig Vedis tend to offer sacrifices in the right palm
of Brahmins, but we didn't go into details of which sacrifices would
specifically qualify for this. But I believe the below addresses your first
question - does fire rest in the palm of only rig vedis? I think, no its
for all brAhmANa-s.

This is the relevant portion from Achhidram 3.7.3.2:

यद्यजाम् न विन्देत्।
ब्राह्मण्स्य दक्षिणे हस्ते होतव्यम्।
एष वा अग्निर्वैश्वानर:।
यद्ब्राह्मण:।
अग्नावेवास्याग्निहोत्रम् हुतम् भवति॥

The translation from PE Dumont (Proceedings, American Philosophical Society
(vol. 105, no. 1, 1961) -

"If the Adhvaryu (acting for the Sacrificer) should not find a she-goat, he
should offer the oblation on the right hand of a Brahmana. Verily this one,
the Brahmana, is Agni Vaishvanara. (Consequently, when the oblation is
offered on the right hand of a Brahmana), it is on the fire, indeed, (as it
is prescribed,) that his agnihotra (i.e the agnihotra of the Sacrificer) is
offered."

I hope other more knowledgeable members can answer your other questions.

Regards,
Venkatraghavan
