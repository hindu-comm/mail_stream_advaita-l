AshvalAyana gRhya sUtra, citing a brAhmaNa text, says in the context of
shrAddha:

GS_4.7/22: agni.mukhā.vai.devāḥ.pāṇi.mukhāḥ.pitara.iti.ha.br
<http://agni.xn--mukh-tsa.vai.xn--dev-3oa4148a.xn--pi-dla0901a.xn--mukh-tsa4785b.pitara.iti.ha.br>
āhmaṇam./

The mouth of gods is verily agni, (whereas) the mouth of pitRs is the
(right) palm (of a brAhmaNa). Thus says the brAhmaNa.
This is the basis for the pANi homa of the Rgvedins. This pANi homa is to
be done in the right palm of the pitRbrAhmaNa. Further, if more than one
brAhmaNa is invited to sit in the shrAddha as a pitR brAhmaNa (which is
rare these days) the pANi homa must be performed in the right palm of every
such pitRbrAhmaNa, not just one of them. For example, if there are three
pitRbrAhmaNas sitting as pitR, pitAmaha, and prapitAmaha, then pANi homa
must be done in the right palm of each of the those three brAhmaNas.

Regarding the question, why homa in agni is done for other karmas, such as
garbhAdhAna, puMsavana, sImantonnayana, jAtakarma, etc., these homas are
addressed to devatAs. For example, in the anvAdhAna for garbhAdhAna, it is
clearly stated, "pradhAnaM prajApatiM charuNA ekavAraM, viShNuM ShaDvAraM,
prajApatimekavAramAjyena,..."
