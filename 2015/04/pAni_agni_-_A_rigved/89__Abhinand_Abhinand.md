Namaste Bhaskar Prabhuji,
Your's is a valid question,which was bothering me too, Upon inquiry I learnt that the 8th Kandika of 4th Adhyaya of Ashwalayana Grihya Sutra permits panihoma during shraddha. (Too lengthy to type the whole set of shlokas). Kindly refer if you have the soft copy, else, I can explain that in person.
Thanks
Abhinand
