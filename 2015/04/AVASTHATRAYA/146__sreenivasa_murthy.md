 From : H.N.Sreenivasa MurthyPranams to all.Dear learned members,
 A friend of mine whois a serious student of Vedanta asked me the following questions:

[a-1] : The states of waking, dream and deepsleep, are these states thatare events that occur in time?

[a-2] Do these events occur in space ?

[a-3] Do these events occur in the same time/space series?[a-4] I appropriatethese events to myself. Then who is that 'I' that is common to all these states? [a-5] Is it possible to getanswers to these questions from LIFE only without referring to any scriptures ?

I request the members to throw light on these questions.
With warm and respectful regards,
 Sreenivasa Murthy.
With respectful regards,Sreenivasa Murthy
