Dear List Members,

Not being learned in any way on the subject, nor being a scholar, if I 
dare to send you a small contribution on the subject, the only reason is 
that since I was first exposed to Advaita Vedanta in 1961, at the rather 
early age of 14 years and a half, I decided to dedicate the rest of my 
life to avasthAtraya-vicAra, and to the daily reading and study of the 
GauDapAdIya kArikA.

Not being competent enough, I shall not try to answer in their sequence 
to all the points raised by shrii Sreenivasa Murthy.

In 1961, I bought the four volumes of “The Cultural Heritage of India” 
reprintedin 1953 and first published in 1937 by the Ramakrishna Mission 
Institute of culture Calcutta to commemorate the first centennial of the 
birth of Shri Ramakrishna.

In the third volume “PHILOSOPHIES”, I read with interest and article 
written by Shri K.A.Krishnaswamy Iyer philosophy of the advaita, page 
219, from which I quote the following hoping it may be of interest and 
hoping also you will not find it too long:

Besides, in speaking of sleep and dream our intellect, which can grasp 
things only as external objects, plays a trick with us which we never 
suspect. Though they are independent of waking, we yet reduce them to 
the terms of waking. When did he sleep? How long? —are questions which 
hide the contradictions they involve. They are not like the questions 
relating to waking acts as, When did he come? How long did he stay? In 
the latter case the acts are placed in the waking and quite correctly. 
But we extend the same form of expression to sleep and dream, though 
these are not waking acts and hence cannot be measured in term of waking 
duration. When [page 220] did he sleep? — is a plain contradiction for 
it would mean, At what point of waking time did he sleep? —implying 
thereby that sleeping is a waking act! Similarly, the states are not 
external things which we cognize by means of our intellect. They are 
known to us as immediacies by intuition. We intuit sleep and dream and 
what is more surprising, we intuit our waking also. For, consider the 
dilemma — Do we wake first and then perceive the world and then wake to 
it? The latter is self-contradictory, since perception presupposes 
waking. The former is equally untenable as the order in which the 
sequence takes place —waking, perceiving — requires the basis of time, 
and waking time would commence before waking! If it were otherwise, the 
estate would be continuous and their difference in character would be an 
inexplicable puzzle....

Even if the above does not correctly and completely answers to the 
questions a-1 to a-3, I hope they throw nevertheless some light on the 
subject.

Still those lines do not touch at all the question a-4. To try to help 
on the subject, I shall there quote from another English writing 
Vedantin of the XX^th century, rAjasEvAsAkta V. Subrahmanya Iyer, 
formerly Registrar of the University of Mysore and during many years 
lecturer of philosophy of His Highness the mahArAja of Mysore 
Krishnaraja Wadiyar Bahadur IV

the following paragraph is taken from the posthumous notes of Paul 
Brunton published in 1999 by Mr. Mark Scorelle, U.S.A.

§2197: Turiya is not the fourth state: Turiya is that in which all the 
others are merged; or it may be called the witness, which sees the other 
three states.which Ida

Thus to the question Then who is that 'I' that is common to all these 
states?  [a-5], the answer seems to be this “I” is TurIya also called 
the sAkShin in Vedanta.

Regards,

Guy Werlings

> To define space and time we need a reference state. Time is a gap between two sequential events by an observer (conscious entity) and space is gap between two simultaneous observations.  The waking state is most general state where will full work can go on and also where one not only exhausts his Vasanaans but can accumulate new ones and where one can gain the knowledge by developing appropriate viveka by sadhana. Hence waking state from the universal reference states.
>
> >From that reference, one goes to sleep in time and space (say in the house-bed room, or hotel room, etc) and also for a length of time - all related to the waking state.
>
> With the reference to dreamer the space-time coordinates and the measurements also shift. Dreamer will have his own coordinates that can differ from waker's point. Hence from waker's point the space-time coordinates do not match or nor one can make a relationship or transformation matrix for it.
>
> In deep sleep state - there is no space and time - experience. One transcends both but yet not recognized by the deep-sleeper since mind is also folded.
>
> Hence one cannot independently analyze since analysis involves a waker's reference other than any fragmentary remembrances of  dream experiences and restful-ness of the deep-sleep state. One can measure by electrodes the electrical signal that are relevant to the brain but that is only waker's reference.
