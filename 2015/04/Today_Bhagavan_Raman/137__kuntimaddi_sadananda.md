Chadramouliji - PraNAms

I have no disagreements with what you mentioned. There is no disrespect to any achaarya. My focus is only on the issues that are being discussed, irrespective of who send what. The ultimate truth has to be known by the individual mind by proper inquiry - tat vijnaasaswa. since the ignorance in the final analysis is centered on the jiiva who does not know that I am Brahman. Coming from Vishishtaadvaita background, I embarked on Advaita only after analysis. Bhagavan Ramanuja bhaashya also helped me to see the beauty of Advaita Vedanta. 

Therefore the bottom line is - it is the individual mind that has to contemplate and gain clear understanding - irrespective of what achaaryas have discussed. Acharyas have provided exhaustive bhaasyas for us to help us understand the Vedanta, and to contemplate on and to discover the truth. Shravanam and mananam and nidhidhyasanam has to be done by the individual mind. The burdon of proof rests on the individual using vedanta as pramanana and Bhashyas as aids.

There are no two opinions amongst us Astikas that what we accept should be shruti, yukti and anubhava based. However over the past several centuries it has been given to a handful of persons with extraordinary vision like the Great Acharyas Sri Bhagavatpada, Sri Ramanujacharya, Sri Madhvacharya etc to interpret and elaborate upon the shruti/yukti/anubhava aspects in a way which is understandable to us which would otherwise have been ununderstandable to practically the entire humanity. It is therefore futile to exhort any of us to not just accept the position taken by one or the other of such great Acharyas but reason it out on our own. At the stage practically all of us are , It is absolutely necessary that we accept one of them as our Guru and try and understand and follow His teachings. There is no point in trying to sit in judgement on all of them and try to understand in our own independent way. This is not to say we should forfeit our right to
 thinking. It is to say that we should utilize all our thinking capabilities in trying to understand their exposition.
