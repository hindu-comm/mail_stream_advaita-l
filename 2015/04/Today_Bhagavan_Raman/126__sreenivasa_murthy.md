Dear Sri Keshava Prasad,
 "So then, the locus of avidya as well as vidya is the antahkaraNa; the locus of the antahkaraNa is the jIva;the locus of the/a/any/all jIva is mUla-avidya;and finally, the locus of mUla-avidya is(must be) none other than thatultimate base, brahmavastu.
Hope that the above reasoning is equally acceptable to a seeker-jIvaas well as ajIvanmukta-jIva and all others in between.
praNaamsKeshava Prasad Halemane"
>From the above explanation, what fact emerges out? Everything is Brahman. By realizing one's true nature as Brahman there is an end to all these andeverything. Is it not better and fruitful to devote one's time and energy to know Brahman instead of explaining all the points enumerated in the above excerpt?
How to know Brahman? A study and cognition of what has been stated in Mantras 2-1-3& 2-1-4 of Kathopanishad and mantra 2-4 of Kenopanishad with sri Shankara's commentary within oneself by oneself will help one to go beyond all thesediscussions. 
 This is what my Revered Guru taught me : " one who realizes thathis true svarUpa is akSharawhich is prior to all akSharas (varNas) , concepts and beliefs is brahmajnani".
With warm and respectful regards,Sreenivasa Murthy
