This is a complex issue, something that cannot be analyzed in a
straightforward manner.

Please see the fifth adhyAya of ManusmRti verses 26-56 for a discussion on
meat eating. Also, see the following:

Remember that in such matters, shiShTAchAra (conduct of the virtuous) and
family tradition are also important. For instance, if one's family and
forefathers have been vegetarians, one should not start eating meat, citing
Vedic, smRti, and other sources. This would certainly be against dharma.

Also, standard works on dharma shAstras, such as the dharmasindhu and
nirNayasindhu, include a list of things that are not to be done in
Kaliyuga, although those things were permitted in other yugas. See:
