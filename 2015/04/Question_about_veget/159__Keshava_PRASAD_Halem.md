namastEpraNaams to all the learned-seniors (jnaana-vRddhaas):
On the question of meat-eating and animal sacrifice purportedly/allegedly sanctioned by the vEdaas,my humble questions are the following:(1) What are those places in the vEdaas if any wherein it advocates/sanctions meat-eating and/or animal-sacrifice-in-yajnaas?(2) In what contexts/scenarios each of such occurrences appear in the vEda-text?(3) Could there possibly be otherinterpretations, quite different from what may be conveyed through mere word-for-word meanings etc. ?
The same kind of questions as above may kindly be looked into the acceptance or otherwise of food items like onion/garlic/etc.Also, is it essential to simply go by'shishTaachaara' ('tradition'?) without checking on possiblesanction or otherwise from the vEdaas?
