I dont understand why eating meat or not eating  should be a serious topic in a forum advanced teachings of advaitha are discussed.  If one wants to eat go ahead, why you want sastra's support for your action. Veda in general talks about only Nithya  and Naimithika karmas as an injunction.  All other actions are left to individual discretion - but cautions that one will incur punyam or  papam for the action.  For spiritual progress, sathvik food is recommended and meat is definitely not satvik.  Refer to Ayurveda sastra for details about  satvic, rajasic and tamasic food.
