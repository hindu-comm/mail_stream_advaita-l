Namaskar,

Is the strict vegetarianism practiced by south Indian Brahmins a product of
jain dharma which was had a strong past presence in that region?

What is the proper way to view and explain vegetarianism and how it
pertains to dharma in spite of meat eating / animal sacrifice in sastras?

Also, is it permissible to consume onions and garlic? What is the
authoritative position on this?

Thank you,
