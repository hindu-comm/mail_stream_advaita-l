Is it not that the first thing to be cleared is whether the vEdaas/Sruti advocates/sanctions/tolerates/forbids meat-eating & animal-sacrifice, or whether it could be that such interpretations are indeed erroneous (whatever be the reasons thereof); right?
If in case the vEdaas indeed forbid meat-eating/animal-sacrifice, with all the due explanations therefor, etc (but has possibly been misquoted & misinterpreted to mean just the opposite) then the question of referring to the smRtis does not arise at all; right?
If on the other hand, the vEdaas indeed do not mention anything about meat-eating/animal-sacrifice (irrespective of whatever misinterpretations thereof) then there can be a question as to the possibility of referring to the smRtis and/or shiShTAchAra (conduct of the virtuous) etc may arise; right?
By the way, we need not falsely assume that the intention here is some how look for a possible license to do whatever one feels like doing; rather the intent can be a genuine concern to understand the true import of the vEdaas/Sruti, smRti, etc.; right?
>From what i understood, for example, the mere occurrence of words like gO-mEdha, aSva-mEdha, etc doesn't necessarily be referring to meat; even the word mAmsa need not refer to meat as such. In fact the word "mEdha" occurs in so many contexts; right?
