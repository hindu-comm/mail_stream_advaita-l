SAdara praNAm,
Much indebted for the prompt reply that you generally provide
Would like to know about a few rare titles.
It is a commentary"Thrikaanta saaraardha bodhini" on Sri Vidya Mantra by
Sri Veeraraghava Sastrikal, who was a disciple of
Sampoojay Sri Sachidananda Sivabhinava Nrisimha Bharathi Swamikal.
who initiated Sri Sastrikal and gave deeksha nama Sivananda Natha.
The commentary was first published by Sri Sastrikal in malayalam script
and later in Sanskrit script published in 1960 from Chennai and printed at
Srirama press.
I have got a malayalam translation of the same.
Sri Sastrikal also wrote a commentary on Varivasya rahasya,and a few other
titles like
Srisooktha Deepika,Sri Sivapanchakshari
kalpalathika,Gayathrithatwamala,Saareerika
chathusutrirahasyakhyadidivyaakhyaanam,Shodasee
Maanasapooja,Mahashodaseemaalika,
If any information is available on any of these please inform

With PraNAms,
