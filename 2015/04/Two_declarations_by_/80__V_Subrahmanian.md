Respected Sir,

I fully agree with you that we should not pollute the minds of jijnāsus.
It is with this precise objective that such posts are made here.  Not all
jijnāsus have the rare privilege of access to the pristine pure bhāṣyas of
the Achārya and others in the sampradāya. Many jijnāsus owing to several
reasons depend on material available on the internet.  It is very difficult
to know the genuine from the polluted material that is on the internet.
There are sites/blogs that distort the bhāṣyas of Shankaracharya and
present in such a way that an unwary reader is very likely drawn to it and
develop appreciation for those writings and obviously led astray.  It is in
order to prevent such a loss that there arises a need for posts that reveal
the true colors of such imposters and save the unwary jijnāsus.

Definitely no malice is meant by such posts to any party. Such an endeavor
will not be disapproved by Acharya Shankara who has always stressed the
need for the unpolluted teaching to be given out.

warm regards
