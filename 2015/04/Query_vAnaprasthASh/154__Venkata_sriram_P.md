Namaste,

Considering the present changed circumstances and our lifestyle, 
the post-retirement age from services (58+ / 60+) can be considered
as vAnaprastha.  

That aside, as there are no forests (thanks to deforestation), there 
is no option but to stay in house, practicing detachment from
worldly affairs.

Whatever, little forests and green pastures are available, are either being
snatched away by government or inhabited by naxalites now !!

regs,
sriram
