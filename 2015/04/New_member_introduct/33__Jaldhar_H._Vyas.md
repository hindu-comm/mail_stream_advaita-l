I am ramana maharshi follower

Hi, my name is Jozsef Palavics, I am Hungarian, living in North America in
the last 4 years. I was a Christian pastor, kicked off by my church. A few
month ago I realized the depth and clarity of the Vedic scriptures
concerning about our identity and everything. I started to meditate and eat
everything which non dual, Marashi, Maharaj, Maharishi Mahesh and others'
thoughts. I wanna have more experiment about the unmanifested. Thanks.
Jozsef
