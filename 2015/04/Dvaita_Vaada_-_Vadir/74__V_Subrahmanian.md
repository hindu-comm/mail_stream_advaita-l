It would also be pertinent to note two Vishnupurāṇa verses Shankara cites
in the Vishnu sahasranāma bhāṣya introduction:

*सकलमिदमहं च* *वासुदेवः*

     *परमपुमान्*परमेश्वरः स एकः ।

इति मतिरचला भवत्यनन्ते

     हृदयगते व्रज तान्विहाय दूरात् ॥ 3.7.32 ||

['All this including me is nothing but Vāsudeva, the supreme Person (uttama
puruṣaḥ), the supreme Ishwara, One alone.'  He who has fixed his mind thus
in the Infinite Brahman that is established in his heart ('yo veda nihitam
guhāyām parame vyoman' of the Taittiriya which teaches that the Supreme has
to be realized in the heart) -  will never be touched by death, samsāra).

Shankara cites another verse from the same Vishnupurāṇa in that
introduction, a little later:

*अहं हरिः सर्वमिदं जनार्द्दनो* नान्यत् ततः कारणकार्य्यजातम् ।
ईदृङूमनो यस्य न तस्य भूयो भवोद्भवा द्वन्द्वगदा भवन्ति ।। 1.22.86 ।।

('I am Hari, all this (universe) is Janārdana, there is none other than Him
as cause-effect combine.  He who has thus realized will never be caught in
samsāra.)


[But that is not all; for Madhvas the word 'aham' is not the one that is
commonly understood; it is 'aheyam' or it is 'aham tadadhīnaḥ' or some such
meaning and not identity as advaitins understand. ]

Here too one can note the Māṇḍūkya scheme of 'cause-effect dual’ which
consists of the manifest (kṣara) and the unmanifest (akṣara).  The BG 15th
chapter 'Purushottama' is also reflected here in the word 'parama pumān' in
the first cited verse.
