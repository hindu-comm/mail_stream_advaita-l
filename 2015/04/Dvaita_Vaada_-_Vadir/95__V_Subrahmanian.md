The abheda bodhaka shruti,if it is admitted that it teaches abheda, is
countered, contradicted, by the bheda bodhaka shruti.  Then, one might
question, why not the bheda bodhaka shruti be countered by the abheda
bodhaka shruti? To such a question the reply Sri Vadiraja gives is: the
shruti that you say is abheda bodhaka is not teaching abheda at all: on the
contrary it teaches bheda, (antaryāmi  -  niyamya - niyāmaka
relationship).  Hence the bheda bodhaka shruti, which has no contestant (in
the form of abheda bodhaka shruti) remains unchallenged:  भेदश्रुतिरबाधिता
। कथं न बाधते मन्द प्रतिद्वन्द्वविवर्जिता |

In the above position one can see a defect:  Bheda shruti can counter
abheda shruti ONLY if abheda shruti is admitted to teach abheda. But that
is not admitted by the bhedavādin.  He holds that shruti to be teaching
bheda alone. But he questions: How indeed can the bheda shruti, which
remains unchallenged by the abheda shruti, not be a counter to the aikyam
which is not taught by shruti at all? By saying so he admits that the
abheda shruti at least prima facie teaches abheda.

If the bheda shruti has to be challenge/counter-free, then there should be
no abheda shruti.  But if the bheda shruti, if it is a counter to the
abheda shruti, then abheda shruti is to be admitted.  Sri Vadirāja wants
the bheda shruti to be challenge-free and yet wants that shruti to
counter/challenge the abheda shruti (the aikyam it at least purports to
teach). This is the defect.

Also, he says by resorting to lakṣaṇa, the lakṣya should not be a
non-entity, naraśṛṅga, human-horn.  Fine. The advaitin also accepts this
rule.  For the advaitin, the lakṣya is Brahman, free of attributes.  The
lakṣaṇā he resorts to renders the lakṣya, the viśiṣṭa (viśeṣya) free of the
viśeṣaṇas.  For him Brahman is sarvajñatvādiviśiṣṭam; only that by the
lakṣaṇā (jahadajahallakṣaṇā), the viśeṣaṇas are given up, just like the
time, place etc. are given up and the person denoted by the time-place etc.
upādhis is alone grasped (in the so'yam devadattaḥ example).  Surely, the
devadatta is not a non-entity; only that he is grasped as someone free of
those viśeṣaṇas.  On divesting of the viśeṣaṇas the viśiṣṭa does not become
shūnya. Just like Sri Vādiraja takes a positive entity, antaryāmin, as
denoted by that sentence, the advaitin too takes a positive entity,
Brahman, free of adjuncts, as denoted by that sentence.  Hence the charge,
if any, that the lakṣaṇā results in a non-entity, does not hold water.  In
the antaryāmi brāhmaṇa Shankara says: That antaryāmi is Consciousness, by
being just present there as a Witness, it controls everything.  And that
Chaitanyam, the mantra teaches, is your self: (Bṛ.up.3.7.3)

// देवताकार्यकरणस्य *ईश्वरसाक्षिमात्रसान्निध्येन* हि नियमेन
प्रवृत्तिनिवृत्ती स्याताम् ; य ईदृगीश्वरो नारायणाख्यः, पृथिवीं
पृथिवीदेवताम्, यमयति नियमयति स्वव्यापारे, अन्तरः अभ्यन्तरस्तिष्ठन्,* एष त
आत्मा*, *ते तव, मम च सर्वभूतानां च* इत्युपलक्षणार्थमेतत्, अन्तर्यामी
यस्त्वया पृष्टः, अमृतः सर्वसंसारधर्मवर्जित इत्येतत् ॥//

This mantra is teaching the abheda between the antaryāmin and the ātmā of
the jīva.

The above lakṣaṇa is found in the Adhyātma Rāmāyaṇa, a text held to be a
part of the Brahmāṇḍa purāṇa.  This text is popular among north-Indian
vaiṣṇavas.  It has even been expounded by a Madhva scholar. Here are the
verses from the Adhyātma Rāmāyaṇa, uttara kāṇḍa, 5th sarga:

रामगीताश्लोकाः केचन -

श्रद्धान्वितस्तत्त्वमसीति वाक्यतो गुरोः प्रसादादपि शुद्धमानसः ।

*विज्ञाय चैकात्म्यमथात्मजीवयोः *सुखी भवेन्मेरुरिवाप्रकंपनः ॥ २४ ॥

प्रत्यक्परोक्षादिविरोधमात्मनोर्विहाय संगृह्य तयोश्चिदात्मताम् ।

संशोधितां लक्षणया च लक्षितां ज्ञाता स्वमात्मानमथाद्वयो भवेत् ॥ २६ ॥

एकात्मकत्वाज्जहती न संभवेत्तथा जहल्लक्षणता विरोधतः ।

*सोऽयंपदार्थाविव भागलक्षणा युज्येत तत्त्वंपदयोरदोषतः *॥ २७ ॥

*रसादिपंचीकृतभूतसंभवं* भोगालयं दुःखसुखादिकर्मणाम् ।

*शरीरमाद्यंतवदादिकर्मजं मायामयं स्थूल**मुपाधिमात्मनः* ॥ २८ ॥

सूक्ष्मं मनोबुद्धिदशेन्द्रिर्यैर्युतं प्राणैरपंचीकृतभूतसंभवम् ।

भोक्तुः सुखादेरनुसाधनं भवेच्छरीरमन्यद्विदुरात्मनो बुधः ॥ २९ ॥

*अनाद्यनिर्वाच्यमपीह कारणं मायाप्रधानं* तु परं शरीरकम् ।

*उपाधिभेदात्तु यतः पृथक्स्थितं स्वात्मानमात्मन्यवधारयेत् क्रमात् *॥ ३० ॥

कोशेषु पंचस्वपि तत्तदाकृतिर्विभाति संगात्स्फटिकोपलो यथा ।

असंगरूपोऽयमजो यतोऽद्वयो विज्ञायतेऽस्मिन्परितो विचारिते ॥ ३१ ॥

बुद्धेस्त्रिधा वृत्तिरपीह दृश्यते स्वप्नादिभेदेन गुणत्रयात्मनः ।

अन्योन्यतोऽस्मिन्व्यभिचारतो मृषा नित्ये परे ब्रह्मणि केवले शिवे ॥ ३२ ॥

देहिन्द्रियप्राणमनश्चिदात्मनां संघादजस्त्रं परिवर्तते धियः ।

*नेति प्रमाणेन निराकृतोखिलो ह्रदा समास्वादितचिद्धनामृतः । *

*त्यजेदशेषं जगदात्तसद्रसं पीत्वा यथाऽम्भः प्रजहाति तत्फलम् ॥* ३४ ॥
