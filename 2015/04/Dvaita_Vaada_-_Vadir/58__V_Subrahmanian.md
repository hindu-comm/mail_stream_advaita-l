Here is another product, from Sri Madhva, of not understanding Advaita's
stand, just as the one stated from Sri Vādirāja:


//That is  why Acharya Madhwa asked, OK, the fact that there are three
grades of truth is also a form of truth, is it not?  And, what kind of
truth is that? Which ever answer you choose, you will end up in an absurd
situation.//

Response:

It is evident that the one raising the objection has not studied properly
and understood what Advaita says on the topic.  This question is amply
answered by Shankara in the BSB 2.1.14.  Here is a post based on this topic:

http://www.advaita-vedanta.org/archives/advaita-l/2010-April/024262.html

In the BSB 2.1.14 Shankara has said:

The Veda (which teaches the three sattā-s and that Brahman alone is real,
jīva is non-different from Brahman, etc.) belongs to the vyāvahārika
sattā.  Yet the truth it teaches is never negated subsequently.  For
example the kathopanishad teaches that Nachiketas listened to the teaching
of Yama and realized the truth.  Now, even if the 'fact' of one teaching
another is annulled, that there is the annulment of avidya to the person
who knew the truth is not set aside by any subsequent fact.  We have not
heard anywhere that Nachiketas returned to samsara.

So, the question raised by Madhva is replied thus: The 'fact' that there
are three levels of reality is definitely vyavaharika satyam, that is,
mithyā.  Yet the fact of Brahman alone being the Pāramārthika satyam can
never be annulled by anyone.  At all times the prātibhāsika satyam (taking
the snake as real in a rope-snake illusion) is annulled in the vyavahara
itself by rope knowledge and the vyavaharika satyam itself getting annulled
by the knowledge of Brahman - can never be annulled by anyone.

Not realizing this simple fact Madhva has thought he is raising an
objection that will corner the advaitin.

The Shānkara bhashyam itself has replies for their questions.  It is
evident that they have neither studied nor understood the advaita darshana
correctly. That is the reason they raise such silly objections.
