Namaste Sri Subrahmanian

I thank you for the Shruti and Smruti references. Vaadiraaja's dilemma
is this. Advaitis are saying Brahman is not active a Nishkriya thing.
It has no powers also. That Brahman is in the body also. How can that
Brahman become Active and make body also active? The body cannot be
active itself because it is a Jada Vastu. If you say some other
Consciousness is making body active there will be Advaita Haani
because there will be two Conscious things. 1) Brahman 2) that other
Consciousness.

If you say there is Jeeva in the body making it active that Active
Jeeva cannot be the Inactive Brahman. You are agreeing Jeeva is not
Brahman against your own Jeeva = Brahman equation.

For this the answer is the Action and Body are Maayika. They are not
real. Svabhava or Prakruti is creating Activity. The Lord said
Svabhaavastu Pravartate. That Svabhaava - Prakruti is Maayaa only.
Brahman is Nishkriya.
