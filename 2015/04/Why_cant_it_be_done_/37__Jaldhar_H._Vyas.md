I will respond to the substantive parts of your postings later (or 
tomorrow; it's past my bedtime.) but just some administrative notes:

Stop flooding the list with so many messages.  Take the time to gather 
your thoughts.  Explain what you mean concisely and don't keep repeating 
yourself.

Do not rely on popular writings but quote primary sources wherever 
possible.

This is not the appropriate place to make complaints about what other 
people may or may not have done.


This will help make advaita-l more useful for everyone including yourself.
