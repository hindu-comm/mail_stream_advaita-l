Namaste

Someone told me that the verse was composed long ago by a Sannyāsin who
was  popularly known by the name 'bhāṣya swāmigaḷ'. He lived during the
times of Jagadguru Sri Chandrashekhara Bhārati Swaminaḥ of Sringeri.  If I
get more confirmed details I shall certainly let you know.

warm regards
