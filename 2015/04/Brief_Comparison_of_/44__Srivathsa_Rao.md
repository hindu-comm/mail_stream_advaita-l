See,
Making a asthika (one who believe in vedas) to follow dvaitha,advaitha or
vishistadvaitha is easy....
Because he believe in vedas,so...we can tell the meaing of vedas ,its
interpretation and make that  asthika to accept dvaita,vishistadvaita or
advaitha .

But making a nasthika (one who don't believe vedas) like jaina and bhudha
to accept asthika school like advaitha is very difficult.
Because he won't believe in vedas ,and its interpretation.....So, telling
him advaitha is correct through vedas,won't give any fruit...
because he won't accept that....he says vedas itself is wrong.

For that we have to convenes nasthikas through the fault in their
philosophy.The fault in their philosophy has to be shown through logic.
For that there should be sound knowledge of that nasthika school.for that
person who tries to convenes nasthika school scholar to asthika school like
advaitha.

This is what shankara did,in his early ages,itself.You may not know
shankara wrote vivekachudamani in age 12.Now that vivekachudamani is
learning  material for great great scholars.

Even krishna was not able to convenes duryodana and stop mahabharatha
war.But shankara convenes advaitha to both asthikas and nasthikas.So, adi
shankara is right to call jagath guru.

That is why we say adi shankara is adi shankara,No body can compete with
him.
