Shiva is worshipped at Madhva's sode mutt in udupi as part of one
particular tradition, it isn't fair to paint his philosophy with so broad a
brush.

Namaskar
Sir,
      I accept one should not accept his guru's teachings blindly.But here
the question comes how intellectually brilliant your teacher is to answer
your question.Coming to shankara,he could have taken sanyasa from a local
sanyasi in kaladi ,kerala.But he wanted to take sanyasa from Govidha
bhagavath pada,a well known brahma jgnani at that time.That is why he went
from kaladi to madhya pradesh by walking, to take sanyasa dheeksha.Just
like nowdays engineering students want to study from IIT ,not from local
engineering college.

But in case of madhva and ramanuja,their teacher are local teacher of their
area.Who may have less intellect to answer answer madhva's or ramanuja's
question,  that doesn't mean that philosophy is wrong.
