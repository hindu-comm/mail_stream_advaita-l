Dear Sri Srivathsa Rao,
 Of What earthly use are these kind of postings ? Are they not sowing the seeds of hatred in the hearts of the readers? Why don't youprovide some useful and beneficial study materials to readers which will uplift them spiritually? Do you think you have studied the works of these Acharyas in depth so that you can passjudgement onthem?
 Kindly never forget that all the Acharyas were great bhaktas and they havegiven solace to lakhs of humanbeings. You please show respect to these great Acharyas.
Kindly pardon me for having shared these thoughts.
With respectful pranamsSreenivasa Murthy

I even heard that madhvacharya says ,we have to worship god (Vishnu),only
though him (Madhvacharya) as mediator,otherwise...we won't get result of
worship just like "NEERALLI MADIDHA HOMA". He in his philosophy tries to
make people afraid of god,and tell them if you follow my path you will get
salvation other wise if you go for other's philosophy...you will go to
andha tamas (Eternal hell).....

He even says ONLY his bhashya of prastana traya is PERFECT.All other
acharya's bhashyas of prastana traya are tamasa (Wrong).

This type of mean mentality we can only seen in Christians and
Muslims,which are non-indian religion.Except in madhva philosophy,we can't
see such mean mentality in any other indian philosophy/philosopher.

This is the uniqueness of madhvacharya or uniqueness of madhva sidhanta.
