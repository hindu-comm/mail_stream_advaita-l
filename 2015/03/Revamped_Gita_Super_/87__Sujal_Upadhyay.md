Namaste,

Many of us must be using Gita Super Site beta (
202.3.77.102/acquia/?q=node/69 or 202.3.77.102/acquia/?q=node/20), but have
observed that it is down since some time.

The good news is - Old site is active

http://www.gitasupersite.iitk.ac.in/

Site is revamped with some changes in coding. IT uses latest technologies
and ... is working fine. You do not need to install fonts like in old site
layout. It now uses unicode fonts (same as in beta site)

You will have to select additional commentaries and translation from drop
down list with title ‘Show Select the Translation’s and Commentaries to be
Displayed’

If still, all commentaries are not displayed or are vanished. Simply click
the above button. The site retains the selected commentaries. All you need
to do is to scroll at the bottom of list and click the button 'Display
Selected Translation's'
OM

Sujal
