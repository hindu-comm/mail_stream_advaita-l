Namaste,
The Gurubala seems to be one of the most important astrological requirement for upanayana. Even the mantra for wearing the sacred thread has the name of Brihaspati appearing in it. It is believed that in the very ancient times the nakshatra in which certain rituals were performed, was considered very important and that King Janaka took particular care to choose the appropriate nakshatra for the marriage of Mother Seeta, to counter the ill effect of Shanigraha being in the eighth house. May be some scholars have the exact details of this.

Regards,Sunil KB

 OM
8 yrs is indicated for brahmOpadesam.
This has nothing to do with the prArabdA that decides the life span.

I have heard that when upanayana was performed when there was no Gurubala, untoward things such s death, etc have occurred to the boy or close family members. What have our Shankaracharyas or dharma shastras said in this matter ?
