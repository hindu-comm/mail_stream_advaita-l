Even though Brahmajñāna (svarūpajnāna) is svayamprakāśa, owing to adhyāsa
one is not able to recognize it.  All sādhana up to sannyāsa, śrava'ṇa,
etc. is required to remove the layers of adhyāsa.  Once that is done,
nothing need be done to 'make' the brahmajñāna shine.  It shines all by
itself.  It is said:

tvampadārtha-vivekāya sannyāsaḥ sarvakarmaṇām
śrutyā vidhīyate yasmāt tattyāgī patito bhavet

[Sannyāsa from all actions is enjoined by the Shruti in order to enable the
aspirant to clearly discern what is meant by the word 'tvam'.  ....]

>From our side the adhyāsa is required to be cleared.  For the Iśāvāsya
mantra words: तद्दूरे तद्वन्तिके, Shankaracharya writes: तद्दूरे
वर्षकोटिशतैरप्यविदुषामप्राप्यत्वाद्दूर इव । तदु अन्तिके समीपे अत्यन्तमेव
विदुषाम्, आत्मत्वात् न केवलं दूरे, अन्तिके च ।

Brahaman is 'far away' to the ignorant as it is impossible for them to
'attain' it even after aeons.  However, it is 'very close' to the knowers,
since it is the Atman of everyone; it is not just far away but very close
too.
