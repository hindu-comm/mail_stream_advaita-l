Can you give some references in Sastra  saying Gruhasthas can become
Jnanis? Adi Sankara has strongly argued in his Bhashyas against mixing
Karma and Jnana. How can a GRUHASTHA performing Karma at the same time
practice Jnana like Meditation for a long time? The Guru Govinda Paada was
living in a cave when Adi Sankara went to him. Do you think a Gruhastha can
live in a cave alone for many months forgetting his wife and children?

If you say only some hours of Meditation are enough for Brahma
Saakshaatkaara and Gruhastha can manage that it is not correct. A very long
Meditation without breaks will have to be practiced. How can Gruhastha do
that and at the same time not stop his Nitya Karma and attention to family?
Gruhasthas can do Sravana and Manana and short  Nididhyasana meditation but
they can never do it for a long time.

There may be some examples like Janaka but they are very rare examples. In
this age it is not possible to follow him.

One more big gap in the Gruhastha argument. Why are Mathadhipatis for all
Mathas only Sanyasis? If hundreds of Gruhasthas can be Jnanis why they are
not appointed to Mathadhipati post?
