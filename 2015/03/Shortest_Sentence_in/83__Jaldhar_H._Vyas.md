I realized that I have not responded to the the post that started this

If "I am" was the message of Advaita Vedanta it would have been judged an 
insipid philosophy indeed.  No one, in fact no living creature, doubts 
their existence.  We have discussed in the past why this particular kind 
of Vedanta is not called Aikya ("one") but Advaita ("not two") duality is 
the natural or rather I should say conventional state of being.  It 
requires the concerted application of Advaitic sadhana to dispel that 
false notion.  Our message would be "That which was mistakenly thought of 
as only I is in fact All." Which I have to admit is a bit longer!
