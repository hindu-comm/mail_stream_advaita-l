Respected Sir,Pranams to you.
 One can accept it as a mahavakya. But what is the use? It will add some more weight to the already carrying burden in the mind. That is all.Does mere acceptance of a mahavakya confer upon him Atmajnaa? Until and unless one becomes AvRuttacakShuH he cannotcognize the vastu viz.,one's true svarUpaand thereby he will never get Atmajnana. A mumukshu's sadhana should be directing his attention to that which exists prior to the appearance of the varna, word, phrase and sentences.Do you agree?Withwarm and respectful regards,Sreenivasa Murthy

 Subject: [Advaita-l] Shortest Sentence in English is a Mahaa Vaakya?

Namaste

I got a Whatsapp message from a friend. The shortest sentence in English is
'I am'. Looking at it I feel it has a Advaita message in it. If you say 'I
am a man', 'I am the son of So and So', 'I am tall', 'I am short', 'I am
fat', 'I am slim', 'I am intelligent', 'I am stupid', 'I am young', 'I am
old', 'I am fair', 'I am dark', 'I am rich', 'I am poor' and so on it is
all because of MAAYAA only. None of the sentences are TRUE.

But the sentence 'I am' is TRUE. It is only saying I Exist. It is never
False.

What is a Mahaa Vaakya? It must be pointing to the Paaramaarthika Satya but
not Vyaavahaarika Satya. The Upanisad Mahaa Vaakyas are all meeting this
requirement. That is Aham Brahmaasmi, Tat Tvam Asi, Ayam Atmaa Brahma and
Prajnaanam Brahma are all meeting the requirement. They are all pointing to
Brahman the Advaita Reality. The shortest sentence 'I am' is also pointing
to Paaramaarthika Satya Sat. Sat is Pure Existence.

Can we accept 'I am' is a Mahaa Vaakya in English?
