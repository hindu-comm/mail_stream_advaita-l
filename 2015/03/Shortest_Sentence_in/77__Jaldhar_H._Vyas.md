The sun is a good example. Someone may think it rises from the eastern 
ocean and sets in the west.  One who has studied astronomy knows that this 
is an illusion and really it is the Earth moving around the Sun.  Has the 
sun changed?  Or only the perspective of the observer?

Brahman is always there but our perspectives on it are warped to a greater 
or lesser degree by identification with ahamkar.  When one takes sannyasa 
it doesn't mean danda, kamandalu etc. it means completely destroying 
ahamakara.  Such a person is a jnani and knows Brahman without illusions.
