Could we please not argue all over the place? Grhastha-s are gRhe stithAH, not 
maThe sthitAH, therefore your last question does not even arise. It is not a validargument to make.
It has nothing to do with the possibility of jnAna in that ASrama at all. If your
argument is that no gRhastha can ever become a jnAnI, that is false. That it is a
rarity is a different issue altogether.

Conversely, Sri Sreenivasa Murthy's implied stance, that there are more gRhastha
jnAnI-s than there are sannyAsI jnAnI-s, is also an invalid argument.
Best regards,Vidyasankar
