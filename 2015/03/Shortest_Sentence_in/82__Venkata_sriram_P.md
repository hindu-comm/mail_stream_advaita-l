Namaste Sreenivasa Murthy Ji,

The problem was with your sweeping remark on "shankara sampradAya" which 
is coming down in the form of "AchArya-shishya parampara".

You shouldn't have used the word "obsolete sampradayas" which is so vibrant in some 
traditional mutts.

One of the ashotOttara nAmAvaLi of our beloved Acharya Sankara is 
"parivrAjAshramOdhattrE namaH" ie., "Salutations to one who revived the 
parivrAjaka / yati / sanyAsa dharma".

Otherwise, I agree with your rest of the statements about mOkSa-adhikAratva-nirNaya to
grihastha.

regs,
sriram
