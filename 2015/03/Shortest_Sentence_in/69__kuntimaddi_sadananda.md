 >>sa gurumevAbhigachchhetsamitpANiH

 What is the purpose of going
 to a guru with "samitpANiH"?

---------------
Now a days gurukula may not need samith - In stead one can take check leafs or cash to support the Gurukula. 

Idea is to serve the Teacher/Gurukula needs. Implied humility indicates that the mind is ready to receive the knowledge which is priceless.

Hari Om!
