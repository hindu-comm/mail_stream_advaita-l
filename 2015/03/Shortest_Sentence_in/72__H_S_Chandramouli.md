Sri Jaldharji,


 Reg your observation


 Something which often gets lost in this discussions is that there are two
basic kinds of sannyasis.  Those who have taken it up a spiritual
discipline with a view to preparing to achieve jnana and those who have
already achieved jnana and therefore are in sannyasa by default because
there is nothing left in this samsara for them to desire.  Both of them
will respond to the mahavakya in a different way.


 I think there is another issue which clouds this requirement for sanyasa
ashrama in quest of jnana. This is concerning


 Those who have taken it up a spiritual discipline with a view to preparing
to achieve jnana .


 As per my understanding of the Bhashya , sanyasa ashrama can be taken at
two different stages of sadhana. First is to achieve the necessary
qualifications for taking to Brahma Vidya namely Sadhana Chatushtaya
Sampatti. This stage is what is exemplified in the Mundaka Mantra quoted by
you


 parikShya lokAnkarmachitAnbrAhmaNo nirvedamAyannAstyakR^itaH kR^itena |
tadviGYAnArthe sa gurumevAbhigachchhetsamitpANiH shrotriyaM brahmaniShTam
||


 For reaching this stage two sadhana margas are permissible, one is through
Karma Yoga and the other through Sanyasa Yoga. This is what is discussed
extensively in BG Ch 5 with Sri Krishna concluding that Karma Yoga should
normally be the preferred Sadhana Marga. Having reached this stage, either
through Karma Yoga or Sanyasa Yoga , according to my understanding of the
Bhashya Sanyasa Ashrama is compulsory for achieving Jnana. There is no
choice for the Sadhaka. Sri Bhagavatpada himself has clarified in Mundaka
Upanishad as well as in BS Bhashyas that exceptions to this rule which are
often cited by many do not in any way invalidate this general requirement.
I do understand that many post Bhagavatpada advaitins do not agree on this
point , but at least as far as Sri Bhagavatpada himself is concerned there
is no ambiguity on this issue. This is my understanding of the Bhashya. I
am specifically bringingup this issue here because there is quite a good
deal of animated arguments in this regard especially when interpreting Sri
Krishna's views expressed in BG Ch 5. I would like your specific response
on this point.


 Regards
