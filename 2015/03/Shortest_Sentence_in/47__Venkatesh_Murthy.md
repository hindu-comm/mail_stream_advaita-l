Namaste

I got a Whatsapp message from a friend. The shortest sentence in English is
'I am'. Looking at it I feel it has a Advaita message in it. If you say 'I
am a man', 'I am the son of So and So', 'I am tall', 'I am short', 'I am
fat', 'I am slim', 'I am intelligent', 'I am stupid', 'I am young', 'I am
old', 'I am fair', 'I am dark', 'I am rich', 'I am poor' and so on it is
all because of MAAYAA only. None of the sentences are TRUE.

But the sentence 'I am' is TRUE. It is only saying I Exist. It is never
False.

What is a Mahaa Vaakya? It must be pointing to the Paaramaarthika Satya but
not Vyaavahaarika Satya. The Upanisad Mahaa Vaakyas are all meeting this
requirement. That is Aham Brahmaasmi, Tat Tvam Asi, Ayam Atmaa Brahma and
Prajnaanam Brahma are all meeting the requirement. They are all pointing to
Brahman the Advaita Reality. The shortest sentence 'I am' is also pointing
to Paaramaarthika Satya Sat. Sat is Pure Existence.

Can we accept  'I am' is a Mahaa Vaakya in English?
