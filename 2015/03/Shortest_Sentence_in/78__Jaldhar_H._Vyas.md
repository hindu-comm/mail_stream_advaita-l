No comment on your own insolent words?  Control your self before taking 
issue with others.

This is a list for discussing Advaita Vedanta according to Shankaracharya 
and Smarta sampradaya.  It always has been and always will be.  We make 
an effort to ensure new members understand this and are not misled in any 
way.  Still for some reason there are people who think any random 
opinion is ok.  Why?  The mind boggles.
