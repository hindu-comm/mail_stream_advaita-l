You might be interested in some previous discussion we've had on this 
subject starting here:

I have a theory.  As per the mimamsa shastra, all acts -- even seemingly 
unrelated laukika ones -- can be reduced to yajna.  All yajnas can be 
reduced to the archtypical act of offering samidh into agni.  Therefore 
samidh is the essence of the essence of karma.  Thus by entrusting samidh 
to the guru, one is showing respect and humility by entrusting all ones 
prior acts.  Consider that a brahmachari also approaches his acharya at 
the time of upanayana with samidh.  Because there it is the acharyas job 
to provide the brahmachari with the means to perform future karma.

dakshina whether of money or goods does not have the same conceptual 
effect because it is a transfer from the producer to the consumer

No but eventually they must have taken it or they would have remained 
mired in samsara.  As has been pointed out earlier, one can become a 
sannyasi as vividisha or vidvan.
