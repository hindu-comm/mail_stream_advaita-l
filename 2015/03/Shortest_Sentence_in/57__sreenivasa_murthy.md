Dear Sri Venkatesh MurthyPranams to you.
You have written : "In Advaita tradition the Mahaa Vaakyas are playing an important role. The senior Swamiji will give Mahaa Vaakya Upadesha to junior Swamiji. The Brahma Jnana will be from Sravana Manana Nididhyaasana of the Mahaa Vaakya only. Because of this the Swamijis become Jeevan Muktas."
Is mahavakya upadesha has to be given only to sanyasins? Why ? Are not the householders entitled for Atmajnana? The Vedic Rishis were not sanyasins. Yajnavlkya Of Bruhadaranyaka Upanishad was a gRuhasta and he taught Brahmavidya to Janaka who was a a King. Ajatashatru who taught Brahmavidya to Balaki was a king. Saunaka who was a gruhasta was taught paravidya by Angiras. The very first mantra of Mundaka Upanishad states : "sa brahmavidyAM sarvavidyApratiShThAm jyEShThaputrAya prAha ||" 
So the Upanishadic tradition is that The Guru imparts Brahmavidya to a shishya who approaches Guru with humility. That is the true and genuine tradition.Brahmavidya is not the monopoly of sanyasins . Any man who has that intense desire for mukti is entitled for Atmajnana. 
With warm and respectful regards,Sreenivasa Murthy.

I agree words and sentences will not themselves give Atma Jnana because
Upanisad also says 'Yato Vacho Nivartante Aprapya Manasa Saha' the Atmaa
cannot be described in words and understood by mind. But Mahaa Vaakyas can
point to Atmaa.

Like you see a sign in the road. If you follow the sign it will take you
destination. But the sign is not the destination. By seeing that sign you
cannot say you have reached destination. Similarly the Mahaa Vaakyas should
be Heard, Reflected and Meditated. Then you will get Atma Jnana. Following
the Sravana, Manana and Nididhyasana of Mahaa Vaakyas will give Atma Jnana.

I agree also simply listening to Mahaa Vaakyas and repeating like it Mantra
will not be useful. Reflection and Meditation are very necessary. Without
them there will not be Atma Jnana.

In Advaita tradition the Mahaa Vaakyas are playing an important role. The
senior Swamiji will give Mahaa Vaakya Upadesha to junior Swamiji. The
Brahma Jnana will be from Sravana Manana Nididhyaasana of the Mahaa Vaakya
only. Because of this the Swamijis become Jeevan Muktas.
