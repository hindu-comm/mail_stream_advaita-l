However for normal rudri patha we usually just do Shada~nganyAsa.

Because it deals with upasana, some call shivasamkalpasukta an upanishad.

These together form the 31st adhyaya of Vajasaneyi Samhita

The apratiratha sukta is rks 33-44 of the 17th adhyaya of the V.S.

Also after this, it is the custom to recite 17.44-49.

The maitra sukta is V.S. 33.30-43 and also three mantras from the 7th 
adhyaya are include between the 4th and 5th rks.

This is with a few minor differences the same as the Taittireya Samhita 
version.  It is the 16th adhyaya of the V.S.

> 6) mahichhara adhyaya

Actually, these are also counted as part of the 6th adhyaya


> 8) chamakam

This called the 7th adhyaya.  It is the 18th adhyaya of the V.S.

The Shanti is the 8th adhyaya and it is followed by the svastiprarthana.
