But so called "yagna-centric view" was offered to deny/reject bhagvat para
artha for mantra/brAhmaNa parts of texts. It was rejected so on the basis
that such artha are apramANa.

That's the very exact point I was contesting -- when we have niravakASha
vAkyas (such as 'vEdEschha sarvErahamEva vEdyaH' etc.), which cannot be
interpreted in any other way, why did "tradition" treat mantra/brAhmaNa
parts differently? Aren't mantra/brAhmaNa part of vEda? Why dilute force of
Krishna's qualifier "sarvE"? Isn't gIta pramAna for those sampradAyavits?
The very division of spectrum of vEdic texts into karama-kAnDa and
jnyAna-kAnDa is artificial and apramANika. On one hand there is no sAdhaka
pramANa, and on the other there is shruti virOdha for such division.

One can accept pUpva-mImAmska's "tradition" in interpreting so, but again
there is no need for Ishvara for them either. But what is the excuse for
vEdAntins?

But that itself does not make it pramANika.

Current topic is about whether manyu sUkta is shrI narasiMha para or not
(sarva vaidIka shbda-s vAchyatva Parabrahma para or not in general). By
saying this discussion is not about vEdAnta, it implies a artificial line
being drawn between mantra/brAhmaNa part and Upanishadic part. Perhaps,
this may be due to literally interpreting "anta" in vEdAnta as "end"?

Again,  gIta and other quoted shruti vAkya-s does not accept this position
on the force of "sarvE" , "sarvatra" etc, such adjuncts.
