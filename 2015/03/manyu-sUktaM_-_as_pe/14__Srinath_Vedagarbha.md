But yagna itself is not final purushArtha for any shades of vEdAntins
either.

As you already know, dvaitins hold three view -- aadi-bhoutika,
aadi-dhaivIka and adhyAtmika

Yajna-centric view is aadhi-dhavIka view. It does not mean that they negate
the phala granting powers of yajna deities, nor they look upon these
deities as useless or to avoid worship. After all,  Parabrahman has granted
such powers (of giving yajna phala etc ) to such deities and He is very
much vested in them. Who are we mortals to override it? Dvaitins do worship
all deities per dictum 'parivArayatha grahyaM, sarvottamatvya agrahyaM".
Where as adhyAtmika view of seeing these vEdic texts is altogether superior
one as the phala itself is of superior nature. That too, there exist
explicit niravakASha vAkyas which clearly establishes the source of such
powers to other yagna deities.
