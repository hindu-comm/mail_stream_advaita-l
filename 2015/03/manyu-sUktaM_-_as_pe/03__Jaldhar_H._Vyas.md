He isn't and some random person saying it doesn't make it so. (I place 
anyone outside smarta sampradaya as apramana for dharmic guidance.  Their 
interpretations may or may not be interesting for other reasons but not 
for this.)

Please resist the temptation to rely on audio.  We discussed recently 
about the decline of certain Vedic shakhas and part of the reason is that 
even astikas are choosing to take shortcuts.  Try as hard as you can to 
find a qualified vidvan to teach you and in the end you will be glad you 
did.
