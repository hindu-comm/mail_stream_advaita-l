In the post below is a sentence quoted:

'vAsudEva parA vEdaH'   ('Eva' kaara again here)

Where is the evakāra here?

Actually the presentation should be:

'vAsudEvaparA vEdāḥ'   (Vedas are vāsudeva-specific/centric)

Shankaracharya, while commenting on the Vishnusahasranama, has cited
etymological verses from the purāṇas for the names 'viṣnu, vāsudeva, rudra,
etc.' Even 'Keśava' has such an etymological meaning.  For advaitins such
names cannot be pinned to any saguṇa deity but have the capacity to denote
Brahman the substratum of the vivarta of the world.  Even the Rg.vedic
mantra 'chatuḥ kapardā'  (see an article on this:
https://adbhutam.wordpress.com/2009/11/03/the-four-glories-of-maya/)
is not any deity-specific but the general Māyāśakti which for advaitins is
the creative/destructive/protective, etc. power of Brahman which also
deludes.  For non-advaitins this Rg.vedic mantra might be a praise of
'Ambhriṇī' or Lakshmi.
