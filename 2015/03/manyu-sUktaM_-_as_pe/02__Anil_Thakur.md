Dear Venkat ji,

Thanks for your post on Manyu Suktam.

It is very interesting to know that SrI NrIsimha is the adhiSTAna dEvata
for Manyu Suktam.

Would it possible for you to guide me in getting the audio for correct
patha for Manyu Suktam. There are a few available on Youtube but am not
sure about it's correctness.

Regards,
Anil
