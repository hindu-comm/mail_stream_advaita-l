 You're right, aham means Brahman only, but you see by including jIva also
into the scope of "aham"  (by virtue of identity), then sarva vEda should
have been jIva para also, but Krishna did not mean that either, or did He?

Also, another difficulty, by saying "aham is vEdya from vEda", it
automatically makes that aham as jnEya-brahman, which is not nirguNa
brahman but upAsya brahman and hence lower.


So, it seems by saying 'vEdEschha ahmEva vEdyaH' Krishna also implying
'vEdEschha
sarvEbhedEva vEdyaH', but you know I may be wrong :)
