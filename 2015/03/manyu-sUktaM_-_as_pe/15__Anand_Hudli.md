A number of irrelevant points are being made above. There was no
assertion made by anyone that a yajna-centric approach has to adopted
for interpreting Vedantic texts. There is a long tradition, a
saMpradAya, of interpreting the mantra and brAhmaNa portions of the
Veda in a yajna-centric manner.

The earliest known commentator on the Rigveda, skanda svAmin (7th CE),
as well as udgItha (7th CE) and VenkaTa mAdhava, just to name a few,
have all followed the Yajna-centric approach in interpreting the
mantra and brAhmaNa portions.

These bhAShyakAras themselves were following the same sampradAya
established by earlier bhAShyakAras. And the topic of current
discussion is not about VedAnta but has to do with the mantra portion.
Finally, to repeat the point I made earlier, in the context of a
Yajna, there is no scope to establish a hierarchy (highest to lowest)
among the Vedic deities.
