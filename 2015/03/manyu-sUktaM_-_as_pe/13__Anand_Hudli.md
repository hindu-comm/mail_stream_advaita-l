A Yajna-centric interpretation of brAhmaNa and saMhita vAkyas allows
no hierarchy to be established
among the Vedic deities, because there are no such nIcha and uchcha
roles played by
deities in a Yajna. Wherever a hierarchy is read by some, as in this
case and in the aitareya brAhmaNa vAkya
agnirvai devAnAmavamo viShNuH paramaH, it can be explained from
Yajna-centric point of view as expressing
a sequence in the Yajna process rather than a hierarchy. There is
absolutely no scope for a hierarchy of deities to be established in a
Yajna.
