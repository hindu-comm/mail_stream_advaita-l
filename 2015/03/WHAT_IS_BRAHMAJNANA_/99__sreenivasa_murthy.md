 Dear Readers,
 Brahmajnana / AtmajnanaEven though various names have been given to Brahman in Upanishads it is neither an object to vAk (mAtu) nor to mental mode (pratyaya). Brahman is our own true svarUpa (AtmasvarUpa)  which is THE WITNESS of these two.Non-perceptual and non-conceptual realization of the above within oneself by oneself is Brahmajnana or Atmajnana. Thus taught my Revered Guru. 
I have shared this teaching which is based on Kena Upanishadwith like minded, open minded andsincere mumukshus. With warm regards,Sreenivasa Murthy
