Yes. Words-ಮಾತು and Mind-ಮನಸ್ಸು cannot grasp Brahman. The Upanisad is
saying ಯತೋ ವಾಚೋ ನಿವರ್ತಂತೇ ಅಪ್ರಾಪ್ಯ ಮನಸಾ ಸಹ. But first of all we have to use
ಮಾತು and ಮನಸ್ಸು only to understand this point. In the beginning itself if
we say this it is not correct. ಮಾತು and ಮನಸ್ಸುwill start creating false
concepts for Atma and Brahma. Like Brahman is a God with many Gunas.

We have to use ಮಾತು and ಮನಸ್ಸು negatively to deny the same false concepts
using ನೇತಿ ನೇತಿ Neti Neti. All the Sankara Bhashyas are doing this only.
They are using ನೇತಿ ನೇತಿ to deny false concepts created by ಮಾತು and ಮನಸ್ಸು
and pointing to outside ಮಾತು and ಮನಸ್ಸು.
