I understand that the washing, if any, has to be done only by sprinkling water and never by dipping in water.

 I don't know the scriptural evidence for the same, but I do know that Bilvadalas are indeed reused sometimes. At the time of removing nirmaalyam, the dalas are taken out separately, washed and preserved to be reused, if required.

 Subject: [Advaita-l] Doubt regarding recycling of Vilva/bhel leaves for doing Shiva Pooja.
 
Dear All,
Pranams,
I have heard from a very learned friend that old Bhel/vilva leaves, which are used in Shiva pooja can be recycled (re-used) for one year without any violation of sanctity for doing Shiva Pooja, provided they are preserved in dry and usable condition, if fresh vilva leaves are not available. Similarly, Tulasi/basil leaves can be used for six months for performing Vishnu Pooja. Is this correct and if yes, i would like to have the scriptural quotations/references regarding the same. Thanks for the help in advance, Ramesh Ramanan.
