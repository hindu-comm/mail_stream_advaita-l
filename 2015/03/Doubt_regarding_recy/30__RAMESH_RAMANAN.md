Dear All,
Pranams,
I have heard from a very learned friend that old Bhel/vilva leaves, which are used in Shiva pooja can be recycled (re-used) for one year without any violation of sanctity for doing Shiva Pooja, provided they are preserved in dry and usable condition, if fresh vilva leaves are not available. Similarly, Tulasi/basil leaves can be used for six months for performing Vishnu Pooja. Is this correct and if yes, i would like to have the scriptural quotations/references regarding the same. Thanks for the help in advance, Ramesh Ramanan.
