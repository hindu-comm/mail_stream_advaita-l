Namaste,

////

There is no mention of shrI narasiMha here

bhairava tantra gives different sampuTikaraNa, samyOjana mantrAs and utkeelana prakriya. 

Personally, I follow "AnjanEya upAsana" with the help of this manyu-sUkta only.  This involves,
samyOjana of hanumad mantra, hanumad gAyatri, manyu mUla mantra (samsruSTaM ....).  

There is also another upAsana paddhati for manyu sUkta which involves invocation of "nArasimha"
as per the bhairava kalpa which codifies saying:

sIraM kAmaM tathA mAyAM nArasimhaM varAhakaM
pancha bIjaM samucchArya madhyE r^k yOjyatE budhaiH 

Here, 

sIraM = hrAM
kAmaM = kleeM
mAyA = hrIM
nArasimhaM = kSrauM
varAhakaM = glauM

The above pancha-bIjAs should be suffixed and prefixed to each of the r^k of manyu sUkta.
Infact, there is a prakriya called "pAda archa", "ardha archa" and pUrNa archa.

There are 15 nyAsAs for manyu-sUkta and the upAsaka should place these upon himself. 

The yantrOddhAra of manyu yantra is:

1) vritta 2) aSTakONa karNika 3) shaTkONa 4) dasa-daLa padma 5) dwAdasa-daLa padma
6) shODasha-daLa padma 7) aSTa-daLa padma 8) rEkhA-traya;

and this is followed by bhUpura enclosed with 4 angles.

regs,
sriram
