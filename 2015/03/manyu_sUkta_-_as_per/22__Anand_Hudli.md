I have explored this particular Rigvedic sUkta, in praise of Manyu, a little based on sources such as the nirukta, the AshvalAyana shrauta sUtra, sAyaNa bhAShya, and the brAhmaNas. There is no mention of shrI narasiMha here. In fact, it is possible to interpret the word Manyu as Rudra (vide Rudram mantra: namaste rudra manyave....). I will write about this later, when I find time. 

Anand
