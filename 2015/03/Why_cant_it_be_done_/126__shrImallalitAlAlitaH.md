​Then don't talk about destroying sects and making a homogenous one.

​Really, I'm sorry to see that you could see only this difference in only
brAhmaNa-s.

​What type of brAhmaNa-s you mean? Just born as brAhmaNa-s and not studying
veda-s, etc.?
That's not type of brAhmaNa-s which is base of sanAtana-dharma.

The problem is that you are assuming that all brAhmaNa-s are similar, i.e.
they study veda-s, have faith in Ishvara, shAstra, etc. This is not true.
So, you can't get any benefit by uniting such brahma-bandhU-s.
Those who are following veda-s, dharama, etc. well know that they have
common ground called veda-s. That's enough for them to unite.
How they explain that same veda, doesn't matter- for all are Astika-s.

​Sure, for that just kill their beloved philosophy and thinking power.

​As, homogenous society is constrained, it will be non-creative, stagnant.
BTW, you can't control other men. Just see how your son doesn't follow your
every word just because he has power to think, i.e. he is sentient.

These are not philosophical issues.

​You are talking childish.
These religions(I don't know how they turned to religion from
philosophies), look childish to you!!?? Go read even a single treatise of
their great AchArya-s and learn to appreciate their thinking capability.
I don't think that people like you can even think about objections which
they imagined and refuted.
These childish talks can come from only that person who, due to lack of
study and ability of critical analysis, clings to the first thing which
comes in his hand. This is the case of most neo-vedAntin-s.

​Just talk more and reveal how ignorant are you of shAstra-s and sankR^ita
technical terms!!

​As if rAmAnuja-s, madhva-s were without any lineage.
What about sha~Nkara in similar view.

​So, even your advaita, which is just play of buddhi, can't grasp AtmA,
isn't it?

​His teacher may be advaitI, but they were intellectuals and hence they
came up with new logic. What's problem in it? Why should their be any
paramparA of logic? Why shouldn't new and right thing be accepted ?
Don't think like Islamist.
