In the following URL is a blog with the above title:

https://adbhutam.wordpress.com/2015/02/01/aham-atma-gu%E1%B8%8Dakesa/

The blog aims at dispelling some misconceived ideas about the Bhagavadgita
and Advaita.  The upaniṣadic concept of 'pratyagātmā' is highlighted to
bring out the Vedantic teaching of 'aham brahma asmi'.

Owing to the length of the blog it is not being posted here directly.
