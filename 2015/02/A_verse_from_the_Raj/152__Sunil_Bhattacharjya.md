Dear friends,
There is the following verse in the Rajatarangini, which has confused many people : 

तत्रानेहस्युज्जयिन्यांश्रीमान् हर्षापराभिघः।
एकच्छत्रश्चक्रवर्त्तीविक्रमादित्य इत्यभूत् ॥राजतरङ्गिणी3.125 || 
Somescholars think that word “हर्षापराभिघः"in the verse is not correct and it should have beenwritten as “हर्षापराभिधः"= having another name as Harsha (आख्याह्वेअभिधानंच नमधेयं च नाम च -अमरः;अभिधानम्=अभिधा,अस्यास्तीतिअभिधः)
May I request the Sanskrit scholars in this forum to give their views on it. One has to keep in mond that Al Biruni, who visited India one century before Kalhana authored the Rajatarangini, says that Sriharsha lived 400 years before Vikramaditya.
Regards,Sunil KB
