Dear All,
Pranams/Namaskarams,
I read in a Tamil book that one should not worship a Shiva Linga, or Shoola (weapon of Mother Parvathi) or Discus of Vishnu in the Pooja room at home. If one does so, wealth will not stay with him, that is, he will lose wealth. Is this correct? I worship a Shiva Linga and perform Abhishekam to it regularly. I do not do the poooja/Abhishekam in the pooja room, but in the balcony of my flat. Is that ok? Or does the prohibition of the pooja room include the balcony also? I am confused about this and would like to be enlightened by knowledgeable members of this board. Let me add that I definitely feel great joy in performing abhishekam to Lord Shiva, but this statement in the book has confused me. Please note that I do not have time or the opportunity to go to the temple everyday and perform abhishekams. Thanks in advance for the clarifications. Ramesh Ramanan
