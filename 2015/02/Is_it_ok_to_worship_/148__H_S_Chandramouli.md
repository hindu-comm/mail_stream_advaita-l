I am surprised at the observation made by Sri Ramesh Ramanan. In my family
Sivalinga Abhishekham on a daily basis is being done for over a century now
by various members in their houses. It is done in the Pooja Room only.I
have not across such an observation by anyone so far. Our family house is
visited by any number of very well known vaidika brahmins and purohits. No
one has made such an observation.

Regards
