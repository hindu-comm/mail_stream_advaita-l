Namaste
If the book is saying we should not do Shiva Pooja in Pooja Room it is a
contradiction. Pooja Room is for doing Pooja. If you do Shiva Pooja outside
the Pooja Room that place may not have same Purity like Pooja Room. Someone
may have sat there without taking bath, eaten food and so on. This is one
point.

Another point is we should not be worried while doing Pooja when God will
give wealth and when He will take away wealth. If He wants He will give
otherwise He will take away. The devotee need not worry.
