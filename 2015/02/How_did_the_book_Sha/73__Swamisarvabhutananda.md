If one does not have shraddA in SRUTI and the Guru , human intelligence paves the way for perversion!

> Following this, Sri Chandrashekarendra Saraswathi Mahaswamigal had directed Sri Anantha Krishna Shastri to prepare a refutation of all the arguments in the book and when it was ready, Sri Anantha Krishna Shastri went to him for a Sri Mukham and title for the book, which he had prepared. Any ordinary person would have suggested the title 'Shatha Dhooshanai Dhooshani' condemnation of the book Shatha Dhooshani). But the Mahaswami used the name of the native place of Sri Anantha Krishna Shastri (He hailed from Noorani, which can be split up into Nooru +Ani which means 100 ornaments in Tamil and thus derived the name Shatha Bhooshani as the title of the book).

After Sri Anantha Krishna Shastri got the Sri Mukham from Sri Abhinava Vidya Theertha, he also   sought another Sri Mukham from Sri Chandrashekarendra Saraswathi Mahaswamil. The Mahaswami said: "Let the Sri Mukham from Sri Abhinava vidya Theertha alone be the Sri Mukahm for this book. That itself is enough. The Swamiji is a great person. There is no need for another Sri Mukham. and kept himself out of the limelight. It was only because Sri Raa Ganapathi wrote about this, that I was able to know about Sri ChandraShekarendra Saraswathi Mahaswami's involvement in the work.
