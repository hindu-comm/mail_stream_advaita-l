The objective of the Mani Manjari is to market the product, dvaita
philosophy, that is purported to be opposed to Advaita.  The strategy
adopted is to show the Advaita Acharya in poor light and thereby gain
clientele for their product which has no other content to appeal to the
learned and the laity.

Quoted below is an excerpt from Swami Maheshananda Giri's introduction to
the Chandogya Upanishad Bhashya, edited and published by Mahesh Research
Institute, Varanasi, 1982:

// We have been studying the different commentators, such as Srikantha,
Ramanuja, Vallabha, Nimbarka, Baladeva, Srikara, Madhva and the moderners,
for over fifty years now. We have seen that apart from the criticism of the
Advaita-view, there is little more in the content of their traditional view
that is not found in Shankara, or is not just a logical corollary of what
he has said. It is our challenge that apart from logic-chipping, not a
single spiritual fibre, which has not been either supported or contradicted
by Shankara, can be shown in the works of these commentators. All the
statements of the other commentators about God, are melted down in the
crucible of the concept of Saguna Brahman of Shankara. The concept of
Brahman of Srikantha and Ramanuja is practically identical with Shankara's
concept of Ishwara, and they rarely try to contradict it. Similarly,
Shankara's concept of Virat or Sutratman takes care of Madhva, Vallabha and
others. Thus, what they contradict, is the range outside their vision. Had
they been true traditionalists, they would have presented different facets
of the same Truth which Shankara had presented. When it comes to present a
positive aspect of the spiritual Being, they have little to say, though
they roar to assert what it is not. This gives the lie to their having
received a different unbroken tradition. ......but the traditionalist that
Shankara was, he never criticised or disowned the views of Virat,
Hiranyagarbha or Ishwara. He rather developed complete harmony between
them. Thus, without any fear of contradiction, we can say that Shankara's
is THE Hindu tradition. //
