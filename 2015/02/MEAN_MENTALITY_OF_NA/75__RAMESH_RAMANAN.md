Dear Sri Srivathsa Rao,
Pranams, 
Do not get agitated by all this scrap. Why should we endorse the stand of the Vishishtadvaiti or Dvaithis? We do know for sure that Sri Shankara was an embodiment of Lord Shiva Himself. Why should we bother our heds with unwanted garbage from these so-called writers or theologians? Students of Advaita should try to establish themselves in their natural state and abide therein without any straying, as that alone is our real bliss. Even if a billion books are authored to establish Advaita beyond the least shadow of doubt, the doubting Thomases will continue to heap doubt upon doubt without even any fundamental basis to their arguments. You can wake up some one who is sleeping, but it is almost impossible to wake up one who is pretending to be asleep. Sri Adi Shankara does not need any certificate of authenticity or glory from Sri Madhva or Narayana Panditacharya. Hope you understand this. Ramesh Ramanan.
