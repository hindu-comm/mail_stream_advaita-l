SrI mAtre namaH 

Namaste SrI SharmA ,

You wrote " Why is Kartikeya called dhurta and why is he worshipped even after being a
dhurta?" 
Kindly notify the word ' dhUrta ' is not a insulting word for Sri kumAra .

Following are reasons why he is called dhUrta. 

1) In north Indian tradition kumAra is considered as a bachelor god , who later broke the quoth of life long celibacy and married devasenA ( shashthI ) .

2) He was considered ( historically ) as patron deity of thieves , looters , cheaters , gamblers and of all those frauds ( altogether called dhUrtas ).So since all dhUrtas worship him as their god the came to known as skanda dhUrta . 

3) In Tamize story versions he for marrying Valli , took many forms ( old man , hunter , bangle seller ) and in form of old man by doing cheat ( dhUrtatA ) he took promise from valli to mary him that's why he came to known as dhUrta .
