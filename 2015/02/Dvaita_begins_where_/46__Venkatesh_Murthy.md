Namaste

There is false derogatory propaganda against Advaita and Adi Sankara in
this article

http://creative.sulekha.com/dvaita-begins-where-advaita-ends_426019_blog

The Author is so foolish he is ignorant of Modern Science findings. He is
simply attacking Advaita thinking Modern Scientists are like 18th century
scientists.

I think this idiot Author has not studied any science after 7th standard.
With his weak brain he is condemning Advaita. He can fool small children
with childish Dvaita theory but adults will not believe him.

The new Science is agreeing with Advaita. There are many articles to prove
this.

See below links. Scientists are questioning reality of the Universe now.
