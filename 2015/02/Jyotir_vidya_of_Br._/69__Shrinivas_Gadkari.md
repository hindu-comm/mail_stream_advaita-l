Namaste,Can some list members provide references to "jyotir vidyA" which is hinted at in Brihadranyaka Upanishad 4.4.16.For example, 4.4.10 in the same chapter, is a hint to the vidyA of Isa VasyaUpanishad. Similarly, is the "jyotir vidyA" hinted at in 4.4.16, dealt with moreelaborately somewhere else.Thanks, and regards,Shrinivas Gadkari
