Srivathasa Rao - PraNAms

I do not want to get into unnecessary debates. In my last mail I have mentioned that ontologically Brahman from absolute point has no parts - this is the statement of Scriptures - ekam eva adviteeyam. - Also in Kailvalya upanishad.

The apparent parts are at transactional level. The scriptures provides three examples of transformation-less transformation - gold becoming many ornaments - From gold point no parts but yet rings, bangles, bracelets are different. The differences are only at vaachaarmbhanam vikaaraH - naamkevaste. Hence I mentioned about ontological status in my last post.

Additional questions are answered in the Fundamentals of adviaita vedanta series of talks of the Advanced Vedanta mentioned earlier.They are available on yu-tube. We have just completed the tat tvam asi analysis. 

With this I  stop.

Hari Om!
Sadananda
