In Advaita, the Atman/Brahman is Jnānasvarūpa.  The jiva, with his
mind/intellect, has to realize this.  This happens through a vṛtti.  The
vṛtti reveals the true nature of the Atman, as one's true nature, and
thereby the ignorance pertaining to the Atman is dispelled.  The jiva now
knows that it is the eternal chaitanya svarupa.  So, there is no question
of jnāna-dhāraṇa for the Atman.  Nor is the intellect required to retain
jnanasvarupa since the vṛtiti itself is of a short time duration.  It is
enough if the jiva, now mukta, retains the realization.  He is called
sthita-prajna.  After this realization, the body lasts for some period
according to prarabdha and dies.  The sukshma sharira too is dissolved: na
tasya prāṇā utkrāmanti atraiva samavanīyanti...according to the Br.up.
