Sir,

      Advaita says through knowlege ,we can attain moksham.....

If this is true,then you have to accept athman has got jgnana DHARANA
guna....

If athman is nirguna that means athman doesnot have jgnana dharana guna....


without jgnana dharana guna...how can we attain moksha through jgnana yoga?


PLEASE ANSWER.....
