Namaste,

My aunt's grandfather (brahmsri. nookala satyanarayana shrauti) wrote a book 
called "kriSNa yajurvEda havana paddhati"  which includes samhita 
yAga prakriya also. He himself was a great shrauta ritualist.
 It is in telugu script. If you canunderstand telugu, 
then pls download this book from the below link.  The srImukha
was given by shrI.satchidananda sivAbhinava nrisimha bhArati swamigal of sringeri.
