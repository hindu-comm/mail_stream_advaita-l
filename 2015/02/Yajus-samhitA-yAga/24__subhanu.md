Namaste to all, I read the various responses to Rama's question, which seem to address the vidhi for Taittiriya Samhita Yajña-vidhi only. 

 I had addressed this in a post some time back:

However, if I am not mistaken, Rama's question was different: I think the question was looking for granthas for the vidhi for the complete set of yajñas mentioned in the link he sent.

Rama, I am in Mattur village this weekend for a wedding and will ask my friends there who are adept in Srauta karma if they have any manuscripts on this as they regularly are invited to perform such ceremonies. Taittiriya Samhita Yajña vidhi is a well documented procedure now (the 4 vol Rajarajashri publication I have is excellent) even though it is of recent origin. I have not come across works with similar procedures for Rig and Sama Veda etc even though the precedent for Rig Veda is more ancient. I will see what I can find.

Regards
Subhanu
