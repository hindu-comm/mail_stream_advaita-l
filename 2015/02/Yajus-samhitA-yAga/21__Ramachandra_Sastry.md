Namaste,

Swarnavalli Matha near Sirsi - Karnataka has published Yajurveda Samhita
yaga books in few volumes.
The introduction part in the book details the yaga vidi/devataa/chando
nirnaya for the mantras.

Books can be purchased in Vedanta Book house or Vanadana Book house in
Bangalore or from Matha directly.
