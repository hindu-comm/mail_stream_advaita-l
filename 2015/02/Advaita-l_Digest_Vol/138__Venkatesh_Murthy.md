Will a father dedicate one of his sons to Vedic studies? Possible. Will a
father send one of his sons to a remote village to learn a rare Vedic
Shakha and also financially support his son's Boarding and Lodging and
financially support the Vedic Pundit's teaching? Not possible. This work
must be done by Maths. They must accept responsibility as Custodians of
Vedas.
