Namaste
I think the discussion is very particularly how to revive dying Shakhas.
The example of Kanchi Math reviving Atharvana Saunakeeya Shakha is known to
us. But what about other Maths? They can also revive other dying Shakhas.

Yes many Mathas are doing very good work for Vaidikas in some Shakhas.
Taittireeya Shakha and such populous Shakhas have a bright future.

After Kanchi Math took the bold step to revive Atharvana Shakha, many
people are now coming forward to learn it to make it grow. In Tirupati and
Bengaluru also some people are picking up. In these matters of grave
consequence a good leadership is required to be provided by Maths.
Individual persons have limited ability. They must learn Sva shakha but how
can they worry about some other dying Shakhas?
