Here are two very recent instances that came to my attention and
appreciation:

1.  The recently anointed Jagadguru-designate of the Sringeri pīṭham, in
his pūrvāśrama, was the second of his father's two sons and was 'given' by
his father for full-time Vedic and by extension, śāstraic, studies long
ago. He was taught the Veda by his grandfather and father.  On the day of
his initiation, there was a public function where his teachers were
felicitated.  His two illustrious, fortunate, vedic teachers paid their
respects to the new sannyāsin, who was their grandson/son and student
before, by prostrating before him.

2. A young Madhva, 45, an Engineer working as a Manager in the software
industry in Bangalore, has two sons.  The first is pursuing Engineering
studies and the second one is dedicated by the father to full-time śāstra
studies.  The boy's maternal grandfather was a great scholar and the boy is
the disciple of his maternal uncle, also a well-known scholar.  I saw this
boy and was deeply impressed by his traditional appearance and behaviour
and dedication to scholarship. His father is proud of what he has done. He
knows the boy will shine well.

There need be no appehension about the career, prosperity, etc. of such
boys for there are maṭhas, institutions, etc. that assure them, depending
on their proficiency, etc. a very decent employment, earning, living, etc.
Present day parents should take that bold step to send their only or one of
their wards to vedic/śāstra studies and career.
