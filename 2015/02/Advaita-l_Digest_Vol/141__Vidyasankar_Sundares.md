But what do you think various Maths are doing about vaidika learning? I
don't think you have any idea of the number of vaidika-s being supported
financially and in other ways by the numerous Maths today.

The problem remains what Sri Ajit had outlined. People who should be
following the vaidika professions and getting the requisite studies for it
are not willing to do it. And that includes people like you and me, does
it not? When there are not enough people coming forth to do it, to whom
will the Maths give financial support?
