Thanks for the link to Dr. Tripathi's lecture. It is very sad hear of the
dying of several rescensions - it is such  a loss for all of humanity!

I have heard of an anecdote where Sri Chandrasekhara Sarasvati Swamigal of
Kanchi Kamakoti matham has sent some students to a pundit in Gujarat to
preserve a shakha that was supposed to have been lost.

Is there anything that can be done by us today to preserve endangered
shAkhAs?

Regards,
Venkat
