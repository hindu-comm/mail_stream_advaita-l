In one of his speeches, Jagadguru Sri Abhinava Vidya Tirtha, quotes the
following verse and attributes it to Apastamba-

*na dharma na adharmau charatah AvAm sva iti |*

He further adds- *kechidanyam dharmamAhuhu kechidanyam*

Can anybody please point out from where the text is taken from? I need the
text and the verse number.

Thank you
Nithin
