Nithin ji,

Here are the sources of the passages cited by His Holiness Jagadguru
Sri Abhinava Vidyatheertha Mahaswamigal of Sringeri Sharada Peetham in
His sacred Anugraha Bhashanam:

 a)  "*na dharmAdharmau carataH Avam svaH*" is a part of
Apastamba-dharma-sUtra 1.7.20.6, the full sUtra is "*na dharmAdharmau
carata Avam sva **iti** na deva-gandharvA na pitara ityAcakShate'yaM
dharmo'yam-adharma iti*"

*b)  *the source of  "*kecid-anyaM dharmam-AhuH* *kecid-anyam" *is
Shabara-svAmin's *bhAShya* on *MImAMsA-sUtra *1.1.1
