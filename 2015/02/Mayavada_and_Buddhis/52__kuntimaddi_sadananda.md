Shree Venkatesh - PraNAms

Question - Why do you want to waste your time in trying to understand the rattling of the confused mind? I would concentrate in having clear understanding of advaita then trying to correct these who refuse to be corrected. Many of these concepts have been addressed in the past which apparently he refuses to study.  

Hari Om!
Sadananda

 In this article the Author is making many allegations like
 Adi Sankara and
 Gaudapada got ideas from Buddhist authors like Dharmakirti
 and Nagarjuna.

 The arguments are very complicated for person like me to
 answer. I hope
 scholarly members will give a reply.
