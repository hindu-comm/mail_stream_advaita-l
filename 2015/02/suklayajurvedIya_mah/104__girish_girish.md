Dear Sri Animesh Ji
How different is this mahAnyAsa from the bodhAyana method?
Namastripurasundaryai.


V GirishHe who has faith has ALL
He who lacks faith, lacks all
It is the faith in the name of lord that works wonders
FAITH IS LIFE, DOUBT IS DEATH - Sri Ramakrishna

Namaste ,

Mahanyasam is recited to purify the body, mind and soul of all the impurities. It is a part of the methodology of chanting of the rUdraM on special occasions such as ekAdasharUdraM , laghu rUdraM , mahA rUdraM and ati Rudram. It invokes different deities and in the different limbs (anga's) of the chanter. The following post gives a small description and mahanyasa prayoga of shukla yajurveda.
