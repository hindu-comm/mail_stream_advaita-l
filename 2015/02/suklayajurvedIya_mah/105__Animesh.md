Actually it is from brihada-parashara smriti .The procedure is very different from that of baudhAyana. Another thing is lack of raudrikarana etc. The number of nyasasa are different, some peculiar nyasas are also there like nyasam of rudramantra. The viniyoga of rudra prashna is different. Nayasas are performed by all 5 chapters out of 8 chapters of rudra ashtadhyayi.
Unlike krishnayajurveda rudram , suklayajurveda rudram have 8 chapters ( that's why it is called as rudrashtadhyayi or famously rudri )  
1) ganpati adhyaya ( including shiva samkalpa )
2) purusha suktam + uttara narayan sukta 3) apratiratha adhyaya 
4) maitra adhyaya 
5) namakam
6) mahichhara adhyaya 
7) ugrasha- bhimashach sukta + lomabhya svaha mantra 
8) chamakam 
( additionally shantyadhyaya and svasti prathana adhyayas are recited )
