For two days, 15th and 16th Feb, 2015, there was a meet organized by the
Pūrna Prajna Samshodhana Mandiram, Bangalore, bringing together scholars of
Advaita and Dvaita to present their stand on the famous 'dvā suparṇa'
mantra occurring in the Mundakopanishat. The meet was a follow up of the
publication announced by me in the mail below, in 2014.

There was a lively discussion among scholars who presented specific papers
on various aspects of the main theme.  The Mandiram has promised to bring
out a book containing the various papers presented during the two-day
event.
