Dear Subrahmanian-ji,

Thanks very much for the prompt response and your advice is well
taken. However, I am pursuing this in the spirit of manana, so I hope
you will permit me to take this forward.

I did make the argument on these lines to my boss:

1) His contention is not that "nothing exists", but that "nothing
exists independently". That is, by shunyata he was referring to no
independent existence, not the absence of existence per se.

To which my question to him was, if he believed that, then how does he
agree to the Buddhist's idea of nirvana being permanent, because
according to him, nirvana could not have an independent existence? He
said that nirvana was permanent, but not independent - it was mutually
dependent on samsara! My only answer was that such a nirvana,
dependent on what is an illusion from a paramArthikA point of view,
seems neither permanent nor desirable!

2) His second point was that if something did have true independent
existence, it would be impossible to cognize it. That is, the very act
of knowledge implies an observer and the observed, and then it no
longer is a non-dual system. Without being able to cognise that
existence, it would be as good as it not existing at all.

My response to this was that Brahman by its very nature is Sat and
Chit - and therefore knowledge, the knower and the known are all the
same entity that is in permanent existence. Secondly, as you are
Brahman, even if you do not know it (because of avidya), a lack of
knowledge does not imply the absence of existence (this is circular
logic though!). Not particularly satisfied with my answer, but that is
probably because it is dry ratiocination, as Swami Vidyaranya says.

Any further thoughts?

Regards,

Venkatraghavan
