DearSri Venkatraghavan,

Even shankaracharya says,something cannot come from nothing....or form
emptyness nothing can come.....then from where this bhudhi came according
to bhudhists?

According to advaita there exists a jgnana called brahman,because of which
this world came to exists....who's special power of hiding this jgnana so
called maya ,helps him to create this world.....

but according to bhudhists nothing exists....so for where this bhudhi came
to exist from emptyness?
