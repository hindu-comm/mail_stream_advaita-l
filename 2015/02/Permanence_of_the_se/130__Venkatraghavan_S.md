Dear Sri Ramesh,

Thanks a lot for that mail. He is certainly my boss, but I know him for
over 7-8 years now and from my interactions over this time period, I have
found him to be a very reasonable person and clear thinker, and not easy to
take offence.

The reason why our discussions started was because we were pretty
like-minded individuals, and he was very interested in understanding
advaita and would often ask me more about it. Of late, he is writing a book
from a Buddhist perspective, and he says that our discussions are helping
him to articulate his concepts better.

>From my viewpoint, these discussions help me to understand the clear lines
of difference between Advaita and Buddhism - its very difficult to
understand the subtle nuances of someone else's philosophy (even if one
doesn't agree with it), because typically one finds people either not
willing to talk about their beliefs, or if they do, be pretty jingoistic
about it.

I think where we our debate ended is that I told him that ultimately as
advaitins, we take shruti as pramAna in such matters where perception and
logic are not qualified to opine, and that therefore our philosophy stems
directly from that. He obviously does not believe that, and so we agreed to
disagree!

Regards,
Venkat
