1)
I have a question about madwa philosophy
1) for madwas there are 5 bedas
*)jada-jada
*)jiva -jiva
*)jiva-iswara
*)jiswara-jada and jiva-jada
—————————————…
BUT TODAYS SCIENCE HAVE PROVED THAT THERE IS NO JADA-JADA BEDA…..i:e
according to madhvaacharya ,gold can never become silver….but todays
science have proved that by changing electronics configuration we can
change gold to silver….WHICH ACCORDING TO MADHVAACHARYA IMPOSSIBLE
!!!!!!!…because nothing,or jada loose their prakruthika guna according to
madhvacharya,….
2)jiva-jiva beda:
accoring to dvaita each jiva is suguna and his prakrutika gunas are his own
gunas.
BUT ACCORDING TO ME PRAKRUTHIKA GUNAS ARE NOT OF ATHMAS AND IS SUPER
IMPOSED ON ATHMA,BY READING MY FOLLOWING COMMENTS U PEOPLE COME TO KNOW……..
1)me myself, i am human i see another human in kama,but if i become dog in
next janma,i see dog with kama…..so prakruthika guna kama is not atmans guna
2) bhudhi:
now when we are human we have high level of bhudhi,but if i become dog in
next janma we have bhudhi of the level of dog,so budhi is not atmas guna
if u go on thinking like that u will come to know that ,these gunas atman
got from MAYA of jagath..and is not atmans guna ….so atman is nirgua and
jagath is maya…………so madwaacharya’s jath is truth and 5 bedas are false…….
CAN YOU PEOPLE PLEASE ANSWER MY QUESTION?

2)ultimate knowledge is sacchidaanada. sacchidaananda is the
personality(swarupa) of brahman….which means …..
sat(always present)….chit(consiousness)……anadnda(bliss) …..when you
experience…..this ananda(bliss)…….that means your personality have become
equal to sacchidaanada….in that state you have become sacchidaanada
swarupi…..or in other words…..you have become sacchidaanada rupi brahman
…..which is the ultimate knowledge….as vedas says…..
so….you yourself…..have become sacchidaanada….or YOU HAVE BECOME BRAHMAN
,which is ultimate knowledge….thats why vedas say…..prajgnam brahm….or
brahman is knowledge…..and you are brahman…….(aham brahmamaasmi)……this is
in breaf……the essence of jgnana yoga….
WHAT YOU SAY FOR THIS?
3)
Athman is nirvikaara or nirvikaari….in dvaita
If you accept this athman as nirvikaari ,then you should accept athman is
not atomic and it is infinite or brahman…why because
,now one soul which is human,in this janma,if he become elephant in next
janma,will his soul stretches to the size of elephant?
similarly if that soul become ant in next janma,will its soul will compress
to the size of ant?…..
Similarly,in same janma baby will grow from the small size baby to big
man,if size changes…then soul cannot be called as nirvikaari or avikaari…..
for that purpose,advaita adviceses that athman is infinite in size,or
covers whole world
or athman is brahman…only because of ignorance…it thinks that it is limited
in size……….
what you say for this sir?

4)
Sir,
In dvaita’s trividha jeevas…like rajasa,tamasa,and sathvika jeevas are like
tv serials….where there will be a good person…who will always think good
and do good ,
there will be a bad person…who always think evil and do evil….this is just
the ladys watching tv serial story….hence not practical…..
2)In reality there is atleast a good guna in a bad person and a bad guna in
a very good person….a evil person can become good one day and good person
can become bad one day…..So, we cannot say evil nature or good nature are
nature of his own soul…..So,there cannot be rajasa,sathvika ,tamasa
jeevas…..
WHAT YOU SAY FOR THIS?
5)

First of all ,In advaita we say shivoham,not as “Parvathi pathi”….we say
shiva shivoham here shiva means supreme knowledge or supreme
consciousnesses….that is it……..that means we are supreme consioussness…not
parvathi’s husband
In dvaita hari means “lakshmi ‘s husband,shiva means “parvathi’s
husband”…..this is childish…..and bakwas
If you ask a donkey…how is god…it says god is beautiful donkey …similarly
madhvacharya says hari as a beautiful sarvothama lakshmi ‘s husband hari……

Dvaita is full of childish stories..

Please answer for this…..

1)ok….forget science….let us take you yourself given local example
Milk….it is one jada,curd is another jada,,,,they have different
prakruthika guna…..if milk and curd are different by absolute as said by
madhvacharya….milk should never become curd…..
but milk…become curd,ghee,butter milk…etc…here the prakruthika gunas of
milk (jada)changes to the prakruthika gunas of ghee,curd etc….hence…there
cannot be jada-jada beda by absolute as said by madhvacharya…
2)dress…perishes by time(kumbaagutthade)….here dress looses its prakruthika
guna bala (strength)…by time…so strength is not guna of jada…
3)when you burn your dress,the dress looses all its prakruthika gunas like
colour,smoothness and become ashe,if you go on thinking like that…then
there is no jada-jada beda…….as jada’s prakruthika guna changes…
so what is the guna of jada…which makes it different from other jada,,,by
absolute?
if jada-jada beda is absolute as said by madhvacharya prakruthika gunas of
jada should never change as,he says prakruthika gunas of jada are of it’s
own swarupa…and it will never change…
3)one person having a thumb print in one janma,will have another thum print
in another janma…so there are not athman’s attribute…. one leave of the
same tree…will not be like that…after a day…it will be grown old like big
in size,change colour to yellow…etc….so there are not the gunas of jaga…if
you go in thinking like that…a jada will be different from it self after a
period of time….so quality changes with time…
4) similary kama,physical appearance,thinking changes from janma to janma
..so there are not athman’s guna…so athman is nirguna…so prakruthika gunas
like rajasa,tamasa,sathvika are not athman’s guna…so athman is nirguna…..

what you say for this sir?
