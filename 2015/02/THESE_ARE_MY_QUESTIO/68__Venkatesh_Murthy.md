Namaste

There are two extreme positions. Advaita says everything is One. Dvaita
says Multiplicity is Permanent. Advaita can accept Dvaita as Vyavaharika
Satya and MOVE ON. It is not the Ultimate Reality but we can compromise and
say it is only Provisional. In daily life we are seeing Dvaita only. This
type of Compromise is not there from Dvaita Side. This is the Problem. They
cannot compromise. Because if they compromise the entire Dvaita system is
destroyed. The basic building block of Dvaita is Bheda from beginning to
end. There is no scope for Unified Reality.

But there is a scope for Unified Reality in Visistadvaita. They say all
this is One reality - the Saguna Brahma. All this is a Single Reality
Saguna Brahma with Cit and Acit as Viseshas. Ishwara has both Jagat and
Jeevas as His Body. He is the Soul and they are the Body. There is only One
Reality. They call it as Qualified Nondualism.

Someone wrote a book from Dvaita side and said even in Dvaita we can have a
Single Reality. Ishwara is Svatantra Satya. He is Independent. But Jagat
and Jeevas are Paratantra Satya. They are Dependent on Him for existence.
We can say there is only One Svatantra Satya and Paratantra is not as real
as Him because they depend for existence on Him. But many traditional
Dvaitis severely disowned this theory. They cannot compromise to say
Paratantra Satya is LESS real than Svatantra Satya. Both are equally Real.
The Stalemate continues today.

I got some of above information from Satya Darshana show on Chandana TV. It
is on Youtube.
