Then you should ask on some Madhva forum.  This is a list for Advaita 
Vedanta.

Just a small correction; Vallabhacharya lived in the North but he was from 
Andhra Pradesh.  But your large point stands and is worthy of 
contemplation by all.

My view is that it can be useful to study principled objections to Advaita 
Vedanta in order to deepen our own understanding.  And where the 
objections are based on willful or accidental misunderstanding of Advaita 
Vedanta, people like Shri Subrahmanian are doing a yeoman service by 
refuting them.  (Incidently, I think he is right to name the blogs where 
this kind of thing is going on so we can know to avoid them.)

We do not have to give the time of day to scurrilous slander from any 
quarter.  Neither should we stoop to that level.  If I see anymore of that 
here there will be bans.

There are good reasons to avoid such bickering but this is not one of 
them.

Ask him what Evangelicals think of the Pope or what Catholics think of 
Protestants.  Ask him why there almost a thousand different Christian 
sects in the USA alone all with different interpretations of the Bible.

Then ask him why the Pakistani Nobel Physics laureate M. Abdus Salam, the 
only Muslim to achieve that feat, had the word Muslim erased from his 
tombstone.  (He was an Ahmaddiya who Sunnis and Shi'ites consider 
heretical.)  Ask why Sunnis and Shi'ites are massacring each other across 
the Middle East.

It is due to a lack of familiarity with other religions that we think we 
are the only ones prone to sectarianism.  In fact our type is pretty mild.

Different darshans and sampradayas have always engaged in polemics against 
each other.  To stop now because we keep looking over our shoulders at 
what other people ar doing is to give outside unwarranted power over us. 
No all we need to do is make sure when we debate we are doing it with 
satyartha and not vitanda.
