Namaste,

We people fight like this whereas christians & muslims laugh 
at this fight who are taking advantage. 

My Christian colleague who follows this forum silently
in home makes fun of we people who fight on petty issues
regarding which God (shiva / vishnu) is great !!

Does anybody has the guts to stand before Zakir Naik
and challenge that our hinduism is the source of all 
religions.  This guy challenges us and says that 
"Allah is the only god and Islam is the only religion"

Just think over it before fighting over the issues of
dvaita, v.advaita & advaita.

Ultimately, all differences come to an end in
graveyard and all the bodies of jivas are reduced
to ashes.  And this is place where Lord Shiva stays and 
besmears Himself with the ashes just just to point 
out we fools that the Ultimate Reality is beyond all "isms" 

I am sick of all this nonsense over petty quarrels
whereas on hand mass christian conversions
are going on and on other Islam is conquering the
world with their ideology called Jihad.

regs,
sriram
