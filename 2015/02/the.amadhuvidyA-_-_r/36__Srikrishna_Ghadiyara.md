Om!
1. I did not say, talking about 'Madhu Vidya' , as per Sankara Bhashya, is not pertinent to this list. Did I say?2. When 'useless' discussions are started by beginners or other misguided people, we can tolerate, with the thinking that they are still learning. But, should we allow the same attitude from the 'scholars' who know the tradition?3. It is OK, even if the references are of general nature, referring to other schools of non-Advaita Vedanta, if it elucidates what is said in Sankara Bhashya.4. It is not OK, as per tradition, to refer to the followers of other schools "by name", as it does not serve any purpose. Surely one can state and refute other schools of thought, as it has been done in the traditional bhashyas.5. For refuting other schools, it is not necessary to list every other website, and link that we come across, on THIS list. Where is the end to this?6. The opinion of the Visishta-Advaita and Dvaita schools is well known, in these matters. So, specific bloggers names and links to their articles do not serve any purpose, except that they continue this useless Vada, and kutarka.7. If the attempt is sincere, one should post on their blog and solve the problem, and let us know if anyone wins, so we can celebrate.8. I know very well the technique of 'deleting' the mail. I do not need a wise counsel on that matter.9. I want to hear much more important matters related to, say, 'Madhu Vidya' if some 'wise man' has to share.10. It is not worth the digital space to repeat 'na..astra', and further animosity, which does not serve any purpose
Om! Sham!
Srikrishna

I also appreciate such postings as it helps in understanding Advaita.
