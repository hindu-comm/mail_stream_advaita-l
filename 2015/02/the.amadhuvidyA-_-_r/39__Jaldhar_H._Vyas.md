K. Narayanaswami Aiyer wrote a book a long time back called "The 32 
Vidyas" published by the Theosophical Society's Adyar Library.  It is 
marred a bit by Theosophical nonsense but follows Advaita Vedanta for the 
most part.  At the very least it can guide you to the relevant sections of 
the upanishads and bhashyas.

Parayana won't do you any good though.  These vidyas (unless you are 
talking about the 10 mahavidyas of tantra which are something else 
altogether.) are not mantras to be recited but portions of the shruti 
which describe upasana on Brahman in various forms.

For instance this madhuvidya is found in chandogyopanishad 3.1-11.  It 
explains how the Sun is madhu and procedes to equate the Vedas, Devas, and 
directions etc. with that same madhu.  It itself is based on the three rks 
madhu vAta R^itAyate... (which if you do panchayata puja you probably know 
from the pa~nchAmR^itasnAna vidhi.)
