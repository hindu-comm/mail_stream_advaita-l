Thanks. I did get from your older email that the yajus is ekAgni (I am
guessing that is what you meant by "single homa"). I was just curious
(didn't strike me at that time) why there would be a question of following
shrauta or smArta homa vidhAna - tretAgni vs ekAgni, if the Rik and sAma
samhitA homsas were ekAgni to begin with.

In any case, I have never seen/heard of this in the Tamil Nadu area. I am
going to try to get the books.
