Namaste

The same author is attacking Adi Sankara and Sri V. Subrahmanian's blog in
this article -

http://creative.sulekha.com/a-critique-of-advaita-s-upadhi_472905_blog

It is on Upadhi in Advaita. We say One Brahman becomes many by Upadhi. The
Upadhi is Ajnana itself. The Ajnana is also false.

I kindly request Sri Subrahmanian to answer this because the Critique
Author is questioning his blog.
