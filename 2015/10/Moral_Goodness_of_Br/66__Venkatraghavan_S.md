I was recently reading this passage from Shankara BhAshyam of the Gita
verse 4.25, which can be considered in the context of Prof Lance Nelson's
question.

In explaining the symbolic oblation of jIvAtma into the para brahma agni
(jnAna yagya), which occurs in the second line of the verse, AcharyAl
describes Brahman as follows:

ब्रह्माग्नौ "सत्यं ज्ञानमनन्तं ब्रह्म", "विज्ञानमानन्दं ब्रह्म",
"यत्साक्षादपरोक्षाद् ब्रह्म य आत्मा सर्वांतरः" इत्यादि वचनोक्तम् अशनायादि
सर्वसंसारधर्मवर्जितम्, नेति नेति इति निरस्ताशेषविशेषं ब्रह्मशब्देन उच्यते ।

Here, AchArya's use of निरस्ताशेषविशेषं is pertinent , because he is
describing para brahman as being beyond *any* visheshaNAs, or attributes,
and arrived at by the "not this, not this" means of enquiry. It
consequently follows that such a nirguNa para brahman would be beyond good
and evil too, which are after all, only attributes.

I am deliberately not using his सर्वसंसारधर्मवर्जितं adjective in the same
quote here, because by qualifying it by अशनायादि, I believe AchArya is in
fact referring to a Kahola BrAhmaNam quote (Br Up 3.5.1) which lists the
six conditions of samsAra (ashanA, pipAsa, jarA, mrtyu, shoka, moha) - but
the attributes in that context can't be said to include good / evil, but
निरस्ताशेषविशेषं is a more generic term and can therefore be extended to
address Prof. Nelson's specific query.

Regards,
Venkatraghavan
