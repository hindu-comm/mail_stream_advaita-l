Very nice thoughts from Lance Nelson.  What immediately comes to mind is
the famous mantra of the Kathopanishad, pl. see reference in the book:

anyatra dharmāt anyatra adharmāt ...

This is an excellent definition of the Upanishadic Brahman coming from
Nachiketas as a question, which surpasses even the reply Yama gives.
Nachiketas seeks to know of that Brahman which is beyond dharma and
adharma, beyond cause and effect and beyond Time.  So, here we have Brahman
presented as the Truth that transcends all dualities, notions, such as good
and evil, cause-effect, etc.

The BG famous verse: sarva dharmān parityajya...of the 18th ch. too is of
the above nature.  Shankara says there: one must rise above both dharma and
adharma to seek the Ultimate Truth.  Adhering to dharma and eschewing
adharma is the path that prepares one to launch oneself into the Supreme by
transcending the notions of dharma and adharma.

We get the above purport in the Mandukya 7th mantra too.  It is a fine
presentation of the Vedantic Brahman that transcends all three states, the
three worlds, their contents, obviously dharma-adharma.

Others can give more references.
