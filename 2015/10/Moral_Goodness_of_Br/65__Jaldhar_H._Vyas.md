I think not.  See below.

One pertinent text that comes to mind about Brahmans intrinsic goodness is 
kenopaniShada III.2 and onwards.  which begins by recounting how Brahman 
caused the devas to overcome the asuras.  The Devas ignorantly claimed the 
victory as their own so Brahman in the form of a yakSha humbled them and 
then in the form of umA HaimavatI taught indra the brahmavidyA.

On III.2.1, shankaracharya's padbhAshya explains vijagye etc. as:

vijagye jayaM labhavaddevAnAmasurANAM cha s~NgrAme.asurA~njitvA 
jagadarAtInIshvarasetubhettR^iR^in devebhyo jayaM tatphalaM cha 
prAyachchhajjagataH sthemne |

Brahman favors the Devas against the Asuras who are enemies of the world 
and violate Ishvaras dharma. This favoritism is for the protection of the 
world.  So you could say that Brahman is good in the sense that It prefers 
life and the creation and laws over their opposites.

But the reference to Uma mata shows a problem in the way your question is 
formulated.  As I'm sure you well know Brahman and Ishvar are not two 
separate entities but the same Brahman viewed as saguna or nirguna.  It 
makes sense to talk about a saguna entity as good or evil but when talking 
about a nirguna one what does that even mean?  Even in the phenomenal 
realm, can a rainfall or a volcano be called good or evil?  These are 
words that only make sense for embodied beings no?
