These are talking about dharma i.e. vidhi and nishedha.  Is there a 
goodness that goes beyond dharma?  Bhagavan says it in the Gita shloka you 
cite.  sharana in him is higher.  Why would that be?  Because the Brahman 
of which an amSha descended as Krishna Bhagavan is basically good.

I think most Hindus are more Mimamsaka than Vedantin in this regard.  From 
childhood I have heard (in Gujarati) "pApa lAgashe" (sin will "attach") or 
"puNya maLashe" (merit will accrue) in terms of good and bad actions only. 
Not a sense of an abstract cosmic good or evil.
