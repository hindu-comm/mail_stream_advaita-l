I would like to share my latest article on Idol-Worship (Murti Puja), its
meaning, significance and fallacies in the criticisms made against it.

Part 2- Fallacies in Criticism of Idol Worship-
http://www.newsgram.com/fallacies-in-criticism-of-idol-worship/

I have used few quotes from "The Dance of Shiva" by Ananda Coomaraswamy.
