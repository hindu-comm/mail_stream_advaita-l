Namaste, all,

It is indeed sad to hear respected Sastriji's leaving behind his mortal
coil. I hope he lived his final days comfortably.

I am sure his clear Vedantic works shared online on his website and
elsewhere will keep on helping many a people for several decades. I was
thinking of Sastriji a couple weeks back, while reading many of his
articles and also a much cherished mail that he sent me once!

My prayers for his highest goal, which is talked of as सा काष्ठा सा परा
गतिः।

Kind rgds,
--Praveen R. Bhat
