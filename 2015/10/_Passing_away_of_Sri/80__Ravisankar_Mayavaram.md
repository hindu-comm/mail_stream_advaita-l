Contributions to advaita vedAnta literature by Sri S. N. Sastri mahodaya 
will  be gratefully remembered. I have read two of his works: one, 
adhyAsa bhAShya (based on lectures by Sri MDS) and other, his precise 
translation of Sri R. Krishnamoorthy Sastrigal's PhD dissertation on 
iShTa siddhi vivaraNam.  Original text of the book was at least at the 
level I can understand in depth, that really helped me appreciate the 
precision of Sri S. N. Sastri mahodaya's translation.  It is not easy to 
write translations that are brief, precise, and clear, in addition  that 
closely follows the original text.  I think lot of other works by him 
are available online. Hope we collect them all in a place where it will 
be preserved for the  future generations to read.

I did meet him once in Chennai and will gratefully remember his kindness.

Ravi

I would very much like if that work can becompleted and offer it in dedication to  Pujya Sastriji. I appreciate if Pranipataji and/or Subbjuji or anyone else can undertake that job in honor of Pujya Sasriji and complete it for publication.
