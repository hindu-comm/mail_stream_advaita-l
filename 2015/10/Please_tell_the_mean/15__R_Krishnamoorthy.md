Dear
The Lord says in the sloka that Arjuna should be free from the three gunas.
Also to be free from the pairs of opposites like heat cold pleasure pain
etc. Further tells him to be free from acquisition of worldly objects and
their preservation. Arjuna is further advised to be in sattva and be
conscious of the Athman. There seems to be a contradiction as after saying
be free from the three gunas why sattva is recommended.
Free is used to emphasise that the ever preponderance of one guna over the
other in life cycle is to be avoided. But sattva is preferable.
R. KRISHAMOORTHY.
