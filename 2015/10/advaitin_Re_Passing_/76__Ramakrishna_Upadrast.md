praNAmams to All,

parama pUjya brahma shrii Sastri-ji's passing aways indeed a deep personal
loss to all of us advaita community.

It was due to His early encouragement and kind words that beginners like me
started reading more about advaita and samskritam. His presence in the
advaita lists was like the beacon light which guided the list and the
participants in times of conflicting arguments. In course of the sea of
arguments/counter-arguments in the advaita list, His supporting words for
beginners made them climb onto a self-confidence boat and continue with
their svaadhyaaya. His resoluteness in the advaita-vedaanta-sampradaya
tradition was enough for youngsters to take it as pramANa, rather than
reading too much of unconventional interpretations of bhagavadpaada's
bhAShya-'s.

There are too many instances when his personal mails showed deep affection
(vAtsalya-bhAva) and appreciation to individual members. His emphasis on
inculcating bhakti towards the Ishvara, which is an easy means of
liberation was important to many youngsters
(shreyo-maargeShu-bhaktaavadhika bahumatiH: naaraayaNIyaM 91.5) who were
trying to tackle the difficulty of the unmanifest form (avykata-te-svarUpaM
duradhigamatamaM: naaraayaNIyaM 99.10).

I personally feel my great fortune to have received many such mails over
the course of years. Whether I was contributing to the list or not, he was
one of the praatasmaraNiya guru-'s to be remembered, particularly on days
like guru-paurNami. When I was doing my svaadhyaaya in
veda/vedanta/samskritam, his encouraging words helped in whatever little
progress I made. Even in troubled personal times, when I mailed him just to
say sAShTang praNAmams, his reply was full of affection and love even to
the extent of calling me his grandson.

It is not at all a surprise that such a kriShNa-bhaka would leave his
mortal coil on a day as auspicious as Ashvayuja-paurNami. I am sure that he
is enjoying his parama-aananda-sandoha-lakShmIM (nArAyaNIyaM 100.10)
leaving us with his beautiful translations and memories.

namaskaarams to All,
Ramakrishna
