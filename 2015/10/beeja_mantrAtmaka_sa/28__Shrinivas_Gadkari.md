Dear Sriram,

Navaratri greetings. I browsed through the e-book on "beeja-mantrAtmaka-sapthasathi".
While I am certain that most of the content in the book is far too advanced for someone
like me. One thing that I found odd and may be you can voice your opinion on is:

The author has associated
vak-bhAva bIja with mahA kAli
and kAma bIja with mahA sarasvati.

Shouldn't this be the other way round?
kAma bIja relates to mahA kAli
vak-bhAva bIja relates to mahA sarasvati

My underlying assumption here is: The three bIja mantras in the nava varna mantra must be 
explained in detail in the three charitras of durga saptashati (one bIja in each charitra).

With regards,
Shrinivas Gadkari----

Namaste, 

Many people are asking me offline regarding the availability of a tAntrik work "beeja-mantrAtmaka-sapthasathi". 
The e-book of the same published by Chawkhamba can be downloaded from the below link:
