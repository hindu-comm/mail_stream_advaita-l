THE CHANDI NAVAKSHARI MANTRA AND ITS INTERPRETATION

The Nine-lettered Mantra (AIM HIM KLIM CHAAMUNDAI VICCHE) is the 
sound body of Chandika Parameshwari composed of 9 Durgas (Nava Durga Rupini).  
The Devi Atharvasirsa Upanishad proclaims this mantra and extols this as giver of 
highest delight (“Mahad Ananda dayakah”).  The great shakta Bhaskararaya Makhi 
says that this mantra gives final liberation “Brahma Sayujya Pradah”.  

AIM : The Bija of Mahakali
HRIM : The Bija of Mahalakshmi
KLIM : The Bija of Mahasaraswathi

Though the Kali bija is KLIM, here it is given as AIM.  Though the Lakshmi bija is 
SRIM, here it is given as HRIM; Though the Saraswathi bija is AIM, it is given 
here as KLIM. So, as per the 3 Charitas / Cycles in Sapthasathi, 
it should have been KLIM, SRIM, AIM.  But it is not so. 

Whereas, the deities of 3 Charitas are Mahakali, Mahalakshmi and 
Maharaswathi that are entirely different aspects. 

Mahakali is Prakasa Swarupa which is an aspect of Sattva Guna.  
Therefore, AIM bija stands for Prakasa (Illumination).  This is “Chit” aspect of Brahman.  

Mahalakshmi is Kriya Swarupa which is an aspect of Rajo Guna.  
Therefore, HRIM bija stands for Kriya.  This is “Sat” aspect of Brahman.

Mahasaraswathi is Sthiti / Nirodha / Ananda Rupa that holds back both 
Prakasa and Kriya which is an aspect of Tamo Guna.  
Therefore, KLIM bija stands for Nirodha.  
This is “Ananda” aspect of Brahman.  

1st Interpretation of Navakshari :

CHAAMUNDA is the Cosmic Power of Brahman which is Para Shakti. 
 “Chamati – atthi, sarvam charaacharam iti Chamuh” ie., 
All the principles of creation at the time of dissolution is Chamuh. 
 “daati (laati)” is the act of devouring or swallowing.  So, Chaamunda is the Supreme Cosmic Power that devours the entire creation at the time of dissolution.  

VICCHE denotes the act of Salutation.  So, the 1st interpretation is :

“Salutations to the all devouring cosmic power Chaamunda 
that is the samasti rupa (integrated form) of Mahakali, Mahalakshmi and Mahasaraswathi”

2nd Interpretation of Navakshari

“Vit Chinoti iti Vicche” ie., bestower of supreme knowledge (Vit). 
This would become:

“Prostrations to Mahakali, Mahalakshmi, Mahasaraswathi Swarupa Chamunda – the bestower of Supreme Knowledge (Brahma Jnana)”

3rd Interpretation of Navakshari

CHAAMUNDA stands of Brahma Vidya.
VICCHE is VIT+CHA+E.  VIT stands for Chit aspect of Brahman; 
CHA stands for Sat aspect of Brahman and E stands for Ananda aspect of Brahman.  So, this would become:

“May we meditate on Chit rupa Mahakali; Sat rupa Mahalakshmi; 
Ananda rupa Mahasaraswathi in our heart for Brahma Vidya”.

4th Interpretation of Navakshari

AIM, HRIM, KLIM = Brahma (Brahma Vachaka or Supreme Consciousness);
CHA = Jiva is (Jiva vachaka – Individual Consciousness)
AMUNDA = Non-different (Abheda swarupa)
AI = Thus, we know to be 
VICCHE = Advaita Jnanaprade; Chit Sat Ananda Rupini

This means:

“May we know the Chit Sat Ananda rupa Brahma who is 
Chandi to be non-different from Jiva”

The “Tat Tvam Asi” mahaavaakya is indicated here.  
The Navakshari when chanted with this bhavana grants the 
sadhaka the final union with Brahman – the Knowledge, Existence and Bliss Absolute.
