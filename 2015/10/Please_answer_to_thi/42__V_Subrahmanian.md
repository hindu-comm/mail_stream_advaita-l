Dear Sri Ryan,

In Hnduism there is the concept of 'chiranjÄ«vi' = those who do not die for
a very long time.  In that list Vyasa is included:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chiranjivi

The extant Puranas <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purana>, the Ramayana
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramayana>, and the Mahabharata
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahabharata> describe seven long lived
personalities in the Hindu pantheon
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindu_pantheon>. Each represents a different
attribute of man, which as long as they live, will exist amongst humanity.
[2] <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chiranjivi#cite_note-Paryatanam-2>
"Ashwatthama Balir Vyaso Hanumanash cha Vibhishana Krupacharya cha
Parashuramam Saptaita Chiranjeevanam" - 'Ashwathama, King Mahabali, Vyasa,
Hanuman, Vibhishana, Kripacharya and Parashurama are the seven
death-defying or imperishable personalities '.

They can make themselves visible only to those whom they choose to.  They
can travel to any location with ease.  In this manner the Shankara Vijaya
episode says that Vyasa visited Shankara.  You may read the complete
episode elsewhere.
