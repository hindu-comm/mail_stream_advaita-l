Sri Harsha,
What difference does it possibly make? Whether someone wins a debate or
not, how is that going to help?

I for one am not a historian, so I cannot say who won, or even if a debate
took place, but frankly I don't care.

However one thing is for sure - it is absolutely evident that advaita
siddhAnta stems directly from shruti. Therefore, even if some clever person
wins a debate today, someone cleverer can come tomorrow to disprove him,
but as long as his siddhAnta is at odds with vedA it cannot be right.

However, a shruti based siddhAnta can never be disproved, because of the
very fact that it comes from the VedA.

Therefore I'm not so interested to know the history of the debate, what I'm
concerned with is to understand the shruti established advaita siddhAnta
correctly.

Regards,
Venkatraghavan
