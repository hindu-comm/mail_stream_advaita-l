Sri Sadananda Ji,

Sri Bhagavatpada also uses Mukhya Samaanaadhikaranam apart from Badha
Samaanaadhikaranam
to explain tat tvam asi by way of the classic illustration of Ghatakasha
and Mahakasha. Just a passing observation.

I have heard Sri Paramarthananda Swamiji discuss Samaanaadhikaranam in some
other context , not the one you have mentioned. I think he covered both the
above  in that context under the fourth category by calling it Lakshya
Lakshana  Samaanaadhikaranam. I am recalling from memory and could be
wrong. But an interesting point he made was that one scholar has listed as
many as sixteen types of Samaanaadhikaranams  and that he ( Sri SP ) was
only covering four of them in the talk. Just as supplementary info.

Regards and Pranams

   .
