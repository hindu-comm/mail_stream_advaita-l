Dear Sri Sundaram,

Actually what one thinks is 'doctrinal' is only a prakriyā for Advaitins.
The entire Vedanta shāstra is a means, a prakriyā, to realize the Absolute
Truth, Brahman. One might say that the creation delineated in the
Veda/Upanishad is a doctrinal aspect.  But according to Gaudapadacharya
these creation shrutis are only 'upāya', means, to know the
Creator-consciousness.  Whatever is told about the jiva, avidya, karma,
shravana, vairagya, etc. is a means. My Acharya used to say: a prakriyā is
a pratikalpanā.  Since we have a svābhāvika kalpanā about what we are, what
the world is, etc., the shāstra comes to remove that kalpana through a
counter-kalpana.  That is called a prakriyā.  When the original kalpana
goes, with it goes the pratikalpanā too.  That is the meaning of
adhyāropa-apavāda nyāya.

If various Acharyas offer various 'views', sometimes appearing to be
contradicting, still those views are only pratikalpanas.  For, even in the
case of the Bhamati-Vivarana duo, the ultimate reality is not anything but
the Advaitic Brahman and the jiva is not any different from Brahman and the
world is not anything but, mithyā; in truth Brahman.

In fact there are those who hold that the three schools of Advaita, Dvaita,
etc. are also only prakriyas addressed to remove the various kinds of
kalpanas.

warm regards
