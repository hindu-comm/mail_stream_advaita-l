To my knowledge Sri Vidyaranya has not said anything like that.  In fact in
the Sarvadarshana sangraha the Madhva system is presented as 'Poornaprajna
darshanam'.

To get a good idea about the above please read the three Kannada books of
Sri G.R.Patil of Dharwad:

1. Akshobhya vijaya vibhrama

2. Vidyaranya vishayaka ākṣepa nirāsa

3. Sri Vidyaranya Vijaya Dundubhi

The first two books are out of stock/print.  You may request the author
personally. The last one is available in Bangalore at Vidya Bharati Press,
Shankara Maṭha Road.
