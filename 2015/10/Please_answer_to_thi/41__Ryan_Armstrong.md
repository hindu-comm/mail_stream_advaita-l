namaskara
I admit up front that I do not have the knowledge to answer this...but I am
confused by this question.
By vedavyasa, does the madhva pandith mean vyasa, father of sri shuka and
also author of mahAbharata, srimad bhagavata etc?
If so, it must be noted that he was a contemporary of sri krsna and arjuna
(actually he was arjuna's biological grandfather.)
But Adi shankara lived during the 8th/9th century AD according to the
modern calendar.


Whilst I am aware that the live span of the great seers far exceeds the
ordinary man, I was not aware that vedavyasa was known to be alive at the
time of Adi shankara.
That would have been about 400 years after the great battle of kurukshetra.
Is there another saint by the same name that I am confusing him with?

Yours in Truth
Ryan
