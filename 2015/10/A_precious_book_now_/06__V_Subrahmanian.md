Namaste

H.H. Jagadguru Sri Abhinava Vidyatheertha Mahaswamiji, the 35th pontiff of
Sri Sringeri Sharada Peetham, was an authority on the scriptures, a
peerless Yogin, and a consummate Jivanmukta.  The book, "Yoga,
Enlightenment and Perfection" contains a detailed account of His Holiness’s
spiritual practices and His realization of and steadfast establishment in
the Supreme; the book also serves an authoritative exposition of Yoga,
Bhakti, and Vedanta.

While each chapter of the book deals with one or the other spiritual
sādhana like karma yoga or saguṇa-dhyāna,  the ones that contain details of
manana (intense reflection on the Self) and nididhyāsana (steadfast focus
on the Self) done by the Achārya need a special mention. The book will
immensely benefit spiritual seekers.

Sri Vidyatheertha Foundation has brought out a free digital version of this
precious book both (PDF and EPUB) for the benefit of all spiritual
aspirants and it can be downloaded from
