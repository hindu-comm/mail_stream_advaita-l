Namaskara,

I'm reading a book on the history of dvaita vedanta by BNK Sharma and he
says that Sri Gaudapadacharya didn't comment on Brahma sutras because the
sutras are "realist" in nature. Obviously biased, but what is the advaita
position on the reason he didn't comment on them? Has he mentioned them at
all?

- Santosh.
