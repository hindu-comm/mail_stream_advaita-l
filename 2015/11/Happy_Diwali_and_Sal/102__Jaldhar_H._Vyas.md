Wishing all advaita-l readers a happy Diwali and Gujarati new year 
(Vikram Samvat 2072 called Plavanga.)

Owing to the nature of the luni-solar calendar, in the Americas, Diwali is 
actually today (Tuesday.) and tomorrow (Wednesday) in India and the rest 
of the world.  Though most people being unfamiliar with the fine points of 
jyotisha and dharmashastras will just follow the Indian date.  The new 
year is on Thursday all over the world.

Regardless of when you celebrate, may the upcoming year bring you much 
progress in artha, kama, dharma and most of all, moksha.
