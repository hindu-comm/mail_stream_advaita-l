The ironic thing is that Hindus love to talk about having "the most 
scientific religion" when it is some gibberish about quantam physics yet 
here in panchanga ganita is a case where actual science is to be used and

astronomical observations instead of the mathematical model of 
suryasiddhanta-based ones.)
