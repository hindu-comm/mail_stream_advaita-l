Sal Mubarak Jaldhar Bhai! 
Agree, most temples in USA mark Wed Nov 11, 2015 as Diwali but Amavaas tithi ends Nov 11 am. Per mypanchang.com and Drikpanchang website, In USA, Diwali puja should occur on Nov 10 sanyankaal.

I notice that Swaminarayan temples , in general, are a day off, i.e., it appears they follow panchang as per India.

One would think purohits in our mandirs ( whether North, South, Gujarati, or Bengali) would know better and advise accordingly.

Though most people being unfamiliar with the fine points of jyotisha and dharmashastras will just follow the Indian date.  The new year is on Thursday all over the world.
