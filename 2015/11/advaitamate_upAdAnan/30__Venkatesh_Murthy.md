 Namaste Yativara श्रीमल्ललितालालित

But the Bhedaabhedavaadi Bhaskaracharya has said this in Brahma Sutra
Bhashya 1 - 4 - 25 आत्मकृतेः परिणामात्  -

सूत्रकारः श्रुत्यनुकारी परिणामपक्षं सूत्रयांबभूव अयमेव छान्दोग्ये
वाक्यकारवृत्तिकाराभ्यां सम्प्रदायमतः समाश्रितः । परिणामस्तु स्याद्
दध्यादिवदिति

The Sutrakaara Baadarayana has followed Sruti and given the Parinaama
Vaada in the Brahma Sutras. The Vaakyakaara Tanka and Vruttikaara
Bodhaayana accepted that Sampradaaya in the Chandogya Upanishad
commentary. They accepted Parinaama Vaada. It is saying Brahman is
transformed to Jagat like milk is changed to curds. Brahman is really
becoming the World.

Parinaama Vaada is different than Adi Sankara's Vivarta Vaada. In
Vivarta Vaada Brahman is appearing like the World like rope is
appearing like a snake. The rope is not a real snake but with Maayaa's
help it appears like a snake. In Parinaama Vaada there is no place for
Maayaa.

If both Tanka and Bodhaayana have accepted Parinaama Vaada
automatically it means they rejected Maayaa.

The Bhaashyakaara Bhaaskaracharya is making this comment against Advaitis

विगीतं विच्छिन्नमूलं माहायानिकबौद्धगन्धितं मायावादं मायावादिनो
व्यावर्णयन्तो लोकान् व्यामोहयन्ति ।
The Maayaavaadis are explaining the Bauddha influenced contradictory
Maayaavaada and confusing people.

Raamaanuja has taken the same Bhedaabheda from Bhaaskara but instead
of giving credit he has written criticisim for the same in his
Bhashya. For Jagadupadaana Kaaranatva of Brahman they give some
Chandogya Vaakyas - यथा सौम्य एकेन मृत्पिण्डेन, यथा सौम्य एकेन
लोहमणिना and Mundaka Upanishad यद् भूतयोनिम्.
