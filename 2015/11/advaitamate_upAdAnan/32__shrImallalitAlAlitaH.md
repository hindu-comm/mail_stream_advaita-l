I understand that you are trying to say that advaita matam is not accepted
by vRttikAra(s).
I don't have a problem if vRttikAra doesn't accept that, because I

If you have to discuss anything in this thread, please discuss correctness
and opposite of the definition in this thread.
for any distantly related questions, please create a new thread.
