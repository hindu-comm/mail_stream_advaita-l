Logged in to yahoo after a brief hiatus & truly saddened to hear about the passing away of two of the giants of this e-group - Shri Shastriji & Shri Pranipataji
My prayers to the departed souls that they bless us, and to Ishwara that their souls find mergence with the Absolute ere long. 
A palpable sense of loss is coupled with a reminder, if one was ever we needed, of the fragility of human life, and a rededication to our own sadhana given the severely limited time we all have to fully & most optimally utilize this rare human birth
Pranams to all 
Hari OM
Shyam
