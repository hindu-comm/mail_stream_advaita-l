Hari om.

This is to inform you about a sad news.

Br. Pranipataji has passed away yesterday morning due to massive heart
attack at the ashram around 5a.m.
The final rites will be done here in coonur today around 10a.m.
Kindly pray for the departed soul.
This mail is coming you from the kothagiri ashram.
Since your mail address was sent to me during the month of May regarding
your contribution for ratha yatra book in Tamil I got your mail.


In the service of The Lord
Shridharananda
ALERT AND VIGILANT LIVING IS SADHANA.
