Pranams,
Agree. For us, it is either sadgati or as Jaldhar bhai has said, one
attains brahmaloka to later merge in non-dual brahman. Third option is by
God's grace, this death (dropping body) is the last death if one holds on
to brahmabhAvanA at the time of living body. There is no rebirth. Best
would be to say 'this birth is last birth'. Such a person is jivanmukta.

Hari OM
