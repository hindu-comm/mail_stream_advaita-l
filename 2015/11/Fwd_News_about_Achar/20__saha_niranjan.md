Namaste!
Hari om!
What a great loss! While the learned members were thinking of entrusting completing the late S.N.Sastriji's unfinished works to him, he suddenly left us.In response to my query for a copy of Mahadev Gangadahar Bakre's edition of Siddhantabindu, he sent me his own copy, which I've kept with me as his blessings and prasadam.

Sincerely,Niranjan Saha

Hari om.

This is to inform you about a sad news.

attack at the ashram around 5a.m.
The final rites will be done here in coonur today around 10a.m.
Kindly pray for the departed soul.
This mail is coming you from the kothagiri ashram.

your contribution for ratha yatra book in Tamil I got your mail.


In the service of The Lord
Shridharananda
ALERT AND VIGILANT LIVING IS SADHANA.
