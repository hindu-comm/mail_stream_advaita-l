Of course I understand the spirit in which Shri Krishnamoorthy wrote this 
but I think it is worth pointing out that for us having the soul "rest in 
peace" is not something to be desired.  The Christians believe that the 
dead believers are resting in their graves until such time as the Messiah 
will return and ressurect them.  We on the other believe that the atma 
transitions endlessly into many different names and forms propelled by the 
power of its good or bad actions.  There is no time for rest!  One who 
understands the nature of samsara can overcome it through Advaita Vedanta. 
For such a person who knows that what he thought of as "his" atma is the 
only, eternally existant paramatma there is no return to samsara.  Even 
the one who tries this but fails to achieve mukti in this lifetime will 
not return but have ample opportunity to perfect himself in the 
Brahmaloka.
