PraNAms to everybody. 
--------------------------------

Webcasting of Pachadashi of Shree Vidyaranya will be done starting from today Nov. 2nd 2015 on behalf of Advaita Academy. One can listen on line â€“ from 9:30AM IST( or as soon as the webcasting system is ready). Plans are to do two talks everyday each around 40 min. We have already done chapters of Pancadashi some (from Ch. 2 to half of Ch. 6) and the talks are available on yu-tube under Acharya Sadaji or at Advaita Academy website. We will be doing the first chapter which was not done before on yu-tube and which is entitled as Tatva Viveka PrakaraNa. 

Pachadashi text is considered as very important text for advaita Vedanta and is a must for a sincere student of Advaita Vedanta. Vidyaranya is around 14th century and comes at a stage when many objections have been raised against Advaita by other philosophers. Hence the text itself addresses many of the objections as puurvapaksha and dismisses them on the basis of scriptural support and logic. 

Panchadashi involves 15 chapters as the title indicates and has been divided into three pancakama or three set of 5 chapters each, essentially corresponding to sat, chit and ananda aspect of the Brahman; they are called Viveka, deepa and ananda pancakams. The first chapter is also an introductory chapter that provides the essence of Advaita Vedanta. The rest of the chapters can be considered as the elaboration of the concepts discussed in the first chapter. Hence First chapter becomes very important for analysis. 

Viveka forms the very first of the four-fold qualifications required for Vedantic study.  Braham cannot be known directly but still can be known by using Viveka or discriminative intellect that can differentiate the eternal from ephemeral. The same way the subject I cannot be known directly but can be understood using Viveka. Vidyaranya starts the very first chapter using anvaya-vyatireka logic to point out the absolute truth underlying the waking, dream and deep-sleep states. These will be elaborated in the talk series with a rational intellect in mind. 

Livesteam talks can be accessed at https://livestream.com/accounts/11128505 or wait until they are uploaded on yu-tube under Acharya Sadaji. 

Hari Om!
