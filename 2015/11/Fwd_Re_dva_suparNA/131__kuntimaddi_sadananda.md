PraNAms.

This may not be directly relavent - in Mundaka - Fist Chapter, first section, Mantra 9 states - 

yaH sarvajnaH sarvavit yasya jnaanamayam tapaH|  

Upanishad uses two words - sarvajnaH and sarva vit - for Iswara. 

Actually both mean the same. Since it is using two words it should designate two different things.  Here sarvajanaH refers to paravidya and sarvavit refers to aparavidya. since the discussion by the teacher started with para and apara vidya or the first one is kaaraNa vidya and the second one refers to kaarya vidya, based on Swami Paramarthanandaji talks.

He refers to Geeta sloka from Ch. 7 - bhuumiraaponalo... as part of apraa vidyaa and the very next sloka - apareyam .. as paraa vidyaa.'

A jiivanmukta can know paraa vidya but cannot and need not have to know all kaarya vidya or the knowledge of whole creation or aparaa vidya. 

Hari Om!
