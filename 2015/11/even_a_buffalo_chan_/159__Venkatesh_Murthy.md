Namaste

Like you said below if Mimamsakas have no respect and belief in
Ishwara the Advaita Vedantis will not agree. In Advaita Vedanta
Ishwara must give Karma Phala. And there are many Advaita Vedantis
doing worship for Ishwara. This belief is there for both Grushasthas
and Sanyasis. Therefore Vyavahare Bhattanayaha is not correct about
Ishwara.

I think in the modern age it is not possible for anybody to be Pure
Mimamsaka. There may be some Agnihotris here and there but they also
cannot do everything like pure Mimamsakas like Soma Yajna every year.
It is very costly firstly. There are not many Vaidikas having
knowledge of Srauta karmas. It has become a vicious circle. There is
no demand for Srauta priests because there are not many Yajnas because
there are not many Srauta priests. The vicious circle will keep on
reducing the number of Srauta karma knowing people.
