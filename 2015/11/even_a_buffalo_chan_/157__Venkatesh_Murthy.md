You said a man cannot mix up relations with mother, sister, wife,
daughter. But here you are mixing up Vyavahara for Gruhasthas and
Sanyasis. You cannot say Sanyasis must also behave like Bhattas and do
lot of Vedic Karmas. Sanyasis are not bound by Karma like Gruhasthas.
Gruhastha must worship his family god and the Panchayatana Devatas.
But a Sanyasi will not have this restriction. Bhatta Nayaha is only
for Gruhasthas.

Sri V. Subrahmanian said -
Does the above wording exist in the Bhāṣyam? I could not find it in a
search of the Advaita Shāradā resource. It could be the sense of the above
maxim that Shankara has said.  In case you are aware of any such instance,
pl. point out.

In Upadesha Panchaka Adi Sankara has said Vedo Nityamadheeyataam
Tadudita Karma Swanushtheeyataam. We have to always study Veda and do
the Karmas given in it. I think from this someone must have concluded
we have to be like Bhattas when we are in Gruhastha Ashrama.
