In the Chandogya upanishad 8th chapter we have the story of Indra (lord of
Devas) and Virochana,(Lord of asuras), both 'sons' of Praj훮pati,
approaching him for knowledge. Prajapati instructs both alike and in the
very first round, Virochana thinks the knowledge Prajapati gave was: body
is the self. He was satisfied with this and went away and spread that
knowledge among asuras.  Indra was not satisfied with the first round
teaching; he returned several times to get more instruction and finally
emerged enlightened in the true Vedantic sense.

Some say that even ch훮rv훮ka darshana is useful in a certain way: they
consider the body only, not the inert objects outside, as the self. From
that stage one can slowly progress going inwards.  Among charv훮kas there
are types: body is the self and senses are self. The latter is better than
the former.  So goes the hierarchy.
