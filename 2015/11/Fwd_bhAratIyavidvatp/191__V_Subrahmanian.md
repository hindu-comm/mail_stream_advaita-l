Subject: {भारतीयविद्वत्परिषत्} Interesting archeological find in Rome
To: भारतीयविद्वत्परिषत् Vidvatparishat <bvparishat at googlegroups.com>


Dear friends,

The following may be of interest to you

http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/italy/12005864/Secret-pagan-basilica-in-Rome-emerges-from-the-shadows-after-2000-years.html

The article includes a painting discovered at the site which immediately
brings to our mind 'dvaa suparnaa sayujaa sakhaayaa' from Rigveda sukta
(1.164) mantras 20, 21 & c. Mantra 20 is also well-known in VEdanta. More
info on the find is needed to definitively make the connection. But the
people supposedly belonging to 'Neopythagoreanism' school of thought who
created these artifacts apparently shared with the VEda the idea of
immortality of human soul, re-birth and union of soul with Divine etc.
There is a  reference mentioning influence of Oriental thought on these
Neopythagoreans. Here is a Wikipedia info -
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neopythagoreanism
