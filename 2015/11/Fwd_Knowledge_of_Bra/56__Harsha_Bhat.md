Subbu Sir,
                               Understood,But this mantra says when second
bird sees the first bird ,it becomes free from misery ...

But this mantra never says that second bird merges with first bird...this
mantra still keeps duality (two birds)..even in moksha..

So,Please can you please elaborate on this..
