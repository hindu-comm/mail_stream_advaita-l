The point is - by linking Moksha with Videhamukti alone, felt some reality
is given to Maya (by the mention - though one is liberated, but one is
still in his body) and as you know, any iota of reality given to (invested
in) Maya or its creations ( Koshas, deha etc), directly or indirectly, will
only remain as an obstacle to attain the firm knowledge in Absolute ( the
only Reality, Sruti mAta declares repeatedly in all Upanishads, whose very
knowledge is liberation, in this very life - sadyo/jIvan mukti )


स वा एष महानज आत्माजरोऽमरोऽमृतोऽभयो ब्रह्म; अभयं वै ब्रह्म; अभयं हि वै
ब्रह्म भवति य एवं वेद ॥ २५ ॥ Br Up 4.4.25

That great, birthless Self is undecaying, immortal, undying, fearless
Brahman (infinite). Brahman is indeed fearless. He who knows It as such
becomes the fearless Brahman.

Thanks for this discussion thread ..it was helpful for my
contemplation...warm regards
