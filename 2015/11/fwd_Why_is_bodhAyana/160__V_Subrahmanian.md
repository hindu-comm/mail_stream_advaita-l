In his book on Indian Philosophy, Hajime Nakamura lists a few names of
Vedantins that preceded Shankara.  See here for the two images containing
those names:

 While we find Shankara referring to the following:

Bhartṛhari, Upavarṣa. [Bodhāyana], Tanka (Brahmanandin),
Dravida,Bhartṛprapancha, Śabaraswāmin, Sundarapāṇḍya and Gaudapada directly
or indirectly in his Bhashyas, it is curious to find that Bodhāyana whom
Viśiṣṭādvaitins claim as the clear evidence for the existence of
pre-Ramanuja school, is not touched upon by Shankara.

In the Bṛhadāraṇyaka upaniṣad bhāsya that 'all Vedantins are unanimous that
the Upanishads hold the identity of the jiva and Brahman.'

Does anyone have explanation for Bodhayana missing from Shankara's works?
