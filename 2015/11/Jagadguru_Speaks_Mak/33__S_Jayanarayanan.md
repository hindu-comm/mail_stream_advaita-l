The Jagadguru Speaks

Make Life Meaningful

Man must make this sacred human birth meaningful. To do that he must conform to a tradition, righteousness, a code of conduct and a set of rituals. That is what distinguishes man from animals.

Without these principles human birth will be wasted. It cannot be definitely said if one will get another birth like this. It depends on one’s karma.

Important among sadhanas are the daily worship of Iswara and reading a portion of the Bhagavad Gita. Rendered by God himself, the Gita will purify the layman as well as the learned. With these habits good thoughts will shine forth in all matters.

Likewise, one must at least once in a lifetime have a dip in the Ganga river and sip a little bit of its water. By that we can expiate many of our sins.

Sri Adi Sankara Bhagavadpada has said that even Yama will not do anything to one who performs such good deeds and worships God with pure thoughts.

भगवद्गीता किञ्चिदधीता गङ्गा जललव कणिकापीता ।
सकृदपि येन मुरारि समर्चा क्रियते तस्य यमेन न चर्चा ॥

Therefore, we bless all to purify their lives by following the path of virtues (sreya marga).
