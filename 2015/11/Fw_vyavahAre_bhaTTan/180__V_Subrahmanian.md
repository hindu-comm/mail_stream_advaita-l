A kind of bias does exist.  It is well known that pūrva mīmāmsā darśanam
does not espouse the cause of Iśvara.  Yet, in the shloka/tantra vārtika
 of Kumarila Bhatta, there is a famous invocation verse:
viśuddha-jñānadehāya trivedī divyachakṣuṣe | śreyaḥprāptinimittāya namaḥ
somārdha-dhāriṇe ||  For this some give a completely karmapara meaning and
some give Śivapara meaning.  A Ramanuja follower scholar denies the
Śivapara meaning and tries a Viśṇupara meaning.
