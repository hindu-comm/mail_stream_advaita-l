Namaste

In Advaita, the term 'chidābhāsa' is generally, widely, used to refer to
the jīva. The term means: reflected consciousness.  Yet, in a very rare
instance, this term is used to refer to Ishvara too.  The Panchadashi
verses  6.156 and 157:

मेघवद्वर्तते माया मेघस्थिततुषारवत् ।
धीवासना*श्चिदाभासस्तु*षारस्थखवत्स्थितः ॥ १५६॥

 मायाधीन*श्चिदाभासः*श्रुतौ मायी महेश्वरः ।
अन्तर्यामी च सर्वज्ञो जगद्योनिः स एव हि ॥ १५७॥

In both the above instances, the word 'chidābhāsa' refers to Ishvara.  The
set of verses there are about the nature of Ishvara.

The Panchadashi holds that both the jiva and Ishvara are only consciousness
basically, and having reflected in different upādhis, attain the different
name/status as jiva (avidyā.antahkaraṇa upādhi) and Ishvara (māyā / avyakta
upādhi).

I brought it to the notice of Advaitins just in order to point out that the
term 'chidābhāsa' is used, though rarely, to refer to Ishvara as well.

Other instances, if noticed by members here, may pl. be brought to light.
