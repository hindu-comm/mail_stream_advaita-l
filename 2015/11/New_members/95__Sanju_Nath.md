Thank you for pasting the link.

However, I have a question while watching Part 2.

Swami Sri Paramananda Bharathi-ji states at 25:00 minute
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd24g3fWqr8  that Advaita understanding has
been extensively damaged by scholars saying that the adhyasa is with the
Turiya.  The correct understanding should be between pratyaga-atma (=
kshtra-jna = gyaata = sushupta atma which is different from Turiya), and
kshetra.

Do the learned members have any comment on the extensive damage done to
Advaita because of this misunderstanding?

Dhanyaavaad,
Sanju
