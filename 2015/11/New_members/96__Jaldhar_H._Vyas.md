Have just begun my studies in Vedic dharma and philosophy and am eager to
get into deeper aspects of learning related to the Sankara school of
thought.

Hari Om,

I am Rajmohan and I am a seeker on the path. I am sure since I am learning
the scriptures, this will be a good place to ask questions and/or get
information on where to find a book/info/clarification(s). Hence the request
to add my name to the list.

Best wishes for this noble venture.
