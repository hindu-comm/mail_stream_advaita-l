Hello,
I presently live in Calgary, Canada, and have been a student of
advaita-vedanta for many years yet still feel as if I'm just at the starting
line. I came across this website when searching for a transliteration of the
Adhyasa Bashya to help me understand a wonderful series of talks on this
text by Paramananda over at the Advaita Academy website.
Namaste to all.
Jill
