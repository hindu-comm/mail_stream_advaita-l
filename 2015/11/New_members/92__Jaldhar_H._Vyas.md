I hail from a vaidik traditional family which is not in the vedik or 
pourohitya profession since two generations. I carry great respect for our 
traditions and broader outlook.Efforts are made to follow our invaluable 
traditions from vedokta tatvardha standpoint.I wish to understand our mantras, 
scriptures and their applications for our customs and culture etc., 
evermore.vedic,scientific and tatwika stand point.Lot of questions prop up 
within me regarding the why and what ..part of some practices with a 
constructive view.
