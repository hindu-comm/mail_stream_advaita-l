 Namaste

It does not matter Appayya won or Vijayendra won. What is modern
Science saying? If there is Scientific support Advaita is correct and
Dvaita is wrong. The below links are saying the Universe is a
Hologram. It is a Projection to 3 Dimensional Space. If Science is
saying the entire Universe is a Hologram it is the same thing Advaita
is saying Universe is a Projection by Vikshepa Sakti of Maayaa.
Advaitis said the same thing Jagan Mithya world is illusion thousand
years back.

All the idiots argued how can the universe be a projection. Now the
Dvaiti idiots have to agree with Science and accept it and become
wise. Otherwise they will continue to be idiots. Dvaitis must and
should agree with Scientists because Dvaitis and Scientists both have
accepted Pratyaksha as the most powerful Pramana. The Scientists
depend on Pratyakhsa only to check results.
