Namaskara,

                I clearly tell my doubt here

  We get the moksha through the knowledge of brahman according to vedas,but

1)Infinite cannot be known by finite.
2)Nirguna can never be known ,because suguna can be known through suguna's
guna,but nirguna can never be known,because he is attribute less.
3)Nirguna cannot have knowledge.As knowledge is also a guna.

So,we never get knowledge of brahman,if brahman is nirguna,in other words
we never get moksha if brahman is nirguna.

regards,

Harsha Bhat
