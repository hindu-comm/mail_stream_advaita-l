Jaldar sir,
                           One interesting point here,

                      According to advaitha in moksha or in  turya
state,there will not be any swarupa jgnana,or knowledge of self  to athman.

So,my question is ,if a person has swarupa jgnana ,then he may get affected
by swarupa-agjnana or (maya).

But one who don't have swarupa jgnana ,(like stone)...will never get
swarupa agnana...

Or in other words maya or avaidhya can never affect nirguna...and make him
feel that he is finite...

So,how you will prove the creation of this world here ...according to
advaitha?


regards,
Harsha Bhat
