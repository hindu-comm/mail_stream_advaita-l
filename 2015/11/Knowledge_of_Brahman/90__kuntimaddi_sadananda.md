Harshaji - PraNAms

I think you just proved my statement. If you want to know more about deep sleep state - please study the article I wrote and posted to this list on - Who slept very well? - that explains whether I am conscious of deep sleep or not. 

Since further discussions not of much help, I would stop here.

Best wishes in your pursuit of truth.

Hari Om!
Sadananda

 Kunthi
 -mathi sir,you said
 Q. Sir, Are you there in the room
 since you said it is too dark that you cannot see
 anything?
 A.
 Of course I know I am there. I do not need light to see
 myself as I am self-revealing to myself! I am aprameyam not
 an object (with gunas) for me to see or to know! I am
 self-existing and self-conscious
 entity.
 But,I am not self-revealing to
 myself when I am in deep sleep no
 sir?...When I am in deep sleep,I
 consciousness is not revealing to myself no sir?...then how
 do you say that I consciousness is self -revealing or swayam
 prakasha?

 Jaldar sir,          
   One interesting point here,    
               
     According to advaitha in moksha or in turya
 state,there will not be any swarupa jgnana,or knowledge of
 self to athman.
 So,my question is ,if a person has
 swarupa jgnana ,then he may get affected by swarupa-agjnana
 or (maya).
 But one who
 don't have swarupa jgnana ,(like stone)...will never get
 swarupa agnana...
 Or
 in other words maya or avaidhya can never affect
 nirguna...and make him feel that he is
 finite...
 So,how you
 will prove the creation of this world here ...according to
 advaitha?

 regards,Harsha
 Bhat

 1)Infinite cannot be known by finite.




 The finite does not actually exist. It only appears to do
 so because of maya.






 2)Nirguna can never be known ,because suguna can be known
 through suguna's

 guna,but nirguna can never be known,because he is attribute
 less.




 As a consequence of 1, when the delusionary gunas are
 negated then what is left is the nirguna brahman.




 3)Nirguna cannot have knowledge.As knowledge is also a
 guna.

 Sorry small change to my third point said above,

 a guna...






 No only the conventional (vyavaharic) knowledge which is
 based on the premise of duality is a guna. From the
 paramarthic standpoint you do not need to "know"
 Brahman because you are and always have been Brahman. Only
 maya deluded you into forgetting that.
