Thank you Subbu sir,
                                              Completely understood,But
please explain dwe suparne mantra,in (Shankara) advaitha point of view.

In dwe suparne matra says even in moksha there are two birds,So,according
to vedas only second bird (Bhudhi) exists even in moksha...

But according to advaitha in paramartha level there is only one reality i:e
brahman and there is no bhudhi...

So,how do you explain dwe suparne matra in advaitha point of view?
