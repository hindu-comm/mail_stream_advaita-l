The Turiya Atman is jnāna svarūpa: ekātma pratyaya sāram - Mandukya 7th
mantra. So, it is verily pure consciousness. The jiva-aspirant only
realizes this to be his true svarupa, thereby giving up the jīvatva
adhyāsa.  So, there is no situation of there is a jiva who has svarupa
jnana in the kaivalya.

This is not possible.  The shruti, Br.up. 1.4.10 only taught 'Brahman, that
did not know its svarupa, acquired that svarupa jnana and became infinite.'
There is no shruti pramana anywhere that once such realization is had,
there is a possibility of a return to samsara.  Shankara has stated this in
the BSB 2.1.14. So, that is the assurance that avidya/ajnāna will not
return. .

This is not also possible.  The jiva, aspirant, who is adhikāri for vedanta
is not a jaḍa.  He has knowledge of his own sentiency; only that he thinks
that sentient entity to be a kartā-bhoktā, endowed with body, mind, etc.
and a samsāri.  This wrong idea is set right by the viveka that the ātma is
pure consicousness, akarta-abhokta, asamsārin.

maya even while 'affecting', simultaneously makes him appear to be an
entity that is endowed with gunas.  If anyone asks for proof, it is the
arthāpatti pramana that comes from the Br.1.4.10 I have stated above.  If
Brahman comes to know itself as 'aham brahma asmi' and thereby comes to
experience its infinite nature, it is proved that brahman has not known its
true nature prior to that realization and thereby finds itself a finite
jiva. That is the proof.

That very maya can project a whole world of other beings too. This is from
the jiva's angle.  From shāstra drishti, Brahman, the Omniscient, sarvajna,
can engage in creation. So, there is no dichotomy.
