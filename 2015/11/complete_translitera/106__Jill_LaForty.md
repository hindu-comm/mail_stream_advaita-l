Hello fellow truth-seekers.
I'm trying to track down the complete transliterated Sanskrit text plus
English translation of the Adhyasa Bashya. There must be one in cyberspace,
but so far it has eluded me. I've come across bits and pieces, but not the
entire text. Has anyone found one?
Thanks and Namaste.
