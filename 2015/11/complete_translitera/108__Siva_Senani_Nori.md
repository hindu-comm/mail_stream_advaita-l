Adhyasabhashya is the introductory part of Sankaracarya's commentary on the Brahmasutras.
Here is a file of transliterated text. This text was prepared for Natural Language Processing and so quotation marks etc. are missing. Any translation of Brahmasutras (there are seven available) may be consulted.
Here are translations byGeorge Thibaut,V. H. Date, and Rev.K. M. Banerjea. The commentary by Swami Gambhirananda is the best, in my view, followed by that of Thibaut.

Subhanu has written one and the last I heard from him was in April when he mentioned that the book was undergoing editing phase and will be published soon. It may be ready by now. 

May be Subhanu can respond if the book is available and how one can procure the book. 

Hari Om!

 Hello fellow truth-seekers.
 I'm trying to track down the complete transliterated
 Sanskrit text plus
 English translation of the Adhyasa Bashya. There must be one
 in cyberspace,
 but so far it has eluded me. I've come across bits and
 pieces, but not the
 entire text. Has anyone found one?
 Thanks and Namaste.
 jill
