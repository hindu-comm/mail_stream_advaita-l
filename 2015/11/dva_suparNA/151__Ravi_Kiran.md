// paramAtma flies freely without any attachment.

This statement reminded of the mahAmatsya example of Br. Up - 4.3.18

तद्यथा महामत्स्य उभे कूलेऽनुसंचरति पूर्वं चापरं च, एवमेवायं पुरुष
एतावुभावन्तावनुसंचरति स्वप्नान्तं च बुद्धान्तं च ॥ १८ ॥

As a great fish swims alternately to both the banks (of a river), eastern
and western, so does this Infinite Being move to both these states, the
dream and waking states.

*As* in the world *a great fish* that moves freely, never being swayed by
the river-currents, but rather stemming them, *swims alternately to both
the banks* of a river, *eastern and western*. and while swimming between
them, is not overpowered by the intervening current of water, *so does this
infinite being move to both these states*—which are they?—*the dream and
waking states*.  [Sw Madhavananda]
