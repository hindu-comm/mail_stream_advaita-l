In the Mandukya 7th mantra we have स आत्मा स विज्ञेयः

There is at least one example for Nirguna Chaitanyam referred to in
feminine gender too:

तथा जाबालाः — ‘त्वं वा अहमस्मि भगवो देवतेऽहं वै त्वमसि’ इति ।   The word
'devate' in this shruti passage is in the sambodhana, the prathamā,
nominative, of this word is: devatā.  Shankara cites this passage in the
BSB 3.3.37.  Thus we have NB spoken of in the shruti itself in all the
three genders.

In that Mundaka passage that Sri Sada ji cites, Shankara has commented as:
sarvajna is sarvam sāmānyena jānāti, and sarva vit is sarvam viśeṣeṇa
jānāti. Both apply to Ishwara who knows the entire creation both in general
and in specifics, like for example, each jiva's karma.
