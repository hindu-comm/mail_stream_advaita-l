>From ; H.N.Sreenivasa MurthyPranams to all.
Mantra 2-2-12 Mundaka Upanishad reads as follows :
 brahmaivEdamamRutaM purastAt brahma paScAd brahma dakShiNaScOttarENa | adhatScOrdhvaM ca prasRutaM brahmaivEdaM viSvamidaM variShTham ||
In the light of the above mantra where is the tree, where are the two birds, where is Ishvara, where is kShEtrajna, where is the jIva? All these entities are nothing but mere names Viz. concepts which have no independent existence of their own.
Should not the participants, instead of discussing all these appearances which are names only, try to realze the Truth as stated in the above quoted mantra.Mantra 2-2-5 of Mundakopanishad advises : 
 tamEvaikaM jAnatha AtmAnaM anya vAcO vimuMcathAmRutasyaiSha sEtu||Whether to heed to the advice of SrutimAta or not to heed is left to the reader.
With warm and respectful regards,Sreenivasa Murthy
