I suppose in the long run all these terms mean Nirguna Brahman right?

I think the crucial concept in the two birds metaphor is embodiment.  It 
is the identification with pleasure and pain (and all the other pairs of 
dualities) which has made the first bird suffer.  But within the living 
body there is also calm and freedom which is represented by the second 
bird and to recognize this will eventually lead the embodied 'I' beyond 
limited identification with a body.

Typically I don't think of the term Nirguna Brahman in the context of a 
body but ultimately it is true, that is all there is.
