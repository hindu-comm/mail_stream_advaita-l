Namaste Sri Chandramouliji,

Good to hear from you! Interesting observation.

I believe in BSB 1.2.12 AchArya is referring to Brahman quite explicitly.

He says:
न ह्यत्र शारीरः  क्शेत्रग्यः कर्तृत्वभोक्तृत्वादिना संसारधर्मेणोपेतो
विवक्ष्यते । कथं तर्हि? सर्वसंसारधर्मातीतो ब्रह्मस्वभाव
चैतन्यमात्रस्वरूपाः....
And he goes on to quote क्शेतररग्यं चापि मां विद्धि in support of equating
क्शेत्रज्ञ and ब्रह्म!

Because the second bird does not have kartritva/bhoktritva and from
AchArya's use of chaitanyamAtram in describing Brahma svabhAva, it's
probably reasonable to conclude he is referring to nirguNa brahman?

Regards,
Venkatraghavan
