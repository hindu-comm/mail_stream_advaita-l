This is an example from the Br.up. .4.4.7:

तदेष श्लोको भवति । यदा सर्वे प्रमुच्यन्ते कामा येऽस्य हृदि श्रिताः । अथ
मर्त्योऽमृतो भवत्यत्र ब्रह्म समश्नुत इति । *तद्यथाहिनिर्ल्वयनी वल्मीके मृता*
प्रत्यस्ता शयीतैवमेवेदं शरीरं शेतेऽथायमशरीरोऽमृतः प्राणो ब्रह्मैव तेज एव
सोऽहं भगवते सहस्रं ददामीति होवाच जनको वैदेहः ॥ ७ ॥

The bhashyam for the snake-slough of the mantra:

तत् तत्र अयं दृष्टान्तः ; यथा लोके अहिः सर्पः, तस्य निर्ल्वयनी, निर्मोकः,
सा अहिनिर्ल्वयनी, वल्मीके सर्पाश्रये वल्मीकादावित्यर्थः, मृता प्रत्यस्ता
प्रक्षिप्ता अनात्मभावेन सर्पेण परित्यक्ता, शयीत वर्तेत — एवमेव, यथा अयं
दृष्टान्तः, इदं शरीरं सर्पस्थानीयेन मुक्तेन अनात्मभावेन परित्यक्तं मृतमिव
शेते । अथ इतरः सर्पस्थानीयो मुक्तः सर्वात्मभूतः सर्पवत् तत्रैव वर्तमानोऽपि
अशरीर एव, न पूर्ववत् पुनः सशरीरो भवति । कामकर्मप्रयुक्तशरीरात्मभावेन हि
पूर्वं सशरीरः मर्त्यश्च ; तद्वियोगात् अथ इदानीम् अशरीरः, अत एव च अमृतः ;
