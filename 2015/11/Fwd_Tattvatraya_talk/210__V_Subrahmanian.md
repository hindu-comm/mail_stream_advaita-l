Thank you very much for arranging the video recording, processing and
uploading the talks.  This service to the world of śāstra studies from the
Advaita Academy is to be cherished by one and all.  Pl. convey my thanks to
the Management of the Academy for playing a pivotal role in the
dissemination of the great treasure of Bhāratīya Darśana Sampat.

warm regards
