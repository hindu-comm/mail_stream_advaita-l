Dear Sirs,

My name is Joson George. I am now 21 years old. I am an Engineering 
student. B.tech:Electronics and Communications. I have been a student of 
Advaita Vedanta for the past three years. I have been studying Vedanta 
under a traditional teacher, Prof.G. Balakrishnan.I have created my own 
website-- http://360.yahoo.com/josongeorge5 where I have posted several 
articles on Vedantic topics. I came to know about your website by chance 
only yesterday and i wish to continue my studies with the help of learned 
members of this group.
