I am writing this in response to the Advaita-L welcome letter, so that I may 
seek approval. My name is Alexander Romanovich. I am 27 years old, and I live 
primarily in New York City, though I have a second home in Mumbai, India. I 
have an extensive background in metaphysics, philosophical, and religious 
studies, including, not not limited to, Western Esotericism and Perennial 
Philosophy, Hermeticism, Zen, Traditionalism, Taoism, Alchemy,  Nondualism, 
Greek Philosophy (esp. Plato/Neoplatonism and Parmenides). My chief interest, 
however, is Advaita Vedanta, and I seek both to deepen my understanding of it, 
as well as compare/contrast it to the various other paths that I have come in 
contact with throughout my broad studies.
