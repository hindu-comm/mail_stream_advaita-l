Although this does not bring much to the discussion, I should like to 
contribute a small personal comment about the superb story of the 17 cows 
mentioned below. This story was told to me by my VedAnta teacher in May 1963 
when the latter came back from a one year-long stay in Kerala, inThrissUr 
(then Trichur), where his own guru was born. In the story as he told me the 
father left to his sons elephants and not cows as one may expect in 
ThrissUr. The despaired sons when they saw that the elephants were in the 
indivisible number of 17 turned themselves (not to a passing sage but) to 
their father's guru in VadakunnAtha mandira for a proper advice; the latter 
explained he had been given one elephant many years earlier by their father 
and that he accepted to lend them his own elephant to facilitate the solving 
of their problem but he also insisted to get back his elephant after they 
would have made their division, which they could do as explained below. In 
May 1963 being only 17 1/2-year-old and having studied VedAnta and sanAtana 
dharma for only two years, being as much ignorant as I remain today I did 
not understood the story as an example of MAyA but more as a good 
illustration of gurushiShyabandha.
See...what is good with ignorance is that you can at least retain your 
illusions and survive.
