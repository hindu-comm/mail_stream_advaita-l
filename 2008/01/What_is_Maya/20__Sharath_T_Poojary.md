Dear Sir,

Thank you for your kind help.

But, if Maya is a power of Brahman...then why do we not describe Brahman as "Maya-Sat-Chid-Ananda", as Maya is also an adjective as sat, cit and anand with respect to Brahman?

Why is it that people only attribute the latter 3 to Brahman, when Maya is a power of Brahman...that too...so potent that it veils the other 3 aspects?

Would you be so kind as to clarify this?

Regards,
Sharath
