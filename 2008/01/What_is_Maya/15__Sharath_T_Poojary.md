Namaste,

When we talk of Maya and those that are due to it, are we not bringing in duality where just Brahman exist? I have read that Maya is not apart from Brahman, as heat is not apart from fire. But with reference to this example, is not heat something different from fire. Of course, in our example, heat is dependent on fire. But as such, heat is different in itself. Like, heat can also be from flow of electron through a filament in bulb. Here we do not see fire, but heat is still present.

Can someone tell how the ONLY BRAHMAN "becomes" of "mistaken" (so to say)as Maya, when there is nothing else?

Sharath
