Pranams
Any sentence in the Upanishads that *reveals* the identity or "aikyam" of jivatma and paramatma is a Mahavakya. There are numerous such Mahavakyas strewn through each and every Upanishad. The Mahavakyas are so-called because the truth that they reveal is the *sole* pramana for the establishment of such a "aikyam" of seemingly separate and different entities. For a prepared mind, an understanding of their import confers jnanam and grants mukti - here and now - hence their glorification. Other sentences in the Upanishads are only aids to help understand the Mahavakyas. These Mahavakyas are not injunctions, they are statements of fact, that establish a truth that is unavailable to any other means of knowledge.

Subject: [Advaita-l] Mahavakyas of Upnishaths

Dear members
I would like to share my thoughts about why the four oft quoted Upanishathic vakyas are called great.As said all vakyas of upanishaths are all equally great there is no doubt about it.We are searching the Brahman and the sruthi helps us to realise the Brahman.These four vakyas help one to contemplate on Brahman by calling attention to where exactly 
one should concentrate and stay focussed to realise It.Hence our forefathers have labelled them as Mahavakyas.
