Right and why stop at the upanishads?  Even in the samhita and brahmana 
portions of the Vedas contain statements teaching jnana.  Thus karma kanda 
and jnana kanda should not be thought of as seperate "books."  In fact 
there is no reason why a particular vakya couldn't be considered part of 
both. (e.g. purushasukta)
