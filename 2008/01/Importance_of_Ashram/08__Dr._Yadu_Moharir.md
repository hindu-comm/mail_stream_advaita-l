Namste Jayanarayan-Ji:

  Dos this not mean that Swami Parthasarathy is utilizing the teachings rather than locking himself in the Ivory Towers of Advaita?

  If Advaita had no use in everyday life (vyaharika level) then one needs to wonder why Archarya established school (Math) in all four corners of India?

  If someone uses the Advaitic principles why should that individual be looked upon as being less ?  IMHO - It should be the other way around.

  aj~nebhyo granthinaH shreShThaa,  granthibhyo dhaariNo varaaH |
dhaaribhyo j~naaninaH shreShThaa,  j~naanibhyo vyavasaayinaH || manusmR^iti 12-103||


  Meaning - Someone who has studied a little is better than totally ignorant. Someone who has memorized them are better than someone who knows a little. One who knows the meaning is superior to those who memorizes. However, one who practices it (the knowledge) is certainly the most superior.

My apologies if I am missing something !!

  Best regards,

  Dr. Yadu

Exactly.

But there is hardly any doubt that Swami Parthasarathy is first and
foremost a businessman who happens to be incidentally interested in
Vedanta. For instance, here is the advertisement on his website:

http://www.vedantaworld.org/cultural%20foundation%20bro_sc.pdf

"... you will learn in a personalized setting with
Swami Parthasarathy, the world authority on ancient wisdom
in modern business."


As to his credentials of being a great Vedanta teacher:

http://www.vedantaworld.org/founder_person.htm
http://www.vedantaworld.org/cultural%20foundation%20bro_sc.pdf

"Above all, at 6 feet he has maintained a 32 inch waistline,
148 pound weight and ideal blood pressure and sugar levels
for the past 60 years! Born to a premier business family,..."

Swami Parthasarathy's waistline and weight are important selling
points for his being a great teacher of Vedanta! Note the emphasis in
"Above all, ..." - implying that his maintenance of waistline and
weight is a clincher establishing him as a great Vedanta teacher.
Does anyone care if Sankara or Sureshvara maintained a certain
waistline or "ideal" blood sugar levels?! Bodily characteristics are
inconsequential details to a Vedantin.


The above link also says:

http://www.vedantaworld.org/cultural%20foundation%20bro_sc.pdf

"If you cannot find happiness in your work,
you will never find it."


Advaita Vedanta teaches us that it is the RENUNCIATION of work
(Sannyasa) that is the ideal to true and steady happiness. Isn't it
strange that Swami Parthasarathy teaches us that it is IN work that
happiness is found - a doctrine that is never found in the teachings
of great Vedantins, all of whom unanimously teach us to either remain
detached from the results of work (Nishkamya Karma) or renounce work
altogether (Sannyasa)?


Swami Parthasarathy respects Vedanta enough to incorporate it into
his "version" of Vedanta and "Corporate Management", so he may have
good intentions, but this still feels "cultish".

The "Self-management" that is being taught here is what Vedantins
would call "EGO-management".

Gita 3.27 is very relevant in this context:

ahaMkAra vimUDhAtmA kartAham iti manyate .
"The soul deluded by the ego (ahaMkAra) thinks 'I am a worker'."

Just a small note: Dharma encompasses all righteous action, not
merely rituals.

Kartik
