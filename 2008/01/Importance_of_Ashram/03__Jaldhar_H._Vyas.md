Well that's the question isn't it?  Does this kind of thing really address 
the problems materialist businessmen face or is it just a palliative?

As I mentioned in the other post I wrote on this topic today, there is 
part of the broader Smarta or "Hindu" tradition that does address the 
issues of living in this world but Vedanta is something else.

Advaita Vedanta is not trying to make society better.  It is 
self-admittedly "other worldly" But it is part of a greater corpus of 
beliefs, which I am refering to as smarta, one of which is that "other 
worldliness" belongs to the last stage of life.  Other things are expected 
of younger people and I think those other things would do more to address 
the immediate problems they face than Vedanta would while preparing them 
for Vedantic sadhana later.

The confusion over these matters is a deliberate historical and cultural 
phenomenon.  A critical thinker should ponder why.

Well speaking as someone of a similar background, I drew a different 
conclusion (even though I found it pretty damn indigestible at first.) 
*shrug* Go figure.

But by deciding against complicated Sanskrit terminology or debating 
which Swami is authentic or wiser, you have already biased your answer.

I congratulate you for making the efforts that you are.  It is my eternal 
regret that when I was younger I didn't go to India for a good period of 
time and study in depth.  While I think I've done a decent job of studying 
and practising shastras, I feel I could have done better.  Now I'm 36 and 
married with children my family duties prevent it.  So what you are doing 
is--despite all that has been said--overall a good thing.  But nevertheless 
my opinion is you would better use your time travelling around and 
observing the range of views rather staying in one place and listening to 
only one opinion.
