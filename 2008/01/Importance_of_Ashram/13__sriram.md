Dear Members
I think it is not fair to take pot shots at Sri Parthasarathy`s way of 
teaching vedanta .He has given the course content and utilises the 
Upanashidic teachings to improve the thinking process and develop 
concentration on the subject on hand.Yes it appears to cater to 
materialistic aspirations of the disciples but it is up to the disciple to 
apply the teachings to further his spiritual advance.I think Sri 
Parthasarathy uses Karmakanda sayings  to ultimately lure to 
Jnanakanda.Krishnamoorthy.
