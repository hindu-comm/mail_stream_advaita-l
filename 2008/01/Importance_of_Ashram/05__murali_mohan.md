my opinion is you would better use your time travelling around and 
observing the range of views rather staying in one place and listening to 
only one opinion.

  This is my humble thoughts on this:  
  It is said that digging at one place would ultimately fetch you water whereas digging many small holes all around would lead nowhere and is a waste of time (there is a story on this used to illustrate the uselessness of worshipping multiple gods - can apply to multiple Gurus as well).  There is no dearth of views in this world and there will be no end to one's search. Better select one and stick to it as life is short. Shraddha is more important than finding the most ideal teacher. It is also said that if a student has enough Shraddha even an idiot teacher can make him enlightned (there are stories in Srimad Bhagavatham that illustrates this). 

  Pranams,
  Mohan
