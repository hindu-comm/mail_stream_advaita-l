AFAIK, Sri Parthasarathy is not a "swami" in technical sense. He has not
taken any sannyasa. "Swami" title has been given to him by his students. He
spent some time at Sandipani Gurukul at Powai, when Swami Chinmayanada was
alive and Swami Dayananda was chief instructor there. He was asked to leave
Sandipani before completing the course, reasons for which were never made
public.

That said, I have heard that his stress management courses are good.
