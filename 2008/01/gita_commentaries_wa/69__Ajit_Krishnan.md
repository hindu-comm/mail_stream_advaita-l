Thank you. This makes much more sense than how I was attempting to convolute
it.

Another question: when studying  bhagavatpAdA's commentary, are any other
sub-commentaries studied in parallel? Is the bhashya generally read in the
context of any sub-commentaries? For example, take Anandagiri's tika. Is the
tika read in parallel with the bhashya, or left to a later time?

A text from the digial library has the following in addition to
shankara-bhAShya ---

(b) anandagiri's tika
(c) nilakaNThi
(d) bhAShyotkarSha-dIpIkA of dhanapati
(e) shrIdharI
(f) gItArthasangraha of abhinavaguptAchArya
(g) gUDhArthadIpIkA of madhusUdana
(h) gUDhArthatattvaloka of shridharmadattashrama

Which of these (if any) can be read alongside the bhashyam?

bhavadIyaH,

         ajit
