Namasate,

Vedic literature too holds similar views ....
see for example:
http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/db/bk04ch10.htm

there are two paths within veda, pravRtti, and
nivRtti.

In pravRtti dharma the role of and importance that
needs to be given to ahamkAra tattva probably 
needs to carefully understood (what happens when
ahamkAra tattva is over emphasized? what happens
when it is under emphasized? etc .....)

Regards,
Shrinivas
