PraNAms to everybody.

For some reason the some of the format used in the
word file did not come properly when copied and
posted.

I think it is possible to unravel the changed format
if one is patient.  

Here is one example:

There is a fundamental human error involved
> in the equation ¡®I am = This¡¯. \
The statement is - There is a fundamental human error
involved in the equation "I am = This".


The quotation marks came out funny.  Since these are
used extensively to demark the text, it may not be
impossible to read. For those who want to have correct
port I can send the word file directly if you request
in a private mail.
.

Hari Om!
Sadananda.
