I see. Let me try to re-state this idea.

Shankara comments "kuru karmANi kevalam IshvarArtham, tatrApi Ishvaro
me tuShyatu iti sa.ngam tyaktvA". This is "samatvam", or
"sattva-buddhiH". Out of this sattva-shuddiH / pure
ishvara-ArAdhana-buddhiH comes gyAnam. And "out of this gyAnam" comes
siddhiH.

So, in "siddhi-asiddhayoH samo bhUtva", the instruction is primarily
directed at the case of "asiddhiH", since siddhiH presupposes samatvam
in the first place.

Thanks.
