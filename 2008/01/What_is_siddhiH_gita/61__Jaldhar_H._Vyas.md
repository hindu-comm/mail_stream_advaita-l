siddhi is the result of jnana which is the result of pure sattva or 
ishvararadhanabuddhi as M.S. puts it.  The latter has a more theistic 
orientation but the idea is the same.

To compare, A. Mahadeva Shastri translates it as "attainment of knowledge 
as the result of the mind attaining purity"

We shouldn't care about sucess or failure in attaining siddhi because it 
is not the "product" of human volition.  Detachment from worry about 
results gives rise to jnana which naturally results in siddhi.
