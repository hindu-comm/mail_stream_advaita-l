Dear Members
We have to take siddhi as pointing to the the results of action which are 
performed without any attachment.The previous stanza which is hall mark of 
Gita and oft quoted by all has said that action should be for actionsake 
only and without attachment to its fruits nor  attachment to inaction as 
action may not give the sought result.That is one has right only to perform 
action.This is  the status of a Karma yogi.Baghavan has used three ma`s to 
indicate the undesirable and in the next stanza He uses kuru to indicate how 
the action is to be done by a yogi.So siddhi can be taken to mean success in 
action and asiddhi to mean failure.R.Krishnamoorthy.
