Jai Sri Krsna



Dear readers,



What is the traditional advaitic mangalAcharaNa?



Right now before I start pUja or any activity i start with...



Shruti smruti puraanaanaam.....shankaram loka shankarama



Shankaram shankaraachaaryam...bhagavantau punah punah



Is there any traditional praarthana and in which order to say it in?



Kind Regards,



Krunal
