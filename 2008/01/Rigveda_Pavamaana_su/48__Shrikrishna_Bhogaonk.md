Hello,

I was wondering if anyone could tell me the list of suktams included in the
Rigveda Pavamaana suktam?  I have a wonderful CD of the Rigveda Pavamaana
suktam, and I was looking for a devanagari or even english text to follow
along.  I know that the Rigveda Pavamaana suktam begins with the first
suktam of the 9th mandala of the Rigveda Samhita and goes until about the
67th suktam, but I was not sure of the actual structure of this long suktam
and what individual pieces are included.  Any assistance that anyone can
provide would be appreciated.

Yours,

Krishna Bhogaonker
