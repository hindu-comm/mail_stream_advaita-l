I recently bought the jyotirbrAhmaNa from the MLBD bookstore in
Bangalore. I bought all the other books about 7 years back in the
University of Madras bookstore.

Also try www.bookfinder.com.

I found that R Balasubramanians books are available, but you have to
pay a hefty price. ~$77 for the taittirIya-bhAShya vArttikam. So are
some of T M P Mahadevans books.

I strongly suggest his book on brahmasiddhi. It is $26 in Alibris. I
remember paying about Rs 200 in Jayalakshmi Ind. Bookhouse!

Where do you live? If you live in the Boston area, let me know. I can
lend the books, but no request for photocopies please! All books are
ready to fall apart with the slightest provocation.
