With reference to the brihadaraNyaka updanishad, can someone elaborate? The
explanations I have seen are

a) sixteen kalas of Moon, counting from amAvasya to paurnami
b) pancha bhutas+ pancha pranas + pancha jnanendriyas+manas

#a, is widely used in srividya tradition in different contexts. If there is
a list of sixteen attributes or powers (such as the six in the definition of
bhaga), can someone here please list them?

TIA

Ravi
