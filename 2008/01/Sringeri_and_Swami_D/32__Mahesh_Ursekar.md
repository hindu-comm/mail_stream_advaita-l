Pranams Kartik:

Swami Parthasarthy studied Vedanta at Chinmaya mission under Swami
Chinmayananda. Among others who have done the same is Swami Sukhbodhananda

What I really appreciate about both these gurus is that they bring Vedanta
(& more importantly its application) to the individual wrapped in samsara.
Years ago Swami Vivekananda did the same - in direct opposition to his
brother disciples who felt it was to be practiced only by renunciates.

In my opinion, Vedanta is a wealth that ought be shared by one and all. And
my personal experience has been that it is easier to study Vedanta but it's
immensely harder to live by its precepts. And all the Swamis mentioned
above preach the latter which is why I value them.

As to the link u have sent, I have no clue if the Swami mentioned therein is
the same Swami Parthasarthy.

Pranams, Mahesh
