namaskAraH,

SK Ramachandra Rao, one of the encyclopedic scholars of the Dharma in
recent times, has authored 2 books on Sri Vidya:

1. The Tantrik practices in Sri Vidya
2. Sri Vidya Kosha

I would like to know whether any of our group members have read these
works and can comment on their contents. I am specifically looking to
know whether the former is an abridgement/subset of the latter.
