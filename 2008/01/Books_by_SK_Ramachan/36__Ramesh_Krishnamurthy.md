I sincerely appreciate your feedback. I am quite conscious of the need
to approach traditional teachers on these matters. Books are only a
supplement.

My idea behind reading these books was to get some understanding of
the breadth and history of Srividya and certainly not to use it as a
guide for practice. I certainly won't practise it without proper
mantra-dIkShA.

Btw, I recently happened to attend a pravachana by Sri Goda
Venkateswara Shastri on the Vivekachudamani, which can only be
described as "superb". So there are many advantages of being in India,
surely.

My sincere thanks once again
Ramesh
