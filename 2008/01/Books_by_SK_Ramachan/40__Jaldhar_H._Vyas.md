FWIW, we should bear in mind that he had one foot in the world of 
traditional scholarship and one in the world of critical scholarship.  The 
views you mention are not especially controversial in the latter.  When 
specifically expounding shastras I don't see that he took anything other 
than a 100% astika approach.

When I was in Bangalore in '05 I visited the Shrngeri math and from their 
bookstall I bought his edition with translation of svanubhavadarsha of 
Swami Madhavashrama.  It impressed me enough that I became interested in 
his other writings and the shrividyakosha in particular is on my list to 
read if I ever find the time.
