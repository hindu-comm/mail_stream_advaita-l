Dear members
There is an ashtakam extolling Lord Narayana`s soulabyam.This ashtakam praises the Lord for His helpful hand to Gajendra,Prahlada,Draupadthi,Ahalya,Dhruva and other steadfast devotees of Him.Every sloka ends with the burden -Bhagvan Sri manNarayanome` Gathi: 
I shall be thankful if any one of our members could direct me how to get that sloka.I tried the web sites of Gita press but no luck.
R.Krishnamoorthy.
