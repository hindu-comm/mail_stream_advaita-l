I share the same thoughts as you regarding ghana chanting. While it is
mellifluous and dandy, the chant in itself has no meaning/purpose.
Some pundits claim that they do it for veda samrakshana or
"rakshartham vedanaam". Some class of pundits consider ghana bad
because it reverses the order of words in mantras - they embrace krama
patha more whole-heartedly.
