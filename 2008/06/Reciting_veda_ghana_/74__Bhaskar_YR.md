I've couple of questions...

(a) I heard from someone that reciting veda ghanapATam is of no use...ghana
is meant only to show our mastery over recitation of vEda maNtra-s in a
prescribed order by following the proper saNdhi between the words but this
ghana recitation does not give any meaningful meaning....I also do feel
like that...especially when I am doing  Ashirvachana in ghana :-))  (like
navO navO bhavati, punastvAdityA, shatamAnaM bhavati, paryAptya
anantarAyAya etc.)...

(b)  In chandi (durgA saptashati) svahAkAra during chandi yAga, why we say
svahAkAra even to uvAcha-s...like agasthyA uvAcha svAhA...brahmOvAcha
svAhA..etc. If everything in saptashati is like maNtra then why we dont say
svAhAkAra to R^ishi, dEvata, chandas also??

Kindly clarify.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
