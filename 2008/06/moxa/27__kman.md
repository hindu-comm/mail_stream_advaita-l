This sort of tendency to discourage any one to question/judge bad practices
advocated in the sastra is the reason for the down fall of humanity. That
kind of non-judgement (or conscience focused on self desires)  lead to ill
treatment of women, sudras etc. So please let us use our conscience to
empathize and serve the humanity rather than self desires. I think this is
what spirituality is all about.

Why do you have to defend a bad thing with another bad thing? Who  said the
other thing is ok? The discussion is about Vedas, sastras.
