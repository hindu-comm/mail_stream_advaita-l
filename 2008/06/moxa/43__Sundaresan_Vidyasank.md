It looks like the more one writes, the more one is apt to be
misunderstood, so I will keep this brief.

Question the SAstra by all means. However, do not appoint
your own conscience as the judge over it. That is all.

If your conscience is so good as to direct you perfectly at
all times and in all situations, you don't need SAstra. If your
conscience is not perfect, it is not a good judge.

Regards,
Vidyasankar
