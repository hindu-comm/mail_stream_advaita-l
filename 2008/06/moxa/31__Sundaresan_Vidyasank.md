Personally, it is not out of dread of questioning the SAstra that
I write defending the SAstra, but out of dread of the motivations
and presumptions of those who question it! When you talk of the
learned SAstrin-s in India who can interpret in the light of
contemporary concerns, I breathe easier. All I am saying is, there
has to be something at the core to interpret and the interpretation
has to arise out of a constructive engagement with the SAstra.
One's conscience cannot be the sole nor the central criterion
for coming to a conclusion.

Of course, secular law does not follow the dictates of the dharma
SAstra. But then, the manusmRti is not the only dharmaSAstra in
Hinduism, although it is the one beloved by those who like to
criticize.

As with some others, I think you misunderstand my ethical concerns.
I am not advocating expansion of mechanized butcheries. But rest
assured, there will always be special interests in the world who will.
And there will always be a market for them. Both in the USA where
I live now, and in India, where I grew up, there is a substantial
population of "progressive" Hindus, who indignantly proclaim against
the SAstra-s, criticize animal sacrificies in the Vedic religion, and
and adjourn for an expensive carnivorous dinner.

We are veering far from the focus of this list in this discussion, so
I'll
stop here. Rest assured, those on this list who defend our SAstra have
as many, if not more, ethical concerns about various subjects, but we
are justifiably wary of what we see as unwarranted criticisms,
especially
from a Vedantic standpoint.

Vidyasankar
