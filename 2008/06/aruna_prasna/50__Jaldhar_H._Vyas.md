I am a shuklayajurvedi myself so unfortunately I can't give you a definite 
answer but based on similiar passages I would say it is because in the 
shrauta vidhi associated with that passage there is a repetition of some 
action.  I suggest you look at the bhashya of sayanacharya or 
bhattabhaskara etc. for details.

Typically in these cases veda is being used in a more restrictive sense of 
"secret knowledge" or "inner meaning" of course it is all veda in the 
sense of shruti.
