Thankyou for the ingenious idea.  I never thought of it that way before.

My impression is this would make a lot of sense from a samkhya point of 
view because that darshana posits a closed universe where all three gunas 
are in equilibrium.  But does  this necessarily hold true for Vedanta?  If 
Brahman is the source of the entire world-appearance and beyond the three 
gunas Himself, then there is no reason why one guna could not predominate. 
As long as we are speculating, perhaps there are even multiple universes 
in which different quantities of sattva, rajas, and tamas exist.
