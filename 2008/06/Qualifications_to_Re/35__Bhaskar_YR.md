Dear Great Pandits,

praNAms
Hare Krishna

I am not a pundit...but here is my understanding.

Q: Who is qualified to chant Vedas?

>  As you said below, only dvija-s are eligible to chant (with svara /
intonations) vEda maNtra-s..Our dharma shAstra-s says apart from Sudra &
stree, all dvija-s like brAhmaNa, kshatriya & vysya are eligible to learn &
chant vEdamaNtra.

Doubt:  I believe persons who do not have Upanayanam or Brahmopadesham
done cannot chant Vedas.

>  yes, you are right.

Of course, all can know the meaning of the Vedas and its essence. If so,
where is the PramaNam for this quoted?

>  For non-dvija-s smruti texts such as gIta & purANa-s etc. itself a means
to attain jnAna.  What dvija-s gain from vEdAdhyayana is available for them
from the proper comtemplation on these smruti & purANa texts.  I think, the
pramANa for this you can find in our dharma shAstra (like manu smruti etc.)

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
