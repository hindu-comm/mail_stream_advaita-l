Dear Great Pandits,

I have a doubt on the subject matter and would much appreciate if you  
can shed some light. I am asking this out of purely seeking the right  
knowledge and not for argument.

Q: Who is qualified to chant Vedas?
Doubt:  I believe persons who do not have Upanayanam or Brahmopadesham  
done cannot chant Vedas.
Of course, all can know the meaning of the Vedas and its essence.
If so, where is the PramaNam for this quoted?
