Dear Members
Vedas contain sublime thoughts and they reveal the existence of the Brahman and they are believed to be 
apaurusheya meaning revelations by Brahman Itself.The search for the Almighty is meaningless if one does not 
believe in It.Vedas declare that there is Almighty and one can realise It and the manushya janma should not be 
wasted as it is rare to obtain.So by chanting these hymns one is constantly reminded of one`s sacred duty to realise 
the Almighty.There is no condition that one should chant vedas otherwise go to hell.By chanting the Vedas you are 
definitely on the right path to gain the goal of being born as a human being.By experience our forefathers would 
have found that certain qualifications are necessary to do veda adhyayanam.May be due to evolution of time they 
may-the qualifications -seem to be illogical etc.But if one has faith one can always make an exception instead of 
indulging in engaging in controversies.So if one is interested one can always find out methods to recite the vedas for 
one`s own satisfaction as to know  whether there is good in it or not.Nobody chants vedas for ego purposes.Once 
something is made routine one`s contemplation about the Truth will be more and itself is a reward.Like an artist finds 
pleasure in the art itself.R.Krishnamoorthy.
