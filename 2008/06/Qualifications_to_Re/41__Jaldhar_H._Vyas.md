See Mimamsa sutra 6.1 and
Brahmasutra 1.3.34-38

It is in the bhashya on Brahmasutra 1.3.38 that Shankaracharya explains 
how despite not being eligible for vedadhyayana, the non-dvijas are still 
capable of moksha because it is a bird of a completely different feather 
to dharma.

Tell them the truth.  They are going in 180 degrees the wrong direction if 
they do that.  To learn Vedanta, study Vedanta nothing else.

Passivity and curses.  Are these really the only two choices we have?  I 
find that most of these people are sincere.  They genuinely think they are 
doing a good thing and are simply misguided.  I find that if you explain 
things without compromise but in a logical and non-patronizing way they 
often do come around.  You never now unless you try.

The self to remain focused on is Brahman not the ahamkara.  The issue is 
not what is getting you anywhere but what is right.  A grhastha cannot use 
mysticism as an excuse for inaction.
