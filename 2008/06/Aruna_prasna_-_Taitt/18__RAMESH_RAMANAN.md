Dear Shri Narayan Iyer,

  Pranams,

  Sri Ramakrishna Math and Mission have published the top 108 upanishads  with Sanskrit Text Tamil Translation in a series of volumes with  commentary by Sri Anna N. Subramaniam, a veteran scholar, who is no  more. I think you will be able to find the Tamil translation of  Taittiriya Upanishad and Aranyaka in that series. The same organization  has also published the English translation of Taittiriya Upanishad. I  am not sure whether it contains the Aranyaka, but you could give it a  try.

  Pranams once again, Ramesh Ramanan.

Can someone elighten why some mantras in Aruna Prasna are repeated (in some cases three repitions)??

Also where can I get the translation of Taittiriya aranyaka in English/Tamil/Hindi/Marathi?

Thanks and regards

narayan
