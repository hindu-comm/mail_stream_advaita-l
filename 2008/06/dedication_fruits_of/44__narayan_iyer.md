Pranams,

Would someone explain what exactly is meant by dedicating the fruits of an action to the Lord?  It looks easy enough to understand, but exactly what it is?

For eg. I perform an action with prayers to the Lord.  (a) The action suceeds.  I am slightly elated (though I should not, I think).  I thank the Lord.  Is it (the dedication of fruits) over?

(b) I fail in the mission.  I pray to God to make me more capable in future endeavours.  I am slightly disappointed, not much though.  Is the dedication over?

regards

narayan
