Coincidentally what I've been busy with lately is revamping the Purva 
Mimamsa Home Page (http://www.mimamsa.org/)

It will contain:

* Articles about Purva Mimamsa
* Biographies of Mimamsaka authors
* Glossary of Mimamsaka terms
* Bibliography of Mimamsaka works
* PDFs of Mimamsaka texts.

...and anything else that you want to know about the subject.

There is a lot of work remaining but check it out and see if it is useful 
to you.
