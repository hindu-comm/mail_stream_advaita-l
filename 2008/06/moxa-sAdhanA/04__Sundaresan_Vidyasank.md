Ananta, Vedic injunctions presume a particular desire on
the part of the man who wishes a particular result. There
is no injunction that says that everyone should sacrifice.
Rather, every injunction is of the form, "if you desire
such and such, then do this sacrifice."  A man's raised
conscience can always work on his own desires, rather
than standing in judgment over Sastra.  

We live in a society where tons of meat are processed
every day, on an industrial scale, for human consumption.
Is animal sacrifice sanctioned by the Vedas really that 
big a problem for anybody?
