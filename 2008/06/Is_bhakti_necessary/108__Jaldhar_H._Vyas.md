Sorry Suresh, I had written this earlier but never got around to posting 
it.

In the definition of Brahman as sacchidananda, the ananda part is often 
overlooked but bhakti is ananda.

On the contrary I posted this quote from brahmasutrabhshya vyuhadhikarana 
a few weeks back and it is worth repeating:

"Concerning this system we remark that we do not intend to controvert the
doctrine that Narayana who is higher than the avyakta, who is the
paramatma and sarvatma, reveals Himself by dividing Himself in multiple
forms...Nor do we mean to object to the inculculation of unceasing
concentration of mind on the highest Being which appears in the Bhagavata
shastra under the forms of abhigamana etc. [earlier it was mentioned that
bhakti consists of abhigamana, upaadaana, ijyaa, svaadhyaaya, and yoga.]"

Shankaracharya may consider jnana as the highest bhakti but he definitely 
does not belittle "sentimental activities" in the process.

This needn't be an either/or situation.  Remember the ahamkara/atma bheda 
also has to be overcome and this is a goal of bhajan etc.

Exactly!  And this is their importance.  Our first glimpses of advaita 
tattva are in love whether parent-child, husband-wife, patriot-homeland 
etc.  If you told the average person that what is plainly visible in 
front of their own faces is mithya they would think it highly strange 
indeed but all except the most sociopathic personality understands that 
love for another transcends love of ones own ego.  Bhakti extends the 
feeling of love from a limited sense to all that is.  As such it is a most 
effective sadhana for self-realization.

Another thing occured to me.  It is possible that all the talk of mithya 
and maya might result in a weak-minded sadhaka developing contempt for the 
world.  Bhakti prevents this by showing how Bhagavan is "purna"
