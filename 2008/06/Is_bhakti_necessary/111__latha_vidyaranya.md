bhakthi is devotion. devotion develops when one is in total, unflinchinglove - unquestioning (blind or with knowledge)love that that is the ultimate! there are rama bhakthas, krishna bhakthas, as well as rajkumar or shahrukh khan bhakthas! they worship the other personality with utmost devotion thinking that nobody or no other entity is higher than that. there are also 'prakruti' bhakthas who worship the nature as god. only those who have realized this kind of bhakthi can go beyond it to realize the ultimate advitiya brahman. all those who think bhakthi is childish and jnaana is very prudent are highly egoistic, in the sense that they think they are higher mortals than those who follow the bhakthi maarga. their jnana is dry, shushka tattva. bhakthi inculcates humility, humbleness. only when one surrenders totally, with utmost humility to the higher self, can one merge with the ultimate.
jnaana when smeared with bhakthi rasa has the power to lift oneself up.
