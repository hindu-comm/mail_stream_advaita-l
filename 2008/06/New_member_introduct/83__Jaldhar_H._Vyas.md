The quest for knowledge and realization led me here.  One keeps swaying 
away from the truth in today's world of materialism and mis-placed 
priorities but because of some invisible pull, few keep getting drawn back 
into the quest for knowledge and truth.  I'm in another attempt to 
channelize my quest to lead a meaningful life and I hope this time I'm 
successful.

Pranam,
Vijay
