Hello Friends,

Pukhraj from Punjab, India. I am quite a fervent student of eastern as 
well western spirituality, esotericism and comparative mythology. I have 
done extensive amount of research on presence/activities/origination of 
Western orders like OTO, Golden Dawn, Freemasons, TS, Rosicrucianism, 
Yezidism and The Fourth Way etc. I am currently undertaking some research 
for Mr.K Paul Johnson, author of the The Masters Revealed in corroborating 
his claims regarding TS. However, my passion lies in the studying about 
the Eastern orders like Naths, Kaulas, Kashmir Shaivism, DzogChen etc. I 
am considerably new to Vedanta and hope to be a careful observer in this 
group.

I love reading and writing. Otto Weininger, Arthur Schopenhauer, Ted 
Kaczynski, Friedrick Nietzsche, Aleister Crowley, Eliphas Levi, Rudolf 
Steiner, John Woodroffe, George Orwell, Joseph Conrad, Jean Gebser, 
William Sargant, James George Frazer, Phillip K. Dick, Bal Gangadhar 
Tilak, Heinrich Kramer, G. I. Gurdjieff, Piara Singh Sambhi, Jack Kerouac, 
Koenraad Elst, Yukteswar Giri, Lakshmanjoo are some of my favorite 
authors.

I am a information security researcher and an entrepreneur by profession.

Regards,
Pukhraj
