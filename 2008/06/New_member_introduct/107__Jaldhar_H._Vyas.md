I am called Murali with 30 years of this life already lived out! I was 
introduced to Vedanta by my grandfather who is highly inclined towards 
this greatest philosophy and is working overtime for self-realization. 
Though my initial talks with him were just for a talk sake (from my side)- 
by the immense grace of the lord, this living of mine has found its 
purpose to realise the self. This interest keeps me wandering thru sites 
such as yours and I find this as a satsanga in its own right. Kindly let 
me subscribe to your content. With gratitude and regards.
