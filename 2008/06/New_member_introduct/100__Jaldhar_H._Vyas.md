I am 35 years old and live in Chennai. I am married and have two children. 
I have been keenly trying to understand Advaita and Vaidika dharma. In 
this process, I have inducted my 8 year old son into a veda patasala this 
year after performing his upanayanam. I wsould like to share my thoughts 
and ideas on Advaita as well as integrating vedic education in 
contemporary life.
