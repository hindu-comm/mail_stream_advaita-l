praNAm all,

We use silk dhotI and angavastra for sandhyA, pUja, etc. I haven't yet found
any reference to justify the same due to the cruel process of silk
production. Would someone be able to provide information whether Vedas
permit/ recommend usage of silk clothes in pUja and of so, the justification
for the process.

Thanks,
--Praveen R. Bhat
