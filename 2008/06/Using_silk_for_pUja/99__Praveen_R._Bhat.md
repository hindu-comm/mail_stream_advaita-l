Apologies, I meant to say that "AFAIK, I follow" as in the doubt was about
the technicality of *following*, than which sutra. :)

I got that of course, but as I said, I hadn't heard of cheenambaram being
mentioned for silk.

Hmmm, interesting, but I doubt I'm capable/ learned enough to ask my
maThAdipati to give references for things in his pravacana. I'd rather be
sitting at home reading books instead, what use is the parampara to me then?
Personally, I prefer the other way of rechecking something in printed stuff
with the maTha.

Agreed. But also a first step is faith. And be it a negative, but I've
tremendous faith in what my elders in the tradition say. If that sounds as
if its blind faith, I tend to kind of agree there too.

I do recognize it, but the reminder to my memory does only good. :) But if
you remember the phrasing, I asked if at all Vedas justify it. If I read you
answer as *no they do not, because they do not consider it as a cruel
process in the first place*, I've no arguments, I have to accept your
stance. But... contd in the below response.

Implicit in the construct is not my concern, but a general concern. So
anumAna in this case is not a perfectly correct inference, though one of the
inferences. Else I'd have left silk long back and used cotton instead. Now
whether I consider the recommendation as cruel is a totally different
matter. From a certain perspective killing is, surely, neither neutral nor
good action. The only place where I know of killing being recommended is
animal sacrifices, for which I know there is an explanation that the
sacrificed animal gets swarga and a higher janma. If it was said that the
sacrifice results in the yajmAna's swarga prApti,or whatever putra lAbha,
etc,  without any *justification* of the sacrificed animal's future, I can
totally accept your stance as above. Unfortunately, verisimilar seems the
need to *justify* the possibility of something cruel done, indirectly
through the recommendation (again, if any) of silk.

That may quite be the case, but I hardly think there has been harm in trying
to check up with the learned list members. :)

Why jump the gun!

Not only others, it interests me too. To clarify, I was not seeking to find
if recommendations and/ or justifications are in my sutra alone; it had
wider scope of shruti, smRti & shAstra. I just chanced upon the VasishTha
sUtra.
