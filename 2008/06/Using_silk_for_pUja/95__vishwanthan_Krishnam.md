I dont know whether there is any injunction prohibiting use of silk, but I do know that there is no recommendation either for the use of it.

Kanchi Mahaperiyaval propagated the use of homespun over silks. 

There are some other texts which mention that using silk provides better results while praying cannot find the references readily

vishwam

Subject: [Advaita-l] Using silk for pUja

praNAm all,

We use silk dhotI and angavastra for sandhyA, pUja, etc. I haven't yet found
any reference to justify the same due to the cruel process of silk
production. Would someone be able to provide information whether Vedas
permit/ recommend usage of silk clothes in pUja and of so, the justification
for the process.

Thanks,
--Praveen R. Bhat
