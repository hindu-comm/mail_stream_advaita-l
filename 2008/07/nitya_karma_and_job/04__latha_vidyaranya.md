that was an interesting explanation of sri bhaskarji about the swadharmaas that may fall under the nitya and naimittika karmas.

but i was talking about the current day jobs that we all do outside our homes to earn a living. the varnaashrama swadharmasare not very strictly followed. brahmins are also into trading and business and vysyas are also into teaching in various educational institutions and there are hardly any wars to be waged by a kshatriya (and the political scene is open to all irrespective of caste, creed or sex) and there is no particular demarcation of jobs to shudraas as they are also well educated now and are into all fields. in this scenario of modern day india / abroad,our earning the bread-butter-jam becomes more of a social obligation to take care of our families and communities and the larger interest of the nation. thus they may not fall under the nitya or naimittika, but surely are bound by the ethical frame of our dharma.

whereas the occupational duties (our daily jobs) are not vaidhika karmas and hence do not fall under either nitya or naimittika karmas. they are vyavahaaric karmas to fulfill the social obligations.

Interestingly, these social obligations or vyAvahArik karma-s are closely linked with one's own *svadharma* & seems to be obligatory!!..Though these karma-s cannot be strictly categorized as either nitya or naimittika karma-s, some smruti texts insisted the strict adherence to karma-s that is based on svadharma...For example, in gIta bhagavan forced arjuna to follow his svadharma i.e. fighting the battle...Being a kshatriya, arjuna had to fight the battle of kurukshEtra and krishna asked him to do the same..Likewise, being a brAhmaNa, one has to regularly perform hOma, havana, yAga-s etc., spread the message of scripture (dharma prachAra) etc because it is his svadharma..and being born as vaishya, one has to do vyavahAra (business) since it is his svadharma....I think, these are all as sri Jaldhar prabhuji pointed out comes under nitya/namittika karma category only...So, these social obligations are part & parcel of one's own svadharma if it is done with
 an aim of protecting the same. (svadharma saMrakshaNArthaM).
