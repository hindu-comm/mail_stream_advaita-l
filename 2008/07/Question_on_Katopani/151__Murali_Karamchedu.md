Dear Senaniji,

I read the text slightly differently...


>'mahatpratyagaatmabhutam' - like/comparable-to the individual-soul called 
>mahat.

I translated  mahatpratyagAtmabhUtam in tebhyopyarthebhyaSca param.
sUkSmataram. mahatpratyagAtmabhUtam. ca manaha as constituted of
mahat as its pratyagAtman

Also,
>"manasah aarambhakam bhutasookShamam" - from manas has started the subtle 
>form of life.

Here, in the sentence manaha SabdavAcyam. manasa Arambakam.
bhUtasUkSmam, I took bhUtasUkSmam as a shashTI-tatpurusha; so that
would be bhUtasya + sUkSmam = bhUtasUkSmam (like vrkSasya mUlam. =
vrkSamUlam. ). So, I read it as manaha  manasa Arambakam SabdavAcyam.
bhUtasya sUkSmam. ( i.e manas, meaning the subtle entity of the gross
object(s) such as speech etc which originated from the manas.)
