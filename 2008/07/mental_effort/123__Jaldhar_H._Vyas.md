Of course Brahman has to be known (not experienced Brahman is experienced 
by all beings at all times.  Most don't know it.) but why this unnecessary 
prejudice against books?

If you read a shastra you are receiving sensory input from a physical 
organ (namely the eyes) which is converted into thought and understood to 
a lesser or greater degree based on your intellect.  If you listen to the 
words of a jnani you are receving sensory input from a physical organ (the 
ears) which is converted into thought and understood to a lesser or 
greater degree based on your intellect.  What is the difference?

It is even more absurd if one objects to "mere teachers" reproducing what 
is read.  Especially considering it is usually done by oral instruction. If 
Rshi Yajnavalkya is a jnani and his teachings are recorded 
how is somone telling you that any less a "direct experience" than if 
some contemporary tells you their "direct experience" face to face?

I think all this "experience" talk is just an excuse for illiteracy.
