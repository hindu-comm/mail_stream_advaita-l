And what about those who have yet to cross?  We do not care for them? 
Those jnanis who only care about their own mukti remain silent for 
they truly have no use for words.  But the moment you bring another person 
into the picture, you are back to vyavahara and all its rules apply.

The analogy is faulty because brahman has no gunas like sweetness.  It 
always just is.  Either one understands this or one doesn't.  Whether the 
catalyst for understanding is a written shastra or a spoken shastra makes 
no difference.

If he doesn't know the word sweet what is he getting others to taste? 
Maybe poison inadvertantly?  His subjective personal experience is useless 
to anyone else if it cannot be communicated.
