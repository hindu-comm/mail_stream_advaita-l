Dear Kuntimaddi Sadananda

1.There is no-one who can tell something which is not a half-truth. The
absolute truth cannot be expressed anyway. People who say they can, are
fooling themselves and everybody who listen to them. I just write what I
think in a particular moment because I want to share with all you friends
which have similar interests. I don't pretend to tell the truth. I know I
can't. Nobody can.

2.If you talk about mind and real self separately what does that mean? How
can these two can be separated?
And by the way, what is that which needs to be purified if there is only
Brahman?
You talk about mind which needs to purified. I think there is no such thing
as a purified mind. I don't believe to people who say that they have
purified their mind. The mind is  not in anybody's control. If there exists
any mind  at all (which I sincerely doubt)  who is there to  direct its
activities? The mind thinks whatever "it wants".

3.My guru, Sri Nisargadatta Maharaj, said that the only true teacher is ones
own self. I believe that. So I need no other teacher.


I enjoy very much discussing these topics with you and I am grateful for
this opportunity.


Wish you all the best!

Marko
