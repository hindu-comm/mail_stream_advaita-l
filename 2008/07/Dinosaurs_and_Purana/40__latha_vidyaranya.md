all that our science proves is not the eternal truth. what was proved scientifically a hundred years ago to be the truth gets disproved another hundred years later by some other research group who claim their discovery is the 'latest truth' ! and all human discoveries are bound by the limited perception of human mind and sensory apparatus. they are 'pourusheya'. whereas, our smruthi and puraanaas are based on shruthi or vedas whichare apourusheya and hence contain the eternal truth. where physics ends meta physics begins. 

for that matter, i don't think musquitos or cockroaches are mentioned in puraanaas. the general term 'srishti' or 'creation' encompasses all that was / is / going to bein the Brhmaanda. 

interesting thread ! sure to bring out a smile on the many serious faces of List members :))

Namaste Suresh,
         Dinosaurs became extinct around 65 million years ago. I am not sure
whether any of our Puranas and Ramayana refer to that old an era.
Scientifically speaking, dinosaurs and humans (or for that matter, any of
the *homo* species) did not coexist. So, there can be no mention about
dinosaurs in our scriptures.


The reason I find this important from a spiritual angle is because, if our

I doubt whether all the things mentioned in our scriptures comply with
modern science. So, it is up to every individual to decide for him/herself
whether or not to accept the scriptures as authentic. IMVHO, it is the
philosophy in the scriptures that is important and, not the technical
details.

HTH.
Learned members, kindly CMIIW.
