i have listened to ghana paata recitations and they are extremely musical to the ears. when the mantras are recited with the sandhis split, it brings in more clarity and it becomes more meaningful and understandable. i am sure those who learn the ghana recitation learn to pause inbetween sentences and will have time to focus on its meaning too. and as another reader has pointed out, it increases the level of concentration in the reciter as he eagerly waits for his turn to pick up from where the other ends. otherwise the recitationtend to becomemechanical. the ghana makes the recitation more competative and robust.
