Hari Om

We can also say that Ghana Phatam is in a way very wise encryption  
algorithm for Akshara and Swara Shudhi.

I mean look at the way they have slowly incremented the algorithm from  
Kramam, Jadai to Ghana.

This could be one of the prime reasons that we are still having the  
Akshara and swara in purity in Veda recital.

It could also be very imperative for a teacher when he has to split  
big sentences in simpler Padas to teach the vedic beginners.
