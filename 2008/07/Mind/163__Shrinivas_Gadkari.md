Namaste Marko,

It is good to see the intuitive insights that you have been sharing with
us. 

Many times our intuitive insights into spiritual matters change/ ripen
with time. It may be a good idea for you to jot down your flashes of
insight in your notes. Wait for some weeks and then re-read your
insights to checkif you still feel the same. If these insights stand this
simple test, please share them with us.

Regards,
Shrinivas

Namaste
The mind will always try to tell you that you are not self-realised
yet. Don't believe it. It will always put new conditions. With
self-realisation the mind still works the same old way. It always
wants something different from what is there.
