I have been reciting chandi but may be I have not been following correct
procedure. There are various procedure suggested in different books.

praNAms
Hare Krishna

As far as I know, there is no hard & fast rule to do chandi pArAyaNa...it
mainly depends upon one's own traditional procedure or  tradition which has
been followed by his/her guru.  Here, in my circle, we follow parAyana as
you told, first deepaarAdhana, gaNEshArchana, paNchOpachAra pooja to
pArAyaNa graNTha, then kavachArgala keelakam, navArNa nyAsa, vEdOkta &
taNtrOkta rAtri sUktaM & 13 chapter of chandi, then vEdOkta & tantrOkta
dEvi sUkta (ambhruNi sUkta) & rahasya traya....When we are doing chandi
hOma according to kAtyAyani taNtra prior to that we strictly follow the
pArAyaNa as per the above procedure with arghya pAtrAdi sAdhana, sthApana &
archana  ( for arghya we use milk, honey, ashtagaNdha etc.) .  But when we
do mere parAyaNa, if there is any time constraints, we recite only madhyama
charitra i.e. 2nd, 3rd & 4th adhyAya with saMputeekaraNa of rAtri & dEvi
sUkta-s.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
