Ishwara does not give fruits of our karma as he pleases. He is only a dispenser of fruits. He dispenses according to the fruition of our karmas. some seeds give out sapling soon, the plant grows up fast and yields fruits fast.. some seeds are very slow in bringing out the sapling, the plant's growth is also slow and slow is the process of it yielding fruit.

if the seed itself is diseased, we can only expect a diseased plant and a diseased fruit out of it. but there are methods to cure the diseases or atleast minimize the damages, is it not? thats what the chanting of stotras, poojas etc do. 

sri sri Chandrashekhara Bharathi Swamiji mentions that it was with our own free will that we had committed the earlier karma and if it has started resulting in poor outcome now, try to exert heavier force through much stronger free will now to annihilate the bad effects. stotras chanted with utmost devotion and sincerity have this doubled force to annul the effects of earlier karma. instead of a rock falling on the head, a smaller stone may fall causing lesser injury.

why the period of fruition vary? - well, a cough and cold virus can attack immediately and the person starts sneezing and coughing immediately. whereas, a chicken pox virus has an incubation period of 15 days and then you see the person start suffering with chicken pox. in case of HIV virus, it lurks in the body for over 8 to 10 years after which the full blown manifestation of AIDS disease is seen. similar is the ripening of fruits of our karmas..

1. Does the phala-sutras of many stotras, saharasnamams, stuties etc. exaggerate
100% that sins will be expunged if the stotras etc. recited with bhakti, when
the fact is law of karma is inexorable.
******
The chanting of these stotras itself is another karma if done with devotion and
diligence - the fruit of which will be a partial neutralization of the effects
of prior bad actions.
No amount of karma can ever wipe off the entire slate of accumulated karmas -
jnAna alone is capable in that regard.
*******
2. Does Hindu dharma subscribe to retribution (because it is said that Ishwara
will be otherwise partial towards some if he doesnt give the fruits of karma to
sinngers)
*******
Yes and no. Hindu dharma lays more emphasis on forgiveness than on retribution.
 The mind that simmers with thoughts of retribution, howsoever justifiable,
destroys itself first. Ishwara can be quietly entrusted with the task without
my seeking or 'enabling' it!
*******
4. If retribution is necessary to punish sinners, why does Ishwara wait for
eons to dish out the punishment?  Does that mean we can get out of the rut by
good behaviour in future and realising the earlier folly of sins and making
necessary amends.

5. If law of karma is such a cut and dry propisition, why does Ishwara maintain
that tattva exclusively in his hand (as stated in various hymns
"punya-apunya phalaprada")
*********
Ishwara is not other than His very Order. The very Order - everperfect blesses
us with its results - pleasant or unpleasant - either way its a blessing alone
coming as it does from the Order that is Ishwara alone.
Time it takes to fructify is relative - if you consider our entire lifetime is
as transient as a flash of lightning then you realize that we face our
karmaphalas sooner than we may perhaps like!
In this context the One Deity who best represents duritA is Shani Bhagawan(born
of Surya - Brahman and Chaya- Maya/AvidyA!!) and he is symbolically personified
with a limp showing how slow_moving He is!
