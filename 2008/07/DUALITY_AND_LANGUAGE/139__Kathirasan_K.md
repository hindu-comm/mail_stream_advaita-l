Namaste Marko,

Heat can cook your food and also burn you. While you are trying to
convince yourself that it only burns, do not forget that it can cook a
good meal for you too. The neo-vedantins appear to be averse to words
while Traditional Vedantins use the very words such that it becomes a
useful tool in communicating Self Knowledge. This is the unique
methodology of Vedanta which can produce a tradition of teachers
capable of living this wisdom.
