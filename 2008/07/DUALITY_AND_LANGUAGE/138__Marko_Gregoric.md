Dear friends!

I think duality is simply a product of language because (at least in the
languages I know) there is always the distinction subject-object. Therefore
almost every sentence written or spoken  creates this illusion of duality.
Language is  a beautiful thing as far as we use it for practical things. But
it become useless for the topics discussed in this group. How can we destroy
the illusion of duality with a tool (language) that creates duality all the
time?

Best wishes!

Marko
