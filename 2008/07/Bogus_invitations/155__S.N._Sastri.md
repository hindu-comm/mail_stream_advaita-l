Dear Sriram,
I recd an invitation from Sridevi to join some group. These are bogus
invitations. As soon as you agree, the person who sent the original
invitation  is able to access our address book and send invitaions to all
addresses in the book. This is with some ulterior motive. Pl do not accept
such invitations. Merely delete them. Inform Sridevi also.
Hope you sre all well.l.
Thatha
