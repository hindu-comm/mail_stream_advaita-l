You are making a very elementary error of logic known in colloquial 
English as "comparing apples and pears."  From the conventional time-bound 
viewpoint it is totally legitimate to speak of reached and not yet 
reached or in and out of Brahman.  It is only from the viewpoint of 
brahman itself that there is non-duality.  You have to pick a frame of 
reference and stick to it.

Ok that's true.  But the subject under discussion was whether speech was 
useful in reaching brahman.  And what you wrote doesn't alter the fact 
that yes it is.

It is not knowledge that is ignorance but _false_ knowledge.  It is 
through intellect that we gain viveka -- the ability to distinguish 
between the two.  You are throwing out the baby with the bath water if you
throw out all knowledge indiscriminately.
