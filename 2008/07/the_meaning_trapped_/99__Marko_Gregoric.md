Dear Anbu


What is the "we" you are talking about stand for? Your real nature doesn't
"deal" with anything. How can you stick to anything? Nothing can even touch
your real nature. If you say "we" that implies there is somebody there. Who
is there except maya?
The mistaken idetification with the body-mind organism is the only problem
which is worth of discussion.

Thank you!

Marko
