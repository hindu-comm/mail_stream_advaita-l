hari om
namaste

different words have different meanings. but the light that illumines the meaning of these different words is the one and the only ONE. May be there are things that remain unknown to some people. but there can not be any thing unknown that is beyond our vedas. they are all-inclusive. and to the rishis of yore who had a one pointed zeal to know the unknown, it was revealed. till the point the magician decides to remove the mystery shrouded under the veil, it remains magical! once the veil is removed, the essence is untrapped and the magic, the magician and the viewer of the magic merge.

namaste

dear Anbu
I agree that it makes no sense. That is the magic of the unknown. How
can you know? You have no way to know. Mind only can know and you are
not the mind, you have no way to know anything.

Marko
