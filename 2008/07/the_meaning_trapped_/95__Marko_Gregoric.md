Dear Latha

You are not a man. Whoever told you you are a man poured you with ignorance.
Humans use words, they have their knowledge, their ignorance, but you are
well beyond that. Every text, even the wisest one, goes from human to human.
But this is all in the field of consciousness, beyond which your eternal
abode is and will always be untouched by men's life.

namaste

Marko
