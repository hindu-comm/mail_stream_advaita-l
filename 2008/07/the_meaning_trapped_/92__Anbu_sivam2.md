Marko, you have a problem.  If something remains always unknown, how do you
know it is there?

You cannot say there is something out there but no one can know!  Whether we
would name it or not, it makes no sense.

In Tamil there is a saying "POgaatha oorukku vazhi thEdaathE!".  It means if
there is a town to which no one had gone, then don't bother looking for a
road to it!
