Lathaji,

I agree about the revealation, however what is revealed is never to the mind
as the mind is incapable of grasping it.

A Rishi explains to us (which we assume has necessarily to be through the
mind) of what was revealed yet mind does not know of what it speaks!  The
mind in this case is at least reduced to an instrument of communication.  We
could in this instance agree with Marko that mind speaks of that which it
doesn't know.  But then when we speak of the Rishi we fail to notice that
neither the body nor the mind exists for Him!  Who put in a 'mind' for the
Rishi? Such is the wonderous power of the mind!

Anbu
