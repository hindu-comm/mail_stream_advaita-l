I never suggested that words don't have meaning. (Nor did I suggest that speech has no purpose.) I only said that speech cannot reach brahman. Marko mentioned the gIta and I don't remember if this idea is presented there. But I do remember this idea being presented in an upanishad, so I mentioned it.
