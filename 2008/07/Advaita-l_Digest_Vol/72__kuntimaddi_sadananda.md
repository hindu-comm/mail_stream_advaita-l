Devanathanji - praNAms and thanks for your views. I have no disagreements with your understanding. 'brahmasuutra padainschaiva.. of Gita sloka can also be interpreted, not relating to Badarayana's brahmasuutra. Thanks for clarifying Madhusudhana's assertion about Brahmasuutras. That the second Chapter of Brahmasuutra is not the negation of Buddhistic doctrin is news to me. 

Hari Om!
Sadananda
