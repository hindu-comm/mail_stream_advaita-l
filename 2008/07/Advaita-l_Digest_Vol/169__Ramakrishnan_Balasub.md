The original was published by Tanjore Saraswati Mahal. You should be
able to get that from a good academic library. But realize that the
version available to the Ramanshram (Krishnamurthi Iyer's
condensation) was quite different from the Mahal's version. One of the
Ramanamaharshi "inspired" people brought out an English translation of
the Mahals version - but did not include the Sanskrit text.
