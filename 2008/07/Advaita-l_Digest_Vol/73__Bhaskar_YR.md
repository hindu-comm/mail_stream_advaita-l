That the second Chapter of Brahmasuutra is not the negation of Buddhistic
doctrin is news to me.

praNAms
Hare Krishna

Ofcourse, in the vedanta sUtra-s there is a talk & negation of various
schools like sAnkhya, yOga, vaishEshika, pAshupata, pAncharAtra, bauddha,
jaina etc. But at the same time it is not clear which particular work of
these schools, the author of sUtra-s negating here.  As said earlier,
sUtrakAra (bAdarAyaNa)  himself mentions the name of *vyAsa* when it comes
to smruti texts.  So, IMO, we cannot unconditionally conclude that vyAsa =
bAdarAyaNa.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
