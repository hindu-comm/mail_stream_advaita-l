Hari OM~
Shri Sada ji,

I'm not saying that the Avirodadhyaya does not mention Buddhism at all. I
only advocate that Badarayana systematically argued against the root ideas
on which Buddhism developed its philosophy much later. Most of the ideas of
Ajivakas, Nairatma vadins and skepticism are mentioned even in Mahabharata.
Buddha only continued to channelize his ideas in line with some of the
earlier anti-Vedic thinkers like Purana Kassapa, Makkali Gosala, Ajita
kesakambalin and certain others. It was Sankaracarya who promptly
consolidated the later Buddhist views and argued against them right under
the corresponding sutras of Badarayana. Any attempt to assert that
Badarayana's Brahma Sutra has direct reference to (popular) Buddhism and its
sub-schools (like Madhyamika, Sautrantika etc) is subjected to serious
Chronological distortions causing chronic misapprehensions on the
traditional accounts.

With Narayana Smrti,
Devanathan.J
