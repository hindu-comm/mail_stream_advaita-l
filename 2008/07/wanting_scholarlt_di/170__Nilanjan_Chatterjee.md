Sir,
 I believe that the ideas of Shankaracharya regarding prasthan
trayi(Upanishad-the shruti prasthan,Gita- the smriti prasthan and
Brahmasutra of Ved Vyas-the darshan prasthan) are totally correct ,while
those of Ramanujacharya, and other Vaishnav, Shaiva, Shakti etc sects which
are not same as that of Shankaracharya , are not totally correct- but,they
are 100% correct that Bhakti gives Moksha because Bhakti removes all the
sins and then aotomatically Gyan comes and Gyan itself is Moksha..
I want these types of scholarly discussions.
