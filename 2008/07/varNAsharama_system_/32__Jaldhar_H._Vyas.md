Well, we should clarify that Shankaracharya is only accepting the argument 
rhetorically to show its invalidity.  We cannot say on the basis of this 
passage alone whether he personally agreed with it or not.  The evidence 
(such as the next adhikarana as you pointed out) suggests that he didn't.

He does clearly acknowledge we do not interact directly with the Gods 
these days as they did in ancient times.
