After all, the Mimamsaka could say that injunctions which he is so
interested in such as those related to varnashrama dharma are also not
performed strictly to the description in the shastras these days.  Does
this mean they were never observed properly in the past?  Does that mean
they are not to be taken seriously?

humble sAshtAnga praNAms Sri Jaldhar vyas prabhuji

Thanks a lot for your kind clarification & detailed reply prabhuji.  Since
shankara did not raise any objections with regard to *avyavasTha* of
varNashrama system & interestingly he frames his counter arguments  by
*accepting* the disorder in the system of varNAshrama.....actually that
drew my attention...

Thanks onceagain for your time prabhuji.

Your humble servant
Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
