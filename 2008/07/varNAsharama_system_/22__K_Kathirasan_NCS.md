Namaste Lathaji,

You have discussed a very controversial topic beautifully. However, when discussing Sankara's views we must bear in mind that Sankara very much followed the stipulations of the Dharmasastra of his times when writing his bhasyas and granthas. I would not blame him for sticking to the norms laid by the Dharmsasastras because we too at present adhere to the societal norms of today as much as we can when conducting our daily lives. Sankara did the same during his time because women were not taught the Vedas during his times and hence would be assumed to be not capable of understanding the cryptic verses of the Vedas. Hence, the smrtis are recommended for their study and spiritual evolution. 

In fact Sankara's disciple Suresvara disagrees with Sankara on the eligibility of Sannyasa for dvijas in his varttika. This comes to show that Dharma is not entirely static. For example, one Dharma sastra permitted even the upanayana samskara for women. 

However, even today people will quote the sruti and smrti to show support that women are barred from Vedic study. And then there is another school that would show support from sruti and smrti that women are permitted to study the Veda. The former believe that all Dharmas are static while the latter believe that only samanya dharma is static while Visesa Dharma is dynamic. 

Sankara's statement referring to 'stri, bala and jada' is bound by time, place and circumstances if we were to take it literally. Even the gita has a similar line which considers women as of lower birth (ch 9). However in the case of the implied meaning which you have beautifully shared, the value is timeless. I believe that if Sankara would have written the daksinamurti stotram today, he would have definitely omitted the 'stri' from the string. 

Warmest Regards,
Kathirasan K

why did sri shankara bhagavadpaada include strii along with baala, andha and jada?

let me try to examine with my limited budhdhi :

strii along with baala - baala is a child. children are impulsive and so are women in general. they think with their heart and not always with their head. hence many of their decisions are not logical, but emotion driven. perhaps the shaatraic studies require a logical mind and hence sri shankara might have felt that women are childish.

strii with andha - andha is blind.and may beshort sightedness can also come under this. again for the same reason as above, women's emotions cloud their reasoning. many times they may act impulsively without thinking of the longterm consequences. and becoz of this emotionality, perhaps women develop stronger attachments towards others than men. and this attachment or moha can also blind them many times.

strii with jada - jada can mean a person with limited intellectual capacity or intellectually challenged. women in general were expected to play the role of a wifeand a mother and were bound to home and hearth. to manage a family, more than intellectual intelligence, emotional intelligence is required, which a woman has in abundance compared to a man. and there were seldom occasions when a strii could exhibit her intellect to the outside world. to study shastra and understand the width and depth of it, certain level of intellectual shrpnessis required. perhaps sri shankara thought that women lacked it in general.

the closeness that sri shankara had with the only woman in life was with his mother. she was widowed when sri shankara was very very young (i think just 3 years old) and i am sure, like any other woman, she held shankara very close to her heart and had developed such a strong attachment to him, the only apple of her eyes, that she was very reluctant to let-go of him when he sought her permission to take up sanyaasa (the mohaandhakaara must have made her not see the noble cause of sanyaasa). only that crocodile incident made her agree to his sanyaasa as she felt that atleast she could see her son alive than gone. and before he left for his studies, in search of a guru, she elicited the promise from him to come and be with her during her final moments. a perfect tear-jerker story ! an abundance of women's emotionality than tough logic. 

all the above must have made sri shankara include strii in the set of baala, andha and jada.
the sentence is only a generalisation and there are always exceptions. now a days the exceptions seem to have become the rule !

i have tried to answer this question as objectively as possible without falling in line with baala, andha or jada. i am not that well versed in sanskrit as to read and understand the shankara bhaashya on sri dakshinaa murthy stotra. may the learned members of the List who have studied the bhaashya throw proper light on this particular sentence in the stotra.

i also believe that there is a purusha in every woman and a srii in every man (the yin and the yang or prakriti and purusha). to study any shastra and understand, i think both the dimensions are equally important. one needs to have the sensibility and the sensitivity. if we can balance the both, we may understand the true perspective of any concept. i am sure sri shankara refers to the to the 'streetva' and 'purushatva' whenever he uses the words stree or purusha.

i am grateful to the List for allowing my comments here, however baala, andha and jada the comments may seem. thanks for the inclusiveness of the List..

namaste

yes, thanks to those whobelieve that 'tvam' in "tat tvam
asi" is all inclusive and hence have an egalitarian view.

when i wrote my comment, i was only remembering incidences when some
peopleused to equate stree with baala, jada, andha (just becoz sri shankara
has made that sentence in one of the stanzas of sri dakshinamurthy stotra) and
used to belittle a woman who was aspiring to realize the ultimate. the word
'people' in my comment does not include people from this List :))

People argue on what they want to agrue. Karma is kama driven. Arguing is
karma too!

Our scriptures clearly say 'Tat Tvam Asi'. It would not have said it
if you didn't have the right to know. 'Tvam' does not exclude
anyone. It is an unconditional 'Tvam'!
