is not the question valid and a legitimate one? the doubt can arise in any reader's mind that needs to be clarified. the doubt had arisen in my mind too and i have found my own clarification that i have stated in another mail.. i think the List allows us to air any doubt regarding any of the works on advaita vedaanta, however silly or impertinent it may seem to others. i do not find anything objectionable in dr yadu airing this question. perhaps my answering a question asked to another person in the List may seem impertinent. sorry, but i am an impulsive answerer (the 'baala' streak evident here?? :))

Namaste Latha-ji:

Why do you think that Acharya encompassed "strii, baala, andha &
jaDa" in one group ?

Regards,

Dr. Yadu

yes, thanks to those who believe that 'tvam' in "tat tvam
asi" is all inclusive and hence have an egalitarian view.

when i wrote my comment, i was only remembering incidences when some
people used to equate stree with baala, jada, andha (just becoz sri shankara
has made that sentence in one of the stanzas of sri dakshinamurthy stotra) and
used to belittle a woman who was aspiring to realize the ultimate. the word
'people' in my comment does not include people from this List :))

People argue on what they want to agrue. Karma is kama driven.  Arguing is
karma too!

Our scriptures clearly say 'Tat Tvam Asi'.  It would not have said it
if you didn't have the right to know.  'Tvam' does not exclude
anyone.  It is an unconditional 'Tvam'!
