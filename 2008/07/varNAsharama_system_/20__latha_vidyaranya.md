hari om
namaste

those were very soothing, balm likewords. i understand stree-s are a privileged class who are extended many concessions by our vedas. but it does prick a little to read words like, "jantoonaam narajanma durlabham, thathaapi pumstvam, tato viprataa.......", but immediately it heals when we go to the next stanza "durlabham trayametat daivaanugraha hetukam manushyatvam (not purusha or stree in particular), mumukshutvam mahaapurusha samshrayam"

so here is manushyattva, mumukshuttva andmahapurushas in the form of List members.......... who can stop me ? :))

namaste

people generally seem to nurse a notion that the vedaadhikaaris have their path to realization paved smooth than the shudraas and stree-s, who have to take a circuitous path through the smruthis and puraanaas and there seems to beless hope for them to reach the ultimate destination, until they take many more janmaas

I think it is otherway round...Our shAstra-s imposes more severe injunctions (vidhi) & prohibitions (nishEdha) to dvijA-s and their path to the ultimate goal is more perilous when compared to non-dvija-s...A small infringement of vEda vihita kArma-s may cause dvija-s more baNdha-s, more saMsAra-s or more cycle of birth and deaths because vEda-s say they are in the front line to uphold our sanAtana dharma..On the other hand, our scriptures showing more lenience to the non-dvija-s & stree-s and give assurance to them of ultimate realization through much easier means. I dont think our vEda-s insist anywhere that non-dvija and stree-s have to have (dvija) purusha janma & sAmpradAyik vEdAdhyayana to attain the self realization...& Shankara would not have given the examples of dharmavyAdha & vidhura if the realization is possible ONLY in dvija janma.. 

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
