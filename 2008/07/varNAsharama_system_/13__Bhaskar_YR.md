Unless & until  situation / context demands for the idiosyncratic meaning
of certain words, in all normal conditions we should go by the words & its
meaning as being used in *lOkArUdhi* sense...Infact, shankara himself
insists this point somewhere in sUtra bhAshya.  If the words like stree,
jada, bAla are being mentioned just to convey some generic observation,
IMO, we should not try to pull out some exceptional meaning out of these
words...In the stOtra this passing remark does not demand any special
interpretation to stretch this far away from its general meaning, so I
think there would be no harm in understanding these terms as elaborated by
Smt. Latha mAtAji.  Anyway, parallelly  I would like to have a look at
*mAnasOllAsa* to see the possibility of any  *special* meaning.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
