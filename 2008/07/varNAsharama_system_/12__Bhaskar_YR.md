people generally seem to nurse a notion that the vedaadhikaaris have their
path to realization paved smooth than the shudraas and stree-s, who have to
take a circuitous path through the smruthis and puraanaas and there seems
to beless hope for them to reach the ultimate destination, until they take
many more janmaas

I think it is otherway round...Our shAstra-s imposes more severe
injunctions (vidhi)  & prohibitions (nishEdha) to dvijA-s and their path to
the ultimate goal is more perilous when compared to non-dvija-s...A small
infringement of vEda vihita kArma-s may cause dvija-s more baNdha-s, more
saMsAra-s or more cycle of birth and deaths because vEda-s say they are in
the front line to uphold our sanAtana dharma..On the other hand, our
scriptures showing more lenience to the non-dvija-s & stree-s and give
assurance to them of ultimate realization through much easier means.  I
dont think our vEda-s insist anywhere that non-dvija and stree-s have to
have (dvija) purusha janma & sAmpradAyik vEdAdhyayana  to attain the self
realization...& Shankara would not have given the examples of dharmavyAdha
& vidhura if the realization is possible ONLY in dvija janma..

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
