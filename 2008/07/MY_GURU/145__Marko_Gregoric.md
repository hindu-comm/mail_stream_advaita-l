Namaste

No matter who is the speaker (I or anybody else) my guru (the Self) doesn't
accept any statement. The statements which I say, hear and/or read would
hang around for some time in my mind but then he would swallow them and
leave me with his pure indescribable bliss alone. Until I die I will be at
His feet.
