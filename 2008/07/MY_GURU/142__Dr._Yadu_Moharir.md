Namaste Marko:

If one accepts what you say then all the works by Acharya would be futile ? Either we will have to classify all thatunder "ignorance" or try to understand what was was the significance behind that ?

Personally I like the advise from Saint Ramdas (King Shivaji's Guru) whorecommended cleansingone's own mind with "guru's words"

Would like to know your perception.

Regards,

Dr. Yadu

 I don't want to fool
nobody, all my emails are written by my ego. At the end they all mean
nothing. They are pure spiritual competition. My guru doesn't accept any of
it. I can only write ignorance.
