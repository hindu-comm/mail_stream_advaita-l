NO!!! Afterwards, it is Sat, Chit Ananda. The knower, the known and the
Means of knowing all merge to the state of sat, chit and Ananda. There
Is no tamas there. So where is the question of ignorance?

The knowledge of the Guru will not destroy the ignorance of the shishya.
The shishya, himself has to shed the ignorance.

Regards,
K. Ramakrishna.

Subject: Re: [Advaita-l] MY GURU

Dear Dr.Yadu

I also needed "an external" guru, Sri Nisargadatta Maharaj who would (with
his words)  put me on the right track towards my real Guru which is my own
self.  I therefore respect the work of everybody who does the same with
other people. Sri Siddharameschwar Maharaj once told that "Knowledge is the
greatest ignorance". I am not in position to judge anybody's words but I
certainly believe what he told.
Until there is ignorance the knowledge (of the guru) is needed to destroy
it. After that it becomes ignorance itself.


Best wishes!
Marko
