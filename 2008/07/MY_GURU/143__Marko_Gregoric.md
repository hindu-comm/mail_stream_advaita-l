Dear Dr.Yadu

I also needed "an external" guru, Sri Nisargadatta Maharaj who would (with
his words)  put me on the right track towards my real Guru which is my own
self.  I therefore respect the work of everybody who does the same with
other people. Sri Siddharameschwar Maharaj once told that "Knowledge is the
greatest ignorance". I am not in position to judge anybody's words but I
certainly believe what he told.
Until there is ignorance the knowledge (of the guru) is needed to destroy
it. After that it becomes ignorance itself.


Best wishes!
Marko
