Dear All:

In the light of current discussions on Guru, Meaning, RealizationI wanted to bringfollowing disturbing newsto the attention of list members.

Some of you may have alreadyseen this FOX News? You tube video's of the Fox 5 Report onCommander Selvam on how he has been scamming the Hindu community in the USA.

Exposing the TemplePriests (Moron Swami's)are poisoning US and I believe should be a much higher priority for NRI's otherwise all our discussions will remain purely academic value in the Dearm domain of Deep Sleep. Recognizing the problems and addressing them promptly may help our future generations.

How true is the statement from B. Franklin: 

Tricks and treachery are the practice of fools, that don't have brains enough to be honest. Benjamin Franklin

Statement from mahaabhaarata applies appropriately to the above news item.

sa~NkShepo nItishAstrANAmavishvAsaH paro mataH . 
nR^iShu tasmAdavishvAsaH puShkala.n hitamAtmanaH || ma. bhaa. shaanti parva 138. 187 ||

Itshould be our absolutely duty topreserve our heritage, at the same token we should learn from our scriptures what they really stand for? If this is notdone then the purposewill only have an academic value. We give too much importance to chanting but a closer examination ravels the associated significance. JaytapaaTha, padapaaTha, rkhipaaTha, rathapaTha ..... etc were devised by our ancestors to retain the integrity of the original text just like we commonly use encryption coding software to communicate confidential information. Finally, it is up to us to deciphethe associated significance as illustrated by our ancestors.

My apologies to the Moderators for having stepped outside the domain of Shankara's Advaita.

Regards,

Dr. Yadu
