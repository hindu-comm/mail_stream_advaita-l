Hi Suresh,

Thanks for sharing this ! I have gone thru an exact similar phase weeks ago.
I have finally decided ignore these experiences. It occurs to me that these
experiences don't matter at all as long as I don't live with this truth. So
I still meditate on the same principle as you are doing without becoming the
experience but remain as a witness to these effects (I try).

I request the evolved souls to please advise on this...

yours
Murali
