Namaste,
Thanks for sharing your experiences with meditation. 
I am no expert on this topic. However, here are some thoughts 
that might be useful in general:
1. Whether we like it or not there exists a chakra system in
our body.
2. A normal person (without too much or with no sAdhanA) 
typically operates from the level of mulAdhAra and svAdhisThAna
chakra-s.
3. Make not mistake about this: Retaining the ability to
operate from the level of these two chakra-s is VERY important
for smooth functioning of our vyAvahArika life.
4. When we venture into sAdhanA (without guru), we start exploring
the realm of operation from higher chakra-s. In this process we
tend to WEAKEN our connection with the lower chakra-s.
If we operate in our vyavahArika life from the level of
higher chakra-s some amount of chaos/ failures are bound
to happen
5. Hence the necessity of guru and guru bhakti.
This is not to discourage meditation. Just be careful and if possible
keep bhakti ongoing.
Regards,
Shrinivas

Friends,
I see a very good conversation going on, and I don't want to butt in.
However, I feel compelled to ask for some advice reg. the type of meditation I've been doing lately, because I don't know where else to turn. Brahman Satya, Jagat Mithya...this is the basis of my meditation. What I do is, I try to see the falsity (mithyatva) of all that comes into my mind (which indirectly makes the seer alone true, satya). 
Results vary on each occasion, when I do this. Sometimes, I am bored and abandon practice. Sometimes, I experience hypnagogic images, and once I experienced sleep paralysis. Last week, I experienced lucid dreaming. But since then, there has been no experience at all. This, in short, has been my experience in meditation.
Any ideas/insights on all this?
Regards,
Suresh
