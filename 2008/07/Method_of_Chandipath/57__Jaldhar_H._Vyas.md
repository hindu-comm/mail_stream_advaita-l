Yes there are different traditions.  That is why it is best to get a Guru 
who is knowledgeable to give you proper advice.  For what its worth this 
is the way I was taught to do a full path.

first purvangavidhi:

* sankalpa, ganeshpuja, kalash/dipa/asana sthapana etc. The same
   preliminaries you would do in any puja.
* pustaka puja (to the actual book that is being read from.)
* shapoddhara/utkilana mantras japa
* kavacha stotra
* argala stotra
* kilaka stotra
* ekadasha nyasa
* ratrisukta (from the first adhyaya of Chandi)
* one full mala of navarna mantra japa

Then the purva, madhyama, and uttara charitas each with their dhyana.

Then uttarangavidhi:

* uttara nyasa
* devisukta (from the fifth adhyaya)
* one full mala of navarna mantra japa
* pradhanika rahasya stotra
* vaikrtika rahasya stotra
* murti rahasya stotra
* utkilana mantra japa
* kshamapana stotra
* siddhakunjika stotra

If there isn't time for the entire chandipatha to be repeated, recite the 
madhyama charita only (with purva, and uttara angas)  Or the four stotras 
in the chandipatha: can be recited independantly without additional 
vidhis.  They are:

* ratrisukta (1st adhyaya)
* shakradaya stuti (4th adhyaya)
* devisukta (5th adhyaya)
* narayani stuti (11th adhyaya)

But other combinations of chapters should not be recited.
