Absolutley Not. They are all just means, mere steps to drop the false self (Ego)
If you can drop your ego (your mind) nothing more...
That would be like taking a leap instead of taking steps...

Atleast this is what I(Who? again I...)have understood

Dear friends

Is "absolute reality" achievable only for those of us who have the
possibility to read and understand the sacred texts?

Thank you
