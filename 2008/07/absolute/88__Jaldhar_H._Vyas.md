No.  Absolute reality always is.  What shastras or Guru upadesh do is 
work negatively to destroy the ignorance that veils the absolute reality.

We have discussed this before on the list but it is worth mentioning 
again.  The advaita in advaita vedanta does not mean "one" but "not-two" 
we must start with the conventional reality (vyavahArika satya) that we 
experience on a day to day basis and work up to absolute reality 
(paramArthika satya)
