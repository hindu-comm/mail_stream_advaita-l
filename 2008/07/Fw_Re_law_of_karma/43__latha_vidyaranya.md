as long as we perceive ourselves as a body-mind complex, Ishwara remains separate, or rather we perceive Ishwara to be a separate entity from us who is dispensing to usthe fruits of our karmas and driving our lives. this is standing at a lower rung of the evolutionary ladder.

for somebody who has climbed the top rung of the ladder and realized the "aham brahmasmi" tattva, the ladder itself does not exist, nor a separate identity from that of Ishwara. both would merge then. then there would be no need for making entries in advaita List here!

Can you please help me understand why you aretrying to perceive ishvra as being separate from you ? Dose this not go against the primary foundation of advaita "aham brahmaaasmi".

Thank You,
