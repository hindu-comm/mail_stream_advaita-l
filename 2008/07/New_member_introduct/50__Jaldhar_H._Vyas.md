I recently met someone who exposed me to Advaita Vedanta via The Book of 
One inside the context of planning a trip to India together which has 
since been delayed. I'm interested in learning how practioners are present 
to this way of being in their lives, challenges and joys of practice. I 
started meditating again, having abandoned a TM practice that I first 
began over 30 years ago as a college student.

Thank you.
