> Dear Advaita-L members,
>
> It gives me great pleasure to bring the following site to the attention
> of this list.
>
> The website of the Sringeri Sarada Peetham (www.sringeri.net) has
> started a new "Sadhana" section coinciding with Guru Purnima and the
> beginning of this year's Chaturmasya. This is in a question and answer
> format and will feature advice on various aspects of sAdhana, as given
> by senior sAdhaka-s and pundits at Sringeri and approved by the current
> Sringeri Acharya, Swami Sri Bharati Tirtha, himself. This new section
> can be accessed at www.sringerisharadapeetham.org/sadhana/index.php.
>
> The section opens with Sankaracharya's Upadesha Panchakam in beautifully
> rendered Devanagari script and features the first question on general
> guidelines for a sincere aspirant to advaita jnAna. More questions and
> their answers will be added to the site on a regular basis.
>
> This new section is a result of the efforts of students at the Sringeri
> Pathashala, who have created and are maintaining the Sringeri Peetham's
> website, as also a few other volunteers. On this list and others, while
> we avidly discuss complicated and intellectual questions in Vedanta, we
> often lose sight of the basics. It is my hope that many of us will
> personally benefit from the Sadhana section updates on the Sringeri
> website.

> Best regards,
