A general query regarding Sringeri. A few years back there was a lot
of publicity regarding a new "Veda-Vedanta Gurukulam" being opened in
Guntur district of Andhra under the auspices of the Sringeri Peetha.
In terms of sheer scale, it was a fairly large project, to be built
over some 1,500 acres of land.

I wonder what happened to the project subsequently. My own inquiries
haven't revealed much and people hardly seem to be aware of it. If at
all it came up, it seems to have been scaled down substantially.

Any updates would be much appreciated

Ramesh
