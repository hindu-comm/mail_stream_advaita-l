Dear Marko,

when I read your statement "That by which the 'I'sense is perceived or
known..", questions such as 'by who' and 'why should it be perceived at all'
etc. arose.  Yet it is no use. I give up!  I have no idea what you are
talking about.  Hope you know and are happy with it.  Please don't explain
to me any further.  I am not interested.

Regards,
Anbu
