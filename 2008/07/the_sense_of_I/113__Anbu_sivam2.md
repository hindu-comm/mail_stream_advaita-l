Dear Marko,

The 'i' and other 'objects' do not float in Consciousness. If that be so
then we have to conclude that 'Consciousness' has parts.  If Consciousness
has parts then other attributes such as going to sleep and waking up etc.
can also belong to the Consciousness.  Such a 'consciousness' then cannot be
beyond the 'prakrthi'.  When we talk of 'Consciousness' there is nothing
apart from it even as its own parts.  Therefore 'i' and the 'objects' are
asat or non-existence.  We talk of 'i' (which is the ego) and the 'objects'
empirically.  In doing so we find that the objects are given to senses and
to the mind without which no perception is made.  When perception takes
place, the perceiver is the 'i' and those that are perceived are the
'objects'.  In this setup the 'i' is constant and the 'objects' are
changing.  In this setup it is the 'i' that goes to sleep and drowns the
'objects' in darkness and as it wakes up it projects them back.  What has to
be understood here is that the 'Consciousness' is ever awake and never
sleeps and it is the light in which both 'i' and the 'objects' shine.  It,
the 'i' by going into sleep creates darkness for itself in which both 'i'
and 'objects' are drowned.

In the light of the above you have to re-examine your statement
"(Consciousness) Waking up from deep sleep, for example, gives birth to the
sense of "I" together with everything else."  What makes you go to sleep and
also to wake up is the power of Maya. No one has ever explained how sleeping
and waking up takes place.  Anything said about them is mere approximation.
Maya itself is undescribeable, anirvachaneeya.
