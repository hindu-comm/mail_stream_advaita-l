Dear friends

I think the purpose of discussion is the pleasure of making new friends. I
see no other point because reality will allways stay away from words. Words
create illusion, and "advaita words" are simply a beautiful illusion. In
order to do take care for my family I have to stay in illusion. The
beautiful words of my guru make the illusion a better place.

Regards

Marko
