He doesn't mention the source either.  In fact I doubt the author 
understands very much about Advaita Vedanta at all with statements like
"Many people mistake the Self (Atman) for ParabrahmanA[sic]"  On the 
contrary the problem is not enough people recognize the Atman is ParabrahmA!

There are all kinds of people claiming to represent Advaita Vedanta 
nowadays.  They are not always telling the truth.
