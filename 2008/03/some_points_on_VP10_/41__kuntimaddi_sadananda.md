PraNAms to all. 

Since the comments of Michael was posted in advaitin list and forwarded to this
list, the response I gave for that I am coping here - for the benefit of those
who want to follow the discussion - I am not sure it is good idea to have cross
postings. Anyway here are my comments since Michael forwarded his comments to
this list.

Yes - the divisions in the mind are in the next part that I have to post. I am
keeping one post a week since they are too long.

The first part of your comment - As I discussed before that mind goes out along
with the senses only with respect to two senses (visual and audio) the rest of
these stay where they are. But the statement that attributes are only
superposition on the substantive is independent of whether mind goes out or
stays there. It follows from:
Sarvam khalu idam brahma - all this is Brahman and Brahman is the upaadaana
kaaraNa for the world of objects. Hence Brahman is the adhiShTanam and
superimpositions are attributes - just as ring on gold. Conscious-existence
Brahman is the substantive and attributes of the objects that the senses and
themind along with senses (whether going out or staying there) gather. Then
only the statement of VP that the subject consciousness unites the object for
perceptualaty makes sense to me. All object knowledge is only attributive
knowledge since Brahman is all pervading as substantive of pramAta, Prameya and
pramANa.

True - that is simplified dharma - I should do to others what I want other to
do to me and I should not do to others what I do not want others not to do me
- simplified ethical living. But dharma is much more deeper - hence we have
dharma shastras. VP addreses these in response to question earlier where dharma
is known through others statements or through their results in terms of good or
bad but not directly. 

Purvamiimaamsa starts - athAthO dharma gijnaasa - Hence enquiry into nature of
dharma which of course dictates one's karma too. Arjuna's problem was based on
dharma -kArpanya dhoshopa hataswabhaavaH, prucchaamitvaam dharma smmuuDha
cEtaaH - I am not able to know what is my dharma - to fight or not to fight. 
Hence we have shaatras determining dharma. swadharmE nidhanam shreyaH - says
Krishna.

Michael - true - attributes are not free floating. But the substantive is Sat
only; hence they are locussed on sat. The senses can only measure the
attributes, the sat is ever present and infinite. When the senses gather the
attributes they get locussed in the vRitti - vRitti is a thought the contents
are the attributes - the substantive is caitanyam in terms of
conscious-existent. The theory of knowledge rests on senses gathering
attributes for external perceptions. For internal perceptions the attributes
are there inherent in the vRitti that is formed. All perceptual knowlede is
attributive knowledge only - hence it is direct and immediate. 

The relation between visheshaNa and visheshya in advaita is only adhyaasa since
the vishshya to the core is Brahman only - upAdAna kaaraNa - There is no other
material in the universe. Hence object is attributes + Brahman - otherwise we
will end up with duality as reality. That is the only way I understand the
janmaadhyasya yathaH - suutra - and all sRiShTi prakaraNas in the Upanishads. 

I am glad you brought these issues. We agree or not, it will help others to
think deeply the truths that are being discussed - That is important for the
discussion - especially when the posts are too long even to read! 

Hari Om!
