Thanks very much prabhu, I greatly appreciate your answer.  But honestly your answer also points out the illusionary nature.  The very last statement of yours  "Even God who we assume to be a creator, maintainer, and destroyer is in fact none of those and it is ignorance which causes the false assumption".  If mind is the source of the God - "Sagun Brahm"- The creater, then the same source also serve for the created as well".  Don't you think so? 
Then the mind is the creater and the created.  In my humble view the perceived duality can never be real but just a relative stand point. The issue is how the mind first of all come in to existence.  And Advaita says it is"inexplicable". In other words there is neither creation nor destruction and Atman alone exists "Non-dual".  However a person may perceive the world real so long he hasn't realized the true nature. Please correct me if I am wrong. In mean time  I will also get hold of  VP so that  I am clear with the message.  I will also ask  Swami  Tyaganandaji Maharaj of Boston Vedanta society to make sure that I understand it right.   

Hari Om Tat Sat,

Sincerely yours
Sivaramakrishnan

Cruelty to dumb animals is one of the distinguishing vices of low and base minds. Wherever it is found, it is a certain mark of ignorance and meanness; a mark which all the external advantages of wealth, splendour, and nobility, cannot obliterate. It is consistent neither with learning nor true civility. 
--William Jones (1726-1800)

This would mean there is no objective reality.  It is an illusion "all in 
your head."  However this is not the Advaitic understanding.

   But the explanation of

All objects and categories are created by Ishvara (God) at the time of 
creation and dissolved by Him at the pralaya.  This cycle continues 
indefinitely.

>From the point of view of the created, duality is "real"  It is from a 
higher perspective that we see that mind and its objects are transient and 
not real.  Even God who we assume to be a creator, maintainer, and 
destroyer is in fact none of those and it is ignorance which causes the 
false assumption.
