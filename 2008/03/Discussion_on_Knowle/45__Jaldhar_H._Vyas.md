This would mean there is no objective reality.  It is an illusion "all in 
your head."  However this is not the Advaitic understanding.

All objects and categories are created by Ishvara (God) at the time of 
creation and dissolved by Him at the pralaya.  This cycle continues 
indefinitely.

>From the point of view of the created, duality is "real"  It is from a 
higher perspective that we see that mind and its objects are transient and 
not real.  Even God who we assume to be a creator, maintainer, and 
destroyer is in fact none of those and it is ignorance which causes the 
false assumption.
