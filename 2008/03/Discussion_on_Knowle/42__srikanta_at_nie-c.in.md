This is with reference to the discussion on "Knowledge and the means of
Knowledge,with regards to Pratyaksha(perception) in the Vedanta Paribhasha
of Dharmaraja Advaredra.

In Advaita vedanta,perception occurs,as the mind flows out of the senses
and envelops the object,and takes the shape of the object, just as the
water flows and occupies the field and takes the shape of the field.It is
called the "vrtti".Then,recognition(smrti) comes a little later and
says,"yes,this is that object".The light(chaitanya) that shines for the
knowledge is "Atman".
It is just "Sakshi"or witness for the activities of the antahkarana.This
entity,"Atman"is changeless,since if it changes,then, there should not
have been recognition.This is "Kutastha nitya"(ever unchanging and fixed).
