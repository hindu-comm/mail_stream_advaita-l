What I had hoped to illustrate is the difference between illusion and 
delusion.  Illusion is imagining that which isn't there.   Delusion is 
failing to understand what is there.

If the mind is the creator than why are our creations so much alike?  One 
should see a blue sky, one should see a green sky, another should see no 
sky etc.

That our experience of pratyaksha is so similiar is proof that "reality" 
is not "in here" but "out there." The mind does not create but it observes 
(and distorts) reality.

Yes.

That's not the inexplicable part.  The mind is a result of ahamkara 
("ego") which is a misunderstanding brought about by maya.  Maya is 
inexplicable.

True.  What trips people up is that the "reality" of the Jnani is not the 
same thing as the "reality" of the ajnani.  Comparing apples and oranges 
is anirvachaniya ("inexplicable") just as how many gallons in a kilometer 
is logically inexplicable.
