praNams,

All very interesting; but there is a point about authority and antiquity (i believe both are related issues and they are also related to etymology because it goes to the roots): ISa is part of SYV saMhitA but probably bRhadaraNyaka is much older due to its language and style. Both BrU and ChU are said to be the oldest, the favorites of Sri Sankara and the back-bone of advaita.

Hari Om,

Mandukya Upanishad:

One Mahatma said that

"Before leaping forward, a frog draws itself backwards a little bit, then leaps forward.

Mandukya Upanishad is similar in nature, the Upanishad draws backward a little bit,  then jumps to the next topic."
