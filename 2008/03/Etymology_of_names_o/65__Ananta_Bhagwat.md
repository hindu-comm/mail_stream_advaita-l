praNam,

In regards kaushItaki Sri SankarAnanda explains the name thus: 
ku kutsitam nindyam heyamity arthaH, SItam SItalam saMsArikam sukham yasya sa kushItaH eva kushItakaH tasyApatyam kaushItakiH (II.i)
(This etymology is mention in Radhakrishnan's Principal Upanishads, page 751)

ananta

Subject: Re: [Advaita-l] Etymology of names of upanishad-s

The word is kaTha (mUrdhanya Th), not kathA (dantya th), so the meaning of story or parable does not follow from the name. The subject matter of the upanishat is of course presented through the story of naciketa and his father. 

> (3) kaushitaki: Is it related to some word kutsitaH (skeptic or sarcastic)?. I understans Shankarananda (c. 16th century) had explained its etymology in Sanskrit but was not clear to me because of my inadequate Sanskrit knowledge.

kaushItaki is also the name of a vedic SAkha. The word is derived from kushItaka, the name of a Rishi, and means son/descendant of kushItaka. In the bRhadAraNyakopanishat, kahola kaushItakeya is one of the people who questions yAjnavalkya.

If you can post the relevant excerpts from SankarAnanda's dIpikA on the kaushItaki upanishat, there are quite a few members on this list who will be able to help you with the meaning of the Sanskrit text.

Best regards,
Vidyasankar
