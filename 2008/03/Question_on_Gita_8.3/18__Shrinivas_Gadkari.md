Namaste,

Have a question on interpreting the following two verses from Gita based only 
on Sanskrit language rules:
Gita 13.13 (second line): anAdimatparam brahma na sat tat na asat ucyate
Gita 8.3 (line one) akSaram brahma paramam svabhAvo adhyAtama ucyate

Q1: In 13.13, is it obvious that param qualifies brahma.
Q2: In 8.3, what does paramam qualify akSara, or brahma. i.e. should we read 
"param akSara is brahma", or "akSara is param brahma" ?

Thanks, and regards,
Shrinivas
