As I understand, Krishna is giving definitions for different terms in this
chapter. 

Here He is defining Brahman - as aksharam and paramam - kshara means that which
disintegrates. He is askharam what which is eternal. 
Paramam means supreme - there is nothing beyond Brahman - the ultimate. 
Both are indicatory definitions since Brahman cannot be defined. 
Hari Om!
