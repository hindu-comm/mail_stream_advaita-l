While on the topic of the Ganapati Mantram, I have a question that I have wanted to ask for a long time:

The dhyana shloka says: Vishvotpati, vipatti, sanstiti... Why this odd sequence? Should it not be Vishvotpati, sanstiti, vipatti...?

Must be some interesting explanation.

Many thanks. Warm regards.




Sethuraman.

She got the Upadesha some years back from a pundit. When I got the Upadesh from my mother, I felt that some of the words/letters in the Anganyasa, Karanyas, and Dhayana Slokams are not properly spelt. May be she did not hear them properly when she took the Upadesham. I got the correct version of Bala Dhyana Sloka from this mail list only.  Now I need the correct Anganyasa, Karanyasa, and Dhayana slokams of Ganapati Mantra and Shakti Panchakshari Mantra. I am metioning few starting words and ending words of each slokam for your reference (as there may be many different dhayna slokas.) Any help from you would be highly appreciated.  Ganapati Dhyana Slokam ------------------------------------- Biijapura Gadekshu Karmuka Ruchacha....yasishta ujjwalati bushaya viswotpathi dwipathi samsthithi karah vignesha ishtardhadhara.  Shakti Panchakshari Mantra ----------------------------------------- Maahi Kalpa drumasya druta kalpa.....parashu mrigaabhiti hantyam vande balendu maulihi gajavadana guhasishta parsham mahesham.
