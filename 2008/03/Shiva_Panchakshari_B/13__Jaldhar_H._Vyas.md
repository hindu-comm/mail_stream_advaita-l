With Shivaratri approaching I thought this may be of interest.  It is a 
short (23 shlokas) commentary on the mahamantra of Shiva Bhagavan namaH 
shivAya said to be authored by Padmapadacharya, the seniormost disciple of 
Shankaracharya.  It contains 7 alternate meanings for the mantra.

I have placed a copy of the sanskrit text on our web site at:

I didn't have time to do a translation.  Maybe someone would like to 
volunteer to do it?
