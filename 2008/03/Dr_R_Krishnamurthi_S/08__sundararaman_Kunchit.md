                   Dr R Krishnamurthi Sastrigal



Mullaivasal Dr R Krishnamurthi Sastrigal needs no introduction

to students of Adv.vedanta.He studied under Sri Polagam Rama

Sastrigal and Sri SR Krishnamurthi Sastrigal the legendary stalwarts

in the staff of Madras Sanskrit College and rose from student to

Principal of the College when he retired.(see
http://www.advaita-vedanta.org/mullaivasal)



At the request of his Vedanta students Dr R Krishnamurthi Sastrigal  has
been taking classes on *Siddhantalesasangraha *the magnum opus of HH Appiah
Dikshitha (with commentary of Sri Krishnalankara and edited by Sri SR
Krishnamurthi Sastrigal(SRK);the indexing done by SRK itself is marvelous
piece of work-this edition has become out of print and the Samithi at
Hyderabad is being persuaded to bring out a new edition to

preserve the erudition of SRK)

to download them and hear at their convenience. .It is preferred that
