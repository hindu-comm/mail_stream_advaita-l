Prem - praNams 

Vedanta ParibhASha will address the errors in perception in the later sections and
when we come to that section we can resolve this issue. In the first post itself we
have clarified the pramaa, the valid knowledge is only related to vyAvahArika satyam
only since non-negatability criteria if you apply all the way to absolute level only
thing left non-negatable is  paramArthika which is in the absolute sense aprameyam.
This has been clarified in the post 1 in defining pramANa. 

Hari Om!
Sadananda
