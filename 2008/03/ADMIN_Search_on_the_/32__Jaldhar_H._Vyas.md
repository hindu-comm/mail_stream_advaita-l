This is a question which might be of interest to the general readership. I 
hope you don't mind if I reply in public.

The lack of a good search engine is an long-standing annoyance which I mean 
to fix one of these days when I find the time.

Until then one option is to use google search.  For example searching on

sadananda site:lists.advaita-vedanta.org

or

"jnana yoga" site:lists.advaita-vedanta.org

Should do what you want.  This is a general text search, you cannot search by 
author or subject as far as I know.  Another problem is there is no 
standardized English transliteration for Sanskrit.  So a word like jnana 
could also be GYAna (ITRANS notation favored by many posters) gyan (Hindi 
pronounciation) gnan, or any number of permutations.

There is also a mirror of the list on gmane at

http://news.gmane.org/gmane.culture.religion.advaita

It has a search engine which lets you search by author or subject as well as 
words.

hmm maybe I should just find a way to embed that?
