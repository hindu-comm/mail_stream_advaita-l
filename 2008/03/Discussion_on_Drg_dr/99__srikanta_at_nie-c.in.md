This is with reference to SriVidyasankara Sundreshan
It is not possible after so many years to look for manuscript
evidence.Infact,many manuscripts have been lost/or and statements by
eminent persons are couched in other manuscripts.What I see is that the
verse "asti bhati priyam...." is so fundamental in the nature of adwaita
vedanta and Sankara could have made or by his predecessors like Govinda
Bhagawatpada or Gaudapada.ANy way,this verse is so fundamental and Bharati
Tirtha could not have made it without the support of Sankara.
Regards,                                              N.Srikanta.
