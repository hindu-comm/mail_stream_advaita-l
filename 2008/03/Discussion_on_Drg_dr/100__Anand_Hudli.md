The "asti bhAti priyaM.." verse also occurs in the sarasvatI rahasya upaniShad of the Krishna Yajur veda. Please see, for example an English version: http://www.kalki.ru/108-upanishads-sarasvati-rahasya-upanishad/ verse 58. The sarasvatI rahasya upaniShad has a commentary by upaniShad brahma yogin. It is possible that the dR^ig dR^ishya viveka refers to this verse from the upaniShad.

Anand
