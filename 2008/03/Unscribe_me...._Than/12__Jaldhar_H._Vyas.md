I would like to remind readers that requests for unsubscription, address 
change etc. should be sent to listmaster at advaita-vedanta.org NOT to the 
list itself.  Or you can do it yourself, the links are at the bottom of 
every message.

Also conversation not related to list topics should be sent privately.
