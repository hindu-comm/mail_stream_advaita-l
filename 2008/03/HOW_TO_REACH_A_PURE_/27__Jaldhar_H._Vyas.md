By systematically removing false knowledge (avidya) ranging from mundane 
errors upto the delusion that there is an 'I' seperate from Brahman.

Swami Madhavananda of the Ramakrishna Mission translated it in 1954. 
There have been many editions since then  and it should be available at 
any local branch of the mission or from any online bookseller.

There is also a (better IMO) translation by S.S. Suryanarayana Shastri 
which was published by the Adyar Library in 1971.  Unfortunately it is out 
of print.
