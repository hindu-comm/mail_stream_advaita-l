With reference to the above question by SriK.R.Narayan in his posting on
March 24,2008,the Vedas contain mostly the rituals to attain the other
worlds like heaven,and refer to the Hiranyagarbha Brahma.But,the
word"Brahman"occur in samhitas.For ex.in "Isavasyopanishath"the Upanishath
is found right in the middle of the Samhita,belonging to Sukla Yajurveda.

                                                        N.Srikanta.
