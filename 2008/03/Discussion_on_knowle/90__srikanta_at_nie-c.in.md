This is with reference to Sri Vidyasankar Sundareshan's Email regarding
the verse"Asti bhati priyam...."occurring in the book "Drg drsya
viveka"which has another name "Vakya-sudha", by Bharati tirtha,Guru of
vidyaranya.

However,in the book Drg drsya viveka by Swami Nikhilananda published by
SriRamakrishna Ashrama,Mysore-2,Swami Nikhilananda in his introduction to
the book writes"The other name by which this treatise is known is
Vakya-sudha" which is also the commentary on it.....
Brahmananda Bharati probably wrote,as some authorities hold,a commentary
called "Vakya -sudha".However,in the book"Vedanta Paribhasha"by Dharmaraja
Adhvarindra,traslated and annotated by Swami Madhavananda(published by
Adwaita Ashrama)in the foot note of the page 157 this verse is quoted as
from Shankaracharya's Vakya-Sudha-20.Hence the book Vakya-sudha is a
commentary on Drg drsya viveka.
