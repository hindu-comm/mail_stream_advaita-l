Dear Sirs
I am very much greatful for reading the topic on "Perception"of the VP by
Sri.Kuntimaddi Sadananda.I enjoyed the excellent exposition in very lucid
style of the topic,especially how the subject can be considered as the
object.Now,I would like to ask the venerable Sir,whether the
statements,"Observer is the Observed","Thinker is Thought"expressed by
the Philosopher J.Krishnamurti falls in the same category?

Thanking You,                                        Yours sincerely,
                                                      N.Srikanta.
