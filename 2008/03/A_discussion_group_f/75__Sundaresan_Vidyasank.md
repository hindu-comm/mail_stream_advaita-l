>In his discussion on the above topic sri.Sadanandaji had written that
the following verse:
>"Asti bhati priyam rupam ...
> ...
> is by Vidyaranya in "Drgdrsyaviveka".But,actually is from
Vakya-Sudha-20 of Sri.Shankaracharya. 

Dear Sri Srikanta,

vAkyasudhA and dRgdRSyaviveka are two names for the same text. They are
not two different works. Also, this text is wrongly attributed to SrI
SankarAcArya. It is definitely a composition of bhAratItiRtha and/or
vidyAraNya. There is some question as to whether the author is
bhAratItIrtha alone or vidyAraNya alone, but it is well-known that they
wrote many works under joint authorship.

Regards,
Vidyasankar
