In his discussion on the above topic sri.Sadanandaji had written that the
following verse:

"Asti bhati priyam rupam nama cetryashpanchakam!
adyam trayam brahmarupam jagadrupam tato dvayam"
"Existence,manifestation,agrreableness,form and name --these are the five
aspects of (phenomena).The first three are characteristics of Brahman and
the next two of the Universe".

The relation to Brahman to name and form and that of the Universe to
existence etc.are but cases of tranference of attribute .

is by Vidyaranya in "Drgdrsyaviveka".But,actually is from Vakya-Sudha-20
of Sri.Shankaracharya.
