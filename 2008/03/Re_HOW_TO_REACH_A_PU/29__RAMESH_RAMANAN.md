Shree Jaldhar H. Vyas has addressed about the availability of the book with English
Traslation. I must say however that it is very difficult to understand both the
original as well as the English translation.

About purification of the mind - The most efficient way of purifying the mind is by
Karma yoga - that is the yoga of action - The 3rd Ch. of Gita talks about it. I
wrote about 6 posts as series last year on Karma yoga. You may be able to down load
from archieves of advatiaL. If you cannot let me know by private mail, I should be
able to send it you. 

Hari Om!
