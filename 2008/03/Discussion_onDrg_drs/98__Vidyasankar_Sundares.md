Dear Sri Srikanta,

Indeed, I do not doubt that at all, and this idea might well explain why two
names have been given for one text.

However, it does not follow from this that Sankara bhagavatpAda wrote a text
called vAkyasudhA. It also does not make it probable that the verse "asti
bhAti priyaM ..." was originally written by Sankara bhagavatpAda. One needs
independent manuscript evidence to say that. That is the point I was making.

The reason I emphasize this apparently minor point is that we need to weight
textual evidence very carefully. Somehow, as a culture, we seem to have lost
this ability. If we go back to Sankara bhagavatpAda's own works, it is very
clear how much of careful attention he pays to almost every word in the source
texts that he cites.

Best regards,
Vidyasankar
