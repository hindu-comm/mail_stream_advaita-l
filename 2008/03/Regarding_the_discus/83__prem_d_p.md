namaste...

  dear sri bhagawat,

  trying to read into vedas 'tendencies' and 'evolution of ideas' is the hallmark
  of a 'researcher' with a pet point to prove...or to put it more simply how to
  start on the wrong foot!

  if one cannot see or even have faith in the wholeness and oneness of vedas, 
what hope is there for us to see the advaitic truth and harmony in this world of apparent duality, conflicts, and dis-harmony.

  pranam.

  ...prem
