namaste...

  dear sri vidyasankar-ji,

  thank you for such a lucid and unequivocal clarification.

  that karmakanda was comprehended as though opposed to or unconnected 
  to jnanakanda is precisely the reason why vedanta has to start by clearing 
  the mist and misconceptions.

  even the bhagavad gita cannot be understood without the integral view
  that the vedas as a whole presents.

  pranam.

  ...prem
