Namaste,

Well said! But i was making another point, the idea of Brahman  as all pervading unity is discernible not only in Upanishads but also in other parts of Vedas, albeit phrased differently and sparingly. 

You need not be sorry at all, you never sounded harsh but somewhat dogmatic (a word alien to Vedas) in your earlier mail. Faith without reason is sure recipe for disaster and conflict, and not curiosity and research. Here we can agree (to disagree).

  dear sri ananta,

  i am really sorry if i sounded harsh, but that was not my intention, 
  nor was it an emotional response to your post.

  i was not trying to credit you or discredit you with having a theory
  to promote but to merely caution you against such influences,
  because i believe, for you and me vedas is not an object of
  curiosity but our way of living which is our sadhana too.

  certainly i cannot empathize with the ideas expressed in your post.

  see the bhagavad gita's elaboration of yajna, Lord Krishna is not
  trying to twist yajna to suit his purpose but clarifying the depth
  and scope of yajna in all life. karmakanda is about life and the worlds, jnankanda does not undermine the karmakanda but tells you what 
  underlies it and what transcends it. vedas in is totality is about being, 
  and non-being and what lies beyond both.

  pranam.

  Dear Sri prem
PraNama

Your point is noted. I am not in a position to see unified view of all veda-s as yet; that stage must be coming much latter and may not come in my life time like many others. 

Still I am trying to figure out what could be the pet point I would like to prove other than my desire to see the vision of one in the earliest civilization at the time of Rk saMhitA.

As I said 'am open to corrections so that I do not proceed on wrong foot. Meanwhile I expect prem (empathy) from you rather than admonition :) 

Regards
ananta

dear sri bhagawat,

trying to read into vedas 'tendencies' and 'evolution of ideas' is the hallmark
of a 'researcher' with a pet point to prove...or to put it more simply how to
start on the wrong foot!

if one cannot see or even have faith in the wholeness and oneness of vedas, 
what hope is there for us to see the advaitic truth and harmony in this world of apparent duality, conflicts, and dis-harmony.

pranam.

....prem
