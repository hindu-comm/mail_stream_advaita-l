Dear Sri prem
PraNama

Your point is noted. I am not in a position to see unified view of all veda-s as yet; that stage must be coming much latter and may not come in my life time like many others. 

Still I am trying to figure out what could be the pet point I would like to prove other than my desire to see the vision of one in the earliest civilization  at the time of Rk saMhitA.

As I said 'am open to corrections so that I do not proceed on wrong foot. Meanwhile I expect prem (empathy) from you rather than admonition :) 

Regards
ananta

 namaste...

  dear sri bhagawat,

  trying to read into vedas 'tendencies' and 'evolution of ideas' is the hallmark
  of a 'researcher' with a pet point to prove...or to put it more simply how to
  start on the wrong foot!

  if one cannot see or even have faith in the wholeness and oneness of vedas, 
what hope is there for us to see the advaitic truth and harmony in this world of apparent duality, conflicts, and dis-harmony.

  pranam.

  ...prem
