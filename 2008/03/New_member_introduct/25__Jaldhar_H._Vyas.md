Hi,

I am Subra (short for Subrahmanyam). I am 35, currently in the US. I am
interested in Advaita as a philosophical system as well as from a personal
spiritual development perspective. I especially enjoy learning about/from
Shankara and his works. It is very remarkable and pure genius the way he has
combined multiple disciplines such as advaita, yoga, tantra, as well as
shastras & arts such as poetry, language.

Hope this provides you enough of a background on me and my intention for
joing this list.

Thank you,

Subra
