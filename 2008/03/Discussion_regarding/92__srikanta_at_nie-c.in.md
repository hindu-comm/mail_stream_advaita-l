With reference to the Email of Sri.Vidyasankar Sundareshan,I am not
talking about the size of the Karmakanda and jnanakanda.To come to the
jnanakanda one must have the basic requisites and must realise that he is
in ajnana.There is "adhikari bhedha".Both the karmakanda and the
jnanakanda have their adhikaris in mind.In the karmakanda there is no way
that the person can know about "Brahman",as he is immersed in karmas.It is
not merely a verbal statement that Brahman is the ultimate reality of the
world(Iam seeing the contradiction here)but one must realise it.The
karmakanda which says that Brahman is the source,sustenance and end of all
creations,it is referring not in an absolute sense,but the Hiranyagarbha
Brahma,which the karmakanda has in view.Vedanta is the culmination or thr
pinnacle of all vedas,all that is to be known.
