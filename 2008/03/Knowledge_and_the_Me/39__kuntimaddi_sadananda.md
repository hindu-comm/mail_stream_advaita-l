Prem - PraNAms 

Thanks for you kind comments. I added section on Self-realization and mind as a
subject, although those are not directly discussed in VP.

About the mind and realization of oneness in spite of duality is the key that
VP underlines in terms of oneness of seer and the seen as they are
substantially one and that oneness forms a basis for direct and immediate
perception too. But recognition of oneness in the seer and the seen requires a
sensitive mind that can see the unity than diversity. 

You have provided very interesting comments to ponder. Thanks.


Hari Om!
