Dear Sri Narayana Iyer
A general reading of the Sukthas you had mentioned will clear your doubts 
about the vinamrata aspect contained in them.Sri Suktham says saranam aham 
prapadye and goes on to describe the golden brilliance of Lakshmi and the 
prayer addressed to Her.Durga suktham  contains sutharasi tharase nama:It is 
more or less addressed to Durga in the form of Agni.it is also prayer to 
remove all obstacles and bless the progeny with prosperity.Sandhya mantras 
are full of vinamrata aspect only.The mantras say that all my sins-these are 
also listed -sarvam punanthu mam -papebyoh rakshantaham-.The two sins -manyu 
kruthebyah and kamo kruthebyah are again and again listed and prayed to the 
Devathas to protect one from these two very difficult sins.Whether one has 
actually committed  these sins are not still these are said to emphasise 
that these two are very difficult to overcome.Manyu is anger and Kama is 
desire.Also it is prayed that  one may be absolved of sins committed by 
manas,vak and and karmendriyas -like hands,feet,stomach and genital 
organs.All indicate vinamratha only.That is we as humans are very prone to 
commit sins at a drop of a hat as it were and we plead that we may be 
saved.It also indicates that it is very very difficult to conquer anger and 
passion.The mantra says only desire and anger have done the sins!Meaning 
human being have no control over these two emotions.How 
true!.Krishnamoorthy.

Subject: [Advaita-l] vedic mantras in nitya karmas
