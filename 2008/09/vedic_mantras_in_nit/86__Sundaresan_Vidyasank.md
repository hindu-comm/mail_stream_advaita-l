The namaka praSna has a special place in the yajurveda saMhita portion.
It is perhaps the only example one can give from Sruti, for a list of
names. All other lists of 108 or 1008 names used for pUjAs are from
various smRti texts.

There are other veda mantra-s in which the namaH word is repeated. E.g. 

namo vAce yA coditA yA cAnuditA tasyai vAce namo namo ... - one of the
SAnti mantra-s,

namo brahmaNe namo astv agnaye namaH pRthivyai ... ... namo vishNave
bRhate karomi

namo rudrAya vishNave mRtyur me pAhi - taittirIya AraNyaka

namo (a)gnaye (a)psumate nama indrAya namo varuNAya namo vAruNyai namo
(a)dbhyaH - aghamarshaNa sUkta from taittirIya braHmaNa

yakshvAmahe saumanasAya rudram namobhir devam asuraM duvasya - Rg veda
(usually recited after yajurveda namaka during pUjA).

Regards,
Vidyasankar
