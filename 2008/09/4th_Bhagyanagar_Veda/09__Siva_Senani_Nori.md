The 4th Bhagyanagar Veda Sabha is being held at Shankar Mutt, Nallakunta, Hyderabad on the 7th of September 2008, Sunday. The Sabha starts at 8:00 am and ends at about 6:30 pm, with at least 40 vedic scholars expected to participate.

The format is the pariksha paddhati, wherein the participating scholars are expected to recite a randomly chosen 'panasa' (about 50 characters long) over seven rounds. Each round is started by the President (Brahma Sri Dendukuri Anjaneya Ghanapathi) and Vice-President (Brahma Sri Gundlapalli Visvanatha Ghanapathi)at a random panasa. The two scholars seated next to them are expected to continue from where they left and so on till everybody getsa chance.

Usually the first three rounds are from thesamhita part of the Krishna Yajurveda followed by the last ashTaka (Upanishads are not recited after lunch). Post lunch the remaining three ashTakas are recited. In the previous three sabhas, scholars who have learnt the Rig Veda, Sama Veda and Atharvana Veda also participated, but the bulk of participation was from the Krishna Yajurveda school. Thereafter around 6:00 pm, the aaSeervachanam and sambhaavana start.

All vedic scholars of the twin cities are welcome to participate, as are bhaktas who want to listen to the sacred chanting.Many prefer to be present during the aaSeervachana part as they get to receive the blessings of vedic pandits.

All are welcome. Lunch would be served around 2:00 pm.

Best regards
N. Siva Senani
