Dear Sri Krishna,

Thanks for your email to this list.  I know the discussions are going
out side the scope of this list.  But, one thing I can say here is
that, you may read the pages of history more properly before you make
any post here like this.  I completely agree with what Sri
Vidyashankar says.

Dear Sri Krishna, please dont think that there is any dearth of
Sanskrit speaking people in this world.  Only frogs in the well do not
know the value of the lotus.  Bees know them and come from a long
distance.  Many many of my friends are sanskirt scholars and to your
surprise, some of my european and american friends are also scholars
in Sanskrit.   Have you ever read any book that has been written in
some language and translated into any other language?  Can any
language deliver the same charm of any theme when translated from
another language?  You are talking about languages.  The language of
Sanskrit is THE systematic language.  None of your languages are so
systematic as that of Sanskirt, which is the mother of all your modern
languages.

Also, a true scholar of any language will not criticise the other one,
unless one is a pervert.  One sees bad things outside, because those
very bad things are in him.

Contemplate a while to understand.

With best wishes,
Anupam.

They have not come together on one purpose of agreement to respect each other's opinion and make a common effort to propagate Sankara Vedanta. Yes, they do propagate within their own whimsical ideology and circles. They keep giving general lectures on puja worship which are later day inventions of Vedic period.

No Math is able to make the followers of those Math to stick to their Brahmana dharma. Most people go for money earning jobs in society, and do not even perform their Brahmana dharma even as an additional chore. There is a huge disagreement on the definition of Brahmana itself. Some say things have changed in the medival times. I am not an expert in this area.

Just becasue there are not many people interested in reading this kind of books, translators are not coming forward. I am confident, there are many greedy Brahmanas and Sanskrit scholars who will translate, if there is money and recognition. But, where are the real practitioners, compasionate people,  who can write with their own experience?
