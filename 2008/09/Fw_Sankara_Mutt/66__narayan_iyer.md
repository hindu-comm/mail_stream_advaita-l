Respected Sri Vidyasankarji,

I am a great admirer of your write-ups.  On seeing your reply, I also reflected on the matter for a whole day.  Initially, I thought of dropping the subject altogether.  But on better judgement I decided that I should respond, since the subject was initiated by me.  So here goes my reply:

The first query of my post was "Is there a charter of functions of Sankara Mutts?" This was inexplicably not touched by any of the respondents.  Not even an i dont know; i dont care; you are not entitled to know response.

Second, why I presumed that may be Sankara maTha can help me with a translation was because a book entitled "YaajuSha suurya namaskaara kalpaH" was compiled by Sri Sundararama Diskhitar with an English translation by N. S. Anatakrishna Sastri,Astanavidwan (at that time) of Sringeri Mutt, and published by Sri Sringeri Jagadguru Sanatana Dharma Vidya Samiti, 1967.  This book has Srimukham of Sri Mahasannidhanam, the previous Sankaracharya of Sringeri.  (This message is in our archives of June 05 - courtesy Sri Ramakrishnan Balasubramnian).  This book contains the entire Aruna prasna of TA. 

Now response to other points,

My query simply wondered whether Sankara maThas can do something to alleviate the non-availability of translation of vedas for persons so placed as I am.

Please note that "online versions", "job of Sankara maThas etc." are neither stated nor implied in my letter and you have unreasonably inferred something which is not there.  However, as you have elsewhere stated/concurred that Sankara maThas do not approve of translation of vedas:

Please clarify whether it is a stated policy of the Matha, a fact which is not in public domain (but a fact none-the-less)or knowledge arising out of certain matters or inference.

> Nor is it the job of other old traditional institutions belonging to other vedAnta traditions. It is also not the job of newer and perhaps richer institutions like Maharishi TM and Sai Baba to do so.

That makes me wonder as to the purpose of providing links of somether's translation on their websites.

That is the reason of quest for better translations, if possible

That is what I am doing presently and that is why I was searching.

Here there is exaggeration  or presumption of one's own experience takes over.  I am staying in Surat, Gujarat, India.  I belong to taittiriya shaka of KYV and I couldnt locate a traditional teacher possessing knowlege of sanskrit and TS of KYV.  I was not alone in search and there were others in search as well.  I am not a net-geek seeking internet access to everything.  I would love to learn in the personal company of my guru.  Absence of that company is what making me to turn to other resources.

That they have been doing (your goodselves included) is definitely appreciated and thats what makes subscribers stick to advaita-L.

I live in Surat,Gujarat, India.  I didnt come across any news regarding Dwarka maTha in local media in the last one year and I dont think I was careless to miss one.  If I had missed any and you had captured the event, please correct me.

 I am not considering the two instances when Acharya's name cropped up.  I have seen your compilations on Sankaracharyas and presume that you know the two instances.  These two occasions had nothing to do with activity of the maTha.

>Throughout the year, there is a wide variety of scholarly and religious activity that goes on.

> For most of the well-known maTha-s, their followers and well-wishers come from all castes and communities.

Where did someone infer otherwise?

It is sillier to presume that brAhmaNa-s think like that.

Even during the historic meeting of the four Sankaracharyas, Sanskrit was not reported to be the medium of conversation amongst the acharyas, so why grapple with admin. staff, kitchen staff, room manager etc.

This precisely takes us back to my unanswered question. Sankara Mutt is a institution. What is the charter of functions of this esteemed institution.  The above points do not clarify that.

Pl. permit me to take on the following issues as they pertain to me as well:

Once again I beseech you to read the passage without word "online" because it is maya and it isnt there in the original.

I have to rebutt here that Sri Senan's post wasnt such a bland simple explanation as you put here in your message.  Such a tone of language in a letter is sure to bring in responses.

The point is well taken.
