Dear Sri Krishna,

Thanks for your email to this list.  
-----
Begin-SK

End-SK

I know the discussions are going
out side the scope of this list.  
----
Begin-SK

How do you know? Are you the moderator? or are you the final 
'all-knowing'?

BTW, is discussion on ways and means of dissemination Vedic 
knowledge out side the scope of this list?

In any case my post is in reply to two other previous posts. 
You need to tell them that their posts were out side the scope!

End-SK
----

But, one thing I can say here is
that, you may read the pages of history more properly before you make
any post here like this.  

----
Begin-SK

Are you asking me to read Indian history or world history, or 
advaita-l pages?

Is my ignorance so palpable in my post?

End-SK
--------

I completely agree with what Sri
Vidyashankar says.

-----
Begin-SK

How does it matter to me? or what does it add to the discussion 
here. Vidyashankar expressed many views on important topics
of common interest. But, how does it make what I have to say
irrelevant?

End-SK
------

Dear Sri Krishna, please dont think that there is any dearth of
Sanskrit speaking people in this world.  

-----
Begin-SK

How do you know I think some way? BTW, is it overflowing 
with Sanskrit SPEAKING people?


End-SK

----

Only frogs in the well do not
know the value of the lotus.  Bees know them and come from a long
distance.

Begin-SK

Who are the frogs here?

End-SK

Many many of my friends are sanskirt scholars and to your
surprise, some of my european and american friends are also scholars
in Sanskrit.   
----

Begin-SK

How many many of your friends are we talking about 5 .. 10 .. 20 .. 100 ? 
Well, my being surprised can't make the world wonder.

Are we talking about Sanskrit scholarship or 
Vedic scholarship or both or more? 

End-SK
---------

Have you ever read any book that has been written in
some language and translated into any other language?  Can any
language deliver the same charm of any theme when translated from
another language?  You are talking about languages.  The language of
Sanskrit is THE systematic language.  None of your languages are so
systematic as that of Sanskirt, which is the mother of all your modern
languages.
-----

Begin-SK

You are talking as if you are the GURU of all languages. In how many languages 
are you proficient and scholar? 

I agree every language has its own beauty. I am neither a philologist 
nor a linguist.

How is all this related to Sankara Mutt or learning meaning of 
Vedas ?

End-SK
--------
Also, a true scholar of any language will not criticise the other one,
unless one is a pervert.  

-----
Begin-SK

Which rule of Newton is this?

I am not a scholar of any language. 
Neither is this a thread on languages.
Do you want to still classify me as a pervert. That is fine.
Solve the problems of the world, that is all I want.

End-SK
-----

One sees bad things outside, because those
very bad things are in him.

-------
Begin-SK

First stop being a preacher, and become a list member. Let me
decide if I should look upon you as a teacher, based on your
wisdom, not based on your self-professed high standards 
of knowledge and contemplation.

End-SK
---------

Contemplate a while to understand.

----
Begin-SK
A list is to share ideas, Knowledge and wisdom. Not take sides
and advice a 'Ney' sayer to 'contemplate'.

If we can be focused on knowledge, then a lot of good will 
be done to the world. Then only I can be educated.

End-SK
---------

With best wishes,
Anupam.

Most people go for money earning jobs in society, and do not even perform their
Brahmana dharma even as an additional chore. There is a huge disagreement on the
definition of Brahmana itself. Some say things have changed in the medival
times. I am not an expert in this area.

there are many greedy Brahmanas and Sanskrit scholars who will translate, if
there is money and recognition. But, where are the real practitioners,
compasionate people,  who can write with their own experience?
