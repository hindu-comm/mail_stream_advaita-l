Dear Sri Krishnamurthy

Your interpretation of the matter at hand is self-contradictory.

We all know that Veda mantras are in (some) Sanskrit. It is not the same Sanskrit in which Raghu vamsha or Mrichhakatikam is composed, not even the Sanskrit in which Bhagavad Gita is composed.

The knowledge to interpret the Veda Mantras is rooted in Vedic Sanskrit of a different age, and a lot more depends on the intent of the prayoga which one probably learns from tradition. Beyond that there will be the intuitive knowledge of a 'real' Brahmana who has been devoted to the Veda Dharma. So, I would not agree to the idea that knowing Sanskrit sounds (in any script) and having a dictionary will serve the 100% purpose.

We are not asking that the mantras be 'composed' in Arabic or English or some other Indian vernacular!

What we are asking is just what you have done, here in this mail! 

You quoted a Gita verse and gave your commentary. Why did you not leave without it? Because you want me to understand what you are saying. 

Probably, in your view 'Sanskrit learning austerity' is not required for Gita and is mandatory for Veda. In which book of Manu has this been codified? I am aware that each ritual in the Veda prescribes its own eligibility such as 'krishna keshah' etc. Do you think people will paint their hair black just to perform the ritual? If so, that is the interpretation of English translation, not becasue of English translation itself.

For centuries people have been keeping this simple 'way of life' and 'philosophy' a secret under the secrecy of language, using this as an intimidating tactic to cover up their right to exclusivity or eliteness. Even if one were to differ from my criticism, it is enough to understand that Veda need not be kept secret, no one can do harm by knowing what it is. Most of what the Veda talks about is a 'way of life' here and a 'way out of life here'. The more people understand in any vernacular, it can encourage people to be open minded. After all Veda wanted itself to be 'understood and followed' by people. 

Unfortunately, because this is not understood clearly as a 'way of life alone', and people could look for other vocations as well, if the need forces and time permits, people chose 'Secular Macauley Education' in place of Vedic Education, instead of 'Secular Macauley Education' along with Vedic Education. If only we were clear about the place of Veda in overall scheme of 'life', we won't be stuck here discussing why 'English translations'.

We are not asking mantras to be 'composed' in English.

Regards

Srikrishna

Sri shiva Senani,
VERY WELL SAID!!! Cannot disagree with you a bit!
There is a qualification (pre-requisite) that is needed for learning
Any discipline - science, art or religion. Learning Sanskrit is the
pre-requisite for learning our Veda (unfortunately I am not versed in
Sanskrit either). As you rightly pointed out, until we do that, we have the
word of our elders. After all, this can't be any worse than the improperly
translated public domain information. This is the reason why Krishna ordered
-
"idam te nAtapaskAya nAbhaktAya kadAchana
na chAshushruShave vAchyam na cha mAm yO abhyasUyati" - (18-67).

The four qualifications Krishna is prescribing for learning the science of
Liberation(which applies for learning any discipline for that matter) are

1) austerity -preparing the mind for the receipt of the knowledge
2) Devotion - This also translates to shradDha; without faith, there is
scope for misuse of the knowledge.
3) Service to elders and teacher
4) Regard for the Lord.

Needless to say learning Sanskrit is the austerity required for studying
Veda.

Regards,
Ramakrishna.
