Namaskar,

In my family tradition while doing doing panca-deepa aarti, we use the mantras "sapratha sabham me gopaya, ye cha sabhayam.........Aher budhniyam mantram gopaya......amrutaam sathaam..."  - taittiriya brahmanam 1.2.1.26.

Can some member please give the meaning of the aforesaid mantras? Also, whether the mantra is appropriate for panca-deepa aarti, as the puja vidhanam book I have (published by RK mutt) gives another set of mantras.

thanking you in advance
