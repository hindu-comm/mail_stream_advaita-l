I have done this for over a dozen books so far (including the vaidyanaatha
diixitiiyam at vaidyanatha.ambaa.org and some pdf files in ambaa.org/pdf/). 
Even though I prefer regular printed and bound books, there are some advantages
in having these PDF files. a) You get access to out of print books and 
b) You can print them on acid free high quality paper if you want preserve 
them for long time.

This is what I do:

1. From FireFox using alternatiff, I figure out the location.

2. Use wget and download all the pages

3. Use the tool "tumble" on linux to put them together as a single PDF file.

There are PC (win32) based tools like tumble, but you have to buy them. But I
never researched this topic in depth - I continue to use the technology that
works for me. Some of my friends prefer that I load the file in DJVU format -
but I have not tried that yet. 

Hope this helps.

Ravi
