namaste,

> MOST PERSONS ON THIS LIST CAN AFFORD TO BUY THESE BOOKS;

I agree with the thought, especially when it comes to books in
English, or those that are easily available, such as the
sankara-granthavali republished by Samata books. However, when it
comes to the "sanskrity editions" (sanskrit texts and
[sub-]commentaries, with little or no translation), I have a really
hard time locating them for purchase. The DLI and university libraries
are a treasure trove for these texts.

Perhaps some of you would be kind enough to share the names / contact
information for booksellers that carry these kinds of titles. During
my next trip to India, I'm willing to make a special side-trip just
for this.

Examples of such books are "upanishad-bhashyam" published by Mahesh
Research Institute, and pretty much anything advaita previously
published by Nirnaya Sagar Press.

bhavadIyaH,

        ajit

> The above procedure is cumbersome if one wants an entire book. In fact, it is designed to be so. The idea is not to make books available to be downloaded freely; it is only to make books readable online. This is not due to some painful bureaucrat dreaming up imaginative restrictions: it is to respect copyright laws. The author (except if the project is funded by a public institution) and his estate retains the copyright till 60 years after the death of the author in India. Considering that most books were published only in the twentieth century, and that most authors actually passed away in the latter part of the century, most books have this restriction. There are alternate sites (www.archive.org and www.ulib.org) where books outside the copyright restriction are available as a PDF or a DJVU, but the collection is very limited.

Some might want to use a PDF writer (Adobe Acrobat Writer or Professional or some such version) and bind all these images into a PDF. The resultant PDF is bulky enough to discourage indiscriminate sharing but with file sharing services, nothing remains difficult. Therefore, please note:
