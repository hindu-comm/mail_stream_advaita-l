No, this only proves that shrIdharAcharya is trying to make a point (or sell
his ideas) by using shaMkarAchAryA's quotes because the later is respected
and well known.

It is like this, If I quote Gandhi, that does not mean I am automatically a
practitioner of "Non-violence".

I only disagree on this style of argument and I have no opinion on if
shrIdharAcharya was advaitin or not :-)
