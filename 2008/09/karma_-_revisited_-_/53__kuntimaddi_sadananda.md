Shree Narayan Iyer

Here is my understanding.

For thoes who have WILL to do 

Prarabda is what we have and what we do with what we have is purushaartha. What we have is the result of the previous action(s). What we do now with what we have will determine the aggami karma of the individual. 

In the example X refrained from bad action using his better sense, then he is essentially redirecting his karma to better direction.  

He does action not to Y,z etc but action is part of purturbation to the total system. The total system responds, in response to the purturbation. That is what Iswara means in terms of karma phala daata.  If Y, Z are part of the total system, they become beneficiaries (of good or bad in relation to some norm) of the total perturbation.  What they have as a result of the actions again is part of the prarabda for them only- whether it is good or bad.  Hence purushaartha of X and the results of that becomes, say part of god's grace - a benefit due to Y and Z's past good actions. 

Ultimately what one has to recoginize is to do what simple prayer of Serenity says 

Oh! Lord give me the strength to change things for the better of those that I can change
Give me the strength to accept things that I cannot
and give me the wisdom to know the difference. 

Hari Om!
Sadananda
