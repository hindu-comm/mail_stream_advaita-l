sri sadananda,

the two levels of nescience - one at the subject level and one at the object level sound very much like the two dimensions of the maaya - the aavarana shakthi that covers up the truth and the vikshepa shakthi that projects the untruth. is that correct?

sorry, i have entered this series at this point and i may be disturbing. you may have alreadyexplained this earlier. i congratulate your patient rendering, trying to get down to the level of a beginner and explaining all the concepts in such detail.

since each of your post is so very lengthy, i would appreciate if the important words are highlighted in bold so that they catchand holdreader's attention better.
