Namaste,

We know of three guNa-s sattva, raja, tama.
We also know of three doSa - vAta, pitta, and
shleSma (kapha).
[Is kapha a correct sanskRta term ? or is shleSma
the correct term?]

The words "guNa" and "doSa" are opposites in their 
literal meaning. Hence it is natural to ask if the 
tri-guNa and tri-doSa can be directly related.

1. pitta - raja pair is easy to guess.
2. shleSma/ kapha - tama seems reasonable,
3. vAta - sattva remain, so let us pair them.

Have any list members come across texts that address
this issue?

Regards,
Shrinivas
