Namaste to all of you !


My name is Mahan Pal Choudhury, age 29, hailing from Assam. I was born in 
Guwahati and had my schooling and higher education (B.E-Electrical) from 
there. I am presently staying in New Delhi and working as an Electrical 
Engineer in an engineering consultancy firm. My job is pure science and 
engineering but from a very early age I have been interested in India's 
past history, including its spiritual, socio-cultural, political and 
intellectual heritage and have tried to study and understand deeply about 
it. Because I believe that India's traditional knowledge is of as much 
relevance today as it was thousands of years ago, and the present 
situation in which India is in is in great measure because of its 
intelligentsia neglecting and disregarding its own past heritage. And to 
this great heritage Vedanta is central, so anyone trying to know deeply 
about India has to come to grips with it.


Best Regards,
Mahan
