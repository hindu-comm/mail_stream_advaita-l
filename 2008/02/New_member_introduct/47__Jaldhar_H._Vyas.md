Dear Sirs,

   I wish to be a member of the advaita-L group.

   My name is Meera, I live in Singapore, I am 50 years old, I am a stuent 
of Vedanta at the Chinmaya Mission and I would like to read the 
discussions among your members which are quite sharp and high on clarity. 
I do think some of the discussions here will help me understand the finer 
nuances of vedanta more deeply.

   If you find my profile good, kindly allow me to be a member.

   Warm regards,
   Meera
