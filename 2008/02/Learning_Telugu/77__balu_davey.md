Resected Sri.Siva Senani Nori,
    Pranams. At the very outset I thank you for the response. I can converse
freely in Telugu.
I attend Spiritual discourses in Telugu either in person or through T.V
(like Gemini,Theja
channels). I have heard/read translated works of Vemanna and others. Somehow
I have developed desire to learn Telugu Scriptwise. It is only from the
spiritual angle that I wish to learn. We are all Gujaratis domiciled in
south. Some of us Studied Tamil and the rest Telugu as per the area where
they settled down. Since I was born and brought in Tanjore I learnt tamil.

I am put up in Kellys,Chennai 600010. and my telephone no. 09444262865 .
