Sadanandaji Namaste,

     Thanks for sending this excellent analysis.....

But I have one doubt regarding this

My doubt is what is the source of likes or dislikes in us for the first
time....?

Say two persons had same South Indian Coffee for the first time.....One
might like it ,but other person might dislike it.
And as you said, depending on these subtler impressions on their mind, first
person might continue to have coffee and other
person might stop it.

But why these two people had different experieneces while having  same cofee
for the first time (When there were no subtler impressions
in their mind about coffee yet!!!) ....? How one person liked his first
experience of coffee and other disliked it?

Why people have different tastes when mind is just about subtler
impressions...?

So for a person who is having coffee for the first time, why should he be
happy or unhappy...? Since there are
no subtler impressions about coffee yet (no vasanaas) , there are no
agitations at the mind level which made him restless.
But still one feels happy or unhappy immediately after first
experience....!!!

Please clarify this.....


With best regards,

Sandeep
