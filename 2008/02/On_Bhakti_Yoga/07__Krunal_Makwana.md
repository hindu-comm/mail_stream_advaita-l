Jai Sri Krsna,

Dear Pranavji,

This is my understanding of the verse in mention.

Krsna who is the AtmA of all beings [1] is svayama prakAshita, hence AtmA is
also svayam prakAshita. Now if there were a difference of 'prakAsha' in each
AtmA this would then conduce there is more than one AtmA, which is opposed
to the view of AV. And if there was 'more' prakAsha' in one soul than
another it would contradict the Lords statement [2]

Now when Krsna shows 'preference' to souls, it is not because he favours
them or not, but it relies on the devotee who has recognised his own
position as one with Krsna.

The same 'prakAsha' is within everyone and hence the Lord doesn't favour or
unfavour anyone, it solely depends on the sAdhaka who is genuinely seeking
enlightenment and for this the Lord, gently rids them of obstacles which
pose a threat to his/her development [3].

Hope this helps,

Kind regards,

Krunal

united, I secure what is not already possessed and preserve what they
already possess.

Namaste Sadanandaji,
                                    Can you please elaborate a bit on this ?
Does the above mean that, the Lord makes no difference at all between a
bhakta and someone who is not ? The various tales wherein, the Lord acts as
a saviour for the bhakta(s) confuse me...

Kindly pardon my ignorance and correct me wherever necessary.
Many thanks in advance.

Best regards,
Pranav
