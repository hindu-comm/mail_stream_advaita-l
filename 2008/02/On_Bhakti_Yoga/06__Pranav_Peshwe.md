Namaste Sadanandaji,
                                    Can you please elaborate a bit on this ?
Does the above mean that, the Lord makes no difference at all between a
bhakta and someone who is not ? The various tales wherein, the Lord acts as
a saviour for the bhakta(s) confuse me...

Kindly pardon my ignorance and correct me wherever necessary.
Many thanks in advance.

Best regards,
Pranav
