I would guess that Swami Gambhirananda is reading the term kartR-rUpeNa
with
yajnAnAM and devatA-rUpeNa with tapasAM. Hence the "respectively,"
although
it is not clear to me that Sankara bhagavatpAda means it strictly that
way in the
bhAshya.

>2) If Ishwara is the kartA and bhoktA, does he not become a karmI

>bhoktRitvam at all? 

In the introduction, bhagavatpAda refers to nArAyaNa as Adi-kartA. There
are many
discussions in the various bhAshya-s as to why ISvara does not become
tainted by
the karma of all jIva-s. Briefly, the answer given in one place in the
brahmasUtra
bhAshya is "jIvaH ... karoty eva. ... kArayati parameSvaraH ..."

In the gItAbhAshya here too, bhagavatpAda describes nArAyaNa as
karma-phala-
adhyaksha and as sarva-pratyaya-sAkShI, which captures in what sense
ISvara is
the ultimate kartA and bhoktA.

Best regards,
Vidyasankar
