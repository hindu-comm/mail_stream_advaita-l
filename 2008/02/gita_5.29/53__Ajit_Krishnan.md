namaste,

In gita 5.29, Krishna teaches:

bhoktAram gyAna-tapasAm . . . gyAtvA mAm shAntim RicChati..

Shankara comments: "bhoktAram yagyAnAm tapasAm ca kartRurUpeNa
devatArUpeNa ca . . . mAm nArAyaNam gyAtvA  . . .

Translation by Sw. Gambhirananda "jnatva, by knowing; mam, Me who am
Narayana; who, as the sarva-loka-mahesvaram, great Lord of all the
worlds; am the bhoktaram, enjoyer (of the fruits); yajna-tapasam, of
sacrifices and austerities, as the performer and the Deity of the
sacrifices and austerities (respectively);"

A couple of questions:

1) What is meant by "respectively" in the translation?

2) If Ishwara is the kartA and bhoktA, does he not become a karmI
tainted by karma? If instead he is to be known as nArAyaNa from
pAramArthika-dRiShTi standpoint, why talk about kartRitvam and
bhoktRitvam at all?
