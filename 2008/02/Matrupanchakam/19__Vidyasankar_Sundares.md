I had the same doubt, so I went through the text that Sri Sastri posted and found them to be different from Bhashya Swamigal's Matrupanchakam. Interestingly, one of the verses has the same last line as the one in Bhashya Swami's composition.

Sri Sastri, could you share the source of the verses you posted a few days ago?

Namaskaras,
Vidyasankar
