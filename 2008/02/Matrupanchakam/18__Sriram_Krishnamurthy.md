Hello all,
Matrupanchakam was written by Bhashya Swamigal. He was directed in a dream
to compose the same by Sri Chandrashekara Bharathi Swamigal, the
Shankaracharya of Sringeri Math,  in the 1960's, which is long after his
Videha Mukti in 1954. In that dream he was told the following

" Matrupanchakam Likha, Ashtothram Vada"

which means write the matrupanchakam and Ashtothram. Here Ashtothram was
written by Bhashya Swamigal, detailing the Madhaviya Shankara Vijayam.

The Matrupanchakam in a detailed book form was brought by Late Sri K. K.
Sankaran, who lived at Mumbai and who was an ardent disciple of Sringeri
Acharyas.

Apart from the above works, Bhashya Swamigal had written the Shankara Puja
Padhati, which is a detailed procedure on worship of Shankaracharya.

Om Tat Sat,
Sarve Janah Sukhino Bhavantu,
Sriram
