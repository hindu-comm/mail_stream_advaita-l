A Spectacular SlOka

"nALIkAsanam ISwarasya SiKariNAm, tat kandharOtthAyinah,

gandhrvAh punar Etad adhwa caritE, cakrE tad uddhArakah,

patrI tat prabhu vairiNAm parivR^uDO, jIvA ca yasya aBhavat,

jIvAnte vasatam, ripu kShaya vidhau, dEvAya tasmai namah ||"



Please observe how twistingly this SlOka is narrated ---



ripuh = the enemies of

jIvasya antEvasatAm = the disciples of bR^ihaspati, the guru of all

the dEvatAs

kShaya vidhau = in the task of wiping out the rAkShasAs like

tripurAsura etc.,

yasya = for whom

SiKariNAm ISwarah = the lord of all mountains, the mEru paravatam

nALIkAsanam = has become the bow, (the weapon for shooting arrows)

(this is in referring with the paramESwara)

nAlIkAsanam = the lotus seated brahma

tat, kandharOtthAyinah = from whose lingua all the vEdAs set forth

yasya = for whom

gandharvAh aBhavan = assumed as horses

(Now the same word "nALikAsana" is meant in relation with `brahma',

the creator)



Punah = again

E tat adhwa caritE = E tat = gandharvAs i.e., dEvatAs

Adhwa = of their (dEvatAs) passage i.e., yonder skies

caritE = journeyers of those yonder skies (i.e., The sun and the

moon)

yasya = for whom

cakrE = become the two wheels of his chariot

( Here the word "gandharva" is used in dual meanings, one as horses

and another as `gandharvAs a particular sect of dEvatAs)

tad uddhArakah = who is holding the cakra i.e., sudarSana cakra

(viShNu)

yasya = for whom

patrI = became the arrow

( again the duel meanings of the word "patri", one as the `arrow' and

the other as the `wheel' of the chariot. Another meaning of this

word indicates the "bird").

Here the word "chakra" denotes as the sudarSana cakra and also the

wheel of the chariot.

tat praBhu vairiNAm parivR^iDhah = tat=tEShAm, patriNAm=for those

birds,



tat praBhOh = the lord of all birds i.e., `garutmAn'

vairiNAm parivR^iDhah = GarutmAn`s enemies are the snakes. Their

lord is "vAsuki".

yasya = for whom

aBhavat = has he become

jIvA = string of the bow

(Here the word "jIvA" indicates both the meanings as "bR^ihaspati"

and also as the "string" of the bow.)

tasmai dEvAya namah = obeisance to that supreme being, the god
