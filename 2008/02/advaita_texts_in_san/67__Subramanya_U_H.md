Dear Suresh and other respected members,
I agree with Jaladhar Vyas that to study, understand in originality and 
enjoy the scriptures, one must have basic knowledge of Sanskrit. There are 
plenty of courses avialable for learning Sanskrit through corrrespondence. 
One I recommend is from Sanskrit Bharathi , Aksharam, 8th Cross, II Stage 
Girinagar, Bangalore 560085, Tel No. 080-26722576 and 080-26721052. Their 
email is samskritam at gmail.com and their web site is 
www.samskrita-bharati.org.
They conduct the correspondence courses in 4 stages called Pravesha, 
Parichaya , Shiksha, Kovida.  Each stage costs Rs. 200/- only. The language 
is taught step by step and through Kannada, English , Hindi , Gujarathi, 
Marathi, Malayalamm, mediums. If one passes Kovida, it is enough to read and 
understand texts of Bhagavadgita, viveka chudamani, or Upanishads etc 
without difficulty. There is no age limit (May be 100).
For those who want to learn through fast track, they can buy a CD also from 
them. (Rs. 500/-)
They are also publishing one magazine called "Sambhashana Sandesha" for 
which one can subscribe and improve their language skills. The subscription 
is very cheap at Rs. 110/- per annum.

The Rashtriya Sanskrit Vidyapeetha,(Sanskrit University) Tirupathi- 517064 
. Tel No 0877-2287809 have also brought out a CD by name "Sanskrita 
shiksha". This is also good. This is prepared  by using Modern approaches of 
language teaching. Their web site is http://rsvidyapeetha.ac.in  and email 
id is registrar-rsvp at yahoo.co.in and vmuralidhara-sharma at yahoo.com. Price 
Rs. 265/- only. Teaching is through Audio-video for 6 hours.
I hope this information is very useful to all members.
Even IIT, Chennai has got on line free Samskrit course. Check web site 
http://www.iitm.ac.in and also IIT, Kanpur http://www.iitk.ac.in
Don't hesitate to learn Sanskrit even if you are above 60. ( I am 59 and 
still learning)You really enjoy the scriptures if you read the original only 
and there is no exact equivalent to Sanskrit terminology. This was made 
clear by Jaladhar in one of his postings. ( Ex: Shukla and krishna Yajurveda 
is translated as white and blackYajurveda which really looks absurd)
Wish you happy reading!
Subramanya UH
