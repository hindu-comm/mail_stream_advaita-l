Yes unfortunately we don't have any of those.  The only Vedantic works I 
have seen with padachchheda like this (its more common for kavyas etc.) 
are some of the ones published by the Ramakrishna Mission.  So you might 
want to consult your local branch.

But if you really are serious about studying Vedanta, I would advise 
everyone that it is worth your while to learn Sanskrit first before 
rushing headlong into the advanced texts.  Getting a working knowledge 
of Sanskrit grammar and vocabulary Is not as hard as people believe.
