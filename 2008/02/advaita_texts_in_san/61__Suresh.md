Friends,

Are there online resources to advaita texts in
Sanskrit (with word to word English translations)
written by classical advaitins? Not neo-vedantin
stuff, but the real deal! It will help one learn
sanskrit and scriptures at the same time, especially
for people who don't have much time to learn from
scratch.

Suresh
