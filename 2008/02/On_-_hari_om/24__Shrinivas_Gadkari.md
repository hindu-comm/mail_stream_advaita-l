Namaste,

One meaning of the phrase/ mantra "hari om" is:
hari (maha vishnu) is the manifest from of the
(akSra) brahma referred to by the mantra om.

In another interpretation "hari om" can refer jointly
to the shakti praNava - hrIm and vedic praNava om.

These are the two convincing interpretations of
hari om that I have come across - (I personally 
prefer the first interpretation).

Regards,
Shrinivas
