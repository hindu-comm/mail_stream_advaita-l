hari om
namaste

in my humble understanding, malaapakarshana snaanam is the initial bathing given to remove the 'mala' or the dirt. once it is cleaned the abhishekam starts. like, how i would take bath first to clean myself of dirt and grime and then start applying make up! it is symbolic of removing the 'paapa shesha' that i would have gathered for the day and then start worshipping with a purer mind. 

please do correct me if my understanding is wrong.

namaste

HAri Om,

I want to understand the meaning and purpose of malApakarShaNa snAnam.  It
is generally done before starting Abhishekam.  Is it different from
Abhishekam.
