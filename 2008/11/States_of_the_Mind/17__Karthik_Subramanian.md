Namaste,

Why does the mind experience a sense of awe, tranquility, happiness (don't know if it could be bliss, too)when it sees scenes of nature like rivers andmountains, primarily the snow-capped Himalayas? Does these cast any effect on the mind? Or are these expressions arising the Atman?

Request clarification.

Regards,
Karthik
