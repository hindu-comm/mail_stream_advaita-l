Hello,

The following quotation is from 'Auspicious Wisdom' by Douglas Renfrew Brooks; page 44:

"The author of the Prapacasara Tantra is not likely the "original Shankara," for a host of reasons including his acceptance of shabdabrahman, a position which Shankara the Brahmasutrabhashya author rejects."

Would the members please elucidate the position of Shankara on shabdabrahman based on Brahmasutra. Apart from shabdabrahman what other brahmans (?) are rejeted by Shankara.

Regards

Srikrishna
