Dear Sriram Krishnamurthyji,

Namo NamaH
But, I have a small doubt. I don't believe H.H. Sri VidyaraNya would  
have deviated from his Acharyals as this is mentioned by H.H.SRI  
GOUDAPADACHARYA as well thus:

In the Mandukya Upanishad, Gaudapada's karika verses (Agama Prakarana)  
24 to 28, Meditation on ' AUM ' is mentioned as a Sadhana for  
attaining liberation, where the contemplation is on the thurIya

sarvasya praNavO hyAdirmaDhyamantastaThaiva cha |
Evam hi praNavam gyAthva vyashnutE tadanantaram ||

Om is indeed the beginning, middle, and end of everything. Having  
known OM in this way indeed one attains immediately (identity with it)

SRI GURUBYO NAMAHA

Best Regards
Dev Babu
