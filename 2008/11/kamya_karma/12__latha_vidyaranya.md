hari om
namaste

alas! everybody is not so fortunate to get a Guruji who canindicate to themthe bigger picture! and it is not easy to even perceive the existance of one such bigger picture that extends outsidea narrow, limitedworld! we can only pray that people would understand that there is an antar chakshu that can look deep within.

come to think of it, is it not my own perception that such a world exists and it exists within me! all others' perceptions are part of my own perception! and that there can be nothing beyond my perception! :)) very very interesting!

namaste
