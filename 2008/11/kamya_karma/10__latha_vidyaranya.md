let not the List members look down upon the kaamya karmas. there are many who are so drowned inside the samsaara and are not even aware of the existence of an advitiiya aatma, who go after performing various kaamya karmas to fulfil their desires and to keep the obstacles away. they will only get entangled more and more into the samsaara. but that is their position in this evolution of the jiiva towards brahma and we can only give them a wake-up call. but accepting or rejecting the call is their take. when the great king dasharatha himself can perform putrakaameshti yaaga, desiring an heir to the throne, what can we say about ordinary mortals who are struggling day in and day out to eke outa living. kaamya karmas within the framework of dharma are ok and not to be looked down upon. the wearer knows where the shoe pinches and we need to only empathise.

Oh also I wanted to make a quick comment about this.

kAmya karma may be done with the best of intentions but remember how in 
fairy tales, the hero gets three wishes but everything ends up going 
wrong? Objectives do not guarantee outcomes.

kAmya karma is based on desire.  It is performed under the spell of 
delusion.  A decision based on incorrect or insufficient information may 
still turn out to be right but this is by pure accident.  More likely it 
will have a worse result than anticipated.
