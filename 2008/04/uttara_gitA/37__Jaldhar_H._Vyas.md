I've been looking around and I can't find any mention of this outside the
Laheri edition found on the web and in a Theosophical Society publication.

Yes several web pages confuse it with the anugita which is part of the
Mahabharata and has a more solid history.  (Shankaracharya is said to have
written a bhashya on it though it was not included in the vani vilasa
series.)  The anugita is also a "sequel" to the Bhagavadgita as this work
is supposed to be.

It is not improbable that the Theosophical Society simply made it up 
themselves. They are notorious for forging "ancient mystical secrets of 
the orient."
