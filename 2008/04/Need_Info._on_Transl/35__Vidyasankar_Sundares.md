Try http://sanskrit.gde.to and go to the "Sanskrit Documents" tab. You will find many transliterated texts,
including the Upanishads. There are no translations on the site, but you should be able to correlate with
the help of other sites/books that have translations.

> I've searched some sanskrit documents sites, but
> couldn't find transliterated Upanishads texts. I am
> looking for ten principal upanishads, preferably with
> word for word meaning. But even otherwise, just a
> transliteration will do. Most of the sites contain
> translations in English with no mention of the
> Sanskrit words at all.
> 
> Hope someone can provide more info. on this.
