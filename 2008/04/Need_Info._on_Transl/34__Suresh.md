Friends,

I've searched some sanskrit documents sites, but
couldn't find transliterated Upanishads texts. I am
looking for ten principal upanishads, preferably with
word for word meaning. But even otherwise, just a
transliteration will do. Most of the sites contain
translations in English with no mention of the
Sanskrit words at all.

Hope someone can provide more info. on this.

Warmly,
Suresh
