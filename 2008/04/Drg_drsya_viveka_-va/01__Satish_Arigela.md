,<<are found in a minor Upanishad,called the Saraswati-Rahasyopanishad.It does
not seem probable that the author of Drg drsya viveka wrote a treatise of
forty-six stanzas borrowing sixteen from another book.Neither of the two
commentators(Brahmananda Bharati and Ananda Jnana) has mentioned these
sixteen slokas as quotation from the Upanishad in question.Therefore it
seems to us that the author of the Upanishad has borrowed these slokas
from Drg drsya viveka,which,if true,would indicate the importance of the
book.">>

  Havent followed the entire thread but just have a comment on the sarasvatI rahasya. Looking at the contents of the work gives one the impression that it is a late(later than the above works?) composition.

  There are tAntric mantra-s in this work which makes one guess that it was composed
  during a period of synthesis. Perhaps around Lakshmidhara-s(the commentator on saundarya lahari) time.
