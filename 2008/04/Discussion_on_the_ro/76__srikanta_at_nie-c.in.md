This is with reference to the Email of srisrinivas Gadkari that Yoga must
have a place in any highly developed spritual discipline and that Vyasa
the progenitor of vedanta must have reserved it for highly evolved in the
spiritual plane.

Vedanta is an exclusive discipline free from the influence of other
theories,like sankhya,yoga,Vaisheshika,nyaya etc.here,the emphasis is on
the immediate perception or jnana of the Brahman.it is based on the simple
logic that whatever is Truth,it must be uncontradicted in all the periods
of time(trikalabhadita satya.)This it arrives at by negating(Neti neti)
the superimpositions created by ignorance(avidya) of the
Jivatma(individual self).To achieve this it adopts two
approaches:adhyaropa apavada nyaya and the anvaya-vyatireka nyaya.The
Vedanta is self sufficient in itself that the sravana,manana,nidhishyasana
of the mahavakyas like Tattvamasi,Aham brahmasmi brings the seeker to
realization.
