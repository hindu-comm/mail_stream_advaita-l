Dear Sri Srikanta,

All the points you mention have been discussed in detail earlier on
this list. Sri Vidyasankar had earlier posted an elaborate series on
the role of yoga in advaita-vedAnta, for which you may refer to the
archives.

Unfortunately, the series was never completed as the list digressed
into other topics. Even so, those posts are a real goldmine for anyone
interested in this topic.

Ramesh
