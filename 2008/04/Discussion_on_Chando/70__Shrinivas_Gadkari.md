Namaste,
I am summarizing some of my views on this topic:
1. If kuNDalinI occupies such a central place in yoga today, it should be
given an equally central role in ANY sufficiently developed spiritual
discipline. 
2. Hence, it is impossible that the concept of kuNDalini was not known to
masters of vedic vidyA-s.
3. So why is it absent in Upanishads, Gita, Ramayana, Mahabharata,
and sufficiently old Puranas like Vishnu Purana?
4. Very likely this topic was considered very highly classified information
to be strictly communicated orally only. So Vyasa honouring this tradition
did not mention anything on this topic directly in his compilation of the
Vedic literature.
5. Shri Sanakara too seems to be strictly following this rule. Even when
commenting on Vishnu Sahasranama - the name kuNDali, no hint of
connection with kuNDalinI is given.
6. One should remember that Upanishads are merely giving a very very
brief outline of various vedic vidyA-s. (Same with Gita). Practical details
are kept out - kunDAlinI very likely is one of them.
7. If anyone doubts that the concept of 7 chakras is new, it may be useful
to re-study the descriptions of 7 lokas in the Vedic literature.
Regards,
Shrinivas

In his Email of April 29,2008,Ramesh krishnamurthy wrires that
earlier,Vidyasankar has posted the role of Yogasastra in
Brahmasutrabhashyas of Shankara.However,Sahankara's view is that whereever
Yogasastra is not in contradiction to Vedas,Yogasastra could be
accepted.whereever it is in opposition to the vedas it should be
rejected.No where in his bhashyas he has mentioned about kundalini yoga.
 N.srikanta.
