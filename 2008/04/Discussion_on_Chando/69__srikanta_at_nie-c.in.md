In his Email of April 29,2008,Ramesh krishnamurthy wrires that
earlier,Vidyasankar has posted the role of Yogasastra in
Brahmasutrabhashyas of Shankara.However,Sahankara's view is that whereever
Yogasastra is not in  contradiction  to Vedas,Yogasastra could be
accepted.whereever it is in opposition to the vedas it should be
rejected.No where in his bhashyas he has mentioned about kundalini yoga.
                                                          N.srikanta.
