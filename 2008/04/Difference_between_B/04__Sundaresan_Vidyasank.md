To add to Jaldhar's response - 

There are many words in Sansrkit that expresses a concept in the neuter
form and a personification of the concept in the masculine form. The
feminine form of the word is a modified form with the same root,
according to grammar rules.

being - bhavat (neu) - bhavAn (masc) and bhavatI (fem)
greatness - mahat (neu) - mahAn (masc) and mahatI (fem) etc.

The above patterns can be generalized to every word that uses -vat or
-mat as suffix (e.g. shrImat - shrImAn - shrImatI, dhImat - dhImAn -
dhImatI, etc.)

brahman, being a root that ends in -an, follows a different pattern,
giving brahmA (masc) and brahmANI / brAhmI (fem).

Re: sarvabhUtAtmabhUtAtmA

It should be understood as sarveshhAM bhUtAnAm AtmabhUtaH AtmA. The
verse is referring to the perfected yogin. This person has realized his
own self (AtmA) as the Self of all beings (sarva-bhUta) and thus has
"become" the Self of all beings (AtmabhUta).
