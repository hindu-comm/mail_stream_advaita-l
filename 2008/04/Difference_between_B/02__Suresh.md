Friends,

What's the difference between Brahma and Brahman? They
say Brahma is nominative masculine, but what is
Brahman? If it's neuter, then why is it there, and is
there a feminine form? I am not sure how there can be
masculine form of Brahman, which is beyond gender....

Second, I need some help with Gita 5.7: In the first
three lines (up bhuutaatmaa) are all the words nouns?
Second, what does sarvabhuutaatmabhuutaatmaa mean? It
makes little sense.

I'd appreciate some response on this.

Regards,
Suresh
