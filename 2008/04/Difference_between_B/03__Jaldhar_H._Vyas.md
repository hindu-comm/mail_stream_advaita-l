Brahma (m) is the four-faced creator God born from a lotus.

Brahman (n) is the consciousness that pervades all.

If you conjugate brahman in Sanskrit, in the first (nominative) vibhakti 
it will be the same as brahma.

Brahmi or Brahmani is a name of Sarasvati mataji.

Yes.

yogayukto -- "immersed" in yoga (literaly "yoked" to yoga)

vishuddhatma -- whose soul is pure

vijitatma -- who has conquered the self (i.e. ego)

jitendriya -- who has firm control of the senses

One who sees the self of all beings (Shankaracharya says "from Brahma down 
to a a pillar") as his own self.

Such a person is a jnani.
