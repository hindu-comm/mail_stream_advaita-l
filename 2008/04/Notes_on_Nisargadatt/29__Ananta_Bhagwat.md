 Dear Sri Jayanarayanan,
Namaste

What you have mentioned must be correct; but I look at it from a different perspective. jIvanamukta is not only mere detachment realized in samAdhi or a death of mind but a unified epistemological-MORAL concept which arises when you realize vAsudevam sarvamiti (gItA, VII.19). In fact gItA brings out this unity clearly and beautifully in (XIII.27-28, and XII.13) without using the term jIvanamukta. In my understanding, Sri Ramana Maharshi must be the jIvanamukta in that sense, although I must confess that I have not read enough about him neither about Sri Nisargadatta Maharaj.

Regards
ananta

Here's what I received in a personal email:

----------------------------
The reference to the Above quote is in the book "Consciousness and 
the Absolute" edited by Jean Dunn, beginning with the November 21, 
1980 entry, the first paragraph:

Maharaj: "Whatever I had thought earlier has now changed. What is 
happening now is that even the slightest touch of individuality has 
completely disappeared, and it is consciousness as such which is 
spontaneously experiencing. The result is total freedom. All the 
time there was complete conviction that it was  consciousness which 
was experiencing; but that "I" which the consciousness was 
experiencing was there. Now that has totally disappeared; 
therefore, whatever happens in the field of consciousness, I, who am 
there before consciousness, am not concerned in any way. The 
experience is of consciousness experiencing itself."
----------------------------

It seems that NM had changed his ideas (!) on the nature of
Self-realization after the publication of the book "I AM THAT"
(1973).

It should be noted that Ramana Maharshi NEVER "changed" his teachings
on Self-realization.
