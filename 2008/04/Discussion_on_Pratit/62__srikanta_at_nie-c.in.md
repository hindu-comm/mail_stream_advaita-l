This is with reference to the Email of Sri.ananta Bhagawath on the above
topic.He says that pratititya-samutpada is not Fuzzy logic.I know that
Fuzzy logic is diferent from Finite Automata.When a machine is is one
state depending upon the stimulaus input wherther it is 0 or 1 in a binary
chain of inputs the machine is directed to next  state.otherwise,it
remains in the same state.The finite Automaton output depends not only on
the present state but also upon its past history.It is a sequential
machine as compared to combinational circuit.There is a feedback to the
input from the output through a memory device.Fuzzy logic can be extended
to neural networks and multiple input/output combinations can be
generated.incidentally i would like to introduce myself as a Professor of
Electronics in Mysore,India.
Coming to the pratitya-samutpada concept,the madhyamaka Buddhist is
interested in showing that no object exists in its own self-nature.All are
dependently araised.Rhe dependent co-origination or conditional
co-origination gives raise to the view that everything is "sunya".The Self
is a nullity like the "sky flower'(khapushpavath).
