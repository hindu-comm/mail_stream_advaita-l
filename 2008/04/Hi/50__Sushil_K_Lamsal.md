Dear all,

Pranam from a fellow seeker. 

I am a Nepali diplomat now working in Hong Kong, and the terrible materiality of this place has injected a gloom on me. Since childhood, the search for the ultimate reality has remained my passion, but am yet just like a bird lost in a maze of dark clouds just beneath the crystal blue skies. Could anybody suggest me how I could break through the veil of Maya?

Thank you for your consideration.

Sushil K Lamsal
