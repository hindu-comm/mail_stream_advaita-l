There is a clear misunderstanding on your part here. pratItya
samutpAda developed much before yogAcAra and is in fact the
fundamental concept underlying all schools of the bauddha mata. The
mAdhyamaka innovation was to only to equate pratItya samutpAda with
shUnyata.

The same concept is known as paticca samuppAda in the pAli canon which
long predates the mAdhyamaka school
