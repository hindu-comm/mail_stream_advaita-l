Namaste Srinivas garu,
                                         Ok, I will not ask WHY for your fourth point.Yes, I agrees that ISHWARA is maintaning the contniuty and keeping us to follow the maya. But then 
  "3.  why does mAyA exist? why does she create the world? are
GOOD questions"

  Are we ment to follow this cycles and IS it our main objective ?             if not what are our main objectives?

  What is the main purpose of our creation? What is mother's wish by creating us and seeing the pciture in this world because she knows it is only a DRAMA created by her. What enjoyment she is getting from this?
  Please comment on this.

  Ok sir, I have another question.

  What are this natural Disasters i.e means SUNAMI's, earth queakes.
  why they were ment? 
  Will it follow the concept of " If universal consiousness imbalances or disturbs, these disasters will come into the picture?, or Any reason you assign or which follows the natural law.

  with regards
  Kameswara Rao

  Namaste,

I will paraphrase your main question and attempt to answer it.
Q: When I wake up from sleep who maintains continuity in the 
state of my vyavahArika life (with respect to the state just
before I slept)? 

Let us briefly re-state the fundamentals so that we are on
same page:
1. There exist two levels of existence: absolute (paramArtha)
and relative (vyavahAra).
2. mAyA and the world she creates exist at the level of 
vyavahAra.
3. why does mAyA exist? why does she create the world? are
futile questions.
4. There are rules within the creation of mAyA and events
therein are not random but governed by these rules (again 
don't ask WHY).
-----------------------------------------------------------
a. So a simple answer to your question is: the continuity in
my vyavahArika state before and after sleep is one of the
rules in the world of mAyA.
b. Same thing put another way: Let us call the tattva that 
ensures that the rules in the world of mAyA are followed
as Ishvara. So it Ishvara's job to ensure continuity in the
state of consciousness before and after sleep.
c. Or we can define assistant tattvas to Ishvara and call them 
deva-s. So Ishvara has assigned the task of maintaining 
continuity in the state of consciousness before and after 
sleep to a specific deva. This deva ensures the execution of
this rule in the world of mAyA.

With regards,
Shrinivas
