Namaste,

I will paraphrase your main question and attempt to answer it.
Q: When I wake up from sleep who maintains continuity in the 
state of my vyavahArika life (with respect to the state just
before I slept)? 

Let us briefly re-state the fundamentals so that we are on
same page:
1. There exist two levels of existence: absolute (paramArtha)
and relative (vyavahAra).
2. mAyA and the world she creates exist at the level of 
vyavahAra.
3. why does mAyA exist? why does she create the world? are
futile questions.
4. There are rules within the creation of mAyA and events
therein are not random but governed by these rules (again 
don't ask WHY).
-----------------------------------------------------------
a. So a simple answer to your question is: the continuity in
my vyavahArika state before and after sleep is one of the
rules in the world of mAyA.
b. Same thing put another way: Let us call the tattva that 
ensures that the rules in the world of mAyA are followed
as Ishvara. So it Ishvara's job to ensure continuity in the
state of consciousness before and after sleep.
c. Or we can define assistant tattvas to Ishvara and call them 
deva-s. So Ishvara has assigned the task of maintaining 
continuity in the state of consciousness  before and after 
sleep to a specific deva. This deva ensures the execution of
this rule in the world of mAyA.

With regards,
Shrinivas
