Mr Vyas

In what respect are you saying that I do I not understand Shankara very well?

You seem to be under the misapprehension that this is a general debating
society or something however this is a list for "Advaita Vedanta according
to Shri Shankara"  We are very upfront about this.  It is mentioned in the
list guidelines you agreed to when you joined the list.  please keep your
messages on topic.

And personally I think Bhaskar is quite correct.  You don't seem to
understand Shankara very well.
