You seem to be under the misapprehension that this is a general debating 
society or something however this is a list for "Advaita Vedanta according 
to Shri Shankara"  We are very upfront about this.  It is mentioned in the 
list guidelines you agreed to when you joined the list.  please keep your 
messages on topic.

And personally I think Bhaskar is quite correct.  You don't seem to 
understand Shankara very well.
