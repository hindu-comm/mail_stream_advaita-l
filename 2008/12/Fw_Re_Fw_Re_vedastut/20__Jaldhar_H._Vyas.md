Why not quote a paan seller on Bhaktinagar Circle, Rajkot?  His views have 
about as much relevance on the subject as some politician.  If you want to 
suggest "Sankaracharya was wrong that there is perfect non-dualism in 
Advaita.. It is qualified Dualism or visisthaadvaitavedanta, from what I 
understand.." show it from the actual shastras not third-party 
interpretations.
