PranAms Suresh-ji

Sada-ji has answered in detail.
Will just add a couple of minor points to reinforce.
In advaita termsare subject to the rigors ofprecision. One cannot say "something exists as long as it exists". What is sat is always sat. From asat sat cannot arise and what is sat cannot become nonexistent(asat). Krishna says as much in his immortal words in the BG as you well know.
So we cannot say a necklace is sat for a period in time. A existent necklace cannot come out of nonexistence nor can it disappear into nonexistence.
Hence mithyA - it is gold but has transactional existence related to the subject alone.
And because no one object can be sat and asat at the same time we say the sat aspect of it is gold alone, but the "necklacy" aspect of it is mithyA.
Why time factor s important should also be clear from the above and from Sada-ji's beautiful explanatory post as well.

Onesmall footnote about dvaita (MadhavAchArya)- esp in regards to another thread that is getting started on this list - (my apologies to you if this offends your belief-system) -proponents ofdvaita seek to mercilessly condemn advaita based on a completely erroeneous understanding of Shankara. I would like to point out that advaita when analyzedemphasizes themithya natureof one and only one thing - the seeker himself - this requirestotal and complete Surrender to the Whole- a self-annihilation in totoof the ahankara with no room for compromise - DEATH -noless, no holding back, no holdingonto a miniscule bit of that verisame ahankAra that considers itself in anyway separate from the Lord - it is not permissibleand its lofty heights are hence inaccessible for those who find it difficult, intellectually, emotionally,to let go of the phantom of their individuality. 

Of course the latter is true for every seeker (regardless of their philosophical or even religious affiliation) whose sadhanahas yet to spiritually mature into vairAgya and sannyAsa - onlythat willsublimate and annihilateone's Ego and what remains isPeace, Eternal and "Real".

Dear Friends,

Thanks so much for helping. I still have a few doubts, though. It may sound a little dvaiti, so hopefully, no one will be offended.

Let's consider the examples that were given, namely shirt-thread, gold-bangles etc. From this, I understand that without gold, golden objects cannot exist, but the former can exist without the latter; and therefore, gold is real and the objects are mithya. My problem here is, why the confusion 'neither real nor unreal,' why can't we simply say gold is independently real, whereas golden objects are not. I am wondering why the word mithya, when something simpler could suffice. 

What I am trying to say is: gold=sat, golden object=sat (as long as it exists), and asat when it disappears. Two categories seem to be enough. Because no object can be sat and asat at the same time, when the golden object exists, it exists (sat), and when it doesn't, it doesn't (asat). So why mithya at all? This seems to be the source of my confusion.

Finally, I don't understand how time factor comes in here. Why do we define the real as something that lasts forever, and the unreal as something that doesn't. I know scriptures say this, but I am wondering as to why. Why is it we relate this to time?

Suresh
