Hari Om Shri Sadanandaji,  Pranaams!
Can we say one gets deluded by illusion, if he is prompted to action; while 
the delusion is removed by right knowledge; one is not prompted to any 
action.  Illusion may still persist.
As none will wish to quest their thirst from mirage waters. By delusion we 
refer to the me and mine notion arising out of non-discrimination which 
impels one towards objects. (Gita 2.53 and bAShyA). Delusion is our reaction 
to illusion. Delusion can be removed by discrimination. Then one's attitude 
becomes nirveda/udAsIna.
So it seems delusion and illusion do differ. Kindly clarify.
In Shri Guru Smriti,
Br. Pranipata Chaitanya
