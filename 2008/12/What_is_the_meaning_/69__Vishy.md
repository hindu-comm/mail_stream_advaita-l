Dera Bhattacharyaji

Yes, the feeling "I" is mother of all illusions. As long as you identify 
yourselves with that "I " than you, he , she, they , it all comes. More than 
all than comes big "HE" (God personified) to balance this "I ". if at all 
one can drop this big illusion of 'I' totally 
what remains is Brahman only ...this state is "aham Brahmasmi"

Thats why Ramana wanted every to start with the question " who am I ?"
the deeper one goes in to this question the illusion starts disolving and reaches the
pinacle of reality , that is Advaita, this is Jnana Marga the hortest and fastest
way of reaching the goal. This could happen in a fraction of a second.

Ofcourse , the other three routes (Karma, Bhakti, & Dyana) are there too for those who cant catchup this faster one, but it could take ages.

Dear Vishwanathji,

Yes, the universal consciousness or awareness is Brahman. "Prajnanam Brahma".

>From Veda we know that He was one and He wanted to be many. Then do'nt you think that it is not wrong to say that He is God, though He had created the world. He created the world reversibly. That is why anything that has been created is anitya or impermanent. Thinking an impermanent object is a false (mithya) notion. In thermodynamics one knows that in the reversible process the entropy change is nil. Similarly inthe process of creationGod has not lost anything and He remained as He ever has been. He is immutable in the eternal time scale even though he creates the world from time to time.

Regards,

Sunil K. Bhattacharjya

Dear Sri. Sadanandaji,
Namskara

That is to say, that He is all, the creator and the creation (the subject and
object as well as the activity of creation too.... Right??

Thats what I mean by " Universal Consciouness"...agree? The one which
is beginningless, endless, without form or attributes..... You , me,
everything including theearth , thesun and all the stars are justtemprary
forms within, thats is all inclusive

In this way, Is it not wrong to personify " God" and say he is the
creator , when the creator and cration is one and same withour any
'second'. Is it not the core of Advaita??
If so, there is nothing to know, nothing to desire, nothing to acheve, nothing
to gain or loose, nothing to do or not to do , but just to witness everything
!!! ( As Ashtawakra says to Janaka and Janaka realises)


Pranams again 

Vishwanath

Vishwanathji Here is my understanding:

God - Vedanta provides three definitions depending on the maturity of the
student asking the question.

1. Jagat kartaa IswaraH - God is the creator of this universe - this is the
definition all religions provide. 
The question comes why did he create? where did he get material to create?
where is He now? or where is He hiding now? If He had consulted me I would have
given better ideas of how to create? etc. All the rational questions so called
atheists ask.

Then we go to the next definition.

2. Jagat kaaraNam IswaraH - implying he is not only the intelligent cause but
material and instrumental cause as well. - karaNam kaaraNam kartaa... says
Vishnu sahasranaama. - this definition is provided only in Vedanta.
Hence the creation is nothing but God only in different forms - Hence all
objective world is nothing but name and form but God pervades the whole
universe
- Hence seeing God is nothing but recognizing everything that I see and
transact
with is nothing but God only - That is the vishvaruupa darshanam. In going from
1) to 2) we are going from eka ruupa - one form to bahu ruupa - multiple forms.
sahasraseerShaa puruShaH ...etc.

If one ask how can carpet is god or my shows are god, my rotten neighbor is
god, then we go to the final definition

3) Sarva adhiShTaanam IswaraH - He is the substantive of all - maya tatam idam
sarvam jagat avyakta muurthinaa .. I pervade this entire universe in
unmanifested form - all things rise in me, sustained by me and go back into me
-
I have nothing to do with individual 6-modifications- asti-jaayate..etc. They
are in me but I am not in them, etc. This leads to - aruupa IswaraH - since
name
and form are objectification of the subject that cannot be objectified. The
whole universe is Kshetram or field and I am the knower of the field -
kshetrajnam caapimaam viddhi sarva kshetreShu Bhaarata..says Krishna. 
Recognition of the adhiShTaanam - the substantive of jiiva-jagat-Iswara - is
the realization of aham brahmaasmi. 

That my friend is essence of God. Tat tvam asi. 

The above info is based on Swami Paramaarthaanandaji's talk on Bhakti. 

Hari Om!

Dear Sadanandaji,

Please let me know what the term " God" really mean in Advaita? 
I beleive it is only the Brahman, the universal consciousness in one and all.
Am I right in saying so?? 
Can I also say rest all are 'illusions' of different types ???

Pranams
Vishwanath
