Typo in my last post - normally I would ignore but here it is important"

IV Moksha involves freedom from change - Hence involves understanding I am changeless entity in all the changing things. Then only I am eternal and finite (it should be infinite). That is self-realization. If 1) and 2) in item I is not differentiated there is no moksha either - hence the emphasis on viveka - to discriminate nitya and anitya - changeless and changing things in the universe.
------

It should say- Then only I am eternal and infinite since any finite is subject to change. 

Hari Om!
