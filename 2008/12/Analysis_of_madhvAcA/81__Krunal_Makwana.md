Dear Senaniji,

Exactly my point and something which is my aim when undertaking this
work. The reason for doing this is to allow scholars to share their
knowledge with those less fortunate and want to learn.

As I live in the west unfortunately I don't get enough of a spiritual
'hit' and my main source of knowledge is from rAm and bhAgvata kathA's
recited by revered saints and also this list. What kathA's provide me
is the bhakti and shuddha-bhakti GYAna whereas this list provides me
references, points and an analytical view of the philosophical depth
of sanatanic advaitic dharma, which I am proudly a member of.

There is not intention of me to synthesise AV with any philosophy let alone DV.

I personally think we're all learning about AV both on an academic as
well as an experiential level.

Thank you for not doubting my intentions as I have made it clear with
my aim and purpose.

I understand your view but I do not find it relevant commenting on a
verse which is just a prayer to the Lord. I rather concentrate on the
philosophical crux of the work when it starts. This was only to get
the ball rolling and people thinking of the work.

Jai Sri Krsna
