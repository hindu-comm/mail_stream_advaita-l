Thank you Sadanandaji for taking your time to reply to my post. The main
objective of the posts it to analyse the response of advaita to the
criticisms laid down in the mAyAvAdakhaNDanam. I am merely looking through
the eyes of AV to analyse and respond to each statement rather than look at
AV through the eyes of DV.

I may not have made myself clear in my initial posting and would like to
clarify my intentions clearly. I accept the work to be mind boggling and
solely very hard but nevertheless not futile. The posts are to critically
analyse the work and then present the view of AV. The response of AV would
be through the mouth of AV and not the eyes of DV. This is where I would
like the senior scholars such as yourself to help me and others understand
our philosophy better.*

As the posting is to analyse and respond to MV through AV thought, it would
be futile without referencing our AcArya who is our main source of knowledge
and pramANa. I ask the members to 'chip-in' with relevant references of our
AcArya where they deem most fit.

*> **To attempt to understand AV through Madhvachaarya's work will be
scratching the head with fire-wood.** *

Which definitely is not my intention J
