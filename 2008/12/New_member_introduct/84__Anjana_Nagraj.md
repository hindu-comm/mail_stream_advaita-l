Dear 'selfless man'...i know exactly how you feel!! that emptiness despite having 'it all'. i, myself, was in India for 11 years, searching for that elusive thing one calls 'enlightenment'..finally i'm back in the West and happened to meet a Swamini who is from Arsha Vidya organization in Coimbatore, s.india...they teach Vedanta in the traditional 'sampradaya' method and ,ironically coming to the west, i have found the clarity and practicality of the teaching immensely powerful....KNOWLEDGE IS THE ONLY MEANS TO MOKSHA...ALL THE PATHS, ULTIMATELY END IN KNOWLEDGE....

check out their website- the founder is Pujya Swami Dayananda Saraswathi, a great Sanskrit scholar and fantastic modern exponent of Advaita Vedanta...this may help you in your search...GOOD LUCK and Bhagavan's eternal blessings

Hi, I've been asking help from a native Indian in how to contact an 
Advaita Vedanta teacher from India, but he told me I won't be able to find 
one online and gave me this mailing list.

I am a male 24 years of age who lives in Egypt, and have a very 
"successful" career, and anything anyone would dream to have in their

life, I have. But yet I am not content with my ignorance of the Self, and 
I'm longing for enlightenment.

I am not sure if this is appropriate to post in here, but at least it's a 
hope for me. Do you think there's any hope that any teacher of the Advaita 
Vedanta tradition can adopt me as his son, and teach me how to find 
mySelf? I'm willing to live in India, and leave everything behind for a 
drop of wisdom.

thanks,
a Selfless man
