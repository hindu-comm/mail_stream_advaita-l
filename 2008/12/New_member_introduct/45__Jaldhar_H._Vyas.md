I have read many books on adavaitha and vedanta but have never found 
complete clarity on the texts. Realizing the importance of 'sampradaya', i 
have recently joined classes run by a Swamini from Arshvidya 
Gurukulam..They follow the ancient sampradaya method of teaching Vedanta 
and it has helped me immensely.

It would be beneficial to have satsang to discuss some points raised in my 
meetings and i would appreciate having various points of views expressed 
on profound vedantic topics..
