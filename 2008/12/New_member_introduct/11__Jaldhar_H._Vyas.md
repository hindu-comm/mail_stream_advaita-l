Shantanu Panigrahi

Since the 2000 I have been studying religions and especially advaita 
vendanta by practicing Brahamanisam, as I saw it. It has brought me 
through a path of seeking the truth to lead the formation of a website 
http://unionofpetrolstationworkers.com/culturalheritagezone in which I 
have described my experiences. I am living in the United Kingdom, where I 
am still enaged in the practice of advaita, which I describe as being in 
one's own advaita ashram.

Doing seva at Chinmaya Mission.  Undergone 3 years vedanta course at their 
Sandeepany Vidyamandir.

suyash

Only from advaita vedanata one can realise himself and can understand the
maya(illusion).
