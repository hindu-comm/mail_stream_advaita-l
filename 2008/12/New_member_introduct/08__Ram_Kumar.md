Ram.....

I wanted to understand "The purpose of our existence" on this earth... 
what are we here for, how do we identify that and execute the same. How do 
we know that we have fulfilled our purpose ?  these are some questions 
that come to my mind.. i would be greatful to learn it from learned 
ones...
