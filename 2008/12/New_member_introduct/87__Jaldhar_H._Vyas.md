Well am a Smartha myself & i am interested in Sri Sanmkara Bhagavatpada. 
Advaita Vedanta is the crown of Hindu thought,Swami Vivekananda said that 
Advaita is the most scientific religion & to upbring religion from the 
havoc caused by Science ( Western materialistic Science ) we need to 
pursue Advaita & preach it to masses to know that they are One with 
Absolute .
