Namaste,

New year greetings !!!

After going through numerous recent postings on illusion, adviata, dvaita
thought of re-iterating a joint advaita-dvaita approach:
Example:

Here is ISa upaniSat modified to the advaita-dvaita theme: (as usual
this is my understanding of this upaniSat)

hari om
1. Into darkness go those who are devoted dvaita alone,
 Into a deeper darkness go those who are devoted to advaita alone.
2. Wisdom lies in simultaneously following the path of dvaita and
 advaita.
3. By following the path of davita one overcomes limitations, and advaita
 leads one to state beyond limitations ...
And ... the best combination of advaita-dvaitais bhakti.
hari om


Regards,
Shrinivas
