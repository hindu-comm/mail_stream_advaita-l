Dear list members,

 It appears from the messages posted, the concerned person is under
psychiatric treatment. So
it is not proper for us to post more questions / criticize his thoughts (he
does not know what he is
speaking/writing). To avoid more spam, as someone suggested it will be best
for the moderators
to revoke his list membership at the earliest.

 My sincere advise to Dr. Shantanu will be to report his symptoms / thoughts
to his doctors and
get medical advise / treatment at the earliest.

Hari Om,
Viswanathan
