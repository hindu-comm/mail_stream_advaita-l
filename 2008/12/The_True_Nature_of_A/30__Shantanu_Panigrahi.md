Pranam Shri Bhaskar Ji

Do you believe that human beings Jivas have an unseen atman (soul) and that all atmans (souls) are divine enough for Advaita Realisation? Do you even understand this question?

Yours sincerely 

Dr Shantanu Panigrahi

Kindly ask your *terrific time piece/voice of god* when the people of this world get the realization!!...I am eager to know about the answer that you are going to get from the *clock god*...

Coming back to my private mails to you, I was just trying to say you that we cannot build an edifice of philosophy based upon some *personal mystic experiences* and there should be a common premise to discuss these issues...If someone else, tomorrow, comes out with *miracle computer god* as against your *clock god* and say you are wrong in your *time reading*..what are you going to do? If you dont think otherwise, my suggestion is to have a professional counceling...

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
