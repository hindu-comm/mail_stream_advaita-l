Mr Ramakrishna

It seems thatyou have volunteered to answer the question that I posed to Mr Bhaskar on his behalf but I see no explanation let alone an thought out answer from you or any of theother sceptics. Instead you have asked the coordinators for my quarantine. Do you mean I should bebanned from the Advaita-L? If so, would you care to introduce yourself to me (are you a swamiji, Professor of Theology in a Religious college in India, or somewhere, etc) and explain why you have written this?

Yours sincerely

Dr Shantanu Panigrahi

I believe it is time for the coordinators to quarantine Dr. Panigrahi.

Pranam Shri Bhaskar Ji

Do you believe that human beings Jivas have an unseen atman (soul) and that
all atmans (souls) are divine enough for Advaita Realisation? Do you even
understand this question?

Yours sincerely 

Dr Shantanu Panigrahi

praNAms Sri Shantanu Panigrahi prabhuji
Hare Krishna

Kindly ask your *terrific time piece/voice of god* when the people of this
world get the realization!!...I am eager to know about the answer that you
are going to get from the *clock god*...

Coming back to my private mails to you, I was just trying to say you that we
cannot build an edifice of philosophy based upon some *personal mystic
experiences* and there should be a common premise to discuss these
issues...If someone else, tomorrow, comes out with *miracle computer god* as
against your *clock god* and say you are wrong in your *time reading*..what
are you going to do? If you dont think otherwise, my suggestion is to have a
professional counceling...

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
