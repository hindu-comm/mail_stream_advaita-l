Hello,

Miles to go before you sleep; miles to go before you sleep.

I thought it was only the last Prophet who conversed with God.

Regards

Srikrishna

Dear Sir 
 
Advaita - the non-dual nature of human existence; the true Nature of Advaita

1. The practice of advaita is a the highest form of worship that was found by
Hindus. There are various theories on what it is and to what extent it can be
practised without the aid of mechanical tools. Dr Panigrahi searched for Advice
and Guidance from God from around year 2000 after studying numerology which led
to an agreement with God that 3, 6 and 9 were divine numbers and 2,4 and 8 were
evil numbers to be avoided, with the Number 7 being Almighty Divine God Himself.


2. Detailed studies followed for years during which Dr Panigrahi submitted to
the will of God by checking his actions on all important incidents by digital
clock checking of his actions and thoughts: If he had a question he would take
it to one of the digital clocks in the house when he did not know the time and
if the clock numbers added up to a 3 (eg 1.11pm), or 6 (eg 3.21 am) or 9 (eg
14.22 hrs) it would mean Positive or do a certain act, and if they added to 1
(1.00 am), 2 (eg 1.10 am) or 4 (eg 18.22 hrs) 5 (eg 2.30 pm) or 8 (eg 3.41pm) it
would mean Negative (do not do a particular act). It meant that the mind had
been given totally to God to take over the reigns of the body and ensure that by
the time he decided to go to a clock with a question God would have acted on him
with perfect timing knowing he would be doing this and so ensure that when he
reached the clock he would see the correct answer to the question. As he wrote
in the 'Allurement of
 Reality' document available through his website, it was a mind blowing
exercise at its peak but he was determined to go through it in a bid to find out
the truth about Advaita. 

3. Through Advaita clock checking Dr Panigrahi entered into discussions with
God on all aspects of life on earth, including on the origin of the universe,
global warming, Fusion and Fission Nuclear Energy, religions and on humanity to
find out for example who were top historical human beings that had led good
lives from His estimation. He had also been prompted into actions, as for
example on the lodging of the court case at the Royal Courts of Justice London
in Spring of 2007 concerning the Iraq adventure of the UK Government (every part
of those document submitted was taken down by him as a dictation from God).
However he was also keen to maintain a distance from God so as to protect His
Good Name for he saw that he was dealing with very evil human beings and was
using tactics of warfare to clear his path forward. Dr Panigrahi therefore took
independent decisions when he needed to search for answers of particular
interest, namely on the documents he
 sent to the Supreme Court of India in New Delhi on a Public Interest
Litigation case lodged against the Government of India for refusing to return
his Indian citizenship. 

4. With God's blessing every step of the way Dr Panigrahi created the Union
of Petrol Station Workers which started off as a trades union but blossomed into
the UnionofPetrolStationWorkers.Com Foundation for World Development with its
website unionofpetrolstationworkers.com. 

Yours sincerely
