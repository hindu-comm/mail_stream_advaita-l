8.58 Reply to Mr Bejuban on the Forum. Drafted a reply 9.09 More. Added the comment that Sankaracharya was wrong in the there is perfect non dualism in Advaita. It is qualified dualism or vishistaadvaitavedanta from what I understand.

17 December 2008
8.45 Negative. After going through Advaita-L emails from Jaldhar H. Vyas that came through.
10.24! After Home Treatment Team left administering 40 mg Citalopram and 10 mg Ambilify. Was taken aback with the sighting of a '7' and did pranam, as darshan took place in His infinite wisdom.
Went for a walk feeling somewhat motivated by the last check. On return took a check 11.21 Negative.
11.31 Yes to posting the Advaita message on Advaita-1 forum. 11.36 Nothing more to change after copy pasting my bits from Orissa Khatti. Sent the email. 11.47 Negative.
Real fireworks started with Advaita-1 message had to be sent finally through Yahoo mail as there was no registration evidence. A response message looking very dodgy came into my email inbox. Checked half a dozen times before finally sending the email. 12.51 Also send to the originator of the response message. 1.06 Negative after it all ended. Did pranam. The Internet connection has been tampered with. Trying to restore it.
2.15 No to Is there anything? - after saving all the emails.
3.59 No to Should I send an email to Dennis Waite of advaita.org.uk. 4.06 No to joining the Advaita Fellowship Chat line. 4.16 No to Can I ask You whether Atman=Brahman?
as stated for Advaita in the Internet, for I had serious doubts. I do not know. I think humans or Jiva have a soul (atman) which is distinct from the presence in the body of Sri Krishna the Supreme God of the Solar System. Sri Krishna has two aspects Ram (the divine aspect) and Satan (the evil aspect). At any given moment in time human thoughts are under the influence of Ram or Satan or a mixture of both. The Creator God or Brahman God (Shiva) is the Paramatma residing in the body, and can influence the atman with thoughts and visions if He chooses to but He rarely does. Very evil souls cannot receive the divine influences of Ram but are easily influenced by Satan and an evil spirit that coordinates evil acts around the world. 4.43/4.54 No to do You have anything to say to what I have just written. 5.03 No to writing this up on the Advaita Ashram webpage. 
Edited the para after a short walk but 5.37 was to delete the word Maheshwara from after Shiva. Also deleted the word 'mind' from residing in the body and mind. 5.44 No to do you have anything to say to what is now in.
6.08 No to replying to an email message that came in from Advaita L.
8.41 Negative.

Yours sincerely

Dr Shantanu Panigrahi
