Dear all

We should all be grateful to Shri Balagopal Ramakrishnan for this timely pre Christmas message to sober us all. The full shloka is

Anudwekaram vakyam satyam priya-hitam cha yat
Svadhyaya -abhysasanam ce eva vanmayamtapah ucyate

And Sri Shankaracharyas commentary is
That speech which causes no pain, which is true, agreeable and beneficial; as well as the practice of the study of the scriptures, - is said to be austerity of speech.

Thank you Sri Ramakrishnanji

Dr Shantanu Panigrahi

Namasthe,

Thumb rule to follow while communicating is given in 'Gita' verse 17/15
( Anudwekakaram....uchyate).

Apply it in one's life and enjoy peace and happiness on the way to blissful
living.

Regards

Balagopal
