Hello, Marko

Just a couple of days ago I heard some one saying there is no Mind . . . . 

Who attaches labels to the Absolute?
Can some thing be attached to the Absolute? will it stick? if it sticks will it remain Absolute?
Which 'everyone' are you talking about?
If it is 'beyond everything' can it be Absolute?

Regards

Srikrishna

Dear friends!

That which all labels (names) are attached to is the Absolute. That is my
(everyone's) real Self which is beyond everything we can speak about.
Can you please give an opinion on this?

Thank you
Marko
