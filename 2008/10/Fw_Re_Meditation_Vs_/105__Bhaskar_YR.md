there is no need to feel that "i" am standing higher than the other fellow,
which would defeat the very purpose of climbing ! as long as i am climbing
the ladder, am at any rung, i am bound to reach there, provided i have the
desire to reach the top and go beyond it.

That is really very beautifully said mAtAji...IMHO, it is very dangerous to
think that we are better qualified in jnAna mArga & can skip some karma-s
at our will...What is the use of wearing sacred thread (yajnOpavIta)
without doing saNdhya??  what is the use of wearing tripundra, nAma, mudra
etc. without doing dEvatArchana??  And, I am not able to understand the
difference in *adhikAratva* among gruhastA-s (householders)...If I am a
gruhasta brAhmaNa but an *uttama adhikAri* (!!??), does shAstra allow me to
skip my nitya karma like saNdhya etc.  & allow me to  opt for some
substitutes??  I dont think so, irrespective of one's superior mental
status or higher adhikAra one has to abide to the rules & regulations of
his/her respective ashrama/dharma as long as he stays there.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
