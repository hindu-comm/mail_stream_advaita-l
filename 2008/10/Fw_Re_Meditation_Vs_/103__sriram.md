Dear Sri Amuthan
Your analysis is right.Self evalutation only will show whether siddha suddhi 
begins to accrue.But to stay put in the path to siddha suddhi is really an 
arduous task yet nevertheless it is possible by abhyasa and vairagya.And as 
we are in the samsara it will be like a tight rope walking without balancing 
equipment so to say.Raga and Dvesha are very difficult to root out as we 
donot know why we get attached to certain things in life though very well we 
know they are ephemeral.This clinging is due to avidya and jnana is the only 
antidote.To obtain jnana siddh sudhhi is fundamental.Some thoughts I wanted 
to share with our members.R.Krishnamoorthy.
