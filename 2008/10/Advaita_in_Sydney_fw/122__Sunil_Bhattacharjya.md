Dear Shri Dev Babu, 

Nice to know that you are having Satsang (why do you call it Satsang classes?) in Sydney. I shall be visiting Sydney shortly and may have the privilege of meeting you all there. Will you like to let me know more about the place, days and the timings of the Satsang there.

Regards,

Sunil K. Bhattacharjya

Dear Sudeesh,
Yes, we have regular Satsangha classes being conducted by Sri  
Vasudevacharya (ex. Michael Commins), disciple of Swami Dayananda  
Saraswati in Sydney.
You can reach me babunim at optushome.com.au for further details.

SRI GURUBYO NAMAHA !!!

Regards

Dev Babu
