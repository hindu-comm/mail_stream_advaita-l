>I am looking for one good book on the relation of Advaita and
>Christianity. Can you help me?

The following books may be good starting points, while they are not 
explicitly focused on the comparative aspects, they do touch upon it:

by Rene Guenon:

- Symbolism of the Cross
- Insights into Christian Esoterism

by Frithjof Schuon
- The Fullness of God: Frithjof Schuon on Christianity

by Ananda Coomaraswamy
- The Door in the Sky

A note of caution; while these scholars are very well versed in their 
traditions; they belong to the 'Sophia Perrinis' group and believe in what 
they call as 'the transcendent unity of religions'; sometimes, this makes 
them come up with positions that seem a little idiosyncratic or contrived 
(an example is Coomaraswamy's position on rebirth). That said, most of these 
authors' writings  are replete with comparative religion and theology.

Best,
Murali Manohar

p.s: Amazon seems to carry these as well.
