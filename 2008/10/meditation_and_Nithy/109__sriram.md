Dear Members
There is no point in leaving nithya karmanushtanas.Nithya karmas may not get punyas but not performing them will definitely bring papam. By  getting negative marks one cannot shine well in the exam.Meditation,namasankeerthan,attending poojas,participating in yagnyas will bring punyas nodoubt but abandoning the nithya karmas result in accumulations of papas.This is what Acharyas say.Over and above the Nithya Karmanushtana one can do all other additional sathsanga activities according to their disposition.And one should participate/do these with the only idea of getting associated with Bagavath Dhyanam.Krishnamoorthy.
