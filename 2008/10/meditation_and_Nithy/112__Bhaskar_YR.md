They should read the introductory portion of the Taittiriya bhashya where
Sankara talks about the
inadequacy of karma to lead to Brahman.

praNAms Sri DVN sharma prabhuji

Yes, according to shankara's advaita vedanta,  karma does not lead to
mOksha, it is because of the simple fact that karma & Atma jnAna are
mutually opposed!! (na hi karmiNO brahmanishTatA saMbhavati,
karmAtmajnAnayOrvirOdhAt..shankara in muMdaka shruti)..But point to be
noted here shankara argues here about sarva karma tyAga & saNyAsa...NOT
selective karma tyAga..I cannot leave my nitya karma citing the reason that
it is not useful in mOksha sAdhana and at the same time, earning money to
shoulder sAmsArik responsibilites...shankara never ever gives us the option
of *partial or selective* karma tyAga...

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
