Lately what with the utsava season I've been spending more money than 
usual so paying the rent was especially onerous this month.  But if I wish 
to live in this house I must fulfill that obligation.  If I don't want to 
pay the rent, I can choose to leave that house.  But can I sit on my sofa 
in front of my big tv and tell the landlord, "Sorry no money from me this 
month.  I feel I have transcended rent."?

Feelings are also inadequate to lead to Brahman.  The only thing which is 
adequate is to cut away the ties of ego and delusion that bind to samsara. 
If an Advaitin cannot for some reason do that, he must resort to the 
Vaidyanatha Diskshitiyam or other dharmashastras until such time as he 
can.  Then he may abandon karma with no troubles.
