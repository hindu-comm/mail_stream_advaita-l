Actually no.

The second type referred to here is nitya karma.  The first type is kamya 
karma.  Nitya karma eventually takes you to the point where you can take 
sannyasa.  Then there is no need for any type of karma.

So the suggestion is that the grhastha should give up kamya karma not 
nitya karma.

Those who renounce the fruit of actions (karmaphala) and only do that 
which is an obligation and even then with no other motive then as a 
sacrifice to the Lord, go to the brahmaloka where they along with Ishvara 
will become liberated at the pralaya.  This is kramamukti.  But 
jivanmukti, liberation here and now, is only possible for the sannyasi.
