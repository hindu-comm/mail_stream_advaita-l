Its construction looks somewhat like that of a shrIchakra but it is more complex with many more triangles.

I was told that duringsome pUja-s they use a normal shrIchakra as representing devI and this shata rudrIya chakra as representing shiva. The chakra also goes by the name shiva-chakra rAjaH.However the smArta tAntrika-s that I came across are not aware of any specialpUja being done to this along the lines of shrIchakra pUja.. During a discussion with Harsha Ramamurthy we tried to see if the chakra fits the model of the mahA prAsAda -Avaranathat he is aware of, but it did not match.

>1. jum or juum (joom - MM) (another book of prayers I have writes it as
>'jum' - hrasva)

Book of prayers? These canhardly be called prayers even if they contain words like namaH, pAlaya etc. It is fine if you came across this in some stotra books.
Please see shAradA-tilaka for clarification on the bIjAkShara.

Namaste! Jaldhar,

Than you for referring me to Mantra Mahodadhi (MM).

It is 16 th Taranga (chapter) which has details of mahAmrityunjaya and Rudra
mantras and related details. However, the yantra of Rudra provided here does not
tally with the Shata Rudriya Yantra picture I have. The Rudra Yantra provided in
MM has 5 circles of petals (8, 16, 24, 32, 40). It has no triangles/kona. The
Shata Rudriya Yantra picture I have has 4 circles of petals (8, 16, 36, 50) and
also has in the center 5 triangles pointing upwards, and 6 triangles pointing
downwards (making up the triangles) and has a Bindu at the centre.

The small write up also mentions that the Shata Rudriya Anuvakas are some kind
of Avarana Puja. (I do not understand much, how to interpret). It also mentions
that the details are given in Lalitopakhyana, and Bhatta Bhaskara detailed in
his Rudram commentary.

Also, when I see the 50 lettered mantra given, I have some doubt on the
pronumciation of the following:

1. jum or juum (joom - MM) (another book of prayers I have writes it as
'jum' - hrasva)
2. bhUrbhuvaH svaH RoM or  bhUrbhuvaH svaH OM (at the end of the 50 lettered
mantra)
3. how is the tryabakam mantra counted as 32 letters

Are there any published books on the complete puja paddhati based on these MM
details?

Any comments will be helpful.

Regards

Srikrishna

I was only able to look at the table of contents but the 17th taranga of 
mantramahodadhi might have what you're looking for.
