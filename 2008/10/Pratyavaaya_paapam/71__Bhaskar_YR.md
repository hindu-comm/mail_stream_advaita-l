There is another view that kAmya karmA, particularly
ritual actions motivated by specific desires, should be given up,
but nitya and naimittika karmA-s should not be given up. There is
a third view, and this is the upanishadic and advaita vedAntic view,
that all karmA should be given up for one seeking moksha.

Yes, IMHO, this vedAntic view with regard to *sarvakarma saMnyAsa yOga* is
meant for the saMnyAsi-s who have renounced everything for the sake of
jnAna..This instruction should not be taken for granted by gruhastha-s like
us, though our ultimate aim is Atma jnAna...For us, what shankara
recommends is *karmaphala tyAga*...shankara clarifies somewhere in
bruhadAraNyaka that karma which is done without phalApEksha is itself a
mOksha sAdhana & would result in Atma jnAna..(evaM kAmya varjitaM nityaM
karmajAtaM sarvaM AtmajnAnOtpatti dvArENa mOksha sAdhanaM pratipadyate)...I
dont think anywhere shankara suggests *karma tyAga* (that too nitya &
naimittika karma-s) as a sspiritual sAdhana for householders...Kindly
correct me if I am wrong..

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
