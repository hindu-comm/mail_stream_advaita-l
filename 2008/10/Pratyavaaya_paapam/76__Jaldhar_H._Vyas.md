Someone who kills another in cold blood is a murderer despite whether he 
feels like a murderer or not.  Karma whether punya or papa is action.

And Bhaskar has already mentioned that what the Gita talks about is 
adhikara for karmaphala not karma itself.

Right one surrenders results not the actions themselves.  "Whatever you do" 
does not mean "do whatever you like."

You have never really explained what kind of mental state would keep 
someone attached to car and flat, and family and Internet but ready to 
jettison the wishes of that Brahman which he claims to be seeking.

ok.  And?  The whole point of the exercise is to convince the seeker that 
the free-will based on "I want" and "I do" is a delusion.  It actually 
doesn't mean one has to give up the notion of freewill altogether.

We are, nearly all of us, brought up with our minds conditioned to serve 
Bhagavan.  How did we escape from that obligation and yet have a 
fatalistic attitude towards obligations to family and society?

Ok but that is not relevant to the current topic.  People like Janaka raja 
could contemplate and still go about their duties.

Having read the gitabhashya you know full well that fundamental or 
essential or not, Shankaracharya expects non-sannyasis to follow the 
vidhis of the shastras.

why just the adhyasabhashya?  If you like logic then you know it is a 
fallacy to only examine the evidence that doesn't contradict your thesis.

Seeing how you are reading the Vedanta Paribhasha can you show where in 
that work it says one persons opinion of "the Lords blessing" is a 
pramana?
