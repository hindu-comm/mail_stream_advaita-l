Namaste, sorry for the abrupt last message. Regarding above: my understanding: Yes.. the terms "will" and "wish" are the jiva's interpretations/superimpositions of/on Ishvara, based on its experiences. It is not to imply a dualistic God with personal attachments. The sampradaya says that the jiva born in the Order has the svadharma of abiding by that work (ALONE) -- the conducivity of environment I doubt is in reference to the work-choice, rather it is with regard to our freedom to contemplate on Ishvara, etc. Here the point is the Brahmana is born in the Order, due to past karma (or Ishvara's decision on that basis, as I put it), and the sampradaya says he/she is chosen for that work. That is an extremely small group, and the requirements were always consdired extremely stringent/demanding. For that person, it is paapam to be doing business, first of all, not to talk of the svadharma of that paradharma.

I agree that a person in the Order not doing the svadharma may only mean they get kicked out of the Order, next time around, born in some other religion and so on. That possibility I interpret as that it is Ishvara's wish that the person selectively chosen for the Order abides by that, following the rules to the letter. 

Ramanathan
