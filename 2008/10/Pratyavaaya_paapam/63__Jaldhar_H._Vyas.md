Sure but the basis of a sannyasis practice are different from a 
non-sannyasi.  The nityakarmas are based on the concept of the three 
R^iNas (debts) which accrue from living in saMsara.  The sannyasi has no 
debts because he is ever free.

True but that's not a good argument for nityakarma though.  The hypocrite 
who takes up the daNDa and kesari clothes without really renouncing could 
just as easily be the hypocrite who claims to perform agnihotra etc. but 
does not do it properly or, the focus of this argument, the hypocrite who 
claims lofty reasons for abandoning his duty when the true reasons are 
base.
