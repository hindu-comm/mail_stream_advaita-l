One is perfectly entitled to live with worldly aims in mind (as long as it 
is regulated by dharma.)  One resorts to Vedanta once one has realized 
that worldly aims have finite ends are mixed with pain and sorrow and 
wishes to transcend that and seek true immortality and true bliss.

What we see at present isn't unconditional being but conditioned by maya 
which conceals and distorts it.  It is overcoming maya which is referred 
to as "realization"
