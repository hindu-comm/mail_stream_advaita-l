Dear friends.
In order to discuss about the truth or even simply to understand it we
have to put ourselves in position which is separated from it. This is
the position of the 'noticer' of truth. My question is if doing this
we artificialy create even more illusion of duality: noticer-noticed?
Thank you
Marko
