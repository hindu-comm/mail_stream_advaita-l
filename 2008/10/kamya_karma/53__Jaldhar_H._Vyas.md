Oh also I wanted to make a quick comment about this.

kAmya karma may be done with the best of intentions but remember how in 
fairy tales, the hero gets three wishes but everything ends up going 
wrong? Objectives do not guarantee outcomes.

kAmya karma is based on desire.  It is performed under the spell of 
delusion.  A decision based on incorrect or insufficient information may 
still turn out to be right but this is by pure accident.  More likely it 
will have a worse result than anticipated.
