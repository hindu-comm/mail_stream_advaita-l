Yaduji - PraNAms

mumukshutvam is required to redirect the mind towards Vedantic inquiry.

Ultimately even the disire for liberation has to be given up since the moxa is not something to be desired but something to be understood as I am that. It is in being and not becoming. It is recognition that I am nitya muktaH not mumukshu.

Hari Om!
