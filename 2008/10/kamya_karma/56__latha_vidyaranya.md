hari om
namaste

yes, it is kaama that drives all our actions. but there is a very big difference between the kaama for the worldly things and kaama for moksha. the kaama for worldly things and the out come entangle us into the mire of samsara. but the kaama for moksha and its outcome help us to get disentangled from samsara.
