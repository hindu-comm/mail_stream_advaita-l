Namaste Jaldhar-Ji:

>>>>>
Some sections of the vedAntins while holding the supremacy of GYAna nevertheless believe that karma cannot be 
given up altogether even by a GYAni because of the residual sin that 
could arise for .
<<<

I think above position makes lot more sense because even if one cleans the cooking pot well and stores it away it will accumulate dust over the period. Thus it is necessary to keep on keeping removing the tarnish / dust through nitya karma. The primary purpose of all saadhanaa is chittashuddhi. Even for kaamya karma the objective is to make things better for the aspirant.

medhaa yathaa vyoma na ca spR^ishanti |
sa.msaaraduHkhaani na maaM spR^ishanti || varaaha upaniShada||

Meaning - Just like clouds in the sky do not touch the sky, sorrow-sadness does not touch me. 

It further states abut jivan mukta as follows :

raagadveShabhayaadiimaamanuruupaM carannapi |
yo.antarvyomavadacchhannaH sa jiivanmukta uaccate ||

Best regards,

Dr. Yadu
