Dear Mr Marko,

The fact that you wrote this posting proves, at least to me, that there is a
mind behind it, since a dead body couldn't have written it, even if it still
possesses all the neurons and brain circuits intacts. But maybe the
confusion is how we define the word 'Mind" in advaitic terms. It would be
good to know your definition of 'Mind' to understand the first part of your
posting and what you are saying.
Would you be so kind as to define it according to your understanding?

Thank you,
Carlos Grasso
