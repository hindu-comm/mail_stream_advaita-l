There is a serious misunderstanding of GYAnakarmasamucchayavAda here.  It 
does not apply in this situation.

But there is production here.  As a gR^ihastha you are engaged in action 
whether you "feel" it or not.  Actions produce consequences Therefore you 
_must_ regulate those actions according to dharma if you wish to avoid 
pApa.  If you wish to avoid the consequences of your actions, you must 
take up sannyasa.  The sannyasi is exempt from the production of puNya and 
pApa not on the basis of feelings but because he _has_actually_given_up_ 
actions.  Shankaracharya admits of two paths only: pravR^itti and 
nivR^itti.  If you are not on one you must be on the other.  It is a gross 
misinterpretation of his position to suggest otherwise.

...

Now it can legitimately be argued that the heart of sannyasa is not the 
danda and ochre robes etc. but rejection of the fruits of action and you 
may be a sannyasi in that sense but then go on to say...

That self that says "I am bored" is an illusion projected on your true 
self (as is the one that says "I enjoy." If you do not realize that you 
are only in the first stages of sadhana and not fit for sannyasa.  In that 
case the logic is crystal clear. You _must_ perform your obligatory 
duties.  As you say karma and jnana cannot  be combined.

Come on, you have read enough of the shastras to know full well that the 
Lord's wish is that you practice your svadharma by following the nitya and 
naimittika karmas set forth for you.  Arjuna did not "feel" like doing his 
duty either but bhagavAn set him straight.

No one is arguing that it is.  karma is for the person who identifies with 
samsara.  In the best scenario (that of the karmayogi) it can lead to 
dispelling that identification and _that_ will lead to moksha.

...but they are not constrained by boredom and other "feelings."  And 
correct me if I'm wrong but don't you live in a place which has one of the 
highest concentrations of karmayogis in the fullest Vedic sense of 
anywhere in the world?  What is it about your desha and kAla which are 
stopping you?

I am confused.  If one can abandon the obligation to follow vedic kriya, 
why is there an obligation of duty to a wife who after all only became a 
wife because of following the vedic injunction of vivAha saMskAra?

> That is my understanding. I am follwing my swadharma!

Judging solely by what you have written here, you are basing your actions 
only on sentimental attachments.  That is not svadharma and it is not 
advaita vedAnta.
