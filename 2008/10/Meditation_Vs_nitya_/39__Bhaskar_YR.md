I do not understand whether it was really Gondavalekar Maharaj who said
that nitya karmas are not that important or whether you wrongly heard him
say something else.

praNAms Sri Ramesh Ramanan prabhuji
Hare Krishna

This is what I said in my mail yesterday :

// quote //



I was talking to one of the devotees of brahma chaitanya maharaj (
popularly known as Gondavali Maharaj), he was saying after all we are
observing/following these spiritual practices for the sake of self
agrandizement/chitta shuddhi..what is the problem if it is done in one way
or the other??


// unquote //


Kindly note I have not said this is the direct teaching of Sri
Brahmachaitanya maharaj, I was referring to the discussion which I had with
one of the devotees of maharaj.


Thanks for your insightful comments prabhuji.


Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!


bhaskar
