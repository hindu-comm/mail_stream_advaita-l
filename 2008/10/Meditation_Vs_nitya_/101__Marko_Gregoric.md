Dear Carlos
That is exactly the point. Without exact definition there is no such
thing as mind. You have learned from what you read and what you heard
about all the ideas and concepts such as mind, neurons, body. Besides
all this concepts and ideas there is nothing there except the
Absolute. If you forget about everything you've heard or read in your
entire life (all names and definitions) you discover your real self
which alone is.
Best wishes
Marko
