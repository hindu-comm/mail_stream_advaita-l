Bhaskarji - PraNAms.

Please read again. I have neither resentful or praiseworthy comments on puja vidhi - it is a vidhi - meaning a procedure to be followed by those who feel that is important and necessary. Pujnas are done as per prescriptions. I just described what is done. Personally I am not a ritualist and that is what I said. I do my vandanam in my own way and that is my choice. 

>From my perspective, all prayers and pujas help in terms of chitta suddhi - as all karmas do. what is needed is preparation of the mind. Hence nothing against karmas for those who want to do it. As regards to injunctions, Shankara discusses these eloborately in connection to jnaana karma sumuchhaya vaada - in his introduction to 3rd Chapter of Gita. As regards to vandanam - not only at sandhya but all the time to that glorious presence helps. At least 3 times required but all the time is the best! If one does not understand, it is better to follow. If one understands one adopts. So please do not say that I have made resentful comments to puja. I made the observations that I see. Nothing less and nothing more. You asked for comments and I expressed my opinition as you can see in the introduction to my comments. You do not have to agree with them. 

Hari Om!
Sadananda
