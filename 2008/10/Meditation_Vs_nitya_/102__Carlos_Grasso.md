Dear Marko,

> thing as mind.
I kind of agree with the words, but the point is I still don't understand
what you mean by these 4 letters that your fingers wrote on the email:
m-i-n-d, according to your vocabulary.
Somehow you are not willing to do that (define the word 'mind'), or not know
how to do that.
If we don't agree on the usage of words our communication becomes not only
useless but there is no point in writing to this list either.
I also read Nisargadatta (and in deep, believe me), and I know where you are
coming from in these kinds of descontructing paragraphs. Unfortunately (or
fortunately) the internet doesn't allow the 'presence' of the writer to show
through so it's difficult to know in which measure you are the living proof
of what you write. But if you were, you will have enough awareness to see
that in this list, most of the attendees of this list they know very well
that all these postings are done at the level of the 'relative', and they
are quite aware also of what the 'absolute' level is.
So... All this sounds good, but somehow it sounds a little off in the
context of this list, and I have the feeling that you are trying to teach 'a
la Nisargadatta style'... (it's a common feature these days in our world
that many of us would like to be recognized as teachers)

To sum up this email, I'll say that until you don't define what you mean by
MIND, I will also conclude that you are repeating words you heard, concepts
you were told, which you cannot explain in other words than the ones you
have in your memory, proof that the process wasn't digested. Nisargadatta
and Bhagavan Ramana knew very well how to explain EVERYTHING at many levels
of understanding, since they were speaking from the Whole, not just
repeating semantic patterns.

Last thought, Lao-Tsu wrote the Tao-Te-King, right? (or supposedly),
and what are the first words of the very first verse of it?:
'The Tao that can be told is not the Eternal Tao'...
But after, he spent the rest of the 82 verses defining what the Tao is!!!!
You see the point? There is not even atachment to the Absolute level!!!
There is this ease to function at all levels...

Anyhow, thank you for your patience to read so far,
All my best wishes,

Yours in All,
Carlos
