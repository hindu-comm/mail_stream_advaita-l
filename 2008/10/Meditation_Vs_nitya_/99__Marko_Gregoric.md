Dear friends!
I can find no way to believe that there is a mind at all. I can repeat
what people say about this idea but sincerely I don't believe it.
Everything except the unconditioned being are just ideas. We can talk
about them forever but I sincerely can't see the point of such
discussion. Whatever idea or concept arises and dissapears doesn't
really change reality. Even the idea of the body is no exeption. Isn't
it true that the body is made of scientific, religious and/or
philosophical concepts? Without names and concepts which are the fuel
of every discussion, what is really there to discuss about?

Thank you
Marko
