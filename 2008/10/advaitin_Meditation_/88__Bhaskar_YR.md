Yes there are veda vihita karmaas for gruhastaas - but these are
constrained by kaala and desha niyamita karmaas. We do not have those
varnaasrama dharmaas - yet we do have some obligatory duties as husband as
a wife as a son and as daughter.

Kindly pardon me if I am stretching this too far...As per your observation,
it seems you have agreed that there_are_some obligatory duties for
householders..dont you think these obligatory duties are vEda vihita & by
not following this we are going against vedic/shAstric declaration??
Ofcourse, there is some space & time constraints in this modern day to
observe some rituals..But do you think just to give arghya in saNdhya, to
do gAyatri & to do simple devatArchana at the home have any space & time
constraints??  I dont think we can give inadequate excuses like this when
we are *enjoying* the other benifits of *gruhasthAshrama*.


Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
