I looked into this and according to Mahidharacharya commenting on 
Vajasaneyi Samhita (where this rk occurs as 23.32), in the ashvamedha, 
this is addressed to the sacrificial horse.  Dadhikravana is the Sun in 
the form of a horse who is born in the East from the Mahodadhi.  This is 
usually translated in English as milk-ocean but should more appropriately 
be curd-ocean.  (Cf. the Gujarati word for curd or yogurt dahi which is a 
direct prakritization of dadhi.)  One is also reminded of the puranic 
story of ucchaihshravas the divine horse who was born from the Mahodadhi 
during the amrtamanthan.

So the connection of this rk with curds is not totally arbitrary.

We ourselves don't use that mantra for marjana but during panchamrtasnana 
in puja.
