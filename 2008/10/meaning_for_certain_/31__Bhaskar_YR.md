We ourselves don't use that mantra for marjana but during panchamrtasnana
in puja.

praNAms
Hare Krishna

Here in South India most of the people use Apo hishThaa maNtra for
shuddhOdaka snAnaM & hiraNyavarNAshuchayaH pAvakAyAsu jAtaH kashyapo
yAsvindraH..... for *malApakarshaNa snAnam* and after each paNchAmruta
dravya (like milk, curd, ghee, honeyetc. ) abhishekaM. we use either
sadyOjAtAdi maNtra or chaturvEdArambha maNtrAH & upanishad maNtra.  In
sandhyA also along with apavitraH pavitrOva, we use Apo hishThA &
hiraNyavarNAH mantra-s...During bath, we chant aghamarshaNa sUkta from
tatitireeya mahAnArAyaNa.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
