Let me provide an example of a "historical practice" that is undoubtedly against dharma: the practice among South-Indians - including Brahmins - of intermarriage between cousins (not sagotras). Kumarila Bhatta quotes this practice in his commentary, so the practice is certainly over a millennium old. It was equally certainly practised even as recently as a few decades ago. However, the shishhTas will tell you that this practice is simply WRONG. In fact, Kumarila devotes pages to show that this practice is against dharma. Therefore, to defend all "historical" practices as dharma surely lands one in anamolies.

Since we're now discussing the "best" way to know and learn about dharma, here's an analogy with a person who is a budding student of science, and yearns to become a scientist. His options are:

# 3: Read a scientific text -> read shaastra.
# 2: Do experiments like "scientists" are doing -> practice aachaara.

However, the IDEAL and highly recommended way to learn science, according to the greatest scientists as well as the society in general is:

# 1: Study science under a scientist, or a professor of science -> Learn from a Guru well-versed in the shaastras and practising dharma.

There is no doubt that #3 and #2 will help, but it can in no way replace or be a substitute for #1, which forms the FOUNDATION of all dharma.

Up to and including the PhD stage, a professor is INDISPENSABLE. Most universities require PhD students to study under one or more professors, and recommend at least 5 professors on the PhD committee to approve the dissertation.

Perhaps there are great scientists who did not require a teacher, but they are exceptions, and exceptions prove the rule.

How do you determine "historicity" of a tradition?

If you recommend reading history books, you're also asking people to read a text.

If you're suggesting questioning one's family or local folks regarding the history of practices, then the farthest one can reach out to is one's own grandparents - great-grand-parents are most likely not living. The example I gave of the 90-year old grandparent shows that even grandparents of these days are probably not aware of their own traditions, and are an unreliable source of learning about dharma.

Again, I must reiterate that I'm trying to argue for the IDEAL scenario of learning about dharma, which is to study under a Guru who is learned in the shaastras, and himself practising dharma. The local traditions are supplements, but simply should not be considered the "ideal" route or a substitute for the real thing.

Moreover, the two examples I gave - of having an empty aupaasana pot at home and not giving away the wedding saree to charity - are both traceable to many generations.
