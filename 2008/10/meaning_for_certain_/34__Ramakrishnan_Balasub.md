Actually regional paramparas can vary quite widely. The Tamil region
generally does not use specific mantras for different abhishekhas -
but the Andhra tradition which seems to be followed by Karnataka
people, also uses specific mantras for different abhishekhas. I'll try
to sumarize some of these from a Sringeri publication when I get some
time.
