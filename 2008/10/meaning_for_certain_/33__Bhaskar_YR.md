It occured to me I may have been a little unclear.  dadhikrAvNNo... we use
in pa~nchAmR^itasnAna in puja.  Apo hiShTA... is used for for kalasha
jalapuraNa, and shuddhodakasnAna in puja and mArjana in sandhyA.  This is
according to shuklayajurveda and Gujarati parampara.

sAshtAnga praNAms Sri Jaldhar prabhuji
Hare Krishna

Thanks for the clarification..Just to add, along with dadhikrAvNNo mantra
we also use 'aa dadhikra paNcha krushti sUrya iva jyOtisha
pastatAna...maNtra also while performing dadhi snAnaM.

Your humble servant
Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
