You are absolutely right that all should pay closer attention to what 
those who are steeped in knowledge of shastras  are saying but I would not 
go as far as to say they are the only shishtas.  For one thing, if by 
shastra we are talking about formal written texts in Sanskrit, they are 
the heritage of only a small part of the population only.  (Not just 
Brahmanas but not everyone either.)  Many Hindus were not literate in any 
language until recently but this doesn't mean they were ignorant or did 
whatever they pleased.  Rather it is through the elders of the family that 
they passed down the structure and details of their dharma.

I think one problem that 'modernism' has caused amongst some Dharmic 
people (I don't know if it is true of anyone in the present conversation 
but in general) is to lower their self-confidence in their ability to 
understand their traditions.  Perhaps they feel it is more "official" to 
have things written in books.  But it is really not necessary.

Yes.  This is why even with an elder you can't just take their opinions at
  face value.  I recommend historical research.  Even for those oral 
traditions, there is enough historical material out there to give 
definitive answers.  However for political reasons, history is often 
distorted in todays Indian society.

The point of dharma is to peel us away from the delusions of samsara by 
controlling and reducing ahamkara.  I believe that if a person performs 
some rite such as keeping the aupasana ghat wrongly but with full faith 
and with no self-interest but a desire to do what is right, then Bhagavan 
will despite their ignorance have mercy upon them and grant them their 
just reward.  But a person who chooses to remain ignorant or continues to 
do the wrong thing even when they know it is wrong will suffer the 
consequences of that sin.  So I would not call that 90 year old man a 
fool for his prior practices but only if _after_ that day he continued to 
err.

That I would not call a tradition because it lacks a historical basis 
accross generations.  I bet that mans grandfather could have set him 
straight just as well as the vidwan.

This is also not what I would call a tradition because it is clearly based 
on self-interest and greed (on the brides part) not a desire to do what is 
right.  But not all (apparent) deviations from the shastras are like that. 
I'm just saying the criteria cannot simply be what some book says.

Luckily it is not too hard to distinguish between an anomaly which is 
sincere and genuine and one which is the result of greed or ignorance.
