As a caveat let me say that the following information is from a Gujarati 
book on gotras and thus the information _may_ perhaps be invalid for South 
Indians.  So I hope some knowledgeable South Indian will confirm or 
correct.

Anyway, paurukutsa gotra has three pravaras: purukutsa, trAsadAsyu, and 
angirasa.
