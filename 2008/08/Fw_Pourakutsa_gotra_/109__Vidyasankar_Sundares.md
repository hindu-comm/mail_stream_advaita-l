The set of 3 (or 5 or sometimes even 7) rishis for a gotra is unique. No two gotra-s can share the same pravara. However, some gotra-s have multiple names. The parukutsa gotra is also called vishNuvRddha, which is the name found in the nirNayasindhu and found in usage in the Maharashtra region. There seems to be some geographical and/or sectarian preference for using one or the other name for one's gotra.
