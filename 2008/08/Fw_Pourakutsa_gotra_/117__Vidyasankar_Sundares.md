That is puzzling to me, as I thought that the vasishTha gotra proper is an
ekArsheya gotra and the kauNDinya gotra is a trayArsheya one. i.e., the
pravara of vasishTha gotra lists only vasishTha, while kauNDinya is vasishTha
maitrAvAruNa kauNDinya. Because of this, they are considered different
gotra-s. Perhaps, some groups refer to the trayArsheya gotra as vasishTha
by customary usage.

The order of Rshis listed in the pravara is not fixed. Different groups of people
may use different orders, again depending on regional or family customs. For
example, some bhAradvAja-s use the pravara AngIrasa bArhaspatya bhAradvAja,
but others use the order bhAradvAja bArhaspatya AngIrasa. Yet others omit the
bhAradvAja in the pravara, as it is covered in the gotra name.

If two people share the same gotra name, they are called sa-gotra. If two people
share the same pravara or a substantial part of the pravara, they are sa-pravara.
e.g. bhArgava gotra and SrIvatsa gotra are sa-pravara, because three of the five
Rshi names found in SrIvatsa gotra's pravara are the same as the three Rshi names
in the bhArgava pravara.
