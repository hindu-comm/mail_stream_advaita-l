The correct ITRANS, to my knowledge, is ShaDmarShaNa and not SaThamarShaNa.

trasadasyu, who figures in the pravara list of this gotra, was an
ikShvAku king and purukutsa was his son. The ShaDmarShaNa gotra
represents descendants of trasadasyu who were absorbed into the
A~Ngirasa clan of brAhmaNa-s through marriage, hence they are
categorized as "kevala A~Ngirasa".

Therefore, my understanding is that paurukutsa and ShaDmarShaNa
represent the same gotra.
