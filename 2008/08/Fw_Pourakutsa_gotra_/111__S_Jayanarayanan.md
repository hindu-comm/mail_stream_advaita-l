The above may not be true if the following is:

I can say with certainty that the same 3 Rishis belong to the SaThamarShaNa Gotra, because I belong to this Gotra. The order is slightly different: Angirasa, Paurukutsya and trAsadasya.

When I mentioned this to my father, he said that IF the Paurukutsa Gotra and SaThamarShaNa Gotra share the same 3 Rishis in their pravaras, then they are to be treated as sa-gotras, even though the actual Gotra name may be different.

I find it interesting that Amuthan was aware of the Rishis in the SaThamarShaNa Gotra, because I believe this is the most common Iyengar (Sri VaishNava) Gotra.

Perhaps the SaThamarShaNa Gotra is also another name for the Paurukutsa Gotra?
