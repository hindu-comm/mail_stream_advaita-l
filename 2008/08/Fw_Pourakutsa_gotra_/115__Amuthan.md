Dear list members,
  Sorry to drag on into this topic which I suppose is irrelevant to
advaita siddhAnta, but i'm interested in getting some doubts cleared.
Those who find it irrelevant may ignore it.

One of my friends who is knowledgeable in these issues told me that
the vasishTha and kauNDiNya gotra-s are _different_ gotra-s though
they have the same set of 3 RshIs (vasishTha, maitrAvaruNa,
kauNDiNya). Is this right? While on the topic, what exactly does it
mean to say that two gotra-s as sagotra?

I think this might be true for this particular gotra. I found one more
reference to this fact somewhere online. Thanks for the information.

I'm not sure what your source is, but atleast in my family they
pronounce it as SaThamarShaNa and not ShaDmarShaNa. It may be possible
that this is yet another name for this gotra, but I haven't heard
about it earlier.

amudan.
