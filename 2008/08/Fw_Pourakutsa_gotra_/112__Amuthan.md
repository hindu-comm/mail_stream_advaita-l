I knew about the Rshi-s in SaThamarshaNa gotra since I too belong to
this gotra. I'm not sure if SaThamarshaNa is the most common ayya~NgAr
gotra though its probably one of the most important given the fact
that some of the most important AcArya-s of the SrIvaishNava
sampradAya like nAthamuni, YAmunAcArya, tirumalai nambi etc. were from
this gotra.

I'm also a little curious to know if this is true :)
