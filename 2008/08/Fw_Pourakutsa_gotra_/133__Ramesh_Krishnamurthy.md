I had come across the said article and I think it had some errors.
Gotra is a patrilineal marker for sure but there are other finer
points that need to be kept in mind. For example, among ancient
kshatriya-s there was a practice of using their brahmana priest's
gotra for ritual purposes, in addition to their ancestral gotra.

The term "Gautama" in Gautama Buddha is probably a gotra marker as the
Dr Balakrishna says, but this indicates that that his family may have
had a brahmana priest of the Gautama gotra. The ancient bauddha texts
are clear that prince siddhartha was a kshatriya in the Ikshvaku line
(same as Sri Ramachandra of the Ramayana).
