Dear friends!

There is no way I can separate my self from anything at all.

1.Why is that such a big issue to say that I am self-realized?

2.For me it doesn't change anything if I claim it or not. It is a beautiful
thing, therefore why shouldn't I share it ?

I am not very smart and I do not have the same knowledge you have but for me
that is not very important. I am learning a lot from you. But that doesn't
change the "bottom" reality.

Yours sincerely

Marko
