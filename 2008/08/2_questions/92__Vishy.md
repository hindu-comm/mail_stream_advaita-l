Yes, unless we drop ourselves completely we cant realize the real self. Completely meaning even what we acquiered in the name of knowledge. When 'You" are not there where ' your' knowledge can be!! When you drop your self completely what remains is 'Krisna' himself.. Than whatever you say would be as good as Geetha, why as good as " it would be 'The Geetha' itself. As long as you use borrowed
knowledge you cant be authentic. Unless you are authentic you cant be your trueself. Perhaps with what you gained thru such an acquiered knowledge you can understand about the truth and not the truth itself.

Regards
Vishwanath

My friend

To realize your real nature  you have to forget everything you've
heard or read in your entire life. That which remains is qualityless.
