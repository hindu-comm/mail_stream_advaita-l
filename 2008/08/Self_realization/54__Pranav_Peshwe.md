Who is being offended ? Who is the offender ? Its all in the mind. Only
truth exists, not the offender or the offended. Such abstract are your
sentences dear Marko.
I dare not say that they lack meaning. I would merely say that, they are
off-topic on _this_ list. They might be of immense meaning and value
somewhere else (a Zen list maybe ?).
       This list, as somebody already has pointed out is aimed just at
discussing Advaita Vedanta. Whether AV leads to self-realization or not is a
different question, in which members of this list may or may not be
interested.

Kindly CMIIW.

Best regards,
Pranav
