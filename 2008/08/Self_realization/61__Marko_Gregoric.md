 Dear Lakshminarayana

"The flower is self-realized" was meant to be more like a short poem. Its
meaning is that no conditions are there to be self-realized. You and the
flower  are Brahman regardless of the ability to think or know something.
Like any other thing thoughts and knowledge are Brahman too. So where is the
question to realize Brahman if there is no other thing or entity there
except Him?

To everybody:
I am happy to write again, and I am sorry I was rude this morning!

Yours sincerely

Marko
