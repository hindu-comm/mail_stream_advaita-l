Dear Marko,

Please continue to post. However, might I request you to add some explanations to your sentences for the purpose of clarity. For example, if you say that the flower is self-realized, I might not understand the context of that statement or be able to completely comprehend its meaning. A brief explanation would definitely help to fill in the gaps. This is purely a personal request and it is completely up to you to decide whether you want to honor it or not. Thanks!

Best Regards
Lakshminarayana

You guys are very funny. This attitude of your's reminds me of China
where the authorities decide what people can write. But nevertheless I
will accept your request.
