We have to keep in mind that after Parashurama killed the kshatriya
kings in his 21 expeditions the next generation of the Kshatriya kings
were actually fathered by the Brahmin rishis.  In a slightly different
condition even Vedavyasa was the biological father of Dhritarashtra
and Pandu. Moreover we have also to keep in mind that though there was
the restriction of pratiloma marriage yet the Brahmana, Kshatriya and
the Vaishyas were dvijas and all had Vedic education except that the
Brahmins were alone entitled to be teachers of Veda. So the difference
was not that insurmountable.

On page 246 -- Mandhatr (a famous king in Ikshvaku lineage and hence a descendant of Surya and also Kasyapa Rsi through wife Aditi) had a son Purukutsa and whose son was Trasadasyu (both still Kshatriyas).  Trasadasyu's grandson Visnuvrddha and subsequent generations became Angirasa Brahmins (viz the Keval Angirasa gotra: Pourakutsa/Shatmarshana/Visnuvrddha gotra we have been discussing).  Apparently Visnuvrddha married an Angirasa clan daughter.  I have heard there were famous Sri Vaisnava Brahmins (Iyengars)belonging to this gotra. (ref Sri Vaisnava group lists,eg, Sri Pedia, etc)

Also Rohatgi caste of UP claim descent from Rama's ancestor Harischandra.

Same would apply for Kevala Bhargava gotras and perhaps some others.  Or is it that Visnuvrddha became a Brahmin just like Vishwamitra.  (Now many modern day reformers would say cannot any male become a Brahmin in the current birth and start a new gotra by marrying a Brahmin female)
