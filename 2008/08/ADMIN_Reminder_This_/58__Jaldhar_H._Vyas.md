Yes the authorities do tell you what to write.  On the page you subscribed 
from it says the purpose of this list is to discuss Advaita Vedanta. 
Before subscribing you are asked to look at the archives to get a feel for 
the topic of the list.  Before subscribing you are asked to read and 
acknowledge the guidelines of this list.  If one still doesn't understand 
the purpose of this list, let me emphasize

It is not for general social chat

It is not a vehicle for spamming hundreds of people with non-sequiters

It is not for discussing anything other than Advaita Vedanta or topics 
closely connected to Advaita Vedanta.  And note discussion means dialogue
not monologue.

Now the moderators do not insist on this in a heavy handed way for fear of 
being branded Chinese and also because we expect you as a grown up to be 
able to discipline yourself.  So please do so.
