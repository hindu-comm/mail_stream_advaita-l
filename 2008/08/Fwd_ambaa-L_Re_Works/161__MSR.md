Dear ravi,

Sometime back you asked me about the identity of the author of 
ChandrikAkhyA and Smrti MuktA phalam.  Here are the words of Shri 
Bharati Tirtha Mahaswamigal of Sringeri Sarada Pitham.

Shri Swamigal had confirmed that both the authors are entirely 
different.  The author of ChandrikAkhyA is Shri Vaidyanatha Dikshitar 
who hails from Kasi whereas the author of Smrti MuktA Phala, who also 
holds the same name is from Tamil Nadu.  And both are NOT SAME.

Hope your doubt is cleared.

AjnAnAm JAhnavI tIrtham vidyA tirtham vivekinAm
sarveshAm sukhadam tirtham bhAratI tIrtham Asraye...

With regards,
Sriram
