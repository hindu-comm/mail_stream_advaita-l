namaste, Our agreeing or not agreeing with any statement is no criterion to
decide
whether it represents Truth.

Why should we write any statement at all? If our conviction is not powerful
enough
to force us to write it, we should not write it. We write
(1) because we cannot help writing it;
(2) because we have the overpoweringly benevolent will to share our
Experience --
     for the benefit of all.
