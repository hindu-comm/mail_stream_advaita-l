Dear Sh. Subash Razdan ji,
With my limited knolwdge of Vedas I could not find Gurukul Sytem of Education in Vedas. I shall be grateful if referece to Vedic riks/mantars/hymns could be given
about Gurukul system of education. In my book Glimpses of Vedic Metaphysics based on Vedic decription, I have given some details about Vedic Education System which do not mention about Gurukul system. Incidentally the book is available on the Internet and can be accessed through google.com, yahoo.com or even lulu.com

It is necessary to inform the
 followers of Sanatan Dharma what is meant by Gurukul System and why it is Vedic?" How Gurukuls are harminising divine, spiritual and material knowledge of matter which has unsuspected vitality owing to energy principle in Shuniya (cosmic void)? Do Gurukuls provide education till the age of 48 years for the Rudrais to qualify for Adityas? I have yet to see a single Gurukul India following Vedic Education system. If it is there kindly let me know its location and address. At Haridwar/Rishikes I did meet some students of Gurukul and noticed some of them were very unhappy about the kind of education being imparted there. They had no idea of void (shuniya).
With kind regards,
P.K.Sabhlok
