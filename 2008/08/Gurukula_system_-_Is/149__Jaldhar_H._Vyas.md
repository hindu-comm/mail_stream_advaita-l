Please ignore the kind of silly people who think "mantars" teach shunya. 
You are doing a wonderful service.  (My excuse?  I am not an amex card 
holder.)

A gurukul is simply "the gurus house"  Then and now some teachers were 
rich, some were poor.  Then and now Some learning took place in 
formal institutions with hundreds of pupils, some learning took place on an 
ad-hoc basis with a few or only one pupil.  The idea there is some 
special 48 year Vedic curriculum is simply absurd.
