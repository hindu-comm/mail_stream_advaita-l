Dear friends!

There is no difference between you and me except for the different knowledge
and/or beliefs each one of us may have. None of the different "knowledges"
is more true than any other.
But if we forget all that knowledge we find our real nature. There are
different "knowledges" but the knower is one. In this view the concept of
"one" falls too. Our real nature is beyond one and even this is another
concept. The idea of oneness is in my opinion also just a nice idea. The
truth is something that everybody agree with. Everybody agree on no idea, so
That must be the truth.

Marko
