Greetings!

 I'd like to tell you about a project I submitted to Members Project.
 It's called "Save Vedic Education and Gurukula system" and with your
 support it could get funding from American Express. To nominate this

 project for potential funding, please go to Save Vedic Education and Gurukula system
Members
 Project is an exciting initiative that brings people together to make a
 difference in the world. It's simple. People go online to share ideas

 for projects â€” and ultimately vote on which projects will share $2.5
 million in funding from American Express.
In
 2007, Members Project provided clean drinking water to children all

 across Africa. What will Members Project do this year? The decision is
 yours. Please nominate my project.
 I
 request EACH in your family to nominate this project separately. Each
 nomination counts. Kindly forward this message to your friends and

 contacts.

 Let us do our bit to preserve the glorious Vedic heritage. Thank you for your support.
 Regards
 Srikrishna650-380-1890
