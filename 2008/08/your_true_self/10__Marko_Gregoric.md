Dear Vishy

  To be self-realized one has to realize exactly what you wrote:


> The real self (brahman) need not realize anything. When you realize that
> you are not there
> that is realization. Actually there is nothing to realize....just drop the
> what we have been carrying in the name of knowledge . Knowledge is history/
> dead experience of some one else...  Knowing is continuous ....it is 'The
> Awareness'. <listmaster at advaita-vedanta.org>
