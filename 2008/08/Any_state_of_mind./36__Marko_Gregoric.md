Dear Lakshminarayana

To discover what I am I had to forget everything anybody said (me
included) about anything in my entire life. That which I was left with
I cannot put a name on.(even awareness is just a nice concept)
 That is always there. Stay in that as much as you can and you'll see
the changes very soon.
