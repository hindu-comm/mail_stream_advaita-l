Interested in learning:

a) Sri Sankara's teachings and the Advaita concept;
b) Sanskrit, to be able to understand and interpret Sri Sankara's bhasyams on Bhagavat Gita and other works...and also perhaps look at interpreting other versions of The Gita, with an objective to understand/interpret the meaning closest to the truth;
c) General knowledge of Sanskrit and Hinduism;
d) To practise good habits (basic yogas) that would enable me achieve the above three more efficiently
