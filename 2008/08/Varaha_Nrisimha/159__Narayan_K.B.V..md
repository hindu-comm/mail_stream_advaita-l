Dear LearnedMembers of the Group,
Could any of the learned members throw light on the concept of Varaha Nrisimha, where the conept has its origin and the relationship of Lord Varaha Nrisimha with the Lord in the form of Nrisimha. Is there any website where I can get more details, phothos etc.
Best Regards,
Narayan
