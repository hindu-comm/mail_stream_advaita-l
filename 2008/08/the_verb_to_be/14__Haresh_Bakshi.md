namaste, the noticer of "to be" has no property of being or non-being; but
the
act of noticing has the property of being when noticing is taking place, and
has
the property of non-being when the act of noticing ceases.

Whether noticing takes place or not, the noticer always "is" -- eternally
the
Present Tense of "to be".

In other words, the Experiencer is not the same as the experience. And, the
Experiencer always "is" -- whether the Existence is noticed as an experience

or not.
