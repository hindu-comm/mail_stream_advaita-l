Dear Senani

I admire your knowledge and intellectual ability to manage words and
concepts but you can't convince me about this topic. I know that I am
self-realized no matter you or other people can say about anything. I have
never been convinced more about anything in my whole life. Do you think I am
trying to prove you that I am self-realized? I don't need to. I am not
interested in proving anything to anybody. I am just sharing what comes to
me with you all. I never expected you or other people agree with what I
think. I am just sharing. If that is not ok with you just tell me I will
stop to do so.

And finally, I think that a man who says that he remained indifferent by his
mother death or his daughter suffering is not eligible for enlightenment ,
he is simply lying.

Best regards
Marko
