Brahma Sri Marko
To the extent I was told, and to the extent that I could grasp within that and reproduce here, neither perception nor restlessness is Brahman; Brahman is the witness, when the subject, object and action are spoken of differently.
I find the concept of reference frames very useful. Is Newtonian physics correct? Yes, with Earth as the reference frame. With a fixed star as the reference frame, Newtonian physics is incorrect. Or to put it more elaborately, let us say two trains, T1 and T2,start from Point A to Point B and travel at different speeds. Let us say T1 travels 100 km more than T2 in an hour. Then for somebody who is on ground between points A and B, T2 is heading TOWARDS him. If this somebody then boards T1, he will suddenly discover that T2 is racing AWAY from him. What is the truth? It depends on the reference frame. If the frame is fixed to earth, T2 is racing towards the observer, who by definition is fixed to the reference frame; if the reference frame is fixed to the faster train T1, T2 is racing away from the observer.
Similarly, when perception is spoken of as separate and distinct from the perceiver and the perceived, implicitly the reference frame is fixed to this world, that ultimately is mithyaa. The short-cut for this is "the worldly view" or the loukika view; and since the worldly view is implicitly assumed, within the influence of maayaa, perception is not Brahman. Similarly restlessness.
In the Absolutist view, or the paaramaarthika view, with maayaa not operating, there is no perceiver, nor the perceived and of course no perception. Only Brahman is.
Is the train speeding away from me, or is it rushing towards me? It depends on whether I am subject to the influence of avidyaa or not.I am firmly under the influence of avidyaa,so, to me,the train is speeding away from me; perception and restlessness are not Brahman.You, (as you acknowledged), having realised Brahman are beyond the influence of avidyaa and therefore it is very clear to you thatthe train is coming towards you; that perception and restlessness are, but, Brahman.

Traditionally, the self-realised do not declare so, and very nicely play-act as if they are subject to maayaa, for the benefit of poor souls who are still subject to maayaa. Even the most reverred achaarya, bhagavatpaada, Sri Sankara, in hundreds of pages of tight philosophicalexposition let it slip only once that "even those like us who have realised Brahman do such and such".
While I fully understand the underlying refrain of all your posts - Fool!, realise that you are Brahman - the moment one finds it difficult to reconcile it - say, as Sri Jaladhar Vyas puts it, the inability to treat my bank balance as yours and transfer all my money to you - one ought to acknowledge that one's realisation is not sound, that one is still under the influence of avidyaa and thinks that there is something called mine, his, hers and so on. 
As long as I believe, declare, and act as ifmy wife ismy own, my children my own, my friends my own, mine this and mine that, and cannot give up joy on seeing them, touching them, cannot give up hurting when they do not reciprocate, do take up the duty of standing up for them, I remain ineligible for enlightenment. The day I don't care when my son is half naked on the streets and begging, any more than I do when I see other children of similar age doing so, I remain ineligible for enlightenment. The day I don't feel a moment of sadness when I see my mother dying, as do die so many ladies of her age every day, I am eligible for enlightenment. The day I am indifferent to my daughter being feted by her school, as are so many schoolgirls around the world, I am eligible for enlightenment. The day all my bonds break, I am eligible forenlightenment.
Till then, I am not eligible for enlightenment. Till then, I remain under the influence of avidyaa and maayaa. Perception and restlessness are, to such a person, not Brahman. The train is racing away.
Regards
Senani
