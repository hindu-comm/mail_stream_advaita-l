I know that I am self-realized no matter you or other people can say about
anything. I have never been convinced more about anything in my whole life. 

Marko,
Who is the "I" that is Self-realized?
Who is the "I" that is convinced?
Where is the "whole life" for the Self-realized? - As you know, Self is
beyond time.

Regards,
K. Ramakrishna.
