Dear Senani!

You wrote: "I indeed wanted to know how he reconciles his knowledge with his
myriad daily acts. He chose to sidestep that."

My knowledge and my myriad daily acts are the same thing I am, which is
Brahman. There is no need to reconcile anything at all.
Your skepticism is Brahman too.

Yours
Marko
