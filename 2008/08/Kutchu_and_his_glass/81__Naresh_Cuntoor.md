The series of emails reminds of a shloka from VC -

[Using baraha notation,]
akRutvA shatru-saMhAram agatvaa-akhila-bhU-shriyam |
raajaaham iti shabdaanno raajaa bhavitum arhati ||

Roughly translated,

Enemies, they are not vanquished;
Places, they are not conquered;
'King I am, king I am' claiming he
Does not become a king indeed.

Having said that, Marko, I don't mean to discourage you from posting. To add
to what others have said about making your posts understandable, please
explain your thoughts, however briefly.

Statements like 'I know I am self-realized ... not interested in proving
anything to anybody, etc.' do not lend themselves to meaningful discussion.
