- but, why!? Theorists and others must express ideas only if they relate to reality and the practical experience. Otherwise those ideas are not worth being expressed.

- I fully agree with you that concisousness is abstract and that it is difficult to grasp. Since it is difficult to define exactly, we try to describe something pointing to it, near to it,like it, an upalakshaNa. The answer is not withdrawal but an effort ofbetter quality.

- By experience, if you mean stuff dealing with sookshma Sareera, Jonathan Livingston Seagull kind of manovega, parakAyapraveSa, or as I recently picked up hypnagogic orhypnopompicstates, sleep paralysis, lucid dreams, awakening of kuNDalinee, acquisition of some siddhis and so on, I generally try to not bother myself too much with such "experiences" or their narrations, and I guess many in the list might; but that does not mean that others should not share such experiences or try to co-relate them with 'supportive literature'. I mean if anything, thestance which reads prejudice into such acts is definitelybiased; and the attempt of the experiencers to corelate has the benefit of doubt.
