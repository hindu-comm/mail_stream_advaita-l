Friends,

I am aware of the other thread on yoga and its
relation to advaita, but it's got too many posts, and
hence confusing.

In simple words, I'd like to know what meditation is,
according to advaita. Is it predominantly
nirguNOpAsana? If so, what is it exactly? I am
assuming NU is all about abiding in the state devoid
of names and forms, in short, rejecting all mental
vrtthis as illusory, so the self can abide in the self
with no preoccupation with the outside world. 

This also seems to be in tune with basic advaitic
principles, such as the illusoriness of the world, and
the (sole) Reality of the self.

Is this understanding correct?

Warmly,
Suresh
