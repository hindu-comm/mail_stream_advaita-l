This is with reference to brother Sri.Susheel  from Nepal on the above
question.I would like to quote Acharya Gaudapada in this context.
He says; "Vaisharadyam tu vai nasti bhede vicaratam sada"
          bheda nimnah prtagvadah tasmat te krpanah smrtah"
          "For one who moves in the "Bheda buddhi"which is at the root of
all misery,to them there is no knowledge(learning,purity)",the
sanskrit word,"Vaisharadya" has no equivalent in English,though
it may be rougly translated as wisdom or scholarship.
"Those who transit in differences are steeped in that,and always speak
separately,therefore they are said to be miserly".
                                                     N.Srikanta.
