This is with reference to the subsequent Emails on the above topic.It is
clear from the Bhashyas of shankara that the "krama mukti"of the above
worshippers is not at all the concern of Shankara.In order to accomodate
the vaidika(meemamsakas on the path of vedanta),shankara has made this
allowance.The Vedantins in their dialectics follow the 'Bhattas"(vyavahare
Bhatta-nayah.At the end of his Bhashyas he makes this very clear.
                                                          N.Srikanta.
