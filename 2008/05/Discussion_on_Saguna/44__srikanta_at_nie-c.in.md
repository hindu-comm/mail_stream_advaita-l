Your Email doesnot answer to the points I have raised.You have brought
other terms like Purushottama etc.which is not clear.The akshara Upasana
comes in the middle of the Upanishad.But,it continues further,not stopping
here.If you had studied the mantra"Dou suparnah sayuja sakhaya samana
vrkshe samparishvakva jate!
           tayoranyah pippalam svadatti anashnaanyo abhichakasheeti"!!
The continuing mantras make it clear that the Upasana you are talking
about is not the subject matter of the Upanishad.
                                                      N.Srikanta.
