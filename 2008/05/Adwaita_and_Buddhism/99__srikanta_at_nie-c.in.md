Dear Sri.ananth Bhagawath
You have written that Adwaitha and Buddhism has commonality interms of
sathyam(permanence).Adwaitha has maintained a common and unique tradition
through the lineage of its Acharyas.But,dialectical methods and strategy
has changed with the times,with variation in its main principle down to
what it is today.You have also said that there is commonality between
karikas of Gaudapada and Mulamadhyamaka karika of Nagarjuna.This is due to
the placement of the karikas which discuss the various schools of
Buddhism,only to be refuted at the end,and finally to state the Adwaithic
position.Since the karikas seem to be jumbled up and out of context due to
the nonpresentation of the purvapaksha view,it seems that there is
similarity between the two.I have brought this matter very clearly karika
by karika and the school of Buddhism which presents it.
                                                         N.Srikanta.
