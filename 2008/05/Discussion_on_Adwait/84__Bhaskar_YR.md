The Upanishads
and the Bhagawadgita are equivocal in declaring that the Upasana leads the
devotee to higher worlds,special powers and finally the form of Diety he
worships

praNAms
Hare Krishna

However, bhagavatpAda himself assures us that the aspirant of  krama-mukti,
who attained this state/lOka through upAsana, (recipients of
hiraNyagarbhalOka)  after mahApraLaya would get the final emancipation &
realize their true nature..BrahmasUtra 4th adhyAya discusses this issue in
detail...

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
