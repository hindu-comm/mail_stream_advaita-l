Dear Bhaskerji,
I am delighted to read your Email.It is Srikanta which is read with stress
on "T" in the name.It means "Shiva",who is the presiding diety in
Nanjangud near Mysore.
I am surprised as it comes from yourgoodself who is the true  disciple of
the Holenarsipur Swamiji,H.H.Sri.Sri.Sachidanandendra Saraswathiji,who
says in his introduction to his translation of Brahmasutra Bhashya of
Shankara that,by the word Vedanta,only Adwaita was recognised in earlier
times.
I fail to understand that if we accept that the Summumbonum(the parama
purushartha) of life is "BrahmaJnana"or knowledge of the Self,then how how
can their be allocation for other interpretations?The other schools were
born out of the rivalry against the Adwaitha.In his books the Swamiji
again and again stresses that the early opponents to Adwaitha took their
births in the form of these schools.With the result,that the spiritualism
we see today has taken the shape of religious rituals with no upliftment
in the spiritual elevation of mankind.
Regards,                                            N.Srikanta.
