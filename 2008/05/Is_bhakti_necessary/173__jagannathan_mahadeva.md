Hi,

Please some responses immediately after your sentences below. I have
had similar questions before and hence feel compelled to respond.

Bhakthi is needed for the recognition of abhEda, not the other way
around. For instance guru bhakthi is necessary before jnana is
achieved.

Although there is not much emphasis on bhakthi in the tradition of
advaita, it may not mean bhakthi is lacking. It goes back to the fact
that bhakti cannot be conveyed but only expressed as an emotion.
Although much of the traditional institution is mostly about teaching
the scriptures and their interpretation, I think from experience,
bhakthi through music and bhajanas is very much prevalent in advaitic
institutions. Others in this list that are closely associated with the
sringeri matha may offer more information. So singing bhajanas and
kirtanas are not exclusive to vashnavaite sects.

Again, vivEka, constant dwelling in the self etc are not possible
without bhakthi. Also bhajana, kirtana are all activities that reflect
bhakthi. there may be other forms of action that reflect bhakthi-for
instance service to guru or teacher can be considered to be act of
bhakthi or devotion.

bhakthi should and does precede jnana. The first thing that comes
between you and jnana is the guru and guru bhakthi here is
prerequisite.

I think it has to do with rasana (or taste to put it simply). I mean,
if you go to a music concert, all of the listeners may not like the
way the artiste performs. Or take the case of art, some artistes,
especially modern art is ridiculously simple but contains messages.
