This with reference to the above topic.Shankaracharya accepts that the
seeker in the beginning and  evolutionary stages performs Nishkamakarma
with Ishwararpana Buddhi,and for this he follows the various rituals
ascribed to that ashrama.Today's Shankaracharyas like H.H.Sri.Sri
Chandrasekhara Bharathi Mahaswami emphasized that one must perform
Sandhyavandanam at any cost.This is with a view to bring the seeker
towards cittashuddhi.
