FYI, bauddha tradition records that the SAkyamuni died after having
consumed pork. The animal was already dead, and the SAkyamuni accepted
the meat out of compassion for the person who offered it, even though
he knew fully well that the meat would harm him.

ahiMsA, compassion et al are not as simple as they sound !!
