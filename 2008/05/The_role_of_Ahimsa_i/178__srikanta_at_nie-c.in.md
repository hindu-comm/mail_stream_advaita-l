With reference to the above topic,Ahimsa or non-killing is a part and
parcel of one's dharma.The Veda declares,"Vedokhila Dharma
moolam".This"Dharma"is not only the right of  all human beings but also
all creatures."Ahimsa paramo dharmah",is the fundamental tenet of
Hinduism."paropakaraya punyaya papaya parapeedanam" says Vyasa.This is the
first step towards,"visuddhi".Due to the Varnashrama dharma and the
professions, the different varnas may have different food habits.But,the
cardinal principle of Vedas is not to kill.Whatever the present situations
is,it is difficult to believe that a compasionate Buddha will eat meat or
allow an animal to be killed for his sustenance.This body and life can
live without eating meat.In the Bhagawadgita,SriKrishna states the mental
condition of a man who eats Satwik,Rajasik and Tamasik foods.
