Dr Yadu Moharir rightly commented in his posting that " Above story also
confirms that just academic knowledge has little value.  Reciting rudra has
no value if one does not understand it or use it for their own benefit."

This is applicable in case of all recitals. Many Ritwiks in the Temples
chant Rudram, Chamakam, Mahanarayana, TaittarIya, Udaka shanthi, Maha Soura,
AruNa with many Suktas, but never knows the meanings also. Without proper
training or knowledge of Samskrit grammar, they even spell wrongly or split
the sentences  improperly. To recite and understand the meanings of these,
knowledge of basic Samskrit grammar is essential, though not the other
Vedangas like Shiksha, Chandas, Nirukta, Jyothi Shastra and Kalpa. They are
not interested in knowing meanings also. They chant these mantras with a
blind faith that some thing good will accrue to their wealth of PuNya or it
leads to Moksha.
Similar is the case with many Shlokas and Stotras. There is no use singing
them without Bhava. Bhava comes only if the words are understood.
Sri Shankaracharya reiterates at many places in Viveka Chudamani like " Na
snanena, Danena, PraNayama shatena cha"; "Yajantu Devan,Bhajantu DevataaH";
" "Vagvaikahri... sa tu Bhuktaye na tu Muktaye"  etc.
These are just my few feelings. The learned on this list can elucidate on
this.
