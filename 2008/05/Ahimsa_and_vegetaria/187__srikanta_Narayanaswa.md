This is with reference to the Emails on the above topic.It is said that the Sakymuni(Buddha)died after consuming poisoned pork in a devotee's house out of compassion.This doesnot prove that he endorsed meat eating.it only proves that it is dangerous to consume meat.a saint said that man is the only creature who eats the product(egg0 coming out of the posterior of another creature(hen),even when he eshews the food fallen out of his own mouth(uccista).there seems to be no end to man's gluttony as the saying goes,"sarvam bhakshayami,sagaram bhakshayami".
 N.Srikanta.
