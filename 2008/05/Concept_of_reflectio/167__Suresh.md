Friends,

If the concept of reflection (Brahman being reflected
as multiple jiva-s) is common to both schools, how is
it they arrive at different conclusions? What are the
details involved in this? 

Dvaita says that the Bimba (Brahman) and pratibimba
(Jiva) are always different, and the upAdhi happens to
be the very swarupa of the jiva. Advaita holds avidya
to be the upAdhi, and once it's destroyed, the jiva
becomes one with Brahman.

Dvaitins contend that pratibimba never becomes one
with the bimba, when the upAdhi is destroyed. Rather,
it's destroyed with the upAdhi, so it's tantamount to
saying the jiva itself becomes extinct. 

How is this particular point addressed in our
tradition? And also if some dvaitins are lurking, they
might also add some valuable comments.

Suresh
