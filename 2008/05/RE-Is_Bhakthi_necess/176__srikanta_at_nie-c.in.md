In his Brahma Sutra bhashya,Gita bhashya and Upanishad Bhashyas,Shankara
says it is only by the grace of God,"Ishwara prasadenaiva Adwaita
siddhih".In the explanation of the sruthi sentence"rutam pibhantah
sukrtasya loke" and "guham pravishtau..." Shankara explains elaborately
why the plural "pibhantau' as well as 'guham pravishtau.."occurs in the
sruthi.He means the lower self as the vijnanatma,which is the jiva
bhava.Again in the Mundaka sruthi,"Dva suparna sayuja sakhayah..."he means
the lower self as the Vijnanatma,the jiva consciousness."In the sruthi it
is clear."Nayamatma pravacanena labhayah,na bahuna sruthena,Yamaivaesha
vrunete tena eva labhayah..."makes it clear that the intensiveness to
yearn for the Atma jnana brings the seeker closer to Self-knowledge.
