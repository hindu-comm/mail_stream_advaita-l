Dear List Members,

I found Thibaut's translation of the Arthasamgraha on the Digital Library of 
India; I've converted it to a PDF and posted it here:

http://rapidshare.com/files/118979532/Arthasamgraha.pdf.html

This is a 9+ Meg pdf of the raw page images and may take a while to 
download, please be patient. Please do not hesitate to contact me if these 
URLs  don't work; I will mail the book to you.

I think the moderators( Jaldhar) will post this to the main website when 
they get a moment; but the link should be active for a couple of months.

Regards,
Murali Manohar
