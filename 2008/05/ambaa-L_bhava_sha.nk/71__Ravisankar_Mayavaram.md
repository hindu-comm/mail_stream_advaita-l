Hi Sridhar,

Thanks for posting on the occasion of our aachaarya's jayantii. I prepared a
small presentation for the same yesterday (for my friend).  It is at
http://ambaa.org/pdf/shankara_9may2008.pdf - it may have errors. It is based
on the ashhTottaram meaning I posted in the past to advaita-l.

Corrections are welcome.

bhava sha~Nkara deshika me sharaNam
