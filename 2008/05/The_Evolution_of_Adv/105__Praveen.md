praNAm all,

Hari Om, Bhaskar-ji,

I somehow missed replying to your mail earlier. Thanks for the
clarifications you
provide.

Of course, I think so too. :) To clarify, what I meant to say is that
Advaita Vedanta
itself has not changed to interpret karma kAnDA differently. Anyway, agreed.

Although that in itself is quite sufficient for me, those
interpretations too, that
I see as elaborations instead, help understand bhagavatpAda well.

I vaguely recall this and so I will revisit the same. Thanks for this
reference.
However, that too may not necessarily mean that post-Shankara (names
you mentioned) approach of interpretation/ elaboration is not *right*, in
comparison to pre-Shankara approach to non-duality. Nonetheless, point
well-taken.
