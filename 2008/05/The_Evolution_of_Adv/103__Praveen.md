Bhaskar-ji, may I seek a clarification on the above questions? To my
understanding:

(a) indicates both evolution in Vedanta as well as in interpretation
of Vedanta, inclusive of dvaita and vishishTa advaita, it does not
necessarily mean advaita alone.

(b) indicates interpretation of Vedic scriptures including karma kAnDa.

AFAIK, considering only advaita vedanta, I don't think it has changed
or even its interpretation, but only the elaboration.
