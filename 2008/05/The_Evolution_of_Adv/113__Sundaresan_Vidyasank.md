I think rigid is an unhappy choice of words here, Bhaskar. A more
appropriate
word would be rigorous, rather than rigid. If one reads Swami
Vivekananda
carefully, I think one will find that he is not rigorous about advaita
vedAnta, but
he is also not rigid in his opinions. He writes emphatically, but he is
not a
rigid and dogmatic author.

I can understand both Jaldhar's reservations about Swami Vivekananda's
writings
and the views of those who think otherwise. However, one should remember
that
Swami Vivekananda never portrayed himself as a faithful interpreter of
Sankara or
classical advaita. His goals were more general with respect to Hinduism.

Regards,
Vidyasankar
