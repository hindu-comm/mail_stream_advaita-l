A clarification: I mentioned that about karma kANDa rituals, not
jnAna! In fact, saMkalpa is a desire
that is necessary to produce phala from a ritual, but it means a
hurdle for jnAna.

contemporaries who
obtained jnana without going to the forest.  In the case of Sri Ramana
Maharishi the jnana was so
instantaneous he never had time to even do sankalpa.

A small comment about Bhagavan Ramana Maharshi: its well-known that he
left everything and
went to the forests. (Arunachala) Whether he did that before he became
a jnAni or later, it still holds
a lot of weight.
