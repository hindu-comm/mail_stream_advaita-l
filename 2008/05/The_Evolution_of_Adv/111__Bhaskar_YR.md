<As you mention it not "shastric and rigid in the representation of
non-dual philosophy."  That's important don't you think!>

Well, that is not important!

praNAms Sri Anantha Bhagavat prabhuji
Hare Krishna

Well, if you ask me that is very important...Hence shankara very often
repeatedly gives special emphasis on sAmpradAyik systamAtic teaching...But
you are welcome to have your own opinion on the regidity of traditional
teaching:-))

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
