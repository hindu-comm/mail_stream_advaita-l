To add to what Jaldhar-ji wrote...
I do not know to what "era" do the scholars date Sannyasa Upanishad, but
that itself categories samnyAsi-s into six types out of which one is avadhUta.

IMHO, its more likely to give quite the opposite effect. Chitta shuddhi is the
basic qualification, as defined traditionally, to take one to mumukshutva and
thence to Vedanta. Any short cut poses a danger of wrong understanding
of "anything goes" as justified for a jnAni, which could result in arrogance
and falsely conceiving freedom to do things opposite to shuddha chitta. And that
is rather a pitfall in the traditional approach.
