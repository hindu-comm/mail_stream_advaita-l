Yes, by the criteria of student-ship (teacher-ship criteria mentioned there too) of upadeSa sahasri I am not sure if I am qualified as a Sishya or you are qualified as a guru (or even as a Sishya). Till such times the questions can be asked, opinions can be expressed, and people are free to advise each other or to respond to each other.

Read Vivekananda carefully and your opinion will change.

Sorry but by your own admission you are not currently qualified to judge 
whether it is important or not.  Continue studying Advaita Vedanta and I 
guarantee you your views will change.
