The following was posted on the advaitin list on the occasion of
Sankara jayanti:

> NamAmyayogi parivArasampadam
> NirastbhUtim anumArdavigraham |
> AnugramunmuRditakAlalAncanam
> VinAvinAyakam apUrva SAnkaram || Pancapadika ||

Can someone provide an accurate ITRANS transliteration (the above
clearly has errors) with sandhi breakup?

I was blessed to attend the above talk, and a few others by various
scholars. Chennai is indeed blessed to have such mahaan-s !!
