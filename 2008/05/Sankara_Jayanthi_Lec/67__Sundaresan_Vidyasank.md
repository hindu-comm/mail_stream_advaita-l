This is a salutation verse found at the beginning of padmapAda's
pancapAdikA.
The ITRANS version of it would be
namAmyabhogiparivArasaMpadaM nirastabhUtimanumArdhavigraham.h |
anugramunmR^iditakAlalA~ncanaM vinAvinAyakamapUrvashaN^karam.h ||
With sandhi break-up, we have
namAmi abhogi-parivAra-saMpadaM nirasta-bhUtim anumArdha-vigraham.h |
anugram unmR^idita-kAlalA~ncanaM vinA-vinAyakam apUrva-shaN^karam.h ||
(samAsa splits are indicated with -'s).

Regards,
Vidyasankar
