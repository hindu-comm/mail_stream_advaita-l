 Students of Vedanta would recall that last year we had uploaded Sankara
Jayanthi Lectures at Sanskrit College on Mahavakyas by great Vidwans.The
current year lectures have been uploaded in the following reference:
Sri Mani Dravid Sastrigal gave his talk on Brahmasutrasara based on
introduction written to book on Brahmasutravritti called "Mittakshara by
Annambhatta" by Sri Polagam Rama Sastri.
The other lectures are by Dr R Krishnamurthi Sastrigal,Dr Godaji and Dr K
Ramasubramaniam.
