Thank you for accepting my subscription request. I am glad to discover this list.
As my first question , I was wondering is there a compilation/recommendations of resources for beginners. This can include but not limited to books , some archived threads, articiles, links, audio/video resources. Any type of information would be highly appreciated.
PS: In one of the threads I found a reference to book "Wanderings in the Himalayas (Himagiri vihar) by Tapovanam Maharaj". I should be receiving that book soon.
