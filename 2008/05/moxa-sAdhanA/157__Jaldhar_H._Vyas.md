Bhagavan answers this in 18.66

"Abandoning [the fruits of] all dharmas [including adharmas] seek me as 
the only refuge."

When karma is done purely out of a sense of duty as a sacrifice to God it 
is nishkama.

Some people in the recent conversations have suggested the dictates of the 
shastras be ignored if the person "feels inclined" to do something else. 
This is the very _opposite_ of what should be done.  When you introduce 
"want" into the picture you just end up with a high-minded hedonism not 
nishkama karma.
