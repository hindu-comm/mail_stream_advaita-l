I  read some Emails which state that Adwaitha has changed over the years
and Madhusudhana Saraswathi had to come inorder to set right the confusion
or Emails to that effect.This I strongly deny.Madhusudhana Saraswathi came
at a time when the Vishitadwaita school and the Dwaita school under Madhva
were launching their criticism on the Adwaitha after shankara and the
susequent teachers like Sarvajnatman,Prakashatman,Citsukhi and others
adopted a dialectical approach to explain Shankara's Adwaitha as enshrined
in his Bhashyas.The Bhakti school was revived by Vishistadwaitha school
and the Dwaita school.In order to counteract this, Madhusudhana Saraswathi
included Bhakthi as a component in his Siddhanta.But,this also resulted in
a greater confusion,till VijnanaBhikshu the commentator on Sankya Karika
of IshwaraKrishna who attempted to give a satisfactory answer.The later
day confusions in understanding the correct position of Shankara Vedanta
is due to the counter approaches of the later Adwaithins listed above.
