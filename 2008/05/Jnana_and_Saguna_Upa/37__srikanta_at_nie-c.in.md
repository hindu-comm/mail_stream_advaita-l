This is with reference to the Email by Sri Srinivas Gadkari,that Rmadasa
Swami(Samartha Ramadas,who was the Guru of Shivaji),though a Jnani
considered to a rebirth of Yajnavalkya,devoted his life to Saguna
Upasana.The Mahrashtra had many such saints,like Sant Jnaneshwar,Samartha
Ramadas,Eknath, NamdevTukaram who was more soaked in  Bhakthi.This
Jnana-Bhakthi cult is to be seen as a period in the spiritual history of
these places,like the Chaitanya cult in Bengal. They are more of reformers
than Jnanis like Shankara and others.In Bhagawad Gita Krishna says,'Sarva
karmakhilam Partha Jnane parisamapyate",that includes,Karma,Bhakthi etc.
