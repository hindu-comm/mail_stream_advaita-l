Sri Ramesh

Yes, after your mail I went through the listed messages. The issue (mAdhyamaka), it seems, had generated lot of heat at that time. In fact most of the issues which we (the new comers like me) are discussing now had been discussed as early as Y2000 with enthusiasm, passion, and combativeness.

Subject: Re: [Advaita-l] Discussion on Pratitya-samutpada and Advaita

2008/4/29 Ananta Bhagwat <ananta14 at yahoo.com>:
<<These similarities between advaita and <mAdhyamaka + yogAcAra> have
been discussed in many Indian philosophy textbooks and papers (and
possibly also on this advaita-vedAnta blog).>>

Indeed, this issue has been discussed on this list before. The
"stronger" opinion seems to have been that it is _not_ quite
appropriate to equate the shUnya of mAdhyamaka with the brahman of
advaita (ref alAtashAnti prakaraNa of mANDUkya, where gauDapAda
explains that the firebrand itself is the AdhAra for the appearance of
the circle of fire).

My own understanding is that the shUnya of mAdhyamaka is closer to
what we call mithyA rather than brahman, but others might differ.
