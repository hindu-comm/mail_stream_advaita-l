I am a lecturer at the Jadavpur University in Kolkata.

Always interested in Indian religions & philosophies,
I am very eager to deepen my knowledge of the advaita school.

I am sure I can rely on the learned members of this list
to help my understanding to go "a bit further"...

Thank you for your hospitality:

Angelo
