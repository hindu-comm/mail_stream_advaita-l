Dear Friends,

Sorry for the long gap in posting. 

Here's another verse, which is quite popular and often
quoted.
--------------------------------------------------
2.59
viSayA vinivartante

nirAhArasya dehinaH

rasa-varjam raso 'py asya

param dRSTvA nivartate
--------------------------------------------------

I'll be honest. The words make sense individually, but
as a verse, it's quite difficult to understand. Any
insights will be appreciated. If the words from 'raso'
to 'nivartate' mean 'Seeing the Supreme, even his
taste ceases,' how is the rest interpreted?

Warmly,
Suresh
