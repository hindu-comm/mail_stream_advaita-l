Namaste,
It is well known that rAmadAsa Swami was the spiritual guide
tothe Maratha empire founded by Shivaji, in its first several
decades.
It is known among the disciples of rAmadAsa Swami that he
was sage yAjnavalkyaof bRhadAraNyaka Upanishad fame in
his previousbirth.
Assuming this to be true: A great jnAni like yAjnavalkya in
his next birth chose to devote his life to saguNA upasanA of
shrI rAma (and also hanumAna).Not to deny the strong current
ofjnAna in his teachings. But equal emphasis on karma and
most importantly saguNa upAsanA (bhakti) is thought provoking.
Regards,
Shrinivas
