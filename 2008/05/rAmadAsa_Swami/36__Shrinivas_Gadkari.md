Namaste,
Let us keep this rAmadAsa swami - yAjnavalkya association at the level of
a legend in the oral tradition. Each person is free to decide if they want to
take it or leave it.
Regards,
Shrinivad

Namaskar:
 
 It is unfortunate that we, the Indians like to make things more mystique that they need to be, This give opportunity for Western scholars to have a field day with the issues and poke holes. We love make thing more ancient than they may be and every one tries to incarnate their guru to a well known deity or a sage.
 
 Just by making the bold statements does not elevate the teacher or his disciple, except for satisfying the false ego.
 
 If you had said that that Samarth Ramdas Swami needs be regarded as being analogous to Sage yaaj~navalka may be more suitable. Because Ramadas Swami emphasized the practical aspects and the associated utility to make life more meaningful.
