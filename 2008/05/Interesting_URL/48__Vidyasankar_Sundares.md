Dear Gerald,

I certainly did not think I'd hit a raw nerve with my short note about this article by Alan Jacobs. Here are my comments and clarifications about why I posted that link.

I think you will find that what you are referring to is not usually called "Neo-Vedanta" or more generally "Neo-Hinduism" - a term coined by academia in the West to describe the thought of primarily Swami Vivekananda and secondarily, a few others who came after him (e.g. Swami Sivananda, Swami Chinmayananda, Swami Dayananda). Whatever academic scholars may think of the Neo-Vedantins, it cannot be denied that they maintain strong links to the classical Advaita tradition and have developed enviable traditions of Sannyasa, learning and scholarship, along with their commitment to non-traditional goals like social service.

On the other hand, the term "Neo-Advaita" is relatively new, especially in the sense that Mr. Jacobs intends. He is using it to refer to a phenomenon that has been emerging only during the for the last few decades. The article does make it clear that he is referring to an entirely different group of people from those that academia has come to call neo-Vedantins. To make things a bit more explicit, these are teachers who offer instant nirvANa, so to speak, to highly successful professionals, in language that ultimately makes a parody of Atma-vicAra. These are not the monks of the Ramakrishna Math or the Chinmaya Mission or the Arsha Vidya Gurukulam,

Oh, there is no racial/nationalistic prejudice at all. There are many serious Westerners who are drawn to vedAnta whom I can respect. Also, do rest assured that when I made a comment about people who claim some relationship with Ramana Maharishi or Nisargadatta Maharaj, I had quite a few Indian teachers in mind as well. However, the main theater of operations for even those Indians who set themselves up as such teachers remains Europe/America and they gain fame and prestige in India only after making their name abroad. The reasons for that phenomenon are a complex topic of debate in themselves, which I'll avoid here.

Absolutely.

I respectfully disagree that the level of discussion has sunk to any low. I merely posted a link to Jacobs' article and only because I thought he had a legitimate criticism to make, which I thought at least some list members would find useful.

Regards,
Vidyasankar
