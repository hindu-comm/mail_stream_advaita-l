I second Ramesh's request on what you mean by neo-advaita "which are
useful works".  I went back to Andrew Fort's book on Jivanmukti and he
does mention the term neo-advaita, but says that he prefers
neo-vedanta. So I agree with you that we need to get terminology
straight here.

Personally, the terms neo-vedanta, neo-advaita, etc., used by Western
acedemics have no meaning to practioners such as myself. Either
someone is an advaitin or not. It was Paul Hacker, a Westerner, who
first heaped his scorn on Vivekananda for being "neo". Read his book
and you'll see scorn dripping out the pages. No one in India called
Vivekananda neo. It seems that Indians can never do it right. If they
"innovate" based on current situations, but hold to core tenets (as
seen in advaitic tradition) they are not true to tradition and are
"neo". But on the other hand Indians also lack originiality, since
they are keen on this tradition thing (an Italian indologist actually
made this statement and claimed that Indians have not produced any
genius like Michalengelo as proof in an open forum!).

My problem is that there is a group of people who advertise their
"traditional lineage", but go against core teachings of advaita such
as the 4-fold qualifications. Further it is all based on wishy-washy
"I came up with this when staring at some picture", etc. They also
never cease to advertise that their teaching is the same as Sankara.
This is wrong!

More comments later when I get more time. However you seem to be
talking about the "list" as if it were a monolithic entity. I doubt if
anyone sees writing in English as a problem. Why, Sri
Satchidanandendra Saraswati was a prolific writer in English and is
well respected in the advaita tradition. Mahasannidhanam of Sringeri
himself asked his disciple to write a book specifically in English
(Sri Subbaramayya) to make it accessible to the modern readers (a
superb work IMO).

Per mImA.nsA shAstra authorities are required only for what is not
accessible to perception and reasoning. When a society does not have a
concept of varNa system, why would this question arise? As per the
smR^iti texts varNa is determined by birth, as you well know.
