Just to give a balanced perspective, I feel westerners
are 'more' qualified to understand our traditions.
This is because they're alien to our culture, and
hence they can be a bit more objective. Whereas most
Indians make it a habit to ridicule our traditions
without even bothering to read a single book. 

One can point to hundreds of instances in politics,
movies, literature, where Indians have expressed their
ignorance of vedanta. 

Nor does one understand why the author tries to relate
neo-vedanta (which was started by Indians like
Vivekananda) to the alleged shortcomings of western
culture. There seems to be no correlation at all.
