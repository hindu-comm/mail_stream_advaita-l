AFAIK, there are quite a few veda pAthashAlas being established by various
institutions, both traditional and
not-so-traditional, in order to revive the almost lost tradition.

praNAms
Hare Krishna

May I also add here that today's politicians, who seek divine intervention
to boost up their political future, with/without their knowledge helping
this noble cause i.e. retriving the vEdic tradition especially karma kAnda
:-))  They are hosting atirudra mahAyAga, shatachandi hOma, sOma yAga etc.
& contributing /sponsoring generously towards this cause. There may be
selfish motive behind all these generocity...nevertheless, it is good that
it is happening in one way or other.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
