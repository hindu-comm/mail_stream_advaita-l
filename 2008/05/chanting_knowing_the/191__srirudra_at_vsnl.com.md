Dears
I donot agree that that oneshould recite/chant mantras and slokas only after understanding their meaning or knowing syntax etc.What is required is concentration and devotion.Knowing the meaning does help in appreciating the context of the slokas and how beautiful are the thoughts /imagery of the composer etc.Thisway your thoughts are focussed and you feel that you have spent some time without straying out of the subject.Many of the beejaksharas have no meaning and the very chanting of them definitely helps in fixing the thoughts on Brahman or the Self.Ofcourse mechanical unrhythmic chantings just for commercial purposes has to be discouraged.R.Krishnamoorthy.

Dr Yadu Moharir rightly commented in his posting that " Above story alsoconfirms that just academic knowledge has little value.  Reciting rudra hasno value if one does not understand it or use it for their own benefit."This is applicable in case of all recitals. Many Ritwiks in the Templeschant Rudram, Chamakam, Mahanarayana, TaittarIya, Udaka shanthi, Maha Soura,AruNa with many Suktas, but never knows the meanings also. Without propertraining or knowledge of Samskrit grammar, they even spell wrongly or splitthe sentences  improperly. To recite and understand the meanings of these,knowledge of basic Samskrit grammar is essential, though not the otherVedangas like Shiksha, Chandas, Nirukta, Jyothi Shastra and Kalpa. They arenot interested in knowing meanings also. They chant these mantras with ablind faith that some thing good will accrue to their wealth of PuNya or itleads to Moksha.Similar is the case with many Shlokas and Stotras. There is no use singingthem without Bhava. Bhava comes only if the words are understood.Sri Shankaracharya reiterates at many places in Viveka Chudamani like " Nasnanena, Danena, PraNayama shatena cha"; "Yajantu Devan,Bhajantu DevataaH";" "Vagvaikahri... sa tu Bhuktaye na tu Muktaye"  etc.These are just my few feelings. The learned on this list can elucidate onthis.Subrahmanya UH_______________________________________________Archives: http://lists.advaita-vedanta.org/archives/advaita-l/To unsubscribe or change your options:http://lists.advaita-vedanta.org/cgi-bin/listinfo/advaita-lFor assistance, contact:listmaster at advaita-vedanta.org
