"I have posted a series on Adwaita Vedanta and its relationship to
yoga,the whole topic of sruti-anusara-ananusara acceptance/rejection...."

>From the commentaries of Shankara no where it is said other systems are
necessary to obtain jnana.again and Again he says that what is necessary
is removal of ajnana or avidya.without right perception any amount of
Yoga,dhyana will remove avidya.this is the hallmark of Shankara's stand.

"Shankara fully takes into account the contribution that Yoga and other
darshanas make towards qualifying us for that jnana".

shankara no where has made this observation that other darshana contribute
for samyagjnana.Otherwise where is the necessity for vedanta?.Moreover,if
other darshana contribute for jnana,then where was the necessity for
puvapaksha and siddhanta?He only points out that in these darshanas if
they contain certain points which donot violate Vedas,they may be
accepted,not with reference to their systems or practices.

"After all,if the immediate perception for jnana of Brahman is that easy
to attain we would all be sadyomuktas right now living out perfect
exemplary lives"

Yes,the jnana is hard to attain,but shankara says that it si everyone's
reach.It is for us to see whether we are sadyomuktas or whether we are
leading perfect exemplary lives(sadyomukti is not different from perfect
exemplary life) or not,but with all these systems cluttered up in our mind
and these futile practices,the sadyomukti will sure be elusive.
