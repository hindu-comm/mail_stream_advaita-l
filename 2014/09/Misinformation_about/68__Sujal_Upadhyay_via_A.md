Namaste Ramesh ji,

**We need not be unduly perturbed about this, as there will continue to be
mischievous posters, who are determined to make their views expressed and
considered by others.**

This is standard stand of most of advaitins because of the very nature of
sAdhanA. However if someone takes initiative, let him/her do so. These guys
look very knowledgeable to any laymen as they quote from many sources.
Today, not many even read bhagavad gItA, then what to tell about
commentaries. Not many would be aware of the names of pUrvAcArya-s like
jnAnottama, etc.

I personally prefer that instead of spending time in raising objections and
giving refutations, we should defend Hinduism from people like Zakir Naik
;) However these guys force people to reply as they are giving convoluted
interpretations of advaita. They are interpreting Adi Sankara from
Vaishnava POV :) So they think that sattva guNa is free from ignorance :)
What more to say

OM

Sujal
