Namaste Dear Sujal,

I personally prefer that instead of spending time in raising objections and
giving refutations, we should defend Hinduism from people like Zakir Naik
;)

Good post sujal.  

In dEvi-mAhAtmyam, there is an episode of "mahishAsura-vadha".  This asura
changes his forms and assumes sometimes as buffalo, elephant, swords-man, lion etc.

The sanAtana-dharma dvEshIs assume different forms like mahishAsura. 

The need of the hour is invoke the power of shakti in the form of "simha-vAhini.
