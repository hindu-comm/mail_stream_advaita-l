Dear friends,

One, who  has read the Bhagavad Gita prperly  (I mean one, who has understood the Bhagavad gita properly), does not have that misconception. In the Bhagavad Gita the Lord was speaking from the level of the highest Brahman and the Lord says there that he  is Shiva, He is Vishnu, he is Brahmaa, he is Kaala and he is everything. In fact that is the reason why, when he went on to describe the Parama-pada in the Bhagavad Gita, he did not repeat the Vedic dictum "Tadvishnu paramam padam". In the Bhagavad gita of 700 verses the Lord is shown to have skipped the description of the Prarama pada, though he said he would describe that. However, in the Original Bhagavad Gita of 745 verses (conforming to the Gitamana verse), the Lord goes on to give the Vedantic description of the Paramapada.


There is a belief that Adi Shankaracharya wanted to write a commentary on the Vishnusahasranama and he wanted someone to fetch a copy of that. The entrusted person got him the Bhagavad Gita (and obviously that was the version of the Bhagavad Gita of 700 verses). Adi Shankaracharya took it as the will of the Lord and wrote a bhshya on that. 

The BhagavadGgita, which Vaishampayana told to Janmejaya during the Sarpa-yajna, that too in the presence of the original composer of the Mahabharata, Vedavyasa himself, had 745 verses. Later on Sauti was requested by the sages in the Naimisharanya and he narrated the Mahabharata to them. At that time he narrated the Bhagavad Gta (as part of the Mahabharata) and that obviously had 700 verses. Probably the conflicting definitions of  Paramapada in the Veda and the Vedanta were too much for Sauti to explain.

Regards,
Sunil KB

In continuation of my first post in this thread, I have written a lengthy
response, which I am not posting here as that will entail making it into
several parts.  Hence I have posted it in the following URL from where one
can read it if interested:
