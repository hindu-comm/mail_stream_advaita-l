There are three positions for wearing yagnopavita

upavita - hanging from left shoulder is the most common hence yagna + upavita = 
yajnopavita.

prachinavita - hanging from right shoulder.  We adopt this position during 
pitrakaryas.

nivita - hanging around the neck.

Doesn't this apply to manushya tarpana in pancha mahayajnas only?  I do 
this during nitya tarpana but Swamiji seems to be saying it should be done 
during all laukika karmas too.  That does not seem to be the accepted 
practice.
