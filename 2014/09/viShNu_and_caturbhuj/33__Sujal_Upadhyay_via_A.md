|| Hari OM ||

Pranams,

Please read article viShNu and caturbhuja viShNu
<http://www.advaita-vedanta.in/vishnu>

We can understand from the commentaries by Sri Adi SankarAcArya ji that he
use to refer to kruShNa, nArAyaNa, viShNu, hari as brahman. Did our AcArya
really meant caturbhuja viShNu or is it something different.

OM

Sujal
