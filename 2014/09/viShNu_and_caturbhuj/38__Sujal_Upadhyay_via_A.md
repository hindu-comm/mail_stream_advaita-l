>> The Rgvedic mantra: *सोमः पवते* जनिता मतीनां जनिता दिवो जनिता पृथिव्या:।

>>
>> In the subsequent mantra we have:
>>
>> *ब्रह्मा देवानां*पदवीः कवीनामृषिर्विप्राणां महिषो मृगाणाम् . श्येनो
>> गृध्राणाँस्वधितिर्वनानाँसोमः पवित्रमत्येति रेभन्  9.6
>>
>> In this mantra which continues from the fifth mantra, Sāyaṇācārya says:
>> Soma, of the earlier mantra, is assuming the post of brahmā in a sacrifice.
>> Alternatively, the commentator says: soma is the head, ‘king’, of all the
>> deva-s such as indra, stated in the previous mantra.
>>
>> Thus, from a study of these two mantras/commentaries we conclude that
>> according to Sāyaṇācārya, viṣṇu is a created deity.
>>
>> In the Taittiriyopaniṣad shanti mantra bhāṣya, Shankaracharya has said
>> that viṣṇu is the abhimānidevatā, presiding deity, for the limb, leg.  Also,

>>
>> At the beginning of the bhashyam for the Prashnopanishat 2nd chapter,
>> Shankara says;
>>
>> प्राणोऽत्ता प्रजापतिरित्युक्तम् । तस्य प्रजापतित्वमत्तृत्वं
>> चास्मिञ्शरीरेऽवधारयितव्यमित्ययं प्रश्न आरभ्यते ।
>>
>> Prāṇa the consumer is stated to be the Prajāpati.  This, its being the
>> prajāpati and the consumer, is being demonstrated in this body.
>>
>> In the 9th mantra of this Chapter we have:
>>
>>
>> इन्द्रस्त्वं प्राण तेजसा रुद्रोऽसि परिरक्षिता ।
>> त्वमन्तरिक्षे चरसि सूर्यस्त्वं ज्योतिषां पतिः ॥ ९ ॥
>>
>> 9     Indra thou art, O Prana, and Rudra, too, in prowess. Thou art the
>> Protector. Thou movest in the sky; thou art the sun, the lord of lights.
>>
>> The bhāṣya says:
>> किंच, इन्द्रः परमेश्वरः त्वं हे प्राण, तेजसा वीर्येण रुद्रोऽसि
>> संहरन्जगत् । स्थितौ च परि समन्तात् रक्षिता पालयिता; परिरक्षिता त्वमेव
>> जगतःसौम्येन रूपेण । त्वम् अन्तरिक्षे अजस्रं चरसि उदयास्तमयाभ्यां
>> सूर्यःत्वमेव च सर्वेषां ज्योतिषां पतिः ॥

>> Further, O Prana, you are Indra, the Supreme Lord.  By valour you are

>> by rising and setting.  You are the sun, the lord of all the luminaries.
>>
>> For the above highlighted portion, Anandagiri, the authoritative

>> of Vishnu, etc.)
>>
>> Now, this upanishad itself stated that Prana is Prajapati., the Creator.
>> And in this mantra we have Rdura, another form of prāṇa, being stated as
>> the world-destroyer.  And Vishnu (the benign form, as opposed to the
