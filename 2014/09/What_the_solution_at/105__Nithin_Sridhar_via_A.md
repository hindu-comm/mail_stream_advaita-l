Consulting a good genuine astrologer may help in that he would be able to
prescribe a proper Sadhana/Puja to be done. Other than that, you may
practice Sadhana of your Ishta Devata for specific number of days by taking
a samkalpa that your career related problems be solved. A Sadhana of
Ganesha (ex- parayana of Sankashta-Naashana Ganesha Stotram) would be good
as well.

Regards,
Nithin
