Chanting Sri Vishnu Sahasranama can take care of a wide range of problems.
Just take a look at its phala shruti. For those who do sandhyavandana,
paramaacharya says doing deva-R^iShi-pitR tarpaNa regularly will help. Sri
Vishnu Sahasranama method is easy and open to all.


Methods mentioned in yoga darshana (such as maitri karuNa mudita ...) and
trying to follow yama and niyamas will help one attain chitta shuddhi.
That can help to increase once receptivity of Ishvaraanugraha. The word
grace is a christian term - what is that in our tradition karuNa
(compassion) or anugraha?
