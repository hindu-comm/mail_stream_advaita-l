Namaste,

During the times of distress, it is the mental stamina (manO-dhairyam) which is most important.  One should have the courage to stand to the tests of time.  In order to say “this will also pass”, one needs manO-dhairyam.  These hardships and difficulties in life can be overcome with constant remembrance of shri. AnjanEya (shri hanuman ji).   The hanumad-smaraNa instills courage, mental strength, self-confidence in us.  Regular reading of “sundara-kANDa” instills these qualities in us which requires no initiation. 

On of the vyutpatti for "sundara" is "naSTa dravyasya lAbhOhi sundara parikIrtitaH" which means "re-gaining of lost wealth".  This “lost wealth” can be understood either way i.e., from laukika as well as Vedanta perspective.   In sundara-kANDa, there are certain hidden mantras, when chanted knowingly or unknowingly, bestows the hanumad-anugraha especially, the “jaya-panchakam”.

Regs,
Sriram
