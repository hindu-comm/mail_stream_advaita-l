Hi All,

Loving Sairam to you,Hope you are doing well.

What kind of spiritual practices/rituals one should follow when He/She is
facing a Bad times in particular career problems . At times what ever one
does that will become no use in bad times.

   1. Is every thing pre determined in life?
   2. Does Vastu has any effect ?
   3. How to get God's Grace ?

are there any solutions mentioned in Vedanta for the above questions ?
kindly let us know please.

With Best Regards
