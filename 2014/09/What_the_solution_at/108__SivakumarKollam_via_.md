SAdara praNAm,
There was a great devotee of Mother Divine in Kerala
by name KAkkasseri Bhattathiri who is associated with
the famous Chottanikkara temple.
That great scholar was once asked  what to do in difficulties?
"Aapadi kim karaneeyam?"
His answer was "Karaneeyam charana yugalam Ambaayaam"
(Depend on the lotus feet of the Mother)
Namaste.
