I think Sri Ramana Maharishi through his glorious teachings and clarifications to many of his devotees has best answered all your questions. Sri Ramana insists and repeatedly assures that the vigilant and ceaseless practice of self-enquiry as taught by him, combined with perfect surrender (if that is possible, otherwise, even a half-hearted surrender initially is fine) to the will of God is the best solution for all problems at all times.  He has also told a devotee who prayed to him for complete happiness all through every stage of his life that granting such a blessing was impossible as the world is a figment of one's imagination and has no substantial reality apart from one's own reality. Hence, He would rather prefer that his devotees and followers woke up from the dream called the world and abided in their true natural state as the Pure Consciousness, or Parabrahman (Sat-Chit-Ananda/Existence-Consciousness-Bliss) , which alone is the unending and
 eternally over-flowing-to-the-brim reservoir of all bliss. You may try Vastu and everything else just for temporary satisfaction, but I think that following the teachings of Sri Ramana with implicit faith and sincerely is the best possible solution.

To your question whether everything is pre-determined, or pre-ordained, Sri Ramana says: "Unmistakably yes, but  if you can surrender the fruits of your actions and act selflessly without any ulterior motives and without being attached to the results, you will not be much affected by the results or consequences. I think he has said this in response to a devotee, who asked him is it pre-ordained that I will drop this book (i think book or something else) here at this point of time, Sri Ramana Maharishi gave him this answer.

Please note that just because everything is pre-determined or pre-ordained, it does not entitle us to be callous/reckless and apathetic in the discharge of our duties to the best of our ability at any given point of time, in the capacity, of boss/employee/son/brother/sister/daughter/husband/wife/teacher/student/guide/assistant/parent etc. We should dedicate the fruits and results of all our actions to God or Guru and try to deliver the best performance to the best of our abilities, which we should try to keep on expanding and improving at all times. 

Hope I have been able to share my understanding of Sri Ramana GuruDeva's teachings to some extent.

If you are interested in further reading of Sri Ramana Literature, I can suggest that you read his book 1) Who am I?

SAdara praNAm,
There was a great devotee of Mother Divine in Kerala
by name KAkkasseri Bhattathiri who is associated with
the famous Chottanikkara temple.
That great scholar was once asked  what to do in difficulties?
"Aapadi kim karaneeyam?"
His answer was "Karaneeyam charana yugalam Ambaayaam"
(Depend on the lotus feet of the Mother)
Namaste.
