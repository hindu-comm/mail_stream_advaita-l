A musical rendition, in full 'Cutchery' style of several compositions of
ShankarabhagavatpƒÅda is organized in the coming week at Bangalore.

Over a dozen highly renowned vocalists and many accompanists on instruments
in  the classical Karnatic and Hindustani genres have gracefully accepted
our invitation to the Shaankara Geeta Sourabha Saptaha and would be
performing at this unprecedented event, bringing the blissful experience to
all of us with their musical innovations.

 Pl. see the details of the week-long program in the invitation

this event.
