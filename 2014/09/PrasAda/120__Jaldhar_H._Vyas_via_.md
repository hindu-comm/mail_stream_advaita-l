Needless to say I am not an expert on Christian theology but my 
understanding is grace is freely given by God or is the very attribute of 
God while mercy (which is usually how I've seen kripa translated) is 
something that has to be earned.  And I think its true that we think of 
kripa as something that is won by punya and lost by paapa so it is not 
quite the same as grace.
