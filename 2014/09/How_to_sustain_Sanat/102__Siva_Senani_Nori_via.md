I was listening to Dr. K. Aravinda Rao the other day speak about this aspect. Apparently Hinduism is portrayed so negatively in some (?) American schools - like videos or photos of dead bodies floating in the Ganges and of people saying that Ganges is holy and bathing in the Ganga - that some kids feel ashamed and make statements such as "I am ashamed to be a Hindu". Dr. K Aravinda Rao wrote a book "How to tell Hinduism to your child" (http://advaita-academy.org/pages/BooksSingle.aspx?BookId=135). I did not yet get a chance to read the book (the copies were not adequate during the book-launch) but knowing the author (ex. DGP of Andhra Pradesh), present editor of advaita-academy.org, with a Ph. D. in Sanskrit - I am sure the book has some good pointers.

Misrepresentation of Sanatana Dharma is to be found everywhere. Some do it our of ignorance, some do it in order to provoke, some do it to become famous, and yet others do it purposefully to discredit. The last group silently, covertly influences, facilitates, encourages the general population to denigrate Hinduism and then highlights it. 

What can we do? Participate in the discourse and dispel the mis-representations to the extent we can.

Regards
N. Siva Senani
