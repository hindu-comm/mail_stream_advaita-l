Namaste

I did not know before the Yajnopavita Sacred thread can be prepared by
Brahmin Vidhava or Virgin. I regularly buy sacred thread in the Pooja
articles shops or they will give it in a Math. I never asked how they
prepared it. Now I know we have to get the threads from a Brahmin Widow or
Virgin and prepare the Knot and wear it.

All Shakhas of Yajur Veda are following the same practice or only
Agniveshya? Thank you.
