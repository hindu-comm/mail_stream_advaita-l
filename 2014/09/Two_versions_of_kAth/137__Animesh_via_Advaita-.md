Srī mātre namah

Namaste 

kAthak shAkha of krishna yajurveda is only followed  by kashmiri bramhans.It is surviving in kashmiri pundit community .
My this post describes two versions of kAthak grihya sutra and kAthaka mantra pAtha.
I request all group members to visit it.
For any query or objection or further please email me.
