>The parīkṣa method is followed wherein in each round, the President and Vice-President of the sabha start reciting a panasa (roughly fifty words) from a random point in each kāṇḍa; the next pair of scholars continues from where the President and Vice-President stop; thereafter the third pair continues from where the second pair stops; and so on till all the scholars present complete chanting one panasa each in pairs. There would be seven rounds to cover the seven kāṇḍas of the samhitā part of the Krishna Yajurveda and three rounds to cover the Brāhmaṇa, and one to cover the Āraṇyaka and Upaniṣat portions.

>Ghanapāṭhis would recite the ghanapāṭha of the panasas in the samhita; Kramapāṭhis would recite the kramapāṭha. Scholars of other branches of Veda, if present, would recite at the beginning or end of each round from the relevant portions of the particular branch. Only the mūlam is recited in the four rounds of  Brāhmaṇa and Āraṇyaka.
