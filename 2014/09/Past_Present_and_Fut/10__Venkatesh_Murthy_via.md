Namaste

Thank you. You are saying we cannot see and experience the Present time. I
agree with this.

Speed of Light is not infinity but finite. They say it is approximately
186,000 miles per second.

Take a star 4 light years distance from us. When you are seeing it now that
information is already 4 years old. The light from the star left 4 years
back and is hitting your eye's retina now. You are not seeing that star now
but the star 4 years back. You are seeing the star's Past. You CANNOT see
the star's Present.

Like this if you are seeing a table in front of you. It may be only 2 feet
from you. But Light is taking some very very small time like 2 nano seconds
to come from table to your eye. But when you see it you are seeing 2 nano
seconds back. You are seeing the table's Past not Present.

The Conclusion is Present cannot be seen. If you see something it is Past
only. But Past is an illusion. It is not existing now. All things Seen are
Past and those things are illusion. Present cannot be Seen.
