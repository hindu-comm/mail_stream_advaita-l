Namaste Sri Chandramouli

There is no darkness of illusion once we realize the Seer is alone real but
not Seen objects. This is Drig Drishya Viveka. This is also matching with
Gaudapaada. The Seen is not there before Origination and not there after
Termination. But it is appearing in between. The Gaudapaada Conclusion is
it is not existing in between also.

What is there in between if Seen object is not there? The Seer is existing
always. In Past, Present and Future. There is no darkness because the Seer
with the brilliance of crore Suns is there. It is alone and nothing other
than Seer is there. This is the Truth.
