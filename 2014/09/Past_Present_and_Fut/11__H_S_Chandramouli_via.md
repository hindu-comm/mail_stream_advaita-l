Sri Venkateshji and Sri Sadanandji,


Pranams. I presume both of you are interpreting the Gaudapada karika << Adau
ante ca yAn nAsti vartamAnepi tat tathA>>. I think the meaning is
different. What I understand from it is as follows.


Whatever has an origination ( nonexistent prior to  that ) and has a
termination ( meaning nonexistent subsequently ) is really nonexistent
during the intervening period also ( meaning when we consider it as
existing ). This is only a provisional meaning prior to closer scrutiny.
Nothing originates without a cause and nothing is terminated also without
resolving into its cause. So what the karika states is that whatever
existed prior to origination of a vastu and continues to exist subsequent
to the  termination of the vastu is really what  “ exists “ during the
interregnum also ( between origination and termination ) . The “existence “
of the vastu during this interregnum is only an “ appearance “ and not
really “ existence “. This is the advaitic stand. This is one of the
classical definitions of the term mithya . In the understanding the
emphasis should be on the “ Existent “ throughout and not on the “
appearance “ during the interregnum. Instead of getting mired in the
darkness of illusion all over the place and at all times how wonderful it
would be to bask in the brightness of the ever existent satchitananda
Atman/Brahman all over the place and at all times. The karika implies that
is how we should mould our thinking.

Regards
