Venkatesh PraNAms

Time is gap between two sequential observations with observer independent of the observable entities.
present is gap between past and future and one keep dividing the present - today, this hour, this minute, this second, this micro second, this peco second ... until gap essentially disappears. What remains indivisible is the one who is dividing - the presence of the observer or witnessing consciousness who is beyond the time. The Goudapada statement you quoted is essentially resolves to this.

Hari Om!

 Namaste

 I am making this statement and want to know opinions of
 others. I think
 Past is an illusion and Future is also illusion only. What
 happened is not
 happening now. It is not existing now. Past is illusion.
 Future is not
 existing also. It is an illusion.

 The Present we are seeing is also illusion. Why? Because we
 are seeing
 something but that thing's Past and Future are false. It was
 not there in
 Past and will not be there in Future. It cannot be there now
 also.
