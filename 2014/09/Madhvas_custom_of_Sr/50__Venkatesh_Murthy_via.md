I heard we have some freedom for doing Devata Karyas like Homa. We can make
adjustments and take short cuts. But there is not such liberty  for doing
Pitru Karyas. You can do Chandi Homa on any day whenever you like. But
Pitru's annual Sraddha must be done exactly on the death tithi date. You
cannot do it earlier or later some time. Like this there are more
restrictions for Pitru Karyas.

Second point is the most important part of the Sraddha ritual is the
Brahmana Bhojana. The Sraddha Karta will invite Pitrus in the body of
Brahmana and ask them to eat and be pleased in Brahmana's body. If
Brahmanas are well fed the Pitrus will be pleased. Which Brahmin are you
pleasing if you keep Darbhe instead of Brahmana? After the Brahmanas have
taken the food the remaining cooked food is the Pitru Sesha. The Sraddha
Karta and his family will eat the Pitru Sesha and they be blessed by Pitrus
through this Pitru Sesha. How can you get blessings of Pitrus if you are
not feeding any Brahmana?
