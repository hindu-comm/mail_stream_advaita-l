Dear
In Gaya also group srardham is only done.But separate two Brahmanas are allotted for representing the Vishwe devar and Pithrus.The pair allotted receive arghyam etc from the performing couple.But meals are common to all such Brahmins who personate the Vishwe devar and Pithrus .There are small variations as compared to what we do in our households.The purohith who conducted the group srardham said it is Kshethram based.R.Krishnamoorthy.
