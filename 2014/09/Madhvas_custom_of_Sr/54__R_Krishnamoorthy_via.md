Dear Sri Venkatesh Murthy
What I have said is out of my  experience.I have been doing srardham for
almost for the past 45 years.Ihave done them in
Pune,Mumbai,Chennai,Dindigul,Madurai,Kotagiri,Mettupalayam and
Coimbatore.What I find is for the past ten years this is the trend.If your
experience is good be blessed.There are instances where the conducting
purohit himself will represent a pithru/viswedeva and claim dakshina for
both parts,One swallow does not make a summer.Iwill not say they are
greedy.But they have also to measure up to the present levels of
affluence-some are having cars too-and the result is what I have
written.Dakshina is an important factor whether you accept it or not.Even
if you conduct by way of Hiranya srardham they demand full dakshina is my
experience.Of course we should give full respect for them and give them
their dues.But capacity to do it varies from individual to individual. Your
telling that the modern educated Brahmin spends so lavishly but cringes for
srardham expenditure is not correct.Why you call them as animal is beyond
my comprehension.For your information the NRIs among my relatives give good
dakshina for all functions.Anyway there are deficiencies in
bothsides.R.Krishnamoorthy,

> It is sad to see Brahmin stereotyping statements  by well respected
members in this list. Can you say ALL Brahmins in Sraddha are aged and are
greedy for Dakshina. I have seen many Brahmins middle aged sitting in
Sraddha and not expecting  high Dakshina. I have seen Brahmins in Sraddha
getting not more than 200 rupees. I have seen many young Brahmin Purohitas
performing Sraddha ceremony. What can you say to that? Kindly stop making
general statements on Brahmins. Every Brahmin is different.

It is only people like the above members try to justify why they cannot do
Sraddha properly. I agree Sraddha is not easy and cheap ceremony. But it is
not beyond the reach of a middle class Brahmin. The same people complaining
of high Sraddha expenditure Maximum 10000 rupees yearly will not hesitate
for a nano second to give lakhs of rupees yearly for the children's
education in India and abroad. They proudly even say they paid lakhs to
educate children in front of friends. The most dangerous animal is the
Modern Educated Brahmin. He has licked the Britishers boots before
Independence and now he is licking the foreigner's boots after
Independence. The Britishers filled his mind with contempt for Brahmins and
he is continuing it now.

The giving Swampakam to Brahmins is for lazy and stingy people only. If you
can afford to spend 10000 rupees Maximum annually and 2 - 3 hours time for
your departed parents yearly why not do it? Cut your other expenditure like
eating food in hotels.
