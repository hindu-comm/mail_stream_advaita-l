Namaste Sri Animesh Mahodaya

In daily Nitya Brahma Yajna and other rituals the first four Vedic Mantras
are Agnimeele for Rig, IsheTvorje Tva for Yajur, Agna Ayaahi Veetaye for
Sama and Shanno Deveer Abhishtaye for Atharvana. For the first three Vedas
the first Mantras are all correct. But in Shaunaka Atharvana Shakha the
first Mantra is not that. It is different.

How can you explain why we are saying Shanno Deveer Abhishtaye Mantra as
First Mantra? It may be Paippalada Atharvana Shakha but what about Shaunaka
Shakha? Is it possible in Ancient times only Paippalada Shakha was there
and Shaunaka was introduced later? Some people say Paippalada does not have
Svara marks in the text. You can say it without Svaras.

Side question - Is Shanno Deveer Abhishtaye Mantra also for praying to
Shani Graha? But there is no Shani reference in that Mantra.
