Namaste

In my experience with the Sringeri Peetham, I have noticed on several
occasions that persons come to have the Jagadguru's darshan at the daily
allotted time and show Him the plan, photos, etc. of a proposed temple and
seek His blessings.  The Acharya looks at the papers, sometimes even takes
them in His hands and asks some questions to familiarize Himself with the
project and gives his copious blessings.  There is Sri Sitarama Sharma in
the Peetham who is well versed with Temple matters and can also be
consulted for various aspects.

There is no need for you to mention/reveal your devotion to Sri Satya Sai
Baba in such places.  You also need not approach through the CEO for just
getting the blessings at this stage.
