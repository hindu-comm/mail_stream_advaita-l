Namaste to everyone

I would like to add one thing on this. Let's say a gruhastha male whose
parents are alive but his father-in-law is not alive, then till the time
gruhastha has male progeny and his upanayanam is completed he should do
shraddha and other like mahalaya. I also heard the same thing when Brahma
Sri Seshadrinatha Sastrigal was giving lecture on dharma sastra.

Thanks
C.R.Bala


Om Namah Shivayah
