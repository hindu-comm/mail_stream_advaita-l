Namaste,

Your father is correct. It should be started in Sarad purNimA. Pitru paksha
is not a good time to start IMO, others can confirm here. Honestly,
DAndiyA-rAsa (todays version) is just for fun, no spirituality. Hence as a
dance competition or as enjoyment / recreation, people think practically
and select time and not look at panchang. garbA is related to garbha, that
we have in the centre. There are many meanings of dancing around this garbA
/ garbha, but people are least interested in knowing these things (google
to know more). Athiesim in guise of modern thinking is a universal problem.
navarAtri is a festival related to devi-s and devi upAsaka-s should
meditate both externally and later on internally by activating kundalini
with the help of guru, but who is interested in spiritual / yogic aspects.

Hari OM


OM

Sujal
