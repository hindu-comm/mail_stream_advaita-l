Not really.  It is considered meritorious for everyone to read the Garuda 
Purana which has a lengthy section called Preta Kalpa which deals with 
the afterlife.  During the 19th century a vidwan named Pandit 
Navanidhirama created an epitome of the G.P. called 
Garudapuranasaroddhara.  It was translated into English (albeit by 
Thesophists.  Take it with a pinch of salt.) and you can see 
find it online here:  http://sacred-texts.com/hin/gpu/gpu01.htm
