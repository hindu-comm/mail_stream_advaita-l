I would prefer an honest atheist to those hypocrites.  Even modern 
thinking reformer types who may have warped principles but atleast they 
have principles.  These types think of nothing but their own convenience. 
Like I said it is a problem that will solve itself in one generation.  No 
matter how much outward show they make, their children will see their 
attitude towards dharma is one of contempt.  They will not respect it or 
their elders and will not seek to perpetuate such a useless culture. 
With luck and proper guidance they might find their way to astikata but 
sadly it is more likely they will drift away altogether.
