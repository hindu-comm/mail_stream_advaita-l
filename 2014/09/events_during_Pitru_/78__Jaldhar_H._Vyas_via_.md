Your father is correct.  As well as Navaratri, Garba is also performed 
around Sharad Purnima (Purnima of Ashvin masa) as that is when the events 
of rasapanchadhyayi in Bhagavata Purana took place but it is absolutely 
not ok during pitr paksha.  Unfortunately some weekend Hindus shunt all 
utsavas to Saturday and Sunday regardless of the correct tithi.  It's a 
problem that will solve itself in one generation.
