I am a Sikh adhering to the teachings of Guru Granth Sahib ji. All the sikh
sampradayas teach from various books of advaita (sarkutavali, vichar sagar,
prabodh chndrodya natak, vritti prabhakar etc) hence, leaning towards
advait. I have come here to clear few of my doubts as this forum has good
scholars. Really great read. :)
