We've added some new members but I've been remiss in posting their 
introductions.  Sorry for the delay.

B.S. Manian
-----------

I am new entrant in the field of advaita Vedanta, and would like to know
more, clear doubts etc and go deep in the study.


Ravikiran
---------

I have interest in advaitic discussions as taught by the Sankara sampradAya.


Kishoore
--------
I am very much interested in Vedanta Philosophy.


Aurobind Padiyath
-----------------

Having studied under Swami Chinmayanandaji and later with his disciple Swami
Harinamananda and many other Vedantins, I am convinced about the validity of
Advaitam and more so with Gaudapada's Karika for Maandukya Upanishad. That
alone is the way in which the truth can be explained and known.
Hari Om!!!


Venkatraghavan S
----------------

Hi,
My name is Venkatraghavan S, presently residing in London, UK. Over
weekends, I am currently doing KY veda adhyayanam with Sri. Ramaganesa
Ganaptigal of Kumbakonam.

While I have always been very interested in Sanatana Dharma, my interest in
Vedanta was kindled by Deivathin Kural by HH Sri Chandrasekhara Saraswathi
Swamigal. This was further developed through HH Sri Bharati Tirtha
Swamigal's talks on youtube which have had a profound effect on building my
understanding of Vedanta. I have tried to develop that by the self study of
some of the Vedanta classics. However, at best, I remain an initiate into
Advaita.

In order to qualify for a more rigorous study, I am presently trying to
develop my proficiency in sadhana chatushtayam. My hope is that as I make
progress in these efforts, I am blessed with the opportunity to
traditionally learn advaita from a guru so that I can start the journey
towards moksha. Joining this list is a start in that direction.
