No but it isn't surprising that there would be conceptual similarities.
Many of the shaiva/shakta traditions which are only found in Southern
India today were prevalent in Kashmir at one time.  For instance the
Vamakeshvari Tantra which is the heart of Shrividya was also commented on
by the Kashmiri Shaiva Jayaratha and is quoted by Abhinavagupta who is
roughly contemporary with Shankaracharya.  It was the Muslim invasions
which disrupted those traditions in the North.
