After the recitation of Durga Saptashati or Chandi Patha in some 
shakta sampradayas especially those that go back to the great upasaka Shri 
Bhaskara Raya, there is recitation of three texts known as rahasya trayi. 
Some time back I posted them with my own translation and commentary.

Murti rahasya

Together they explain how the one supreme Bhagavati produced the 
trimurti and their shaktis who went on to produce the material creation.
