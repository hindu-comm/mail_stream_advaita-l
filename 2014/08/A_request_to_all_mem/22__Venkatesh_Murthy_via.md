Namaste

It is a very interesting blog. I think it is relevant to this group because
it is about Smaarta Sampradaaya.

I could not find some Atharvana Shaakhaa basic procedures  like Atharvana
Sandhyaavandana, Atharvana Samdidhaana, Atharvana Pooja and Atharvana Agni
Mukha. Kindly give details for these procedures.
