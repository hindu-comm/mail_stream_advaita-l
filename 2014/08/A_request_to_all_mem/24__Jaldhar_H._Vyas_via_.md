This is impressive.  Where are you from and is Shaunaka shakha your native 
shakha?  The reason I ask is that historically and in the present day the 
Atharva veda has had the smallest following.  It got to the point where by 
the 1960's there was concern that its tradition might die out altogether. 
The acharya of Kanchi sent scholars to Gujarat to learn it but they were 
all people who had already learned one shakha and were taking up 
atharvaveda as an additional one.

Btw, in your recent posts you have been writing the message in the subject 
field instead of the body.  This is confusing for readers.
