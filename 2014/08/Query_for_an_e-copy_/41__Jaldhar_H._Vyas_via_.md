I don't have either of these but I do have the 1990 reprint from 
Chowkhamba edited by Pt. Tryambakram Shastri with Nyayaratnavali and 
Laghuvyakhya.

I can scan it for you but:

1. I won't be able to get to it until after Janmashtami at the earliest.

2. The paper is old and thin so I don't know how well it will scan.

But if you don't find an existing PDF at archive.org, DLI etc. and this 
may be of help, let me know.
