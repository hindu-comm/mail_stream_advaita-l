Dear Jaldharji,

Thank you indeed for your response. I did find out the Hariharasastri's edition of the Siddhantabindu that my friend Rohana Senevirtane from Oxford has sent me at Pdf, and Pranipata Chaitanyaji has assured me sending the scanned copy of required pages from the Bakre's edition, while I've the Tryambakasastri's edition both in pdf and hard copy.

With sincere pranams and rgs,
Niranjan Saha

I don't have either of these but I do have the 1990 reprint from 
Chowkhamba edited by Pt. Tryambakram Shastri with Nyayaratnavali and 

Laghuvyakhya.

I can scan it for you but:

1. I won't be able to get to it until after Janmashtami at the earliest.

2. The paper is old and thin so I don't know how well it will scan.

But if you don't find an existing PDF at archive.org, DLI etc. and this 
may be of help, let me know.
