Thank you. The Vaitana Srauta Sutra information is interesting. I have one
question. Can you give details what Mantras references are in the Srauta
Karmas like. Do you use only Atharvana Mantras or you will use other Vedas
Mantras like Yajur Veda?

Example -  In Darsha Purnamasa what Mantras are given in Vaitana Srauta
Sutra?

Is Vaitana Srauta Sutra PDF available somewhere? I searched but I cannot
find it.
