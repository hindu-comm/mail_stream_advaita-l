Sr카 m훮tre namah

Namaste 

Dear group members due to question of sr카 Venkatesh ji ,I got inspired and wrote a post on Srauta tradition of Atharvan veda.
I have given a short introduction of Vaitana srauta sutra which is one of few granthas which throws some light on srauta tradition of Atharvan veda.
This post on my blog is dedicated to Sr카 Venkatesh ji .
I request you  to visit it


Regards 
Animesh Nagar
