Hari: Om Praveen Ji,

Thank you very much for your kind help. Glad to inform you the link you indicated works perfectly with me, with no script problems whatsoever.

Very best regards,

Guy W.

Hari: Om, Werlings ji,

The main page of Sankara website seems to be having some script issues. However, it looks as if approaching via other pages such as http://www.sankara.iitk.ac.in/aus.htm is working, since the entire left pane shows up there too. Pls check if it helps.

PS: You may want to write to them for a fix as well.




Kind rgds,

Dear List members,

Does anyone of you know what happened to the Sankara Site, which was hosted at

http://www.sankara.iitk.ac.in/

There are now several months that I cannot connect my computer to this site, which was very useful to me, and I guess to many other seekers interested by Sri Adi Sankara.

Now, I use instead the resources offered by the  <javascript:void(0);> अद्वैतशारदा Project of शृङ्गेरी.

But the Sankara Site had advantages which I regret to have lost.

वन्दनानि
