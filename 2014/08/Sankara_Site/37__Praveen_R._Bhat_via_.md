Hari: Om, Werlings ji,

The main page of Sankara website seems to be having some script issues.
However, it looks as if approaching via other pages such as
http://www.sankara.iitk.ac.in/aus.htm is working, since the entire left
pane shows up there too. Pls check if it helps.

PS: You may want to write to them for a fix as well.

Kind rgds,
--Praveen R. Bhat
