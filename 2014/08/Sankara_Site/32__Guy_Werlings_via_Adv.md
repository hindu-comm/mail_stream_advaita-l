Dear List members,

Does anyone of you know what happened to the Sankara Site, which was hosted at

http://www.sankara.iitk.ac.in/

There are now several months that I cannot connect my computer to this site, which was very useful to me, and I guess to many other seekers interested by Sri Adi Sankara.

Now, I use instead the resources offered by the  <javascript:void(0);> अद्वैतशारदा Project of शृङ्गेरी.

But the Sankara Site had advantages which I regret to have lost.

वन्दनानि

Guy W.
