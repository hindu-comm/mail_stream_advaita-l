This announcement is about the uploading of the benedictory talks delivered
in Kannada on a daily basis by HH Sri Shankara Bharati Swaminaḥ in
Bangalore during the current, ongoing, chāturmāsya observance.

Those who can follow Kannada can benefit immensely from these talks as the
Swamiji is well versed in the Vedanta, having been taught by traditional
Acharyas.

The talks cover certain hymnal/vedantic works of Shankaracharya on Sri
Dakshinamurti.  More uploads are to be announced.
