This shows that advaitic experience is not confined to only hindus. People other than hindus can have it. More important coclusion is Hindu ritualistic practice is not a prerequisite for advaitic experience.

praNAms 
Hare Krishna

And with the same breath can we also say that to have the advaitic experience (!!??) even traditional direct sAdhana method i.e. shravaNa, manana and nidhidhyAsana of shAstra vAkya  too not a prerequisite??  

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
