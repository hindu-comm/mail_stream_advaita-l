You are not framing the problem properly which is leading you to erroneous 
conclusions.  First ask yourself; what is Hinduism?  what is "advaita 
experience."

Interestingly I was just reading about a psychological study wherein some 
10% of atheists reported having a "religious" experience including 
feelings of oneness and bliss.  If you accept the dogma that "All is 
pervaded by Brahman." then why would that be surprising?  Even rocks, and 
plants and animals have "advaita experiences" but because they do not have 
chetana and viveka it is meaningless for them.  Similarly, I noticed that 
while some participants in that study reevaluated their beliefs after 
their experience, others were insistent that it did not change their 
worldview at all.  Then what good is an "advaita experience."?  There have 
been mystics in other religions too.  But when a loyal follower of the 
Abrahamic God reads in the bible "You cannot see My face, for no man can 
see Me and live!" (Exodus 10:33) they will not have the conceptual 
framework to understand their experiences in an advaitic way.  (The same, 
btw, applies to "Hindu" theists.)

"advaita experience" is not enough because experiences can be fleeting. 
This is the Vedantic argument against e.g. yoga whose goal is samadhi. 
When samadhi or "advaita experience" or whatever you want to call it is 
stable and continuous then and only then is it jnana.  Only this jnana 
leads to moksha which is the goal of Advaitins.  This is where the 
ritualistic practice (karma and upasana) come in.  In a narrow sense you 
are correct that they are not prerequisites.  But as a practical matter it 
is through karma and upasana one develops the competency to make ones 
"experiences" into jnana.
