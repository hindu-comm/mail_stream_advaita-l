"I wish to find if all upaniShada-s could be found with svara."
Namaste, the ninth edition of Mantra Pushpam published by Ramakrishna Math , Mumbai, has  18 upanishads and has swara annotation for a number of the ancient upanishads:

1) Traditionally accepted as sasvara
Isha (full ghana text is also given)Taittiriya, incl MahanarayanaBrihadaranyaka (note only 2 svaras, udatta, anudatta. Recordings available of this upannishad being chanted traditionally)

2) Generally recited with Svara, though unclear if svara was fixed later than original compositionGanapatiAitereya (texts available with accented Aranyaka text, though the svara rules do not correspond to pratisakhya rules uniformly-note the same can be said of Aruna prashna of Taittiriya Aranyaka also as an example)SuryaNarayana (Surya and Narayana tend to follow Aitereya style svara)
3) Shown with Svara in the book, publishers state in previous editions that the svarra markings were somhow "recovered"KathaMundakaKena

No swara:
MandukyaPrashnaChandogyaShwetashwataraKaivalya

It is not clear whether the svara markings of group 3 are generally accepted within the tradition. For example the svara markings of the first few mantras of Kathopanishad do not correspond to the authentic svaras of theproto text in the  Taittirita Brahmanam Kathaka portion. Ganapati upanishad svara markings have many variants also
Hope this helps. One should always learn from a pandit versed in the traditional method than just the book.
RegardsSubhanu
