Yes that seems to be true. I got a reply from the professor asking me to contact him in October. Here is his reply.



Dear Ramani,

Thank you for your note. Please contact me some time in October for further information.

All good wishes,

Sir,

I heard that a Chair for Adi Shankara is going to be set up in the University. What is the purpose and type of study that will be done. I am a follower of advaita principles.

Ramani
