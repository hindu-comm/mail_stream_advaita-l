Although this point is not of any concern to the Advaitin, yet I want to
show here that in that talk, Sri Bannanje Govindacharya says:

//Whenever one talks of Dvaita, immediately this verse is cited (see
below).  But all these tenets apply to the Ramanuja school too!! Hence it
is out of ajñāna, ignorance, someone has composed this verse.//

My comment on the above observation of BG:

Traditionally Madhvas have held that it is a composition of Sri Vyasa
Tirtha, though it is not accepted by all to be so.  Hence, a section of
Madhvas is undecided about its authorship. (A renowned Dvaita scholar told
me this when I wanted him to verify a hand out I had prepared giving the
salient features of all three schools in three verses of those schools)  In
any case the Madhvas hold this verse in high esteem as giving out their
tenets and honour it as 'nava ratna' of Madhva system.  BG's terming it a
product of ignorance is very strange.

(I have copied this from a Dvaitin's article):

SreeManMadhwamate Hari: Paratara: Satyam Jagat thatvato

BhinnaaH jeevajanaa: Hareranucharaa Neechotcha Bhaavam gathaa: |

Mukthir Naija Sukhanubhutir-amalāBhakthishcha Thath Saadhanam

Hyakshaadi Thrithayam pramaanam Akhila AAmnayaika Vedya Hari: ||


Nine Tenets are propounded in this sloka and the meaning, in parts,  of
this sloka is -

Hari is the most supreme of all…..

This world (Jagat) which is made out five differences, is eternal and not a
false.

Attaining one's Nija-swaroopa (True-Nature) is called as Mukti.

Faultless Bhakthi (Devotion) is the means to attain Mukti.//

From the above, we come to understand that Hari is Supreme. He is
independent and we are regulated and controlled by him. If we understand
this and have unflinching faith on God as well as Guru Bhakthi, we can
easily cross over the Ocean of Samsara..//
