Beginner in Vedanta

I am having a tough time in life, and could use good guidance. I've heard
some of the ideas that fall under the framework of Vedanta, and they seem
important to know. The posts on this site generally seem precise and
integrious.  I'm interested in practices to help my life

I am interested in Indian Philosophy especially Advaita tradition. I have
read many books in English and Kannada pertaining to traditional Advaita as
taught by Sringeri Sampradaya.
