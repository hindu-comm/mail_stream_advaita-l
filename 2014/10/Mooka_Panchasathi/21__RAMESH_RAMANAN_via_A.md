Pranams,
This is regarding the enquiry for Mooka Panchashathi text with English translation. I had downloaded the English translations for all the five parts of the Mooka Panchashathi sometime ago. If the questioner can send me an email, i will be able to send the attachments in PDF format through email. My email address is rameshramanan at yahoo.co.uk.
