Dear
In the Gita The Lord says that deeds done according to ones swadharma even if it is attendant with defects is better than a perfectly done deed of para dharma .Paradharmo Bhayavaha :.So the poster 's view point is that defective rendering by a person who by his swadharma  has acquired a right to chant etc the Vedic mantras will not amount to a sin.But his swadharma will compel him to correct his wrong recitals sooner or later.R.Krishnamoorthy.
