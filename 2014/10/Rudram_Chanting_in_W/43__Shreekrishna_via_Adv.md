Srigurubhyo namaH

I am a silent observer of many discussions in this forum. But this
particular thread caught my attention.

I do not have much to add to the discussion, save this point. The
appropriateness of the so-called mlechchas chanting rudram apart, this is a
wake-up call to the entire Brahmin community, that if we do not "save our
wealth", it will soon be usurped by outsiders, to the extent that, 300
years from now, Brahmins might have to approach mlechchas to learn that
that really belonged to their ancestors.

As a community, we have the tendency to get lost and engrossed in minute
details, dos and don'ts, to such an extent, that we may very well miss the
big tsunami that is coming our way to wash us off our roots.

Lastly, I had mentioned this event on my Facebook wall, and shall mention
it here too. The government of India should take note of this event. If one
were to chant rudram or chamakam in Rashtrapati Bhavan or Parliament House,
the media and segments of the opposition would be shouting at the top of
their voice, calling it "unsecular", and questioning why Azaan is not sung
instead. It is most disheartening to note that, while America embraces
Indian culture so remarkably, India is failing to identify itself with its
traditional roots.

It is in our interest to put behind differences and question the intent and
appropriateness of the event, and take this as a tight slap on the Brahmin,
Hindu and Indian community.

Shreekrishna.
