Namaste

In North India they can wear clothes for cold weather but in America the
temples will be heated internally. There is no cold inside. And priests in
America temples are dressed traditionally like South Indian Brahmin
priests. You can see priests in Washington temple here in this video -

America temples are following our South Indian tradition only in Vedic
activities. They have to follow same dress code also. They have to remove
shirts, pants and shoes.

They may be wearing other dresses in Bhajans and non Vedic activities. That
is not wrong.

We had long discussion on Go Mamsa and others long time back. The cannon
guns are silent now. I don't want to re ignite. Sorry. You can check the
archives.
