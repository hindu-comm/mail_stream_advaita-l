namaste,

There overall rendition is quite good. When I first clicked on the link, I
wasn't expecting it to be of this quality. The errors I was referring to
are an apasvara in the mantra "pramuncha dhanvanastvam ubhayor ...", as
well as anudAttas that sound like udAttas in a couple of places.

This video is making the rounds in internet circles. In many cases it's
titled as "perfect chanting" or something similar. That's the reason I
mentioned the "errors". This chanting isn't perfect (whatever that is) :-)

sasneham,

    ajit
