> This is not a response to Sri Srirudra in particular, but more a humble
request to the forum itself. In the spirit of what Sri. Vidyasankar said
earlier, I'd merely like to recollect what Adi Shankara BhagvatpadAl said:

*Tvayi mayi chAnyatraiko vishNuh, vyartham kupyasi mayi asahishNuh* -
whether in me, or in you, the prevailing consciousness is but one, so why
get intolerant and angry in vain?

While we may have a strong justification for harbouring opinions -
especially when shAstra pramANam is on our side, arguing and belabouring
the point after a while only gets counterproductive. This is presumably a
forum for discussions on advaita, let our righteous indignation (however
justified, or otherwise, as each side may feel) not get in the way of
spiritual advancement in that field.

Regards,
Venkatraghavan
