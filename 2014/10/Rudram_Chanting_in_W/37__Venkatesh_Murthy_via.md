I tried to watch this but the Urdu words fell on my ears like sharp arrows
and tormented me very much. I became sad.

Better watch this video of Comparison of Advaita, Visistadvaita and Dvaita
in Sanskrit in University of California Berkeley by Bannanje Govindacharya.
I don't agree with him in all points but it is GREATLY more interesting
when Nectar like Sanskrit words fall on the ears. When Sanskrit words fall
on ears the heart becomes glad automatically.
