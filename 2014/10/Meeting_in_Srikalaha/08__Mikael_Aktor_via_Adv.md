Dear list members,

I am presently in Srikalahasti, Andhra Pradesh, for a field work study on the pañcāyatanapūjāśilās. If any of you happens to live in the area, I would be very happy to meet and have a talk about my work. Please contact me off-list at aktor at sdu.dk<mailto:aktor at sdu.dk>.

I also seek contact with list members from the Patna area, Bihar, where I will arrive in about two weeks.

Best regards,
Mikael Aktor, Ass. Prof., Ph.D.,
Department of History, Study of Religions,
University of Southern Denmark.
