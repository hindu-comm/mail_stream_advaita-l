I don't think there will be a 100% equivalent because central to the 
theology of those Western religions is the idea that we are born as 
sinners and need to be rescued from the wrath of God.  Even in the 
theistic traditions of Hinduism this would be tamasika bhakti at best.  In 
Advaita Vedanta we are taught that we are none other than the one perfect 
Brahman and it is only due to ignorance that wew have come to identify 
with a limited self characterized by pain and sorrow.  In the kshmapana 
shlokas we say after a puja there is an apology to Bhagavan but that is 
for any mistakes which may have been made in that vidhi not for our very 
natures.  Bhagavans krpa ("mercy" would be a decent translation.) is in 
forgiving those particular mistakes and to make known the saving knowledge 
of brahmajnana not in deigning to stop torturing us after sufficient 
flattery.

This would refer to the favor that Bhagavan gives to the highest bhaktas. 
Who might not be who you think.  (Bhagavan does not play favorites but 
alots a fate depending on a particular jivas karma.)  Mahishasura counted 
himself the greatest enemy of Durga Ma but by the favor of Her glance and 
speech and touch he was transformed and reached the highest level of 
jnana.
