In the Taittiriya Upanishad there is a saying - Yaanyasmaakam Sucharitaani
Taani Tvayopaasyaani No Itaraani.

What the Guruji is doing if it is good action according to Dharma we have
to follow it. But not other actions even if done by Gurus. This means even
in ancient times some Brahmins were doing actions for money and materialist
gains not for Dharma.

In Bhagavata there is a story of Takshaka the Snake giving some bribe to a
Brahmin to go away and allow him to bite Parikshita Raja. Otherwise the
Brahmin could have cured Parikshita. You can say Parikshita died because of
a Bribe. In those days also some Brahmins were greedy for money.

In America if some Veda Ghanapaathis have given Rudram and other Mantra
Upadesha to Mleccha Jatis it is not good according to Dharma. We should not
follow it. We should not mix with such Mlecchas and join them in Chanting.

We should always try level best to follow only Dharmic action but not
others. We cannot give excuse like nobody is following Dharma why should I?
