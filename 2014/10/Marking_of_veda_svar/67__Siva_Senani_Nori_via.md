Sri Bhaskar,

Namaste.

There are two different markings involved. One is what is known as diacritical marks. This is what you see in the word mahāprāṇa. You get these in a document-editing program like MS Word and simply copy-paste onto Yahoo Mail or Gmail. In MS Word use Insert / Symbols to get the letter with diacritical marks. You will notice that MS Word allows you to assign shortcuts. This is very handy feature. Across the computers that I use, I assign common shortcuts such as Alt+a = ā, Alt+Ctrl + n = ñ and so on. Once you assign keyboard short-cuts, usually Yahoo Mail and Gmail should allow you to use them within those programs as well.

The second set of marks are the svara-markings. These are not available in all fonts. Sanskrit 2003 is a font where these are available.

 Kindly let me know, so that it will be useful for me to put 'svara' markings for the mantra-s which I have  soft copy in word and RT format.
