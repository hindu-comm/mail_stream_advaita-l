A relevant extract on a Master's view on the actions of a GYAnin follow.

The key statement is, "A GYAnin will not do so normally", implying that
the GYAni CAN act in unregulated ways, but that it is not common.

Sureshvara saying, "If a GYAnin were to act in an unregulated fashion, then
what is the difference
between him and a dog, which consumes even what is unclean?"
Permits this interpretation also: "A GYAnin can really act in any way,
even unregulated ways, but an ordinary man
should not fancy himself a GYAnin and
start acting in a perverted manner."
Certainly, Krishna was a cowherd, but not all cowherds are Krishna!

Here is a relevant  excerpt from the book Exalting Elucidations which 
contains discourses of Swami Abhinavavidyatirtha.  (pp. 307-308)

Disciple: Is a GYAnin beyond virtue and sin?

Abhinavavidyatirtha: Yes.

D:  Then, since no merit or sin is acquired by a GYAnin, will he conduct 
himself in any manner whatsoever?

A: A GYAnin will not do so normally.  His mind should have been extremely 
pure  prior to his attaining GYAna.  This purity remains even after the 
dawn of knowledge.  A GYAnin is an ideal for others.  sureshvarAchArya has 
observed, "if a GYAnin were to act in an unregulated fashion, then what is 
the difference between him and a dog, which consumes even what is unclean?"

D: Should the shrAddha of a GYAnin be performed after he dies?

A: Yes.

D: A GYAnin will not be reborn.  How then is shrAddha useful?

A: To whom?

D: To the GYAnin.

A: As far as the GYAnin is concerned, it serves no purpose.

D: Then why should the shrAddha be performed?

[Now read this next bit carefully - JV]

A:  Because the relatives do have a duty to fulfil.  From the GYAnin's 
point of view, performance of shrAddha is of no use.  However, the 
relatives continue to have their duty to perform shrAddha.  Just because 
one becomes a GYAnin, one's relatives are not absolved of their duty. 
They are bound to perform those actions that the shAstra-s have prescribed 
for them.
