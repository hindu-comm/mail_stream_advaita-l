Here there is a Sanskrit Debate on Jagan Mithyaatva. Advaitis are declaring
Jagat is Mithyaa. How? Drishyatvaat. Because it is seen. Some Dvaiti
scholars like Sri Haridas Bhat, Principal of Poornaprajna Vidyapeetha are
arguing against Advaita.

The Advaiti scholars are from Tirupati. Dvaitis are saying Pratyaksha
Pramaana is stronger than Anumaana Pramaana because Pratyaksha is Upajeevya
and Anumaana is Upajeevi. Advaitis are negating this. It is a complicated
debate. In the end Moderator Sri Prahladachar is saying it is endless
debate and stopping it. A complicated but interesting debate. Must See.
