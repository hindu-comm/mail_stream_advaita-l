I have seen a couple of relatively young purohitas who have atharvaNa vedAdhyayana
to their credit, participating in various events at the Saradamba temple in Stroudsburg.
However, they are not based there on a permanent basis.

I'm not sure if they are primarily representative of atharvaNa veda in the same sense by
which others are of Rgveda or yajurveda. It seems more likely that their adhyayana of
atharvaNa veda has come after a primary grounding in Rgveda. I will enquire when I get
a chance.

Best regards,
Vidyasankar
