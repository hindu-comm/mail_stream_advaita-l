Srī mātre namah 

Dear group members,

prashnopanishada is one of  Upanishads belonging to atharva veda .Yet our Acharya had written a famous commentary  on it and many translations are there ,this post have a simple Sanskrit translation 
of prashnopanishada from vedic Sanskrit to shastric style of Sanskrit in simple way . Even a beginner can understand this translation .
I request all members to visit and if any thing , any concept is incorrect or misinterpretation is there , let me known .I will try to improve it and try to make it more simple .
