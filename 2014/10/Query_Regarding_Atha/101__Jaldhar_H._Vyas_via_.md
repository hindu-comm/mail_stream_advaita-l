There are two shakhas of Atharvaveda still extant Shaunaka (in Gujarat) 
and Paippalada (in Orrissa.)  So it is not quite the same situation as 
they are two separate shakhas and each is relatively small and 
geographically concentrated.

They went to Gujarat and learned the traditions there as the Atharvavedic 
sampradaya is in a better state of preservation.  You should definitely 
read Animesh's blog.  There is much more information there.
