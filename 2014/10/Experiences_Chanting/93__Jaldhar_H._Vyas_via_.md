Reciting Om or other mantras is not a Vedantic practice per se but a Yogic 
one though of course the two are rather intertwined.  Vedantic practice 
revolves around understanding the difference between what is real and 
unreal, separating oneself from the unreal, and acquiring knowledge of the 
real.  The other spiritual practices are a preparation for this. (By 
which I do not mean to imply that theey are not important in their own 
sphere.)
