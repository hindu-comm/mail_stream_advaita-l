Sriram Nagaraj - PraNAms

A critical analysis of Vedanta Paribhasha of Dharmaraja Advarindra is available at http://advaitaforum.org/discourses-by-dr-sadananad/vedanta-paribasha/
In essence the perceptuality condition involves consciousness expressed as subject and existence expressed as object-thought has to join for one to be conscious of the existence of the object-thought and hence conscious of the existence of the object out there. 
There is extensive discussion in the 7th of Ch. of Pancadashi of Vidyaranya. 
Hari Om!

 I would like to know of references to the Vedantic view of
 perception, by which I mean how the cognition of
 objects/thoughts/emotions happens. Upon the rise of ego, how
 is it that the ego knows it is experiencing or cognizing
 objects/thoughts/emotions etc. Is it self-referential i.e.
 ego sees something and concludes there is an object if so
 how does the ego know it is seeing/experiencing? The answer
 cannot be "because it knows", that is a loop. Or is the very
 definition of ego that which thinks it is cognizing objects
 outside? In Buddhist literature, a lot of work of Asanga and
 his (half?) brother (whose name I have forgotten) go in this
 direction of perception, but I still want to know of
 Vedantic works that address this point. Since this is not a
 theological question, I suppose the answer must be same if
 you are a Vedantist or Buddhist :)
