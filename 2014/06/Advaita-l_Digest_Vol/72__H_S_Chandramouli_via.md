Sri Sadanandaji, Pranams.

The other important work of Sri Appayya Dikshita referred to by the
Translator is Kalpataruparimala and not Advaita Sidhi.

I have again crosschecked the Introduction to the work. The translator does
confirm that the work is concerning Advaita . He states << The
Sidhantalesha is much more than a catalogue of varieties of advaita
doctrine.>>. There are extensive references to the views of Sri
Bhagavatpada/Vachaspati Misra/Mandana's BrahmaSidhi etc ( as indicated by
the Translator ).

Regards

Chandramouli
