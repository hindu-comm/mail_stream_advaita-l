Sri Rameshji / Sri Bhaskarji,



Namaste/Pranams.



During my search for some authoritative works on the issues we are
discussing, I came across “ Sidhantalesasangraha “ by Sri Appayya Dikshita,
an English translation of which can be downloaded at the following link. <<
https://archive.org/details/siddhantalesasan029239mbp >>. The Introdction
by the translator, Sri Suryanarayana Shastri , discusses fairly elaborately
the topics covered in the main work. I was delighted to find that the very
issues we are discussing have been extensively deal twith in this work.
>From a reading of the Introduction ( I am yet to read thru the work itself
) I am furnishing below a summary on the issues we are concerned with in
the current thread.



1.       Avidyas ( Nesciences ) are many, one for each Jiva. But Creation
is one only and so is Iswara.

2.       Realization takes place for each Jiva separately and at different
times.

3.       On Realization the Jiva merges into Iswara ( and not Nirguna
Brahman ). The Jiva becomes Iswara himself.

4.       The BMI of the Realized Jiva is driven by Iswara and not the
particular Jiva itself ( which has merged into Iswara ). Justification for
such a view is also advanced.

5.       Creation has an end in time when the last Jiva gets Realization .
The event of the last Jiva getting Realization is specifically mentioned !!!

6.       Pros and cons of this approach vis a vis the shruti declarations
is discussed.

7.       When all Jivas get Realization, their merger into Nirguna Brahman
takes place. This is called by Sri Appayya Dikshita as “ Sarvamukti “ .



There are hints in the Introduction that the work is not entirely
consistent with Sri Bhagavatpada Bhashya. But unfortunately there does not
appear to be any definite statements as to where exactly the deviations
occur. A more detailed reading may reveal these. But I doubt it. The
translator also mentions that Sri Appayya Dikshita has written over a
hundred works and his views appear to have changed over a period of time.
But this work appears to be prior to his most famous work, “ Advaita Sidhi
“ , and it is quite possible he has taken a different view there. While the
discussions in the work could possibly add to the prevailing confusions, I
think it is very useful for analysis of the issues and coming to our own
judgements, as well as from the point of view of reassuring ourselves that
our doubts are not totally misplaced/frivolous.They have been debated even
by experts.  That should be quite heartening.



Any comments on the conformity of this work with Sri Bhagavatpada Bhashyam
would be very helpful.



Since we are right now on the subject, in my opinion it would be very
fruitful to refer to the work itself for further study.



Regards
