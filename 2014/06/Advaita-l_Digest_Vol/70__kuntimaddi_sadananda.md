 The translator also mentions that Sri Appayya Dikshita has written over a
 hundred works and his views appear to have changed over a period of time. But this work appears to be prior to his most famous work, “ Advaita Sidhi

Chandramouli ji - ParaNAms

Adviata Siddhi that I know was written by Madhusudhana Saraswathi. This is a dialectic work refuting the Nyaaya manjari of dvaita.using Navya Nyaaya. 

Not sure if there is any other Advaita Sidddhi

I doubt that some of the other points that were made are really in tune with Advaita; but not eager to dispute. 

Hari Om!
Sadananda
