Namaskaram,

“Your argument presupposes(a)that there are
really multiple beings, …”

Ø Scriptures (Tai. Up., Br. Up., Ch. Up) declare
that the ‘One’, which is without a second, wants to become ‘Many’. Then, how do
you explain the ‘Many’ at vyavaharik plane?
Ø In addition, can you please give your views whether creation is eternal or not?

Ramesh

Again, this is an inherent limitation due to thinking about liberation as a discrete event happening at different times to different beings. Your argument presupposes (a) that there are really multiple beings, (b) that there will be some time in the future when there will be exactly one last unliberated being left around, who will then attain liberation, and (c) that this last event of liberation will result in creation ceasing to exist.

Obviously, the liberation of this last being should be called a very special event within the vyAvahArika plane. What do you think would distinguish the liberation of this last being from the liberation of any other being at any other time before? And what is it about creation and vyavahAra that prevents all beings in it from attaining liberation at the same time?

Best regards,
Vidyasankar
