PraNAms everybody. A friend of mine asked the following question. Since I do not have much knowledge of karma kanada, I appreciate if someone can answer the question for her. 

Hari Om!
Sadananda
------------------------------------
acharya sada - Karma kaanda of Vedas are all description of Rituals, religious worshiping via yagnaas etc correct? Is there anywhere in Karma Kaanda where worshiping via (to) Idols really described? Just curious.
