Sri Bhagawad Gita - Shankaranandeeya

Can we get Sri Bhagawad Gita - Shankaranandeeya translation (Telugu / Hindi / English),  soft-copy or hard-copy?

I do have Hindi translation by Yativar Sri Bholebaba. However, the print so small that it is hurting my eyes and I am finding it hard to read.


thanks and regards
