Swamiji,
Namaskaram!


I'm sending it to you soon. But I think you have with you MS's the Harililamritam by Sri Bopadeva with a Commentary by Sri Madhusudana Sarasvati and Sribhagavata (first sloka) with the Paramahamsapriya Commentary by the Same Commentator (in Devanagari), edited by Devi Datta Upadhyaya, Chowkhamba Sanskrit Series Office, Beneras, 1933 (perhaps you have edited and uploaded it in your personal blog).

Sincerely,
Niranjan

​Thanks, Niranjan.

I'm able to read Bengali script.

I'm in India.


I'm able to scan the book and share with those who wish to have it.

I'll type the text too.​
