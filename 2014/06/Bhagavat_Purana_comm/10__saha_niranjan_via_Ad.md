Namaste!

No, it seems to be a commentary on the 1st three shlokas only (verse 1, pp. 1-14; verse 2, pp.14-18, verse 3, pp. 18-20). I've got a photostat copy of it from Sanskrita Sahitya Parisad, Kolkata, though the first and last pages have got a black shed (but readable).

I may post it to Indian address while I do not have scanner/camera at my home.

Sincerely,
N.Saha

Thanks. I have seen this mentioned in lists of MS's works but as it had 
not been published as far as I knew I assumed it was probably just a mixup 
with paramahamsapriya. Have you seen it? Is is a fragment of a more 
complete commentary or is it strictly on the first three shlokas only?
