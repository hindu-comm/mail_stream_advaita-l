Understood.

You are right but I feel you are missing the point somewhat.

Well in the bhashya points out that the question that comes with an 
inbuilt presumption -- that there must be a second entity to teach 
self-analysis.  But Viraj Prajapati is in a class by Himself.  His very 
nature is to be filled with jnana.  So when the inevitable eruptions of 
embodied existence occur, He can quell them through his own Lordly powers.
So to the extent that Shankaracharya is not answering the question it is 
only because the question is malformed.

Viraj/Purusha/Prajapati (multiple names are used to illustrate the 
different aspects) is the foremost of the class of upasakas.

It is like a Prime Minister is a member of the class of Members of 
Parliament but being the foremost, has abilities that an ordinary MP does 
not.

Yes.  But there is a link to kramamukti too.

8.16 to be precise.

AbrahmabhuvanallokAH punarAvartino.arjuna |
mAmupetya tu kaunteya punarjanma na vidyate || 16 ||

"[All the] worlds from Brahma's abode [inclusive] are subject to return 
Arjuna. But on reaching me Kaunteya, know there is no rebirth."

"attending classes" is a very imprecise translation of "reaching me"! 
Also because kramamuktas are reborn in brahmaloka does not mean all who 
are in brahmaloka are kramamuktas.

Shankaracharyas comments on this shloka are very short so he must think it 
does not need further interpretation.  Mainly he just notes that all the 
worlds are limited by time i.e. subject to creation and destruction.

The return mentioned in there is not to samsara but the pralaya in which 
all the worlds and their inhabitants are destroyed and reabsorbed into 
Brahman.  The kramamuktas are not affected by that pralaya.

Shridharacharya in his tika on the Gita spells it out more.

bhAvipunarjanma ya evaM kramamuktiphalAbhirupAsanAbhirbrahmalokaM 
prAptAsteShAmeva tatrotpannaGYAnAnAM brahmaNA saha mokShaH

"Even Brahmaloka is also subject to destruction and anyone there who lacks 
the rise of jnana must also undergo rebirth.  those who have attained 
kramamukti through upasana also attain the Brahmaloka and there upon the 
rise of jnana they are liberated along with Brahma."

The first and foremost of those upasakas, i.e.those who have "reached" 
hiranyagarbha, is as I said before in a class by himself and he becomes 
Viraj of the next world-cycle.  When that cycle ends, he too will complete 
his liberation along with the kramamuktas of that era.

But those who at any time have "reached" Krishna Bhagavan (realized 
nirguna jnana) are liberated directly without this roundabout process of 
even one final rebirth in brahmaloka.  This is the tatparya of the shloka.

As this mail has already gotten long, I'll address the other issues 
brought up separately.
