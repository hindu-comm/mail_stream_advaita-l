Actually you have raised a pertinent question.  According to shastras 
several (all?) kings of Mithila were named Janaka.  So I jumped the gun in 
assuming that the Janaka mentioned in the Gita is the father of Sita ma. 
Is Yajnavalkya mentioned in Valmiki Ramayana?  Let me research this 
further...

Regardless, it does not change the main point which is that the Gitas' 
mention of Janaka is to extol karma yoga as a viable alternative to 
sannyasa.
