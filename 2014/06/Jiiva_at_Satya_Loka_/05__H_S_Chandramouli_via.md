It is thus seen that nonreturn from Brahmaloka is guaranteed to all the
aspirants who have reached that loka. I presume my understanding of the
Bhashya is correct.

It is.  The key phrase to note is that aspirants are those "who have that
unconditional Brahman as their ultimate resort."


Is Ratnaprabha considered to be consistent with the
Bhashya in all respects or does it represent independent views which could
also contradict the Bhashya as it considers necessary? Are there any other
commentaries on the Bhashya which differ fro Ratnaprabha?

I can't answer that question in total but here atleast I don't think there
is any inconsistency between the ratnaprabha and the bhashya itself. >>.

Actually when I posted the above mail , I was looking for a Bhashya
authority itself ( and not from other commentaries like Ratnaprabha or
commentators ) for concluding that some jivas who go to brahmaloka do
indeed return from there at some point of time. I was not looking for an
inferential understanding of the issue either. This was provided by Sri
Subrahmanianji subsequently in this thread itself by way of the BUB 6-2-15
wherein Bhashya itself takesup this issue as a question and answer , and
asserts that some of these jivas do indeed return to samsara in due course
of time. With that my question is answered positively.
