Om!

"Janaka, the ruler of a large 
and powerful empire could not in his circumstances perform upasana with 
vairagya but due to his generous dana etc. he merited the birth of Janaki"

How did you conclude that that Janaka and this Janaka are the same? What evidence is advanced for that, by anyone?

Om!

Srikrishna

It is. The key phrase to note is that aspirants are those "who have that 
unconditional Brahman as their ultimate resort."

I can't answer that question in total but here atleast I don't think there 
is any inconsistency between the ratnaprabha and the bhashya itself.

First we must understand the nature of upasana. Upasana can be be of two 
types. The first is as an anga of karma. An example of this is the 
meditations that take place during the ashvamedha. Or the 
panchagnividya. For the mimamsakas all upasanas are of the first type. 
As such the purpose of such upasanas is the procurement of some desired 
object such as in this case residence in brahmaloka.

Vedanta on the other hand says there is a second type which can be an anga 
of jnana. Most sampradayas consider it to have an aspect of karma as well 
but Advaita Vedantins believe karma can be renounced altogether and 
upasana can be done for jnana alone. However we do not deny the existence 
of the first type.

(Also some later thinkers have considered upasana as an end in itself 
alongside karma and jnana but that is not the mainstream Advaitic view.)

Thus the presence of a jiva in brahmaloka can be for two different 
reasons and it is not unreasonable that therefore there can be two 
different outcomes.

Here's an analogy I like. One can visit the campus of Harvard university 
and one can matriculate as a student there. In both cases it can be said, 
"I went to Harvard" but it means two different things right?

As you say, "Because of his ego." Cessation of desire is the heart of 
Advaitic upasana and only that will guarantee non-return to samsara.

The only truthful answer is : it depends on the situation. For the one 
who has developed a distate for these worlds filled with avidya and dukha, 
to withdraw from karma (which it should again be stressed is more than 
just the vaidika karma kanda) is the laudable goal. But for "he who 
wishes to live here for a hundred years" as the Ishopanishad states, it is 
karma yoga -- karma without interest in its results -- which is superior. 
That's why Gita 2.20 says karmaNaiva hi saMsiddhim AsthitA janakAdayaH "By 
karma alone did Janaka etc. achieve success. Janaka, the ruler of a large 
and powerful empire could not in his circumstances perform upasana with 
vairagya but due to his generous dana etc. he merited the birth of Janaki 
and instruction from illustrious sages like Yajnavalkya which eventually 
led to him receiving jnana.

And finally note that Krishna Bhagavans exhortation to Arjuna is not to 
meditate but to fight.
