Namaste

That One is appearing as Many. But in Reality there is no Many. Why One
appears as Many? Because of Maayaa. Where is Maayaa? It is in the ignorant
person only not anywhere. When he realizes Self he will know Only One thing
Brahman is existing.

Another message is talking about Anaaditva of Avidyaa and Brahma. Both are
Anaadi but Only Brahman is Ananta. Why? When the Only Single Jeeva has
realized Self there is no more Avidyaa. There are no Many Jeevas. Other
Jeevas are imagined by the One Jeeva.
