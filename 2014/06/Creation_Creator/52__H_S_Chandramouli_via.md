 I am unable to overcome the feeling that in many places like for example *an
instance of adhyAsa of the manas/citta onto the jIva,* or *Nothing really
happens to the jIva* , Consciouness is used synonymously with jiva  ( or at
least nearly so ) . I may be excused if I have made a foolish blunder.
Would it not be better to understand instead that  jivatva (
jivahood/notion of being a jiva ) is negated/destroyed at the time of
selfrealization ?
