 << Yet, the issue with all these lines of discussion is this. They stay at
the level of vyavahAra, at the level of the individual jIva, presuming the
very multiplicity that advaita transcends. If all that is thought to be
real, then there can be really no moksha in the advaita sense. When we
think that in the macro sense, avidyA continues, is therefore ananta, and
that creation is eternal, we also need to ask, whose is that avidyA? One or
more jIvas that are not yet liberated? If so, then we have just presumed
that there are multiple real jIvas, distinct from one another. It will
follow that the difference between jIvas is also eternal. That would then
not be advaita, but only dvaita, and we might as well affirm the reality
and eternality of jIva-jIva bheda, jIva-ISvara bheda etc. >> .



 I draw attention to the phrase *If all that is thought to be real *in the
above statement. It is certainly not my intention to claim this. It is one
thing to highlight the nature of paramartha svarupa to attain which is
really the Goal / Sadhya. As part of the sadhanas needed to achieve that
Goal , lots of doubts need to be resolved for the jivas . Such doubts are
strongly entrenched in us and bind us to the opposite views. In fact that
is exactly what Nachiketas expresses to Yamadharmaraja in his third
question in Katha Up. To overcome them one needs to address these opposing
views, deliberate on them deeply ,  and overcome them with the help of
Shastra/Reasoning/Anubhava. It is only as part of this exercise the
questions posed in the above statement by Sri Vidyashankarji himself really
need to be deliberated upon and not just wished away. Such deliberation
only brings home the truth that all this is mithya. The conclusion by Sri
Vidyashankarji that such questioning leads to dvaita is in my view
unwarranted.
