<< I would like to know from Advaita perspective if creation is also
eternal. We all know that Creator is eternal, but how about creation?
Bhagawad Gita 13/20 says both are eternal. >>. According to advaita,
creation is  no doubt eternal, but is subject to vikara ( modification )
including creation, sustenance and dissolution. In between dissolution and
creation, it is in potential/seed / unmanifest form. This is the difference
from the views of Mimasakas who hold that Creation is eternal without
dissolution or creation.


<< When self-realization puts end to birth in the samsara, and when
self-realization is the final goal of all beings, it is just a matter of
time when this would happen to all. What is sure is that all would
eventually experience it, and thus there is no birth. When all beings have
self-realization eventually, then, where is the need for creation. But
Bhagawad Gita 13/20 says both are eternal. My question is what fuels the
eternal continuity of creation despite self-realization? I am sure, this
topic might have been discussed in the past but I might have missed
it. Please pardon me for asking it again. >>. In the concept of infinity,
when a finite part is removed from infinity , balance remaining continues
to be infinity only. The process can be repeated any number of times,
balance remaining is always infinity. Jivas being infinite, the possibility
envisaged above is not valid.
