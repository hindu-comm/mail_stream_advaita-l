 What exactly is the difference as far as “ anaditva “ is concerned. Please
clarify. The only difference is that avidya is subject to sa-vikara,
 sa-avayava, sa-anta ( in parts ) etc. Otherwise in so far as anaditva is
concerned, I thought there was no difference from the “ anaditva”  of
Brahman . Though avidya is considered to be sa-anta , because it is
destroyed on the rising of jnana, still it is only in respect of the
particular jiva only. In the macro sense, it continues and is ananta also
from that perspective. When it is remembered that it is the Shakti of
Brahman, it automatically means it also is anadi and anata just as Brahman
, but again with modification etc.

This really needs elaboration. We are dealing with the situation as obtains
in the vyavaharika plane. At this level surely selfrealization does indeed
take place at specific times to specific people. How can it be held to be
otherwise ? I am not clear. Please clarify.
