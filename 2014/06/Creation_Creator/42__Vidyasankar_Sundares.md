I presume you are referring to the verse
प्रकृतिं पुरुषं चैव विद्ध्यनादी उभावपि ।विकारांश्च गुणांश्चैव विद्धि प्रकृतिसंभवान् ॥

You have to clarify what you mean by the word eternal, in your question. Please note that avidyA is also constantly said to be anAdi in vedAnta discourse. Obviously, this is never meant in the same sense as saying that brahman is anAdi.
What fuels creation despite self-realization by an individual human being? If you take the verse above in the entire context of the 13th chapter, the answer is obvious. It is ISvara, the जगदुत्पत्तिस्थितिप्रलयहेतुः. "When all beings have self-realization eventually" is a hypothetical situation that views self-realization(s) as multiple events of a particular experience, that happens within the arrow of time. This is actually a false construction, because self-realization is really not an experience, nor an event in time for anybody anywhere, although it appears to happen at specific instances of time to specific people. That is the whole point of all advaita vedAnta teaching.
Best regards,Vidyasankar

> I would like to know from Advaita perspective if creation is also eternal. We all know that Creator is eternal, but how about creation? Bhagawad Gita 13/20 says both are eternal.

> When self-realization puts end to birth in the samsara, and when self-realization is the final goal of all beings, it is just a matter of time when this would happen to all. What is sure is that all would eventually experience it, and thus there is no birth. When all beings have self-realization eventually, then, where is the need for creation. But Bhagawad Gita 13/20 says both are eternal. My question is what fuels the eternal continuity of creation despite self-realization? I am sure, this topic might have been discussed in the past but I might have missed it. Please pardon me for asking it again.
