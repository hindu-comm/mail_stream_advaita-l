Namaste,

I have not read all the replies (my apologies), but in response to OPs
question that creation is eternal and without beginning, what about al
those verses including nAsadiya sUkta which says that initially there was
only one brahman.

bhagavAn in gItAs 10.8 says '10.8 I am the origin of all". What does this
imply?

Also theories of creation, preservation and destruction is said only for
vayahArika POV. In absolute POV, from advaita POV, there is no creation, no
duality and there can be no teaching as well. SSS says that acceptance of
reality of this world is there to help one class of students.

Each type of statement is there for a particular class of seekers. LAter
upon gaining maturity and inner purity, statements change. That which was
real is not real anymore.

What is considered as eternal like jiva, creation is not experienced in
nirvikalp samadhi.

I like Shiva Gita. It explains everything clearly including destruction of
jIva, nonduality. Importantly it is not commented by supporters of just
personal god. I have heard that Sripad Pandit Aradhya (1060) of
ViraShaivism had commented on Shiva Gita and considered it to be an essence
of vedanta.
