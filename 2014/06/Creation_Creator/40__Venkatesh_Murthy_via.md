Namaste

Why do you worry about Others self realization? Think only of your self
realization. Because if you realize you will see there is no other. This is
Advaita Stithi. The Creation will be there till you realize. Then it will
vanish. There is no Creator and no Creartion. You are Alone. You are That.
