That is just a term to distinguish it from the nityatva of Atman - brahman, after denying the reality of pariNAma in brahman.

A samAdhi experience at a particular time and place happens to the mind that enters samAdhi at that particular time and place. This serves as a window/mirror for the jIva to cease the adhyAsa of anAtman on itself (Atman), or at least to loosen the bondage of this adhyAsa if not cease it altogether. Nothing really happens to the jIva. In reality, the question of "not to other jIva-s" does not arise. 
To say, even only as a matter of speech, that samAdhi happens to one jIvAtman and not to other jIvAtman-s, is itself an instance of adhyAsa of the manas/citta onto the jIva, whereas mano-buddhy-ahaMkAra-cittAni nAham.
I will leave the rest unsaid.
