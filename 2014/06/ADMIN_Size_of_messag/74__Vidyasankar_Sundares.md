To all members of Advaita-L:

Before sending a message to the list, please keep an eye out for the size of your mail message. The list software holds back any message that is larger than 50 kilobytes and in the last week, we have gone in and approved more than one message that has been somewhere between 70-80 kB in size. 

In general, if one needs to scroll down through more than four or five screens to read your mail, that is getting to be too big, and you are losing the attention and time availability for the reader. Please split up your posts into two or more posts if this happens.

Best regards,
Vidyasankar
