The problem is that yuktidipika itself quotes Bhartrhari.  While it is not 
unknown for an author to refer to his other works why would he do it in 
the third person.  And anyway the context in which Bhartrhari is quoted 
has nothing to do with the the three rajavarttika shlokas.  Also there is 
the fact that the yuktidipika does not meet the dictionary definition of a 
varttika.  This is not a clincher because sometimes near-synonms are used 
lightly in Sanskrit.  However it claims in its introduction that the 
samkhyakarikAs are a comprehensive statement of samkhyashastra not merely 
a prakarana making YD a bhashya.  And it does meet the definition of a 
bhashya.  Some scholars have suggested that perhaps the rAjavarttikA in 
whole or part is embedded within the YD in the way that Katyayanas 
varttikA on vyAkaraNa is embedded within the mahAbhAshya but this is 
conjecture and also doesn't establish any link with Bhartrahari.
