Dear friends,


Raja Bhartrhari is known to be the 
great scholar who wrote the Vakyapadiya as a treatise on the Sphotavada 
and he is the acknowledged authority on the grammar of philosophy and he is also believed by many to be the author of a Vartika on the 
Sankhyakarika, the authoritative text on the Sankhya philosophy. Such 
being the possibility, has any scholar come to know of any studies 
carried out so far, which throw light on the great Monist Raja 
Bhartrhari's appying the principles of Sphotavada in his Vartika of the 
Sankhyakarika ? 


Regards,
Sunil KB
