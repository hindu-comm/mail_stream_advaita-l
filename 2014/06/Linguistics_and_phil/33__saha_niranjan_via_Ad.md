Dear Bhattacharjyaji,

You may ask my friend James Kimball (jaskimball at hotmail.com) off list if he has come accross anything like that, as he has done his PhD on Yuktidipika at SOAS.

Sincrely,
Niranjan Saha

Dear friends,

Kindly permit me to elaborate my previous mail.

It is the belief of some (including me as well)
that Raja Bhartrihari, who wrote the Vakyapadiya, the treatise on the
Sphotavada, is also the writer of the Yuktidipika, which also
indicates that its author is a raja (king). It is known that Raja
Bhartrihari gave up the throne in his prime of his youth to became an
ascetic and his brother Vikramaditya succeeded him. Vacaspati Mishra
includes two verses from the text of the Yuktidipika in his
Tattvakaumudi, the commentary on the Sankhyakarika, and he calls
that text as the Raja-Vartika. Thus, in short, the Vakyapadiya and
the Yuktidipika could have been written by the same person,
Bhartrihari. 


What I am looking for is whether any studies have been carried out to see the application of the Sphotavada in the Yuktidipika.

Regards,
Sunil KB

Dear friends,


Raja Bhartrhari is known to be the 
great scholar who wrote the Vakyapadiya as a treatise on the Sphotavada 
and he is the acknowledged authority on the grammar of philosophy and he is also believed by many to be the author of a Vartika on the 
Sankhyakarika, the authoritative text on the Sankhya philosophy. Such 
being the possibility, has any scholar come to know of any studies 
carried out so far, which throw light on the great Monist Raja 
Bhartrhari's appying the principles of Sphotavada in his Vartika of the 
Sankhyakarika ?

Sunil KB
