Namaste.
We consider Sri. Shankara asan Avatara of the Lord. Just like we celebrate Krishna Jayanthi, Narasimha Jayanthi etc. we celebrateShankara Jayanthi too, remebering Him through His teachings, irrespective of the Ashrama He belonged to.

The Aradhana thithi of Shankaracharya as a sanyasi , is not important to us now as it is a custom followed only for the 3 previous paramparas (Parama Guru, Parameshti Guru andParapara Guru ) if I am right in saying so.

I had been fortunate to see the Aradhana of Vrudhha Narasimha Bharathi MahaSwamigal performed by Sri Abhinava Vidya Theertha Mahaswamigal at Sringeri a long time ago. 

Regards,
sumitha
