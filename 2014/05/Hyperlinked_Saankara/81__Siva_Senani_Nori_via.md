I just came to know of a project by the Sringeri Matha (Shankara Bhashya), which has interlinked the prasthanatraya bhashya. I remember Sri Vidyasankar Sundaresean mooting the exact same project with the IT wing of Sringeri Matha, sometime back. Whatever be the motivation behind this, this is a great blessing by the Matha.

 Shankara Bhashya
