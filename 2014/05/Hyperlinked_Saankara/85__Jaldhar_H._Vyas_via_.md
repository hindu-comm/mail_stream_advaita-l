I agree.  Congratulations to all involved for this wonderful effort.  I 
only wish it were possible to link to specific pages from the outside and 
view them without registration.  This would greatly enhance discussion on 
this list and and any other place on the Internet where Shankaracharyas 
thought is discussed.  By hyperlinking with other sites, pages from 
Advaita Sharada could rise to their rightful place at the top of any 
google search on Advaita Vedanta topics.  Hopefully this is already being 
considered for a later stage of the project.
