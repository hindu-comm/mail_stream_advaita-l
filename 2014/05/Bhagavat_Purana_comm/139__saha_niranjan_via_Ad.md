Namaste!

Besides, there is another edition too in Bengali script, which has MS's comments on the first three shlokas of the BhAgavata PurANa (Srimadbhagavatadyaslokatrayasya tika Srimanmadhusudanasarsvatikrita, ed. Sriyuktakrishnagopalabhakta, 1815 Shakabda, Kalikata: Sriyuktaramaramanabhakta--- a copy of which is available in the National Library, Kolkata).

Sincerely,
Niranjan Saha
