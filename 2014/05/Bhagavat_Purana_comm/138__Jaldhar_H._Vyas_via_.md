He has not commented on the entire Bhagavata Purana though he often quotes 
from it in his other works.

paramahaMsaprIya is a commentary on the first shloka.  You can find it 
here: https://archive.org/details/paramahaMsapriyA

There is also supposed to be a Vedastuti (from 10th skandha) tika but I 
haven't seen it i print yet.
