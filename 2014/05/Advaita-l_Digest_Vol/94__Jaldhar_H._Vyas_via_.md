I can't read Tamil but apparently this person thinks "Pure Advaita" only 
started in the 19th century.  Like many of these modern gurus he seems to 
basically be an atheist who dresses his atheism in Sanskrit pyjamas.

His grasp of what Shankaracharya actually taught seems very shallow 
indeed.  Even discounting the authenticity of the stotras, his view on 
Bhakti is abundantly clear when you look at his bhashya on the 
chaturvyuhAdhikaraNa of the brahmasUtra. (2.2.44-45)  A translation of 
the relevant part is available here:
