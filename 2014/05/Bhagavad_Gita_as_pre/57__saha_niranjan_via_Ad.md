Pranams, Sujalji.

Pls see if you could find and let me know about that Sanskrit commentary by Anand Bodhendra Saraswati, as nothing gives pleasure to the reader if the original is found.

Best rgs,
N.Saha

Pranams Sri Niranjan ji,

I do not have access to Sanskrit commentary by Anand Bodhendra Saraswati.

Pranams Srirudra ji,

I agree with Sadananada ji.

Advaitin will enjoy YV. If you consider Vidyaranya Swami as authentic, then
there is no question of fact finding.


OM

Sujal
