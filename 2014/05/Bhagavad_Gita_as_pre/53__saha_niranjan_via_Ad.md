Dear Sujalji and Sunilji,
Pranam!


I've palced an order for a copy of K.N.Subramanian's book at samatabooks at gmail.com, for S.K.Bhattacharya's book at order at parimalpublication.com, and for Swami Veda Bharati's book at indology at dkprintworld.com.

But pls let me know where to get the original Sanskrit version of the commentary by Swami Anand
Bodhendra Saraswati.

Sincerely,
N.Saha

This book contains

1. Intro
2. Yoga vasistha in short (A lyrical Metaphysical Epic)
3. Paraphrase of Arjunopakhyana
4. English translation along with commentary. No sanskrit test. Divided in
six chapters
5. Appendix 1 - Contains similar verses related to bhagavad Gita of
Mahabharata.
6. Appendix 2 - similar verses from different
 manuscript

Personal opinion is that you should buy both books, you may want to double
check the translation done by K.N.Subramanaian.
