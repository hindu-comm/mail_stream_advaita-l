Namaste,

The upanishad is highlighting a somewhat well known fact:
- one who engages in practice (alone) of any science/ art sooner or later encounters limitations, ridicule, failures
- one who engages in theory (alone) of any science/ art sooner or later encounters severe limitations, ridicule, failures
- wisdom lies in simultaneously devoting oneself to both theory and practice of the art/ science
- by practice one overcomes the devil who hides in the details
- by theory one is able to realize and manifest the true potential of the science/ art.

Hari Om

Regards,
Shrinivas
