Namaste

I think there is a connection between this Ishaavaasya Mantra 9 and
Bhagavad Gita 2 - 11. Do you see it?
From Advaita Sharada site.
अशोच्यानन्वसोच्स्त्वं प्रज्ञावादांश्च भाषसे ।
गतासूनगतासूंश्च नानुशोचन्ति पण्डिताः ॥ ११ ॥
Sankara Bhashya
अशोच्यान् इत्यादि । न शोच्या अशोच्याः भीष्मद्रोणादयः, सद्वृत्तत्वात्
परमार्थस्वरूपेण च नित्यत्वात्, तान् अशोच्यान् अन्वशोचः अनुशोचितवानसि ‘ते
म्रियन्ते मन्निमित्तम्, अहं तैर्विनाभूतः किं करिष्यामि राज्यसुखादिना’ इति ।
त्वं प्रज्ञावादान् प्रज्ञावतां बुद्धिमतां वादांश्च वचनानि च भाषसे तदेतत्
मौढ्यं पाण्डित्यं च विरुद्धम् आत्मनि दर्शयसि उन्मत्त इव इत्यभिप्रायः ।
यस्मात् गतासून् गतप्राणान् मृतान्, अगतासून् अगतप्राणान् जीवतश्च न
अनुशोचन्ति पण्डिताः आत्मज्ञाः । पण्डा आत्मविषया बुद्धिः येषां ते हि
पण्डिताः, ‘पाण्डित्यं निर्विद्य’ (बृ. उ.
३-५-१)<http://advaitasharada.sringeri.net/php/format.php?bhashya=Brha&page=03#BR_C03_S05_V01>इति
श्रुतेः । परमार्थतस्तु तान् नित्यान् अशोच्यान् अनुशोचसि, अतो मूढोऽसि
इत्यभिप्रायः ॥

Arjuna is talking like a Pandita but he is not behaving like a Pandita.
There is a contradiction between his words and behaviour. In Ishaavaasya
also it is saying the wrong understanding is worse than having no
understanding. If some person has no knowledge about something he can be
taught. But a person with wrong understanding cannot be taught easily. He
has give up wrong understanding first. It will take longer time for him.
