If you read the bhāṣya portion just preceding the above quoted one, it will
be seen:

This mantra is to criticize the karma and upasana done without conjoining
(smucchaya) them.  For karma and contemplation together alone is conducive
to Self-knowledge and not otherwise.  So, with a view to enjoing samucchaya
the Upanishad is taking the course of criticizing the karma and upasana
done without samucchaya.

This samucchaya is not the one Shankara has criticized elsewhere.  That
samucchaya is the conjoining of atma jnana with karma which some vAdins
think is enjoined by the Veda for moksha.  Shankara has shown that such
samucchaya is impossible for the self knowledge is characterized by
akartRtva jnana and karma is characterized by kriyā, kāraka, phala, kartā
etc. duality/bheda jnana.  This bheda jnana cannot co-exist with
abheda/akartṛtva jnana, says Shankara.

I just added the above paragraph only to avoid readers bringing up the
samucchaya that Shankara has criticized.  In the particular Isha mantra,
the special type of samucchaya is required and to emphasize this, the
mantra is criticizing the practice of vihita karma to the exclusion of
upasana.  The  idea is; karma is for chitta shuddhi and upasana is for
chittaigrAtA.  Both these are essential for self-knowledge to take roots in
the sādhaka.
