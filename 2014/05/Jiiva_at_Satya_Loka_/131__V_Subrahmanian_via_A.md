In the commentary to the BSB for the very last sutra, the Ratnaprabhā
clarifies:

For those who have gone to brahmaloka after performing panchāgnividyā,
ashvamedha, firm brahmacharyā, etc. non-return from that loka is not
guaranteed since they cannot be said to certainly attain nirguṇa
brahmavidyā in brahmaloka.

On the other hand, for those who have reached brahmaloka by performing
īśwaropāsana like daharavidyā, since they can get brahmavidyā there,
non-return to samsāra is certain.

This can be seen in the above commentary.
