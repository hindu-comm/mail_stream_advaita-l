Namaskaram. 

With reference to the above,I am writing the following, based on my memory of what I have
read before.

While it is true that the jiva at satya
loka will be exposed to the teaching of Maha Vaakya to gain mokha, Brahma
sutras (4th part) says 'No Return' for such jiiva- meaning that it will never
return to karma bhuumi despite no self experience; rather such jiva will stay
at satya loka until it experiences its real self. If pralaya takes place prior
to self experience, then the jiiva will be at satya loka at the time of
creation, and will continue its effort to realize its true nature.

Namaskaram
Ramesh
