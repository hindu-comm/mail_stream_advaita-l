Of course a critique is possible.  What do you think e.g. Ramanuja or 
Madhva did?  Or contemporary Indologists for that matter?  No, the problem 
is that there are established facts which will prove rather inconvenient 
to your hoped for conclusions am I right?

It is fashionable of late to bemoan the sinister influence of "Macauley" 
and other foreign characters who have allegedly foisted their alien ways 
upon us but the sad truth is the biggest distorters and know-nothings of 
Hinduisms doctrines and history are Hindus themselves.
