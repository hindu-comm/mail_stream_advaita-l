Umm no it isn't.  You are already off to a rocky start!

First of all, "Pure Advaita" is meaningless because Advaita is an 
adjective.  It would be like opining about "pure blue" or "pure tall." 
Blue what or tall what?"  In this case the noun that Advaita qualifies is 
Vedanta.  If you wish to claim that the present day sadhana is not 
properly founded on Vedanta or even that it should not be founded upon 
Vedanta then state your case but be prepared to back it up with facts and 
logic.

100% free discussions would lead to chaos as everyone has their own 
opinions and assumptions.  For this reason we are trying to keep the focus 
on the historical tradition of Shankaracharya and his successors.  There 
is some leeway but not an infinite amount.
