This is with reference to Shri Ram Kumar Krishnan (ராம குமரன்)'s message
regarding Pure Advaita as discussed in Jeyamohan's (Tamil) blogs. As a
person who has made some sincere efforts to understand Shankara's advaita,
I am in agreement with much of what Shri Jeyamohan says. But such views may
not be agreeable to the established advaitin scholars because the present
day brand of advaita practice is mostly "Dwaita" viewpoint packaged in
advaita packages.

If the moderator is willing to allow free discusiions I will try to put
foreward what little I have been able to understand about pure advaita.
