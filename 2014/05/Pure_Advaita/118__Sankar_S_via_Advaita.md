With reference to Shri Jaladhar H. Vyas' posting of 22nd. instant, I feel
it will be impossible to consider any kind of discussion on
improvement/modification to Shankara's Advaita, if it is necessary to keep
within the boundaries of Vedanta; secondly such discussions will obviously
not be focussed on the historical traditions of Shankaracharya and his
successors.

Hence, if Shri Ram Kumar Krishnan (ராம குமரன்) is interested, he may write
to me at my e-mail id (sangom at gmail.com). I have already written to Shri
Ramesam Vemuri along the same lines, please.

Sankar
