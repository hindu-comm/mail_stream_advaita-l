*Sanskrit is not merely a language, but a store house of  knowledge and
wisdom. One interested in knowledge, therefore, cannot afford to
ignore Sanskrit.*
     *The Aim of the Course*
To familiarize with the basic structure of the language in such a way that
a learner understands the syntactic structure of Sanskrit language with
ease, can prepare prose-order of a Sanskrit verse and can grasp the methods
to develop reading, writing, comprehending and speaking skills, ultimately
of course, to enable one to handle the original Sanskrit Texts.
    *Course Structure*
There will be five graded levels of the course to begin with. Each level
will have two components:
a. Theory based on Paninian Model and
b. Practice in speaking Sanskrit.

*Who can join this course ?*
Any one interested in Indian intellectual, philosophical and spiritual
culture can join.

*Faculty*
Prof. V. N. Jha (Former Director, CAAS, University of Pune)
Dr. Easwaran E. N. (Sanskrit Bharati, Kodungallur, Kerala)
