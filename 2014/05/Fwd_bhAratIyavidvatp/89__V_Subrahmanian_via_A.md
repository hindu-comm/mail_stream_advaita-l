Advaita Sharada Project

Over a century ago, the 33rd Jagadguru of Sringeri, Sri Sacchidananda
Shivabhinava Narasimha Bharati Mahaswamiji led the first ever compilation
of the complete works of Sri Adi Shankaracharya -- Sri Shaankara
Granthavali. In keeping with this tradition and sensitive to our technology
age, the presiding Shankaracharya of the Dakshinamnaya Sri Sharada Peetham,
Jagadguru Shankaracharya Sri Sri Bharati Tirtha Mahaswamiji is blessing and
guiding the Advaita Sharada Project.

*The goal of the Advaita Sharada project is to make available our ancient
Shastric texts (in particular Vedantic texts) for access via the Internet
and other computer-based devices like tablets and smartphones. Leveraging
audio, video, commentaries, sub-commentaries, notes, tags and hyperlinks,
we hope to provide a platform for in-depth research and additional learning
for seekers, scholars and students. We also plan to create a learning
platform to introduce the Upanishadic philosophy of Advaita for beginners
and early aspirants.*

Invoking the blessings of Goddess Sharada (the presiding deity of Sringeri
Sharada Peetham) and reflecting the Upanishadic teachings as expounded by
Jagadguru Sri Adi Shankaracharya, the project has been named "Advaita
Sharada".

First offering: Shankara Prasthanatraya
Bhashya<http://advaitasharada.sringeri.net/php/prasthanatraya.php>

T*he first offering of Advaita Sharada is a text searchable, extensively
hyperlinked Intenet edition of the Sri Shaankara Granthavali, published by
the Vani Vilasa Press, Srirangam. This is a result of a collaborative
effort between Sri Shankara Advaita Research Centre, Sringeri, andSriranga
Digital Software Technoloiges, Srirangapatna.*

The source text in Unicode was provided by The Sringeri Math at Srirangam; it
is scrutinised and proofread at the Sri Shankara Advaita Research Centre,
Sringeri. The XML markup scheme and the technology framework for the
Internet edition was developed by Sriranga Digital Software Technologies,
Srirangapatna. This Internet edition was released on Shankara Jayanti - the
Vaishakha Shukla Panchami day of the Jaya Samvatsara - 4th May 2014 by
Jagadguru
Shankaracharya Sri Sri Bharati Tirtha Mahaswamiji

In forthcoming releases, we will introduce multimedia, commentaries,
sub-commentaries and tags for these Bhasyas. We invite you to register and
view this first
release.<http://advaitasharada.sringeri.net/php/prasthanatraya.php>
