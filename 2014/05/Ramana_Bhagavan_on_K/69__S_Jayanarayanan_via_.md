I just happened to search "Talks with Ramana Maharshi" on Bhagavanmentioning Krishna, and was surprised to find the incident of Krishna reviving Parikshit indirectly referred to as a "siddhi",along with an exhortation not to judge a Jnani by his conduct! Here it is:


------------------
Talk 449.


Sri Bhagavan now warned the hearers against the mistake of disparaging
a Jnani for his apparent conduct and again cited the story of Parikshit.
He was a still-born child. The ladies cried and appealed to Sri Krishna
to save the child. The sages round about wondered how Krishna was
going to save the child from the effects of the arrows (apandavastra)
of Asvatthama. Krishna said, “If the child be touched by one eternally
celibate (nityabrahmachari) the child would be brought to life.” Even
Suka dared not touch the child. Finding no one among the reputed saints
bold enough to touch the child, Krishna went and touched it, saying, “If
I am eternally celibate (nityabrahmachari) may the child be brought to
life.” The child began to breathe and later grew up to be Parikshit.
Just consider how Krishna surrounded by 16,000 gopis is a
brahmachari! Such is the mystery of jivanmukti! A jivanmukta is
one who does not see anything separate from the Self.
If however a man consciously attempts to display siddhis he will
receive only kicks.
