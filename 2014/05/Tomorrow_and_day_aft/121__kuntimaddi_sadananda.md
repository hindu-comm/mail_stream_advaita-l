PraNAms to all

Just a reminder, as announced before, we are going to have a two-day camp on the Madhu kanda (1st and 2nd ch. of Bri. Up) taking important mantras that deal with Vedanta only leaving out the upaasana parts. 

For those who cannot attend and want to listen to the talks - they will be broadcasted on Livestream and one can access them at <www.livestream.com/advaita_sadaji>. The first session will be from 9:30 AM to 10:30AM EST. The talks, however, will be stored at the website for later listening also at one's convenience. 

Hari Om!
Sadananda
