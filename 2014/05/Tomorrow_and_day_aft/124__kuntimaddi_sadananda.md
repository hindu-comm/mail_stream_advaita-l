 OM
 UpAsana is the means to transform the mind to a
 status for understanding the vastu.
--------------------------------------

Yes swamiji - and the camp is for those who have some knowledge of the Vedanta and therefore have prepared their mind enough to listen to the teaching. Otherwise they will be restless to sit through for the whole day for two days.

I understand what Jaldharji is saying. I am not doing any service or disservice but enjoying whatever the Lord has provided an opportunity to cater to those who want to listen to the teaching at the venue. 

I am sure if He wants he will provide another opportunity for the upaasana part. 

Hari Om!
Sadananda
