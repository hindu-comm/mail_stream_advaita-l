This is rather ironic given our recent discussion.  May we conclude that 
those who go to two-day Vedanta camps fall into greater darkness than 
those who do not go to Vedanta camp at all?  ;-)

The brhadaranyakaopanishad is as its name suggests both the aranyaka and 
upanishad of shuklayajurveda.  Shankaracharya deals with all of it.  The 
brahmasutras deal with all of it.  The idea that "vedanta" and "upasana" 
are two separate things is the same old "pure advaita" fallacy again.  You 
are doing your students a disservice by not informing them of this.
