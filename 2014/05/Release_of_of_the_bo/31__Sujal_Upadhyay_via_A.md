Namaste Sunil ji,

Congrats and my best wishes.

Mahamandaleshwar Swami Ved Bharti says that two recessions of Bhagavad Gita
exists.

1. Found in Mahabharata upon which Adi Shankaracharya and others have
written commentaries.
2. Kashmiri Recession upon which Abhinavagupta and rAmakaNTha have written
commentary. This version contains many additional verses says Swami ji

Swami Ved Bharti is disciple of Swami Rama of Himalayas. He has translated
YV-BhG (Yoga Vasista Bhagavad Gita) with tatparya prakasha, a commentary by
Anand Bodhendra Saraswati

Ref: Page 50

Bhagavad Gita found in Yoga Vasistha is called as arjunopAkhyAna, but Swami
Ananda Bodhendra Saraswati in his commentary 'tAtparya prakASa' calls it
YV-BhG (Yoga VAsistha Bhagavad Gita)

Kind Regards

Sujal
