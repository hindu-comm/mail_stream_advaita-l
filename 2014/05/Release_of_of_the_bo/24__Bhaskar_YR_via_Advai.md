Nice to know that prabhuji.  Wish you grand success prabhuji.  we would be 
highly obliged if you could tell us how you could able to find the 
'missing' verses from the original geeta...and why these missing verses 
have not come to the notice of even our traditional aacharyaa's like 
bhagavatpaada, ramAnuja, madhva etc.  And also kindly let us know whether 
these newly found verses conveying any special teaching apart from what is 
already available in the prevalent geeta. 

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
