 Dear Bhashkarji,

 The fact that the Original
 Bhagavad Gita has 745 verses has been mentioned in the
 Gitamana verse in the Mahabharata itself. According to the
 Gitamana verse 620 verses are attributed to Lord Krishna.
 The presently available version has only 575 verses of Lord
 Krishna. Forty five verses of Lord Krishna are missing from
 the presently available version of the Bhagavad Gita. There
 are internal evidences also, which show that certain
 verses were present in the Original version. All these have
 been discussed in detail in the book. For example, any keen
 reader must have observed that the Lord says tin the
 Bhagavad Gita that he would speak about the Parampada but in
 the version with 700 verses ,what Lord said on the Parampada
 is missing. There are quite a few such pointers in the
 Bhagavad gita, which the scholars seem to have ignored.

 One cannot say that the Great
 Adi Shankaracharya did not know about this fact. In fact
 the complete version with 745 verses was treated as an
 esoteric version and its circulation was confined to close
 circles which must have included the past Shankaracharyas.
 Adi Shankaracharya spoke about the difficulty the earlier
 commentators had in explaining certain seemingly conflicting
 verses and it is quite possible that he wanted to popularize
 the Bhagavad Gita with the verses which would be suitable
 for common consumption. It is also possible that the early
 acharyas of the Vishistadvaita abd Dvaita schools did not
 have access to the version with 745 verses and they devoted
 their time and energy only to contest Adi
 Shankaracharya's explanations. However there are
 evidences that some later scholars of the Ramanuja school
 was aware of some of he rare verses.

 Regards,
 Sunil KB

 Kindly let me know
 how I may get a hard copy of this book. I heard a couple of
 times about missing verses but glad some one had it. You
 mean this version of gita has more slokas than Jnaneshwari
 or Shankar Bhashyam.
 
 Thanks and Regards

 you that the book "The Original Bhagavad Gita" of
 745 verses (including the rare verses, in conformity with
 the Gitamana verse of the Mahabharata), with translation and
 commentary by me will be released in Delhi on the 19th May,
 2014, under the auspices of WAVES. This book also has a
 lengthy introduction dealing with several nagging issues
 connected with the Bhagavad Gita, which baffled a number of
 modern scholars and many of them began to doubt even the
 length of Vulgate version of 700 verses..The invite for the
 same is attached.

 remarkable Indian scientists who not only keep personally
 close to their religious heritage but also become religious
 scholars after their retirement from their worldly
 profession. As he writes in his Foreword(Preface)he
 spent several decades in researching and writing of this
 volume. His ambition had been to restore a number of lost
 verses to the Bhagavad gita and to publish the Original
 Bhagavad Gita in 745 verses, instead of the customary 700.
 The lengthy introduction goes into the literary history of
 the Mahabharata and the vicissitudes of the Bhagavad Gita.

 concerning the length of the original Gita. In the process
 he also reviews the opinion of a number of recognized
 scholars, who have dealt with this issue. He also answers
 questions like "How could the discourse on the Bhagavad

 to study these in particular. Occasionally the author has
 inserted some commentaries of his own, helping the
 uninitiated to understand the difficultportions of the
