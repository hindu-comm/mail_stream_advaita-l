Namaste

I am giving the brief points for Adi Sankara Pooja. Like in Deva Pooja we
have to do preliminaries and Avaahana and offer Dhyana, Aavaahana, Asana,
Paadya, Arghya and Achamaneeya Upachaaras. Then we offer Pachamruta Snaana
with Suddhodaka Snaana with Sadyo Jaataadi Mantras. Then we have to do
Rudra Abhisheka with Namaka and Chamaka, Purusha Sukta and others if time
permits.

Then we offer Vastra, Gandha,Vibhooti or Bhasma, Rudraaksha, Bilva Patra,
Other Patra Pooja, Pushpa Pooja. Then do Ashtottara Naama Pooja with
flowers or Bilva Patra if possible. Then do Dhoopa, Deepa and Naivedya.
Then offer Coconut - Nari Kela also. You can say any Stotras if time
permits. Then do Mangala Neeraajana Aarati, Pradakshina Namaskaara, and do
Mantra Pushpa. Do a small Praarhana for Adi Sankara. Rest is like Deva
Pooja.

Learned and practicing members can point out gaps and mistakes if any.
