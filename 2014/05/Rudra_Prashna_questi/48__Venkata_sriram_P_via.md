Namaste,

There is atraditional method followed in sringeri. The softcopy of the same can be downloaded from the link given below. This was compiled by Sri.Harsha.

Thispaddhati was earlier followed by Asthana Vidvan of Sringeri Mahamahopadhyaya Br.Sri.KP Shankara Sastrigal. This is a very traditional method of worship. Generally, whenever, any yati / sanyasi is worshipped, upanishad pArAyaNa should be performed at the end.
