Dear Vidyasankar,

(pramAda pATha).


Let's restrict the discussion to "good renderings". A mantra, with a single
mantra draShTA, may be present in several shakhas. In some cases, there are
minor changes in the text. In some cases, there are minor changes in
swaras. In some cases, though the text is the same, the pratishakhya
results in different renderings.

The most straightforward explanation is that a single "original" mantra
underwent change over time.

sasneham,
