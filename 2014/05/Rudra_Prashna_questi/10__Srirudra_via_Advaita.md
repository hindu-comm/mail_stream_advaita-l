In the Rudhram the rig Manthra - ohm namo.........mruthyurme pahi is to be understood as addressed to Sri Rudra who as Vishnu ensure that mruthyu protects me.That is to say the reciter is praying for longevity through Sri Rudra who will order mruthyu to protect the devotee from akala mruthyu.Also the Manthra speaks of Sri Rudra as prananam granthi.Sri Rudhra is in the junction of the soul and the senses.SriRudra is the supreme deity whose command will not be disobeyed by other devathas.R.Krishnamoorthy.
