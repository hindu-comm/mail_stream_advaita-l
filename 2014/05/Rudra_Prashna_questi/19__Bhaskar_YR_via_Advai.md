Tryamabakam Mantra is not at all part of Namaka but I think it was added
later.

praNAms
Hare Krishna

AFAIK, trayambakaM is part of the saMhita maNtra whereas in namaka 
'namaste astu bhagavan vishveshwarAya and yO rudrO agnau yO apsuya 
Oshadheeshu  ityAdi which we usually chant with namaka are not saMhita 
maNtra-s.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
