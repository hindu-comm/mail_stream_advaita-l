Namaste

That is not correct. Because if I am praying to Death itself the words will
be Mrutyo Me Paahi, not Mrutyur Me Paahi. Mrutyo is the Sambodhanaa for
Mrutyu.

If you look at another very near mantra Tryambakam Yajaamahe you will see
it is saying Mrutyor Muksheeya. Liberate me from Death.

According to that Mantra also the grammatical form should be Om Namo
Bhagavate Rudraaya Vishnave Mrutyor Me Paahi.
