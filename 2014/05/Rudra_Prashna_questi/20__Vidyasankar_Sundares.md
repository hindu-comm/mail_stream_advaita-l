>Tryamabakam Mantra is not at all part of Namaka but I think it was added later. 

That is quite besides the point, when talking about the basic rule that one should not expect every sentence in the veda to conform exactly to the rules of classical Samskrta grammar.

The namaka portion ends with the words ... taM vo jambhe dadhAmi. Everything that is typically chanted after this and before the camaka consists of selections from Rg and yajur vedas.
