Namaste

To the question on 'previously done shravaNAdi not giving the fruit of
liberating knowledge in that janma but in a subsequent janma' we have the
Brahmasutra 3.4.51 'aihikamapi.....' The Acharya gives the example of
Vamadeva who is admitted to have got the liberating knowledge while in the
womb.  While it is impossible for anyone to do shravana, etc. in a womb, it
is agreed that he must have done all that in earlier lives but the karma
that obstructed the rise of knowledge ended only in this life, while he was
in the womb.

Even in the case of Vidura, etc. it is admitted that he was a jnani right
from birth itself implying that this birth was necessary for the
fructifying of the shravaNAdi sAdhana performed in earlier lives.  So,
without any teacher one could get knowledge if the preparations have been
done in earlier lives.  The case of Sri Ramana maharshi also could be
considered.
