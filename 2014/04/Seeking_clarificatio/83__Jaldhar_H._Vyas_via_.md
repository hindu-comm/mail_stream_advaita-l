Could be but I don't see why it _must_ suggest that.

Well, what Sanskrit word would you use to translate "Realization"?  It 
seems to me jnana covers it well.  You are of course perfectly right that 
the "knowledge" or "realization" of Nirguna Brahman is objectless.  That 
is why I think shruti emphasizes the aloneness of Viraj.  He comes to this 
whatever-it-is :)  naturally when there is no one or nothing else to teach 
it because it is the inescapable conclusion when all dualities have been 
negated.
