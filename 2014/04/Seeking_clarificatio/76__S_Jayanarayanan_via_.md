There are two different points to be noted:

1) A Jnani's body may continue to perform Karma as seen by others, but the Jnani himself does not attach himself to any Karma.
2) A Jnani may have attained infirm Jnana, and he/she needs to practice further the elimination of Vasanas to attain firmness in Jnana.

Certainly, Ramana taught that both points are true. Here's a quote from "Talks" concerning the second case:

Talks with Ramana Maharshi, # 562
---------------------------------

 21st October, 1938
 There is a statement in the book Vichara Sangraha that though a 
 person realises the Self once, he cannot, for that simple reason 
 alone, become a mukta. He continues to remain a victim of vasanas 
 (latencies). Sri Bhagavan was asked whether the realisation referred 
 to was the same as the jnani's, and if so why there should be a 
 difference in their effects.
 M.: The experience is the same. Every person experiences the Self 
 consciously or unconsciously. The ajnani's experience is clouded by
 his latencies whereas the jnani's is not so. The jnani's experience
 of the Self is therefore distinct and permanent. A practiser may by
 long practice gain a glimpse of the Reality. This experience may be
 vivid for the time being. And yet he will be distracted by the old 
 vasanas and so his experience will not avail him. Such a man must 
 continue his manana and nididhyasana so that all the obstacles may 
 be destroyed. He will then be able to remain permanently in the Real 
 State.
 D.: What is the difference between a man who makes no attempts and 
 remains an ajnani, and another who gains a glimpse and returns to 
 ajnana?
 M.: In the latter case a stimulus is always present to goad him on 
 to further efforts until the realisation is perfect.
 D.: The Srutis say: Sakrit vibhatoyam brahmaloka (This knowledge of
 Brahman shines forth once and forever).
 (Note: Above quote is from Chandogya 8.4.2)
 M.: They refer to the permanent realisation and not to the glimpse.
 D.: How is it possible that a man forgets his very experience and 
 falls back into ignorance?
 Sri Bhagavan illustrated it with the following story: ...
