Here is my take on this interesting question.

Viraj was in his purvajanma the foremost of the upasakas -- those who 
meditate on Brahman as saguna.  Thus his jnana was also saguna and 
therefore he continued as an entity in the world of gunas.

Yes the problem is not that he doesn't have knowledge of unity but unity 
with what.  "Unity" can occur on many levels.  "Fear" also exists on many 
levels.  As you noted, the upanishad itself continues by describing the 
unity of man and wife  as an antidote to the existential fear of living 
alone in the world.

A child may fear there is a monster under his bed.  His parents may think 
it is silly but be consumed with fear concerning mortgage, job etc.  This 
in turn may not be scary to one who has renounced material things and so 
on.  The saguna jnani has conquered all fears in the world as he 
understands it but now his perspective has changed so a new fear arises 
which would previously not been considered.

The ultimate knowledge is of Brahman as nirguna only.  Does that mean 
there is a hierarchy of jnanas?  Is saguna jnana then worthless. 
Shankaracharya addresses this when he talks about sight being 
different amongst cats, yogis, in moonlight, in sunlight etc.  The 
knowledge of Brahman as saguna inevitably leads to the knowledge of 
Brahman as nirguna.  It is just a different path.  And the proof is that 
even though Viraj set out to become Hiranyagarbha, he naturally came of 
his own accord without the need of another guru to that same nirguna 
realization.
