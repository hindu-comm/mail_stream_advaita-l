Dear list members,

Pranam! 

Could any body furnish me the bibliographical details in full (with pagination etc.) of the following reference to the Avadhuta Gita, as I need to refere it to my dissertation Philosohy of Advaita Vedanta according to Madhusudana Sarasvati's Gudharthadipika.

Avadhuta
Geeta says – to have that advaitic vision one needs grace of god – Iswaraanugraat eva pumsaam advaita vaasanaas.

With best rgs,
Niranjan Saha
