Namaste,

As Sriram ji as said, it is the first verse of AvadhUta gItA. If you are looking for devanagri script

You can find it on sanskritdocuments.org website

http://sanskritdocuments.org/doc_giitaa/doc_giitaa.html


Unicode version is available athttp://sanskritdocuments.org/all_sa/avadhutagiitaa_sa.html

I do not understand

Pls let me know the bibliographical details of it (with pagination, publishers' detail, year etc., as I need to refere it to the dissertation) if you have found a copy of it. It seems I could not locate any copy of it in Devanagari script online.
