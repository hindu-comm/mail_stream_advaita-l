Dear friends,

I am looking for a book called "Bhamati Samalochanam" by Late Swami Jnanananda Saraswati. The book seems to be a controversial book and it seems many scholars have strongly criticized the book.My only hope is that some members could have got some old copy of that and would like to share its contents with others. I shall be grateful if any member can give some information on that book.

Regards,
Sunil KB
