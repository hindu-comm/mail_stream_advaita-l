You may have noticed some disruption in mail from the list over the past 
day or two.  Do not be alarmed; we have not been hacked or anything like 
that.

The reason is that a few days ago Yahoo decided to implement an aggressive 
anti-spam measure that involved rejecting any mail that looks like it 
comes from Yahoo but comes from another server.  In principle this is a 
good idea but unfortunately some legitimate sources of mail such as our 
mailing list software also use this technique.  So many yahoo (and 
yahoo.in, yahoo.fr etc.) users stopped receiving mail from us.  Hotmail 
users were also affected as their mail servers respect Yahoos rejection 
notices.  Other providers were not affected as far as I know.  Also to 
make matters worse, after our mailing list server receives too many 
bounced messages, it helpfully decides that perhaps you are not interested 
any more and disables your account.

Everything should be back to normal now.  I've reenabled disabled accounts 
and upgraded the list server software to a version that works around this 
problem.  (I hope. We shall see over the next few days ha ha.)

If you have any problems please write to listmaster at advaita-vedanta.org 
not to the list.
