Here is an account how the Cow Lakshmi of Ramana Ashram
was granted liberation by Bhagavan Ramana.

Another incident was narrated to me by my friend about a certain dog that used to fast on 
ekadasi in Swami Sivananda Ashram at Rishikesh.   

This could be analyzed in another way.  When mahAtmAs descend on earth, 
some noble souls, assume the bodies of lesser mortals and assit in mission.  

These aspects we don't understand unless we are also in the same wavelength of
mahAtmAs. 

regs,
sriram
