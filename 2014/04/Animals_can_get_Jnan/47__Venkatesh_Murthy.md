If animal life is for Karma Phala Bhoga only why Viveka Chudamani Sloka 2
is saying Jantunaam Narajanma Durlabham? If it is Durlabha we have to make
a great effort to get it. For Nara Janma who is making the effort? The
animal or some other person like Sudra and Stree to get born as male
Brahmin?

 I agree generally animals cannot get Jnana. Viveka Chudamani has said for
Jnana that person must be a Brahmin male knowing Vedas and Vedanta and
other qualifications like Sadhana Catushtaya. Sudras and Strees are ruled
out. This is a general rule. But there can be exceptions in the three
categories of Sudras, Strees, and Pashus.
