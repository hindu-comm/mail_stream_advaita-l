Namaste

Jai Hanuman.

I was discussing with my friend. He asked Can Animals have Jnana? I said
animals cannot generally have Jnana because they have no intellect to
reflect on Who am I? But Hanuman is Kapeeshwara belonging to Ape family. He
is a Jnani.

Chimpanzees can play chess and do a lot of intellectual activities.
Probably they can be taught to think like humans. Is it true the Apes can
have Jnana like humans if they try? But other animals cannot?
