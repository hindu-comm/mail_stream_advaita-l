Dear All,
My humble pranams,

If animals which do not have discriminating intellect are to be considered
lower and incapable of spiritual realization, for that matter even
spiritual growth, what is their future? Will they always remain the same in
future births also or they will further deteriorate as they will hunt and
kill other beings to satiate their hunger in this birth as animals?
What will be their future?
Please elucidate?
