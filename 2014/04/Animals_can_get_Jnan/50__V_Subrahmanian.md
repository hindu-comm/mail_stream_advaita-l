Here is the need for discrimination.  An informed human will take the path
of karma yoga, niShkAma karma, which includes avoiding niShiddha and kAmya
(which includes puNya karma).  By so shaping his life in society, the jiva
will get liberation from any and every bodily life, eventually.

In the BG 6th ch. we have the case of yoga-bhraShTa.  There it is said that
even a sAdhaka on the path to attain jnana, if he dies before attaining
jnana, will go to those loka-s meant for puNya karmI-s, stay there for some
time and return to this loka of humans and continue his sAdhana.  So this
position of the shAstra sets at rest all possible questions/confusion.
