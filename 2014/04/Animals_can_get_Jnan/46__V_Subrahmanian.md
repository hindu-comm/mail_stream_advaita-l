According to the Vedic dharma, an animal life is the result of a jiva's
past adherence to niShiddha karma.  The animal/plant life is for bhoga,
experiencing the past karma phala only.  No new karma is accumulated  in
these lives.  At the end of this animal life, the jiva might return to
human or take any other form as per its accumulated karma.  From a human
life too one  could go up to attain super-human lives and after that from
there one could straight land in human or even lower lives.  The
Mundaka/kaTha upanishads have the appropriate mantras for this.
