It is that humans alone who have worked for getting further human janma-s
in order to continue their sAdhana and culminate it in self-realization.
 Since we have admitted anAdi sRShTi, there is no room for the question
about which being did sAdhana for getting human birth.  Since it is very
easy for humans to follow the niShiddha karma-s only the shAstra warns that
human janma is very difficult to get and that one aught to make the best
use of it.

In my first response itself I have covered the case of pashu-s by saying
that a spiritual sAdhana commenced in a human body can continue and
culminate in a pashu body.  For continuation of sAdhana we have the case of
jaDabharata's previous life as a deer where he continued to be exceedingly
careful not to end up getting another animal life.  But for the culmination
of sAdhana in a pashu body, I have no prAmANic example.  The cases of
Gajendra etc. are not the Advaitic Kaivalya but the other forms of mokSha
like sArUpya.
