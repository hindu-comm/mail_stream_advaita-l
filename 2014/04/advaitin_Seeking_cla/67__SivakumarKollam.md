SAdara praNAm

Enquiry about works of Maharshi DurvAsa.
Maharshi DurvAsa is famous for quick temper and hence called krOdha
BhattAraka.
The first hymn on Devi by an earthly being,Arya dwisathi ( Lalitha
stavaratna), is considered to be a work by him.Other works are Sakthi
Mahimna stotram,Swayamvara pArvathi mantra mAlA stotram,and Parasambhu
stuthi.
Those who are aware about the publication of these may kindly enlighten
about it.
Namaste.
