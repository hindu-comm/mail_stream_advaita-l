Namaste,

...............
Swami Tadrupanand translates it as 'go'.
.............

As per the dhAtu pATa, the root of "vraja" is "vraj"
which means "to go" only and the "vraja" is used 
as lOT lakAra here.  Whereas, here, in this context,
it should be taken as "to seek". 

So, "seek my shelter" is the correct translation. 

regs,
sriram
