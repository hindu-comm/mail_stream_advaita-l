Namaste,

...........
I meditate on OM and keeping focus on OM and later on it's source
does the job for me
.............

I appreciate your spiritual practice.  However, praNava anusandhAna and praNava japa
is for yatis only. For brahmachAris and grihasthAs, shuddha praNava is generally not advised. 

regs,
sriram
