PraNAmas Sri Sadananada ji

Thank you for giving clarity and guidance.

What you say is indeed true. Every word of it and I take it in a positive
way.

__/ \__

I understand that even such experiences are not to be focused and
definitely longed for else they will produce hindrance in my spiritual
progress. I meditate on OM and keeping focus on OM and later on it's source
does the job for me :)

I will also read the link that you have provided.

Hari OM

"To disconnect from the self and to become Aware of anything else is
nothing but unhappiness" - Bhagawan Ramana Maharshi

He who has faith has all
He who lacks faith, lacks all
It is the faith int he name of lord that works wonders
FAITH IS LIFE, DOUBT IS DEATH - Sri Ramakrishna
