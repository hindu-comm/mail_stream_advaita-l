PraNAms,

though this is off topic, I would like to make a note that when one is
having fever, diarrhoea / loose motions, then it is better not to meditate.

In fever vikAra is going out, leaving the body, while in meditation, one
withdraws his senses, which stops natural outward flow. Hence I was advised
to take rest.

Taking rest does not mean giving undue importance to either body or
disease. Just like body enjoys bhoga) delicacies, body also does a bhoga of
roga (disease).

Hari OM

OM

"To disconnect from the self and to become Aware of anything else is
nothing but unhappiness" - Bhagawan Ramana Maharshi

He who has faith has all
He who lacks faith, lacks all
It is the faith int he name of lord that works wonders
FAITH IS LIFE, DOUBT IS DEATH - Sri Ramakrishna
