I think I got this from DLI.  I'll email it to you separately.  It is a 
good source for overviews of the major works in nyaya-vaisheshika and 
navya nyaya but please note that some of the historical analysis in it 
might be a bit obsolete now.  A more recent source is the volumes in the 
History of Indian Philosophy series editted by Potter et al.
