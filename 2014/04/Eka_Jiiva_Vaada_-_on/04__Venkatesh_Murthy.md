Namaste

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_singularity

'The notion of an "intelligence explosion" was first described thus by Good
(1965<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_singularity#CITEREFGood1965>),
who speculated on the effects of superhuman machines:

Let an ultraintelligent machine be defined as a machine that can far
surpass all the intellectual activities of any man however clever. Since
the design of machines is one of these intellectual activities, an
ultraintelligent machine could design even better machines; there would
then unquestionably be an 'intelligence explosion,' and the intelligence of
man would be left far behind. Thus the first ultraintelligent machine is
the last invention that man need ever make.'

Two important points. 1. Man can build Ultra Intelligent Machine.  2. The
intelligence of Ultra Intelligent Machine will leave intelligence of man
far behind.

There is no rule 'tiny Jeeva' can only imagine and create things less
intelligent than himself. His Imagination Power is Maayaa Sakti. This
Maayaa Sakti can create superior persons like gods more intelligent than
man. It can create also Ishwara with Sarvajnatva. That Sarvajna Ishwara
will create the whole world seen by Jeeva in waking.  All this is imagined
by Jeeva in dream and waking both. In Sushupti the Maaya Sakti is not
working. He cannot see anything.
