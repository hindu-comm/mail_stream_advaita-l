Namaste Subrahmanian Ji and Sadananda Ji

Pranams.

Thank you for the explanation. So, from Jnani's standpoint -

Since the doership or enjoyership agent does not arise, in the light of the

For, when there is duality, as it were, one sees another …but when all has
become just his Ātman, what could one see and through what? .. - Br. Up.
