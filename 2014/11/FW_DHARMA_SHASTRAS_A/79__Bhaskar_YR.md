Subject: DHARMA SHASTRAS AND THEIR MODERN UTILITY A LECTURE 4 PARTS


Dear Friends,

It is taken for granted that Dharmshastras are now a thing of the
PAST as the new Constitution is the rule of law for the present.
But does a Eurocentric Law take care of all the social and cultural
issues that survive in India as a result of its 7000 years of civilational
history? Can Dharma Shastras be of no use today?

I have tied to suggest that things can be very different. The classical
texts can be used to improve present day life.

PLEASE SEE THESE AND RESPOND
