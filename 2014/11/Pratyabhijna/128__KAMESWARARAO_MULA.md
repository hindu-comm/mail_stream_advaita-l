Dear Sir,        I head several times the word name of "Pratyabhijna" through many people, but I dont't know what exactly it is. I request any learned members to give the details of what is Pratyabhinja? How is it related to Advaita Philosophy? I mean how it is different from Adi Shankara's Works.
With RegardsKameswara
