Namaste

Enthused by Sri Anand Hudli ji's writing on the topic of pratyakṣa annulled
by anumāna, here is an article on the above mentioned topic: where the
shruti, smriti and the sutra annul pratyaklṣa.  One can read the article
where both Sanskrit and English versions are available, interwoven:

The Sanskrit-only version is also uploaded here:

The Sanskrit used is very simple for that is my limitation.

Since the articles are long and also due to the two languages used, I have
uploaded them in the above URL.  Those interested may download the same.
Of, course, the contents thereof can be discussed on this forum.
