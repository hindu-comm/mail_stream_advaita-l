Namaste

I am looking for the English translation for the following hymnal works:

1.  Dakshinamurti Varnamala Stotram [25]
PDF from Sanskrit Document Site
<http://sanskrit.gde.to/all_pdf/dakShiNAvarNamAlA.pdf>

and 2.  the Dakshinamurthi stotram which commences with the words
''upāsakānām yadupāsanīyam..'  (it is not the more popular one with the
opening words 'vishvam darpaṇa...)

If there is any book available with the translation published by any
individual or institution, kindly provide the details.

Thanks and regards
subbu
