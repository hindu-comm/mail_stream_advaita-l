Dear list members,

Pranams!

Does anybody have any knowledge about the following works of Sankara? I would appreciate if any body could supply me with PDFs of these works.

1. Hastamalakiyam of Samkara with a commentary  by Svayamprakasha.
2. Sastranirupanam of Samkara with a commentary by Saccidananda Yogin (Nirnaysagar press).

Best regards,
Niranjan
