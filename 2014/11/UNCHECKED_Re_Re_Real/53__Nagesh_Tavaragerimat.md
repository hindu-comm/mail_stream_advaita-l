Shri Sujal Ji,
Pranams.

That is a very nice explanation. From what has been my little experience,
in lay man terms, deep meditation is similar to being in deep sleep state
(non existence of mind and ego), but, occurring while we are not in deep
sleep. Nothing exists in deep meditation, including any experience, for, to
experience you are depending on the mind, which fails the effort of deep
meditation.

Thanks.

Pranams,
Nagesh
