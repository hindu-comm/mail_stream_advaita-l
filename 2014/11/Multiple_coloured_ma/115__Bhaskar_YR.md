praNAms Sri Anand Hudli prabhuji
Hare Krishna

Thanks for the clarification.  As Sri Sriram prabhuji too observed, it seems mandala rachana and ArAdhana donot have the veda base reference.  I think it is more of a tantra based practice.  Anyway, I am not objecting mandalArAdhana here.  Just curious to know whether there is any stipulated vidhi-vidhAna for this??  For example, for chaturashra mandala, daLa, trikONa, bindu etc. is there any specific measurement, any particular colour prescribed in the texts??  Just wanted to know.  I have seen one book 'mandala darshanaM' (some Udupi publication I think) there we donâ€™t have these details.  

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar

It is unlikely that maNDalas are mentioned in shrauta and gRihya texts.
However, I have seen that prayoga manuals, such as the those based on narasiMha prayoga pArijAta for Rg vedins, do recommend maNdalas for various karmas, for example, the graha yajna. I have read somewhere (can't recall where right now) that a devatA can be worshipped in four forms - pratimA or idol, homa agni, kalasha, and maNDala or yantra. That is probably why all these different forms of worship are included in one ritual, to produce the best effect.

Anand
