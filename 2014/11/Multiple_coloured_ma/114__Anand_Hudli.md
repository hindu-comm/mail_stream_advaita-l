It is unlikely that maNDalas are mentioned in shrauta and gRihya texts.
However, I have seen that prayoga manuals, such as the those based on
narasiMha prayoga pArijAta for Rg vedins, do recommend maNdalas for various
karmas, for example, the graha yajna. I have read somewhere (can't recall
where right now) that a devatA can be worshipped in four forms - pratimA or
idol, homa agni, kalasha, and maNDala or yantra. That is probably why all
these different forms of worship are included in one ritual, to produce the
best effect.
