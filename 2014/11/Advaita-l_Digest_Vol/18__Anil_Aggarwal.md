> 45 years of Advaita! What are the rewards of such longevity? Chitta Suddhi has some relative reward but is ultimately limited and still ignorant. The reward of Advaita is infinite, not finite. So unless we recognize the ever revealed moksa, Advaita is just another faith based pursuit that only leads to renunciation, deep thinking and the same old fool. .
