PraNams 

Like wise the most of the criticism of Advaita by Bhagavan Ramanuja is in Shree Bhaashya - the commentary on Brahma suutra. He talks about laghu and then mahaa purvapaksha where advaita doctrine is taken as the purvapaksha. The criticism in Geeta bhaashya are scattered all over and difficult to pin point where.

Hari Om!
Sadananda.

 The quest is quite a strenuous
 and involving one. You will have to give a
 lot of time and effort for this. During my
 replies/refutations in
 discussion
 groups/articles, I have looked into the Madhva commentary to
 the
 BG. On many occasions one will find
 the criticism of Shankara in the
 Jayatirtha's gloss to Madhva's
 commentary. You can use the Gitasupersite
 which contains both these: Madhva's
 commentary and Jayatirtha's gloss. But
 then, Madhva has not commented on several
 verses and so J too mostly leaves
 them
 out. One might have to go to the other Gita commentaries
 of Madhva
 and their glosses to get more
 instances of their criticism of Shankara.

 As far as I have seen, they do
 not mention Shankara by name. They use
 words like 'paraiḥ' ('...as said
 by the 'others') and from the issue taken
 up you will have to infer that it is Shankara
 they are referring to. Maybe
 terms like
 'māyāvādibhiḥ' could also be found
 somewhere!!

 A reasonable
 knowledge of Sanskrit is a must in such a quest. You
 may
 perhaps benefit by studying
 B.N.K.Sharma's books too on the BG, if any as
 they are in English.

 The above methodology is common for all other
 non-advaitin commentators.
