Respected Members,

Vedas proclaim "Yato Vacho Nivartante Aprapya Manasasaha"....But looks like one cannot go beyond mind because everything has to be cognized via mind only. Even during meditation if the mind is not centered it will wander all over the places and realization cannot be had without the help of the mind. I remember having read somewhere U.G.Krishnamurthy as saying, one cannot go beyond mind, and since everything has to be cognized through mind, realization of Brahman (which is beyond mind) is a myth.
Can someone elaborate how Advaitic Realization is possible going beyond Mind? Is Nidhidhyasana is also through mind?


Regards,
Umesh
