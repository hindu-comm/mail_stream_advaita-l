Yes, 
Atma does not realization , it is always free and eternal. The change needs to occur in mind only. All experiences including nidhidhaysnam are in mind only as rightly quoted by you sir from Amritbindu Upanishad

Even during meditation if the mind is not centered it will wander all over the places and realization cannot be had without the help of the mind. I remember having read somewhere U.G.Krishnamurthy as saying, one cannot go beyond mind, and since everything has to be cognized through mind, realization of Brahman (which is beyond mind) is a myth.
