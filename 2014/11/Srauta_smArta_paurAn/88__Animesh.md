Namaste sir , 

I think you misunderstood my thought .I had given vidhi of smArata Achamana performed by atharva vedinns of Gujarat.[ I my self don't agree with there practice of performing Achmana by names of veda , my family tradition don't support their views ]

Generally we perform Achamana by those 4 mantras and not by names of vedas   .Yet I have posted them because of my observation of their peculiar practices.
Only Gujarat based atharvavedins perform smArta Achaman by them.
