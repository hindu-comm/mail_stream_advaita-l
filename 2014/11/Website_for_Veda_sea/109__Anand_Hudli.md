Here is a website introduced by my friend Dr. P. Ramanujan from CDAC. You
can search for a word in Yajur, Rg, or sAma vedas, using the keypad
provided.

For example, I typed in the word "mAyA" (using the keypad) and searched the
Rg Veda. It shows results from saMhitA, brAhmaNa, and AraNyaka, and
padapATha and kramapATha as well.
