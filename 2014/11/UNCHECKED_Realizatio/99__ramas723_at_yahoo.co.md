I am not well versed at all in Bhamathi or Vivarana prasthana. however Vachaspati's position appeals to me and also seems logical. When one continues Vichara via nidhidhyasana, like a continuous pouring of oil from the container, then a transformation occurs which is Advaitic realization. Also Vachaspati's explanation of vasanas hindering immediate realization by merely hearing Mahavakyas seems very logical. Recent scientific research on brain plasticity may also throw light on continuous nidhidhyasana bringing about brain transformation itself realizing oneness.
