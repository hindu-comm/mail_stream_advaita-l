Srī mātre namah 

Namaste ,

I'm sending quit unrelevent article .Our group is devoted to advaita + smArta tradition. I had found on net( somewhere long time ago )  erroneous vidhi of tantrika tilak dhAran prayoga .
I'm posting a shuddhA vidhi from a authentic copy of mAhAkAl samhitA .
( I'm posting this due to its rarity and for comparison with our smArta vidhi )
Guhya kali is one of vamamArga aspect of kali worship .My following post describes bhasma / tilak dhAran vidhi from mAhAkala samhitA guhya kAli khanda .
It describes procedure of tilak dhAran in accordance with kaula , aghor , kAlamukha , digambara 
Sects of guhya kAli upAsaks.( prayoga mantras are common to 4 sects )
