Thrissur: APRIL 5 – 6, 2012

Sri Adi Shankaracharya and His teachings

Arriving at Thrissur on 5th April 2012, Jagadguru Shankaracharya Sri Sri Bharati Tirtha Mahaswamiji proceeded
to the Moorkaanikara Ashraya Bhavan.

In His Anugraha Bhashanam, the Jagadguru said the feats of Sri Krishna such as the lifting of the Govardhana
mountain for a week on his little finger, were indicative of His divinity. Similarly it is evident that
Sri Adi Shankaracharya was an incarnation of the Lord as His life was filled with immense achievements.

His mission was to spread the message contained in the Shastras and make people realize what one’s objective
in life has to be. Even 12 centuries after His incarnation, our reverence and devotion towards Him remains
undimmed. People around the world who have taken an interest in Indian philosophical thought have analyzed
and realized that the philosophical exposition of Sri Adi Shankaracharya stands supreme.

The Jagadguru pointed out that the parents obtained Sri Adi Shankara as a son by devotedly worshipping
Vrishachaleshwara in Thrissur.

The essence of Sri Adi Shankaracharya’s teachings is that one has to feel it is a great fortune to have
taken birth as a human. Any one would think well when he gets a precious thing. Hence once should adhere to
Dharma, shun Adharma, be devoted to God, shun anger, hurt none and cultivate compassion.

The Jagadguru also quoted the Lord’s statement in the Gita – “He who hates none” – अद्वेष्टा सर्वभूतानाम्” –
is dear to the Lord. One has to understand love can help you achieve what anger and hate cannot. 
One must not expect anything in return for the help one renders. Can anyone imagine the difficulty
Sri Adi Shankaracharya would have had, when He travelled around the nation thrice on foot? He did it only
for the good of others. Did He expect anything in return?

On 6th April, the Jagadguru visited a Shiva temple near the Bhavan in Thrissur and had Darshan. In the
evening, the Jagadguru graced the Jyotisha Pathashala at Kodakara and travelled towards Kalady.
