Dear Srirudraji, Sadanandji, Subrahmanianji,

Thank you so much for your kind response and guidance. I'm having all commentaries with me and trying to locate the contexts required.
By the way, do you have B.N.Sharma's book on the BhG to send me?

With best regards,
Niranjan Saha

Dears
It is not easy to compile the criticisms as sought above.But one can take book by book -SriRamanuja's bhashyam and
 compare it with Sri Sankara 'sBhashyam-and enjoy the different interpretations of the Gita 's slokas from angle of Visishtadvaitham and from angle of Advaita.
In some Gita books we can find comparisons.Advaita interpretation is termed mayavadin's by SriA.C.Bhakthi Vedantha Prabhupadha who more or less upholds Sri Ramanuja's interpretations and to some extent Sri Madhvacharya's too.They go by Devotion as the supreme principle against Jnanam advocated by Sri Bhagavadpadha.R.Krishnamoorthy.
