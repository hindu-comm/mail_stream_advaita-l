Dears
It is not easy to compile the criticisms as sought above.But one can take book by book -SriRamanuja's bhashyam and compare it with Sri Sankara 'sBhashyam-and enjoy the different interpretations of the Gita 's slokas from angle of Visishtadvaitham and from angle of Advaita.
In some Gita books we can find comparisons.Advaita interpretation is termed mayavadin's by SriA.C.Bhakthi Vedantha Prabhupadha who more or less upholds Sri Ramanuja's interpretations and to some extent Sri Madhvacharya's too.They go by Devotion as the supreme principle against Jnanam advocated by Sri Bhagavadpadha.R.Krishnamoorthy.
