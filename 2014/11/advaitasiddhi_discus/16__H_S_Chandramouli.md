Dear Sri Anandji,

Reg  << As you can see, the beauty of Sanskrit wordplay is lost in the
translation. >> . The difference is that it is in verse form in sanskrit
and prose form in english. I am not suggesting by any means that some of
the finer points is lost in translation especially from sanskrit to
english. However comparison should be on like to like basis. Perhaps a
reasonably good ( and certainly much better ) translation should be
possible if it is done in verse form in english as well.

Also one needs to consider the reach as well. For one knowing sanskrit  and
interested in advaita sidhanta, perhaps the original work along with its
commentaries would be preferred to such simple works. On the otherhand an
english version which liberally uses sanskrit terms as well ( wherever they
convey the meaning more forcefully ) would have a much wider reach and
would be welcomed by a large section of interested readers. Practically all
the Indian languages borrow heavily from sanskrit and the sanskrit terms
used in such works are quite easily understood and appreciated.  Just a
suggestion.

Regards

Chandramouli
