Shree Anand - PraNAms

I concur with Shree Chandramouliji. Here we are not talking about the literary subtleties but logical analysis since the whole Adviata Siddhi is response to the NyaayamRitam and both are based on navya nyaaya principles. One can provide the sanskrit words and provide the closest translation to make the logical arguments understandable. 

Recently I was looking for word by word meaning in English for Adyasa bhaashya. At last Shree Subhanuji said he will take up the task and he  seems to have completed and as I understand he is also providing more elaborate analysis of the adhyaasa bhaashya in a book form. 

Shreeman S.M.S. Chari has translated the shataduushanii of Vedanta desika into English in the text form - Advaita and VishishTaadvaita (the number of objections are not really 100 but around 60-70 or so). Chari maama (he is no more now) said once that no one has responded to the objections. The recent response by Shree Anantakrishna Sastriji apparently does not address item by item but only restates the Advaita doctrine as per Chaarimaama. 

While the language aspect is one thing but the concepts should be understood clearly. We do use the words maaya, dharma etc without much translation since there are really no equivalent words in English.

Just my 2c.

Hari Om!

 Dear Sri Anandji,

Reg  << As you can see, the beauty of Sanskrit wordplay is lost in the
translation. >> . The difference is that it is in verse form in sanskrit
and prose form in english. I am not suggesting by any means that some of
the finer points is lost in translation especially from sanskrit to
english. However comparison should be on like to like basis. Perhaps a
reasonably good ( and certainly much better ) translation should be
possible if it is done in verse form in english as well.

Also one needs to consider the reach as well. For one knowing sanskrit  and
interested in advaita sidhanta, perhaps the original work along with its
commentaries would be preferred to such simple works. On the otherhand an
english version which liberally uses sanskrit terms as well ( wherever they
convey the meaning more forcefully ) would have a much wider reach and
would be welcomed by a large section of interested readers. Practically all
the Indian languages borrow heavily from sanskrit and the sanskrit terms
used in such works are quite easily understood and appreciated.  Just a
suggestion.

Regards

Chandramouli
