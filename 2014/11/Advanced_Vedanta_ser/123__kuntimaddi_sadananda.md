PraNAms to all.

As a follow up to Introduction to Vedanta (see yu-tube - under acharya sadaji - Introduction to Vedanta series) we started Advanced Vedanta series, taking Vivekachudamani text as the basis, since it contains the essence of Geeta and Upanishads. The first three talks were recorded today and can be found starting from the first talk at http://livestre.am/4ZRSp for those who are interested. The Advaita Academy is sponsoring these series and they will be converted to yu-tube talks slowly. The talks continue to morrow from 9:00AM IST.

Hari Om!
Sadananda
