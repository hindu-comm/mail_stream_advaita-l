Sri mAtre namaH 

Namaste, 

A post describing kunjikA stotra of dAmar tantra.It is famous tantric stotra which is recited with devImahAtmaya. According to different sampradAya ( tantric tradition ) and gurU paramparA ( master pupil lineage ) the text of stotra varies ,Same is true about devimahAtmaya .

This time i have included an introduction to kunjika stotra and dAmar tantra in brief way.
