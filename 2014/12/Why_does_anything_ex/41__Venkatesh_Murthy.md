Namaste,

http://www.bbc.com/earth/story/20141106-why-does-anything-exist-at-all

This article is saying -

'Their admittedly controversial answer is that the entire universe, from
the fireball of the Big Bang to the star-studded cosmos we now inhabit,
popped into existence from nothing at all. It had to happen, they say,
because "nothing" is inherently unstable.'

In Advaita we say the Universe is produced by Maayaa. But Maayaa is not
Nothing. It is Not Sat and Not Asat also. Science is still lagging behind
Advaita because Scientists are saying Universe is arising from Nothing.
