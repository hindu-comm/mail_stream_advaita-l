One may look at verse 3.48

माण्डूक्योपनिषद्भाष्यम् । अद्वैतप्रकरणम् । कारिका ४८
न कश्चिज्जायते जीवः सम्भवोऽस्य न विद्यते ।
*एतत्तदुत्तमं सत्यं यत्र किञ्चिन्न जायते *॥ ४८ ॥

and the bhāṣhya thereon:

माण्डूक्योपनिषद्भाष्यम् । अद्वैतप्रकरणम् । कारिका ४८ - भाष्यम्
सर्वोऽप्ययं मनोनिग्रहादिः *मृल्लोहादिवत्सृष्टिरुपासना च उक्ता
परमार्थस्वरूपप्रतिपत्त्युपायत्वेन, न परमार्थसत्येति । *परमार्थसत्यं तु न
कश्चिज्जायते जीवः कर्ता भोक्ता च नोत्पद्यते केनचिदपि प्रकारेण । अतः
स्वभावतः अजस्य अस्य एकस्यात्मनः सम्भवः कारणं न विद्यते नास्ति । यस्मान्न
विद्यतेऽस्य कारणम्, तस्मान्न कश्चिज्जायते जीव इत्येतत् ।
पूर्वेषूपायत्वेनोक्तानां
सत्यानाम् एतत् उत्तमं सत्यं यस्मिन्सत्यस्वरूपे ब्रह्मणि अणुमात्रमपि
किञ्चिन्न जायते इति ॥

After having said that no jiva ever is born, it is further emphasized that
nothing is ever born.  The purpose of delineation of creation by the shruti
is only an upāya, means, to enable the aspirant to know the ultimate
truth.  Having said this, the vedanta siddhanta is that nothing ever is
born.  The very concept of something coming into being is alien to
vedanta.  This very idea is again brought in kārikā/bhāṣya 4.71 too.
