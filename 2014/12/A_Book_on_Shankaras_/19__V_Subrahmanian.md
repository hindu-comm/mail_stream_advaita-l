When searching the net for a digital / hard copy of the "Shankara's Date"
book (published in the year 1981) which was required by one of my students,
  I chanced to visit this following link where one K.Parthasarathy has
typeset and uploaded this book; the front page says it is a revised,
unpublished version (1983). The book is downloadable in PDF format in A4
size.
