Namaskar, 

My first preference these days is for a soft copy, though till about a couple of years ago I preferred to read hard copies only. I have been generally staying in India, but at this time I am abroad. These days I have to move from one place to another, as and when the situation demands. The Sushama and the Punyaslokamanjari are very old books and there may not be any copyright involved in transmitting them by photocopying or by scanning. I shall be interested in having a copy each of these in whatever form the same may be available. If it is available as hard copy in India only I am agreeable to pay the necessary costs (i.e., the cost of the books plus international postage) for sending me the same.
Regards,Sunil K. Bhattacharya

Insufficient information to provide a cogent answer. Are you talking of hard copy or soft copy? Presuming the former, Sir where are you physically located. I have been decades away from Sringeri and I am hardly current as to what is available. However I am copying this to one punyatma – a good gurubhai from decades back who is very active on the Adviata e-list, a sound traditional scholar, with a very compassionate ‘lokasamgraha janakdayha’ attitude. He is also joined at the hip with the Sringeri Matha. Perhaps he knows or almost certainly knows who knows. May Iswaranugrahma be with you in your devout aspiration.

I did not know that there were / are still people around who know of such esoteric things.But trying to locate Mahaswamigal’s dEvatArchana box is a losing proposition. He lived from 1858–1912, i.e. more than 100 years ago. The chances of recovering any such piece of paper, assuming it has not decayed in the Sringeri weather is vanishingly small.

I am told that His Holiness got certain hints from Mother Aryamba and jotted down certain important points related to Acharya Sankara jananam. My guruji told me that His Holiness preserved that in a piece of paper in His personal dEvatArchana box.  If that can be traced, most of the confusion around the Acharya Sankara's date could be solved.  regs, sriram _______________________________________________Archives: http://lists.advaita-vedanta.org/archives/advaita-l/http://blog.gmane.org/gmane.culture.religion.advaita To unsubscribe or change your options:http://lists.advaita-vedanta.org/cgi-bin/listinfo/advaita-l For assistance, contact:listmaster at advaita-vedanta.org
