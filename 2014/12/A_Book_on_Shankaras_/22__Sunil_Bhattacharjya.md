 Namaskara Sri Sriram Avarige:



I am told that His Holiness got certain hints from Mother Aryamba and jotted down certain important points related to Acharya Sankara jananam. My guruji told me that His Holiness preserved that in a piece of paper in His personal dEvatArchana box. 



Interesting bit of information of which I was not aware. I did not know that there were / are still people around who know of such esoteric things.



But trying to locate Mahaswamigal’s dEvatArchana box is a losing proposition. He lived from 1858–1912, i.e. more than 100 years ago. The chances of recovering any such piece of paper, assuming it has not decayed in the Sringeri weather is vanishingly small. 



Shambhave Namah,



Nagendra

Namaste,



After Shri Sacchidananda Sivabhinava Narasimha Bharati Mahaswamigal of Sringeri, discovering the samAdhi sthala in Kaladi, meditated there. His Holiness, in antarmukha sthiti, conversed with Mother Aryamba, the Mother of Acharya Sankara.



I am told that His Holiness got certain hints from Mother Aryamba and jotted down certain important points related to Acharya Sankara jananam. My guruji told me that His Holiness preserved that in a piece of paper in His personal dEvatArchana box. 



If that can be traced, most of the confusion around the Acharya Sankara's date could be solved. 



regs,

sriram
