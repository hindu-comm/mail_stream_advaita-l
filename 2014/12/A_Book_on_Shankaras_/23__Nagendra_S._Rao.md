Namaskara.



Insufficient information to provide a cogent answer.



Are you talking of hard copy or soft copy?  Presuming the former, Sir where
are you physically located.



I have been decades away from Sringeri and I am hardly current as to what is
available.  However I am copying this to one punyatma - a good gurubhai from
decades back who is very active on the Adviata e-list, a sound traditional
scholar, with a very compassionate 'lokasamgraha janakdayha' attitude.  He
is also joined at the hip with the Sringeri Matha.  Perhaps he knows or
almost certainly knows who knows.



May Iswaranugrahma be with you in your devout aspiration. 



Shambhave Namah,



Nagendra

Namaste,



Is it possible to get a copy of (1) the Punyaslokamanjari and (2) the
Sushama commntary of the Gururatnamala.



Regards,

dEvatArchana box.  

Interesting bit of information of which I was not aware.  I did not know
that there were / are still people around who know of such esoteric things.

But trying to locate Mahaswamigal's dEvatArchana box is a losing
proposition.  He lived from 1858-1912, i.e. more than 100 years ago.  The
chances of recovering any such piece of paper, assuming it has not decayed
in the Sringeri weather is vanishingly small. 

Shambhave Namah,

Nagendra

Namaste,



After Shri Sacchidananda Sivabhinava Narasimha Bharati Mahaswamigal of
Sringeri, discovering the samAdhi sthala in Kaladi, meditated there.  His
Holiness, in antarmukha sthiti, conversed with Mother Aryamba, the Mother of
Acharya Sankara.



I am told that His Holiness got certain hints from Mother Aryamba and jotted
down certain important points related to Acharya Sankara jananam.  My guruji
told me that His Holiness preserved that in a piece of paper in His personal
dEvatArchana box.  



If that can be traced, most of the confusion around the Acharya Sankara's
date could be solved.  



regs,



sriram
