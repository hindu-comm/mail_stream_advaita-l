Namaste,

After Shri.Sacchidananda Sivabhinava Narasimha Bharati Mahaswamigal of Sringeri, discovering the samAdhi sthala in Kaladi, meditated there.  His Holiness, in antarmukha sthiti, conversed with Mother Aryamba, the Mother of Acharya Sankara.

I am told that His Holiness got certain hints from Mother Aryamba and jotted down certain important points related to Acharya Sankara jananam.  My guruji told me that His Holiness preserved that in a piece of paper in His personal dEvatArchana box.  

If that can be traced, most of the confusion around the Acharya Sankara's date could be solved.  

regs,
sriram
