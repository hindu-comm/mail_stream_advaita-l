I am learning Sanskrit and I am interested in everything to this, but my
primary motivation is bend towards Advaita Vedanta.

I am Aravind Sharma, a smartha brahmin from Bangalore. After so much of 
research about the existence of Atma, I have learnt that Advaita is the way to 
go. I request you to add me into this group.

I am a software developer by profession, initiating my study in spiritualism
