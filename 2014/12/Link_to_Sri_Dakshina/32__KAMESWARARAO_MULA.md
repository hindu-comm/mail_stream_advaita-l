Dear Subbuji,              The stotra was good, excellent! unfortunately video was disappeared from that site. Can we get mp3 kind of file of that stotra " Upaskanam' so that we can load in our PC's & listen whenever we want.
thanks & regardskameswara Rao

 Dear Sriram ji,

The link contained just the rendering of the stotram 'upāsakānām...' and
not any exposition. I have informed the concerned person about the
removal.

regards
subbu
