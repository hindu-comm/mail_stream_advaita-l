Please Ignore My Previous Mail

Dear Members,
I am Aravind Sharma from Bangalore, I am eager to learn Advaita & Tarka shastras. I have learnt that 
knowledge of Basics of Sanskrit Literature, Grammar & Logic is a must for that.

Does anyone know any good teachers for the above mentioned basics, in Bangalore?


Thanks
Aravind
