Dear Members,
I am Aravind Sharma from Bangalore, I am eager to learn Advaita & Tarka shastras. I have learnt that 
knowledge of Basics of Sanskrit Literature, Grammar & Logic is a must for that. (Which is encompassed as 
Sahitya exam by KSU bangalore).
Does anyone know any good teachers for the above mentioned basics, in Bangalore?

Thanks
Abhinand
