Namaste

I found this Sloka in a very old book 'Sacred Books of the Hindus' but I
could not find the Source where it is first given.
It could be Mahanirvana Tantra.

You can get it from Forgotten Books web site.

Q. Does Higher Hinduism encourage image worship?

A. No. On the contrary it deprecates it in the strongest terms.

बालक्रीडनवत् सर्वं रूपनामादिकल्पनम् ।
विहाय ब्रह्मनिष्ठो यः स मुक्तो नत्र संशयः ॥
मनसा कल्पिता मूर्त्तिः नृणां चेन् मोक्षसाधनी ।
स्वप्नलब्धेन राज्येन राजानो मानवास्तदा ।।
मृच्छिलाधातुदार्वादि मूर्त्तावीश्वरबुद्धयः ।
क्लिश्यन्तस्तपसा ज्ञानं विना मोक्षं न यान्ति ते ॥

'He who is devoted to the Supreme God Brahman having abandoned all imagined
forms and names as so many play things for children, attains salvation
without a doubt. If mentally imagined forms could give salvation to Mankind
then verily all dreamers would become kings in fact, because they in their
dreams had obtained a kingdom. Those who think God is made of clay, stone,
metal or wood merely trouble themselves by fruitless austerities. for
without right knowledge they shall never attain to emancipation.'
