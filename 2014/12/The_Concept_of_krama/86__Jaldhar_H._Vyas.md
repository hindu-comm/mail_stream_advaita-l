If one is confused then he is far short of jnana and should be worrying 
about that instead of questions like this one.

It appears that your mental model is something like this.  There are 
multiple nama/rupas lets call them A1, A2, A3 ... An.  Then there is 
"nameless, formless consciousness" lets calls it B.  And "going forward on 
the path" involves erasing A1, A2 etc. until all that is left is B.

But that's not the Advaita model.  We say there is only B.  What appear to 
be A1, A2 etc. are only superimpositions upon B.  Our job is to understand 
that A1 or A2 are _not_distinct_ from B.  See the difference?  There is no 
forward or backward, addition or subtraction only a shift in perspective. 
the As never go away.  They do not "become" B.  A = B and A always 
equalled B and always will equal B.  There are some people (I daresay the 
majority) who acknowledge the greatness of B but still think As are 
different.  These are the ones who by the application of intellect come 
around to krama mukti.

Your model is more like that of the classical samkhya.  In that darshan 
the evolution of trigunatmaka prakrti has caused the inert seer called 
purusha to be "stuck."  He becomes unstuck by recognizing his difference 
from prakrti.  In the brahmasutrabhashya Shankaracharya systematically 
demolishes that view.
