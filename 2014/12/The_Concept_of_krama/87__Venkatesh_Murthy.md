Namaste

I think my point was lost in the message.

He could be making the point Saguna Brahma is very very close approximation
for Nirguna Brahma. If we worship Him it is practically like Nirguna
worship. Is it correct? We have to investigate. If Saguna Brahma is very
very close form of Nirguna the Vaishnavas argument to treat Saguna Brahma
as Para Brahman is correct. This we have to research.

I want to know if Adi Sankara has loosely mixed Saguna Brahma like Vishnu
with Nirguna Brahma in Gita Bhashya. In some cases he seems using it like
that.
