You are right.  As Swami Sarvabhuteshanandji replied to you sat, chit, and 
ananda are not attributes so they cannot be compared and measured.  All we
can say is Brahman is sat.  Brahman is chit.  Brahman is ananda.

Granted, but we could also say without sat, chit is hopelessly entangled 
with maya or without ananda there is no volition for sat or chit.  I don't 
think it is a good idea to try and place one over the others but instead 
one should try and understand how between them they describe Brahman.
