Dear Members,
Recently I was listening to some lectures on Advaita in Telugu by an Advaitin. In the course of his lecture he mentioned that Chit is greater than Sat. All the while I was thinking Sat-Chit-Ananda is the swarupa of Brahman itself. In that case how can Chit can be greater than Sat?Can someone elaborate on this?
Best Regards,
Umesh
