SrI mAtre namaH

Namaste ,

This topic is quit unfamiliar with our group but due to its  intense rarity I'm sharing this.
Gauri tantra belongs to kashmir trika tantras ( pashimAnya kubjika sampradaya ) .This is rare and pure  version of kunjika stotra which is recited  with devimahAtmaya .( chandi pAtha ) . 
Especially this version is used for shipra siddhi and rapid effect. If chanted without any desire it helps in inner purification by grace of ambA.

( This was given  to me, while a discussion on kashmira trika system by a pupil of SrI bAbA dabrala .
He is one of bhairava siddha and master in Kashmir trika system . )
