Srī mātre namaH

Namaste 

By grace of  parAmba and our Acharya ,I was able to trace some information on lost brAhman portion of paippalAda samhitA.
While my self study of bramha sutra ( 3.3.25 ) I had found some evidencces of this PB in Acharya's bhAshya. After that I was able to collect some more information. My following post concerns with lost paippalAda brahman .
I request all group members to visit it.
( At the same incidence I have realized why we call SrI shankarAcharya as " shuti smriti purAnAnAM AlayaM karunAlayaM  ........ )
