I am a shuklayajurvedi and FWIW the practice is to use water only for 
nitya tarpana.  kala tal is used for masika shraddha (very rarely 
practiced by Gujaratis) and varshika shraddha only.

Yes you are right both that the sutra says this and it is not the current 
practice.  Personally I am happy to stick with sampradayika level of rigor 
but your efforts to publicize such things are laudable.

Incidently even though the trikandika sutra is a parishishta of Maharshi 
Paraskaras grhya sutra, its author is said to be Maharshi Katyayana.

Personally I don't think one whose father is still alive should do pitra 
tarpana at all so I omit it myself.
