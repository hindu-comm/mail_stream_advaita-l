Kindly see this -

The Tarpana for Nitya Pitrus or Divya Pitrus must be given with water by
all even if  Father is alive. For Jeevat Pitruka the Tarpana is with Savya,
for others it is with Apasavya or Praaceenaaveeti. Yama Tarpana is also
given with water and Sesame by all. But Jeevat Pitruka cannot use Black
Sesame. He must use Yava or white rice grains.
