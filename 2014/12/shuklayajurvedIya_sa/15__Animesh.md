Namste sir ,

You wrote " In the Divya Pitru Tarpana I always heard we should not give it with Black Till and water but we should use pure water only. Black Till is for Yama Tarpana and Manushya Pitrus only. "

Our " tarpan parishishta " is silent at this Moment .But in case of shukla yajurveda , I'm quoting a sutra from a authentic grihya  source .It is from "TrikandikA snAnasutraM " of pAraskarAcharya. (It is  appendix sutra of pAraskara grihya sutraM )
" tato apasvayaM tilamishraM kavyavAdaanal (gum ) somaM........"

This mean , now becoming in apasavya position one should offer water + tila to divya pitras.( see pharse tila mishraM ) trice .
From this it is clear there is no restriction in use of tila + water offering to divya pitras in vAjasaneya tradition.
It may be possible that in case of krishna yajurveda it is not permissible.
Even in our atharva veda tarpan prayoga we don't offer tila+ water to divya pitras.

( You may also refer to pAraskara TrikandikA snAnasutraM ,3 rd kandikA   , I have a copy of pAraskar grihya sutraM with 2 bhAsyaM and hindI commentry from chaukamba surabhArti series .if you want I will email  scanned  page which I quoted. )

Regards 
Animesh
