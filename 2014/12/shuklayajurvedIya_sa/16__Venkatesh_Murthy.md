Namaste Sri Animesh

You have given the reference - " tato apasvayaM tilamishraM kavyavAdaanal
(gum ) somaM........". But in practice I see that the Jeevat Pitruka person
with Father alive will not give Tarpana with Yajnopavita in Apasavya. He
must give it with Savya only. Or he can give it in Savya and putting the
Yajnopavita around his left thumb when he is giving Divya Pitru Tarpana.
This is also correct but not Apasavya for Jeevat Pitruka.

Similarly I think Jeevat Pitruka should not use Black Till for Tarpana.
