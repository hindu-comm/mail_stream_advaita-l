Namaste Sri Murthy 


At the point I'm agree that a jivita pitraka person should perform divya pitru tarpan in savya position. But sutrakara assumes the person whose father is no more and had installed grihya / srauta agni is his reader , so such a person should performan it by apasavyaM only.( The author assumes a person whose whose father is no more and had installed grihya / srauta agni is performer not a jivit pitraka one . Yagyavalkya smriti accounts of tarapan vidhi of jivita pitraka person .)

In yagynvalkya smriti there is neshada of krishna tila but sutra reads "tilamishara " so we should assume white tila not kishna one in case of jivita pitraka.
