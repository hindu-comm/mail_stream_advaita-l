Namaste,




Mula Ramayana consists of the hundred verses ,which Narada told to Valmiki and these hundred verses are in the beginning of the Valmiki Ramayana. 

As regards Lord Ram being a human, he was indeed so for all purpose, as he was under a curse from one of the eternal Kumaras (I think it was probably Sanatkumara). According to the curse Vishnu would forget all his knowledge and he had to take birth and get that knowledge from Vasistha. Yet he was not declared to be Lord Vishnu till Ravana was kileed as Ravana could be killed by a human being only. It was only after Ravana was killed that Lord Brahmaa reminded him that he (Lord Ram) was indeed Vishnu.

Regards,
Sunil KB

It can be further argued that, that Rama or Sita i.e. the avatara form
itself is a Lila accomplished through Maya. As Krishna says he has taken
birth using his own maya. Hence, Sita= Maya Lakshmi!! And Rama=Maya Vishnu
and hence, Vishnu & Lakshmi does not undergo any miseries but it is Rama &
Sita who undergo miseries!
