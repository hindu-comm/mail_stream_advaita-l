The case of Shankaracharya entering the body of King Amaruka is somewhat
similar to the above. 

praNAms Sri Subbu prabhuji
Hare Krishna

what a great analysis & justification prabhuji!!??  Really I admire your 
strength to defend anything that suits you right :-))  Anyway, before 
commenting anything on your deep analysis on 'body dOsha'  and not karaNa 
dOsha', I would like to know from the moderators whether SAME subject 
matter  which  has been put to rest by Sri Vidya prabhuji can be discussed 
under the different thread by changing the subject line ??  After hearing 
from them I shall try to comment on your mail prabhuji. Perhaps  you might 
not be aware of the ridiculous consequences that would arise by holding 
inert body above all :-))  Anyway, we shall wait for moderators 
confirmation with regard to the continuity of this thread. 

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
