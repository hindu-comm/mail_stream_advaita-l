In one ancient story Brahma had a daughter known as Usha. She was very
beautiful. Brahma became aroused and went after her. She became a deer and
ran away. But Brahma became a male deer and chased her and tried to mate.
But Siva shot an arrow at the male deer. That same Usha became Saraswati
and Brahma's wife. It may be true Saraswati is Brahma's daughter. Siva is
Brahma's Manasa Putra.

Siva is called Pashupati because he can control animal passions.
