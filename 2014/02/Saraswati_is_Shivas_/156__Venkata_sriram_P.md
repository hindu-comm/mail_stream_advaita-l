Namaste,

In chaNDi-sapthasathi, the uttarAnga consists of "rahasya-traya" ie., 3 rahasyAs viz.,
prAdhAnikam, vaikrutikam, murti respectively.

In the prAdhAnika-rahasya, the mUla-prakriti is called "chaturbhuja-mahAlakSmi".

Out of this mUla-prakriti, emanates two cosmic forces as mahAkALi & mahAsaraswati. 
Moreover, she Herself projects forth a mithuna of stri-purusha who are named as brahma & lakshmi.

The chaturbhuja-mahAlakSmi asks both mahAkALi & mahAsaraswati to project forth the stri-purusha mithuna.

Thus, chaturbhuja mahA-kALi projects forth a mithuna in the form of shiva-saraswati; 

chaturbhuja mahAsaraswati projects forth a mithuna in the form of viSNu-gauri.

So, to represent diagrammatically :

chaturbhuja-mahAlakSmi (also called chaNDi) > brahma + lakshmi

chaturbhuja-mahAkALi > shiva + saraswati

chaturbuja-mahAsaraswati > viSNu + gauri

Point to be noted is mahAsaraswati and saraswati are different bhAvanAtmaka-tattvAs.

regs,
sriram
