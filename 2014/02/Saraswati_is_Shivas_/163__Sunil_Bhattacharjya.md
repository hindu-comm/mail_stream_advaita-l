Namaste,

Puranic stories are interesting. Saraswati and Lakshmi are Lord Shiva's sister and not necessarily uterine (sahodara) sister. Nobody speaks of Lord Shiva having any mother. What I read about a Puranic story is that Lord Shiva created Lakshmi and Saraswati out of the Adi Shakti and performed Kanyadan of Lakshmi and Saraswati to LOrd Vishnu and Lord Brahjma. That may be the genesis of the story that Lakshmi and Saraswati can bacalled Lord Shiva's sister. As regards Lord Shiva being the son of Lord Brahma it is also said that on the request of Lord Brahma Lord Shiva agreed to be born as his (Brahma's) son. That is how Lord Brahma created the Rudras. It is also said that Lord Shiva only created the immortal Rudras from himself.

Regards,
Sunil KB

I heard Adi Sankara's Janma Nakshtra is Ardra. Ardra Nakshatra people are
very intelligent because it is in Budha Graha's Rashi and ruling lord is
Rahu. Rahu gives deep intellectual ability. The god of Ardra is Rudra. In
the Nakshatra Mantras we have to say 'Maa Nah Prajaagm Reerishan Mota
Veeraan Hetee Rudrasya Parino Vrunaktu Ardraa Nakshatram Jushataagm
Havirnaha'.

Wikipedia:
Ardra :- It lies completely in Gemini and the ruling planet is 'Rahu',
hence it is a Mercury+Rahu combination. It can be considered as the
combination of intellectual feeling with passionate thinking. The deity is
'Rudra', the God of destruction and it renders this quality in the native.
'Ardra' means moist or wet. It is symbolized as a teardrop. As Rahu is the
ruling planet the darker side of keen desire of materialism, causing
troubles for others. Thunder power can make a person violent by nature.
Native of 'Ardra' can be complaining and ungrateful.The animal symbol is
female dog (bitch) again confirming violence. This is a 'teekshna Sangyak'
Nakshatra, leading to destructive acts.
