What is the important moral you have drawn from the puranic story ?

Namaste,


I think, regarding puranas, moral of the story is more important than story itself.

>Puranic stories are interesting. Saraswati and Lakshmi are Lord Shiva's sister and not necessarily uterine (sahodara) sister. Nobody speaks of Lord Shiva having any mother. What I read about a Puranic story is that Lord Shiva created Lakshmi and Saraswati out of the Adi Shakti and performed Kanyadan of Lakshmi and Saraswati to LOrd Vishnu and Lord Brahjma. That may be the genesis of the story that Lakshmi and Saraswati can bacalled Lord Shiva's sister. As regards Lord Shiva being the son of Lord Brahma it is also said that on the request of Lord Brahma Lord Shiva agreed to be born as his (Brahma's) son. That is how Lord Brahma created the Rudras. It is also said that Lord Shiva only created the immortal Rudras from himself.
