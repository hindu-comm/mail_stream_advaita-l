Dear board members, 

Pranams,
After reading all the learned discussions, I have this doubt, though it is not related to Advaita as such and it is only a theoretical possibility.

If Saraswathi is the sister of Shiva and if both of them hail from a common parentage and if Shiva's parents happen to exist (I believe Shiva is swayambhootha, self-born and not born to any parents) at the time of Shiva's marriage, what happens? They would be sambandhis to Vishnu's parents to get the hand of Parvati for their son in marriage. They would also be sambandhis to Vishnu for getting Brahma (son of Vishnu) as their son-in-law for Saraswathi.

Any clarifications on this? Pranams, Ramesh Ramanan.

What is the important moral you have drawn from the puranic story ?

Namaste,


I think, regarding puranas, moral of the story is more important than story itself.

>Puranic stories are interesting. Saraswati and Lakshmi are Lord Shiva's sister and not necessarily uterine (sahodara) sister. Nobody speaks of Lord Shiva having any mother. What I read about a Puranic story is that Lord Shiva created Lakshmi and Saraswati out of the Adi Shakti and performed Kanyadan of Lakshmi and Saraswati to LOrd Vishnu and Lord Brahjma. That may be the genesis of the story that Lakshmi and Saraswati can bacalled Lord Shiva's sister. As regards Lord Shiva being the son of Lord Brahma it is also said that on the request of Lord Brahma Lord Shiva agreed to be born as his (Brahma's) son. That is how Lord Brahma created the Rudras. It is also said that Lord Shiva only created the immortal Rudras from himself.
