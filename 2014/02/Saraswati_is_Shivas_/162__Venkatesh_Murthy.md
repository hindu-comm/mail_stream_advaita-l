Namaste

I heard Adi Sankara's Janma Nakshtra is Ardra. Ardra Nakshatra people are
very intelligent because it is in Budha Graha's Rashi and ruling lord is
Rahu. Rahu gives deep intellectual ability. The god of Ardra is Rudra. In
the Nakshatra Mantras we have to say 'Maa Nah Prajaagm Reerishan Mota
Veeraan Hetee Rudrasya Parino Vrunaktu Ardraa Nakshatram Jushataagm
Havirnaha'.

Wikipedia:
Ardra :- It lies completely in Gemini and the ruling planet is 'Rahu',
hence it is a Mercury+Rahu combination. It can be considered as the
combination of intellectual feeling with passionate thinking. The deity is
'Rudra', the God of destruction and it renders this quality in the native.
'Ardra' means moist or wet. It is symbolized as a teardrop. As Rahu is the
ruling planet the darker side of keen desire of materialism, causing
troubles for others. Thunder power can make a person violent by nature.
Native of 'Ardra' can be complaining and ungrateful.The animal symbol is
female dog (bitch) again confirming violence. This is a 'teekshna Sangyak'
Nakshatra, leading to destructive acts.
