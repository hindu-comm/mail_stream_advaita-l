One way to think about it is to take away the element of the arrow of time from
this altogether, taking cue from the verse avyaktAdIni bhUtAni vyaktamadhyAni
bhArata.

Everything that exists in the universe today already existed in an unmanifested,
potential form at the moment the universe came into being. That is, if you take
creation as an event. The other option is to view creation as not an event at all,
as already pointed out by others.

To really grasp what these verses are teaching us, we need to step out of our
current conditioning to view such things as events in a linear historical framework.
It doesn't help to understand the vaidika traditions at all, if we think of the Rshis
as people who existed at some definite historical time, the varNa divisions as
something that started in another specific historical era, etc. 

Best regards,
Vidyasankar
