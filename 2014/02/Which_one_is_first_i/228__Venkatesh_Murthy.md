Namaste
Karika 2-16 is also saying Jeeva is imagined first and then all other
objective and subjective things. Jeeva is first imagined in Atma. This
Jeeva will then imagine the things of the whole world. We can say there is
a sequence because Jeeva is imagined first.

But after Jeeva is imagined he will imagine the whole universe. The second
imagination of Jeeva is simultaneous. He will not imagine one thing at a
time but all things at once. The whole universe is an imagination of Jeeva.
The Varnas, Rishis, animals, non living things, and even Ishwara is
imagined by him.

Imagination has infinite speed. If you travel at speed of light you will
reach nearest star in 4 years. But if you imagine you are there
immediately. Infinite speed. Like this the whole creation will happen with
infinite speed because it is imagined only.
