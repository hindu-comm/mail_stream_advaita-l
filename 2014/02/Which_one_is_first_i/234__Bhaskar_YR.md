but did not get the impression that the verse/bhashya
anywhere states that the entire creation takes place simultaneously.

praNAms
Hare Krishna

Shankara while commenting on the spider web example in muNdaka says 
another example i.e. hairs growing from the person...does it not imply the 
creation of 'all' is a simultaneous event??  Anyway, as I said before 
creation theories is not consistent within shruti-s. 

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
