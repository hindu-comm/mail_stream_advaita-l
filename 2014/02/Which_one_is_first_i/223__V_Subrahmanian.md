We get the above idea in the bhAShya for BG 10.6:

येषां मनूनां महर्षीणां च सृष्टिः लोके इमाः स्थावरजङ्गमलक्षणाः प्रजाः।
।।10.6।।


The above concise statement of Shankara is found elaborated in the
madhusUdani commentary for the above verse:

अतो विशुद्धजन्मत्वेन सर्वप्राणिश्रेष्ठा मत्त एव हिरण्यगर्भात्मनो जाताः
सर्गाद्यकाले प्रादुर्भूताः। येषां महर्षीणां सप्तानां भृग्वादीनां चतुर्णां च
सनकादीनां मनूनां च चतुर्दशानां अस्मिन्ल्लोके जन्मना च विद्यया च सन्ततिभूता
इमा ब्राह्मणाद्याः सर्वाः प्रजाः ।।10.6।।

This means, as Sri Jaldhar concludes,  the entire jiva-mass constituting
the people of the four varNa-s happen to be the descendents both by birth
and by knowledge-receiving,   of the seven mahaRShi-s, the four sanaka-s
(sanaka, sanandana, sanatkumara and sanatsujAta), and the fourteen manu-s.

So, the original question about who came first - the varNa-s or the RShi-s
is answered above:  There is and has to be a simultaneity.  We get a clue
to this in the bhAShya for BG 3.10: along with the yajna-s the prajApati
created the three varNa-s at the beginning = sargAdau = at the beginning of
creation....

We also get this idea in the introduction to the BGB by Shankara, in the
very opening sentences:

That Lord, having created this world, with a view to initiate the
maintenance thereof, created the marIchi, etc. prajApati-s in the beginning
and endowed them with the pravRtti dharma enshrined in the Veda.  Further,
the Lord created the sanaka, sanandana, etc. and endowed them with the
nivRttidharma characterized by jnAna-vairAgyam.  This two-fold dharma is to
be adhered to by the varNa-s consisting of brAhmaNa, etc. for their
ultimate good.
