After all it should be borne in
mind that creation itself is for the jivas to enjoy their karma phalas and
hence has to be in accordance with that purpose.

Yes, you are right prabhuji, Ishwara does the srushti for the jeeva-s' 
karma phala bhOga and gives shareera to jeeva-s accordingly.  prakrutischa 
triguNAtmikA sarvakAryakaraNa vishayAkAreNa pariNatA purushasya 
bhOgApavargArthakartavyatayA deha indiryAdi AkAreNa saMhanyate says 
shankara somewhere in sUtra bhAshya.  though he is Apta kAma he does 
engages himself in srushti kArya for the sake of jeeva-s.  So, jeeva-s 
like us should understand that when shruti says brAhmaNOsya mukhamAsit, 
bAhUrAjanyaH krutaH, UrU tadasya tadvaishyaH, padbhyAguM shUdrO ajAyata 
etc. it is saying like that to maintain the order of the society where 
jeeva has to experience his/her karmaphala.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
