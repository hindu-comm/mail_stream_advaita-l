Dear Sada ji,

In the gloss to the opening mantra bhAShya of the mAnDukyopaniShad, Sri
Anandagiri says: The avyAkRta (mAyA, roughly)is not limited by time since
it is the cause of time too.  He cites a mantra:

//'sasasmvatsaro'bhavan na ha purA tataH samvatsara Asa'  - From this
shruti passage we know that Time originates from the sUtrAtman
(HiraNyagarbha).//

Someone can give reference to this vedic passage and see what sAyNAchArya
 comments.  The rough translation of this sentence is: 'He
(sUtrAtmA/HiraNyagarbha) originated *along with* 'samvatsara', before him
samvatsara was not (existent).'
