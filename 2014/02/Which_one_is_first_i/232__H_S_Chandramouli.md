<< In the book 'srIdakShiNamUrtistotram' Vol.1, p.132 there is a sub-title
''kramasRShTi, yugapatsRShTi.'  There, for the latter, there is a reference
from the kauShItakI upaniShad 3.3 is given:

Quote
yathA agneH jvalataH sarvaa disho visphulingA vipratiShTeran evameva
etasmAt AtmanaH sarve prANA yathAyatanam vipratiShThante prANebhyo devA
devebhyo lokAH.

[Even as sparks proceed in all directions from blazing fire, even so from
this Self the vital breaths proceed to their respective stations, from the
vital powers the Gods (the sense powers) and from the Gods, the worlds.]
Unquote

In the same vein we can see the muNDaka shruti 2.2.1 and a Br.up. mantra
too.>>

Thanks for the clarification. I do not see how this means all craeation
took place simultaneously. I will however try and get at the book referred
to for proper understanding. But I went thru the Mundaka sloka 2.2.1 along
with the bhashya , but did not get the impression that the verse/bhashya
anywhere states that the entire creation takes place simultaneously.

Regards
