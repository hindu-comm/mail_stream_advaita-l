In the book 'srIdakShiNamUrtistotram' Vol.1, p.132 there is a sub-title
''kramasRShTi, yugapatsRShTi.'  There, for the latter, there is a reference
from the kauShItakI upaniShad 3.3 is given:

Quote
yathA agneH jvalataH sarvaa disho visphulingA vipratiShTeran evameva
etasmAt AtmanaH sarve prANA yathAyatanam vipratiShThante prANebhyo devA
devebhyo lokAH.

[Even as sparks proceed in all directions from blazing fire, even so from
this Self the vital breaths proceed to their respective stations, from the
vital powers the Gods (the sense powers) and from the Gods, the worlds.]
Unquote

In the same vein we can see the muNDaka shruti 2.2.1 and a Br.up. mantra
too.
