Dear Sri Ramesh  Badish

<<  For me, it appears that the classification of varnas by Lord came much
later after the creation. Please correct me if I am wrong. >>

It is better to understand it as the Creation coming into being consistent
with the varna classification of the jivas. After all it should be borne in
mind that creation itself is for the jivas to enjoy their karma phalas and
hence has to be in accordance with that purpose.

Regards
