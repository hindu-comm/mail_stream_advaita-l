Since inert by definition cannot say I am there since it is not conscious 
entity.

>  The point I am trying to convey is if at all there is inert that cannot 
exist apart from conscious entity.  Again this would lead us to the 
upanishadic conclusion : brahmaivedamamrutaM purastAt, brahma pashchAt, 
brahma dakshiNOttareNa, adhaschOrdhvaM cha prasrutaM brahmaivedaM 
vishwamidaM varishTaM..And this is what kArika too says : 
tattvamAdhyAtmikaM drushtvA, tattvaM drushvA tu 'bAhyataH'....inert think 
cannot be a diifferent thing from that consciousness...If it is entirely a 
separate from the conscious entity then perception of that inert  is not 
possible...kArya, kAraNa tAdAtmya saMbaNdha..

>  Anyway, this is not a new subject for both of us :-))

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
