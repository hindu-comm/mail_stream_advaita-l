Hare Krishna,

In NArAyaNa upanishad, it is mentioned that Krishna is Brahman.

The thing is he is historical character, Guru, Ishvara and Brahman :)

For symbolic meaning i.e. PanDava - Kaurava are Vritti-s (positive and
negative qualities) and hence persent in mind, is accepted said by Sri
Abhinava Gupta ji in his Gita bhashya in the beginning verses of first
chapter, while Adi shankara accepts that both literal and symbolic meaning
are accepted in his Gita bhashya on chapter 6, mostly in verse 5 or 6 (just
quoting from memory).

In Vishnu Sahasranama bhashya, Adi Shankara interprets the word 23. KeSava
in 3 different ways,

1. The one who has good hair
2. Ke.Sa.a for Brahma vishnu and Mahesh and va for having everything i.e.
all three under his sway (i.e. ParamAtman / Brhaman according to Kanchi
Paramachirya)
3. Killer of demon keSa

Adi Shankara in his intro mentions that

1. Pul-linga (masculine gender) should be interpreted as Vishnu
2. Stri-linga (feminine gender) as deva
3. Napunsaka-linga (neutr gender) as NirguNa Brahman

So one thing can be interpreted in different ways. Please do not ask more
on this to me, I am a noob :)

Hari OM
