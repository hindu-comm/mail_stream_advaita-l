praNAms
Hare Krishna

For that matter, they also ask what is the status of Reality of Lord
Krishna himself . We can answer <<like shruti, he is also mithya >> . 

> If they are asking about  the status of devaki putra, yashOda nandana 
Krishna, that krishna's antya kriya has been performed by arjuna himself 
at the end of dvApara.  yAdavi kalaha is well known for us AFTER 
krishNAvatAra.  So, krishna is a bygone historical character if we go this 
narration.  But if we treat him as  brahman (without considering his janma 
at prison etc.) then he is 'nitya' and NOT mithya.  Because here vAsudeva 
is nothing but the svarUpa of everything.  vAsudevaM sarvasya AtmAnaM 
sarvatra, sarvabhUteshu...says geeta bhAshyakAra. 

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
