HS Chandramouli

Sri Subrahmanianji wrote

<< In the Vivekachudamani we have a verse  नारायणोऽहं नरकान्तकोऽहम्...[I am
nArAyaNa the slayer of naraka/asura] .where it would hardly be correct to
think the name 'nAraayaNa' means the Lord who is the consort of Lakshmi.
In Advaita expressions like  नारायणोऽहं , शिवोऽहम् do not refer to the
personal God.

In the above verse 'nArAyaNa' refers to JnanasvarUpam/akhaNDAkAravRttiH and
'naraka' / narakAsura refers to ignorance/avidyA. >>

I am not interpreting any particular verse or shruti vakyas as referring to
a specific form/name. All I am saying is that in our puranas there are any
number of references to Narayana as residing in Vaikuntha/milky ocean etc.
And many of my friends were keen to know the status of such a personal God
like Narayana in advaita . That is all.
