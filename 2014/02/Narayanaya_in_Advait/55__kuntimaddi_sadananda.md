PraNAms

Advaita says - all names and forms are mithyaa. The adhiShTaam for all names and forms is undifferentiated pure sat chit ananda swaruupam Brahman. One can call whatever name for upaasana with understanding that the ultimate truth is beyond names and forms

That which pervades all names and forms is nameless and formless - Thus one should understand using viveka. 

Adhi shankara has written strotrams on all conceivable forms of Iswara. One can invoke the Lord in any form knowing the form invoked in only symbolism for upaasana. The truth is absolute. 

Hari Om!
Sadananda

 Pranam to all,

 In Advaita, if my understanding is correct, Nirguna Brahman
 is equivalent to Paramatma = Ishwara. Is it also equal to
 Narayanaya ? In the Vaishnava Sampradayas, Narayanaya =
 Vishnu. What has Adi Shankaracharya stated ?

 Dhanyavaad,
 Ravi Chandrasekhara
