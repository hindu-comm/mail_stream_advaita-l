In the vaishnava tradition, one can go to NArAyana only via  Lakshmi hence 
the term Sri Vaishanva as Sri has to come first before Vishnu. 

praNAms
Hare Krishna

In advaita also the above has been said in another way.  Shankara 
somewhere says without this nAmarUpAtmaka jagat one would have not known 
that brahman is prajnAna ghanaM.   (sorry could not recall the exact 
reference  from bhAshya).

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
