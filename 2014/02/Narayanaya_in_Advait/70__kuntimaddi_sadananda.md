Bhaskarji - PraNAms - 

I was not going to respond since any inert is mithyaa only - that includes all BMIs including that of Krishna. It is the existence aspect expresses as the inert material and the existence of the inert has to be established by the knowledge of that existence by a conscious entity. Since inert by definition cannot say I am there since it is not conscious entity.  Consciousness aspect is expressed by its reflection when there is a subtle body, while ananda aspect is expressed mainly in jnaani or in ajnaani as vishayananda  when the longing mind is temporarily satisfied or in deep sleep state discussed in the series of articles. 

Vidyaranya says in dRik dRisya viveka 

asti bhAti priyam rUpam nAmam chatyanca pancakam|
adhyatrayam brahma rUpam jagat rUpam tathAdvayam||

In essence naama and rUpa belongs to the jagat which is mithyaa - the rest belongs to the adhiShTAnam Brahman. 

Hari Om!
Sadananda

 Inert part also is Consciouness
 appearing as inert part only. In its
 entirety. Lord Krishna is I the Consciouness only. That
 applies to shruti
 as well. Please clarify.

 Hare Krishna

 Sri Sada prabhuji might have a different opinion on
 this. But it is 
 better to be noted that Sri brahman is abhinna nimittOpadAna
 kAraNa for 
 this jagat, what appears as inert is also nothing but HIM
 only..tadAtmanaM 
 svayamakuruta, sarvaM khalvidaM brahma, brahmArpaNaM,
 brahmahavi ityAdi 
 shruti and smruti vAkya-s confirm this. There is
 nothing 'apart' from IT.

 Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
 bhaskar
