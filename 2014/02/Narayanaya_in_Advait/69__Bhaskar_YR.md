Inert part also is Consciouness appearing as inert part only. In its
entirety. Lord Krishna is I the Consciouness only. That applies to shruti
as well. Please clarify.

praNAms
Hare Krishna

Sri Sada prabhuji might have a different opinion on this.  But it is 
better to be noted that Sri brahman is abhinna nimittOpadAna kAraNa for 
this jagat, what appears as inert is also nothing but HIM only..tadAtmanaM 
svayamakuruta, sarvaM khalvidaM brahma, brahmArpaNaM, brahmahavi ityAdi 
shruti and smruti vAkya-s confirm this.  There is nothing 'apart' from IT.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
