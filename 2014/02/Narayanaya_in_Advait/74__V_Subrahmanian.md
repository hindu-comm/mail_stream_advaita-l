Actually it was Sri VAchaspasti mishra, the author of the bhAmatI, who used
this word to denote Vedantins.  This is because, all other schools opposed
to vedAnta, such as sAnkhya, nyAya-vaisheshika, yoga, etc. are jagat
satyatva, jIvanAnAtva vAdins.  Vedanta alone differed from them in
proclaiming prapancha mithyAtva and jIvatva mithyAtva and ultimate aikya.
This Vedanta does on the basis of bringing mAyA as per the shruti mAyAm tu
prakRtim vidyAt..etc.  So, mAyAvAdins are vedantins.  Prior to Shankara and
His Acharyas there were no non-adviatic vedantic schools.  So, to
distinguish Vedanta from all non-vedantic schools the term mAyAviAdin was
used.  It later became a term used by non-advaitic vedantins like VA and
Dvaitins to refer derogatorily to Advaita/advaitins.
