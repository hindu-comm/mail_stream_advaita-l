Namaste

The Narayana name is very holy because Mahabharata and Bhagavata say -
Naaraayanam Namaskrutya Naram Chaiva NarOttamam. In Bhagavata the story of
Ajamila is given. He was a great sinner. But he called his son's name
Narayana at the time of death when Yama Dootas were pulling him but God
Narayana protected him.
The Naaraayana Ashtakshari Mantra is compulsory for Vaishnavas. When they
do the Purusha Sukta homa also they say every line from Pursha Sukta and
then Om Namo Naaraayanaaya Swaahaa" after each line. It gives a good effect
for Purusha Sukta Homa.

In Advaita Naaraayana is Brahman only. Narayana Upanishad is saying
'Naaraayana Evedagm Sarvam Yadbhutam Yacca Bhavyam. Nishkalo Niranjano
Nirvikalpo Niraakhyaataha Shuddho Deva Eko Naaraayanaha. Na Dviteeyo Asti
Kashchit. Ya Evam Veda. Sa Vishnureva Bhavati. Sa Vishnureva Bhavati.
Everything in past, present and future is Naraayaana only. He who knows
this becomes Vishnu. He becomes Vishnu. The Naaraayana Ashtakshara is given
next by the Upanishad.
