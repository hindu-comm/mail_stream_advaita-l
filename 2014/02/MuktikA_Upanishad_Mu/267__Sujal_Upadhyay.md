Ramakrishna had guru, but not during his first sadhana, when the Guru is
most needed. When he had darshan of Maa Kali for first time, he did not
have any Guru, later to establish other paths, he had accepted Guru as per
divine instructions.

I understand what you say and I know that you are not contradicting me.
What I am saying is that generally mind cannot remain stuck into the source
(heart) for long time. Even one mahavakya is enough - is theoretically
true, but I do not think that any human is capable of attain moksha just by
holding to a single thought - I am Brahman. For avatars, anything is
possible :) Laymen do not live on intuitions. We do have thoughts.

With OM, it is different. You have an adhara of mantra. So thoughts,
mantra, thoughts mantra, silence ... -- this continues. It is comparatively
easy. Neti-Neti is difficult than meditating on OM and holding to just one
mahavakya is still more difficult. Infact, I am not aware of any saint who
got realized just by holding to one mahavakya. In neti-neti, you are free
to use as many words as you like or do Self enquiry.

Brother, in meditation, one is generally trying to steady mind and uproot
desires of this life. What about up-rooting desires of past lives? Only
when the vessel has no holes i.e. when nothing of day-2-day life enters
your mind i.e. influences you, then desires of past life begin to uproot.
In this state, mind remains stuck in source and is overpowered by source,
something very deep, strong (Brahman). Then progress is fast as desires are
uprooted very fast. Such a person is rare and achieves success in short
period of time.

Once it is realized in meditation that this world is nothing but projection
of mind and that desires do not have a specific shape, but are unstable
force (energy, shakti), then you enter into thoughtless state, full of
bliss. I do not mean no thoughts, but before thoughts (and desires) take
shape and create a scene or an image, it is uprooted by someone else
(Paramantman) and you as an individual have not hand in this entire
process. It all happens by grace of God. Hence no saint will claim his
credit in success. He will not say, I will remove all obstacles in your
life, surrender to me and you will be free, etc. He will keep directing you
to God.

I am finding it difficult to express. I was never good in expressing myself
:)
