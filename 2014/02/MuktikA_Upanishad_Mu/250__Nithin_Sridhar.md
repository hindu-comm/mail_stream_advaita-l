I am convinced that there were 2 Shankaracharya. The one we know about from
all his works bhashyas & stotras and other works is the recent one of
700-800 AD and there was one more older Shankara, about whom we know
nothing much and whose no works have survived.

Sometime in history, the both version have got mixed up!.

This is my personal opinion though!
