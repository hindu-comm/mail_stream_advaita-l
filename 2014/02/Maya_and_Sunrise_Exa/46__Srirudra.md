Dear Sri Suresh
I do not agree.Sunrise is true as perceived by the eyes.But it's cause is different.Sun is stationary but earth's rotation about its axis causes the phenomenon.One can not say there is no sunrise.Rope snake is more appropriate for wrong perception.R.Krishnamoorthy.

Rope-snake example leads to the problem: there is an error in perception, which is later on corrected. In sunrise example, there is no error in perception. According to perception - which is never corrected - sun rises, period.

Also that if something is perceived, it doesn't necessarily have to be true. Sunrise (jagat) is clearly perceived, yet it is false. Earth's movement (Brahman) is not perceived, yet it is true.
