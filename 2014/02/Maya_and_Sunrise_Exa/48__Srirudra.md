Dear Sri Sadananda
Mirage water is no water.It is an illusion.But sunrise or sunset are real in the sense that they are true phenomenon.I think adhyaasa is applicable to Mirage water or necre in a shell .But in sun rise there is no error in perception. Sun does rise if the motion of earth's rotation is transferred to sun as we work in relative velocity problems.R.Krishnamoorthy.
