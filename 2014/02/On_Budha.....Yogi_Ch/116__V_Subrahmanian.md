Namaskarams.  I had, in the past, written something about this shlokam that
you mentioned to me.  I am copying the related discussion on this:

edition of the complete works of Shankaracharya.  I doubt if it is
genuine.  Even when Gaudapadacharya gives (albeit backhanded) praise to the
Buddha in the Mandukya karikas, Shankaracharya does not follow suit and I'm
not aware of any other place where he speaks of the Buddha in a positive
way or even at all.  (Most of his engagement with Buddhists is with much
later philosophers.) Neither as far as I know has this stotra been
commented on by later Advaitins such as Anandagiri or Svayamprakasha.
While not a clincher this would be very unlikely if this was an original
work of Shankaracharya. Radhakrishnan had some scholarly credentials but he
was first and foremost a politician and this wouldn't be the first time he
distorted the truth to fit his personal agenda. -- Jaldhar H. Vyas <jaldhar

With reference to the above topic regarding Shankara's praise for Buddha in
"Dashavatarastotram",there cannot be a greater blasphemy than this.As is
well known from the Brahmasutrabhashya,his discussions regarding Buddhistic
"purva paksha"in Brahma sutra in "Abhavadhikarana",in the sutras "Naabhavah
upalabdeh",Na bhavo anupalabdeh","vaidharmyacca na svapnadivat"and
examination of Buddhism in "Brahadaranyaka Upanishad Bhashya"and in other
bhashyas of Upanishads, and the consequent observations of Shankara that if
these diverse views of Buddha stated by different branches of Buddhism
like,"sarvastivada"Vaibhasikas and srautrantikas,and the sunya vadins,one
cannot but come to the conclusion that the Buddha taught these
contradictory views out of enemity to the People(prajapadveshi).Hence the
seekers  who are on the path of "goodness"(shreyaskamah)must  ignore this
to a greater extent.(BSB).


Here is the complete shloka:

Traditionally this work is not admitted to be of Shankaracharya.
