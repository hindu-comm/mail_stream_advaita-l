2. Sushupti. According to traditional views ajnana which is the cause for
bandha is present in sushupti. But according to Sri SSS there is neither
avidya nor adhyasa  separate from the atman in sushupti.

A line of clarification here required from Sri SSS's perspective.  Though 
based on shankara/shruti Sri SSS insists the ekatva in sushupti, he does 
not anywhere says, "go to sushupti and get mOksha" :-)  In one of his 
works he says vidyeinda mAtrave avidyA nivrutti, nidre indalla :-)) (only 
vidyA can efface avidyA not from sleep )  So, though there is ekatva in 
sushupti, Sri SSS admits the agrahaNAtmaka avidyA (jnAnAbhAva) for the 
sushuptAtma during this ekatva.  This jnAnAbhAva is not a hindrance to the 
ekatva in sushpti.  It is just like sitting on the treasure without 
knowing it !!  Here we cannot argue that there is NO treasure (ekatva) at 
all since we donot know it (jnAnAbhAva)!! :-))  Hence not knowing 
(jnAnAbhAva) and ekatva can exist together in sushupti.  But mUlAvidyA 
which Sri SSS is refuting here is not mere jnAnAbhAva it is bhAva rUpa 
avidyA which is the upAdAna kAraNa to all three types of avidyA i.e. 
agrahaNa, anyathAgrahaNa and saMshaya. Anyway, IMHO, it is not worth our 
time to spend on this issue anymore  coz. ultimately what we get from the 
discussion is only heat not light :-))
