HS Chandramouli

Dear Sri Bhaskarji,

praNAms Sri ChadramouLi prabhuji
Hare Krishna

I am just asking out of curiosity and also perhaps it may help in 
resolving
the status of the issues raised by you. Are you basing your comments on 
the
views promoted by Swami Sri Sachidanandendra Saraswathi of Holenarsipur,
Karnataka.

>  It is an open secret in this forum (as well as in other forum) that I 
am one of the few followers of Sri SSS & more vociferous than others and 
often subject to firing from prabhuji-s of this list, and lost the love of 
somany good prabhuji-s of this. It is due to this situation,  I cannot 
openly and regularly associate my understanding of advaita with Sri SSS 
like others who often comfortably quote their guruji-s like Sri 
chinmayananda, Sri paramArthananda, Sri Dayananada Saraswati, Sri Mani 
dravida shastrigaL etc. It is because, Sri SSS is not in the good books of 
some traditional advaitins since he questions vyAkhyAnakAra-s commentaries 
with regard to the true representation of shankara's advaita :-)) For this 
reason only I always try to quote bhagavatpAda directly without bringing 
in Sri SSS's purports. 

>  Whatever it may be, you can be rest assured that after sincere guidance 
/ bAla pAtha  from Sri Vidya shankara prabhuji and Sri Jaldhar Vyas 
prabhuji of this forum I started reading / following shankara philosophy 
through Sri SSS's works and direct interaction / learning from  his direct 
disciples.

>  I am sorry if I disappointed you by saying I am a follower of Sri SSS 
:-))

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
