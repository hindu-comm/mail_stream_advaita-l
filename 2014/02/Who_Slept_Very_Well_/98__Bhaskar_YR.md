The write up is mostly based on Pancadashi 11th ch. of Shree Vidyaranya - 
obviously comes under later aachaaryas after Shankara bhagavat paada. 
However Vidyaranya quotes Shruti statements to justify his writings. 


praNAms Sri Sada prabhuji
Hare Krishna

Kindly pardon me prabhuji, if you are basing your understanding on 
sushupti from the ONLY work called pachadashi 11 chapter, I will not be 
able to comment anything on that prakaraNa grantha and your understanding 
of the same.  After all it is your convinction based on that prakaraNa 
grantha, how can I differ from it ??  If anything that can be discussed in 
a meaningful way, we need to have a common premise i.e. shankara's 
prasthAna traya bhAshya or atleast those shruti vAkya-s that say in 
sushupti there exists mind, upAdhi, objects, ajnAna  like pitch darkness 
etc. etc. 

Anyway, thanks for spending your time with me prabhuji. And still would 
like to say your whole series of article is simply fabulous !!

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
