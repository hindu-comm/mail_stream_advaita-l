Lord Krishna was a Brahmachari. Manu Smriti says that a married person can be called a Bramachari and he said who qualifies for that. Adi Shankara was also a Brahmachari and his vrata remained unbroken.

Dear Praveen,

May you live long!

Some are ever-ready to accept Krishna playing around with the Gopis as not in any way a violation of Brahmacharya, but when Sankara does something similar by traversing bodies, they feel the need to subject that incident to "in-depth analysis" :-)

Put very bluntly - Krishna violated Brahmacharya at least in Kaya and Vacha, but Sankara did not!

BTW, Sankara says in the Dig-Vijaya, "I am like Mahavishnu", implying that He is also Ishvara in human form.
