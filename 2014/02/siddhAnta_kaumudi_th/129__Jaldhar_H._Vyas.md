I don't think so.  The Gaudiya Jiva Goswami wrote a grammar called hari 
nama amrta where all the technical terms are names of Krshna.  I don't 
know if the explanations, if any, are from the gita or bhagavata etc. they 
might be.  Actually I don't think the gita would make a good source for 
learning grammar per se because the itihasa and puranas in general tend to 
use very simple language.  It is good text to practice with though.


There is an ingenious mahakavya called Ravanavadha or Bhatti kavya (after 
its author.  Bhatti is supposed to be the prakrit name of the famous 
grammarian Bhartrahari.) This tells the story of the Ramayana and 
simultaneously explains all the paninian sutras.

I have this and its a very good edition but it doesn't use the gita for 
its examples.
