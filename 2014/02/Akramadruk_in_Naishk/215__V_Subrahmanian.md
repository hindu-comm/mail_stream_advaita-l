Dear Bhaskar ji,

I think you did not get the meaning of the kArikA bhAshya in reference: It
is not the prapancha/jIva viShaya jnAna (which is of Ishwara, sarvam
vishESheNa vEtti) but the jnaH is also the sarva.  Here there is no
prapancha nAnAtva viShaya jnAnam but the bAdhita sarva jnAnam as taught by
Shankara in the brahmArpaNam verse: the rajata abhAva jnAnam in shukti.  It
is the adhiShThAna jnana which is characterized by the abhAva of prapancha
bthat is referred by the term sarvajnatA.  In this bhashyam Shankara says turye
viditE svayameva AtamasvarUpameva sarvajnatA -  remember the seventh mantra
definition of turiya has the word 'prapanchopashamam'.  So, the jnAna
referred here is not about the prapancha, which, on the contrary, is the
case with Ishwara's sarvajnatA.  Ishwara's is not the prapanchopashamam
jnAna but saprapancha jnAna.  Otherwise he cannot be called Ishwara.
