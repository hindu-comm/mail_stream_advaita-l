In this bhashyam Shankara says turye
viditE svayameva AtamasvarUpameva sarvajnatA -  remember the seventh 
mantra
definition of turiya has the word 'prapanchopashamam'. 

praNAms Sri subbu prabhuji
Hare Krishna

I think we are digressing the main question of Sri Venkatesh Murthy 
prabhuji and again starting on brahman's sarvajnatva :-))  Anyway, what 
exactly does it mean when it is said  prapanchOpashamanaM in tureeya ?? 
And what exactly is the difference between upAdhi upashamana, antaHkaraNa 
upashamana in prAjnA in sushupti and prapanchOpashamanaM in tureeya??  do 
you think tureeya would experience the atyanta abhAva of prapancha or it 
is mere upashamanaM  as we see in prAjna with regard to upAdhi in 
sushupti??  And I am still at loss how come the term 'sarva' can intrude 
in tureeya when he is neither antaH prajnA, nor bahirprajna nor prajnAna 
ghana etc. ??  Have you said anywhere in your previous mails about 
sarvajnatA svarUpa of Atman (OK not Ishwara's like sarvajnatvaM) when you 
earlier vehemently argued that 'sarva' can be attributed ONLY to saguNa 
brahman and who is vyAvahArika satya whereas jneya brahman is kevala jnAna 
svarUpa??  When I quoted Itareya and bhAshya at that time also you 
comfortably given convoluted interpretation of that bhAshya vAkya & hardly 
spoken about the sarvajnatva of Atman in one or the other form !!??  So, 
it is still difficult for me to understand your position prabhuji. 
Perhaps, a detailed write up with regard to Atman's sarvajnatva & 
Ishwara's sarvajnatva would be beneficial to all of us to understand about 
the existence of two different sarvajna-s :-))  Hope you would do the 
needful. 

If you want you can change the subject heading so that we can discuss all 
these in a separate thread, ofcourse if my time permits for the continuity 
of this thread :-))

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
