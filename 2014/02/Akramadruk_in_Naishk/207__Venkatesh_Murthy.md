Namaste

I downloaded the Paribhashika Shabda Kosha from Holenarsipur SSS webiste.
It is like a Dictionary of Advaita.

There is a word I did not understand. It is Akramadruk in Niashkarmya
Siddhi 2-69.

SSS has given the definition Yugapadeva Svaprakaashena Tadavasthenaiva
Sarvaa Dhiyaha Prakaashayati. Atma knows all the objects of senses
simultaneeously and not one by one.

Kindly explain what is this Akramadruk Atma in Naishkarmya Siddhi. How can
Atma become a Knower of objects?
