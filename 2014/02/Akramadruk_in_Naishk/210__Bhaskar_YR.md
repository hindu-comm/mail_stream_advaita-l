Namaste

Sometime back we had the discussion. Atma cannot be Sarvajna truly. 

>  OK no more arguments on this issue and I admit that I donot know the 
meaning of this vAkya : yasyAtmanOvijneyaM na kiMchit parishishyate sa 
AtmA sarvajnaH :-))

It can
have Samanya Jnana of everything but not Visesha Jnana. 

>  vishesha jnAna required for us (upAdhi paricchinna jeeva-s) to do 
vyavahAra not for the Atman since in Atman there is no duality,no 
vyavahAra..neha nAnAsti kiMchana.

If you go into a
room you may see 100 objects. You can say you have Jnana the objects are
existing. Sarvam Khalvidam Brahma.  But you cannot say you know what is
each and every object and its particular details.

>  again each & every object's vishesha jnAna (like this is bangle, this 
is ring, this is bracelet, this is coin etc.) required in vyavahAra where 
there is triputi i.e. jnAtru, jneya and jnAna.  But sAmAnya jnAna that it 
is gold is enough to know that whatever is there is gold only.  vishesha 
jnAna is required to do vyavahAra & this is called vyavahAra drushti, 
sAmAnya behind this vishesha is tattva drushti and that is what samyak 
drushti. 

Sri Sureshwara is saying Atma is Akramadruk. He can have the Samanya Jnana
of all objects simultaneously and not one object by one object in 
sequence.
There is no Krama for Samanya Jnana.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
