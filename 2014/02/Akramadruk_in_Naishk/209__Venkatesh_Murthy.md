Namaste

Sometime back we had the discussion. Atma cannot be Sarvajna truly. It can
have Samanya Jnana of everything but not Visesha Jnana. If you go into a
room you may see 100 objects. You can say you have Jnana the objects are
existing. Sarvam Khalvidam Brahma.  But you cannot say you know what is
each and every object and its particular details.

Sri Sureshwara is saying Atma is Akramadruk. He can have the Samanya Jnana
of all objects simultaneously and not one object by one object in sequence.
There is no Krama for Samanya Jnana.
