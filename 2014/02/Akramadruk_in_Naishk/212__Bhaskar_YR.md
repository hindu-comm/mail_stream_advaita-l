He knows everything as Brahman and truly everything is Brahma. We say Atma
is Sarvajna. But Sarvajnatva of Atma is not like Ishwara's Sarvajnatva. 
You
can ask Ishwara how many total hairs are on ALL the people's heads or any
individual person also.  He will give the answer. But not Atma.

:-) OK prabhuji I agree...Atma is sarvajna but this sarvajnatva is not 
similar to that of Ishwara and Ishwara's sarvajnatva is more perfect & 
accurate (like counting & giving correct number of hairs)  whereas Atman's 
is NOT :-)  Thanks for your clarification.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
