When you say Atma is Sarvajna it is not Sarvajna like Ishwara. Ishwara is
Sarvajna because he knows each and every detail of everything in the world.

But Atma Brahma is not like Sarvajna like that. He knows everything in the
Universe is not different from Him. Everything is Brahman only. It is
sufficient to know everything is Brahman. This Knowledge is Sarvajnatva.

 He knows everything as Brahman and truly everything is Brahma. We say Atma
is Sarvajna. But Sarvajnatva of Atma is not like Ishwara's Sarvajnatva. You
can ask Ishwara how many total hairs are on ALL the people's heads or any
individual person also.  He will give the answer. But not Atma.
