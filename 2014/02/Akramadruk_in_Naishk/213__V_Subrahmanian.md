In the munDaka mantra 'yaH sarvajnaH sarvavit yasya jnAnamayam tapaH..'
Shankara gives the meanings:  'sAmAnyena sarvam jAnAti iti sarvajnaH',
'visheSheNa sarvam vEtti iti sarvavit'.  Both these attributes are there
for the sarvajna saguNa Ishwara.

The kArikA / bhAShya 4.89 too specify another type of sarvajnatA:

turye viditE svayameva AtamasvarUpameva sarvajnatA - sarvaH cha asau jnaH
cha tasya bhAvaH sarvajnatA - It/the Pure Consciousness - is at the same
time 'everything' and 'knower'.  Here, the reference is not to the
Ishwara's sarvajnatva of the munDaka mantra shown above.  This is the
realized person's Atmic condition of Pure Consciousness, sarvAtmabhAva.
The first sarvajnatva is mAyopAdhika and the second one is nirupAdhika
svarUpa sarvajnatA.
