second one is nirupAdhika svarUpa sarvajnatA.

Hare Krishna

Let us examine the first quoted mundaka sarvajna whether it is sOpAdhika 
or otherwise  later!!?? The second one i.e.  kArika/bhAshya's sarvajna 
which you are telling is nirupAdhika but svarUpa is 'sarva'jnatA...Hope 
you remember your arguments with regard to the term 'sarva' with regard to 
nirupAdhika, vishesha rahita parabrahman...Hope you also remember your 
arguments with regard to svabhAva, svarUpa, usage of pullinga, mAdukya 
maNtra -6 prAjna (sarvajna) and maNtra 7 (tureeya - sarvadrik, 
sarvalokeshwara) etc.  Now, you are telling us svarUpa of nirupAdhika pure 
consciousness is sarvajnatA.  May I know what exactly your stand on this 
prabhuji??

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
