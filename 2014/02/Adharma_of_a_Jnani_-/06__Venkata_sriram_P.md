Namaste,

........
Jnani performing apparent adharma with his present body
.........

It seems adharma for we ajnAnis whereas the jnAnis are beyond dharma & 
adharma.  Even lalita-sahasranAma says "dharmAdharma-vivarjitA".

So, even if there would be a forceful pravrutti in jnAnis, it would be
only for lOka-kalyANa only.  kriSNa was the driving force in
mahAbhArata war which was for dharma-vijaya etc. 

regs,
sriram
