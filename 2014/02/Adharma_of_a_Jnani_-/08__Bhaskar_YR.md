If someone performs adharma and claims to be a Jnani, it is perfectly fair 
to expect them to perform Miracles too.


Because: the Jnanis in the Itihasas and Puranas adhere to Dharma only. In 
the rare instances that they do not adhere to Dharma, they have shown 
their ability to perform Miracles.

Kindly pardon me prabhuji.  Frankly I am not able to understand the 
relevance between miracles & jnAni-s avyavahAra. Does it not convey the 
wrong message that those who can perform miracles can some time indulge in 
questionable activities and still maintain their jnAni-hood intact??  For 
that matter, you would agree with me that all siddha purusha-s (those who 
gained occult powers like aNimAdi siddhi-s through ashtAnga yOga, tantra 
sAdhana etc.) are NOT paramArtha jnAni-s and paramArtha jnAni is not 
always a siddha purusha.  Under these circumstances, how can we bridge 
relation between jnAni and miracles??  am I missing something here 
prabhuji??  Kindly clarify.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
