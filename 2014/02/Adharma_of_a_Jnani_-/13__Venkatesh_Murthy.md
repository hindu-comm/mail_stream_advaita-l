> In the Sankara Digvijaya it is said 'VajroliyogapratibhU Sa Esha
Vatsavakirnitvaviparyayoho Naha'. The Vajroli practice will maintain
Brahmacharya.* If* a Brahmacharya has sex there is no loss for him if he is
expert in Vajroli. But Adi Sankara entered into King's body and enjoyed
with women in King's body. He knew Vajroli. There is no loss of
Brahmacharya.

I think in Vajroli practice they will draw up the Veerya even if comes out.
I am not sure how can they do it? Any answers?
