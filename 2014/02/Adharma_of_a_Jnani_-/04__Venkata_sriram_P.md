Namaste,

................
However, there are many cases where a Jnani may perform an act 
that a common man *perceives* as apparently Adharmic. 
..............

This seemingly, apparent adhArmic act,as perceived by common, ignorant
man is called prArabdha of jnAni. 

Whatever a jnAni does is for lOka-kalyANa only because in him there
are no rAga,dvESa, pramAda, ahamkAra & mamkAra owing to his 
tapasya before the dawn of self-knowledge. 

Shri.Gangadharendra Saraswati in "swarAjya-siddhi" says:

rAga lObha pramAdadi dOsha kSayAnnAyamAsajjatE dushcharitrE kvachit
sAdhuvatsAdhu chAritryarakSAparaH sAdhumArgENa samskAratO vartatE

A brahmavEtta never practices nishiddha-karma / AcharaNa.  Owing to
pUrva-karma-samskAra, he treads the path of sadAchAra. 

Sri.Sureshwaracharya, too, in naishkarmya-siddhi says this as:

buddhAdwaitasatattvasya yathESTAcharaNaM yadi
shunA tattvadruSAM chaiva kO bhEdO(a)shuchibhakSaNE

If a jnAni adopts "swEcchAchAra" and eats nishiddha-padArtha, then
what is the difference between that jnAni and a street dog. 

HOWEVER, 

Sri.Gangadharendra Saraswati explains that not all jnAnis behave in a similar fashion.
These different exhibits of jnAnis is owing to what is called "prArabdha" of that jnAni.

kEpi varNAshramAchAra niSTA parA mugdha bAla pramattOpamAshchAparE
rAgiNO bhOginO yOginashchEtarE jnAninAM lakSyatE naikarUpA sthitiH

And hence, we can't comprehend the jnAni-charya with our minds.  We cannot
perceive the jnAni-charya with the colored spectacles.  

Sri.Gangadharendra Saraswati says:

The path / charya of jnAni is beyond comprehension of ordinary mortals which is
like the "swim of fish in waters" and "flight of birds in the sky"

matsyAnaM salilEmbarE cha vayasAM vAyOrivASAmukhE 
durlakSyE pathiyOginAM bahuvidhA gUDA vichitrA gatiH

The jnAni-charya is "bahuvidhA gUDA vichitrA gatiH".

regs,
sriram
