Pranams, 


I think that those who who claim to be Jnanis but follow adharmic ways may perform some so-called miracles just to impress the laymen of their superiority, but they are not actually the self-realized jnanis, but just above the ordinary rank and file of mankind, just like a hypnotist or a mesmerizer is. A self-realized Jnani CAN NOT afford to be adharmic, as his very nature becomes the embodiment of dharma, Otherwise, he can not claim any right to Jnana as such. My humble Pranams to all the members. Ramesh

If someone performs adharma and claims to be a Jnani, it is perfectly fair 
to expect them to perform Miracles too.


Because: the Jnanis in the Itihasas and Puranas adhere to Dharma only. In 
the rare instances that they do not adhere to Dharma, they have shown 
their ability to perform Miracles.

Kindly pardon me prabhuji. Frankly I am not able to understand the 
relevance between miracles & jnAni-s avyavahAra. Does it not convey the 
wrong message that those who can perform miracles can some time indulge in 
questionable activities and still maintain their jnAni-hood intact?? For 
that matter, you would agree with me that all siddha purusha-s (those who 
gained occult powers like aNimAdi siddhi-s through ashtAnga yOga, tantra 
sAdhana etc.) are NOT paramArtha jnAni-s and paramArtha jnAni is not 
always a siddha purusha. Under these circumstances, how can we bridge 
relation between jnAni and miracles?? am I missing something here 
prabhuji?? Kindly clarify.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
