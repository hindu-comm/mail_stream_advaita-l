The main reason for my writing these posts on Jnanis and Miracles is this:


If someone performs adharma and claims to be a Jnani, it is perfectly fair to expect them to perform Miracles too.


Because: the Jnanis in the Itihasas and Puranas adhere to Dharma only. In the rare instances that they do not adhere to Dharma, they have shown their ability to perform Miracles.
