praNAms Sri Karthik prabhuji
Hare Krishna

ALL the Jnanis in the Itihasas and Puranas have aligned themselves to 
Dharma only.

>  Yes, thanks for this clarification.  The jnAni cannot indulge in 
adharmic vyavahAra coz. he has the realization that even dhArmic karma-s 
are within the sphere of avidyA.  shankara gives an example and clarifies 
that jnAni never ever engages himself in adhArmic vyavahAra. 

Firstly, Sankara's taking up another's body itself is at the height of 
one's yogic powers. Can an ordinary man leave his body and take on the 
body of a dead man? This is impossible for any of us - but Sankara was 
able to do so. He learned the art of love and returned to his original 
body. One must remember that he did this also only for the sake of Dharma 
- because he had to defeat Ubhaya Bharati before he could establish the 
doctrine of Advaita Vedanta. 

>  I know this is off the topic.  One of my mAdhva prabhuji-s in one of 
his personal exchanges with me asked me a question :  Since shankara opted 
for another body to learn kAma shAstra but used his own antaHkaraNa, he 
cannot  be called a celibate who observed brahmacharya in vAcha and 
manasa.  Anyway, since I myself doubt these episodes for one or the other 
reason and accepts the poetic exaggeration in these biographies, I told 
him I donot have answer to this type of questions.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
