Yes. This project is likely to take real shape soon.  I made the
announcement of the hard copies for these reasons:

Just two years ago when I had mentioned about the book in a discussion
group several members contacted the Sringeri maTha and procured the copies
and quickly thereby exhausted the stock at the maTha.  This was despite the
possibility of digitization, though I do not know whether the DLI had these
then itself.  Several people, despite digitization, prefer to have / read
from hard copies.  The print industry survives because such clients are
there.

Just last week a gentleman, in his mid seventies, requested me for a xerox
copy of this book and when I told him about the forthcoming digitization he
replied: 'I do have a computer but I do not touch it.  I prefer to read
from a book.'  I did oblige him with his requirement and satisfied his
'greed' of having the 'naishkarmyasiddhi' with Dr.R.Balasubramanian's
translation too in xerox. Over the last few years I have myself given
xeroxed copies of this book to at least half a dozen interested persons.

So, even if the downloadable version is available, some finding the process
daunting and then, if needed, finding the process of taking printouts and
having a bound book laborious and expensive paper-wise, prefer to buy a
readily available book.

One person, in the UK, wants this book in hard bound form for his
institutional library and does not mind paying for the book and the
postage.
