The book titled 'srI-dakShiNAmUrti-stotram' authored by Rev. (late) Sri
D.S.Subbaramaiya, in English, is a very detailed exposition of the famous
hymnal work of Sri Shankaracharya.  The exposition is an extensive study
based on the commentaries 'mAnasollAsa' and 'tattvasudhA' supported by a
number of citations from very important and rare classical Sanskrit texts
on Advaita.  Every such citation is given with the English translation. The
work has received great appreciation from scholars, researchers and
sAdhakas.  It covers the entire range of topics in Advaita Vedanta, with
authority from the commentaries of Sri Shankaracharya too on the
upanishads, brahmasutras and the Bh.GeethA.

The book was published by the Sringeri Sharada PeeTham with a benedictory
foreword by the previous Jagadguru Sri Abhinava Vidyateertha SwaminaH.
