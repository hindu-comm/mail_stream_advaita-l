Dear Srinivasanji,

Namaskaram! Could you please arrange me a photostat set of the said title on the Daksinamurtistotram of the Acharya (It would be convenient if you could get me a soft-binding copy instead of the spiral one).

Pls let me know the amount required to be sent. Can I transfer it to your bank A/C?

Sincerely yours,
Niranjan Saha

The book titled 'srI-dakShiNAmUrti-stotram' authored by Rev. (late) Sri
D.S.Subbaramaiya, in English, is a very detailed exposition of the famous
hymnal work
 of Sri Shankaracharya. The exposition is an extensive study
based on the commentaries 'mAnasollAsa' and 'tattvasudhA' supported by a
number of citations from very important and rare classical Sanskrit texts
on Advaita. Every such citation is given with the English translation. The
work has received great appreciation from scholars, researchers and
sAdhakas. It covers the entire range of topics in Advaita Vedanta, with
authority from the commentaries of Sri Shankaracharya too on the
upanishads, brahmasutras and the Bh.GeethA.

The book was published by the Sringeri Sharada PeeTham with a benedictory
foreword by the previous Jagadguru Sri Abhinava Vidyateertha SwaminaH.

Since it is not in print currently, a few xeroxed copies of the two-volume
book (totaling about 1200 pages), spiral-bound,are available with the
contact person shown below. The price of the two-volume set is
 Rs.450
only. Those in Bangalore can choose to collect the book personally and
those requiring the set to be sent to their address will have to pay the
postage charges which will be extra.

For your requirement pl. contact: Sri K.Srinivasan   email
srinivasan.rbi at gmail.com  phone: 9448810668 [Bangalore, India]

Pl. inform your friends, institutions, libraries that would be benefiting
from the Book.

regards
