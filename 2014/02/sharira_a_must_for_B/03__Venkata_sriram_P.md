Namaste,

bhagavAn rAmachandra while performing dahana samskAra to bird jaTAyu says:

sarvatra khalu drushyantE sAdhavO dharmachAriNaH
shUrAH sharaNyAH saumitrE tiryagyOni gatESvapi .........3.68.24

So, sAdhu-purushAs, dharmaparAyaNAs etc. are also found in tiryak-yOnIs too ! 
It is not necessary that one has to take a human form.  However, as Sri.Subbuji said,
shravaNa, manana & nidhidhyAsana is easy for humans.

regs,
sriram
