Namaste.
 In Vivekachoodamani we have the verse Janthoonaam narajanma dhurlabham........
wherein the importance of a Narajanma is stressed.

Does one require a sharira (body) for Brahma Jnana?
We have heard that King Janaka got jnana from formless yogis. If one can be helpful in giving jnana in a formless state, can one take them too while formless? Or is it that one has to take a human form and do shravana , manana and nidhidhyasana to obtain Jnana?
What do the scriptures have to sayabout this?

Thanking in advance,
humbly,
sumitha
