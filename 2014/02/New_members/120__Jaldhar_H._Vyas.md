Cecilia San Miguel
------------------

Although I have been involved in serious spiritual seeking for the past 26
years, in July 2013, I was introduced in a most unusual manner to the
teachings of Sri Ramana Maharshi.  Advaita Vedanta resonated deep in my
heart, and I knew then that all my striving had finally taken me to this
most profound truth.

I live in a rural community in Arizona lacking in these teachings or support. 
Recently, I travelled to India, but even there I discovered that the most 
ardent religious practices were only obscuring that supreme path of 
self-inquiry leading to liberation to which the Maharshi dedicated his life - 
to his last breath.

I found this site to be a blessing - I can begin serious studies 
systematically as taught by Sankara. I am in the process of translating 
"Vivekachudamani" or "The Crest Jewel of Discrimination" into Spanish from the 
book "Ramana, Shankara and the Forty Verses, The Essential Teachings of 
Advaita".
