Shankaracharya translates it as "understood/realized".

i.e. When the Completeness of the Jagat is realized, Completeness alone
remains.

Can anyone shed more light on this?

Yes, nothing can exist apart from Atma...Realization of this is called 
sarvAtma bhAva or samyak drushti This samyak drushti will not be there 
before dawn of jnAna, hence ajnAni thinks that this is apUrNaM, asarvaM 
etc. But after realization of the secondless Atman, he realizes that this 
asarvaM is nothing but sarvaM and this sarvaM is nothing but HIM.  pUrvaM 
avidyayA asarva Aseet punaH vidyayA avidyApanaye sarvO bhavati clarifies 
shankara in prasha bhAshya.

But from this we should not infer that since jagat is vikArAtmaka, brahman 
too vakAri...no, not like that, brahma svabhAvO hi prapanchaH na prapancha 
svabhAvaM brahma.  ring & bangle is gold only but gold as it is neither 
ring nor bangle...it is always nirguNa and nirvishesha.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
