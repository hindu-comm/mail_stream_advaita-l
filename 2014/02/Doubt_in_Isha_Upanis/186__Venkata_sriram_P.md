Namaste Nitin Ji,

The meaning "gruheetvA" is correct. The Apte gives the meanings
as to receive, having taken.  

Popular example is "jalam Adaaya" ;

There is a popular sloka for Hanuman Ji which starts with

"ullanghya sindhOh salilam saleelam....
.....Adaaya tEnEva dadaaha lankaam
namaami praanjalim AnjanEyam"

Here, the sloka says that Sri.Hanuman Ji, "having accepted,
received, taken" the shOka-agni of Mother Sita, burnt the Lanka
with the same fire.

So, "gruheetvA" is correct.  

regs,
sriram
