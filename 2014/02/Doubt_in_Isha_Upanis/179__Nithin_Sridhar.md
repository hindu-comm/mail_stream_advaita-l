In the Shanti Mantra of Isha Upanishad,



*purnam adah, purnam idam purnat purnam udachyate; purnasya purnam adaya
purnam evavasisyate*
The term "adaaya" is everywhere interpreted as "removed/taken away". But,
Shankaracharya translates it as "understood/realized".

i.e. When the Completeness of the Jagat is realized, Completeness alone
remains.

Can anyone shed more light on this?

-Regards.
