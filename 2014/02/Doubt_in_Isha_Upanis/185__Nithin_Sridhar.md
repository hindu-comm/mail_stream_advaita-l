Subrahmanian ji,

Let me re-phrase my query-

If, Aadaya is taken as removed, then in the sentence, Purnasya Poornam
Aadaya, Poornasya must refer to Nirguna Brahman/Paramartika Dasha i.e.
(Even) after taken out the Jagat from Brahman, Brahman alone remains.

or

if Aadaya is taken as "realized", then Poornasya must refer to Saguna
Brahman or the Jagat, i.e. Having realized the Completeness of the Jagat
(i.e. having realized that duality perceived is only due to illusion which
in Reality is Brahman itself), Completeness alone remains.

Hence, though ultimately we have same meaning that Brahman alone exist, if
we use different meaning for aadaya, we must understand the term poornasya
differently.

Or am I getting something wrong here?
