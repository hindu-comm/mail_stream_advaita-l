Bhaskarji - PraNAms

You can find some of my postings in facebook under two headings - kuntimaddi Sadananda and Acharya Sadananda, and yu-tube talks at 
<http://www.youtube.com/user/AcharyaSadaji>, and also at websites <www.advaitaforum.org> and <www.advaitaforum.com> and many of my Live stream talks can be accessed at <http://www.livestream.com/advaita_sadaji> and at <www.advaita academy.org> both under Yu-tube as well as Livestream talks.  .

I do believe in using whatever modern facilities available to propagate the sanatana dharma. There are several facebook groups on advaita too where I do post. Dennis Waite has his own website where you may find some of my articles that he edited. 

This is just for information since you asked. I tried not get into serious chats there since it is time consuming and not much interested in arguing with people other than presenting the ideas if they want to digest or discard them. 

Hari Om!
Sadananda

       praNAms 

 Hare Krishna



 Fortunately now a days I
 have the access
 to see the Face book in my office desk top. I have
 already interacted
 with couple of members Sri praveen prabhuji and Sri
 shivashankara prabhuji
 thru this media. Any other prabhuji-s are there in
 FB?? would
 like to know. Links provided there, you tube link etc. I
 cannot open. And
 still donot know how effectively I can use this...live
 chatting, photo
 sharing etc. are really good one. 



 Hari Hari Hari
 Bol!!!

 bhaskar
