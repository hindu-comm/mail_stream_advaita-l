Here is a song purportedly authored by Sri Purandara Dasa:


Obba Acharyanu Daiva ve Illavenda ,
Obba Acharyanu Daiva ke Entu gunavenda ,
Obba Acharyanu Nirguna Nirakara Niravyaya nenda - Kadeyalli Tanae
Daivavenda
Obbaru Vedartha aritu Ariyaru
Obba Madhwacharyare Purandara Vitthalanobbane Daivavendu Torisakottaraagi

ಒಬ್ಬ ಆಚಾರ್ಯನು ದೈವವೇ ಇಲ್ಲವೆಂದ ,
ಒಬ್ಬ ಆಚಾರ್ಯನು ದೈವಕೆ ಏಂಟು ಗುಣವೆಂದ,
ಒಬ್ಬ ಆಚಾರ್ಯನು ನಿರ್ಗುಣ ನಿರಾಕಾರ ನಿರವಯನೆಂದ
ಕಡೆಯಲ್ಲಿ ತಾನೇ ದೈವವೆಂದ
ಒಬ್ಬರೂ ವೇದಾರ್ಥ ಅರಿತೂ ಅರಿಯರು
ಒಬ್ಬ ಮಧ್ವಾವಚಾರ್ಯರೇ ಪುರಂದರ ವಿಠ್ಟಲನೊಬ್ಬನೇ ದೈವವೆಂದು ತೋರಿಸಿಕೊಟ್ಟರಾಗಿ

The meaning of which is:

One Acharya proclaimed 'there is no God' [Buddha?]
One Acharya said 'God has eight attributes' [Ramanuja?]
One Acharya said  'attributeless, formless, partless' and ultimately said
'I am myself God' [Shankara ?]
None of these, though knowing the meaning of the Veda, really knew.
Only Acharya Madhwa taught that Purandara ViTThala alone is God.


One can easily see that the above is not a correct representation of
Advaita.  Even though Advaita holds the Supreme Reality to be devoid of
attributes, form and parts, there is no declaration of identity of the
self, jiva, with 'god' which is Ishwara.  For 'Ishwara' Advaita does admit
attributes and forms-at-will.  The distinction that is made between Ishwara
and (nirguna) Brahman in Advaita is generally overlooked by critics of
Advaita and the charge that advaitins identify themselves with Ishwara
which is saguNa-brahman. is very commonly made.  The above song is just one
instance.
