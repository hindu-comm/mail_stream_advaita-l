The legendary curse was only on those immediately involved in the story, not on all Nambudiri families. In
any case,  the Kerala local tradition attributes a lot of practices unique to Nambudiri society to Sankara's life.
There are varying opinions among historians about the actual origins of these special customs in Nambudiri
society.

e.g. From http://www.namboothiri.com/articles/veda.htm -

"The 
Namboothiris are probably unique to have a sub-caste of Brahmanans who are 
excluded from Vedams. They are called "Othillatha Namboothiris" (Namboothiris 
without Othu). "Othu" is the colloquial word for Vedam. These include Chaathira 
Namboothiris (who were engaged only in military exercises, in the form of games 
like Panemkali), Adukkala Namboothiris (who specialised in large-scale cooking), 
and, interestingly, some keezh-santhi Namboothiris (temple priests). The 
Astavaidyans, eight families of hereditary physicians, except Vaidyamadham, are 
Othillatha Namboothiris. All Othillatha Namboothiris study Samhitha (Vedic text) 
but not the remaining portions like Brahmanam, Aaranayakam and Upanishad. Also, 
they do not perform any Vedic Sroutha ritual, nor teach or practice Vedam 
recitation. "

from the pen of Dr. Kunjunni Raja, late director of the Adyar Library.
