Adi Sankara has answered this in the Sankara Dig Vijaya. Yes there was no
need for Parakaya Pravesha because he could not have lost his Brahmacharya
in his own body by learning Kama Shastra, But he did Parakaya Pravesha for
not misleading others in the world. *yad yad acarati* sresthas tat tad
evetaro janah sa yat pramanam kurute lokas tad anuvartate. If he used his
own body other people will try to follow him and it will be a disaster for
them. To avoid that he entered into another body and got knowledge of Kama
Shastra.

Your other question is already answered in Sankara Dig Vijaya.  If there is
no Retas Skhalana there is no loss of Brahmancharya. Only Yogis can do it.
Ordinary people cannot.

He wanted to answer certain questions in Kama Shastra. That is the reason.
Sankara Dig Vijaya has answered this. There is one episode mentioned about
Matsyendranath. He also left his own body and entered a King's body. He was
enjoying with his wives. But his disciple Gorakhnath came before him and
reminded him he was Yogi. Then Matsyendranath understood he was
unnecessarily staying in King's body. He left it and joined his own body.
This story is told by Padmapada to Adi Sankara to caution him but Adi
Sankara said don't worry same thing will not happen to me. Adi Sankara took
a very calculated step. He did not make any mistake.
