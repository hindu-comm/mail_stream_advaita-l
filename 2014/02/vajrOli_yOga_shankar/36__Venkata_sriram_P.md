Namaste

....................
[for without restraining the senses, it will lead to destruction].
...................

There is a beautiful proverb in telugu regarding this. "aDusu tokkanEla, kaaLLu kaDaganEla"

The meaning is why to step into the mud and then wash the feet.

There are more comfortable methods in grihasthAshrama.  And for yogis, 
practice of vairAgya is the safest one. 

Why to go for all these nonsense rituals.

regs,
sriram
