However that method is not the right one for the Sanyashi who has to learn 
the ,Mudra without a female partner. There ia an alternative procedure 
mentioned in certain samhita, which do not need a female partner.

And it was not ubhaya bhArati's condition that a bAla saNyAsi like 
bhagavatpAda should have 'practical experience' of kAma shAstra to answer 
her most irrelevant question on kAma shAstra during context of that 
debate...Does shankara practically performed all karma-s / vidhi-s etc. on 
his own and had the practical experience of deficiencies of pUrvameemAmsa 
doctrine for countering and arguing with maNdana??  If not, then what was 
the need for shankara to opt for practical experience with regard to ONLY 
kAma shAstra??  Anyway, as Sri Karthik prabhuji said, these episodes are 
not meant for 'deep-analysis' and we have to take it at its face value 
without questioning / querying further.  But fact remains that one of the 
shankara dveshi-s, like nArAyaNa paNdita makes ubhaya bhArati's 
untraditional question to bAla yati shankara a big issue in his work 
maNimaNjari and compassionately spares parakAya pravesha episode :-))

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
