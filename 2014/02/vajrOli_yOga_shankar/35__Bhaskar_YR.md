Since you said this, before closing this discussion from my side, I would 
like to make a final comment.

I think a finger of Sri Shankara got burnt when the messengers of the 
minister started burning all dead bodies, They forcibly took possession of 
Sri Shankara's body. On the repeated request of Sri  Padmapada, who was a 
devotee of Sri Narasimha, Sri Shankara sang the Sri Lakshmi Narasimha 
Karavalambha sthotram to restore his finger to its original purity and 
strength. I think this may be correct. 

>  If I am right none of the digvijaya says only shankara's finger got 
burnt, it says shankara's body was burning when he entered it...and after 
chanting srimat payOnidhi ......mama dehi karAvalambam, the lord nrusimha 
helped shankara by giving his hand to stand up.  Anyway, this is the first 
time I am hearing this resurrection of finger with all its originality. 
BTW, according to one of the biographies,  there is a huge time gap that 
can be assumed, after shankara's body started burning, his shishya vrunda 
went to the king to wake him up through songs and after hearing these 
songs king rUpi shankara had come back to enter to his original yati 
shareera...Till that time original body of shankara was keep on burning 
:-))

>  Anyway, as said above, this is my last post on this thread since Sri 
vidyA prabhuji has already said the charama vAkya to this thread.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
