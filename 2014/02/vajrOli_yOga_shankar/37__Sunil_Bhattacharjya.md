Dear Venkateshji,

Yes Shivasamhita and even one of the Yoga upanishads give the details of the Vajroli Mudra, for which a female partner is needed. However that method is not the right one for the Sanyashi who has to learn the ,Mudra without a female partner. There ia an alternative procedure mentioned in certain samhita, which do not need a female partner.

Regards,
Sunil KB

There is a beautiful proverb in telugu regarding this. "aDusu tokkanEla, kaaLLu kaDaganEla"

The meaning is why to step into the mud and then wash the feet.

There are more comfortable methods in grihasthAshrama. And for yogis, 
practice of vairAgya is the safest one. 

Why to go for all these nonsense rituals.

regs,
sriram
