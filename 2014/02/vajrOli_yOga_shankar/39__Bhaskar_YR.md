praNAms 
Hare Krishna

There is a beautiful proverb in telugu regarding this. "aDusu tokkanEla, 
kaaLLu kaDaganEla"

>  In Kannada too we say something like this : koccheli beeLodu yaake mai 
toLkoLOdu yaake ??

>  why to fell in the gutter and then wash your body?? 


There are more comfortable methods in grihasthAshrama.  And for yogis, 
practice of vairAgya is the safest one. 

>  But it is vishAdaneeya that great yati / saMnyAsi like shankara 
bhagavatpAda has chosen to do parakAya pravesha & used this yOga siddhi 
for fulfilling the mundane cause!! 

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
