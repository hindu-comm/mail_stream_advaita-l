Vajroli Mudra is a very secret practice. It is learned through Guru only.

praNAms 
Hare Krishna

Yes, these techniques should be learnt through guru/yOgi-s/siddha purusha 
only.  But none of the biographies would tell us from whom shankara got 
the siddhi-s like parakAya pravesha, vajrOli yOga etc.  His guru govinda 
bhagavatpAda hardly attracts any attention from the readers in all these 
biographies. 

Hari Hari Hari bol!!!
bhaskar
