There is one e.g of a saint (mostly Adi Shankara) eating non-veg when 
someone offered to him. So his disciples also ate it. then he drank 
wine. this was followed merrily by his disciples. then a Guru drank 
molten iron and asked his disciples to follow him :)

Hare Krishna

I have not read this in bhagavatpAda's jeevana charitra.  But I have seen 
this in a Kannada movie 'santa shishunALa shareefa' or 'bhUmige banda 
bhagavanta' (title of the move forgotten) ...where a yOgi does this to 
teach a lesson to his students.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
