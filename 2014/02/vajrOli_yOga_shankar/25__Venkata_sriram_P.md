Dear Vidyasankar-ji,

I was told that Acharya Sankara's curse was later revoked by Sri.Satchidananda Sivabhinava
Narasimha Bharati Mahaswamiji during His vijaya yatra to Kaladi.

His Holiness, being the amsha avatara of Sankara Bhagavatpada, had the power 
and authority to nullify the effect of this curse on kaladi.  

Need to know how authentic is the above legend.  

regs,
sriram
