Namaste

Adi Sankara was a Brahma Jnani. He cannot commit sin or merit in his own
body and also in another body. Even if he enters into thousand bodies also
he cannot commit sin in any body. Why he said he did not commit sin in
'this body'? The king's body was not sinning also because he was mixing
freely with his own wives.

I do not understand Saraswati's question and Adi Sankara's defending his
actions.
