Dear Vidyashankarji

If you permit me, I wish to answer the question as to where did Shankara learn the Vajroli yoga and who could have been his guru. His guru Shri Govindapada was called an avatara of Patanjali and that should at least mean that Shri Govindapada was good in the Patanjali yoga. Patanjali though started his Yogasutra with the later angas of the Ashtanga yoga he never underestimated the need for the earlier angas. He very well could have familiarised his young disciples to all the angas of the ashtanga yoga. In Shivasamhita Lord Shiva says that the Hathayoga is not complete without the Rajayoga and the Rajayoga is not complete without the Hathayoga and I am sure patanjali was aware of this.

Now coming to the Vajroli Mudra there are samhitas which give the specific procedures, practising which even a young yogi can strengthen the abdominal muscles so needed for the Vajroli. I will not go into the details of this as this is beyond the scope of our discussion.

Regards.

Sunil KB

Okay, list members, let's end this discussion here.

First, we have to realize that we should give up our contemporary assumptions about
sexuality and sacredness. Our attitudes about these today are shaped by an education
informed by Victorian assumptions that are quite alien to the life and times of Sankara.

Second, like it or not, this episode about Sankara using parakAya-praveSa to gain an
experience asked of him in the context of a debate is there in the Sankaravijaya texts.
It is easy to find fault with these texts and their authors by claiming that they lived
many centuries after Sankara and that they have not understood advaita, brahmacaryA,
deha-sambandha etc correctly. The reality is that our assumptions today are quite alien
to the life and times of the writers of these Sankaravijaya texts too.

No matter what, the details are what they are. Beyond the point already reached in this
thread as of now, these details are not pertinent to advaita vedAnta and the aims of this
list. Any further issues should be discussed with a living guru, with experience of these
topics in a practical way in daily life. Theoretical discussion on this list is not going to
help anybody.

Regards,
Vidyasankar
