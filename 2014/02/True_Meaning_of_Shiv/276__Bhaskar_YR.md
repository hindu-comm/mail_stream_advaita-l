The mind in deep sleep is in a state of total ignorance, completely 
unaware of the world.

Indra asks prajApati in chAndOgya : nAha khalvayamevaM saMpratyAtmAnaM 
jAnAti ayamahamasmeeti  nO evemAni bhUtAni vinAshamevApeetO bhavati 
nAhamatra bhOgyaM pashyAmi..  prajApti's answer would throw an entirely 
different light with regard to absence of  vishesha jnAna of jagat in 
sushupti.  And bruhadAraNyaka too answers this question beautifully. 

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
