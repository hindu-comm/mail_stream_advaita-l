Sanju - PraNAm

I made the mistake - it is actually pitRu yagna only - honoring the four fathers - we do three generations during tarpaNam and shraaddha. 
I mentioned Acharya yagna which is actually the same as Rishi yagna - the third one should be pitRiya yagna. 
My mistake.

Hari Om!

 PraNAms,

 Also heard in another discourse that Pitriyagya is part of
 the pancha mahayagyas - is this included in one of the five
 listed?

 Sincerely,
 Sanju
