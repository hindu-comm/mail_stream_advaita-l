Pranams Sadananda ji,

Time will tell :) If he is really interested, then he will continue to
listen to Gita and Vedanta talks, else the tempo will fade away. One of my
friend showed great interest in spirituality. When I said listen to Gita
atleast 3 times, I have not heard him back on this topic :)

Hari OM
