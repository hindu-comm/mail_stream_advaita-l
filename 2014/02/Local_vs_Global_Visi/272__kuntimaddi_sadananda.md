Sujalji - PraNAms and thanks for your input.

What you say is correct and the mental make up of the person is important.

This person whom I have not yet met personally, apparently has been listening to my introduction to Vedanta talk series that are available on yu-tube, and considers himself to be one of my ekalayva sishyas and has started communicating with me on Vedanta topics as he listens to the lectures. Hence it is not out of depression but more out of dispassion that he wants to wind up his activities and go to some secluded place in Himlalayas for meditation.

Let us wait and see how he takes up the suggestions. 

Hari Om!
Sadananda

 Pranams Sri Sadananda ji,

 The answer depends upon mental makeup of questioner. If the
 person is very
 sensitive, of emotional temperament, then you cannot advice
 him to stay
 detached. Intelligence and mind are not connected. A person
 lives by mind.
