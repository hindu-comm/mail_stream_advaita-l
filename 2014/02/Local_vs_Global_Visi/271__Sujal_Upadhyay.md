Pranams Sri Sadananda ji,

The answer depends upon mental makeup of questioner. If the person is very
sensitive, of emotional temperament, then you cannot advice him to stay
detached. Intelligence and mind are not connected. A person lives by mind.

If one accepts all persons and situation 'as it is' then problem is solved.
All are suffering through prarabhdha and for that they alone are
responsible. This understanding makes one calm and helps one adapt to any
situation.

The problem is that people feel 'low' or are depressed, when things do not
happen 'their' way. Everyone wants to change situations and others, but not
himself, while in spirituality, one has to change oneself and leave others
by accepting their (+/-) 'as it is'. If we try to change somebody, then you
are hitting your head on stone. It is you who will suffer. ore, one remains
concerned about others if they are following what you have said or not.

Swami Ramsukhdas ji says (Hindi) - *chintA chItA hai.*

wherever he will go, he will take his mind with him. Peace is to be found
within.

Swami Sukhbodhanada says

'Meditation is
being at peace with 'what is' and
transcending 'what is' '

If we quit to force our way, then many problems will be solved. In other
way, leave everything to God (Hindi) - *jaisI terI IcchA* (as you wish).
There must be some (mystical / spiritual) reason behind what is happening

If we stay tuned with nature, spend more time with nature like watering
plants, seeing them with love, offering food to pigeons and dag helps calm
ones mind.

Running away is not a solution. The issue is inability to handle (or not
wanting to handle) stress and fear. At another place, different problems
may arise.

Meditation is not suitable to one who are very sensitive. If someone says
something to you, then that thing will keep moving in your mind and  will
not let you meditate, mantra will be pushed aside and will be lost. After
15-20 minutes when force of thoughts decrease, you will realize that you
are sitting in meditation !!!
