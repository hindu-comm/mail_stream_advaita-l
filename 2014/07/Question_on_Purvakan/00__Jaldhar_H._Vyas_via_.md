karma means intentional action -- all actions laukika or otherwise.  But 
the karma that is prescribed in the Vedas and by extensions shastras 
dependent on the Vedas (aka smrtis) and the conduct of those knowledgable 
in shastras (shistachara) is dharma.  So the student seeking to understand 
the role of karmakanda in Advaita Vedanta has to go to all three sources 
not just one...

...Therefore that the eminent sages and acharyas of our sampradaya have 
endorsed murti puja (which is what I assume you mean by the foreign term 
"idol worship") and that it is described in detail in puranas and agamas 
is more than sufficient to establish the practices "Vedic" bona fides. 
Still it is an interesting question whether reference to murti puja can be 
found in the shruti proper.  It seems to me there is no explicit 
injunction in that regard atleast that I have seen.  However, It is wrong 
to assume that Vedas only deal with "nature" or aniconic forms of 
divinity; the forms of many devatas are described in detail.  And the use 
of objects as the focus for upasana is also there.  So it is not much of a 
leap to see the two concepts coming together to form the concept of murti 
puja.

This was the view of the nairuktas but Yaskacharya mentions several other 
schools of Vedic interpretation including "yajnikas" which seem to be the 
forerunners of the Purva Mimamsakas.  As the name yajnika suggests, they 
believed that the entire shruti (and by extension smrti and shistachara) 
is connected to yajna even the upanishads.  (Mostly Vedanta is in accord 
with PM but this of course is one of several issues where the two 
sister-darshans part company.)

In the battle for authority the yajnikas "won" against the nairuktas and 
other forms of interpretation.  Apart from the Vedanga Nirukta of 
Yaskacharya and a couple of commentaries on it there is little written on 
the subject while there are litterally hundreds of works on Purva Mimamsa.

Based on the above I don't think a Mimamsaka would say there is no 
involvement but try and integrate the concepts of murti puja into the 
yajna paradigm.
