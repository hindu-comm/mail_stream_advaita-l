Mikael Aktor
------------

My name is Mikael Aktor. I am an associate professor in history of 
religions at University of Southern Denmark. I am doing research on the 
pancayatana puja. For that purpose I will be in Nepal and India from 
September to November 2014 travelling to all five locations where the 
pancayatana shilas are collected. I am interested in any information 
(mythological, theological, spiritual, practical, ritual) related to each 
of the five shilas.
