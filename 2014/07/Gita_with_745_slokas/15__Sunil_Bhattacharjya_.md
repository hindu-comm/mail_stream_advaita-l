Dear Sriramji,

The book of Dr. E. vedavyasa, you are referring to, contains more than 750 verses and not 745 verses, as claimed. May be you would like to check it yourselves. It is practically the same as the one published by the Gondal pith, which also has more than 750 verses.

Regards,
Sunil KB

Apart from Sri.Anubhavananda Ji, there was another person who did
research on this in telugu who was also an IAS officer (Ekkirala Vedavyas Garu),
Principal Secretary to Govt. of Andhra Pradesh and PS to Chief Minister NTR 
who is no more now.
