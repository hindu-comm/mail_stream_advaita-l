Namaste Jaldhar bhai,

Thank you for the links.

I remember that you had given reference to Verse 84 form Bhagavan
Swaminarayan in his shikshapatri.

Infact this sampradAya is the most liberal. They follow Visistadvaita, and
revere Ramanuja's Sribhashya. Their sampradAya is called Swaminarayana
sampradaya (earlier is was called as Uddhava Sampradaya)

Here is a link to shikshapati in enlgish

http://www.swaminarayan.nu/sampraday/shiksha.shtml

Verses related to our context are

23. When (my followers) on their way, come across temples of Shiv, and
other deities, they shall bow down to them and have their darshan
respectfully.

46. Brahmin and other followers who are required on the account of their
family tradition, to put on horizontal mark on their forehead and to wear
on their neck a necklace prepared from Rudraksha beads shall not give up
wearing them, even after becoming My followers.

​47. All shall realize that Narayan and the Mahesh are one, for as Brahman
they have been described as one in the Vedas.

OR

*47. All shall know that Narayana and Mahesha are one, as they have been
both described as brahman by the vedas.​*

59. Shastras proclaim these Bhaktas as Nirguna (i.e. completely free from
mundane qualities like Satva, Rajas, and Tamas) since Lord Shri Krishna
(Hari) is Nirguna. Because of their intimate relation with him, all their
action also become Nirguna.

*79. All shall observe devoutly and with proper festivities, the Vratas of
all Ekadashi days of every month as well as the birth day of Shri Krishna
and Shiv. *

81. Shri Vitthalnathji, son of Shri Vallabhacharya, a king among the
Vaishanavas, has given decisions regarding all Vratas and festivals.

(Shri Vitthalnath ji is said to be discple of MAdhusudan Saraswati)

82. All shall observe them accordingly. The mode of worship of Lord Shri
Krishna as explained by him shall also be followed.

*84. My followers shall regard the five deities named here with reverence -
Vishnu, Shiva, Ganpati, Parvati and the Sun. *

106. Maya is one which constitutes the three qualities - Satva, Raja and
Tama, is ignorance incarnate, is power of Lord Shri Krishna and is the
cause prima for ego and personal attachment for body physic and everything
else related to it, on the part of Jiva.

*115. Lord Shri Krishna, His incarnations and His forms, only shall from
the objects for meditation. One shall never meditate upon Jivas-men as well
as deities, however great, as Bhaktas and knowers of Brahman they may be. *


OM
