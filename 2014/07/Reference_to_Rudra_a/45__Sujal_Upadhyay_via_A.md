Namaste Subramaniam ji,

Thank you for the article. BG 9.25 Sankara bhASya also contains the word
'vinAyaka'. I think Sridhara Swami and Madhusudan Saraswati has also used
the word 'sinAyaka'. Swami Sivananada's commentary clarifies that this
vinAyaka-s (plural) are jIva-s  higher than humans and lower than devA-s.
Same is the case with mAtrikA-s.

Please shed some light on this too.

Hari OM


Sujal
