It quite clearly refers to Brahmaji as the lord (creator) of the world 
seated on the kamala etc. and it would seem rather difficult to interpret 
it as anything else.  Hence Shridharacharya, Swami Shankarananda and Swami 
Madhusudan Saraswati in their tikas only mention Brahmaji.

On the other hand, 10.23 says rudrANAm sha~NkarashchAsmi.  Shankaracharya 
modestly avoids making any connection with his name and merely mentions 
that there are 11 rudras.  None of the others explicitly mention Shiva 
Bhagavan either.
