math means to churn, strike or split.  I think the third meaning is most 
appropriate here.  So mithilo mathanajjato (BhA. pu. 9.13.13) Mithila is 
the one who was born by splitting. The Rshis were afraid of the anarchy 
that would result if the land had no king so they split the body that Nimi 
had lost due to the curse of Maharshi Vasishtha and a youth emerged 
fully-formed.  As well as Mithila, because he was "generated" he was 
called Janaka and and because he is the son of the bodiless one (videha) 
he is called Vaideha.

An interesting thing is there is a discrepancy between the Bhagavata and 
Ramayana here.  In the Bhagavata Mithi or Mithila is a name of Janaka 
himself (for the reason given above) not a separate person.  I haven't 
checked if other Puranas favor one approach or the other.

Gah! Yes.  I always confuse the two.  Also while I am making corrections, 
I had written the name of Sita Ma's father as shiradhvaja following my 
Gujarati copy of the Bhagavata but in Sanskrit it is correctly sIradhvaja.

Perhaps but in this case it was simply an error on my part.  The Surya and 
Chandra and all the other Kshatriya vamsha's are descendents of Ikshvaku.

Nimi was also a son of Ikshvaku so it is the same as what Venkatshriramji 
gave for chandravamsha.  i.e.:

1 .brahma
2. marIchi
3. kashyapa
4. vivashwanta
5. manu
6. ikSvAku
7. Nimi

To get back on the Vedantic track, the point of mentioning these ancient 
Kshatriyas is that Arjuna contends that the war is immoral because it will 
result in fratricide and the proper response is passivity and inertia. 
Krishna Bhagavan shows him by these examples that karmayoga is not some 
strange new deviation from Kuru norms but the "family business" that his 
own ancestors would be proud to see him follow.
