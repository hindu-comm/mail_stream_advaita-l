The Son river flows throught U.P. and Bihar (I think its source is even 
further south than that.) and meets the Ganga at Patna.  That would be the 
largest city.

Yes.

Don't know about this one.  There is a sphatika in my puja but it probably 
came from somewhere in Gujarat (I'm Gujarati.)

All the dharmashastras are in agreement that these particular 
shilas are to be used in Panchayatana puja but the concept of worshipping 
Shiva, Vishnu, Shakti, Ganesh and Surya together is widespread even 
amongst those who don't have all five.  For instance in my puja I have 
the Banalinga and Shaligram but a panchaloha murti for Ganesh Bhagavan, a 
silver coin inscribed with the image of Shri devi for Mataji, and the 
aforementioned sphatika for Surya Bhagavan.  All these were inherited from 
my grandfather.
