Om!


I would like to know the academic views on authorship and validity of Prapancasara being a creation of Adi Sankara, the author of Brahmasutra Bhashya.

How is it accepted that Vivarana on Prapancasara belongs to Padmapada, if the original does not belong to Adi Sankara?


On the same note, if Tantra is not accepted to be the field of Adi Sankara, how are the portions of Brihadaranyaka where in descriptions of man-woman relationship, or Amaruka Satakam, or Trisati bhashyam, or Saundarya Lahari accepted or rejected to belong to Adi Sankara.

Om!

Srikrishna
