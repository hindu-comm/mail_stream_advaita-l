Jnanis generally adhere to Dharma only. However, there are many cases where a Jnani may perform an act that a common man *perceives* as apparently Adharmic. In every such case, the Jnani has previously or afterwards proven his or her ability to perform miracles - i.e. wilfully act against the laws of nature.

Here are some examples:

Krishna played around with the Gopis.
But he lifted the Govardhana mountain with his little finger.

Agastya ate the animal meat that was offered to him.
But he easily digested the demon that had assumed the form of the meat.
Not to mention his effortlessly drinking up the oceans!

Adi Sankara took up the body of a king to learn the art of carnal love (he later returned to his original body through the power of Yoga).
But he made golden amlas rain from the sky as a blessing to a poor pious lady.

Prashurama killed a lot of Kshatriyas (he even challenged Rama to a duel).
But his curse on Karna turned completely true.


This is an anecdote that I heard when I was a child:

A sage had several disciples. One day, they were invited to the home of a wine trader. When offered wine by the host, the sage drank it. Seeing this, the disciples enjoyed getting drunk with wine.
Sometime later, the sage was invited to the home of a blacksmith. The blacksmith offered the sage some molten iron. The sage drank it up! The disciples were horror-struck when the blacksmith offered them the same drink!

Moral of the story: following a great man means following his/her instructions, not necessarily all their activities.


This is covered in Apastamba Dharma Sutra 2.6.13.8-10:

http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/sbe02/sbe0248.htm

PRASNA II, PATALA 6, KHANDA 13.

"8. Transgression of the law and violence are found amongst the ancient (sages).
9. They committed no sin on account of the greatness of their lustre.
10. A man of later times who seeing their (deeds) follows them, falls."
