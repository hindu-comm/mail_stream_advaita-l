I have heard a few variations of Laghunyasam of Rudram. An older Chinmaya
Mission version has a couple of verses that I have not seen listed in any
book that I have.
After: antas tishTas tvamritasya gopA.h

there is the following (as best as I could make out):
ArAdhito manuSh-yaistu digdhair devA surAdhibhi.h
ArAdhayAmi bhaktyA-tvA nugrthANa mahezwara

I would like some help in getting the exact text of the above, plus the
source.

Thanks,
Prasad
