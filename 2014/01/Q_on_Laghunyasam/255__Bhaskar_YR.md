there is the following (as best as I could make out):
ArAdhito manuSh-yaistu digdhair devA surAdhibhi.h
ArAdhayAmi bhaktyA-tvA nugrthANa mahezwara

praNAms
Hare Krishna

After antas tishTas tvamritasya gopA.h we chant  : evaM yathAlingamangAni 
saMrujya devamAtmAnancha pratyArAdhayet and after chanting this following 
is what we chant :

ArAdhitO manushyaistvaM siddhairdevAsurAdhibhiH !
ArAdhayAmi bhaktyA tvAm mAm gruhANa maheshwara !!


As far as I know, the above is what normally followed here in Bangalore if 
not in South India.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!!
bhaskar
