In fact Sri Bhaskar ji has highlighted before the idea of
'sarvajnatva, etc. are avidyAkalpita' by citing the famous statements from
the BSB 2.1.14.

praNAms Sri Subbu prabhuji
Hare Krishna

I disparately need some time to clarify all these things from bhAshya 
perspective.  Anyway, here is the quick shot.  The bhAshya vAkya says 
something like : sarvajnatvAdi vyavahAraH upapadyate. Here the word 
vyavahAra is very important...In, upAdhi rahita Atman sarvajnatvAdi 
vyavahAra, which is avidyAkalpita is not admitted (neha nAnAsti kiMchana) 
but it does not anyway mean to say that brahman is devoid of jnAnaM and 
shakti without the help of upAdhi, because shruti declaring that the 
parabrahman is satyaM, jnAnam and anantaM brahma (vide tai.up.) !!  The 
above bhAshya vAkya  says only  that sOpAdhika Ishwara is vyavahArika 
satya and this vAkya in arambhaNAdhikaraNa is not there to propagate the 
idea that brahman without upAdhi is minus of his svabhAva i.e. sarvajnatva 
and sarvashaktitva. 

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
