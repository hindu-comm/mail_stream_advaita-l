Friends,

Thanks for all the replies. It is very enlightening.

Would it be more appropriate to say "there is ignorance in Brahman" rather than "Brahman is ignorant"? Pot exists in space, space is not pot - that sort of thing. That way, delusion may exist in Brahman without Brahman itself becoming delusional.....

Suresh
