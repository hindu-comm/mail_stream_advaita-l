Dear Friends,

When someone asked Ramana about his disease, he is said to have remarked: the body is the disease. 


I take it he means the body limits the all-pervading consciousness. If so, why does Brahman assume the body in the first place and limit itself thus? Even if it's maya, what purpose would taking a body serve?


Thanks in advance.

Suresh
