The kalpanA is done based on the shruti passage that I cited:
Br.up.1.4.10.  Shankara addresses the question: 'how can Brahman have
ignorance?'  and concludes: since there is no other sentient being which
can realize its own self as 'aham brahma asmi' and thereby realize its
infinitude 'brahma vA idam agra AsIt, tat AtmAnam Eva avEt aham brahma asmi
iti. tasmAt tat sarvam abhavat', it is perforce to be accepted that it had
ignorance which it shed owing to the knowledge of itself it gained.  For,
ignorance and knowledge can happen only to a sentient being.

As per Advaita all the shruti passages about brahman creating the world,
sustaining it and dissolving it, pertain to the saguNa brahman, Ishwara
which is a shruti-made adhyAropa only to enable the liberation of the
jiva-aspirant.  The apavAda of the adhyAropa comes/happens when the jIva
realizes the Truth: that he, as Brahman, was never ever in bondage; ever
free.  As I have pointed out before, citing Vidyaranya's verse from the
Panchadashi,Chitradeepa):

 मायाख्यायाः कामधेनोर्वत्सौ जीवेश्वरावुभौ।
यथेच्छं पिबतां द्वैतं तत्त्वं त्वद्वैतमेव हि॥६-२३६॥
 jIva and Ishvara are the two calves of the Kamadhenu cow called mAyA. Let
them drink (the milk) of duality as much as they desire, but nonduality
alone is the truth.
