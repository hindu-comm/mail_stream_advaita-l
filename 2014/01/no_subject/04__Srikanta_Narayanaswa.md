We may also accumulate more karma, so we must perform our duties in such a way that we dont - nishkama karma. Point is, Karma should be eliminated completely for us to realize our true nature and NOT take birth again.

If a person still has greed or anger issues, lust etc., is it safe to assume that he has a long way to go, many more births? So we observe our own behavior and then conclude as to how much karma we have left?

Does this mean their karmas are not being eliminated by their sadhana - meaning their sadhana is faulty - or does it mean these things cannot be empirically observed (and therefore no solid conclusion can be drawn)?

Our upanishada are clear on this point.The Mundaka upanishad says:
Pareekshya locan karmachitan nirveda mayath Brahmanah,nasti akrtam kritena
tena vijnanartham sa Gurureva abhigacccheth shrotiyam Brahma nishtam??

The above Mundaka sruthi clearly indicates that one has to see the results gained by one,s Karmas and come near a Guru who is a Brahma nishta.It is very difficult to get a Guru these times who is a Shrotriya and also a Brahmasnishta.Then what is one to do?The only way is to introspect our own Self.If we done wrongly,we have to correct ourself.Not to repeat it again.This is the only yardstick left for us.
