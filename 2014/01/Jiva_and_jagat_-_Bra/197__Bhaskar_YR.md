In the same way the
substratum Brahman is the fundamental content of the superimposed world. 
By
such a study the (possible) objection ‘how can the veda teach the oneness
of the extremely lowly things like a dog, etc. with the Lord/Brahman?’
stands brushed aside.  Nor does the shruti teach the oneness of the
body-mind complex of the dog, etc. with Brahman.

With this how can we reconcile the shruti / shankara's assertion that 
brahman is the ONLY  abhinna nimittOpadAna kAraNa of this world??  It 
gives us the impression that  brahman is only antaryAmi and not the 
upAdAna kAraNa of this jagat...For that matter jagat is not superimposed 
on brahman like snake is superimposed on rope, shankara is quite clear on 
this in chAndOgya and katha.  Under these circumstances, would it be okay 
for us to accept that brahman is only antaryAmi and not upAdAna kAraNa of 
this jagat and jagat is mithya like snake on rope??  Please clarify.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
