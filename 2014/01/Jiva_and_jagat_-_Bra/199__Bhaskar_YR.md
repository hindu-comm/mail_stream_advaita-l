BG - brahmArpaNam brahma haviH....

praNAms Sri Subbu prabhuji
Hare Krishna

I dont know how this verse & corresponding bhAshya would substatiate the 
claim that brahman is kevala antaryAmi of jagat and jagat is avidyA !! 
OTOH it rather proves the upanishad vAkyas like  'sarvaM khalvidaM brahma' 
idaM sarvaM yadayamAtmAand brahman is apart from nimitta kAraNa, upAdAna 
kAraNa too..Sri sadananda prabhuji's recent series on this verse too 
proves that brahman is annAda and anna, 

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
