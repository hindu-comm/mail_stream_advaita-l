Here is another old pending mail :


The Vedantic satkAryavAda is different from the sAnkhya satkAryavAda:

>  I agree. and vedAnta satkArya vAda also not to propagate the satkArya 
vAda literally it is there just to refute the theories of sAnkhya satkArya 
vAda.  kArikA bhAshya clarifies this. 

The effect, prior to manifesting , exists in the cause, AS the cause
itself  - This is vedAnta.

>  yes, when this cause in cause manifesting/appearing  as effect (kArya) 
it is nothing but that kAraNa only not separate from kAraNa because 
whatever we are seeing here as kArya jagat is AbhAsa of that kAraNa 
only..Hence though we are seeing snake as kArya in kAraNa rope, the kArya 
snake is nothing but AbhAsa of that rope only...And this socalled effect 
is not atyantAbhAva like vandhyA putra or shashavishANa.  sUtra bhAshya on 
na vilakshaNatvAdhikaraNAm and kArikA bhAshya have some good points on 
this issue. 

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
