Sir, I've been doing some vedanta studying, but doubts come up, and this is the only forum where I can share them. I am not in a position to go to teachers etc. This forum is the only place where I can discuss, understand, clarify doubts etc. Otherwise, my studying alone isn't helping - need someone to discuss things with, to see from another PoV, and so on.

Suresh - Forget about Brahman. Brahman can take care of himself. Most important is whether you can know that you are Brahman or not.. 
You can know your self that you are Brahman if you purify your mind enough to study the scriptures seriously and contemplate on the teaching.
You are asking questions without studying Vedanta. I suggest you concentrate on the study than asking others opinions on the list. There are many Introduction to Vedanta on line too.

Subject: [Advaita-l] Can Brahman know itself?

Friends,

It is said that the eye cannot see itself - in that sense
Brahman cannot know itself. But that would make Brahman
ignorant, which is not the case (since it is described as
jnana). So is there another kind of knowing that would apply
to Brahman? I am confused about how to interpret this.
