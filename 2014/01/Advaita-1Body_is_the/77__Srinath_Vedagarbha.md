Here is the problem -- two order of reality cannot come into picture unless
avidya and its locus is established first. This is because, two orders of
reality (viz paaramarthika and vyavaharika) is due to avidya only. So,
unless locus for avidya is explained at the level of Brahmn, there is no
question of two realities, period.

Here too, creation cannot said to happen unless avidya/maaya start its
effect and Iswara is said to exist. So, unless locus of avidya is answered,
 creation and anupravesha cannot be forwarded and say chidaabhaasa is locus
of avidya as you seems to say in #11 below

I guess that cannot be the answer. Because, the moment one say "The one who
does not understand..." makes that person himself ignorant, for he already
sees difference between himself (who thinks he knows the answer) and other
person who is asking that question. Since difference is due to avidya, the
person answering comes automatically under the spell of avidya. So, this is
really not an answer.
