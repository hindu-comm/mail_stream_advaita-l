Dear Sri Rudra,

When it is said Brahma endowed WITH ignorance, Ignorance is Maya
(bhavarupa) which is a Power and not just a passive attribute like lack of
knowledge. Ignorance as understood in english is not a proper word for
maya. As i have already mentioned in my other mail, you may need to refer
to works like Panchadashi for a clearer understanding of maya.
Incidentally, snake is an appearence of the rope is a provisional
understanding. The complete position is < Brahman ( Chaitanyam ) through
Avidya which appeared as rope is now appearing as snake > . That is how
Brahman is considered as THE substratum for everything else. This is just
by the way and not to confuse the issue further. You may ignore it if you
dont like. It does not affect the answer to your question in any way.

Regards
