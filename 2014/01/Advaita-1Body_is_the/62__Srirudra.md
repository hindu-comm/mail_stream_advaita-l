Dear
If G.K.2.32  is a revelation then why all these efforts to obtain mumukshathvam ?Does it mean that we have to strive to know things to understand that they are all figment of imagination?Are all these enquiries about Brahman are just for intellectual exercises leading us nowhere.?What then it means Athatha Brahma jignyasa: of B.S.I think one has to study fully the G.K.and should not go by an isolated verse  and reach bizarre conclusions.We are all not competent to supply our opinions/ interpretations to suit limited purposes.If I am wrong please excuse me.R.Krishnamoorthy.
