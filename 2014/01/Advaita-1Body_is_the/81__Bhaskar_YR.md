This is another topic I wanted to touch -- how can any prArabhha remains
even after brahmanishTa realize avidya is unreal? 

>  Some saMpradAyavAdins say that vidyA only effaces the avidyA but not 
prArabdha, which has already started giving it's phala. The famous example 
for this is arrow that has already left the bow. 


When it was said this
jagat is avidya kalpita and mOksha is due to knowledge only (jnAnAdEva
mOkshaH), how can prArabhha (isn't it part of this jagat?) remains even
after avidya is known to be unreal? 

>  again, it is believed that though the jnAni has the paramArtha jnAna of 
his svarUpa, he may still become deluded due to avidyA lesha which is 
nothing but jnAni's unstoppable prArabdha karma phala.  Due to the 
influence of this avidyA lesha or prarabdha karma he may some time get 
kAma, krOdha also like any other normal mortal beings.  kashyapa brahma, 
yAjnAvalkya, etc. are some of the examples...dviteeya chandra darshana, 
'digbhrAnta' etc. some of the examples we find in shankara's bhAshya. 


If it is argued it remains somehow, it only means that cause for prArabhha 
is not avidya but something else.

>  avidyA lesha (traces of ignorance) is the another name that has been 
given for this prArabdha karma phala.  This avidyAlesha would last as long 
as jnAni stays in his current bhautika shareera.  After shedding his 
mortal coil, the jnAni would be completely freed from avidyA lesha, 
prArabdha etc.  This is what the answer we would get and the answer also 
may vary according to the different gradation among paramArtha Atma 
jnAni-s.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
