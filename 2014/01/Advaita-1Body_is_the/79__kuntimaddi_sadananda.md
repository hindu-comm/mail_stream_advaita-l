PraNAms

Thanks Vidya for clarifying it more. It is obvious that one does question who is ignorant unless someone tells that it is the ignorance that is the root cause for jiiva-jagat-iswara plurality. Naturally a Vedantic student asks this question as is being asked in these posts. This question was raised and answered in the Naiskarmya Siddhi by Sureswara. 

Hari Om!
Sadananda

 Not if the person asking the question is the same as the
 person providing the answer.

 Alternatively, the person asking (Sishya) sees the
 difference and is therefore under avidyA,
 agreed. But the person answering (guru/Sruti) knows that the
 difference is not real, thus
 avidyA is not real, and teaches the Sishya accordingly. Now
 it is up to the Sishya to remain
 under the spell of avidyA or to cast it off and understand
 that there is no difference really
 between oneself and the self of the guru, because difference
 itself does not really exist.

 The choice of the Sishya is the difference between saMsAra
 and moksha. As long as you
 accord reality to avidyA, so long does avidyA continue to
 keep you in its spell. The guru who
 is brahmanishTha only accords so much value (not reality) to
 difference as required for the
 momentum of prArabdha karma to dissipate. It is up to the
 Sishya to realize that as well.

 Regards,
 Vidyasankar
