H S Chandramouli

Dear all,

< It is said that Brahman out of ignorance created body .Does it mean that
Brahman is also subject to avidhya? I think this may not be a correct >.

If " out of " is considered as refering to upadana karana ( material cause
) it presents no problems as Avidya or Maya is considered to be so. Reg the
second sentence, It is to be remembered that Brahman and Avidya ( ignorance
) refer to different levels of Reality. Thereby Brahman is not tainted by
ignorance though it itself appears in itself as ignorance, just like the
characteristics of the rope are not affected by the characteristics of the
snake appearing therein. Brahman is < Asangah > . That is how even if " out
of " in the first sentence is not considered as refering to the upadana
karana, the sentence is valid if  understood as < brahman as though out of
ignorance etc > .

The same applies to all other statements quoted from shruti/bhashya is this
thread reg brahman/ignorance/delusion etc. The understanding  must include
the " as though " aspect. Then there is no problem in appreciating them.
 The statements < brahman has ignorance > and < brahman has sarvajnatva >
are both valid if viewed from this same perspective. Brahman is the ONLY
vastu. All else are appearences in brahman and do not taint brahman.

Regards
