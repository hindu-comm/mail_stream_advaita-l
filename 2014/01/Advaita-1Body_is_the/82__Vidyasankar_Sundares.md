The two opposing thoughts are not entertained by the same person at the same
time.

>From the point of view of the sAdhaka, is there a time instant when the question
is asked and another time instant when the answer is reached? Yes, clearly so.

Does the self of that person therefore change? No.

No, the reason to put all pramANa-prameya vyavahAra under the realm of avidyA
goes much deeper in advaita vedAnta. I'll leave it at that for now.

You are mistaking my usage of the word thus, because I was not talking of causality
in talking of avidyA and bheda. I was merely referring to the temporal process of a
Sishya learning from a guru and the process by which the Sishya can grasp what
the guru has taught. There is a time honored teaching method that starts from the
many and then shows that bheda is not real, without saying much about avidyA,
mUlA or tulA.

See for example, upadeSasAhasrI, 1st prose chapter, where salila-phena is given as
an example right at the beginning, the situation of "bheda, but nAtyanta bheda" is
then described, but avidyA is mentioned only at the end of the instruction, with
statements such as,

"bheda-darSana-nindopapatter avidyAkRtaM dvaitam" and
"tad-bheda-dRShTim eva avidyAM saMsAram unmUlayati."

Seeing difference IS avidyA - that is what I meant in my usage of the word "thus."
You are welcome to replace "thus" with "as," or with "that," if you so please.

We have touched upon this issue multiple times in multiple threads in the past
on this list, haven't we? We don't have our own search engine for the archives,
so this link may help - https://www.google.com/#q=prarabdha+%22advaita-l%22.
