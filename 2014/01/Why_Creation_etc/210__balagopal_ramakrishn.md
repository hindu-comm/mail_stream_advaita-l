Namasthe,

The examples of gold & ring, waves, ocean & water etc are ample enough to convey the non creation.Once the cause & effect are reconciled and the causeship removed what else is there to enquire, than to solidify that jnanam and remain established in it. It is our vyavaharic fallacy that propels to find a dob/cause for things/situations. So it's not that easy to make one self understand that there is really 'NO' situation to fret ab't. Until then it's all a ring a ring o roses...


Regards

Balagopal

The whole of the Shruti is only for this , " to awaken the person " .

Not mere explanation, but a way out to get out of the deeprooted conviction
, extending over millions of births , that samsara is TRUE .
