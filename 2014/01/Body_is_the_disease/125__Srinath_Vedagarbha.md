That's not I am saying. Please see my original posting.

This exactly is my contention.

If you utter vAkya "Everything is mithyA", this sentence (a pratIgnyA) is
also rendered mithya, for your pratIgnyA is also included in "everything".
This is what is called "svakriya virOdha" in nyAya, which is a type of
pratIgnyA virOdha dOSha. On the other hand, if you were to exclude your
pratIgnyA from "everything" shabdA (shabdArtha sunkuchita), then it would
lead to ayApti dOSha in the paxa you are sought to establish the sAdya.

You have lost even before you have entered into this vAda, because you
perceived another member inviting you to reply to this thread (tad
pratEyA), and you perceived me (yuShmad pratEya) to enter into this vAda;
and according to Shankara, yuShmad-asmad pratEya is indeed avidya and that
makes any pratIgnyA uttered with avidya is not yathArtha, and hence you
have already lost.

Again, yuShmad-asmad once more!

I am not opposing my rule. What is my rule?

I have said "*it is expected in vidvad circles that hEtu used in such
argument is indeed **accepted as "true" (tAtvIka), at least in such
person's own siddhAnta if **not in opponent's siddhAnta"*

You have missed the emphasis "....at least in such person's own
siddhAnta..."

Remember, I am a realist in this vAda setup and per my siddhAnta, I see you
and your vAda are as real as me and my vAda, and perception of such "real"
is NOT considered as avidya in my siddhAnta . There is no svakriya-virOdha
in my case.

Btw, you must read a work called bhedOjjivanaM, where all the arguments of
Shri-Harsha have been thoroughly refuted. You must read both sides in order
to better acquainted with the situation.
