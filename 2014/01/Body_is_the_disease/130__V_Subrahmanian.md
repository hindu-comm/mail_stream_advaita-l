It is quite well known that the bheda-s are not taattvika.  Why would an
Advaitin say that they are tAttvika?  Did I or the bhAShya say/imply that
the bheda-s are tAttvika? There is no substance in the statement you make
above. Also, not all acceptance of bheda is for upAsanA purpose; we need
bheda even for loukika vyavahAra.

I do not see anything wrong in 'summoning' such 'elements'. In a certain
workshop the Advaitin scholar made a statement: 'In matters such as why
creation, when onwards, why jiva-s are put in samsAra, etc. all schools
have to throw their hands up in the air for no school can give any
'logical' replies to these.'  And there was no protest to this statement
from the other school.  It is evident that they too have to admit anAditva,
etc.  If they are aware that Advaita too holds anAditva for samsAra,
creation, etc. they should have no right to make any objection.  And as I
said before, the admittance of bheda in the vyAvaharika by Advaita is not
ONlY for upAsana purposes; it is also for accounting vyavahAra, like
pratyakSha.  The pramAtR-pramANa-prameya bheda has to be admitted to
account for the basic experience of perception.  The big part of vedanta
paribhaSha is on the loukika vyavahara accounting rather than on the
upAsanA.  In the case of upAsanA, Shankara has clearly stated that it is a
buddhipUrvaka adhyAsa, as in the case of vishnu buddhi in sAligrAma.
Everyone knows that the sAligrama stone is not the all-pervading vishnu.
Yet, for the sake of upAsanA/pUjA meant for chittashuddhi, a
superimposition of vishnu in the stone is made knowingly.

You say // (Dvaitins)They are not saying such attribution is wrong in
itself either//  Let me point out to you just one instance of how their
thinking is not in accordance with your 'opinion' about them:

In retaliation to the famous 'bhaja govindam' the Dvaitins have composed a
song (bhaja madhwesham) in the same meter, in abject caricature of the
bhaja govindam and criticism of advaita.  One verse in the song goes like
this:

http://in.groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/SUMADHWASEVA/conversations/messages/29934

//" Ko va Bhajakah: Kim va Bhajanam
Yasmat Dwaitam Na Angikriyate,
Tasmat Bhajanam Durghataghatanam"
Bhaja Madhvesham Bhaja Madhvesham//

[ Who indeed is the worshiper/devotee?  What indeed is devotion/worship?
Since dvaita is not admitted (by Advaitins).  Therefore devotion/worship is
an impossibility (in Advaita).  Therefore (reject Advaita) and worship
madhvesha.]

This is just one example of their misunderstanding advaita.  If the
scholar-monk who composed the above work had truly understood advaita's
stand on worship, etc. he would not have said the above.  Let me state that
the top ranking Advaita scholars who have studied the classical objections
of Dvaita/VA on Advaita have concluded that the objections have their basis
in their ignorance of the methods of Advaita.  They have not studied
Advaita correctly.  Even today, as I was a witness, they organize meets so
as to understand Advaita better.

I do not see any problem here.  AvidyA and anAditva etc. are definitely
required for tattvanishchaya.  Why do you say that they are not?

Where have we said this?  Where have we said that such provisionally true
statements are idamittham?

There is no rule as the above.  In my opinion you are raising a non-issue.
