MadhusUdana's opponent, the dvaitin, considers the world, including
pramANas, to be real, whereas we know that advaitins grant a
provisional (vyavahAra) status to the world. The same holds for avidyA
too, which is considered provisionally real. The same holds for jIva
too. Without such provisional reality assigned, it would not be
possible for the advaitin to even enter into a debate with the
dvaitin. For example, the advaitin could trivially dismiss the
dvaitin's objection that there is anyonyAshraya between avidyA and
jIva in this way. avidyA does not exist at all and jIva is
Brahman/Atman (vAcaspati says: na khalu jIvashcidAtmano bhidyate), and
therefore, the charge of anyonyAshraya between jIva and avidyA is
meaningless. But the advaitin also has to be make sure he answers the
dvaitin's objection in the vyavahAra realm. Hence, he invokes the
anAditva argument, which is also supported by the texts.
