Namaste

Pl. read what Srinath Vedagarbha writes in this post.  I spoke to Sri Mani
Dravida SastriNaH on this and he immediately said: the very opening topic
in the khandanakhandakhAdyam is this and he has concluded that 'there is no
need for such a condition' (that srinath is talking about).

I saw your write up:

http://eng.lalitaalaalitah.com/2012/11/khandana-khanda-khadya-with-sharada.html

If possible, could you kindly elucidate that topic for the benefit of all
of us?

BTW, did you get the copy of dvA suparNa from bangalore?  Pl. let me know.
