The objection of anirvachnIyatvam of avidyaa is also one the seven 
objections raised by Ramanuja in his Shree Bhashya while criticizing the 
avidya aspect in advaita, while still stating that the anaadi avidyaa is 
the root cause for samsara of jiivas.

brahmAshrita mUlAvidyA is anirvachaneeya says vyAkhyAnakAra-s.  But 
bhAshyakAra does not say avidyA is sadasad vilakshaNa, in geeta bhAshya he 
counts avidyA lakshaNa-s and says, agrahaNa, anyathAgrahaNa and saMshaya. 
He does not say it is anirvachaneeya.  In adhyAsa bhAshya too I think he 
does not concede that avidyA is anirvachaneeya...But he attribute this 
tattvAnyatva to avidyA kalpita nAma rUpAtmaka mAya.  But if we equates 
avidyA with mAya, then theory  that says avidyA is anirvachaneeya holds 
good. 

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
