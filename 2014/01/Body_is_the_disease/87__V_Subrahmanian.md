I doubt whether the problem with bIjAnkura discussed in the bhAmatI is
anavasthA.  From the passage cited it looks like chakrakApatti (circular
dependence) and anyonyAshraya (mutual dependence).

It is precisely to overcome this problem that the vivaraNa takes the stand
that Brahman is the Ashraya and viShaya for avidyA:

Ashrayatva-viShayatva-bhAginI nirvibhAga-chitireva kevalA

[The locus and object of avidyA is none other than the undifferentiated
(not yet differentiated as Ishwara and jIva) Pure Consciousness Brahman
alone.]  For such a pratijnA the hetu is given in the next line:

pUrvasiddha-tamaso hi pashchimo nAshraya bhavti nApi gocharaH

[The jIva which is a *product* of avidyA cannot be held to be the locus and
object of the avidyA which caused it (jIvahood).

Thus, based on the above logic and the shruti vAkyams in Br.up.1.4....it is
held that 'brahmaiva svAvidyayA samsarati iva, brahmaiva svavidyayA
muchyata iva.' [Brahman alone, owing to ignorance of itself appears to be
in samsara and brahman alone, owing to knowledge of itself, appears to be
freed from samsara.]  The explicit bhashya vAkyams for this position were
supplied from Br.up. 1.4.10.  Being caused by ignorance, samsAra and moksha
are not absolutely real events.

That is why we find that Shankara does not 'blame' the jiva or brahman for
the state of samsAra. 'avidyAkalpitam....avidyayA adhyAroitam...etc.'
The blame is put on avidyA.  And it is up to the one who acknowledges that
he is avidyAvAn to free himself from avidyA.

And as to how avidyA creates the jiva and also inheres in the jiva, here is
a verse illustrating:

svenaiva kalpite deshe vyomni yadvadghaTAdikam

tathA jIvAshritAvidyAm manyante jnAnakovidAH

[ a verse from the brahmabindupanishad(?) cited in the advaitasiddhi]

A pot is produced in space, to occupy a space and yet has space in it.  In
the same way the jIva originates in avidyA and has avidyA in it.  Thus
knowers hold.

Even when we say 'Brahman is the locus of avidyA', it is nothing but
'avidyayA jIvabhAvApattiH'  and 'vidyayA jIvabhAvanivRttiH'.

Also there is no problem with 'one bIja causing a different ankura and not
the same ankura which caused the original bija'.  We have a similar problem
expressed in the GaudapAdakArikA (IV.14 to 20)  'whether karma caused the
body or body caused karma'?  For a body to be there, there has to be karma
prior to it and for doing karma, there has to be the body.  In such cases
what is important is: the body which is a product of karma, causes further
karma (avidyA) and perpetuates it.  That way, it can be seen as a
perpetuation, strengthening, of avidyA.  It is admitted that the pUrva
adhyAsa is the cause for the uttara adhyAsa and thus the perpetuation of
samsara is accounted for.
