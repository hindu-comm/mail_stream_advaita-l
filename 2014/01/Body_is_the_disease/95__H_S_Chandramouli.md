H S Chandramouli

Dear Sri Anandji,

< Although avidyA is
spoken of as having Ishvara (Brahman) as the Ashraya, what is meant is that
the content of avidyA is Brahman, not the locus of avidyA, because it is
not possible for Brahman, whose nature is vidyA (knowledge), to be the
locus of avidyA.>

No doubt It is not possible for Brahman, whose nature is Vidya ( knowledge
) , to be the locus of avidya  if both have the same level of reality (
sama satta ).But It certainly is possible if they are different levels of
reality ( vishama satta ). And that is the situation here.

<   if you ask - whose is avidyA?
We say it is yours who ask thus. Again, in the gItA bhAshya, Shankara says
as much (13.2): avidyA kasya, yasya dRshyate tasyaiva. Whose is ignorance?
It is his by whom it is seen.>.

This is taken as a hint that Sri Bhagavatpada considers jiva as the locus
of avidya. You will notice that the entire statement refers to one level of
reality only, namely vyavaharika level. Then the locus could be jiva. But
the earlier question was with reference to Brahman being the locus of
avidya , which refers to two different levels of reality paramarthika /
vyavaharika  So the answer should take that into consideration. Once that
is done Brahman can only be the locus of Avidya.

Regards
