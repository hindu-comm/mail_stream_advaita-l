I will respond to your other e-mail later, but a quick response to the
above is necessary, especially if you claim to be an advaitin, playing
the "devil's advocate" on behalf of the dvaitin. Please remember that
one of the concepts that other schools find hard to grasp is the
three-valued truth-system of the advaitin. There is not just True and
False, but something called anirvacanIya or sadasad-vilaxaNa, which is
not classified either under True or False. When anAditva is used as a
hetu, it is not True, not False, but anirvacanIya in the advaitin's
system. Remember also that MadhusUdana is using this anirvacanIya hetu
to prove an anirvacanIya result, the lack of anyonyAshraya between
avidyA and jIva. So he is justified in doing so. Nowhere has
MadhusUdana or any other advaitin claimed that the anyonyAdhInatA
between avidyA and jIva is tAttvika. Also, avidyA itself is not False,
but anirvacanIya.
