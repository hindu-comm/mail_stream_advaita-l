So, are you saying explanation "jagan mithyA" too provisional? If so,
advitIyattva of Brahman cannot be said to be so sure, for the reason that
unless its counter weight jagat is mithya for sure. But you are not sure
about it when you declare *any* and *all* explanations can only be
provisional.

But shruti is considered mithyA and it cannot possibly generate yathArtha
jnyAna about non-duality of brahman at all. Read my reply to Sri.Anand for
the explanation on this topic.

anuyOgi in your assertion "non-duality of brahman is svAnubhUti" is
non-dual Brahman, which is not siddhA yet but only known from shruti. But
in your model, since suruti is also mithyA, under that circumstance there
is no hope to have definitive "idamittaM" type niScchaya jnyAna about
existence of non-dual Brahman let alone whether such anuyOgi is going to be
svAnubhUti for sure.

You tell me, do you want hear my niScchayAtmaka take on this topic? or do
you want to hear my belief that it is so?

That exactly is my point too -- you arrive at tattva *after* examining two
facts. But in case of current vEdAnta context, two aspects "vyavahAra" and
"pAramArtha" were made *before* we know for sure they are so. If you argue
they are accepted so based on dristAntha-s of our dream experience, mind
you, we have more dristAntha-s in life which are based on reality of two
facts and what prevent us extending reality to world based on such real
facts? Both the cases are in our experience, both are sama-bala. So, my
take is that one cannot do nirNaya based on dristAntha-s, instead they
should be based on pramANa-s.

jnAna about existence/nonexistence of vastu is different from
existence/nonexistence of vastu itself. One belongs to epistemology and
other belongs to ontology.

That exactly is my point too. Dividing the reality into  "vyavahAra" and
"pAramArtha" should be made *after* raise of pramA jnAna but not before.
The real issue is, unless one denies reality to this perceived jagat and
brings it under vyavahAra one cannot establish existence of pAramArtha. One
cannot establish existence of pAramArtha one cannot deny this vyavahAra.
This anynOnAShraya issue is covered in advaita-siddhi.

Not really. Tiger is not pramANa because in the dream it is not telling you
that there is highr tattva called "waking-state" and you should wake up to
that. It is accidental that there was higher state and woke up to it.

Let me ask you this -- when do you call a vastu or sAdhana a "pramANa"?  Do
you call it when it explicitly generate yathArtha jnyAna? or do you call it
so when it accidentally somehow triggers a jnyAna?  If you say it is later
case, then my contention is that you cannot say such sadhana is pramANa
until you verified resulting jnyAna is yathArtha and not a brAnti. In case
of shruti, you cannot call them as your pramAna-s until you verify your
jnAna about fact that you are indeed nirguNa brahman and then we can
certify shruti's assertion ahambrmAsmi and tatvamasi are indeed pramANa.
But they are so before the fact is a speculation.

This does not prove that mithyA pramANa-s have sAdakatvaM.

Such tattva jnAna is after the fact, not before. In siddhAnta, it is made
to believe it is so before the fact. There is no correlation between
dristAnta and sAdhya.

Above sAdhya applies to only those facts we know for sure they are the
result of perceiving illusory vastu. Extending this to this jagat wholesale
and declaring it is too mithyA, is indeed a leap of faith.
