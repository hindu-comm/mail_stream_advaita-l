​Actually, your mere reply has refuted you already, but let me show that
you can be refuted again.​

How ?
I say 'everything is mithyA' and everything means my sentence too. Now, you
see here svakriyAvirodha. How? What is svakriyAvirodha here?
My kriyA is uttering a sentence. I didn't oppose this kriyA by saying 'all
things mithyA'.
virodha is of two types: tena tadabhAvasya and tena tadabhAvavyApyasya.
mithyAtva is not abhAva of kriyA, so there is not first virodha.
mithyAtva is not kriyAbhAvavyApya, so there is not second virodha too.
The second virodha is only possible if utterance is accepted as vyApya of
mithyAtvAbhAva = satyatvam. I don't accept such vyApti, because utterance
is seen in svapnam also.
So, there is no virodha of mithyAtvam with my kriyA.
​According to vedAntin-s, the unreal-ness is not opposed to kriyA - is to
be noted.

​You are bringing words of advaitAchArya without understanding it.
When we say that 'everything is mithyA' then we mean that 'everything is
anirvachanIya'. We don't mean that 'everything is like horn of hair'.
So, my pratiGYA is also mithyA, i.e. anirvachanIya, but not non-existent.
If it were, you wouldn't have replied me.

​Yes, because words are not going to prove themselves real and you are
anyhow going to loose.

​How poor !!??
You don't know that you have made a rule while talking with others!!??

​I've noted every word.
You are making rule for me to accept things real in order to prove me
anything.
This rule is not accepted by us.
Why ?
The previous post is answer. The whole post applies here.

​This 'svakriyAvirodhAbhAva' is useful only when the above rule is
accepted. So, it's useless to show that you have no virodha.
Moreover, I've already said that mithyA things are not opposed with
unreal-ness and hence I also don't have svakriyAvirodha.

​Thanks, for letting me know about the name of work.
But, let me assure that I'm not just putting words from any book here. If
you or any dvaitI-mAdhva could assure me that he understands advaita-mataM
and it's technical words and use tenable logic, I'll accept his view after
testing. Till now I've not seen such a person.​
