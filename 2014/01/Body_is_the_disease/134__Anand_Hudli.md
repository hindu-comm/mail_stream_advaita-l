I would like to make two points here. First, advaitins are justified
in using provisional facts to derive provisional conclusions. I think
you would have no problem in agreeing to this. The question of the
locus of avidyA is a provisional one, since there is no avidyA at all
really, and the answer is also provisional. It is like asking - "In
the dream last night, was I sick or was it my friend?"  If one says
the locus is Brahman, it is a provisional answer. If one says the
locus is jIva, it is again provisional. The second point, which you
seem to be completely missing, is that provisional facts may, in fact,
be used to arrive at tattva itself. How? A frequent example cited is
that of a dream tiger that causes real fear and sweat upon waking up.
The dream tiger was provisionally real as long as tIhe dream lasted,
but it did have a real effect - fear and sweat. Another example is
that of the famous illusory snake. A person may really tremble in fear
and run away upon seeing the illusory snake. Taking even the shruti
vAkya "tattvamasi" as provisional, one may wake up to the reality of
Brahman.
