Dear Sri Srinath,

Just because Shankara said that in the adhyAsa bhAShya it does not mean
that Shankara has rejected the entire Upanishads, Brahmasutras and the
Bhagavadgita.  He has commented on them giving their place in the
brahmajijnAsA scheme.  A mixing up of the levels of reality alone would
result in the kind of objection you seem to be making.  For example, in
another post you said:

// With that, the only option remains for us is to say avidya is
attyanta-asat. This position will eliminate the very question and we do not
have to struggle to answer whether it is bramAshrita or jIvAshrita, end of
story.  This is a clear case of not going by the method Shankara teaches. //

Such a position is not held by the Advaita Acharyas.  If avidyA were to be
atyanta asat, like the hare's horn, there would be no pratIti, experience,
of it.  But the whole of Vedanta shastra rests on the fact of avidyA being
experienced by everyone.
