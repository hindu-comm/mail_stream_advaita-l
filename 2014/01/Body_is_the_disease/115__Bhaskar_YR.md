anAditva is in siddhAnta, no doubt, but at the same time it is also in the
siddhAnta that notion of anditva is valid only from  vyavahAra 
perspective.

Thus, any argument invoking such elements (anaditva in this case) which 
are
valid only vyavahara; is invalid argument at best, for vyavahAra is avidya
drusti and not tatava drusti (again is per siddhAnta only). Therefore, the
flaw still exist in Madhusudhan's justification.

I failed to see where exactly Sri Ananda Hudli prabhuji said that nAnA 
jeeva and their respective avidyA-s are pAramArthically anAdi??  Ofcourse 
sarva loukika, vaidika vyavahAra, shAstra & even bandha-mOksha everything 
within the realm of vyavahAra only.  The explanation that has been given 
with regard to jeeva-avidyA and anAditva too falls under vyavahAra only. 
What exactly is the problem here??  could you please elaborate.  I think 
problem starts only when one say even before the jeeva bhAva/srushti or 
even before the srushti, paramAtma who is ekamevAdviteeya had avidyA !! 
Because this attribution of avidyA to brahman even before anything would 
imply that pAramArthically brahman would have the avidyA.  No need to 
mention mUlAvidyA of panchapAdika vivaraNa entertains this type of 
thought. 

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
