This is very well said.  All the disagreement/questioning/objecting to
relating avidyA to Brahman arises from the thinking that 'Brahman is a
person' and that, a sarvajna.  The very idea of (Brahman) being a person is
rooted in avidyA.  Shankara Bhagavatpada has explicitly stated this in the
preamble to the Brahmasutra Bhashya while talking about the pramAtR,
pramANa and prameya.  That one is a pramAtR, knower, is the fundamental
expression of avidyA.  Advaita does not admit of pramAtRtva to Brahman.
So, the thinking that Brahman is a 'person', whether alpajna or sarvajna,
itself is incorrect.  That is the reason that even admitting of an
omniscient Ishwara, a 'person', is a concession, only to be corrected by
dropping even this admission.
