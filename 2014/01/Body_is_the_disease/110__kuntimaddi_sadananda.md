Anandji - PraNAms

Enjoyed reading your explanations - particularly aanaditvam aspect of avidya and jiiva. and their mutual dependence while both depend on something that is substantial. Yes one has to be careful in extending the illustrative examples beyond their applicability. 

Dvaita differs in that they do not accept Brahman as upadana kaaraNam for the creation. Pot and pot-space do not fit as the same upaadana kaaranam, unless one takes the Tai Up statements - aatmanaH aakaasha sambuutah. aakaashaat ... etc all the way to pRithivi. 

Many of the polemical arguments have limitations and that has to be understood before we apply hair-splitting arguments of Navya nyaaya. Many times it only helps in splitting the hair but not much in understanding the essential truth. Needless to say it is good time-passing for those who are interested.  

Hari Om!
Sadananda

 What madhusUdana is showing here does not require
 *exclusive*
 dependence. To explain, if A depends on B and B depends on A
 we say it
 is mutual dependence. It may very well be the case that A
 depends on B
 and other factors besides B, and B depends on A and other
 factors
 besides A. There is still mutual dependence between A and B,
 or
 anyonyAdhInatA, though it does not exclude other factors on
 which A an
 B may depend. The argument of madhusUdana is still valid.
 Taking a
 simple example, a merchant depends on his customers for
 earning
 revenue and the customers depend on the merchant to supply
 goods. We
 can say there is mutual dependence between them, although
 the merchant
 also depends on other factors, for example, suppliers of
 goods, and
 the customers depend on their employers or sources of
 income.

 This is not a correct example. We have to remember that
 vAcaspati also
 says avidyA and jIva are anAdi, without a beginning. You
 cannot point
 to a certain point in time in the past when the avidyA clay
 got
 transformed into a pot. The avidyA pot is anAdi. Therefore,
 the jIva
 pot-space is also anAdi. We have to examine the
 "manufactured" pot,
 not the pot during or prior to manufacturing, because there
 was no
 time when such a "manufacturing" event happened!

 The same fallacy I

 Again, the anAditva of both avidyA and jIva is sufficient
 here. I
 repeat there is no time when jIva was not there and only
 avidyA
 existed. Nor was there any time when avidyA was not there
 and only
 jIva existed. The two have always co-existed in a mutually
 dependent
 way. If you ask how avidyA and jIva are established in
 advaita, it is
 a different question. The answer is found in standard
 advaita texts
 and there is no need for madhusUdana to establish avidyA and
 jIva in
 this specific context.

 said to be existed

 and in turn, avidya

 Again, the anAditva of both avidyA and jIva is the point you
 are
 missing. The clay, pot, and pot-space analogy has
 limitations and
 cannot be extended too far. Precisely, you cannot say when
 the pot was
 manufactured from clay or when the AkAsha (space) got
 limited
 (avacchinna) by the pot. In everyday life, we know exactly
 when a pot
 is manufactured. The pot (pots to be precise, because
 vAcaspati says
 there are many jIvas, not just one) has been there from
 time
 immemorial.
