Dear sri Srinath Vedagarbhaji,

and not shruti. May be I am not reading you well?  >>

Absolutely. Just like other schools of thought, I thought Advaitic school
also can use yukti to support their contention. But I dont see why you came
to the conclusion you have. Anyway it is not something we need to quibble
about.

Regards
