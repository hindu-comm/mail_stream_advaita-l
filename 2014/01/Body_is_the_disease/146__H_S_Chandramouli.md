It is rather amusing, coming from a dvaitin and the advaitin is apolegetic
on this score of matabheda. Practically all nonadvaitic matas are  dvaita
matas ( not just the one advanced by Sri Madhwacharya ) and there are
literally deozens of them around. Each one is claiming supremacy for its
own version and disproving the claims of all others. Where is this mata
aikya the dvaitin is talking about. Being personal god oriented, it is only
reasonable to expect that within their own individual mata there may not be
any serious differences ( though this itself is not always true, but no
need to discuss them here ) . In fact Sri Gaudapadacharya highlights such
mata bheda among dvaitins in his Karika itself. So there is absolutely no
need for the advaitin to be apolegetic on this count.
