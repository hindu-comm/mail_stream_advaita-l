Therefore, vAcaspati declares (1.1.4), na avidyA brahmAshrayA, kintu jIve,
sA tvanirvacanIyetyuktam, tena nityashuddhameva brahma, the locus of
ignorance is not Brahman, but the individual soul, jIva.

Very interesting.  But I read somewhere that amalAnanda in kalpataru 
(which is an upa-vyAkhyAna to bhAmati) openly admitted the brahmAshraya 
avidyA!!??  And as you know it is said in bhAmati that during praLaya 
everything will be in kAraNAvidyA in the form of sUkshma shakti..how can 
it be different from vivaraNa's brahmAshrita avidyA pls. clarify. 

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar

PS:  would like to comment more on your mail and other mails on brahman's 
sarvajnatva but could not do that due to time constraints. Hopefully after 
Sankranti I shall be able to write something. 

HAPPY SANKRANTI TO ALL PRABHUJI-S.
