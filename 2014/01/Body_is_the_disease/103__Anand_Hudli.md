The difference between avidyA and jIva is this. From a pAramArthika
viewpoint, avidyA does not exist at all, while it is admitted that
jIva is the same as Brahman. Hence, it is not appropriate to say the
locus (Ashraya) of jIva is avidyA. However, if Ashraya is taken to
mean adhiShThAna, then the adhiShThAna of jIva is Brahman, since jIva
is Brahman with avidyA as the limiting adjunct.
