There is enough basis for the above.  For instance the BG 13th chapter
verses I cited before are the basis to hold that the Real and the unreal
are mixed up.  The BG 2.16 is also a proof for this, for the Lord says that
the Knower is the one who has understood these two: the Real and the Unreal
thoroughly. In fact the BG 2.11 'ashochyAn....' is itself one example where
right at the start of the discourse the Lord 'establishes' 'states' the
Truth, which is yet to be thoroughly analyzed and arrived at in the rest of
the chapters.  He points to shoka/moha as the result of error/bhrama.  The
pUrvapakShin's objection is directed, unwittingly, at the Lord and Veda
Vyasa for that is what is done in the Brahmasutra too.

Shankara comments:

//Therefore the knowers of Brahman, having known all about scholorship,
should try to live upon that strength which comes of Knowledge; having
known all about this strength as well as scholorship, he becomes
meditative; having known all about both meditativeness and its opposite, he
becomes a knower of Brahman.' -- ; na anusocanti, do not grieve for;
gatasun, the departed, whose life has become extinct; agatasun ca, and for
those who have not departed, whose life has not left, the living. The ideas
is, 'Your are sorrowing for those who are eternal in the real sense, and
who are not to be grieved for. Hence your are a fool!.'//

How is the Lord correct in talking about Brahmavit's dRShTi even before
teaching us what is Brahman, who is a Brahmavit and what his dRShTi is?

Same answer as said above.

The fundamental basis lies in the method of the Shruti.  It is another
thing that the opponents of Advaita do not see the method the shruti the
same way Advaitins see.  For Shankara, the very shruti passage: 'tarati
shokam Atmavit'  forms the basis to gauge the method of the shruti.  One
who is ignorant of the Atman (not an Atma-vit) is naturally in bhrama, for
he has invariably taken the anAtma to be real.  The shruti says:  the one
who 'knows' the Self crosses over sorrow'.  That is enough ground to infer,
from this pratyakSha shruti, that the cause of sorrow is ajnAna of the
Atman.  The remedy is to know the true nature of the Atman.  Hence jijnAsA
is required.  That is the method of the shruti. There is a host of shruti
passages which declare pratyakSha is not the ultimate / real pramANa.
Thus, there is no illogicality in proceeding, even at the outset, with the
knowledge that pratyakSha is not ultimately correct pramANa.

'asambhAvanA' is a defect which has to be removed by yukti, mananam.  'How
can the jiva be identical with Brahman? How could the world so clearly
experienced be mithyA?'  These are the questions, doubts, that trouble the
adhikAri who has had the shravaNam.  This asmbhAvanArUpa obstacle has to be
removed by mananam.  So, if after mananam the obstacle is cleared, that is
quite sufficient for the sAdhaka to pursue the path.

This above implication does not arise.  The entire gamut of Ishwara, veda,
sRShTi, upadesha, sAdhana and mokSha is held to be avidyA kalpita.  It
nowhere gives room to the conclusion that the veda is pauruSheya.
'anAditvena, apauruSheyatvena kalpita' .  This is an instance of
shAstrakRta adhyAropa, only to be negated by the shAstra itself in words
like 'vedA avedAH', etc.  Therefore, the consequences stated below never
arise:

All such objections arise out of wrongly understanding advaita.  Most of
the objections are raised by Shankara Himself and answered in the
bhAShya-s, including the one on the veda praamAnya.
