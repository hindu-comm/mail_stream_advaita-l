But shruti is considered mithyA and it cannot possibly generate yathArtha
jnyAna about non-duality of brahman at all. Read my reply to Sri.Anand for
the explanation on this topic.

If I remember right in the arabhaNAdhikaraNa bhAshya (2-1-14) shankara 
exactly takes this question and answers :  kathantu asatyena vedAnta 
vAkyena satyasya brahmAtmatvasya pratipattirupapadyeta??  Kindly go 
through this bhAshya vAkya and let us know what is the problem in this 
bhAshya's clarification. 

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
