If so then why quote such non-exclusive dristAnta for alleged exclusive
sAdhya? Per strict nyAya, this will attract ativyApti flaw in the cited
dristAnta, for the sAdhya was about exclusivity.

That anAditva argument is only from vyavahAra perspective, for per
siddhAnta time itself is mithya. Your argument, supporting vAcaspati's
stand, is sva-vachana virOdha if not apasiddhanta,  per your position here

anAditva is in siddhAnta, no doubt, but at the same time it is also in the
siddhAnta that notion of anditva is valid only from  vyavahAra perspective.

Thus, any argument invoking such elements (anaditva in this case) which are
valid only vyavahara; is invalid argument at best, for vyavahAra is avidya
drusti and not tatava drusti (again is per siddhAnta only). Therefore, the
flaw still exist in Madhusudhan's justification.

I am bit skeptical on Madhusudhan's disposition of certain siddhAnta
aspects, for he is not fully complaint with the main stream. After all the
lengthy arguments in advaitasiddhi, at the end he concludes that he does
not know anybody/anything more higher than Sri.Krishna thereby placing
Ishwara over and above nirguNa-brahaman.
