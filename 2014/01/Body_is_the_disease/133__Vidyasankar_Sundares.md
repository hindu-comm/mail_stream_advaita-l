No, the point you were making was about bheda in general, for pramANa-prameya
vyavahAra, not about the narrow question of upAsana, nor about which Sruti can
be cited in support of which position. But, I'll let that pass.

My point was to ask you to ponder over the utility of upAsana in the first place. It is
admittedly something that presumes bheda, but it is also a recommended means, 
highly so, for going past bheda to abheda.

No, YOU were saying that. You argue that the pUrvapakshin considers pramANa-s to
be tAttvika "real" but that siddhAntin sees them only as provisional. You then assert
that provisional pramANa-s *cannot* be used to arrive at tAttvika conclusions. You
are effectively trying to stack the deck against the siddhAntin, and trying to declare
his defeat before a vAda even begins. Essentially, YOU are claiming that siddhAntin
is not even capable of entering into the vAda.

All *I* am saying is that, even if so,  under your premises, the siddhAntin can indeed
enter into the vAda and that the victory of the siddhAntin can be well established. I
would suggest you read the two earlier responses by Sri Lalitaalaalita very carefully.

Again, you are missing the point. Equating the AtmA with vAg-agocara brahman is
not something established by logical argument. It is a *given*. Sruti says so.

Not so. We do have an answer: "go to Sruti." Whether it is upadeSasAhasrI or the
khaNDana-khaNDa-khAdya or advaita-siddhi, that answer has not changed. If that
is an invalid position for you, that is a pity indeed. 

Best regards,
Vidyasankar
