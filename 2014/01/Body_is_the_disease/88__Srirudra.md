Dear
If it is said Jiva is Brahman affected with Avidhya then where was Avidhya subsisting?Was it separate from Brahman?How can it be independent.?As per Advaita Brahman is without a second.If Avidhya  is within Brahman or part of Brahman what was the necessity for Brahman to imbibe Avidhya to take the position of Jiva?May be my thinking is wrong or needs correction.
