I am not denying there are pramANa-s for anAditva of tatva-s, but just
reminding that they are not so under Shankara's general stand of "sarvE
pramANapramEyavyavahArA loukikA vaidikAscha pravrutaH sarvANi cha ShAstrANi
vidhipratiShEdamOkShaparANi "

So, BG quote is admissible if it coming from someone who is outside of
Shankara's siddhAnta. The rest of your elaboration on BG's quote is
educational if not  asangati for the argument.
