But vAcaspati does not say that the locus of jIva is avidyA.

praNAms Sri Ananda Hudli prabhuji
Hare Krishna

As we know jeeva is kevala parikalpita due to upAdhi saMbandha.  yAvadeva 
cha ayaM budhyupAdhi saMbandhaH tAvat jeevasya jeevatvaM saMsAritvaM 
cha..paramArthastu na jeevO nAma budhyupAdhi sambandha parikalpita 
svarUpavyatirekeNa asti...clarifies shankara in sUtra bhAshya.  So, assume 
that there is jeevatva we need upAdhi...so, what exactly is this upAdhi?? 
is this avidyAkruta ?? if the answer is yes for this, then we have to go 
by vivaraNakAra-s brahmAshrita mUlAvidyA which is the locus of jeevatva or 
socalled jeeva's upAdhi.  If the locus to this sOpAdhika jeeva is not 
brahmAshrita avidyA then what exactly is the cause of this upAdhi which is 
in turn the main cause of jeeva's parichinnatva??  Please clarify.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
