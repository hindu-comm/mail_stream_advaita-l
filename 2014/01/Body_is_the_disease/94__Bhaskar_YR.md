That is why, the question, "what is the necessity for brahman?" is 
ultimately unanswerable. It presumes that brahman should have a purpose. 
When the upanishads say, so'kAmayata, or tad aikshata, they do not imply 
that there was any greater purpose behind that kAma or IkshaNa.

Yes, according to strict advaita there is no creation, no mumukshu, no 
mOksha...But whenever shruti talks about srushti, it says so just to drive 
home the point that there is nothing apart from that...kArya-kAraNa 
anayatvaM or sarva vyApakatva of brahman.  So, srushti para vAkya-s is not 
strictly meant to advocate srushti.  It is (srushti para shruti)  only a 
part brahma jnAna para mukhyArtha.  sarvasrushti prakAraH jeeva-paramAtma 
ekatvabhuddhyavatArAya upAyaH asmAkaM...........tasmAt utpatyAdi shrutayaH 
AtmaikatvabhudhyavatArAyaiva nAnyArthAH kalpayituM shakyAH..clarifies 
shankara in kArikA bhAshya.  So, as your goodself observed sokAmataya or 
tad aikshata etc. is there in shruti to establish the shruti's antima 
siddhAnta i.e. Atmaikatva.
