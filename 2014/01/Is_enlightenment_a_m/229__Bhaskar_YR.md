So what exactly is this enlightenment, and why do people speak of it in 
terms of experience (which implies duality)?

praNAms 
Hare Krishna

freedom from avidyA and allowing the jnAna to shine on its own is called 
mOksha in advaita..All efforts needed to get rid of avidyA, once it is 
done, jnAna would shine on its own, without any effort from our side.  It 
is like removing the dirt on the diamond and allowing the diamond to show 
its natural effulgence.  Any individual peculiar experience is not pramANa 
to determine whether one is enlightened or not...

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
