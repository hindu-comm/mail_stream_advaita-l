praNAms Sri Sadananda prabhuji
Hare Krishna


Most of these questions will get answered and misconceptions will be 
resolved if one studies Vedanta under a traditional teacher or sampradaya 
teacher. 

>  But it is quite unfortunate that within saMpradAya there is difference 
of opinion with regard to ekatva jnAna and ekatva anubhava.  According to 
some traditional Acharya-s, only Atmaikatva jnAna is not enough it should 
lead us to the practical experience of that jnAna and that ekatva can be 
experienced only in one particular state which is not like our normally 
experienced states i.e. jAgrat, svapna & sushupti. 

Enlightment is not some experience but clear understanding that I am 
Brahman and not the BMI that I take myself. One cannot judge whether 
another is enlightened or not.

>  But as we know from some prakaraNa grantha-s that there exists 
gradations in paramArtha jnAni-s and the gradations will be determined 
through the method they adopt to come back from that particular state of 
experience.  So, according to some advaita Acharaya's only jnAna is not 
enough we have to practically experience that jnAna.  It is like, reading 
and understanding the methods of swimming is not enough one has to dive 
deep in the river to experience the joy of swimming. 

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
