Friends,

Why is the Self equated with Brahman? It is confusing because we only know the personal self, the ego, so why is Self always used interchangeably with Brahman? 


I am not sure if my question is clear. I can understand saying, "You are Brahman" etc., but 'You are the Self' doesn't make sense. The self, by definition, can only be a personal self - an individual thing with names and forms - so equating it with a formless Brahman is also confusing..

Some insights, please .............

Suresh
