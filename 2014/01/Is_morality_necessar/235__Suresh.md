Whether we call it dharma or morality, is it salvific? That's the main point of my topic. In my opinion, morality/dharma is not salvific. Knowledge/Jnana alone is salvific, nothing else is. They may have practical value - even eating and sleeping have practical uses - but they don't lead to liberation.

Hinduism speaks in terms of Dharma and Adharma and not moral or immoral. And Dharma is very important. With Dharma Anushtana, there is no Chitta-Shuddhi and without Chitta Shuddhi, no Moksha.

This is the logic, basically. Suffice it to say that for theistic religions, morality is perhaps as important as faith.

Only knowledge between real and unreal can. So morality, as far as I can see, has utilitarian value - the same value that 'dream water' has for a dreamer. But does it have any salvific value at all?

>Again, I am not attacking morality or moral people - but isn't it silly in the context of advaita to see morality as something mighty important? Knowledge alone is salvific - morality is simply useful for us to carry on at the worldly, vyavaharika level. But to obsess over moral codes, to constantly think in terms of dos and don'ts, rights and wrongs - isn't that unnecessary for an advaitin?
