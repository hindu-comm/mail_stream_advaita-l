Dear Friends,

Pranams to all.


I have read some of the responses to the question relating to the necessity of morality or code of conduct for salvation. In this regard, I would like to point out some statements by some eminent sages and saints like Sri Ramakrishna Paramahamsa. Sri Ramakrishna once scolded a man pretending to be a saint, while pursuing shady activities without any scruples. That fellow told him: "I know I am Brahman and that is enough. It is only my body which is indulging in the shady activities and that does not affect my being Brahman. Upon hearing this, Sri Ramakrishna told him:"Fie on your brand of Vedanta. I spit on it." This means, that a person professing to be a saintly character has to be saintly in thought, word and deed. Otherwise, it is mere parroting of words from scriptures and mere pretense, which can not take/lead anyone towards his natural state or Moksha. Even the pontiffs or Peetadhipathis of Sringeri (E.g. Sri Chandrashekara Bharathi Mahaswami, Sri
 Abhinava Vidya Teertha Mahaswami and Sri Bharathi Theertha Mahaswami and Kanchi (E.g: Sri Chandrashekarendra Saraswathi Mahaswami) have made statements to the same effect that one's words/speech, mind and action must be in tune with righteousness or else, they will be doomed to failure. We also have an example of a rogue pretending to be saintly and abusing Sri Ramana Maharishi during his earlier years in Arunachala. He pretended to be saintly and abused Sri Ramana Maharishi publicly and later paid for it heavily, because his pretense was not backed up by righteous living. Without steadfast and unpretentious righteous living, how can one attain Chittha Shuddhi, which alone can lead to the steady abidance in one's natural state as Sat-Chit-Ananda, which is Jnana and Moksha?
Thanks for the clarifications in advance. My humble pranams, Ramesh

Namaste,

While living in vyavahArika satya i.e. day-2-day affairs, we have to abide
to general and smriti laws. While meditating, we try to transcend duality
by practising abheda bhakti. If, by power of meditation, you are able to
separate yourself as witness and still able in interact, then such a person
will not commit any crime.

Advaita does not give license to go crazy :)

We try to find doSa darshana (fault finding) in samsAra and try to see the
temporary nature of this world and it's objects. By doing this, we practice
vairAgya with the help of viveka. We do not reject anything, we neglect it
i.e. stay neutral. No one is perfect, so there are lapse here-n-there.
Until you do not reach the 'other shore', it's 'work in progress'. So
seeing unexpected behoviour does not mean that someone is not making an
effort the advaita way. It may be a lapse on his part, but soon, his viveka
buddhi will make him realize and he will again 'be back on track'. Advaita
does not say, - do not make any effort to remove illusion or mAyA.

Also in case of Jivan mukta, as VidyAraNa SvAm in PancadaSI says, for Jivan
mukta, he realizes that this world is mithyA. But this does not mean that
the world vanishes. It is present, but Jivan mukta knows that it is not
real. Or he may realize that 'everything else is Brahman'.
