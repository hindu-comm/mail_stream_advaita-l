Namaste,

While living in vyavahArika satya i.e. day-2-day affairs, we have to abide
to general and smriti laws. While meditating, we try to transcend duality
by practising abheda bhakti. If, by power of meditation, you are able to
separate yourself as witness and still able in interact, then such a person
will not commit any crime.

Advaita does not give license to go crazy :)

We try to find doSa darshana (fault finding) in samsAra and try to see the
temporary nature of this world and it's objects. By doing this, we practice
vairAgya with the help of viveka. We do not reject anything, we neglect it
i.e. stay neutral. No one is perfect, so there are lapse here-n-there.
Until you do not reach the 'other shore', it's 'work in progress'. So
seeing unexpected behoviour does not mean that someone is not making an
effort the advaita way. It may be a lapse on his part, but soon, his viveka
buddhi will make him realize and he will again 'be back on track'. Advaita
does not say, - do not make any effort to remove illusion or mAyA.

Also in case of Jivan mukta, as VidyAraNa SvAm in PancadaSI says, for Jivan
mukta, he realizes that this world is mithyA. But this does not mean that
the world vanishes. It is present, but Jivan mukta knows that it is not
real. Or he may realize that 'everything else is Brahman'.
