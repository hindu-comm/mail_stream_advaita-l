Dear Sri Sureshji,

Ultimate Truth in Advaita is not realized as " no creation everything is
unreal " etc. Advaita is personal realization ( aparoksha anubhava ) , in
an effortless natural involuntary manner that " this entire creation is not
distinct/ not different / not apart from I the Consciousness " . This
Realization is of the same nature as the effortless natural involuntary
conviction we all have today that " I am  distinct / different / apart from
the entire rest of the creation " . This is the only way Realization is
achieved in Advaita as clearly evidenced by Mahavakyas such as Tatvamasi/
aham brahmasmi etc. It is not merely acceptance of this statement or
understanding of this statement or even developing expertize in dealing
with these statements even as per the shastras that results in the Goal. It
is only the conviction as mentioned above that results in realizing the
Goal.

Now the shastras do not merely state what is to be achieved. They also show
the way ( sadhana/marga ) to achieve this Goal. Till the Goal is reached,
THIS IS OF CRUCIAL IMPORTANCE  , the advaitin must necessarily scrupulously
follow the dos and donts prescribed by the shastras . There is no other
way. BG 16th chapter enumerates in a consolidated manner the mental
attitude one should develop as part of this sadhana. Even following a few
of these puts the sadhaka in an autopilot mode and helps him through the
pursuit of the sadhana. Morality finds a prime place in these dos and donts
 So have a go and Happy Journey.

Regards
