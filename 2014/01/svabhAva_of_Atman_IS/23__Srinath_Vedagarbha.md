What you say makes sense only if such "ONLY Advitia Cause" is real one. But
in the siddhAnta, this jagat is not really "CREATED" but just arOpita. So
all your subsequent arguments based on this wrong premise just does not
work.

It is basically same, since jagat is aarOpita only, it's "ONLY Advitia
Cause" is also equally aarOpita and hence all sarvajnattavam etc. based on
such creator-ship hEtu are all just aarOpita guNa-s.

When Ishwara is aarOpita (meaning Ishwara is considered to be existing only
during one is under the spell of avidya), how can such Ishwara's guNa-s are
not kalipta?

However much one does not wants to accept Ishwara is avidya kalipta in all
their humble bhakti mode, but unfortunately it is so under advaita
siddhanta and no escape for such person as long as he takes shelter under
siddhanta.
