Jiva is the wave; Ishvara is the ocean; Brahman is water.

Hare Krishna

Yes, without water there is no ocean nor wave...water is the cause for 
this ocean as well as wave IOW, wave, ocean is nothing but water...shruti 
confirms this by saying Atma vA idamagra Asit, ekamevAdviteeyaM. which 
thought of becoming many. (sO kAmayata bahusyAm prajAyeyeti, Atma 
svayamakuruta)

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
