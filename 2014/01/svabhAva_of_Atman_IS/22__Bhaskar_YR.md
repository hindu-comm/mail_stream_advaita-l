(c) brahman ( nirguna )  with brahman ( in the form of  mayopadhi )
 becomes Iswara and engage himself in creation.

Rest of your arguments perhaps supports only this contention. I am not 
sure
of course. You need to judge. As for me this helps in understanding the
bhashya portion more easily.

What I am trying to say here is brahman even without the aid of any karaNa 
(upAdhi) would have the svabhAva of sarvajnatvaM as against the contention 
that ONLY ishawara would have sarvajnatva and sarvashaktiva qualities, and 
without srushti or without ;sarva' brahman would be stripped off this 
inherent nature. 

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
