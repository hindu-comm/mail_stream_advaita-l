If sarva is ArOpita, then jnAna about such aarOpita sarva is not yathArtha
but a brAnti. This would render brahman as having avidya!

You need to ask yourself a question -- in what sense having sarvajnatvam as
svabhAva for Brahman is superior when such jnAna about aaropita sarva is a
brAnti ?

So, either say sarvajnatvam is only to Ishwara and Ishwara himself is
aaropita; or say sarvajnatvam is natural svabhAva of Brahman but "sarva" is
NOT aaropita (but as sattya as Brahman itself). You cannot have part from
one and part from another one. This looks like another case of bhAga-tyAga
nyAya to me!
