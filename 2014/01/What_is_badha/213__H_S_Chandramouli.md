Yes Sri Sureshji. Badha is used to discriminate between the levels of
Reality.

Badha is Negation. Things like serpent in the rope, silver in nachre etc
are negated by the knowledge of rope, nachre etc. Any thing which is
negated by any knowledge other than  that of Brahman  is said to be of
Pratibhasika level of Reality. On the other hand creation which we
experience can be negated and is negated ONLY by the knowledge of Brahman.
They are said to enjoy Vyavaharika level of Reality. Brahman, the Ultimate
Reality , cannot be and is not negated at any time ( past, present and
future ) , state ( waking, dream, deep sleep ) , as well as during
creation/sustenance/destruction. It is said to be Paramarthika level of
Reality. From this point of view, Badha could be said to be << personal (
also called immediate or aparoksha ) determination of mithya ( or levels of
Reality ) status >>.
