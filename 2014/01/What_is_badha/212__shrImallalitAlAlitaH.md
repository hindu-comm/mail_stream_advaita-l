Technically, bAdha is a any vR^itti which reveals abhAva of the thing which
was perceived as existing by other pramANam.
So, if you saw silver = if silver was known existing in front by a eyes
then, the pramA= vR^itti which reveals absence of silver in the perceived
place is bAdha of silver.

The sublimation = layaH of silver(anything created by ignorance) is result
of this bAdha = specific vR^ittiH. Hence, treating cause-result once, we
use the word bAdha of sublimation too.
