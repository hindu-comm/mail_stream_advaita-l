Dear Murali,

A commentary on the Ramayana states, "dhanadavyavahArastu
katipayatridashebhyo bhagavadAjnayA katipayadhanadAnamAtrAt". Kubera's
activity consists of giving away wealth to several deities according to the
orders of Bhagavan. His position is more or less like that of a treasurer.
Although he is in charge of the treasury, he does not get attached to the
wealth and gives it away when commanded by the Lord. So he has the perfect
"tyAgabhAva." One can have this "tyAgabhAva" only if he/she is not attached
to his/her wealth and possessions and rather feels, 'This wealth is not
mine but belongs to God." I remember a PurandaradAsa song which goes like
this, "nandEnado illi nindE idellavu nandanandana mukunda govinda..."
Youtube has a video ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlw-w0F0Cbc) sung by
Hiranmayee in Raaga Mohana/Bhoopali.

Anand
