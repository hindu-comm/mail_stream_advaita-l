PraNAms

Sunrise is perceived and seen, or regarded in a place where we see the skyline. From this line we can have a sight of the rising sun. If the symbol of an illusion is quite true, is it necessary to ignore the beauty of such a scene ?
I know through my studies that Earth goes round and not the Sun. Anyway this knowledge doesn't inspire me or doesn't link me to the Brahman, the sunrise does. 

Om

Objet: [Advaita-l] Maya and Sunrise Example


Friends,

Most people explain maya using the snake-rope example (or silver, mirage etc.), but wouldn't the sunrise example be better? Rope-snake example leads to the problem: there is an error in perception, which is later on corrected. In sunrise example, there is no error in perception. According to perception - which is never corrected - sun rises, period. 


Point is, the event called sunrise is false, yet we perceive it 100 times out of 100 .... establishing that even if perception isn't faulty, it still gives us wrong knowledge. Also that if something is perceived, it doesn't necessarily have to be true. Sunrise (jagat) is clearly perceived, yet it is false. Earth's movement (Brahman) is not perceived, yet it is true. 


So wouldn't the sunrise example be better in explaining maya, ignorance, and all the rest? 


Thanks,
Suresh
