Thank you Sadananda ji,

This is what I meant. I thought that it is not necessary to explain to
members who are more knowledgeable then me :) So I just pointed out :)

After clouds are veiled, we know that

1. Sun was always shining (always Brahman)
2. Sun was never veiled (covered by ignorance / got deluded)
3. Our observation is relative reality and not absolute reality. Person
sitting on Sun does not experience veiling

I think that the concept of maya translated as illusion is over blown, out
of context. For meditation purpose, we need to accept vyavahAika satya, but
make attempts to progress. It is vyavahArika satya that makes advaita
definitely startable (i.e. advaita can be definitely started). This is not
to say that this world is not illusion, but our concept of illusion is that
which is something not present and is of momentary nature.

Like if I see a table, but is mere laser projection, then my hand will move
right through the table, but if table is real, then since table is solid,
my hand cannot pass through table. But from broad POV, where even kalpas
are explained in Puranas-, the creations and destruction also look
momentary. So life of earth itself is momentary. Hence our life is also
momentary when compared to continuous creation and destruction. We
generally do not have broad vision.

We need to understand that mithyA means not real and not unreal is said
from POV of absolute reality. But when we are under ignorance, just like we
see sun veiled by clouds, we find it difficult to accept this world as
illusion. The definition of reality given in shastras (BG 2.16) is what
makes this world as *Not Real*. It is non-Self and hence should be
renounced mentally. It is not destruction but negation that makes the world
as an illusion. MithyA means *to know* that the world is not real.

Apart from this topic, I feel that Sri Ramana Maharhi and Sri VidyAraNa
SvAmI (in panchdaSI) have a some similarly in teaching like giving example
of

1. Jivan mukta
2. Nivakalp samadhi and sahaj samadhi
3. Controlling mind is like throwing net on bird so that it does not move
4. E.g. of missing the 10th person
5. Refutation of zero state (atman is not zero)

Reading first panch daSI and then reading Ramana Maharshi's works like

40 verses on reality
Who and I
Upadesha saram

Makes me to think that Maharhi's works are essence of what VidyAraNa swAmI
says. I have a copy of Hindi Translation of PanchdaSI by Swami Shankarnanda
of Chinmaya Mission.

I was thinking of mapping similar quotes, but it is too much time consuming.

nothing but unhappiness" - Bhagawan Ramana Maharshi

He who has faith has all
He who lacks faith, lacks all
It is the faith int he name of lord that works wonders
