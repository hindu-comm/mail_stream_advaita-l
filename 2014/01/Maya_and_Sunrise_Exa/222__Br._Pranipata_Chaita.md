When under the influence of mAyA, one erroneously perceive snake and suffer fear, trembling etc., there is another one, tattva-darshI, perceiving existing rope and free from fear etc., from whom, by duly approaching and enquiry, the error in perception can be overcome. 

If sunrise/sunset is adhyAsa, the rope/snake or silver/nacre is adhyAropa, which has inherent technique for realizing the tattva, by apavAda, used by shAstra/AcArya.

In Shri Guru Smriti,
Br. Pranipata Chaitanya
