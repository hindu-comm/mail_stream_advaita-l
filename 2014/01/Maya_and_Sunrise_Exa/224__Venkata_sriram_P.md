Namaste All,

One of the revered members corrected my post.  Here it is:

...................
tvaM (you) AtmanaH (from yourself) enam kAmaM (this desire), nAshanaM (destroyer) shreya-prApti-hetoH GYAna-viGYAnayoH (of GYAna & viGYAna which are means to shreyas), prajahi (renounce). 

kAma is the destroyer of GYAna-viGYAna, hence declared as enemy, not the other way round.
.....................

My pranams to the revered member for correcting me.

regs,
sriram

 Namaste,

 Thus mentioned in 3rd chapter of BG as:

 dhUmEnAvriyatE vahniryathAdarshO malEna cha
 yathOlbEnAvrutO garbhastathA tEnEdamAvrutaM 

 Just as 

 1) fire is camouflaged with it's smoke; 
 2) the mirror is covered with dust; 
 3) embryo is covered with membrane;

 similarly, the jnAna is camouflaged with kAma

 And the locus of this kAma is indriyAs and antahkaraNa vide
 the subsequent sloka:

 indriyANi manO buddirasyAdhiSTAnamuchyatE
 EtaivimOhayatyESa jnAnmAvrutya dEhinAM

 Subsequently, Acharya Sankara says that:

 jnAnaM shAstrataH AchAryataH cha AtmAdInAM avabOdhaH;
 vijnAnaM vishESataH
 tadanubhavaH tayOH jnAnavijnAnayOH shrEya prApti hEtvOH
 nAshanaM prajahi
 hi AtmnaH parityaja ityarthaH

 With the help of shAstra and Acharya upadesha, one gets the
 knowledge (jnAna) about what is self and what is non-self;
 what is vidya and what is avidya. After contemplating
 on these principles, the he abides in swa-swarUpa sthiti
 which is called "vijAna". Thus, these two ie., jnAna
 (shAstra jnAna) and anubhUti (vijnAna) both destroys the
 kAma which is seated in antahkaraNa.
