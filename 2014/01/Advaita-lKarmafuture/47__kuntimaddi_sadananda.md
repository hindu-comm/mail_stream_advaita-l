Krishnamurthyji - PraNAms

Yes aatma is all pervading eternal and ever pure and cannot be tainted by anything.

The discussion of karma and its locus does not apply to pure aatma.

It applies to jiiva who has the notion that I am this - where this starts buddhi, mind, senses etc - It is the jiiva that has ignorance and hence takes himself to be a jiiva with limited upaadhis. All pervading consciousness that reflects in the subtle body is chidaabhaasa and this conditioned consciousness has the notion that I am independent conscious entity different from other (conditioned) consciousness(es). Hence the divisions - jiiva-jiiva, jiiva-jagat, jiiva-Iswara, Iswara-jagat and internal differences in the jagat - All differences are taken to be real. Hence the whole package is only in vyavahaara. Your question involves jumping from saamanya chaitanya to vishiShTa chaitanya. This was extensively discussed by Swami Paramarthanandaji during vicharasagara text that you are familiar

Hari Om!

 Dears
 The Karmas good or bad leave their effects on the Atman
 which takes births to exhaust these effects and should
 strive to eliminate the accumulated ones and not to get
 loaded with future Karmas so that it gets liberation from
 the vicious cycle of births and deaths.This is my
 understanding.Jnnanam is the only way of salvation.Suddenly
 this doubt rose in me.When the Atman is not taintable
 -akasham nopa lipyathe-then why this Atman should be subject
 to the cycle of births and deaths.Athman takes the body and
 the body alone is subject to samsaric tribulations.Atman is
 just a witness and because of ajnana it gets identified with
 the body.My question is when Karmas are not going to taint
 the ever pure atman where is the cause for it is being
 hurled into samsara.Maybe I had missed core knowledge
