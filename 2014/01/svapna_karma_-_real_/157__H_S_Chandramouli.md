Even during waking state, many of our involuntary actions like breathing
which may harm bacteria etc, killing/harming insects/creatures while
walking etc  invite some papa karma phala which are said to be extinguished
by performance of nitya karma. The body will be involved in these acts even
during dream/sushupti states. Perhaps this is what is meant in the sankalpa
shloka quoted above.
