"AdiShTavAn yathA svapne rAmarakShAM imAM haraH, tathA likhitavAn
prAtaH prabuddho budhakaushikaH", Exactly as Lord Shiva instructed the
rAma rakShA stotra in the dream, the Rishi Budhakaushika wrote it down
upon waking in the morning. There are several instances of people
receiving instructions, mantras, etc. in a dream. The phala of such
things received in the dream is also felt in the waking state. I heard
the famous scholar Shri Ranganatha Sharma once remark that even if you
commit a sin in a dream, you have to do prAyashcitta (or something to
that effect). Also, I have heard some people say, as part of the
daily/special pUjA sankalpa, jAgratsvapnasuShupti-avasthAsu..., asking
for pApapariha
