Namaste,

.............

But can we chant this veda maNtra rAtri vyakhyadAyati purutra devya 
akshabhiH, vishvA adhi shriyOdhita etc.  sitting on the bed 

.............

Our rg veda acharya Br.Sri. Narendra Kapre ji advised us to chant this
after dinner and before retiring to bed. 

Just wash hands & feet, chant this sukta in puja room and then
retire to bed.  See that at the time of chanting, you are
not ashaucha condition.  

regs,
sriram
