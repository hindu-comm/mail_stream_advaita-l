So, this dosha does not pertain to Grihastaashramis?

praNAms
Hare Krishna

I think for gruhasthAshrami-s also this preservation of veerya is 
recommended.  After getting the satsantAna one has to observe celibacy 
(brahmacharya)  with the consent of spouse ( she should have equal 
susamskAra for this)  and channalize his retas for the higher pursuits.  I 
have read somewhere that the gruhasthAshrami should indulge in sex just to 
beget satsantAna and vamshOddhAra and to appease his kAma trushe..

Anyway, I must confess here that being a householder myself, these are all 
mere bookish knowledge for me and I am not following this sadAchAra in 
totality.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
