After reading dream tiger's real effect in waking, I am getting a new 
doubt, whether karma done in the svapna (for example abusing some one or 
hitting some one or giving something in charity  etc.) would give the 
'phala' in the form of pApa and puNya in waking??  Or do the karma-s done 
in svapna attract the corresponding 'phala' in waking?? I know am 
stretching this example and this analogy should not be used  for some 
other purpose but just curious if at all there is a possibility :-))

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
