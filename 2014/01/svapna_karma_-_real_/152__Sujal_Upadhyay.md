Hare Krishna Shri Bhaskar Prabhu ji

Does one have independent control over what we are going to dream,
can we plan a dream
Do dream continue from were it left last time you slept (like in case of
waking state)

OR

Are dreams extinguishing of your sukshma or unfulfilled desires. What you
cannot fulfil in day time, you try to achieve in night?

Is mukti a phala?

karma and phala are in duality only :D not in non-duality.

----

Sometimes dreams can indicate future happenings or someone may communicate
via dreams. This is something mystical. some say if you have a constant
dream say a person is trying to kill you are you are helplessly,
desperately trying to run away from him, then some say, you have an effect
of Shani dev.

----

Some yogi-s and some following new-age phenomenon say that their bodies,
Astral body travels when we are sleep and do some work according to the
evolution of ours. some highly divine souls may help people to heal.

----

suppose you have seen a beautiful girl ;) and then you visit an aquarium.
there you liked a fish. Both of them impressed your mind. In dream you may
get a vision of jal-pari (half women, half fish) says psychologists

In the same way, if you like something and there is similar vasana in you
then that may combine in dream.

e.g. you like to help others and then you see Superman :D, in dreams you
can become superman and save ;) ehh people, those who are in trouble.

If you have a sensual desire, which is natural, and you see someone
beautiful or you see sensual scenes then in night or in meditation, that
lady will keep coming and break the meditation. This is RambhA or MenakA.
Our own vasana. Technically it does not have a shape. it is unstable
energy. But it takes a shape whom we are comfortable like in this case a
shape of girl you were impressed.

So dreams are connected with what we experience in waking and sometimes
dreams indicate what will happen in near future.

But as far as karma phala is concerned, I don't think that dream karma can
give us fruits in waking, keeping aside mystical phenomenon. Dream is more
of a bhoga than karma. Just my 2 cents.

btw, have you experienced detachment? many doubts are uprooted only by
experience.

Hari Bol
Jai Shri Rama
