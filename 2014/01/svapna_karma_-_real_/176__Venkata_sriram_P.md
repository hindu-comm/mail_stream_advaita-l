Namaste bhaskarji,

........
Apart from this any other shloka needs to be chanted prabhuji?? 
........

rAtri sUktam of rg veda should be chanted for protection from rAtri-abhimAni-dEvata.

Namaste nitin,

........
this dosha does not pertain to Grihastaashramis?
........

There are brahmacharya niyamas for grihasthAs also which should
be followed.  bhagavAn rAmachandra followed this which is 
mentioned in Ananda rAmAyaNa.   If these niyamAs are
followed, then even grihasthAs are also called "nitya-brahmachAris"
like yOgeshwara kriSNa.

regs,
sriram
