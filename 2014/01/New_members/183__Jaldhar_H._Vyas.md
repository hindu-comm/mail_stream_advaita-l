Tattva vetta.


Parthiban K K
-------------

My humble pranams.

My name is Parthiban K K. Basically, I am a teacher of French and I am working 
in an international school in Tamilnadu. I believe that it was not my 
conscious effort, initially, to know about advaita but a gradual happening 
within me which led me towards Advaita like a fly drawn towards light. 
Bhagavan Ramana Maharishi's books have made a lasting impression on me and I 
prostrate to the great Maharishi. I, now, sincerely and firmly believe that 
Advaita philosophy is the only means of realizing the truth and establishing 
oneself in it, if fact, dissolve in the inner reality. Now, I would like to 
subscribe to the website. Kindly register me as a member.

Thank you,
