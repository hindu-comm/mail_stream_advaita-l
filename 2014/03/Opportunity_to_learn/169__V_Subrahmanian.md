Namaste

A close friend of mine, residing in Chennai, is willing to teach Sanskrit
through the medium of subhAShitam-s over Skype twice or thrice a week from
10 to 10.30 PM.  Those interested may contact me by private email and I
shall provide his contact details.  He can teach in Tamil, English and also
in Sanskrit.  Just one verse will be taken up per class for a detailed
analysis. Needless to say, this service is rendered free of cost to the
participants.

Pl. inform your friends too about this nice opportunity.

regards
