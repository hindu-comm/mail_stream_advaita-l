Namaste

I am confused by 'local mind' and 'global mind'. What is local mind? What
is global mind?

It is not correct to think human mind is not capable of Creating very
complicated Universe. Why? Because human mind can indirectly create very
complicated things. Kindly see the Most Exciting Realization called as
Technological Singularity. It is a time when Computer Intelligence will be
more than Human Intelligence. After this happens the 'future course of
human history is unpredictable or even unfathomable'. Robots may become
intelligent than Humans. But who created Computer nd Robots? Humans.

Like this it is possible the Jeeva can imagine and create very complicated
things like Computers and even God. The Power of Imagination is coming from
Maayaa. It is the Cause. But Maayaa is also imagined by Jeeva's Avidyaa.

The whole Universe is a mental Construction only in the mind of one Jeeva.
