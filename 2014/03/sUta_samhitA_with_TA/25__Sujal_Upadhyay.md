Namaste,

I am interested in buying Suta Samhita with Tatparya dipika of
Mahdavacharya (Vidyaranya Swami).

I found English / Hindi Version on
Flipkart<http://www.flipkart.com/susasamhita-tarparva-dipika-madhavacharya-english-hindi-reprint-1954-ed/p/itmdyumzc8eafr9e?pid=9788180901324&otracker=from-search&srno=t_1&query=susasamhita+&ref=1a55dd35-a5b1-4ae7-9e0d-05df4eb52c94>

Has anyone read this book?
How Is it.

The title contains typos, so by searching in flipkart, you may not get any
results

Title of book is

"
Susasamhita with Tarparva Dipika of Madhavacharya (English, Hindi) Reprint
of 1954 ed Edition
"

Generally, the book is either available in Sanskrit - Hindi or Sanskrit -
English.

Flipkart Customer care rep says that the book is not available in sanskrit
but in both english and hindi but he himself was not sure about it, as he
was talking from data available in his database.

I wish to buy Sanskrit - Hindi version if Available

Publisher is Publisher: Bharatiya Kala Prakashan and they also sell at same
rate. I checked their website too, but the description does not specify
language.
