SAdara praNAm,

A wonderful work indeed.
II contains summary of the important upanishads.
There is a saying that BhagavatpAda himself
referred the work 12 times! (who generally refer a work once only)
while writing commentaries on Upanishads.
To my knowledge there is an edition of Kailas Asrama

Namaste.
*Prof.sivakumarr*
