Sure !
This is not a Phd or something. It is a translation of sUtasaMhitA
according to TIkA of shrI-vidyAraNya and many pATha-bheda-s are in
footnotes. This is a new work.
And, if you would have read carefully, you could have easily found that
Taralabulu site is taking of sUta-saMhitA-mImAMsA and not sUta-saMhitA
with translation. And, you could also have found that the publisher
mentioned by the site is vidyAbhavan .... and not daxiNAmUrti-maTha.
