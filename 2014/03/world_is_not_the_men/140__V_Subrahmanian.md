Dear Sri Sada ji,


The bhAgavatam verse is not about any global mind called Hiranyagarbha.  It
is about the individual's mind who is being addressed in those verses.  The
verse is an upadesha for Uddhava, an individual and not Hiranyagarbha.  To
him the Lord says: whatever is comprehended by the instrumentality of the
mind, senses, etc. is mAyAmanomayam, an imagination, reverie.  The Lord is
not talking of Hiranyagarbha/Ishwara's creation for they do not use the
mind, senses, etc. for apprehending the world.  Also, it would be
irrelevant to Uddhava to talk of Ishwara's creation and asking him to see
it as mAyAmanomayam.  Uddhava cannot correct Ishwara's projection.

What the Jnani realizes is the path, practice, for the ajnani.  Also, in
the manIshA panchakam verse, the Jnani says: all this is imagined by me
through avidyA.  Where is avidyA for Jnani?

The shloka is addressed to the ajnani for contemplation, practice.  He is
not to be tied down to the local mind; he has to expand, elevate himself to
the higher prakriyA of eka jIva construct and view all others, others'
minds, etc. as the projection of his own mind.

In fact the question does not arise at all, as I pointed out that Shankara
Himself is commenting on the shruti-creation bahu syAm prajAyeya as
'rope-snake like projection, an imagination of the mind.'  It is already in
tune with the bhAgavatam /advaitamakaranada/manishApanchakam etc.  verses.
 So, if the charge of wrongly interpreting the bhAgavatam smRti verse is
raised, it is first applicable to Shankara.

Actually, the adhyAsa bhashya itself is the ground for the eka-jIva vAda
construct.  There itself we have the avidyA-base for the pramAtru, his
mind, sense organs, reactions, etc.

All these questions are answered by Advaitins.  There is anAdi adhyAsa and
the question of any prior knowledge of the object superimposed is not there
to be addressed.  It is enough if the object is unreal.

Actually in that very chapter, soon after the above referenced verses,
Vidyaranya wants the aspirant to take steps to eradicate the 'entire'
dvaitam.  pl. ref. to verses 38 onwards of that chapter.  He says: the
jIva-created dvaitam can be subdued during dhyAna/samAdh but that will not
put an end to his re-birth cycles.  For that he has to know that the entire
dvaitam (not just jIva-created) has to be known to be mithyA.
