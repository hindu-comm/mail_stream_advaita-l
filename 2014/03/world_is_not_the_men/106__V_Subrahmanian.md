Sri Shankara's commentary for the famous Br.up. 2.5.19 mantra 'indro
mAyAbhiH pururUpa Iyate...' would be a fine study for this topic:

...sa eva parameshwaro nAmarUpe vyAkurvANo rUpam rUpam pratirUpto babhUva.
...indraH parameshwaro mAyAbhiH prajnAbhiH
nAmarUpabhUtakRta-mithyAbhimAnaiH vA, na tu paramArthataH pururUpo bagurUpa
Iyate gamyate ekarUpa eva prajnAnaghanaH san avidyAprajnAbhiH.

//That same Lord, in the process of manifesting name and form, 'transformed
Himself in accordance with each form'.  .....The Lord on account of mAyA or
diverse knowledge, or (to give an alternative meaning) the false
identifications created by name, form and the elements, not in truth, is
perceived as manifold, because of these notions superimposed by ignorance,
although He is ever the same Pure Intelligence. //

Anandagiri gives the gloss: mAybhiH prajnAbhiH iti parapakShamuktvA
svapakShamAha: mithyAbhimAnaiH iti [Here this word is printed as
'mAyAbhiriti'.  I think it is a printing error.]
mithyAdhIhetubhUta-anAdyanirvAchya-daNDAyamAnAjnAnavashAdeSha bahurUo
bhAti....avidyAprajnAbhiH bahurUpo gamyate iti pUrveNa sambandhaH.

The purport is:  Shankara's preferred meaning for the mantra is: that owing
to the ignorance created mental impressions the multiplicity is perceived.

Shankara talks of the mithya abhimAna, in plural, for the causal entity of
creation.  He gives no clue to the Ishwara, saguNa brahman, as the creator
of the universe but explicitly opines, with the vA / alternative
explanation that creation is caused by erroneous identifications.  Surely
Brahman/Ishwara cannot have such wrong identifications.  These are possible
ONLY with the jIva.  Brahman, the Pure Consciousness, assumes, nay, is
perceived as (that is the meaning Shankara gives for the word 'Iyate' of
the mantra) multiplicity in Creation.

One can match this instance with the other famous instance of the Ch.Up.
6.2.3 too where Shankara uses this same method with reference to creation:

तत्सत् ऐक्षत ईक्षां दर्शनं कृतवत् । ....इदं तु चेतनं ईक्षितृत्वात् ।
तत्कथमैक्षत इत्याह - बहु प्रभूतं स्यां भवेयं प्रजायेय प्रकर्षेणोत्पद्येय ।
यथा मृद्घटाद्याकारेण यथा वा रज्ज्वादि सर्पाद्याकारेण बुद्धिपरिकल्पितेन । ..
..एवम् *ईक्षित्वा* तत्तेजोऽसृजत तेजः सृष्टवत् ।

Here too, as in the br.up. instance of Brahman assuming various forms,
through imagination, erroneously, otherwise the rope-snake analogy would be
out of place.

So, it is beyond doubt and disputation that according to Shankara creation
is a projection of the intellect which is, undoubtedly an upadhi of
Brahman.  This idea is brought out  by the 'ayamAtmA brahma' occurring in
the above cited Br.up. mantra itself for which Shankara comments:

//kim punaH tannirantaram brahma? ayamAtmA.  Ko asau? yaH pratyagAtmA
draShTA, shrotA mantA, boddhA, vijnAtA sarvAnubhUH sarvAtmanA
sarvamanubhavati iti sarvAnubhUH ityetadanushAsanam, sarvavedAntopadeshaH//

[What is that homogenous Brahman (that was described as indro
mAyAbhiH...etc.)?  This Self.  What is that? The inner Self that sees,
hears, thinks, understands, knows, the perceiver of everything, because as
the Self of all It perceives (experiences) everything.  This is the
teaching of all Vedanta texts, the gist of them.  It leads to immortality
and fearlessness.  //

So, The above is the decision in this regard.  All other
shAnkaran/upaniShadic statements elsewhere whether they give out the above
meaning explicitly or not, are subsidiary, subject to, this above statement
of Shankara, for He says that this mantra constitutes the Vedantic
Teaching.  So, Brahman, verily the Atman, is the creator of the universe,
the creation being none other than a projection out of avidyA.
