On the other hand there were any number pf places where he has 
categorically and
unambiguously referred to brahman/Iswara/atma as the cause for creation.

praNAms Sri Chandramouli prabhuji
Hare Krishna

jagat is mere jeeva srushti is not anyway the contribution of neither 
shruti  nor shankara.  Hence sri SSS also in his works clarifies if we 
take the creation and the kAraNa for the creation, it is brahman only 
nothing else.  For that matter shruti & shankara also declaring this 
without any ambiguity when it comes to kAraNa & karya ananyatva in srushti 
prakriya.  In the very second sUtra bhAshya of shankara it has been said 
that :  The sarvajna and sarvashakta cause from which proceeds the 
srushti, stiti and laya of this jagat...the universe which is 
differentiated by name and form, comprehends many katru-s and bhOktru-s 
and is the abode of the fruits of actions regulated by particular places, 
times and causes (the universe) whose creation is NOT EVEN CONCEIVABLE BY 
THE MIND - THAT CAUSE IS BRAHMAN..Do we need any further proof to push 
aside the individual concocted theory that advocates jeeva who has the 
conditioned & limited adjuncts and avidyA is the creator of this klishta & 
gaMbheera jagat. 


Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar

PS :  The point to be noted here is shruti / shankara / gaudapAda  and 
ofcourse Sri SSS too, who religiously follow the shankara siddhAnta say 
this jAgrat prapancha is not better than that of svapna prapancha when it 
comes to jeeva's avasthA traya prakriya.  Which I too deliberated in the 
pUrNamadaH pUrNamidaM thread in other forum.
