There is explicit reply in Shankara's bhashya to 1.4.10 of Br.up. (aham
brahma asmi) that it is Brahman that was ignorant of its true nature and it
is Brahman that acquired the knowledge of its true nature and became free
from all limitations.  This is because the very mantra is so constructed as
to give this natural explanation in the bhashya.

It is this that has led to the traditional statement 'brahmaiva svAvidyayA
samsarati iva, svavidyayA muchyata iva' ['Brahman alone, owing to its own
ignorance appears to be in bondage and owing to kowledge of its true
nature, appears to be liberated.']

Thus, to me there is nothing that is 'evasive' in the bhashyam on this
topic.  In two places in the same bhashyam Shankara gives an explicit reply
to this question.  I have cited both of them with p.nos. in Swami
Brahmananda's translation.
