Verse 230 of Vivekachudamani - 'sadbrahmakaryam...prajalpah ' - is an interesting one. When 'brahman' is the material and efficient cause, are we not strengthening duality when we emphasise on the 'tinyness' of 'jiva' etc.? By doing so are we getting out of 'ignorance' or are we getting deeper into it? Anyways Bhaskarji is still waiting for some pertinent quotes from the 'prasthanatrayi' and Shanakara Bhashyams showing that the world is the creation of the 'tiny jiva'. Hope members who are thorough in the scriptures will help.

Regards

Balagopal

I wrote it only as an introduction to my second para. It was not intended
by me that this itself is open for discussion. Regret the inadvertant
misunderstanding it has led to.
