Agreed. But during this period when
knowledge is not yet aquired, in order to aquire the same ,  is it not
necessary to   deliberate on avidya, its nature, origin, locus. its
undesirable effects ,  etc. 

praNAms Sri ChandramouLi prabhuji
Hare Krishna

Sri subhAnu prabhuji quoted one last sentence in his mail which I'd like 
to quote again :

// quote //

I would submit that the simple solution is to never forget that the 
훮tmavich훮ra of advaita is the enquiry into Brahman, not avidy훮. When in 
doubt, strive to understand Brahman, not avidy훮.

// unquote //

For the sincere sAdhaka, when he realizes that he has avidyA, he would 
start enquiring about his svarUpa that is bereft of this avidyA.  that 
means his investigation is not  aimed towards the 'already' accepted / 
existing avidyA, its locus, cause etc.  but getting rid of that avidyA 
through vidyA..  We should agree that though these queries are relating to 

brahma jignAsa in general, deeper polemics on this issues is due to our 
excessive debating impulse. When we are already seeing the burning house, 
we are not going to waste our time by investigating what is the cause of 
fire, who is behind it, what type of fire it is etc. our whole energy & 
effort would be focussed on dousing the fire and nothing else.  Likewise 
when we realized our true nature of jnAna svarUpa, searching for the cause 

of avidyA is like Sri Vidya prabhuji said, searching the darkness by 
holding the light !! :-))

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
