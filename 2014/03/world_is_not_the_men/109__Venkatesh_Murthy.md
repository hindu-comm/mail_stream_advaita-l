Namaste Sri Bhaskar

There are examples in common life to say even a weak tiny person can create
a very powerful thing.


Men cannot demolish a hill with hands. But if they can use a Bull Dozer
they can demolish a huge hill also. But who has manufactured Bull Dozer? It
is Man. This is an example weak humans can build very very powerful
machines.


Normal man cannot do complicated sums like 197361 multiply with 29839823 in
seconds. But a computer can do it in a fraction of a second. WHo has
manufactured the computer? Man.

Man is weak but his Creations are very very powerful. Man has Created very
powerful nuclear bombs to destroy the whole world.

This is showing the tiny Jeeva called as Sri Bhaskar can be Creator of
whole Universe because you can imagine Maayaa Shakti. Maayaa Shakti can
create Ishwara and the whole Universe. You have become the Indirect Creator
of everything.
