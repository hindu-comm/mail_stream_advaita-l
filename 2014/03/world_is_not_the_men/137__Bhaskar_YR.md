May be Shankara used this analogy  to show that the same analogy, as used 
by the Buddhists before him, does not come to the same conclusion.

For those who read the chAndOgya bhAshya in detail would know the fact 
that first Sri shankara gives the rope-snake example and when the 
pUrvapaxi specifically asked the question : is the world is just like 
bhrAnti like  'snake' on the rope??  shankara starts his clarification 
with a big NO !! and continue to say that jagat in its kAraNa rUpa nothing 
but brahman only and there is nothing that can be called 'asatya'.  shruti 
also saying this same thing at various places, like : idam sarvaM 
yadayamAtmA, brahmaivedam amrutam purasthAt, sarvaM khalvidaM brahma etc.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
