Further to my earlier mail below, I would like to add the following as 
well, which I have just written in Sri Satchidaananda group :

// quote // 

As I have been insisting somany times earlier in my mails to advaitin & 
advaita-L forums, my contention is NOT about the brahmavikAra vAda in the 
form of jagat. I am the last man to do so considering the advaita's 
paramArtha siddhAnta i.e. brahman is nirguNa, niravayava, nirvishesha. So, 
it may kindly be noted that whenever I argue about the creation and for 
the creation brahman is the only nimittOpadAna kAraNa etc. IT IS IN THE 
CONTEXT OF SRUSHTI PRAKRIYA which has been dealt by shruti, shankara to 
refute sAnkhyA's pradhAna etc. kAraNa. So, I would once again like to 
insist that when it comes to creation theory as an event and if at all 
there is a cause behind this creation then that cause is nothing but 
brahman only and this jagat is NOT mere jeeva kalpita. I hope I dont have 
to quote how shankara rejects the view that jeeva can create this klishta 
& gambheera jagat and where shankara clearly talks about Ishwara srushti 
for the sake of jeeva's karma-bhOga. 

In short,  in shankara vedAnta, paramAtma is the jagatkatru and this 
jagatkatru can not be a upAdhi paricchinna jeeva at any stretch of our 
imagination. In this context of jagatkatrutva, paramAtma is far more 
superior to jeeva. He is sarvajna, sarvashakta, nitya shuddha mukta 
whereas jeeva is paricchinna, alpajna...ONLY AkAsha can be seen as 
ghatAkAsha, ghatAkAsha cannot create mahadAkAsha or ghatAkAsha cannot 
claim that mahadAkAsha is mere illusory which I only created :-)) This is 
what I am trying to say in both these forums-s. 

If anybody wants to know what exactly Sri SSS says on these things, they 
can refer Kannada book shAnkara vedAnta sAra and the topic 'brahmavu 
jagattige nimitta kAraNavu Agide' etc.

So,
the creations and withdrawals of the universe have been merely imagined. 
When
you have seen reality as it is, how can the notions of creation etc be 
even
seen as possible? And
so, Suresvara keeps to the true vedantic tradition of stating that 
causality
supposed to produce the world is purely illusory.‚Äù

Thanks for the clarification.  Yes, according to advaita's paramArtha 
stand there is neither creaton nor dissolution, nor any bandha nor any 
mOksha.  kArika clarifies this and hence no disagreements here whatsoever. 

 But when it comes bedha vyavahAra, where jeeva, jagat & Ishwara seem to 
have independent existence from the jeeva's point of view, shuruti does 
not say this world is mere kalpita from the jeeva.  Shruti and shankara by 

insisting the kArya-kAraNa ananyatva say brahman is the abhinna 
nimittOpadAna kAraNa of this jagat, he is not only antaryAmi (substance) 
he is the material (upAdAna) as well.  I dont think Sri SSS has differed 
from this view of shankara and shruti in the context of real event of 
creation and existing world (kArya)  in its kAraNa svarUpa. 

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
