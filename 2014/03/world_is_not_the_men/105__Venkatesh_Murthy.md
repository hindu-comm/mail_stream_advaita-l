Namaste
Kindly give reference from SSS works where he has answered -  who has
Avidyaa? Avidyaa is same as Adhyaasa Or Superimposition. But who has
Adhyaasa? I could not find answer to this.

But there is one statement in Conclusion part of Sankara Vedanta Mimamsa.
'there is superimposition in human behaviour'. If Avidyaa is in human
behaviour and naisargika to human behaviour that Avidyaa is responsible for
Naama Roopa and Maayaa. Because SSS has said Naama Roopa is Avidyaa
Kalpita.

If SSS has said Ishwara is cause for Creation it is direct cause. But
Indirect Cause will be Jeeva because Avidyaa is coming from him. That
Avidyaa Kalpita Maayaa is Creating Ishwara and Jagat also because without
Maayaa there cannot be Ishwara.
