 alongwith me 
 you too seems to be studying vedAnta in an untraditional way
 hence we do 
 not have exposure to the teachings that is restricted to

In spite of the fact the my understanding differs from Subbuji, I have great respect for his knowledge and I have learned a lot from him. I do not agree with your assessment of these disagreements. 

In the final analysis what counts is not eka jiiva or anke jiiva - is whether I have recognized my true identity with the total aham brahmaasmi. I do not think I or Shree Subuuji and you for that matter differ in that - The rest is only to keep the attention of the  intellect to tat tvam asi. 

Hari Om!
