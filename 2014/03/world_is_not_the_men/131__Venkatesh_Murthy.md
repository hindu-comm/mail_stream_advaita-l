Namaste Sri Sadananda

It is true we have to do Brahma Jijnaasaa not Avidyaa Jijnaasaa. But to do
Brahma Jijnaasaa we have to know what is preventing us from knowing Brahma.
Why? Because Brahma is not a new thing to be known. It is already there but
we do not know it. Why? Because there is Avidyaa stopping us from knowing.

You can see why we have to remove Avidyaa. To know Brahman. If you say I
don't care who has Avidyaa there will be a problem. If I have to know
Brahman I have to remove Avidyaa. But if Avidyaa is not my Avidyaa why and
how I have to try to remove it? I have to say Avidyaa is my Avidyaa but not
some other person. Now I can make sincere attempts to remove Avidyaa.

Vaishnavas do not understand this logic. They simply say Advaitis are
Maayaa Vaadis. To know Brahma the only thing required is to remove Avidyaa.
Then already existing Brahma will be known automatically. No extra effort
required.

To know Aeronautical Engineering we have to study books on it. Because
Aeronautical Engineering is new to us. We have to find out. But Brahma is
not like that. Every body knows Brahma to some extent by "I" idea. But he
does not know Brahma fully as He is. Brahma is like cloud covering the Sun.
If you remove the Cloud Automatically Sun will be seen by us. No extra
effort required.
