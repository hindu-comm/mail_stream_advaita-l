Namaste friends,

Ishvara is everywhere in the creation and he is the observer and that also includes his being within us the Jivas as observer. When we the un-elightened Jivas become enlightened by learning to observe inwardly we see our true self as Ishvara, otherwise when we have been looking at the outward world through our senses we find our separate identity as an individual. The Jnani too looks at the world but looks at the world not as an individual but as the Ishvara does. The highest spiritual sadhanas lead us to be the observer as the Ishvara. Even in Science these days, though we talk about the unity of everything though such insights such as the wave-particle (duality) or mass (matter)-energy conversion, many scientists realize that the Schrodinger's wave-function is in an unobserved state and that collapses when observed. This probable is an indication that science does not rule out the observer, whom we call Ishvara.

Just my two cents.

Regards,
Sunil KB

To my knowledge no such statement exists by Sri Swamiji. His precise
position is fully in line with Shankara, Gaudapada and Suresvara. I have provided in the Satchidanandendra list the relevant sanskrit sections of Vedanta Prakriyā Pratyabhijñā with translation and vārtikā references for those interested.
