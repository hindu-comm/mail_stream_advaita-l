Bhaskarji - I hope confusion is resolved, since any creative power of the world of plurality rests with that locus of that power whom we call as Iswara. jiiva-jagat-Iswara traid is there both in the waking state and dream state. 
Anyway I was bringing out the parallelism for both to show that it is not tiny jiiva that create the world of plurality and then cognizes it either in the dream or in the waking state.
I rest here.
Hari Om!

 \ Month end, qtr. end. work hence at office today. I
 think the confusion is 
 due to saying svapna srushti is from Ishwara (jeeva).
 It is confusing 
 because nowhere shankara equates jeeva with Ishwara in the
 srushti 
 prakriya and say jeeva is the Ishwara (srushtikarta) of the
 dream world
