So,
the creations and withdrawals of the universe have been merely imagined. 
When
you have seen reality as it is, how can the notions of creation etc be 
even
seen as possible? And
so, Suresvara keeps to the true vedantic tradition of stating that 
causality
supposed to produce the world is purely illusory.‚Äù

Thanks for the clarification.  Yes, according to advaita's paramArtha 
stand there is neither creaton nor dissolution, nor any bandha nor any 
mOksha.  kArika clarifies this and hence no disagreements here whatsoever. 
 But when it comes bedha vyavahAra, where jeeva, jagat & Ishwara seem to 
have independent existence from the jeeva's point of view, shuruti does 
not say this world is mere kalpita from the jeeva.  Shruti and shankara by 
insisting the kArya-kAraNa ananyatva say brahman is the abhinna 
nimittOpadAna kAraNa of this jagat, he is not only antaryAmi (substance) 
he is the material (upAdAna) as well.  I dont think Sri SSS has differed 
from this view of shankara and shruti in the context of real event of 
creation and existing world (kArya)  in its kAraNa svarUpa. 

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
