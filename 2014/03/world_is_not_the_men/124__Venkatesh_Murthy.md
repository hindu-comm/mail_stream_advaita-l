Kindly examine the question. The words 'world', 'mental creation' and 'tiny
soul' are because of Avidyaa only. In Paramaartha there is no world, there
is no mental creation and there is no tiny soul also. What you are saying
tiny soul is the great Brahma. Jeevo Brahmaiva Naaparaha.

This tiny Jeeva does not know he is great Brahma because of Avidyaa. But he
is the Creator of the World. He does not know that because of Avidyaa. The
example given in Dakshinamurthy Stotra is this. In a dream Jeeva thinks the
dream objects are outside him and different from him. He thinks the dream
objects have Independent Reality from him. But the Reality is he has
created dream objects and they are ALL Inside Him, not outside. Like this
in Waking also Jeeva has created All objects and he is interacting with
them thinking they are Outside. But they are all inside Him. They are in
his Mental Creation. He is the Creator.

There are no other tiny soul. There is only one Jeeva and he is the
Inquirer.

Other tiny souls are Mental Creations of one Jeeva only. All Transactions
with the Creator Jeeva are happening in His Mental Creation of World only
Just like in the dream the Jeeva will transact with other Jeevas. If you
dream you gave me Rs 1000 in your dream you will expect it back in your
dream. I will give it back to you in the dream. The Transacation is
completed in the dream only. But I was not actually there in your dream. I
did not actually take Rs 1000 from you.

 Aneka Jeeva Vaada is for less intelligent people.

This is Aneka Jeeva Vaada. But in Eka Jeeva Vaada he has created Ishwara
also.

One test for Jeeva's Creation of Ishwara is like this. When you are awake
you will say Ishwara is controlling everything. In dream also you will obey
Ishwara's rules. But in dreamless sleep there is no World and No Ishwara.
If Ishwara and his rules are not Created by you they should be there in
Sushupti. But they are not there. This is proving you have Created Ishwara
in Waking and Dream.
