Dear Sada ji,

In the BSB 3.5.17 itself Shankara cites the mahAbhArata/viShNupurANam verse:

In the Mahabharata itself the Lord Himself denies reality to those forms
and that they should not be taken to be His nature/guNa and kriyA:

माया ह्येषा मया सृष्टा यन्मां पश्यसि नारद ।
सर्वभूतगुणैर्युक्तं नैवं मां ज्ञातुमर्हसि  ||

After showing His vishvarUpa darshana to Narada, the Lord says: Narada, what
you see Me here is My illusory projection.  Do not know Me as endowed with
all these attributes.

Also, the Br.upanishad 'indro mAyAbhiH pururUpa Iyate..' bhAShya says that
Brahman takes various forms owing to avidyA cognitions.

So, there is no way one can show that the shruti-based creation method
contradicts the pauruSheya quotes.

The most significant verse of the Advaita Makaranda that depicts the
'cognition is creation' prakriyA is:

1. Advaita Makaranda:
>
> mayyevodeti chidvyomni jagadgandharva pattanam
> ato'ham na katham brahma sarvajnam sarvakAraNam
>
> In Me, the Space of Consciousness, alone does the whole world - like the
castle-in-the-air - arise.How am I, therefore, not Brahman, the All-knower
and the Cause of all?
>
> 2. Kaivalyopanishad:
>
> mayyeva sakalam jaatam - This entire creation is born of ME, The Pure
Infinite Consciousness alone
> mayi sarvam pratishthitam - This entire creation and everything in it,
have their being in ME, The Pure Infinite Consciousness, I am
> mayi sarvam layam yaati - This entire creation and everything in it
ultimately resolve into ME, The Pure Infinite Consciousness that I am
> tad advayam brahma aham asmi - I am That Brahman which is The ONE without
a second, ONE which is all-inclusive, all-pervasive. I am Brahma, Vishnu,
and Siva all in ONE.

And the manIShA panchakam verse:

brahmaivAham idam jagacca sakalam chinmAtravistAritam
sarvam chaitadavidyayA triguNayA asheSham mayA kalpitam

[I am indeed Brahman, this entire jagat is a projection of and in the Pure
Consciousness.  All this universe is concocted by Me through avidyA
constituted by the three guNa-s.]


Even in the Shruti-taught creation  specified by you, Shankara takes it as
an illusion using the rope-snake analogy:

In the Chandogya 6.2.3 bhAShya, the Acharya brings out the purport of
Brahman creating the universe, otherwise called 'becoming many':

//How did That (Sat/Brahman, the Cause) visualize? This is being answered:
'syAm = I shall become; bahu = many. PrajAyeya = 'I shall be born
excellently' like earth taking shapes of pots etc.or ropes etc. taking the
shapes of snake, etc. imagined by the intellect (buddhiparikalpitena).//


If you think the Shruti-taught creation is distinct from the bhAgavata and
other verses (pauruSheya), pl. note that Shankara differs:  He uses the
rope-snake analogy for a sRShTi that is supposed to emerge from Sarvajna
Ishwara for the sake of all jiva-s as per their karma.   Really Shankara
should not be using the rope-snake analogy at all here.  Moreover, to make
things worse, He says: buddhiparikalpitena.  Why should Shankara say 'the
creation of Sarvajna Ishwara/Brahman is akin to an imagination / delusion
akin to perceiving a rope-snake if it was a 'real' sRShTi as opposed to a
'cognition is creation' of an individual according to Him?
