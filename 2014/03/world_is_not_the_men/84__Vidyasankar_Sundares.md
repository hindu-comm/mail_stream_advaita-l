But, consider this. When you see pots and jugs as clay, do you see clay only,
or do you also see clay in the form of pot, clay in the form of jug, etc? If the
latter, then you are lending some measure of reality to the vikAra, what is
only vAcArambhaNa nAmadheya. In other words, is it possible to have a
perception of jugs and pots after the real nature as clay is known? 

Yet, just like in the rope-snake analogy, ignorance of the real nature of brahman
(as avikArI) is what gives rise to the jagat perception, full of vikAra, in the first
place. kasyeyam avidyA?

If you say that the jnAnI sees the avikArI brahman even when s/he sees the
jagat that is full of vikAra, you will eventually devolve to the avidyA-leSa or
vAsanA or saMskAra mode of explanation.

If you say that the jnAnI does not see the vikAra of jagat at all, and sees only
brahman, niravayava, nirviSesha, nirguNa, nirvikAra, then you will veer to the
jnAna happens in nirvikalpa samAdhi mode of explanation.

Neither of these is acceptable to the paksha that insists that avidyA is purely
subjective, pertaining to the jIva only, not brahman, and is purely an absence.

Meanwhile, jIvo brahmaiva ...

Best regards,
Vidyasankar
