Dear Sri Subhanu ji,

>From the above words 'ajnAtAtmaiva kAraNam..' it is clear the samAsa is 'na
jnAtaH iti ajnAtaH' and 'ajnAtaH AtmA yena sa ajnAtAtmA' ['Atman not known
by that entity is called atnAtAtmaa']  In this case, a bahuvrIhi compound,
the entity who has this ignorance is referred to as the cause of creation.
 If a different compound, karmadhAraya, is adopted then the vigraha vAkyam
will be: ajnAtaH cha asua AtmA cha iti ajnAtAtmA.  Here, the unknownness is
an adjective, visheShaNa, to the AtmA, visheShya.  Then, this ajnAtAtmA,
 will be the upAdAnakAraNam for the creation that the Swami accepts.

If it is the latter, then who is the creator? If Brahman is admitted to be
the creator, then does this ajnAtAtmA become the material with which
Brahman creates? I would like scholars to comment on the samAsa shown above
and offer other possibilities too to make the understanding firm.

It is nice to see Sri SSS admitting that the world is merely imagined like
the snake in the rope.... vikalpamAtram, just as Shankara states in the
Ch.up. bhashya 6.2.3 buddhiparikalpitena...So, Sri SSS says, acc. to
Shankara, the causehood of Brahman is mere being the substrate,
adhiShThaanam, for the superimposition/imaginations.  That means, acc. to
him, Brahman is neither the nimitta nor the upaadAna kAaNam for the world,
and the world is a mere imagination.  The moot question is: imagination
by/of whom?  Has he answered this anywhere?  And it would be wrong to say
that acc to Sri SSS , Brahman is the abhinnanimittopAdAna kAraNam for the
universe.

In fact this explanation fits well with the verse I cited as quoted by
Madhusudana Saraswati in BG 9.10 (and by NilakanTha in BG 2.28) :

अस्य द्वैतेन्द्रजालस्य यदुपादानकारणम् ।
अज्ञानं तदुपाश्रित्य ब्रह्म कारणमुच्यते ॥ इति ।

That is ok, Sri Subhanu ji, the point of this discussion is: for whom is
this apprehension, to the jiva or to brahman? For, it is natural to hold,
for whomever the pratIti happens, he is the one that imagines it.  That is
what is seen in analogies like rope-snake.  We have to  perforce conclude
that 'in the substratum that is Brahman, the world is perceived (by an
individual)'  This is what creation is as per Sri SSS.  This is because Sri
SSS has said that Brahman's causehood is nothing but brahman being the
substrate of imagination.  This is quite acceptable to me as this is what I
have been articulating.  And as per Shankara's bhashya on 1.4.10 of the
Br.up. there is no sentient entity other than Brahman which can be admitted
to harbor the avidyA (characterized by abrahmatvam and asarvatvam).  This
waters down to saying: the avidyAvAn Brahman (which is what the jiva is) is
imagining the world in the substrate that is Itself.

Thanks and warm regards
