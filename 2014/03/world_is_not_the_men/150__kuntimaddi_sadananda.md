PraNAms - There is a typo in the statement. 
 Mondukya kaarika in vaitatya prakaranam - shows that reality is not established by a. peceptability, utility, experiencability or unchangability or non-negatability.

It should say after experiencability, but by unchangability or non-negatability or nithyavam.
There may be other typos too but the above is more crucial. 
Hari Om!
