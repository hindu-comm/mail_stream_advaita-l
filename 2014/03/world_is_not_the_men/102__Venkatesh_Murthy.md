Both sides in this argument have accepted Maayaa is responsible for
Creation. But Sri SSS has also said Maayaa is Avidyaa Kalpitaa. Other
Paryaaya Padas are Avidyaa Pratyupasthaapitaa and Avidyaakrutaa. In Sankara
Vedanta Mimamsa page 79 SSS has said for Sutra Bhashya 1 - 4 - 3 'Atra
Maayaa Shabdena Nirdishtaa Avidyaa Prtayupasthaapitaa Jagataha
Praagavasthaa'.

Most important SSS has accepted Maayaa, Shakti and Prakruti are
Avidyaakalpita only. Sutra Bhashya 2 -1 - 14 was also referred by Swami
Advayananda Saraswati explaining this when I met him. Sarvajnasya
Ishwarasya Atmabhute Iva Avidyaakalpite Naama Roope Tattvaanyattvaabhyaam
Anirvachaneeye Samsaara Prapancheebhute Sarvajnasya Ishwarasya Maayaa
Shaktihi Prakrutihi

Name and Form Naama Roopa is imagined because of Avidyaa. Name and Form is
same as Maayaa, Shakti and Prakruti. The Creation has happened because of
the Prakruti. In the above statement Sarvajna Ishwara is not Aidyaa Kalpita
Ishwara but Brahman only. That Avidyaa is the subjective misunderstanding
of Jeeva. It is Adhyaasa in the Adhyaasa Bhashya. We can now say Jeeva's
Avidyaa has produced Maayaa or Prakruti. From Maayaa the Creation has
happened. Maayaa is Direct Creator. Jeeva is Indirect Creator.

Brahman is Sarvajna because he knows all as Brahman. He does not know
particular details of anything.
