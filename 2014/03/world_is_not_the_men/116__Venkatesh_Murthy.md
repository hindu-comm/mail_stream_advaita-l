Namaste

Where has Sri SSS given definition what is Jeeva? What does he say about
Jeeva? What does he say about who has Avidyaa? Because Maayaa Or Naama
Roopa is imagined by Avidyaa. That Maayaa is responsible for Creation.

In the Method of Vedanta there is a criticism of Mandana Mishra's Advaita.
Mandana was the first to say Avidyaa is in Jeeva. In SSS system the Avidyaa
is a subjective misunderstanding of Atma. This cannot be in Atma but in
Jeeva.  SSS has to agree with Mandana.

Jeeva with Avidyaa ---> Imagines Maayaa, Naama Roopa ---> Ishwara and Jagat.

To get Moksha Jeeva has to do the reverse process. He has to know Ishwara
and Jagat are because of Maayaa and Maayaa is there because of his own
Avidyaa.
