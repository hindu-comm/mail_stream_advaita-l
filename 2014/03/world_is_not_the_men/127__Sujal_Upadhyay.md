The best answer is - ignorance belongs to the one who does not know that he

jiiva-jagat-Iswara triad to aatma-anaatma diad with anaatma as adhyaaropa
on adhiShTaanam aatma, the self which is now understood as Brahman.

2. When we use the word tiny - automatically we have given a realty to the
jiiva and tiny jiiva cannot create the entire universe with the rest of the
beings (jiivas in it)..
