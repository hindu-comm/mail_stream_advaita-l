praNAms Sri Balagopal prabhuji
Hare Krishna

Verse 230 of Vivekachudamani - 'sadbrahmakaryam...prajalpah ' - is an 
interesting one. When 'brahman' is the material and efficient cause, are 
we not strengthening duality when we emphasise on the 'tinyness' of 'jiva' 
etc.? 

>  No, OTOH, brahman's abhinna nimittOpadAnaKAraNa upholds the vedAntic 
declaration that brahman is ekamevAdviteeya and he does not require any 
external force to become both efficient & material cause of this jagat. 
And the jeeva cannot do this 'vyAkaraNa' on its own, it can only stay in 
created jagat to experience its karma phala. 


By doing so are we getting out of 'ignorance' or are we getting deeper 
into it? 

>  it is part of veAnta jignAsa prabhuji..hence we have 555 sUtra-s and 
bhAshya...it is not all about 4 mahAvAkya-s though ultimately realization 
of 'ekatva' behind all these 'nAnAtva'.

Anyways Bhaskarji is still waiting for some pertinent quotes from the 
'prasthanatrayi' and Shanakara Bhashyams showing that the world is  the 
creation of the 'tiny jiva'. Hope members who are thorough in the 
scriptures will help.

>  even if someone quotes out of context about jeeva's creation of jagat 
from mAndUkya, kArika bhAshya etc. the fact remains intact that when it 
comes to creation context (srushti prakriya) brahman is the ONLY cause and 
this tiny soul would not come into picture at all. Shankara is quite clear 
in saying this :  yat sarvajnaM sarva shakti brahma nitya shuddha buddha 
mukta svabhAvaM shAreerAt adhikaM anyat tat vayaM jagataH srashtru 
brUmaH,,,,shAreerastu anevaM vidhaH.  For the shankara siddhAnta follower, 
there is no more evidence required from prasthAna traya bhAshya (though 
there are plenty) to realize that brahman is the ekamevAdviteeya kAraNa 
for this jagat.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
