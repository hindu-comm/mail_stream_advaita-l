Namaste
I think you are not considering Sri SSS statement Maayaa is Avidyaa
kalpitaa. This Avidyaa Kalpita Maayaa is responsible for all creation mess.
If you say Ishwara he is also because of Maayaa Upaadhi. The logical proof
of Jeeva Kalpita Srishti in SSS language is like this.

Who is creator? It is Maayaa. What is Maayaa? It is imagined by Avidyaa.
Who has Avidyaa? It cannot be Brahman. It is Jeeva. Jeeva has Avidyaa and
because of Avidyaa he is imagining Maayaa and this Maayaa is creating
everything. You can say Jeeva cannot create everything directly but he is
creating indirectly the whole Universe including Ishwara through Maayaa
only.
