Namaste Sir Sadananda

This very important Sloka is appearing in Maanasollaasa by Sureshwara
स्वप्ने स्वान्तगतं विश्वं यथा पृथगवेक्षते ।
तथैव जाग्रत्कालेऽपि प्रपञ्चोऽयं विव्च्यताम् ॥

It is saying like the dream objects in the dream are appearing outside but
there are all inside you but not outside. Similarly in waking also the
objects are appearing outside but actually they are inside you only. There
is no difference between dream and waking.

If you read Maanasollaasa you will immediately understand the Jeeva is
creating everything in both dream and waking.

You believe you are creating dream objects and they are inside you but they
appear outside.  You have to believe you are creating waking objects also.
The waking objects are also in you but you think they are outside.
