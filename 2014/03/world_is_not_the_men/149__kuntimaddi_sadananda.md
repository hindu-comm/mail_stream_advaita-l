Shree Venkatesh Murthy - PraNAms - Sorry if my reply is confusion. My be this will help.

The waker's mind with its suppressions and oppressions become a platform for the projection of the whole dream world. Hence when you says YOU -  if it refers to the waker's mind then the whole projection is within that mind. In analogy with the waking world, these impressions form maaya and waker's mind enlivened by the consciousness is the Iswara of the creation. Hence similar to the waking world Iswara with maaya Shakti is creating the dream world. The dream world consists of many beings and non beings. The beings have their own BMI. Anupravesha statement applies here also. Iswara as though after creating the world with BMIs enters into beings as jiiva. There is dreamer subject I who is a tiny soul in the dream, looking at the world not created by that tiny BMI.  The dream world  involves forest and tigers including the one that is chasing him for its meals. Now, when you shift your attention to the dream and say YOU are running from the tiger we are
 now talking about the dream creation done by the gobal mind (waker's mind) while perception and cognition happening at the local mind and its sense level  and running is done by the karmendriyas of that tiny jiiva - which are different from the waker senses and  his mind which has become a platform for the whole dream creation. You are the waker and you are the dreamer - there is a shift in the reference you. The waker you is comfortably sleeping a dark AC room while the dream you is running away in the forest in a bright day light not aware that the other you that is sleeping with no problem. Mondukya kaarika in vaitatya prakaranam - shows that reality is not established by a. peceptability, utility, experiencability or unchangability or non-negatability.  The wakers mind is gobal and dreamer mind is local. The creation is at global level and perception of the creation and the resulting transaction is at local BMI level. As long as the reference states
 are clear, there should not be confusion. If one says there dreamer you created the tiger and make it to chase him is not right. Creation of the dream subject and the tiger and the forest where he is running is done by the global mind which is mind of the waker that is sleeping. 

In essence waker - You is the global and dreamer you is tiny local. the BMI and the senses for each are different - hence Manduka provides a parallel statement defining the two  -each with 19 gateways to perceive their respective external worlds. 

Hope this helps.

Hari Om!
Sadananda

 Namaste Sri Sadananda

 I am confused by your reply. If you say dream world of tiny
 Jeeva is that
 tiny Jeeva's Srishti but waking world is Ishwara's Srishti
 there is no
 logic for supporting this. Many of our Acharyas like
 Gaudapada have treated
 dream and waking as name.
