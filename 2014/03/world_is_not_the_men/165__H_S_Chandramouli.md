Namaste, nobody is saying that adhyāsa is some
external element unconnected with the inquirer. This is not Sri Swamiji's
position
and I can see that from your paragraph above,you have not correctly grasped
Sri Swamiji's views.>>

Sorry. I did not say they were Swamiji's views. I was responding to Sri
Subhanu's observation << Such questions where the answers are valueless
are:-       What is the nature of avidyā? Is it positive or negative?-
  Whose is avidyā?-       What causes my confusion? >>. That is all.

Regards
