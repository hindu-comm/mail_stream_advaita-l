Dear Sri Sada ji,

The above highlighted part is not in accordance with the Br.up. 'There (in
the dream) are no chariots, no horses, no paths, etc.. He creates the
chariots, the horses, paths, etc.'  Shankaracharya comments that this
creation of/in the dream is by  the jiva. In the BSB 3.2.5 Shankara refutes
the position that 'the creator (of dream) is the Supreme Conscious Self
(Ishwara)'. [see p.593 bottom of the English trans. of Sw.Gambhirananda.)
Shankara cites a few upanishadic passages to show that the dream is the
creation of the individual self, jiva.  In fact even in the mandukya karika
verse 'abhAvashcha rathAdInAm....' it is the above Br.up. that is alluded
to show that the dream objects, in their entirety, are the jiva's creation.
That the dream is (also) a creation of Ishwara and therefore real, is the
theory of the non-advaitins.   In fact the dream analogy is taken up only
to show that the waking world too is the creation of the jiva alone.  That
is the central message of the entire upanishadic lore and the kArikaa-s in
particular.

In fact it is only to remove this misconception the Upanishad is talking
about the dream creation by the jiva.

Ishwara and not by the jiva?  If you are equating the waker-mind (which you
call 'global mind') to Ishwara, then you are indeed accepting that one
jIva, eka jiva, is the creator of the entire dRShya prapancha of that one
jiva!!!  And the word 'jiva' in the eka-jiva prakriyA is never intended to
be a 'tiny' jiva.  This is the mistake that lies at the base of
misunderstanding and objecting to the eka-jiva prakriyA.  The jiva of the
eka-jiva is just a conscious entity, defined as the only ’sajiva jiva' and
all the other jiva-semblances this one sajiva jiva perceives/cognizes are
'nirjiva jiva-s, like dream jiva-s'.  This only conscious sajiva jiva is
admitted to be the creator/projector of even the concepts like veda,
Ishwara, etc. In other words, the world that any jiva sees, is taken
as-it-is and transferred to the eka jiva as his own creation.  If these
fundamentals of the eka-jiva prakriya are understood, there will be no
objections to it.  In fact Sri SSS is the greatest champion of this
construct as is evidenced from the various quotes provided from his work/s
by Sri Subhanu ji.

I end my contribution to this thread with this final, though repeated,
clarification.
