Dear Sri Vidyashankarji,

Reg  << If you accept that avidyA is a seed material entity responsible for
a distinction
between brahman and jIva, you still have to address whether this avidyA
belongs
to brahman or to jIva. If your answer begins with a distinction between the
great
brahman and the tiny jIva, that will be advaita-hAni as well. >>.

The shruti  says << tadhetam tarhi avyakrutamaaseet >> . Here avyakrita
includes both atma and anatma. anatma in seed form. It is only proper to
consider that avidya is " resident " in brahman/atman. This does not in any
way lead to advaita hani because avyakruta is not of the same level of
reality.It can also vanish when we consider nirguna brahman who is then
without even this seed avidya. That is also the reason why it is called
anirvachaniya, it has to be inferred by the karya only ( of Creation etc ).
In his Panchadashi Sri Vidyaranya Swami while elaborating on the concept of
Maya says as much.

I am really surprised at the various posts in this thread as well as in
another thread that jiva also could be considered as cause for creation  by
adducing the reason that he is none other than brahman << jivo brahmaiva na
parah >>. Does it also follow that the statement << brahmo jivaiva na parah
>> is also valid. Pardon me for being crude but I think it is the briefest
way to establishing the inadmissibility of such a reasoning. Kindly do not
misunderstand my stand. If you consider it offensive, my apologies in
advance.

Regards
