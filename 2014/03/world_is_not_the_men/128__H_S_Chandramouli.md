Dear Sri Kuntimaddiji,

Reg << Hence the best way is we do have jiiva-jagat-Iswara as long as jiiva
notion is there. and with knowledge we shift to aatma-anaatma diad and the
whole question of ignorance get sublimated. The creation becomes vibhuti of
the aatma. >>

You have mentioned " with knowledge " . Agreed. But during this period when
knowledge is not yet aquired, in order to aquire the same ,  is it not
necessary to   deliberate on avidya, its nature, origin, locus. its
undesirable effects ,  etc. Absolutely agreed, since we are mired in avidya
itself, it is not possible to understand it fully. I am not saying it is
possible. But unless there is a desire to get out of it, it is clearly not
possible to undertake any sadhnas for transcending it. It is only for this
that vichara on avidya is essential. I do feel this is not overemphasizing
the issue. In fact I think in our anxiety to move forward quickly to the
final Goal, we are perhaps underemphasizing the preliminary steps so
essential for undertaking the further steps.

Regards
