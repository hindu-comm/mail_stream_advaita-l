praNAms Sri Subbu prabhuji
Hare Krishna

In spite of the fact the my understanding differs from Subbuji, I have 
great respect for his knowledge and I have learned a lot from him. 

>  even me too prabhuji...despite having disagreements with him on somany 
issues, I have great respect for him.  I am the great admirer of his life 
style more than anything else prabhuji.

I do not agree with your assessment of these disagreements. 

>  Kindly dont think my assessment of your disagreement with him is aimed 
towards damaging relationship between you and him.  I was making that 
comment based on Sri Subbu prabhuji's comment on your mail : 

// quote //

I can understand that those who are not exposed to the traditional study
of the Vedanta are not familiar of the eka jiva construct which is by
default the method of the prasthanatraya bhashya-s.  Let's  agree to
disagree on this matter.

>  which implies to me (atleast) that whatever you (others) wrote with 
regard to creation is not from the pen of vedAntin who has traditional 
teaching with regard to advaita vedAnta in general and eka-jeeva vAda in 
particular.  If it is mere misunderstanding of some concepts within the 
tradition, Sri Subbuji would have not brought in the issue of 'traditional 
teaching'.  Anyway, it would be kind if you could share with us what you 
understand from Sri subbu prabhuji's assessment and conclusion on your 
mail.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
