​I hope you are not like the poster of this post :
http://www.advaita-vedanta.org/archives/advaita-l/2011-September/029036.html

But, if you are, our reply is like this to such stereotype posts:

And, if you are not, then see these suggestions :​

Doesn't Gaudapada and Sankara thoroughly establish ajativada tradition in

​Yes, they established. But, what do you mean by ajAtavAda ? Don't you
accept that even those who accept ajAtavAda have to explain vyavahAra ? If
no, then I hope you will get a better teacher in future by grace of your
puNya. If yes, then this is what the thread and the whole forum is doing.

​To understand that part, you again need help of others. The apparent
meaning which you are suggesting shows that you failed to grasp actual
meaning.
I hope some kind member will help you.
Why not me ?
Because, I'm not writing to explain to you. I got just irritated by such
stereotypical post which are posted by 'brahmaGYAnI-s' and 'ajAtavAdin-s'
now and then on this forum or that.

​It has a purpose and to understand that you need a teacher and ability to
think critically.
Teacher may be some other person. But, let me show that you are not
considering other works of sha~NkarAchArya where he extensively delves on
world and it's constituents, as pa~nchIkaraNam. So, just holding a
particular instance of writings of a particular portions while neglecting a
vast amount of his writing - is the error on your part.
