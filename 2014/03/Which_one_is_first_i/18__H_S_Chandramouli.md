That is my question. The two terms mayavishishta and mayopadhika are both
used to address Iswara. My doubt is how can the same Iswara have maya as
his upadhi as well as be endowed with it ? After all Iswara is Chaitanya +
maya. Upadhi cannot be part of the vastu itself. Nirvishesha brahman by
itself and nirvishesha brahman with maya as upadhi is the equivalent of
mahakasha and ghatakasha drshtanta. Is it not ? nirvishesha brahman with
maya as visheshana is Iswara.
