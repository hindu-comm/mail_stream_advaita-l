Namaste,

...........
Time also is God's creation. Time is not there before creation. We cannot
ask a question regarding time sequence of creation. It may not have any
meaning.

Time (kAla) is very abstract concept in shruti to define.  

It is measured in terms of "packets of energy" in the form of "agni"
emanated from sUrya-maNDala.

The amt. of packets of energy received in one year is called 
"samvatsara-agni".  A total of 720 packets of energy 
is received which is split into two having 360 each. 
The set of 360 packets of agni is the total "ahas" 
ie., days of year and another set of 360 packets of
agni is the total "ratri" ie., nights of year. Both are
called "ahOrAtrah".

This "samvatasara-agni" is classified into 5 categories.

1) ahOrAtra swarupa
2) mAsa swarupa
3) ritu swarupa
4) ayana swarupa
5) pUrNa swarupa

These 5 aspects of "samvatsara-agni" has to be re-aligned with 
the "vaishwanara-agni" of yajamAni.  And hence, 4 types of
yajnAs are prescribed.

1) EkAha 
2) dashAha
3) rAtri-satra
4) ayana-satra

The yajamAni with the performance of the above 4 yAgAs, performs the "samskAra" to the
agni called "samvatasara-agni".   To get the adhikAra for performing this samskAra, 
he has to perform the following:

1) agnihOtra
2) darshapUrNamAsa
3) chAturmAsya
4) pashubandha

Thus with the performance of agnihOtra, the yajamAni performs the samskAra to
ahOrAtra agni; with darshapUrNamAsa, the yajamAni performs the samskAra to mAsa agni 
of samvatsara; with the performance of chAturmAsya, the yajamAni performs the samskAra
to ritu agni; with the performance of pashubandha, the yajamAni performs the samskAra to
ayana swarupa agni of samvatsara.

Thus, the culimation of samskAra takes place with the performance of "sOmayAga". 
With the performance of sOmayAga, the yajamAni performs the samskAra of
"pUrNa" swarupa of "samvatsara agni".

With the performance of sOmayAga, the yajamAni performs the "pravilApana" of the
vaishwAnara agni (which is present in him) with "samvatasara-agni" of sUrya-maNDala.
With the achievement of this pravilApana-prakriya of aligning his vaishwAnara agni
with samvatasara agni, the yajamAni, after shedding of mortal coil, pierces the
sUrya-maNDala with his yajna-anuSTAna balam.

So, kAla-chakra has to be understood properly which is a very abstract one.

In srividya, there is a prakriya taught to easily achieve this siddhi.

regs,
sriram
