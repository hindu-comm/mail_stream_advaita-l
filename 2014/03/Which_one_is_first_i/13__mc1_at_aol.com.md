Om Namaste Advaita_l devotees,
Please forgive but I'm a bit surprised by this thread. Doesn't Gaudapada and Sankara thoroughly establish ajativada tradition in the Mandukya Karika? For instance, introducing MaKBh 3.23, the purvapaksa suggests that "The sruti     that speaks of creation cannot be accepted as a valid proof by one who holds that the Self is not born."  Sankara responds that the purpose of the sruti is the oneness of Brahman and not creation as that is secondary .... and further that, "creation in any other use (than Maya or Illusion) is not accepted and it serves no purpose."
are we then discussing in the current thread, that which has no purpose?

 In the Bhagavad Gita The Lord says that He is
 Time.Kalosmi........So there is no question of creation of
 time.It is anadhi.R.Krishnamoorthy.

 Krishnamoorthy - PraNAms  - In the 10th Ch. of Geeta in describing some of his 
many vibhuti's He says I am many things - including I am dhananjaya. Creation 
involves He becoming many - Otherwise there is no creation. Hence when he says I 
am kaala it is not mean that kaala was not created. Any cause-effect relation 
provides the kaala. since cause supersedes the effect. 

Hari Om!
