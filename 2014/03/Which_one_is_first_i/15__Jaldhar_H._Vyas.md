Yes.  That ajativada is most clearly expressed in the Mandukyopanishad 
which is why Muktikopanishad says that the study of that alone is 
sufficient.  But then it goes on to name 107 (including itself) more 
upanishads.  Why?  Because there is a need for them.

That has no *ultimate* purpose.  But only a few can grasp that 
immediately.  In particular, Shankaracharya observes that Arjuna was a 
madhyama adhikari (mid-level qualified) for jnana.  It is for them that 
shruti and smrti describe creation, maintainence, and regeneration of the 
universe.  In my response to the original post I gave some reasons why 
Krshna Bhagavan might want to present Himself to Arjuna as within time.

Come now, your response is a little over the top don't you think? This is 
a legitimate question.
