Nithin bhai,

I knew about this quote and chapter 38-40 of saura pUrANa attack
mAdvAcArya. srI Subramanium ji has also provided some more reference from
parASara samhitA and other texts.

But I do not wish to hit them back.

Most of us do not have much info. All I wanted is that, if I, a laymen,
with little effort can refute their accusations, then anybody can.

Things are not what they are projected. The concept of mAyA as mithyA is
over blown and taken out-of-context. In dvaita-advaita debates, often last
state is debated, whereas very little is said about how one can progress in
spirituality.


OM

"To disconnect from the self and to become Aware of anything else is
nothing but unhappiness" - Bhagawan Ramana Maharshi

He who has faith has all
He who lacks faith, lacks all
It is the faith int he name of lord that works wonders
FAITH IS LIFE, DOUBT IS DEATH - Sri Ramakrishna
