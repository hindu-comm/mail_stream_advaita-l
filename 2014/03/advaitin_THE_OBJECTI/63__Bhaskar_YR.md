Further, I think by saying jagat is nothing better than a phatom of mind 
(BTW is it individual's mind's illusion??) , we are denying chetana 
kAraNatva to jagat, abhinna nimittOpadANa kAraNatva to brahman and will 
have to discount the somany shruti-s (like taitereeya, Itareya, mundaka, 
chAndOgya almost 10 principal upanishats) vedAnta sUtra-s, kArika-s mAyA 
satkAryavAda etc.  which invariably talks about brahma kAraNatva (Atma 
jagatkAraNatva) since we are arguing that there is jagat due to illusion 
of the mind !! ?? 

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
