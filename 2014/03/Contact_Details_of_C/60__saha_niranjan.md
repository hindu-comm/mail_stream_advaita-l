Dear List Members,

Pranams (forgive me for cross posting)!

Could
 anyone provide me with the contact details (official website etc.) of 
Saradpeetha, Dwaraka and Jyotirpeetha, Badrinath, as I would like to 
have some important publications from there, if they have (while Sringeri, 
Govardhan, Kanchi peethas have their official website and I did not find
 much valuable publications in Kanchi peetha).

With best rgs,
Niranjan Saha
