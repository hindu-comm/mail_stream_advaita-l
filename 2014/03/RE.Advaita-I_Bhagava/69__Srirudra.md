I think that blaming the senses that they are superimposing the attributes on their objects is not correct.The senses simply play the role of passing on the information and the brain-read mind-only interprets depending on the vasanas of the individual soul.All humans see the objects identically.Otherwise there is no question of understanding.What happens is the interpretation of what is experienced which is subjective.Rose is rose only for every one.But some May like its smell more,feel the petals's softness more etc.Again here sense organs simply transmit the observations but the mind only expresses its likes / dislikes etc.Sense organs are just conveyors only.R.Krishnamoorthy.
