Once you said you have a wife. Do you have a girl friend also? Is she
beautiful? Your wife knows about her? Just a joke. Relax.
I think Vijnana Vadi Bauddhas will say everything is in the mind and False
but they will not say the Seer Atma is True. That Seer is imagining the
whole world but he is imagining it in His mind. That Mind is not True but
He is True. Bauddhas will simply say everything is in the mind only. This
Adi Sankara has attacked in Sutra Bhashya.
