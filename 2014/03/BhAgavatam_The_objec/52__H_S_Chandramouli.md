*The student of vedAnta is supposed to be: medhAvI puruSho vidwAn

Let us be reasonable. Are we all , who are discussing vedanta in this forum
, sadhanachatushtaya sampannas , as the above quote from by you from
vivekachudamani requires the student of vedanta to be ?? It is perhaps not
too far from truth that none of us in this forum qualify under this clause
to be students of vedanta. Still we are discussing it. Is it not. The
requirement of sadhanachatushtaya is for a sudent of vedanta who is
considered to be in an advanced stage of sadhana. It does not apply to us
who would like to know what vedanta is all about in the hope that some time
or other we also would become sadhakas in the above sense. My obseravations
pertain to only such mundane students who form a majority who need not be
unnecessarily be confused when it could easily be avoided. I am not
contesting anyone's right to explain the way he likes. But would be
interested in knowing the reason for such usage.


<< *In YogavAsiShTha it is said that the mAyA and mind are synonyms.* >>

This itself clearly means that individual mind is not meant while talking
of the cause of Creation. It is not that Yoga Vasishta is contradicting
what I am saying.
