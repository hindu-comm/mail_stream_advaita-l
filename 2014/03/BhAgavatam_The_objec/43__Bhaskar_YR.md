which says that the objective world grasped by the senses is but a phantom 
creation of
the mind, illusory:

>  I am always at trouble when it is said that world is mere illusion of 
mind..because this is the theory of vijnAnavAda (bauddha mata) which 
shankara refutes in sUtra bhAshya (for example in 3rd adhyAya).  I think 
important point to be noted here is world AS GRASPED by the senses is 
ofcourse an illusion, because it varies from individual to individual 
according to his/her taste and tendency...but world AS IT IS is nothing 
but HIM since he is the abhinna nimittOpadAna kAraNa for the jagat.  For 
example if one sees a rose AS A ROSE without attributing any visheshaNa to 
it,( like it is red, it is big, it smells good, it;s petals are weak, good 
if we keep it in pooja room, bad if my girl friend rejects it :-)) etc) 
then that rose is ROSE only without any visheshaNa attributed by the 
conditioned mind/senses.  And this rose is  which is without any 
visheshaNa is always remains ROSE only without any attributes.  Perhaps 
that is what the below bhAgavata quote is saying :

// not having a reality apart from the dRk, seer //

>  Yes, there is no reality for the jagat apart from THAT...hence it is 
said in chAndOgya that when nAma rUpa vikAra is treated separately from IT 
is asatya, but when it is seen from its 'sadrUpa' it is SATYA only...

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
