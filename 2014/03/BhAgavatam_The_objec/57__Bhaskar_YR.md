Advaitis also support One Jeeva belief. 

>  that jeeva is not an ordinary mundane jeeva like us with conditioned 
upAdhi-s...Anyway, as you know here also there are some diversified view 
points... let us not discuss it now :-)) However, here is just a point to 
ponder :

There is only one Jeeva and that Jeeva is imagining the whole world in his 
mind or dream. The whole world in
contained in his mind. Ishwara and Guru and Scriptures also are in his 
mind.

>  if the whole world is my (one) own imagination, I would imagine the 
world which caters my needs and I dont want to imagine such a world in 
which I struggle everyday.  And if I get the knowledge of Atman, this 
whole imagined world would vanish in thin air, then there will be no more 
jeeva, no more world, no more scripture, no more guru...But since we are 
still seeing this jagat,  and struggling with it ever even AFTER somany 
jnAni-s have realized, seems either nobody ever realized sofar (if at all 
they were realized the jagat would have been end then and there and no 
more jagat for us to live-in now)  or jagat is there irrespective of one's 
own mental creation / or jnAni's realization...the pick of the choice is 
yours :-)) 

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
