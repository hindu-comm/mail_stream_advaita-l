 According to this *Tribune *news
report<http://www.tribuneindia.com/2013/20130924/j&k.htm#3>,
the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) has summarily renamed the
Shankaracharya Hill to Takht-e-Suleiman overlooking the Dal Lake in
Srinagar.  If this was not enough, the ASI has also presented a distorted
version of the history of the Shankaracharya Hill on the tourist
information plaque, a move which has justifiably outraged the Kashmiri
Pandits. From that news report:
'It is a matter of great concern that ASI has given the name
Takht-e-Suleiman (Throne of Solomon) to it, replacing the earlier plaque.
How have they come to this conclusion warrants an answer," said Predhuman K
Joseph Dhar, an expert on ancient Kashmir history. He said recently a
European historian visited the place and expressed surprise over
information provided to the people.'
'Of course, there is no question that this move is politically motivated
because it has no basis in history.  One wonders what is the connection
between Suleiman/Solmon and Adi Shankara.'

'In the annals of the Hindu tradition, Kashmir was almost synonymous with
"Sharada Desha" or "Sharada Peetha" or the Pedestal of Goddess Sharada (or
Saraswati, the Goddess of Learning). A conclusive evidence of this exalted
status of Kashmir can best be gleaned from the famous verse in praise of
Saraswathi as



*Namaste Sharada Devi Kashmirapuravasini|| I bow to you, Goddess Sharada,
the One who Resides in the Kashmira country||*

Question: What are Sankaracaryas of the four Sankara Maths doing about
this?????
