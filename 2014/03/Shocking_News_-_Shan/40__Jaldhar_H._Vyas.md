All signs point to Congress receiving a drubbing of epic proportions in 
the upcoming elections so you will see ever more desparate attempts by 
them to eke out a few more votes from their favored constituencies in the 
next few months.  But may I remind you once again that this type of thing 
is a political matter to be addressed by those who are actually Indian 
voters (and especially the grhasthas like you not the Shankaracharyas.) 
and it is offtopic for advaita-l.
