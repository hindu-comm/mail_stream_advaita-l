I do not know about the tradition of vAyu being the Guru in GuruvAyUr.  The
English translation for the 7th shloka is  // ....worshiped always by
Devaguru (BRhaspati) and vAyudeva.//

Also look at the first shloka: gururUpeNa yo nityam sharIre
vAyumandire...where the translation means to say: The lord is residing in
the body which is the abode of vAyu (vAyu is the power that keeps the body
alive, subordinating all other sense/motor organs).  So, the poet says that
the Atman is the Guru (like the dakShiNAmUrti) in the body.  This idea is
very similar to Bhagavan Ramana's method of looking upon the Self as the
Guru.  Ishvaro gururAtmeti mUrtibheda vibhAgine ...an advaitic invocatory
verse which is based on the bhAgavatam verse of the eleventh canto:
