Renowned bhAgavatar Brahmasri Nochur Venkataraman has composed eight verses

The uploaded pages were given as 'yajnaprasAda' at the conclusion of the
saptAha program conducted by the revered bhAgavathar in Bangalore on March
9, 2014.  About 500 people attended the program on all days. They
thoroughly enjoyed the torrent of discourse of an extremely rare order.
