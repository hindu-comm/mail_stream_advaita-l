Namaste

Very interesting. In the 7th Sloka - Guru Maaruta Vandyam Tam Svaatmajyotir
Upaasmahe. In Guruvayoor Vaayu is Guru and the Devata is Krishna. It is
very ancient temple may be 5000 years old. I think because Vayu is Guru we
have to approach Krishna with Guru Vayu's blessings. This is like Madhva
philosophy. I think Madhva got his idea by seeing Guruvayoor only. He also
is saying we cannot approach Vishnu directly but through Vaayu. They say
Hari Sarvottama Vayu Jeevottama. Some say Vayu Jihvottama but it is wrong.

But Narayana Bhattathiri has given Advaitic explanation in Narayaneeyam.
