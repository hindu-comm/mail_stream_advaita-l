 Dear Sri Chandramouli,
Your questions read thus : " If yes then both waking and dream creations are "satya" ?? Or are both "mithya" ??.
Kindly refer to Gaudapada Karika chapter 2- Shloka 6 and 
Shloka38 of Vedantadindima.Please apply the criterion as stated in the two shlokas 
to your own anuBava of waking and dream states.You will get the answers by yourself within yourself.

With respectful namaskars,Sreenivasa Murthy

 Pranams Sri BhaskarJi,

The Bhashya cited by me in my earlier post BUB 2-1-20 by and large covers
what you have mentioned in your post concerning creation/kArya-kAraNa
prakriya.

You will notice there is no mention in the statement attributed to Sri HH
concerning Brahman or kArya/kAraNa etc.The statement gives the impression
that the Shruti is more interested in discussing and clearing doubts about
the nature of creation in waking and dream states. I would indeed be
surprised if that were to be the purport of statements by Sri HH. Hence my
request for clarification.

All the same, I was in for more surprises from your response. Are you
suggesting there is no difference between dream creation is similar to
waking state creation ?. That is the impression I got from your post. If
yes then both waking and dream creations are "satya" ?? Or are both
"mithya" ??.

Regards
