Sringeri Acharya HH Sri Abhinava Vidyatirtha Mahasvamin:

A less advanced spiritual aspirant will find it difficult to comprehend the
waking state as being similar to the dream state. To cater to the doubts of
such people as regards creation, the scriptures speak variously of
origination. Scriptures are actually not concerned with creation at all.
