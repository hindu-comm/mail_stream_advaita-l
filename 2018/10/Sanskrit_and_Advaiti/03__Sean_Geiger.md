Paul Douglas does mention Leon MacLaren in his book.

The opening statement of the Mandukya Upanishad asserts everything in the
world is Om. All words have Om as their basis. This is a parallel line of
thought to that of Brahman's being all things in the world. Bhartrhari
describes the first step in language as a flash of consciousness, "sphota".
Brahman apparently becomes an object in the world by a transformation
through Maya. This is called vivarta. An equivalent concept in Sanskrit is
one of a root, dhatu becoming a word, pada, by transformation through
pratyayas, loosely translated as affixes. The present participle of the
dhatu, as- to be, in the neuter gender is sat and when joined with the
suffix, ya in the sense "excellent for", becomes the word satyam, Truth.

I could notice another parallel in Sankaracharya's works- that of
Panchikarana, where creation from five elements is explained. Any theory
that describes how One apparently becomes many will also be similar to
these explanations. Sureshvara assures us any such explanation  is as good
as any other.
