whether the MahAvAkyAs should be learnt only through the language of the Shrutis for gaining Knowledge

praNAms
Hare Krishna

Obviously for gaining knowledge the language of the shruti is a must otherwise how can it be untya pramANa??  We have to get the brahma jnana through shravaNAdi sAdhana of  shAstra which has been written in devanAgari.  If not, if some novel written in Sanskrit or in some other language contains the line which may imply  the 'meaning' of mahAvAkya, and an able adhikAri gains the knowledge after reading and contemplating on  it, then that story book in general and that line in particular would become untya pramANa for him.  Even though arguments go like he has studied shAstra in its originals, did the traditional sAdhana in his prior janmA-s, hence the shAstra can be maintained as untya pramANa in brahma jignAsa etc.  The fact is that for his current janma jnana the shAstra is parOksha pramANa and the line in story which is the cause of his current janma jnana is the direct / aparOksha pramANa.  

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
