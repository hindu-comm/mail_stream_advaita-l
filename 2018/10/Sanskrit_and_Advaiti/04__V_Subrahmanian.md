These could be a sample of Shankara's thought of Advaita getting
established from the cause-effect method:

Chandogya Upanishad bhashya 6.8.6:

 एवं हि तेजोबन्नमयस्य देहशुङ्गस्य वाचारम्भणमात्रस्य अन्नादिपरम्परया
परमार्थसत्यं सन्मूलमभयमसन्त्रासं निरायासं सन्मूलमन्विच्छेति पुत्रं गमयित्वा


Chandogya bhashya 8.5.4:

 जाग्रद्विषया अपि मानसप्रत्ययाभिनिर्वृत्ता एव, सदीक्षाभिनिर्वृत्ततेजोबन्न
मयत्वाज्जाग्रद्विषयाणाम्    [This one is very powerful.  All the objects of
the waking are 'created' by mental modifications alone; they are all
products of the three elements (fire, water and earth) that have emanated
from the Sat, Brahman.]  So, the matter-material is non-difference is
extended to Brahman - matter non-difference, on the cause-effect
non-difference theme.
