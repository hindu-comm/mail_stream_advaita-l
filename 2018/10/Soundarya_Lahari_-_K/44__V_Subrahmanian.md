Shri shankara bhagavatpadacharya firmly established the advaitha philosophy
which is the purport of the Upanishads removing doubts in people's minds.
  On the occasion of sharannavarathri of vilamba samvatsara, starting from
Wednesday 10-10-2018,  praying jaganmatha to bless all of us, senior
vidushi shrimathi vijayalakshmi will explain in detail the meaning and the
fruits of parayana of shlokas of jagadguru Shankaracharya's soundarya
lahari stothra in kannada taking one shloka per day.
 Let us all listen, make others listen. Let dasara be dasha papa hara. Let
us live in unity .🙏🙏
