Namatse..

This arrived in my Inbox at 0935 hrs today (07 Oct 2018) while probably it
was posted by Sri Keshavaat least 15-20 hrs earlier. Having noticed that it
was not posted in the Forum on time, Sri Keshava had forwarded to the
personal mail IDs of some of us at 0710hrs today stating the delay.
I had alerted Sri Jaldhar Ji also earlier on this. I had also contacted the
Helpdesk at Google or a solution. There has been no response from them. But
I found that many others havecomplained on Google on this score. Even
Company Group Mails appear to have faced the same problem.We seem to be
stuck with this issue for quite some time to come. All this after Google
changed to a new format.
Addressing the issue raised by Sri Keshava, please find here the link ID
for the text of SLS translated by Prof Suryanarayana Shastri. Please read
through Chapter IV which would answer your questions.
