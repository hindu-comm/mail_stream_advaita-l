Thanks for this piece of information. Even Mahaperiyava talks about 2 kinds
of Moksha given by Shiva:

1) Temporary Mutki: One is releasing everyone from samsara without going
into merits (AS PRALAYA MURTI RUDRA). All the souls take rest in Pralayam.
But that is not permanent.

2) Permanent Mukti: Grant Jnana to those who are fit to receive it (AS
JNANA MURTI SHIVA DAKSHINAMURTHY)

One doubt I have is: Will there be a situation where all jivas attains
liberation and there is no need of creation, maintenance and destruction?
