: Will there be a situation where all jivas attains liberation and there is no need of creation, maintenance and destruction?

praNAms 
Hare Krishna

Since there is a jeeva bheda even after mukti / paramArtha jnana ( vide reference jnAni's avidyA lesha / kAma krOdha / prArabdha karma / individuality etc. and apAntaratama-s dragging the remaining prArabdha karma opting for the reincarnation as vyAsa etc.) we have to say that there are multiple jeeva-s hence if one jeeva gets mukti another jeeva still suffer in avidyA mishrita prapancha and to elevate them to the higher states there are always jeeva-s in elite club to help the other ordinary jeeva-s.  So, some veda mantra says jeeva-s saNkhya is 'asaMkhyAta' one in a billion very rarely gets his / her svarUpa jnana (vide reference manushyANAm sahasreshu ...tattvataH - geeta shloka) remaining poor souls will have to get the janma again and again after the death (punarapi jananaM, punarapi maraNaM) So, shAstra says kalpa-s are anAdi and Ananta and in turn mAyA which is the source of this srushti / kalpa-s etc. too is nitya and the custodian of this mAya / prakruti is  Ishwara and he  too nitya.  Nitya here does not mean over a period of long time say about 100 / 1000 billion years etc. it is infinite time (anAdi / Ananta kAla) nityeshwaratvAt ishwarasya tatprakrutyOrapi yuktaM nityatvena bhavituM, prakruti dvayavatvameva hi ishwarasya ishwaratvaM clarifies bhAshyakAra in geeta bhAshya.  

So, to answer your doubt, there is no permanent end to this srushti kriya no altogether a fresh beginning either coz. Ishwara and his srushti both are nitya as there are asaMkhyAta jeeva-s taking birth, meeting death and enjoying / suffering their respective karma phala on this stage of jagat.   

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
