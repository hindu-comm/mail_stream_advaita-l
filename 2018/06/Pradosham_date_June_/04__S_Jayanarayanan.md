Again, a doubt regarding Pradosham dates for this month in California. Especially interested
in the first Pradosham of June, as it might be a highly auspicious "Soma Pradosham" that
falls on a Monday!

These online Panchangamshave it as June 10th (Sunday):

However, there other websites claim it to be June 11th (Monday):
