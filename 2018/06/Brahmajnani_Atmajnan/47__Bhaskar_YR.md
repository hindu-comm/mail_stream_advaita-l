Just on the lighter note, I would have loved a lot this Upanishad mantra had it been free from other adjectives like : karmAdhyaksha, ekO devaH etc.  because kevala nirguNa brahman cannot be adhyaksha of avidyAkruta karma and giving the phala etc.  these adjectives will be a hindrance to maintain the brahma svarUpa lakshaNa i.e. nirguNa, nirvishesha, niraakaara, niravayava, niraamaya etc.  :-)  Ofcourse, as per Advaita Ishwara's sarvajnatvaM, sarvashaktitvaM etc. holds water ONLY in avidyA kshetra whereas in paramArtha he is kevala nirguNa and sAkshi cheta.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar


Shankaracharya's choice of words is also quite deliberare सर्वप्रत्ययसाक्षिभूतश्चेतयिता केवलो निर्गुणो, to remind one of the svetAshvatara upaniShad mantra साक्षी चेता केवलो निर्गुणश्च.
