Namaste Sreenivasa Murthy ji

Some of us like to have our tea spiced with a little north indian masala
spices viz., some khaNDana manDana and tarka etc. You seem to like to have
your tea plain without any such additions like a true tea taster and feel
annoyed with indian style masala chai with 2 spoons of sugar!!

;)

Om
