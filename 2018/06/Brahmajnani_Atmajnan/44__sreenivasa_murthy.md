Dear friends,
Here is a very direct and easy Upanishad prakriya for one to be a Brahmajnani :
Even though Brahman has been called by many names in Upanishads.it is neither an object for vAk nor mental pratyaya.It is our own true Atmasvarpa which is the WITNESS of both 
vAk (speech) and pratyaya.
One Who cognizes the above within oneself by oneselfis Brahmajnani or AtmajnAni.
With respectful namaskars,Sreenivasa Murthy
