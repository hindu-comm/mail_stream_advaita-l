 Dear Sri Bhaskar,
When the tea is served the visitor simply drinks the tea without indulging in wasteful and useless discussion about the material design etc.etc of the cup.Please drink the tea and afterwards indulge in all the discussions. Please have mumukshatva and look into the facts as revealed within yourself by yourself first and then verify whether it is saguna Brahma or nirguna Brahma. AntarAtman is neither saguna or nirguna, transcends both. Please use anuBava and not intellect. The teaching reveals satyasya satyam which is your true nature and not satyam which is an adventious one. 

With respectful namaskars,Sreenivasa Murthy.

Hare Krishna

One can see this mantra to be giving both saguna and nirguna dharma-s of Brahman.


Ã˜  Yes, this mantra is an admixture of vyAvahArika satya saguNa brahma (upAsya brahma) which is avidyAkruta and pAramArthika nirguNa brahma (jneya brahma) which is upanishad pratipAdya.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
