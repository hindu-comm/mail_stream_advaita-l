Yes, the last view is correct. Avidya drishti is not invalid in advaita,
for srishti, veda, sadhana, moksha, etc. are all in that vyavahara only.
Amritabindu Upanishad:

 न निरोधो न चोत्पत्तिर्न बद्धो न च साधकः ।
 न मुमुक्षुर्न वै मुक्त इत्येषा परमार्थता ॥॥   cited by Gaudapada in the
Mandukya Karika.

The verse cited is of Madhusudana Saraswati. He says that all the various
upasakas of various deities, holding those deities to be the Supreme, are
aiming at that One Supreme only.
This view is possible only in Advaita and not any other. What is said below
is beside the matter.
