Why is avidya dristi is not invalid? If so, then all the knowledge in this
vyavahAra must be treated as valid, including the perceived snake on the
rope. Why only Vedanta is valid? why not non-vedantic doctorines? Why
Shankara has to refute so many pUrva-paxas? There is no criteria to
differentiate between validity and invalidity.

It may be possible only in Advaita PROVIDED such Supreme Being is;
1. Capable of taking various forms  (rUpam rUpam pratIrUpaM babhUva etc.)
2. Being anteryamin of various deities.
3. VaidIka shabda-s denoting deities such as 'Vishnu','Rudra','Ganapathi'
etc are indeed refer to that Supreme Being. Brahman should not be said to
be avAvachya etc.
4. Last but not least -- names and forms are really real and not mithya.
(and many more criteria)

None of such requirements applies to Supreme Being as conceived in Advaita.
Hence, the claim is quite questionable.
