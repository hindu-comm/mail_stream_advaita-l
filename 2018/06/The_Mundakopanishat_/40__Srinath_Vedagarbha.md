The question is simple -- the position ('Supreme Brahman can take different
forms') is valid or not? (I do not care you call it vyavahAra dristi or by

If valid, then advaitahAni as that makes Supreme Brahman sees 'differnce'.
If not valid, then Madhusudana Saraswati & Shankara's explanation
on Vibhuti Yoga is a lie.
