OM NAMAH SIVANANDAYA

Revered Patrons,

Sadar Pranam,

I don't know Sanskrit, I can read Hindi. Is there any website which has the
correct pronunciation of the most blessed and highly auspicious Sri
SataRudriya in English?

Any help in my learning to recite the Sri SataRudriya would be GREATLY
APPRECIATED.

Thank you,

Pranam,

OM
