Anandagiri says:

 *सर्वप्रपञ्चात्मकं ध्येयं रूपं दर्शयित्वा “त्रिपादस्यामृतं दिवि“ इति
प्रपञ्चाधिकं निरुपाधिकं तत्त्वं उपदिशता परिपूर्णसच्चिदानन्दैकतानः
तत्पदलक्ष्योऽर्थो निर्धारितः*
    The shruti passage 'tripaad asya  amrtam divi' is for the nirupadhika
Brahman. The 'tvam' has already been established much before in the
beginning chapters itself. The 'asi' is also taught in the 6th chapter and
the earlier ones as well. In fact at the beginning of the listing of the
vibhutis in this 10th chapter itself the aikya jnanam has been spoken of:

अहमात्मा गुडाकेश सर्वभूताशयस्थितः ।
अहमादिश्च मध्यं च भूतानामन्त एव च ॥ २० ॥
 भाष्यम्
<http://advaitasharada.sringeri.net/display/bhashya/Gita#bhashya-BG_C10_V20>
*अहम् आत्मा प्रत्यगात्मा* गुडाकेश, गुडाका निद्रा तस्याः ईशः गुडाकेशः,
जितनिद्रः इत्यर्थः ; घनकेश इति वा । सर्वभूताशयस्थितः सर्वेषां भूतानाम् आशये
अन्तर्हृदि स्थितः *अहम् आत्मा प्रत्यगात्मा नित्यं ध्येयः ।* तदशक्तेन च
उत्तरेषु भावेषु चिन्त्यः अहम् ; यस्मात् अहम् एव आदिः भूतानां कारणं तथा मध्यं
 च स्थितिः अन्तः प्रलयश्च ॥ २० ॥
 For those who cannot realize the Lord as the one innermost Self of
everyone, the chintanam of vibhutis that follow are the upaya.  So, at the
end of the Chapter, the Lord says that it is Brahman that is the entire
jagat, which itself is only a 'part' of Brahman (sopadhika). From this the
nirupadhika, jagat-untouched Brahman is for jneya, spoken of in the
beginng, 20th verse, is connected by Anandagiri by giving the full
teaching. For someone who has followed the BG from the beginning, along
with the Bhashya, there is no difficulty in gleaning the complete teaching
of the Mahavakya in the 10th chapter.
