Namaste.



Your own translation of Sri Anandagiri Acharya commentary reads as below.



Quote  << This is the lakshyartha (as
distinct from the vaachyartha) of Brahman, Tat.>>.



Meditation as suggested could lead to parOksha jnAna of “ tat “. He does
not mention it leads to jnAna as in advaita sidhanta. Meaning of terms
“tvam “ and “asi “ should also be understood for jnAna.
