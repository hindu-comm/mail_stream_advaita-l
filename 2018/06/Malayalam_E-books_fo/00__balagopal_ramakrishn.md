 Namaste,
Thanks Subbu Ji. It is truly a treasure trove. Got to see some out of print books too.

 Malayalam E-books for free download

Here is a link for downloading some 111 Malayalam E-books. Many of these
are Advaita texts with Malayalam translation.

Sri Shankara, a young scholar from Kerala, has done a very laudable service
by uploading/giving links to hundreds or even thousands of books in various
languages.
