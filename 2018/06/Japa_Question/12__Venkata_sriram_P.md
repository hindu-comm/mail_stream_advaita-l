It seems in the wake of your personal problems, you are going haywire seeking astrological solutions

1) Meditate on Dakshinamurti who is the Adi Guru and also the propagator of shAkta-vidya (shrIvidya).  
In that way confusion can be resolved.

2)  Mantras should be taken from sampradaya guru who has done purashcharana.  Only then, the iSTa-siddhi occurs.  
Learning online through books / youtube is not only prohibited but also leads to negative effects if pronounced wrongly.  

3)  Generally, iSTa-devata mantra should be kept as pradhAna-devata  and rest of the mantra-s as Angaa-s to the iSTa chanted as AmnAya-mantras 
and should be chanted for iSTa-devata-anugraha.

4) Last but not the least, start sahasra-gayatri japa immediately ASAP.

rgs,
sriram
