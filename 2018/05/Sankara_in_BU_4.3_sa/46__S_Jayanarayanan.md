Your objection is akin to:

 (Kalyan approaches a Vedantin.)

 Kalyan: "Why are you studying (and practising) the Vedanta?"
 Vedantin: "To attain the Supreme Bliss of DESIRELESSNESS - as is experienced in Deep Sleep."
 Kalyan: "Oh, reading Vedanta makes you so bored that you will eventually go to sleep!"

:-D

The very fact that the introduction to BU 4.3 speaks of "turIya" (the FOURTH) state,
implies that the first three states (Including Deep Sleep) are being transcended.

So let me ask you a fair question:

Why in your expert opinion does the BU 4.3 speak of the turIya state as the FOURTH state,
if it is the same as the deep sleep state? Note that the phrase mentioned in the context is
"jAgratsvapnasuShuptaturIyANyupanyastAni" - waking, dream, deep sleep, turIya states!

The turIya state is different from Deep Sleep - otherwise, it makes absolutely no sense
to speak of it as a FOURTH state!
