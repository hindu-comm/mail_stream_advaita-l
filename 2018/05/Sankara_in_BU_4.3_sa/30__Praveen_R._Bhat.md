The तात्पर्य of the entire Shruti being one is lost on many and it takes
a long time for anyone to get such तात्पर्यनिश्चय even after having
पुरुषार्थनिश्चय। Hence, Bhagavan Bhashyakara clarifies under Brahmasutra
1.4.14 in the context of one perceived conflict so:

यथाभूतो ह्येकस्मिन्वेदान्ते सर्वज्ञः सर्वेश्वरःसर्वात्मैकोऽद्वितीयः
कारणत्वेन व्यपदिष्टः, तथाभूत एव वेदान्तान्तरेष्वपि व्यपदिश्यते ;

There cannot be clearer words for Advaitins in any case.
