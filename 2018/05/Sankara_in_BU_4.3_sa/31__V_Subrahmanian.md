A similar statement from the Bhashyakara is, in the Mandukya bhashya:

 निर्बीजतयैव चेत् , सति प्रलीनानां सम्पन्नानां सुषुप्तिप्रलययोः
पुनरुत्थानानुपपत्तिः स्यात् ; मुक्तानां च पुनरुत्पत्तिप्रसङ्गः,
बीजाभावाविशेषात् , ज्ञानदाह्यबीजाभावे च ज्ञानानर्थक्यप्रसङ्गः ;
तस्मात्सबीजत्वाभ्युपगमेनैव सतः प्राणत्वव्यपदेशः, सर्वश्रुतिषु च
कारणत्वव्यपदेशः ।

// * It is spoken of as the cause in all the Upanishads by *assuming* It
(for the time being) to be the seed of others (the whole creation)* //

Such statements are guiding lights for the student/sadhaka of Advaita.
These statements go to clear confusion and give clarity when one encounters
apparent differences/contradictions across Upanishads and Bhashyas.
Identifying such statements in the Bhashya is by itself a blessing.  If one
is not aware of such statements, the loss is immense for it is only
misunderstanding and wrong impression that will prevail pertaining to
Upanishads and the Bhashya and the Bhashyakara.
