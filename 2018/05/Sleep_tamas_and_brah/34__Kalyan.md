Sri Chandramouliji

Why is jIva not aware in deep sleep? It is not due to some concealing ignorance or any such thing. Mantras 4.3.23 to 4.3.30 provide the answer - there is no second thing to be aware of. Since there is no second thing, it automatically implies non-existence of ignorance in deep sleep.

I have a question in this context - A jnAni may know he is liberated as long as he is alive, but once he passes away, will he retain even this awareness? 

Regards
Kalyan

 is linked with tama. When the

 you responded

 Therein
 itself lies the resolution
 to your question. 

 

 The
 question arises why is
 “liberation temporary” (your quote
 above) (limited to deep sleep state), and “in sushupti
 jiva is mukta” (from Sri
 Bhaskar Ji’s quote) (mukti being limited to sushupti
 only). Once a jiva is “liberated”
 or “mukta” it should be permanent only. Sidhanta is that
 jiva is always “liberated/mukta”
 only. Problem is he is not aware of it. Sushupti is proof of
 it. 

 

 The
 “liberated” or “mukta”
 state in Sushupti is presented to show that it (liberation
 or mukti) is not
 something to be attained afresh but is
 the jiva’s svarupa or nature. He is equally so in the
 other two states of
 jagrat/svapna as well. But it is more
 difficult to notice it because of the
 diversion provided by other things in those states. In
 Sushupti these
 diversions are absent and hence the jiva gets to have a
 glimpse of the nature
 of his true svarupa. Yet he is unable to identify it
 distinctly because he is
 still not aware of it. That this is so is
 proved by your own quotes above, namely
 “liberation
 temporary” (your quote above) (limited
 to deep sleep state), and “in sushupti jiva is mukta”
 (from Sri Bhaskar Ji’s
 quote) (mukti being limited to sushupti only). Thereby you
 are yourself conceding
 that the jiva though being Brahman in sushupti
 is yet unaware of it. That is exactly what is
 meant by presence of “ajnAna” or “ignorance” in
 Sushupti. Had he been aware of
 it, he would have been “liberated/mukta” permanently.


 

 As far as
 the Bhashya is
 concerned that this is the tAtparya or
 final conclusion of the analysis of Sushupti state is
 presented in 4-3-34.
