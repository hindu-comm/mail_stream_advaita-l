Namaste Sri Praveenji

I have already provided quotes and references to show that there is no ignorance in deep sleep. Apparently, I have not been able to convince you. So let us agree to disagree here.

If I ignored any of your messages, please note that it is not intentional. 

Best Regards
Kalyan

 I dont know the answer to your question. Shankara raises a
 similar question in 4.3.31, but does not give any answer.

 The lack of answer
 is not proof of no answer being there. It has been dealt
 with by the same Bhashyakara in Mandukya 1.6 and Chandogya
 6th chapter. Bhashyakara may not answer all questions
 everywhere as they are answered elsewhere. Brihad is the
 last studied Upanishad in the sequence of ten. ​Upanishads
 are one unit. Although one is sufficient, it doesn't
 mean that others are completely contradictory or even
 tangential. Else Bhashyakara need not quote other Upanishad
 mantras as hetus in any commentary.
 pArisheShanyAya
 tells us that the answer is avidyA. The avidyAkArya such as
 waking or dream is not possible without avidyAbIja in
 deep-sleep. Also, since my first mail was likely ignored, I
 shall repeat that suShupti is an example used by Shruti to
 explain the true nature of Atma since there is noise of
 mixing up oneself as someone else as in dream or waking.
 That is the only reason for suShupti to be used. Neither
 does it mean that avidyA is not there in suShupti nor that
 svarUpa is not there in other two states! suShupti is
 svarUpasya agrahaNa and other two are svarUpasya
 anyathAgrahaNa also along with svarUpasya
 agrahaNa.
