Sri Praveenji

I dont know the answer to your question. Shankara raises a similar question in 4.3.31, but does not give any answer.

For those who still doubt that deep sleep is highest state - Shankara says in 4.3.34 that the transcendental form of the Atman, free from ignorance, is experienced in the state of deep sleep -

तत्र च सर्वात्मभावः स्वभावोऽस्य, एवम् अविद्याकामकर्मादिसर्वसंसारधर्मसम्बन्धातीतं रूपमस्य, साक्षात् सुषुप्ते गृह्यते — इत्येतद्विज्ञापितम्

 In the face of such evidence, the contention that ignorance
 exists in deep sleep, has no ground to stand upon.
