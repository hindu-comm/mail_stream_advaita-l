Namaste Sri Chandramouliji

Let me respectfully disagree with you. The firm conclusion of B U 4.3 is that there is no ajnAna or ignorance or anything else in deep sleep apart from the Self.

Lack of awareness is not due to ajnAna. It is because there is no second thing to be aware of. Such is the conclusion of the upanishad and Shankara, as far as I understand it.

Regards
Kalyan
