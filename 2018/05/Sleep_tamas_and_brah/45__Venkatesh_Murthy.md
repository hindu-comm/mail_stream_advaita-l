Namaste

Any Avastha with beginning and end cannot be Brahman. Why? Because Brahman
is Unlimited and Unrestricted in every way. There may be bliss in Sushupti
but it is limited. It is not Unlimited and Unending.
If someone still argues Sushupti is the Brahman Bliss he belongs to
Kumbhakarana group. What happened to Kumbhakarana will happen to him.
