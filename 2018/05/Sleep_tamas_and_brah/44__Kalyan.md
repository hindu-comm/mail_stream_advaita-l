  //â€œThus did Yajnavalkya set Janaka beyond fear by a
  brief reference to scriptural evidence.
  Here, in a different connection, the states of
  ** WAKEFULNESS, DREAM, PROFOUND SLEEP AND TRANSCENDENCE (i.e. Turiya) **
  have been introduced in the words, 'Indha,' 'Has finer
  food,' 'The different vital forces,' and 'This Self
  is That which has been described as "Not this, not this//


Your quotation does not negate the fact that in the subsequent portion of the bhAshya, ignorance is completely denied in the state of deep sleep, thereby treating deep sleep as supreme.


//Obviously, the state of deep sleep has already been rejected as the Supreme//

There is nothing obvious about this.

Kalyan
