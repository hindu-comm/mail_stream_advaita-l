Namaste Kalyan ji,

Once it is understood that one is eternally liberated, one can give up the
ideas of paramArtha and vyavahAra too. Actually, all three states are in
the realm of vyavahAra only - because the deep sleep ends eventually, it
cannot be considered as paramArtha. The nature of the Atma is clearest
there, but that too is only a state. Once that is used to identify the
Atma, the idea of states itself can be given up.

Regards,
Venkatraghavan
