 //What Shankara means is 'in profound sleep the
 ignorance of the kind vikshepa, projection of multiplicity,
 is not there. The basic ignorance of the type aavarana,
 enveloping, is definitely there.' This has been
 clarified in that bhashya's commentary/gloss. //


Shankara himself does not say any such sort of a thing that you say above. At many places in B U 4.3, Shankara admits no ignorance in deep sleep. In 4.3.32, the Self in deep sleep state is mentioned as the highest and advaitam. This cannot hold true if there is ignorance in deep sleep.
