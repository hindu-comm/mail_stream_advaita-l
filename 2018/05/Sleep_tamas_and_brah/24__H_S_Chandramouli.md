Namaste Sri Kalyan Ji,

Reg  <<  For those who still doubt that deep sleep is highest state -
Shankara says in 4.3.34 that the transcendental form of the Atman, free
from ignorance, is experienced in the state of deep sleep -

तत्र च सर्वात्मभावः स्वभावोऽस्य, एवम्
अविद्याकामकर्मादिसर्वसंसारधर्मसम्बन्धातीतं
रूपमस्य, साक्षात् सुषुप्ते गृह्यते — इत्येतद्विज्ञापितम् >>,

That is right. It is the highest state for the vignanamaya Atman. It is
experienced no doubt in deep sleep by the vignanamaya Atman, but not
cognized ( or recognized) as Brahman. That is ajnAna or ignorance. That is
the conclusion of 4-3-34.

स्वयञ्ज्योतिरात्मा एषः परम आनन्दः, एष विद्याया विषयः

Regards
