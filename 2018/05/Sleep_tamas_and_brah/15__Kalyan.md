 Dear Sri Venkatraghavanji
   //It appears to me that the purpose of the teaching here is to talk of the nature of Atma - of it being self effulgent, one without a second, free from misery etc, because such a knowledge is key to liberation.//
//To convey this understanding of the Atma to Janaka, Yajnavalkya takes him through each of the three states in sequence. In each instance, the states are used as experiential bases to understand the nature of Atma. Like any good teacher, Yajnavalkya starts off with the things that the student has personal experience of, and uses that to teach something about the Atma.//

No issues. I agree.
//Looked at from this perspective, the nature of deep sleep, where one experiences no duality, no misery, no ignorance is used to highlight not the nature of deep sleep (for that is universally known) but to point out that that is in fact the nature of Atma.//
It is not universally known that deep sleep is free from ignorance.. If that were the case, people would not have argued for ignorance in deep sleep.
//If, however, you are convinced that this teaching is specifically about the Atma in deep sleep, and not Atma per se, one has to consider what the utility of such a teaching would be. //
I do think this teaching is about Atman. Deep sleep is brought about to show that ignorance is not in the nature of the Atman, since the Atman is free from ignorance in deep sleep.
//Ultimately, I am assuming that we are studying this so that one can be liberated, and from that perspective, if your stand leads you to believe you are already liberated (because you experience that freedom in deep sleep and understand that to be your true nature), that would be a fantastic outcome. There is nothing more to be done.//
I am liberated only in deep sleep currently. The idea is to get liberated in all the other states too.
//However, if that stand leads you to believe that one ought to permanently experience the freedom of deep sleep in order to be liberated//
This is not possible, so this is not my stand.

Best RegardsKalyan

Sri Venkataraghavanji

4.3.32 is not the only place where ignorance is denied for the self in deep sleep. Below is more list of references where ignorance is completely denied for the self in deep sleep. My only suggestion is to read that entire section, though you may have already done so.

[Shankara refers to 4.3.22 where the self in deep sleep is beyond the woes of the heart. It is pure like water, one and the witness 4.3.32. Self is unattached in deep sleep 4.3.18. It is beyond desires and free from evils and fearless 4.3.22. Self in deep sleep is free from all relative attributes and devoid of action and results 4.3.19. Self merges in nirguna brahman in deep sleep 4.3.21. In deep sleep there is no ignorance 4.3.21. Deep sleep self is free from grief 4.3.21. 

The form of self in deep sleep is free from ignorance , desire and work 4.3.22. In deep sleep father is no father, mother is no mother etc. In deep sleep, the Self becomes one with Atman or nirguna Brahman 4.3.23. Self is free from limiting adjuncts in deep sleep 4.3.30. Self is free from ignorance in deep sleep 4.3.32.

Self in deep sleep is pure like water, it is the witness, and it is advaitam or non-dual, one without a second. 4.3.32. This is the highest state, the supreme bliss 4.3.32.]

Kalyan

Namaste,Nice
thread and references.One point from
Subbuji's post that drew my attention: in the BUB
4.3.32, Shankaracharya says:यत्रपुनः सा
अविद्या सुषुप्तेवस्त्वन्तरप्रत्युपस्थापिका
शान्ता, तेन
अन्यत्वेनअविद्याप्रविभक्तस्य
वस्तुनः अभावात्
The verbs used in the bhAShya above are
telling. In describing avidyA in deep sleep, Shankara
saysसुषुप्तेअविद्या
*शान्ता* - that
is, in deep sleep, avidyA is pacified/ dormant, whereas the
objects that appear different from oneself are
absentअन्यत्वेनअविद्याप्रविभक्तस्य
वस्तुनः *अभावात्*.If avidyA were absent, he
could have said so - so he acknowledges its presence, but
says that its power to manifest difference is temporarily
subdued.

In 4.3.32 itself Shankara begins his commentary by
proclaiming:  यत्र

पुनः सा अविद्या
सुषुप्ते
वस्त्वन्तरप्रत्युपस्थापिका
शान्ता, तेन अन्यत्वेन

अविद्याप्रविभक्तस्य
वस्तुनः अभावात् , तत्
केन कं पश्येत्

विजानीयाद्वा ।



// When, however, *that ignorance which presents things
other than the self

is at rest, in that state of profound sleep,* there being
nothing separated

from the self by ignorance, what should one see, smell, or
know, and

through what? Therefore, being fully embraced by his own
self-luminous

Supreme Self, the Jiva becomes infinite, perfectly serene,
with all his

objects of desire attained, and the self the only object of
his. desire,

transparent like water, one, because there is no second : It
is ignorance

which separates a second entity, and that is at rest in the
state of

profound sleep ; hence 'one.' //



It is clear that Shankara qualifies the ignorance as
'that which presents

things other than the self'. So, only this aspect of
ignorance is at

rest. Shankara nowhere says the aavarana ignorance is at
rest there. One

can find the aavarana presence being admitted by Shankara in
the Mandukya

bhashyas. There in 1.11 Shankara says, on Gaudapada's
verse, that the jiva

is bound by both the causal ignorance and the
product-ignorance in the

waking and dream. In the deep sleep however, he is bound
only by the causal

ignorance. In 1.13 he further says that what is common to
both the deep

sleep and turiya is the non-cognition of dvaita, duality,
aka

product-avidya. This is exactly what is meant in all the
BU instances

where Shankara has said or appears to have said 'there
is no ignorance in

deep sleep'. If this is understood, one will have no
room for seeing

dichotomy, etc.across the Upanishads / bhashyams.





Read introduction by Shankara to BU 4.4.7:



‘अथाकामयमानः’ (बृ. उ. ४
। ४ । ६)

<http://advaitasharada.sringeri.net/display/bhashya/Brha?page=4&id=BR_C04_S04_V06&hl=%E0%A4%85%E0%A4%A5%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%95%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%AE%E0%A4%AF%E0%A4%AE%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%A8%E0%A4%83>

श्लोकशब्दवाच्यः —



Madhavananda:



// Then beginning with, ' But the man who does not
desire (never

transmigrates)' (Ibid.), *liberation consisting in the
identity with all,

which is the thing that was sought to be explained by the
example of the

state of profound sleep, has been described.* And the cause
of liberation

has been stated to be the attainment of all objects of
desire through their

becoming the Self. But since this state is unattainable
without

Self-knowledge, the cause of liberation has by implication
been stated to

be the knowledge

of Brahman. Therefore, although desire has been said to. be
the root of

bondage, it is ignorance that, being die opposite of what
leads to

liberation (knowledge),

has virtually been stated to be the cause of bondage. Here
also liberation

and its means have been dealt with by the Brahmana.//.



Shankara clearly says that deep sleep is an example for
liberation and not

identical with liberation. It would be wrong to expect an
example and the

exemplified to be identical; Shankara has himself denounced
this view in

another Bhashya saying that 'if so, the relationship of
example-exemplified

itself is lost' and therefore it is sufficient if the
example has only a

few similarities with the exemplified. And this is what is
the case in the

BU exposition. Also Shankara clearly says that
Self-knowledge is a must for

liberation / removal of ignorance and this is also clearly
stated in the

Upanishad. So, there is absolutely no room in the Upanishad
or the Bhashya

for the problems that you think are present.
