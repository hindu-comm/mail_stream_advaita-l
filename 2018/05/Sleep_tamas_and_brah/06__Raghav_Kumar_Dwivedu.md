Namaste Venkatraghavan ji

Thats a helpful note from Subbuji's post..Viz.,
Shankara says सुषुप्ते अविद्या *शान्ता* - that is, in deep
sleep, avidyA is pacified/ dormant, whereas the objects that appear
different from oneself are absent  अन्यत्वेन
अविद्याप्रविभक्तस्य वस्तुनः *अभावात्*.
If avidyA were absent, he could have said so - so he acknowledges its
presence, but says that its power to manifest difference is temporarily
subdued.



Generally we strive for avidyAnivRttiH or nAshaH rather than avidyAyAh
shAntiH. So it's telling that mere temporary quiescence of avidyA is
implied in suShupti.

Om
Raghav

P.S. Sleep can be called temporary liberation if we so prefer, which means
it's not really the mukyArtha of the word muktiH which is by definition
nityaH.
