Thanks for these links. In volume 2, from page 600, there are countless
passages from the shruti, smriti, purana, mahabharata, bodhayana gruhya
sutras, etc. cited for the bhasma tripundra dharana.  The Vedantic purport
of the mantra chanted while tripundra dharana, from Atharvashiras: agniriti
bhasma, vaayurit bhasma,....that is explained in the Brhajjabalopanishad is
summarized by Vidyaranya in the commentary thus: the Chandogya Upanishad
teaches that one should enquire the source of the elements earth, water and
fire and trace that source to Brahman.  Thus, the anusandhanam,
contemplation, of the Vedantic truth occurs when one chants those mantras
while donning the tripundra.

On an aside. Bigoted Vaishnavas who hate the above and the idea of Shiva
being the Supreme, have blacklisted the Suta samhita of Veda Vyasa, the
Yoga Vasishtha of Valmiki and the Adhyatma Ramayana of Veda Vyasa solely
because of their intolerance of the teachings contained therein: Advaita,
Shiva paratva and bhasma dharana. One can also extend this to their holding
certain puranas to be tamasic as the criterion to do so.
