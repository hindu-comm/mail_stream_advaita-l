This is a very interesting article giving an idea of the status of
scientific knowledge about Cosmos and Prof.Ashtekar's contribution to it
bringing out a parallelism between Advaita/Buddhism and the nature of the
universe as per physics. I believe it will be of interest to several
scholars in this group.
