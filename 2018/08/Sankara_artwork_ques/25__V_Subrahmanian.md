It is also possible that the deities represent the ones on which Shankara
composed hymns.  The Subrahmanya Bhujangam is popularly believed to be of
Shankara.  On Devi we have the Soundarya lahari, Gowri Dashakam, etc. On
Ganapati there is the famous pancharatnam.  On Vishnu and Siva too
Shankara's poems are quite popular.
