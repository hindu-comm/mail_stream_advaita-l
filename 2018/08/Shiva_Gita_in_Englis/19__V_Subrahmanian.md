The authenticity of the Shiva gita as a Vedantic work teaching Brahma vidya
for moksha is also substantiated by the several commentaries on it.  One is
by the Sringeri Jagadguru of the 16 - 17 CE.  More than anything the
criterion to decide whether a work is authentic or not is that whether it
is Vedantic or not.  Vedanta is not about any deity but about the Brahman
that is not a finite deity.  A deity could be used to convey the Vedantic
truth by a work.  A deity could also be used to bring about chitta shuddhi
by being devoted to it, as one of the means among many such means. There is
evidence in the shastras and Shankara bhashya that a saguna brahman need
not necessarily be a deity; it could be any other thing like the pranava.
This is the conclusion of Vedantins.  Surely, theologians will not agree
with this.  It can also be seen that the theological schools  such as
pashupata and pancharatra were refuted in the Brahma sutras.
