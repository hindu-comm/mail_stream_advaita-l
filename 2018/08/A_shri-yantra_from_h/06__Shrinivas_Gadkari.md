Namaste Shri Subramanian,

Hopefully my last post on this topic.

Just because a diagram very likely has been drawn by beings from
a higher loka does not make the work apaurusheya. After all these
beings from higher loka (say for example gandharva-s) are manifested
limited beings.

shrI-yantra diagram by itself, is a divine diagram, and most certainly would
be termed apaurusheya.

Regards,
Shrinivas Gadkari

Is there an 'apaurusheya' element suggested in this whole issue?
