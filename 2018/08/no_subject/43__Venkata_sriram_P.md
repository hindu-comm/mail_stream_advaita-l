It is the 46th shloka from Saundarya Lahari:

ललाटं लावण्यद्युतिविमलमाभाति तव यत्
द्वितीयं तन्मन्ये मुकुटघटितं चन्द्रशकलम् ।
विपर्यासन्यासात् उभयमपि सम्भूय च मिथः
सुधालेपस्यूतिः परिणमति राकाहिमकरः ॥

Meaning

Thy forehead shines clear with the splendour of its beauty. Hence I think that the crescent moon set on Thy crown is a second one. The two, placed invertedly and joined together, (with the diameter of the one set on that of the other) would form the autumnal full-moon, joined with the use of nectar.

rgs,
sriram
