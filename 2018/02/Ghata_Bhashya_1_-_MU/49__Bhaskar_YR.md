Yathaive hi ideaaneeM api idaM kAryaM kAraNAtmanA sat evaM prAgutpatterapi iti gamyate.  Na hi edAneem api idam kAryaM kAraNAtmAnaM antareNa svatantraM eva asti.  Hence like kAraNa brahma and kArya jagat too trishu kAleshu na vyabhicharati clarifies bhyAshyakAra elsewhere  : yathA cha kAraNam brahma trishukAleshu sattvaM na vyabhicharati "evaM kAryamapi jagat trishu kAleshu sattvaM na vyabhicharati.  Ofcourse these are all for the reference of those who are interested in doing the samanvaya between brahma kAraNa satkArya vAda and brahma nirvisheshatvaM.  This might not be an appropriate reference  to the jeevas' bhrAnta jagat srushti vAdins.  

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
