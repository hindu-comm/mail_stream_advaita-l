Subject: {भारतीयविद्वत्परिषत्} Sanskrit commentary on Narada Bhakti Sutras
To: भारतीयविद्वत्परिषत् <bvparishat at googlegroups.com>


Namaste,

There is a beautiful commentary in Sanskrit on Narada Bhakti Sutras by
Swami Harshananda ji of RK Mutt, Bangalore.  I have purchase this online
and reading it.

I am enjoying this and thought of sharing with you as it is the custom that
the 'madhura-padArtha' should never be eaten alone.

Here is the link for e-book.
