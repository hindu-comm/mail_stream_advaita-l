Namaste Anandji,

I have already begun the OCR +keying in effort using the existing text on
trial basis. I've had some improving experience with OCRs+keyin in with
couple of Upanishad Tikas and parts across the past two years. So far, it
looks good. I think I can take care of the entire text on my own in some
weeks even if no one pitches in. I was anyway planning to do so but a
little down the line.

Kind rgds,
--Praveen R. Bhat
