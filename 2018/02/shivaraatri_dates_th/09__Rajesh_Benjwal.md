Namaste,

There is no such strict single rule that "Shivaratri tidhi come on
Tryodashi along with chaturdasi."  Narad Samhita says "अर्धरात्रियुता यत्र
माघकृष्णचतुर्दशी । शिवरात्रिवतं तत्र सोऽश्वमेधफलं लभेत्।।"  So it is
midnight of Magha Krishna Chaturdashi as per Narad Samhita. ईशान
संहितायाम्, "माघकृष्णचतुर्दश्यामादिदेवो महानिशि । शिवलिङ्गतयोद्भूत:
कोटिसूर्यसमप्रभ:।। तत्कालव्यापिनि ग्राह्या शिवरात्रिव्रते तिथि:।" As per
Ishana Samhita there should be Chaturdashi during midnight. In Niranaya
Sindhu it is mentioned that Chaturdashi should be pradoshavyapini and
ardharatri vyapini and it should be reached the first ghati of the third
prahara from ardharatri.

If it is trayodashi and before 4 ghati of sunset we get Chaturdashi then
that is also recommended.

So I think there are many more variables than only saying that "Shivaratri
tidhi come on Tryodashi along with chaturdasi."


Now answer of the OP. Yes, 13 of February is Mahashivaratri. According to
our calculation for our place, which is Dehradun, Nishita Kaal Puja Time
is  24:05 to 24:57 and Maha Shivaratri Parana Time is on 14th, 07:03 to
15:16.


Thanks
