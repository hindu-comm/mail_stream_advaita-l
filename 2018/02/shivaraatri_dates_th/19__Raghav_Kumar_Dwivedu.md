Namaste Anand ji
Thank you for the authentic details as always, written in a comprehensible
manner.

It's interesting that the muhurta of 48 minutes was the basic unit and the
day had 15 muhurtas and night had another 15 muhurtas. A total of 30
muhurtas constitute one day-night cycle. (So the 8th muhurta of the night
representing the second half assumes significance.)

30 muhurtas × 48 minutes per muhurta = 24 hours x 60 minutes = 1440 minutes
in a day-night cycle .

Today we follow the 24 hours cycle. Was the ghaDiya of 60 minutes used even
by us or us it a recent introduction in to our system?
 Also was the exact duration of the one minute (60 seconds ) unit common to
both our ancient almanacs and modern chronometry? That sounds like too much
to be a coincidence? Am I missing something here...

Om
Raghav
