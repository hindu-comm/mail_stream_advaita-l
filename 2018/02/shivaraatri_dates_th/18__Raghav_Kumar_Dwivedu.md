Thank you Anandji about the reason for tithis bring of different durations
being the eccentricity of the moon's orbit. I had assumed it's due to
inclination with ecliptic which gives it lower relative velocity along the
ecliptic when it crosses it, as being the cause. Truth is it's a minor
contributory factor since it's only a 5 degree inclination. What you
mentioned is the main cause.

 I did a rough calculation and it's clear that the change in lunar velocity
due to equal areas being covered  in equal intervals of time is the primary
factor for the change in moon's synodial velocity which in turn determines
tithi duration.

 Thank you for the clarification.

Om
Raghav
