praNAms Sri Anand Hudli prabhuji
Hare Krishna

Thank you very much for the detailed clarification with regard to the dates of shivarAtri.  As a side note it seems as per Tamil panchaanga even R~tu also change, I have seen saMkalpa for the tarpaNa as per Tamil calendar ( Sri Subbu prabhuji shared it I reckon), it has been said there that hemanta ritu instead of 'shishira ritu'.  And ekaadashi nirNaya also bit complicated amoung various tradition.  

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
