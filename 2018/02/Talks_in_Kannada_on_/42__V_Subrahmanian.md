Talks in Kannada on the Mahimna Stotra with commentary of Madhusdudana
Saraswati

Shri B.Shrivathsa of Bangalore had delivered talks at the Sringeri Shankara
MaTha here on two occasions, as a series, on the Shiva Mahimna Stotra of
Pushpadanta.  The stotra's worth can be known from the fact that
Madhusudana Saraswati has written a unique Hari-para and Hara-para
commentary on the work.  The talk series will help one grasp the purport
thereof.
