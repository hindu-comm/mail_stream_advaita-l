In Advaita the thesis is thus stated:

BSB 2.2.7  After showing the defect in the Sankhya theory (which provided
examples), the Vedantin states his own mechanism:

परमात्मनस्तुस्वरूपव्यपाश्रयमौदासीन्यम् , मायाव्यपाश्रयं च प्रवर्तकत्वम् —
इत्यस्त्यतिशयः ॥ ७ ॥

[AudAsInyam, Brahman is of the nature of inactivity inherently and the
driving urge for creation from the standpoint of maya. ]

A gloss, Ratnaprabha, clarifies:  अस्मन्मते कल्पिताकल्पितयोरविरोध इत्यतिशयः
  In Vedanta, the 'relation' or 'interaction' is between a real and an
unreal and hence there is no contradiction.

Thus, the question of interaction does not arise. When it is said
'sannidhimAtrena', there is nothing that Brahman expects or gets from Maya,
whereas the latter gets the sentiency from Brahman, because of proximity
and thereby creation is initiated. When it is said 'Brahman is the nimitta
kAranam', the sankalpa to create, etc. is the contribution of Maya.
