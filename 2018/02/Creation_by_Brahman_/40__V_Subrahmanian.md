There is no contradiction as the causehood can be brought about by the
mayashakti association that is unreal.

Here too there is no contradiction. The fundamental point to be noted is
that Maya is inert. For it to do anything there is the need for sentience.
Desire to create can happen only in a sentient entity. This has to come
from Brahman the only sentient entity. To say that Maya creates, with the
superintendence of Brahman, is quite in order and thereby Brahman is the
instrumental cause. Maya cannot be the instrumental cause for the reason
already stated.

The indescribability and inexplicability are about the impossibility of
stating whether maya is sat or asat. Otherwise, the Veda is quite clear
that  maya is trigunAtmikA. With all those gunas it can perform action.
However, to be able to do that the fundamental chaitanya has to come from
elsewhere. Brahman is the source from which it gets that.

Proximity is not from Brahman's point of view but from maya's angle.
Advaita accepts mayashakti as a superimposition on Brahman. That way it has
proximity to Brahman.

The real does not affect the unreal but the unreal gets affected by the
real. The mechanism is unreal because any activity involving an unreal is
unreal alone. Hence alone there is no interaction. That is what the

Shankara has answered all questions in the BGB 9.10:  [The essence of the
commentary being the highlighted portion at the end]

*English Translation Of Sri Shankaracharya's Sanskrit Commentary By Swami
Gambirananda*

9.10 Maya, under Me; adhyaksena, as the supervisor, remaining changeless as
a mere witness under all circumstances; prakrtih, the Prakrti, My maya
consisting of the three gunas and characterized as ignorance; suyate,
produces; the world sa-cara-acaram. of the moving and the none-moving
things. Thus there is the Vedic text, 'The one divine Being is hidden in
all beings; He is amnipresent, the indwelling Self of all bengs, the
Supervisor of actions, the refuge of all beings, the witness, the one who
imparts consceiousness, unconditioned [This is according to Sankaracarya's
commentary on this verse. A.G. interprets kevala as non-dual.-Tr.] and
without alities' (Sv. 6.11). Anena hetuna, owing to this reason-because of
this presiding over; O son of Kunti, the jagat, world, with the moving and
the non-moving things, consisting of the manifest and the unmanifest;
viparivartate, revolves, under all conditions [During creation, continuance
and dissolution.] All the activities of the world in the form, 'I eat this;
I see; I hear this; I experience this happiness, suffer this sorrow; I
shall do this for that purpose, [Ast. omits this portion.-Tr] I shall do
this for this purpose; I shall know this,' etc. indeed arise owing to their
being the objects of the conscious witness. They verily exist in
consciousness, and end in consciousness. And such mantras as, 'He who is
the witness of this is in the supreme heaven' [Supreme heaven, the heart;
i.e. He is inscrutable.] (Rg., Na. Su. 10.129.7; Tai. Br.2.8.9), reveal
this fact. Since it follows from this that there is no other conscious
being part from the one Deity-who is the witness of all as the absolute
Consciousness, and who in reality has no contact with any kind of
enjoyment-, therefore there is no other enjoyer. *Hence, in this context,
the question, 'For what purpose is this creation?', and its answer are
baseless - in accordance with the Vedic text, 'Who know (It) truly, who can
fully speak about this here? From where has this come? From where is this
variegated creation?' (Rg. 3.54.5; 10.129.6). And it has been pointed out
by the Lord also: 'Knowledge remains covered by ignorance. They the
creatures become deluded' (5.15).*
