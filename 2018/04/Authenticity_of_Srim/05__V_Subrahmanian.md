This last 'becoming Vasudeva Himself' is not accepted by any denomination
of Bhagavatas. The other tenet ' That means other things are Anruta only.'
is also not acceptable to Bhagavatas. It is not possible to ascertain which
shade of Bhagavatas Shankara is commenting upon in that adhikarana. For, he
starts with 'this is a system that accepts Brahman as both upadana and
nimitta karanam'. When you see the Vaishnavas of the present time, Madhvas
and Ramanuja-s accept Pancharatra, but the former do not accept the abhinna
nimittopadana kaaranatvam of Brahman while the latter alone accept that.
So, we are not aware of the exact system that Shankara is talking about.
