Namaste

The opening statement by Sri Karapatriji in Bhagavata Sudha is -

Bhagavatam is the Essence of all Vedas and Sastras. What more Authenticity
do you want?

First Sloka reference given next with his explanation -

निगमकल्पतरोर्गलितं फलं शुकमुखादमृतद्रवसंयुतम् ।
पिबत भागवतं रसमालयं मुहुरहो रसिका भुवि भावुकाः ॥ भागवत १-१-३

He Rasikas, The Veda itself is a Kalpavruksha - desire fulfilling tree.
Bhagavatam is the ripe fruit of the Veda Kalpavruksha. Bhagavatam has come
from the lips of the foremost Bhagavata Suka Muni. Therefore it is mixed
with Amruta the heavenly nectar. It is pure and not mixed with any hard
seeds or stones. It is expressing the Rasa Paramatma. Therefore it is Rasa
only. Upanishads have said Raso Vai Saha. Brahman is Rasa only. Even if you
become liberated also keep on drinking the Bhagavata Rasa. This is easy to
get on Earth but difficult to get in heaven, Kailasa, Vaikuntha and other
places. Rasikas, therefore drink it, drink and keep on drinking. Don't stop
drinking. Don't stop drinking.

Another Swamiji gave one more explanation for Bhagavata in Kannada.
Whenever a person dies Yama Dootas will come to take him away. At that time
Vishnu Dootas also come. If that person has tasted and drunk Bhagavata Rasa
the Vishnu Dootas will ask the Yama Dootas 'Namma Bhaagava?' Is he
belonging to us? If Yama Dootas say yes the Vishnu Dootas will simply say
'Ta'. Means 'Give him to us'. They will take him to Vaikuntha. Yama Dootas
go back empty handed.
