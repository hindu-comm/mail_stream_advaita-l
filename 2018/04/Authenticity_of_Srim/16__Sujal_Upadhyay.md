Pranams,

There is one book  of Karpatri ji Maharaj which is bi-lingual Hindi-English.

'The Linga and the Great Goddess'

https://www.amazon.in/Linga-Great-Goddess-Louis-Gabin/dp/818656988X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1522740008&sr=8-1&keywords=linga+and+the+great+goddess

It is the corrected proper translation of Hindi. Older Danielou's
translation was flawed as per the author.

It is a good book to read.

Karpatri ji Maharaj is the guru of Puri and Jyotir Matha Shankaracharyas.
Puri Shankaracharya Puri Matha (Govardhan Pitha) Shankaracharya Swami
Nischalananad Saraswati ji Maharaj is very active. May be you can find some
books if you contact them.

OM
