Pranams,

Puri Shankaracharya, in one of his talks had said that In Srimad
Bhagavatam, it is not just bhakti that is glorified. It contains Nyaya,
Raja niti, and many such important siddhantas, but all these are sidelined
and pravachans are focused only on bhakti aspect.

I have also seen. Kapila Gita, Sukhdeva's teachings in canto 12 and most
importantly ChatuH Sloki Bhagavat is given little importance. Knowledge
given in ChatuH Slki bhatavat is given to Bhagavan Brahma ji by Bhagavan
Vishnu  before the universe was created. With this knowledge Brahma ji
created the world and so he himself will not be influenced by it.


OM
