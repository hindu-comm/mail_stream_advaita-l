Namaste

Another point is Advaitis agree a Mithyaa Vastu can have Sadhakatva like a
dream object can have real effect. Therefore even if Bhagavatam is bogus it
has Sadhakatva of preaching Advaita Philosophy, Bhakti and so on. It is
good only.

Another point is we should reject some teachings in Puranas and take only
the good part. In Padma Purana we have some bad Sloka on Advaita and Adi
Sankara as Maayaa Vaadam Asacchaastram Pracchannam Bauddham and so on. Do
we take that? No. But in same Padma Purana we can see Siva Geeta. Do we
take that? Yes. Similarly we should take the good and reject the bad in
Bhagavatam.
