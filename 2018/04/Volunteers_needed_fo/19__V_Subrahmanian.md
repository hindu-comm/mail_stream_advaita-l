Volunteers needed for a noble initiative

Namaste

There is an initiative by a few volunteers devoted to the propagation of
the message of Sanatana Dharma to provide English subtitles to the Hindi
speeches of His Holiness the Shankaracharya of Puri, Sri Nischalananda
Saraswati.  Since the group involved in this work is needing the assistance
of some more volunteers, those who have a fairly good grasp of Hindi and
ability to render the same into English may please participate in this
noble endeavor and become beneficiaries of the blessings of the Mother
Sanatana Dharma.  For more details please contact Sri Ajay Bhargavan on
phone: 72042 16181 and Sri Natraj Maneshinde  email:
natrajmaneshinde at gmail.com

warm regards
