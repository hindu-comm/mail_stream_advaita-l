Dear friends,
 Sri Shankara says : (1) dEhAdiShu anAtmasu 'ahamasmi' ityatmabuddhiravidyA || [Brahmasutra; 1-3-2]
(2) nirvikArAtmabuddhiSca vidyEtIha prakIrtitA || [UpadEshasahasri; Chapter1- Shloka12]
It is very surprising to see that the scholars of this group do not point out and dwell/ teach upon such vital and important goal of the study of Vedanta.I request the scholars of this group to ponder over this.
With respectful namaskars,Sreenivasa Murthy
