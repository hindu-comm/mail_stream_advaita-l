Namaste,

I would like to paraphrase some words of Acharyaji: seeing waking as a
reality separate from dream is saMsAra-kAraka, while seeing waking as dream
is mokSha-kAraka.

To think of waking as dream while also keeping it separate from dream is
confusion, or just about entertaining a theoretical possibility at best. We
would then be among those very people who "dream of a future" while waking
and let the future saMsAra form up!

astu,
