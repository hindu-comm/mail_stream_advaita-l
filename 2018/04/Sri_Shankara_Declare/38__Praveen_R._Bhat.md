 This utility argument has been refuted in Mandukya karika by showing
that the comparison is improper just like apples with oranges. The waking
object is as useless to a dreamer in the dream as the dream object is
useless in waking for a waker! You can surely cook using dream vessel in
dream while even the cooked food in waking is useless to satiate dream
hunger, let alone the vessel. The waking gold of even an emperor has no
value to a dreamer experiencing himself as a beggar! Ergo, there is no
difference between the two. The utility argument is also dismissed by the
nailcutter example in the Chandogya 6th chapter mantra.

The pramANatva of waking is also w.r.t. to waking which is equally true of
a dream during the dream.
