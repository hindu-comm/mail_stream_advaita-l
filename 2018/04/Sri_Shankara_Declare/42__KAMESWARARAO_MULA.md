Dear Friends, This thread was really interesting and people have put deeper thoughts to the mind what is happening beyond the sleep. I collected some literature regarding science of dreams from the near by peeth.According to our guru swami maha Raj, Vaisheshika Philisohpy says memory is supposed to be the byproduct of the samskaras of previous life and also the dreams. It say Tatha Swapna i.e the sense organs are not pursuing their objectives and merge into Manas, then it experiences particular objects through those sense organs called 'dreams'. The pathological states of Vata, Pitta & Phelgms causes dreams. The abnormality state of e.g Vata takes you fora sky rise, travels on earth, dreams in jungle animals. The abnormalitites of Bile (Pitta) results in dreams of entry into fire, flames, mountains, electricity .etc. Over Phelgmatic state causes dreams of swimming in sea, bath in rivers, rains, mountaineering in hills. By doing religious & sinful acts one dreams about the experiences of past lives. Religious acts produce dreams of elephant ride, mountain climbing, meeting with kings. The sinful acts causes dreams like oil massages, camel ride, falling in blind wells & Marriage of the self etc.
 Shruti tells about the effects of the dreams and when ever one is engaged in an activity for the fulfillment of a desire and a female perceived in dreams indicates success. The dreams of drishta, shruta, anubhoota, prarthita, kalpita are false. Bhavika dreams are true as per shruti, smriti & puranas. Doshaja are possible as per ayurvedic sastra. The dreams of the mantras are mentioned in 'Swapna Vidya' as it belongs to the order of dakshina murhti. Thus they should be worshipped in the form of the master. 

 During the mantra purashcharana, strange & rare dreams occurs which manifests many aspects of the sadhana. Patanjali yoga sutra says "Swadhyayaadishta devata Samparyogah'. The devotees who are engaged in 'Japa' received the help & vision of the deity, sages, munis and meditation brings out the meaning & effect of the mantra. Japas makes one practically visualize the deity which is being meditated and it happens first in dream.
All the scenes of dreams are because of the Kundalini awakening & they are perceived in dream.

 Namaste,

I would like to paraphrase some words of Acharyaji: seeing waking as a
reality separate from dream is saMsAra-kAraka, while seeing waking as dream
is mokSha-kAraka.

To think of waking as dream while also keeping it separate from dream is
confusion, or just about entertaining a theoretical possibility at best. We
would then be among those very people who "dream of a future" while waking
and let the future saMsAra form up!

astu,
