I reckon from the above example it has been emphasized that ONLY the brahma nishTa is the guru and if he is shrOtreeya then it is an additional advantage.  But mere shrOtreeya ( the person who is familiar with maps, good understanding of guide books, easy and harmless way to reach the destination but not yet been to the top of the mountain)   cannot be called / referred as  a 'real guru' .  But the question is how can we ascertain whether one is brahmanishTa??  Unless we ourselves become brahmanishTa we cannot know the status of brahmanishTa...( saying goes only jnAni can understand another jnAni :-) So, IMO without scratching our head whether a person (who we accepted as 'guru') as brahmanishTa or otherwise, if he is capable enough to eloquently  explain the 'root map' and guide books as per guru-shishya avicchinna parampara, with the sincere mumukshatva and with the unconditional shraddhA in guru / Apta vAkya the sAdhaka  would achieve the summit.  Just sharing my opinion.  

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
