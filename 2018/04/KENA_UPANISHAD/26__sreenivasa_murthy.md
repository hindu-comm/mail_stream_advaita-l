Dear Friends, Please ponder over the following teaching:  
Recognize that whichnever changes. 

That is a universaland time-tested pointer. 

Yes, the mind cannotfind that. 

But whoever said touse the mind?

The real looking does not involve the mind atall. 

You are presentbefore thought appears, as the one to whom thought arises. 

So look into thatwhich is aware of thought. 

Clearly, the mind isnot going to be useful or needed for this. 

How can the mindlook into that which is prior to the mind?

[John Wheeler]

Is this not What mantra 2-4 of Kena Upanishad is revealing?

Is it not the genuine traditional method of teaching of Atmajnana?

Please tell me. 


With respectful namaskars,

Sreenivasa Murthy
