Namaste

Is there any collection of Mangalarati mantras?  Some of the mantras used
in the tradition are:

somo vaa etasya...

hiranyapaatram madhoh.....

saangrahanyenaayajate....

raajaadhiraajaaya prasahya.....


I am looking for a collection of these and any other mantras in one
document.  Any help is appreciated.

Thanks and warm regards
