Happy New Year 2018!Chaturamnya mailing listThe mailing list "Chaturamnaya" has been created for the discussion on Advaita Vedantataught by the four principal Sankara Maths. Please see the list FAQ and Rules below andjoin the list at http://lists.advaita-vedanta.org/cgi-bin/listinfo/chaturamnaya(The FAQ and Rules will be updated every now and then, hence please consult the latest versionavailable in the list archives).Chaturamnaya Mailing List FAQ-----------------------------Q: What are the Chaturamnaya Maths?A: The Chaturamnaya Maths are the Four Maths in the tradition of Adi Sankara located in Indiaat Sringeri (South), Dwaraka (West), Jyotirmath/Badrinath (North) and Puri (East).Q: Why is there a need for a mailing list dedicated to the Chaturamnaya Maths?A: The Chaturamnaya Maths stand out in distinction from the other Advaita institutionsin the following ways:1. The Four Maths are historically the oldest surviving institutions of Advaita teachingin the world.-According to the extant biographies of Adi Sankara such as the Madhaviya Sankara Digvijayam,He is said to have established Maths in "Sringeri and other places".2. The Four Maths trace their lineage of Gurus directly to Adi Sankara.-The Guru-Shishya Parampara is central to the teaching of Advaita Vedanta.3. The Four Maths lead people to follow the path of Dharma.-These Maths have remained free of Ethical or Moral controversies during their entire history.Last but certainly not the least:4. The Dashanami Sannyasins who have propagated Advaita Vedanta to all corners of India (if notthe world) owe allegiance to these Four Maths.-"Saraswati", "Puri" and "Bharati" belong to the Sringeri Math; "Tirtha" and "Asrama" belong tothe Dwaraka Math; "Giri", "Parvata" and "Sagara" belong to the Jyotir Math; "Vana" and "Aranya"belong to the Puri Math.Q: How can I join the Chaturamnaya mailing list?A: One can subscribe to the list from the homepage at:http://lists.advaita-vedanta.org/cgi-bin/listinfo/chaturamnayaThe email address of the list is:chaturamnaya at lists.advaita-vedanta.orgThe archives are at:http://lists.advaita-vedanta.org/archives/chaturamnaya______________________________________________________________________________________Rules of the Chaturamnaya Mailing List--------------------------------------The list has exactly one purpose - to study with reverence the teachings of the Chaturamnaya Maths.The focus of the list will remain firmly on the teachings of the Chaturamnaya Maths, but therewill be no restrictions on the discussion of any topic related to Vedic Dharma - including viewsopposed to the teachings of the Four Maths - provided it is accepted that the AUTHORITY OF THECHATURAMNAYA MATHS ON ANY TOPIC IS FINAL.
