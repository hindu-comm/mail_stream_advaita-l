Tapta Mudra Dharana, etc. criticised by Hemadri

Hemādri is well known for his Dharma śāstra work in four volumes. He has
touched upon a very large number of aspects of conduct by people who wish
to follow the path of Dharma. In the Vol.IV of the work ‘Chaturvarga
Chintamani’, this author has a chapter for the criticism of the practice of
branding one’s body by hot-metal images of religious insignia like the
shankha, chakra, linga, etc.
