Dear Mr. Sri Ram Sapta sati,  Since you wrote once that there is some fire brokened or sombody has thrown some thing (it is the gupta gupta tara, sampradaya yogini vidya) and commented on a Pseudo advaitan which makes me to reply this thread. You may not know the actual reality & powers of a SriGuru and you can never know. Only your SriGuru(If you have) can tel the Truth to you. 

I simply explain in telugu to you that " Hridayam Dravinchina na nadhudu munduku velli venkaku vachhinade kani, na nadhunaku, aa vuddesyam ledu". Adi Bhavagavat Nirnayam

PLEASE UNDERSTAND THE FACT THAT what ever you have written in this thread is all came from 'Kashmiri Shivatism'.
Please don't reply this mail

 Sandilya vipra being from South India may be significant. Srisaila can be
an echo of his nativity.
