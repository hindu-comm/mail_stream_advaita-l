EKATMA YAATRA

The Government of Madhya Pradesh is installing a 108 feet high vigraha of
Shri Adi Shankaracharya at Omkareshwar Gurushthalam of Shankara, the place
where he met Govind Bhagavatpaada on the banks of the Narmada.

The Chief minister of Madhya Pradesh had visited Veliyanad, Kerala to flag
off Ekatma yatra from the birth place at Kaladi of Shri Adi Shankara by bus.

The Vehicle for the Yatra, seen in the picture is sponsored by Chinmaya
mission. The bus carries the life history of Shri Adi Shankara, and his
works. It also carries the Earth from the place of  birth of Shri Adi
Shankara and also from other places.

The vehicle will criscross the entire country before reaching Madhya
Pradesh by January 18, 2018.

The yaatra is blessed by Ubhaya Jagadgurus.
The Picture, taken at Shringeri, shows the Ubhaya Jagadgurus inside the

Om Shri Shankaracharya varyaaya namah!
