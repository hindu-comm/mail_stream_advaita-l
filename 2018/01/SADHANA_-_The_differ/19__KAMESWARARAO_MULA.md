Dear ShaktaBandhu's,                   InContinuationof my earlier e-mail regarding Brahman or Conciousness
Sh. Rama Krishna explains that it is Real and everything else which is its manifestation in different form is equally real. 'Arup' or nothing enters the words of form takes on tangible manifestation.He continues to teach us the fact that 'What dives us away from this pursuance? It is Greed and leads to grabbing.It is the grace of the Master that by serving to the lotus feet, he bestowed the mantra to his disciple swami vivekananda for realisation of his disciple with out expectation any thing in the return.
The great indian Master was nothing but the Thakur/ Yadava Kula bhushan Lord Krishna, veera who can transmits the Kundalini shakti to the needy disciple effortlessly. For his grace & vision to enhance the conciousness of the disciple's subtle mind, what the disciple can give in return is that his physical body and except that the disciple doesn't possess anything with him. It is the Guru Dakshina to the lotus feet.
This is the bondage of the guru-sishya of the karma bhumi which can only happen on this Land into which non can enter in between with the breath remains. It is the bondage of soul's meeting in space at certain point of time.
Finally my conclusion is that                       " If some one gets cheated in life, you are rather lucky because your suffering takes you to the depth towards reaching brahman where as the cheat remains superficial for ever. From the losses you have created the eternal treasures for yourself where as The cheater have already greased the wheels of his downfall.

 Dear Shakta Bhandhu's,                    It is said that there are two paths to Sadhana. The path of Discrimination & the path of Devotion. The first one is Discriminationi i.e Rational, it thinks & reject the things that are impermanent, net, neti, net (Not this) i.e I am not my money, I am not my body, I am not my mind....until by process of elimination, the aspirant/disciple comes to a permanent & therefore the reality exists. The path of Knowledge has a concept of the ultimate Ideal from the beginning and goes forward consciously towards it.        TheDevotion on the other hand travels forwards with FAITH, Ignorant of where he will ultimately arrive. HE ACCEPTS ALL: " YOU ARE THIS and That & also THIS. There by reminding himself that Brahman exits in all things. He does not worship the thing, but realitywithin the thing.
This is the Route adopted by the great master 'RAMAKRISHNA PARAMAHAMSA'
A literal man needing to experience everything himself, he was finding his own way, blundering through the dense undergrowth of his mind, the high altitude of his soul with unflinching faith & intense yearning he prayed to the mother of the universe for the self - realisation, surrounding himself totally to her wishes. He declares finally that " As many faiths with so many Paths".
Quite often, Ramakrishna was in his state of utter desperation , Cried out to the Mother & said:Yet another day passed in the TIME, Mother: what is lifeworth if I cannot see you??I have suffered so long. Are you just a chunk of Stone? Some times I doubt you exists.Am I a fool to believe there exists a Consciousness of which this stone is only a representation?Mother you shown yourself to otherdevotees. Why won't you show yourself to me? or IS THERE ANY DIVINE CONCIOUSNESS EXSISTS ALWAYS WITH IN ME???
Why the mother won't grant our prayers? I have been praying to you mother for quite some time.I can't go or leave this physical body without a glimpse of you Mother, I would rather die.
Finally , ' A life history ofRamakrishna Says' that The mother wallks toRamakrishna inecasty and said that my child, I am please with you, you are my Kid, let me know your wish as I amplease to grant the Boons. Ibelieve that there is nothing harm to the Land with your presence so you are my son only, come on, Let us Pray together for the welfare of Mankind.
