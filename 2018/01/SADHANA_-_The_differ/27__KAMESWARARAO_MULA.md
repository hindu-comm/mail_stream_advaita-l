Dear Sir, Although I have expressed my views on 'Guru', but i feel that I may be too small to comment on that as I am just beginner in the path of self-realization.
As Sh. Ryan Ji Says that " गुरु refers to one who has realized the Truth and knows (innately)अहम् ब्रह्मास्मि" 
But What I want to understand that what makes a Guru to transfer the Knowledge to the needy disciple? (this is not applicable to acharya/teacher)
Any learned members or seniors of the list, please put your views so that we can understand our selves better.
What is the driving force by which 'Guru' transmits his shakti or siddhi /knowledge to the Sishya? how the disciple is his knowledge son?
What makes do this? and knowing this is the objective of my life

Today I exists on this earth and could able to stand on my feet due to the grace of my Guru only as he is immortal on this karma bhumi.

  Na Guror-adhikam tattvam na Guror-adhikam tapah Tattva-gyanat-param nasti tasmai Shri Gurave Namah
 Man-naathah Shri Jagan-nathah Mat-guru-shri jagad-guruhu Mad-atma sarva-bhutatma tasmai Shri Gurave Namah

 Namaste Sri Belavadi
In my understanding, the termगुरु refers to one who has realised the Truth and knows (innately)अहम् ब्रह्मास्मि.Manu says something about this as being the difference between anआचर्य and a गुरु. (I shall have to find the reference if needed.)The guru knows who he is and instructs the student as to how the student may reach the same realisation.
As such, the guru IS the Absolute.So I would say that it is quite redundant to say "immortal guru" since the guru must be immortal in the first place for the title to be used.
Of course, this is within व्यवहार.In the final verse ofतत्त्वोपदेष (ascribed to aadi shankara) statesनाद्वैतं गुरुणा सह - There is no advaita between the guru (and the student).The guru exists while in ignorance and the seeker needs assistance to dispel the ignorance.Once ignorance is dispelled, the truth that only Brahman exists is known, and distinction of teacher/student falls away.
Yours in TruthRyan
