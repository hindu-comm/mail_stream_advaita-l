Namaste,

You can enter search string followed by site:
https://lists.advaita-vedanta.org/archives/advaita-l/

e.g. ratnaprabha site:https://lists.advaita-vedanta.org/archives/advaita-l/

Now, it will strictly search within
https://lists.advaita-vedanta.org/archives/advaita-l/

If you wish to search website, enter search string followed by site:
https://lists.advaita-vedanta.org/

If your search string has more than one word and you need to have a
particular word enter word inbetween double quotes

e.g. "madhusudan" saraswati "gita" bhashya site:
https://lists.advaita-vedanta.org/archives/advaita-l/
