Namaste
In the well-known passage
 न धर्मजिज्ञासायामिव श्रुत्यादय एव प्रमाणं ब्रह्मजिज्ञासायाम् । किन्तु
श्रुत्यादयोऽनुभवादयश्चयथासम्भवमिह प्रमाणम् ,
अनुभवावसानत्वाद्भूतवस्तुविषयत्वाच्च ब्रह्मज्ञानस्य
(Unlike in the case of dharmajiGYAsA dealing with svargaloka etc., here in
the case of enquiry in to brahman, it's not as if shruti etc., alone are
the pramANas. In fact, not only shruti etc., but anubhava etc., are also
wherever applicable pramANam. Because it all culminates in anubhava (dRShTa
phalaM) and is dealing with a pre-existing Reality, not something to to be
produced, reached etc.)

There was an article on the above topic by Rama ji. Is a link to that
document available ? Any help is appreciated .

Also is there any option to search the advaita archives. I seem to have
missed seeing any such option .

Thank you
Om
Raghav
