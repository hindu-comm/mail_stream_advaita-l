Dear Sri Vedavids,


-prajnanam brahma/Brahman is consciousness  

-prajnaghana brahma/Brahman is a mass of consciousness




The first is a Mahavakya from AitareyaU 3.1.3

Can anyone tell me where prajnaghana brahma appears?


and what, if anything, is the difference between the two?


much appreciate, mcc
