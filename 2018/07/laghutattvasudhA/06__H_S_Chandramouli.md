Palm-leaf; 9 lines per folio.

Manuscript consists of two texts, both by Svayamprakāśa Yati: 1)
Haritattvamuktāvalī, a commentary on Śaṅkara's Haristuti (or
Harim-īḍe-stotra); 2) Rasābhivyañjikā, a commentary on Lakṣmīdhara's
Advaitamakaranda.

Svayamprakāśa Yati was a pupil of Kaivalyānanda Yogīndra.

Text of the Haritattvamuktāvalī begins: Śaṃkaraṃ Śaṃkarācāryyaṃ Keśavaṃ
Bādarāyaṇaṃ | sūtrabhāṣyakṛtau vande bhagavantau punaḥpunaḥ |

sadīśvarābhāvam malinasatvapradhānāvidyopādhikaṃ sajjīvabhāvañ ca jagan
māyābhāsena jīveśau karoti etc.

It ends: iti

Text of the Rasābhivyañjikā begins: nityan nirantarānandacitghnaṃ brahma

the last (29th) chapter (f.24b): Lakṣmīdhara iti granthakarttur nāma sa
cāsau kavis … etc. Further on: advaitamakarandasya rasābhivyañjakā kṛtā |
