Svayamaprakasha yati also known as Svayamaprakasha Yogindra was a prolific
commentator on Advaitic works who flourished around the beginning of the
17th century.  He was the shishya of Kaivalyananda Yogindra.

Not only the Dakshinamurti stotra, he has also commented on a number of
prakaranas of Shankaracharya: ekashloki, atmanatmaviveka, mohamudgara
(bhaja govindam.  This one is notable because the order and number of the
verses diverges markedly from the standard text), and haristuti.

  He has also commented on other advaita acharyas: for
instance a tika on Vachaspati Mishras Bhamati on Shankaracharyas
brahmasutrabhashya and a tika on advaitamakaranda of Lakshmidhara Kavi.
