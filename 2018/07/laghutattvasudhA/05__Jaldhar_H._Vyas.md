The Dakshinamurti Matha publications of Shankaracharyas prakaranas include 
a number of them.  I read about the mohamudgara tika in "Hymns of Sankara" 
by T.M.P. Mahadevan. His English translation was based on SY's tika but he 
did not provide the Sanskrit text.  I have been unable to find it 
elsewhere.  The Advaitamakaranda tika was published by the Sampurnananda 
Sanskrit Vishvavidyalaya, Kashi in 1992.
