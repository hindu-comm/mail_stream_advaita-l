There are several different recensions of the Markandeya Purana but in the 
one I have (Nag Publishers reprint of Nirnaya Sagar edition of the 
Markandeya Mahapurana,) the stories of King Kuvalayashva and his Queen 
Madalasa are in adhyayas 18-23.

The particular shlokas Shri Subrahmanian cites are approximately shlokas 
9b - 16a in the 23rd adhyaya but there are several differences in the 
patha in this edition from what he has given.
