Hi All,

The below compilation is made by Mahaperiyava on his yatra to Kasi.

Wonderful Ashtakam. Read and Enjoy.

mah ātīrtharājasya   tīré   vibhāntam
mahābhūtirūpam   mahātmaikavédyaṃ
mahāsiddhipūrāpradānaikadakṣam
bhajāmaiva   siddhé śwaram   siddhaśambhuṃ

Let  us  worship  Siddheshwara,  the  One  who  shines  in  the  banks  of
Mahatirtha,  the
One  who  personifies  prosperity,  the  One  who  is  known  only  by
great  scholars,  the
One  who  is  capable  of  bestowing  great  siddhis,  and  the  One  who
bestows  all
success  in  us.

manojastvadakṣyagni   bhasmāva śéshaḥ
madāndha śca  dakṣo  gataśśocyabhāvaṃ
manojāśca   tadakṣyagnitānto   madāndhaḥ
bhajé   nirmadatvāya   siddhéśwaram   tvāṃ

Manmata  was  burnt  to  ashes  by  the  fire  from  your  (third)  eye;
Daksha,  who  was
blinded  by  his  pride,  was  afflicted  by  sorrow.  As  Manmata  was
burnt,  people  are
also  afflicted  by  the  evil  of  pride.   I  worship  Siddheshwara  to
 free  us  from  evil  of
pride.

iyam   cāpi   ga ṅgā   nibaddhā   kapardé
madāḍh yā   yatassa   ka ṇakṣīrakalpa ṃ
vis ṛsh ṭā   jagatpāpanāśāya   yéna
svayamsiddha   ­  siddhéśwaram   cintayainaṃ

Ganga,  who  was  overcome  by  pride,  was  bound  to  your  matted  hair
as  a  small
drop  of  water.  O  mind!  Meditate  on  Siddheshwara,  who  by  Himself
lets  out  the
Ganga  from  His  braid,  for  the  sake  of  destroying  the  sins  of
all  people  in  this
world.

na   té(a)nto   na   cādirhari ḥ   so(a)pi   dhātā
var āho   bhavann ūrdhva   hams ībhavam śca
tadā   te  hi   sākṣyam   bhajetām   tameva
mahāliṅgarūpeṇa   siddheśwaram   tvāṃ

Taking  the  forms  of  a  boar  and  a  swan  to  behold  your  feet  and
head,  Hari  (Lord
Vishnu)  and  Lord  Brahma  could  not  succeed  and  attained  sakshi
bhava.  I  worship
such  a  Siddeshwara  who  is  in  the  form  of  Mahalinga.

śivo(a)yam   pradéśo   mahān   madhyadéśa:
śiva    jāhnavī    nityasiddhapravāhā
śivastvam   śivam   nityasiddham   dadhānaḥ
śivo   naḥ   sadādéva   siddhéśwara    syāḥ

This  central  region  (Madhya  Pradesh)  is  an  auspicious  place.  Here
the  auspicious
Ganga  flows  perennially.  O  Siddheshwara,  may  you  be  auspiciousness
within  us
and  also  be  bestower  of  auspiciousness  unto  us.

padābjé(a)dvidīyé   svakīyākṣi  ­  padmam
pūrā   bhūsha ṇatvéna   nārāya ṇo(a)dāt
itīdam   purāv ṛttamadyātra   satyam
badaryo   harissādhu   siddhé śwara   adāt

It  is  said  that  Sriman  Narayana  once  offered  His  Lotus  Eye  onto
your  Lotus  Feet.
O  Siddheshwara!  That  has  come  true  now,  as  the  Hari  in  Badari
has  offered  it  to
you.

kapardāt   dvitīyāt   vis ṛsh ṭā(a)pi   ga ṅgā
punassévitum   tvāmaho   baddhavāñ chā
cakāśé (a)dvitīyé(a)ti   bhārapravāhā
nijāmbho(a)bhishékāya   siddhéśwarāgāt

Ganga,  who  was  released  from  your  matted  hair  yearned  to  worship
you  again.
She  flows  with  great  force  to  perform  abhishekam  for  you,  O
Siddheshwara!

na  matto(a)smyaham    cét   na   mattosi   bhinna:
namatto śitastvam   namatto ṣ adātā
na  matto(a)sibhinnastvam  ­   ityaikyato ṣ am
na   madbhyaḥ   pradéhīha   siddhéśwara   tvaṃ

Even  if  I  am  free  from  arrogance,  I  realize  you  are  not
different  from  me!  You  are
easily  pleased  and  you  are  the  giver  of  happiness.  O
Siddheshwara,  bestow  the
happiness  of  oneness  unto  us,  through  the  discovery  "There  is
none  other  than
me  ­  only  oneness".

iti prayāgasiddhéśa bhakti bhṛjjanatā hṛdi
ślokāṣṭakamidam puṇyam nityam vardhayatām śubhaṃ

May  this  auspicious  eight   shlokas  continue  to  grow  in  the
hearts  of  people  who
are  devoted  to  Siddheshwara,  and  bless  them  with  everlasting
auspiciousness.
