Dear Friends,

A book consisting of 14 selected hymns (stotra-s such as the
GovindashTakam, AchyutashTakam, KrishnashTakam...) of Shankaracharya with
verses in Devanagari, word-to-word meaning in English and a short four-line
translation of each verse has been prepared for publishing.

Help is required in the final phase of checking the prepared material for
any kind of errors. The plan is to allot some 25 verses to each volunteer
and  have them returned in about a week's time.

Those interested must have a basic knowledge of Sanskrit, and of course,
English. Please contact me offline to take this forward. Your participation
will be gratefully acknowledged.

Thanks and warm regards
subrahmanian.v
