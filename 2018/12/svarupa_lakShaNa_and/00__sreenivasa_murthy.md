 Dear friends, Is it not much more profittable and beneficial 
 if one cognizes or realizes his own nijasvarupalakShaNa 
before entering into discussions about svarUpalakshana 
and tatasthalakshana of brahman who is unknown? 
How do the readers feel about it?With respectful namaskars,Sreenivasa Murthy.
