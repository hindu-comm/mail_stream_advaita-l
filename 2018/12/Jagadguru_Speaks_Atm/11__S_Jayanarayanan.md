 (Around the beginning of the month, a nugget of Wisdom from the Jagadguru may be posted
on the Chaturamnaya list : http://lists.advaita-vedanta.org/cgi-bin/listinfo/chaturamnaya )

Some people desire moksha even from childhood. Staying in
solitude, away from the crowd, eating sattvik food alone, and reading
books on Vedanta come naturally to them. Gradually, they get inclined
to dhyana also. This can be explained by the accrual of merits (punya)
earned over several births.

However, while indulging in worldly matters due to colossal
ignorance of previous births, the conception of the Self in the body, etc.,
comes up in a moment again and again as also the conception of the
reality of the universe.

But this misleading impression will fade away following their
cultivation of single-minded dhyana.

Therefore, the sadhaks should always contemplate on the Self as
distinct from the body and similarly on the unreality of the world,
constantly.

If they keep this thought deeply imprinted on the mind, they can
remain calm, unperturbed and untainted even when engrossed in
mundane matters.
