The idea behind the analogy is: the pot, with water, is kept in the open
and the reflection of sky with clouds and stars is captured in it. Since
there is the similar word 'AkAsha' for both space and the sky, the idea of
the 'sky-akasha, attributed' hiding the pot-akasha is forceful. There is no
need to include trees, etc. in the analogy.
