Couple of websites have this to say:http://pastimespaceadvaitavedanta.blogspot.com/2013/12/five-sheaths-and-atman.html
"Disciple: What is the relation between the Kosha and the Atman?Guru: Anyonya-Adhyasa.Disciple: What is Anyonya-Adhyasa?Guru: Anyonya-Adhyasa is mutual superimposition. The attributes of the five sheaths are superimposed on the Atman.The attributes of the sheaths, e.g., change pain, etc., are falsely attributed to the pure soul or the Atman.The attributes of the Pure Atman such as Existence, Knowledge, Bliss, Purity, Consciousness are transferred tothe five sheaths."http://saipadarenu.blogspot.com/2009/03/chapters-sixteen-and-seventeen.html
"The attributes of the mind, senses, Prana and body are transferred to the pure Atman and the attributes of Atmanare transferred to the mind and the body. This is called mutual super imposition (Anyonya Adhyasa). Throughthis superimposition, the insentient mind seems to be intelligent, and the impure and insentient body ismistaken for the pure and sentient atman. "
