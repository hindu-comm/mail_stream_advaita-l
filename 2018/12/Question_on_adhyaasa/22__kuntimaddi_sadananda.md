Venkatraghavanji - PraNAms.
Yes to what you mentioned. That is also what I had implied when I understood as that' I am' is adhishtaanamfor 'this', 'this' forms a locus for the I am to experience 'triads'. This is also I think is the implication of the slokamana eva manushyaanamkaaraNam bandha moksha yoH.The MI forms the locus or adhishtaanam for jeeva-hood or notion that I am this.
That is how I understood from yours and Chandramouli's posts.

 Namaste,
A side question to consider in relation to anyonyAdhyAsa -

If in the conception of adhyAsa, the adhyasta is mithyA and adhiShThAna is
satya, the non-self and its attributes can be superimposed on the self,
because the latter is real and can be the adhiShThAna for the adhyAsa.
However, anyonyAdhyAsa says that the nature of the self is superimposed on
the non-self too. How can this be true though? How can the non-self, which
is mithyA, be the adhiShThAna for the self's nature, which is real?

Therefore, is the term anyonyAdhyAsa not a mutual superimposition, but
merely a confusion of one for the other, brought about by the one
superimposition of the non-self on the self?

Thanks
Venkatraghavan
