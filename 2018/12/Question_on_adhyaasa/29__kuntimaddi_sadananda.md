Chandramouliji - PraNAms and thanks for your detailed response.
Kutastha normally implies substantive that does not undergo change. As I applied to jeeva my understanding it is like that part of total consciousness that is illumining the local MI - like that part of sunlight that is falling on the moon before reflection. It is what we normally refer as witnessing consciousness which is same of OC (original consciousness in Swami Paramarthanandaji's Nomenclature). Jiiva comes after reflection (with chit and chidaabhaasa). Kutastha should not be affected by what happens at BMI - hence anyonya adhyaasa seems to little confusing to me.Kutastha is covered is OK due to ignorance is OK - what is the other coverage for anyonya.

Words little bit confusing to me.

 Pranams Sri Sadananda Ji,

Reg << We are doing the Panchadasi Ch. 6 -Chitadeepa prakaraNa.In that,
there is a discussion adhyaasa using ghaTaakaasa, jalaakaasha, meghaakaasha
and mahaakaasha in relation to kuuTashta, brahman, jeeva and Iswara. How do
you explain these analogies and more importantly the anyonya adhyaasa here?
Panchadasi- Ch. 6 – Sloka24 says:
Jalavyomnaa ghaTaakaaShO yathaa sarvastirohitaH|

Tathaa jeevena kuuTasthaH saH anyOnya adhyaasa uchyate||

yathaa, Jalavyomnaa ghaTaakaaShaH, sarvaH tirOhitaH; tathaa jeevena
kuuTasthaH, saH anyonya adhyaasaH
It says, anyonya adhhaasa – what is the mutual superimposition here? >>,

My understanding.

Definitions

1.   kUtastha---- Consciousness limited by the antahkarana or
mind/intellect

2. jIva----Consciousness limited by antahkaraNa or mind/intellect +
antahkaraNa or mind/intellect including vAsanAs/samskArAs + reflection of
Consciousness in antahkaraNa or mind/intellect.

3. Isvara------mAyA + Consciousness limited by mAyA + reflection of
Consciousness in mAyA

4. Brahman------Consciousness

5. ghtAkAsha-----space limited by a pot filled with water

6. jalAkAsha------ghatAkAsha + water in the jar + reflection of the space
along with trees, creepers, stars etc

7. mEghAkAsha------clouds + space occupied by the clouds + reflection of
the vast universal space in the clouds

8. mahAkAsha-------Vast Universal Space

Equivalences or analogy.

1.   Brahman--------mahAkAsha

2.   Isvara-------------mEghAkAsha

3.   Kutastha---------ghatAkAsha

4.   jIva-----------------jalAkAsha

anyOnyadhyAsa or mutual superimposition is as follows.

Just as the jalAkAsha with the reflected trees/creepers/stars veils the
ghatAkAsha which is its adhisthAna completely and prevent its cognition,
the jIva or mind/intellect with its vAsanAs/samskArAs completely obscures
the kUtastha which is its adhisthAna and prevents its cognition. The
sentience which belongs to Consciousness is transferred and appears to
belong to jIva. Whereas attributes like pain and pleasure, likes and
dislikes etc which really belong to the insentient mind/intellect are
transferred and appear to belong to the sentient entity which is the
kUtastha.

Pranams and Regards
