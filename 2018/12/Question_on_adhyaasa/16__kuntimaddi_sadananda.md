Chandramouliji and Venkatraghavanji, PraNAms
Thanks for the clarification of the anyonya adhyaasa.
As I understand from these posts:
In essence, Kutastha remains unaffected while 'I am' part is coming from it and 'this' part is coming from enlivened MI. The mixture is the jiiva with one leg on I am and the other leg on this and therefore gets confused. Viveka perhapsto separate cognitively the two and keep them separated unless needed for vyavahaara. The knower in the triad may be still this mixture while the Knower in the ahambrahmaasmi is the leaving the 'this' part and claiming the I am part as full and complete.
Appreciate any corrections.
Hari Om!Sadananda

 Pranams Sri Sadananda Ji,

The following might also be helpful in understanding the Panchadashi verse
under reference.

While analyzing the mahAvAkya “ tatvamasi “, two possibilities are
considered for understanding the meaning of “ tvam “. One extends upto
chidAbhAsa ( RC ) while the second extends upto kUtastha ( OC ). When
chidAbhAsa ( RC ) is considered as the meaning of “ tvam “, the
sAmAnAdhikaranya relevant is bAdhasAmAnAdhikaranya. When the meaning of “
tvam “ is considered to be kUtastha ( OC ), the sAmAnAdhikaranya relevant
is mukhyasAmAnAdhikaranya. In the Panchadashi verse under reference, it is
the latter which is considered while stating “ anyOnyadhyAsa “.

Hope this will be of some help in understanding the Panchadashi verse.

Pranams and Regards
