Venkatraghavanji - PraNAms

Thanks for the post.

Just for clarification.

While the existence forms adhishTaanamfor the world and thus they are together the removal of ignorance, therefore. involves cognitively recognizing the pure existence without attributes while seeing the world. It is like recognizing the sunlight while looking at the moon and its light. Without the presence of the moon, the sunlight cannot be recognized.

In addition, this recognition or realization can only be done with the mind enlivened by chidaabhaasa cognitively using vRitti jnaanam although there is no phala vyaapti since it is aparoxa jnanaam.

Hari Om!

Therefore, the cognition that is capable of removing that

ignorance (and thus samsAra) can only have brahman as its object, and not

ignorance or its products. Any cognition of the existence of the world has

both existence and the world (ie it has both brahman and the world, a

product of ignorance) as its object, and therefore, such a cognition cannot

remove the ignorance which is the cause of samsAra.
