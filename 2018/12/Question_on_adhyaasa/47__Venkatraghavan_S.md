Namaste Bhaskar ji,
What I meant was that our initial conception of the world is real. Reality
is viewed as an adjective, an attribute "of" the world.

Later after studying vedAnta under a guru as prescribed, one realises that
it is the one existence which appears as the world. There is existence and
its appearance, the world.

When existence is 'separated' = cognitively viewed independently of
appearance, we understand that there is no appearance at all. All we had
all along was existence alone.

This separation of Atma from anAtma is the akhandAkAra vritti, which by
focusing on Brahman alone and nothing else, removes the ignorance which has
Brahman alone and nothing else as its object.

Regards,
Venkatraghavan
