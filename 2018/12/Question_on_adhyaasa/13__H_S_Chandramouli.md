Pranams Sri Sadananda Ji,

Reg  << We are doing the Panchadasi Ch. 6 -Chitadeepa prakaraNa.In that,
there is a discussion adhyaasa using ghaTaakaasa, jalaakaasha, meghaakaasha
and mahaakaasha in relation to kuuTashta, brahman, jeeva and Iswara. How do
you explain these analogies and more importantly the anyonya adhyaasa here?
Panchadasi- Ch. 6 – Sloka24 says:
Jalavyomnaa ghaTaakaaShO yathaa sarvastirohitaH|

Tathaa jeevena kuuTasthaH saH anyOnya adhyaasa uchyate||

yathaa, Jalavyomnaa ghaTaakaaShaH, sarvaH tirOhitaH; tathaa jeevena
kuuTasthaH, saH anyonya adhyaasaH
It says, anyonya adhhaasa – what is the mutual superimposition here? >>,

My understanding.

Definitions

1.       kUtastha----  Consciousness  limited by the antahkarana or
mind/intellect

 2. jIva----Consciousness limited by antahkaraNa or mind/intellect +
antahkaraNa or mind/intellect including vAsanAs/samskArAs  + reflection of
Consciousness in antahkaraNa or mind/intellect.

3. Isvara------mAyA + Consciousness limited by mAyA + reflection of
Consciousness in mAyA

4. Brahman------Consciousness

 5. ghtAkAsha-----space limited by a pot filled with water

6. jalAkAsha------ghatAkAsha + water in the jar + reflection of the space
along with trees, creepers, stars etc

7. mEghAkAsha------clouds  + space occupied by the clouds + reflection of
the vast universal space in the clouds

8. mahAkAsha-------Vast Universal Space

Equivalences or analogy.

1.       Brahman--------mahAkAsha

2.       Isvara-------------mEghAkAsha

3.       Kutastha---------ghatAkAsha

4.       jIva-----------------jalAkAsha

anyOnyadhyAsa or mutual superimposition is as follows.

Just as the jalAkAsha with the reflected trees/creepers/stars  veils the
ghatAkAsha  which is its adhisthAna completely and prevent its cognition,
the jIva or mind/intellect  with its vAsanAs/samskArAs  completely obscures
 the kUtastha which is its adhisthAna  and prevents its cognition. The
 sentience  which belongs to Consciousness is transferred and appears to
belong to jIva. Whereas  attributes like pain and pleasure, likes and
dislikes etc which really belong to the insentient mind/intellect are
transferred and appear to belong to the sentient entity which is the
kUtastha.

Pranams and Regards
