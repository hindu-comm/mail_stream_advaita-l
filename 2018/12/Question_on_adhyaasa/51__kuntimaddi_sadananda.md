Chandramouliji - PraNAms
Yes, what you said is right. It is the notion of reality to dualityis destroyed, and duality now is recognized as mithyaa, sat asat valakshanam. The duality is still perceived as long as BMI is there for a jnaaniand transactions will go on as before -it becomes aatmakreeda. It is not the destruction of duality, and this aspect was emphasized in sloka 13, Ch. 6 of Panchadasi.
jnaanma, ajnaanam, realization, all nine yards are all within vyavahaara only.
The misconceptions are in the mind and jnaanamwhich is in the form of vRitti only destroys the avidyaas they are opposite to each other. Hence it is said vRitti vyaaptiis there but what is being pointed as the truth by that jnaana vRitti is akhandam- pure Brahman. Hence the jnaana vRitti is called as akhandaakara vRitti that was discussed sometime back and that is what Venkatraghavan is reminding me also.
Sloka 31 of Ch. 6 of Panchadasi says KuTasthachaitanyamis not opposed to avidya. Only vivekais opposed to avidya.

 When Brahman is Realized as Atman, the Reality thus far assigned to the world is automatically destroyed.

Sorry for the interjection. I am a little perplexed and feelperhaps I am missing something. Is it being suggested that avidyA ( Ignorance )can be removed by reference to the external world, without reference to theAtman ?? As far as I know, as per sidhanta, avidyA can be destroyed and BrahmanRealized ONLY as Atman and not in any other way. Please clarify. 

Pranams and Regards
