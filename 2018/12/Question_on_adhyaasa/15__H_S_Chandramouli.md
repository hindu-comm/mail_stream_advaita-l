Pranams Sri Sadananda Ji,

The following might also be helpful in understanding the Panchadashi verse
under reference.

While analyzing the mahAvAkya “ tatvamasi “, two possibilities are
considered for understanding the meaning of “ tvam “. One extends upto
chidAbhAsa ( RC ) while the second extends upto kUtastha ( OC ). When
chidAbhAsa ( RC ) is considered as the meaning of “ tvam “, the
sAmAnAdhikaranya relevant is bAdhasAmAnAdhikaranya. When the meaning of “
tvam “ is considered to be kUtastha ( OC ), the sAmAnAdhikaranya relevant
is mukhyasAmAnAdhikaranya. In the Panchadashi verse under reference, it is
the latter which is considered while stating “ anyOnyadhyAsa “.

Hope this will be of some help in understanding the Panchadashi verse.

Pranams and Regards
