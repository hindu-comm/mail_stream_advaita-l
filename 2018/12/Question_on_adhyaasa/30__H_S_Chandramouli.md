The Philosophy of the Panchadasi

Pranams Sri Sadananda Ji,

I agree with what you have mentioned concerning the definitions of kUtastha
and  ChidAbhAsa.  It is the kUtastha ( OC ) which illumines both MI and the
chidAbhAsa (RC) .  The complete understanding  of all experiences is of the
form

<< I know I am having pain >>.

In this the second I refers to the chidAbhAsa while the first one refers to
kUtastha. While it is the MI which undergoes the pain, the experience is
transferred to chidAbhAsa ( RC ) which is the reflection of kUtastha in MI
( in this version ).  It is this combination of MI and RC which is referred
to by “ I “ in the part of the statement  << I am having pain >>. This is
one adhyAsa ( sentience of kUtastha superimposed on MI via reflection ).
However the final form of the experience includes the first “ I “ as well
which is the real Sentient entity  kUtastha. In this final form of the
experience, the MI with chidAbhAsa ( RC )  along with the “ experience “
 is superimposed on the kUtastha . This is the second and reverse adhyAsa.

This is the anyOnyadhyAsa that is spoken of in Panchadashi. This is also
referred to as anyOnyadhyAsa between  jIva and kUtastha.  Since this is
adhyAsa  only, there is no consequential change in kUtastha.

I hope I have clarified the issue.

Pranams and Regards
