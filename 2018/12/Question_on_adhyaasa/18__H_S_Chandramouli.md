I had pointed out the same problem quie sometime back. The problem has
started ever since Google changed their system. I have checked with Google
Help also. The problem has been reported by several persons. All griup mail
participants seem to be facing the issue often.

The problem has not been resolved even as on date by Google. I continue to
get posts much later than they were posted.
