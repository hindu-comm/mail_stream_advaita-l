 Dear Sri Venkataraghavan,
 You write : " Perhaps the discerning one should focus their attention on that reality and cast aside everything else."
Sri Shankara in his commentary to Shloka 18-55 of Bhagavad Gita writes :
(a) svAtmAnuBavaniScayarUpENa yat avasthAnaM sA parAjnAnaniShThA ityucyate ||
(b) pratyagAtmAvikriyasvarUpaniShThatvAcca mOkShasya. ||
 This is what happens and culminates in when one focuses his attention on that reality. So a sincere mumukShu should cast aside everything else. The methodology for this has been shown ,in the very direct manner, in the mantras 2-1-3 & 2-1-4 9f Kathopanishad , mantra 2-4 0f Kena Upanishad and commentary of Sri Shankara to these mantras.

I thank you for the excellent reply which in a very pointed way shows what a mumukShu has to do in order to be an Atmavit.

 The same thing which pervades silence, pervades discussion also. Perhaps the discerning one should focus their attention on that reality and cast aside everything else.
Kind regards,Venkatraghavan
