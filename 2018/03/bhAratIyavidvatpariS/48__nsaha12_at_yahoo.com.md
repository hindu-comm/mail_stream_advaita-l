Dear List,
Namaste!
My heart-felt condolences to the bereaved family. I had the occasion to listen to him in the Shastra-sabha organised by him in Chennai, in the seminars organised by the Department of Philosophy, University of Madras; and above all, I'd had the opportunity to attend his one-to-one class at his home in Chennai on Madhusudana Sarasvati's Gita commentary.
My humble prostration to him.


Sincerely yours,N.Saha
