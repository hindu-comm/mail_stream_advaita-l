Subject: {भारतीयविद्वत्परिषत्} Trying to know the meaning...धूमार्थो
वह्निः....'
To: BHARATIYA VIDVAT <bvparishat at googlegroups.com>


In the gloss to the Ratnaprabha commentary (to the Brahmasutra bhashya of
Shankara), the Purnanandiya says:

अन्यार्थमपि देवतानुस्मरणं स्वभावादेव विघ्नोपप्लवं दहति धूमार्थो
वह्निस्तृणादिकमिवेति प्रस्तिद्धत्वात् |

I am unable to understand the analogy fully. Any help in clarifying is
welcome. Is fire ignited for the sake of generating smoke? Or is he hinting
at any hookah type smoking habit where the tobacco shred/powder is burnt in
the process?

Thanks and regards
