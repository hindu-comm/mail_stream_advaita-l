Namaste,
"in this regards is Veda is changing from something to something? "

No, the veda does not change - Its status from the viewpoint of the jnAni
changes.

In general, the pramANatva of any pramANa is always only from the
perspective of the knower. If I tell you the earth is round, that is not a
pramANa for you because you already know it, but it is a pramANa for
someone who thinks the world is flat. So the same sentence is a pramANa for
someone and not pramANa for someone else. anadhigatatvam, revealing a
hitherto unknown knowledge is one of the tests for pramANatva.

For the jnAni, who knows everything by knowing that one thing, Brahman,
there is nothing else to know. For him, the veda ceases to be veda.

Regards,
Venkatraghavan

Namaste.
 in addition to this, it is also discussed sruti, it is a praman, is just
informative, i.e. it only reveals brahman-atman which is already there, but
which remains concealed and unknown due to avidya. it means that the
work of Sruti as a pramana is needed only so long as Brahman -atman is not
known, and once it is known there is no need for sruti.  as I asked the
above questions if after reveals the nature of atman through the help of
sruti then there is no need of it. if so another sentence its saying the
Veda is no more Veda that means what? Has Veda changed its nature or the
essence? yeah for the common or ignorant of knowing the true nature of the
self, then realized the Veda is not simple Veda something else. I used the
word "change " particularly due to the change of human nature as   Durga
Prasad sir discussed Kosa, from this as I understood as the human being
understand I am not this I am not this I am not food-sheath, not other 4
also and finally realized I am none-other than the supreme-consciousness as
Brahman, is it like this? in this regards is Veda is changing from
something to something? this is my doubt? I am really sorry I am a learner
stage now. if there is any type of over crossed extremely sorry.

 Regards
