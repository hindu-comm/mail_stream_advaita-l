You seems to take  anadhigattvaM  independently than  abAdhittavaM is
saying what you said above.

Per vEdAntapAribASha,

tatra smR^itivyaavR^itaM pramaatvaM
 anadhigataabaadhitaarthavishhayaka-jnaanatvaM

anadhigattvaM  "and" abAdhittavaM is the definition of pramANa.

Otherwise, if I were to utter "world is triangle", as per you it is pramANa
for someone who does not know so!

Also, if the pramANya of a pramANa is so dependent on knower's knowledge
(or lack there of), then you are literately refuting the doctrine of
"pramANya-svathastva", which incidentally accepted by Advaita!
