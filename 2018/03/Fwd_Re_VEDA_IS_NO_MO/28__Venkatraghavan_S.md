That is a very interesting parallel, I had not considered it. Reading the
bhAShya of BSB 2.2.28 today, I found a line there which echoes the
arguments raised in the advaita siddhi. The bhAShyakAra says: अपि च घटज्ञानं
 पटज्ञानमिति विशेषणयोरेव घटपटयोर्भेदः, न विशेष्यस्य ज्ञानस्य — यथा शुक्लो
गौः कृष्णो गौरिति शौक्ल्यकार्ष्ण्ययोरेव भेदः, न गोत्वस्य । That is, the
differentiation between ghaTa jnAna and paTa jnAna, is not on account of
the jnAna, but on account of the artha. ShankarAchArya goes on to call
these as visheShaNa, qualifiers of the jnAna which is the visheShya. Here
differentiation (vyAvaritti) is the outcome that is sought, and that is on
account of the objects.

Yes, will do soon.
