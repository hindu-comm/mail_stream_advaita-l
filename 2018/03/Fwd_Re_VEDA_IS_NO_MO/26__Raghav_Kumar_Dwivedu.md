Yes artha, the dream object is also required. Otherwise within a dream if I
see the photograph of a tiger in a dream book, the vyAghra jnAna does
indeed happen in the dream antahkaraNa when I see the dream photo of a
tiger. But this is not enough to wake us up. The dream artha viewed as real
within the dream is essential to wake us up. So artha-avacchinna jnAnam
alone works.
