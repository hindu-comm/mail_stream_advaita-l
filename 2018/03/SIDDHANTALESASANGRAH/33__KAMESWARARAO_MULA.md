Dear Sir, Praveen Ji, my conversation/posting is again related to the 'Prarabda Karma' which remained in some one's life. 
IfPrarabdha remains: wherever there isAnna-Jala (food and drink) for a man, there he will be dragged and no doubt exists for this. You cannotremain in a place (destiny) even for a second, when the Anna-Jala is finished.
According to swami sivananda Ji MahaRaj:A man may become a Deva / a beast /a bird /vegetable / stone according to his karma’s in the Past. The Upanishads also supportsthis statement. Buddhism and some Western philosophers teach: 'There is no more retrogression for a manwhen once he takes a human birth. There is no necessity for him to be bornas an animal for the sake of demerit/prarabda. He can be punished in a varietyof ways in the human birth itself. ' When a man takes the form of a Deva, allhuman Samskaras, habits and tendencies will remain dormant. When a man takesthe form of a dog, the animal-tendencies, habits and Samskaras only willmanifest. Human tendencies will remain suppressed. Some dogs get royal treatment in the palaces of kings. They move incars, eat good food and sleep on cushions. These are all degenerated humanbeings.
Q:Then what are the methods available to know & overcome the Prarabda? what scripture say in this ? Will it be possible for some one to overcome his Prarabda in this life? Learned members pls put your views. 
Any Prayaschitta ceremonies or by the knowledge of the Self or Brahman, or by the fullfruition of their consequences is possible?
Fora Vedantin there is neither hell nor heaven. Who is to suffer? The Atman is ever dwelling, it is all-pervading. It is ever free (Nitya Mukta). 
Sri Guru Padaravindarpana MastuKameswara

      "One unintentionally falls into deep sleep when the prArabdha for that particular time is over"Did it mean that if some one sleeping in turiya/deep sleep is due to his Prabrada?​
​There is no sleeping in turiyA. turiyA pervades all three states, being one's own svarUpa!​
Will it draw a conclusion that sleep is due to karma? pls explain.
​This question is similar to "does one die due to prArabdhA"? I would say that one dies when one's prArabdha karma in that life is over, meaning when there is no prArabdha left. Similarly, one sleeps off when one's prArabdha karma is over for the day/that time.​
that means one should not sleep at all intentionally? 
You seem to have mixed up sleep and deep-sleep. One chooses to lie down to sleep, but there is no choice to go to deep-sleep (and dream).​​
although sleep is for the physical body.​​
The deep sleep is for the physical bodies (gross and subtle).​​Kind rgds,
