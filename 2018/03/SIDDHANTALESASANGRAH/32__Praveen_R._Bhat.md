This question is similar to "does one die due to prArabdhA"? I would say
that one dies when one's prArabdha karma in that life is over, meaning when
there is no prArabdha left. Similarly, one sleeps off when one's prArabdha
karma is over for the day/that time.

You seem to have mixed up sleep and deep-sleep. One chooses to lie down to
sleep, but there is no choice to go to deep-sleep (and dream).

The deep sleep is for the physical bodies (gross and subtle).
