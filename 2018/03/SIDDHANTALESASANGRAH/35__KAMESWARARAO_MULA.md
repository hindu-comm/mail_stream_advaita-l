Dear Sir, Adi Shankara says about Titiksha :   
      - सहनं सर्वदुःखानामऽप्रतिकारपूर्वकम् |
      - चिन्ताविलापरहितं सा तितिक्षा निगद्यते ||
"Endurance of allafflictions without countering aids, and without anxiety or lament is said tobe titiksha." (Vivekachudamani25)By speaking of titiksha as endurancewithout anxiety or lament and without external aids, Shankara refers to such titikshaas the means to inquiry for a mind which is subject to anxiety/turmoinling, who, when, what??.Swami Vivekananda says that forbearance ofall misery, without even a thought of resisting or driving it out, without evenany painful feeling in the mind.
The practice of YOGA makes a person inwardlyeven-minded and cheerful. The very act of calming emotional reactions developsa better ability to influence outer circumstances, therefore, titiksha does not make oneapathetic or dull; it is the first step to interiorizing the mind, and tobringing its reactions under control. The important way of practicing titiksha is to watch the breath (SWASA) whichpractice leads to the practice of meditation proper. Nature shows the way to titiksha, the creativeprinciple of life – just as inertia is a property of matterThe science of swara Vignan, nasal scycles of the breath (left, right & middle) will fall into 'Sarvodaya' which makes the man perfect and keeps more control over on him. if some one studied more on swarvignan, practiced, it is requested to give more details of that , what are problem generally we encounter & how to overcome those and how to go head in sarvodaya.

Q:Then what are the methods available to know & overcome the Prarabda? what scripture say in this ? 

What need or use is there to know the prArabdha of the body when one knows oneself as brahmAtmA! Aparokshanubhuti says that even prArabdha is not there for the highest jnAnI. What this means that such a jnAnI has his niShTha in AtmA. Then where is the question of his being affected by the bodies? Bhagavan Vidyaranyacharya says in Jivanmuktiviveka that a jnAnI without niShThA has to practice means to vAsanakShaya and manonAsha to get over botherations of prArabdha that drags one to the level of the bodies. There is no other way.

Will it be possible for some one to overcome his Prarabda in this life? 


Yes, as above.
Any Prayaschitta ceremonies or by the knowledge of the Self or Brahman, or by the fullfruition of their consequences is possible?
No, not for a jnAnI, but for an ajnAnI alone prAyaschitta is there since he considers himself as the body or bound by the bodies. The guNas of the bodies are taken as one's own. Then alone prAyaschitta is possible. Else only by undergoing its results can one reduce prArabdha. This increases titikShA for a sAdhaka, in my experience.
Fora Vedantin there is neither hell nor heaven. Who is to suffer? The Atman is ever dwelling, it is all-pervading. It is ever free (Nitya Mukta).
guNA guNeShu vartante iti matvA... suffering accrues only to the one having tAdAtmya sambandha/ associated with that which suffers. Else nityamukta never suffered, isn't suffering, will never suffer.
