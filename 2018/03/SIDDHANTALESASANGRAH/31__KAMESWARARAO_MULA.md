Dear Sir,      "One unintentionally falls into deep sleep when the prArabdha for that particular time is over"Did it mean that if some one sleeping in turiya/deep sleep is due to his Prabrada?
Will it draw a conclusion that sleep is due to karma? pls explain.that means one should not sleep at all intentionally? although sleep is for the physical body.

​First of all, there is vaishamyam since you have jumped from dream to deep sleep. Next, there is an assumption with the phrase "in that case" that connects something that someone else told meaning "(therefore), will I say something". This fails logic as the onus to justify another's statement cannot be on me! In any case, not knowing things in deep sleep is also knowledge/experience since it is recollected. It is anumeyam, known through logic on waking that: I did not know anything, yet I know now that I did not know; Ergo, I must have existedsince I recollect of not knowing anything and recollect the experience of happiness. What is collected alone can be recollected. This example is used by Tattvabodha for this very conclusion.
 There will not be any existence of karana sarira in the deep sleep state, if so any intentional activity in not knowing the things results in sin? 
Did you mean if not knowing is intentional in waking or in deep sleep? In the first option, I don't think not putting efforts to know results in sin that leads to avidyA. To me, it continues the avidyA which has already resulted in the ongoing beginning-less saMsAra. In the second option,suShupti is not quite an intentional activity as one cannot choose to go to deep sleep, but only choose to lie down. One unintentionally falls into deep sleep when the prArabdha for that particular time is over.Further, Shruti leads to the conclusion that kAraNasharIra = avidyA exists in seed-form duringdeep sleep, else a person would never wake up.

pls put your views logically as per tarka/mimasa.​​
​I can answer only in keeping with the tarka ​of the question. As for mImAMsA, the question has to be analysed as well, as I have done above. If your question was something else, it wasn't clear to me at least.​gurupAdukAbhyAm,
