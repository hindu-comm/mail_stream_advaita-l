 Dear Sir, Thank you for your reply and I am actually looking for a translation.bhasya of adishankara's Tattwabodha so that I can go through it. As I attended some of the online classes in the past for Brihadarnkayakopanishad and My intention is also to attend such classes online so that we can grasp the knowledge with some fine examples from the teacher.I will also be searching books from Sh.Gambhiranandaji's translation on tattwabodha.

 ​Namaste Kameswararao Mahodaya,
I am not sure if you meant the text tattvabodha or bodha of the advaitatattva. You have been on this list for long and keep quoting quite a few texts, including the subject line here itself (Siddhantaleshasangraha), so I am going to assume the latter. Its best to approach a gurukulam/ sAmpradAyika teacher in person for advice suiting you. As for books in English, I used to prefer Sw. Gambhiranandaji's translations of bhAShya before I learnt vyAkaraNa. There are lot of works online that you can study or using recordings based on the language you prefer. Else let know the list members what exactly are you looking for online and one of us will hopefully be able to get you exactly what you seek.
In the unlikely case that you meant the former, among other things, I am teaching tattvabodha online, but it includes Sanskrit basics right now for beginners. Please email me off the list if interested, lets not flood this list. I may kindly be excused if this seems like an advertisement!
