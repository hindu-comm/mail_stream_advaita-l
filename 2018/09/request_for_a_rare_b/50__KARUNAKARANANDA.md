Harih Om,



I am searching a book Vedanta Tattvaloka of Janardana, critically edited by
Sri T.A.Venkateshvara Dikshitar, published by Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan,
Bombay in 1969. Now the said book being out of print, I would request the
scholars to throw light on its availability , either its hard copy or ebook
version.
