Namaste Dear Kathirasanji

Thank you again for the questions.
Your point about shravanam, mananam and nididhyaasanam is quite correct.
And perhaps to answer Murali ji more directly:
When the sruti is taken inwards in this way it has the most profound effect
on the entire being.
So as a "practice of advaita in everyday life", this together with regular
dhyanam is it.

During the satsanga I attended, we practised cintana on the first few
verses of ईशोपनिषत्
And again it seems that "understanding" of the shastra is at the mananam
level and involves mind.
But with nididhyaasnam, this goes beyond understanding - to the boundary of
the mind beyond which one must simply surrender.
Then the force of the sound of the sruti "resonates" within and the
activities are "coloured" with a finer

There is much difficulty in writing about paramartha.
Many sentences have been written and erased, because the moment something
is written - the paramartha is ...something ... well it is not.
What can be stated from experience is that by regular practise of inward
attention in various ways, the inner sense of not-doing even while doing
remains.
And the answer to the question "Who am I" is found in selfless service -
the dedication of all action to Bhagavan.
In a different thread, sadhhana and sadhya were used to refer to categories
of scriptures.
As a sadhya type we have the Avadhuta Gita.
In 1.34 he states:
वेदा न लोका न सुरा न यज्ञा वर्णाश्रमो नैव कुलं न जातिः।
न धूममार्गो न च दीप्तिमार्गो ब्रह्मैकरूपं परमार्थतत्त्वम्॥३४॥
To see in this way and to be able to express it as Dattatreya does could be
from the standpoint of paramartha.
I do not have such vision.
But...it does resonate.
So during the "inner" practises this is seen, but during "daily life"...not
so easy...
And this comes back to Bhagavad Gita Chapter 3 - action for the sake of
sacrifice to the Paramaatman.
For when this is performed, a loss of individuality is possible
For the focus can become so fully on the present moment that the only
knowledge required is the knowledge of that moment alone.
Not from mind, citta, memory store but only what is प्रत्यक्ष.
Whatever may arise in the citta and manifest as action is in accordance
with the need of the moment (e.g. typing in my case, slaughtering a few
million beings in Arjuna's)

Kind Regards
Ryan
