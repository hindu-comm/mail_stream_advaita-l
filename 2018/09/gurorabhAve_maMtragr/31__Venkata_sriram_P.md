Namaste,

गुरोरभावे विप्रेंद्र मंत्रग्रहणमुच्यते ॥

कृष्णपक्षे चतुर्दश्यां दक्षिणामूर्तिसंनिधौ ।
तालपत्रे मनुं लिख्य स्थापयेच्च तदग्रतः ॥ ...(१)

संपूज्य दक्षिणामूर्तिमुपचारैः प्रयत्नतः ।
पायसं विनिवेद्याथ प्रणमेद्दंडवत्ततः ॥ ..(२)

तालपत्रं समालोक्य पठेदष्टोत्तरं शतम् ।
एवं गृहीतो मंत्रः स्याद गुरोरपि विशिष्यते । ..(३)

गुरौ संभाविता दोषाः प्रायेण तु कलौ युगे ।
एवं गृहीतो मंत्रः स्यात्सर्वसिद्धिप्रदो नृणाम् ॥ ..(४)

The ‘दीक्षा प्रकाशिका’ while mentioning the method of taking mantra diksha in the absence of proper Guru, 
refers to Padma Purana (needs to be referred) as below:

The person desirous of mantra should approach the Adiguru Dakshinamurti Temple / Photo of Dakshinamurti 
at Home ‘with Guru-bhava’ on 14th day of Dark Fortnight ie., chaturdashi tithi of Krishna Paksha.  
He should write his iSTa-mantra (which he needs to be initiated) on tALa-patra and place before Dakshinamurti. 
Should perform formal worship to Dakshinamurti and offer ‘paayasa’ (porridge prepared with cow milk). 
Then, he should receive the tAla-patra from Dakshinamurti as if his guru is giving and repeat that mantra 108 times. 

The last verse says that this procedure can be adopted which bring auspiciousness in 
Kali Yuga as many gurus in Kali Yuga are incompetent to initiate owing to blemishes in their character.

Regs,
Sriram
