May I ask why is it not acceptable to change the leg position slightly at
the onset of numbness to avoid numbness and then continue unhindered for
longer time?  Is it because the temporary break in one pointed attention
should be avoided?  But then being even slightly aware of the numbness
distracts too.

Iâ€™ve heard that people who have difficulty sitting on the floor can
meditate sitting on a chair with back straight or even those with back
problems - especially in old age - can sit with soft wall cushion, since it
is not possible to sit upright.

Dhanyavaad,
Sanju Nath
