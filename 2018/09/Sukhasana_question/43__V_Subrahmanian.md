The requirement of 'sthira-sukham-aasanam' allows for a convenient,
comfortable seating that is 'sthira', firm, in the sense, not shaky, and at
the same time painless for the person sitting.  When one becomes old, due
to age, age related ailments, and even young persons who have suffered an
accident/fracture, etc. sit in a chair and still have achieved good level
of meditation.

Even in a seated, that is squatting, position, over a period of time a
person learns the best posture suited for him.
