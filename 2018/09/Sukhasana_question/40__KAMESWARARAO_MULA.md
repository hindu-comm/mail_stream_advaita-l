Dear Kartik, "Is there some remedy to stop the legs from falling asleep"
           In general when the kundalini is active in the body and if you are sitting in meditation for 45-60 minutes, what happens to the blood flow & the energy instead of going up, it goes down i..e it goes to the feet and settles down there. This is not asleep, but you may call it as numbness or moch. It happens automatically.

Once the meditation is completed, rather than getting up immediately, one can keep a glass of water near by, so that you can sprinkle little on the feet so that they comes to normal state in 3-5 mintues. Try this & hope it will work
regardsKameswara

Blessed Patrons,

Sadar Pranam,

I am only able to sit for prayers in Sukhasana, cannot do sarvangasana
which is a panacea for blood flow.

After about 45 mins -to 1 hr my legs go to sleep (numbness) while in
Sukhasana, while the mind can still pray, the sleeping legs are a stopping
factor, I have to get up from my prayers and give the legs some rest and
then begin again.

Is there some remedy to stop the legs from falling asleep, some old wives
tale" or
"Gharelu Nuska".

Will the time period to sit in Sukhasana gradually increase by itself?

Any advise, help will be appreciated. Thank you.

Pranam,

OM
Kartik Vashishta
