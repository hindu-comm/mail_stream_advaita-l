Hari Om, ["Srimad Bhagavad-Gita Chanting" playlist - https://bit.ly/2wB4Lah]
"Srimad Bhagavad-Gita Chanting" playlist is the collection of all the
Srimad Bhagavad-Gita shlokas chanting starting from chapter 01 to chapter
18. With bhagavad gita aarti song at the end. Sri Jaganatha Sastry Ji used
a very easy method for teaching the chanting and pronouncing of these
beatiful shlokas. So, it is easy for any body to chant the Shlokas. This
audio content is created by Sri Jaganatha Sastry Ji and team. To take the
blessings of Shri Krishna to all the people. Below is the link for the
playlist. ["Srimad Bhagavad-Gita Chanting" playlist - https://bit.ly/2wB4Lah]
Hari Om.
