There is a two-volume book 'Crest Jewel of Yogis' authored by Sri Umesh, a
biography of the Sringeri Jagadguru HH Sri Abhinava Vidyatirtha
Swamin, published by Sharada Trust, Sringeri, in 1984.  The second volume
contains dozens of articles by various persons about their experiences with
the Acharya. One article among them is by the author himself giving a lot
of details about himself, how he came to the Acharya, the blessings he
received therefrom, etc.

The books are not available now in print.  So, there is ample information
about the background of the author.
