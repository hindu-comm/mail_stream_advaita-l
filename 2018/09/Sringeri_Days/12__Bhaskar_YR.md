He might be a real person but it's hard to believe he is a 'siddha purusha'. If he is a recluse, he'd be living in the woods or be a wandering monk. When he is s living in a city, there is no compelling reason to hide. If you like to have a quiet life, you don't go around telling ppl that you are a siddha. It makes us think that he is hiding because he is not a siddha or even prodigious. He is hiding because it's all a lie, a propaganda.

I have not heard much credible biographical information about this gentleman Sri Umesh but saw some books written by him, such as Mind Control and stuffs  like that.  Is he telling people that he is siddha purusha and they should worship him and at the same time hiding because he is an imposter ?? Not able to understand the above observation in its context and  I don’t know why we are spending so much energy to find his credentials when he himself reclusive and does not want to be public!!  

Well let that be aside, if he is a jnAni, then definitely he will not be a svecchaachAri and he will not indulge in any adhArmic kriya-s since he realized even dharma para kriya-s themselves are avidyAkruta :-) And there is certain characteristics with regard to jnAni-s attitude and behavior enshrined in scriptures and bhAshya-s though there were some exceptions we may find in eccentric atyAshrami avadhUta-s.    If that is not the case, if we justify all the  questionable acts of the person whom we believe as jnAni by  citing the pramANa-s like  prArabdha karma, avidyA lesha, upanishad vAkya etc.  then I don’t find any valid reason to  deny  myself the status of  paramArtha jnAni with tinge of avidyAlesha :-) After all I have the support of  Upanishad vAkya which says jnAni is free to do anything, live the life the way he wants etc.  and of course due to  onslaught of that inevitable prArabdha karma and avidyA lesha I am still a gruhastha with all materialistic desires.  But still I am a jnAni as I know, kAmaH kartA nAhaM kartA kAmaH kArayita nAhaM kArayita etc.  : -)  Does the society needs the quack  jnAni-s like me Or the noble souls as explained in geeta sthita prajna lakshaNa??     

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
