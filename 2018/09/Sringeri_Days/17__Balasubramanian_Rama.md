I wasn't going to reply to this, just bugging me too much. Let me say that
it's just too bad that the senior Acharya of Sringeri does not meet your
expectations and "disappoints" you. Now, who the hell are YOU, BTW? Also
note to Aditya Kumar and Bhaskar, no one is dying to get your approval. Who
the hell do you think you guys are anyway that everyone is dying to get you
to take them seriously? Subbu-ji has already pointed out the reality of the
situation. Bhaskar I know you love to hate the Sringeri parampara, but
don't let that be the thing that wakes you up in the morning.
