Namaste

This is Kali Yuga. In this a true Jnani will look like a fake and a fake
Guru will look like a Jnani. Everything is reversed. Western people will
learn and practice our wisdom and our people will abandon it and become
Western. Therefore a person knowing this should not be mentally disturbed.
