Sorry I do not want to start trolling here.

BUT...I am a little disappointed in the senior acharya that he would take
these 6(?) young people so seriously. We can discern - I think - their
latent self-love and love of attention.

I can only imagine the distress that all this must have caused in the
current acharya's mind: especially the Umesh groupism.

I think over on FB, one of them (I am not 100 % sure) is still creating
mischief by dismissing  (in private communications ) the current acharya as
just merely scholarly.

I could be wrong- please feel free to correct me
