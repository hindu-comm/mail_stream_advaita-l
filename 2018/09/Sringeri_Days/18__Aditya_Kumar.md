 So don't take it seriously, why are you triggered? If this forum expects everyone to indulge in blind beliefs and mindless superstition, personality cult worship, feel free to take me off the list or block me or don't read my emails.

it's just too bad that the senior Acharya of Sringeri does not meet your

don't let that be the thing that wakes you up in the morning.
