The Upanishads do not approve of anyone dictating to a Jnani how he should
be, behave, live, etc.

In the Brhadāraṇyaka-upaniṣad, the jīvanmukta is eulogised thus:

sa brāhmaṇaḥ kena syādyena syāttenedṛśa eva ।47 (III.5.1)

// How does that knower of Brahman behave? Howsoever he may
behave, he is just such.//

Thus, the Upanishads have a better understanding of a Jnani than what you
may have.
