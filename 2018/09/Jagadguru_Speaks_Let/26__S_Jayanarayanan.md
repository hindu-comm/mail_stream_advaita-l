 Happy Janmashtami!


(Around the beginning of the month, a nugget of Wisdom from the Jagadguru may be posted
on the Chaturamnaya list : http://lists.advaita-vedanta.org/cgi-bin/listinfo/chaturamnaya )

Man must read the Bhagavad Gita at least once in his life time. First,
he must practise reading little by little and, once he gains a taste for it,
understand the principles mentioned in it. Only then he will realise in
which direction his life is going, what is right and what is wrong and
avoid recurring mistakes.

At the beginning, one must read at least two slokas each day. If, out
of pride he feels that he knows everything and he gives up half way
through, his mind will again go astray into the mire of the senses. It
will destroy his discrimination, just as the tempest overturns the boat.

 tadasya harati praGYAM vAyurnAvamivAmbhasi .. 2\-67..

This is what the Bhagavatam also says. That is, sometimes, even
after knowing that things are unreal, he chases such mirage-like
objects, impelled by loss of discrimination. attachment to the body
and the like.

 kvachit.h sakRRi davagataviShaya vaitathyaH svayaM paraabhidhyAnena .
 vibhraMshita smRRitistayaiva mariichitoya praayaaM staaneva.abhidhaavati ..

It is to be understood that only the person who has approached a
realised guru and has understood the Gita through him will not again
be affected by worldly desires. He will then clearly understand the
greatness of the Gita. Hence we bless all to keep the Bhagavad Gita as a
guide to their lives.
