Wishing all list members and readers a happy Gujarati New Year (vikram 
samvat 2075 sadharana nama samvatsara.)

Yesterday on Diwali we worshipped Lakshmi Mata for prosperity but I was 
reminded during the puja that two of Her eight principal forms include 
Vidyalakshmi and Yogalakshmi.  May we all gain untold spiritual riches in 
this coming year along with material ones.
