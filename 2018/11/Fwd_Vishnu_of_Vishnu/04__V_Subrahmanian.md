'Vishnu' of Vishnu Puranam is Nirguna Brahman

In the Vishnu Puranam occur these verses in the dialogue containing the
teaching of the Knowledge that is to be realized for liberation:

न संति यत्र सर्वेशे *नामजात्यादिकल्पनाः * ।

सत्तामात्रत्मके ज्ञेये ज्ञानात्मन्यात्मनः परे  ॥ ६,४.३७ ॥


[In that Supreme Paramatman that transcends the jiva, there are no
attributes like name and genus, It is Pure Existence, the one to be
'realized, known'. It is verily pure consciousness. It is the Lord of
all.]
