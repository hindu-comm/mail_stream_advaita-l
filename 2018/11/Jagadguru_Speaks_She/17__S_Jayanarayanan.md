Man's real great enemies in life are desire (kama) and anger (krodha).
One who has not controlled them will have no peace of mind and happiness.
Due to uncontrolled anger, he will hurt himself as well as others. 

For some people, anger is momentary. Even they may be called noble (uttama)
persons. For some others, anger may last half a day. For them, it will be
good to minimise it further.

Some will be angry day and night. They belong to the adhama (lowest)
category. For some others anger never subsides. Throughout their lives
they will be harbouring anger on the pretext of taking revenge. They will
never forgive others. They are termed papishtha (sinner). Such a rage will
destroy the angry person himself.

 uttamasya kShaNaM kopo madhyasya praharadvyam .
 adhamasya tvahoratraM paapiShTho naiva muchyate ..

On the other hand, there are some who will empathize with others' sorrow
and will attempt to help the afflicted persons in all possible ways.
They will make use of every opportunity to help the afflicted persons.
Our ancestors praised them as noble persons.

 uttamAnAM svabhAvo.ayaM paraduHkhaasahiShNutaa .
 svayaM duHkhaM cha saMtApaM manyate.anyasya vaaryate ..

Therefore, every individual should gradually shed desire and anger.
Again, one must understand others' sorrow and come forward to render all
possible help. 

We bless all to understand this clearly and act accordingly.
