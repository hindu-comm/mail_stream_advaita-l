Interesting and insightful discussion! It is important to note that
causality as explaining reality is rejected by Gaudapada in his kArikAs. So
causal closure does not mean much, if both causes and effects are unreal.
The question that needs to be asked of those who believe in Physicalism is:
who observes/experiences the causes and effects? It cannot be a physical
entity, because such an observation would then have to be part of the
cause-effect network. But everyone agrees that observation/experience of
the observer is not a cause or effect. It is coincidental. In Vedantic
terms, this observation/experience is indeed jnAna, something that cannot
be explained as a physical entity. The dArshanikas, not just Vedantins,
recognized this. For example, even naiyAyikas hold that jnana is a property
of the soul. (jnAnAdhikaraNam-AtmA - tarkasaMgraha of annaMbhaTTa)
