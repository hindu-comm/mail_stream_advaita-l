Thank you for that very interesting post, Kartik ji giving an overview of
the current debate between physicalism (matter alone exists) and dualism
(which accepts two irreducible  realities viz., matter and consciousness).
Its funny that in the context  of the above debate vedAnta would actually
side with *dualism* rather than physicalism.  Was that why you referred to
'vyavahAre bhAtta nyAya' (i.e., in empirical matters, vedAnta does take
sides viz., it endorses Vedic dualism of mImAmsA rather than maintaining a
stoic advaitic neutrality when someone attacks the dualism of Vedic karma
kANDam? Even so, vedAnta would support dualism (of puruSa and prakriti)
rather than the 'flatland' physicalism of modern science.)

One additional aspect is the following .

Science denies any role or existence not just for the puruSa or
consciousness but also other sUxma physical entities (provisionally)
accepted in the vedas, such as prANa (and apAna, vyAna etc) - the
self-organizing principle which maintains the body's cells and organ
systems working integratedly. ( One Swamiji used to say that the field of
biology awaits it's Einstein.)

All of reality is just 'flattened out' in physicalism (modern scientific
materialism) with no vertical depth along the lines of prAna, then more
sUxma is manas, buddhi etc.

Even at an individual/personal level, rhetorically speaking, physicalism
seems to be (in my perception) a highly schizophrenic if not dishonest
standpoint to take. Because those very scientists who argue in favour of
physicalism will have emotions like love and anger and compete for
tenureships in universities etc., and yet refuse to see the elephant in the
room. They may come home and play with their friendly pet dog 'looking into
its eyes'. They surely experience a depth there in a pet or a child , which
is not there in a chair or stone?

Leaving rhetoric aside, one argument advanced by physicalism in favour of
'consciousness not having any role in the cause-effect chain' is from the
principle  of conservation of energy (PCE). To initiate any change requires
energy and no such energy transfer is observed when you are supposed to
exercise your so-called free will to move your hand etc. Therefore free
will does not exist, goes one argument.

I understand that the riposte to the above is based on recent developments
in physics which acknowledge the occurrence of events (like in the case of
particle entanglement) where mere observation which does not need any
energy to be transferred etc., influences the further evolution of a
system.

I hope to read up further with the help of the references provided by you.

Om
Raghav
