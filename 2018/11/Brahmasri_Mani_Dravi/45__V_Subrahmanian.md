Maybe you will be able to get all the videos here, in sequential order:

http://www.advaita-academy.org/talk/vedanta-paribhasha-vedantavishaya-part-4/

See the playlist there for VP.

The 'students' interacting are: Vidwan ....Misra of Madras Sanskrit College
and Sri.L.Narayanan, a Chartered Acct. and Sanskrit enthusiast.  I don't
think you will gain anything more than what is in the videos by interacting
with these two persons. When I requested Sri MDS for starting this VP Hindi
series for the Academy, his only condition was: 'The exposition would be
better if someone sits before me rather than my talking to a camera.' To
fulfill this condition, he himself commissioned Misra ji, who is a nyaya
scholar, as I understand, to 'attend' the recording sessions. Sri
Narayanan, my friend, took up the responsibility of arranging the sessions
with a great commitment by constantly being in touch with Sri MDS for his
availability for the sessions.
