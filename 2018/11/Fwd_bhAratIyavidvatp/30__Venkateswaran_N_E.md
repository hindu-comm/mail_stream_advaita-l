There are two pramaNAs for fireworks during Diwali, not vedic, but in
smritis.

1. In Smriti Kaustubha of A anta Deva.  Check this Twitter handle for the
reference.

2. In the Kartika Mahatmya of Hari Bhakti Vilasa. I don't have the exact
reference.

Both the above works are available in archive.org.

Venkateswaran
