Namaste ji
That was an interesting quiz. One clarification - there is this notion that
bursting of crackers during Deepavali was not there during ancient times .
The Chinese invented fireworks anyway etc etc. There are some references in
'Sukra-niti' about fireworks, but it's a text whose dating is in dispute .

Is there really a Vedic reference to bursting of crackers called Ulka-danam
as mentioned in your post? That would settle the issue.

I particularly liked the charming idea of *'compulsory'* bursting of
crackers apparently mentioned in the Veda. :)

Thank you
Raghav

 Question was based on -
2.Bursting of crackers has been popular in India since Vedic times. The Rig
veda calls it Agni upasana. The Sanskrit sloka Ulka danam refers to the
*compulsory bursting* of crackers during Diwali. Who was the composer of
this
sloka?

Ans: Ved Vyas.
