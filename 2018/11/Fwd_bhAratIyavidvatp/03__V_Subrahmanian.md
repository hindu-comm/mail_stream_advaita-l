Namaste

Here are two video talks in Kannada by MM Sri S.T.Nagaraja Sharma who
taught Vyakarana at the Govt. Sanskrit College, Bangalore for long and
retired a few years back. The two videos are a great treat by themselves.
So many facets of Kalidasa's personality, medha vilaasa, are brought out in
a very interesting and involving way.  The videos are a couple of years
old.  I enjoyed the narrative to the hilt and thought of sharing the same
here.

The greatness of Mallinatha, the reputed commentator of Kalidasa, too is
brought out here and there.

They are titled: Kaavya-shaastra-sambandha.  How the kaavya connects with
various shaastras such as vyakarana, dharma, Veda-Vedanta, etc. are brought
out in a very telling manner.  It is worth listening to these in the
validation of the statement:

काव्यशास्त्रविनोदेन कालो गच्छति धीमताम् । ....One feels enriched in so many
ways at the end of the day.  My thinking is that even those not very well
versed with Kannada can enjoy the videos as Sanskrit is the primary medium,
