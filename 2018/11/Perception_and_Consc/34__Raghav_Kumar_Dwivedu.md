Namaste
Thank you for the compilation posted by you.
Is there any logical way to refute the modern materialistic idea that
matter and it's forms and movements in space and time, i.e., the 'world of
space time and causation' is not in any way affected by "consciousness"
(even if it exists) and that matter alone is sufficient to effect changes
in matter? The cause of everything is matter alone .

(Some madhyastha vedantins might say "ayuShmAn Bhava" to the above
materialistic idea based on a superficial similarity to the akartRAtmA idea
and that the guNas of matter act on one another effecting all changes . Tge
first cause is matter alone. The mistake/divergence in this idea is that
vedAnta holds that only with AtmA as sAxI, things can happen in space and
time - an idea unacceptable to scientific materialism.)

Om
Raghav
