Namaste
Thank you for presenting the ideas on the  interplay of pramANas and
pratyaxa-prAbalyanirAsa in an understandable way - that's not an easy task.

I particularly noted -
क्वच प्रत्यक्षत: प्राप्तमनुमानागमबाधितमिति तु
परीक्षितप्रामाण्यप्रत्यक्षविषयम् | In some instances, where the results of
perception are well-tested, and there is certainty that it is the truth,
such a perception is capable of overruling inference and scripture,
requiring them to be reinterpreted. However, that does not mean that all
inference and scripture lose their validity.

Such a non-dogmatic approach to understanding Shruti pramANam makes the
Advaita Vedanta tradition quite versatile and capable of handling
contemporary schools of thought like scientific materialism etc.

One other point I request you to clarify is about where an arthavAda is to
be taken literally. I quote -
"उक्तंहि - 'असंजातविरोधित्वादर्थवादो यथाश्रुत:| आस्थेयस्तद्विरुद्धस्य
विध्युद्देशस्य लक्षणा'
According to pUrva mImAmsa: "When an arthavAda is encountered without
anything to contradict it, it has to be interpreted literally (as heard).
Where there is a (subsequent) injunction that contradicts that literal
meaning, it is the injunction that has to be reinterpreted to take a
secondary meaning.

This rule occurs in the context of an arthavAda which says that the rig
veda was born from agni (fire), the yajur veda from vAyu (wind), sAma veda
from Aditya (the sun). Later, there is an injunction which says that one
should recite the rig loudly, the yajus quietly, etc. Here a question is
raised."

My doubt is - how does the subsequent years injunction to chant yajus
quietly etc., amount to a *contradiction* of the earlier arthavAda? Is it a
reference to the fact that the *word* "Rk", "yajus" etc, mean the entire
Rg-veda in the first (i.e., arthavAda) context while the same words refer
to only some specific mantras in the second context? The purva-mImAmsaka is
at pains to point out that the later interpretation of the word Rk, yajus
in the second (injunction) context is *not* to be retrospectively extended
to the previous (arthavAda) context. Is this correct?

Thank you again for your sharing your Advaita Siddhi adhyayanam.

In this chapter, some interesting pUrva mImAmsa maxims are invoked in the
analysis of the relative strengths of various pramANa-s.
