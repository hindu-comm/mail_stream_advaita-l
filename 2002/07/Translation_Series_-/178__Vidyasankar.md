>1) pR^ithA is the pre-adoption name of kunti. Hence arjuNa is called
>pArtha or son of pR^ithA. When you say "son of prithu" do you mean the

Sorry, I made a typo, which escaped my attention before posting. pArtha =
son of pR^ithA (kunti). pR^ithu is a masculine line, and the derived form
would not be pArtha.

Haven't been able to find out this. I vaguely remember some mention of the
varAha purANa as the source of the verses on gItA mAhatmya, but have to
check whether this verse is also from there.

I'll post the first half of the introductory chapter translation soon.
