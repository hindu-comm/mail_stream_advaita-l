I am sorry if I ended up giving the impression that you subscribe to the
views of ISKCON. I only referred to your email as a reference for some of
the arguments ISKCON followers make in their support. This issue i.e. of
Padma Purana, has been discussed on this list and almost everyone is aware,
at least those who followed the thread, that the Padma Purana references do
not even tally with Padma Purana existent in other parts (non-Bengal) of
India.
