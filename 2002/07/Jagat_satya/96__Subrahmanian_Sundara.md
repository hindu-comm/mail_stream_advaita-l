Dear Sri Ashish Chandra,

When you get a chance can you post on Padma Purana's argument against
advaita.  I have not read Padma Purana.  Your posting will be very
educative.  When you have time...

Regards,
SVS

What I meant was that they have been there since at least Sri Chaitanya
Mahaprabhu and winning converts ever since then. They have always attacked
and opposed Advaita but they were not "noticed" till Sri Prabhupada went to
America. You should not forget that the Padma Purana references against
Advaita were not written by Sri Prabhupada and his followers.
