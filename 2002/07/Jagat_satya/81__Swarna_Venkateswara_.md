hari om. yes, i did hear about him and read a few of
his 'chamatkars'. thanks for clarifying. love is the
best protector. miraji could drink poison in her love
for sri krishna and survive it! probably you can think
of many more examples. so, for one who sees God in
everything, poison or nectar will be same. Yagno,
yagnapatir yajwa, yagnango, yagna sadhana... goes Sri
Vishnu Sahasranama Stotra. He is the yagna, he is the
doer of the yagna, he is the goal of yagna etc.

yoga means unification. till it is achieved,
restrictions in diet etc., are probably necessary. but
for one who has gained that true love, nothing more is
left to be desired or achieved. love gives power.
universal love gives universal power.

Hari Om.

Swarna Venkateswara Swamy
