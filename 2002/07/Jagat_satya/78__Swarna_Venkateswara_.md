Dear Ashish,

I was intrigued by "Hanumanji says drink chai". Who
was or is Hanumanji? May be if you are doing yoga,
chai may not be good. If you serve and love everyone,
your health, spiritual, mental and physical will be so
good that you can take chai or liquor and still be
unaffected!

Narayana (the eternal companion of nara) may be
different from Narayana, the Supreme deity. Just like
I, Venkateswara Swamy, am different from Venkateswara
Swamy of Tirumala! How to know, after all these
thousands of years? Just a thought!

By the way, there is an interesting story about the
time Sri Ramakrishna passed away. Shri Sai Baba of
Shirdi, went into Samadhi for 3 days. His body didn't
show any sign of life but did not decay. On return to
consciousness, He (Baba) told his devotees that He
wanted to cast off His body but was not allowed by
Allah. Baba told His devotees that His brother,
Gadadhar (Sri Ramakrishna) wanted to leave this earth
plane, so Allah asked Baba to take that work too and
asked Him to return to earth. And shortly the news of
Sri Ramakrishna's passing away reached Shirdi.

Sorry for diverting the group from the Advaita of Sri
Sankara, but Ashish's mail just triggered this.

Swamy SV
