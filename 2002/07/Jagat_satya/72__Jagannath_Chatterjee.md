Dear Kartik,

I think you have got me a bit wrong. By "vidya's ego" Sri Ramakrishna did
not mean that Sri Sankaracharya was proud of his knowledge. What he meant
was vidya with respect to/or against avidya. He meant the "ripe ego", "paka
ami", which means ego which is totally surrendered to the Absolute.

No hard feelings, ok!

yours sincerely

Jagannath
