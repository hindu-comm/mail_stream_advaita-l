Of course, it goes without saying that
Shankaraachaarya has great compassion for all living
beings, and we revere Him as THE world-teacher.

But you had said that He has the "Vidya's ego", and I
felt that it was sacrilege on our part to speak of an
ego for Shankaraachaarya!

He had no ego at all, even if it be an ego of
Knowledge. If He did, He wouldn't be a GYAnI.

Ramana Maharshi writes in the introduction to his
translation of the vivekachUDaamaNi, "Shankara is the
Atman that shines in Me" or words to that effect.
