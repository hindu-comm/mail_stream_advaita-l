Dear Ashisji/Vyasji,

Namaskar.

Definitely Swamiji had drawn new meaning from the
Upanishads, Veda's and Bhagavad Gita. Swamiji did not
invent the altruistic approach, he only rediscovered
it from the sources mentioned above. He did differ
from Sri Shankaracharya when he led stress on seeing
the self in all and serving them as such. Swamiji
praised Sri Shankaracharya to dizzying heights but he
also accused him of distorting the scriptures to
project his own brand of advaita.

The need for "reforming the reforms" of Swami
Vivekanada appears only to those who oppose him for
the following;

1. His catholicity in accepting the inherent truth of
all religions and sects. Ekam sad vipra bahudha
vadanti.

2. His concept of the monks staying out of politics
and serving the masses without any hope of return.

3. His strong opposition to the Brahministic class who
did nothing but exploit the poor in the name of
religion.

Regarding certain quasi-religio-political
organisations, they are an oppurtunistic lot.
sometimes they fall at the feet of Swami Vivekananda
and sometimes they hold closed door meetings with the
Shankaracharyas.

Nobody can claim to "know" Vivekananda. On the day of
his attaining mahasamadhi, 4th July 1902, he was heard
muttering to himself "Only another Vivekananda can
know what this Vivekananda has done!" I personally
believe each of his utterances are sutras of which
volumes of bhasyas can be written. One can realise the
greatness of this Prophet by the fact that Sri
Ramakrishna thought it fit to teach pure advaita to
Swamiji alone and nobody else.

Yours sincerely

Jagannath.
