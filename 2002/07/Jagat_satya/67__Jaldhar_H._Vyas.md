Alas, this is another project of mine which has fallen by the wayside for
lack of time.  I can tell you what Swami Vidyaranya has to say about the
matter though.  Karma has its' forward momentum.  It's like with a car.
If you are going fast and suddenly slam on the brakes, it will continue
moving for a while before stopping.  So to with the Jivanmukta.  After
achieving jnana, there is no more duality but the after-effects of the
pre-jnana duality (prarabdha karma) may continue until they are exhausted.
