This is a very simplistic view, in my opinion. A jivanmukta cannot be
branded this way or that way. Sri Ramkrishna was a jivanmukta. What he
taught his close disciples was *an* approach to mukti, not *the* approach.
The question of mithyatva confounds only the seeker, not the knower. We can
second-guess all our lives whether Sri Ramkrishna was Tantric or Advaitin.
Thing is, and again in my opinion, it does not matter - He was/is God
revealed to us at a time and place, in human form. If it helps a seeker to
follow Sri Ramkrishna, he/she may do so. If it does not, he/she may not.
But no one should be under the impression that he/she will reach a
different "destination" by following Sri Ramkrishna than by following Sri
Adi Shankaracharya. Both were liberated souls and both proclaimed several
time that All is One. It may be good for some to get bogged down in details
while for some others, it may be best to leave them alone, for now.
