You should really ask why, and how, Jagannath thinks Swami Vivekananda's
views differed from the early teachers. Why do you take his word for it
without your own enquiry?

But the VHP also quotes Shankaracharyas. What does that prove? People who
follow Vivekananda today do so because he was made famous by his speech in
1893 in the Parliament of Religions. If he had not made that speech, would
Vivekananda have thought differently even though no one followed him?
People follow whoever is famous, whoever is attractive. At the time of
Vivekananda, the "colonial servant class" was gaining power. It is they
that made him famous and it is they who followed him. If they had
shortcomings, how are Vivekananda's teachings to blame for that. If those
that followed him were not ready, what is to be said then about him? And
you should always keep in mind thet Vivekananda taught nothing that Sri
Ramakrishna did not tell him to. The reason I mention this is that
following a saint is one of the most mystifying and difficult of things and
all sorts of things are said one way or another. Those who know, know.
Those who don't know, talk.

What I meant was that they have been there since at least Sri Chaitanya
Mahaprabhu and winning converts ever since then. They have always attacked
and opposed Advaita but they were not "noticed" till Sri Prabhupada went to
America. You should not forget that the Padma Purana references against
Advaita were not written by Sri Prabhupada and his followers.

It is a great thing if you always know what to do.

So it does not matter to you "why" we should be compassionate? Where is the
automatic acceptance coming from if not due to faith in the words of the
Vedas and/or the Guru? Where is the logic? I am not against logic but there
are certain things that we just cannot know right now, today. It is upto us
whether or not we accept them on faith in the words of the Guru or we just
keep running around in circles. That is what I had meant to convey.

Logic is for today. It is not for tomorrow. There is no logic in following
what the Guru says. However, you *feel* you want to follow him. Can there
be logic to explaining this feeling? It is only His grace purifying your
heart that you feel what you feel. There is no logic in looking at a
saint's picture and breaking down and crying. But it happens all the time.
What is it but His grace? How would you explain that?

I am not so sure that practice itself can be explained at every stage. In
the perfect state, everything is known but prior to that, I am not quite
conviced personally that I can explain everything.

Among the first things I did, about four years ago, was to go through these
websites. In almost every one of them, there is mention of Adi Shankara and
the debates between them and Advaita. Dvaita.org has a failry good list on
these. All of them had to "disprove" Shankara before they could talk of
their own philosophy. That is what I meant by Advaitized - there is a
flavor for or againt it in every philosophy since Adi Shankara. On the
other hand, you will not hear of Vishishtadvaitins giving too much emphasis
on trying to disprove the doctrines of Kapalikas.
