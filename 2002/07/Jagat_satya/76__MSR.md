Can you tell me how you will decide whether someone is a jivana mukta
or not? IMO, I don't think there is an objective way to decide that.
For all practical purposes it is only a claim, which is often made by
the followers of that particular teacher.

Safest option is not to accept to someone is a jivana mukta (as a
matter of faith) and critically evaluate whatever she or he says based
on shaastra-s and also common sense. When we do that it is irrelevant
whether that person is jivana mukta or not. After all inflating someone
to jivana mukta status is not going to get us anything.


namaste Ashish:

Sri Ramakrishna himself claims that he is an avatara of Lord Narayana
-- he is emphatic that he is not talking in metaphysical sense, lest
Vivekananda might misinterpret it that way (see Gospel just before he
passes away). There are differences between avatara of iishvara and
jiivanamukta.

Of course whether you accept his claim or not is a matter of faith.
