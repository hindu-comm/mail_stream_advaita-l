Namaste Swarna Venkateswara

Sri Neem Karoli Baba (Maharajji), a 20th century saint of North India is
said to be Hanumanji. You can read about him at www.neemkarolibaba.com. He
is also known as the "Chamatkari Baba" (Miracle Saint).

He told everyone to "love everyone, serve everyone, remember God and tell
the truth" and that would be enough.

Dear Kartikji,

Not only the manifestation of power. The avatar is the
direct manifstation of the supreme power (Vishnu in
the case of Sri Ramakrishna), whereas a gyani is a
jiva who attans to the supreme. Whereas the avatar is
the "son of the king" and can go as pleases to the
interior of the palace and back, the gyani is an
outsider who has access only to the front room or the
visitors room.

Yours sincerely,

Jaganath
