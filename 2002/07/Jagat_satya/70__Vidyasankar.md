There is a bridge between pravRtti and nivRtii, make no mistake about it.
Practically speaking, it is the same person who was on the pravRtti mArga,
who has to finally enter the nivRtti mArga. It can either be a jump, with a
total break from pravRtti, or it can be a gradual process. The latter is
described in the gItA, chapter 6 - shanaish shanair uparamed buddhyaa dhRti-
gRhiitayaa.
