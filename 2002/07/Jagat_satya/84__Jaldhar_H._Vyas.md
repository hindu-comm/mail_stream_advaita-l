No not everything but there is no doubt there was a considerable
"advaitizing" streak.

My opinion is at least based on some attempt to look at the evidence.
Shouldn't we at least try to know?

If you are refering to  ISKCON then yes.  But in the 20th century.

Well the best of us did manage it so why shouldn't we take the challenge
of being the best?

I hope you are right.  The cynic in me wonders if sometimes the modern
gurus deliberately encourage their followers to stay ignorant to avoid
them realizing how bogus their teachings are.

No it is THE way.  This is the literal meaning of Mimamsa--the logical
analysis of Karma (in Purva Mimamsa) and Brahman (in Uttara Mimamsa or
Vedanta.)  This is exactly what all the acharyas (not just Advaita ones)
do.

I am not arguing for logic only.  On the contrary I am saying it is your
faith which should impell you to aim further and further.  My background
is only a little less humbe than yours.  I certainly wasn't born knowing
all this stuff.  But I did learn from my parents that Hinduism was a way
of life.  It is not so much about believing but _doing_ and spiritual
progress comes in perfecting what you do.  There have been many times when
I have done the wrong thing or misunderstood what to do but faith drives
me to try and correct the mistakes and make things better and better.

Right but which people?  Am I one of those people?  Are you?  how can you
tell?  These are some of the questions you should ask yourself.

What if YOU were the someone he was trying to teach a lesson.

If I do I will not refuse to listen for dogmatic reasons.  On the
contrary I will have a lot of questions for him. :)

One must not be afraid of jijnasa (enquiry.)  That is the only path to
mukti.  And one shouldn't think it is disrespectful to ask questions of
gurus.  The reverence we give to them is not just a cult of personality
but in homage to the knowedge they give us.  That is what they are here
for.

Now that Shailaja is almost about to start talking, I was thinking about
my own childhood.  Almost as soon as I could talk my mother taught me some
prarthanas.  There were about six shlokas that we would say together every
night.  Now I know a lot more but do you think I consider my mother
inferior because she only taught six shlokas?  On the other hand if at the
age of 31 all I knew were those same six shlokas, wouldn't that be
backward of me?
