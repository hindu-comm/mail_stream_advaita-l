Or he may be addressing both. We wouldn't know and can only speculate. But
what we can tell, or at least I can, is that is he is teaching his
disciples, and those who read him today, that the one that appears as many
is only One.

I don't think I am any expert on Sri Ramakrishna's teaching so I don't want
to mislead anyone. I have only read a portion of the Gospel, and that too
about two years back. So please do not make the mistake of thinking that I
am quoting Sri Ramakrishna. I only write what comes from memory. But the
practical implementation of Sri Ramakrishna's teachings will lead anyone to
the same conclusion, in my opinion.
