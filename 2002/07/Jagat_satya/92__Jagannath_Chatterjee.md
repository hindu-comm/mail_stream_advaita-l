I stand corrected. It will be interesting to note that Swamiji was forced
to deliver only one lecture titled " In Defence of Hinduism" more to
convince orthodox Hindu's than the Europeans.

Then wherefrom the statements "...sell all you have and follow
me", "...eunuchs for Gods sake." The churches, we Hindus believe, have
distorted Christ.

Not in Bengal at least. The opposition Swamiji faced from orthodox
vaishnavites (because Sri Ramakrishna claimed to be a reincarnation of Sri
Chaitanya), the brahmins (for Swamiji being a kayastha and daring to be an
authority on Hinduism) and the tantrics (who claimed Swamiji had hijacked
their plank),proves this.

Cannot agree with you, Sir. Today's message from Kamakoti.org says advaita
opposes the other schools only to the extent those schools oppose advaita!
There is essentially no enmity between the philosophies.

It is true that the masses, both grihasthas and sannyasis (I am neither!),
were opposed to the activities of the R K Mission at first due to various
reasons. The young mass were disillusioned that the Mission did not join
the revolutionary movement against the British. The projection of Girish
Ghosh, notorious for his escapades, as an ardent devotee of Sri Ramakrishna
shocked the grihasthas. The sannyasis mocked the seva attitude of the
Mission and called the monks "bhangi" sadhus. But the Mission has today
gained acceptance among all classes.

Parodharma Bhayavaha! It is always better to stick to ones own spiritual
path. Being an ardent supporter of the advaita philosophy myself I
appreciate your stand and can only stand to gain from your views.

Regards

Jagannath
