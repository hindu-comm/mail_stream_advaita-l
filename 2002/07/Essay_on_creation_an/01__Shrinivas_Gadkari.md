Namaste Swarna Swamiji,

For a long time I have been trying to understand how
classical science and pauranic accounts fit together.

Later I moved from classical science to quantum theory
and from puranas to yoga and vedanta. Then things were
somewhat easier to reconcile. The essay uploaded at the
link is a summary of how in my opinion science and
yoga/vedanta/pauranic accounts fit together.

The article takes drshti-srshti-vada (see the homepage
of this list, under the topic creation) type approach.
(Although on surface it looks like dvaita.)

If I see some more interesting connections I will add
to them that essay.

Thanks for your interest.

Best regards
Shrinivas Gadkari
