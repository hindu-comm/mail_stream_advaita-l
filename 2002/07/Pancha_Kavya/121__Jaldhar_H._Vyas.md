The 5 mahakavyas plus Meghaduta are considered the essential works of
Sanskrit poetry.

They are:

Laghutrayi:

Meghaduta - Kalidasa - A Gandharva in exile sends a cloud messenger to his wife
Raghuvamsha - Kalidasa - The story of Shri Rama and His ancestors
Kumarasambhava - Kalidasa - The story of the birth of Kartikeya Bhagawan

Brhattrayi:

Kiratarjuniyam - Bharavi - The story of Arjuna and the hunter from Mahabharata
Naishadiyacharita - Sriharsha - The story of Nala and Damayanti
Shishupalavadha - Magha - The defeat of Shishupala by Krishna Bhagawan
                          from Mahabharata, Bhagavata etc.

There are many commentories on these but the ones by Kolachalli Mallinatha Suri
 are the most popular.
