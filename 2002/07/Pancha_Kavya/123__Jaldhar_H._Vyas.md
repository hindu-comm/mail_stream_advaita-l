I suppose mastery of the sanskrit language would make one better able to
understand the shastras but I'm not aware that they have any specifically
religious purpose though they are (with the exception of Meghaduta) all
based on stories from the shastras.  Shriharsha was also an influential
Advaitin, the author of khandanakhandakhadya.

Oh and it is a yaksha who is in exile in the Meghaduta not a Gandharva.
