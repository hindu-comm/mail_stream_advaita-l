                                                   I think you mean to say
that you are a Smartha...........if I am not mistaken. Because I have seen
many Iyers who wrongly identify themselves as Saivaites. Are u an Iyer? BTW,
your name sounds very Vaishnavaite!!! I havent heard of any Saivaite by the
name Srivatsan, while it is a very common name among Srivaishnavaas.

Kindly clarify.

Regards
Anand K
