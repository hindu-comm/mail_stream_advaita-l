Dear Vaidya Sundaram

Thank you for your email.  I am nearly 60 years of age and live in Buxton
in
England. My religious belief is most certainly Advaitin. I have known
about
Sankara's teachings for a very long while. At the age of 17 I acquired a
copy
of Rudolph Otto's book, "Mysticism East and West" which compares the
teaching
of  Sankara with that of  the medieval Dominican monk, Meister Eckhart.
Relatively recently I learnt about the life and teachings of Sri Ramana
Maharshi. Even from an old photograph of him you know that there is an
enlightened being looking out at you!

I shall probably not be able to contribute much to discussion but I would
very much like to be on your mailing list.

With Best wishes

Roger Floyd
