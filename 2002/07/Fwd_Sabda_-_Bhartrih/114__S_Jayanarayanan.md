The 8 letters y r l v sh SH s h are the only ones in
Sanskrit whose sounds can be sustained even without
another vowel, and are therefore called "semi-vowels".


You can easily sustain the sound "a" or "e" for a long
period of time, so they are vowels. You cannot sustain
the sounds "k" or "t" for a long time, therefore they
are consonants. Consonants require a vowel in order
that their sounds may be sustained (e.g."ka" or "ta").


You can sustain "y" or "s" for a long amount of time,
however they can also be coupled with a vowel (e.g.
"ya"), so they are "semi-vowels".

There are other sounds that can be sustained for long
periods, e.g. "n" and "m" but they require nasal
airflow for their sustenance, and so are not classed
as semi-vowels.

The above stuff is purely my personal understanding.
