Dear Sri Dave,

Namaskar.

Thank you for your posting. I have read a similiar
exposition on this subject by Sir John Woodroff
(Garland of letters, Ganesh Publications, Chennai).
However the book is extremely technical in its
treatment. Cannot the subject be handled more lucidly
?
You started off really well but the translation of the
verses went over my head. Please help.

Yours sincerely

Jagannath.
