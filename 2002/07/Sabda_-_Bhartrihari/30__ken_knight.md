I just had a thought about the maheshvAra sUtra. This
has 14  mini sUtras. If you can get hold of a copy of
Ashtadhyayi of Panini you will find the very first
verse is The PratyahAra sUtras. This may be what you
mean.  I am sure that a web search would reveal these
as the books may be difficult to get.  Unfortunately i
am still without a replacement broadband modem so am
stuck with an expensive sysyet at the moment so
web-searching cannot be done from home,

Let me know if this is what you are after and of any
interesting follow up
