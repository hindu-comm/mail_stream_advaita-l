Dear Nanda

I think you are mistaken about Appaya Dikshitar. I agree that he is a
smartha. But your calling him as ppart of the temple priests of Chidambaram
is not right. Please note that Dikshitar is a title given to a Vedic
practitioner who is a Agnihotri and performs Somayaagas like Vajapeya etc.
We have Dikshitars even today in Kumbakonam, Musiri etc who are no way
related to the Priests of Chidambaram. The famous Harikatha exponent,
Anantharama Dikshitar got this name because of his familial tradition as
conductors of Somayagams. Appaya is a Dikshitar (he is even called as
Dikshitendra) in this way.

Best regards,
anand K
