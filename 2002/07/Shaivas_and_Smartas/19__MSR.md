Paternal grand mother of Sri appayya diixita was a srivaishNava, that
to some extent had influence on Sri appaya and his ability to
impartially take a look at vaishhNava works.

This is reflected in the works of his (step) grandson Sri niilakaNTHa
dixita (I have read only one of his works which is titled
"aanandasaagarastava" on Sri miinaaxii amman - this work nicely
explains the concept of sharaNagati as it is viewed in
vishhishhTadvaita philosophy. We discussed only few verses of this text
on ambaa-L). I should say a million thanks to him, because with my
terrible anti-vaishhNava bias, I would not have looked at any
vaishnavite work on sharaNagati with an open mind. I needed someone
like him to explain it in the context of bhakti towards jaganmAtA.


Typically, the title diixita does not carry over from generation to
generation. Somewhere I read/heard that it can be kept only for 3
generations and given based on certain qualifications (diixa-s). I am
not sure though. Because, my family (for many generation in the
thanjaavuur area) once had diixita title. At least for the last three
or four generations, none of them have the diixita title (AFAIK).

The shaiva/vaishhNava division in TN is very deep and I would say it is
genetically coded now :-)). And with smArta-s, they wear attire like
shaiva-s, and their words show affiliation to vishhNu (right from
sandhya to naarayaNa smRti) and in heart most of them are ambaaL
bhakta-s. And that confuses the heck of out others :-)) and they all
have handful of quotes to show all three are same anyway :-)).
