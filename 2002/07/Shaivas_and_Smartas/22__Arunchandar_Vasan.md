Yes, Mahaaperiyavaa did visit the temple, and the protocol was waived for
him. That said, I have encountered Deekshitar as an earned surname in
pandits who officiate in samskaaras back in Madras. They do not have the
traditional shikaa associated with the Chidambaram Deekshithas. As
Vidyasankar pointed out, these people earn rather than inherit the title.
