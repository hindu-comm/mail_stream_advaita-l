I'm not sure what the contradiction is.

Mukti is obtained only when the mind is completely
destroyed (manonAsha). In that highest state, there is
no "inside" or "outside".

In kevala nirvikalpa samadhi, there is communion with
the Self, but the mind is alive, which means that the
world exists in the seed state and can be drawn out
again.
