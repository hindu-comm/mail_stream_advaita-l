Just one correction Kartik. It is not Parvati that Shiva is addressing, and
who later assumes the form of Sitaji, it is Sati, daughter of Daksha
Prajapati. It is because of Sati assuming the form of Sita, the beloved
wife of Shri Rama who even Shiva worships, that Shiva decided that he would
not treat Sati as his wife anymore even though he will not tell her to
leave Him. Sati later goes to the Yajna of Daksha Prajapati and seeing that
there were no offerings to her Lord Shiva, she jumps in the Yajna and is
burnt. She is re-born as Parvati in the house of Himavan.
