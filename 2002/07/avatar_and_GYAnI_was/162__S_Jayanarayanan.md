There are similar examples for the GYAnIs too.
Durvasa, the great GYAnI, once had to face the anger
of VishNu because he offended a VishNu-bhakta. He then
had to plead with the bhakta in order to be saved. I'm
sure there are many other instances in the scriptures.


As to your example of Sri Rama:

Ramana Maharshi once narrated the story of how Rama
was crying out for Sita after she was kidnapped by
Ravana. Seeing Rama behave this way, Parvati said to
Shiva, "I don't understand why people think Rama is a
great person when he is crying aloud for his wife like
an ordinary man." Shiva replied, "Rama is the supreme
being, and is merely acting like a man, you may test
him if you wish." So Parvati puts on the guise of Sita
and appears before Rama. Rama smiles at her and asks,
"Parvati, what are you doing here? Where is Shambhu?"
Parvati is ashamed and tells Rama that she wanted to
test him. Rama then asks her to return to Kailasa,
saying, "We are all thinking of Shiva all the time."

The story shows how an avatar may sometimes act like
an ordinary person, but in reality is not bound by
actions.
