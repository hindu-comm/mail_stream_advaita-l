There are some instances in the shastras which shows an avatar is not
always possessed of full knowledge (or appears not to be.)

For example:

When the earth was flooded and the knowledge of the Vedas was in danger of
bing lost, Vishnu Bhagawan became te boar Varaha and rescued them.  But
afterwards, he went "mad" and almost destroyed the worlds with his
rampages.  Shiva Bhagavan became the Saurabh (I'm not sure what kind of
creaure that is) and fought Him until He calmed down.

After Shri Rama brought Sitaji back from Lanka, he grew angry at Her and
accused Her falsely causing Her to enter the fire as a test of Her virtue.
The Devas led by Brahma and Indra had to come down from Heaven to remind
Him that He was no no mortal king but Vishnu Bhagawan Himself.
