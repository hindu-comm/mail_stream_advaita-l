What is the difference between a avatar and a
jIvanmukta that you've stated above? According to Sri
Ramana Maharshi, there are no differences between an
avatar and a GYAnI, at least according to "Talks". But
He doesn't dwell on the subject for long, and there
could be room for other interpretations also.

As an aside, I distinctly remember Sri Ramakrishna
saying that the difference between an avatar and a
GYAnI is in the manifestation of power.
