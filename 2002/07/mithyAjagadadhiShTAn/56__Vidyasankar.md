>Is this question dealt with in any of the Upanishads' commentaries by Sri
>Shankara or is the answer to this question available only in ancillary

Yes, these issues are spread through the commentaries, and there is
particularly one interesting discussion in the gItAbhAshya.

>WHOOPS!! No offence meant at all.  The only reason I wrote is that when

Oh, none taken! I just meant that sometimes it is better to let one person,
especially someone like Anand, to make a number of posts on such topics,
and then to go and re-read all of them, without interruptions.

But you do point out another valid concern about our discussions on this
list. Ravi has been mentioning it too, and that is that we must discuss the
textual matters more deeply, if only to assist our thoughts on such issues
as mithyAtva. I have been meaning to resume my effort at translating the
gItA commentary, but have been putting it off, due to work pressures. I'll
try to get the ball rolling on it soon.

Best,
Vidyasankar
