The discussion of mithyA does not end there. The further question is
whether said things exist at all. And in advaita vedAnta, we say that as
per the higher definition of the verb, "to exist" (the paramArtha satya),
only the independent reality exists.

Why the alas?!! One good writer and thinker like Sri Anand Hudli, who also
understands the texts really well, is quite good.
