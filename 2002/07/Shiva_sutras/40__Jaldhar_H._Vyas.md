Panini mentions several older authorities such as Shakalya, Shakatayana,
Atreya, etc.  Some of these authors are also know from other linguistic
Vedangas such as Shiksha.

There may have been some prior groundwork but such a full-blown and
intricate arrangement such as the ashtadhyayi has to be the work of a
single genius in my opinion.

That is an upasana or meditation which despite being located in an
upanishad is part of the karmakanda and thus any tradition about its' use
would be restricted to those qualified for it.  What did Swami
Nikhilananda say?

Respected Sri Vyas,

Namaskar.

Thank you for clearing my views on the subject.

However in passing I would clarify Sri Ramakrishna's
plunge into advaita vedanta under the able tutelage of
Totapuri, a staunch advaitin from North India. At
first Sri Ramakrishna was unable to dissociate himself
from the vision of Mother Kali which stood as a
stumbling block to his efforts to know the non dual
Absolute. This enraged Totapuri  and he pricked a
piece of broken glass inbetween the eyebrows of Sri
Ramakrishna and asked him to meditate by concentrating
on that point.  Sri Ramakrishna was then able to "cut
the image of Mother Kali" by the "sword of knowledge"
and thus soared into the non dual world of nirvikalpa
samadhi in which state he remained for three days at a
stretch before Totapuri, fearing the fall of his body,
brought him down to the world.

I don't shun from declaring Sri Sri Sankaracharya a
world teacher, even if it be from my "ignorance" (as
some have suggested). After attaining moksha there is
no sense of the teacher and the taught, I admit. But
what would have been our fate if Sri Sri Sankaracharya
and Bhagawan Sri Ramana Maharshi had not resorted to
this "ignorance" and turned a blind eye to this world
instead of cultivating compassion for the jivas mired
in this dual world !

Sri Sri Sankaracharya was not a dry intellectualist.
The verses in praise of various God's and Goddesses he
composed would melt the heart of stone. He is also
revered by the tantrics (or rather Sakti pujaks) for
his "Saundarya Lahari" and "Lalita Sahasranama". Sri
Sankaracharya also placed the Sri Chakra in the Sarada
Peetha (if I am not wrong). His experience at Kashi
which led him to compose the famous Annapurna Stotram
is well known.

Yours sincerely

Jagannath
