Hari Om !!

I was listening to some lectures of Swami Tattvavidananda of Arsha Vidya
Gurukulam. While it helped me to understand oneness behind all GOD forms,
it also generated some doubts.

The Swami repeatedly said, "there are only two type of accounts, one
Historical and the other Symbolic. There is no mythological account." On
several occassions, the talks conveyed that even the story of Bali,
Prahlada, and churning of milk ocean etc. is only symbolic. However, the
swami classifies Rama and Krishna as Historic.

I head similar talks/words from Swami Chinmayananda. Have any of you heard
similar ideas from Swami Dayananda.

Personally, I am not happy when I hear all such puranic stories as
symbolic, and also give just symbolic status to Vishnu, Siva, Brahma, Devi
etc. This can be a hindrance to Bhakti.

However, I read very encouraging and positive enforcing talks of HH Swami
Chandrasekhara Saraswati, describing these stories are real, though we can
not believe, etc.

What is the accepted Advaitic View on this subject. Please give me
references.

Om Namo Narayanaya !!
