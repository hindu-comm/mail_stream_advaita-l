First of all, do not think that I have to "lift"
quotations out of place. I have nothing to prove. I
only need more inputs from others to makeup my own
mind. I do respect the Swami's knowledge in Sanskrit
and Vedas. It has been of great help to me as I
listened to a few of his lectures. But, it is not
necessary that I accept whatever I hear, right ?? You
also know that scholarship in Chemistry is of no
particular advantage for Advaita knowledge, except for
makingup an understanding intellect of aparavidya.
Many 'uneducated' people grasp Advaita intuitively,
right ? I remember, "Devi Mahatmyam" calls this
Sattvic intelligence, by classifying intelligence
itself as Sattvic, Rajasic, and Tamasic.

Yes, I would ask him directly, when I feel more
comfortable to deal with it. At least, I have heard
him enough on this subject that I only need alternate
inputs.

The problem is that the present teaching is that there
are no Gods, and that is the higher teaching.

Your clarification about the views of SDS are helpful.

Ofcourse, I am also understanding that the entire
universe is an expression of Brahman.

My question was, when we read Puranas, we see
different 'Gods', as simultaneous and independent
'Beings'. They are expressions of Brahman, obviously.
But the question is whether they are 'imaginary'
characters created by our 'sages' to just convey
'spirituality', or they have 'reality' equavalent to
'me' or 'higher' than 'me' in the sense that they know
the 'reality'.

I started my original posting because the Swami's
words sounded as representation of the first case.

Om Namo Narayanaya !!

Srikrishna
