Exactly! Ramana Maharshi has answered the question
simply by saying, "The Gods are as real as you are in
this body." If one considers the Gods/Deities to be a
mere figment of the imagination, one must also accept
the perceived universe including one's body as a
figment of the imagination. So long as one identifies
oneself with the body, the Deities are very much real!


Here's the relevant extract from "Talks":

Q: "Are the Gods and Goddesses and their sacred
regions real?"

Bhagavan: "As real as you are in this body."

Q: "Do they possess phenomenal existence, like my
body? Or are they fictitious?"

B: "They do exist."

Q: "If so, they must be somewhere. Where are they?"

B: "Persons who have seen them say that they exist
somewhere. So we must accept their statement."

Q: "Where do they exist?"

B: "In you."

Q: "Then it is only an idea - that which I can create
and control?"

B: "Everything is like that."

[..]

Q: "Why are there so many Gods mentioned?"

B: "The body is only one. Still, how many functions
are performed by it ... It is the same way with the
Gods also."
