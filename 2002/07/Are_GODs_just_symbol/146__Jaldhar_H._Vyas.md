And you would be right.  It is not correct.  But that isn't what I said.
A story needn't be "cooked up", in fact I believe most of our puranic
kathas have at least a kernel of historicity to them, if not more.  But
their value is not in being a sequence of events just as the value of a
dollar bill is not in being a piece of paper but being a piece of paper
stamped by the US government.

Symbolism does not have to be a sop to the ignorant either.  That is just
one kind of symbolism called allegory which tries to explain complex
concepts by analogy to simpler ones.  For another type, look at
Mathematics.  That's entirely about symbols but is practiced by very
brainy people not peasants.  There is an influential style of philosophy
called semiotics that deals entirely with symbols and their significance.

I'll write a bit more about the Shastraic methods of interpretation when I
resume translating from the Mahabharata.

That Swami was asking the wrong questions so it is no wonder he got the
wrong answers.

In Valmiki Ramayana, it is Yuddhakanda, sarga 106.  Tulsidasji seems to
gloss over this.

At the end of the sarga Shri Rama tells the Devas that he made the
accusation only for 2)
