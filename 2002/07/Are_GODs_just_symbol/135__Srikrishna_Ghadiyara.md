Hari Om !!

Yes, I meant Swami Dayananda of Arsha Vidya Gurukulam.
However Sri Rajesh Sarin's posting is a welcome

I would urge the knowledgeable members of this list to
comment on the topic of 'mere symbolic status of Gods'
as per Advaita view. Comments from other Acharyas are
also appreciated.

Om Namo Narayanaya !!

Srikrishna
