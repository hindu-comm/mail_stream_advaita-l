The particulars of the tradition that many of us on the list follow may
not be your birthright and thus denied to you but the knowledge of Brahman
cannot because it is not a "thing" to be lost or acquired but the very
ground and essence of your being.  Any conscious being who engages in
self-reflection is capable of grasping that knowledge it is just a
matter of finding the most practical method.  So why be sad?
