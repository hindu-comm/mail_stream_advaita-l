Without doubt the correct Advaita position regarding knowledge and reality.

But one small clarification regarding tat vijn~naasasva - what's meant by
"inquiry into the nature of Brahman" here is only intellectual
discrimination between the real and unreal. It is with the right conception
of the absolute that the absolute can be achieved. With the right conception
of the absolute the aspirant rejects all that doesn't fit with the
conception of reality. But such enquiry cannot lead to reality by itself but
only helps in killing ignorance and ultimately leads to chitta vritti
nirodah. The Self shines by itself - forever and everywhere.
