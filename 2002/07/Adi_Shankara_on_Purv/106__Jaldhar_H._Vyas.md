I believe there are two pre-Sayanacharya commentators on Rk Samhita,
Skandaswami, and Shadgurushishya.  I don't know which sampradaya they
belong to and I think their bhashyas are not complete.  As is often the
case in Sanskrit literature, Shayanacharyas' monumental work eclipsed all
predecessors.

Many of the famous Mimamsakas have been Advaitins in their sannyasa
ashrama.  But I don't know if they wrote Vedabhashyas.
