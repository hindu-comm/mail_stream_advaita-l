Namaskaram.
 In the introduction to the naaraayaneeyam of Shri Narayana Bahttatiri, the
commentator mentions that he was also a great scholar and grammarian. One of
his works of great poetry (apart from the naaraayaneeyam ofcourse), was
another work called Dhatu Kavya in which the author is said to have
expounded the rules of grammar and dhatu's in a kavya on Shri Krishna,
making it easy for all to remember the words/phrases etc. and also have a
rich devotional experience at the same time!!
 If anyone is aware of any copy of this being available for sale, I would be
grateful. Thanks.
