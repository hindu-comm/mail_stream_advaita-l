Got your message Sir. Believe me, I have a tremendous
regard for Sri Shankaracharya. But the enquiring mind
keeps on hitting some aspects of the old school. When
we argue against some school it does not always mean
that one is trying to establish the viewpoints of
another. As I told you earlier I scour this list only
to gain knowledge about advaita.
