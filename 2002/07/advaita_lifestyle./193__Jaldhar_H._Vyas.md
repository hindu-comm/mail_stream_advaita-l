After reading Sadanandas' post, I think I should clarify some of what I
worte on the subject.

I agree there is no Advaita lifestyle in the sense of a set of actions
that can produce knowledge of Brahman.  (Because Brahman always just is.)
But that doesn't mean all actions are equal.  Some help remove the
obstacles that prevent the knowledge of Brahman from shining forth.
Others only mire one deeper into ignorance.  The former must be practiced and
they may be called the lifesyle of a seeker after jnana.
