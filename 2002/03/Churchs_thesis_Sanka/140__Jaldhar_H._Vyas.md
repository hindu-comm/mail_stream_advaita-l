I missed one phrase "that can determine".

"It is not a case that there is a logical argument A in a human language L
that can determine that for a given input instruction I, a human being H
who
thinks the language L on receiving the input I, would eventually attain
liberation and stop thinking."

I am an Iyer Smartha Brahmin from Tamilnadu, India. I live with my wife and
twin daughters in Sunnyvale, CA, USA. I am religious, though not well versed
with the scriptures. I have read some of the writings of Kanchi seer though.
I hope to learn from the list members more about Advaita philosophy.

Thank you and regards,
Venkataramani K.
