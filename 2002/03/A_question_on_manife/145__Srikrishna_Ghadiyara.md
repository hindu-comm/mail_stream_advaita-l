Here are two important points to note, in this
regards:

1. Swami Sivananda while explaining this point said,
"Even in dream  the dreamer and the other dream
participants see only one Sun, Moon, etc. Just like in
'waking' state. So, both have equal 'reality'"
 Of course, we all know that in dream we do not
consider the dreams of other people. All that one
dreams is the world.

2. The same question was raised by Sri Rama and Sage
Vasishta gives the reason as "Kakataliyam".

A crow (Kaka) came and sat under a Tala tree. At the
same time a Tala fruit dropped from the tree. It fell
on the crow and it died. Here we should not ascribe a
cause and effect relationship. It is just accidental ,
Kakataliyam. So, also, all the beings see the same
world, accidentally.

Om Namo Narayanaya !!

Srikrishna
