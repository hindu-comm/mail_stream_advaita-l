namaste.

What I mean by kAlamAna is a measure of time. What I meant by the
above was: The jAgrat avastha has its own scale of time. The svapna
avastha has its own time-scale. A five-minute dream (in the wake-up
time scale) my span a full life-time during the dream time-scale.
The wake-up time scale disappears during the dream and the dream
time-scale disappears during the wake-up state. Thus, I would take
it that the kAla, the time, is included in the avastha.
