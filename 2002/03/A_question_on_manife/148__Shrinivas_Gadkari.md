Dear Shrinivas, Kindly clarify as to what exactly you mean by senses
and elements respectively?

Hari Om!

Swaminarayan

--------------------------
Dear Swaminarayan,

Senses refer to the five jnanendriyas, viz. the indriyas
associated with hearing, touch, taste, smell and sight.
Elements refer to the respective mahabhutas, viz, space,
air, water, earth and light.

Dear list members, would really appreciate your responses.
The first part relating to senses is relatively straight
forward. However how elements in dream state relate to
elements in wake up state is not obvious. My suspicion is
that the mapping is many-to-one.

Best regards
Shrinivas Gadkari

Strictly speaking reflection is part of Jiva.
Jiva = Reflection + Kutastha

because Jiva is reflection plus something, i.e. Kutastha.

No, Jiva is not different. In our discussions, we identify these
two entities because of their different nature.
In our marriage ceremony, Mama (mother's brother) has certain
function during Kanyadana (giving away the bride). A Mama was
late, so the priest and everyone concerned said, "Where is Mama?
Why Mama is late?" even though they knew his name. Becasue that
person had Upadhi of "Mama", he is identified as such. So is Jiva
having Upadhi of Avidya, talked about as if a separate entity
from Atman.

Work is done by chidabhasa, but because it becomes active only
due to presence of Kutastha, we say that work is done by Jiva
(i.e. Chidabhasa + Kutastha).

The analogy of Sun given above is to show this "directorship"
relation. In Taittiriya Up. we have this famous mantra :

{\skt aha.m v.rk.sasya rerivaa .... }
[I am the director of the Tree of menifestation ....]

Yes, you are right.

Vijnanamaya is called Jiva taking into account the Jagrata
and Swapna avastha [Viveka. 189]
{\skt bhu.nkte ....}

Doubt :  the shloka includes Sushupti also, because it  says
    {\skt svapnaadyavasthaa ...}
Reply : Yes, but as a null experience. When one is woken
up from deep sleep, one says , " I was happily asleep. I did
not know anything."
The first sentence is from anandamaya,the second from
Vijnanamaya.

True, Ahamkara is a function of Manomaya, as far as the
waking state is concerned, but notice two points here :
(i) Manomaya is activated (seems to be chetana) only due to
Vijnanamaya, which in turn due to chidabhasa.

(ii) in non-waking (introspective, meditative or pure pleasure)
states, Ahamkara, Ego, is present but Manomaya is not active.

In summary, through proper perception of "I" Ego, occurs at
Manomaya, it happens so because of the Reflection.

No, Ego is not Jiva, only a result of Jiva-hood.

In deep sleep only Anandamaya is active. Or, to maintain
consistency with Vivekachudamani, Vijnanamaya is active
but having a null experience.
Please refer the following chart from posting no. 3

Some Acharyas include Antahkarana in Jiva and some
do not (as I have done following Swami Vidyaranya.)

Some General comments before we summarize :
you should understand that the vocabulary as used by me
(defined rather precisely in Panchadasi) is called "modern"
vocabulary and is more or less standard for Vedantins of
a date later than Adi Shankara.
If you compare older texts with the later, there will be
some variations, though the general porport will be
the same. Try to understand the implied meaning or
definition.
E.g. in Viveka chudamani, in 191, Jiva is used to mean Atman,
but later the word Jivabhava distinguishes it from Atman. In
208 Vijnanamaya is called Jada, though earlier it was called
Jiva.


Summarizing all the above :
1.    In deep sleep only Anandamaya is active. It has knowledge of
its own happiness.  This leaves a residual memory in itself. It is
through this residue that we say "I was happily asleep."
"I did not know anything" comes due to the null experience in
Vijnanamaya.

2.     In 186 {\skt  buddhirbuddhiindriyai.h ...} the word Vijnanamaya
is used for both Vij. and Anandamaya. It is being used as locus of
"I" v.rtti.  As usual human experience is during waking state, the
Vijnanamaya is the innermost "I" in that state (except when we
are extremely happy or meditating).
The chetana of Abhasa is ported to Vijn. and is included as a part of
Jiva. Without chidabhasa, Vijn. can not be active, so this definition
of Jiva, i.e.
Jiva = Vijnanamaya + Kutastha
is not entirely inconsistent with the previous definition given.

Also, note that Vivekachudamani discusses from view point of
search for real "I" starting with the gross body. Till ignorance
is removed and Self is known, it is Vijn. which poses as "I", an
imposter for the Self. That is why it is identified in these verses
as Jiva.
In verse 189 it is explained why Vijn. is taken to be Jiva.
