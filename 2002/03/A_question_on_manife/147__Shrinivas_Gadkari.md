Namaste All,

Here are a few more points to contemplate on:

Does one have senses in deep sleep ?
No.

Does one have senses in dream state ?
Yes.

Does one have senses in wake up state ?
Yes.

What then is the relation between the senses in
dream state and that in the wake up state ?

Now go through the same Q&A only replace senses by
elements.

Best regards
Shrinivas Gadkari
