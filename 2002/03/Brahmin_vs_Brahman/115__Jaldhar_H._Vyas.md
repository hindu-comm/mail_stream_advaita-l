The inflections are different because the gender is different but the root
word is the same.

Aptes' dictionary gives a couple more meanings of brahmana which I missed.

* omkara

* the splendor or power of a Brahmana (i.e. synonym for brahmavarchas)

* celibacy (i.e. a synonym for brahmacharya)

* The supervising priest of a shrauta yagna (Can belong to Atharvaveda or
  any other Veda)

* ... and a number of others such as hymn, moksha, tapa, wealth which seem
to be secondarily derived from one of the other meanings.
