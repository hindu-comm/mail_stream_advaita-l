There is a clear phonetic difference between Brahman (the supreme spirit)
and BraahmaNa or BraahmaN (the priest).

Note that the first "a" in Brahman is short, pronounced like the "u" in
"but", while the "aa" in BraahmaNa is long, pronounced like the "a" in
"far".

The last "n" in the Brahman is the same as the "n" in "agni", but the "N"
in BraahmaN is pronounced like the "N" in "kaNTha".
