Sorry to be late, I had to manage a National Students Meet
for about 800 students, and became engrossed in sa.msaara !!!

So the observer is one more Ajnani?

What happens after the first contact of the planets
surface with that of  The Sun?

Actually though such analogy helps somewhat in understanding
the process by which a person becomes a Jnani from being
Ajnani, the actual process is not such a linear progression.  After
the first contact with Sun (I fully agree with your use of Sun as
an analogy for Atman - it is in agreement with RigVeda), there
are doubts, pulling back to samsaara by Maya, etc. Then again after
further enquiry/meditation/help from a Guru another contact may be
established.
Thus the progress is not linear but jerky. In RigVeda this
is aptly described as jumps of a grass-hopper.

Agreed. But what happen when he - a human being -becomes
a luminary?

Agreed.

1.  I think we have to understand the role of Prarabdha
    Karma well, because it is in terms of this that the
    still existing sharira of a jiivanamukta is explained.

2.  Is a Jnani same as a Jiivanamukta or not?

I think I will try to demonstate the limitation of the
binary theory in my main posting (no. 13) which I
plan to send out shortly.

The problem is - logic  or our normal day-to-day
analogies can not help us here. Any analogy is
based on Duality and we are trying to describe
something which does not leave anything else!
