Very nicely put Ken.  The silence of bhagawan Dakshinamurti is not the
same as the silence of a person not posting to the list.*  It is not a
lack of communication but a communication of something quite profound.
So the necessity of interpretation is the same as with any book.  On
this auspicious Shivaratri** let us us worship Him by thinking deeply
about His message to the world.


* like Himanshubhai who through circumstances beyond his control is unable
to post to the list right now.  So maybe we should postpone questions for
him until he returns.

** Ravi is correct that strictly speaking Shivaratri was yesterday in US
time zones but most of the local Mandirs seem to be following Indian
practice.
