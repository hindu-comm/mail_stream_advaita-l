Om Namh Sivaya. Thanks for the slokas. This is the
benefit of Satsang, since knowledgeable readers will
correct us. However, I still have a doubt. Kindly
clarify.

I present you an analogy. Light represents knowledge,
so let us say Sun is Jnani. A planet is a non-luminous
body, so we call it Ajnani. Now let us assume that the
planet is moving closer and closer to the sun. To a
distant observer, the planet now appears brighter and
brighter(by the reflected light) and may look like a
luminous body. However, till it actually falls into
the sun and loses its identity, a careful observer
will be able to differentiate the two objects.
Similarly a highly intelligent Sadhaka may appear to
be a Jnani but without the destruction of the ego he
doesn't become a luminary.

Another analogy. Let us think of a man bound by a
number of ropes. Slowly a rat (Sri Ganesha's vahanam,
can certainly help the Sadhaka's struggle for freedom
if He is pleased), starts nibbling at the ropes. As
the different ropes are cut away, the freedom of the
person to move his different limbs increases until he
is almost free, but till the last rope is severed, he
is still bound.

If we equate a Jnani with a Jeevanmukta, then to my
uninitiated intellectual mind, it still represents a
binary situation. Almost bright, almost free is not
the same as luminous, and free. From black to white,
we are moving. A faint grey is still white tinged with
a slight blackness. I would call such a person an
adept, a great Sadhaka.

Sorry if I have erred in logic. I would like to be
corrected. And it is a sign of my ego which likes to
intellectualise without experiencing the union,the
fusion.

Thanks again.

Sri Gurubhyo Namaha

All:

      Please see attached from Sri Yegnasubramanian regarding the MahArudram
event scheduled for the upcoming Memorial Day weekend. The planning for this
event requires the participants' headcount as soon as possible. So, please send
your response to Sri. Vishwanathan Iyer at gv_iyer at hotmail.com or to Sri Venkat
Iyer immediately. If you have already responded to Sri Venkat Iyer's e-mail, you
could keep this as reference.

     Regards,

Ram Ramachandran

>As was announced during last year's Maharudram, we plan to have this year's
Maharudram on Sunday, the 26th May.

participate. I have the following options:

on 5/26 (most desirable)
>
>b) If the number of participants are less than (a), and if people don't mind
coming to Stroudsburg for two consecutive days, we will do it on 5/25 and 5/26
(Saturday and Sunday); arrangements for accommodation have to be made by
participants; (some accommodation will be available for volunteers and some
out-station participants); involves lot of planning and preparation (less
desirable option)
>
>c) If the response is poor, in place of Maharudram, only laghururdam will be
conducted on any convenenint weekend, or along with the week end functions of
Sankara Jayanti or Vardhanti. (Personally, I will be very disappointed if the
Maharudram has to be replaced in this manner due to lack of participation by the
beneficieries of all my veda classes, past and present; I can always understand
personal, professional commitments or health related reasons)

of performing Maharudram every year; I cannot make a samklapam and go through
the preasure of fullfilling it everytime in a painful manner.
