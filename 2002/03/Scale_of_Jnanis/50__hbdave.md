I think it is very difficult to say that Jnani/Ajnani forms
a binary system.

What would be exact definition of a Jnani?

Please consider this :

In Bliss of Non-Duality (Brahmanande advaitananda), Swami
Vidyara.nya says : (Translation by Swami Swahananda) :

saccidaanandaruupe .a sminpuur.ne brahma.ni viik.site |
svayamevaavajaanaati naamaruupe "sanai.h "sanai.h      ||   [80]

With direct knowledge of Brahman - the Eternal Existence, Consciousness
and Bliss, names and forms slowly  come to be disregarded.

yaavadyaavadavaj~naa syaattaavattaavadiik.sa.nam |
yaavadyaavadviik.sate tattaavattaadubhe tyajet          ||  [81]

The more duality is negated, the clearer the Realization of Brahman
becomes,
and as realization becomes perfected names and forms come to be
disregarded of themselves.


tadabhyaasena vidyaayaa.m susvitaayaa.m pumaan |
jiivanneva bhavenmukto vapurastu yathaa tathaa   || [82]

When through the continuous practice of meditation, a man is established

in the knowledge of Brahman, he becomes liberated even while living.
Then
the fate of his body does not matter.


NOw, consider a person described by  [80] or [81] above, while he has
not yet
reached "perfection" (whatever it may be). Is he a Jnani or not?
