I got the following message from the Webmaster of kamakoti.org. This is
something we were trying for (last year), it is indeed a good fortune
that kamakoti.org has come forward to do it by itself.

(BTW, now kamakoti.org has nice Tamil (font) section)

 Namaskaram to All!

 Subscribing link at bottom of this email.

 "Deivatthin Kural" is a book in Tamil, which is a collection of
speeches of
His  Holiness Sri Chandrasekharendra Saraswathi MahaSwamiji of the
Kanchi
Kamakoti Peetham.

 Two volumes from this book had been translated into English and
published by
the Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, titled "Hindu Dharma".

 As some of you may know, the entire book is available on the web site
http://www.kamakoti.org/. Recently, we have also launched an  automated
mailing
list service that will email a page from the book  daily/weekly,
commencing from
 a particular section.

 This follows requests by some users who had mentioned that it would be
easier
for them to read the book were it to be sent by email.

 Those who are interested in subscribing may do so at
http://kamakoti.org/feedback/sendhindudharma.php


 Suggestions/ criticism about this service is welcome.

 Best regards

 Venkatesh
