I have found the book
"Shri Vichara Sagara"
by Mahatma Nishchaladasaji

very useful for understanding various prakriyas of Vedanta.
I use a Gujarati translation and was trying to find if an
Engish translation is avilable. After some search I found as follows :

Lala Shreeram :
"Vichar Sagar - The Metaphysics of the Upanishads, translated"
H. Dhole, Calcutta, 1885 404 pages.

Further serach on Google gave me this :
