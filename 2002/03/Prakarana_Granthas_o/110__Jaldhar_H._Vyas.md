Actually there was one Bhaskara Mishra who thought that.  He was supposed
to have been a near contemporary of Shankaracharya and taught a variety of
bhedabhedavada.  His ideas didn't go anywhere and his Gita commentary
only exists today as a fragment.  But you're right the Vedantic mainstream
does not treat it as such.

As Ashisha said, this comes from Muktikopanishad.

Unfortunately I haven't heard anything further from anyone about this
subject since the last time it came up.  What someone ought to do (are you
volunteering? :-) is to find Upanishad Brahmendrajis' commentary, see if
it is the same text as others going by that name and whether his
interpretation of it is the same as what was mentioned.

All I know is the first time this upanishad came to public notice was in
"Principal Upanishads" translated by S. Radhakrishnan.  And whatever his
talents as a politician were, he is totally untrustworthy as a guide to
Sanatana Dharma.
