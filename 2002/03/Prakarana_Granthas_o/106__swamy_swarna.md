Hari Om. I would like to respond to this part of the
mail.

May be it is good for the intellect to get unsettled
so that it can shake off any dirt accumulating and get
a fresh perspective! If what someone says as Pramana
does not appeal to one's understanding at that point,
one doesn't really accept it, though one may pretend
to accept.

Suppose a small child is told that the earth is round
like a big ball. His 'limited' perception clearly
tells him that the earth which is visible to him is
'flat'. Only when he grows up and goes to a great
height, does he actually experience the roundness of
the earth. Better to be non-believing and questioning
in a state of real interest to learn the truth, than
to blindly accept something as the truth.

Truth has to be experienced. No amount of bookish
knowledge will help, at the most it may prepare the
intellect to see the truth from various perspectives
and integrate the different perspectives.
