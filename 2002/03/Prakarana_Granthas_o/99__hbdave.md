I also generally tend to agree with Ken.
If one is studying for academic discussions only, then
analysis of authorship, date, history, place where
composed etc.may be of importance or relevance.

If one is using the text for insights, does it matter
very much who wrote it?

The subject matter which we are talking about is
such that, beyond certain level, the seeker him/her
self is able to judge.

Also, is it not a tradition in our country that a pupil
follows the path indicated by the guru strictly? Why
doubt bonafides of the pupil?

Remember, doubts will do you more damage than the
doubtful authorship/text.

Of course, the text under consideration should pass
the scrutiny regarding adherence to general direction
of original teaching.

Remember the 24 gurus of Dattatraya? Learn from
whatever source you feel is able to push you a little
along the Path. No one has absolute monopoly of
the Key.
I hope I am not offending anyone by saying so.

That is my opinion (again from experience.)
