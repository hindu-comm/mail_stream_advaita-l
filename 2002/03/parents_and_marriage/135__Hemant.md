Namaste All,
           Analogies are a device to illustrate an aspect of the Brahman.
They cannot exhaust the Brahman in its totality and transcendence. But here
we find people pressing this or that analogy with a literal and scholastic
insistence.
Sankara says "vAco vibhanti nikhilA yadanugraheNa" when referring to the
Brahman.By Whose grace words shine, let us put our sraddha in That alone.
                 with best regards,
                                 alakha niranjana,
                                       Hemant
