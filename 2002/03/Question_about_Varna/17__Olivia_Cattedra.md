Dear list members


Having in mind those principles which support the dinamic of dharma, (S.
Radhakrishna, spurces of dharma ,  on Hindu Dharma, in Religion and society,
London 1955) I would suggest that these dialogue between Yudhishthira and
the rakshasa could de interpreted in the following sense:
 since these days are so deeply obscure and confuse in our world, just the
possibility (or at least, the possibility)  of having in mind and act
according to universal laws and to hold to inner forces of the spirit, the
remembrance of the sacredness of life,  to consider the unity, the love, the
ahimsa principle, the unity of all beings , the beauty of this creation, and
from that, to remain faithful to the own svadharma, that can be understood
as a brahmanic character
sincerely,
