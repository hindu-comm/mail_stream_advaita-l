It is to be noted that attitudes and ideas were different in the days of
Yudishtra than they are today. In those days it was pretty much clear that a
brahmana is one who is born so. So Yudishtra's statement might only mean
that though one can be born as a brahmana, be educated in the scriptures
etc, still it is only due to one's character/conduct that one proves oneself
as a true brahmana - character is what cements the caste status.
