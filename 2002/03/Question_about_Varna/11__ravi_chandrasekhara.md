Dear Fellow List members,

>From our Shastras, varna is birth-based and this
reiterated in Hindu Dharma at www.kamakoti.org  If
this being the case, why are there references that
seems to cantradict this.  For example in the
Mahabharata, there is a discussion btween Yudishtara
and a Gandharva (if remember correctly), refers to
varna not being birth-based ?  Thanking you all in
advance for responses.

Pranam Ravi Chandrasekhara MD
