Namaskaara,

I'd it in mind since a long time to join the group, since many a times I
used to land on the advaita vedAnta website through search engines on topics
of interest. I'm a 26 year old, born and brought in Bombay, and now in
Bangalore since around 1.5 years. I work in the software engineering
industry and am deeply interested in following the spirtual path, with God's
grace.

It is now that I decided that its good to have satsanga even on mail and
have your spiritual doubts clarified from similar minds, get logical
analysis on understanding Veda and Vedanta sutras when stuck up. I think its
with the grace and blessings of Lord & Guru and association of satsanga, in
this case, the group, that one can tread the path to advaita or Oneness.
