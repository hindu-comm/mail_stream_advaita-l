In Tamil, there is no written difference between "k", "kh", "g", "gh" and
"h". Hence you find people writing and sometimes even (mis)pronouncing
"Mahaalakshmi" as "Magaalakshmi". I think it's simply a matter of a
Sanskrit word being "Tamilized".

I have heard that the seed from Shiva was hot and so had to be cooled by
the river Ganga, and then Subrahmanya was born...or something like that...
Learned members who're devotees of Subrahmanya should be able to clarify.

-Kartik (aka Gaangeya :-))
