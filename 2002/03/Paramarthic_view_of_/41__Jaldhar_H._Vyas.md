This question has been raised in the Jivanamuktiviveka of Swami
Vidyaranya. An opponent of the idea of jivanamukti (being liberated while
still living) asks why is it that one of these supposed jivanmuktas still
needs to eat, breathe sleep etc?  The anser is like when you are driving
and you suddenly hit the brakes.  There is not an immediate stop but the
car rolls on a little owing to its' forward momentum.  With karma too
there is a residual momentum.  This is called prarabdha karma.  But from
the moment of jnana there is no new karma being produced.  So perhaps it
is inaccurate t say a jnani doesn't get hungry but he is indifferent to
hunger and non-hunger.
