Bell Gregg - please think deeply.  You can see
yourself the problems in your questions - If you know
you are the one only person in the world then the next
qestion does not arise.
Hence there is difference in 'understanding as a
thought' versus 'understanding as a fact'. Hence it is
called vij~naanam - that understanding supported by
experience rather than j~naanam - just intellectual
understanding. That indeed is manifestation of maaya!

Now you are back to duality.  Most of the confusion
arises when we keep one leg in the absolute reality
and other leg in the transactional reality and ask
questions one in relation to the other.  We need to
make sure from what reference the discussion is being
made. If that is clear all the questions will resolve
correctly.
