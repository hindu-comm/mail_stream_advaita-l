Moha is delusion - that involves taking the illusory
perception of plurality (that is maaya) as reality.
This error (adhyaasa) is due to ignornace of not
knowing the truth.

Otherwise it is pure projection of the pluarality as
the glory of the God - It becomes his aiswaryam - A
realized soul sees the plurality but does not have
moha to take that plurality as reality.  He
understands that the substratum of the plurality is
only the consciousness.
Hari OM!
