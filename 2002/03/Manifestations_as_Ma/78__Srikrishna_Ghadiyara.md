Hari Om !!

Your question can be mis-leading and ultimately very
distructive. I am sure learned members will repsond
appropriately. Here is my note.

1. There is no 'Maya' separate from Brahman.

2. Vishnu and Kali are as real or as Maya as I and
you. i.e as long as I and you exist Vishnu and Kali
also exist. When I am you become one with
consciousness then Vishnu and Kali may not exist
separately.

3. For one who has transcended the creation, every
thing is un-real from that plane, just as dream and
dream-objects become unreal after waking up.

4. Maya is not some kind of magic.

Om Namo Narayanaya !!

Srikrishna
