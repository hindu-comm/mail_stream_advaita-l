This is OK.

[My copy is slightly different, but it does not matter.]
Let us call awareness as Atman, because we are using
awareness in dualistic meaning (one entity is aware
of another.)

Yes. There should not be any confusion here.
What you call "sukshma sharira" contains the
chidabhasa as the controlling part.
Chidabhasa is like a king. When we say a "king"
it also includes his retinue, bodyguards etc. A king
should have his "kingness".
Similarly, here if you say sukshma sharira (which
includes sense organs, antahkarana, etc) is same
as chidabhasa.

Though some Acharyas take jiiva to be consisting of
only the reflection, it creates  logical problems while
explaining oneness of Jiva with Ishvara.
That is why

Jiva = abhasa + sakshi (kutastha)

In Tattvabodha also, the second sentence " the Atman
conditioned by Avidya is called Jiva" shows that sakshi
(Atman) is at the basis of Jiva.
This should not confuse you as Anandamaya (Abhasa)
by itself can not exist and the basis - sakshi - must be
there.

"standard" definition :
<-------- jiiva ------------>
|  chidabhasa |  sakshi or Kutastha   |

While we are discussing various aspects of the One and only
Atman, we say that Atman/Brahman, which is conditioned by
Avidya is Jiva and the underlaying basis is Atman (what you
are calling  Jivatma)
Paramatma = Brahman = Uttama Purusha

No. The final knower is Atman = Kutastha = Sakshi

Sahasrara - is not a place, it it a state of nervous energy;
it is equivalent to Abhasa.
Saying "Paramatma is in Sahasrara" is equivalent to
saying chadabhasa is reflection of Atman.

Yes, all these !!! But realize that all of them have a common
basis - Atman.
Though we are talking about a very simple thing, myself,
Atman, things get complicated and confusing because in
our search for the real "I", many imposters - so to say -
interpose themselves, claiming to be "I". We have to
identify and sort them out.

I hope with what has been given above, makes it all
clearer.

Abhasa goes through the Avasthatraya and Abhasa knows
them.
Atman "knows" everything simply as "I am".

Your questions on posting no. 6 are interesting
and I would like to explain them in detail.
I shall post them tomorrow.

So till then, my friend,

Om namO nArAyaNa.

  I've the following questions. I had asked a few based on "prajayA
hi manushyaH pUrNaH". These are more are less related to that.   Any
references to the parent child relationship in shruti ?   Why does shruti say "mAtru devO BavaH"  and "pitru devO BavaH" ?   Arent they
maya too ?

  When its brahman everywhere, hows marriage meaningful ?  If people
belonging to the same gOthras themselves cannot get married , then
what about the fact that all the rishis are    (from) one single
brahman ? In which case how can getting married be justified ? Is
this a reason why elders advise that we shouldnt try to figure out
the rishi mUlam ?
