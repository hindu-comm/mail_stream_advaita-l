I have very little  left to achieve  [I have reached the level of my
inefficiency -
as Peterson would have said :-)],
but, here I am trying to clarify the confusion that statement can create.

That is your derivation and NOT actual words of Acharya.

This is baadhasaamaanyaadhikara.nyam
Just as all the attributes of the beggar are not to be conveyed to
the king in the sentence "this beggar is the king", in saying
this Kutastha is said to be akshara, all attributes that you
apply to akshara are not necessarily applicable to Kutastha.

This is your derivation. What is the meaning of the word "is"
in your above equation?

Thanks, but one need to consult subcommentaries, sub-subcommentaries
etc only if one is not clear in his mind. No disrespect meant to swamiji.

OK.

There are three major points here :

(1)    We should realize that the vocabulary of Advaita Vedanta became
stabilized only after Adi Shankara.
Depending  upon the Shastra he was commenting upon, Acharya has used words
rather flexibly. The sub-commentaries etc. are trying to explain  uktam,
unuktam
and duruktam in his commentary.
Also the words used in texts like Giita are to be specially interpreted to
make them
match with more recent usage.

Those who have studied these extensive literature of sub-commentaries, tika,
etc.
should avoid confusion created by pointing out the variations in vocabulary.
We
should try to discuss in terms of a standardized nomenclature, as far as
possible, as
a consideration to new-comers to the field.

(2)  There are 3 places (as far as I know) where the word "kutastha" is used
in Giita
[VI-8, XII-3 and XV-16]  Acharya has explain them as :

VI-6 : kutastha - {\skt aprakampya.h} - steadt, non-varying;
XII-3 : kutastha - as characterization of {\skt ak.saram} - {\skt acintyam
avyaktam}
                {\skt tasmin kuu.te sthita.m kuu.tastha.m tadadhyak.satayaa
|}
                {\skt athavaa raa"si.h iva sthita.m}
XV-16 : we are discussing this use.

Thus it is seen that elsewhere in Giita also, Acharya has NOT called
Kutastha as Maya, but has said, as one of the meaning, that Kutastha
is adhyaksha - controller - of Maya.
The same meaning has to be taken for XV-16.

(3)    Shankara's commentary refers to akshara only. The link between
Kutastha and akshara is by {\skt badhasaamaanaadhikara.nyam}
{\skt kuu.tastha ak.sara.h ucyate} thus the attributes of Mayashakti
apply to akshara and not to Kutastha. Kutasth is adhyaksha of Maya.

Best to all.
