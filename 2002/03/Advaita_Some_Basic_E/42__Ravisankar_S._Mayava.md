Respected Sri H. B. Dave

Let me first thank you for this series.

If possible, can you give theme/details of your book.

Merudanda and these naadi-s are initimately connected to the spine of
the body. For instance, kriya yoga uses this connection for moving the
praNa by the power of will along sushumna. Practice of few kriya-s
correctly -- leads to mental calmness, and gives the ability to
meditate - the results are there and undeniable.  The link between
physical spine and merudanda on which chakra-s are located, I think, is
taken for granted in yoga.  The traditional praNayama done during
sandhya can also be done as kriya praNayama and one can link it with
movement of praNa along sushumna. I believe (my belief) that is the
best way to do praNayama.

Hence, I do not completely agree with the statement about "wrong
translation."  This has some link in osteopathic medicine also. I
recently heard a reference to work by Sutherland on "primary
respiration"  (in the audiobook Spontaneous Healing -- in the context
of Dr. Fulford's healing techniques). I personally believe that
movement of praaNa is closely linked to health and disease (incorrect
movement).

naaDi-s are not compeletely one side of  sushumna. For iDa starts at
the left side  of muulaadhaara and  but ends up finally on the right
nostril. And pingala starts at the right side and ends up in the left
nostril. They cross each other every chakra. (this I write from
memory).

There is good discussion on this subject in saubhAgya bhAskara -- a
commentary on lalitAsahasranAma. I am sure you are aware of this. In
any case - the discussion is under the name "paraa".

Can you elaborate -- to the extent possible -- on this principle of
vaShaTkAra. That will help us to at least think about it. The notion
"pre-Vedic", is it not a by product of western thinking?

Some Tamil traditions think Tamil was coeval with Sanskrit, and  both
emanated from the drum of shiva.


Thank you.


Sincerely,
Ravi
