I think you are right there.  Perhaps what is confusing is is that the
Samkhya/Yoga darshana uses the terms Purush and prakriti in a dualistic
sense.  The Purusha is the knowing jiva and completely distinct
from prakriti which is the natural universe and is insentient.  Vedanta,
particularly Advaita Vedanta, doesn't view Prakrti as a distinct entity
but equates it as maya which is produced by Brahman as Ishwara or the
individual atma.
