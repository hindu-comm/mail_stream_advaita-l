Dear Shri Sarma,

Here is my understanding:

What is being referred to here is akshara purusha. Now purusha,
in a dualistic darshana would mean Being. However, from a non-dual
viewpoint, we have to interpret purusha as a STATE OF BEING.

It is very important to note that prakriti/maya lacks consciousness
and can never be termed purusha be it a dualistic or non-dualistic
viewpoint. In light of this fact, identifying kutasatha with maya
shakti is very serious error. Unfortunately my ability at sanskrit
is very limited and hence am not in a position to understand what
shri Sankara says in his commentry. I will be really surprised to
learn that indeed shri Shankara has referred to prakriti/maya as
a purusha.

What Shri Dave said earlier makes much more sense. If kuta (heap)
is to be understood as maya, then kutastha is that state of
being which is situated in maya. In that case equating kutastha
with 1. sakshi, OR 2. sakshi + maya in seed form, seems appropriate.

Best regards
Shrinivas Gadkari
