Namaste Shri Sarma,

Let me make it very clear that my intention to
join this forum is not to take someone's side or
prove any point.

My intention is to clarify for myself those
concepts that I am not clear about.

And, if possible help others from falling into
traps that I have encountered.

For me kshara purusha, akshara purusha and uttama
purusha are different states of being. Since there
is only one being and that is Self, to me this is a
non-dual viewpoint.

If you are content with this understanding, I have
nothing more to add.

Best regards
Shrinivas Gadkari
