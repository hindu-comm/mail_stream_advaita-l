Human existence is Vyavaharika satta.
Please note that Vyavaharika is also Mithya.
Both Pratibhasika and Vyavaharika are Mithya, the
difference between them is in the level of knowledge
(Para or Apara) required to remove the Adhyasa.

I am sorry that there is a seeming confusion here.
Please remeber that I was quoting from Geeta [2-16]
where the word used is {\skt asat}, but meaning is
Mithya.
In fact Bhagavan Bhagatpada has explained {\skt asat}
in this verse in his Geeta Bhasya as {\skt avidyamaana.h},
by analysis the existence of these (dualities like cold, hot, etc)
can not be established - this of course means empirical
existence. Pardon my limitation that while quoting from
Geeta I had to use the original word, otherwise someone
may say this Himanshu is writing his own scriptures :-)
