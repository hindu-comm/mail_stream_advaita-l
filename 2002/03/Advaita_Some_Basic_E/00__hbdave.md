In my reply to Shri Srikrishna Ghadiyaram given previously,
it seems I have missed typing sentences at two places.
Kindly add the following at places shown. Pardon my carelessness.

The equivalence of jiiva with brahman is called
badha-samaanaadhikara.na
i.e. equivalence by taking matching part of jiiva and
taking baadha of the remaining characteristics.

The equivalence of aatman with brahman is called
saamaanya-samaanaadhikara.na
i.e. equivalence as equality or by common characteristics.
Both are valid. Some Acharyas take one, some the other.
When we to emphasis the baadha, we say jiivo brahma.h
na ca aparaiva;
when we have already discussed baadha of jiiva to aatman
we may say ayamaatmaa brahma.h

(please add to the explanation already given :)
Still, what are these two birds? They are the
kutastha (aatman) and chidaabhaasa (aanandamaya).
chidaabhaasa eats and enjoys the fruits, kutastha
is the witness, look on.

I hope taking into account this missed

portions will clarify it better.
