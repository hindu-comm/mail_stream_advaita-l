SVS:
  I have heard from my elders that regardless of whether a dhoti
is silk or not, if it has not undergone any of the following then
it can be essentially worn for puja and considered pure:
 - not been worn without bathing
 - not been washed even once
 - not been worn while having food
 - not been worn while in bed
 - not been worn or kept in unclean premises of the house

  I hope this helps.
  Regards,
  chandrashekaran.

What are the rules governing the use of silk-dhoti?  I remember that if you
did certain things the silk-dhoti loses its sanctity (maDi).  What are they?
One is sleeping with the silk-dhoti.  Today morning I performed the
Varalakshmi Vratam.  The silk-dhoti touched couple of other old clothes.  We
live in a very small apartment and it is difficult to move around without
coming into contact with something or the other.  The apartment is also
carpeted.

I would like to know the rules of the silk-dhoti (paTTu).

Regards,
SVS
