Based on my recent reading of Ishavasyopanishadbhasya, I think
Shankaracharyas' views of the following scenarios (as pertaining to
moksha) are as follows:

pravrtti only         ---- ok for the ignorant, not ok for the jnani
nivrtti only          ---- ok for the jnani, not ok for the ignorant
pravrtti + nivrtti    ---- not ok
pravrtti then nivrtti ---- ok
nivrtti then pravrtti ---- not ok

That the Vedas are the source of knowledge of Dharma.

I think nearly everyone on this list sympathizes with you because we are
in the same situation.

No that's pravrtti.

the key is all desires are not equal.  One of the requirements for a
sadhaka is mumukshatva -- the _desire_ to get moksha.  Although it is a
desire, it is desire to lessen desire.  Eventually it too will pass but
for the moment it will help destroy the other desires.  The bridge is
karmayoga.  When karma is done to get rewards or avoid punishments it only
entangles further but when it is done purely as duty and a sacrifice to
the Lord, it will eventually quench the thirst of desire.

No only that there is a long way on the path to go.  But as long as you
are moving forward why be anzious?

I think this is the central question of the Gita and the reason we hold it
in such high esteem.
