Cases of only pravritti or only nivritti are rare I
think. The concept of working without any hope for
return is the best way out.

Again nivritti after pravritti may take many
lifetimes. One has to slowly mentally detach oneself
from this world. Everything has to be surrendered to
God and we have to work as His agent. This way we can
continue to do what we are doing (legitimate work of
course!) and yet travel in the nivritti marg. These
ideas are not new. One has to start practising, that's
all.

It is not difficult to progress without ambition. We
must only relocate ourselves. One working in a service
organisation may work hard keeping the customer in
view. This dedicated work will help him both
spiritually as well as materially.

One need not despair having to earn money for the sake
of ones family. That is perfectly OK and is the dharma
of the grihastha. This sacrifice for the family will
ultimately lead to sacrifice for religious life.

Why do you confuse him even further? I would put it in
this way, he is on the road to nivritti.

The desire for liberation is no desire.  It does not
lead to any bondage.

The moment the question is asked, am I on the road to
spirituality, true spirituality starts. The path is
not long. The flame of jnana or even the desire for
jnana, burns everything instantly. Years of darkness
will be removed the instant the light is lit. One does
not have to wait for years.
