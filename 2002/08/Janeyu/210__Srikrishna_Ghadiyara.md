Hari Om !!

It is true that all progress in life is expressed
through auspicious thoughts. If that auspicious
thought gives you peace of mind, it is truly out of
'Punya' alone.

During my college days, I went to my childhood
favorite school teacher and expressed him my
dissatisfaction that I have not been having a pious
life (I did not even know clearly what it was, those
days. I had in mind all the attractions and
temptations of college life / youth). I asked him how
I could purify myself or if there was ever a recourse
for me. He told me there was nothing for me to do. He
said, "just as there is no sprouting again for a
'Bharjita Beejam', so also, clear repentance and
adopting a holy life is a sufficient cure for previous
misdeeds/mis-thoughts". Does the anology make sense ?

ALL IS ONE.

All of us are at the same distance from that holy
goal. So, your tons of "papa" does not make you any
'far' from the goal than those who have apparently
followed all the asrama injunctions. At the dawn of
Realisation, all the past will be washed away both
good and bad. Otherwise, how can I ever 'Realise'. So,
follow your dahrma, and cure the faults of wrong
adaptations by being in the path. There is no place
for 'Papa' and 'Punya' in 'Realisation'. It is
sufficient consolation. Bhagavan Ramana has clearly
expressed such views. When someone asked, that he
automatically gets attracted towards girls, and their
thoughts over take him (probably enquiring about its
effect on his 'Realisation'), Bhagavan simply asked,
find out who is having this 'attraction'. A lot
applies to all of us I guess, out of this message.

May Lord Narayana and Maa Bhagavathi be with all.

Om Namo Narayanaya !!
