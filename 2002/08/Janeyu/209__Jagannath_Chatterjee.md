Dear Srikrishnaji/Vaidyaji,

Thank you.I have indeed decided on wearing the
Yajnopavitam. And I will do it on Sravana Purnima.
Please pray for me that my karma for not wearing it
all these days may indeed be washed away by God's
Grace.

Profuse thanks, you two have looked at my welfare like
a brother.

Jagannath.
