Dear members,
    Please enlighten me on this.
    What happens to the subtle body of a jIvanmukta upon his shedding his
gross body? Does it remain in order to grace His devotees and followers?
Or does it merge with the elements? I have read that Great lives like Ramana, 
Ramakrishna remain in subtle form and bless the aspirants.

    Thanks and warm regards,
    chandrasekaran.
