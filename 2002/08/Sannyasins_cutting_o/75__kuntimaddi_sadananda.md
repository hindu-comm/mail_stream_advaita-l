For most hair is a sign of beauty. and people spend lot of time and
money to make sure they are not getting bald or hair does not become
gray.  Cutting hair is mostly symbolic to sign of getting rid of
attachement to the physical beauty.  Trying to extract meaning for
each one of them is just waste of time.
Hari OM!
