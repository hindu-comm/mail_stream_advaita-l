If I am not mistaken, there is even an Upanishad named after hair (on the
head or the beard or both - I am not sure) called MuNDaka. From what I have
leart about keeping hair i.e. Shikha etc, it "protects" the Brahmaraandra
(or Sahasrashirsha) chakra right below where the Shikha's root lies.

The lady who cuts my hair asked my about my shikha and I told her it was
because of my religion. Then I added how she must have seen Chinese movies
where the people also sport shikhas and she said yeah, it makes sense now :-
