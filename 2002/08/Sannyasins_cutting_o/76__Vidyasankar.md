The Paramahamsa Sannyasins get their faces completely shaven (including
head shorn) on every full moon day, except during the chaturmasya period,
which is currently underway. Other ascetic orders keep their hair, and let it
grow matted. It is a matter of which Sampradaya they belong to. And one
should also give room for individual observances, because of different
personal vows that people can take.
