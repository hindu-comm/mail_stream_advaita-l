Hari Om !!

I am surprised about your attitude.

On one count, you say that "Do you know that even a
sannyasin has to fight the ego"

and you still advocate "As a protest I refused to wear
the sacred thread and
I still don't wear it! "

"Religion is your own inner conviction I think.
However each is entitled to his views."

What do you call this fallacy !!

The above statements are not only EGOTIC, but also
ARROGANT.

Consider the otherside of the view, What is wrong in
having an outward sign if that represents your inner
conviction ?????

In the process you have hurt your parents, your
teachers, and followers and dharma.

Just a few days ago you were telling a sloka saying
that you do not want to hurt anyone ??? Where is
practice ???

Om Namo Narayanaya !!

Srikrishna
