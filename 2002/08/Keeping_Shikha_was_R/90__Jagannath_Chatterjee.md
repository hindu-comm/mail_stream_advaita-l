I am neither Srikrishnaji. These are of course my
views on the subject. In my childhood days I was both
deeply religious and also an atheist. I was religious
in the sense I had the firm conviction that my sojourn
in this world was never for solely materialistic ends.
There had to be a deeper meaning. I was an atheist
because I was subject to a lot of physical pain and
therefore could not have faith in the concept of an
all merciful God. You can imagine my inner conflict at
that time. Here was a child who was raring to go the
spiritual way but had to face obstructions every inch
of the path.

There is absolutely nothing wrong in that but the
outward sign must be commensurate with the inner
conviction. An imbalance may be very dangerous.

I don't have any followers though many of my friends
do seek my suggestions (only suggestions mark it). My
parents, my teacher and the dharma were surely hurt.
But both my parents and teacher were very patient with
me. Moreover my horoscope also indicated a deeply
religious trend. This was their sole hope.

I still think a thousand times before even hurting a
fly. My compassionate nature is a boon to my friends.
I am especially very much hurt while coming across the
atrocities heaped on the have-nots. This is the sole
reason I speak out against the varnashrama. We trample
upon the very people who were instrumental to our
progress.

Jagannath.
