Not necessarily. vairAgya, or a feeling of detachment, can develop due to a
variety of reasons, e.g. loss of a loved one, disappointment over not
getting something that was deeply desired, etc. This feeling, if it is only
fleeting, can easily be replaced by others, e.g. rage, grief, a desire for
revenge, hate, etc.

No. If I understand our authors right, it refers to complete understanding
of what is meant by tattvamasi. Repeated meditation, as a japa, is not
going to reveal this. When Sankara teaches parisaMkhyAna in the
Upadesasahasri, what he refers to is not repeated meditation on tattvamasi,
but a process of distinguishing between nitya and anitya, deha and Atman,
indriyas and Atman, etc.

So long as the mind exists, it will continue to undergo transformations,
for it is in its very nature to do so. In the bRhadAraNyaka commentary,
Sankaracharya advises a constant recollection of the Atman (Atma-viGYAna-
smR^iti-saMtAna) as a means to check the activity of the mind. Later
teachers like Vidyaranya and Madhusudana Saraswati talk of the complete
destruction of the mind (mano-nAsha) as concommittant with (not a
prerequisite for) advaita siddhi.

Best wishes,
Vidyasankar
