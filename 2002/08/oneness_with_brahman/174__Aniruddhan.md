namaste,

Thanks to Sri Vidyasankar for the corrections, and sorry for the late reply.

I was under the impression that mumukshutva usually goes hand-in-hand with
(or is a prerequisite of) vairagya. Isn't vairagya itself developed due to a
desire to be totally liberated from the birth cycles?

Here, what is the meaning of "pariGYAnaM"? does it mean repeated meditation
("parisamkhyanam"?)?

but isn't a complete stilling of the modifications of the mind a
prerequisite for advaita-siddhi? Or is this a later step?
