--- Kiran B R <kiranbr at ROCKETMAIL.COM> wrote:

Kiran there is some confusion in understanding - brahavit brahama eva
bhavati - knower of Brahman becomes brahman.  Brahman means
infiniteness and by that very word it also means it does not exclude
anything and it does not have any internal (nor external)
differentiations or distinctions.  There is no question of the world
and Brahman - Braham includes everything without any internal
distinctions as purrnam, chainanyam and sat pratyayam.

Knower of Brhaman cannot be a knower who knows some object as this is
brahman since - there is nothing other than Brahman, knower of the
Brahman should be the one who knows that I am that Brahman since
there is not more subject-object distinctions in Brhman.  Only way
this can happpen is to recoginition that I know (realize) that I am
that Brhaman and not this thing I know is Brahman.  Hence Brahman vit
can be knowing that oneself is Brhanam and this one is Brahman -
Hence it has to follow that Brahma vit Brahma eva bhavati.

There is no more world - powers - I separate from the world - all
those distinctions are disloved in the homogeneous mass of
consciousness that one is.

Just as when you wake up from your dream there is no more the dream
world and dream poweres and dream runnings etc. all are resolved into
the waking mind.

Hari OM!
