Yes, you can change the laws of Physics (why only
Physics, you can change laws of Chemistry also.).

The way: Do Tapas on Lord Narayana. When He appears,
ask Him for such powers.

(We know the story of Sage Viswamitra, Sati Anasuya,
and many others through Puranas. What they have done,
you can also do.)

Om Namo Narayanaya !!
