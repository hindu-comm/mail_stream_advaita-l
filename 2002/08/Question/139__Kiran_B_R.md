Surely not! In fact, what is the use of this list if
you do not reply?!

Perfectly right.

Yes, that is exactly what I meant by "breaking the
laws of physics". But I don't understand why you're
postulating a duality between Ishwara and Brahman. To
the Brahman, Ishwara's plan is HIS own plan. Ishwara
is nothing but HIMSELF. Then where is the question of
waiting for a divine signature on a tender?

Very true.

How can water boil and not freeze when heated? That is
how. If indeed this is all maayaa, water must freeze
when heated, and this must be shown by the jIvanmukta.
This must be shown by Krishna. This must be shown by
Sri Shankaracharya.

Otherwise an incapability remains in the jIvanmukta,
in Krishna and in Sri Shankaracharya. What
incapability? The incapability to control the material
world. This incapability is equivalent to a dualism,
which is not good for Advaita.
