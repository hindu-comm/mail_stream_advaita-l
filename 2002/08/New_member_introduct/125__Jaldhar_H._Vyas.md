Not sure where to start. Originally from India and been living in the
Dallas area for the past 13 years. Engineer by profession. Active member
of Chinmaya Mission Dallas/Ft. Worth. I have read a lot of books written
by Swami Chinmayananda. I am currently reading Vivekachoodamani. I have
tried to serch that name and ended up in your web site. Hope this helps.
