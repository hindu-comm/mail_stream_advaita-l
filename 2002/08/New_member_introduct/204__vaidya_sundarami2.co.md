Re: Welcome and Request for more info.


Hari Om,

In response to your request for more information, I am a student of
Advaita Vedanta, not flying the flag for any particular Swami. I can
not see myself posting many contributions to your list at this stage,
but I am very interested to read what others have to say about the
philosophy
of Shankara.
Thine Own Self,
Lynne Kolnik.
