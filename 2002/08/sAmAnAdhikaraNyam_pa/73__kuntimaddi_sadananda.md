Ken thanks for the excellent post from the pages of T.N. Ganapathy.
I
was going to post on LakshaNa-s in terms of jaha and ajah and jaha
ajahalakshhaNa-s.  There is beautiful description of these by Swami
Sadananda in Vedanta Saara- taking the example of soyam devadattaH.
There is also reference to this in the first chapter of Pancadasi by
Vidyaranya swami.

I am looking forward to the second part.

Hari OM!
Sadananda
