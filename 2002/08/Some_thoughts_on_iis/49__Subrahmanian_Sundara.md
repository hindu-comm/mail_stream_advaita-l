It would be nice if some learned person in the list volunteered to discuss
the basic idea of lakshaNas - jahad, ajahad etc, baadha-saamaanadikaraNyam
et al.  Whatever material we have in the archive on this topic (like Sri
Ramakrishnan Balasubrahmanian's series or Sri Anand Hudli's advaita siddhi)
pre-supposes prior basic knowledge.

May be Sri Ramakrishnan Balasubramanian can help us out?

For instance, the word Lion,
could mean a)  someone who has lion like qualities b) a deer mistakenly
considered as lion  or e) the true lion  itself. Hence taking one
closer to the Self should considered carefully.
