Namaskaram.
 I don't want to get into this since there could any number of reasons why
some one wants to leave the list. Lets please leave it at that.
More importantly, I request list members to note that requests such as this
for leaving the list or modifying preferences can be handled by each member
himself or herself. Please visit
www.advaita-vedanta.org/archives/advaita-l.html and follow the link for
"Join or leave the list (or change settings)" - Also, you can send a mail to
listmaster.
Thanks.

Vaidya.
