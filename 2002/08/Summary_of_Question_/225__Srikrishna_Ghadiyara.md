It is not apparent non-sensical argument; it is really
non-sensical argument.

He will ask you what is 'mAyA' ? Based on this can you
conclude that he has to bow down to mAyA ?

By this you are agreeing that you are testing his body
and not his brahmanhood. Right ? If Brahmanhood does
not belong to the body, then why are you asking a
brahmavid to perform body feats.

So, whether it be brahmavid or not you can keep giving
your tests to everyone you see. (if they do not run
away from you, by mere sight.)

Looking for expression in body for one's brahmanhood
is like asking Srikrishna is eating 3 times a day,
then why is Kiran hungry.

What else can you do anyway ?

Another false argument: If he tells you that he
acquired the ability to see far by wearing telescopic
glasses, you conclude that he can not hear !!! It is
more sensible to ask if he is a brahmavid or not
directly, than make false derivations and conclusions.

If the enlightened have to follow your rules and
interpretations, then they should be called
kiranbudhivid than brahmavid.

Om Namo Narayanaya !!
