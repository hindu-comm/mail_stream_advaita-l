Ah but who said the 'Self' talked about by Advaitins is the same as the
person 'Kiran Rao'?

In fact 'Kiran Rao' is only a subset of that Self.  'Jaldhar Vyas' is
another subset but it doesn't follow that I am the same subset.  And it
also doesn't follow that a subset has all the properties of the whole.
