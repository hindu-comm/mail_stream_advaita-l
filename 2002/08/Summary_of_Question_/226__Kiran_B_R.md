You got me wrong. I'll show him that water boils on
heating and ask him if he can do anything thing about
it! If he admits that he can't do anything about it, I
will conclude that he has to bow down to Maya. If he
asks what is water and what is boiling, I'll conclude
that he is wrapped in more layers of Maya than anyone
I've ever met.

I defined the braHman earlier. It is He who is beyond
Maya and controls it. Needless to say, He must be able
to control his body too. And run 100m in 2s. And
freeze water by boiling too. And get good grades in
Dutch vocab tests.

What ways do you suggest in which one can test
brahmatva, other than testing the body? Give examples
of ways which are removed from the body. Knowledge is
also body, remember! There is nothing specialy divine
about knowledge. It's just a modification of "anna".

If you don't test the body (and by that I mean sThoola
sookShma kAraNa sharIraaNi), you cannot test anything.
Like the bull in that Fanta ad, you'll have to nod
your head and accept every idiot's braHmajnAna.
Perhaps of even the bull in the Fanta ad. Perhaps of
Ben Johnsons who can run 100m in about 9.8s.

Ha ha, you've got a good sense of humour, mate!

I would have put that question to you if you were
known to "be" a braHmavid (and hence braHman).

Statutory warning: "Following Kiran is injurious to
braHmavids. Cigarette smoking is injurious to health."
