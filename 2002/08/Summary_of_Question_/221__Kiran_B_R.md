I need not run 100m in 2s because I am attached to
that act. I can run without that attachment. Then we
have no contradiction.

You see a contradiction because you daisy-chain
attachment and karma.

There is such a thing called as karma devoid of
attachment, and it is such karma that a braHmavid
does, seeing nothing but akarma in it.

Consider this: Krishna in the Mahabharata "did" karma.
Yet we know him as the Supreme. Is there a
contradiction?
