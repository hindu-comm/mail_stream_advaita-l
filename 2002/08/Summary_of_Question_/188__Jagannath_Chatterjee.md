Dear Roger,

Namaskar.

Its good to see you again on the list. You should
contribute more frequently. There are a lot of
devotees of Bhagawan in this list, though He is not
dicussed that often.

Regarding Kiran's poser on the list, the very fact
that we all responded enthusiastically proves that we
did not take it lightly. Of course in our replies, I
admit, a fare share of our personal preferences came
up. Only Ashis, Aniruddhan and Srikrishna (that leaves
out only the undersigned I suppose!!) were able to
rise above it. I for one, requested Kiran to take heed
of their answers. I also said that answers to such
questions come automatically when one progresses on
the path and that certain purificatory practices are
necessary. "...pranipatena, pariprashnena, sevayate.."
says the Gita, prostration, enquiry and service, is to
be followed. Pranipatena is high on the list and that
does not come without serious practice.

It is also not a question of "Science Vs Religion".
Modern science, especially Physics, is today squarely
on the road to spiritual findings. I would request you
to go through the works of Fritjof Capra, Swami
Ranganathanandaji among others, if you have not read
them already.

I am one hundred percent sure that Kiran will flourish
on the list and we will have the good fortune to hear
his views on Sri Sankaracharya and His works. I would
request him to develop a sense of humour so that our
playfull banterings doesn't bother him.

Yours sincerely

Jagannath.
