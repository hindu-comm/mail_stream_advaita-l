Kiran Rao is what he sees himself as. Jaldhar Vyas is
what he sees himself as. Why should anyone see himself
as the subset? Why not as the superset? When a grain
of salt has entered the ocean, where are subsets?
Where are the fences? And what stops the superset (the
ocean) from creating a maayaa (like it is said in the
TaittIrIyOpanishad, "sO&kAmayata | bahu syAm
prajAyEyEti | sa tapOtapyata | sa tapastaptvA | idag.m
sarvamasR.jata | yadidam kim cha |") based on NEW LAWS
and placing Kiran Rao in it, so that Kiran Rao can
happily freeze his water by heating, in the presence
of
Jaldhar Vyas?
