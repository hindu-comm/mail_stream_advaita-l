Next day again during when you go to bed, dream comes
again in some form.

I believe, the definition of Jnana itself is 'being
free from Adhyasa'.

Jaladharji, I really did not feel like going to some pundit with the issue.
I am frankly scared with what he may come up with. So, as the second best
method of action, I went to the nearby Lingaraja Temple, offered prayer and
puja to Lingaraja Mahaprabhu and Sri Ganesha. The priest seemed happy with
the dakshina I offered. That was it.
