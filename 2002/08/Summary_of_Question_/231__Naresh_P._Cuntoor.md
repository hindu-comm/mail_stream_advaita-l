(Quantum does seem to be today's buzzword, doesn't it?!) .. At the risk
of going totally off-track, I just want to point out that all these
theories
in science had a beginning.. its not like quantum theory is anAdi now, is
it? So if the theoretical framework isn't present, then scientists go
about finding one.

which brings me to the same question, why this obsession with tying
together science and religion? why not understand them to be operating
under different frames of reference?
