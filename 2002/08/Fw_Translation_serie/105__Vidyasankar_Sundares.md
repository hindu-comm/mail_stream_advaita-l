This venerable Lord of all beings is always endowed with knowledge, lordliness,
power, strength, vitality and splendour, is unborn and not subject to change,
and is eternal, pure, enlightened and ever-liberated in nature. He controls the
root material nature (muulaprakR^iti), which is His own power of illusion (maayaa),
consisting of the three qualities (triguNa). By means of this power, He appears
in this world, as if He were embodied and as if he were born, and blesses it.

With no personal profit in it, but due to a desire to promote the welfare of all
beings, He imparted the two-fold Vedic Dharma to Arjuna, who was drowning
in a great ocean of sorrow and delusion. This is because only if the Law is
grasped and practised properly by people of excellent virtues will it flourish in
the world. The revered sage, the omniscient Vedavyasa, wrote down this
Dharma, as taught by the Lord, in seven hundred verses, called the
Songs (Gita).

The teaching of the Gita, which is the essence of the meaning of all the
Vedas, is difficult to comprehend. Even though many have expressed each
verse-quatrain (pada) and its meaning in sentences, it is noticed that people
in general hold many mutually contradictory ideas about it. Therefore, I will
briefly explain the text, in order to elucidate its proper meaning.Get more from the Web.  FREE MSN Explorer download : http://explorer.msn.com
