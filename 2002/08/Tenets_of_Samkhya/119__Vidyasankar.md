This is Upanishadic teaching and therefore part of the Vedantic schools of
thinking. The Yoga school does not discuss Ishvara in this way, and
considers Ishvara not as a collective Purusha, but as a special Purusha, who
remains unaffected (aparaamR^iShTa) by any faults (klesha-s), who is ever
omniscient (niratishayaM sarvaGYa bIjaM) and who is the guru of Yogin-s in
the past.
