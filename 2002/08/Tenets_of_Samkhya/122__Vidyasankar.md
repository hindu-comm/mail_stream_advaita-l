This is indeed the only written source of this legend. However, note that
in this work, Patanjali is the author of the Mahabhashya in the Paninian
grammar tradition. As far as I can remember, Ramabhadra Dikshita mentions
nothing about the Yogasutra-s, although people tend to equate the Patanjali
of the Yoga school with the Patanjali of the grammarian tradition.
