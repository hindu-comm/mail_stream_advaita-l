One has to be careful about what one means with the use of numbers here. In
Samkhya, Prakrti and Purusha are independent entities, and it is therefore
called a dualistic system. But this does not mean that there is only one
Purusha. In fact, in Samkhya, there are multiple Purushas, each one being
independent of the other Purusha-s.

In the Yoga school, there are also multiple Purusha-s, and Ishvara is a
special Purusha (Yogasutra says purusha-visheSho IshvaraH). It differs from
classical Samkhya, in that Samkhya does not admit of Ishvara.
