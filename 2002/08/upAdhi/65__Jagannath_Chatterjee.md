There is a distinction between the jivatman and the
antaratman, is it not? The antaratman remains separate
from the jivatman inspite of the superimposition. Can
you kindly explain the finer details of how this
distinction is maintained? How is this similiar to the
superimposition of the prakriti on the purusha?

Thank you,

Jagannath
