Actually after your last post I was worried I had it backwards myself.
But I think my explanation is ok.  Let us assume we have three objects of
one type and one of another i.e.

(a b c) (d)

What seperates the group (a b c) from (d) is the vishesha lakshana.  But
what seperate a from b _or_ a from d is an upadhi.  In the case of brahman
all upadhis are illusionary because it pervades a b c and d.

Personally, I don't have that work.  If it is not to long, could you post
the relevant passage here?  I can look at it next week.
