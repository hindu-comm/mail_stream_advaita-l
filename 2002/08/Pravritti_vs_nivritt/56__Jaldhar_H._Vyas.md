Krishna Bhagawan tells Arjuna that tolerance should not be stretched to
the point of appeasement.  If one is being trampled, ones duty is to fight
the trampler.

According to the tikakara, the view described as pravrtti only is that of
the Mahayajnikas or Purva Mimmasakas.  Nivrtti alone should be the norm
for Advaitins.

The problem without having _any_ hope of return is it can very easily turn
into aimless wandering.  Thus in Advaita Vedanta, the sadhaka is
encouraged to have a purpose, to desire to reach a goal, but in such a
way as to eliminate all other desires and finally itself.

The Sanskrit word mumukshatva literally means desire for moksha, it is
pretty straightforward.  If one clings to it, it too could cause bondage.
So it should also be given up but as the last step.

But there's the rub isn't it?  What is legitmate work?  We need to look to
Shruti, Smriti, and Shistachara for guidance on this.  Even then there can
be ambiguities.  The Mahabharata deal at length with this.  E.g How did
such mahatmas such as Bhishma, Vidura, Drona, and Krpa manage to end up on
the wrong side?

I don't think there is anything particularly confusing about this.  If I
save my pennies, I'm on the road to being a millionaire but until I have a
million dollars, I'm not a millionaire.

We can take heart that even on the battlefield of kurukshetra, it was
possible to be a stithaprajna.  This is the attitude to take:

Brahman was there long before this moment.  It will be there long
afterwards.  In fact there is never a moment when it is not within reach.
So what's the rush?
