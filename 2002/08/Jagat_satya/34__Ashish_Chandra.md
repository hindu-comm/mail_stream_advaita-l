So you can at least understand why Swami Vivekananda has inspired so many
people.

Sri Ramakrishna was not a "modern saint". What he gave Swami Vivekananda
was not "modernism". Perhaps I am missing the point but Swami Vivekananda
did not try to prove that Hinduism is modern. Rather, he only affirmed how
relevant it still was when people were marching through the streets of
Calcutta abusing Hinduism and tearing up Bhagavad Gitas. This was the kind
of tendency that Swami Vivekananda defeated by his work.

If Hritik Roshan has a Guru like Sri Ramakrishna, I would have no problem
listening to him.

And I am not saying you are blaming Swami Vivekananda. You hold that Swami
Vivekananda tried to reform Hinduism. I hold that he tried to reform the
people, the way they looked at themselves and their religion/culture, so
they could turn back to Hinduism. This he did with people who called
themselves orthodox as well as those who had forgotten the ABC of Hindu
thought. He did not try to reform Hinduism. That is our difference.

And still indulging in lies and deception and mental violence, one keeps
getting lost unless there is the support of Dharma (Vedas) and Guru to hold
one in place.
