Dear Vaidyaji,

Namaskar.

I think you have put across the points rather well. I
am not dogmatic about Swamiji. My comments on
varnashrama are a result of some practical field work
in rural India.

Let us leave it at this. It has already gone too far.

Regards and looking forward to your contributions to
the list,

Jagannath
