Forget about being a sannyasi or not. Then our Adi Shankaracharya had no
business doing his mother's antyeshti. The question is : Has any Guru any
right to give yajnopavit to a person. I don't just mean Guru as in teacher:
I mean a fully realized person. If such a person gives yajnopavit to a
person (or performs His mother's antyeshti), are you going to challenge
that. I can give you at least one example I personally know of where a non-
Brahmin was made a pujari of a temple after his Guru performed his
yajnopavit. Are you going to say that is wrong? Is this reforming Hinduism
when a Guru does this? You have a copy of Shankardigvijaya, you can look up
the opposition Adi Shankara faced then as well. How would you explain that?

Read: Swami Vivekananda did not go and stop these activities (of tearing up
the Gita). Rather, his call prevented people from turning to them. I am not
so well read about Buddhism but it could have been countered with 8th, or
9th, or 10th century ideas. But it was countered by what was always in our
religion - Vedanta espoused by Gaudapada.

Trust me - it is not so easy to have blind faith as you are ascribing to
me.

There is no need for these remarks. One has to be realistic with oneself.
The real change is not whether I can answer what is anupalabdhi. The real
change is whether I always speak the truth and am always kind and
benevolent towards everyone. Not that knowing what is anupalabdhi is not
progress - but it is not *my* progress. At least not yet. Unfortunately, I
have not yet mastered the "Yam" part. That is perhaps one reason why I have
Advaita Siddhi and Brahma Sutra Bhashya still sitting on my shelf. For me,
progress is surrendering to the Guru and answering every doubt with "He is
Grace Itself". His actions are a mystery to me. You see, I don't
_understand_ him at all. I have to just surrender to him and that is all
the understanding I need, and am still cultivating. Maybe I will never know
what anupalabdhi is (knowing Hindi, I at least know what it means) in the
Nyaya doctrine. But I have supreme confidence that if my faith in Guru is
strong enough, I will be exactly in the same place as where
knowing "anupalabdhi" is supposed to take you. Would it matter who knew
what or how one got there?
