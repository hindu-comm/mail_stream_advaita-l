Please.  Do you think I would have even entered into this topic without
doing my own research?  Jagannath just gives some outside corroboration in
case someone thinks this is just my personal obsession.  I thank him for
his honesty.

Prabhupada did the same kind of thing.  He calls his commentary on the
Gita "Bhagavadgita As It Is" with the implication that he alone is giving
the pristine interpretation of the Gita whereas all others have distorted
it.  This is good propoganda but doesn't measure up.  If you actually read
it, you see he distorts with abandon when it suits him.

The same thing is going on here.  In the 19th century people thought that
with new disciplines like critical philology, they would be able to come
up with definitive and accurate statements of meaning.  Today we are more
likely to believe that everything is a matter of interpretation.
Shankaracharyas interpretation is the best because it makes the most out
of a wide and disparate set of thoughts.

0. Misrepresenting the true source of his ideas and how much it diverges
from what has always been understood as Advaita Vedanta.  Basing his
interpretations on ideas which may have been cutting edge in the 19th
century, but are obsolete, dangerous and downright backward today.

Are you aware that Ekam sad... means something other than what you think it
does?

In the 19th century the traditionalist monks believed in staying out of
politics too but their sympathies were with those who wanted to see the
British out of India.  Especially after 1857, the colonial authorities
were quite suspicious of followers of the ancien regime as potential
sources of sedition which is why they started their "Brown Englishmen"
policy.  So the reformers had a delicate balancing act to follow.  On the
one hand they had to convince the authorities "We are not a threat to your
rule." and they had to convince their compatriots "We are not traitors to
our culture."  One way to do this was just to proclaim disinterest in
politics altogether.  But as you mention below they did have a political
agenda.

This is an example.  This is totally the kind of Marxist political
interpretation which was in vogue in the 19th century.  Like most
political propoganda it doesn't hold water on closer inspection.

First of all many Brahmans were (and are) poor themselves.  In fact the
more religious they are the more likely they are to be poor.

Second the scapegoating of an entire group for the supposed sins of a few
is immoral.  I can't speak for any other members of the Brahminist class
(including yourself) but my conscience is clean.  I haven't oppressed
anyone and neither have the last several generations of my family.  So I
regard this as vile slander nothing more.

Third, this is just a convenient fig leaf to hide the fact that all the
reform movements have been made up of "bhadra log" none of them has ever
had much success amongst the masses they claim to be championing.  They
try and delegitimize the traditional establishment because they are its
competitors for social and political power not any noble sentiment.

If you examine the rhetoric of the Hindutva partisans (which I agree is
opportunistic) when they invoke Shankaracharya or his successors (Do
they really do this?  I haven't seen too many examples myself.)  it is for
different reason then when they quote Vivekananda.  For the latter it is
show how "modern" Hinduism is which was my only point.

If celebrity status is a good reason for following a philosopher maybe we
should start Hritik-Roshan-L :)

Please understand my purpose in all this is not to "blame" Vivekananda.
As I said in one of my first mails, what he did and said may have been
appropriate for his particular circumstances.  My concern is for today.
Based on what I know about the history and philosophy of our religion and
other religions, I think our classical tradition provides a much firmer
basis for continued growth and vitality in the long run than any of the
reform movements.

You should feel free to frankly express your doubts on this list.  I am
confident that Advaita Vedanta is rock solid.

This is a question which cannot be solved once and for all but I feel
practice is more important than ideology.  First one does by imitation and
then one thinks about what one is doing and starts doing consciously.
E.g. you tell a child it's not nice to hit people.  They do it to please
you (or to avoid being punished.)  Then when they grow up they start to
think about why nonviolence is better than violence.

This message is being sent today, not tomorrow. :)
