Vaidya

I was only making the point that great saints have their ways of doing
things that are not open to us. I am not advocating that we do as they do -
we simply cannot. My contention was (is) that one must not complain that
such things (as giving janeu to a non-Brahmin) occur. I am *not* saying
that we should do that. Rather, our blanket opposition to such things is a
little dogmatic. Saints work in mysterious ways - that is all I am saying,
and some of those things include getting a dull disciple to recite in
Totaka meter or giving janeu to a non-Brahmin. Please do not think that I
am advocating any straying from Dharma. Rather, dharma includes the
following of saints and sages.

...rather this is what I am saying happens all the time - for good and for
bad.

I agree. We have no choice but to follow dharma.

>There can be many opinions.

Please understand that I am not trying to say its ok to sidestep what
dharma says. Rather, what I have maintained in this thread is that if great
saints do things that are seeminlgy not vedokta, then we should not hold
onto our orthodox position and oppose such a one.

If my Guru tells me to shave on a Tuesday, would I say no, the Shastras
forbid it? I am going to shave. I might be tempted to ask why but I will
shave nonetheless.
