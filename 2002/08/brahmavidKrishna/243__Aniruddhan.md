Ishvara = brahman seen as endowed with gunas from vyavaharika level
Brahman = Atman = nirguna, seen from paramarthika level
Atman != Ishvara at vyavaharika level (!= is not equal to)
Brahman = nishkriya, Actionless
Ishvara = performs action so that people don't get submerged in tamas
Ishvara = controls "worldly reality"
Brahmavid = Brahman in paramarthika level
Brahmavid != Ishvara in vyavaharika level

==> Brahmavid = actionless (no running 100m in 2s etc)

Maybe he can (or cannot) run 100m in 2s, but doesn't have the inclination to
answer your question, or show you. Result: you are left without knowing
whether He is really liberated or not, and He remains a Brahmavid.

No, it is for the "if" on line 1. On lines 1 & F, you have written:

1: if(capable=true)
...
F: else /* capable=false */
...

I presumed that you are resolving the question of capability by asking the
brahmavid. You have assumed in lines 1 and F that there are only two
responses, yes and no. I proposed a third, namely silence.

>Silence is not an
>answer.

Yes it is. Silence is the Highest Answer.
