As  you think great about your programming logic, so
also remember that in Electronics there is a 'Don't
care condition' which means 'Yes or No' and 'Yes and
no'.

Now, you are trying to explain using symbolic logic.
In my previous e-mail I asked you to do the same
thing, so you realise that your anology does not lead
to your conclusions.
Om Namo Narayanaya !!
