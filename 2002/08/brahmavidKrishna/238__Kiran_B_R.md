Nothing is "intrinsically" silly. What is
"intrinsically silly" to you may not be "intrinsically
silly" to me, because I may be relatively silly
compared to you.

Not if it is claimed that the braHman controls
"worldly reality".

Oh! You're starting it again! My friend, first test
capability before testing if the capability will be
excercised or not. Something like this:

1: if(capable=true)
2:  {
3:   ask("Dear Sir, will you do it?");
4:   if (answer=no)
5:    {
6:    ask("Why not?");
7:    }
8:   else /*answer=yes*/
9:    {
A:    ask("Then please do it");
B:    wait until done; /* don't sleep and dream! */
C:    ask("Can you show me how to do it?");
D:    }
E:  }
F: else /* capable=false */
G:  {
H:    say("Dear Sir, you cannot do it.");
I:  }

Everyone seems to be jumping directly to the line
labelled 6, and even giving answers to that question -
answers like "He ain't got no desires!", "He thinks
you're not Swami Vivekananda!", "He thinks it's spoil
your spiritual growth!", "He doesn't need to prove
anything!"...etc etc.

Dhanyavaad
Kiran
