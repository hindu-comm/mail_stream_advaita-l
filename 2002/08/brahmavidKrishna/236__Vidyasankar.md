This argument keeps going round and round in circles.

It doesn't matter whether the tests you propose are intrinsically silly or
not. From the standpoint of worldly reality, they indeed are meaningless.
But the point is, why would a brahmavit want to take the tests you propose?
A true brahmavit has no desire or need to prove anything. To that extent,
your "tests" are self-defeating.
