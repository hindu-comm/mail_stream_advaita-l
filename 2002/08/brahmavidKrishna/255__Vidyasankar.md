So the absurd tests like running 100 m in 2s or freezing water by boiling
are more reliable?

Ah, that was out of his own desire or out of the fruition of karma, not
because somebody asked for it. Prahlada didn't ask Vishnu to come out of
the pillar and kill Hiranyakashipu. Rather, when Hiranyakashipu denied that
Vishnu was in that pillar, and broke it apart, Vishnu appeared in the form
of Narasimha, neither man nor animal. Arjuna didn't ask Krishna to cause an
eclipse out of turn, in order to prove that Krishna was Brahman. Rather the
conditions of the war demanded something and Krishna did something. There
is a world of difference between what you propose and what the legends say.

Best wishes,
Vidyasankar

Dear Roger,
    Are you meaning that "yes.. it's void after death just like coma =
state"? If
so, then it does not explain to me the rebirth of an unrealised *soul* =
(the subtle
body).
    I am not yet clear through your mail. Please clarify further with =
your thoughts.

     Thanks.
