Do you know a pious person who can freeze water by
boiling? I'm dying to meet him.

braHman=braHmavid cannot pray and ask favours from
someone else. There just ain't no "someone else".

Who is this second braHman?

Again, by saying "will not", the question of his
capability (to be a competitor in this case) is being
implicitly assumed. But I am questioning this
assumption.

In the statement "He will not run 100m in 2s", there
is no, I repeat, no unique answer to the question "CAN
he run 100m in 2s?"

You're assuming what I want you to prove: That the
tests I proposed are silly.

Dhanyavaad
