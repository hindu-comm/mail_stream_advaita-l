Enter Swami Vivekananda from page no. 154, para
12(chapter "India-Cause of Her Degeneration") of the
book "Teachings of Swami Vivekananda", Advaita
Ashrama:

"The Lord has shown me that religion is not in fault,
but it is the Pharisees and Sadducees in Hinduism,
hypocrites, who invent all sorts of engines of tyranny
in the shape of doctrines of Paramarthika and
Vyavaharika. (V.15)."

What are we getting into?

Kiran
