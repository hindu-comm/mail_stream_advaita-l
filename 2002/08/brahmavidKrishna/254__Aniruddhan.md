The scholars of Vishishtadvaita and Dvaita (who, I am sure, have complete
understanding of their respective philosophies) have traditionally
established their philosophies only in opposition to Advaita. I therefore
find it hard to believe that A and V/D can be the same in essence.

I still fail to see how the concepts of paramarthika and vyavaharika in
advaita philosophy have anything to do with the caste system!

I personally think that such a question will remain unanswered. Whether a
Brahmavid can or cannot do this, a real Brahmavid will remain unconcerned
with this and will not answer this question or undergo the experiment.

I think you are still identifying the Brahmavid with His body. By (advaita)
definition, the Brahmavid is Brahman, and therefore Everything, therefore
he already exists at the place 100m from where his body is! In one sense,
you can say that he can run 100m in no time at all!
