Brahman indeed doesn't control "worldly reality", since at the paramarthika
level, nothing other than brahman exists, and Brahman is actionless. At the
vyavaharika level, Ishvara controls the world. It is also true that Ishvara
is Brahman, but the two states should not be confused.

There can be a third response to this question, which is silence, and this
would be the typical answer of a Brahmavid to most people.
