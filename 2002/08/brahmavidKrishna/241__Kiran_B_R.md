I assumed in my previous mail that your "silence"
answer is for the "if" on line 1. I now get a feeling
it is for the "if" on line 4.

If it is indeed for the "if" on line 4 (answering the
question "...will you...?"), this is really, really,
really amazing! How did you pass through line 1? How
did you assume that he IS capable?
