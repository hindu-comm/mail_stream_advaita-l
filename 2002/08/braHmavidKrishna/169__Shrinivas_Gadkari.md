Namaste,

Yes Sir, you make sense. However, those who take the counter
stand also make sense.

A general rule in this regard is eat only that which you can
digest, else it will hurt you.

Siddhi's lie on the way, for example, Patanjali yoga sutras
section 3 describes them.

Best wishes,
Shrinivas Gadkari
