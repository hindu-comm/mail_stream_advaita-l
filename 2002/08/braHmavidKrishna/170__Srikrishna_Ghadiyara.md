This point does NOT make sense. It has been said
clearly, that the sadhana for Siddhis and Jnana is
different in the sense that the object of seeking in
the sadhana is different and hence results are
different. Bhagavan explained this clearly, and it has
been recorded in His Talks. Please read.

Om Namo Narayanaya !!

Srikrishna
