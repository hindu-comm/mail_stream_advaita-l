To me, no.

It is the cornerstone of my belief in Advaita. I would
ask him if I could meet him. Surely. It might seem
silly to you, but it's a perfectly sane and valid
question to me.

Kiran is absolutely right and his question is most certainly VALID.

Shankaracharya has come down to earth and is in front of Kiran right now and this is what He tells Kiran:

Dear Kiran, what would you really achieve by running 100 metres in 2 seconds? Or for that matter,  if you are able to do all those seemingly impossible things of achieving in this world? What is your aim in your present life? To be a racer who can run Miles in seconds? Or to learn more of Advaita? Granting that you have been made to run 100 metres in 2 seconds and have also been given the capability of doing anything that you wish to do in this world that nobody can even imagine,then, ------then------ What?

How will this help you to believe in ADVAITA ?

Do you not agree that  In achieving all this you will be deep in Dwaita ? !!

Hari Om!

Swaminarayan
