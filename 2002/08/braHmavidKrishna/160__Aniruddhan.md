namaste,

If you want to know what his jnana is, the correct way to go about finding
this out is not to observe his siddhis.

because this world and maya are unreal, and He doesn't care about things He
knows are unreal, and because He knows the Real. And also because He bows
down before maya as Ishvara's power in this world.

Maybe he can, maybe he can't. He will not bother to even try. Hence we
ordinary people will never know. Can I balance a pole on the tip of my nose?
Maybe I can or maybe I can't. And I really don't care enough to try because
it doesn't matter. We'll never know now will we? :-)

Agreed.

No. The entity whom you call Bhagavan above is Ishvara, the controller of
maya. The brahmavid "becomes" nirguna brahman.

As far as I know, yes it seems to be wrong. Nobody can become Ishvara.

If at all we can prove that there are entities other than ourselves. From
the paramarthika point of view, there is no one striving for liberation. And
for the jnAni, there are no "other people" to help. He will however teach
"others" the Path out of compassion for them.

No, for the real jnani, there is no "going away from this maya" and no
"return".

> But of what use is the

Bhagavan Krishna is an avatar of Ishvara, and has come down for a particular
purpose. A jnani, on the other hand is a jiva who has attained moksha.

>If I who now have innumerable incapabilities in this

Like I said earlier, there is no "going" or "coming back" for a jnani. It is
not as if, after attaining moksha, he has reached a different place. He just
Is.
