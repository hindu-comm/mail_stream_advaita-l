Dear Kiran,

Namaskar.

First of all a little rule of the list. Stick to the title of the thread
without creating a new title while on the same subject. This helps the
members manage mails and also remember the thread.

However you may want it that way.

Fine, you want to test the jnana of the Lord. Everyone on this list would
like to do that. But you have to first know him is it not? That, my friend,
is a very tall order. Millions all over the globe strive to do that. But,
as so succintly pointed out by the Lord Himself, only a miniscule
percentage succeed.

You have probably not seen my mail on the title "Question".

Anyway, you are confusing a brahmavid with an avatara. The avatara (the
direct manifestation of the Lord by His control over maya) can bend all the
rules but not the Brahmavid.

If you want a straight answer as far as maya is concerned, it is NO!. The
brahmavid is no avatara. Why bother about the universe, take the example of
the human body. What is cancer? Its a case of certain cells of the body
running amuk defying all rules, is it not? A brahmavid, of all people,
would not like to set off such a chain reaction. Definitely not.

It does not perturb Krishna one tiny bit whether any jiva call him Bhagavan
or not. Krishna can do anything if He so desires, repeat, if he so desires.
He can make an elephant to pass through the eye of a needle, as Sri
Ramakrishna puts it.

The brahmavid does not become Krishna. He just merges into him and becomes
a part of him. It is called sajujya, the highest form of mukti a jiva can
aspire for. It is like this;

jiva -> seeker -> brahmavid -> sajujya mukti.

There is no question of the jiva or for that matter a brahmavid becoming
Krishna.

People are helped by the brahmavid. The help may be material if a brahmavid
so desires. Or it may be spiritual. Again it may be both material and
spiritual .It all depends on the brahmavid.

Who are you fooling? Do you disbelieve in the words of the Lord? What would
you call personalities like Sri Shankaracharya, Sri Ramakrishna, Bhagawan
Sri Ramana?

But his coming does not depend on the "capabilities" of the brahmavid. It
depends on the prayers/aspirations of the masses. Whenever mankind faces a
crisis which cannot be solved but for his coming, he comes. If you study
the puranas carefully you will know that sometimes he comes even before the
crisis and lays out the solutions even before they are required. Who can
understand his leela!

We look forward to your second coming. But for now you will have to be
satisfied with your present status of a seeker.

I hope I have hurt you with my comments,

Your friend as always,

Jagannath
