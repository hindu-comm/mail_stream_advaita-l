Dear Kiran,

Namaskar.

Aniruddhanji and Srikrishnaji have given such wonderful answers to your
queries. They are sastravids, you should listen to them. Should I say more
(or rather do I have the qualifications to say more?)

You are not talking nonsense. The advaita knowledge must be as sure as
having a betel nut in the palm of your hand. But for having that you must
go through many purificatory procedures. See Srikrishnaji's reply to Rev
Mathews (Oneness with Brahman). It should be a eye opener for you. Take a
printout and keep it by you. It will be useful. Better still ask him for
more.

Sure. But for ensnared jivas the truth is very difficult to comprehend. The
hesitation you see in the replies to you by the list members stems from the
acute awareness that one is yet to ascertain the truth. Only a brahmavid or
an avatara can confidently answer your questions. The rest can only give
you the directions from which you should benefit.

Yes, do discuss. That (shravana/manana) is a step in the positive direction
by the seeker.

You have already got it. The veil of avidya does not get lifted so fast.
Now do you realise?

Thats nice. But besides worshipping them try to follow their teachings. One
of the first things you will notice is internal peace and the subsidence of
unnecessary questioning.

1. I call them what they are, avataras. 2. Won't it be real silly if I
asked Sri Sankaracharya to run the 100m? Moreover he has done more than
that. To travel the length and breadth of the country for the salvation of
Hindu dharma he has done more than run 100m.

Sri Shankaracharya was no ordinary jiva. Sajujya mukti or for that matter
any other mukti is not for him. Sajujya mukti is not a higher state for a
Brahmavid. Even after brahmavidya the body continues for some time. After
the body falls the brahmavid automatically attains sajujya mukti.

No, a jiva can never become Krishna whatever the height of his achievements.

Sankaracharya is an avatara of Lord Shiva. If he decides to come back again
I have no idea what he would do.

If you are an avatara surely you can.

You are very ambitious. That's good.

For spiritual satiation you have to travel the spiritual way or you can
enjoy the same just by God's grace.

Perhaps you are a grihastha. The grihastha ashrama is the highest of all
other ashramas because it is the grihastha who provides for the others. So
do not despair.

No one is picking up a fight. Why don't you realise the friendly intention
of all the forum members who are trying to solve your problems. Listen to
them and try to do as they say. It is for your own benefit.

Your friend,

Jagannath.
