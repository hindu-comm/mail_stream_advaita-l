Exactly that which Krishna was doing with those
powers.


> How will this help you to believe in ADVAITA ?

Where there is incapability (whether spiritual or
material), there is ajnaana. Who said so? I don't
know, but I definitely think so.

And who said material incapability is ajnaana? I don't
know. But I definitely think so.

If Advaita cannot show me that I have such powers too,
my belief in it will disintegrate. Why? Even after
reaching the ultimate state that can be reached by
following Advaita, if in the material world (maayaa)
my powers are limited, there remains an incapability.

It is stupid to fool ourselves into thinking that the
presence of material capability is possible only with
ajnaana. No, a jnani must have material capabilities.
Sri Shankaracharya MUST be able to run 100m in 2s.
Otherwise there remains an incapability in him. Sri
Shankaracharya must be able to make ice by heating
water. Otherwise there remains an incapability in him.


...and of course this applies to Krishna. And to all
of us.

I do not agree! My friend, ask yourself if Krishna was
deep in Dwaita. If he was, I want to be deep in
Dwaita!

Having these powers is proof NEITHER for the presence
NOR for the absence of dualism in the seeker.

However, NOT having these powers is proof for the
presence of dualism in the seeker.

Do I make sense?
