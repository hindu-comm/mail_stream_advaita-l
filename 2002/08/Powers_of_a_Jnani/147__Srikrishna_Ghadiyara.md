I think, you are taking a pessimistic view of the
world. What is wrong if an act of 'miracle' (at an
ordinary human level) is performed by the Guru to
bless the devotee ? Can you say the same thing to Sri
Sankara by whose grace Sri Trotaka sang his first
Hymns ? Do you condemn this in a similar tone ? We
know many such incidents. Why beware ???? If it is to
attract devotees and mold them to a divine path, do
you condemn it ??
