This would be grammatically correct too. In this case,
bhauma-brahman and braahmaNatva stand in apposition to
each other, instead of one qualifying the other in an
adjectival sense. I'll have to research this a little
more in depth. Perhaps there are other references in
the literature that will clarify this issue.
