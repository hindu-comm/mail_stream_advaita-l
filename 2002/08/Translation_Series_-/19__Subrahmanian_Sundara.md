Dear Sri Vidyasankar,

When you say "Law is to be observed" - does it refer to either of the paths
at any time or both simultaneously or one followed by the other?

What is Sri Sankara refering to when he says that the "Law is described in
the Vedas" (vedokta)?

Regards,
SVS

Two-fold is the Law described in the Vedas - one of action
and the other of withdrawal from action - which sustains the world.
This Law is to be observed by members of all classes, beginning with
the Brahmanas, and stations in life who desire goodness, as it directly
leads to both prosperity and liberation, the highest good [3].
