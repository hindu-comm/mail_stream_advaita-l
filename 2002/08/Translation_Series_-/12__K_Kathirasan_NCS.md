namaskaram,
  I recently saw and bought three copies of Grantha Lipi - An Introduction , a book for those who want to learn grantham. Its a small book costing Rs.5 of 48 pages. I bought it in Madurai Meenakshi Amman temple (shop opposite to vanni maraththadi vinAyagar temple).

 I'm giving the information about the publishers for all who are interested. They've a website also which has information about this book. Though, this is grantha through Tamil book, it has devanagiri script also along with tamil script. So, I feel anyone can read and understand that (You get a chance to learn Tamil also :-) )

 Contact information of publisher:

  R.Sridharan,
  Plot N T-7, First Cross,
  46th Street, Nanganallur,
  Chennai - 600 061. Tamil Nadu.
  Phone - 2321616 , 2348445

  email - sridarr at vsnl.com

namaskaram
Prasad
