The great Lord created the world, and desired to ensure its continued
existence. He first created the progenitors, the leaders of the people
(prajaa - pati), beginning with Marichi, and imparted to them the Law
(dharma) characterized by action (pravR^itti), described in the Vedas.
Then he created Sanaka, Sanandana and others, and imparted to them the
Law characterized by withdrawal from action (nivR^itti), knowledge and
dispassion. Two-fold is the Law described in the Vedas - one of action
and the other of withdrawal from action - which sustains the world.
This Law is to be observed by members of all classes, beginning with
the Brahmanas, and stations in life who desire goodness, as it directly
leads to both prosperity and liberation, the highest good [3]. In course
of time, because of the rise of desires on the part of those for whom
this Law was prescribed, and the consequent diminishing of discriminative
knowledge, unrighteousness grew in strength and overcame the Law.
Seeking to preserve the world's stability, the original creator, the
all-pervasive Lord (viShNu), who is called nArAyaNa, was born to Devaki,
from Vasudeva, as Krishna, in order to protect the divine nature of
the Vedas [4]. Only by protecting this divine nature, the Vedic Law is
protected, adherence to which protects the different classes of people.

Notes -
-----

[1] Unmanifest = avyakta - This is a technical term in sAMkhya and vedAnta
schools of thought. It refers to the primordial root form of the universe,
prior to its current manifestation.

[2] Egg = aNDa - Literally egg, aNDa is a common term to refer to the whole
universe. The word brahmaaNDa for the universe is perhaps more familiar.

[3] liberation, the highest good = niHshreyasa - Literally, niHshreyasa is
that compared to which there is nothing better. In the context of advaita
vedAnta, liberation is the highest good. Hence my translation.

[4] to protect the divine nature of the Vedas = bhaumasya brahmaNaH
braahmaNatvasya raxaNaarthaM - In my earlier attempt at translation, I had
translated this phrase differently, but that turns out to have been wrong
(http://www.advaita-vedanta.org/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind9810a&L=advaita-l&P=765).
Dr. A. G. Krishna Warrier of the Adyar Library, whose translation has been
published by Sri Ramakrishna Math (Madras, 1983), translates as follows -
"in order to safeguard the spiritual power in the world or the state of
Brahmanhood." The reason for my choosing to translate as I have done are
the following.

In the Mahabharata itself, the Shantiparvan has at least two occurrences of
the phrase bhauma brahma, where it refers to the Vedas. One of these verses
is a reference to the birth of Krishna as the son of Devaki and Vasudeva -

yaM devaM devakii devii vasudevaad ajiijanat .
bhaumasya brahmaNo guptyai diiptam agnim ivaaraNiH .. 12.47.18 ..

It seems to me that Shankara has this reference in mind when he uses the
phrase "bhaumasya brahmaNaH". The fact that he immediately refers to the
vaidika dharma in the next sentence reinforces the idea that this phrase
refers to the Vedas in the commentary also.
