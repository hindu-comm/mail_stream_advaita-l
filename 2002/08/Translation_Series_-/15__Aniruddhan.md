Satyavati's fisherman-father (I forget his name) finds her and her twin
brother in a fish's womb when he cuts the fish open. He gives the male child
to the king and raises the female child as his daughter. The fish is
actually a cursed goddess, and the genetic father of the children is either
a king or a gandharva (I'm not sure which).
