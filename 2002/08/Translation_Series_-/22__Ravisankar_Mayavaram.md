When you say "to protect the divine nature of vedas" it seems to imply
that somehow the divine nature of "vedas" could be lost and it could
get say demonic or other nature. Divinity is inhererent in veda-s and
it cannot be lost.


That sentence probably could mean "to uphold the observance of vaidika
dharma on earth and stabilize the status of brahmaNa-s.

By mentioning brahmaNatvam, stability and status of other varNa-s are
also implied.  Often when we say "my head was saved by god's grace"
(Tamil: thalai thappiththathu tampiraan puNNiyam) , rest of the body is
also implied.

braahmaNa portion of the veda-s often layout the methodology of vaidiika
karma. By mentioning it, not only veda-s are referred to, but its
observance is also emphasized. bhaumasya indicating "pertaining to earth".

Please correct me if I am wrong and I apologize if I am completely off the
mark.
