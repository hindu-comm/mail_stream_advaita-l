Hari Om!

I don't know what Sri Vidyasankar is going to say on
the subject, but I have a perception which I want to
share with the group. Atma has been used in Gita in
several senses, including mind. Intellect is one
aspect of the mind. If Pandavas are the senses, they
can be compared to horses attached to a carriage and
the reins would be thoughts, which if in the hands of
a good sarathi like Sri Krishna will lead the
Jeevatma, which the chariot represents to the
destination safely. No wonder Narayana is also called
Hrishikesa (lord of the senses, pl. correct me if I am
mistaken!).

So the allegory does seem to make sense. Pl. respond.

Hari Om

S.V.Swamy
