I agree with you and this phrase is indeed

I agree with you here too. Translating brAhmaNatva is
a tough job.

But I have a slight problem in interpretation, in the
above fragment. What I thought for 'bhaumasya
brahmaNaH brAhmaNatvasya' was bhauma and brahman being
together and brAhmaNatva being the other word.

To explain my thought - take the fragment 'sItApateH
rAmasya pUjArthaM '. Here sItApati and rAma are the
same, but sItApati just another name for rAma or can
be seen as a qualifier. In a similar vein, I thought
bhauma-brahman is the same as brAhmaNatva, and not
something that 'possesses' it. That was the reason I
saw it that way. Could you clarify my doubt here ?

Even in the following shloka,
bhaumasya brahmaNaH guptyai - for the safety or
securing of bhauma-brahman. Though bhauma-brahman is
one unit here, it could be the same as brAhmaNatva or
be something else that 'possesses' the quality of
brAhmaNatva.

Could you please clarify my doubt ?

Thanks,
