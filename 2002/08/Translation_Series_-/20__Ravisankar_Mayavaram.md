For your second question: one reference I can think of is
iishaavaasyopanishhad.

For the first question, they cannot be practised simultaneously. This is
very clearly explained in the bhaashhya of the same upanishhad.
For most poeple, typically it is one (pravRtti maarga) followed by the
other (nivRtti maarga). As it was pointed out there are also cases such as
sanaka etc, it was directly  and only nivRtti maarga.

My 2c.
