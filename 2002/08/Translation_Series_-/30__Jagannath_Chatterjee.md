It is the shaktas (Devi bhaktas) who worship prakriti.
They have a purusha alright but they feel the way to
purusha is through the appeasement of prakriti.
Misrepresentation has led to many absurd consequences.
An example is given, when Rama, Sita and Lakshmana
walk together Lakshana does not have darshana of Rama
as Sita comes inbetween Rama and Lakshmana. So
Lakshmana has to first pray to Sita to kindly step
aside so that he can have a darshan of Rama. Prakriti
is not equated with Purusha but is considered to be a
powerful agent and almost the equal of purusha. This
prakriti has to be worshipped. However shaktas also
believe that purusha and prakriti are equal
manifestations of the same Self. We can here refer to
the Ardhanariswar aspect of Shiva.

Jagannath
