Namaste,

List members interested in learning more about
gAyatri might want to study bRhadAraNyaka 5.14
and 6.3.

There is also a sAvitri upaniShad, a very small
upaniShad. The upaniShad can be obtained from
http://lavanya.aros.net/sanskrit/all_pdf/savitri_u.pdf
Seems related to gAyatri.

Shrinivas Gadkari
