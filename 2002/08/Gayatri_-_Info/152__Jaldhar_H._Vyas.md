Whenever I do a full japa of Gayatri, I recite the three shapavimochana
mantras. The Gayatri is under three
curses:

1. The curse of Brahmaji

Gayatri is the daughter of Brahma but He lusted after Her.  As a result
of this primordial incest the creation was marred by evil.  He cursed Her
and She in return cursed Him not to be worshipped.

2. The curse of Maharshi Vasishta.

I  wasn't able to find out the details of this one.

3. The curse of Maharshi Vishvamitra.

He was a Kshatriya who wanted to become a Brahmana.  When his efforts
failed he cursed the Gayatri mantra out of frustration.
