Namaste all,

Has anyone picked this up and is preparing an answer?

I am not the required learned person but if no one
else comes along I will post some pages from a
monograph on the MahAvAkyas written by Dr.
T.N.Ganapathy. In it he explains sAmAnAdhikaraNyam
before  showing their relevance to the MahAvAkyas.

Will you please let me know if this would be of any
use,

ken Knight
