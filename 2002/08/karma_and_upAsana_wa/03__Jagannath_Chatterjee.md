Jaladharji, somehow I cannot accept that upasana is a stumbling process. As
a advaitin you can negate the process of realisation as "ignorance" but
does it remain "ignorance" when one chalks out the path and walks on it? I
find upasana very enchanting and meaningful. No, I am not attracted more to
the means rather than the end. My aim remains "full and perfect
understanding". But I cannot adopt the dry reasoning of Jnana Yoga alone, I
enrich my upasana with Bhakti and Karma also. Am I wrong?

Regards

Jagannath
