What is this Upasana like ? (Is this same as the
Bhakti-worship of murthi?)

sambhutimcha vinasamcha ...)

When the Samkhya, Yoga, Mahayajnikas are refuted in
the Upanishat, how is it possible that Upanishat can
refute the paths which have come later than itself ?

Based on your translation Karma is opposite (in the
sense that it gives different results) to Vidya
(upasana). And we defined that here Vidya was not same
as Jnana, then how is the above statement accepted
based on Isa ? Or is it referring to some other
Upanishad ?

Is it to be interpreted that upasana is caused by
knowledge of ones true self ???

Om Namo Narayanaya !!
