It is not made clear in the bhashya itself but from elsewhere I gather it
is meditation and yogic exercises etc.

Yes.  Though note even "mental" bhakti could fall in this category.  The
chief thing is not whether there is a murti or not but whether there is a
feeling of apartness or not.

Those who meditate become absorbed into unmanifest prakrti.  Those who
worship reach various worlds of the Gods.

Shankaracharya says the word sambhutim is an irregular construction
and should be read as asambhutim.

The Vedic texts contain the seeds of all the various darshans but their
systemization was a long process of refinement.  Shankaracharya doesn't
doubt that all these schools don't have _some_ validity (they are all
Astika after all.) it is that Advaita Vedanta gives the best all round
explanation and the others fall short.

What we have today in the sutras of the various darshanas is not the start
point but the culmination of a lot of discussion and analysis.  Sometimes
a particular idea became a dead end, sometimes it resulted in a split into
two rival groups.  But eventually the adherents of a particular view
settled upon some normative positions which were recorded in their sutras.

Kathopanishad as noted below.

Once a person has the idea that ones self is more than just the body the
processes by which he stumbles towards a full and perfect understanding
can be called upasana.
