I did not check other words.  Whether a transliteration is correct or
not depends on the scheme.  Following is based on ITRANS.

You can convert and verify at

> > Tayumanavar
>
> tAyumAnavar

thAyumA^navar - note Tamil has an additional ^n which comes Ra ^na.
This is besides the tha na. ITRANS is strict about this. Many other
schemes have built-in intelligence to detect (most of the time) the
correct one.


> > Tevaram
>
> tevAram

thEvAram - note Tamil has e and E, also o and O. In Skt there is only E
and O (in terms of Tamil).
