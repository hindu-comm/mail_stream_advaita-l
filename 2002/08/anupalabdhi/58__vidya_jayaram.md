Namaste.

I would like to know it there was there any previous discussion on anupalabdhi as a pramANa? I was unable to understand the explanations and arguments about anupalabdhi or non-apprehension as a separate pramANa [as given  in the vedAnta paribhAshA ]

It would be helpful if someone could throw light on this pramANa in laymans' terms.- basically my questions boil down to this :

1.What exactly is anupalabdhi

2.Why is it dealt as a separate pramANa

I would be grateful if someone could explain this in a little more clearly or give me some pointers in the archives or in the site.





Thanks

Vidya
