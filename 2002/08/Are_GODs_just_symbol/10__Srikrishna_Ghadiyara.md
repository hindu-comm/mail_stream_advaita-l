entities:
Prakriti, purusha, and Iswara ?

  From the (a b c)(d) example - redness seems to be the lakshaNa.
If (a b c) are red crystals and (d) is a blue crystal - the redness which is the lakshaNa separates it from blue crystal. But when both a
and b in this  case are  red crystals what is upAdhi here that separates a from b (with respect to crystals and their colors) ?
