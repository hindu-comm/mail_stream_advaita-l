To the question "Can you run 100m in 2s?", the answer
is either Yes or No. An answer different from either
Yes or No is not an answer. The answer better be one
of the two. I am making no assumptions here.

There is no need to bring in multivariate logic here.
If you think the answer is Yes, say Yes. If you think
the answer is No, say No. Don't say Yes when you want
to say No. Don't say No when you want to say Yes.

Others questions may have an answer other than Yes or
No. Not this one. Can you run 100m in 2s? I mean you,
Srikrishna, can you run 100m in 2s? Answer me.
