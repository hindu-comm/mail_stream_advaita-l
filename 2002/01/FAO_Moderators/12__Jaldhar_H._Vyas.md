Write to listmaster at advaita-vedanta.org when you are ready to stop.  We
will put you on hold rather than remove you because with Bhagawans krpa

mAyA and related words appear at many places in RigVeda.
Though it is true that concepts "measure" "constraint", "limitation"
are associated with mA, but it is to be interpreted in a special way :

Nighantu gives following concept clustering :

mAyA - praj~nAnAmAni (3-9),  i.e., knowledge (w/o capital K)
                    e.g  cittam

The meaning is : one which leads to knowledge (but lower knowledge or ordinary
knowledge).

A related word used at several places in RigVeda is
mAyu.h -  which is clustered as vA"ngnAmAni, (Nigh. 1-11)
                    i.e. equivalent to vaak (the languages of the Brain)

It is via vaak that we human beings are aware of and think about
the percieved world, so at the same time it is a power and a constraint.

The meaning is again one which gives knowledge but limited or constrained
knowledge.

Thus mAyA is something which gives constrained or limited knowledge, which
later on developed into its present
interpretation.

Hope this helps.

namasthe,

I heard from many learned elders advising bramhachAris to takeup gruhasthAshramA with a vAkyA from the vedas.

  "prajayA hi manushyaH pUrNaH"

Can someone explain the significance of this vAkyA ? As well the significance of pitru tharpaNam ?  If possible, the relationship between these two.

Why has it been declared in Vedas that a man is complete only if he gives birth ?  What happens to one  who is not able to give birth  in his/her present jenma  (will he/she be reborn ? )   Commentaries on Brahma Sutras by Swami Krishnananda has two paragraphs as following

<<Jiva or soul, for the purpose of our subject, is a concentrated point of desire. The soul that we are discussing about here is not the Universal Soul; it is rather the bound soul and no one can be bound unless there is a concentralisation of desire at a spatio-temporal point.

It is desire that is born, not a child. The human being is a shape taken by a mass of desires. Every cell of our body is made up of desires. It vibrates with desires -- any number of desires. But since any number of desires cannot be fulfilled through a single body, a certain set of desires is chosen intelligently for the purpose of fulfilling them through a single incarnation. >>

If this is so, then is giving birth just helping a set of desires to takeup a body so that it continues fulfilling itself ?

If one does not give birth Or is not able to give birth, is a different set of parents selected for the soul to be given a body ? I dont know whether the very sentance "soul is taking a body" is right or not.  As well, the process of a souls  getting a bodies is not (if not "is not", it should be atleast "should not") going to stop when a set of parents are not able to give birth. In which case, why cant one intentionally refrain from giving birth ?

Hows this veda vAkyA applicable to sannyasis and others who get/dont get liberation in the present Jenma?
