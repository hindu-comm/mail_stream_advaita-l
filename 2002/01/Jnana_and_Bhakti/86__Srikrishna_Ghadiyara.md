I would also recommend "Laghu vasudeva Mananam".
I read at first the book, "An Introduction to Advaita Vedanta Philosophy"
(translation of LVM) by Swami Tejomayananda of Divine Life Society. As
there was some confusion in my mind because of translated nomenclature, I
decided to read  another translation by Swami Tapasyananda of Ramakrishna
Math. You may read these two translations.

Om Namo Narayanaya !!
