namo namaH,
       That was a very good synopsis written by shrI
ravi. All the points have been written really well.
       Personally, I feel 'mutually exclusive' is
another good phrase to explain the relationship
between karma and jnAna. Where there is karma, there
is no jnAna and vice-versa. This has been brought out
very well in shrI shankara's rejection of the
jnAna-karma-samucchaya-vAda in the prologue of the
gItAbhAShya.
dhanyavAdAH,
Raghavendra
