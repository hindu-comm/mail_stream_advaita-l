Namaste All,

Consider the following scenario:

You are watching a sunset. You admire the beauty of
the scene and become one with it.

When you admire the beauty you are a bhakta.
When you are one with it, you are a Jnani.

Would you not agree that when viewed this way, bhakti
and Jnana are inseparable.

Best regards
Shrinivas Gadkari
