Hari Om !!

I have been reading several books during the last 1
1/2  years. Based on my personal experience the most
concise and effective presentation is found in
"Advaita Bodha Deepika" " Lamp of Non-Dual Knowledge"
published by Sri Ramanasramam. This book not only
defines Advaita but stress is on realisation. I
believe you will benefit most by reading this book.

Om Namo Narayanaya !!

Srikrishna
