Is it so? I have asked the same question to many
vaishnavas.
Their answers vary. Some say that the bhAgavata purANa and
some other works do mention buddha as an avatAra but he is
a
rogue avatAra who came to delude people by denying the
 vedas!
One Shri VaiShNava scholar that I spoke to was vehement in
denying that buddha was an avatAra. This corresponds to
what
 I know as well. The "list" AFAIK is :
1) matsya
2) kUrma
3) varAha
4) narasimha
5) vAmaNa
6) parashurAma
7) dasaratharAma
8) balarAma
9) krishna
and ....
10) kalki ( yet to come )

  Also, considering buddha the ninth avatAra would make him
the kali yuga avatAram. But, the purport of gItA and the
bhAgavata purANa is to apply for kali yuga especially.
How do we reconcile all of these inconsistencies?

-Vivek.
