Namaste,
Thanks to you and Vishal for this addition to our
thread. Since my last posting I 'Googled' and found
that the complete translation by H.P.Shastri of
Dattatreya's Avadhut Gita is available on the Web. I
also found that Amazon has cheap copies of two
versions with the Sanskrit transliteration. If people
have not met this work may I recommend it as a direct
advaitin text.
Om sri ram
ken knight
