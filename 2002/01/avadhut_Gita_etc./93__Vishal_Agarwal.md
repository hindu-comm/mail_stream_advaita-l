Dear Swaminarayan
Many thanks for this information. H.P.Shastri's
version..which I have..has no Sanskrit, just his
English translation so I must seek another version. He
has not said that he has abridged the text but clearly
has.

VA: Please note that the Avadhuta Gita is itself a part of the Uddhava Gita,
which is in turn included in Skandha X of the Srimad Bhagavata Purana.

Regards

Vishal
