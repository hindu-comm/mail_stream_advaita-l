Please note that not all vaishnavas share the same ideology. The views of
Gaudiya Vaishnavas and that of Sri Vaishavas differ a lot, they both are
not the same kittens in the litter. If you are refering to ISKCON's prabhu-
pada who always goes about telling "mayavada et all......" you are not
refering to all Vaishnavas per se. Speaking purely logically, Vaishanavas
cannot be defined by Narasimha Mehta's song. Although his song represents
perhaps one of the few qualities of needed for not only vaishanavas bu
aastikaas also.

This was not the purpose of my post. My post was purely meant to
philosophically understand how Adi Shankara classifys the avataras and his
views on Pradyumna, Sankarshana and the vyuha theory. I never intended to
discuss on itihiiya.
