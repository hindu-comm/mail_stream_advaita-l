The philosophy of the hare krishna's regarding krishnAstu bhagavan swayam
stems from a gross mis-understanding of the tarka sastras used to
understand the meaning and the purport of Srimad Bhagavatam which is
regarded as the fountain head of hare krishna thought and theology.

I shall write to the list on how the hare krishna's understand the concept
of purna avatara over the long weekend.
