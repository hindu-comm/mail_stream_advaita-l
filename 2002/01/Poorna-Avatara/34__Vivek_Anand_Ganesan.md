Please do. Could you also cover the following two aspects
which have long troubled me,
1. Hare krishna-s interpret the gita as though bhagavan
   is speaking in first person, while traditions that I am
   familiar with have always taught me that bhagavan does
   not speak as krishna per se, but as God ( vishnu ).
   How do shri vaishnavas interpret this?
2. Hare krishna-s also maintain that somehow krishna is
   even higher than vishnu ( which is absurd considering
   krishna is an avatar of vishnu ). So, in what sense, are
   they vaishnavas? Perhaps, you can touch on this point as
   well.

Thanks and Regards,

-Vivek.
