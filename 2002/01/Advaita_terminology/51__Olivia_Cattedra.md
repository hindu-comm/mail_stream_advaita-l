Namaste,

This quotation from ADvaita Bodha Deepika not seemps very clearly. Subtle
body, minf asnd antahkarana are not exactly identical terms. Mind
(manas?, ), is in the subtle body (suksma sarira), but in it there is also
another levels,such as the kosha made of prana, which is the one
constituited by the winds , vayu and others, and the other made by vijnana.
I suggest you to read the Taittiriya Up for a clear distintion in these
levels,
Om!
