Hello,
Can somebody explain about "Om namah Shri Shambhave Swatmananda prakasha
VapushayE"?
What is described as Swatmananda?

There was one saint called Shridhar Swamy some 40 years ago. He was a well
known Advaitic saint in Maharastra and Karnataka. He belonged to Samartha
parampara. He blessed the mankind with this mantram:
Om Namah Shantaya divyaaya satyadharma swarUpiNe
Swanandamrita triptAya shrIdharAya namOnamah

is the "Swaanandamrita Tripti" same as Swatmananda Prakasha?
I am greatful if somebody could be able to write about whole shivasutram.

Shridhar Dixit
