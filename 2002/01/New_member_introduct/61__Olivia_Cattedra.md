  A distinction can be made between Bhakti and Bhakti maarga even as between jnaana and jnaana maarga.

  Jnaana means intuition of the Atman which effects liberation. Jnaana maarga is the path of intellectual analysis and self introspection which primarily involves self effort as a means to attain jnaana. But again according to Shankara himself whatever might be our efforts at jnaana maarga ultimately surrender or bhakti is inevitable. 

  Even according to the bhakti schools of Vedaanta it is only knowledge (jnaana) of one's own self which effects liberation. But instead of the jnaana maarga, they suggest the Bhakti maarga where surrender is made at a much earlier stage.
