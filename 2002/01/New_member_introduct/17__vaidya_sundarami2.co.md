Re: Welcome and Request for more info.
Namaste,
This is in reply to your mail. I have recently come in touch with the
teachings if Advaita through the book swamy Vivekanada's "Lectures from
colombo to almora". I am very much impressed by the universality of the
tenets. Now I am trying to learn more about advaita by studying various
books like Upanishads, Atma bodha . I want to learn more by discussions
with some teachers of vedanta.

sincerely,
Akki reddy.
