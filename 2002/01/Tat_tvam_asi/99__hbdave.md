The last paragraph attracted me to write this response.

The answer is NO, "I" sense can not be attributed to Atman, in the way
that we normally
understand "I".

In all humility I would ask Nanda if he has experience of meditation.
Then it may be easier to talk about the very interesting questions he
has raised.

Alternatively, see  if the following diagram makes any sense  to you :

Atman does not "know" anything, taking the ordinary sense of the word
"know".
As soon as you say "I", you are also talking about  "non-I" ! So Atman
cannot say
"I".
The trouble is we are talking and discussing something which is
"achintya" can not be
even thought about (by our limited mind ).

{I am breaking my self-imposed silence, but Nanda's questions were too
challenging!}
