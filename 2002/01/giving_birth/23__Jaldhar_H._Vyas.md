That Swamiji was correct that it is the performance of the rite which is
essential and stories mentioned in the same context are only to illustrate
some aspect of the performance.  (Arthavada is indeed the correct term btw)

However it is the popular belief to this day hat the offering of shraddha
maintains the pitrs in their celestial abode.  Arjuna says in 1.42:

patanti pitaro hyeShAM luptapinDodakakriyaAH ||

the pitrs fall there (into naraka as mentioned in the first half of the
shloka) due to the omission of the rites of offering pindas (i.e shraddha)

A commonly given (though not grammatically correct) etymology of putra is
the one who saves his ancestors from the hell known as pu-naraka.

It is true that this poses a problem philosophically.  Why should the
action or inaction of another cause me to lose the fruits of my own
actions?  Perhaps we can say that the ancestors by their desire for
progeny have bound up their fate with that of their descendents.
Remember the statement that man only becomes complete through his
children?  It would be interesting to see if any of our Acharyas have
taken up this issue.
