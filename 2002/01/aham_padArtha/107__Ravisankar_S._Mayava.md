There is a small section in vivekachuuDamaNiH which is known as "aham
padArtha nirupaNam".  The term "aham" should take to denote "sAxi" or
witness.  There is a verse starting with "aham padaartha tu ahamaadi
saaxi". Starting from ahamkAra to everything, it (the aham pada) stands
a witness.

Please refer.
