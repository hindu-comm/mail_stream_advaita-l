I think it would be less confusing if you reserved the word jnana for the
third type.  The first two types would more properly be vijnana.  Vijnana
means science in modern Indian languages but here I mean all types of
"reasoning about facts".

The seventh adhyaya of the Gita explains the difference between vijnana
and jnana.
