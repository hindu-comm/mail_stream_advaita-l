Sri Ramanuja's philosophy doesn't agree that "anything 
that has a beginning and an end must be unreal", which 
is the crux of Advaita. That's why per Visistadvaita 
even when someone mistakes rope for a snake, the snake 
is real in the eyes of the person for that much time 
since the effects like "sweating", "screaming" are all 
real and just in the same fashion the jagat is *real* 
since it's experienced as is.

Regards,
chandrasekaran.
