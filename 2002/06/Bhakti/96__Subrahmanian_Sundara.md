Yes.  But please be careful in the usage of the words and the context.
Persons in (2) and (3) are still in samsara.  Only (1) is free.

Initially a seeker after hearing from Guru and reading scriptures gets an
idea of what brahman is {2}
Makes effort to prepare his mind to understand what is implied by the
Guru/Scripture's teaching {3}
Understands and is liberated {1}

Regarding the license to use the word "jnAna" for all three, please consult
some scholar on this matter.

Check if somebody in this list can help.

Regards,
SVS

So, it would appear, at least from the messgaes I've received from everyone,
that jnana is used in 3 common ways:

1) as PramA (Knowledge of Brahman)
2) Knowledge of Brahman as object
3) As a process leading to pramA (jnana yoga)


Any comments or corrections?
