Yes, ambaa.org has some articles and information on kAmAxI amman.

I should add -- at this point www.ambaa.org is out of date by more than
a year, as shrii Vishvarupaji who was actively maintaining it  has
other commitments to attend. Probably, we will start updating ambaa.org
later this year.

But members, can search the WWW site of ambaa-L
(http://groups.yahoo.com/group/ambaa-l/messages) or post their
questions there. In principle, anyone can post a message there (it will
come to me for moderation). Probably, I will fwd this question there.

Besides, there is a site called templenet.com which a wealth of
resources on different temples in India. For instance:

trilinga question

http://www.templenet.com/Andhra/draksha.html
http://www.templenet.com/Andhra/sailam.html
http://www.templenet.com/Andhra/kalahasti.html

(kAnchi mahAperiyavA also has a talk on trilinga xetram in Hindu Dharma
 where he point out that the land has the aspect Shiva and the language
telugu has the aspect of shakti)
