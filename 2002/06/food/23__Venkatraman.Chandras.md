  I am not sure if it is Harichandra. There is a story about 
Manu Chakravarthi, I think, who gives his flesh to a vulture 
to save a pigeon which takes refuge on his lap. The vulture
and the pigeon were actually devas in disguise.

Jaldhar, were you going to post the "Kunthi Stuthi"? Just checking..
Please let's know.

Thanks and regards,
chandrasekaran.
