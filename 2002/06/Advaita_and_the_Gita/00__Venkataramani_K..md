Dear Sri.Hemant,

Very true. Often times, I must admit, that I don't necessarily grasp the
purport of what Sri Aurobindo writes. It may be due to the fact that I
approach the writings with certain pre-defined conceptions, which Sri
Aurobindo sees very differently. That was a nice sonnet. Is it from
"Savitri"?

Regards,
K.Venkataramani
