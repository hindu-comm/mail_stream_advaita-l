I fully agree with Mr Mayavaram's opinion. Unless a living tradition is
preserved.......u never know what will happen. And preserving it means
following it to the point as close as possible. Not to our convenience. As
long as u use PCs, internet, eat food from the various joints, flaunt ur
wealth and ur knowledge of Shastras, Vedanta etc and be proud of ur Bhakti
and Prapatti, live in an Aircon apartment, travel luxuriously and
comfortably etc etc etc......
You GOTTA do ur karma, follow ur swadharma, no matter how purified YOU THINK
u are. If you are not doing so, you are just imagining things. Look at at
this way.....suppose u abandon ur swadharma and karmas as ordained in the
Shruti and Smriti........ U go on Self realization or God realization
trail........(sitting amidst all these paraphernalia and letting ur mind go
behind self !!)......suppose u die.....without realizing ur SELF......what
happens?? U are not a Jeevan muktha......neither a
Videhamuktha............but end up as a Karmabrashtaa!!! God gave u an
opportunity and u let it go!!! Will not ur being a Karmabrashtaa affect the
predicament of ur next birth? Even if all ur Bhakti and Sadhana comes to ur
rescue and saves u from the predicament, hwere do u stand? You are back to
Square one!! Born again.....in a good family because of ur Purvajanma
vaasanas and Punyaas........but in the same place as u started now!!!
Will it Help??

My 2c
