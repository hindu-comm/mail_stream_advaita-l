So do these reasons in anyway deny that the mathaas are organisations or the
mathaadhipathis are preceptors?

Just because they don't do things the Christian or Islamic way, doesn't in
anyway mean that they aren't organized. The mathaas and their heads do
things their own way - it is their own style of organization.

Hindus, especially the Western educated variety, should rise above narrow
definitions of terms solely based on western concepts.
