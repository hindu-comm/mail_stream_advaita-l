Hari Om. I would say the initial stages are when one's
mind is being pulled and pushed by the bonds of
materialistic desires and the desire to break free
from those desires. Atma Jnana is probably like sun
behind clouds, which occassionally move away and
reveal the sun. Even this stage is probably obtained
by a lot of Purva Janma Punyam.

When the mind is pure, Kama steps aside and Rama
starts shining forth. As mentioned in Sri Tripura
Rahasya, this stage may be transitory, but with
Sadhana the stage of mental purity and the consequent
Atma Anand grows stronger and ultimately, the Sadhaka
is always in that blissful state. Probably this part
ansers Sri Jaladhar's query also.
