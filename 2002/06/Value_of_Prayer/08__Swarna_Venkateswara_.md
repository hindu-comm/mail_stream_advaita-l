Hari Om. does that mean that while trying to break
free of Karma, one has to still do one's swadharma,
enjoined in the sastras? If one does develop true atma
jnanam, karma becomes infructuous. Only karma is
needed to purify the mind in the initial stages. Once
a pure mind is obtained, the true self starts shining
through and only bhakti is necessary to preserve the
purity and to prevent the mushrooming of the petty ego
again.

I would like to await the reaction of the other
learned members.
