A very nice observation.

In the case smArta-sampradAya, learning starts more from practice. For
instance, doing trikAla sandhya vandanam is more important, even if one
does not initially understand all details.  That is what makes the
difference between a living and dead tradition.  A smArta, knows,
understand, and preserves his tradition through practice.

Mere academic knowledge without actual practise is a like beautiful but
dead lady. So are the websites of people whose intention is merely
academic.  A pregnant sentence from one practising the dharma is more
useful that thousand websites with lot of data. That is why discussions
on this list often becomes useless and futile.

My 2c.
