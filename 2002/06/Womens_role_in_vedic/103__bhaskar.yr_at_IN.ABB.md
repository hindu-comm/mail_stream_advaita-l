Hare Krishna,

Today I have read an article in a daily news paper that a woman has
conducted more than 250 marriages & numerous anthima samskAras (funeral
rights).  She has been honoured for this by local rotary club in the
presence of some orthodox male vedic scholars.  It is mentioned that she
said in that function NO SCRIPTURAL reference is available as to woman is
not eligible to do vedic samskAras.  Any explanation from the learned
members??

 Hari Hari Hari Bol!!
bhaskar
