Namaste Kenji and members interested in this topic,

Picking this topic after a break of about a month.
You have pointed that ra is agni bIja, and have been
struggling to understand the relation between the
sound ra and agni.

My contemplation makes me associate ra with roaring
sound rrrrrrr... . Roaring is a manifestation of anger.
This is the closest I could get to agni.

Then Shra has to do with quieting anger. (Since in
an earlier post I gave reasons to associate Sh with
quieting).

Comments are welcome.

Best regards
Shrinivas Gadkari
