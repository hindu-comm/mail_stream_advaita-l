The Lord says "They ascribe to Me caste, though I am casteless and feet,
hands, ears, eyes and lineage and habituation, though I do not possess on
any one of these.  Although I am self-existent, they make an idol of Me and
consecrate it and although I pervade everything, they invoke Me and dismiss
Me.  Thus making and idol of Me, they worship it and when it breaks they
throw it away.  Infact they ascribe to Me all human qualities.

>  Hare Krishna,  prabhuji, can you quote me the exact verse reference in
BG for this.  Thnx in adv.

>Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
