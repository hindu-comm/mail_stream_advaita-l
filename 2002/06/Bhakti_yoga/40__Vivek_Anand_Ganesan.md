There is a theory that this purANam was probably written
by a devout tamil Sri Vaishnava extolling the virtues of
the tamil Azhvar saints and the concept of prapatti. Also,
I heard recently from a friend in another e-list ( who
happends to be somewhat pro-ISKCON ) that some scholars
opine that the language of the bhAgavatam is more "vedic"
than classical sanskrit. Any comments?

Thanks,

-Vivek.

 Namaste to all
I wanted to correct the last paragraph.
In fact there are considered to be 4 types of Mukti or Moksha.

Saayujyata
Samipata
Salokata
Saroopta.

of these saayujyataa is considered of the greatest importance.
