This is the peril of translation which is why I prefer using Sanskrit
terms as much as possible.  But God does suffice to express the sense of
Brahman as the cause of the universe and as an object of adoration.

The key thing is "God" would no longer exist _as_a_seperate_entity_.  Like
when you think about "Stephanie Stean" you include your hands, feet et. in
the definition right?  In some contexts you mention them seperately but
most they are all subsumed in the sense "I" without a second thought.  The
jnani simply extends this natural feeling until it includes everything.
Thus he can talk about God yet he feels this God is no different to him
than his own hand.
