Hello:

I have a couple of questions.

1)  Could you direct me to where/ which text Sankara discussed bhakti yoga
(If he did)?

2)  If bhakti only refers to devotion towards a personal god, then what is
the Sanskrit term to describe devotion to Brahman (Ultimate Reality)?

3)  If we show devotion towards family or plants or whatever temporal
object, even though we are ultimately seeing Brahman in those objects, is
there also a different term used to describe this type of devotion?

Thanks for your time and information.

Stephanie
