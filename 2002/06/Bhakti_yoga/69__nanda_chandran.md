How would you know? Are you talking out of personal experience or are you
speculating?

Don't take it personally - just that such transcendental questions are best
left alone. Best to contemplate on what pure consciousness is and why pure
consciousness is defined as advaita. If you understand that you'll
immediately realize why Shankara's commentary is called the Shaareeraka
bhaashyam.
