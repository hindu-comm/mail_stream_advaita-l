A lot of such speculations are predicated on the idea that Bhakti is
"un-aryan" and had to come from somewhere else.  However the evidence of
Heliodorus etc. proves the existence of the Bhagavatas in northern India
in atleast the 2nd century BC  which is way before the alwars.  Whether
the Bhagavata Purana itself is that old is uncertain but the ideas in it
most certainly are.

There are some words uses in the Bhagavata which are ungrammatical in a
Paninian sense.  So some have speculated they are pre-paninian or perhaps
influenced by a Dravidian language.
