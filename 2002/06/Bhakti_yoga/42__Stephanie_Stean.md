Hello:

The way I had interpreted the comments of Bhakti being the same as jnana,
was not that they "were the same/ synonymous" but that during moksha, there
exist no distinctions between any of the paths.  They all become one/
intersect.  I read this recently in an introduction to Sankaracharya's Atma
Bodha, by Vidyaratna P.N. Menon.
Is this what was meant?

I have another question for the group.  The idea of jnana and bhakti being
ONE during moksha; Can anyone give me some references of where this idea is
covered more thoroughly?

Thanks
Stephanie
