Partly personal experience.  I do feel quite close to God at times.  And
sometimes I don't but overall I would say that I do.  What I don't know
from personal experience is whether this is the same as (or approaching)
jnana but I have the reliable testimony of the shastras on that.  Just as
I have no personal experience of being a millionaire but I know that
investing my money is a sure path to that goal.
