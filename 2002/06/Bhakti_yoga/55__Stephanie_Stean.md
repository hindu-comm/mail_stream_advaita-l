I must not have been clear.  I apologize. I was looking for evidence in
commentaries or other writings (not scriptural texts only).
So Shri Ramana, Shri Ramakrishna, Acharya, if they discuss the
inseparability of jnana and bhakti (or the oneness of the two, the sameness
of the two)  then that is exactly what I'm looking for.
So yes, my interest in this is academic.

Thanks
Stephanie
