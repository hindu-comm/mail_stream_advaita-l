The quote is from the book titled "Jnaneshwari" by Sri M. R. Yardi and
published by Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, 1995.

The location of the quote is in page xxi of Preface.  It says it is from
Ovis (155-170).  I think Ovi is a Marathi meter/stanza.  It is part of the
commentary for BG 9.11.  Stanza 9.11 translated in the words of the author -
"Fools scoff at me who have taken this human form, not knowing My higher
nature as the great Lord of all beings".  The quoted section can be found in
the commentary portion of this stanza.

FYI:  I know your leanings (ISKCON).  I would not want to enter into an
argument on this matter.

Also, on the side - long ago (1.5 years ago), you had asked for some
information about the source of the shloka that appears in the prarthana
section of the Andhra-sampradAya-sandhyAvandanam, starting "SivAya vishnu
rUpAya, Siva rUpAya vishNavE...".  It is from SkandOpanishad.

Regards,
SVS

The location of the quote is in page xxi of Preface.  It says it is from
Ovis (155-170).  I think Ovi is a Marathi meter/stanza.  It is part of the
commentary for BG 9.11.  Stanza 9.11 translated in the words of the author
-
"Fools scoff at me who have taken this human form, not knowing My higher
nature as the great Lord of all beings".  The quoted section can be found
in
the commentary portion of this stanza.

>  Thanks for your immediate & prompt clarification.  Just i was wondering,
whether it was directly taken from BG verse, coz. the commentary portion
which you have quoted starts with *the lord says* that is the reason why I
got confused.  Anyway, it is now clear that it is from author's purports.

FYI:  I know your leanings (ISKCON).  I would not want to enter into an
argument on this matter.

>  prabhuji, I have stopped debating on mundane issues very long back since
I have come into contact with Sri Jaldhar prabhuji & Sri vidya shankar
prabhuji.  With their sincere efforts, I think now am able to contemplate
on my sAdhana without any biased view points. So, prabhuji, pls. be clear
that I too donot want to indulge in anymore arguments on this.

Also, on the side - long ago (1.5 years ago), you had asked for some
information about the source of the shloka that appears in the prarthana
section of the Andhra-sampradAya-sandhyAvandanam, starting "SivAya vishnu
rUpAya, Siva rUpAya vishNavE...".  It is from SkandOpanishad.

>  prabhuji, onceagain, pls. accept my heartfelt praNAms to you for your
kind remembrance & clarifications  .  Infact, I got it clarified long back
from Sri Jayaram Ganapathi Shastrigal of Kanchi mutt.
