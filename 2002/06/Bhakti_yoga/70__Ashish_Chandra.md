But does it matter whether or not one is talking from personal experience
or not? How do we even know the person is a jnani (jivanmukta) when we
ourselves have no experience of what that is. But we all believe that Adi
Shankara was a jivanmukta and so are the hundreds of saints throughout
Indian today.

If we can read and believe the scriptures when they talk of transcendental
matters, why can't we talk about it?

When the Master says "Sab Ek" and I ask him whether he is talking from
personal experience and he says yes, then what am I to do? Once I believe
him, what does it matter that Jaldhar or you repeat what he says? I see no
harm in the latter. Do you?

regards,
ashish
