Yes, fully agreed. If my initial response is read fully, this is what I tried to
convey.  But I understood that the questioner wanted a reference from
scriptures and as far as I know, they are not available directly stating
that Jnana and Bhakti are the same.

Of course, interpretation of Shri Ramana is correct.

I again beg to refer to my full initial response. I am  very respectfully
aware of teachings of Shri Ramana. The question here was, as I
understood, a reference from scriptures.

The point I was trying to convey is this : though the most trusted and
profound interpretation of Vedas lead to what Vibhutis like Shri
Ramana say (i.e. Jnana and Bhakti are the same), in scripture there
are no direct references to it. We understand this only from the
interpretations by persons of acievement like  Acharya,
Shri Ramana or Shri RamaKrishna and many others.

In fact this is the reason that I asked the questioner : "is your query
for academic purposes or for clarifying path of spiritual progress?'"
because in the later case the interpretations are fully acceptable, and
indeed highly beneficial,
but in the former case (depending upon the project supervisor  :-(   )
such interpretive references may not be adequate.


Best  wishes to all.
