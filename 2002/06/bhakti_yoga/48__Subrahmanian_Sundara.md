I do NOT know if jnAna is used to indicate both the path and the act of
cognition.

But certainly the word jneya is used in two senses:

jneya - jAyatE iti jneya - that which is known
jneya - jAyatE anena iti jneya - that by which <something> is known

B. Gita uses these words in both contexts.

So as an extrapolation probably we can use jnAna to mean both the process
and cognition.

For example, jnana, is often defined as more of an intellectual knowledge.
I see the use of the word as describing a path of intellectual knowledge,
which is not what it seems Shanskara is saying.
The Knowledge that is Bhakti, is far beyond just intellectual understanding.
