Dear List Members,

Shri Ganeshaya Namah

While studying Shankara's beautiful poem "Bhaja Govindam", I had
difficulties to analyse the word "dukrnkarane" in the refrain. With the help
of Monier-Williams' dictionary I didn't succeed.
Can I find a devanagari-version of "Bhaja Govindam" on the Internet?  A
PDF-document  of a bi-lingual version (Devanagari-English) will also be welcome.
Is there anybody of the members who can be helpful?
Thanking you in advance,

Hari Om!

Erik Mossel
