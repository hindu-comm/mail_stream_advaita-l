Thank you for taking my comments with open mind. I
only wanted to caution you so that we do not hurt the
other person, by our wront estimate of others. (I too
would do such mistakes). Also, we may get more from
teh other person, if we recognise their true worth.
That is what I meant. But, you/I should continue to
ask fearlessly, until all doubts are cleared.

That is what I said, "Please do not go on calling
'things' by whatever name you want'. They are all
already well defined. If you create new definitions,
all the books will be of no use to you, because they
are not written as per your definitions".

Prakriti which is nothing but Maya and MIND of the
individual, functions with its different aspects. With
the support of Consciousness (superimposing the
Consciousness on itself) the MIND (Antahkarana) acts
as 'I'. This expression of MIND is called 'Ahamkara'.
So, MIND is nothing but Ahamkara. The same Ahamkara
functions as 'Abhimani' with 'Mine-ness'. As
'Ahamkara' itself is a mode or Vritti of MIND-STUFF,
and insentient, it needs the illuminating piwer of
Consciousness.

It is the Jiva (you/I) who is cognising the modes of
the mind by arrogating the mind vrittis to ourselves.
The Ahamkara gets reinforced, and goes on the cycle of
buildingup its 'I-ness'. When ignored, it stops
working so the essential nature of Jiva is realised.
by the 'Jiva'.

There is no third entity in this, (except the
paramatma. Jivatma and Paramatma are one. I personally
need some more understanding in this part. So, I can
not say much.)

Om Namo Narayanaya !!
