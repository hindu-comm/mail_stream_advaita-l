When Shankara Himself interprets the "Atman" in the shruti as the
"viGYAtA" and says that the "tvam" in the statement "tat tvam asi" ought
to be interpreted in this way ONLY, your interpretations (no matter how
much "deep thought" you put into them) cannot possibly be correct since
they contradict Shruti and Shankara.

Of course, GauDapAda said, "That which is supported by *both* shruti and
reason," meaning that if it contradicts either, it cannot be correct.

And Shankara uses nothing but shruti and reason in His Teachings.

Yes. The Knower is ALWAYS independent of the known. The "known object" on
the other hand, cannot exist without the Knower. Welcome to the first
class in Advaita Vedanta.

True, but logic with the aid of the shruti can -- and does!

You are wrong.

The GYAnI wouldn't care to make such statements about himself. The
mahAvAkyas are for aid in nididhyAsana by sAdhakas of the highest order.

I was going to say exactly the same thing :-)
