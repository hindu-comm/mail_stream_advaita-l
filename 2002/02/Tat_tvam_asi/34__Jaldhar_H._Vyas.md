As you guessed, I'm going to answer the Self. :-)

Again you answer for me :-)  The atma is svayamprakash.

Right which is why I do not say it is the buddhi per se.  But ask yourself
what is involved in the process of negation?  To understand the difference
between two things must have some idea no matter how tentative of the
lakshanas of the two things.  The negation of non-being cannot happen
unless one has an idea of being.  Where did that idea come from?

Knowledge from the shastras is really just a different case of the above.
Whether one is reading or hearing or thinking or seeing or feeling it all
boils down to a mental effort.  Why are those mental efforts meaningful to
us?

If the shastras just recorded that which is known through other means such
as perception or reasoning they would be superfluous.  They are a valid
pramana precisely because they are not dependant on any persons state of
being.  They are relevant here because it is the shastras that introduce
the idea of the atma being svayamprakash which you have taken as a given.

Yes.  In order to do that there has to be knowledge of what is beyond
buddhi.  To negate "this" one has to be aware of the difference between
"this" and "that."  That's why another mahavakya says "You are that."

You just did!

Yes but such surrender by itself cannot be enough.  There also has to be a
positive cognition of identity.  And that knowledge might not be of an
object in the conventional sense but it is a thing that can be known.  It
just cannot be pinned down to names and forms like a normal object.
Shankaracharya points out that immediately after the "not this, not this"
text, the upanishad makes such a positive statement of identity "It is
called the truth of truth."  If one were supposed to stop at
unknowability, that statement is completely pointless.

If you are not sure you existed before sleep and after sleep, how can you
assume "you" were the enjoyer of that deep sleep?
