Let us finish the quote "...in the matters for which reason is relevant."
Knowledge of Brahman is not the same as knowledge of heat and cold.  How
can perception be a valid guide when it is the nature of perception itself
which is under suspicion?

Also let me point out again that hearing or reading the Shruti is just as
much "experience" as anything else.

This is how it is done by many people nowadays but it exactly backwards
from the way of life envisioned by our sages.  One should start from the
shastras, take them as far as they can go and then learn the inner meaning
when you can't go further.  This is why the teaching of the upanishads is
called Vedanta--the "end" or culmination of the Vedas.  Dharma provides a
total way of life from marriage to profession to which way you should
arrange your bedroom furniture[1]. It is as one progresses that one
gradually learns to give up the worldly aspects of life (including the
worldly aspects of Dharma.)

I agree with that but it just goes to show that all the pramanas work
together.  One cannot use one in the sphere of another or say one is
paramount over the others.  Each shows a different aspect of the truth.
Brahman is something which is known only from the shastras.  The other
pramanas may provide some side information about it but they cannot say
anything authoritative about it.

By the very fact that you are using the words Atman and Brahman instead of
icebucket or fire engine it shows that you have a preconception.  A word
is not just random passage of air through the vocal cords, it carries a
meaning.  And that meaning doesn't come unbidden on a whim, it is learned
somehow.

I agree that such people are doing something wrong but would again like to
point that others who come to know Brahman through study are living no
less of an integral experience.
