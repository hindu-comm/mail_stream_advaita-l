I was going to write about some of these issues in my posts on mind and
the intellect but as that thread has digressed in many interesting ways I
might as well respond here.

Let us take a look at that sentance neti neti.  The context in which it
appears is brhadaranyakopanishad 2.3.6.  In that adhyaya the two forms of
Brahman are spoken of--the manifest (murta) and the unmanifest (amurta).
They are described first as existing in the universe, and secondly as
existing in the individual.  How is the unmanifest Brahman manifest in a
person?  As truth which is revealed in various ways.  like dye on a cloth
(as mental impressions caused by sensory perception), like faded wool (as
memories picked up over time), like a firefly (intrinsic), like a flame
(as the result of dialectic), like a lotus (as a pure thought), or like a
flash of lightning (as a sudden burst of intuition).  He who knows the
nature of truth shines like lightning.  That person is capable of learning
the nature of Brahman.  The teaching is neti neti.  Brahmans name is the
truth of truth. Prana is truth and Brahman is the truth of that.

neti neti breaks down to na iti, na iti.  na~n in Sanskrit is a nipata
(particle) signifying negation. iti is also a nipata and is used to mark
the end of a speech or a quotation.  For instance if I was writing a
letter in sanskrit I would end it: iti jaladharena likhitam.  "Thus written
by Jaldhar."  It should be noted that there is no word "this" occurring in
the phrase.  A literal translation would be "not," "not".  The "this" is
supplied by the context.  According to Shankaracharya it is the dual
superimposition of the universe and the self on Brahman explained
earlier in the adhyaya which is being negated.  To say Brahman is like the
sun or the moon or wool or lightening is only to be understood as
metaphor.  The Vedantic method is to say it is like the sun but not this,
it is like lightning but is not this...etc.

Does this mean references to Brahman being the Self are also metaphor?
This is one of the most common misreadings of neti neti and Advaita
philosophy in general.  By this reading, Advaita Vedanta is at best a kind
of agnosticism.  There may be a supreme truth but we can never know it or
describe it.  Shankaracharya anticipates this and most emphatically denies
it.  First of all in the various descriptions of how the unmanifest Brahman is
indicated in the body, by body is meant the subtle body made of prana.
Brahman is revealed as impressions (vasanas) on that prana through mental
activity just as it is possible to perceive an object directly by its'
shadow.  And that is called truth but it is not Brahman anymore than a
shadow is the object itself.  Brahman is the "truth of truth" that
underlying substratum which makes it possible to call something true.  In
the same way the prana is truth but not the truth of truth.  So the whole
purpose of neti neti is to say don't confuse the subtle and gross bodies
with the "self" or atman.  Do not confuse names and forms with their
underlying reality for they cannot accurately convey the nature of that
reality.  But they can indirectly point to that reality so Brahman can be
known just not by conventional means.

So to get to back to your original question, negation is a path it is not
the goal and at the end of the path there is not void but the supreme
divine Self.  The nature of that self is known from other shastras.
Negation does not alter that.

You are right but logic is only as good as the data it is applied upon.
But because of ignorance the very data we are working on is not properly
understood so false premises lead to false conclusions.  Ignorance is not
an integral part of us.  Really it doesn't exit at all but we like to
think it does.

The problem is the frame of reference is changing.  It makes the idea of
the consciousness that "we" know to be problematic.  Earlier I gave the
example of my daughter who pulls her hair and cries because she doesn't
realize it is her own hand which is pulling.  Obviously her idea of "self"
and "consciousness" is different to yours?  How do you know that the
consciousness you know is the same as a jnanis?

But do these people forget they are themselves?  From that moment on they
have a continuous recollection that they are a particular person even if
that is not the same person they were before they lost their memory.  In
no case do we hear of someone thinking they were Nanda one minue and
Jaldhar the next minute and Ravi the third minute...

Loss of specific items of memory should be distinguished from loss of the
faculty of memory.  Consciousness is not memory it's true but it manifests
itself through memory (as explained in the upanishad.) Having a memory is
a hallmark of being conscious.

We know only through indirect means.  But when it known that there was
consciousness before the deep sleep and the same consciousness is there
afterwards, what is the justification for _not_ accepting there was the
same consciousness in between?

See above.

That's fine.  The individual identity is a product of ahamakara not the
atman.

But you can aslo have dreams where you are not associated with a body.  I
know I do.  It might not be as common but it is possible.

Hari Om !! Jaladhar.

Thank you for responding to my queries. I took some
time to consolidate my understanding. Your answers
have been truly helpful to me.

Can I understand that "Individual Self" and "Supreme
Self" are the same "Self" from different relative view
points of Vyasti and Samasti ?

Can I understand as follows:

Atma in Vyasti is Jivatma.
Jivatma + Bodies = Jiva

(Sorry, if I am repeating the same question. I just
want to be sure of the correct import, so I do not
understand when I see these words again)

An additional question:

Is Kutastha-Atman same as "Jivatman" (as referred
above) ?

Would  you please explain this .  Who is that 'One'
who can be un-embodied and have ego ?

Till now, I have been interpreting that the "Subtle
Body" (which does not include SELF) goes through
transmigration. As we say that Consciousness is all
pervading, whatever body + mind complex is there
"Self" will reflect in it, then how can we say that
"Jiva" will undergo transmigration ? If the above
statement is true, how can we attribute "WILL" to
reincarnate to the insentient "Subtle Body" ?

Can we say that because MIND is Maya, suppression of
Ahamkara means separating the EGO from SELF (Jivatma).

And 'Suppression of Ahamkara' is another word to 'Lift
the Veil of Maya'
