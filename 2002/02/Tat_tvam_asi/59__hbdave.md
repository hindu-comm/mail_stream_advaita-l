Except in the special case of aatmaa, where knower, known and knowledge merge
into
One.

I think Nanda is right - when Upanishads say that Atman is the "knower" it is in
a very special sense only. In  the quoted :

viGYAteryastu viGYAtA sa tvamityuchyate yataH .
sa syadanubhavastasya tato.anyo.anubhavo mR^ishhaa .. (2.12.8)

vi in front of ~njaataa denote a special type of Knower.
