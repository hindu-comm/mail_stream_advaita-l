Ravi, I wanted to write to you earlier with the exact references, but have
been travelling and hence do not have references at hand. But this I can
tell you : there are two such references that the removal of avidhya is
effected only by divine grace. One is in Shankara's commentary on the Brahma
Sutras and the other is in his commentary on the Katha Upanishad.

Maybe others can help here?
