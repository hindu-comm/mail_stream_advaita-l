Whether it "adds" experience or not, the mere fact that it is the knower is
established only because that it knew something. Would one which knows
nothing be a knower? So a knowers position would be established only in
opposition to the known. It is on this understanding it is said : "it is I
who experienced the past and the same I who experience the present" (see
Shankara's dialectic against the kshanikavaada of the Bauddhas). Here to
establish the "I", you need the things that the "I" experienced - so knower
implicitly means the known and a past known would imply the usage of memory.
