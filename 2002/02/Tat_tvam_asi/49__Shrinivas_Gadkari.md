Namaste Shri shrikrishna,

Yes, I too feel Sri Himanshu is a learned person. Interaction
with learned people, even on basic teachings is a fruitful
exercise. Is this not one of the purpose of such lists ?

Let us look at this again:

You say, there is the Self and thoughts. Mind and
thoughts are synonymous, I am OK with that. It is just
a matter of name.

But, no prakRti is not clear. For, who then would manage
the thoughts ? Say I witness the thought of myself touching a hot stove.
This needs to be followed by I witnessing a thought
where in my body in pain. Whatever be the process by
which this ordering of thoughts is managed, let us call it
prakRti.

Say I remember witnessing a thought wherein, I kept a book
on the table. When I look for it, I do witness a thought
where in the book is on the table ? Who handles the details
of the image of the book ? Let us call this entity prakRti.

Best regards
Shrinivas Gadkari
