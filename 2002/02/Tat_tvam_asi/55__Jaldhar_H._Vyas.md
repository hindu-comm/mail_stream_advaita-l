I'm mixing two of your posts for brevity.

This is true but as stated somewhat misleading.  "pramanas" don't produce
"knowledge" specific pramanas produce specific knowledge.  No matter how
much you look through the Hubble Space Telescope you will not find out
anything about how the stock market is going to perform tomorrow.

So the question is what s the pramana which gives us knowledge (no matter
how fitful) about Brahman?  The Vedantic answer is the shabda pramana or
Vedic tradition.

That is not a problem because Shruti is apaurusheya (not man-made) and
passed down from the Rshis through an unbroken chain of teachers.

And note the problem you describe is common to all pramanas.  How do you
know you are interpreting your experiences right?  The human capacity for
wishful thinking is amply documented.  How do you know your logic is not
based on false premises?

Science gets around this with certain ideas like verifiability but Science
also restricts itself to only certain subjects and would not entertain
this one at all.

..and for the suitably prepared person, that's exactly what it does.

Isn't that enough for a pramana?

And any other pramana is not?

Advaita Vedanta also holds experience and logic to be in the realm of
avidya for exactly the same reasons.

We are not really in disagreement.  I'll grant you that knowledge of
Brahman is relative etc.  The point is quite simple.  Of all the possible
a priori and partial knowledge available it is that provided by Shruti
which best describe Brahman and thus is the proximate cause of liberation.
You have done nothing to show that experience or logic would be any more
helpful in this task.
