Dear Kenji,

surely, by such events, one  learns to associate as
well as dissociate oneself with this material
world.How can we indeed dispute the very things that
manifest in front of our eyes and which create
impressions in our minds(loosely used term 'mind'by
me)?------Shall respond  more on seeing your further
posts on the same by you .

If Gaudapada, a great Acharya,has used the terms
Chitta and Manas seperately in his renderings in
Sanskrit language,there has to be a subtle difference
in the expression of the two terms and that is what ,
in my opinion , is to be understood in order to imbibe
the teachings of the great Acharya.

Thank you for your posting of the relevent verses from
Chapter 14 of Tripura rahasya. Indeed they are
enlightening and will be useful in understanding the
nuances of the 'mind'.Shall write more after trying to
digest what you have sent so far.

Hari Om!
Swaminarayan
