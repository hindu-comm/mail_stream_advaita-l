Yes this is a good way of looking at it.

Yes.

kutasthaatman is a synonym for paramatman.

Please see my reply to Chandrashekharan from a couple of days ago. I was
wrong in my use of the word unembodied.  I meant the ego can exist without
a physical body.  But of course the subtle body is still a body.

The problem is not that the mind is maya but that it is misinterpreting
its input to the extent that it imagines itself to be a seperate entity.
The byproduct of that misapprehension is ahamkara.

If it were not possible for a thing of maya to overcome that
misinterpretation then moksha would be impossible because ultimately even
Vedas, Gurus and Devatas are maya.

It helps but there must also be the positive conviction, perhaps shaky at
first but growing steadier that "I am Brahman."  If lack of ego alone
were enough, infants, beggars, the insane etc. could be considered
liberated.  The two aspects of sadhana, negation of what is unreal and
knowlege of what is real must go together.
