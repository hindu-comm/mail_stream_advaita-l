I understand, the correct meaning of Kutastha is Anvil
which the gold-smith uses to keep the metal and beat
with hammer to give some shape. The metal gets changed
in shape but the Anvil on which the metal is kept to
beat does not change (remains unaffected). Similarly
the Atman (Jivatma) remains unattached and untainted,
or unaffected, so it is called Kutastha-Atman.

Om Namo Narayanaya !!
