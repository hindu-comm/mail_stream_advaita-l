kutastha = lika mountain (i.e. highest) or all-pervading.

Really it doesn't but it believes that it reincarnates.  It is its'
unfilled desires which make it do so.  As long as the jiva is ignorant of
its true eternal self it is carried along by its false identification with
that ahamkara.

I keep going back to the example of a baby because that is the most vivid
in my mind at the moment. Now one thing my daughter is doing is kicking
out constantly and waving her arms and staring at her fingers.  In a way
she is doing sadhana!  She is wondering "How big is Shailaja.  Where does
she end and the outside world begin?"  I do not think you can say she has
a much of a sense of I or self yet but it is developing in the light of
her new experiences.
