On careful reading, I understand, Kutastha is referred
to Paramatman and not Jivatman. (as you mentioned).

But I am wondering what is the significance of using
the word for 'Brahman' with reference to 'Isvara', and
the word 'Kutastha'  with reference to 'Jiva', when
they both refer to the same 'thing'.

Kindly give your comments.

Om Namo Narayanaya !!
