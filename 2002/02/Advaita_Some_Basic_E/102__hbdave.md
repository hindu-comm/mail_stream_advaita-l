Yes, the shloka could be interpreted like that.
But, though I would be happy to say yes and claim support from Shri Krishna
himself,
traditionally meaning of that shloka from Geeta is given differently.

If you are interested, I can discuss the two implied meanings of the shloka in
a separate
mail. They depend upon interpretation of the words "night" ( nishaa, raatri)
and
"awake " (jagarti). The meanings are quite deep.

I am happy to know that.

Again, meaning of the technical word "yoga-nidraa" is slightly different. Just
as
in  deep sleep you are without duality, "a mass of consciousness" as Mandukya
says, without wants, worries, etc.  in Nirvikalpa Samadhi also you are in
similar non-dual state. Then why not call it nidraa? It is called yoganidraa
because there is a big difference - in N. Samadhi you are "aware" of BEING.
You ARE there.
Actually what happes to  a long time meditator is this : he/she develops a
continuous background awareness which is totally detached - kind of reflection

of the Turiya. This awareness forms a significant part of his/her being, just
as
for a person with, say, a joint pain the pain becomes a continuous background
in his being. This awareness remains even in the sleep!

Actually, for a Yogi both the meanings will merge into one, is not it?
