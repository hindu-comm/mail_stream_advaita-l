HBD : The original word is  "srutam  (heard) - but it means knowledge
gained from
shruti (Vedas), i.e. verbal expressions of spiritual experiences of
Aptajana.
Normally learning is to be understood by integrating it with knowledge
already
acquired.  Ordinary, day-to-day knowledge gets integrated at
Vij~naanamaya
kosha level. Contents of  shruti would be integrated at Anandamaya
level.
In short it is jiiva who understands.

waking --> during meditative state,
non-waking --> during other,  routine, day-to-day, what we normally call

                               "waking" state;
my understanding of who is real "I" and non-dual nature of brahman be
present during both these states;

.rtam  - the Law or Truth as "is" (which is defined in shruti but not
accessible
                to unprepared mind);
satyam - the Truth as understood in vyavahara, working truth, can be
understood
                by a human mind;

HBD :me - jiiva
Speaker - though the physical speech you are going to hear comes
               from my tongue, driven by my mind, the Speaker is really
                b.rhaspati, the origin of vaak("speech") at Anandmaya,
                which is driven by shruti, so original Speaker is
combination
                of all the Vedic seers;

Just as a judge in a High Court, before pronouncing a judgement
anounces his authority and the laws on which his judgement is
based, here the speaker (me) says : "whatever I am saying comes
from an unending linage of seers."

HBD : Yes, mostly correct.

HBD : No.  brahmavid simply means one who "knows" brahman.
            He may have flitting awareness of oneness.

            Paramhamsa  = parama + hamsa = highest, most excellent hamsa

who is hamsa ?  One who has a continous awareness of being one with
brahman,  sa.h aham tena hamsa.h

so paramahamsa - a person who has non-stop, continuous, oneness with
brahman.
The difference between the two is whether the person, in all his action
and
all the time, gives evidence of the oneness.

- vara (better, higher)
- vare.nya (best, highest)
- vari.s.tha (best, highest)
are just comparatives and superlatives.

Jada, Bala, etc. on the other hand, denote not the relative grading
but behavioural characteristics exhibited by a paramhamsa in our
vyavahaarika world. For example,
Jada - looks dull, stupid, sluggish;
Bala - behaves like a child.

I do not think there is any relationship between the two ideas.

HBD : As a first step it is OK to arrive at the jiiva, but please
          note that the first stage is to find out, i.e. to understand,
          that the enquiry has to continue.

HBD :
Yes, agreed. Atman is not "found" by meditation (alone).
Please note that meditation is a lind of "laboratory work"
on path of spirituality. Vidyaranya swami says that though
the Light seen during meditation is not exactly that of
Atman, the error is not serious as it is Light from
chidaabhaasa. He compares with a man searching  for a jewel
in a cave, being guided by a light, which he thinks, is coming from
the jewel.

> Is this understanding correct ?

HBD : Yes, only I would use "jiiva" instead of "jivatman".

> talking about three 'entities' ?

HBD :
            EGO = "I am"
There are no three entities. In final analysis there is only one, Atman,

but I think you are asking about the meditative state.

Now, meditation is not a homogeneous experience. There are periods when
"I-sense" is present and periods when it is lost. (In RigVeda this is
called
drapsa.h - drops (of  rain, honey or somaa). Jiiva is ( as explained in
a
later posting) name given to chidaabhaasa (reflection of Atman on brain
activity), plus kutastha (Atman); or Atman which falsely believes itself

born and having various characteristcs.
When "I-sense" is lost in a meditation, that is you aanandamaya, or
chidaabhaasa.

HBD :
May be by definition, but not by conviction! Please read the story
of  the lion-cub brought up in a flock of sheeps. Bt definition a
lion-cub is a lion, but he did not know that he is a lion.

This is called praapyasya praapti (obtaining something which
you already have).
Please note that realization does not mean being able to talk about
brahman. Not only you have to understand, but must have
ni.s.thaa (firm conviction), that understanding should pervade your
whole self.

You see, everyone should realy know who he/she is, but strangely,
it is the most difficultthing to know.

A soldier should not only have a sword, not only know how to use
it, where to use it, but have the confidence to use it, the sword should

be part of himself.

HBD :
I think there is some confusion because you are mixing up terms used
in visishtaadvaita and advaita. As per my use ( and also most Advaita
texts)

jiiva = Soul; which is subject to birth/death, has characteristics,
feels he/she
            is limited, etc. equals chidaabhaasa plus Kutastha;

Atman = (Kutastha) - Self, unchanging, without birth/death, basis for
the
            illusion of jiiva, same as brahman, though it seems
constrained as
            jiiva;
brahman = all pervading, Ultimate Reality.

Please note that this distinction is from our view-point, i.e. from
duality
position and is only for the purpose of explanation.

Though it is easy enough to see that I am jiiva (and not body/mind), one

can with some difficulty realize Atman (Kutastha) as the basis. But it
is
even more difficult to realize Atman <---> brahman.

HBD :
Not exactly.
I propose that Maya is very nature of brahman, it is its Shakti,
in Pura.nika terms - its "consort". But please let me explain it
in my regular posting.

HBD :
I would rather put it as conviction of a person from "that" plane.
It would be a mere theory if it were just ideas floated without proper
prama.na.

Ajaatavaada is the final stop indicated by that famous shloka from
Gaudapada's Karika (II-32) :
na nirodho na cotpattirna boddho na ca saadhaka.h |
na mumuk.surna vai mukta itye.saa paramaarthataa ||

{there is no dissolution of mind, there is no birth, there is no one
bound, no one is a seeker, no one needs release, no one is released,
that is the highest Truth.}

In Kathopanishat, the path of spirituality is compared to a edge of
a sword. You can not remain standing on a sword, you have to go
on moving, walking. Advaita taken to its conclusion, if you go
on walking, you reach ajaatavaada.

HBD :
Individual Self = jiiva?
saak.si is unchanging, unborn. jiiva is subject to birth/death, etc.
In deep meditation the awarer is the chidaabhaasa (aanandamaya)
Awareness of time is gone. Saak.si means a witness - a detached,
independent, witness.
Jiiva, which is chidaabhaasa plus Kutastha, can not be a saak.si because
of its
attachments.
Kutastha or Atman is the "awarer" part of the jiiva - it is aware of
itself -
but aware itself as everything. If you are trying to see Atman through
meditation, you are looking thro' the wrong end of the telescope!
Atman "sees" the meditation, not the other way round.

Because chidaabhaasa is part of sharira (destructible) it can not be the

saak.si.

HBD :
Mundaka Up. (two birds) : the number two is by the way of description.
If you read the mantra  [Mundaka 3-1-1, Svet. Up. 4-6, RigVeda I-164-29]

dvaa     supar.naa    sayujaa                    sakhaayaa ... ...
 (two)  (birds)        (well connected)    (friendly)
                                   (firmly-joined)

The critical word here is  sayujaa - closely related, joined firmly.
If a special relationship was NOT meant, then only sakhaayaa would have
been sufficient.

Do not get confused by the language used for explanations. We talk in
terms
of different entities like jiiva, Atman, etc. all of them are but
aspects of One
only.

Aitareya Up. [I-3-12]
sa etameva siimaana.m vidaaryaitayaa dvaaraa praapadyata ...

Brahman entered in form of jiiva via brahmarandhra, i.e.
same as aanandamaya kosha.

You are doing fine. Your Q's are good. The seeming confusion
itself is part of enquiry. My only suggestion is - stick to one
system of thought at a time.
