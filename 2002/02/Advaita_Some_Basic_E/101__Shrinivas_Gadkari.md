Namaste Shri Himanshu,

This then is what Shri Krishna refers to in 2.69 Gita:
"That which is night for beings, in it a samayami is awake"

Shri Sai Baba of Shirdi used to say something similar (in the
episode related to sleeping on a narrow wooden plank).

Is this what is called yoga-nidra ?

Thanks.

Best regards
Shrinivas
