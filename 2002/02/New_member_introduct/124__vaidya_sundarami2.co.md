My apologies for this delayed action on this; I was tied up at work.
Thanks,
Vaidya.

Re: Welcome and Request for more info.
Namaste:

I would like to subscribe to the Advaita list. I have
been in the USA for around 10 years. I teach at the
art institute of Philadelphia in the multimedia and
web department.

I am originally from Cuttack, Orissa. My family are
very religious minded people and we often go to the
Puri Temple. We are vegetarians. Finally, I would like
to add that I am interested to learn more about our
philosophy and culture.

With regards,

Rupananda Misra
