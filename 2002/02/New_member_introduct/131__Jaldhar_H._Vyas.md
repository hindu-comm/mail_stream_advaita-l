OM Hari.

Dear Friends,

Sri Prasad Balasubramanian had written to me, inviting
me to be a member of your list (copy is below). As
manner of introduction, here is some biodata from my
website:
http://swamij.com/swamijnaneshvara.htm

The main address of the website is:
http://swamij.com/index.htm

Sri Balasubramanian wrote that your list is one of
scholars of Sanskrit and Advaita, neither one of which
is true of this person. If the perspectives of a
non-scholar who is treading the path are of use, those
you may freely have.

With respect for all the lovers of Advaita Vedanta,

Swami Jnaneshvara
