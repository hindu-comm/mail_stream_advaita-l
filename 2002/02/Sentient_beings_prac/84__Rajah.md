Namaste dear Friends,

It will be much appreciated if someone (anyone!) on this
list would care to provide references showing what it is
we practise with regard to sentient beings - i.e. our respect
for all created life. In simple terms, how we view cruelty to
"animals", how we relate to life, how (and if) we respect it
as we do each other.

Thank you kindly

With esteem

Raga
