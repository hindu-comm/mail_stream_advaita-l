Very true. Yes, inferential reasoning by analyzing the three states of
waking, dream and deep sleep can atbest point to something which survives
these three states without any change to itself and thus facilitates the
continuity of our identity. But whether this thing can be relevant to
salvation - as the end to human suffering, escape from the cycle of
rebirths, immortality, the end and goal of life and ultimate happiness - is
to be learnt from the shruti alone.
