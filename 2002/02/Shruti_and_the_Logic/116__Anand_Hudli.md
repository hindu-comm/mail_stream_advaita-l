SureshvarAchArya, in his naiShkarmya-siddhi, has dealt with a topic that
is relevant here. Please see 3-57 and 3-58 for a discussion on how
anumAna (inference or reasoning in general) cannot give us a direct
realization of the Self. Here Sureshvara is replying to an objection by
an opponent who says that the Self which is supposed to be understood
from the vAkya of the shruti (such as tattvamasi, ahaM brahmAsmi) can be
attained by anumAna alone and hence, the vAkya is rendered irrelevant or
without any content (ie. dispensable)  - " tadA vAkyAvagamyasyArthasya
anuditAnastamitaviGYAnamAtrasvabhAsya anumAnenaiva pratipannatvAt.h
punarapi vAkyasya nirviShayatvaprasaN^gaH". Sureshvara essentially argues
that direct realization of the Self is only through the vAkya, not by
anumAna.
