In the logic of advaitins there are six means of valid knowledge
(pramANa). 1. pratyaksha (perception), 2. anumAna (inference)
3. Agama (scripture) 4. upamAna (analogy) 5. arthApatti (accepting
a conclusion in order avoid absurdity) 6. anupalabdhi (non-
occurrence as a proof of non-existence).

In advaita prakaraNa the fourth pramANa upamAna is being used.

Sarma.
