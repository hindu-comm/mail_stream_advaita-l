 The point is that some commitment has to be there from the student even
 if other qualifications are present. In olden times, the commitment
 was made clear by the student, even if he had the adhikAri-laxaNa,
 by performing the sevA of the Guru.
 The student was expected to serve the Guru, often for a long period
 of time, before the Guru would impart some knowledge.
 Nowadays, no one seems to have the time to do such sevA on a day to
 day basis. So the commitment from the student has to be expressed in
 some other way. And this other way is usually donation (money), though
 it could also be some kind of volunteer work, etc.

 The general principle seems to be that what you gain should be earned.
 Otherwise, it will be wasted. If you listen to lecture upon lecture
 from a Guru with no commitment, then such lectures will not, in general,
 do you any good, even if such lectures are about the highest reality.
