It has very little or nothing to do with money. There is a determiner
called "adhikAri laxaNam" -- that should be met. Many requirements go into
this term, just to mention two: a) Need/urge to know b) Qualifications/pre-
requisites needed.


 - Once a rich man came shirdi baba and laid down hundreds of rupees and
asked him for upadesha - Baba refused pointing out that he did not have
background know about the ultimate truth.

- We all have spent hundreds of rupees buying books -- they all simply
adorn the shelf.

- Even if you sell a mahavaakya for million dollars, the buyer would not
gain a thing out of it -- if he does not have the adhikAri laxaNam. For the
one who has the adhikAri laxaNam - listening to it just once should be
suffice.
