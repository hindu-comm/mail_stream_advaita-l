Point 1. We can and must distinguish between the mind and the intellect. The
taittirIya upanishad distinguishes between manomaya and vijnAnamaya sheaths.
The kaTha upanishad and the gItA both distinguish between manas (mind) and
dhI or buddhi (intellect).

Actually, one can, in the state of the highest samAdhi, in which the
intellect is made so clear and pure that it is fit to reflect the light of
the Self. Of course, this state is not that of the Self-in-itself, but as
seen through the intellect, but the fact remains that the Self can be known.
In fact, if one analyzes this a little more in detail, the Self is known in
every cognition, for without the Self, there can be no cognition at all.

Agreed that liberation is not intellectually knowing the
consciousness-in-itself, but there is no "trying to be" either. Liberation
is simply "being". No trying involved at that level.

I would suggest that Sankaracharya's commentary on gItA 13.24 be taken as
the guiding principle in such discussions. There are various ways to the
vision of the Self, all of which culminate in jnAna.

On this note, I will try to restart my translation series of the gItA
commentary in a few days. Old-timers on the list may remember that I had
started it way back in 1998, but did not continue the pace, for various
reasons. As there are many new members on the list now, and also to maintain
continuity of expression, I will start all over again, perhaps once a week.
