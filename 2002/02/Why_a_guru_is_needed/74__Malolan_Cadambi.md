I fully agree with Sri.Rama Balasubramanian's post and your post.

The main Dharma Sastras (Harita Smriti, Manu Smriti, Gautama Dharama Sastras
etc etc) were written  considering the then prevalent socio-economic factors
and not considering the present day factors. The question now naturally
arises, how are the Dharama Sastras relevant today? Enter mahagurus like
Kanchi Swami, Sringeri Sankaracharya and respective gurus of various
denominations and sects. The play a pivotal role in re-interpreting the
Dharma Sastras and preserving and propogating timeless truths to the present
generation. Hence the need of a Guru and Elder's advice.
