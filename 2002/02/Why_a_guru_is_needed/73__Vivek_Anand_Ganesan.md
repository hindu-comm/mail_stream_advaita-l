I fully agree with you on the need to have a guru. But, I
have the same question regarding the relative importance
given to the male child over the female child. Is it
because
of the commonly held assumption about needing a son to
perform funeral rites or is there a deeper reason? I
wouldn't quite call this male preference misogynism (
patriarchy sounds more like it ) because women are
honored and celebrated as goddesses and as lakshmi (wealth)
of the house etc.

  On the other hand, the preference for boys and several
socio-economic factors such as dowry has made the girl
child highly undesirable. Female infanticide and gender
-selective abortion has reduced the male-female ratio to
dangerous lows in parts of India. Needless to say, this is
a
serious problem. H.H. kAnchi swamiji has
spoken out against this practice.

-Vivek.
