According to Ramana, the Buddhists misinterpreted Buddha's silence.

>From "Talks", Talk no. 273, 23 October, 1936:

D: Buddha, when asked if there is the ego, was silent; when asked if there
is no ego, he was silent; asked if there is God, he was silent; asked if
there is no God, he was silent. Silence was his answer to all these.
Mahayana and Hinayana schools have both misinterpreted his silence because
they say that he was an atheist...His interpreters are wrong. Is it not
so?

M: You are right.
