Sri Dave's postings made interesting reading. He seems to me to be a man of some Knowledge. Sankara, if he is right is to be considered spiritually inferior to Sri Ramana and Sri Ramkrishna. I would be interested in knowing what the others feel about this.
                   with best regards,
                             Hemant
