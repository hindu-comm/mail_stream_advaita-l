I do not know how did I gave this impression!
There is no olympics of Realization where someone comes First,
someone second, etc.
Each has his/her own approach and achievements. We should
not compare or judge these Vibhutis.
I shall be the last person to do that, that much at least I know.

If Shri Hemant points out the portion/s from my postings which
conveys such impression, I would like to at least rephrase  or even
withdraw them.

With best wishes to all,
