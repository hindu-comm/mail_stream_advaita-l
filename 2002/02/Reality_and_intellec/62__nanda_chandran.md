But isn't vijnaana consciousness rather than the intellect?

Manas in the traditional sense is identified with desires rather than
intellection.

I used the "mind" in the sense it is used in modern language.

This is the classical Patanjala Yoga view - but isn't there some dispute on
this issue raised by Shankara?

If the Self "sees" itself in the pure mind, it'll be the normal working of
knowledge involving the knower and known - which will contradict Upanishadic
statements like "who will know the knower" and "the self is not to be known
as an object" etc

"Seeing" the Self in the mind is not to be interpreted literally. The Self
is pure consciousness and doesn't "see" itself in the pure mind. If the mind
becomes pure then individuality is dissolved, then the Self abides in
itself. I think it would good to understand Shankara's dispute with
Patanjali on this issue.

Without the Self there can be no cognition - this is right. But that doesn't
necessarily mean that the Self be known in all cognition. Electricity lights
up a bulb, but does that mean you see electricity everytime the bulb lights
up?

If the knower knows himself in the normal sense it'll involve the common
working of knowledge then the subject will need another subject to know -
this is logically wrong which is why Yaagnavalkya says "by whom will the
knower be known"?
