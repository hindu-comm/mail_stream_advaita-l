I would be little careful.  Karma is in the hands of  human  not
karma phala.  Karmaphala daata is Iswara and phala follows His rules
and regulations that human has no control. In the final analysis
everything comes under adR^ishhTa . Grace is only a graceful way of
saying that one has no control on.  What one has control is action -
karmani eva adhikaaraste maa phaleshuu kadaachana.

In the final analysis there are no disagreement only the perspective.
