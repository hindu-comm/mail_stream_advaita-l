I have already ordered the John Grimes's dictionary, this should help quite
a lot.
Any way it was absolutly not my intention to ask to the members of the list
to avoid using Sanskrit.
I really understand the importance of the original lanquage specially for
indian philosophyes.
I am aware of the fact that the original "sound/word" will be one with the
meaning.
I will follow your suggestions and before mastering Sanskrit I will say a
lot of "hey, what does that mean".

An intresting point is coming out from this exchange: what is the relation
between a word and and it's form in the reality - body and mind (
antahkarana ).

Name and form........the Sphota and it's manifestation...........

There is a relation between those concepts and the great importance given
to the original Sanskrit language in the process of learnig Vedanta ?


ps

By the way "hey what's the meaning of sampradaya"..........:-))  :-))  :-))
