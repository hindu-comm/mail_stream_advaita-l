Dear Riccardonova,

"By the way "hey what's the meaning of sampradaya"..........:-))  :-))  :-))"

"Sampradaya" means "tradition that comes from an acharya through disciplic
succession".

"An intresting point is coming out from this exchange: what is the relation
between a word and and it's form in the reality - body and mind (
antahkarana )."

If you are having "mantra" in mind , then "mantra" or the original word as
revealed through "shrutis" is one in which the meaning and sound correspond.

Regards,
Venkataramani K.
