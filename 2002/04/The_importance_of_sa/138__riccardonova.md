Sorry but I do not understand what "Smarta" means, is a specific group of
people ? Are you a Smarta by birth ? Some time , being an european makes it
difficolt to follow the list discussions, does any body knows if a Vedanta
dictionary is available, is it possible to buy it online ? I think it would
be really necessary for people like me that get in contact with this
philosophy by far away, unfortunatly I don't know sanskrit and all my
previous education was in a totally different orientation. Any suggestions
would be very wellcome.
