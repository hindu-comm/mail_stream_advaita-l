This is another one of those words that can have different meanings in
different contexts.  Yes, in the broadest sense, a Smarta is a follower of
Smrtis.  Such a definition would include all astikas even Vaishnavas
Shaivas etc.

A more typical usage is to describe the sampradaya of which Shankaracharya
is the most famous exponent (but not the founder.)  In many cases it
involves a formal affiliation with a math but it can include all those who
share his approach to tradition.

The third usage is to describe certain Brahman castes of Southern India
(Iyers.)

I meant the latter two definitions--those people who have a formal
allegience whether by birth or disciplehood to the smarta ideals.
