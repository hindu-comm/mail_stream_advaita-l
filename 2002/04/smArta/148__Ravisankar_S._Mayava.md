Re: Welcome and Request for more info.

Jerry Allen is a long-time spiritual seeker not associated with any
particular tradition or organization. For many years the reading and
activities have centered around Buddhism, Zen in particular. Lately the
quest seems to point toward advaita vedanta, which, as is usually the
case,
was stumbled upon.

Serious discussion is most important, which led to your list. There is
likely to be considerably more reading than contributing from this side.

Thank you.
