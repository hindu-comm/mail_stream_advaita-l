To put a stop to this discussion I would like to inform the list
members that Puri Sankaracharya visited Ramanasrama at
Tiruvannamalai and sat at the feet of Ramana to learn the
meaning of the agama passage "haranaarii samyogae avacchaayaa
yogah'. Ramana did not teach him by word but by simply inducing
in the Sankaracharya the experience pertaining to the agama
passage. The Sankaracharya with tears rolling down his cheeks
acknowledged that he now understood.

Those people who are interested in the incident will find it in the
Letters from Ramanasrama by Suri Nagamma.

regards,

Sarma.
