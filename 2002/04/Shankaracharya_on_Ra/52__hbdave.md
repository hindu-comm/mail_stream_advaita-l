The general tone of the article shows what it is, so why give importance to
it? The paragraph about the discussions sessions where "room overflowed"
shows what is in the mind of the writer.

As far as Swami Dayananda, who is mentioned in the article, is concerned,
I doubt very much if he expressed his views the way reported. I can tell from

the answers that he gave (in my presence) for some questions raised by a
sadhaka, that he could not have held the views reported. No traditional
Advaita teacher in his right mind would represent what is attributed to
"a living  Shankaracharya".

I think we should ignore such articles. After so much of ink and paper
is wasted, there are people who still confuse between Knowledge (big K)
and knowledge gained from books.
