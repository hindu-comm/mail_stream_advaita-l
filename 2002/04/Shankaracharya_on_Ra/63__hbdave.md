This is how I understand it :

hara = Shiva = Brahman;    gaurii = Parvati = Maya.
avacchaayaa = concealment, a covering or veil hiding something;
samyoge = [in the ] union;

"[Seeing] concealment in the union of Shiva and Parvati" is  [itself]
Yoga.

This is the major (mukhya) meaning.
Explanation :-
By saying hara and gaurii we are having a dvaitabhaava about the
Brahman,
and further by saying haragaurii samyog.h we talk about their union, as
if
hara and gaurii are different (or separate) and they get into an union.
Seeing concealment of the Reality here (i.e. in saying the union) itself

is Yoga - i.e. my union with the One.

Purport is : hara and gaurii are one, so no question of their union.
Seeing
this clearly is itself Yaga.

This sentence is like a Mahavaakya. It has behind it total Advaita
system.
Compare with

devasya e.sh.h svabhaava.h
{it is the very nature of the Brahman}
[Gaudapadacarya Karika]

In Saiva siddhanta (as far as I know, I am not an expert on Kashmir
Saivism) the experience of Puri Shankaracharya is called anupaaya
pratibhijnaa - an effortless release.

It is not surprising that a well-prepared Jnani like Puri Shankaracharya

had "experience" in benign presence of Shri Ramana.

There is another explanation : [this is minor (gau.na) ]:

The concealment (the illusory world) is due to the union of hara
(brahman) and gaurii (Maya) -- knowing/realizing this is Yoga.

Here we have dvaitabhaava for hara and gaurii.

I hope this leads the readers a thoughtless state :-)
