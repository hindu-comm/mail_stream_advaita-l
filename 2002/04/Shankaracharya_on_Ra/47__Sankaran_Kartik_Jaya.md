I was reading http://www.wie.org/j14/daya.asp
where Andrew Cohen says:

"Even one of the living Shankaracharyas -- the head of one of the four
monastic institutions allegedly established by Advaita's founder,
Shankara -- also denies the validity of Ramana's attainment, apparently
for the simple reason that someone who wasn't formally trained in Vedanta
couldn't possibly be fully enlightened!"

Does anyone know which Shankaracharya denies this about RM?

Thanks,

Kartik
