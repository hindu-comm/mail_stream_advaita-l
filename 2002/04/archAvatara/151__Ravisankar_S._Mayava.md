 The term archAvatara is used primarily in shrIvaiShNava religion. It
is one of the five forms of Lord according to them. You will find more
details on this on the bhakti-list. Probably if you post your question
there they may answer in detail. Briefly, it considers the consecrated
vigraha-s in temples same as the actual avatara of the Lord. That is,
you do not think that it is a stone or bronze image on which you
superimpose or imagine the Lord. But you understand that the Lord is
actually there. You perceive him in the same way as someone who lived
at kRShNas time (such as arjuNa) perceived him.  Such an
understanding, improves the quality and depth of communion in temple
worship.
