[this message is from Vishal Aggarwal <vishalagarwal at hotmail.com> but gave
the list server indigestion for some reason.]

Orissa and some adjacent districts of Bihar and W Bengal also have
followers of the Paippalada Shakha of Atharvaveda. Their Samhita is still
not published completely. Their grhya rites are based on Paithinasi
Grhyasutra and its various Paddhatis. Of the latter, the one by a Krishna
Pandita is in vogue. As all these works are still in manuscript, nothing
much can be said.
