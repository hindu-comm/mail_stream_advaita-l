Thanks for throwing light on this.

I however have a doubt: if say, I'm a man who has done only evil in life.
After my death, say, I attain hell.
Assume that my son performs my Shraadhha religiously. In this case, what's
the fruit of the Shraddha, or what is achieved by performing the Shraddha?

How is this question interpreted in the Shastras or by experts?
