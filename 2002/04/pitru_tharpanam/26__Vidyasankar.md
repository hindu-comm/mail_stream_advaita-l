Check the explanations of rituals associated with the sapiNDIkaraNa on
the 11th and 12th days after a death occurs, and also the annual zrAddha
rituals. I don't have references handy right now. Briefly, what happens
is that the person performing the funerary rituals formally unites the
dead person with the pitRs, and bids adieu to the ancestor from the
fourth preceding generation. After that, in the annual zrAddha, the
vizvedevas belonging to the classes called purUrava and Ardrava, are
invoked, along with the three generations immediately preceding.
