Namaskaaram,

I am the least qualified to talk abotu this. Nevertheless, I think the way
people do it is for three generations ahead of them. The ones prior to
that are assumed to have reached higher abodes, and don't receive the
pinda any more. So if X passes away, the ancestors three generations ahead
of X are assumed to have been released from receiving this, and X's son
performs the tarpanam for X, and his two immediate predecessor
generations.

thanks,
