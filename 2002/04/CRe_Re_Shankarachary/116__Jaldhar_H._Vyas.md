I believe what the Shaivas mean is that the world-appearance is a direct
transformation of Sadashiva not a false superimposition as Advaitins
believe.  A similiar theory of the Bhagavatas (Vaishnavas) is criticized
in the Brahmasutras.

One assumption that Vedanta makes is that samsara is the cause of
suffering.  If one is satisfied with the world as-is what does one need
philosophy for?  It turns out ignorance is rarely bliss.

Replace world with world-appearence and it makes more sense I think.  The
objective of Advaita Vedanta is to know the true nature of the universe
(that it is all Brahman) by rejecting false notions of it.
