dear friends,

that all the visible universe is just one fourth of
His manifestation!

So
the cocept of a blue sky is not real!

Dear Shree Swamy,

All that you have said has to be accepted by any aasthika. The point that you are missing is the very basic question that is being discussed in this thread!

Granting that we are in jagrut avastha,and all that is seen or heard in that avastha by a jiva  dissappears when the jiva gets into  swapna avastha,the intriguing thing is that, when the jiva comes back into the jagrut avastha, the things that existed earlier in the same avastha continue to be there, including all the surroundings  (like blue sky ). But the same is not true in the second time of the Dream avastha.When the jiva goes to dream state ,all that the jiva sees there the second time are all totally different than what was seen by the jiva when it was in  its previous dream avastha!.

Here, we can think about the explanation given by Himanshuji which is very welcome and which has to be granted and thought about further!

Himanshuji, what you say is very correct.In dream state no.1 if the jiva that dreams, dreams in that state itself ,which we can call dream state 2 and when that jiva wakes up and finds (in that  dream state No.1), that whatever  was there in this first dream state still exists, as it was ,before the jiva had gone into its dream state no.2,it is fully acceptable.

   BUT --- When the jiva wakes up fully and is in its jagrut state , the surroundings will be the  same as the jiva had left it before going into dream state and this thing will continue any number of times that the jiva leaves this jagrut avastha and goes to  swapmna avastha!    And the cycle continues!

We have to therefore make an effort to WAKE UP from this Jagrut avastha ALSO and get to the TRUTH !

Hari Om!

If I have made any mistake in the above, pl. correct me.

Thanks.
