It is my understanding that what is you describe is
not the "Absolute Advaita" position. First acceptable
level is One-ness underneath All, only because of
superimposition of Name and Form, we see plurality,
and at a higher level is the theory of Non-Creation.

When Rama asked Sage Vasistha, some question about
Jivas, Sage Vyasa said, "there are no Jivas".

There is no question of "all Jivatmas". There is only
ONE Atma or Brahman.
