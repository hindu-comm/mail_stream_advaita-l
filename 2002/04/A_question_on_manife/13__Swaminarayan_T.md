so after a jivatma gains moksha, he may still realise
the intrinsic oneness of all jivatmas, without denying

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

How can that be Advaita? For, the scriptures declare:

"Naanyotosti Dhrishta,naanyotosti shrotaa, naanyotosti manta,naanyotosti vigjyaata,

Eshata aatma antaryaami amrutahaa"!

After a jivaatma gains moksha, is it not a state where there is, as per our scriptures:

"Ekameva   advitiyam"

Also :  "Asangohyayam  purushahaa"

at
different stages of consciousness, truth appears to be
different, due to perceptional limitations.

--------------------------------------------------

Pure Conciousness is verily Truth. It cannot be otherwise.

Hari OM!
