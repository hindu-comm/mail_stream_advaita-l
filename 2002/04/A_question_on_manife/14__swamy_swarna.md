hari om. recently i have taken up a study of Viveka
Chudamani of Sri Adi Shankara and Pancha Dashi of Sri
Vidyaranya. The Avidya or Maya has several layers and
as we peel off or uncover these layers one by one, the
consciousness expands. The ultimate truth is only one
(that is why it is called advaita, not dual), but to
almost all of us, it is abstract.

i will get back to this subject after sometime after
my understanding increases by the study and
contemplation of these Advaitic Vedantic Texts.

Hara Hara Shankara.
