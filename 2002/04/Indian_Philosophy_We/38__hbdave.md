Visited. Very good.
Thanks for taking pains to set up a very useful site
on a compendium of various philosophies.

A small suggestion, is it possible to give a list of major
works in each system at the end of each article? If known
publications are given it will be very useful.
Just a suggestion, but follow your convenience.
