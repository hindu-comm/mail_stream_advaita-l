I should clarify.  What is needed is a guru who is an expert at least in
the proper pronounciation and employment of the mantras.  He may not
necessarily be a "realized soul" in the way Krishna Bhagawan means.
Though if you want to advance further you must find such a person.

That is a good idea and the quickest and surest path to success.  But
don't count America out completely.  Do some investigation and you may
find some elder in your community who can help.

It wouldn't hurt to ask them.  In the mean time you can'tgo wrong with
the Bhagavata purana and the Gita.

For Vedic stuff yes.  And that will make it a little harder as Yajurvedis
are comparatively more widespread.  (Though some are of the opinion that
it is better to learn the "wrong" shakha than not learn at all.)  But most
of contemporary Hinduism is the same for everyone.

What I tell people is don't worry if you don't become a maharshi
overnight.  As long as there is forward progress it is alright.  Bhagawan
knows the difficult circumstance we live in during this kaliyuga and all
He asks is we try our best.
