Unfortunatly in my edition "Sri RamaKrishna Math Mylapore, Chennai 600 004"
the Phala shruti is not included, a very brief description of it's contents
is reported in the Preface by the editor.

As a musician I am very much interested in the musical qualities of this
text end his hipnotic and repetitive structure; also the meditations on the
meanig of the various manifestations/functions is helping me a lot
inproving my spiritual life _ "Om Isvaryai namaha " _  I am therefore
intrested in the musical implication of this text and in it's astonishing
message for mankind -
Thanks for reminding to me that full respect should be given to such a text.

"Om catuh sasti kalA mayyai namaha "
