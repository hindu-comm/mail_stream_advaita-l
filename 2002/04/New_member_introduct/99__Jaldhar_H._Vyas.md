Hello,

I work for HCL Technologies in India for its Cisco Systems offshore
development center for the past 6 years,  after my graduation in IISc
Bangalore and a short stint at Wipro Technologies in India.

Coming from a SmArtha Tradition and been interested in Advaita
Philosophy after coming in touch with some *real* practitioners /
realized souls  and with  some limited  personal experience.
