Namaste,

Thanks for the kind introductory mail.

To introduce myself, I'm Sandeep based in Bangalore, working as a Technical
Writer at Kshema Technologies. I've been a Technical Writer for more than 3
years now, and my love for reading and writing intially brought me into this
profession.

Apart from my fondness for my profession, I have always had a keen
inclination towards spirituality and a fascination for higher aspects of
life than just the mundane and routine. In my college days, I had ardently
followed the writings of Swami Vivekananda, participated in a couple of
spiritual retreats and the like. Gradually, my interest drifted off towards
the Vedas, and I'm currently learning them. Being a smarta myself (I don't
know how politically correct this sounds, but I don't think it makes a
difference), I hit upon learning more about Adi Shankara's philosophy. When
I'm free I try to gather as much information about the same as possible.
Thanks to the Internet, I came upon your site through a search result in
Google.

Hope this introduction is sufficient. If you want anything else from me,
kindly send a mail.


Respectfully,
B.Sandeep
