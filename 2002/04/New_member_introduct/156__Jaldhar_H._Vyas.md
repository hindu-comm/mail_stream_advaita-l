Hi,

    I have been studying the Bhagavad Gita for a few years now - and was
looking for a forum to discuss the Gita. Someone pointed this group to me,
and I am quite interested to learn about Sankaracharya's teachings.
    Spiritual discussions interest me - and I am quite happy to learn of
this group's existence.
