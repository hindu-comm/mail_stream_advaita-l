This is a highly recommendable set of books. Suresvara's Vartika is a
lengthy and formidable text. The idea of splitting the translation into
multiple volumes makes it much easier to read and keep track of. Plus,
there has to be some motivation for the translators and publishers to
complete this project, and at least a small number of people outside of
academic institutions need to encourage it.

Best regards,
Vidyasankar
