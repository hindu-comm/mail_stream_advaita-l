What I am writing is not very origanal but I hope it will be of some use.

In the philosophy of Sri Sankara, Brahman is One without a second, devoid of
any creative power, relationless, without any qualities and --- if at all
the world is accepted, however provisionally --- completely transcendent of
it. The logical consequence of this concept of Brahman is that the world is
unreal, and so is the individual soul. However the world and the individual
soul may be explained, there is no gainsaying that they are not REAL. Maya
is and is not the power of Brahman; the former if the world be accepted and
sought to be explained, the latter if one has already gone beyond the sense
of its reality. Individual soul is either a limitation, false in the last
analysis of Brahman or a reflection, false again of Brahman in maya which
itself is unreal.
Inconviniently enough the world persists as a false appearance in eternal
Time and an eternally persistent false appearance could very well be
described as an inexplicable mystery, an uncategorisable illusion.
            In the Saiva darsana the Brahman is not devoid of will and
creates the world by a power of self limitation, Atma samkoca. This is root
of the philosophical difference between the two types of non-dualism.
Interestingly Kashmir Saivism has many similarities with Sri Aurobindo's
Purna Advaita. Sri Aurobindo was himself completely unfamilier with Kashmir
Saivism. The one capital difference between Aurobindo and Saivism is that
Saivism does not have anything resembling Aurobindo's concept of
transformation, rUpAntara. Here Saivism asserts like Sankara, deha pAta eva
pUrNa moksha.
