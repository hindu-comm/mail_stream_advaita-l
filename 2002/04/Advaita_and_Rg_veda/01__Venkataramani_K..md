Dear Prof. Himanshu,

Thank you very much for your kind response. I went through the posts you
referred me to and found them to be highly informative. I will have to read
them a few more times to understand better. I will certainly get back to
you with some questions.

"You will require some help in deciphering the mantras, unless you know
the methods already."

I am new to the vedas. I have only read Bhagavad Gita and parts of Srimad
Bhagavatam and a few writings of Kanchi paramacharya. So, I will appreciate
any guidance from you. I have Sri Aurobindo's Secret of the veda, but that
is only a translation, though it gives me a nice over all picture. Kindly
tell me how I should approach the vedas.

Thank you and regards,
Venkataramani K.
