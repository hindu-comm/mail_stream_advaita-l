That is what I was doubting i.e. can swadharma and following the lead of
your ancestors the same or do they differ, as they most certainly do in my
case. Swami Chandrashekharendra Sarasvatiji teaches through his book that
we must follow the dharma of our ancestors. So I was just thinking that
since Vedas have not been studied in my line for quite some time, has my
swadharma changed. Of course, if one takes the view that those who deviated
from their swadharma in the past erred in doing so (or were pushed into
giving up their swadharma), can it be said that those errors can be
corrcted now?
