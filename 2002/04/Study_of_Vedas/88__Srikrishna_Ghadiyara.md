The ultimate Swadharma is Selfhood. Yes, many of us
including our ancestors have gone away from our
Selfhood. So, we should not just get stuck with
Profession and livelyhood only as our Swadharma. I
believe, depending on our eagerness and intensity of
desire, we should continue our lively hood activity
and start travelling towards our Selfhood which is our
Swa Dharma.

It is a practice to shed our mental views of
differences and start thinking  all beings as ONE.
Ofcourse, this is not a miracle transformation, but
try we must. It is our Swadharma.

Om Namo Narayanaya !!

Srikrishna
