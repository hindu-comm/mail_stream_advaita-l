Hari Om !!

I did not mean to say that my conscience is superior
to the prescription of the Sruthi.

I too believe that good deeds of this birth will come
along with us in to the next birth. I also read in
"Advaita Bodha Deepika" that not necessarily wiil the
Vedic sadhana of this birth will come to us in the
next birth directly, but the samskaras or the end
results of such sadhana will definitely remain with
us.

My only view was that now that I realize the
importance of vedas, and the main teachings of the
vedas that God is there as bestower of results and we
can realize that God with in us, I should give highest
importance to meditation and necessary learning
towards that goal, and necessary life style change for
success in that path. If one believes that this can be
achieved through learning Samhitas, they may do so.
But for me, while I respect and revere the idea of
learning Samhitas, I will make use that approach as a
secondary means.

Om Namo Narayanaya !!

Srikrishna
