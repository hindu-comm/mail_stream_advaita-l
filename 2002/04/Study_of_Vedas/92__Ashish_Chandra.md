It means that Dharma will protect us only if we protect (follow) dharma.
But why do we need protection from Dharma? To what end is that protection
sought if not liberation, whether we realize it or not? So how can there
still be need for a dharma in a state of liberation, which is the state of
a jivanmukta?

Brahman is the swarupa of a jivanmukta, as it is of you and me. Only
difference is that the Jivanmukta abides in it, is fully absorbed in it.
Does Shankara not ask "Ko Varnaashrami bhavet" of one who has given up all
desire of this world and the next and desires liberation only i.e.
sannyasi? Then how is it logical to ask about a self-evident fact?

If swadharma be the same as our swarupa, why is it that man should seek
the chaturvidh purushaartha - dharma, artha, kaama and moksha. Since
swadharma *is* moksha, why would it be a separate purushaartha?

Our rishis certainly did not think karmakanda was unavoidable. Saadhana
Chaatushtyam is attained only after sincerely fulfilling one's karmas,
which is going through karmakanda portion of the Veda.

This is in response to Ashish's question on svadharma
based on his jati (subcaste):

Tyagi Braahmans (according to People of India Series:
Haryana) left puja-path and took to agriculture after
Bhagawan Parashurama destroyed many evil Kshatriyas
and distributed land to the Braahmans, Tyagis left
their traditional occupation to take care of that
land.  But also according to this book, they obviously
have the same gotras as all Braahmans and still wear
the yagnopaveeta (janeu or janoi); hence I would think
they are eligible to perform sandhya-vandana and learn
their saka, even though they may not be vaidiki
Braahmans as far as occupation is concerned.  They are
also traditionally vegetarian.

So when did they give up puja-path ?  Well according
to Hindu Dharma by the former Shanakaracharya of
Kanchi and also by many traditionalists, a mahayuga
(cycle of 4 yugas) is approximately 4.2 million years.
 Bhagawan Parashurama appeared on the 19th Treata Yuga
of this manvantara, hence approx 39 million years ago
by this method of calculation. Well it is probably
best to conclude that Tyagi Brahmins have given up
priesthood for many generations before the advent of
the Mughals.

Now Ashish if your immediate forefathers have given up
the janeu, probably some acharyas could describe
atonements, etc for this lapse based on the
dharmashastras.  But if you have undergone your
upanayana, as per shastras, you should be able to
study your saka.  Some people who be of help include
the elders of your jati, the 4(5) Shankaracharya
peethas in India, or your family prohit. Also there is
an association known as the Brahman Samaj of North
America (www.bsna.org) that has Tyagi Braahmans as
members; in addition there is member named Ramanath
Sharma, prof of Sanskrit at Univ of Hawaii, who is a
Kanyakubja Braahman from UP who may also be able to
provide you some info.  The DFW Hindu temple has 3
purohits: Punjabi braahman, Gujarati Braahman, and a
Telugu Braahman from Tamil Nadu; maybe one of them may
be knowledgable in your saka.  There are subcastes of
Braahmans belonging to the Madhyadina saka:
Telugu/Tamil/Kannada Prathamasakis and Madhydina
Braahmans of Maharashtra.

Hope this provides some help,

Ravi Chandrasekhara MD
