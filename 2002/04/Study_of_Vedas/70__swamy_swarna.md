hari om. aum namah shivaya. i have been following with
interest the discussion. i too would like to submit
the following, not from any position of authority but
to get some clarification.

The situation of most of the brahmins or brahmanas,
whatever spelling you prefer is similar to what Shri
Ashish Chandra brought out. Brahmanas became the land
holding community and by the very nature of the
occupation got entangled in the 'worldly' affairs and
while continuing to maintain their education in
loukika shastras like languages, grammar, astrology,
study and exposition of puranas etc., did give up the
study of vedas.

in such a situation, swadharma, narrowly interpreted
does take us more and more away from the eternally
true sanatana dharma. so what is the solution? go back
to the simple, austere lifestyle of study of vedas or
take a narrow interpretation that destiny has chosen
us to be born in such a family at such a time that our
dharma is to follow our immediate generation
preceding? neither solution appears to be
satisfactory.

is there a third solution? how about coming together
and setting up a trust which grooms youngsters of that
particular community in the study of vedas, esp. of
that particular shakha? since many of the children do
take a curriculum more out of economic necessity, why
not convert that very necessity into an opportunity?
that way, one would have done satkarma and also
arrested the extinction of that shakha.

i would like to read the views of other learned
members of the list.
