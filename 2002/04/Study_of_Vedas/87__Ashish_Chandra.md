I don't know and I don't think I have spoken to any of the elders about
this. The condition of Brahmins in North India is very different from those
in the South. Here we have become farmers and warriors and rarely does one
come across anyone doing Veda-adhyayan. But anyway, I hope I am correct to
presume that since I have a shakha, I should assume that the study of this
shakha was undertaken by our community a very long time ago. In that case,
I would like to know if there are any teachers of Madhyandina Shakha of SYV
in Dallas/Fort Worth area. I can try and learn at least the basic karmas.

thanks
