I doubt that we can mix up Swaroopa and Swadharma. Selfhood/Brahman is our
Swaroopa. How can it be a dharma, which entails some form of karma. As a
rhetorical question, we can logically ask whether a Jivanmukta is to follow
any dharma. The answer would be no, IMO.

But that practice must come through a mechanism that is tried and tested.
It cannot just appear without adequate preparation, and that is why
karmakanda is a must for non-Sannyasis. Secular actions consist of samaanya
dharma and they are the same for everyone and include, looking upon
everyone as a creation/manifestation of the Supreme.
