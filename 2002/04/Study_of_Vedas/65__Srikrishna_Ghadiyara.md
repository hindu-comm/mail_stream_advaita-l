I guess, this is what I am trying to high-light. How
foolish it is to spend time to acquire worldly
knowledge on death bed. It is apt for an American or
an Indian who knows not higher goals of this precious
life. But, if that is all one can aspire for, well,
one may go for it.

There is no doubt in my mind that one should learn the
Truth of Life and Realise it personally. Vedas whether
it be Samhitas or Vedanta (should and) are described
as a means of Knowledge. While one can certainly
benefit in gaining insights of these teachings by
learning Samhitas or Vedanta, it should not be an end
in all. More over it weighs in a lot on our mental and
intellectual ability.

Some time ago, I too felt that I should have learnt
the Vedas under some unexplicable emotion; rather when
I hear that this Vedic knowledge is endangered, as if
I am going to save it. But I realized it was not "I"
who can do it, the Supreme has His plans for it. It is
for me to use my time effectively to learn the
essentials at first and get into a more contemplative
life style, withdrawal and identify my own attachments
and get over those short comings. In my view they are
more important than at first emotionally deciding to
learn Samhitas. After all the Goal is Realisation not
memorisation of Samhitas.

We all know one has to give up Samhitas for realising
or rather being One with Brahman , after duly and
directly experiencing the Truth. It is with this
clarity that I said, I wish not to waste this short
life for Samhitas but Seek within. Of course, all
entertainment, diversion or time pass can be gained
through Swadhyaya, if not engaged in Enquiry with in,
so that a man does not destroy the progress of mind.

Yes, Sanyasa at physical and mental and intellectual
levels is needed. I learnt a small distinction in the
interpretation of Sanyasa. In the beginning it is for
the purpose of developing non-attachment i.e Sadhana
Sanyasa. Once established in non-attachemnt it is True
Sanyasa. In that perspective, I said that one needs to
adapt to a better life style conducive to this higher
goal. Without making abrupt changes to present life,
if one can practice those virtues of non-attachment in
this present life, and see how one does in, say, one
year, then more sustainable Sanyasa can be adapted.

I also read Malayala Swami saying that it is good to
live for one year in an asram before taking Sanyasa.
It seemed practical to me. We have a scope to evaluate
ourselves, and do not do things out of a temporary
mental situation.

Swadharma is not a matter of Sanyasa or otherwise.
Yes, one has to do present duties and confirm to
Sanyasa dharma too if adopted.

It is true, if one thinks he/she is a Brahman or a
Kshatriya, they should do what is prescribed of them.
But, with some intellectual analysis one can
discriminate if one is just a Brahmana or beyond that.
But as one has already accepted to certain life and
committed to others one should preferably complete
those by performing those duties with detachment, as
much as possible.

I guess it is upto ones scheme of evaluation or
evolution of mind. As long as one is bound by thoughts
that one is a Grihastha etc., one may continue to do
those duties. But, one has to come out of such
identifications any way, some time.

This is the question I suggested in the beginning,
"Please consider carefully, the purpose and utility of
learning Veda Samhitas at this age." A search for
these questions, What is Service ? Whom to serve ? is
what should lead one internally to the Supreme, that
is my belief. As it is said, "This is the Supreme Good
to man and nothing else"

As long as one "enjoys" action in this plane,
Realisation is possibly, not possible. As we all know
Karma is binding. So, I was only suggesting that one
should discover that art of detached Karma through
Service to One, and All as One. Let the higher duty
unfold itself, in this pursuit.

I guess Krishna did not suggest Karma Yoga in the way
interpreted, in isolation. I believe Krishna's
response was due to Arjuna's untimely wavering. If
only Arjuna fought the battle and won the Kingdom and
then renounced, then Krishna would not have told him
the same lesson, or atleast in the same way. So, it
was truly fatal to the Pandava's duty if Arjuna ran
away from battle, for his inner traits would remain
unfulfilled. So, he had to fight. Of course it was the
plan of Krishna. So, Krishna taught Arjuna the value
of performing Swadharma with detachment, as an
instrument of God/Him. A similar thing can be
explained about a Sanyasi too.

All is a matter of failures to succeed. It is the mind
which is progressing through evolution. For one fails
now, one should not give up an attempt. After all what
is failure ? We all know failure in the pursuit of
nobler is better than success in paltry.

So, it is important that one re-programs his/her life
style in connection with the society and family and
practice Happy cheerful living in all times, in
hormony with nature and fellow beings, as a first
step. True, Vedic way of living should lead one to
peace. But, since we are in an intellectual community,
we are trying to understand the rationale, so that we
can implement such changes more effectively in to our
own lives.

Note: While writing my response to this post, it is
not my intention to say that I know better than you or
any one else. But to present the ideas from a layman's
perspective, as I am, and still migrate the view to a
higher goal.

Om Namo Narayanaya !!
