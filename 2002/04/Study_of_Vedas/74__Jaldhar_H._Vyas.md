I should clarify at this point that what is being urged is not learning
Vedas per se but shedding the ego by following your duty with no
ulterior motive but as a sacrifice to the Lord.  That is karmayoga and for
Brahmans it involves learning the Vedas but for others it might be
something else.  If one fails to do this, no matter how lofty his reasons,
he will never achieve any success in getting mukti.

Himanshubhai said it well there is too much putting the Vedas on a
pedastal going on.  we need less respecting and revering and more DOING.
Make it secondary if you must but don't neglect it altogether.
