Thanks for these words Ravi.
I was once listening to a discourse on the Bhagavatam when Sri Anantarama
Dikshidhar said: to remove karma (the actual effect of past actions) one
needs karma; but the remove the vasanas that will cause one to do it again,
one needs upasana. So you are absolutely right; one with out the other is
fairly slow, but together, they are greater than the sum of the parts.

However, please correct me if I am wrong here, I think both of them will
still lead one to only a state of chitta suddhi. Not jnana. One will still
need to be dedicated to the pursuit of the jnana that will actually cut the
veils of ignorance ... right?
