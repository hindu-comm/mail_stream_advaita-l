Actually I will put into music only the Namavali , it would be too long to
add also the stotram.

The Namavali is very interesting from number of syllables : 72 names has
sixteen syllables, 242 eight, 278 four, 138 three, 122 five, 34 six, 7
nine, 3 eleven, 3 twelve, 2 of seven sylables and three of a single
syllable. This will give a lot of different possibilities. Probably the
stotra has a more interesting poetical structure, but I feel much more
atracted by the austerity of the namavali .

Thanks a lot Jaldhar for your kind help

sincerely
