2) There is another translation, which is based on saubhagya-bhaskara
and but does not follow it verbatim. It has some additions and
deletions. It is by a scholar from keraLa done in last 19th century or
early 20th cebtury in malayalam. English translation is by a devotee of
mAtA amRtAnandamayI. It is a good one and available from
www.ammachi.org.

3) Sanskrit text of the commentary is easily available in India and I
also saw some in the University of Texas library
