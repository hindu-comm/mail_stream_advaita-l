If you can locate  saubhaagyabhaaskarabhaasya   by Bhaskararaya, it is
considered the most illuminating commentary on Lalitaasahasranaama.

shriilalitaa is considered the kaameshvarii swarupa of  brahmavidyaa,
i.e. parabrahmamahi.sii

she is  "s.rgaarapradhaana
other names are :
"sriividyaa  raajaraaje"svarii  mahaatripurasundarii  baalaa  pa~ncadasii
.suda"sii
and is equivalent to  cit "sakti  in Vedanta.

She seats on the lap of mahaakaame"svara (= "siva = brhman of Vedanta),
on a platform upheld by pa~ncamahaapreta.

She controls va"sinii vaak etc.

The interesting thing from view point of Advaita is :
the total non-duality  (paramasaamya) of Shiva and Shakti is called
saamarasya, and its achievement is considered the ultimate achievement.
That achievement is represented by "sriilalitaambaa.

A musician will naturally be attracted by the phonetic quality of the
stotra. Set to proper raaga according to the mood of the meaning of
a particular group of names and proper taala, the stotra should be
an unforgettable  experience.  Though the basic metre is simple anu.s.tup
("sloka) as mentioned by Shri Jaldharji,  the phonetic patterns can be
used to weave other rhythemic patterns, overlayed on the basic rhythm.

The basic concept is the infinite variety of play of Maya and if a musician
can bring about a representation of this via rhythemic and tonal patterns,
(raaga maalikaa?) it should be a  memorable experience as mantioned above.
