    I have heard that man's body is threefold, the
sthula, the
sukshma and the karana shariras. Sadasiva Brahmendra
is said to have simultaneously shed each of these
bodies in thee distant places. I understand that the
first
is the gross body and the second is the energy (prana)
body
surrounding the first in which the Kundalini lies and
so on.
Could others in the group shed light on what is the
Karana sharira?

Yours in Jignasa,
Ganesh
