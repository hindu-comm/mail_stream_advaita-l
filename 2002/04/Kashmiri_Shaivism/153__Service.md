Dear Jaldar:

There is 'no conflict between Kashmiri Shivism and
Advaita Vedanta' is the instruction of Muktananda
Paramahansa, preemminent kundalini master and founder
of Siddha Yoga.

The idea that the world is a 'reflection' in Shivism
and a 'superimposition' in Advaita are not
contradictory. First both are just that 'ideas', they
indicate that the world is a temporal play of
consciousness. Either a reflection or a superimposition
the world is an 'empirical' experience of the observer.

The question is 'Who is the observer? When the observer
has merged with the observed, both disappear in pure
awareness. There is no body, no mind, no
object...indeed no world. All has merged in the
brightness of seeing.

The identity of the seer, independent of even tradtion
- is the witness to the unalloyed flow of Truth alone.
>From the point of view of eternity, the fragrance of
the seer - the world does not 'exist' as such for
either tradition. All forms are impermanent. All forms
are insentient. The spirit alone is the sentient seer.
The Self within.

Form enables us to extract knowledge from the plenum of
Truth. Thus form enables us to expand our minds and
hearts until the identity of the observer has merged
with the supreme source. The Absolute. Spirit without
form.

This is my understanding.

Namaste,
Chareles Balducci
