I guess the problem i am having is understanding what is the nature of the
sentient seer.  If he is already Shiva then what is there to see?  Advaita
Vedanta says that the essential Shiva-nature of the atma has been
"obscured" or "forgotten" because of Maya.  But if you do not accept that
idea then where do the impermanent names and forms come from?  The
Kashmiri Shaivism website (I do not know if it is accurately representing
the philosophy or not but let us assume it is.) suggests it is the
kriyashakti (power of creation) of Shiva Bhagawan which is responsible but
then we come to the problem facing all theisms.  Is God such a sadist that
He creates beings only to torture and destroy them?  Or is it
Shiva-as-atma who creates?  Then you have the problem of idealism.  If we
are all doing our own creating, why do most things look so similiar to
all of us?
