Can anyone tell what the meaning of the term "archAvatAra" is ?  (I don't
know if I got the term right too).

I read the following line in a book on Sriman-nArAyaNIyam published by Sri
Chinmaya Mission:

"...the image is an incarnation of the Lord known as archAvatAra in the
viSvaksena samhita..."

1.  The image being refered to is Sri Guruvayoor of Kerala
2.  The line quoted above is in the commentary of verse 1

Thank you for any assistance.

SVS
