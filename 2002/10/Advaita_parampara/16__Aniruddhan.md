namaste,

>There is a shukarahasyopaniShad, belonging to the shuklayajurveda, which

>sadAshiva samArambhAm.

Is this verse present in the Complete Works of Shankaracharya published by
Samata Books? Recently, I got a chance to peruse one of the volumes (the one
with Stotras etc) for some time, and I don't think I saw this verse in that
volume. I have also heard another version of this which goes "dakshiNamUrti
samArambhAm..."

Is Shukacharya said to be a chiranjeevi in the advaita tradition? The time
period between Gaudapadacharya and Shukacharya seems to be quite large.
