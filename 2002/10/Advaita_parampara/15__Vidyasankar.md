There is a shukarahasyopaniShad, belonging to the shuklayajurveda, which
says that mahAdeva initiated shuka, son of vyAsa, by imparting the
mahAvAkyas to him. Traditionally, gauDapAda is said to have been a disciple
of shuka. This explains the alternative form of the verse, which reads
sadAshiva samArambhAm.
