"Reconciliation" is probably what you are looking for.  I request you also
to browse the archives of this list where many people have expressed their
opinions in the past between these two fields of knowledge.

I have met people of both extremes:  on the one hand some people (like my
father-in-law) believes that there will come a day when science and Vedanta
will reconcile 100% and there would seamless flow of ideas from both sides.
On the other hand there are people who think that they will never since the
problem domain of both bodies of knowledge belong to different orders of
reality namely empirical and phenomenal.

I think only those who are adept at both will be able to make an
authoritative comment on it.  So far the only conclusion that I can come to
is that there seem to be certain overlaps in the methodologies adopted by
both.  I can't recollect the specific instances of such observation, but do
carry a cumulative impression over a period of learning.

Please do keep us educated with your ideas as you advance in your studies.

Regards,
SVS

Subject: Weekly page from Hindu Dharma: We Need All Types of Knowledge

This week's page from Hindu Dharma (see note at bottom) is "We Need All Types of Knowledge" from "Nyaya". The original page can be found at http://www.kamakoti.org/hindudharma/part13/chap5.htm.

Next week, you will be emailed "Tarka Treatises" (from "Nyaya")

We Need All Types of Knowledge
from Nyaya, Hindu Dharma

      We must make good use of our brain and mind. Indeed, we must make them sharp as if by frequent honing so that they will help us in finding the truth. Why did Sankara master all the sastras, all the arts, all the sciences, Sankara who thought the world was Maya? Why did he ascend the "sarvajna-pita" (seat of omniscience)?

 I said Nyaya was also known as Tarka, "Anviksiki". We learn from the Sankara-Vijaya that the Acarya mastered Nyaya or Anviksiki, Kapila Maharsi's "Kapilam" (Sankhya), Patanjali's Yoga-sastra ("Patanjalam"), Kumarilabhatta's Mimamsa ("Bhatta-sastra").

 Anviksikyaiksi tantre paracitiratula

 Kapile kapi lebhe

 Pitam Patanjalambhah paramapi viditam

 Bhatta ghattartha-tattvam

 Advaita embraces even those sastras that apparently do not speak about it. That is why I am speaking about all such sastras though I am called "Sankaracarya". Non-dualism inheres dualism, qualified non-dualism, Saivism, Vaisnavism and so on. It enfolds even those systems that are critical of it. Advaita does not state that other systems are totally false. If it opposes them it is only to the extent needed to counter their argument against itself. It concedes them the place they deserve.





Note:
Hindu Dharma is a translation of two volumes of the well known Tamil Book "Deivatthin Kural", which, in turn, is a book of 6 volumes that contains talks of His Holiness Sri Chandrasekharendra Saraswathi Mahaswamiji of Kanchipuram. The entire book is available online at http://www.kamakoti.org/ .
