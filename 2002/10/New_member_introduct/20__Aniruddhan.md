If I may make a suggestion: Please go through the discussions and articles
in the archives of this list and also the excellent website on Advaita
Vedanta (and its history) maintained by Sri Vidyasankar Sundaresan -
www.advaita-vedanta.org/avhp/
I found both of these resources extremely helpful when I started off
learning about Advaita.
