Thanks!

I will look up the references you sent me.

Vedanta is internaly consistent, as is science.
To say that there may be scientific validation
of Vedanta is not to imply that Vedanta is in need
of such validation, but that Vedanta is not only
internally consistent, but also consistent with science.
Similarly, science is not only internally consistent,
but consistent with Vedanta.
Thus there would be a way to 'translate' from one
paradigm to the other.

Naturally, there are bound to be areas of both which
do not translate well into the other!

Or perhaps 'validation' is the wrong term altogether.

The scientific method, ultimately derived from Des Cartes,
has a very interesting logical structure.

Its interesting, though, that Des Cartes stopped short with
his 'I think therefore I am'. Its ultimate evolution would
surely be more like 'There is thinking'.

I believe that Des Cartes was somewhat limited in what he could
write due to the political pressures of the powerful christian
influence of the day.
