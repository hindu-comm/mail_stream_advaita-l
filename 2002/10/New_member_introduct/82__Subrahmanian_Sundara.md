Can you explain for the benefit of members the following paragraph a little
more?

Just on the side, the only place I read about quantum computers is in
Michael Crichton's "Timeline".  He admits that all the theories he has
propounded, though being studied by the academia, is in the realm of
speculation.

The thing which most recently sparked my interest, was the discovery
that the theory of quantum computers opens up a whole field
of scientific validation of Advaita Vedanta etc. in terms of the
many worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics.
