Well done. This is the first and foremost prerequisite to knowing anything.

You might like to read some conversations we've had on this topic in
recent months.

Samadhi is orthogonal to the goal of Advaita Vedanta which is moksha.  The
functions of the mind cannot be stopped  (short of death or a coma. etc.)
At best the yogis can temporarily arrest them.  This is called samadhi.
And it is useful insofar as it gives stability or tranquility for pursuit
of the real goal.  But we Advaitins do not believe it can be a permanent
state.  To achieve moksha one must have jnana -- the total and unshakeable
belief that all names and forms are one only -- with or without samadhi.
