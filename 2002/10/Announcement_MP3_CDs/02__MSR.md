 Please note this series is 80+ hrs of recording. And it goes over the
commentary of bhaaskararaaya and recorded over a period of 6 years (in
Tamil). You need the original text to follow it well and closely. I
just sampled first 30+ minutes and it almost went line by line of the
text and will required effort and concentration to listen and
understand.  If you are devii bhakta -- it is great treasure for you.

If you need more info contact ravi at ambaa.org.
