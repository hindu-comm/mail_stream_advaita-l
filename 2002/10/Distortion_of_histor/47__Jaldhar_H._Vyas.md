I don't have an exact cite but I remember Satyartha Prakasha was full of
such things.

Incidently, Dayananda puts the Upanishads in the same boat as the Puranas.
For him Veda = only the Samhitas, a view which was totally unheard of in
India prior to the arrival of Western historians.

Perhaps insofar as what is human is possibly "inauthentic" but it is the
fundamentalist conceit that books are possibly "authentic"  Because books,
especially the Vedas which too this day are passed down through oral
tradition, depend on people to propogate them.

Dayananda like many of the 19th century reformers didn't actually like
Hinduism.  But in keeping with the Romantic movement of those times he
wanted his radical ideas to be rooted in the past even if he had to invent
it.

The Hindu (actually Mimamsaka) view on the sources of Dharma are as
follows.  Shruti (i.e. the Vedas) is not of Human origin.  Some darshanas
say God is the author but the Mimamsakas are not even prepared to concede
that much.  The Rshis through some process we do not understand "saw" the
Vedic mantras.  (Rshi means mantra drashta)  They began pondering the
meaning of those mantras and those musings, arguments, and analysis became
the smrtis.  We need them to actually  understand Shruti.  For instance,
sandhyavandana is the most commonly practiced Vedic rite today.  But the
Vedas have exactly this much to say about it: "Day to day he should
observe the sandhya."  That's it.  No further explanation about what
that entails.  We have to go to the grhyasutras and other smrtis to find
out.

In every age there are new demands and situations and they are resolved
with the guidance of those who are learned in Shruti and Smrti.  This is
called shishtachara and is the third pillar of Dharma.  A classic example
is Holi.  This is not mentioned in the Vedas or any Smrti for that matter.
So the Mimamsakas ask is it a valid practice.  The answer is yes because
it is a custom since time immemorial and Vedic scholars are also seen
observing it.

Only in the case of a conflict does the prior trump the latter but
otherwise Shruti, Smrti, and Shistachara are of equal authority in knowing
Dharma.  For instance Navaratri which we recently observed is based on the
Markandeya Purana and Katyayani Tantra but this makes it no less "Vedic."

It depends on what you mean by "at odds." Shankaracharya definitely
considers nirguna to be a more accurate description of Brahman but Saguna
Brahman is nevertheless still Brahman.  In Advaita Vedanta, the two
traditions are two parts of one whole and which one needs to be followed
depends on the calibre of the seeker.

The idea that those who believe in a Nirguna Brahman such as Advaitins are
atheists and bhakti has no place in their philosophy is propoganda spread
by rivals and not based on fact.  Shankaracharya and later Advaitins such
as Swami Madhusudan Saraswati, and Appaya Dikshita have been ardent
bhaktas.  They see knowledge of the Self as the highest goal of Bhakti.

Also bear in mind that even "philosophical" works like Yogavasishta or
Bhagavadgita (part of the Mahabharata) are itihasa-purana and hence smrti.

Yes this is true.  But just because there are some valid differences of
opinion doesn't mean any old opinion is valid.  Some are too silly to be
taken seriously and Dayanandas view fall into that category in my opinion.

The Brahmasutras themselves mentions smrti in a number of places and
Shankaracharya provides references.  He also mentions them in various
contexts.

1.2.25 Shankaracharya quotes the Bhagavad Gita

1.3.25 Shankaracharya says when doubt arises on the meaning of a Shruti
text, smrti should be consulted.

1.3.30 Mentions the Puranic idea of pralaya.

2.1.1-2 explains what is a valid Smrti and its relation to Shruti.
Shankaracharyas commentary follows the Bhatta Mimamsaka aproach.

3.1.14-16 quotes Manusmrti and mentions the Puranic story of Chitra and
Chitragupta being the servants of Yama.

3.1.19 Shankaracharya quotes the Mahabharata

3.3.32 Shankaracharya mentions several Puranic stories about the birth of
various sages.

4.1.10 Shankaracharya quotes the Bhagavad Gita,

4.2.14 Shnakaracharya quotes the Mahabharata,

These are ones I could dig up at short notice, there may be others.
Shankaracharya has also quoted from the Vishnu Purana in his Gitabhashya.

I think this demonstrates his attitude towards Itihasa-Puranas and other
smrtis.
