Yes. You are right. That thought was at the back of my mind but I guess the
written email did not carry it through. And another thought behind me
sending the earlier note was that we seem to get caught up in all sorts of
arguments and counter arguments in this list. I think we must each do our
home work well and understand the other's point of view before we start
contracdicting and be able to have a balanced argument.

And yes, one definitely needs to understand advaita the way our acharyas did
all the way upto Sada Shiva Himself. If we don't even try, then we might as
well say we are not really what we read and write about, but just imposters.
