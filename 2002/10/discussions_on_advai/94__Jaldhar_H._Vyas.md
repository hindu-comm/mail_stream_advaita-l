And even more so we should understand the opponents of Vedanta as well as
he did. The main point I got from his words is that as Advaitins we cannot
simply declare some area off-limits because it is not "ours" In fact all
truth, all knowledge whether it is nyaya or quantam physics is part of our
shastra.  Of course some knowledge is more useful for certain tasks then
others but there is no truth which is not worth knowing.

Yet people learn it in college all the time.

This is a big practical problem.  What do you sacrifice in order to learn
as much as you can in as short a time?  But I think the person  who takes
the time to learn such a profound subject even to make a balidana of it is
much better off in the long run.

This is a bogus reason.  Is a Guru supposed to be a master or a servant?
If the Guru says you need to learn this and a shishya doesn't turn up
either a. he doesn't trust his Guru to act for his welfare. or b. he is to
lazy or egotistical to do what is right and proper.  In either why bother
with such people as they will never be able to progress in Vedanta anyway?

There is the cultural aspect to consider too.  When Shankaracharya is
talking about nyaya he isn't talking to some professor, he is talking to
someone like him.  The ongoing conversation between nyaya and advaita
vedanta has been going on for centuries and has affected both sides. If
you are not aware of that you will miss nuances.  Take for example the
refrain in Bhaja Govindam.  na hi na hi rakshate dukr~nkarane.  What is
dukr~nkarane?  a footnote in the book you're reading or the lecturer you
are listening to might tell you it is a sutra of Panini but only an
understanding of vyakarana will help you grasp the full significance of
it.

In my opinion, purva mimamsa is even more important from a practical point
of view than Vedanta.  Purva mimamsa affects every act of your daily life
(if you are trying to live a Dharmic life that is.)

Again is this really true or is this just an assumption?  If one doesn't
know the kind of objections that were made in the past will one even be
able to recognize if there are similiar situations today?  The Dvaitins
subjected the tenets of Advaita Vedanta to a rigorous critique which in my
opinion is still valuable today.

But how will you understand Shankaracharya without understanding his
context?  Academic philosophers spend a lot of their time on the history
of ideas because they recognize the need for context.  To blindly follow
Shankaracharya is better than doing nothing or blindly following a lesser
person but inferior to true understanding.  Only true understanding will
lead to mukti.

I have a good deal more respect for Swami Dayananda than most of the
modern swamis who claim to speak for Advita Vedanta but here unfortunately
he seems to be afflicted by the same malady that affects most modernists,
he advises based on "you don't have to" instead of "you can."  No doubt
it is based on much practical experience in dealing with todays "instant
mystics" who squeeze in a Vedanta class between a tennis match and the
latest episode of Friends.  And technically he is correct.  You don't
"need" to know nyaya or mimamsa or brahmasutras or indeed any sanskrit in
order to succeed in the goals of Advaita Vedanta.  Just as you don't
really "need" to eat more than a few mouthfuls a day in order to live.
But who would want to live without flavors and variety?

Don't be a reductionist.  Expand your mind outwards further and further
until it is all this and 10 fingers beyond.  That is moksha.
