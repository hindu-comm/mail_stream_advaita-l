Dear Sri. Malolan,

Thank you very much for the informative post. A few questions:

<<Radheya is mentioned in Srimad Bhagavatam. This is not the Radha who
devotees worship now.>>

Could you kindly point out the verse in SB that refers to Radheya?

<<Radha as celebrated by Jayadeva and the Radha we know now.>>

I didn't understand this point. Does it mean that the Radha of Jayadeva is
different from the Radha of Brahma Vaivarta Purana?

Regards,
Venkat
