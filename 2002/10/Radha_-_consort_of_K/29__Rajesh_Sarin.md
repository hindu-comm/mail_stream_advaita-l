Can anybody share his/her knowledge about Radha - the consort of Lord
Krishna.
I am interested to know, which book can give me complete life story of
Radha.
Moreover, please share knowledge about - who was Radha, where was she born,
who were her parents, WHY COULD SHE NOT GET OFFICIALLY MARRIED TO
LORD KRISHNA ? etc.

thanks - Sarin Rajesh
