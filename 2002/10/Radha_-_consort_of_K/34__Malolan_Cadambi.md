Dear Members,

I spent sometime going through the Yadavabhyudayam and Srimad Bhagavatam. Here are some conclusions:

1.) Radheya refered to in Srimad Bhagavatam is not Radha. He is Karna. Radheya is another name for Karna.

2.) The Radha whom we worship today as Radha - Krishna finds mention only in the Brahma Vaivarta Purana and the Brahmanda Purana.

It is however true that the worship of Radha in south india was introduced by Jayadeva. One reason why the worship of Radha was absent in South India could be the focus of south indian vaidikas on the Satvika Puranas instead of the Rajasa and Tamasa purana.

Regards,

Malolan Cadambi
