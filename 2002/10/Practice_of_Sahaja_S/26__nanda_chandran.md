The "mind being destroyed" should be understood well. One can control the
mind not to function - chitta vritti nirodah - during meditation. But it is
only for a temporary period of time. Once you let go of the wilful control,
the mind will start functioning again (Shankara's dialectic against the
Svaatantra Vijnaanavaada Bauddhas like Dharmakirti should be understood in
this regard). The permanent solution to chitta vritti lies in abiding in
ones own self and finally becoming it (the "becoming" here is used only in a
relative sense) for the self always is.
