That's a good point, and it puzzled me when I first
read about the "*practice* of Sahaja Samadhi." I
thought that perhaps RM's answer was only tangential
to the question asked.

However, in the English translation of RM's Tamil
translation of Shankara's work
"dR^ik-dR^ishya-viveka", it is said, "One must engage
in the practice of Sahaja Samadhi."

Can learned members please clarify?
