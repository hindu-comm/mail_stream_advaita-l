The term is not just sarvakarmasa.nnyaasa, but sarvakarma-sa.nnyaasa-
puurvaka. Accordingly, sarvakarmasa.nnyaasa is said to be prior to
aatmaGYaananiShThaa.

Talking of niHshreyasa as an "effect" is somewhat figurative here. Also,
the word dharma here is used to contrast pravR^itti and nivR^itti. It is
not used in the sense of attribute or nature. And as far as translation is
concerned, it is to be recognized that the verb used is bhavati.

saMkShepa refers to briefness or conciseness, but can also indicate the
essence. In that sense, it would imply ultimate also, but ultimacy is not a
direct meaning of saMkShepa.

Yes, you have answered your own doubt. The dharma referred to in (1) is the
nivR^itti dharma. There is no "active pursuance" of this dharma, inasmuch
as it consists of renouncing sarva-karma and desisting from further karma.
On the other hand, the dharma referred to in (2) is pravR^itti dharma. It
is necessary to specify all the above, in order to remove the differentiate
between the renunciation of even good deeds (nivR^itti) and actively
pursuing evil deeds (adharma).

>Also, from the tone and sequence of the words 'dharmi,

Yes, that is a possible interpretation of the term shubhaashubhii.

tUShNI refers to being silent, while liina means firmly grounded.

Questions are always welcome, and indeed, you have reminded me that the
next instalment of this series is overdue now. I'll try to get it moving
soon.

Today was the first day of Sharadiya Navaratri or Durgapuja.  Here is a
