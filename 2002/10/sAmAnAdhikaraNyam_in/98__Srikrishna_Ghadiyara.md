Hari Om !!

Continuing my previous question:

Referring to "tat tvam asi", the author says as
follows:

"it cannot be a
> upAsana
> vAkya, but it must be a tattva-vAkya."

Originally in the foot note it is referred as "upadEsa
vAkya", and now it is called as "tattva vAkya" How
these two types of sentences are similar or different
?

Om Namo Narayanaya !!

Srikrishna

Namaskaram.
 I cannot but help highlight yet another aspect of our Acharya's speech in
the recent posting from Weekly page from Hindu Dharma: Rational Way to Know
God.
Please note that HH mentions:
"It is indeed commendable to have faith in the Lord and in the sastras even
without carrying out any intellectual inquiry. But are we able to have such
complete faith that will take us across worldly existence? Instead of idling
away one's time, without making any intellectual effort to discover the
truth, would it not be better to keep thinking even if it be to arrive at
the conclusion that there is no God? A person who does so is superior to the
idler who has no intellectual concern whatsoever. perhaps the athesit, where
he to continue his inquiry, would develop sufficient intellectual clarity to
give up his atheism. But the idler has no means of advancing inwardly."

There have been some in our list (including myself!) in the past who have
defended the role of faith and faith alone when it was pointed out that even
the best of teachers need to be subjected to rational criticism. I only wish
to use our Acharya's words as a means of prodding all of us to not take
everything on mere faith but to question every thing. When doing so, one
must also observe that HH mentions " This means that Nyaya takes every care
to see that reasoning does not take a course that is captious (remember what
I told you about the Acarya's view that tarka should not become kutarka )
and that it leads to the discovery of truth."

And to add some words from a discourse by Sri Krishna Premi, even the great
Madhusudhana Saraswati, a great Krishna Bhakta, wrote a tratise on advaita
called the advaita siddhi. Sri Krishna Premi says that Sri Madhusudhana
Saraswati actually prepared his mind and intellect and churnned it
repeatedly with vigourous analysis to get the clear and crisp butter that is
perfect understanding and offered this butter to Krishna! So, why are we not
doing it too? Is it not a show of true devotion to actually take effort in
preparing the delicious dishes that Krishna really wants!!

May Shankara help us and lead our understanding forward in the spirit of
true enquiry and offering to Him.
