In this article the author, while explaining the jAti-vyakti
samAnAdhikaranya, writes:

"Words which are placed in the coordinate relation as
in the expression this cow refer to one and the same
object. Though the connotations of the words are
different  the word this refers to the particular
(vyakti), and the word cow refers to the universal
(jAti), they nevertheless refer to one and the same
object. This type of coordinate relation between jAti
and vyakti is known as JAti-vyakti-sAmAnAdhikaraNya.


But this type of coordinate relation cannot be adopted
in interpreting the mahAvAkyas, for jAti-vyakti
relation is applicable only to insentient objects.
Both jAti and vyakti are insentient. But IShvara and
jIva are sentient. Hence the mahAvAkyas cannot be
interpreted by this type of coordinate relation. "

How is the second paragraph justified ? Comparing his reason with the
example of 'this cow', how can we say 'cow' to be 'insentient' (though cow
is a generic noun of a species)?

Om Namo Narayanaya !!

The ghadi was the smallest unit I was sure of so I just worked backwards
from there.  The typical time-measuring device in ancient India was the
water clock which was probably not capable of better than sub-minute
accuracy at best.  However it is possible to get more accurate measurement
by rational numbers.  For example the length of the year is given in
jyotisha books as 1577917500 / 4320000 which comes out to 365.25868
days which is slightly over the correct number, 365.25636, but more
accurate than the Gregorian calendar.

Also note the calendar presented here is more accurately called
luni-solar.  Although the days and months are based on lunar cycles,
additions and subtractions are made to keep them in sync with the solar
year.

Yes sorry that was an error on my part.  (I guess all those zeros made me
dizzy :)  That means all the subsequent numbers are off by a factor of a
100.  The corrected numbers are:

30 days of Brahma = 1 month of Brahma (129,600,000 human years)
12 months of Brahma = 1 year of Brahma (1,555,200,000 human years)
25 years of Brahma = 1 kalpa (38,880,000,000 human years)
2 kalpas = 1 parardha (77,760,000,000 human years) [6]
2 parardhas = 100 years of Brahma
            = the lifespan of Brahma (155,520,000,000 human years)

Thanks for the correction.

I have some big plans for this but the first task is to get the basic
calculations correct.  The only good book I've found with algorithmic
descriptions is "Calendrical Calculations" by N. Dershowitz and E.
Rheingold.  It covers most of the worlds major calendars and has chapters
on two types of Hindu Calendar.  However the authors are mathematicians
not Sanskritists and they've had to rely on secondary sources which means
there are differences between their descriptions and how our calendars
actually work.  This means I've had to go to sources like Suryasiddhanta
and Aryabhatiyam which are not easy reading.

I don't know about that.  The puranic texts I've read all pretty much seem
to follow the same system.  But  I have not studied the subject in detail.

If you want to organize something like that go right ahead.
