Although this whole topic is quite outside the scope of this list, here
goes.

Points # 1 and 2 are moot. The sandbar connecting India and Sri Lanka is as
old as the landmasses themselves. At high tide, the maximum depth of the
rock under the water is never more than 4 feet. One can literally walk
across the "bridge", except that the area is heavily patrolled by the navies
and coast guards of both countries.

Point #3 above is quite mistaken. The NASA description talks of clouds in
elsewhere in the satellite photograph. It has nothing to do with the
"bridge" per se.

And if we think about it a little, small strips of land connecting two
larger landmasses are quite common on earth. There is the isthmus of Panama
connecting the northern and southern American continents. There is another
strip of land between South America and Antarctica. So, there is no need
either to be totally skeptical of the photographs or to be highly elated
over them! Hope this puts this thread to rest.
