Swami Tattvavidaananda of Arsha Vidya Gurukulam once said the following
regarding Indra:

"The Indra of the puraaNas and the Indra of the Rg Veda are not the same.
While the Indra of the puraaNaas is a devataa, the Indra of the Rg Veda is
viShNu or iishvara.  More than 50% of the hymns in the Rg Veda are dedicated
to Indra".

Just FYI.

Regards,
SVS
