Namaste,

Firstly we should take these numbers as approximate, rounded
numbers.

Secondly, I would like to mention a peculiar characteristic of this
Self, i.e. consciousness: anything that It focus its attention on
gets infused with "life". Just the fact that we all use the C. E.
makes it very full of life. It is not at all important that 0 C. E.
is related to no historical event at all.

Best regards
Shrinivas
