But the question is was Swami Yukteshwar a competant astrologer?  (I don't
know I'm asking you.)  From what I know he was an accomplished Yogi but
does expertise in one area necessarily translate to expertise in another?

But experts at least explain why they hold the views they do.  Did swami
Yukteshwar say why he thought the way he did?  If so do you understand it?
Do you agree?

If the lecture has to be repeated then it obviously failed so I shan't
bother to repeat myself.  If people refuse to think I can't force them.

What I am trying to convey is a sense of enthusiasm.  This is a
fascinating subject both from a dharmic and scientific point of view.
(jyotish includes astronomy proper as well as astrology.)  To people who
willingly choose to remain ignorant, all I can say is you are missing out.

One of the longtime wishes for our website is an online panchanga.  It's a
project I've been working on when time permits which is not very often but
in recent weeks I've been making progress.  Yes it's hard. Jyotish like
any discipline has its own methods and technical jargon which is hard for
the layman to penetrate.  Luckily my father knows a good deal about such
things and has been able to help me out.
