That the end of the kali yuga should fall precisely on the
christian era of the year 2000 seems far too much of
a cooincidence; I'm not suggesting a mystical link
but rather that such nicely rounded numbers are a bit
suspicious to me.

Indeed, the roundedness of the yuga numbers on *exact*
multiples of 10 in relation to the christian calender
is by itself wierd enough to arouse suspicion in me!

My guess is that some fiddling of the numbers has crept in,
probably in recent decades or centuries.

(Even if we posit some mystical connection, we are left with
the absurdity that those very christian era year numbers
are not guaranteed to be accurate; the precise year of
the birth of christ is by no means known).
