Namaste,

vRtra was the Asura killed by Indra using vajra. This event
is celebrated in the Rg veda. It has been pointed out that vRtra
is the name for the glaciers of the last ice age. (I have seen this
mentioned by David Frawley.)

A probable account of what happened ...

vRtra, had covered vast regions of the Earth, especially those at high
altitudes. (The name vRtra means one which covers). As a consequence of
the large quantity of water being trapped in the glaciers (vRtra), the
rainfall had dramatically reduced and draught like conditions prevailed all
over the Earth. Indra took upon himself to restore the rains. He performed
severe yoga sAdhanA to gain control over the clouds, in particular, the
lightening. On acquiring this power, he set out to conquer vRtra. Using his
yogic powers he amassed clouds and showered lightening on vRtra, breaking
the glaciers into pieces. This released water that in turn fed the clouds
and helped Indra generate more lightening. Using this strategy repeatedly
he broke up most of the glaciers on the Earth, ending the ice age.

Best regards
Shrinivas Gadkari
