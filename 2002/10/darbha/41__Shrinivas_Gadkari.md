Namaste,

A quick search on the translation of the Rg veda that I have
gave me about 350 references to vRtra ! One would consider even
a single reference in the Rg veda significant. Clearly this slaying
of vRtra was an event of great importance for the Rg vedic seers.
I would be surprised to learn that some petty fight has been glorified
to such an extent in the Rg veda.

Regards
Shrinivas
