As pointed out by Sri Jaladhar in the Other thread
"Indra and Vrtra" as follows:
"The source for the above story is Bhagavata
Mahapurana 6th skandha,
chapters 7-13.  Chapters 14-17 tell of the previous
life of Vrtra as a
king called Chitraketu. This story may explain the
reasons, and why Vishnu Bhagavan helped Indra in this
process. I will write in another post, the comments as
given in the Devi Bhagavatam.

Om Namo Narayanaya !!

Srikrishna
