This is an interesting question. But, I do not know if
there is any subtle meaning for all the accounts of
the Purana apart from being accounts of the past.

I forget now, there is some background for this Vritra
also in his previous births. I will read that portion
and also the portion I narrated already and come back
to you.

Om Namo Narayanaya !!
