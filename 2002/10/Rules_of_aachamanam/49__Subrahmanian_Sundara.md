The following are the rules that need to be observed while performing
aachamanam:

1.  One should sip water "3" times to perform aachamanam

2.  The amount of water taken for sipping should be only the size of pea.
One should not consume more just because it feels comfortable or quenches
the thirst.

3.  Water that contains foam/bubbles/suds ("nurai" in Tamil) is unfit for
aachamanam.

4.  aachamanam should be performed only with cold water and not with
warm/hot water even if it is uncomfortable to the throat.

5.  Scents/flavors should not be added to the water meant for performing
aachamanam.

6.  aachamanam should be performed only in sitting posture and should not be
done standing.

7.  One should not perform aachamanam facing the south.

8.  aachamanan should not be performed in unclean places.
