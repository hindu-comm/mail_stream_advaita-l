Dear Subramanian,
Thanks for posting this.

I have also read the following in some other book on Sandhyavandanam, and wanted 
to add to your list of instructions on aachamanam:

9. The water sipped should directly fall to the throat and should not
   be tasted in the tongue or teeth.

10. The water should not be sipped by making the labial sound.
