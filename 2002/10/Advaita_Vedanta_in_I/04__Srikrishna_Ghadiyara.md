What makes a 'firm ground' in karma kanda ? Does it include
studying 'mImAmsa' granthas or not ? Does one have to perform agnihotra
and/or different periodic 'yagna/yaga' or not ? Is it sufficient to do
daily sandhya (one time or two times or three times) ?

In an earlier thread Sri Jaladhar has mentioned about 'solid background'
(or similar such words) in Vedanta, and has included study of
prasthAnatrayI and other allied books. Surprisingly, he has not mentioned
studying under the guidance of a 'practicing' srotruia Guru as the basis of
this 'solid background'.

Similarly, what is the acceptable source of learning 'karma kanda' ?

Om Namo Narayanaya !!
