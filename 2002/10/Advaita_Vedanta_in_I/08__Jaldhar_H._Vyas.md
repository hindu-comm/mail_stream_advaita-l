Actually what it sounds like to me is it is the grownups who are in dire
need of education.

That pressure is increasing everywhere in the global middle class.  Wasn't
it just a few months ago Time or Newsweek had a story about how even 9 or
10 year old children in some parts of the US are getting ulcers or nervous
breakdowns due to the high stress in their lives?  Indian parents have to
learn from their western counterparts that ultimately the path they are on
is self-destructive.

Learning should be fun and for its own sake not some certificate.  How can
we convince the yuppies about this?  I don't think we can.  I think the
system is beyond repair and we should provide alternatives and just let it
crash and burn on its' own.

TV?  Bedtime stories?  The internet?  I don't know.  Parental involvement
is the key that much is for sure.

I agree that most middle-class Indians have a poor grasp of history.  The
reason is it is so politicized.  In Gujarat (which is BJP controlled)
there is plenty in history books about glorious ancient India but info
about Muslim or British India is minimized.  That's why I'm against
getting politicians involved.

It wouldn't be out of place.  *If* it actually happens.  That's what I'm
skeptical about.  If the teachers are capable, why aren't they doing it
already?

We can keep patching up the holes in this leaky ship or we can invest the
energy and effort into a new ship.

Nothing is wrong.  One should just not pin hopes on schools while ignoring
other perhaps more viable (or at least tractable) sources of motivation.
