Subject: Re: Advaita Vedanta in Indian Schools

A child first begins school at home, with the elders in the
family acting as teachers. If an interest into a particular way
of thinking (religion/culture included) is not kindled at this stage,
chances are that the child won't bother to investigate into it until
he/she becomes an adult.  Sounds hackneyed? May be so.
And once the child begins formal education (and I'm talking about the kind
of formal education that a kid in urban India recieves today --its the
kind that I grew up with in Bangalore), if one is not required to study
something at school, vedanta in this case, then unless one comes from an
'orthodox' family, its likely that one won't take up the study of
vedanta. The extent of work and pressure in school serves as a convenient,
but credible excuse. Also, the disappearance of joint families has meant
that the grandparents (who may be more religiously inclined than the
parents) are not an everyday, direct influence.
This does state a case for including vedanta in formal education, doesn't
it?

How many schools, do you think teach history "the other way?" For
instance, my peers and I studied the "glory of ancient India" for all of
ONE chapter in ONE year of school. (in  10th standard sanskrit course, i

Errr.. how would say, an hour's class on a subject that motivates
reasoning and thinking be out of place then? As you said, there's limited
time .. So do you think there's time outside of school?
see above..

Its not a question of how much it is worth or how much it can achieve. Its
about providing the inputs to people who might otherwise not get it until
much later!

That is exactly what I'm talking about! Whats wrong if schools provide
that motivation?
