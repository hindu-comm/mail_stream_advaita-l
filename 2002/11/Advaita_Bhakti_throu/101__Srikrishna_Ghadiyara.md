Would you please elaborate on :

1. Ekadasi Vratam: I have some doubts on this subject. What is the
prescribed method of observing this Vratam. There is so much of confusion
about the actial times of Ekadasi thithi timings. How is it reckoned for
the observance of this Vratam. Is it to be observed from dawn, even though
the tithi starts later ? or should it be observed strictly as per the tithi
timings. Any other important practical guidelines that should be kept in
mind while observing this Vratam in the present times.

2. More details and comments on Panchayatana puja willbe helpful.

Om Namo Narayanaya !!f
