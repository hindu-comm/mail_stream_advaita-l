Namaste,

First we need to consider how we split vRtra:
vRtra = vR + tra, OR
vRtra = vRt + ra,

(Rt = law of nature)

I am not sure which is the correct split and
more important how to analyze the coppesponding
segments.

KumbakONam (Tamil Nadu) RAjA Patashala is one that I know of, in addition to Kanchipuram and Sringeri Sankara Matams. I'll try to collect some more information on KumbakONam Patashala and pass on.
