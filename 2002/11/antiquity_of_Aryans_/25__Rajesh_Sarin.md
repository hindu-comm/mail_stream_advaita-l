First of all,
Wish you all a very Happy Diwali and a very Prosperous New Year !

I would like to have comments from the learned gathering about
the attached articles. These are downloaded from the internet
and describe the antiquity of Aryans, Vedas, and
contradict the migration theory of Aryans into India !

(See attached file: 1.zip)

thanks - Sarin Rajesh
