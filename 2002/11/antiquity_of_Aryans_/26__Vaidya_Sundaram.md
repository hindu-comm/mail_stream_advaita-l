Namaskaram.
 As interesting as this topic may be for all, I would like to step in here
as a moderator and request that this topic NOT be taken up for discussion. I
feel this is strongly outside the scope of this list. I have had a lot of
discussion on this topic on other forums and I know for sure that there is
no changing of opinions here and will distract the focus of this list.
I hope other list members and moderators agree.

Thanks,
Vaidya.
