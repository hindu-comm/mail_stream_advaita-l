"Masses" are those who can be "lumped" together with
no differentiation for their views and opinions in a
society; those who are not well informed; who do not
have capacity to analyse and arrive at their own
conclusions and implement them. They are essential for
"some" to get best selfish benefits from the society
and its resources.

This is what we are addressing. It is not a matter of
what an individual does. It should be a NORM in the
society that everyone is entitled to the same respect,
opportunity and growth. No group by caste, creed,
money power, connections should scuttle others out of
their priority/opportunity. I am not advocating that
every body should become a priest and preach others.
What I am saying is that the need of a religion is for
a society. Let us not neglect that and treat all
people alike with no-discrimination.

Yes, it is important. But, how large is that society
that I associate. Is it a large enough sample, is the
question.

Immigrants from Gujarat into US are not at any
disadvantage on material pursuits. I am more concerned
about the backward castes and scheduled castes and
tribes of India who live in ignorance of the modern
world and in poverty and filth. They have no
opportunity and say in the society. I studied in a Jr.
college where I had some students from remote tribal
villages. Though I am not a compassionate and
accomodative individual, I know how backward they were
with present day society. I know they have a heart; I
lived with them. These are the people exploited by the
politicians and religious goons.

We are not dumping on Sankaracharyas. But, India is a
society based on Religion, predominantly. I do not
mean to say that they are not doing a great service.
Yes, we are obviously a part in the problem and
solution.

Yes, there are present day teachers who are saying
that the view of the sages of yore is mis-interpreted
now. It seems so, because there is in-human treatment
in the society which all of us do in varying degrees,
including those who advocate for their cause.

It means that all people should have access to food,
health, education, social security, psychological
security for their future and the security of their
children, and live happily. These are same for the
forward comminities as well.  Let the riches of a
nation be diverted to the upliftment of those backward
people. It might sound as a social program than a
religious program. But, we can achieve social
objectives through religion and religious objectives
through social programs. Religious association is an
essential identification for many Indians. Do not
discriminate some people based on narrow notions.

It is not possible for me to exhaust all possibilities
and programs. But, this is enough to say that such
ideas should shape our nation's goals.

Om Namo Narayanaya !!
