Could not but help add reference ... In the book Divine Discourses, HH
Jagadguru Sri Abhinava Vidyatheertha Mahaswamigal gives a maxim / example:

\\quote
ardha.m pAkAyArdha.m prasavaya

A person found an egg and was desirous of waiting for it to hatch and have
the chick. At the same time he did not have the patience to wait and also
wanted to eat the egg. In his mistaken understanding, he thought he will
keep half for hatching and half for eating, approximated, and cut the egg
and ate half of it. The result was that he got no chick, and also ended up
eating half a meal.

Thus, once one takes a text such as the Veda as a Pramana or a valid means
of knowledge, one should accept it in its entirety. Here, one such as the
Buddhist may object, "There are internal contradictions in the Veda and, as
such, it is unacceptable." What superficially appears to be contradictions
are actually not so. They can be fully resolved by means of proper,
interpretative logic. Such logic must be resorted to.

bhava shankara desikame sharaNam
Vaidya.
