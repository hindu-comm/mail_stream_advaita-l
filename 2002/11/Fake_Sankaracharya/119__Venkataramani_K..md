I resonate with this view. Shastras were codified at certain point of time,
probably as a response to social conditions prevailing then. There is no need
to adhere to them today. Many of them are obscurantist and even down right
inhuman. Perhaps they were so even then. Whether or not conversions exist, we
still need to cleanse  Hinduism of some of the evils such as the inequities
mentioned above. No matter how much regard I have for Kanchi Sankara mutt,
some of their practices are casteist and destroy Hinduism from within.
Progressive thinking is not against the tenets of Hinduism; it is not an
obstruction to spiritual progress either.
