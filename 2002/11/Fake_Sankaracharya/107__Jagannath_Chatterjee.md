You are right Aniruddhan when you say that Swami
Nischalananda Saraswati has the habit of making
controversial statements in public. I also hate it
when such revered members of the society enter into
political debates. Politics is no longer what it used
to be and silent teaching through personal example
should be resorted to rather than take part in
irrelvant political controversies.

Another thing I wish to say, and which is sure to
attract flak, is that the Sankaracharyas should take
into consideration the present problems being faced by
the masses in leading a vedic life. Times have changed
and being unnecessarily strict on certain rituals will
keep the masses away from religion in its true sense,
that is the realisation of the Self, or God
realisation however you put it.

I guess I am a bit ambiguous in expressing myself, but
I just wanted to be subtle.

Regards
Jagannath
