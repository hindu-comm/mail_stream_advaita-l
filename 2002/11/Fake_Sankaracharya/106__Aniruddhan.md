This is the same Swami Adhokshajananda. He has been disbarred from going
within a certain distance of the Puri temple and peetham and also from using
the title Shankaracharya (by the Orissa state high court). But still
occasionally the press refers to him as the Puri Shankaracharya. If I
remember right, Swami Nischalananda Saraswati is the true Shankaracharya of
the Puri math. He is also recognised by the other Shankaracharyas. I think
Swami Nischalananda Saraswati has made some controversial statements about
the caste system etc and is not liked by the secular parties. Swami
Adhokshajananda is supported by the non-hindu religious organisations.
