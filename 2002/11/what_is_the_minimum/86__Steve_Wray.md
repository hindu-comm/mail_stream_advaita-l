Thanks, this is a really interesting reply,
but I wonder if it would be possible to give
a translation of some of the terms used?

I'll point out some of the areas of particular
interest to me among the quoting with some snipping;

I have studied the Chinese philosophy/religion Taoism and
so far as I can tell, the concepts of Tao and Dharma are
very closely related.

I'd be interested in comments on this connection from other
members of the list!

Please translate "vaidika karma maarga"
Thanks!
