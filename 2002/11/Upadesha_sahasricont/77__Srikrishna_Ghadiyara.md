It is such a coincidence that just today a colleague handed this same book to me for reading!
Also I happend to read "Underworld " by Graham recently. Very good read.
Could you please provide details on Vedic Physics?

I was just referred to a book that would seem to completely turn on it's
head our understanding of world history - atleast to me. The book is called
"Fingerprints of the Gods" by Graham Hancock. I have not finished it yet,
but once I start reading it, it is hard to put down again!
The reason I refer to that here in this thread, is because of the reference
to the discussion of ice ages and the previous civilizations. The
introductory chapters of this book discusses maps produced in the medival
world, which by all recognized standards today are authentic. These maps
(proclaiming be copies of even older maps) clearly show in great detail a
land which had at that time (early 1500's) not yet been discovered. That
land is shown with it's mountains, rivers and other features with great
accuracy of longitude and lattitude. That land mass was later discoverd and
is the present day antartica. What is amazing is that these maps show the
"sub glacial" topography of the region! This is very indicative of a period
when that region of our globe was not under the ice caps' but also
indicative of a culture that had precise map making techniques including the
mathematics to do this. There is a lot more such history presented in the
book - true, one has to take it with a pinch (or more!) or salt, but ...
All I wish to say here is that one must not jump to conclusion that the ice
ages forming or breaking down are referred to as such in the vedas albeit in
the form of puranic stories of battle between two forces of nature ... May
be it does, but may be it refers to a real event of a battle between two
individuals too!
On a tangential note, if you wish to try and correlate the vedic statements
(or some of those) to present day scientific analysis, I would also suggest
a book called Vedic Physics (which I have not finished either!:)) - it comes
highly recommened to me as well ...

Dear all,

I have read extensively on these subjects at one time.
I particularly liked the books by Fritzof Capra on the
interrelationships between modern physics and
spirituality. But we have known this all along haven't
we?

Our puranic stories are allegorical references both to
our inner lives as well as the external universe. It
reminds me of the old indian saying "the microcosm
reflects the macrocosm" and vice versa.

Our forefathers were extremely intelligent beings who
had mastered all sciences, secular and religious. I
really wonder about the degeneration which set in
afterwards. Perhaps it was due to some cataclysm which
destroyed or displaced an entire race.

Regards
Jagannath
