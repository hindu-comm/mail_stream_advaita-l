Because there is (apparently) more than one jiva.  If we say the jiva is
brahman does that mean Shrikrishna is Brahman or Jaldhar is Brahman?

Of course te real answer is both (and many more) are Brahman and the
concept that its is ones own self is Brahman is only provisional, a useful
meditation because it is ones' own self that one is most familiar with.

It isn't.  The novice approaches "I am Brahman" under the mistaken idea
that "I" is known and "Brahman" is unknown but leaves thinking Brahman is
known and I is unknown.
