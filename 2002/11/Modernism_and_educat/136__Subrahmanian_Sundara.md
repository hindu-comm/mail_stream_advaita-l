There is a book called "Hindu Samskaras" by Rajbali Pandey.  If you get your
hands on it, please do give it a reading.  The book is the outcome of a PhD
thesis by the author submitted in the late 30's.  One problem with that book
is that it assumes Aryan Immigration which was a popular belief then.  But
if we were to discard references to it, and just look at the rest of the
text, the author argues (though that it is not the intent of the book) that
there has been an evolution in customs and that the different sutras show an
evolution in their precepts.  He has substantiated all his writings with
adequate quotations with exact numbers from all the sutras and Rg and
Atharva Veda.
