        Introduction
To the blessed Self,
                     May the blessings of  Sri Sankara be ever upon you
for supreme happiness. This is Murugaiah (Tamil Nadu) from Sweden, a
follower of Swami Sivananda and Kanchi Math.
                      Thank you for including the list.
                      Let auspiciousness be ever upon thee!
At the service of Gurudev,
