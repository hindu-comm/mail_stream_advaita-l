Namaskaram.
 You can find these in the archives. Visit the www.advaita-vedanta.org web
site and follow the links to the archives ... 99% of these would be with the
subject of New member introduction. Please bear in mind that several of the
list members today have been members for all the time the list has been in
place. So, there may be more mature people today than the intro's would have
you believe :)

Also, I would request all new list members to peruse the archives to see
what discussions have taken place in the past and the different sides of the
argument. it would be enlightening in my opinion and would save this list
from repeatedly arguing the same things with the same pro's and con's
regurgitated. I think that this is the reason that when our acharyas
commented on the different bhashyams they also present the purva paksha
arguments and refute them etc.
