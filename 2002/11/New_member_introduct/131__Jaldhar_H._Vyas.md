hi,

Iam a student of Visishtadvaitha. It is said that one
needs an understanding of advaitha to do justice to
the former.Hence my interest in advaitha.So much for
my philosophical interest.. Iam also an engineering
student at IIT bombay well into my final yr currently.

Hi Venkat,

It delights us when young people like you take
interest in our scriptures and try to strengthen their
spiritual base. You are on the right path. Our
blessings and welcome to this forum.
