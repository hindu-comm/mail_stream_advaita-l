People are free to interpret the way they like 'in the 21
st century'. Then why perform the 'yajan' of
pre-modern world ? and then take the burden of finding
whether the 'modern' Brahmana should officiate the
'old' yajna ? Let the modern Brahmana's perform
'modern' Yaj~na as accepted by the 21 st century
society and leave the old Yaj~na to old definition Brahmana.

Om Namo Narayanaya !!
