For people like me, who joined later,
IS IT POSSIBLE TO HAVE INTRODUCTION OF
THE PROFILES OF the eminent MEMBERS OF THIS GROUP
& ALSO OF THE PROFILES OF THE LIST MODERATORS !

If these are circulated, it is quite interesting to know, whom
you are talking to !

Alternatively, if these are stored at web-site, please send me
the link !

regards - Sarin Rajesh
