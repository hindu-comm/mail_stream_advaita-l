Another point that occurs to me now, in response to the
validation point is that I wasn't referring to any *need*
for validation; just because something *can* be validated
doesn't mean that it *needs* it.

Validation should in this instance at least, be seen as
a relative matter not absolute; within the context and
traditions of the Vedas, there is no need for scientific
validation just as within science there is no need for
Vedantic validation.

However, when we wish to bring together diverse branches
of knowledge and experience there is always need for
common ground to be established, and it is in this context
that I intended the term 'validation'
