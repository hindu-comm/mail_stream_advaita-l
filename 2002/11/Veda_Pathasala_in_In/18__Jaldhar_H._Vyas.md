I hope I didn't overstate the case about culture shock.  In the end it
depends on the pyschological makeup of an individual.  It is just
something to bear in mind that's all.

Hopefully there will be many more exceptions in the future as India slowly
extricates itself from the colonial mentality.

India is definitely the superior choice if it can be managed.  Here in the
US it is possible to study (I know, I did it.) but it is more
hit-and-miss.

Thankyou!  I am truly blessed to know people like you.  Our gotra is
Bharadwaja and the sutra is Katyayana.  Shailajas' birth nakshatra is
Shatatara.

This also seems quite interesting.

...this however is unsuitable.  The Arya Samaja are nastikas.

Then this is no good either.  One should not settle for less than the best
in any field of life particularly this one.

It's not that I'm against all innovation altogether but it must not come
at the expense of the highest standards set by our ancestors.  If one aims
for mediocrity will it be surprising if all one ends up with is
mediocrity?
