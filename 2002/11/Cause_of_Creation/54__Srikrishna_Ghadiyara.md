Yes, TU is describing the happiness of a human being
with that of the Devas and Prajapathi and a Brahma
J~nani. If the Upanishad was merely describing only
human ananda, then we can say it is already known to
us. But, at this juncture we do not know how blissful
is 'Brahmananda'. So, sruthi is describing the
manushya ananda (known to us) with deva ananda
etc.(unknown to us).

Om Namo Narayanaya !!
