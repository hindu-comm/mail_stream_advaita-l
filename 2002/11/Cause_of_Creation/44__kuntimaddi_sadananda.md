Vidya you are right. My statement comes from my scientific background
of citation of the references rather than validation as a pramaaNa.
If non-negatable knowledge is pramaa, and when it comes to shabda
that which cannot be independently at least confirmed, can be
questionable at best if it is a valid pramaaNa. Of course, I agree
with you (in principle) since that part is not included in the
definition of a pramaaNa.

 Brahman not being upaadana karaana still remains as part of the
dvaita theory, though.

Sadananda
