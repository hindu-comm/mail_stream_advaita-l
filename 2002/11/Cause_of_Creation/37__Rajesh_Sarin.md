if we look at it in a broader sense, the Purana for the concerned God
believes that the
particular God is form of the Omnipresent Single Entity and it is this
Omnipresent Single Entity
who creates everything - Purana name this entity as MahaGanesha for Ganesh
Purana, AdiShiva for
Shiva purana, MahaVishnu for Vishnu purana, Maha Shakti or Adi Shakti etc.

Later on in these Puranas, the respective Gods take Avtar as Ganesha,
Shankara, Vishnu, Durga, etc.

Hence, in brief, since the Omnipresent God is only one and he takes various
manifestations at different
times, the puranas describe the creator accordingly !

Correct me if I am wrong !

Hi Everyone,

I have something to add insupport of this question. Many puranas explain
the process of creation of this universe. For example the Bhagavatam
explains that Brama was createdby vishnu. Other puranas extoll the deity
concerned and puts forth that this universe was created by that deity and
that deity is supreme. Shiva purana states shiva created this universe and
he is supreme (i have't read this purana but for small snipets), elsewhere
it is stated that Goddess shakti creates everyone (Brahma vishnu shiva),
Ganesha purana states Ganesha created everyone, similarly other puranas .

In reality only one of these can be true (how can all the statements can be
true), thenon the other hand if one is true then others become false,
propogating wrong thories. This make us to loose faith in the puranic
scriptures.

Can anyone please explain this inconsistanciesbetween the puranas. It
would be of great help in understanding things clearly.

regards

prakash

I am interested in knowing what the dvaitins and visishtadvaitins postulate
as the cause of creation. Any pointers or brief writeups would greatly
help.
Thanks in advance.

It is the Brahman, with its power of Maya, that appears in the disguise of
creation. For the potter who is the Paramatman there is no other entity
other than himself called clay. So the arambha-vada is not right. To say
that Paramatman transformed himself into t he cosmos is like saying that
the
milk turns into curd. The curd is not the same as the milk. Would it not be
wrong to state that the Paramatman became non-existent after becoming the
cosmos? So the parinama-vada is also not valid. On the one hand, the
Paramatman remains pure jnana, as nothing but awareness, and, on the other,
he shows himself through the power of his Maya as all this universe with
its
living-beings and its inert objects. It is all the appearence of the same
Reality, the Reality in various disguises. If a man dons a disguise he does
not become another man. Similar is the case with all these disguises, all

This argument is known as "vivarta-vada".

The rope does not transform itself into a snake; but on account of our
nescience (avidya) it seems to us to be a snake. Similarly, on account of
our ajnana or avidya the Brahman too seems to us as this world and such a
vast plurality of entities.
