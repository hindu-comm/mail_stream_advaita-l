The verse "ekam eva advitiyam brahma" of Chandogya is very pertinent in this
case.  Brahman is said to be both single and non-dual.  Something could be
non-dual, but may be part of a set of such elements.  "single" takes care of
it.  Being single does not preclude that it has parts. "Non-dual" takes care
of it.  Single and Non-Dual are essential to complete the definition.

By completeness, the main idea is that there is no "other".

Swami Dayananda Sarasvati says:
Advaitins don't say:  There is ONLY ONE God.
Advaitins instead say:  There is ONLY God.

My 2c worth.
