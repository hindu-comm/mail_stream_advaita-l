It is true that Madhva refers to texts that are totally unknown to others.
However, your last sentence about the validity of a pramANa is not
correct.

Generally speaking, it is quite possible that texts are lost over a period
of time. The fact that one is unable, at a particular time and a
particular place, to check the said text(s) does not take away from or add
to validity per se. Given that the charge of making up quotations from
possibly non-existent texts has been laid at Madhva's door for a long time
now, it is enough to state that the said texts are not part of shAstra. We
do not have to come up with a new criterion for validity, namely one's
ability to cross-check the reference.
