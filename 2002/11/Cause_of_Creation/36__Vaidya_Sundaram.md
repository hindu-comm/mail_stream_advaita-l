Namaskaram.
 I am interested in knowing what the dvaitins and visishtadvaitins postulate
as the cause of creation. Any pointers or brief writeups would greatly help.
Thanks in advance.

The rope does not transform itself into a snake; but on account of our
nescience (avidya) it seems to us to be a snake. Similarly, on account of
our ajnana or avidya the Brahman too seems to us as this world and such a
vast plurality of entities.

Hi Everyone,
I have something to add in support of this question. Many puranas explain the process of creation of this universe. For example the Bhagavatam explains that Brama was created by vishnu. Other puranas extoll the deity concerned and puts forth that this universe was created by that deity and that deity is supreme. Shiva purana states shiva created this universe and he is supreme (i have't read this purana but for small snipets), elsewhere it is stated that Goddess shakti creates everyone (Brahma vishnu shiva), Ganesha purana states Ganesha created everyone, similarly other puranas .
In reality only one of these can be true (how can all the statements can be true), then on the other hand if one is true then others become false, propogating wrong thories. This make us to loose faith in the puranic scriptures.
Can anyone please explain this inconsistancies between the puranas. It would be of great help in understanding things clearly.
regards
prakash
