Just wondering -- when Sri Sankara cites the unavailable bAshhkala text
`avachanenaiva provAcha', etc. (see his BSB 3.3.17-18), would you reject
his notion that the Brahman is beyond words, because his authority on the
subject cannot be found?

As a follow-up to this, would you clarify what efforts you have made to
find such critical references, or else on whose authority you are saying
that they cannot be found?

Actually, both readings are granted to be valid, and there are several
dualistic meanings given with `tat' as well.  The issue here is also both
the number of times that instruction is given in the CU, as well as the
accompanying illustrations -- `yathA pakShI sutreNa prabaddho dishaM
dishaM patitvA anyatra AyatanaM alabdhvA bandhamevopAshrayate, sanmUlAH
somya imAH sarvAH prajAH sadAyatanAH satpratishhThAH', etc. (just as a
bird, bound by a cord, having tried in vain to flee in various directions,
ultimately seeks refuge in that to which it is bound, so also, my dear,
all these beings are based in `sat', are supported by `sat', and are
situated in `sat').

Not one of the nine illustrations meant to explain the critical text
conveys Advaita, as accepted explicitly by Vachaspati Mishra, and not
disputed by Madhusudana Saraswati (whose solution to the problem is to
say that the illustrations have no correlation with the text).

But then again, if the Brahman is the upAdAna-kAraNa (as the clay is to
the pot) of the world as well, the world as a whole would become real as
well, destroying the concept that the Brahman alone is real while the
perceived world is not.

The TU is not describing the state of samsAra, based on your own (quite
correct) perspective that the merely obvious is not the subject of Shruti.

It is not that; rather, the Vedas are stated to be of unified purport
(vide `sarve vedA yatpadaM Amananti', `vedaishcha sarvairahameva vedyo',
etc.).  There is no "primary emphasis" or "secondary emphasis" as you
suggest (which is in fact the view of the Advaitic tradition).
