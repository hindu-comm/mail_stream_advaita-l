Namaskaram.
 I know some of these questions have come up before, but I don't remember
seeing any specific answer. I would appreciate if members could point me in
the right direction.

On a tangential note, does advaita say the individual upon full
"illumination" become Ishwara Himself? Or does it even matter? That is to
say, does this question even arise in advaita? The way I see it explained in
advaita, when the individual is freed from the cluthes of ignorance, and the
body of such a one is dissolved as well, then it is only us, or the people
who continue to remain in the vyavahaaric sense, who see the loss right? The
sum total Brahman remaining the same, the individual we see having
enlightened himself just goes back to the larger pool, sort of like a water
droplet being assimilated back into the ocean ... so, it is immaterial
whether the enlightened one actually also has the power of creation as well
right?
Is this thinking correct?

I am still not clear. If statement like "yadA hyEvaiSha
yEtasminnudaramantaram kurutE adha tasya bhayam bhavati ( Tai - A - 7 )"
applies to all, then it must apply to visishtadvaita (as much as dvaita) as
well right? If there are intrinsice differences, does it still not engender
a sense of fear ...? How then is the visishtadvaitic position tenable?

Again, I would like some clarifications in the following context: I have
heard some discoursers give the analogy of a spider spinning a web out of
its own self and then withdrawing the same into itself. Yet, in the case of
the Creator (Ishawara?), there is no grwoing smaller or growing bigger as a
result of this "willful act of creation" - does this analogy apply more to
visishtadvaita than to advaita per se? Or does it apply equally the same to
both?

Is this the same thing as Poornamadah Poornamidam Poornaad Poornamudachyate;
Poornasya Poornamaadaaya Poornamevaavashisyate ?? The infinite remains the
same whether we take infinity away from it or put infinity into it? Given
this statement, the statement brahmavit brahma eva bhavati is simply a
logical conclusion right?

thanks for your patient explanations.
