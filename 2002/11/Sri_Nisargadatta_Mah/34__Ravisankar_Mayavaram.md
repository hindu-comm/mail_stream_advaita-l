A very good observation. If the prerequisites you mention are not met, then
Nisargadatta's words could be utterly misleading/confusing.

I agree with you that every chapter of "I am That" has beautiful jewels
which are worth contemplating upon. And even through the translation, force
of his words hits you right out of the book. Authority of his realization
is undeniable.
