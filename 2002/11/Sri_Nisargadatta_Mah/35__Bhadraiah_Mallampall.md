My apologies if my previous postings were understood as pointing to any
defects in the path offered by Maharaj.

1. The highest human goal of attaining non-duality is common to all
approaches.

2. Downfall is possible in traditional approach also!

The only difference is, traditional approach offers two extra safety nets
between 1 & 2 above in the form of devayaan maarga and pitRyaana maarga.

Best regards
Bhadraiah
