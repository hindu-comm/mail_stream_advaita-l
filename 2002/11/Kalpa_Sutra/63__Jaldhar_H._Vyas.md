Apastambha Grhya sutra (and a couple of others) was translated a long time
ago as part of the Sacred Books of the East series.  Motilal Banarsidass
has reprinted this a couple of times.  There may be others.

However, those translations aren't worth a lot because to actually use the
grhyasutras practically you need the prayogas.
