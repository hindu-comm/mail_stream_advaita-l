I understand the spirit of your suggestion, but my point is that follwing
dharma is not the same as asking people to take up arms, be they guns, or
just stones.

Wonderful. Thanks for bringing up this analogy. This analogy exactly
supports my point of view. Different people need different observances
(karma and rituals) in our daily life and one single type of "universal"
observance will not be fit for all. The child who is recuperating may want
to jump up and play in the hot sun, but the mother knows that it will take
him some more time to get there right? Is there ever a question in this
whole matter as to why the mother prescribes a different regimen for her
sick children? Is it not because she does not want her sick children to
continue remaining so?

Why do we want to "universalize" and "standardize" rituals? When we cannot
do it our mundane life for mundane events, how can we say that sipirtual
life is any less important?

It is not discouraging, but encouraging that I want to do. I don't want
anyone to stop paying attention, I just want people to pay closer attention
to details. The "deveil" as they say, is in the details! :)

Precisely. As yiou observed earlier, the same food is not served for all.
Just because a certain person is not allowed to chant the gayathri, it does
not mean thtat person is left high and dry. Every one is society cannot be
doctors, and engineerings and teachers etc. Each "role" requires
"certification" and the person in that role alone would be permitted to "act
out" the "responsibilites" of that "role". I may know all the stuff a high
school maths teacher teaches, I will still as a "rule" be "chastised" if I
were to just start doing it. I need permission.

And what makes you think I am discriminating? Take for example the debate in
the American society about the use of so-called "growth harmones" that is
"meant and designed" for people who exhibit "midget" like symptoms. A
"regular" child is not and should not be allowed that same growth harmones.
This is definitely NOT discrimination. Why is that so hard to understand?

Please refer arguments by HH Jagadguru Sri Abhinava Vidyatheertha
Mahaswamigal, where he quotes a real debate (vidwat sadas) incidence (and I
only paraphrase here) - a person goes up on stage and narrates the story of
a deeply religious person praying to Lord Shiva every day, and offers a bowl
of milk to Him, and eats that alone in the evening and goes to sleep. This
routine goes on every day. One day, while the devotee is busy doing other
things, a snake sips the milk and spits its poisonus venom in the milk. The
devotee without knowing this offers this to the lord, then drinks it and
goes to sleep. The next morning he wakes up hale and healthy, while the idol
of the Lord is broken. This argument was made that if there is devotion,
then God will take care of it. The counter to this argument by HH (and I
quote from the book Divine Discourse here) \\quote On hearing the story, I
told the narrator, "Please do not say such things. Many children are present
in the audience. They may offer some milk to God even if happens to be
contaminated and, influenced by your story, may casually drink it, expecting
to remain unaffected. Do not take responsibility for such disasters. All
that you have said pertains to "Bhakthudreka" or extreme devotion. When it
is there, extraordinary acts, such as the eating of poisoned food, may be
carried out. But the normal situation is different. It is necessary to keep
the competence of the hearer in mind".  adhikaariNamaashaaste

Does it not automatically imply first going through the karma kanda? Why do
we want to jump 200 meters in one jump when we are still a toddler?

> It is the vedas but it goes beyond it.

Yes. You are right. It is the Vedas that goes beyond it. **Not** the
individual.

Yes. That is exactly why I am belabouring this point. Do you at all see the
point of view I am trying to present. Lets please be cognizant of the facts
of hinduism before we prescribe a "universal" religion. Karma marga is
definitely universal. It **does not** mean that one size fits all. All our
discussion is shown up on the web as well for future generations to come and
see what disccuions happen. Lets please have a correct understanidng and
position laid out. Our conscience cannot and must not substitute for vedic
utterances. We are not talking poetry or history here. We are discussing
about a realm that cannot be percevied by our senses or reasoning etc. The
Vedas are the only pramaNa we have to say that there is a next life and that
there are consequences for all out actions. There will only be chaos if we
do away with the rule of Law.

Yes. Please, let us all go forward and teach people the correct
understanding. I take as correct only that which our great acharyas have
sanctioned.

If you think our forefathers were wonderful in formulating this science,
please show me how that goes against my argument.
