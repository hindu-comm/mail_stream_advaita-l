namaste,

There is also the interesting case of brahmanas with their gotra as
Kaushika. Kaushika was the name of Rishi Vishwamitra when he was a king and
therefore a kshatriya. Maybe this Kaushika was a different Rishi? Also,
assuming varna is not changeable, was Rishi Vishwamitra still a kshatriya
after becoming a Rishi? In that case, the Vishwamitra gotra among brahmanas
is also an anomaly.
