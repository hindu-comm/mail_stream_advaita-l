Do we need to know/tell Sutra for offering puja in a
temple ?

What is the origin, meaning, purpose, and practical
aspects of Gotram, Sutra, and Veda pertaining to an
individual ?

Also when we say Sutra, does it refer to Srauta Sutra
or Gruhya Sutra ? Is there a one-to-one correspondence
between Gotra and Sutra ? What is the basis of
assigning/following one specific Sutra by an
individual ?

Om Namo Narayanaya !!

Srikrishna
