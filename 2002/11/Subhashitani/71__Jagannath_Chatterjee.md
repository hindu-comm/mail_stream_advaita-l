Dear Srikrishna,

You're perfectly right when you say that children must
observe there parents doing regular japa, meditation
and worship. This is extremely important. One should
be very careful about what one does or speaks in front
of children. They feel and understand much more than
what we imagine about them. The child can also catch
the subtle undercurrents of tension in the household.

The shastras speak of sadhusanga. At this early age it
is the parents who should provide that sadhusanga.

As a practitioner of alternative medicine I would also
recommend that small children not be over exposed to
allopathy which takes to consideration only the
physical ramifications of illness and thus destroys
the satwic qualities of the mind.

Regards
Jagannath
