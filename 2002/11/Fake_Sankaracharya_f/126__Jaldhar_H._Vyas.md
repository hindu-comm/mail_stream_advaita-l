First of all I do not believe in "masses"  This is a condescending
and elitist leftist term.  There are all kinds of people and lumping them
altogether into an undifferentiated lump will not lead to any useful
insight.

And most people do have practical problems yes but they get on with it
and make do the best they can.  It is only a certain type who will just
agonize and wring their hands about how hard life is.

Of course!

Shouldn't one be a social scientist by the mere fact of living in society.
I try to be a keen observer of the life around me.  I think it should be
fairly obvious whether people are having problems or not.

Ones own eyes and ears?

Most of the people I associate with on a day to day basis are recent
immigrants from Gujarat.  Typically they are not scholars or well to do.
They don't know English that well and don't have professional jobs.
They do factory work or are shopkeepers or do other menial labor.  Yet
they have a fervor to practice Dharma to the best of their ability which
is awe-inspiring.  And many of their children despite being born in
America are equally devout.  And I know assimiliated atheists too.  In
India also my firends and relatives run the gamut from sophisticated
urbanites to villagers.

So yes I'm well aware of the realities in my community.

Why dump it all on the Shankaracharyas?  The state of society is our
problem and responsibility as much as theirs.

I am a partisan of the path our Sages have set for us since time
immemorial.  I want nothing more and nothing less.  And I refuse to be
hijacked by politicians of either the left or the right.

The point is we cannot fall prey to a nostalgia for some lost Golden Age
when everything was easy.  Even during Rama Rajya there was a Ravana.
In the old days, life was easy in some ways and hard in others.  Today
life is easy in some ways and hard in others.  We are not prisoners of
time. _We_ make it. _We_ change it.

Oh  I understand.  I don't think it is relevant.  And the suggested
solution (watering down the content of rituals etc.) has already been
proven a failure as 200 years of "Modern" Hinduism demonstrates.

It's a nice slogan but what does it mean in practice?
