Namaste
I am continuing Jaldhar vyasji's account.
The Ekadasi vratam comes to a close  the next morning when  dvadasi comes
(that is, the 12th day of the lunar fortnight). There is a famous story
from mythology on the observance of the edadasi-dvadasi vratam. The story
is about King Ambarisha, a great devotee of the Lord. It throws light on
the importance that is attached to the vrata and also the power of staunch
devotees even over the power of great rishis. For the full story and the
lesson to be learnt, see

under the title 'A dose of mythology - The Devotee calls the tune'.

praNAms to all seekers of spirituality.
