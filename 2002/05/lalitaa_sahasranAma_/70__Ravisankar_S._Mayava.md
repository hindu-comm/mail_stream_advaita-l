There are few errors in the way above is written. Second line should
read as

naavidyaavedine bruuyannaabhaktaaya kadaachana ||

Since I am basing my translation what is given in ananthakrishna
shaastry's I do not want get into details. Simply because, I know very
little sanskrit and I will have to spend (typically) a lot of time on
this. Yet, my take on the second line is

vidyaa avedinaH na bruuyaat, abhaktaaya na bruuyaat.

Please do correct. Despite my intention of not getting  into such
details, I ended up thinking about this for half an hour, early in the
morning.
