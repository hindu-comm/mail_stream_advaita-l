verse 81

iti te kathitam stotram rahasyam kumbhasambhava |
naa vidyaa vedino bruuyaat naa bhaktaaya kadaachana ||

Thus the stotram told to you, O agastya is a secret. It should not be
told at any time, to one who does not know Srividya and one is who is
not a bhakta.

Notes:

1. agastya is known as kumbha-sambhava or pot-born (see message 241)
http://groups.yahoo.com/group/ambaa-l/message/241

2. Material available in puraaNa is open to all. Then how to regard the
word "rahasyam" that is secret? Is is artha-vAda? That is
result-oriented-approach. When you say something is a secret, people
will take it seriously. Or it means, not to make it public more than
what it is. That is not to publish translations, release audio
cassettes, make it availabe easily to all. In the past, all these
things were learned only from a guru. Only when printing press (later
www) became common place thing, people started learning things on their
own.


3. What does "one who knows Srividya" mean? Does it mean one who is
initated to it or a mere sAmanya knowledge. trishati defines what it
considers as knowing Srividya, is it something like that. Safest
translation is one who is initiated to SriVidya and one who understands
it.

4. On whom is the restriction placed? On the teacher/guru. It is
his/her responsibility who he/she should allow to learn and chant. This
will become even more clear later.
