Namaste Vidyasankar,

Actually I was hoping to get more insight than just the
meaning of words hence felt this list is a good place to
post such questions.

I guess, I asked for too many words. Here I will again
initiate a similar exercise with just one word.

Take the Shri: Sh + r + I
Shri generally means anything that gladdens the heart.

Now what does Sh-kAra represent and why ?
What does r-kAra represent and why ?
What does I-kAara represent and why ?

I mean there must be something very basic about sounds
here.

Comments from list members are invited.

Regards
Shrinivas Gadkari
