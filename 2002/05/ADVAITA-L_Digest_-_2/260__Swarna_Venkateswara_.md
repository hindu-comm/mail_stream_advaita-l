Dear friend,

I read with interest your mail to your friend Somik,
but posted to Advaita-list. I would like to respond.

By birth one is placed in a specific environment. But
in the case of 'dwijas', i.e. twice born, the children
were seated separately from the adults, who were
supposed to perform Sandhya Vandana etc., and can't
eat food unless prepared with Body and Mind purity.

So the custom spread to temples also, of which you
wrote. It is true that many of those brahmins do not
perform proper rites to be qualified to be called
brahmins. Many of the modern brahmins, don't bother to
sit and eat that simple food at all.

One more reason behind that custom is that those who
are straying from the path of a true brahmin will
probably get inspired to mend their ways after seeing
the others and eating in that 'holy' atmosphere.

as u have rightly mentioned, there is no question of
supremacy of any one caste over another. but the
thinkers always enjoyed superiority over the workers
in all societies and india was no exception. the
brahmins were the thinkers, that's all.

regards.
