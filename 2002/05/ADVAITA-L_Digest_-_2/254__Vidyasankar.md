Yes, I think. I can't claim to have an exhaustive knowledge of the texts,
but my feeling is that you will find nothing very pro-Jyotisha or anti-
Jyotisha in the Advaita philosophical texts.

It is not clear what your question really is. It would be helpful if it
were posed more precisely.

If you are asking about the performance of rituals prescribed by an
astrologer to ward off the effects of some dosha in a horoscope, then the
ultimate answer is simple. All such rituals fall under the category of what
is kAmya karma, or rituals undertaken with a specific desire in mind. If
one desires to do the ritual for whatever reason, then yes, one can do it.

One can be a ritualist and still opt not to do kAmya karma, because one
might want to avoid doing anything other than nitya karma (enjoined daily
ritual) and naimittika karma (occasional ritual). One can then decide to go
ahead and face life, with all the astrological pluses and minuses that the
astrologers talk about.

Advaita philosophy does not enter into the picture at all, except if one
wishes to transcend desires. Note that the goal must then be to go beyond
all desires, not just one or two specific ones. Now this is a little too
tough for most of us!
