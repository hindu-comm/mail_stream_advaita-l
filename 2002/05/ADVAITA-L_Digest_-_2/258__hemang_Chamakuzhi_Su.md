        How is a person identified with his Caste?  In todays
world everything goes by the origin/father's descent not even the
mother's descent. Why is this so?
        the Gita states nothing about descent and differentiates
based on the kind of work we do.. Don't the modern day Software
engineers fit into the Workers category..as we server somebody for
our living and hence become shudras. The modern day entreuprenuer
the "Vaishya" as he makes money by doing business and the modern
day "soldier" the Kshatriya..It is only the professor/teachers who
can be called the Brahmin's as they are the givers of the
knowledge.

      Could someone throw light on this topic of our modern day
duties in relation with the Caste system..as against our
descent/family traditions of casteism..which is taken at face
value...

  Is there any other work that says otherwise...or proves this
modern day following of CASTE identification by birth..
