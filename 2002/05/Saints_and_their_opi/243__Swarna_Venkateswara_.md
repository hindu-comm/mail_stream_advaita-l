Dear Shri Anand,

On one hand you describe the Saints as Brahmajnanis
and then question their knowledge of Sastras! They
have reached the position or goal, for which the
sastras are but the means. so they certainly are in a
position to guide. and the devotees who go them and
ask questions, in preference to mere scholars, are
certainly spiritually advanced.
