Namaste Kartik,

I quote from my earlier response:

"It is like this: you dwell in your inherent nature of bliss, due to
your own impulse you desire to witness duality, by your maya shakti
you project some images and experience them, in the process generate
karma, and modify the images as per the karma, always resting in
bliss intermittently.

Now depending on what state you are in you use a different label
describe yourself: Brahman, Ishvara, Jiva etc"

>From the view point of the witness, yes, there is no bondage,
no struggle for liberation, ....

Totally agree, but make sure you do not apply the description of
the sakshi to the jiva.

Regards
Shrinivas
