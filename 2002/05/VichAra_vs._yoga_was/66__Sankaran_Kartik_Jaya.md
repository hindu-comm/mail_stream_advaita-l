I condense from my earlier response:

"But advaita is like this: there is neither impulse nor desire nor
duality. No maya, no projection, no generation, no karma. There is only
the Self."

The very definition of "mAyA" is "yA mA" or "which is not".
That which is not is mAyA.

The kevalAdvaita of GauDapAda negates all generation, hence it is called
"ajAti vAda" or "doctrine of non-generation".

The vAda you're espousing is a theory that you've spun out of your
imagination, not advaita.
