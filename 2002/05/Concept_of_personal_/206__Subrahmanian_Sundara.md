"Special" Experiences are not a means of knowledge of Self according to
traditional view point.
True realization is to know that there is only Self in every experience
(mundane and special - ie., eating, walking, reading, writing and including
samAdhi).

I apologize. I did not mean to belittle your experiences or your sadhana.
However, I was only interested in knowing what is the description of a
daily experience of Advaita, as you state. If you are already liberated,
then I can never understand. But if you are not, then is it possible to put
your experiences into words?
