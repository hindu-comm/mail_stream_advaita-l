Hari Om. The concept of personal God is relevant as
long as we feel separate from Him. But if we can
transcend beyond shape, form and other attributes,
i.e. not reject them, but include them as a subset in
a superset, the idea of ourselves being separate from
God disappears and we realise that we are not separate
from Him and from other entities of the creation. It
is probably a matter of perspective.

And Sri Sankara is reverently referred as Sri
Bhagawatpada.
