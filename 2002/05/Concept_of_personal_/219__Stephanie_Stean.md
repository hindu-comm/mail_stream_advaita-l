Hello Ashish:

The use of the words is often necessary to communicate ideas.  When the
words are used, it's due to the unavailability of other methods of
communication (especially via e-mail).
And since we are all at different levels of understanding and learning, that
further complicates matter.  We use different language of description, but
we all are talking about the same idea.

The definition of experience I used, makes me uncomfortable as well because
of using the word "personally."   But knowledge of a state of non experience
(to use your terms) has to be communicated ,and often speaking in terms of
experience or personal participation is the only way to communicate it.

As you asked earlier for a description of my experiences, and I could not
give you one.  But that you asked in the first place, tells me that you see
verbal and written communication as a form of sharing knowledge, no matter
how limiting it is.

Thanks very much.
Steph
