Ashish:

Yes, I do experience it first hand, every day.  I don't completely
understand what it all means, so I read to see how others have made sense of
it.

So my insight into this is personal.  I have no one in my immediate circle
who understands or who can teach me about it.  That is why I read and listen
to others, like yourselves.

Thanks,
Stephanie
