But I also have the very direct experience of deep sleep and dreaming. From
what I know (through experience and subsequent inference), I did not know
what it was that was present during my deep sleep. That is also a direct
experience, is it not? I am not saying that jivanmuktas infer their
liberation through their direct experience - but we can at least experience
that we don't know what we truly are. I may be a man with hands and feet
and face and intellect right now but what happens when these are not
apprehended, when I experience non-dual avidyA? That is also everyone's
experience. In the waking state, one does not know what one was when one
was in deep sleep. So we either hazard discontinuity to our "Self" saying
that different people or different "things" had those experiences all of
which "I" somehow experienced, or we say that it was "Me" all along.

When I said that one does not know what one truly is, I meant that there
exists doubt in the mind of everyone (who wants to know) as to whether the
composite of body, mind and intellect is the person itself, or whether it
is something else.

True, but so is the word absolute.
