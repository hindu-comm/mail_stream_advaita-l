   However in India there has been an unbroken continuity of realised souls
who have realised through the scripture.
   To stray from the scripture is to be labelled 'unorthodox'. Buddha did so
and managed to achieve something.
    Buddhism however could not accept the method of extreme asceticism and
brought in surrender SaraNa to Buddha etc. Before long there were more than
a dozen school of Buddhist philosophy.

>  It was the armchair philosopher that prompted the comment 'Metaphysics is
about giving bad reasons for what you believe on instinct.' Just as dualism
and qualified non-dualism can be trivially observed in everyday life so can
Advaita. Consider a man who becomes so angry that he forgets himself totally
in his rage. It is a statement of complete absorbtion of nonduality with the
emotion. Nanda's arguments are puerile. dvaita and viSishtadvaita are based
as much on scriptural testimoney as advaita.
