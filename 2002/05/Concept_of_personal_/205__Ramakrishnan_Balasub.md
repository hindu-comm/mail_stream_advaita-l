Scriptural testimony is absolutely essential, as per
sha.nkara or any other reputable advaitin. On the
other hand, it is reasoning _based on scripture_ which
is not necessary, although it may serve as a guide for
many. Reasoning divorced from scripture is practically
harmful, to say the least. Scriptural evidence
presented to one with _proper qualifications_
culminates in what can be roughly called "direct
experience", as you have mentioned below.

Interestingly both maNDana and sureshvara would oppose
this statement. Both of them show (roughly similar
arguments) that perception does _not_ reveal
difference.

Even not accepting their arguments, how can
vishishhTAdvaita be apprehended by daily experience? A
very philosophically naive examination of every day
experience would of course seem to reveal dvaita.
vishishhTAdvaita (the rAmanuja type) rests as much on
scriptural authority as advaita, only in a different
way.
