Sankara has a commentary which is the standard  for Advaitins.  Aurobindo's
interpretation is considerably different and less contrived. (according to
me) Prabhupada is hopelessly anthropomorphic in all interpretations and Isha
is no exception. Radhakrishnan was a western fellow and had not an iota of
spirituality in him whatever be his reputation as a philosopher and and
statesman.
                with best wishes,
                    Hemant
