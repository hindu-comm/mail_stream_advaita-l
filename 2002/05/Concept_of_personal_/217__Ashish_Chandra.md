I am sure Rama would answer your questions but one thing that did strike me
was your sentence above, esp. the part I have pointed out. To experience
something means to be in a state of non-experience, then get into a state
of experiencing whatever it is we are talking about here, and then revert
to the older state of non-experience, or some other state. This is not, at
least in my understanding of Advaita, a correct interpretation of this
system. The seer and the seen are one so "who is it that sees and who is it
that is seen (all being Brahman)" is proclaimed by one of the Upanishads. I
believe this is pointed out in Drk-Drshya Viveka. So there cannot be such a
thing as experience nor an experiencer in the finality of things.
