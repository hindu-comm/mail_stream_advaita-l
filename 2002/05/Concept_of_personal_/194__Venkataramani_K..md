That is right. Also, I have heard that Sri Chaitanya, whom ISKCON follows,
also considered Sridhara Swamy's comentary as the only bonafide one. I have
a question: Was Sridhara Swamy the Sankaracharya of Puri at that time?
ISKCON rejects such a claim. Any information is most welcome.

Thank you and regards,
