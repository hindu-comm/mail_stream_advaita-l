sleep, deep sleep and waking state. It can also be inferred that "I am
conscious". You can also stretch this to say that consciousness is
everywhere. However, you cannot conclude from these that "I am
consciousness" and "Everything is Consciousness" and "Nothing but
Consciousness is there" is not a part of our everyday experience.

Sorry for cutting in here but how are these two systems experienced or
observed everyday. We experience duality or plurality, that is granted.
However, both these systems talk of a jiva that is eternal. They only
differ from Advaita in what is the identity of the Jiva to Brahman and what
is the nature of liberation. Do you have any everyday experience of
eternality?

But do you experience it first hand or is this just a point of view that
seems to be the most logical one, based on what you have read?
