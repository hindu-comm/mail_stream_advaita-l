<<Well...what I can make out from your mail is that you are under ther
influence of ISCKON. But your mention of Kanchi Paramacharya offers some
hope. If you are a Smartha (or a follower of Sankara Sampradaya) you better
steer clear from Isckonite ideas as they are directly against Advaita and
reading and listening to their ideas leads to such a kind of zealous
poisoning of mind especially for a novice seeker that it will be hard to
correct.
Read Parmacharya's works. Deivathin Kural if you know Tamil. 7 volumes are
avialable. Read them all.
PS  : Please dont use Sripad for our Adi Shankara !!!

Thank you very much Anand. Yes, I have read the commentary of Isopanishad
made available by ISKCON. I have also read their Srimad Bhagavatam and
Bhagavad Gita. I am also aware that they are against Advaita. I am a
Smartha and traditionally we are followers of Kanchi Pramacharya. In fact,
I am not convinced that the explanations of ISKCON are complete. My father
is a stauch follower of Paramacharya and only upon his advice that I
started reading Deivathin kural. So, hopefully I am not under any spell -:)
I find it very in depth, though I won't pretend that I understand
everything. Thank you for correcting me that I should not add any prefix to
Adi Sankara. I have seen Paramacharya using the title Bhagavadpada while
referring to Adi Sankara. Did my ignorant usage reduce the importance in
any way? If so, very sorry.

Thank you and regards,
K.Venkataramani
