By that definition, jnana is definitely an experience.

Correct.  It is what is undelying all awareness.  Or as the upanishad puts
it, it is the truth of Truth.

That is because of the guidance of gurus and shastras in a previous life.

This is something that people often find puzzling about Advaita Vedanta.
On the one hand we say scriptural knowledge is very important.  On the
other hand we say the shastras themselves are also part of the world of
maya.  How can that which itself is unreal produce that which is real?
The answer is no shastra (or Guru or God) can give the knowledge of
Brahman which as you mentioned is always there.  Rather they work in a
negative way.  They destroy the obstacles (lift the curtains to use your
analogy) which prevent the already existent realization form shining
forth.

I can accept there is more than one valid path but is every path valid.
For example, is running out into the street and randomly stabbing people a
valid path?  Even the person who accepts conventional differences must
discriminate between right and wrong to some degree.  What are the
criteria?
