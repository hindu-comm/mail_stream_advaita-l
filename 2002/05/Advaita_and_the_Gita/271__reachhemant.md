While it is true that Aurobindo is not  SAnkarAdvaitic and has clearly
distanced himself from Sankara his philosophy is also non-dualistic. Infact
it has a marked resemblence with Kashmir Saivism in that it treats the world
as Real. Even a cursory browsing of his book The Life Divine would vindicate
me
      with best regards,
                        Hemant
