Jaldhar is right. The other two Gita's are not advaitic strictly speaking.
But they are nevertheless interesting for me because both Trika system of
which Abhinavagupta is an exponent and Sri Aurobindo's Integral Idealism or
purNAdvaita as it is sometimes styled, put forward a non-dualistic point of
view.
