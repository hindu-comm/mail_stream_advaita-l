Didnt know there could be such a site in Japan :). Like I was mentioning,
the shojin ryori stuff is the most expensive :(
Didnt find anything with a single $ except veg sandwiches. But its a great
site - I will definitely check out some of those restaurants- good to switch
from rajasic mode occasionally. Thanks a ton for sending it across.

Regards
Somik
