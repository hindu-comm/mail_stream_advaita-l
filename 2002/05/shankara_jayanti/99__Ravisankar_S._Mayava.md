shankara jayanti is celebrated on vaishaaka shukla panchami. This year
it is on May 17th Friday in India. In the US, according to the New York
Ganesh Temple panchanga, it is on May 16th and naxatra on that day is
ardra.

What to do for that?

1) refer to

2) We can formally take up a discussion on shankara bhaashya on this
list. If you ask my suggestion -- iishaavasyopanishhad bhaashhya. It is
a short text and entire bhaashya in sanskrit is already available on
the net (sanskrit.gde.to).
