My name is Satyan. I have been studying Vedanta at Chinmaya Mission, San
Jose for the past six years. As a part of this, I have had the opportunity
to study several works including Tattva Bodha, Atma Bodha, Drik Drisya
Viveka and Viveka Choodamani. More recently, I am also grateful to get the
opportunity to learn more on this subject from teachers from Arsha Vidya
Gurukulam also.

During this period, I am grateful that I have been able to contemplate on
several of the ideas in Vedanta and clarify my own doubts in the process.
I look forward to learning more from this group and am joining it with the
hope that it will provide me useful pointers in my spiritual quest.

Besides Sankara's works, I am also deeply influenced by the teachings of
Ramana Maharshi, Jean Klein and Eckhart Tolle.
