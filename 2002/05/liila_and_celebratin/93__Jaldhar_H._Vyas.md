Yes, for Advaita Vedanta.  If you do not accept the premises of Advaita
Vedanta, you might not agree but as far as Advaita Vedanta is concerned
this is the siddhanta (final conclusion.)  Any other theories which may be
brought up in the shastras are for limted situations only.

Putting the question that way assumes intention  on the part of the
Paramatma.  But this is rejected too.  Rather it is something intrinsic.
An analogy is given in the Yogavasishtha to waves in the ocean. As the
wave crests, foam appears, stays momentarily and when the wave subsides
it disappears.  The wave did not decide to create foam, it is its very
nature.  Maya is like that foam it appears, remains for a while and
disappears.

When I gave this explanation once before, someone objected that this kind
of analogy implies that Brahman is turbulent and constantly in motion
which negates the idea of non-duality.  But turbulence is a matter of
scale isn't it?  If you are on the beach, the ocean seems like a very
violent place.  But if you are looking at it from space it would seem
perfectly flat and calm.

But you are not viewing the situation from the standpoint of reality but
maya.  So here creation seems real and seems to have a driving force.  The
goal of Advaita Vedanta is to achieve a shift in scale.

this issue was covered in the recent thread on Kashmiri Shaivism.

Relative to our own perceptions.

You can't "prove" science either.  (In fact Russell was one of the people
who discovered that.)  It is perfectly possible to change certain physical
constants and come up with valid and consistent models.  What makes
science useful and interesting is it matches what we actually perceive
better than any competitor.  Still there are vast areas of human knowledge
science can say nothing about.

Other religions care a lot about creation theories because they want to
prove the universe is made by God but truthfully we don't care so much
_how_ we got here, just that we are here.
