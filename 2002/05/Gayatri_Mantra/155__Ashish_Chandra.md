The issue should not be one of ego - whether women have a right to do this
or that. Sruti is a direct way of approaching the truth and the Smritis are
an indirect way. Women have recourse to the latter and in their Sannyas
stage, women can also study the Upanishads.

The Taittiriya Samhita was learnt by the students of Vaishampayana from
Tittiri birds (partridges). Now should one make that as part of a right
that partridges should accepted in Vedic Pathshalas?

I was talking about an effect of chanting mantras on the Veerya, not about
a social impact.

>Is fatherhood merely procreation of children?

No.

Anyway, since Ravi has already pointed out that this is an un-resolvable
issue, I would terminate my comments here.
