The name Parikshit is in the Kuntapa Suktas, which is a 'KHILA' of
Atharvaveda Saunaka Samhita anyways.

There is no old commentary on Kuntapa hymns, and some of the new ones (e.g.
by Professor Vishvanath Vidyalankar) interpret the hymn in a different
manner.

The continuity of Vedas and Puranas is one thing, but to read the Puranas
into the Vedas is totally another.
If 21 Rishikas can be mantradrashtas in RV alone, there is no reason why
women cannot recite the Vedas.
