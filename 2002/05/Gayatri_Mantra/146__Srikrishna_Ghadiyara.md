True, the prayer has universality in its deeper
content, that everyone's intellect needs to be
enlightened, and we should seek the grace of that
supreme spirit (depicted as the Sun God here). Here
the Sun God is not a physical entity, so to say. It is
the 'spirit' which illumines the Sun itself.

in other words, it is the Antaryamin which is
supporting our body, mind, intellect all the time,
because of which we recognise what we are. That
Antaryamin should enlighten us on the TRUTH. This is
the prayer.

yes, every one needs to know the essence of TRUTH. Bt,
the method need not be the same. Did the Vedas say,
every one has only one method of being initiated into
this supreme TRUTH.

When you analyse, there is proba bly, no
contradiction.

Om Namo Narayanaya !!
