The Itihasa-Purana is certainly the fifth Veda, but how are we sure that the
verses debarring women from Vedic recitations are not interpolations?

The Vedic mantrasamhitas DO NOT pre-suppose ANY SHASTRA external to them.
There is an Atharvana mantra that merely defines Puranavidya, other than
that, there is nothing in the Mantras that pre-supposes any fixed text other
than themselves.
