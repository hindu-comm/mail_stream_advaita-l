I thought he learnt the Sukla-Yajurveda latern on from the Sun. It was the
Yajus that were vomitted out and they became the KYV. SKY was learnt later
on.

Has any Acharya said so? As far as we trust the tradition, the Sruti,
Smriti and the Acharyas say the same thing. I would like to hear if you
have posed this question to an Acharya and he has agreed/disagreed with
you.

Ravi is right. This is a never ending topic but it does not mean we cannot
discuss it. Although we are by no means of the calibre of the Naiyyayikas
who argued with the Buddhists for centuries, we can at least come to some
formal conclusion on this topic. If anyone could clarify this with any
Acharya, that would be of immense help at putting this issue to rest.
