Namaste

I believe too that we ought to discuss mundane matters, but we shouldn't
talk too much about it though. As we all know that this is a list dedicated
to Advaita Vedanta, we should spend more time on Jnana Kanda than Karma
Kanda.

Unfortunately, from my observations, publications of Kamakoti deal more with
aparavidya than paravidya. Hence, Kamakoti pitha's works may not be the best
option to understand the Advaitic vision.
