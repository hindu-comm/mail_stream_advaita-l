Hello:

My introduction:
I am a university student and I study Sanskrit, Vedanta philosophy and
Indian religious texts.  I'm learning more about the different Vedanta
philosophical schools and thought being a member of the list could give me
some new insights in conjunction with my studies.

Thank you
