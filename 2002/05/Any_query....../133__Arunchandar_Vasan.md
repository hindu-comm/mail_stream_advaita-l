Namaskaaram,

The former Shankaracharya of Kanchi Sri Chandrasekharendra Saraswathi
talks about this "Brahmanas and others ate meat/beef during
sacrifices. Buddha saved the poor pasus" argument in Hindu
Dharma. According to the Jagadguru, whatever meat  was consumed was yagna
shishta, a morsel the size of a grain of gram, which had to be *swallowed*
without seasoning.  It is not clear to me that swallowing a morsel of meat
as yagna prasaadam by the hothas and the yajamaan is proof of "eating
meat" per se. The same applies for the soma brewed from the somalatha
during a soma yagna.

regards,
arun
