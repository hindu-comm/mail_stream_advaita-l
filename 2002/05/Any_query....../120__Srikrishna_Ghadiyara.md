Hari Om !!

Ashish: Thank you for replying to Somik, patiently,
about his false interpretations.

The modern science has not yet concluded once
existance of Lord Sri Krishna; then how can Somik say
that Lord Krishna started the "Cow protection Dharma".
Similarly, many of his arguments are figs of his
imaginations.

Every thing, even insignificant, needs effort, in this
material life. We need to sacrifice the lower to gain
the higher. It is not called sacrifice any more,
infact.

Somik has defined all the concepts around his
'convenience' than what is 'good'. Once he gets
married (assuming his partner will agree to be a cook
for life), his theories will change.

It is eally sad that he is still substantiating his
thought by argument, than enquiry.

The holy master Swami Sivananda has explained so
beautifully, what is right for a sadhak. It is one of
my source of inspiration and guide lines for daily
living. It will help any sincere sadhak.

Spice is not against physical body health. I myself
read some articles (in US) some time ago, which
concluded that in India the cardiac problems are the
least in the world because of the spices they use.
Interested people may search for the papers of those
studies.

Somik, please understand that the bad characteristics
introduced by oil, and spices in vegetarian food is
still less harmful than what is pre-packaged in meat
based food. When you roast, you add a little carbon to
it and remove Oxygen content from it. (Your definition
of good). So, please look into the 'essence' of 'food'
and do not amke a decision based on outer 'masala'
which your tongue feels easily.

The whole debate is from the stand point of a
spiritual sadhak. If you are one such, these doubts
will not arise at all. How calm is your mind, it is
the deciding factor.

I sympathise about your justification based on the 14
hour work schedule (as if you do the same all the 7
days a week). This is out of your ignorance that you
are not able to manage your own life. You feel this
will lead you some where, so you work on software than
offer your mind in prayer every day. Unless your
priorities change and start using your time more
intelligently, you are bound to suffer, just like many
others. (I was once a party to it. By grace of God now
I seem to know my priorities better)

Om Namo Narayanaya !!

Srikrishna
