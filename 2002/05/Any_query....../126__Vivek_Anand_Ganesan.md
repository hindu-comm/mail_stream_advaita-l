Hello Srikrishnaji,

Excessive use of oil/butter/grease is what I have called
"greasy". I am quite dismayed with the cooking habits of
most hindus today. We fry everything. My mother cannot
cook without a kadaaee ( a deep dish used for frying ).
We consider boiled food to be "pattiyam" i.e. diet given
to sick people! That says a lot about our current culture.
I don't think our ancestors consumed this much oil as we
do nowadays.

Well, we are going on a tangent. It is helpful to note that
an average Indian hardly gets two square meals a day. An
average American, OTOH, gets three square meals and most
likely consumes meat in two of those. Also, most meat in
the US has growth hormones and other chemicals which
further
add to the obesity.

I agree but to what extent? My neighbors in India are
gujarati jains. They are also strict vegetarians who avoid
even onions, garlic and other "root" vegetables such as
potatos. But, they eat sweets soaked in ghee for breakfast,
rotis with ghee + vegetables fried in dalda for lunch and
they have sweets for dessert again at night. I have noticed
similar diet habits amongst other gujaratis, marwaris etc.
Coming to the South, we eat rice, rice and more rice. Plus,
pickles floating in oil, coffee with cream milk, add ghee
to even normally healthy food such as dal and rice etc.
How is any of this healthy? It is no wonder that
upper-caste
vegetarians in India have one of the highest incidences of
diabetes, blood pressure and other diet-related diseases.

But, why don't plants have a mind? It seems to me that they
have some intelligence otherwise they wouldn't naturally
grow towards sunlight, grow thorns etc. to protect them and
other self-protective and self-promotive behaviour in
common
with "higher" life forms. The gradation of life forms is
based on the notion of intelligence which is highly
subjective. For instance, an American can say that
intelligence depends on analytical ability of the GRE and
GMAT exams. But, a non-english speaker would not understand
any of these exams but neverthless could be quite
intelligent. So, on what basis do we construct the
hierarchy and how can we verify the basis?

Regards,
