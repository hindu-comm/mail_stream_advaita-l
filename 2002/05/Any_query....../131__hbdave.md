In Japan getting pure vegetarian food outside your own home is real difficult.
I was in Japan (along with my wife) for one year, some years back. You have
two possibilities :
i.    If you have provision for simple cooking, then bread, milk, fruits,
vegetables and
    especially Tofu (a kind of curds made from milk of beans) can be used,
apart from
    rice and local wheat flour. Indian spices you will have to get from India.

ii.    Outside, most restaurants will understand "Shojin Dori" (the Buddist
priest's
        way) and serve you whatever vegetarian food they have.

I (and my wife) have lived in Japan for a year without taking even eggs.

May be this helps?
