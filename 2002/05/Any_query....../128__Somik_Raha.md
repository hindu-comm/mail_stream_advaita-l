Well  -this is not the US where you have so many Indians that you can either
order Indian food to your home or pay someone to cook. When you come back
tired, late at 11 or 12 - and you dont mind non-veg and the only shops open
offer you that - you dont have much choice.

Yes - getting together with like-minded people is an option that I've taken.
And we did cook for a while, till both of us got so busy that we are both
eating non-veg outside. But my roomie and I do get pleasure cooking veg once
in a blue moon. And yes, we know how to cook.

Japanese cuisine have rice - but you cant eat only rice. Everything else is
meat. You dont get noodles without meat either normally. Only some shops
provide that on special request - and I do take them when I can.

This consciousness issue is where there is a difference of opinion. Sri
Vivek Anand Ganesan made some interesting points in this regard. By the
theory of karma, it could be the "phala" of the animal to be killed and
eaten by a human. Is the human to blame for being an instrument ? Just the
same as - if someone is unkind to you - and you believe deeply in karma, you
would justify it by the fact that it is your prarabdha which you are now
getting. However, in order to get your prarabdha, another person has to be
involved! Just how guilty that person is - is a big question. For without
his involvement - the theory of karma wont work. At the same time, if the
person involved does even a seemingly incorrect task, but does so as its his
karma, then he doesent really sin. In fact, "sin" itself seems like a
debasing concept - but that would be another debate.

Extreme situations are relative. A Yogi which no extreme can touch is much
higher than a yogi who tries to maintain his environment around him. But I
do agree about eating for taste. And my contention is - most Indian
vegetarians (and perhaps non-Indian vegetarians too) eat for taste. They
dont like the taste of non-vegetarian and associate it being dirty. And they
also assume that non-vegetarians like the taste of meat. The truth is
otherwise - for non-vegetarians its not a big deal - it is just food.
By this argument, the merits of vegetarianism itself seem to vanish.

Thats a good practice. As I said vegetarian food cooked the right way is
really good for health. There is no doubt about it.
Bcos its good for health -> its good for the mind -> and ultimately takes
you forward on your journey to self-realization.
I am in total agreement with you here.

I do. :)

Why should the Gita be the wrong place to look ? Arjuna's question is so
specific. He asks what kind of food is to be eaten and what kind is to be
avoided. And there were definitely non-vegetarians around at that time. This
was a golden opportunity for Lord Krishna to set the record straight - and
get the whole of India to become vegetarian. But he didnt.

I agree. :) If you ever visit Japan, I think you will concur that the
vegetarian food here is mostly garbage - oily, spicy, greasy.
Its very hard for me to imagine that one cannot fall ill if more than two
meals of Indian vegetarian in restaurants here are attempted.

Now thats a quick and brutal judgement. Swamiji was a yogi for whom rules
had broken down. Gandhi (though a great yogi himself), was not at that plane
when he visited the west.

Well - are all Bengalis base sinners who cannot be lowered any further by
fish (or are they so pure that fish wont affect them) ? If non-vegetarian is
bad, surely fish ought to be banned. Besides Ramakrishna Mission allows
their monks to eat fish (and I am told chicken and mutton also). Surely that
would go beyond Bengalis.

But I dont think what I am doing is wrong. Thats the whole point. I think
veg food is great, but I dont see where the harm in non-veg food cooked
decently is ? The effort that I spend in being a thorough misfit here, I'd
rather spend on my work and make some contribution to technology which will
help the world and my nation in some way.

Anything that is forbidden must have been done to be forbidden. If you are
suggesting it was forbidden from the beginning of time, that would be
absurd.

In the US probably, not so in Japan.

Well - the case I am talking about is different. I have always been a
non-vegetarian, so I didnt have to give up some ideology or make a
compromise. However, I tried to be a vegetarian, and that failed. But I do
follow vegetarianism in India.

Sure - but I'd prefer my pioneering activities in software :). 70-80% of
vegetarians are probably that way bcos their parents are vegetarians. If it
were not so, the philosophy would be different. A philosophy that changes
with location is obviously not applicable to everyone. Like the previous
arguments on maya - it is all impermanent - so any theories on the
impermanent wont matter - they could all co-exist. It is true no doubt that
for a person eating veg all his life - non-veg food might cause strange
effects. The same as people eating tahir Shaadam or sambhar rice all their
life in the South, simply cannot consume the rich North Indian food. And
people from the North find the sour tasting cuisine of the South a little
too difficult to take on a daily basis. I know this because I have spent
years in the North, taking that cuisine, and years in the South taking the
South Indian food. And I loved both, I have a metabolism where I really like
anyone's food cooked from their heart (as long as it doesent burn me up with
spice and oil). Ive spent years in the West and East - and their food habits
are quite different. I cant frankly find the one size that fits them all.

Yup - I hope I am reasonably sound on that - I have found it difficult to
understand the concept of sin connected to it, and perhaps sin in general -
especially when one talks of Brahman and Advaita philosophy.

Bytway - its a pleasure to discuss these ideas at a non-fundamental level.
Thank you for the discussion. I hope to clarify a lot of my misconceptions.
