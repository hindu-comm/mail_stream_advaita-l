This is what I was pointing to you; this is not proof
enough that Lord Sri Krishna ate meat (say in that
Aswamedha). Do you know if the Yajamana of the yajna
is enjoined to eat meat of the horse or all the guests
are obligated to eat that horse meat ????

Do not make guess work lead you to false conclusions.
You said you are a programmer. Such programming logic
does not work. Recall your If - Then - Else
statements. You need rigorous logic in spirituality,
than in mundane programming.  Here you are looking for
Universal solutions.

Om Namo Narayanaya !!
