Sure Japanese cuisine is mostly meat based, but they have rice and
noodles and things.  And what I don't understand is why you just can't
learn to cook? Or get together with other like-minded people?  Or pay
someone to cook you the right food?

There is more to being sattvic than just seasoning.  What is being cooked
is also very important.  The idea of vegetarianism is connected to the
idea of karma.  the more conscious a being, the more it is capable of
intentional actions.  So my absorbing a particular being you are also
inheriting it's accumulated paapa and punya.  It works the other way for
plants.  Because they are devoid of consciousness, they are incapble of
progressing up the ladder of karma unless they hitch a ride in the stomach
of a good person.

The intention of the eater is also important.  eating out of need is less
sinful.  In fact there is a legal maxim, the nyaya of Vasishtha and the
dog.  Once there was a terrible famine and the Maharshi Vasishtha  fought
with a chandala over a piece of dog meat.  In other words even ordinarily
wrong things can be justified in extremis.  But eating meat for taste or
convenience is more sinful.  Some Vedic yajnas involve animal sacrifice.
This is ok because the animals go directly to Heaven.  (Though increasing
squeamishness on this topic might be the reasonsuch yajnas are rarely
practiced nowadays.)

The most important factor is shistachara.  Meat-eating is the norm in some
castes and localities.  In Bengal even Brahmanas eat fish or meat.  Some
learned scholars such as Vishwanatha Tarkapanchana author of the Bhasa
Pariccheda have written works defending the practice. But for others like
the Brahmans south of the vindhyas' vegetarianism is the norm.  There is
shastric support for deeming even onions and garlic as non-vegetarian.
Jains and many Vaishnavas follow this.  My practice is to avoid them as
much as possible in general and particulary during utsavas and shravana.

But even those who accept meat-eating as conventional agree that a
vegetarian diet is spiritually superior for the reasons given above.

It's the wrong place to look.  The dharmashastras such as Manu or
Parashara or Yajnavalkya say more on the subject.

I agree wholeheartedly.  Being in the IT field you are no doubt familiar
with the expression "garbage in garbage out" Reason is useless if not
based on sound premises.

Is this true?  Then I consider it a blot on the character of Vivekanand.
Compare to Gandhiji who also journeyed to a foreign land and whose mother
made him promise to never eat meat. He often subsisted on boiled cabbage
or bread and butter but he never broke his promise.

Because they are Bengalis.  Philosophy has nothing to do with it.

Any morality based on expediency is no morality at all.  I sympathise with
your plight but if you know what you are doing is wrong how can you
continue with it?  Who decides what is practical?  Things will only become
less impractical if you are willing to expend some effort.

You maybe right you may be wrong. We can only speculate about times so
remote.  The fact is that for as long as anyone can remember, it has been
forbidden.  That fact is more important than any theory.

Fine, I doubt if anyone would disagree with that.  Recently in the
newspapers here in New York there was a story about a couple who were
vegans (avoided animal protein altogether) whose baby had developed
rickets--a malady rare even in the thirld world now--due to their
unhealthy and faddish diet.

But there isn't an either/or situation.  It is possible to avoid both meat
and unhealthy vegetarian food.

Here in America we do.  Not all the time but increasingly so.  And that is
due to the fact that people insisted on it.  Many of the early Indian
immigrants did take up meat for "practical" reasons but enough did not
that I don't have to worry abot it today.

How does the impractical become practical?  Due to the effort people put
into it.  you are like a pioneer in the wilderness.  You may have to
suffer hardships but if you persevere you will make it easier for the next
person who will make it easier for the next person and eventually it will
seem completely normal.

I am not, but I have heard it on this list.  What is ok for a hunter is
not necessarily ok for a Brahman and vice-versa.

What it shows is that "Hinduism" is a vague and meaningless term beyond
just an umbrella for describing religions of India.  I use it for
convenience but I don't have a "Hindu" identity I have Brahman, Smarta,
and Gujarati identities all of which do have specific things to say about
diet even if "Hinduism" doesn't.  Despite the best efforts of the VHP and
other right-wing lunatic fringe groups, most "Hindus" feel that way and so
should you.  Perhaps it may turn out that meat-eating is the right path
for you but please come to that conclusion based on sound principles.
