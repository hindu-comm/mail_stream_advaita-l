There is a specific proof. Yudhishthira conducted the Ashwamedha yajna - in
which Sri Krishna participated. As is the norm, the meat of the horse has to
be eaten after the sacrifice (this kind of sacrifice was also mentioned by
someone). The reference for this Ashwamedha yajna is in the Mahabharata.

I agree with that. If your guru has asked you to abstain from meat- then
that is 100% correct-  "Gurur vakyam sada satyam" - there can be no debate
on that. It depends on the Guru and his rule for his followers.
