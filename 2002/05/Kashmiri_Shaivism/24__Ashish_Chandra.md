Namaste Srinivas,

However, if you claim that the jiva can fall again, then this certainly is
not the Advaita position. For jiva to attain mukti is to rid itself of
avidya. Once the avidya is gone, there is no danger whatsoever. Otherwise,
all this striving for mukti would be pointless. For a jiva to be in a
constant state of yoga would imply that there is always such a *thing* as
jiva and that there is such a thing as a *state of yoga*; we have already
negated the "brahma satyam jagan mithya" declaration.

Could you give some examples from these Puranas wherein a liberated one
fell again into bondage.

But where is this creation taking place if we go by the pAramArthik view?
Brahman, as we know from Vedanta, is Ekameva-advitIyam, one without a
second.

However the question would be why a perfect one would need to rejoice, with
or without intent. Then we can no longer call It the perfect one as It too
has states of rejoicing and non-rejoicing, the latter being a not-so-
perfect state.
