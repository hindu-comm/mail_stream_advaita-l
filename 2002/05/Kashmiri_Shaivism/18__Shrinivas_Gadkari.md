B: The concept of mukti is from the view point of the Jiva.
Sadhana is targetted to relieve the Jiva from suffering. The
whole purpose of creation was fun. Lack of correct knowledge
makes Jiva suffer, hence sadhana. Everything that I am saying
are standard statements nothing new. Only stressing the fun
part of the game.

By not doing anything the suffering of the Jiva will not go
away.
