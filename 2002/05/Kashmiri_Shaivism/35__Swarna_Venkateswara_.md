 Hari Om. Is the mind to be resolved or dissolved? Going beyond (like going through a door), indicates that one has the 'key' to the lock on the door. So even after the knowledge, the door is there, but it is no longer locked to you. 'Jnana Beegam' (the key of knowledge) is referred to in Yoga. If the mind is dissolved (into the Self), there is no return (to the previous state).
Anyway, the key is mind.

beyond the mind is seeing through the mind. Mind is
mityha it has to be resolved. Even after knowledge the
mind is still there.
