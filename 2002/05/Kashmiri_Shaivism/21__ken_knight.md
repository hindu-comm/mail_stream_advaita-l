Namaste Shrinivas,

I am sorry to have been absent for the last few days
but a violent lightning strike..I was in the bath at
the time and leapt out like a sprinter from the
blocks...took out my broadband modem.
I have had to resort to an old system until a
replacement arrives.

My first look at books at home gave a listing in
Jaideva Singh's introduction but I have yet to find
the relevant shlokas.  I will also look for the second
point today.
As this system can be expensive..I ma working from
home at the moment..... I may wait until the new modem
appears before searching some of the relevant
 sites,

Sorry not to be of much use so far,

Ken Knight
