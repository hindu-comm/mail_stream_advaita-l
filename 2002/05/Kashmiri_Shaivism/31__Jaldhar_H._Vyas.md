The parshads (attendents) of the Lord like Jaya and Vijaya do not count as
liberated beings neither do the devatas like Indra or Nahusha.  They have
reached their position due to karma and if they fall again it is also due
to karma.  In fact Nahusha is a good example of a person who reached his
exalted position due to punya and lost it due to paapa.

In the Puranas Brahma, Vishnu, and Mahesha are described as the saguna
Brahman (representing, rajas, sattva, and tamas respectively) while the
nirguna aspect is different--Narayana, or Sadashiva, or Jagadamba depnding
on the emphasis of the particular work.  It is the saguna aspect that
appears to be subject to curses, emotions etc. not the "supreme being"

Of course not.  That is why the goal is to remove the bonds of time and
space altogether.  In mukti there is no more jiva thus there is none that
can fall.  The samadhi (perfection in yoga) of samkhya/yoga is considered
a lower step than mukti in Advaita Vedanta.  But even those who have
attained nirvikalpa samadhi but have been unable to maintain it do not
fall.  They are reborn in higher worlds where presumably they have better
chances for success.  (This is called krama mukti)

But as time is infinite there will never be an end to the temporary
lapses.  So you cannot call yourself free.  You are a prisoner of time.

It may make the juggling easier but going by what you previously said, it
can never become truly effortless.  So again why bother?  Why not expend
the effort on improving your material position instead?
