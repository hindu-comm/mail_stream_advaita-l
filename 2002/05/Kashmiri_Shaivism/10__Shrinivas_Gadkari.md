Namaste KenJi,

I was wondering if you or other list members may have
information related to the following:

1. Kashmir Shaivism has 35/36 tattvas, what would be an
authoritative text on this ?

2. In which original text is the following found:
Sadashiva tattva: corresponds to "I am This"
Ishvara tattva: corresponds to "This I am"
Shuddha Vidya: equalizes "I" and "This"

Best regards
Shrinivas Gadkari
