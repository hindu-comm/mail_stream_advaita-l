Namaste,

Thank you for the references. However, in each of these instances, the
Advaita view would be that they are all superimpositions upon the
substratum of Brahman. Vishnu, Rudra, Indra, Prajapati, Brihaspati are all
equally false in the pAramArtha view. Vishnu is nothing but
Brahman "limited" by Maya, just as jIvA is Brahman limited by avidyA
[Panchdasi]. There is only a difference of guNa between jIvA and Ishvara.

              ^^^^^^^

When you say this, who do you think the oneself is? Advaita, as far as I
know, answers this question i.e. "Who am I" based on the authority of the
Vedas.

Pardon me if I assume incorrectly but I get the feeling that you hold jIvA
to be eternally separate from Brahman, and that the former must always be
engaged in some sort of effort to be in a constant state of liberation.

If your jIvA and mine are separate, why do we both see the same world? If
we were to meet, you would see me and I you. If you are my creation and I
am yours, then we are constantly creating the objects around us and what's
more, those objects are creating more objects, and in some cases, objects
that I create actually create me (as in me creating you and you, me). This
does not seem logical. But if you claim that the Ishvara is the only one
who creates (again, this is a fallacy as there is no such thing as creation
or destruction in the pAramArthik view), then it would make more sense.

Even things like lilA and mAyA are ascribed to Ishvara and not Brahman. The
play is Ishvara's not Brahman's. Brahman does not change one bit and always
is. The universe, gods, Ishvara, you and me are only Brahman seemingly
limited by nAma and rUpa.
