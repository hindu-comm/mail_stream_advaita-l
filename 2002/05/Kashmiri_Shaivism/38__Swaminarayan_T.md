Harihi Om , I would like to add that actually going
beyond the mind is seeing through the mind. Mind is
mityha it has to be resolved. Even after knowledge the
mind is still there.

By your above statement,are you implying that a jiva which is endowed with a mind,when in sadhana ,endevouring to go beyond its mind is actually using its mind to do so?  Has not the jiva got to negate its own  mind , in order to  be "ITSELF"? Is that what you imply by saying that the mind has to be resolved? How then does the jiva resolve the mind ?

Mind is the instrument through which everything is cognised. When the mind is kept in "Amana -bhaava" (NonMind) , this Dwaita, consisting of Name and Form, gets negated ,when the jiva that does sadhana, verily, transcends the mind and remaining as "Kevala Dhrug", merges in its essance which is nothing but "Sat Chit Ananda--Brahman"

Hari Om!

Swaminarayan.
