Namaste Aniruddhan,

B: I will give the standard answer: Suppose I see a dream where in
I see Aniruddhan and Jaldhar and I see a car pass by. In the dream
both Aniruddhan and Jaldhar will seem to see exactly the same car.
That is to say the universe in a dream appears the same to the characters
in that dream. So this cannot be a valid difference between dream and
wakeup states.

B: I am not denying existence of brahman. But may be you can clarify how
this is related to the above point.

Best regards
