 Hari Om. What is called as mind in English, is recognised as atleast three different phases in Hindu Vedanta. Mana, Buddhi and Chitta. Probably when we are discussing this topic, we should identify one of these facets. I will post a bit more later. Sai Ram.

the mind, we can see reality inspite of duality. The
reality has to be recognised and not grasped because
it is not available for that. When we resolve the mind
for its purpose we are THAT in spite of duality. This
what I mean when I say going beyond the mind and
resolving it. Nothing changes for us except a
re-cognition.Once we have understood a fact about our
self what else is there to do except play our roles
skillfully till our body is alive. Lalita
