The Advaita Vedanta position is that it is Ishvara (Brahman in His saguna
aspect)  who creates the _world_appearence_ (note the distinction.)  If I
can respond to a Shrinivas Gadkari, it is not because I have dreamt him up
but because there really is such a person.  While we as individuals add
our own layor of creation (and hence Maya) it is only on top of Ishvaras
creation.

The difference between this and Shaivism is that for us, even Ishvara in
the final analysis is Maya.  As Gaudapadacharya states in the
Mandukyakarikas, from the paramarthic viewpoint there is really no
creation or destruction at all.

Lila for us is just the automatic consequence of Gods' nature.  That is
why it described as "play."  If my daughter is moving about and she kicks
me, I do not feel insulted.  It was not intentional but an accidental
effect of her movement.  But the Shaivas ascribe intention to Bhagawan.
And I don't see what is so fun about say, giving little children cancer.

We would say the similarity of experiences is due to the fact they have
one creator -- God.  If the atmas are the creators on the other hand, then
there ought to be a lot more diversity than there actually is.

If Shiva Bhagawan is in the same boat as the jiva, then He can be of no
help in assisting the jiva towards mukti can he?

Brahman in Advaita Vedanta straddles the gulf between vyavahara and
paramartha which why it is possible to break free of avidya.

> Frankly I see no difference between Vedanta and Shaiva darshana.

Let me summarize the differences as I see them.

1.  Creation in Advaita Vedanta is only a false superimposition.  In the
Kashmiri Shaiva darshan, it is a real transformation (albeit of a lower
order than Paramashiva.)

2.  Hence for AV there only seems to be a creator God.  Brahman in the
nirguna aspect is unchanging and devoid of intention or action.  For KS
Shiva Bhagawan intentionally changes Himself from state to state.

3.  For AV the cause of suffering is avidya (ignorance) which results in
reality being unknown or misunderstood.  This avidya is caused by Maya
which veils reality or projects false realities.  For KS it seems the root
cause is Shiva Bhagawans withdrawal from his creation.

An advaitin ought not to be hostile to the conventional world but
indifferent to it certainly.  Because it is not true.

Which is why I maintain they really shouldn't be considered non-dualists
at all.

In general, the astika darshans have not had such a pessimistic outlook on
life as the nastika ones.  Although Advaita Vedanta concurs with Buddhism,
Jainism etc. that samsara is is the cause of suffering, karmayoga offers a
"loophole" for those whoese concerns are more mundane.  But even then, we
maintain people have to be weaned away from such ideas if they are to
spiritually progress.
