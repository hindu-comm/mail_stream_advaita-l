Namaste Jaldhar,

A: "Who controls the dream ?".

B: Ishvara is the controller.

B: So I control the dream when I am in the state of Ishvara. And
experience it when I am in the state of Jiva. And keep jumping
states all the time. When I am in the state of Ishvara I am unbiased
and hence control the universe in a Just manner. Hence not everything
is rosy. Thus Jaldhar contradicts Shrinivas.

Best regards
Shrinivas
