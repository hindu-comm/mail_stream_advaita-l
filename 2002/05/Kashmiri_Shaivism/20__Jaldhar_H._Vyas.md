But this jiva you say is the creator.  Presumably then it has created
ignorance and bondage too.  So why does it need mukti?  Either it can get
it any time it chooses (and that choice is mearly one of nomenclature) or
it can never get it.

jiva as creator has as many problems as Brahman as creator.
