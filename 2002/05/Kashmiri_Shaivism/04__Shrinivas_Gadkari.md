Namaste Jaldhar,

The proposition that God is an external being is out, no need
even to discuss this idea.

So it has to be the Siva as the Self who creates. Is this not the
same in Vedanta ? Creation is a leela.

And what for ?
Just for fun.

Now why does the world look the same to everyone ?
How would you answer this as a Vedantin ? May be something like
this scheme is a part of the leela itself. Why not use the same
answer when it comes to (Kashmir) Shaiva darshana.

What happened to Shiva after creation ?
Same answer as that of a Vedantin: Beholding the creation, the
Being who was Shiva, due to avidya forgot his Shiva nature and
became a Jiva.

Frankly I see no difference between Vedanta and Shaiva darshana.
The only difference being, a typical Vedantin tends to reject the
world of duality (I never could understand why, and I have exhausted
myself posting messages related to this point on the advaitin
and this list). On the other hand, a typical follower of the Shaiva
darshana tends to celebrate the world of duality - although it
is an illusion !

Best regards
Shrinivas Gadkari
