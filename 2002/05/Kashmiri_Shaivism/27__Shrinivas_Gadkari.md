Namaste Ashish,

Some examples from pauranic accounts:

When Sati burnt herself, Bhagvan Rudra was immersed in grief. And Bhagvan
Vishnu had to intervene.

Bhagvan Rudra had to run to save himself from Bhasmasura again Bhagvan
Vishnu had to intervene.

In the amarnath episode, Bhagvan Rudra told Parvati that he knows may
secrets to avoid death. That is to say, he has to practise yoga.

Bhagvan Brahma, Vishnu and Rudra were cursed by sage Brighu, showing that
even they are a subject to curses.

Two residents of Vaikuntha were cursed to take birth as Hiranyaksha and
Hiranyakashapu. Nahusha fell from heaven to become a snake.

Indra has been cursed many a times, e.g. Ahilya episode and had to suffer.

Such accounts make me suspect that one cannot assume that it is possible
to establish oneself eternally in perfect yoga. Small lapses will be
there. What is important is to have the knowledge and skill to recover
from such temporary lapses and prevent them from snowballing. This in
my view is liberation.

Then what is this big deal about brahma jnana ?
On acquiring brahma jnana/ atma jnana, the practice of yoga becomes
effortless. This is the great value of brahma jnana. Hence acquiring
brahama jnana is equivalent of liberation.
(Again this is my understanding and is possible that may be incorrect.)

Creation is a image projected in the mind of Jiva. The same as with
dreams.

No one knows answer to this question. Why does the perfect one
wish to entertain itself ?
We just know that it does like to play and this world emerges.

Shrinivas
