I will send them the list rules and if they send me an introduction, I'll
add them to the list. Btw, this request should have gone to
listmaster at advaita-vedanta.org not the list itself.

Dear Jaldaharji,

Thank you for your response to my request. Sorry for not having sent the request to the right address.

I hope all of them will respond to your message and send in their introductions at an early date.

Hari Om!

Swaminarayan
