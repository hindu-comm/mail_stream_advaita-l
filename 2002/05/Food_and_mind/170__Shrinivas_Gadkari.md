Namaste,

Shri Sai Baba (Shirdi) used to freely eat meat.

Once a yogi came to meet Sai Baba wanting to clarify
some doubts on attaining samadhi. At that time Sai
Baba was eating bread (bhaakar) with onion with some
other person. Seeing this the yogi thought to himself
"how can this fakir who eats onions help me attain
samadhi ?"

Continuing to eat his food, Sai Baba spoke to the
other person "Bhau (brother) those who can digest
onions, let them freely eat onions".

The yogi understood the message. Later Sai Baba helped
him attain the state of Samadhi.

The goal of Sadhana should be to go beyond these food habits.
This not to deny the role of food habits in some stages
of the sadhana.
