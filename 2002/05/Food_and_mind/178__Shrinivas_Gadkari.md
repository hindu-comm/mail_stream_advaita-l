Namaste Kartik,

Here is a portion of my earlier message:

I had framed the last line of my post precisely to discourage
replies like the one you posted. All your objections are already
taken care of by the scentence: "This not to deny the role of
food habits in some stages of the sadhana."

So Vegetarian food, moderate eating, fasting etc has its place
in yoga sadhana.

Shrinivas

p.s. This is for Somik: The episode I quoted is from Sai Sat
Charitra.
