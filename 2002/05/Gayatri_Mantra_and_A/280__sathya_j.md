Namaskar,

I fully agree with Shri Ravi Venkatraman.

The discussion SHOULD PREFERABLY BE about the
Sankara's Life and Philosophy.

In turn these discussion should be used by EACH ONE OF
US to practice in our DAILY LIVES.
When we practice, time should be spent on Observing
ourselves and auditing oursleves, rather than spending
time on dicussing.

Also DISCUSSION IS A PRACTICE TO BETTER UNDERSTAND
TOPICS--- IT SHOULD NOT BE A PLATFORM FOR DEBATES.

This way we can get our answers to our Questions and
also solve our puzzles of the Daily lives.

ONLY Talking about topics like food , marraige, will
NOT help us understand the Philosophy.

We NEED TO EXPERIMENT AND PRACTICE IN OUR DAILY LIVES
TO understand the philosophy.

As is said : There are 5 types of knowledge :

1. General Knowledge
2. Practical Knowledge
3. Common Sense Knowledge
4. Discriminatory Knowledge
5. ATMA JNANA

We need to keep our FOCUS on ATMA JNANA--- > try to
practice in our daily lives to OBSERVE THE ATMA JNANA,
--- > this will simultaneously help us in the other
types of knowledge, which will hep us understand all
the Questions being asked currently about food
marraige etc.

This is beautifully put as :

Atma Jnana is that which reveals the unity in
multiplicity,the e ernal in the perishable.One who
has attained Atma Jnana is all-knowing."Tarati sokam
Atmavith"("the knower of the Self
overcomes sorrow"),says the Upanishad.All worldly
knowledge is concerned with sustaining
life.When knowledge of the Spirit which is the basis
of all other knowledge of the sciences and
the arts is acquired,it is easy to get any kind of
knowledge.When communion with the Divine,
who is the source of all knowledge,power and wisdom,is
established,one has access to every
kind of knowledge.Hence each one should strive to
attain Self-realisation through purity of mind
and heart.

Namaste
Sathya

<P>All List Members,</P>
<P>I joined this list to learn more about Sri
Sankara's philosophy. When I joined here, we used to
have good discussions on Brahma Sutra Bashyas. Later
unfortunately, I find that there are
elaboratediscussions on more mundane things
about food, marriage and castes, when compared to the
actual philosophy. It is true that we need to follow
our karma for the sake of getting detachment and
conquering our personal weaknesses, and to do that we
should know what our karma is. We live in a free world
and you can try out any thing these days. There are so
many people preaching all kinds of things. But
elaborate political discussionscombined with
racist and sexist viewsis not necessary
forthis list - this is my personal view. </P>
<P>It has got nothing to do with Sri Sankara's life
and philosophy. </P>
<P>In the lastseveral months, there have
beenrepeated discussions more on these matters
than the philosophy itself. I would request all
involved to get into more meaningful discussions for
the benefit of all of us. </P>
<P>I am not learning anything newwhich should be
the case with many of you. We have some really
eruditepeople, whocan tell us good things.
Please let us go back toprolific discussions to
enhance our knowledge.</P>
<P>Thanks,</P>
