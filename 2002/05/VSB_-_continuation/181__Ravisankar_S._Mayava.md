In the above page, I have just put together what I had posted in the
past. With time, I will have to correct and improve the consitency of
the translation.

I will post the verse 5, next week. I hope by the grace of bhagavaan
Sri Sankara I will be little more regular in the future. If you have
any comments, please let me know.


bhava shankara deshikame sharaNam.
