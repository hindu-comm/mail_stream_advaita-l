Dear Members,
    This is regarding LakshmiNrsimha Karaavalamba Stotram of Sri Sankara.
Bhagavan Sankara describes the ills of this samsaara and prays for the
Lord's succour in this beautiful Sloka. I would like to know if there are any 
on-line sources for the complete meaning of this Sloka. Can you please 
give me pointers. The sanskrit.gde website contains the Sloka. But doesn't 
have the meaning. I would be very grateful if someone can post the meanings 
of the Sloka. I am sure it will benefit many like me.

    Thanks a lot.
    chandrasekaran.
