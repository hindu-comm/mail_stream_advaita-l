I am sending the link to the text for Lakshmi Nrsimha Karaavalamba stotram,
so that some erudite member in this list might look into it and post a translation.

http://sanskrit.gde.to/

In this page, click on "Sanskrit Documents". Then click on "Vishnu" under
deity list. In the following page look for lakshminR^isin.ha.

Thanks in advance,
chandrasekaran.
