 Please see the archives of this list for the second week of May 1998
 for a translation by yours truly.

 The same is also available at:

 This beautiful hymn is one of my favorites. Also, HH Abhniva Vidya
 Teertha Swami has said that Narasimha combines features of both
 Vishnu and Shiva, not just Vishnu, because He is often described
 as having three eyes (tryaKsha), the pinAka bow, etc, apart from
 the shaN^kha, chakra and other characteristics of Vishnu.
