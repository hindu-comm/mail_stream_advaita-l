Dear Jaldhar
I fully agree with you. Its not the fault of the Jnani. The fault lies with
the common man like us. Sometimes I wonder.....is this all because we do not
that much respect and give that much authority to our scriptures as do the
followers of Islam or Christianity. They really go by the WORD!!!
And our scriptures IMO are far more realistic and practical in approach.
There is reasoning...not just tenets to be followed.
Religious education as far as hindus are concerned (in India) is decimally
low. The knowledge which some people have is either outright wrong concept
or total ignorance. Who is to blame!!!

Regards,
Anand K
