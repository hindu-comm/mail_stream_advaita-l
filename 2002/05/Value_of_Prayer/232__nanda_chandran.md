This view is quite in line with modern notions of "Hinduism" which using
inspiring concepts from the Vedic texts like the Upanishads, is presented as
"liberated" and "free" in contrast to "restrictive" Semitic religions.

This is far from the truth and the origins of such false views lie in the
propoganda of the "secularist/leftist" intelligensia in India who desire to
liberate "Hinduism" (whatever that might be) from its "pointless" rituals
and "unscientific" dogma.

Don't we have Shankaraachaaryaas or the Sri Vaishnava Jeers or the
Madhvaachaaryaas? Are they not central figures and preceptors for the
various sects within "Hinduism"?

Don't we have the mathaas of the various sects - don't they represent
organization?

Sure none of them by themselves might represent "all Hindus" - but still
each represents a particular section of Hindus even as  Catholic or
Protestant churches represents only a particular section of the Christian
population in the West.
