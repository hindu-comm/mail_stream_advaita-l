Thinking more on a historical and intellectual level, Anand is correct.
This is because both the right and left wing in India are more concerned
with propogating their fantasy version of the past than the truth.  The
problem is once you start lying even with good intentions, you lose the
moral authority to confront other liars.  So not only religion but all
intellectual fields get depressed and that can't be good for Indias future
progress.
