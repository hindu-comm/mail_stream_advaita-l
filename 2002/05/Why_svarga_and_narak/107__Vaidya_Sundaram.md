namaskaram.
 One also has to be cognizant of statements in the Srimad Bhagavatam that
this world here is both swarga and naraka as well, depending on the
experiencer. Not to gross people out, but if only you have had a chance to
see the animals beeing killed in the slaughter house, you will know what
naraka is. It takes only one sight of a live crab being dipped in boiling
oil to make a dish called tempura to realize that naraka is here and now for
that creature.

 There is a need for swarga and naraka as a practical matter as well - in
spite of all scriptural exhortations to perform karma without personal
motive, not many people do that; at a subtle level, there is always a wish
attached. The reward for those intentions has to be swarga. Similarly with
punishment. There is a proverb to the effect that the policeman is there not
to stop a theif but to stop a good man from becoming a theif. So also with
naraka. The fear of punishment forces the common man to be disciplined.
