But first we need to conjure up the thing in the mind
isn't it? Everything begins in and ends with the mind.

I have read in the Bhagavata (sorry can't remember the
details, mere hand waiving I guess) that whatever that
occurs to the mind can come to pass.

Now what is this mind according to the advaita-vedanta
of Adi Shankaracharya? I am eager to know.

Jagannath
