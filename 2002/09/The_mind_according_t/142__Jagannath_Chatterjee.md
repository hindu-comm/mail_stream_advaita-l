Dear Kiran,

At least you know sanskrit. I haven't learned the
language. So I can only quote those slokas I have
roted.

Not necessarily. By mind I meant the collective mind.
Since ages men have wanted to fly. Today they can.
Scientists talk of getting ideas in sleep. I think
they subconsciously tap the collective mind.

A friend of mine has been witness to a very
interesting incident. A retired Professor in
mathematics of the Ravenshaw college at Cuttack met a
unlettered fakir and asked him a mathematical
question. The fakir gave the correct solution claiming
he had access to the collective mind.

The conjuring up power existed with both the Devatas
and the Asuras. Neither were brahmajnanis I guess. It
is a siddhi.

The reality of the world is subjective. The world is
real so long as we are in it. When a thorn pierces you
it is difficult to act like a brahmajnani and say that
there is no pain. So, as long we are in the world, we
have to take the world for real. When we are fully
convinced otherwise the world becomes false.

I think it is the collective mind that is deluded.
Thus, automatically, the individual mind is also
deluded. That is also the reason why all perceive the
same objects and sequences in the world.
