Okay. Here is where we moderators step in and request everybody to stop
this discussion. There is no need to bicker in the above fashion.

This is an ADMIN request, and if not heeded, we will be forced to kill this
thread ourselves. Frankly, we do not want to actively moderate this list,
but we will, if we are given no other choice. So, Kiran and Srikrishna and
everybody else, for a couple of days, try not to continue this thread (and
all other related ones, having to do with freezing water by boiling it).
