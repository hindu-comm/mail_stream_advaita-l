Well, you were the one who said don't search for a scientific answer,
search in the 'mANDUkyA' and 'bhAshya' instead! What does that mean?

And by the way, I didn't call you a friend in any group, my friend! I don't
call someone a friend because he/she subscribes to my viewpoint! A friend
is a friend for no reason!

Silence comes when the brain *stops* working!

I don't need to read any Subhashita to conclude that a person questioning
like me compares to a FOOL! I never claimed to be a learned person! I came
to this list *because* I am a FOOL! It is a FOOL who asks questions. Not a
learned person!

Don't learn my definitions! Who asked you to learn my definitions?! If an
idiot says 2+2=5, why do you go ahead and 'learn' that 2+2=5? Why are you
scared of even clearing his doubts? Why are you scared of asking yourself
whether 2+2=5 or not?! Why? Have you forgotten the answer? Or did you
always assume that 2+2 is something else because someone told you?
