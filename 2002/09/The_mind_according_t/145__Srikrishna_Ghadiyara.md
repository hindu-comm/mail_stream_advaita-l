I do not have any FUNDAMENTAL doubts like what a
brahmavid is . Please read your definition of what is
a brahmavid.

Do not put new words in my mouth that I said
'mANDUkyA' is unscientific. Do not irritate me, by
joining me in your group. I do not belong to your
group of FUNDAMENTAL DOUBTS men. Do not call me your
friend in your group.

You must keep silence until your brain starts working.
It is easy to get oil out of sand, it is easy to
search for a hare's horn, but one can not convince a
FOOL. You must read and understand Bhartruhari
Subhashita, so you know how well a person who
questions like you, compares to a FOOL.

Spare me from your instinct to question the
definitions of an established subjects. You write your
own definitions in a book of your own and read for
yourself. I am not here to learn your definitions.

Om Namo Narayanaya !!

Srikrishna
