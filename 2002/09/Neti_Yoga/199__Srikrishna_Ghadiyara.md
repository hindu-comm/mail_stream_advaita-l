If 'Advaita' implies 'Brahman', then 'Advaita' should
be a 'Noun' and not an 'adjective' right ?

But, what Sri Jaladhar is saying is that 'Advaita' is
an 'adjective' and the 'vedanta' word following is
implied, as in the 'Red' is running which is actually
supposed to express 'Red horse' is running.

Om Namo Narayanaya !!
