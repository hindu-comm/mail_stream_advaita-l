Of course it did but that's irrelevant.  The Advaita Vedanta you and I
know on September 13, 2002 is due to Shankaracharya.

The founding of these Mathas is fairly recent. Do you not

Why bother with hypotheticals?  Shankaracharya was born.  You, Ashish
Chandra, can only talk of Advaita because of him.

Because the lineage of Shankaracharya is also the lineage of the adjective
Advaita.  See my example of the word crespidopulous.

I personally can continue discussions like this for as long as it takes
until the opponent is beaten into submission :-) but as a moderator of
this list I have to think about whether the rest of the readers want to be
subject to such petty bickering.  You flat out said you don't want do any
"word dissection" which is the only objective way of deciding this so
there is no way to have a rational conversation with you about it.

Well I'm glad to hear no word dissection means some.  Here's what Aptes'
dictionary (the Sanskrit-English edition) has to say about it.  note in
particular the a. next to the word.  It means adjective.

None of these definitions necessarily have to be applied to religion.
Some cognate words are given too.

Apart from the fact Apte wrongly says Brahma instead of Brahman this
should be clear.  It is "not two" not "all is one."  There is a subtle
difference in emphasis here.  Can you see what it is?

> advaitavadin n. = advayavadin, q.v. above; a Vedantin.

Note the last definition.
