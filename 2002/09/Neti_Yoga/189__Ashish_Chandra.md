Then why does every Amnaaya matha trace its lineage (implying the lineage
of the philosophy itself) to Bhagwan Narayana? You seem to be saying that
Advaita is what Adi Shankara said it was when even he himself said he was
was reasserting the message of the eternal Vedas.

I am not going to do any word dissection. Advaita means non-dual - that
which is not-two, and that is what it means.

This doesn't even make sense. If non-dual qualifies Brahman, then it is
pointless to say that Brahman is non-dual: It obvisouly is. If non-dual
*implies* Brahman, then it is just another word for God. I have used it in
the latter sense. Advaita Vedanta, which I have not used so far, on the
other hand signifies Vedanta that seeks to establish that Brahman is non-
dual.

You know, if you can just control your fingers a little, you might be
tempted to respect saints and not write anything and everything about them.
In any case, it looks like what I meant by saint and what you were thinking
it meant were so far disconnected. Hopefully, that has now been cleared.

I thought it answers why is Sab Ek, how is it philosophically established
that there is Sab Ek and how does one remove all doubts from one's mind
that it is all Sab Ek. But "Sab Ek" does not change.

Some people don't look for the devil. It is enough for some people to be
loyal and faithful to their Guru and His techings and progress that way.

You will not be imprecise if you were not bothered by each and every
question, now would you? If some questions bother you, it does not mean
they bother everyone.

There is a reason why there have been so many debates in the philosophical
tradition - there is a need to establish one's philosophy as supreme as
also correctly interpret the Vedas. That necessitates answering each and
every objection. For example, in the beginning of Tarka Sangraha of
Annambhatta, the opponent asks why the author undertakes mangalaacharana
(worship of one's Ishta for success). If I were asked why I worship in the
morning, I would just say because it has been my tradition and moreover, I
have been advised so. No other reason is available from me and I require
none. But apparently, Annambhatta's opponent did and Annambhatta had to
answer. To say that I should start doing all that is really not my cup of
tea. I would rather grow the seed of faith than the seed of intellectual
certainty and belief. I am not in the process of winning followers, and
neither are the saints I follow.

You are probably referring to Sri Ramakrishna Paramhansa. It does not
matter whether he taught Advaita Vedanta or not. He taught Advaita, as in
God is One and He is Everything. You can read the Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna
by M. for his teachings if you haven't already.

You keep bringing up Advaita Vedanta when I am not even referring to the
teachings of Adi Shankara's school.

What I believe in is that a Sadguru will show you the correct way all the
time. It may be that you doubt him and don't believe that what he is saying
is not true. These doubts come to everyone. But if you have faith in his
words, you will gain everything. That is what the noble followers of saints
do. They have no need to announce their linkage with any former lineage.
For them, their guide is their Guru and he is God.

They are called mahapurushas, dayaalu etc. But a saint is one who is One
with God.

Well, hopefully that has been cleared up.

I think I mentioned in a previous email on a similar subject that the
Sadguru (who is none other than your own true self) will guide you no
matter how many charlatans surround you. Of course, this is not to say one
must not be careful but it will not be helpful to doubt everything and
everyone. But if that is your way, then fine. But remember to remind
yourself that that is not the only way.

It may be said that the saint is in the body to work out his/her prarabhda.
But in our general experience, a saint exists in flesh for no other reason
than to show others the true path to God. He/She does that whether in your
presence or sitting in a deep cave in the Himalayas. He will guide you no
matter where you are. That is what I have learnt.

Absolutely. And it is always flowing to everyone.

So is the fact that Dharma is still followed, that people still ask
questions about what is liberation and what is God and Who am I. To follow
the tradition you follow is very good but to be dismissive of others is no
good. It is only their grace ( I mean all the sages of past, present and
future) that Himalayan caves are still the abodes of saints.

But showing you how to earn it will. That is what saints do - show you the
correct path.

No. Rather, I am saying that if you can approach a saint only through his
grace. You have probably never sincerely asked Sri Ramakrishna to help you
or even asked him so how can you find out if he is God [well neither have I
but reading about him and meeting swamis of his order has taught me a lot
about him]? If he does not want you to know, you will never find out. So
you can decide which approach is best for you. If it is Advaita Vedanta,
then that is fine. If it is following the teachings of a saint, then that
is equally good. The questions you have can be answered by either. But to
say that it can only be done by following the teachings of Adi Shankara is
not correct.

Then this is a misconception, at least in my book. Advaita mean non-dual
and any teaching that points you towards "what" is non-dual is Advaita as
well, IMO (which I know you will not agree with).

Adi Shankar's philosophy is also called Kevaladvaita. There is also a
Shuddhadvaita (of Pushtimargis), and I am sure some other philosophies
suffixed with Advaita, now no longer prevalent, that spoke of Advaita (non
duality) in some way or another. I am sure they all differed from
Kevaladvaita. But no one today calls Advaita Vedanta as Kevaladvaita
Vedanta. Names change over history and they will continue to change. But
fortunately, the meaning of the words Advaita has not. It is that meaning I
am referring to.

No one knows how a Sadguru teaches. It is unique depending upon the
receptacle. I am sure you know this.

But those shishyas that don't ask any questions but have faith only are
also equally blessed by the Guru's grace.

I don't know because I am not sure what a smArtha is in North India,
whether everyone is a smArtha or there is one single group. But in anycase,
right from one's childhood in India, one is taught to respect saints and
holy men and believe in them. And I am sure this practice (of asking
questions of the Guru) is not exclusive to smArtha tradition - Buddhism etc
too have a very strong tradition. Perhaps implicit in this teaching i.e. to
respect and believe in saints and sadhus, is the hope that it will get you
closer to them where they, recognizing your core, will guide you
appropriately.

All the studying, philosophizing, debating etc. is only preparation for the
day when the Guru comes and takes you by the hand. Then, you need to let a
log (I had wanted to write lot but this typo is equally apt) of things go.
