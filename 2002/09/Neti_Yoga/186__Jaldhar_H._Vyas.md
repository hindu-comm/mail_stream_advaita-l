Advaita is an adjective as you well know.  If they are talking about
Advaita Vedanta then necessarily they are talking about Shankaracharyas
philosophy.

Because they use the word Advaita.

All post-Shankaracharya (and relatively recent I see.) We can presume they
heard of Advaita Vedanta through Shankaracharya.

You are the one who was insisting that they did.  I respect some saints
who are not Advaitins but as I believe Advaita Vedanta is the pinnacle of
spiritual acheivement, those saints fall short in various ways.

> Facts to be proven to who?

To the person you are making the assertion to.  When we murmur to
ourselves there is no need for facts.  But between two or more people it
becomes more important.

Not anymore I hope.  And despite some stronger messages from today, I hope
it is being set aside amicably.

We are talking about the word 'advaitin'.  We can test for the validy of
that.  And since we believe those who were Advaita Vedantins were
liberated, we can infer that those who claim to be Advaita Vedantins
 now are also liberated.

These are not objective criteria because you haven't defined them.

Then there is no truth.  nothing universal.

Everyone who uses the term Advaita Vedanta (and terms like jivanmukta
which stem from Advaita Vedanta) is a follower of Shankaracharya.  Some
are less aware or honest about it than others.

We may not practice it but we can still understand it.  Just like although
I am not qualified to practice surgery, I can understand what a doctor
does without resorting to mysticism.

How do you know he is liberated?

If we had perfect knowledge (conventional knowledge that is) there would
be no need for Advaita Vedanta as a discipline but as we don't a more
systematic approach is needed.  That's why we ask questions such as how do
we know? what is truth? etc.
