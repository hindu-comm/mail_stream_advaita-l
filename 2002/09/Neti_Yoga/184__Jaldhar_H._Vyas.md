This is precisely what I meant when I talked about the confusion that
arises from the indiscriminate use of words.

Advaitin is a shorthand for Advaita Vedantin which is synonymous with the
philosophy poularized (though not started) by Shankaracharya.  If all
these modern Gurus are jumping on the Advaita bandwagon today it is
because of Shankaracharya not some ancient alternate tradition.

Really?  Name them.  Were they prior to Shankaracharya?  Did they refer to
themselves as Advaitins?

Assertions by themselves are only hot air.  They need to be backed up with
facts to become more substantial.

Now based on facts I can think of one person who represents an independent
Advaita Vedantic philosophy -- Mandana Mishra, the author of Brahmasiddhi.
But his philosophy is extinct.  According to tradition he was converted to
Shankaracharyas' camp.

Because Ashish Chandra said so?  Without any kind of objective criteria,
it's just your word against mine, against x, against y...

Then on what grounds should he be dismissed? :-) I acknowledge that people
use language loosely.  I'm sure I've done it often myself.  But when we
are trying to philosophize, we should try and be as precise as possible.
