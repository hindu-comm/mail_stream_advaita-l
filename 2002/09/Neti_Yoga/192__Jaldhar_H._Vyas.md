*sigh* is this going to be another of these threads that goes around in
circles?  The Mathas do trace their parampara from Shri Narayana
_through_Shankaracharya_.  Who do you think founded those mathas in the
first place?

I repeat, there is no alternative Advaita lineage other than
Shankaracharyas.  There may have been in the past (e.g. Mandana Mishra)
but they are extinct now.  There were other other Advaita teachers prior
to Shankaracharya (e.g. Upavarsha, Dravidacharya, Sundara Pandya) but with
the exception of Gaudapadacharyas Karikas, their works are no longer
extent.  We know Advaita Vedanta through Shankaracharya.

Like Lewis Carrolls Humpty-dumpty you think words mean whatever you want
them to mean.  Thus it is pointless to talk to you and pointless for you
to try and learn anything.

I'll say this one last time.  Saying several approaches are valid doesn't
imply every approach is valid.  Saying several approaches are invalid
doesn't imply only one approach is valid.
