If there is a popularity contest about what the word Advaita means to most
people, then yes, most people would say it means Advaita Vedanta of Shri
Adi Shankaracharya. However, this is not a popularity contest. We have gone
over the meaning of the word advaita. These are the findings:

advaita (a.): non-dual, blismishless etc.
advaitvaadin/advayavaadin [one of the meanings]: follower of vedanta. (note
vaadin and not simply the word Advaita)

advaita from the word advaya:

advaya: non-dual etc...and then the word Buddha.

So now advaita denotes another name for Buddha through the word advaya
(please refer to Vaman Shivram Apte's dictionary).

If the word advaita implies Vedanta, then what does the word dvaita imply?

As for usage:

brahman is nirguna, brahman is ananda, brahman is advaita (non-dual, one
without a second).

How many times did you see me refer to the word Advaita Vedanta of Adi
Shankaracharya while using Advaita.

What I have been saying is that when a saint says exactly the same thing as
above, he is not necessarily referring to Adi Shankara's philosophy and
lineage.

What Jaldhar has been saying is that Advaita means Advaita Vedanta whenever
the word Advaita is used, and that any modern day teacher only uses it
because of him (Adi Shankara) and if the teaching of this saint (teacher)
does not tally with Advaita Vedanta of Adi Shankara (not in conclusion but
even in perception), then the teaching is not Advaita (as in non-dual,
blemishless Brahman/God).

Dear all aspirants who are serious about following this thread on Upadesa sahasri:

>From the beginning itself in the preliminary verses Shankara tells us about the several Sruti passages that the teacher should enquire of the desciple as to whether he is familiar with.In my opinion, we should print out the relevent Scriptural verses referred to by Shankara in full and at the same time give out the word by word meaning also for those who are interested to know and learn these verses. As rightly pointed out to Nandaji as extracted  above, these upanishad verses are indeed very addictive and should be in our thoughts when we go through Shankara's Upadaesa to us in his treatise.

Hari Om!
