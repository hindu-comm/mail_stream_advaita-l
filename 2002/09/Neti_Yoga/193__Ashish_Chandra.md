So Advaita did not exist before Adi Shankara? Or that people were not being
liberated before him? Or that this aspect of Upanishads did not exist
before Gaudapada? The founding of these Mathas is fairly recent. Do you not
know that our Dharma is Sanatan? This knowledge has always existed and if
Adi Shankara was had not been born, this knowledge would have still existed.

Who is talking about lineages? Did I not say in my last email that people
who do not follow Adi Shankara's lineage but follow saints do not care
about whether or not their lineage is connected to Shankaracharas? Then why
are you putting words in my mouth?

Well, coming from an ADMIN of this list, this remark is failry surprising.
But just to be sure, I looked up the Capeller's Digital Sanskrit Lexicon
for the word Advaita. Advaita comes from Advayatva and Advayatva means non-
duality, unity. Nowhere does it mention it is related to Vedanta or it
means Advaita Vedanta. I am equally willing to look up the Sanskrit-Hindi
Shabda Kosha by Vaman Shivram Apte and find the meaning of advaita. Why
don't you provide some reference where it says that Advaita means Advaita
Vedanta.
