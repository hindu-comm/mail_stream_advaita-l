A misconception should be cleared up here.  Just bcause Advaitins don't
believe "anything goes" it doesn't follow they only want "one approach."
There is a middle ground.  The example of English grammar is apt.  Withing
the "rigid" confines of English grammar, there is room for poetry and
technical manuals, train tickets and letters to grandma.  But if someone
chooses to speak German that isn't another approach to English, it is a
different thing altogether.
