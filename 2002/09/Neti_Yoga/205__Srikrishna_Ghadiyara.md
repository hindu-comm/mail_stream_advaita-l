You gave a long reply to my request for clarification
which was not in line with my question.

I am not part of the argument going on between you and
Sri Jaladhar.

I  said:

"> >If 'Advaita' implies 'Brahman', then 'Advaita'
> should
> >be a 'Noun' and not an 'adjective' right ?
> >"

As you took the recourse to the dictionary to resolve
the argument, I pointed out that if "Advaita" implies
Brahman, Brahman being a noun, 'Advaita' also should
be a noun.

But, even you use 'Advaita' as an 'Adjective' only.
Anyway, I understand arguments from both sides.

The only question is if "Advaita Vedanta" with the
tenets of Jiva Brahmaika Ikyam, j~nAna, j~nEya,
j~nAtru abhedatvam, whole visible universe being the
manifestation of Brahman and not separate from Brahman
-  was known and expounded before Acharya Sankara or
not. Though these are derived from the Vedas which are
eternal, was it understood in the same light before
Acharya Sankara.

Even though we can consider Acharya Gaudapada's
Mandukya Karika, his asparsa, ajAta theory seems to be
even higher, profound and different from what Acharya
Sankara expounded.

I request comments from the members.

Om Namo Narayanaya !!

Srikrishna
