No. They are talking about Advaita - There is no two, there is one. As you
well know, this is the teaching of the Upanishads and since we know the
Vedas to be eternal, this knowledge is also eternal. It cannot be that it
has stemmed from Adi Shankara, as he himself has said that he is not the
originiator, "merely" an asserter.

I am not even sure why you would use Advaita as an adjective. If it is,
then what you are saying necessarily means that Advaita is that teaching of
Vedanta which concludes in the Oneness and Unity of All. However, I am not
using it as an adjective that precedes the words Vedanta. *I think* any
teaching that says there is only One is Advaita (a-dvaita).

We are not talking about presumptions. I doubt Sri Sri Sri 1008 Neem Karoli
Baba ji maharaj ever used the term Advaita. But he always said "Sab Ishvar
Hai" "Sab Ek". That is Advaita even though it may not be technically to
your liking. After all, we do have the Advaita Vedanta school of Adi
Shankara that has painstakingly set forth the technicalities :-)

None of these saints is more or less than Adi Shankara. A saint is a saint
is a saint. They have no need to parrot what "they have heard". They are
Brahmajnanis so what is hidden from then that they may have "heard"?

No I never did that. What I am insisting is that their teching is of
Advaita (non-duality and Oneness of all) even though you may not consider
it as being so because it is not technically stipulated.

They have no need to claim that their teaching is Advaita Vedanta. It is
fairly obvious to their followers that they have taught the Unity of
everything with God.

Saint = liberated. How can there be any falling short?

My mother told me when I was a kid that Paras is a stone that turns to gold
anything it touches. I went and told my friends that Paras is such and
such. None of us had seen Paras but my mother had. Then I ran into a
Professor who had researched the stone and called his line Paras Science.
When I studied Paras science, I realized that it(Paras) has properties that
turn anything into gold through a process called Paras Process.

My mother said Paras is a stone that turns into gold anything it touches.
The professor says Paras is a stone when used in the Paras Process only
with the methodology called Paras Science, turns any substance into gold.

If one of my friends say that what my mother has talked of is not Paras,
then what should I say? My mother did not talk of Paras or that she is
wrong?

When these saints talked of One or "Sab Ek", they have talked about what
Advaita Vedanta system has philosophically established. But they have both
talked about Advaita (non-duality) only.

Agreed. There may be people who will not believe that a saint is liberated.
They are more than welcome to try and find out.

That is what I have been saying that when I use the word jivanmukta or
Advaita, it is not in the technical sense (as you probably define them) but
in recognizable terms as in jivanmukti = liberation from the bhrama of
sansara and Oneness with the Supreme. Advaita = Non duality AND Oneness of
all existence with God.

But we were talking of "Advaita" and "Advaitin". Not Advaita Vedanta -
which implies Adi Shankaracharya's school in most cases.

Ok. I agree that I am more inclined towards mysticism. But so is everyone
else. Even in the Upadeshsahasri, Adi Shankara talks to His disciple about
the body undergoing samaadhi as a fourth state, apart from the three that
everyone undergoes. How does this teaching apply to one who has no
experience of samaadhi? Why would you believe this teaching when you have
had no experience of it. You believe Adi Shankara because it Him who is
saying it. Because you have faith in the Vedas and in the Guru of the
tradition you follow. Otherwise, most of us would not be able to go beyond
this point - why should we believe there is a state called samaadhi that
the Acharya has used to demonstrate a point, when we have no personal
experience of it. The disciple too takes his Guru's word, as he should, if
I am correct in presuming that the latter has had no experience of samaadhi.

You can never find out if He does not want you to know. Never ever.
