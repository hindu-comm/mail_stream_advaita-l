I finally got a chance to look up the Sanskrit Hindi Shabda Kosha. It might
interest you to know that withing the definition for the word "advaita"
comes the "samasta pada" vaadin = advayavaadin which with a note to look up
advaya, followed by the remark "vedanta ka anuyaayi (follower of vedanta)".

So I looked up advaya as well:

advaya: (ad.) [naasti dvayam yasya] 1. do nahin (not two) 2. advitIya,
anupam (without comparison), ekmaatra (one only), name of Buddha.
samasta pada - vaadin (= advaita) (advayavaadin) 1. vishva (universe) and
brahman and prakriti and aatma - the follower for line that says they are
one. 2. Buddha.

I am sure there are many surprises for you explaining advayavadin, advaya
and relating Buddha to all this.
