Although it is knowledge, it is said to beyond everyday reason.  This is
why e.g. Shvetaketu complains to his father that despite having learned
the four Vedas, six Vedangas, itihasa-purana etc., he still doesn't
understand Brahman.  The idea is not that we shouldn't study Vedas, but
that by itself that study is not enough there is something beyond that.
