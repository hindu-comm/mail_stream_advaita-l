What I forgot to mention in my earlier mail on
Totapuri is that he was a digambara (i.e. he went
about totally naked). He had no possessions and used
to lie around in the faroff beaches of Puri. His
ashrama was built by a disciple of his and not by him.

I also hope my letter does not evoke a mail from
ADMIN. I am mentioning Totapuri only to prove my
point.

Regards
Jagannath
