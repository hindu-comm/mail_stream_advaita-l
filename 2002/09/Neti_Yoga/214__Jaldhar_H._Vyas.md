That would be acceptable if you were comparing Buddhist to Vedantin
because they are sufficiently pluralistic terms.  But even then only
careless people say "Buddhist" in a monolithic sense just as only careless
people use "Vedantin" to mean Advaitin.

In none of your posts have you established any kind of criteria as to who
is a realized soul.  So we can say very little about the content of their
teachings if any.

Hemant who is a member of this list and a follower of Aurobindo discussed
this with us a while back.  This is a good example of someone who was
actually coming from a different place (traditional Bengali tantrism) and
only adopted advaita terminology because of the intellectual climate of
his time and place. (19th century Bengal.)

Sure all kinds of meanings can be construed.  I'm sure some construe
Advaita as "the demonic ideology of the hell-bound enemies of the one true
God."  It doesn't mean such a construction is worthy of any attention
though.  Why bother with hypotheticals when there is a concrete,
historical, existent, well-accepted construction which is available right
here and now?

If they truly are novel thinkers why didn't they say "this is the doctrine
of Ein Sof" or "adsefgbyt" or something else?  They choose to use Advaita
Vedantic terminology because they have been influenced by Advaita Vedanta
ideas.  That is the source of their understanding of mystical experiences
whether they admit it or not.

The very way the idea is presented: "knowledge of Brahman"  indicates an
origin in Vedanta.  Why didn't the Aztecs speak of Brahman? Or the Chinese
or the Eskimos?  Because this is simply not part of their
intellectual/conceptual environment.  Even in India e.g. Nyaya doesn't use
terminology like Brahman except where it is influenced by Vedanta.

Now amongst Vedantins there are different stripes with different views to
choose from so there is some doubt as to which one is correct.  But if you
have already decided that Brahman and the atma is one, there is only one
Vedantic choice--Advaita Vedanta.

I thought we'd disposed of this argument before but ok here goes.  We are
not talking about those who came before Shankaracharya but *today*
September 26, 2002.  Those who know advaitam *today* owe it to
Shankaracharya.  What people long ago thought is irrelevant because it no
longer exists in our time.

No I've already documented that it was an existing formal tradition long
before Shankaracharya.  What he did was popularize it yes and *improve* it
in the sense that he made it clear and removed any doubts and opposition.
The proof of his success is that the older thinkers fell by the wayside
and their views were not propogated to succeeding generations.  There are
no other lineages.  There may have been once but not anymore.

Yes and each generation clarifies the teachings of the previous generation
for the benefit of the next.  This is not to say they were less
enlightened in former times but that the presentation was improved.
After Shankaracharya, Sureshvaracharya did with his vartikas (part of the
definition of vartika is that which provides what is missing in the
original.) Later on Vachaspati Mishra did that and so did Shriharsha,
Swami Madhusudan Saraswati, and Appaya Dikshita etc.  This way Advaita
Vedanta has built itself up over time becoming better and better.

Now if you are claiming some modern fellow thinks they understood Shruti
better than Shankaracharya or any of the other people I mentioned, by all
means lets put them to the test.  If they are right we will go over to
their way of thinking and be better for it.  But the onus is on them to
show that.

Well in the Autobiography of Jaldhar it says that I gave initiation into

If direct perception was the only means of knowledge, human knowledge
would be meagre indeed.  Luckily it isn't.

Well sure.  Who else should be doing the recognizing.  Aztecs? Eskimos?
Martians?  We were here first.  Finders keepers.  If the
johnny-come-latelys want to join in, let them follow the conventions or
justify why they want to diverge.

Incidently the importance of the prasthana trayi is high enough that even
the Gaudiya Vaishnavas who believed very much as you do eventually had to
do it.  (Baladeva Vidyabhushana, a couple of centuries after Chaitanya.)
They realized they just wouldn't be taken seriously by the Dharmic public
without it.

Because such a Guru is pretty useless in the long run.  Formalization
didn't occur just for the love of pedantry.  One must organize ones
thoughts to defeat doubt and confusion.  And with every passing year our
world grows more confusing don't you think?

I have never suggested that these lesser gurus aren't useful.  They can
be.  But they cannot take you all the way.

No it's a noun.  Look it up.  You're thinking of pavana or pavitra.  Or
perhaps Hindi usage has diverged from Sanskrit.

In some cases there is a formal body like the Academy Francaise for the
French language.  In other cases it is the dominant political or economic
elite.  (e.g. "the Queens' English")  In Sanskrit we can say it is the
consensus of learned people.

My point is that this question is badly put because there is no

Yes.  I believe for any educated person advaita means Advaita vedanta.
Nevertheless they should try and be clearer for the sake of the
uneducated.

Yes I would agree with this assessment.  The reason these arguments are
important is being in maya ourselves, we cannot simply assume Brahman and
work backwards.  We have to rely on the means of knowledge we have
available.

Apte gave an example from Bhavabhuti.  Shri Rama is described as treating
sukha and dukha as one.  The adjective advaita could be applied to any
relationship between two equal things.

Advayatva as mentioned previously is a relationship between two
things--the atma and brahman.  So we can provisionally say advayatva is in
Brahman.  but we can just as easily say it is in the atma.  At the dawn of
jnana both notions disapear.

The Buddhist idea, frankly doesn't make any sense to me.

How did that come to happen?  Do those people really not belong to
Shankaracharyas' tradition (in its widest sense by which I mean
intellectual and cultural influence.) or are they simply unaware of it?
This is why we look to history as well as just books.

Perhaps you could but why do so when there are more precise descriptive
terms available?  You could use transport to mean camel because in some
places camels are used as transport but generally people would more likely
to be thinking of cars or bicycles. "desert animal" would be more likely
to make people think of camel.

I agree.  Although I occasionally slip up I do be careful and try and say
Advaita Vedanta.  I think adding "of Shri Shankara" is redundant because
that is the only kind there is now.  And I think in the context of
philosophy for educated people at least, advaita as shorthand for advaita
vedanta is sufficiently clear but as there is some room for doubt amongst
the ignorant we have to be more precise.

If the followers of Ramakrishna claimed their teaching was advaita tantra
or something it might be acceptable but actually they describe it as
advaita vedanta and it is on those grounds I object.

The Shankaracharyas are not like the pope.  They cannot simply
excommunicate someone who is judged outside the Advaitic pale.
Neither do their followers look to them to do the thinking for them.
Their method has always been to provide the facts and let their followers
use their intelligence to draw the right conclusions.

As to the disagreements of Swami Krishnananda with Shankaracharya, I'd
like to know what they are.  Do you have references?

It matters if there is doubt about its meaning.

The "true meaning" is exactly the crux of the matter here.  If there are
doubts or divergence about the true meanings they have to be investigated
and history is one of the means of doing so.  You seemed to object to the
idea that what saints say needs to be put to the test.  I say you have to
do this otherwise doubts will just fester.

Both actually.  Historically these Babajis never even went that far into
doctrine.  Theirs is a very simple message of love and faith.

I think so too.  Nevertheless this is what is going on.

Yes (Though Schopenhauer was the one who really emphasized it not Kant.)
The reason Vivekananda was invited to the west in the first place was
because there was already sufficient interest in it to make people want to
hear from a representative. His fame is due to his ability to put these
ideas into terms the western public could understand.

Telling people won't achieve much.  I consider blindly following me to
only be a marginal improvement over blindly following someone else.  What
I'm trying to win people over to is the idea of thinking critically.  Last
weeks excerpt from "Hindu Dharma" was very apropos I think.

I've been maintaining all along that there isn't much of a difference.

So it follows that a Guru who is more understandable is better (i.e. more
