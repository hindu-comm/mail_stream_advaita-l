A bigger misconception should also be cleared - that the Dasnami (Adi
Shankara's) is the only tradition qualified to be called Advaitins. There
have been saints after saints who were Brahmajnanis and who always said All
is One. They may not have taught any classical philosophy as such but they
were Advaitins all the same. When someone talks about Advaita (or the
teachings of these saints), he may or may not be referring to the
philosophical positions of Adi Shankara's sampradaya and should not be
dismissed outright as not being representative of Advaita.
