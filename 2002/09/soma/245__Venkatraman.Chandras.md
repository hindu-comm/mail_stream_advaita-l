Sorry...:)

This is the 28th verse in "abhiraami andhaadhi".
The verse starts as "sollum poruLum ena naDamaaDum thuNaivaruDan". 

sol - word
poruL - meaning
thuNaivar - spouse (consort)

Basically abhiraama bhaTTa (17th ce.) is describing that dEvi is 
to mahESwara as meaning is to word. (this is same as kaaLidaasa's 
phrase that Sri Ramakrishnan quoted).
Since the description of both phrases is same, I didn't elaborate.

-chandrasekaran.
