> "Enlightenment" we define as "realizing what it means to be Brahman /
> Atman / God That I Am / the Self."  In short, it is our definition of

> "liberation" -- see below).

> In our system, the "inner core" is not "nothingness," but

> It is Pure Consciousness -- or, as the great mahavakya asserts, "Prajnam
> (I'm not sure of the spelling) Brahmam" ... Consciousness is Brahman.

> Pure Consciousness can reveal Itself (it is, of course, omnipresent) at

> >From our perspective, there actually is no "liberation," as advaitans.
> For that would assume there is something to be liberated FROM, no?  But
> the basis of advaita -- again, as I have learned it -- is that maya is
> delusion / a mirage / unreality ...
>
> So liberated from WHAT?  Hence, "moksha": "Freedom from deluson."

> Involuntary samadhi requires knowing what to look for in infants, but is

> These amulets -- available for all to see, hold and experience the
