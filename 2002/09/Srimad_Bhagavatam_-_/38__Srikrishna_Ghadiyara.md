Hari Om !!

Swami Tejomayananda taught complete Srimad  Bhagavatam in English while he
was the acharya at Chinmaya Mission, San Jose. The complete recording is
into 111 cassettes. Each lecture is about 1 hour. As you all know Swami
Tejomayananda sings beautifully.

Those of you who may be interested can obtain the cassettes from Chinmaya
Mission, San Jose. Each cassette sells for $5. You can send a mail to
shiva_charan at hotmail.com  or you can let me know, and I will gather any
other info.

If someone is in the SFO Bay area, and would like to listen, they can
borrow the cassettes from me as well to taste the sweetness.

Om Namo Narayanaya !!

Srikrishna
