It should be obvious from reading his words, that the way he wants to read
the texts is precisely according to the original authors.  So he would not
view this as a constraint I don't think.

Yes that's true.  It should be noted that there is a danger in the
prakaranas too (especially from later authors) that too much is assumed
which can also lead readers astray.

The way I approach the shastras is as a record of the experiences of
jnanis.  One has to literally get into a text as if one were a character,
join in the debates as if sitting right there.

I have a big problem with accepting limitations because most people are
too ready to do this.  If Brahman is without limit and we want to become
one with Brahman, how can thinking of limits help?  Some of our great
Rshis have been arrogant.  When King Janaka offered a 1000 cows to the one
who could best explain Brahmavidya, Maharshi Yajnavalkya strod in and
claimed them while others hung back.  That is the arrogance bornof
confidence and there is nothing wrong with it in my book.  Sure we may not
be living the proper way of life right now but that doesn't mean we never
will or there aren't substantial steps we can take in that direction.

I would substitute the Vedanta Paribhasha of Dharmaraja Adhvarindra but
that's just my personal opinion.

I would add the Brahmasutrabhashya despite its' volume and less organized
nature.  After all the rest of Advaita Vedanta revolves around it.

I would also suggest that anyone who really wants to understand Advaita
Vedanta in context familiarize themselves with karmakanda.
