Dear Kiran,
   Don't you feel a void during deep-sleep? It's a good
feeling upon waking up.. But that wouldn't in the least
compare with the realisation-state that is described in
scriptures.

   Regards,
   chandrasekaran.

How do we know for sure that Revelation is really
being obstructed? How do we know that that itself is
not the Realized state? Is it only because after
coming back to the normal (waking) state the person
reverts to his ajnAna?

Dhanyavaad
