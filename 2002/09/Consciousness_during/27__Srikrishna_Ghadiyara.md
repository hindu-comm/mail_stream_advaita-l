For any Knowledge of an object to take place, there
should be a Vritti of the similar 'qualities' in the
mind. i.e a Vishayakara Vritti.

Similarly, for the Absolute knowledge there should be
a Brahmakara Vritti. When mind itself is dormant,
there is no Vritti, and hence no Jnana.

In a wakeful state, when the mind is quietened i.e
silenced of the others vrittis, this Jnanakara vritti
takes place, and having 'enlightened' the subject, the
vritti itself dies away. After wards there is no
dependence on the Vritti any more.

These ideas are presented in Atma Bodha, and
Laghuvasudeva Mananam.

Om Namo Narayanaya !!

Srikrishna
