Dear Chandra,

Your limited understanding is right. It is the inner
consciousness which says, "I was asleep."

We do meet the inner self in deep sleep. That is why
we wake up refreshed and energised. The self does not
shine because we do not make the conscious effort to
know it in deep sleep.

Physically the mind is not dead during deep sleep, it
only withdraws itself. Otherwise there would be no
mind on waking up.

I have already written to you regarding after death
experiences. So I cannot agree that there is a void
after death which has to be activated by a mantra.
However kind souls can indeed guide the departed soul
to a favourable rebirth. I also agree that ordinarily
the person forgets his past on rebirth. But there are
also cases of persons remembering their past lives. we
have that wonderful quote in the Gita where the Lord
reminds Partha of his previous births.

There is a Buddhist text which deals in the
intermediary state between death and rebirth. However
the soul must be conscious in life itself to
successfully negotiate this interim state.

Regards
Jagannath
