Dear Chandra/Roger,

I don't think that either coma or death leads to a
void. The mind continues to remain active in a
coma/after death. I have read instances of comatose
people coming out of the state and narrating their
experiences and also about near death experiences
where the person survives clinical death. I have read
some very interesting and practical views on the
subject by Swami Abhedananda and Sadhu J P Vaswani.
Both their narrations are in total conformity with
intuitive medical opinion on the subject.

Regards
Jagannath
