Dear Roger,

Yes. My question is at a mundane level where birth and death are within 
the purview of our saadhana and our ponderings. So, even if we say there 
is no birth, no one taking birth, no one needing liberation etc., etc., 
still at the vyavahaarika level, I tend to expect the same experience in 
coma and death.

I am copy-pasting a portion from the following website.

     This piece of information tends to clarify my doubt a little. 
Post-death state is in fact a void where the subtle body goes into a 
momentary shock and debility, becoming dormant. The vibrations of the 
mantras give it activity and show the way for its future lives.

     Regards,
