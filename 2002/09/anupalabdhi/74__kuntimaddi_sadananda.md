Vidya - I agree with most of your comments. However, don't you think
the expected absence (saadhya) is based on some hetu ( I gave example
of the absence shoes) and there has to be vyaapti based on prior
perceptual knowledge or experince.  Otherwise the expectation will
not have any basis for it to be a pramaaNa - it will only be a
speculation rather pramaaNa or source for valid knowledge. In that
sense I canot disagree with other achaarya-s that anupaladdi is close
relative of anumaana pramaaNa.  True one can find certain
distinctions between the two to justify it as separate pramaaNa.
There is some inference involved that is the expected absence based
on some valid reason for that expectation. The validation should be
based on some drishTanta and as I see all the ingradients similar to
anumaana pramaana - hetu, saadhya, vyaati and dRitshhTanta- involved
in anupalabdi too for it make it as pramaaNa, a valid source for
knowledge.

Hari OM!
