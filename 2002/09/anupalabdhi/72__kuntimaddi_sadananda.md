As I understand:
anupalabdi, as well as arthaapatti are somewhat close degenerate
forms of anumaana pramaaNa only, at least as per other achaarya-s.

Absence of a thing established by the absence of another is
considered as anupalabdi.

For example - I conclude that she is absent in the temple since her
shoes are absent outside the temple. The absence of the shoes is
'hetu' and conclusion of her absence in the temple  is ' saadhya'.
This follows a concomitant relation between the hetu and saadhya -
that is based on previous experience - there is relation between her
shoes and her presence.  That relation is the vyaapti or vyaapti
j~naanam -that relation is expressed as whenever her shoes are not
there (outside the temple), she must not be there inside the temple.
(expressed positively of course - whenever her shoes are there
outside, she is there in side the temple - Although the converse also
has to be true - but for anupalabdi it is mostly expressed as abhaava
or non-cognition - and in this present example her non-presence in
the temple due to non-cognition of the shoes outside the temple. In a
way it is somewhat related to logical deduction or anumaana pramaaNa.
