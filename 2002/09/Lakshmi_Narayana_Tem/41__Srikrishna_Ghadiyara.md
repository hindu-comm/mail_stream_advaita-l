Does it mean that I can consult any 'Vaishavite'
practice/tradition for construction and daily worship
?

What is the Agamic tradition followed in Kanchi Matha
?

But, once you let a Vaishnavite priest start worship,
he pushes away all the inclination towards Advaitic
thought. Am I right ?

If Sanka was not against the Bhagavata's Agamas, why
did he or what did he systamatise in terms of worship
?

Om Namo Narayanaya !!
