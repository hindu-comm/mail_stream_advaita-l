By inside the kamakshi temple is meant within the precincts of the temple [one of the inner prakaras in this case ].Tracing the origins of many temples like kanchi/shringeri would definitely lead us to Bauddha/Jaina / Kapalika/kalamukha roots!! Hence my query is limited to current practice [ ie in the last few centuries]

>>Secondly, perhaps Ms Vidya will talk of the agama followed in the Kamakshi Amman temple.
I would like to know this too.Do the kanchi and shringeri temples follow the kAmikAgama and what exactly is meant by vaidika rituals.

However I remember reading this someplace.[I am unable to reproduce the exact reference].In some of the agamic texts/(agama or a paddhati) it  is explicitly stated that for the pratishta/other details of a Vishnu idol as "For further details refer the pancharatra"
