Actually, it doesn't! I am not even sure there are standardized rules about
temple construction and consecration that would be applicable across the
whole advaita tradition. There is much room for local variation.

As for saying X temple follows advaita, I would not say that unless the said
temple is completely under the management and control of an advaita lineage.
