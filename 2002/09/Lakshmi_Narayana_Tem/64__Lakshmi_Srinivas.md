Dear Vidya,

Thank you for your informed responses. Like you rightly point out, the
impact and lasting influence of a distingushed samnyasin's caturmasya on
the people around him can really be underestimated.

And by the way, I am not very interested in origins of (various deities in)
our temples. I am more than happy to accept them in their present shape and
personalities.

Warm Regards,

Lakshmi Srinivas
