In this context it would be interesting to note that tirunilattingal tundam, and kalvanoor two of the 108 mangalashasana stalas is located right inside the Kanchi Ekamreshwara temple and the Kamakshi temple respectively.I understand that the vaikhAnasa and the Pancaratra tradition are not followed here.

What then is the protocol followed here?
