Taittiriya Upanishad?

There have been various controversial stances on the Pancharatra
Agamas. Yamunacharya argues for the Vedic-ness of these texts in the
Agama-prAmANya, but in the commentary on the utpatty-asambhava-
adhikaraNa, Sankaracharya refers to the fact that Pancharatrins of
his time themselves considered their tradition to be independent.

I do agree. Even the mahabharatha praises the pancharatra. Will post
references in the evening.
