Hari Om !!

only. I will try and contact the people at Sringeri
mata at Parvathipuram, Guntur, as listed in the
Sringeri website.

Om Namo Narayanaya !!

Not true. The Taittiriyopanishad safe vouches the pancharatra and
pashupatha agamas as vedic. The pancharatra evolved around the same
time as the vedas did. They are considered a smrithi since Narayana
himself reveals it over a period of five nights and hence the name
pancha-ratra (five-nights). I will provide reference in particular if
some one wants me to, since I figure this topic might not be very
important to this list.

The best books on Pancharatra or for that matter the south indian
agamas in general were published by TTD. Here are two which you might
want to refer to:

1.) South Indian Agamas by Dr.V Varadachary
2.) Pancharatra Agama (this is a recent book by the same author). It
is available from Tirumala Tirupathi Devasthanams publications.

I have the second book with me and I would be glad to lend it to you
for reference if you need.

Shankara basically rejects the classification of the Vyuha avatAras
of Vishnu. You might want to read this article:

That depends on lot of factors. The Agamas are to be considered as
smrithi, albeit they are out of the prasthana traya per se. More so
the acceptance of the agama depends on the tradition. The Sri
Vaishnava sampradaya accepts both the vaikhanasa and the pancharatra
to be equally valid.

Malolan
