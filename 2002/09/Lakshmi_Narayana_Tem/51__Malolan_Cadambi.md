Must be an extension of the Shaiva Agamas and the Agamas followed by Amman Temple. I guess narAyana would be treated as a minor diety and not param. For example, there is a vigraha of Maheshwara in Ahobilam in honor of composing the Mantarajapada Stotram on Narasimha. Maheshwara is treated as a baddha jIvatma and a great votary of the lord in Sri Vaishnva tradition. I guess the same protocol which would include narayana as a votary of Maheshwara or Kamakshi amman would be followed in the temples you mentioned.

P.S It will take sometime for me to track the exact verse in Taiitiriya Aranyakam(correction on the last post where i said Taiitiriya Upanishad) which refers to the Pancharatra as a vedic sect. Jaldhar also found some references in the Shatapatha Brahmana of the Shukla Yajur Veda. There are lots of references in the Mahabharata Shanti Parva on Pancharatra and pashupata agamas.
