Namaskaram to all.
 What started out as a rather innoucous question seems to morph itself into something totally different now -  as interesting as this subject matter is, we seem to be digressing from the main theme of our list; and this is not just with this one topic but other recent ones as well. May I please request members to concentrate more on teachings of shankara in this list please? I am sure there are several interesting lists out there on the web for these interesting questions and speculations, and all list members can follow these there. I write this as a list member. Thanks to all for your attention.
bhava shankara desikame sharaNam
Vaidya.
