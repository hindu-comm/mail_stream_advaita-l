Vidya,

The basis for personal worship comes out clearly in your responses to Sri
Ghadiyaram's original questions.

But I am not clear if construction, consecration of temples and the
execution of rituals therein have been addressed. For example, does it make
any sense at all to say that X temple follows advaita or Y agama is
accepted by advaitins?

Thanks in advance,

Lakshmi Srinivas
