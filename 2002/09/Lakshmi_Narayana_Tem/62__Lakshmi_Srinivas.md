Vidya,

I think this discussion has got unduly sidetracked. (pace Vaidya Sundaram).
I append my original question and your (Sri Vidya's) response above.

My point was that since performance of vaidika ritual is formally relegated
to the realm of vyavahara, in what way is temple related activities a
strict part of advaita tradition? I refer of course to the well known
dictum 'vyavahaare BhaaTTah, paramaarthe zaamkarah'.

Thanks in advance,

Lakshmi Srinivas
