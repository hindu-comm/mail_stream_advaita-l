Famous mandirs like Tirupati follow Vaishnava Agamas and Smartas don't
have any problem having Bhagavan Venkateshwar as their ishtadeva do they?

You would have to ask them.  I do know they have funded schools for both
Vaishnava and Shaiva archakas.

I don't see why this has to be the case.  And who says you can't push
back?  I attend a Vaishnava (Pushti Margi) mandir and I don't have any
problems with it.  My daily worship at home is another matter entirely and
I wouldn't let anyone interfere with that.
