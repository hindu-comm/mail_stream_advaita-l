Anyone can make a claim.  The question is, is that claim valid?  Since
there is a direct and unbroken chain of disciples of Shankaracharya that
exists upto today, we shouldn't have to guess.

Well I fully support getting rich.  It doesn't make me Bill Gates.

What if someone thought going out in the street and randomly stabbing
people led to the same place.  Would you accept it?

Don't laugh.  Not long ago some people though crashing a plane into a
building was a spiritual science.

Yes and if you also read the Vedantic shastras you will also see the
differences.  Here are some differences:

1. Buddhism holds consciousness is a momentary (kshanika) construct while
Advaita Vedanta says it eternal, continuous and pure.

2. Therefore for the Buddhist self is just the same as ego an -- unreal
concept.  Advaita Vedanta says the self is the same as Brahman and the
only real thing.

3.  For Buddhists ignorance (avidya) cause the mind to create unreal
things.  For Advaitins ignorance causes what is real to be mistaken as
unreal and vice-versa.

4.  The goal of Buddhism is extinction (nirvana) of the self.  The goal of
Advaita Vedanta is perfect knowledge (jnana) which can occur even while
alive.  This leads to the notion of self to be increased to cover all
things.

I totally reject the notion that there is some seperate species called
"westerner" who needs special treatment.  Heck for that matter I'm a
westerner too.  I was born in England and grew up there and in the US. But
really notions such as east or west only made sense when the Earth was
flat.  I've seen right here on this least people of non-Indian origin who
were capable of understanding Advaita Vedanta -- if they made the effort.

In India when someone is unfamiliar with Sanskrit or Tamil or Urdu, they
are not coddled, they are called illiterate and are expected to go and
learn what they don't know.  "Westerners" are quite capable of doing the
same.  They teach Sanskrit at UNC for instance.

No.  dogma gets a bad name sometimes.  It is easy to point out examples of
what happens when people get excessively dogmatic.  But is no dogma any
better?  Why are we both following the dogma of English grammar for
instance?  If 1000 people all wrote English as they pleased.  There would
be chaos.  In the same way, Advaita Vedanta and the terminology it uses
mean specific things.  There may be some legitimate differences of opinion
but that doesn't mean *all* opinions must be respected.

Just because someone has an interpretation doesn't mean it is worth
anything.

That's just it, it isn't the classical interpretation.

Did you read the link I mentioned in my last mail?  Now *that* is the
classical interpretation as you or anyone else can verify by learning
enough Sanskrit to read the Brhadaranyakopanishadbhashya for themselves.
Or you can see that this is the view held by Advaitins in the 5th century,
and the 10th century and the 15 century as well as today.  Do you know the
historicity of your sources?

This is what is known as objectivity, reason based on facts not
"conjectures".  If all we have are conjectures then we can never have a
civilized discussion only a shouting match.

Your group are entitled to believe what they like.  The question is does
Advaita Vedanta consider it correct?  The answer is no.

First some definitions.  Samadhi is the state of balance of the three
gunas causing the mind to remain calm and unperturbed.  (See the
vyasabhashya on yogasutra 1.1-2)  For classical Yoga which is a dualistic
system, this is it because once ones mental functions have been arrested
(not necessarily destroyed) the purush or soul that has been imprisoned in
material nature (prakrti) is free of its bonds.  Note even in the Yogic
view, the Purush or Atma is an observer or witness (sakshi)  See yogasutra
1.3 -- drshta here literally means seer or observer.

Samadhi can be savikalpa (with mental constructs) or nirvikalpa (without
them.)  From the Advaita Vedanta point of view, (I noticed you used the
term yoga vedanta but careful readers should know the two were once
seperate darshans and their concepts are not always interchangeable,)
nirvikalpa samadhi is nice to have (just as it is easier to do philosophy
in a mansion than a shack) but it is really orthogonal to jnana.  Jnana
occurs when the observer extends his gaze to all things and has the
cognition that all those things are in reality the same and not other than
his own self.  This incidently is the meaning of "you are that"
-- Tattvamasi.  It is not dualistic because you (tvam) and that (tat) are
the same. In other words it is the asi which is important.

It's not confusing.  i'm 100% sure you're wrong.

I am familiar but it still wouldn't hurt to get a review.  I'd expect the
reviewer to do his homework before giving me any though. :)

Like philosophers the world over, Advaitins also spent a lot of time on
pramanashastra (epistomology.) They found that "convictions" are a very
poor basis for a search for truth because the easiest person to hoodwink
is yourself.

If you didn't mean amrit than you shouldn't have called it amrit.  this is
why people are having trouble understanding you.   Words have accepted
meanings but you use them any which way.

And no I'm not impressed a whole lot by miracles.  The mere existence of
this universe in its variety is miraculous enough for me.  i'm not
prepared to count them out entirely though.  Basically they are an
irrelevant distraction to the true purpose of Vedantic sadhana.

I have no problem with Sai Baba himself.  As I said I accept him for what
he is.  It's some of his followers.  Mmembers of my own family are his
followers and I interact with many other Sai devotees on a daily basis.
Appreciating the good things about them shouldn't mean gullibly accepting
everything.  After all viveka is the cardinal Advaitic virtue.
