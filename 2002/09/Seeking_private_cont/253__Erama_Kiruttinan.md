Namaste.
It seems that the real purpose of Michael's mail is nothing but pure
business.He just wants to promote his outfit.
So it would be better if he is kept out of this list.
As far as I'm concerned, I have learnt a lot and am learning a lot from the
discussions in this list.
Keep it up!

Eraama
