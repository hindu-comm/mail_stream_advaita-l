It is to be noted that in the classic Advaita definition of a guru, one of
the qualities mentioned is : the ability to refute false views and teach the
truth through right arguments.

The intellect is very vital till a stage - "without the right conception of
the truth, the truth cannot be attained". Only when you know for sure what
needs to be done, then you can do away with intellectual enquiry.
