vedAnta occurs in the upanishads themselves, e.g. vedAnta-vijnAna
sunishchitArthAn ... The word advaita is in mANDUkya kArikA - advaitam
budhyate tadA. One might say it is implicit in the bRhadAraNyaka
statement, yatra tu dvaitam iva bhavati ... yatra tv asya sarvam ...
Clearly dvaita is contrasted with a state of no-dvaita in this passage,
but the word advaita is not explicitly used.

A good reference work for other quotations is Hajime Nakamura's History of
Early Vedanta.
