Jaldhar. 
 Do you see any error messages or back ups on the mail server? I just got 
this email from a new member, Michael Blate. 
Thanks, 
Vaidya.

Hello and namasté -- I have tried to reply to the Advaita list at the
e-ddress in the "Cc:" line, but have had my e-mail returned twice.  Is
there a problem or am I, perhaps, doing something wrong?  I use WebTV --
would this make a difference.  I saw you had posted my introductory
letter last week, to which someone had commented.  I then tried to
respond to that person, but have seen nothing in the list, to date.
This is in addition to the two "bounce-backs" I received upon trying to
post a query to the list.  Many thanks and namasté ...
