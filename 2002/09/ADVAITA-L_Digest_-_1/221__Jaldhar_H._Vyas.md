You might find it easier to get a free account from hotmail or yahoo or
someone.

All of them.  I agree that Advaitins espouse tailoring teaching to fit the
needs of the student but nevertheless they also have a responsibility to
steer them in the right way and they can't do that by sending them in the
opposite direction.  Even those teachings of Shankaracharya which as a
concession to human frailty do not directly teach vairagya and jnana aim
to bring the aspirant to vairagya and jnana as quickly as possible.

I'm sure my mother has this book.  I'll ask her to look it up for me.

I believe Stig answered this perfectly.

The goal of Advaita Vedanta is for freedom from samsara.  It it brings
peace and contentment on the way that's just a fortunate byproduct as Stig
said.

Have you ever wondered why in Hinduism Gods are often shown in a ugra
(terrifying) form like Kali Ma or Bhairava or Narasimha Bhagawans?  It is
not so the worshipper should worship God out of fear but a reminder that
Gods' nature is more complex than the cheap sentimental way we often look
at Him.  truth should trump comfort every time.

Mind or no-mind is hardly a minor detail.  It's great big Himalaya-size
difference that has far-reaching consequences.

Vivekanandas' connection to Advaita Vedanta is more tenuous then his
followers would like to believe.  But that dead horse has been severely
beaten already so I'm not going to bring it up again.  Please the archives
for the thread "Jagat Satya" from earlier this month.

I never said there can't be valid differences of opinion, only that yours
is invalid.

Many other Hindu religions also believe in an avatar/bhakta relationship
and they aren't Advaita Vedanta. It's a particular kind of relationship we
are interested in.

Again Samadhi is not the goal of Advaita Vedanta.

If as you claim, you've read the Brahmasutrabhashya, you will have noticed
that Shankaracharya expends a lot of energy attacking the ideas of
Buddhists and other schools.  The same on the Buddhist side.  Buddhists
like Dharmakirti and Dinnaga also developed logical reasoning to a high
degree.  Even the Dalai Lama that icon of tolerance criticizes Advaita
Vedanta in his book "The Opening Of The Wisdom Eye." All very politely of
course--he has no intention of starting a crusade against us.  But he
feels we fall short of the mark just as we feel Buddhism falls short of
the mark.

There are many people who are qualified to teach it.  Perhaps not as many
as before but enough.  It's not their fault if people would rather take
shortcuts than look for them.
