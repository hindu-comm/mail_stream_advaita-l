There is no rule against quoting those people.  Do mention them if they
are relevant.  Just realize that more often than not, they won't be.

Well Shankaracharya had four major disciples who he placed in charge of
four maths in the different corners of India who had their own disciples
and so on until the present day.

Shankaracharya produced numerous written works.  There is some controversy
over the minor ones but there is enough information in the ones that are
unanimously considered genuine to get a good picture of what Shankaraharya
believed.

There is the accounts of Advaita Vedanta in the polemical treatises of
rival schools.

There is the testimony of foreign visitors to India such as Al-Biruni,
missionaries, colonial administrators etc.

All of these make it quite easy for us to be sure of what Advaita Vedanta
teaches.

He is not exactly a historical figure though where exactly the dividing
line is between myth and history is very much up in the air.  But sure, we
claim him as one of us.
