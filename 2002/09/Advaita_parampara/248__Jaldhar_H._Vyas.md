And it is that formality and clarity which counts.  Other kinds of
Vedantins also claim their descent from Shri Narayana, Upanishadic Rshis
such as Yajnavalkya etc. as their own.  we can claim and counter-claim but
we really can't prove it either way.  It's only with Gaudapadacharya and
Shankaracharya that we can really establish Advaita parampara on a
historical footing.  I've also given the names of a few earlier advaitins
on advaita-l but their particular parampara no longer exists except
through Shankaracharya.  If others were able to grasp Advaitic teachings
however poorly it has been due to Shankaracharya.  Else we would be able
to trace their ideas through history.  We can't.

A side question:

We recite: sadAsiva samarambham ....
also, I know based on Bhagavata tradition, we believe
Lord Narayana taught Sanaka, Sanandana rishis.

What is the reconciliation between these two
statements ?

If I understand your question correctly, you are asking if our parampara
stems from Shiva Bhagavan or Vishnu Bhagavan?

The answer is both.  They are one and the same!  I believe once Swami
Chandrashekhara Bharati was asked about the usage of Om Namo Narayana by
Dashanami sannyasis.  He replied that it was only parabrahman being
referred to who manifests as Brahma, Vishnu, and Mahesha.
