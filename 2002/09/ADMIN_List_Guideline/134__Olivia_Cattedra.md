Namaste Ken,

If it is useful for you, or anybody, I made a transaltion of the Upadesha
into spanish. It took me many years, many other years it was unpublished and
this year I made a little particular edition. I take in account the two
translations yuou mention, plus the one of Sengaku Makeda, and other
specific bibliographies.
regards
Olivia
