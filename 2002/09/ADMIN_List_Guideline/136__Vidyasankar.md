Sorry for the late follow-up. I am only now going through a large backlog
of mails on the list.

It is gratifying to note that translations into languages other than
English are progressing and appearing in print, if only slowly. I can well
appreciate the difficulties involved in getting these texts and
translations published. If you can share bibliographic details of your
recent edition with us, I can update the biblio page on our home page.

Best regards,
Vidyasankar
