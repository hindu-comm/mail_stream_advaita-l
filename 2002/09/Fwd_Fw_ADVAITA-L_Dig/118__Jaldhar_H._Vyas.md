So you made it all up?  Advaita Vedanta is about the conquest of delusion.
If you're just going to make things up why even bother giving it some
fancy eastern name?

And after your neti yoga, they will still be unfamiliar with Advaita
Vedanta. (Advaita incidently is an adjective not a noun.)  You are doing
westerners an injustice by assuming they need special treatment.

"Not this" does not mean what you think it does.
See:

for an explanation.

We've recently had posts on this topic too.  See:
http://lists.advaita-vedanta.org/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind0207e&L=advaita-l&F=lf&S=&P=401

and other posts in the threads "Samadhi" and "Tenets of Samkhya".

Once again, samadhi doesn't mean what you think it means.

I don't see based on your description what you are doing to become free
from delusion.  Rather this no-mind state seems like pure escapism, an
attempt to just block ones ears and sing la-la-la rather than deal with
the problem.

You are mixing words from all over the place that have specific meanings
The state of one without a second isn't no-thing-ness.  There is exactly
one thing.  I doubt very much the Buddhists believed that.

Consciousness is always present even for the stupidest person.  There is
no question of it revealing itself or not.  The goal of Advaita Vedanta is
to remove the false superimpositions upon pure consciousness.  This cannot
be a hit or miss afair but must be complete and permanent.

No you said it was no-mind.

Again the words you quote have no relation to what you're trying to say.

Not according to Advaita Vedanta.  Consciousness always is pure.  It is
ignorance (avidya) that causes false superimpositions upon it.  That
ignorance is dispelled through the same means of knowledge (perception,
inference, scriptural testimony etc.) as any other field of human
endeavor.  So you can see not having a mind is a rather severe disability
to Advaitic sadhana.

Maya is avidya.  So rather than unreality, a better translation would be
misapprehension.

Somehow I think we can do better than the state of a chicken.

That samadhi is worthless because it doesn't last and it is outside our
control.  If you look at the threads I mentioned earlier, you'll see that
samadhi is really quite orthogonal to the goals of Advaita Vedanta.  At
best it gives you a stable platform to continue the contemplation of
Brahman without distractions.  (Assuming you still have a mind to
contemplate with.)

Amrit is the necter of immortality.  So a simple test if the liquid is
Amrit (and not sugar water or something as I suspect) is to see if the
orphans are immortal or not.

My mother is an ardent devotee of Satya Sai Baba since 1967.  The local
Sai group has had bhajans at my apartment.  I appreciate Sai Baba for who
he is.  but that doesn't mean I accept every extravagant claim his
followers make.  It's the equivalent of the snake-handling pentecostals in
your neck of the woods.  There is a lot of true faith mixed with a lot of
baloney.  You should be a bit more skeptical about things you read.
