Infact in my opinion Upadesha Sahasri is a must read for all serious
Advaitins. While Shankara might follow Baadaraayana's line of
Vedaantic exposition in his Shaareeraka Bhaashyam and thus restrict himself,
the Upadesha Saahasri is a work where Shankara has full freedom to expound
Advaita as he wishes. Also while the BSB is volumnious, the Upadesha
Saahasri is short and concise - so much more accessible. The work being
recognized as a genuine work of the aachaarya, especially in the chapter
"Tat tvam asi" contains such profound understanding of the Self and self,
which I've not observed in works like Atma Bodha or Vivekachoodaamani. Very,
very essential reading.
