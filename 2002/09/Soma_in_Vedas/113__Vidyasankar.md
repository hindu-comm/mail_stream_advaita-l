One has to be careful with words, how they are derived and what they mean.
soma = moon, with a short "a" at the end of soma. It is not derived as sa +
uma. Indeed, umA has a long "a" vowel sound.

Siva is also called somAskanda, i.e. sa + umA + skanda, when depicted
together with Parvati and Karttikeya. This derivation is different from the
name somashekhara.
