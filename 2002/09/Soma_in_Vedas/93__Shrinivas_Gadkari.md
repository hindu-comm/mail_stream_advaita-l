Namaste,

In vedic literature we often encounter the term "soma".
Some people take it to mean sap of some plant.

"soma" = "s" + "om", that which accompanies "om", or
that which we take in with "om". "soma" represents the
"Ananda" / "Sakti". Pure "Ananda"/"Sakti" reveals the
state of "turIya" and hence "soma" is closely connected
with the "shiva" tattva - the goal of advaita.
