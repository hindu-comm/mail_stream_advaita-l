namaste,

>"soma" = "s" + "om", that which accompanies "om", or
>that which we take in with "om".

I'm not an expert on sanskrit grammar, but I think the above sandhi may be
wrong. "sa" means accompanying, not "s". Therefore "soma" can be split as
"sa" + "uma" ("a" + "u" = "o") or "accompanying uma". Soma can therefore be
a name for Lord Shiva (as in Somaskandaparameshwara).
