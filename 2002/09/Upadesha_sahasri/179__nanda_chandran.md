The third chapter is only a repitition of the conclusions arrived in the
earlier chapter - and it doesn't seem to be part of the teacher-student
dialogue. It seems to be a "summing up" by the author.

But in the end of the second chapter, which is the dialogue between the
student and the teacher, both the student and teach affirm that the student
has attained brahmavidhya by understanding the exposition of brahma vidhya
by the teacher.

How Mimamsa is Esteemed
from Mimamasa - Karmamarga, Hindu Dharma

      Mimamsa is of great help in understanding the meaning of the Vedic texts. For this reason many scholars, including those opposed to its karmamarga, have made a thorough study of it and also written books on it. Raju Sastri of Mannargudi (Tanjavur district), who was an outstanding Vedantin, Venkatasubba Sastri of Tiruvisanallur, Nilamegha Sastri of the same place, Krsnamacariyar of Rayampettah, Krsnatatacariyar, Cinnasvami Sastri of Nandakullatur, and so on, were "scholar-lions" who made a deep study of Mimamsa. Ironically enough, Tiruvisanallur Ramasubba Sastri was opposed to sacrificial rites. However, though he was against the srauta karma that is such an important part of Mimamsa, he was impressed by the theoretical excellence of the system and was himself recognised as an authority on the subject.

 The Sanskrit College, Mylapore, Madras, has produced outstanding mimamsakas.





Note:
Hindu Dharma is a translation of two volumes of the well known Tamil Book "Deivatthin Kural", which, in turn, is a book of 6 volumes that contains talks of His Holiness Sri Chandrasekharendra Saraswathi Mahaswamiji of Kanchipuram. The entire book is available online at http://www.kamakoti.org/ .
