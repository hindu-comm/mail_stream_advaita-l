I am a business attorney, 62 yrs old. I have been studying religion and
philosophy for the past 50 yrs, and I am especially interested in
advaita-vedAnta. I have had many personal religious experiences that
indicate to me that this is the true explanation of reality and the human
condition. I meditate each morning upon arising, and I constantly try to
gain more enlightenment. I will probably listen more than I will speak.
