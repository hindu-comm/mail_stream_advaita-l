Namaste,

As a child I have been exposed to the different nuances of sanatana
dharma. I have had the good fortune of the august company of saints and
seers who have made a difference to mankind in a big way. In my recent
quest for some mystifying questions, discussions with a friend led me to
your discussion group. In an effort to put to use any knowledge resulting
as an interaction with your esteemed group, I have subscribed to
Advaita-L. Most of the principles and practices in my life bear strong
correspondence to the basic tenets of advaita vedanta and I would like to
investigate further.

Regards, Krishna
