Just being disembodied is not enough.  There must also be the positive
knowledge of the identity of Self and Brahman.  Or else e.g. Kamadeva who
was burnt to ashes by Shiva Bhagavan would have gotten moksha.

Shankaracharya does acknowledge the possibility of krama mukti where one
sits at the feet of the Lord (and presumably learns jnana there.)  At the
pralaya, both the jiva and Ishwara will be reabsorbed into Brahman.

The Brhadaranyakopanishad says of the jnani "He goes hence never to
return"  So there is no question of return from moksha.  The brahmasutras
do say there are certain beings who have divine tasks and continue to
assume bodies until those tasks are done.  I'll try and dig up the
reference for you.

Yes.

I wouldn't even say he had those aims.  They were byproducts of his quest
for moksha.
