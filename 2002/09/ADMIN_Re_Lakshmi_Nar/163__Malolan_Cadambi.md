Sorry for taking the topic out of scope. However, I enjoyed reading Vidya's
mail on the presence of a sanyAsi in a divya kshetra such as puri. Thanks
for that. At this point, I wish to ask if any acharya in the advaita
sampradaya (pre and post sankaran) has enunciated rules for temple worship?
Usually a 'nitya grantham' or a raksha grantham should be a very important
sookthi in a sampradyam. Any information on this will be greatly
informative.
