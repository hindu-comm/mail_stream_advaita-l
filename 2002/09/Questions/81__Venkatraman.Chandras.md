There is not even that "knowledge of nothing". It's actually total nescience.

IMHO, consciousness, unlike the antakaraNa-s, cannot leave any memory 
imprints. So usually a person coming out of deep-sleep or coma-state, 
hardly knows how long (not even roughly) he was in that state. A person
could remain in coma-state for several weeks.. But when he comes out of
it, in the end, he won't even think that he was out for an hour. It would 
really seem only like a wink. But this really doesn't refute the "existence 
of Brahman in all states" since Brahman is all-pervading all the time.

  Regards,
  chandrasekaran.
