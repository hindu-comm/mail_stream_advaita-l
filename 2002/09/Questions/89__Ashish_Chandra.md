If I understand you correctly, then there would be no rememberance of the
deep sleep state - not even the affirmation that "I did not know anything"
or "I don't remember anything". I am not saying that this happened to the
consciousness; rather, mind percieved its own absence because memory was
absent. How did it percieve its absence (or dormancy)? How did it know that
its modifications were absent? That is the print that is left on the
antahkarana that can (perhaps) tell us that the antahkarana is not always
around.

Please do correct me if I have wrongly interpreted you.
