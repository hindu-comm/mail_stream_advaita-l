Ah this is different.  Shankaracharya as a defender of Vedic life was
quite ready to recommend rituals--for those who were qualified for
rituals.  But for those who are qualified for jnana--sannyasis like
himself, rituals have no effect so they need not be done but that doesn't
make them invalid.  Just like right now it is Shravana and we worship
Shiva Bhagavan.  In a few days it will be Ganesh Chaturthi and we will
take up the worship of Ganesh Bhagawan.  It doesn't mean we don't believe
in Shiva Bhagawan anymore only that the circumstance has changed.
