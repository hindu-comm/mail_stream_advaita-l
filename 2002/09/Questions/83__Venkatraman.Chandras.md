Dear Ashish,
  What I was trying to tell is, in the absence of antakaraNa, consciousness
alone cannot cause an imprint which is the case when in deep-sleep or in
coma. In dream-state, mind is active and so we have the memory of our
experience. But in deep-sleep there is nothing to illumine really. And so
no imprints can be left. Memory can't be independent of time. Since in
deep-sleep and coma one plunges into a timeless space, there is nothing
to imprint.

  Regards,
  chandrasekaran.
