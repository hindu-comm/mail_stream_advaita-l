The opposition in Advaita Vedanta is between karma and jnana.  Karma is
only sloppily translated as "religious rituals."  It means actions--all
types of intentful action.  Anyone who lives in this world claiming not to
be doing karma is a liar.  Anyone who shirks their duty to God is not
enlightened just lazy.

I'd say.  If I started experienceing bouts of lost time I'd run for the
nearest neurologist.

What are they.  Please define what you mean by enlightenment?  I suspect
you mean something other than what Advaitins mean.

So are you suggesting ones inner core is nothingness?  That's not the
Advaita Vedanta view. On th contrary pure consciousness requires
heightened awareness not a coma-like state.

Advaita Vedanta is only interested in liberation (mukti.) Mukti cannot be
given by anyone or anything.

Yes but what good is that loss if you don't know it?

As ahamkara requires consciousness I can see why it be lost when
unconscious.

Whoa hold on a minute.  How did you suddenly get here?

You are that requires making a positive connection between "you" and
"that."  The methods for doing that are the same (perception, logic,
scriptural testimony etc.) as for any other cognition.  It is not a
connection you can make while unconscious.

I don't know about this.  My daughter is nine months old now and I can't
say there has been one moment when she has been in a "no-mind" state.  Her
mind is untrained but she has been craving experience and trying to
understand it from her first waking moment.  You are right the difference
between her and any grownup is knowledge.  But lack of knowledge doesn't
imply not having a mind.
