Though consciousness is what enables memory, the imprints happen in 
the antakaraNa and not in the consciousness since it is avikaara. 
To draw a simile: For writing we need a stylus, ink and a medium to 
write on. Stylus is consciousness, ink is activity and medium is 
antakaraNa (and gross brain).
