Dear Jaldharji,

Good to see you back.

I often visit the Lord Jagannath temple at Puri. It is
only 70 km's from Bhubaneswar. The temple rituals are
numerous and many of them owe their origin to Sri
Shankaracharya. Next time I visit Puri I will also
visit the Gobardhan Mutt and try to get the facts.

Regards
Jagannath
