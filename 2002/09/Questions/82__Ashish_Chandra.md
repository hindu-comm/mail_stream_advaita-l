It is only through consciousness that the antahkarana is illumined. Without
the Atman/Consciousness, antahkarana is nothing but prakriti. Prakriti is
jada (non-sentient). So consciousness has its prints all over us all the
time.

I guess what I was pointing out was that even as those things which give us
the impression of the body being present, the mind being present, the ego
being present and the intellect being present, are actually not percieved,
there is still "something" that percieves their absence. We cannot jump to
calling it Brahman or something else but we can certainly admit that it ,
whatever it may be, is conscious.
