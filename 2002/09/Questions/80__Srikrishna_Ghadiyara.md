I understand the following from Swami Dayananda's
lectures on Atma Bodha.

Atman is always 'Nirvikalpa'. If 'Atman' were some
times Savikalapa then what changes can be brought into
'Atman' to make it 'Nirvikalpa' ??? The feelings of
Karta, karma, Karanam, Kriya is what is Vikalpa. These
do not exist in Atman any time. So, the duality is not
for 'Atman'. When the thought of duality is perceived,
the 'Atmic' state is not present.

I just heard a statement today in Swami D's lecture
that even the Anima etc. Siddhis have a limit. Can
someone comment.

I believe, 'non-dual' is the substratum of this
apparent duality. So, if one were to be identified
with that non-dual, there can not be any thing apart
from it. Rather, there may be other things of the
creation, but I remain as the substratum.

Om Namo Narayanaya !!
