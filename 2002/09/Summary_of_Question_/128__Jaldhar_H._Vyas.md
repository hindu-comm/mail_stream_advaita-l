Perhaps but it does answer your original request.  If you're going to
change the rules midstream it's not my fault.

You are tailoring your definitions to fit the answer you want to receive.
That will not do.

I mean the world in the waking dream, and deep sleep states.  Anyone of
them will do to answer your request.  Btw, how you are not asking the
hypothetical Brahmavid to be able to freeze boiling water during deep
sleep?

Sorry I fell prey to the same mistake I tell others not to make--confusing
the scale at which I am describing.  I meant these are the differences in
the vyavaharic state (i.e. for a non-jnani.)  For a jnani they are not
different.  And you are asking from the viewpoint of a jnani are you not?

Because that's where your request can be fulfilled.

Again, your framing of the question constrains the answer.  I  reject the
either/or nature of it.  Brahman is totally outside maya.  The concept of
maya is superimposed on Brahman by objects of maya itself.  However Maya
unlike Brahman is not a single thing but an infinite variety of things.
So we cannot definitively say "Maya is __" the way we can say "Brahman is
___"  All we can do is point to particular situations.

control is not a necessary condition for existence.

But you've been more successful in that than in boiling freezing water
right?
