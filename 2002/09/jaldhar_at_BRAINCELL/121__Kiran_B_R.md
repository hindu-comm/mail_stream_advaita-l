Dear Jaldhar,

I had asked you sometime back if "the waking state is
not enough for you?" in reply to your suggestion that
I should dream that I can freeze water by boiling
("Isn't a dream enough for you? If not, why not?").

Perhaps this issue has escaped your attention. I would
be happy if you could come back to that question -
either with a mail on the list or to me personally.

Dhanyavaad
Kiran
