Namaste,

Related to the gAyatrI are the seven vyAhritis:
bhU, bhuva, sva, maha, jana, tapa, satya

Of these, the first four are explained in the
taittirIya upanishad (1.5). Any information on where
the remaining three are discussed ?

Do jana, tapa, satya pertain to gAyatrI/ sAvitrI
at all ? Or do these refer to some other mantra ?

Best regards
Shrinivas Gadkari
