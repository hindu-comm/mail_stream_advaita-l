Yes but that's a description.  It's not a yoga in the sense of a
systematic kind of sadhana.  It would be jnanayoga which leads to the
point where you can say "neti neti."

At the very least it would involving understanding the meaning of the
phrase which Michael obviously didn't.

Yes this is a lack, one which I've already begun to remedy.  But I'm
puzzled as to why you don't think I can assert confidence after reading
Prasthana trayi, Bhamati, and a host of other works.  Do you really I
think I'm going to encounter such a huge surprise after reading Upadesha
Sahasri?
