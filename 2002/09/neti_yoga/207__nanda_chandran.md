If "neti yoga" means yoga based on "neti, neti", I would think that it is a
pretty accurate description for what is taught in the form of the pancha
kosha doctrine in Vivekachoodaamani.

But to make such an assertion you should have in the minimum read all works
on Advaita - atleast Shankara's works - but only a couple of days back you
yourself have admitted that you've not even read a very important work like
Upadesha Saahasri.
