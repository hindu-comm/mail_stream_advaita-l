But you see, you are identifying "you" with the mind. That is the root
problem addressed in advaita. To understand and pose questions about
brahmajnAna, one has to first try and rise above the identification with
the mind. When you say "my mind", there is a clear sense of the mind being
possessed by an entity that is different, and that is the referent of the
term "I".
