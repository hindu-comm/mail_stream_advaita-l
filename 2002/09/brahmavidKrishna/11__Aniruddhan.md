namaste,

But the scholars of A, V and D agree on the fact that their philosophies
are different, theoretically and experientially...I don't see how someone
can see the "same essence" in all three unless he/she has not completely
understood one or more of the three.

No, I'm assuming that the brahmavid has renounced all desires and is
totally detached, to the point of not bothering to prove to others the
level of His powers.

Just as a jnani sees no difference between karma and akarma, he will see no
difference between miraculous powers and lack of them. and since the "rest
state" in the normal world is that of no powers, he will remain unconcerned
about these powers.

Leave aside the opinions of the list members about whether he can or cannot
do this. What is the best way (probably the only way) to resolve this
question? By asking a Brahmavid, of course. Now we come to the question of
whether he will help to resolve this. Why will He make His body run 100m in
2s? If you are going to say "because Kiran wants this", I will say that the
Brahmavid sees himself in Kiran also and He doesn't want this. In any case,
there is no world for the Brahmavid. Why should the Brahmavid seek to run
an imaginary race in an imaginary world because an imaginary character in
it asks him to? Your question is irresolvable (IMO) because of this,
whether somebody has a theoretical answer to this or not.

Does the nitya-aaradhanam at Shringeri, puri, dwaraka and badrinath
take place as per the resident aagams of either of the dieties?

I would think that the Shankaracharyas at these places follow the
kalpa sutram when it comes to worship. It would be great if you or a
learned member could post on Agama traditions in the advaita
sampradayam.
