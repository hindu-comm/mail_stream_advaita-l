>You abstain from answering the question "Does braHman
>control worldly reality (Maya)?".

Maya is unreality. The unreal by definition is something that isn't - so how
can somebody control that which isn't?

As the Gita says : the unreal never is; the real always is.

If you find this difficult to accept that's because you are yourself part of
the unreal - to negate your own identity is not easy. That's the reason
Advaita asks you to practice atma vichaaram - self introspection/analysis -
so that you can know unreality experentially.
