Shruti is not dependent on old manuscripts. In fact, the likhita-pAThaka,
one who learns from manuscripts, is traditionally not considered learned at
all.

That would again be in the realm of belief, so what's the point? I can say
yes to your question about capability and still think that expecting water
to freeze by boiling is absurd.

Best wishes,
Vidyasankar
