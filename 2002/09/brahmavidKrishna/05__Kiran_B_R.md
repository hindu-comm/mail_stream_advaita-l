Okay, I'll not derive any conclusions if that's what's
preventing everyone from answering in 0 or 1. I'll
just ask out of "curiosity". You know what?
Irrespective of the answer, I'll kiss the braHmavid's
feet, shed tears and go home as a man having been
given direction in life. Now can Everyone answer?

(I only hope everyone doesn't come out with daggers
and knives at my proposal to kiss his feet and
consequently revert to that sweet, comfy invented
space between 0 and 1!)

:-)
Kiran
