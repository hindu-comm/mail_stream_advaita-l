"Believe not because some old manuscripts are
produced, believe not because it is your national
belief, because you have been made to believe it from
your childhood; but reason it all out, and after you
have analysed it, then, if you find that it will do
good to one and all, believe it, live up to it, and
help others to live up to it"

-Gauthama Buddha.
