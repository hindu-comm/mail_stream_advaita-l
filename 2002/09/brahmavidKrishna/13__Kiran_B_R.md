It is immaterial to me in which "sense" he controls.
If there is any "sense" in which he controls, your
allegation that The Unreal cannot be controlled is
unacceptable.

If the Unreal is truly uncontrollable, you cannot have
your pet dog get newspapers for you. If the Unreal is
truly uncontrollable, no such thing as mukthi is
possible - because even the path to mukthi is full of
control of the Unreal!

My question is - in a jnAni, is this capability to
control the Unreal infinte?
