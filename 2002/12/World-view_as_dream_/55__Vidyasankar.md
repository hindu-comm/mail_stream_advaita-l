No, for ultimately speaking, all action stems from avidyA.

The point is, there is a desire behind action, and there is ignorance behind
desire. It is easy to talk of performing desireless action (nishkAmya karma)
but it is most difficult to carry out. The ego and its desires assert
themselves very easily in the course of performing action.
