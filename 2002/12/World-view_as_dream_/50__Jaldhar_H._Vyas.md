It looks like I owe Jagannath a big apology.  It seems he was also
affected by the bouncing mail problem but I told him his messages had gone
through to the list.  In fact they had not.  So here are they are now.  If
anyone else is also have trouble posting to the list, please send it to me
personally (with full headers) and I will repost it.

I agree with you to a certain extent here. But I feel
we can still refute this evidence when we reflect on
the basic concept of advaita, i.e. the one indivisible
self. When we see magic on stage we put our disbelief
on hold and tend to believe the magic. But when we see
the same magic again but with the knowledge that it is
indeed a sleight of hand, we are more aware of its
unreality. Advaita teaches us to do this.

We are forced to have the material knowledge only to
the extent of our prarabdha (actions in our previous
life). Therefore nothing is forced upon us. It is just
the fructification of our own karma. We can have some
respite from this sense of helplessness when we
surrender ourselves to God or the nirguna Brahman. The
same saguna Brahman will then act as our ally and give
us some control over our lives. It is like crossing
the waves of the ocean and going out to the deep sea.
The water is calmer there.

It is not far from our reach. That is the delusion
most of us are subject to. In fact it is the
substratum of our life, the closest ally we have. If
we let go of our hopes, aspirations, expectations and
sit down to meditate on the nirguna Brahman, we can
sense our closeness with it. At first, like we all
experience, it appears as a blank void. But there are
people who experience a joy in such meditation and
derive energy from it. They actually come into touch
with this nirguna Brahman.

Jagannath
