Upa-puranas and Others
from Puranas, Hindu Dharma

      Apart from the 18 major Puranas there are an equal number of
      Upa-puranas. Among them are the Vinayaka Purana and the Kalki Purana.
      There are also, in addition, a number of minor Puranas. The Puranas
      that speak of the glory of various months such as the Tula Purana,
      the Magha Purana and the Vaisakha Purana are parts included into the
      18 major Puranas or Upa-puranas. There are also what are called
      Sthala Puranas, some of them part of the Puranas mentioned above and
      some existing independently. The puranas that sing the glory of the
      Kaveri and the Ganga exist both separately and as part of the major
      Puranas or of the Upa-puranas. In the Tula Purana, for instance, the
      importance of the Kaveri is the theme. It mention how auspicious it
      is to bathe in that river in the month of Tula (October-November).

 If there are Puranas devoted to the deities there are also those dealing
 with devotees. The Tamil Periyapuranam tells the story of the 63 Saiva
 saints called Nayanmars. The same is available in the Sanskrit as Upamanyu
 Bhaktavilasa. Bhakta-Vijaya deals with poet-saints like Tukaram and
 Namadeva who were specially devoted to the deity Panduranga of Pandharpur.





Note:
Hindu Dharma is a translation of two volumes of the well known Tamil Book
"Deivatthin Kural", which, in turn, is a book of 6 volumes that contains
talks of His Holiness Sri Chandrasekharendra Saraswathi Mahaswamiji of
Kanchipuram. The entire book is available online at
http://www.kamakoti.org/ .
