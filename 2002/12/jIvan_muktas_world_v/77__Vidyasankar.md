See following verses from Atmabodha, the words of a jIvanmukta -

samyak.h viGYaanavaan.h yogii svaatmanyevaakhilaM jagat.h .
ekaM cha sarvamaatmaanamiikshate GYaanachakshushhaa .. 47..

The sage (yogii), who knows well (samyak.h viGYaanavaan), sees the whole
world (akhilaM jagat.h) in his own self (svaatmany eva), and sees (iikshate)
the one self (ekaM aatmaanam) as all (sarvam), through the eye of wisdom
(GYaanachakshushhaa).

upaadhistho.api taddharmairalipto vyomavanmuniH .
sarvavinmuuDhavattishhThedasakto vaayuvachcharet.h .. 52..

Even though situated in the adjuncts (upaadhistho.api), the sage (muni) is
untouched (aliptaH) by their attributes (tad dharmaiH), like the sky
(vyomavat.h). One who knows all (sarvavid) should stand (tishhThet.h) like
an idiot (muuDhavat.h) and move (charet.h) like the wind (vaayuvat.h) - he
is unattached (asaktaH)
