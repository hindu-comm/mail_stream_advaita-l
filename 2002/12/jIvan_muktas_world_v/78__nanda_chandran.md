What Shankara means by the verse can be one thing and what we understand of
it can be something else.

What does a jivanmukta see? The dynamics of "seeing" in this context is
multifold and highly complex. Words like "physical eyes" and "inner vision"
have to be carefully understood/used in this context - especially so,
considering the doctrine of maya in Advaita.

Anyway IMO the issue itself is of little importance to those "on the path".

Which in Prof.Gupt's opinion, was a facade for a niyoga ritual.

But this opinion was expressed by Prof.Gupt a long time back. I remembered
it as it was the first time I heard of niyoga itself. Quite possible that
the professor has changed his views since then.
