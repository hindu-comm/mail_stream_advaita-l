Also that he knows that it is not really snake, but rope; even if the
physical eyes "see" otherwise. The inner vision negates the outer vision.

Hope this helps,

Dear Sri Venkatesh,
  Correction requested in the following statement, lest it will mislead.

> If Vyasa's father was the author of the original Visnu Purana,
> his son Sukracaraya it was who instructed King Pariksit in the
> Bhagavata.

  It should be Sukacharya and not Sukracharya.

  Thanks,
  chandrasekaran.
