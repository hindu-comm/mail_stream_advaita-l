Like?

Conceptualized objects like "horns of a hare" have a base in the experential
world and cannot be considered as "absolutely non-existent".

Not really. Non-existence/"nothing" is only relative and not absolute.
"Nothing" has no value in itself and exists only in relation to something
else. "There's nothing in this pot"  or "there's nothing in this room" etc.

There's nothing which we know of that is absolutely non-existent - that's
the reason nihilism itself is logically untenable.
