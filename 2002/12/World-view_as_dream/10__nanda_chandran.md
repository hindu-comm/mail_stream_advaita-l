Sure. But even those imagined objects have to have some base in the
experential world for the mind to be able to envision them. For eg even in
an non-existent example like "horns of a rabbit" we have experienced horns
and rabbits (albeit seperately) and that's the base on which the
non-existent example is conceptualized. Even planes were "dreamt up" with
birds in mind. Simply put it seems that the mind can only think of that
which exists - atleast in parts.
