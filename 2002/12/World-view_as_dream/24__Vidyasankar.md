A flying rug that requires only a magic incantation and no source of energy
input. It doesn't exist anywhere, except in the imagination that comes up
with fairy tales.

I am not talking of the "horns" that are non-existent with respect to a
hare. I am talking of the non-existence of the hare that has horns. The two
concepts are quite different.

This is back to epistemology vs. ontology. When we talk of the non-existence
of the horned hare, we are not limited by an epistemological statement
"There are no horns on this (or any) hare." We can make a valid ontological
claim, "A horned hare does not exist."

Then again, modern genetic engineering methods might well succeed in
creating a hare that grows horns, but that is ultimately only a
demonstration of the creative powers of the human imagination. And yes, this
is ultimately rooted in avidyA.
