?????????  In dream the dreamer ate 'sweet mangoes'.  On waking up
the 'waker' identifying himself with the 'dreamer' says he had 'sweet
mangoes'. Is the 'dreamer sweetness' different from 'waker sweetness' ??
If so, the waker should have used a word different word from waking state
sweetness. But, it is not so.

Also, we know that the 'dreamer' is not 'REAL' and it is
the 'Consciousness' which was projected as Dreamer, dream object, dream
experience/knowledge. It is essentially this reason that made us say 'I
dreamt'. In the absence of this 'commonness' the 'dreamer' would
be 'unknown' to the 'waker'.


We are not just worried about the 'names'. On what basis names are given,
anyway, in dream ? We are just establishing the 'continuity' of the knower.
The 'Knower principle' under the influence of tired mind, projected as
a 'tired person' can not apply itself so consistently as in waking state,
as it were due to identification.  But, it still has the same store house
of knowlege. Just like when a tired man can not have same sharp reflex like
a well awake person.

There are no 'objects' other than the 'mind'. There is no fault of
the 'objects'. If one wishes, one may attribute the fault to the 'mind'.
Yes, 'mind' as the 'cause' is more important than the 'object',
the 'effect'.

'Consciousness' is not like 'flash flood'. If so your statements are no
different from 'Kshinika vada Budhism'. There can not be a 'flood'.
Consciousness is homogenous and is in contact with 'all objects' 'all the
time'. Otherwise such as obect would not have 'existed'.

In your above sentence by using the words 'known, knowable and unknown',
you have negated the 'time limitation'. What is 'unknown or known' gets
negated by time, in the presence of 'Consciousness'. Consciousness 'sees'
all things at all times.

I believe, the Vedanta proposition is diagonally 'opposite' to what you
state. Consciousness is 'all knowing'. Probably you can say, 'Conditioned
Consciousness' sees depending on the upadhi's material knowledge. Mandukya
Karika elaborates on this word 'Conditioned'.

Not knowing Physics, can not make mockery of what I know about 'Anatomy'.
My knowledge of 'Anatomy' is certain. In the parlance of 'knowledge' of
the 'Knower' who himself is a 'projection', why should we be concerned 'how
certain' the 'knowledge' is ? Ofcourse if we are talking from
the 'absolute' stand point we should negate 'both' the 'projected Knower'
and the 'Certainity of his Knowledge'.

Yes, the 'Unknowable' is the 'Atma' which is in the 'background'. It
neither experiences nor is experienced, as it is neither an obect of
experience nor an 'experiencer'. Experience of the 'mind' is superimposed
on the 'Atma'.

No. We are not avoiding the unknown. We are accounting 'appropriately' for
the unknown, in the sphere of material knowledge.

Ignorance 'exists' until 'knowledge' dawns. I know that 'I am ignorant'
of 'how you look'. Once I see your picture, that 'ignorance of how you
look' will not exist for ever.

'Existance' existed 'always'. 'Sadeva Somya ..'. In that existance 'all'
mainifested, including what we call the dream.

How can it be ?? If I forgot the Schrodinger's equation solution which I
learnt 16 years ago, does it become 'unknown' ?? Or the number of stars in
the galaxy is 'unknown'. In the first case you did not say, "Oh, I unknown
about that!". You only said, "Oh, I forgot about that!". Forgetfulness is
the word used to indicate temporary loss of what is known once.

Even in Vedanta we say, "We forgot our own nature, and we can get back to
it". Just like I can take my old modern physics book and refresh
my 'memory' of Schrodinger's equation.

We are making the same attempt. To establish  the 'recurrence' of the
waking/dream state objects in dream state perception, as the cause of
perception in dream state.

Om Namo Narayanaya !!
