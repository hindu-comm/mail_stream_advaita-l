That is correct. There has to be knowledge in the background.

I disagree with this. The people who first designed cars and aeroplanes
dreamt about them before cars and aeroplanes became material realities.

It is not correct to say that every entity in a dream has to have a referent
in the "world out there" as seen in the waking state. In a dream, one can
imagine various kinds of monsters that do not exist.

The question one needs to ask is, who is the dreamer of the world-view dream
(if it is indeed a dream)?
