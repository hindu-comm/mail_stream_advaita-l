If there is absolutely no will in 'dream' then when a tiger
chases me I could sometimes get killed. right? But the fact
that this doesn't happen could mean that there is a mild will
behind the events in a dream too.. The unfavourable scenes in
dreams could be attributed to the pessimistic aspect of our
inner make-up. Persons who have a positive outlook will rarely
get unfavourable dreams, in my thinking.
But I agree the scenes in most of the dreams appear without a
direct control on our part. The dream could be bubbles coming
out of the memory floating up and coalesing together..
