I thought 'praj~nAnam bramha' is the lakshaNa vAkya and 'tat tvam asi' is
upadEsa vAkya or tatva vAkya. But, you are referring to 'tat tvam asi' as
lakshaNa vAkya. Please clarify.

I think you are mixingup lakshaNa vAkya which is a mahA vAkya indicating
lakshaNa, meaning 'svabhava or nature or characteristic' of Brahman (which
is praj~nAnam), and bhAga tyAga lakshaNa which is the nomenclature used for
sentence analysis while deriving lakshyArtha of a sentence.

Om Namo Narayanaya !!
