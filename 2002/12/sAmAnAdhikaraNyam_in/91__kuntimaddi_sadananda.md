In principle, You are right.  Part of upadesha can be considered as
lakshana too.  He is that devadaata - is it upadesha or lakshana vaakya.
Depends on ones perspective and emphasis.  If it has already been
defined before then one can take it as upadesha.

Since vidyarana starts with this in his first chapter, he uses it  both
as upadesha as well as lakshaNa. The purrvapakshi uses it as lakshana
and puts forth the objection which is countered - at least that is my
understanding.

Hari OM!
