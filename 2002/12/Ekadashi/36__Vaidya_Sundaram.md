Namaskaram.
 As per the recommendation of our house Dikshidhar who was also a nitya
agnihotri and great scholar, fasting of the stomach is not the only one -
one must also moderate the "food" taken in by the eyes, ears, and other
senses. In a sense, when the eye sees, it is partaking food that is "fit"
for that sense. One is also recommended to moderate speech and try to do
nama sankirtanam on ekadashis.
