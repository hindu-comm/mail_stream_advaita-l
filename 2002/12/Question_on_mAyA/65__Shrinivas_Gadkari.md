Let me clarify what I want to say.

Even if one realizes that "I am ALL" and these are all aspects
of my own Self is this not sufficient ? Only if there is something
that is outside the Self will there be a cause for concern.

If I have something and it really belongs to me, and there is no
fear of losing it, do I need to resolve this further ?

Thanks.
