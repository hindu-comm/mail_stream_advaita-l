I would like to add couple of statements to the beautiful description of
maya by Prof.VK.

At the level of Iswara - it is denoted by maya  and at the level of
jiiva the same maya is denoted as avidya or ignorance.  Hence from
Iswara's point, maaya becomes his shakti.  "It is difficult to cross my
maya which is of divine origin and only by surrendering to me one can
cross this maya - says Krishna in Giita.

The problem of locus of avidya has been criticized extensively by Shree
Ramanuja in his maya puurvapaksha and siddhanta.  During post-shankara
period, some distinctions have been made between the vivarana school and
bhamati school in terms of the locus.  Shree Ramanuja takes this
differences as his basis and unlaches his seven onslaughts agains avidya
concept of adviata.

Hari OM!
