Namaste,

This is a long standing issue that bothers me. For the time being
if we admit that brahman has parts, in particular we postulate brahman's
shakti. And mAyA is one aspect of that supreme shakti. Using this model
of shaiva / shrI vidyA tradition really simplifies many issues.

I would like to hear from list members on this issue.
