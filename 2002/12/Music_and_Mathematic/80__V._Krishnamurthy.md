Namaste

MaY I go slightly out of Vedanta and draw the
attention of those who are interested, to a most recent
wonderful paper  (published in Journal of Integer Sequences,
Vol.5, 2002)of Prof. K. Balasubramanian, a Professor of
Chemistry and Material Science, wherein he uses powerful
combinatorial techniques of Mathematics to (not only) enumerate
exhaustively (but also) generate (new) ragas of Indian music.
Earlier attempts at this work have been empirical; the present
method is highly mathematical and takes systematic account  of
all possible repetitions as well as equivalences of various
kinds. The whole paper  (21 pages) can be accessed from the
following:

praNAms to all seekers of spirituality  who are also lovers of music.
