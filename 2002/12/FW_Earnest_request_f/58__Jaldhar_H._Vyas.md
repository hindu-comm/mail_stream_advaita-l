The Nirnaya Sagar books tend to be really good quality.  I have as many of
them as I could find.

Many works have been reprinted by other publishers such as:

Parimal Publications
27/29 Shaktinagar
New Delhi, 110007

Nag Publishers
11A/UA (post office building, Jawahar Nagar,
Delhi-7

Also all the titles you mentioned are available at the Oriental division,
of the New york, Public Library so if worst comes to worst, you can go
there and photocopy them for your teacher.
