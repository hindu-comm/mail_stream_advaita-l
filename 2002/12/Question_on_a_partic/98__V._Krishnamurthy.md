Namaste

For the devotees of Lord shiva,  today is an important auspicious day
because today was the day when the cosmic dance was enacted for the
darshan of two great devotees Patanjali and VyAghra-pAda. The festival  is
called Arudra-darshanaM in the temple of Chidambaram and in all shiva
centres of pilgrimage.

I have a question on the following  shiva stotra which I picked up  fifty
years ago from All India Radio Madras. But I have not been able to locate
the text anywhere in print. Where does it come from? Who is the author? I
think it must be a piece of eight verses of which I have only seven. The
first of them is:

ati-bhIShaNa kaTu-bhAshaNa yama-kinkara paTalI
kR^ita-tADana pari-pIDana maranAgata-samaye /
umayA saha mama cetasi yama-shAsana nivasan
shiva-shankara shiva-shankara hara me hara duritaM //


It goes on like this. The last quarter of each sloka is the same as that
of the above.
I recently searched in the Sanskrit documents site. But I could not find
it there.

praNAms to all seekers of spirituality
