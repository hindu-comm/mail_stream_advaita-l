I am a 44 year old Canadian woman who has been on a search all my life.
I've studies religions, psychology, metaphysics.  I've done counselling,
Jungian analysis etc...  Now y path has led me to Advaita-Vedanta.   In the
past year and a half and this is what resonates with me!!  I am grateful to
have the teachings and am looking for more and others seeking the same.
