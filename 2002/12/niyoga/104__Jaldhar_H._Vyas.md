Does he give any reason for thinking this?  In Valmiki, Rama and his
brothers are said to have been born as the result of the Putreshti yajna
performed byKing Dasharatha and his queens.

Btw while you are looking for Hindu Dharma, Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan also
published a book called "The Vedas" which is based on discourses by the
beloved Swami Chandrashekhara Bharati of Shringeri and which contains a
lot of information on this subject.

>  Hare Krishna, just FYI, "The Vedas" is the compilation of discourses by
His holiness Sri Chandrashekarendra Saraswati  of Kanchi Mutt published by
Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan.  You can find some excerpts from this book in
Advaitin home page also.  Hari Hari Hari Bol!!! bhaskar
