||AUM namo bhagavate vAsuDevAya||

Namaskar,

One of Bhagavan Vishnu's famous name is Venkatesh.

Or is it Vyakatesh?

What is the meaning of Venkat?

Vyankat means bend or curve or crook..(Crook = a
hooked,bent or curved thing or part; hook - Webster's)

"je khalanchi 'vyankati' saando | taya satkarmi rati
vaadho||" -- Pasaayadaan in Dnyaneshwari by Sant
Dnyaneshwar.

Let the crookedness - "Vyankati" vanish from the
crooked ('khala'-swindler) people.Let them become more
and more devoted ('ram'-'rat'-'rati')to good karmas
('satkarma').

In this context,how we can call the lord as
Vyankatesh?
Is their any explaination?

--VSN
