Jagannath, I think this is the last of the bounced messages.  Let me know
off-list if I've missed any.

Dear Jaldhar,

It is wrong to think that Ramprasad is no longer
relevant. He is one the most valuable gems in the vast
repertoire of Bengali devotional literature. The
worshipper of the Divine Mother, numerous in Bengal,
cannot ever do without him. Even Sri Ramakrishna,
considered to be the physical embodiment of Mother
Kali herself, was extremely fond of the songs of
Ramprasad and used to sing them in his sweet voice.

Besides Ramprasad the songs of Kamalakanta, Chandidas
are also very popular.

I will definitely write out the songs for this list.
It'll be a pleasure to share them with you all.

Regards
Jagannath
