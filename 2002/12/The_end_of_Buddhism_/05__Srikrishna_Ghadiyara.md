Probably this is not a correct view. Take for example India; India has a
constitution which is not based on 'Hindu Dharma'. Presentday constitution
is a principle of modern social governance. It has nothing to offer for the
ultimate realisation of ones' own Self.

In America the constitution permits any religious belief, and the religious
beliefs themselves are in close relationship with the 'Dharma' (leading to
ultimate purushartha) we are discussing. Yes, the various ideas of Dharma
may or may not filter into constitution; for example 'Abortin' in the
American context.

Om Namo Narayanaya !!
