New book - A Collection From Sankara's Commentaries on the Prasthana-traya

Hari Om,

This mail is about a new book. Swami Kritarthananda has painstakingly
compiled most important and memorable statements of Shankara Bhagavatpada
in the Prasthana-traya bhashya, for the benefit of Vedanta enthusiasts and
researchers. The hardbound book runs into 916 pages and is published by the
Ramakrishna Mission Institute of Culture, Kolkata.

Swamiji wants the book to reach Advaita teachers across the country so that
students and researchers of Vedanta can benefit from this. I received a
mail in this regard from the publishers some days ago, with a request to
help them spread the word about this book.
