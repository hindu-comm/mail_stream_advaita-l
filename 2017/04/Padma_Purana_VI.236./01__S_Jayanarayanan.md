I agree with what you've said above, but my angle on this topic is quite different.

A rough analogy:
Suppose there is a debate as to which substance is more precious: Gold or Water.
Someone might hold that Gold is far more precious, because it is more expensive.
Another would argue that Water is more precious because it's impossible to live without it!

IMHO, the Vedas are like Gold, but the Itihasa-Puranas are like Water.
There is a definite argument that the latter is more appealing because
of their being freely available to everyone, irrespective of gender, caste, etc.

In the case of the Mahabharata, Scholars of Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute
(BORI) have brought out a "Critical Edition" that most accurately represents the Original
text, attempting to filter out spurious interpolations. Thus, for someone interested in
studying the Mahabharata, it is best advised to learn from the BORI critical edition.

Unfortunately, readily available versions of some Puranas contain obvious interpolations
(such as Sankara being called a Mayavadin, etc.) which do mislead the beginner,
and these interpolations should be eliminated in the Critical Edition.
What I would like to see are critical editions of some of the important Puranas:
e.g. Vishnu, Shiva, Padma Purana, etc. that would be very helpful to all who seek
Knowledge of Vedanta that doesn't require weighty "technical" understanding.
