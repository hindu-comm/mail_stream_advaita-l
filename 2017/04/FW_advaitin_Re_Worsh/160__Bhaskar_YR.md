Bhaskarji - praNAms

My post from yahoo, got posted only in advatin list and not adviatal - it got bounced by Advaital again. Not sure what the problem is. Bhaskarji - appreciate if you forward it to advaital list if it does not appear.

Now about anya devata worship statement of Krishna

I would interpret anya devata not in terms of the forms but in terms of the goals - that is worship with self-centered desires - aartho and arthaarthis Bhaktas- what they are really worshiping is objective desires - Bhakti is not for the Lord but for the objects - that is anya  devatas. God is only a means to achieve what they desire - what Swami Paramarthanandaji calls it as - 'Means-Love' for the God.

As Subbuji pointed out that Brahman being infinite - indirectly they too worshiping Me only since I pervaded everything - even though they are ignorant of this fact - Krishna says.

In that sense any worship with Iswara arpita buddhi - will help in the purification of the mind.

Hari Om!
Sadananda

Yes, in saNdhyAvandana we say AkAshAtpatitaM tOyaM…….sarva deva namaskAraH keshavaM pratigacchati. But Krishna in geeta says worship of anya devata (though ultimately comes to him) will be carried out due to ajnAna and it will be avidhipUrvakaM.  (yepyanyadevatAbhaktA …….yajantyavidhipUrvakaM…Since they donot know this it will be a downfall for them (tattvenAtshchyavanti te).  Result is those who worship devata would reach devalOka, observe pitru vrata get pitru lOka, proficiate bhUta attain bhUta And those who worhip ME they would attain ME only.  Though upAsya as kriya is one and the same upAsya devata are different and they would get different phala-s according to their upAsana devata.  Here only shankara makes it clear that worship of  vinAyaka, bhUta gaNa, sapta mAtruka etc. are tAmasa in nature and fruits one would reap accordingly.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
