If the blue radiance of Lord Narayana made the ksheerasamudra look blue, Why did not the white radiance of Sridevi, who is by his side kneading his legs, turn it back to white. After all the word Sri means radiance.
Some useless rationalism.

>  Yes, for the exalted advaitins these explanations look useless and they continue to ask how this radiance skipped Sri Lakshmi,  who is more proximate than ksheera sAgara ??  and there is ofcourse a big cot in the form of Adishesha with his multiple coiled big tale :-)  between nArAyaNa and ksheera sAgara and he too, it seems, not get affected by neela varNa of nArAyaNa, so according to rigid and rational philosopher these are at best mere poetic imaginations without any rationality behind it ...But for the sincere bhakta-s, who cares little about logic or rationality, these are pastimes from their omnipotent ishta devata  and they  would like to hear more and more leela-s and mahima-s from their ishta / upAsya devata and to the extent these type of explanations would help them to aggrandize  their bhakti and Shraddha towards their ishta devata.  

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
