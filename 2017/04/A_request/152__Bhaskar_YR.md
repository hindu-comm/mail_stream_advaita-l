Humble sAshtAnga praNAms Sri Vidya prabhuji
Hare Krishna

Thanks for your guidance.  Since in my office desk top I do not have the internet access I made that request.  Though I have internet connection, laptop everything at home I donot want to use it and those facilities are at the disposal of my two sons ☺  Not using the computer, internet for vedAnta discussion at home is one of the new year resolutions which with great difficulty I am still following for the past few years.  I don’t know when I am going to break it due to my undue garrulousness when it comes to vedAnta and related issues ☺

Your humble servant
Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar

I heard that there is a site wherein we can search shankara bhAshya by word.  May I request to find the various definition of the following terms in prasthAna traya bhAshya :


(a)    satyaM

(b)   asatyaM

(c)    anrutaM

(d)   mithyA

(e)   anirvachaneeya

Kindly do copy and paste relevant details as  I donot have internet access to visit the site for details  if you give the link.

Thanks in advance.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
