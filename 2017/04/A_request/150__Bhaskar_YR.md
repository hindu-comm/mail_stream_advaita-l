I heard that there is a site wherein we can search shankara bhAshya by word.  May I request to find the various definition of the following terms in prasthAna traya bhAshya :


(a)    satyaM

(b)   asatyaM

(c)    anrutaM

(d)   mithyA

(e)   anirvachaneeya

Kindly do copy and paste relevant details as  I donot have internet access to visit the site for details  if you give the link.

Thanks in advance.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
