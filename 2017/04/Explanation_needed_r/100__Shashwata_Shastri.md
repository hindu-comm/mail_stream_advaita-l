Pranam Sriramji,

In that particular statement - "I" is not an object. What ever you impose
on the subject is false. Let it be a name - "BrahmaN" or an attribute,
since non-qualified Brahman has no name to begin with, imposing one means
ignorance . Here you are imposing Tatastha LakshaNa on Svarupa LakshaNa
(which is "I"; as the speaker is the subject himself, who is unable to get
rid of the his own self). The example which you used is not correct since
you are just equating two objects and the example itself opposes the
statement (As "I" or "Brahman" are opposite of the material world). To
extend it further- subject can not be equated with an object as the notion
of equating itself means defiling the subject "I". In the MahAvAkya "I" is
not replaceable by anything whether that definite thing is a name or
another object. Here the subject is being objectified by a name (name is
the tatasha lakshNa for the svarUpa Brahman "I"). and by that very
definition the word "Brahma" here, is an adjective.

The same question (which I have asked) was asked in a seminar by Swami
Vedatattvanandaji to BrahmaNa Kula Ratna Vedmurti Krishnamurti Sastrigal.
Both of them were unable to answer the question. Except that both of them
fully accepted the fact that it ("BrahmaN") was an adjective.
