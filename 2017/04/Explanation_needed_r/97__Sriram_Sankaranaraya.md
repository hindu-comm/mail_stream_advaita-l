(Dear Shashwata ji - I am cc'ing the group to your reply)

I should humbly refute by saying imposing nouns is NOT the same as imposing
quality. If I say Milk is "Ksheeram", I am imposing the noun "Ksheeram" on
milk, and it implies they are one and the same. Milk doesn't have any
quality that ksheeram doesn't and vice versa.

This is contrast to saying "Milk is white" where milk has other attributes
apart from "whiteness" like being a liquid, tasting sweet, and there are
other objects in the world apart from milk, which are white in colour, like
a cloud. But here white is clearly an adjective because there is no
object/thing known as white. You cannot give me one kg of "white".


Also just because honey and milk, both taste sweet, it would not be
profound to say, "Milk has honey-ness" unless you state clearly, it is the
quality of taste that you are talking about. In case of Aatman and Brahman,
there is no such qualification in any of the Shruti vaakyas, what quality
are they talking about. This happens despite numerous repetitions of
Brahma-aatma ekatva in Shruti phrased in various ways.

And please provide your opinions regarding the word Brahman being
adjective. If not I, other better informed people in the group would be
able to answer you.

Thanks
Sriram

Pranam Sriramji,

Still it does not eradicate the confusion. Since name and quality are both
attributes. Imposing noun or name is as the same as imposing quality. And
also I have some opinions regarding the word "Brahma" being an adjective.

Best Regards,

Shashwata Chowdhury
