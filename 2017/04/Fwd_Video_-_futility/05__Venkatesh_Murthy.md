Namaste

It is a good video but it is not easy to change from chasing worldly
attractions. Because for countless births the Jeeva will be chasing
worldly happiness and he cannot immediately withdraw after listening
to a random person. For that he must have grace of Guru or Ishwara and
very important -  company of Sajjanas. Without this he will be like a
drunkard listening to moral stories and then going to bar to drink.
The Vairagya from these serials will be very temporary and have Zero
effect. They say the company of Sajjanas is the most difficult to get
in Kali Yuga but if you get it Moksha is very easy like having a
Amalaka fruit in the hand.
