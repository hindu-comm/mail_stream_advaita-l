A beautiful resource for Valmiki Ramayana

Here is a fine resource for the reading and listening to the Valmiki
Ramayana:

https://www.valmiki.iitk.ac.in/sloka?field_kanda_tid=1&language=dv&field_sarga_value=1

When the audio ’continuous play' is switched on, one can hear the rendering
of the shlokas with very good diction and melody. Words are split
appropriately and rendered in a pace that is conducive to one's reading the
verses on the text part, along with the English translations.  In all, one
is in for a wonderful Ramayana experience to be had on this Srīrāmanavamī.

रामं भजे श्यामलम्
