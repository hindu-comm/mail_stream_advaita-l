Hare Krishna

Yes, in saNdhyAvandana we say AkAshAtpatitaM tOyaM…….sarva deva namaskAraH keshavaM pratigacchati. But Krishna in geeta says worship of anya devata (though ultimately comes to him) will be carried out due to ajnAna and it will be avidhipUrvakaM.  (yepyanyadevatAbhaktA …….yajantyavidhipUrvakaM…Since they donot know this it will be a downfall for them (tattvenAtshchyavanti te).  Result is those who worship devata would reach devalOka, observe pitru vrata get pitru lOka, proficiate bhUta attain bhUta And those who worhip ME they would attain ME only.  Though upAsya as kriya is one and the same upAsya devata are different and they would get different phala-s according to their upAsana devata.  Here only shankara makes it clear that worship of  vinAyaka, bhUta gaNa, sapta mAtruka etc. are tAmasa in nature and fruits one would reap accordingly.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
