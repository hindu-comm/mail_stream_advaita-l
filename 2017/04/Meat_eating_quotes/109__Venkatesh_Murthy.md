Namaste

All this can be explained by Yuga Dharma. In Kali Yuga there are many
things we cannot do but people were doing in other Yugas. In other
Yugas they were doing Ashwamedha Yajna but now it is not allowed. If
elder brother died the younger brother was allowed to get children in
his wife if she had no children. Now it is not allowed.

In olden days if there were many brothers only the Eldest brother had
right to get all inherited property. But now all brothers can get
equal share.

If it is allowed in Dharma Sastra also some things are not allowed in
Indian Law. Example - a Hindu man can have more than one wife
according to Dharma Sastra but not Indian Law, though Muslims can have
4. But Supreme Court has said a Hindu man cannot convert to Islam just
for marrying more than one woman. It is illegal. But Muslim
organizations are very much against the Supreme court ruling. They
want more and more Hindu men to convert for having more than one wife
and increase the Muslim population.

Like this we can give many examples of Ancient Dharma Sastra allowing
but Recent Dharma Sastra not allowing it or Indian Law is not allowing
it. Similarly though the meat eating was there in ancient Vedic days
we have to follow Vegetarianism now because recent Dharma rules are
not allowing it. You can see now in Sraddha nobody is eating meat.
Because Recent Dharma is not allowing it. In Ancient Dharma Sastra
meat was allowed in Sraddha ceremony.

Another scientific point is also there. The meat nowadays is very
polluted and contaminated. If you see the cows, pigs, sheep, chickens
and goats  they are eating rubbish and bad things and the keepers are
feeding them hormones and other dangerous substances. If people eat
that meat it will be very dangerous for them. They will get many
diseases like cancer and heart diseases. You can see the young
children today are becoming very fat and unhealthy. Boys are getting
maturity and moustache and beard at 13 years and girls are getting
maturity also before 13. When a boy reaches 19 or 20 he is looking
like a 30 or 35 year old man. This is because of eating bad food.

Recently US Govt banned many food items from India because they have
many contaminants and they are adulterated. They are mixing marble
stone powder to make food items crunchy. I heard they mix white liquid
used for correcting printing mistakes in milk. All the items in sweets
shops are adulterated because they are adding dangerous chemicals to
give them bright shining colour. They mix horse dung in Dhania powder.

Water contamination is very common because of water shortage.
Restaurants will reuse water left by one customer and give it to the
next. They are not washing the utensils with clean water. They are not
washing vegetables before cooking.

They are growing vegetables with pesticides and chemicals. Merchants
saying they are growing organic vegetables are cheating customers.
They are not doing anything organic.

Therefore I ask the question - If vegetarian food itself is so bad how
can anybody think of eating non vegetarian food today? He must be
crazy.
