I received the following in a whatsapp group.  How do we respond other than countering with quotes of sattvik veg foods? 
Are these quotes accurate?  How can they be explained if accurate?

Sincerely,
Sanju

Apologize if this is hurtful as it was to me.

"*Purely a forward... With no apologies to Hindutva and no recommendation to anyone to eat meat but to remind those who have forgotten the glorious Hindu traditions and are torturing and killing others in the name of the Hindu religion and gauRakhsha:*

A recent photograph of some Hindu Protesters demanding a ban on non-vegetarian food made me sit and take notice of the vedaas. 

I believe that these protesters are ignorant of what our/their religion preaches. They are simply going against their own religious scriptures.

Let me quote some of the  Hindu scriptures: 

Manusmriti 
chapter 5 verse30:

*"It is not sinful to eat meat of eatable animals,for God has created both the eaters and the eatables".*

Aapastanba Grishsutram(1/3/10):

says, *"The cow should be slaughtered on the arrival of a guest, on the occasion of 'Shraaddha of ancestors and on the occasion of a marriage".*

Rigveda (10/85/13): declares, *"On the occasion of a girls marriage oxen and cows are slaughtered".*

Rigveda (6/17/1) : states that, *"Indra used to eat the meat of cow, calf, horse and buffalo".*

Vashishta Dharmasutra (11/34): says, *"If a Brahmin refuses to eat the meat offered to him on the occasion of ,'Shraaddha' he goes to hell".*

Hinduisms great propagator Swami Vivekaanand said thus: *"You will be surprised to know that according to ancient Hindu rite and rituals, a man cannot be a good Hindu who does not eat beef ".*
(The complete works of Swami Vivekanand vol :3/5/36) 

*"The book The history and culture of the indian people"* â€“ published by Bharatiya vidya bhawan, Mumbai and edited by renowned historian R C Majumdar (vol 2, page 18 says): *This is said in the mahabharata that "king Ratindra used to kill 2000 other animals in addition to 2000 cows daily in order to give their meat in charity".*

*Aadi shankaraachaarya commentary on Brahadaranyako panishad 6/4/18 says: 'Odaan' rice mixed with meat is called 'maansodan' on being asked whose meat it should be, he answers 'Uksha' is used for an ox, which is capable to produce semen...*

Now who do you want to follow? 

*Religious Books or the illiterate sanghi?
