Subject: {भारतीयविद्वत्परिषत्} Translations of Koyil Puranam
To: भारतीयविद्वत्परिषत् <bvparishat at googlegroups.com>


Dear list

In his essay *The Dance of Siva*, Ananda Coomaraswamy narrates a legend
from the *Koyil Puranam*

https://archive.org/stream/danceofsivafourt00coomiala#page/56/mode/2up

I would like to read a translation of the Koil Purana. Are there any
reliable English/Hindi translations?

Thanks, Nityananda
