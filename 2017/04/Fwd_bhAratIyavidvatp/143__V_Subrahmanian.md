Subject: {भारतीयविद्वत्परिषत्} Veda satra pathasala at Chittur
To: bvparishat <bvparishat at googlegroups.com>


Dear friends,
I have written a note on Chittur Vedapatha sala. It contains an elegy
(short one) in Sanskrit written (by Ammangudi Paramesvara sastrigal) in the
year 1926. The subject of the elegy is Sri Krishna Iyer, the founder
manager of the  वेदपाठशाला at Chittur, Palakkad, Kerala. This reputed
institution (last decades of 19th century and early decades of 20th
century) produced many Vedic and Satric scholars like महामहोपाध्याय
अनन्तकृष्णशास्त्री.
