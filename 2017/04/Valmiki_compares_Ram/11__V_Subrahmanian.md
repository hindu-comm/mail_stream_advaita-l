Namaste

I am not aware of any such source. One can buy books by Sri Dikshitar from
this address:

Secretary,

Sri Appayya Dikshitendra Granthavali Prakasana Samiti,

House No. 9-32/1, (Plot No.B.163),

Ravindra Nagar Colony,

Hyderabad 500 007

You can try this email id:  ragamang at tatanova.com

A few years ago I purchased several titles by Dikshitar.
