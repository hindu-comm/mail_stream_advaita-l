In the Valmiki Ramayana there is a verse that compares Sītā-Rama with
Gourī-Shankara:

कृताभिषेकस्सरराज रामः सीताद्वितीयस्सह लक्ष्मणेन।

कृताभिषेको गिरिराजपुत्र्या रुद्रस्सनन्दी भगवानिवेशः।।3.16.43।।


सीताद्वितीयः accompanied by Sita, सः रामः that Rama, कृताभिषेकः completing
his bath, सहलक्ष्मणेन along with Lakshmana, गिरिराजपुत्र्या with the
daughter of the king of the mountains, कृताभिषेकः ablution over, सनन्दी
along with Nandi, ईशः Isvara, रुद्रः इव like Rudra, रराज shone.

Accompanied by Sita and Lakshmana, Rama finished his bath in the river. He
looked splendid like Lord Rudra followed by Nandi and the daughter of the
king of the mountains (Parvati).

Sri Appayya Dikshita cites this verse in his own commentary to his 'Sri
Ramayana tātparya sāra sangraha stotram' 10. He says, by making such a
comparison, Valmiki reveals his own purport that 'Shiva is endowed with
unsurpassed greatness.'
