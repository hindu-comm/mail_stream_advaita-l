Here is a message that was shared in a Whats App group:

Once, Lord Indra got upset with Farmers, he announced there will be no rain
for 12 years & you won't be able to produce crops.

Farmers begged for clemency from Lord Indra, who then said,  Rain will be
possible only if Lord Shiva plays his Damru, but he secretly requested Lord
Shiva not to agree to these Farmers & when Farmers reached Lord Shiva he
repeated the same thing that he will play Damru after 12 years.

Disappointed, the Farmers decided to wait till 12 years but one farmer
regularly was digging treating & putting manure in the soil and sowing the
seeds even with no crop emerging.

Other farmers were making fun of that farmer. After 3 years all farmers
asked that farmer why are you wasting your time and energy when you know
that rains will not come before 12 years.

He replied "I know that crop won't come out but I'm doing it as a matter of
"practice". After 12 years I will forget the process of growing crops and
working in the field so I must keep it doing so that I'm fit to produce the
crop, the moment there is rain after 12 years.''

Hearing his argument Goddess Parvati praised his attitude before Lord Shiva
& said You may also lose the practice of playing the Damru after 12 years.

The innocent Lord Shiva in his anxiety just tried to play the Damru, if he
could... and hearing the sound of Damru immediately there was rain and the
farmer who was regularly working in the field got his crop emerged
immediately  and others were disappointed

It is the practice which keeps on making you perfect.

The game is won during the practice, not during the performance.

You become even diseased or old just because you don't practice on your
body or mind.

Practice is the essence of quality survival.
