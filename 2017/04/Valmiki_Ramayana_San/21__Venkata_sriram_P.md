Namaste,

The 1st sarga of bala kanda consisting of 100 shlokas is called बालरामायणं / मूलरामायणं
which itself is the essence of rAmAyaNa.  

Still if one doesn't have time to study, the गायात्री रामायणं can be chanted which 
is here online:

The benefit of studying entire ramayana and gAyatri mantra can be accrued by 
reading this.

regs,
sriram
