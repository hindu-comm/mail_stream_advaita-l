Namaste

Nowadays we don't have time to do anything. Everybody is always  busy
and saying no time to do this no time to do that. There is a short
collection of Valmiki Ramayana Slokas for people like this.

If a busy man tries to do Parayana of original Ramayana of 24000
Slokas it will take him a long time or he may stop after some time.

This is Valmiki Ramayana of 24000 Slokas condensed to 125 Slokas only.
Parayana of short Ramayana can be done daily by all.
