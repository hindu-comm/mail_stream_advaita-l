Namaste

It is heartening to note that an ancient temple in Karnataka has been
conducting a 'Soundarya Lahari Pārāyaṇa' seva. Anyone who wants to
subscribe to the seva can contact the temple and have it done there.

This is the information I have on Polali -


Soundarya Lahari seva is on the list of sevas. A family has been
doing this since a long time. The temple is 400 years old.They
say the seva has been there since the beginning.

Please share this information among devotees of Devi.
