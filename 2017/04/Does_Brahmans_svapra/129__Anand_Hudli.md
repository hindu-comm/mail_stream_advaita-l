> The meaning of both terms i.e. mithyA and asat bit complicated &
confusing here I reckon.  What is asat??  As you know, shankara clarifies
in taitereeya about sat and asat,  that once determined to be of a certain
form, what never deviates from the form is the sat and once determined to
be of a certain form what deviates from the form is asat.  IMHO, hare's
horn example does not come in this category whereas vyaktAvyakta rUpa of
prakruti is more suited for this definition.  And mithyA is that which
never exists but cognized due to avidyA.  Shankara gives the examples of
dviteeya Chandra, snake on the rope etc. for the mithyA vastu.  To clarify
that after the dawn of correct knowledge / cognition, one realizes that
the mithyA vastu was / is / will never be existed.  Please clarify.

I don't understand why the confusion here. In the taittiriya bhAShya,
Shankara has defined anRta and says in the very next sentence, "ato vikAro
anRtam vAcAraMbhaNaM vikAro ...". So it is clear he does not mean asat
here, in the sense of shashaviShANa or hare's horn, but mithyA, which is
the same as sadasadvilakShaNa, which is the same as tattva-anyatvAbhAm
anirvachanIya. This becomes further clarified if you see the gItAbhAShya
(2.16) words, "vikAro ayamasanneva marIcijalavan*mithyA* avabhAsate."

Or, if one wants to justify the stand that Shankara never made a
distinction between asat on the one hand and
mithyA/anirvachanIya/sadasadvilakShaNa on the other, it can be done as
follows. From a pAramArthika viewpoint, there is only AtmA, and everything
else is anAtmA. So we could say AtmA or Brahman is sat and everything else
is asat. However, for purposes of vyavahAra, we have to make a distinction
between atyanta asat, such as a hare's horn, and adhyasta asat, such as
rajju-sarpa.
