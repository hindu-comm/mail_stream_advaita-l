> The meaning of both terms i.e. mithyA and asat bit complicated &
confusing here I reckon.  What is asat??  As you know, shankara clarifies
in taitereeya about sat and asat,  that once determined to be of a certain
form, what never deviates from the form is the sat and once determined to
be of a certain form what deviates from the form is asat.  IMHO, hare's
horn example does not come in this category whereas vyaktAvyakta rUpa of
prakruti is more suited for this definition.  And mithyA is that which
never exists but cognized due to avidyA.  Shankara gives the examples of
dviteeya Chandra, snake on the rope etc. for the mithyA vastu.  To clarify
that after the dawn of correct knowledge / cognition, one realizes that
the mithyA vastu was / is / will never be existed.  Please clarify.

MithyAtva is the same as sad-asad-vilakShaNatva. So a mithyA vastu, example
a pot or illusory silver/snake, can neither be asat (like a hare's horn),
nor sat (Brahman). You may say mithyA objects can be classified as
vyAvahArika (pot) and prAtibhAsika (illusory snake). The statement "vimataM
mithyA, dRshyatvAt" indicates there is a vyApya-vyApaka relation between
dRshyatva and mithyAtva, similar to the relation between smoke and fire.
Where there is smoke there is fire. Anything that is dRshya (can be known)
is also mithyA. pratipannopAdhau traikAlikanishhedhapratiyogitvaM vA
mithyAtvam is one definition of mithyAtva which captures the fact that a
mithyA vastu will cease to exist in all three periods of time, once the
bhrama ends.
