Yes, asat means non-existent and this fits the description of the hare's horn. By imagination, I meant a vRtti which does not have a corresponding object. But asat is not the same as mithyA, and the topic of dRshyatva has to do with mithyAtva.

The meaning of both terms i.e. mithyA and asat bit complicated & confusing here I reckon.  What is asat??  As you know, shankara clarifies in taitereeya about sat and asat,  that once determined to be of a certain form, what never deviates from the form is the sat and once determined to be of a certain form what deviates from the form is asat.  IMHO, hare's horn example does not come in this category whereas vyaktAvyakta rUpa of prakruti is more suited for this definition.  And mithyA is that which never exists but cognized due to avidyA.  Shankara gives the examples of dviteeya Chandra, snake on the rope etc. for the mithyA vastu.  To clarify that after the dawn of correct knowledge / cognition, one realizes that  the mithyA vastu was / is / will never be existed.  Please clarify.
