Dear Sri Kayan, Your sentence "Suppose I have accepted that the Atman alone is real" shows the level of your understanding of Vedantic Truths. Are you different from Atman? Is this what you have understood? 
 Please study all the quotations together with Sri Shankara's commentary in totality with an open mind and in depth . Please study them from the standpoint of the totality of LIFE.Please do not be in a hurry to reply back. Then the understanding will dawn that the questions that have been put are absurd and the questioner himself is not be there.
With respectful namaskars,Sreenivasa Murthy

Sri Sreenivasa murthyji

I have a question for you. Suppose I have accepted that the Atman alone is real. Practically speaking, what do you think I should do next? Go to Himalayas and take sannyAsa? Or sit at home and keep doing nothing but thinking about the Atman as long as I am awake ( though if I do this I will be on the roads in a few months, as I will not have money to pay rent)? Or roam around the streets and towns randomly like Sri Sadashiva Brahmendra? Or retire into a cave? Can you enlighten me?

Regards
Kalyan

 In the light of the above

 reasons why so much of discussions and dissections about
 anAtma are taking place . I am interested to know the
 reasons for it. Please enlighten me.Thanking you.With

 mithyA vastu in trikAla. And the term asat
 which has been clearly
 explained by shankara
 that yadrUpeNa nishchitaM yat tadrUpaM vyabhicharat
 anrutaM, This yadrUpeNa nishchitaM that
 vyabhicharati cannot be an atyanta
 abhAva
 vastu like vandhyA putra or shasha vishANa..Because
 yadrUpeNa
 nishchitaM cannot be attributed
 to horn and putra and subsequently apply
 the
 vyabhichAra. Whereas vyabhichAra (changing) can be
 possible in
 nishchita rUpa in the sequence
 of clay-pot-clay-pitcher-clay-jug-clay etc.

 >> And again when it
 comes to mithyA Vs anirvachaneeya.if we take the
 example of rajju sarpa. Sarpa is ofcourse
 mithyA it is mere kalpita jneya
 due to the
 absence of yathArtha jnana of rajju. And in this example
 where
 can we accommodate sad-asad vilakshaNa
 when the rajju is kevala kalpita
 jneya sarpa
 which was / is / will never be there in rajju ?? After
 nishchita jnana of rajju would we say there was
 / is / will be
 anirvachaneeya (or sad-asad
 vilakshaNa) sarpa in rajju?? I don’t think so
 or am I missing something in this
 understanding?? Please clarify.

 MithyA and anirvachanIya mean the same thing,
 sadasadvilakShaNa. Although
 the
 traikAlika-niShedha holds for both the mithyA and asad
 vastu, the
 crucial difference is that a
 mithyA vastu is perceived as existing
 (sattvena pratIyamAna) in some substratum
 (adhiShThAna). In simple terms, a
 rajju-sarpa, despite the realization that it
 never existed at any time, we
 do admit it
 was perceived for some time in the rajju. This does not
 happen
 for an asad vastu. We can never say
 that we saw the hare's horn somewhere
 for some time and then realized it never
 exists. Or, in even simpler terms,
 we have
 to admit a mithyA vastu to *appear* as real for some time in
 some
 place, but an asad vastu will never
 appear as real at any place or during
 any
 time period.
