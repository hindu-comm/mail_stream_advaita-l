Namaste,

Further to the trailing mail, the brochure has been uploaded and the registration process has started.  

The dates of camp is from 10th May 2017 to 21st May 2017.  This is a residential camp which is free of cost.  
The vaTus need not pay anything and everything (morning milk, breakfast, lunch, dinner etc.) is borne by the 
trust and donors.

On the last day, there is an interactive session with old students who learnt sandhyavandana who would be 
sharing their experiences after they started doing the sandhya.  Even the parents are getting inspired when 
they are watching their children doing anuSTAna.  

A small exam would also be conducted to the students and would be presented with mementos.

with regards,
Sriram

 Namaste,

 Every year the trust bearing the name
 "Sri Janardananda Saraswati Swamy Samsmruthi Trust" conducts
 summer camp on Sandhyavandanam in Hyderabad for 10 days to
 sensitise the vaTus (brahmins only)

 The objective is to teach the method of
 sandhyavandanam and sadAchAra associated with it. This
 trust is associated with the name Shri.Janardanananda
 Saraswathi (in purva ashrama brahmasri svAdhyAya bhAskara
 kuppa lakshmavadhani garu). Under this trust, a veda
 pathashaala is run with the name "Veda Vyasa Pathashaala"
 and the vedic principal is Sri.Kuppa Anjaneya Sastry Garu
 who is the grandson of Lakshmavadhani Garu who happens to be
 my acharya under whom I am learning KYV. The camp
 would be presided by several ghanapaTis who would pay
 personal attention to the children. 

 The would be taught sandhya, agnikArya,
 basic sadAchara like snAnavidhi, bhasmadhAraNa,
 nityaprArthana stotrANi.

 The brahmacharis who are interested to
 learn the correct procedure of sandhyavandana can enrol with
 the pAThashaala. This year the camp is organized in
 Ashta lakshmi Temple, Chaitanyapuri, Near
 Dilsukhnagar. For further details one can contact the
