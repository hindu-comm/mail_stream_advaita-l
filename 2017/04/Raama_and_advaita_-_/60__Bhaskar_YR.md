praNAms Sri Kalyan prabhuji
Hare Krishna

I definitely take such fancy stories with a pinch of salt. However, the rAmAvatAra presents a genuine conundrum, for which Sri Anandji has given a most convincing explanation.


Ø   That is fine prabhuji.  I am not trying to say  what Sri Anand prabhuji said / might have said is wrong and unconvincing.  I was just sharing my thoughts on your observation that mAya deluding Ishwara.  Yes, again I repeat it was my understanding, you are welcome to ignore it if it is not palatable to you.  No hard feelings at all…After all these efforts are aimed towards getting ‘illuminating’ answer is it not??  Since that purpose is already served in your case, I reckon there is no need to look for second opinion.  Hence I said my answer is not necessary since your doubt has already been cleared.

Please dont club the enigma of rAma with other fanciful stories, most of which I must say are downright silly.


Ø     The enigma of rAma, Krishna, narasimha and other avatAra-s has to be traced back to Upanishad siddhAnta to know the tattva / essence behind it.  That which appears to be silly for you in other purANic and smruti stories could well be the most authentic pastime of  some Ishtadevata with definite purpose for others, is it not??  This is the reason why I insisted about our maturity level while understanding these conundrums in our smruti and purANic texts.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
