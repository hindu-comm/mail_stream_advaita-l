Namaste

We believe in Ishwara Anugrahaadeva Advaita Vaasana. Therefore without
Ishwara Anugraha there will not be success in Advaita Sadhana and
Ishwara Bhakti is important. Adi Sankara has composed Bhaja Govindam,
Vishnu Shatpadi and so on for this purpose. We believe Bhakta is like
a wave of the Brahman ocean. Wave is always from ocean but Ocean
cannot come from wave.

सत्यपि भेदापगमे
नाथ तवाहं न मामकीनस्त्वम् ।
सामुद्रो हि तरङ्गः
क्वचन समुद्रो न तारङ्गः ॥३॥
