Dear Sri Venkata Sriram,Who would teach whom?
You who has replied has to teach the one who has asked the questions.If you do not know the answer , please have the courtesy and honesty to say "I do not know".
The persons who know the answers to the questions that have been put have to give answers to the one who has asked the question. 

Wth respectful namaskarams,Sreenivasa Murthy

Namaste Murthy Ji,

................
I earnestly request Sri Subramanian or any other knowledgable members to 
show /teach me the methodology for cognizing the same truth 
....................

Who would teach whom ?

After certain stage of sAdhana in vichAra mArga, one is one's own spiritual master. The Srimad Bhagavatam (11.7.20) says:

आत्मनो गुरुरात्मैवपुरुषस्य विशेषतः ।
यत्प्रत्यक्षानुमानाभ्यां श्रेयोऽसावनुविन्दते ॥ ११.७.२०

"An intelligent person, expert in perceiving the world around him and applying sound logic, can achieve real benefit through his own intelligence. Thus sometimes one acts as one's own instructing spiritual master"

You may please ponder over this profound statement made in Uddhava Gita, which is taught to Uddava by Bhagavan Krishna.

regs,
Sriram
