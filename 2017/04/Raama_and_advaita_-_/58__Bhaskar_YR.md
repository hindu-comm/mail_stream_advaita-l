My question was whether Rama was sarvajna or not for the duration of his incarnation. I never realized that such simple question can get so complicated, with even prejudices being attributed to me. 

praNAms Sri Kalyan prabhuji
Hare Krishna

If we read the complete story / kAvya of rAma in rAmAyaNa within that frame work, no he was not a sarvajna or sarvashakta (atleast no categorical  display of these qualities from the hero of rAmAyaNa when it was badly required :-).  For that matter in varAha avatAra, unfortunately Sri mahA vishNu forgotten his true svarUpa and was happy with his wife, kids & siblings, he left the ksheera sAgara and happy to swim in gutter water :-) mahAjnAni shankara bhagavat pAda was oblivious to his true sanyasi nature after parakAya pravesha and 'enjoying' the royal life with queens in antaHpura.  prArabda karma vAdins have their own definitions for all these.  And others would read & understand all these fancy allegories with a big pinch of salt :-)

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
