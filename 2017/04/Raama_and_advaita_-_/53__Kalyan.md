Vidyasankarji
Your answer sounds more diplomatic rather than being illuminating.

 Sri Sriram quoted adhyAtma rAmAyaNa, while others quoted vAlmIki rAmAyaNa.
Once again, for us advaitins, there is no contradiction where you see one, because we have the bhAgatyAgalakshaNa method of reaching a deeper understanding. Yes, Rama was a human being as son of daSaratha and kausalyA and prince of ayodhyA. In that condition, he was not aja and ruler over vaikuNTha. Yes, Rama was ISvara, outside of the context of human parents and a city on earth where his human father was king.
Even for an ordinary jIva, who is not considered an avatAra, Sruti teaches tattvamasi, which we advaitins explain along very similar lines. Where others see never ending boundaries of bheda, we see abheda. To come to this way of understanding, one has to be prepared to leave bheda behind at some point.

Thanks for those who responded.
Sri Sriram has given arguments to show that Rama was Ishwara all along, while Sri Murthy and Sri Subrahmanian have given arguments to show that Rama genuinely suffered ignorance, so he was not really Ishwara.
It looks like there is a difference of opinion on this issue among advaitins themselves, since Madhusudhana Saraswati, in his Gudartha Dipika, treats Rama as Ishwara.

In the Panchadashi of Vidyaranya, in the 7th chapter we have a verse:

अवश्यंभाविभावानां प्रतीकारो भवेद्यदि ।
तदा दुःखैर्न लिप्येरन् नलरामयुधिष्ठिराः ॥१५५॥
156. If it were possible to avert the consequences of fructifying Karma,
Nala, Rama and Yudhisthira would not have suffered the miseries to which
they were subjected.
This verse is cited along with several other verses under the head
'bhārata' (Mahabharata?) by Sri Viśveśvara Saraswati in his Yatidharma
sangraha (p.140 print and 149 of pdf) while discussing the need for a
sannyāsin to leave things to prārabdha and not be concerned about the basic
needs for sustenance.
It appears that Vidyaranya too has cited that verse from some other source.
In the Valmiki Ramayana, Rama himself says, while lamenting: This situation
I am facing is only due to past adverse action.
