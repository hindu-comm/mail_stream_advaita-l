.......
Do advaitins believe that Rama has suffered genuine ignorance in the Ramayana or is it merely a play
...........

The answer is in Adhyatma Ramayana vide Rama Hrudaya

रामो न गच्छति न तिष्ठति नानुशोचत्याकाङ्क्षते त्यजति नो न करोति किञ्चित ।
आन्दमूर्तिरचलः परिणामहीनो मायागुणाननुगतो हि तथा विभाति ॥....................43

Rama is neither movable nor immovable; Rama is untouched with the sorrows nor 
desires anything; He neither does any action nor untouched with the actions;
He is of the nature of Bliss Absolute, attributeless and Changeless.

However, He appears to be so owing to the माया  which is associated with Him.

regs,
Sriram
