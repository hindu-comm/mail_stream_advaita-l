Sri Vidyasankarji, with all due respect to you (and I have a lot of respect for you) let us not unnecessarily complicate the issue. The question is very simple and straightforward. According to advaitins, did Rama really suffer from ignorance in the Ramayana? Or was he only acting as if he has suffered from ignorance, while in reality being aware of his true nature as the Atman all the time? 

Regards
Kalyan

 What do you mean by genuine
 ignorance? And which jIva, according to you, genuinely
 suffers from genuine ignorance?
 This is not a deflection of your question, but a
 call for clarification of your terms.

 Just curious. Do advaitins believe that Rama has suffered
 genuine ignorance in the Ramayana or is it merely a play?
 Please justify your statements using works of advaita
 AchAryas.

 Namaste Murthy Ji,



 ................

 I earnestly request Sri Subramanian or any other
 knowledgable members to

 show /teach me the methodology for cognizing the same truth

 Who would teach whom ?



 After certain stage of sAdhana in vichAra mArga, one is
 one's own spiritual master. The Srimad Bhagavatam
 (11.7.20) says:



 आत्मनो
 गुरुरात्मैवपुरुषस्य
 विशेषतः ।

 यत्प्रत्यक्षानुमानाभ्यां
 श्रेयोऽसावनुविन्दते
 ॥ ११.७.२०



 "An intelligent person, expert in perceiving the world
 around him and applying sound logic, can achieve real
 benefit through his own intelligence. Thus sometimes one
 acts as one's own instructing spiritual master"



 You may please ponder over this profound statement made in
 Uddhava Gita, which is taught to Uddava by Bhagavan
 Krishna.



 regs,

 Sriram
