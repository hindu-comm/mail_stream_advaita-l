Shri Anandji

Excellent! This is the kind of crystal clear answer that I was expecting. Many thanks to you. Thanks for taking the trouble to help clarify the advaitic position. At one go, you have shown that advaitins have adopted consistent positions on the issue. It was very illuminating to read that mAyA can delude Ishwara himself, when the latter wills it. Many thanks and praNAms again.

Best Regards
Kalyan

 It turns out the question of sarvajnatva and
 icchA-adhInatva of mAyA to
 Ishvara is not so simple after all.
