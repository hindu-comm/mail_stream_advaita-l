alli nODalu rAma illi nODalu rAma |

ellelli nODidaralli shrIrAma ||

Hither Rama, thither Rama, wherever I look, I see Sri Rama there.

IvElE naranAgi irabAradendeNisi *dEva rAmachaMdra jagavella tAnAda*||

Seeing the frightening power of RavaNa the vAnara army took to flight
immediately.  Rama thought ‘Now I should not remain a human any longer’ and
He ‘became’ the entire world.  And see the consequence of this:

avanige iva rAma ivanige ava rAma avaniyOlIpari rUpavuMTe |

lavamAtradi asura durularellaru avaravar hODedADi hatarAgi hOdaru ||

Each one sees Rama in the other’s place.  A sees B as Rama and *vice versa*.
Is there a form other than that of Rama’s in the entire universe!!

The result of this transformation is two-fold.  On the asura side, quickly
they killed each other and ended themselves.  For, one asura saw Rama, as
an enemy, where another asura stood.  Thus each asura saw another asura as
Rama, the adversary and beheaded him.  This mutual Rama-darshana decimated
the asura army.  Now what happened in the vAnara army?

The noble-minded Hanuman and others, too, saw Rama in the place of each of
themselves.  Out of devotion, joy, they embraced each other and danced in
ecstasy.  In a moment, the Lord Purandara Vitthala, Sri Rama, remained as
He Himself.

In the above song we see beautifully depicted: सर्वं ब्रह्ममयम्, सर्वं
खल्विदं ब्रह्म, नेह नानास्ति किन्चन, आत्मैवेदं सर्वम्, ब्रह्मैवेदं सर्वम् –
all scriptural passages declaring that Everything is Brahman indeed.  Also
the passage: तत्त्वमेव त्वमेव तत्, अहं ब्रह्मास्मि, तत्त्वमसि, ज्ञानी
त्वात्मैव, etc. – all proclaiming the fact that the individual is in truth
Brahman alone. Of course, the names and forms the inert world possessed
were now disregarded and only Rama, Brahman, mattered for all, everywhere.
This is what constitutes the demonstration of jagat mithyA.

Hear this song:
