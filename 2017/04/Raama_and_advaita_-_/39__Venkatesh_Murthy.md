Namaste

There are books like Adhyatma Ramayana if you study them you may get
the Hanuman's realization. They are not Sruti. Therefore you can do
independent study. Only for Vedanta we require Guru. If a sincere
person is reading Adhyatma Raamaayana, Geeta and Advaita part of
Bhagavata in Uddhava Geeta, Vishnu and Siva Puranas he will get Jnana.
May be he will automatically search and come to a proper Guru and that
Guru will show him the path to Moksha.
