A common mistake is to hold everything that is mithyA or arising out of
mithyA as irrelevant to the realization of the pAramArthika tattva. The
discussion we had a few days ago showed this is not the case. Remember
Madhusudana's pithy statement: bhrama-janyatvasya
viShayabAdha-aprayojakatvAcca. In fact, what is irrelevant here is the
(erroneous) "rule" that the end-result of a bhrama (error) is always
another error. There are many exceptions to this.
