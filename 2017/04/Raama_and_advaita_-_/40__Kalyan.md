Namaste all
Just curious. Do advaitins believe that Rama has suffered genuine ignorance in the Ramayana or is it merely a play? Please justify your statements using works of advaita AchAryas.

 Namaste Murthy Ji,

Who would teach whom ?

After certain stage of sAdhana in vichAra mArga, one is one's own spiritual master. The Srimad Bhagavatam (11.7.20) says:

आत्मनो गुरुरात्मैवपुरुषस्य विशेषतः ।
यत्प्रत्यक्षानुमानाभ्यां श्रेयोऽसावनुविन्दते ॥ ११.७.२०

"An intelligent person, expert in perceiving the world around him and applying sound logic, can achieve real benefit through his own intelligence. Thus sometimes one acts as one's own instructing spiritual master"

You may please ponder over this profound statement made in Uddhava Gita, which is taught to Uddava by Bhagavan Krishna.

regs,
Sriram
