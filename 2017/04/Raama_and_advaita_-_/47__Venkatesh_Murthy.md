If you are asking a Vyavaharika question this question is not for
Advaitis only but for everybody like Visistadvaitis, Dvaitis and so
on. It is like asking a question in Physics or Chemistry. Valmiki
Raamaayana will have the answer. Unlike Krishna Raama did not show
Sarvajnatva in his Avatara. Otherwise He could have avoided chasing
the Golden deer. He could have detected real Seeta was not kidnapped
but Maayaa Seeta and not felt grief and cried. In Krishna Avatara also
Brahma kidnaps all the Gopa boys and calves for some time. But Krishna
did not cry like Raama. He immediately knew Brahma has kidnapped them.
He created new boys and calves. Nobody knew this but only Balaraama
knew it.

Some people say Raama was only acting like a ordinary man to show how
to be ideal man but He knew everything. Some people like Iskcon say
Krishna only is Poorna Avatara and others are Amsha Avataras. You can
read all arguments on all sides and decide.
