Hither Rama, thither Rama, wherever I look, I see Sri Rama there.

Seeing the frightening power of RavaNa the vAnara army took to flight
immediately.  Rama thought ‘Now I should not remain a human any longer’ and
He ‘became’ the entire world.  And see the consequence of this:

............................................................................................................................

I am reminded of a joke which my rAmAyaNa teacher used to tell me.  

Ravana was observing the valour and strength of Rama and His fighting 
techniques all through out the war.  When his turn of fight came, he observed
the Rama's prowess in the battlefield.  Since then, Ravana was so frightened
that he used to see Rama everywhere and whenever the two words "rA" & "mA"
were heard by him, he used to flee from that place.  

One the 1st day of the battle, after returning to his fort, he was having dinner 
and his wife Mandodari was serving sumptuous food.  She recollected that
she forgot to add "asafoetida" (hing) in sambaar and asked whether she should
serve it.  The question was in sanskrit (as in those days, people used to converse
in that language !)

सूपे रामठं परिवेषयामि वा ?  (रामठ = asafoetida)

The moment Ravana heard the name राम ; without even letting the Mandodari completing 
the letter ठ, ran from the Kitchen and hid himself :))

This is how the rAma-nAma works !!

regs,
sriram
