Sri Bhaskarji
The answer provided by Sri Anandji is intellectually very satisfying.
If you have a better answer for the rAma avatAra conundrum, you may provide it. With all due respect to you, I was not convinced by your previous answer.

 It was very illuminating to read that mAyA can delude Ishwara himself, when the latter wills it.

Kindly pardon me for interfering here. I donâ€™t know what has been discussed in those provided links. But if the above is what you have understood from those discussions then I have to say something. IMHO, mAya is NOT a separate Shakti that is sitting aloof from Ishwara to delude him after getting his permission or if he wills it. mAyA is what Ishwara's Shakti, mAyA is nothing but Ishwara's will or the willingness of Ishwara itself is mAya. There is no difference between Shakti and Shaktimaan. Mama svarUpabhUta madeeya mAyA clarifies geetAchArya. Contextually the concept of mAya has been explained as IshwarAdheena as well. And as far as my knowledge goes nowhere it has been said that mAya has the separate power to delude even Ishwara after obtaining permission from him and over a period of him this mAyA Shakti would make Ishwara to forget his Ishwaratva itself !! To the question of Arjuna : aparaM bhavatO janma paraM janma vivasvataH, kathametat vijAneeyAM tvamAdau prOktavAniti..obviously Arjuna thinking here sUrya is elder to Krishna :-) bhagavAn subsequently clarifies : prakrutiM svAm adhishtAya saMbhavAmyAtma mAyayA...the prakruti / mAya is under the control of Ishwara and he KNOWS it that he has many incarnations whereas Arjuna does not. 

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
