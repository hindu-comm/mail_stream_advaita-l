Sri Bhaskar

My question was whether Rama was sarvajna or not for the duration of his incarnation. I never realized that such simple question can get so complicated, with even prejudices being attributed to me. 

Regards
Kalyan

 Your answer sounds more diplomatic rather
 than being illuminating. RegardsKalyan

 It seems that you are more interested in
 analyzing the answer than 'understanding'.  If
 that is true then you must be having some prejudices with
 regard to the answer you are getting. Hence it is very
 difficult for you to get any illuminating answer :-) 

 Was rAma the real sufferer
 ?? the answer is depends on the answer you have to the
 following questions : was rAma really the son of
 dasharatha?? Was rAma really the husband of Seeta ?? Was
 rAma really the king of ayOdhya?? Was rAma really went to
 forest for 14 years?? Was rAma really the father of lava
 and kushA ? etc. if your answer is in affirmative then the
 answer to your primary question is too a big YES. OTOH, if
 you think it is all his leela vinOda, he is no more dehavAn
 though he is looking dehavAn then the answer to above
 questions including that of yours, a big NO. We can pick
 our choice according to our spiritual and philosophical
 maturity. 

 Hari Hari Hari
 Bol!!!
 bhaskar
