Namaste

The explanation is nice but there can be a better explanation. The entire
Srushti is full of Dosha. If it is Ishwara Srushti the Dvaitis have to
answer how Ishwara with Ananta Kalyaana Gunas can create this World with
misery and suffering.  It becomes a Dosha for Him. Example - how can He
create our body with Childhood, Youth and Old age and make Childhood and
Old Age so unfit for Jnaana? It is a defective body. A Sarvajna cannot
create something with defects. It is easier to say this World is Jeeva
Srushti or Avidyaa Kalpita only because it has so much Dosha. It is product
of Avidyaa. Nothing is perfect in the World. All this is there because we
think Srushti is real.

But if we accept Srushti is Illusion like a Dream we can be at peace with
it. This can happen with Grace of God like in Ishwara Anugrahaadeva Advaita
Vaasanaa.
