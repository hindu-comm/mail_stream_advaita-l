Hi, interested in philosophy. Belonging to tatva vada school but want to
understand advaita to clearly understand concepts as both are so interlinked
since centuries. I feel one cannot learn one without understanding another
school of thought

My name is Gratianus Sylvester. I'm interested in advaita vedanta,
especially in Shankara's commentaries. I appreciated the high level of
contributions in your mailing list. I thank you in advance for the precious
information and guidance.


Priya Parameswaran
------------------

I've been a bhakthA and admirer of Adishankara BhagavatpAdA my whole life.
Though a fan of all the three mArgas -jnAna, Bhakti and karma, I've always
been drawn to the  jnAna mArgam since my teen years. That said, I am a
samayAcAra shrIvidyA upAsaka - my personal saadanaa, nidhidhyasana and all
spiritual pursuits always sublate to the singular advaita bhAvam and ideal.
I've been meaning to get on this mailing list for a while, and wonder why
it's taken me so long.  It is my fervent belief that all blessings in my
life are through the Abiding Grace of our AcAryAs, ubhaya jagadgurus in
Sringeri - I feel blessed to be part of a forum dedicated to promoting the
right knowledge and discussion about the tenets of advaita Vedanta. Thank
you for this service, Vidya.
