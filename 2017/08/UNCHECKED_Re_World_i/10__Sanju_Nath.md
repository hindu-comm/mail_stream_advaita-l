>> If you want to go by shAstra and bhAshya pratipAdana, the srushti is from Ishwara who is nitya avidyAvinirmukta. Samashti buddhi is mahat tattva and that which has been identified with this mahat tattva as upAdhi is hiraNyagarbha who has the abhimAna that he is the samashti buddhi.  The seed of this samashti buddhi (jagat beeja) sprout there is an appearance of Prathama shareera (prathamaja) and that which has the upAdhi of this shareera is called virAt purusha or prathamaja or prajaapati brahma or chaturmukha brahma.  There is an elaborate discussion with regard to srushti krama in shruti, smruti, prakaraNa like pancheekaraNa etc.  Taitireeya akAshAt vAyuH, vAyoragniH, agnerApaH, apaH pruthivi, pruthivyA OshadhayaH, from Oshadhi annaM and then there is a talk of manushya (annAt purushaH).  So, if at all bhAshyakAra talks about some avidyA kalpita srushti by this manusya, that srushti must be something different from this Ishwara srushti which has the base in shruti, smruti and bhAshya works.
