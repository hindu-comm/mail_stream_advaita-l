Fantastic excerpt from the Mahabharatha. From page 6, "Gods, Asuras, Nagas, Rakshasas, Pisachas, human beings,birds, Gandharvas, Yakshas and other creatures: with the entire universe, we know, have allsprung from thee."
Does this not suggest SDV? How should we understand this in order to make it DSV? Or was this eulogy merely Aupacharika? In other words, Narayana said all this but did not mean it?
