DSV is the precursor to ajāti. 
A : So DSV is not just a prakriya but the main principle of Advaita? Because prakriyas can be bypassed but not tenets.

There is no Brahman idea in Sankhya/yoga. The Vedanta position Shankara is stating there is: no many-ness but one Consciousness only. 
A : The Vedantins call it Brahman, the Sankhya-Yogins call it Purusha. Btw Shankaracharya admits the 24 tattva classification in Prapanchasara Tantra. The Purusha of S/Y too is neither the cause nor the effect.
