> Eka jIva vAda ; jIvo Brahmaiva nAparah. This is so in respect of all the

> perhaps the Bhamati school to some extent. Thus while interpreting the term
> dRShTi sRShTi vAda or Eka jIva vAda appearing in various texts, it may be
> preferable to recognize that the texts could be using the term in the
