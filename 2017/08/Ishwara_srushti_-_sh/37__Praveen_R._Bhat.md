​​Namaste all,

I've a particular question about how is the tattvamasi-vAkya interpreted
using *only* bhAShya. If the interpretation uses jahadajahallakShaNa
/bhAgatyAgalakShaNa or not?

If not, then is sRShTikartA Ishvara = jIva, as is, with whatever right or
erroneous knowledge one has about the term jIva?

If yes, where are those lakShaNas specifically mentioned by Bhagavan
Bhashyakara?

I'd appreciate the reply from anyone who either subscribes to the view that
only bhAShya should be studied or knows their perspective.

​Thanks
,
