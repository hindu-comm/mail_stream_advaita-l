Dear Sri Bhaskar ji,

Sri SSS's translation of the passage I cited is here, which is quite
contrary to what you have said above,:

This is on p.710 of the Chandogyopanishat of APK publication:

http://www.adhyatmaprakasha.org/php/bookreader/templates/book.php?type=kannada&book_id=097B&pagenum=0001#page/203/mode/1up


sattu yochisi noḍitu. hege? bahaLavāgi āguvenu. prakarṣadinda huṭṭuvenu.
hege maṇṇu ghaṭave  muntāda ākāradinda huṭṭuvudo, athavā haggave muntādaddu
buddhiparikalpitavāda (3) hāve muntādaddara ākāradinda huṭṭuvudo hāge(4).

Sat deliberated. How? I shall become many, be born immensely. Just as clay
is born in the form of pot, etc. or rope etc. due to imagination is born as
sake, etc. so too..

Sri SSS gives two footnotes for the above translation:

3. ī viśeṣaṇavu hindakkū anvayisutte; kāryavū buddhikalpitave, adu
kāraṇakkinta bEreyāguvudE illa.

[This adjective (imagined by the intellect) applies to the earlier (stage)
too; the effect too is an imagination. That is not different from the
cause. (By this remark, Sri SSS accepts that the cause-effect relation in
advaita is not any pariṇāma but vivarta.)]

4. bErondu padārthavu sEradiddarū bahaLavāguvudu hEge? emba ākṣepakke idu
uttara. sadrUpavāgiyE iddukoṇḍu bErebEreyāgi tOruvudE bahutva.
Tai.Bhā...nOḍi.

[How can X become many without any external thing joining it? To this
objection, the bhāṣya gives the answer. 'manifoldness is nothing but
remaining as Existent alone, just appearing as many. See Taittiriya
bhashya...]

>From this translation, it is clear that your thinking: (1) creation is a
projection of brahman's mind/hiraṇyagarbha, virāt's projection... is not
what SSS says. (2) that the jīva not cognizing the underlying Brahman is
what is stated by the bhāṣya as erroneous perception like rajju sarpa - is
also not endorsed by Sri SSS. He does not separate the two aspects of the
bhāṣya: buddhiparikalpitena and rajjusarpavat. He takes the two as
conveying the cause as imagining and the effect as error as rope-snake.

This alone I wanted to convey through the particular bhāṣya: even the
sarvajna brahman's creation, that is, becoming many, is held to be
'imagination like rope-snake'.

subbu
