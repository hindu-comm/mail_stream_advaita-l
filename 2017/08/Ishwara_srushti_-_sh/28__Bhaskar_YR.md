Kindly pardon me, it is really sickening to note sometimes in Advaita vedAnta  nAstika or chArvAka vAda gaining  a back door entry though it may not be the intention of propagators of jeeva bhrAnti srushti instead of vedAnta / bhAshya pradipAdita or sammata brahma abhinna nimittOpadAna kAraNa srushti  or Ishwara hetuka srushti or vedAnta maryAda srushti.   

As per vedAnta, shankara prakriyAdhArita Advaita vedAnta, brahma is the jagat kAraNa, it is brahman (chetana) alone prior to srushti thought about srushti and does the srushti kriya  with its intrinsic powers like sarvajnatvaM and sarvashaktitvaM.

Shruti vehemently announces that : sarvaM khalvidaM brahma tajjalAn iti shAntyupaaseeta.  bhAshyakAra clarifies : sarvamidaM vikArajAtaM brahmaiva tajjatvAt, tallatvAt, tadanatvAccha.  And Itareya quite explicit in this regard : AtmA vA edam eka evAgra Aseet and there is nothing apart from it na anyat kiMchana mishat sa Ekshata imaannu lokAnnu srujA iti, sa emAllokAnasrujata, sa EkshAmchakre prANamasrujata prashna shruti, mundaka : yaH sarvajnaH sarvavidyasya jnAnamayaM tapaH, tasmAt etat brahma nAma rUpaM annaM cha jAyate.  

Based on these shruti statements ( and other numerous shruti quotes with regard to brahma kAratvaM ) bhAshyakAra in the very second sUtra janmAdyasya yatha comprehensively again  clarifies  that neither pradhAna nor anU nor saMsAri jeeva are the cause of this jagat.  Please refer these bhAshya quotes :

// quote //

Asya jagatO nAmarUpAbhyAM vyAkrutasya aneka katrubhOkta saMyuktasya prati niyata desha kAla nimitta kriyAphalAshrayasya manasApi achintya rachanArUpasya janma sthiti bhangaM yataH sarvajnAt, sarvashakteH kAraNAt bhavati ' tad brahma' iti vAkya sheshaH....

//  unquote //

And it would be worthy to note that in continuation bhAshyakAra clarifies what I said above :  

// quote //

Na yathOkta visheshaNasya jagataH yathOktavisheshaNaM IshvaraM muktvA anyataH pradhAnAt achetanAt, aNubhyaH, abhavAt, 'SAMSAARINO' vA utpattyAdi saMbhAvayitum shakyaM.

And finally didn't shankara himself says Ishwara's upAdhi, omniscience and omnipotence etc. is kevala avidyAkruta in araHbhaNAdhikaraNa sUtra bhAshya ??  yes, when one realizes  the paramArtha jnana i.e. idaM sarvaM yadayamAtA, brahmaivedaM sarvaM, AtmaivedaM sarvaM, neha nAnAsti kiMchana etc. the Ishwara the ruler, the jagat which is being ruled, the lordship of Ishwara over the jeeva-s etc. is dvaita only which is avidyA only due to parichinna drushti that splits in the form of  nAnA which will be completely eradicated by the dawn of Atmaikatva jnAna.  And it does not anyway propagate the 'anishta' theory of jeeva bhraAti srushti' which is directly doing the shruti hAni, siddhAnta hAni and bhAshya viruddha as well.  

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
