Namaste

Yes Jeeva Kruta Srushti theory is a back door entry to Moksha itself. It is
a secret door to Moksha is the statement of Praachina Acharyas like Swami
Vidyaranya and not some modern Hippy Swami saying when he is smoking and
drunk. How can we reject it?

Bhaamati has clearly said Ishwara has nothing or ZERO role in Avidyaa
dealings. He is always Nitya Shuddha Buddha Paramaatma. Therefore Rama Raya
Kavi has correctly said Bhaamati Prasthana is saying Ishwara is
Nirupaadhika Brahma only. In Sankara Bhashya also he has many times used
Ishwara word for Nitya Shudda Brahma only. I can find the references but
you will say you cannot see them.

If Ishwara as Nirupaadhika Brahma  is untouched by Avidyaa there is only
one suspect for being Srushti Kartaa and it is Jeeva. He has created all
this Dream with Avidyaa.
