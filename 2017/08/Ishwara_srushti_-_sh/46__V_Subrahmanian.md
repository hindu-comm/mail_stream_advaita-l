In addition to the Chandogya Bhāṣya instance shown below, there is also the
Bṛhadāraṇyaka 2.5.19 instance where the avidyā element is stated by
Shankara in Īśwara sṛṣṭi:



इन्द्रो मायाभिः पुरुरूप ईयते युक्ता ह्यस्य हरयः शता दशेति ।

इन्द्रः परमेश्वरः मायाभिः प्रज्ञाभिः नामरूपभूतकृतमिथ्याभिमानैर्वा न तु
परमार्थतः, पुरुरूपः बहुरूपः, ईयते गम्यते — एकरूप एव प्रज्ञानघनः सन्
अविद्याप्रज्ञाभिः ।

Translation by Swami Mādhavānanda:

The same Lord, in the process of manifesting name and form. 'transformed
Himself in accordance with each form.' Why did He come in so many forms?
That form of His was for the sake of making Him known. Were name and form
not manifested,
the transcendent nature of this Self as Pure Intelligence would not be
known. When, however, name and form are·manifested as the body and organs, it
is possible to know Its nature. The Lord on account of Māyā or diverse
knowledge, or (to give an alternative meaning) the false identifications
created by name, form and the elements, not in truth  -  is perceived as
manifold, because of these notions superimposed by ignorance, although He
is ever the same Pure Intelligence.

Sri SSS in his Kannada translation for the above says:

Indranu, Parammeśwaranu, māyegalinda prajñegaḷinda, athavā,
nāmarūpabhūtakṛtavāda mithyābhimānagaḷinda - iṣṭe horatu nijavāgiyalla -
 pururūpanāgi bahurūpanāgi kāṇisuttāne tiḷiya baruttāne. prajñāna ghanavāgi
onde rūpadilliddukoṇḍe avidyāprajñegaḷinda (bahuvāgi kāṇisuttāne).

Sri SSS gives a footnote:

māyegaḷu endare 'indriya prajñegaḷinda' endu ondu
artha.'nāmarūpagaḷindāgiruva bere bereya kāryakaraṇasanghātagaḷa (body-mind
complexes) abhimānadinda' endu innondu artha.

After saying the above, which is a clear translation of the bhāṣya, the
author cites the GK 3.24 bhāṣya in the footnote. This is shown below:

नेह नानेति चाम्नायादिन्द्रो मायाभिरित्यपि ।
अजायमानो बहुधा जायते मायया तु सः ॥ २४ ॥

इति
निन्दितत्वाच्च सृष्ट्यादिभेददृष्टेः ॥
Sri SSS brings out the following salient features of the above bhāṣya;
1. If creation were real, then the shruti would not say 'neha nānāsti
kinchana' to deny the real created manifoldness.
2. Therefore the creation concocted by the shruti with a view to teach
realization of identity, is unreal, abhūtā eva. 'āddarinda sṛṣṭiyu,
prāṇasamvādadante, ātmaikatvavannu tiḷisuvudakke kalpitavāgide; nijavallavE
alla.
Thus, in both the places, Br.up. and Mā.kā. translations, Sri SSS is
clearly saying that the creation taught in the shruti, through Parameshwara
becoming many, is not at all real; it is an appearance due to
avidyā/indirya. The shruti itself is using the word 'māyā' to inform us
that it is an unreal creation.
