Namaste Sri Bhaskar

I can now see the Big Problem you are having. For Advaitis there should not
be any focus on Srushti but only on Adviteeya Brahma. Srushti is not the
Main Message of Sruti. Srushti is not the Main Message of Bhashyakaara
also. Srushti is not the Main Message of Gaudapaada. As a matter of fact he
says there is NO Srushti. That is Ajaata Vaada.

Therefore why are we wasting time in arguing who is responsible for
Srushti? Who cares if it is Ishwara or if it is Jeeva? There is no Srushti.
It is like arguing by two persons seeing a mirage water. One person is
saying he will drink it first and another is saying he will drink it first.
