Dear List,
Namaste!
I have a query - can you please confirm whether the concept of division
of āvaraṇśakti as asattavāpadaka and abhānāpādaka is the contribution of
Madhusūdana or any other Advaitin before him has mentioned it?


A quick reply is Swami Vidyaranya has mentioned it in the Panchadashi in a
very detailed manner: naasti na bhaati..Please check the Unicode text with
a these words.

Thanks and Regards,Niranjan Saha
