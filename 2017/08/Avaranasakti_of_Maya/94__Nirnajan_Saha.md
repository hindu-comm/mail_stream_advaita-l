Dear List,
Namaste!
I have a query - can you please confirm whether the concept of division ofāvaraṇśakti as asattavāpadaka and abhānāpādaka is the contribution of Madhusūdana or any other Advaitin before him has mentioned it?


A quick reply is Swami Vidyaranya has mentioned it in the Panchadashi in a very detailed manner: naasti na bhaati..Please check the Unicode text with a these words.

Thanks and Regards,Niranjan Saha
