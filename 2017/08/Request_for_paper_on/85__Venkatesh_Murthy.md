Namaste

You can send email directly to author and he may send you the paper. But
there are also Sringeri scholar written books to defend Advaita Sampradaaya
against SSS criticisms. I don't have them but somebody like Sri V
Subrahmanian in this list may help you. I saw one book sometime back in a
friend's house by Sringeri on Panchapaadika and in that he has given
arguments against SSS.
