Hi Praveen, Sorry, I missed your email on this. A while back I was busy and
was not reading emails regularly and I might have let this slip. Aditya, if
you need it, let me know. I'll mail it to you. If you have any comments or
questions, please contact by private email. I think we have exhausted the
list with discussions on it.

My interests have also diverged somewhat. These days I am more interested
in the pUrva rather than the uttara mImAmsA.

Rama
