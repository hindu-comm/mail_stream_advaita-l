Namaste
You can send email directly to author and he may send you the paper. But there are alsoSringeri scholar written books to defend Advaita Sampradaaya against SSS criticisms. I don't have them but somebody like Sri V Subrahmanian in this list may help you. I saw one book sometime back in a friend's houseby Sringeri on Panchapaadika and in that he has given arguments against SSS.

Namaste All,

I was going through list archives and found a thread on SSS. However I could not find the doc as the link has expired. Hence I request members to share the doc if it is still available. Thanks in advance.

I am talking about this : http://www.advaita-vedanta. org/archives/advaita-l/2007- April/018627.html
