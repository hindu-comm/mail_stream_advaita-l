Namaste,

Umesh ji is a siddha purusha.  He has got spiritual powers and can read the mind of the
person whether he is a real mumukshu / jignasu or not.

He interacts with real mumukshus and not a time-pass sort of person.

I never had a chance to meet him but if God wills, would definitely meet
such an interesting sadhaka.

regs,
sriram
