I have used a wrong word for Umesh ji.  He is *not* a sadhaka but a 
a jnAni & yogi of highest order.

Initiated into the secrets of Srividya from Shri.Abhinava Vidya Tirtha Swamigal 
and attained mantra siddhi in several mantras including the Nrisimha mantra.

Underwent prasthAna-traya shAnti traditionally in Sringeri under Sri.Abhinava Vidya Tirtha Ji
and Sri.Bharati Tirtha Swamiji 

regs,
sriram
