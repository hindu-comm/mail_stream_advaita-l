Dear Sri Venkat ji,

It is heartening to note that you have set your mind on this great endeavor
of bringing out the content of the Advaitasiddhi into the English language.
Even though this work demands a high level of mastery of navya nyāya
concepts, yet with the help of the painstaking and sincere exposition of
the text by the three Advaita Acharyas of Chennai, as you have said, the
work of rendering it into English becomes possible, if not an easy one.

The best wishes of all of us, the seeking Advaitins, to you.  You may think
of giving a number to each article to help those who follow them.

शुभं भूयात् । विघ्नराजः पातु ।

Thanks and regards
subbu
