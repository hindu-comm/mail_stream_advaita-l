Four useful pocket books on Mind Management Techniques

Sri S.K.Jayakumar (who is a member in Advaita l) is a very resourceful
person residing in Bengaluru. After he lost his eyesight a few years ago,
he sprung into action to acquire several skills that completely raised him
above the setback the disability could let in.

He has a lively multi-session yoga class at home where several persons,
young and old, men and women attend. He has combined Bhagavadgita with the
classes and has now brought out a four-volume pocket size booklet titled
'Mind Management Techniques':


   1.  Guidance for Growth and improvement
   2. Success Stimulators and Achievers' Guide
   3. Source of Solutions to any problem
   4. Enhance Happiness and Enrich your Life

All these are compilations by Sri Jayakumar, who has behind him a rich
spiritual learning and practice under the guidance and blessings of (late)
HH Swami Dayananda Saraswati. He is an ardent student of Vedanta and Swami
Paramarthananda ji's recorded classes have been his forte. He has thousands
of hours of recordings with him. His website is: saipaduka.org

I browsed through the above booklets and found the material to be well
presented. He has refrained from filling the books with scriptural
quotations but has presented the crucial message of the Upanishads in
language that appeals to the thinking mind. One can contact him through the
website and get more details about the above booklets and other activities.
