Namaste

We can give another answer with information from Puranas and other texts.
Ishwara can also have sin. Why not? Raama got sin after killing Raavana
because he was a Brahmin. He had to do worship of Siva only in
Raameshwaram. Indra got sin after killing Vrtra the Brahmin. Pandavas got
sin by killing all the relatives. They went to Kedarnath to worship Siva.
Like this Siva also got sin. How? He shot his arrow at Prajapati when he
was mating with his daughter in deer form and cut his head. Therefore
anybody can get sin. That is why they say the born baby must get Samskaaras
for purification. The Samskaaras like Naamakarana are for purification from
sins.
