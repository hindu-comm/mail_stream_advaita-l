Ultimately, everything boils down to "दीर्घस्वप्नं इदं जगत्"

Yes, ultimately, everything (including jAgrat, svapna sushupti)  boils down to 'svapna' or deergha svapnaM only,  tasya traya avasathA trayee svapnAH...says shruti to drive home the point that Atman / brahman is avasthAteeta.  It does not anyway mean, atleast IMHO, even vyavahArically there is absolutely no difference between svapna and jAgrat jagat and both are mere avidyAkalpita srushti of bhrAnta,  parichinna,  individual,  tiny jeeva.  It is because of this reason only shruti talks about the 'dreams' of jnAni-s.  And this dream is the result of sarvAtmabhAva saMskAra clarifies bhAshyakAra elsewhere.  He gets the dream like he has become devata, king, everything.  

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
