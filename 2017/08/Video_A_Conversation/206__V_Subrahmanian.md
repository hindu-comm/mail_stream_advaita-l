Video: 'A Conversation with Vidyasankar ji'

Here is the link to a very informative and rewarding conversation with Sri
Vidyasankar Sundaresan by Sri Prashant Parikh:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Alwaw1jHna0&feature=youtu.be

A number of topics are covered in the dialogue, with a promise to take this
forward.

I personally feel this is a very unique conversation that answers a lot of
questions that contemporary Hindus, Brahmanas, sƒÅdhaka-s, etc. might be
having and wanting to be resolved.

The urge to share the link to the video with others comes naturally to
whoever listens to it. That is true of me.
