Fantastic really. Look forward to a series of such conversations.  As a
larger effort, sometimes I wonder for our sake and for future generations,
if we should archive these questions- these questions that keep coming up
and that every generation of of people who love the tradition has to
rediscover all on its own, often forgetting that giants of the past have
explored these questions at great depth- archive answers and approaches to
these questions in a sampradaya neutral way.
