Hari Om,

Namaste.

Vedanta teachers say :  do shravaNa,  manana, nididhyaasana

Bhagawan Ramana Maharshi says:  do self inquiry by way of "Who am I?"

Both appear to be telling different things. Is it possible to reconcile
them? Is it nididhyaasana that Bhagawan Ramana Maharshi referring to?


Thank you and regards
