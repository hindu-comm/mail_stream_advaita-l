Dear
Self enquiry will lead to the three things you had mentioned. When you
search for who you are exactly then you will know you are not the body and
you are not your own mind too. When you search further you will need
assistance of sravanam, mananam and nidhidhyasanam. The first two are steps
to the third one. These things are difficult to get at as these require
abhyasam and vairagyam. Practice and steadfastness. Self enquiry will
definitely be helpful.
R. Krishnamoorthy.
