Prof VN Jha's work will be helpful.

*Title*: Dictionary of Nyaya Terms; Sanskrit- English
*Author*: Prof V. N. Jha
*Publisher*: Centre of Advanced Study in Sanskrit, Pune
*Year*: 2010​

For the understanding of the technical terms of Navya-Nyaya in Hindi, Prof
Baliram Shukla's work will be more useful.

*Title*: Navya-Nyaya ke Paribhashik Padarth
*Author*: Prof Baliram Shukla
*Publisher*: Paramarsha Pratishtan, Pune
*Year*: 1998

Thank you.
