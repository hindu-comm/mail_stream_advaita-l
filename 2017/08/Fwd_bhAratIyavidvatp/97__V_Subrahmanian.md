Dear Venkat ji,

Many thanks for the fine summary of the discussion. I remember hearing from
the Siddhi talks that Bhāmatīkāra accepts the vākyajanya jñānam to be of
the 'upahita brahman' (and not shuddha brahman) and that that is sufficient
for avidyānivṛtti. Siddhikāra cites this.   I have not located so far the
Bhāmatī or Siddhi portion where this occurs. In any case, does this have
any bearing on the Advaitin's reply to the question on hand?

regards
subbu
