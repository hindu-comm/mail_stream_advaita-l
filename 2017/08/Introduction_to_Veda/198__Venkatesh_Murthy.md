Namaste

I have downloaded Kindle App and the book Introduction to Vedanta. On page
58 it is said 'Brahman is indescribable, indefinable and unqualifiable'.
How? I think Jagat is called as Anirvachaniya because we cannot define it
is Real or False. It is not Sat, not Asat and not Sadasat. Brahman is Sat.
Brahman has to be Sat, Cit and Ananda or Satyam, Jnanam and Anantam.
