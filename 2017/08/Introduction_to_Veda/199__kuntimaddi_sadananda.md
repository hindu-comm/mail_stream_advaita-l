Shree Venkatesh - PraNAms
Thanks for getting the book and reading and raising the question.
Here is my simple answer to the question - it is indescribable - anantatvaat. - since it is infinite. Infinite is not a description but negation of any thing finite as Brahman. Only finites can be described, defined and qualified. All the so-called qualifications are lakshnasor pointer for the mind to contemplate and dis-cover the which cannot be discovered.
Please think it over.
