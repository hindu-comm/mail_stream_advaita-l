Somewhat related: as today was janmashtami, I was reading the 
Krishnajanmakatha from Bhagavata Purana and in 10.2.32-43 Krishna Bhagavan 
relates to his parents Vasudeva and Devaki that this is third time He has 
been born as their son.

In the Svayambhuva manvantara, He was born to Sutapa Prajapati and his wife
Prshni hence His name was Prshnigarbha.

The second time He was born to Maharshi Kashyapa and his wife Aditi as 
Upendra or Vamana.

And the third is as Krishna.
