Namaste

Well said Sri Praveen Mahodaya. I also think Sri Sadananda cannot say
Waking world is not Praatibhaasika. The conclusion Siddhanta from Vichara
Sagara and other texts is showing there is no Vyaavahaarika reality. It is
again from equality of Dream and Waking states we say Vyaavahaarika reality
is not there in Waking also. There is also objection saying in Waking state
things are not changing from one state to another. If a Pot is next to you
when you go to sleep even after waking up you will see the Pot on your
side. The other things in the room are also there like before going to
sleep. But in a dream it is not like that. Today you may be dreaming you
are in some place - Mumbai. Next night you may be dreaming you are in a
different place - Chennai.

But the Siddhanta Muktavali author has shown this is also Illusion. What is
happening is you think the Waking world is the same as the Waking world
before you sleep and dream. But it is Illusion only. The Waking world after
you get up looks like the previous Waking world because of Ati Saadrushya
but it is actually not the same Waking world. There is no proof even in
Science to show the Waking world before going to sleep is the same as
Waking world after the sleep. All this is part of the Illusion of the
Dreamer Jeeva. The Pot seen before is not the same Pot after waking.
Therefore he makes a very bold statement -

एवं जाग्रदवस्थायां प्रपञ्चम् अनुभूय सुषुप्तिं गत्वा पुनरुत्थाय योऽयं
प्रपञ्चानुभवः स प्रपञ्चान्तरमेव विषयीकरोति प्रत्यभिज्ञानं तु अविवेकादेव ।
When ten people see a Illusory Snake instead of a rope lying in front of
them they all say 'we saw the same snake'. But it is because of Aviveka
they are saying that because the Avidyaa Vrutti of one person cannot be
known by another person. Every person's snake is appearing in his Avidyaa
Vrutti. They are all seeing different snakes but they think they are seeing
the same snake. The Pratyabhijnaa of seeing the same snake is Error.
Similarly a person experiences a Waking State World and goes to sleep. Then
he gets up and he sees another Waking state World. The Pratyabhijnaa of
seeing the same Waking state World is because of Error.
