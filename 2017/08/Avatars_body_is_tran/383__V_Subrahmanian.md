Thanks for posting that portion where the widows of Krishna took to various
means.  Do you have information about this, from the original post:

//Vasudeva, though he was the Supreme Deity, wished to die, for dispelling
all doubts and establishing a certainty of results (in the matter of human
existence), simply for upholding the three worlds and for making the words
of Atri’s son true. Having restrained all his senses, speech, and mind,
Krishna laid himself down in high Yoga.//


What had Atri's son prophesied?

regards
vs
