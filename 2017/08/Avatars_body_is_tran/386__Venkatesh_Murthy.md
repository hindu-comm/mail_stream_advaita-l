Namaste
There is perfect Hari Hara Leela in this episode. Krishna did not want to
put the Paayasocchishta on His soles because it does not show respect to
put a Brahmin guest's left over food under the feet. Rukmini also because
She is perfect Pativrata did everything according to Durvasa's wishes.

I am seeing connection of this with Made Snana in Kukke Subrahmanya Temple.
Devotees roll over plantain leaves with the remains of food taken by
Brahmins. Details here -

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Made_Made_Snana

The foolish and corrupt Government has banned it but it is ancient ritual.

In the Bhrigu Muni episode also Vishnu showed respect to Brahmin guest even
though he kicked Vishnu in the chest. A Brahmin guest is treated like God.
Everything the Brahmin guest asks is like a command from God. That is why
Sruti has said Atithi Devo Bhava. Krishna and Rukmini showed by example
this same Sruti statement.
