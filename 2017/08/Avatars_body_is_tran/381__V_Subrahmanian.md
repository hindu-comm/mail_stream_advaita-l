Here the translation should have been:  ...Rudra-s and Aditya-s....[ rudrAdityA
vasavashchAtha vishve ] [Rudrāścha ādityāścha rudrādityāḥ]

Is there any reference to this in the Mahabharata:

http://www.mythfolklore.net/india/encyclopedia/krishna.htm

//Arjuna <http://www.mythfolklore.net/india/encyclopedia/arjuna.htm> proceeded
to Dwaraka <http://www.mythfolklore.net/india/encyclopedia/dwaraka.htm> and
performed the obsequies of Krishna . A few days afterwards the city was
swallowed up by the sea. Five of Krishna 's widows were subsequently burnt
upon a funeral pile in the plain of Kuru
<http://www.mythfolklore.net/india/encyclopedia/kuru.htm>-kshetra.//
