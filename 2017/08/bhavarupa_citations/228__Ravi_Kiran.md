Yes, since ajnAna is not removed after deep sleep ( sat sampatti )
experience (lion wakes up as lion etc), it is accepted that ajnana is
present in sushupti  .. is this causal ajnana ( beeja or avidyA shakti)
differentiated from the waking/dream ajnana, in any way ?

If so, how and where, they differ?

Through samyak (Turiya) jnAna arising in waking through sruti shravana, is
it considered, all variants (if considered so) of ajnana ( beeja or the
ajnana in waking/dream) are sublated/destroyed completely and not needing
any other practice to destroy the causal ajnana separately?

Thanks
