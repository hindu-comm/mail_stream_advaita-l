To: V Subrahmanian <v.subrahmanian at gmail.com>


Dear Subbu-ji,

Last week in Mumbai, I met Swami Shuddhabodhananda Saraswati. He gave me a
copy of his latest book as well as digital copy of a review in Bhavan's
Journal which I am attaching herewith.

The book is available in Bengaluru at the Vedanta Book House.

Please share this with other mumukshus.

Best regards.
Mangesh
