S. Maheswaran
There are some lectures of Sri Dr. K. S. Maheswaran on YouTube and very nice ones. Following two are introduction to naiShkarymasiddhi. As Sri Subrahmanian Sir pointed out, lectures have a lot of samskritam words (probably more than thamizh words). It is useful that way, as in the end one would need samskritam to understand the material in depth. Enjoy!

Advaita in the Srimadbhāgavatam - A sample

Here is a very revealing talk in Tamil, with full of quotes and terms in
Sanskrit, by Vidwan Dr. K.S.Maheswaran Nambuthiri of Chennai, bringing out
the Advaitic tātparyam of the Bhāgavatam.

http://www.mediafire.com/file/gobpfnvbs3kplup/02-Advaitam-Bhagavatham-08.04.15_%281%29.mp3

Anyone familiar with Sanskrit can easily benefit from the talk. The
Bhāgavatam shows, among other things, that the there is a higher message
conveyed by the various stories and that the stories themselves are not the
ultimate truth. They are merely vehicles that carry a different truth.
Shankara has said this alone in his bhāṣya-s.

subbu
