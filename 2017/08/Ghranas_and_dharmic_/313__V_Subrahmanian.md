In my opinion these are adhered to on the basis 'kartavyameveti' - we have
been asked to perform japa, etc. during those times. And that is sufficient
instruction to perform them. The performance produces adrishta, an unseen
effect, on the performer. This will lead to favorable results to him in
gaining chittashuddhi, progress in sadhana, etc. Non-performance will not
lead to these effects.
