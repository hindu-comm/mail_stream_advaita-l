The two are regularly rendered during the Bhajans on the Independence day
eve, by Sri Swaminathan and party in Chennai. This group has been meeting
on every second Sunday at a house on Burkit Road, T.Nagar, Chennai, for the
last nearly 30 years without break. The two hour bhajan is a well attended
one. Sri Swaminathan who leads the bhajan is a very talented singer.
