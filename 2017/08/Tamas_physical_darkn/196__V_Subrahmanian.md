Here is a verse from the Panchadashi which says that 'when we close our
eyes, the internal darkness is perceived':

In the second chapter titled 'pancha mahā bhūta viveka', Swami Vidyaranya
is explaining the source of the sense/motor organs, their objects, etc.
After saying that the organs are largely turned outwards, he says that the
objects of perception present inside the body too can sometimes be
perceived:

कदाचित्पिहिते कर्ण्णेश्रूयते शब्द आन्तरः। प्राणवायौ जा-ठराग्नौ
जलपानेऽन्नभक्षणे।  8
व्यज्यन्तेह्यान्तराः स्पर्शा मीलने चान्तरं तमः। उद्गारे रसगन्धौ
चेत्यक्षाणामा-न्तरग्रहः। 9

8. But sometimes we hear the sounds made by our in-going and out-going
breaths, and we hear buzzing sound when our ears are stopped. We feel an
internal sensation of hot and cold when food and water are swallowed.

9. *When our eyes are closed, we see inside the inner darkness*, and in
belching we experience taste and odour. Thus the sense organs give rise to
experience of things within the physical body.
