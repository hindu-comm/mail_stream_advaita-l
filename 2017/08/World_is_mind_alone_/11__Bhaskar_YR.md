praNAms Sri Sada prabhuji
Hare Krishna

The sloka appears to refer to the macro cosmic person. Then there is a jump to the microcosic individual jeeva and his mind in the explanation.

>  Yes, it is a huge and long  jump from macro to micro to justify the avidyAkalpita jagat of conditioned jeeva :-)  No bhAshya support for this as bhAshyakAra himself elsewhere clarifies that in all vedAnta-s srushti is kevala Ishwara hetuka nothing else...why Ishwara does the srushti??  Ishwara does this work according to the karma-s of individual jeeva-s.  In the very beginning of sUtra bhAshya (think in second sUtra) bhAshyakAra further clarifies : the origination etc. of the universe with these vaividhyata cannot be possibly conceived to be effected by any cause other than the Ishwara possessing these qualities.  It is clear here that the adviteeya brahman itself equated here with Ishwara who is sarvajna and sarvashakta.  

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
