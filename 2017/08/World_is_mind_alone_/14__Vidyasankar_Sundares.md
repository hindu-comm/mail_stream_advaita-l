Indeed sir. My response was not to your questions. I addressed only the
external condition that you imposed upon any attempt to answer your
questions.

If you could show how one could stay within your condition of using "facts
experienced by all" and still talk about whether there is only one mind or
any, that will be highly appreciated.

Namaskarams,
Vidyasankar

Dear Sri Vidyasankar,
    I thank you for your kind response to my posting. I have a feeling that
the reply has no bearing upon the questions at all.

With respectful namaskars,
Sreenivasa Murthy.

Dear Friends,   Clarification for the following questions is requested
:     (1) Does the mind exist prior to the appearance of the world?     (2)
If the world is mind only , then why there is distinction and difference
between mind
          and matter which is perceptible?     (3) Do the mind and the
world appear simulteneously?    ( 4) If the world is mind only then this
doctrine comes under the category of IDEALISM,
          is it not so?  I have a request :the replies should be facts
which can be verified by all. PLEASE,NO QUOTATIONS FROM OLD TEXTS LIKE
YOGAVASISHTA etc.



The requirement of "verification of facts by all" presupposes the mind,
does it not? Not only one mind, it presupposes the presence and independent
operation of multiple minds, does it not?

How can your questions be answered impartially then?

Best regards,
Vidyasankar
