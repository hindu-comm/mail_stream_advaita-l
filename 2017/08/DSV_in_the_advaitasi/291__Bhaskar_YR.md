The nivritti of dream when one wakes up is traikAlika bAdha, but the nivritti of the waking world in the dream is laya, and not a bAdha. That happens with brahma pramA, when not just the svarUpa nivritti happens, kAraNa avasthiti nivritti also happens. This is the distinction between vyAvahArika vastu and prAtibhAsika vastu. The bAdha of a prAtibhAsika vastu (traikAlika niShedha) happens even before the rise of brahma pramA, whereas the bAdha of a vyAvahArika vastu happens only upon the rise of brahma pramA.

Thanks for this explanation.  bAdha, laya and nAsha though have been used interchangeably in bhAshya contextually we have to understand these terms.  bAdhA cannot bring any abhAva to the vyavahAra hence shankara observes AtmAnAtma vivekinAmapi punditAnAM ajAvipAlAnAM api aavivaktaU shabdapratyayaU bhavataH in samanvayAdhikaraNa bhAshya...Hence samyak jnana or paramArtha drushti is not vyavahAra abhAva jnana it is vyavahAra satyatva buddhi bAdhita jnana. 

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
