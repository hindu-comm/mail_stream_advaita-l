One way of defining vyAvahArika sattA is brahmapramA atirikta abAdhyatve
sati sattvena pratItyarham chidbhinnam - that which appears as existing, is
different from pure consciousness, and is non sublated by anything other
than the real knowledge of brahman. This is if you will recall, the
pakshatA avacChedaka dharma in the beginning of advaita siddhi. The
question is whether such a sattA exists in the world or not within DSV.
Looked at this way, one has to say that it does exist. However if
vyAvahArikatvam is defined as ajnAtasattA, then it does not.

Agreed.
