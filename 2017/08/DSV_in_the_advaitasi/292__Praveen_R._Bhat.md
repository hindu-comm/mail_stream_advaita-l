There was more than once such interpretation was seen on this list
recently where the dRShTi of jIva is denied as sRShTi but that of Ishvara
is accepted. IMO, there is no issue for the DSV follower, be it of EJV/
NJV variant, since he lands a conclusion by posing a simple question: why
is that Ishvara sees a world, which is called as a creation, and I/ all see
the same thing? Again, he answers with अर्थापत्तिः so: if the waker Ishvara
sees the world like a dream (विश्वं पश्यति कार्यकारणतया स्वस्वामिसंबन्धतः)
and the dreamer me sees the same thing (स्वप्ने जाग्रति वा य एष पुरुषो
मायापरिभ्रामितः), it is *only* because the waker Ishvara and the dreamer me
are the very same entity, अन्यथा अनुपपत्तेः।

In any case, it is indeed इष्टापत्तिः for the DSV follower.
