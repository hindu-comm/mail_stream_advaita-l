It seems that this could as well apply to prAtibhAsika-sattA, what is the
definition given of prAtibhAsika-sattA​ to differentiate it? If it be said
that vyAvahArika sublates it, then so does prAtibhAsika sublate
vyAvahArika. The dream world and waking world, both, sublate each other in
their own sattAs. This is how Karikakara collapses both as a single sattA.
