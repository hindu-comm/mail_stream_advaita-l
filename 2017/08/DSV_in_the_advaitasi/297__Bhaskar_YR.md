Essentially, we wake up to a different world than the one that existed before going to sleep.

praNAms Sri Anand Hudli prabhuji
Hare Krishna

This is very interesting.  Every morning we are waking up in the different world which is different from previous day world!!  How about the experiencer jeeva ?? whether this jeeva too different from previous day jeeva or same jeeva ??  shankara talks somewhere about akruta abhyAgama and krutapraNAsha dOsha-s with regard to this.  Any explanation / samanvaya with regard to this in this work prabhuji??  Shankara explains why and how 'same' jeeva awakes from sushupti with same avidyA even though there is mergence / ekatva in sushupti.  And what is the purpose of different world with similarity every day when kalpita world is not in the control of waking jeeva and Ishwara is the svapna katru ??  Sorry, even though I am trying to read all these just to understand this prakriya in its own domain I am getting these doubts based on mUla bhAshya.  

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!!
