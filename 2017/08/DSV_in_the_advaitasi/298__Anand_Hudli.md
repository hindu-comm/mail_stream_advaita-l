praNAms Sri Anand Hudli prabhuji
Hare Krishna

This is very interesting.  Every morning we are waking up in the different
world which is different from previous day world!!  How about the
experiencer jeeva ?? whether this jeeva too different from previous day
jeeva or same jeeva ??  shankara talks somewhere about akruta abhyAgama and
krutapraNAsha dOsha-s with regard to this.  Any explanation / samanvaya
with regard to this in this work prabhuji??  Shankara explains why and how
'same' jeeva awakes from sushupti with same avidyA even though there is
mergence / ekatva in sushupti.  And what is the purpose of different world
with similarity every day when kalpita world is not in the control of
waking jeeva and Ishwara is the svapna katru ??  Sorry, even though I am
trying to read all these just to understand this prakriya in its own domain
I am getting these doubts based on mUla bhAshya.

The jIva remains the same, as one of the six permanent and anAdi entities
mentioned earlier. The DSV is a logically unassailable prakriyA, despite
sounding counter-intuitive at several places.
