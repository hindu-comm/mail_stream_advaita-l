Although in SDV, the इदंता/ इदमंशः which belongs to the shell is known
while the shell itself is not known as it is, and on this इदमंशः, there is
अध्यासः of the non-existent

silver, I am thinking that it could be said in DSV that this इदमंशः of
the shell also need not belong to the shell, it can be said to be अस्तिता
of brahman itself. So there would never be an absence of अधिष्ठानम् for
अध्यासः। Further,

I think this can also be seen as answered by Bhagavan Bhashyakara in
adhyAsa bhAshya by saying: न च अयमस्ति नियमः पुरोवस्थित एव विषये
विषयान्तरमध्यसितव्यमिति। अप्रत्यक्षेऽपि आकाशे बालास्तलमलिताद्यध्यस्यन्ति।
एवम् अविरुद्धः प्रत्यगात्मनि अपि अनात्माध्यासः। Taking this as basis also,
it may be said that ignorance of an uncognised object, which although
non-existent in DSV, can also be possible as mentioned by MS later.
