I got stuck in point 2 above, as in case of bhrama (shukti rajata), it can
be told - shukti ajnAna is kAraNa for rajata bhrama

In case of shukti perception ( prAtibhAsika satya and not a bhrama), shukti
jnAna alone could be its upAdAna kAraNa

This above point 6, clarified my doubt.. agree with the rest of your line
of thought.
