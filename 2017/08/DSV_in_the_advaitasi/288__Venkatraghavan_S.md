Namaste Praveen ji,
No worries. Hope you feel better.

I spoke with Sri Mani Dravid Sastrigal yesterday - it was quite subtle, so
it did take some time for me to understand the import of what he was
saying.

I will cover his response here, and if you still feel there are outstanding
points you'd like to discuss from your previous email, I'd be glad to to do
that.

The question posted to him was: because of the way the terms vyAvahArika
sattA and bAdha were defined in advaita, is there not a risk that DSV ends
up having sattA traividhyam? Reasons outlined in various emails in this
thread.

His response:
>From a definitional point of view what you say is correct. However, we must
consider the following:
1) The definition of pratibhAsika sattA in DSV is not from the point of
what causes an object's bAdha (brahma prama atirikta bAdhyatvam), but
simply pratibhAsakAlamAtra sattAkatvam - that which exists only when it is
seen. This definition is applicable to all objects within the DSV universe
(except the six anAdi vastus), including objects such as pot, shell, etc.
2) Within the definition of prAtibhAsikatvam in DSV itself, there is scope
for a prAtibhAsikatva and vyAvahArikatva. Meaning, that while all objects
are prAtibhAsikatva, people may not know that and still think that there is
a vyAvahArikatva and prAtibhAsikatva. Thus, DSV is not saying that objects
appear as being prAtibhAsikam, they simply are.
3) The implication is that DSV is not being said from the point of view of
a draShTA, but is taught to a student for vichAra. To explain, DSV does not
require that the draShTA knows that the objects are prAtibhAsika, it only
teaches that they *are prAtibhAsika* . Now, the seer who is not aware of
this, or not willing to accept this, may still conclude that some objects
are vyAvahArika, and some objects are prAtibhAsika.
4) For example, let us consider a seer who is currently seeing shell silver
instead of shell. That person, may very well know that it is possible to
mistake shell-silver for shell and that such objects are prAtibhAsika. But
in this particular instance, he genuinely believes that what he is seeing
now is silver, not shell silver. So he treats this as vyAvahArika and the
latter as prAtibhAsika. However, in reality both are prAtibhAsikam.
5) Therefore our original question - isn't there a category called
vyAvahArikatvam that is based on brahma pramA atirikta abAdhyatvam, and
such an abAdhyatvam is present in DSV because ajnAna nivritti is absent, is
similar to the person in 4 - he knows there is a prAtibhAsikam, but he
believes that what he is seeing is vyAvahArikam. In reality, such a
vyAvahArikatvam does not exist in DSV, but vyAvahArika vyavahAra can.
6) Sri SAstrigal went on to explain where he got the idea to answer the
question in this manner, and the reason why he had asked me to call him the
next day. Apparently he wanted to refer to Sri Gauda BrahmAnanda's
commentary to the SiddhAnta Bindu by MadhusUdana Sarasvati where a similar
idea is explored. In that work, Sri BrahmAnanda says - according to
shUnyavAda everything is shUnyam, but the implication of this is not that
everything *appears as shUnyam*. A pot still appears as a pot, the
intention is to say that its reality is shUnyam. Sastrigal used the same
rationale to answer this question.

I'm not sure if others will like this answer, but I must say that it is a
very satisfying explanation, even if it takes a bit of effort (at least for
me it did) to understand both the question and the answer.

Regards,
Venkatraghavan
