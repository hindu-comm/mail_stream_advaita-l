Namaste Venkatraghavanji,

(Apologies for the delay; some health issues are taking time away. :)
Although my chain of thoughts was incomplete on this issue, I'm sending it
since I typed most of it the same day, before Anandji and you replied. Now,
I don't have much to add/ ask. Kindly ignore it if the content seems
incomplete or out of place. I'll also await your mail about clarification
from Mani Dravid Shastriji. Thanks).

Thanks for your detailed response. I think there was some communication gap
and I was/ am confused. :) Still, I shall try to be brief.

I think I am lost on this analysis since I don't know of (b) in the example
being discussed about even in SDV. And even if it is, my thinking is that
it doesn't quite belong in DSV, where there is no difference between
shuktikA and rajata both in their being prAtibhAsika. I thought your
statement earlier so: "even a bhrama can be a bAdhaka jnAna for another
bhrama (e.g rope-stick bhrama can do a bAdha of rope-snake bhrama)" should
apply in all cases of DSV. What works for rajata should work for shuktikA
too.

Because there is no ajnAta sattA in DSV, when there is shukti ajnAna, the

Somehow I seem to have missed that the discussion landed on this analysis!
Does Siddhikara analyse this lack of existence at all in the context of
DSV?

How would you explain the dream world negated by the waking world and
viceversa. I recall you said waking has bAdha/nivRtti by dream but not so
the other way around. I don't see why, since there seems to be vaiShamya in
comparing dream world with waking world kAlatraya, but not the waking world
with dream world kAlatraya! In any case, technically also, would it really
be a flaw in DSV if its not bAdha/ nivRtti? Is it like saying its more of
laya, then "nAsha"?
