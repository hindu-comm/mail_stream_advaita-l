Venkatraghavanji, ​I am not sure as to what sthUla and ​sUkShma means here
in terms of shuktikA-rajat example in the context of DSV. If you don't
mind, could you specifically point out in the example which is which and
therefore the last set of likely impossibilities you point out w.r.t. bAdha
of ajnAna? To me it appears as शुक्तिकायाः अज्ञानस्य स्वकार्येण रजतेन
प्रविलीनेन वर्तमानेन वा सह ज्ञानेन निवृत्तिः बाधः।

And could you also quote the exact statement of the opponent before MS's
refutation line given? [Page no. of the PDF will be helpful, since I'd like
to read around it for my own benefit. Meanwhile, I'll also look around if I
hit this sentence after sending this mail :)]

​Thanks​
