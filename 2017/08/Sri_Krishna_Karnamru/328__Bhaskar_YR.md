This is very nice combination of Bhakti with Jnana. Excellent. There is a scene in Mahabharata when Krishna goes to Hastinapura to give a chance to Duryodhana for peace. There to show Duryodhana the true knowledge Krishna becomes every single person in the assembly. Duryodhana is seeing Krishna only everywhere. This is showing Brahman has become all and Jeeva also.
That single Jeeva is seeing this world and wrongly thinking there are different persons.

Hare Krishna

This reminds me puraNdara dAsa Kannada devara nAma, alli nodalu rAma illi nodalu rAma, ellelli nodidaru alli sri rAmachandra.  When rAma becomes all, for asura gaNa-s fellow asura/s become rAma and they started fighting each other and finally killed themselves.  Whereas  vAnara sena by seeing rAma everywhere embracing each other and dancing in ecstasy.  Deva Sri rAmachandra jagavella tAnAda is the vedAnta upadesha i.e. sarvaM khalvidaM brahma, brahmaivedaM vishvaM.  

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
