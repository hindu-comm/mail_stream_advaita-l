     Dear Sri Subramanian,You write : " To someone who is aware of these bhāṣya instances, Sri SSS's
conclusion -* the world, as Brahman, is satya alone* - is squarely not
agreeable." Mundaka Sruti says : brahmaivEdaM viSvaM variShTham ||Chandogya Sruti says : ahamEvEdagM sarvam|| , AtmaivEdaGm sarvam || and AtmatOidagM sarvam ||Do you with these statements? In what way HH Swamiji's statement is different from the Sruti mantras?Kindly enlighten me.

With respectful namaskars,Sreenivasa Murthy
