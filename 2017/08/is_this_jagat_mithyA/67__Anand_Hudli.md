At one point in the DSV discussion in the advaitasiddhi, BrahmAnanda in his
laghucandrikA says, adhikAribhedakalpitA hi prakriyAbhedAH
shAstrAcAryairanUditAH, the AchAryas of (our) shAstras have explained
various prakriyAs (methods of understanding) in accordance with the
differences among the eligible aspirants. Actually, the context is that
Madhusudana replies to an objection by the pUrvapakShin, who points out
that the entire pratikarmavyavasthA becomes untenable under DSV.
Madhusudana explains that the pratikarmavyavasthA is meant for
"mandAdhikArins", implying that dRShTi-sRShTi is for uttama-adhikArins.
