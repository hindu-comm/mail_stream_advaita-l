And this thread will not be completed if we don’t see the ‘difference’ between jeeva and Ishwara in srushti kArya / prakriya.  Though jeeva is brahmaiva na aparaH and there is only one Chaitanya one may conveniently say when we say jeeva srushti it is nothing but brahma srushti only.  If that is what their explanation then there is no need to exclude Ishwara and include jeeva in srushti prakriya and ask silly questions like : why Ishwara does the srushti, what for he does the srushti when he himself is aaptakAma, nitya trupta etc. And it has to be noted that though jeeva is brahmaiva, in the vyavahAra jagat, jeeva is NOT equal to brahma, he is mere ‘shAreeri’ only .  bhAshyakAra in 2nd adhyAya adhikaraNa clearly makes the distinction between shAreeri jeeva and parameshwara and clearly says shAreeri or saMsAri jeeva is not the creator of jagat.  Because the socalled jeeva is katru and bhOktru and he is the sufferer here we cannot  put-forth the argument like jeeva is nothing but brahman hence jeeva has been defined as srushti karta.  NA…that is not the way bhAshyakAra explains the srushti prakriya.  In the creation process, bhAshyakAra explicitly excludes jeeva attributes the creation to ONLY Ishwara and insists attributing the srushti to brahma is VEDANTA MARYAADA.  Just see the bhAshyavAkya-s where bhAshyakAra pushing aside the jeeva from this srushti kArya.  Na cha giri nadee samudrAdishu nAnAvidheshu nAmarUpeshu ‘ANEESHVARASYA JEEVASYA’ vyAkaraNa sAmarthyaM asti.  And see the other bhAshya vAkya where bhAshyakAra denies the srushti kriya to even siddha purusha-s :  jagat utpaadi vyApAraM varjayitvA anyadaNimAdyAtmakaM IshvaryaM muktANAm bhavituM arhati..then who is capable of doing this ??  bhAshyakAra clarifies :  jagat vyApArastu nitya siddhasyaiveshwarasya…

And again, though jeeva is nothing but brahma brahma is not jeeva…in the svarUpa both diamond and char coal one and the same but no one wants to wear the char coal ring and use diamond for cooking the rice ☺ In short, jeeva is shAreeri  (shareera eva bhavati) whereas Ishwara is sarvAntaryaami  and sarvavyApi ( na tu shareere eva bhavati).  And elsewhere bhAshyakAra again makes the difference between shAreeri and parameshwara to avoid the confusion in jeeveshwara bheda in vyavahAra by saying :  visheshO hi bhavati shAreera parameshwarayOH, ekaH (jeeva) kartA, bhOktA dharmAdharma sAdhanaH sukhaduHkhAdimAmscha…ekaH tad vipareetaH (brahma / parameshwara) who is avidyA vinirmukta, nitya shuddha, Buddha, mukta, apahatapApmatvAdiguNaH…etasmAdanayOH visheshAdekasya bhOgaH na etarasya…So, twisting the jeeva bhrAnta srushti to jeeva is nothing but parameshwara srushti is not bhAshya sammata, shruti sammata not even vedAnta maryAda.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
