Good to see the above. Yet, why do some people give the impression that SSS
did not subscribe to the idea 'jagat is mithyā'? Your explanation of his
words in the earlier post only shows that even his short article is
vyākhyāna-sāpekṣa. That standalone article can give an impression that I
got.  Could you kindly help me with the link to read his Mandukya karika
bhashya translation online, if it is uploaded in the site of the
kāryālaya?

Thanks
