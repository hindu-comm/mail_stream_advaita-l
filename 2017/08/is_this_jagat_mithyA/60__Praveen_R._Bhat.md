Without really interpreting what SSS said, those people give the
impression of jagatsatyatva. This jagat satyatva is not sampradAya's
kevalAdvaita at all, but so-called "shuddhAdvaita", which is really
"shuddha dvaita"! :)

By the three sets of words adhyasya, satyAnRte mithunIkRtya and
lokavyavahAra, adhyAsa bhAshya talks of anAdi series of saMskAra of adhyAsa
and anubhava since all three words mean only adhyAsa! Read literally, it
would mean adhyasya, adhyasya, adhyAsa bhavati!! Without the vyAkhyAnakAras
there would be all sorts of misunderstandings that we see. Ratnaprabha
clarifies further, after saying that Bhagavan Bhashyakara shows that it is
anAdi, that real pramAjanya saMskAra is not needed, but only anubhavajanya
saMskAra! If the saMskAra is anubhavajanya and adhyAsa is due to
anubhavajanya saMskAra and so on, how does one prove that something is
really created outside?! Hence, Bhagavatpadacharya says "Atmani" "bahir
iva", "pashyati", "kAryakAraNatayA", etc.
