Whether it is DSV or SDV or any other xxV, there is The Seer who exists prior to DSV, SDV or any other xxV . Who is the Seer? According to mantras 3-8-11 and 3-7-23 the Seer is Atman / Brahman and never a jiva. Upanishad says realize/ cognize THE Seer .The mantras 2-1-3, 2-1-4 of Kathopanishad and mantra 2-4 of Kena Upanishad show how can cognize/realize Atman. When once this realization dawns there will be an end .

>  Yes, there should be some srushti before prefixing the drushti to srushti  without drushya there cannot be drushti.  If at all there is drushti without any drushya then that drushti is paramAtma drushti only which thought about becoming many.  The drushya (kshetra) is nothing but aparA prakruti of that brahman and jna (the knower, the jnAntru, the kshetrajna) is paramAtma only since it is parA prakruti of that same brahman hence abedha between kshetrajna and paramAtma is samyak darshana clarifies shankara in geeta bhAshya.  And strictly speaking in the both vAda-s, it is wrong to assume hierarchical  adhikAri-s since it pertains to jnana pradhAna brahma jignAsa.  Ofcourse, there is adhikArika bheda in upAsana and dhyAna mArga where sAdhaka cannot understand the nirguNa, niratishaya, nirvishesha brahman started doing archana, upAsana dhyAna to personified saguNa brahman But the talk about Ishwara hetukA srushti which is the essence of sarva vedAnta, abhinna nimittOpadAna kAraNatvaM of brahmaN and insisting about  vedAnta maryAda, brahman's jagat kAraNatva and at the same time doing samanvaya with brahma nirguNatva etc.  is not the subject matter of mere mandAdhikAri-s IMO. 

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
