Namaste

Another point is SSS has given Sastric explanation for Mithyatva of Waking
and Dream states on Page 14. But he has not talked about Sushupti. Sushupti
is the CLOSEST to Satya than Jaagrat and Svapna Avasthas. Even though there
is Avidyaa in Sushupti also it is in seed form. But in Svapna and Jaagrat
it is like a Tree. Therefore when SSS is saying Waking world is Satya and
Brahman on Page 15 it is not correct. It may be Brahman but the experience
of the Jaagrat Objects should be like Sushupti because that is the Closest.
In Sushupti there is NO Name and Form experience like in Jaagrat and Svapna
but only a Lesha of Brahmaananda.

As a matter of fact everybody is experiencing that Lesha Maatra of
Brahmaananda in Sushupti but they are coming back to Jaagrat because of the
Avidyaa. Otherwise Sushupti will become Moksha itself.

Therefore when Sruti is saying everything is Brahman it is NOT saying Name
and Form of Waking State is Brahman but Waking State Minus Name and Form =
Brahman. When the Snake Rope Illusion has ended the Snake must disappear.
If you are still seeing Snake how can you say Illusion has ended? SSS
cannot say the correct example is Mud becoming Pot and Pot is still there
when you see Mud. This is Parinaama Vaada and not accepted by Sankara
Bhashya. Only Vivarta Vaada is acceptable. In that Vivarta the Snake must
and should disappear.

I think the big confusion is Mud becoming Pot example but we should not
take that example. The correct example is Snake Rope or Silver Shell. Both
Snake and Silver will disappear with Jnaana.
