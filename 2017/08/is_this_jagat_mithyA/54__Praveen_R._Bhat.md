​If Swamiji meant that statement as bAdhasAmAnAdhikaraNyam (bAdhyAyAM/
bAdhena sAmAdhikaraNyam), then it is the same. If not, its different. And
since SSS followers themselves seem to have different interpretations,
there is scope for benefit of doubt. Interestingly, for those who say that
nothing other than bhashya is needed are themselves at odds as to what
Swamiji meant; quite an irony indeed!

Kind rgds,
