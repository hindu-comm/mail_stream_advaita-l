Madhusudana explains that the pratikarmavyavasthA is meant for "mandAdhikArins", implying that dRShTi-sRShTi is for uttama-adhikArins.

>  Kindly explain from which view point then jnAni's avidyA lesha, rAga dvesha and prArabdha karma  has been explained...Is it only for the mandAdhikAris   shankara said samyakjnAnaprAptAvapi avashyaMbhAvini pravruttiH vA~ngmanaH kAyANAM...Here there is a talk about karma prAbalya over jnana even in samyaKjnAni-s and resultant avidyAlesha till the death of physical body etc. If this karma theory is kalpita how come realized soul even after realization can use their remains of prArabdha and take birth again as per the suggestion from parameshwara in case of apAntararama-s taking birth as vyAsa etc. ??  And how come brahma vAdi could see the kAryakAraNa tAdAymya saMbandha when kArya as such mere kalpita by an individual jeeva??  And it would be appropriate here to note that even after paramArtha jnana there is continuation of  utpatti and praLaya, but jnAni realizes that prior to jnana this creation was happening from somebody else and after the dawn of jnana this creation and dissolution  is from Atman only.  prAk sadAtmavijnAnAt svAtmanOnyasmAt sataH prANAdernAmAntasya utpatti pralayau abhUtAm.  sadAtma vijnAne tu sati idaaneem svAtmata eva saMvruttau.  Is all these instructions are meant for only mandAdhikAri-s ??  It may be worth noting that sashareeratvaM and prArabdha karma, avidyAlesha etc. is not from the mandAdhikAri-s (ajnAnis') point of view, it is indeed the jnAni's fate even after samyaK jnana.  That was the argument put forth by some.  Or is this another prakriya bheda?? Not sure. 

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
