Dear Bhaskar ji,

Sri SSS is saying:  *dehAdigaLu mattu* dvandvagaLu emba asattige
iruvikeyilla.  Note the word 'dehAdigaLu mattu..' So, he is not restricting
the asattva to mere dvandvagaLu, on the other hand, he is also including
dehAdigaLu, body, etc. The etc. will extend to the whole drshya prapancha.
Further, in this bhāṣya itself Shankara says: तदसत्त्वे सर्वाभावप्रसङ्ग इति
चेत् , न ; सर्वत्र बुद्धिद्वयोपलब्धेः, सद्बुद्धिरसद्बुद्धिरिति । tadasattve
(if everything is negated as being kArya (which is non-different from
kAraNa, as kAraNa alone is taught as satya and vikAra, kArya as mithyA),
will there not be sarvAbhAva prasanga? The siddhAntin replies: No,
everywhere, in every experience, we have sadbuddhi and asadbuddhi. While
asadbuddhi keeps on changing (in pot is-experience, cloth is-experience),
the sadbuddhi ('is' does not change, but only cloth, pot etc. change.).
So, Shankara is clearly meaning the entire experienced world and not merely
the pairs of duality like cold-heat etc.

And Shankara concludes: तस्माद्देहादेः द्वन्द्वस्य च सकारणस्य असतो न विद्यते
 भाव इति । TasmAt dehAdeH dvandvasya cha sakAraNasya asataH na vidyate
bhAvaH iti (Therefore the bodies etc. and the pairs of opposites which have
causes and which are asat, have no existence. This is the purport of the
verse.  तथा सतश्च आत्मनः अभावः अविद्यमानता न विद्यते, सर्वत्र अव्यभिचारात्
इति अवोचाम ॥  And, Sat that is the Atman has no abhAva, non-existence, as
It is always present without getting negated, as we have said already.

Thus, Shankara is very clear that 'everything' including the bodies, etc.
and the pairs of opposites, are asat. That alone has Sri SSS stated, which
I annotated. So, it is not merely dvandva-s that Shankara is negating as
asat, but the bodies, etc. and the entire created world of names and forms.
Otherwise, there was no need for him to raise the purvapaksha of
'sarvAbhAvaprasanga.'  In fact the discussion in the Gita itself started
with Arjuna becoming disturbed on the prospect of Bhishma, etc. dying. So,
the loss of their bodies was highlighted by Krishna. That idea was
developed to cover pairs of opposites also and the grand culmination in the
2.16 negating the entire creation.

This is a fact and I had demonstrated that with his own words. Though he
correctly intended to say the world is mithyā, he did not properly
articulate it at the end. This is what I showed.

My intention of presenting Sri SSS's words while discussing with you is
with the aim of showing that sometimes he was not concurring with the views
that you hold.
