Says Sri SSS for the Bhāṣya vākya at the end of BGB 2.16:


heege kAraNavuLLa (vAgiruvadarinda) dehAdigaLu mattu dvandvagaLu emba asattige iruvikeyilla. ...neenū (O Arjuna) tattvadarshigaLa dRuShTiyannu AshrayisikonDu shokavannU mohavannU biTTu shItoShNagaLE muntAda  dvandvagaLannu 'idu kAryavAddarimda bisilukurureya neerinante asatte Agiddu husiyAgi tOruttide' endu manassinalli nishcayisikoNDu taDeduko endu abhiprAya.

Thus, the message to Arjuna from the BGB 2.16 is: O Arjuna, you too, following the vision of the Knowers, look upon the dualities such as the body and the changing objects which all have a cause, as 'since this is caused, it is non-existent like the water of the mirage and thus, is falsely appearing (as sat).'

Hence, for Shankara and Sri SSS, the 'sarvam khalvidam brahma' means: all this is only appearing falsely with Brahman as the substratum.

Those who know the Kannada understand what exactly  Sri SSS saying here based on shankara bhAshya.  He is obviously talking about the asatyatva of ‘dvandva-s’ like sheeta-ushNa, rAga-dvesha, sukha-duHkha, jaya-apajaya etc. born due to dehAdi adhyAsa.  geetAchArya talking about the arjuna’s vishAda and attachment towards his kith and kin and not arjuna’s kalpita kurukshetra field and there bheeshma drOnAdi warriors ☺ Yes, dvandvagaLa asattige iruvekeyillaa because dvandva is avidyAkalpita which is the cause of arjuna’s untimely ‘vishAda’.  Geetaachaarya, bhAshyakAra and Sri SSS saying get rid of these dvandva-s be a sthita prajna who has samadarshitva.  Duhkeshu anudvignamahAH, sukheshu vigataspruhaH, veetarAgabhayakrodhaH sthitadheeH muniH uchyate..And from this samadarshitva what he achieves??  vidyA vinaya sampanne braHmaNe gavi hastini shunischaivashvapAkesha samadarshitva established…This is what is called bheda buddhi nivrutti and NOT bhedAkAra nirvutti…or it is not  vyavahAra abhAva sthiti it is vyavahAra bAdhA sthiti.  We have crossed swords somany times on this very issue is it not?? Let us leave it aside ☺

And now, I don’t know why you are often unnecessarily  bringing Sri SSS name here  when you yourself have your own reservations with regard to Sri SSS’s interpretations.  When I quoted Sri SSS with regard to jagat mithyatva you openly criticized him for his jarred interpretation and see the contradiction between starting and ending of his article and concluded that he is deviating from the siddhAnta etc.  It is because of this reason only I always hesitate to mention Sri SSS name and avoid quoting Sri SSS directly from his works.  When I myself avoiding this exercise,  prabhuji-s your goodself,  who is no more a good friend of Sri SSS’s interpretations and observations,  can always do better without bringing Sri SSS name in these discussions…is it not??  Just think over it…!!

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
