I forgot to mention, as far as mantra bhAga (like purusha sookta, sri sUkta, paNchAmrutAbhisheka mantra-s, niraajana mantra-s, mantra pushpa etc.) is concerned I hardly look at these books, confusion comes only with regard to pooja  with different nAma-s while doing AvaraNa, pushpa, patra, peeta, dvArapalaka Pooja :-) Since name matters most as in aJamiLa case :-) 

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
