In Brihadaranyaka Upanishad 4.3.15 occurs this mantra:

स वा एष एतस्मिन्सम्प्रसादे रत्वा चरित्वा दृष्ट्वैव पुण्यं च पापं च । पुनः
प्रतिन्यायं प्रतियोन्याद्रवति स्वप्नायैव स यत्तत्र किञ्चित्पश्यत्य
नन्वागतस्तेन भवत्यसङ्गो ह्ययं पुरुष इत्येवमेवैतद्याज्ञवल्क्य सोऽहं भगवते
सहस्रं ददाम्यत ऊर्ध्वं विमोक्षायैव ब्रूहीति ॥ १५ ॥

In the Bhāṣya a question is raised:

How is it known that  in the dream one does not perform punya and pāpa
karma but only 'sees' the fruit of punya and pāpa? Just as one performs
actions of punya and pāpa in the waking, so too does he perform both in
dream too, as the 'darshana' is the same in both waking and in dream. For
this the mantra replies: This self, whatever he sees in the dream the fruit
of punya and papa, is untouched by the 'seen' phala. If he had been tainted
by what he has seen in dream, he would be so even after waking, but such is
not the case in the world. It is well known in the world that one is not
tainted by what one does in the dream. No one considers oneself to be a
pāpi due to something evil done in the dream. Nor do people, upon hearing
from the waker about his dream-evil karma, censure or avoid him. Therefore
he is untainted by the dream-actions. Further, he only appears to do
something but that does not amount to real action. The Shruti itself says:
'as though he was enjoying with a woman'. People too, after waking, recount
their dream experiences always with a 'iva', 'It appeared as though
elephants ran...' Therefore there is no kartrtva in dream.

 ननु स्वप्ने न करोति पुण्यपापे तयोः फलमेव पश्यतीति कथमवगम्यते ? यथा जागरिते
तथा करोत्येव स्वप्नेऽपि, तुल्यत्वाद्दर्शनस्य — इत्यत आह — सः आत्मा, यत्
किञ्चित् तत्र स्वप्ने पश्यति पुण्यपापफलम् , अनन्वागतः अननुबद्धः तेन दृष्टेन
भवति, नैव अनुबद्धो भवति ; यदि हि स्वप्ने कृतमेव तेन स्यात् , तेन अनुबध्येत
; स्वप्नादुत्थितोऽपि समन्वागतः स्यात् ; न च तत् लोके — स्वप्नकृतकर्मणा
अन्वागतत्वप्रसिद्धिः ; न हि स्वप्नकृतेन आगसा आगस्कारिणमात्मानं मन्यते
कश्चित् ; न च स्वप्नदृश आगः श्रुत्वा लोकः तं गर्हति परिहरति वा ; अतः
अनन्वागत एव तेन भवति ; तस्मात् स्वप्ने कुर्वन्निव उपलभ्यते, न तु क्रिया
अस्ति परमार्थतः ; ‘उतेव स्त्रीभिः सह मोदमानः’ (बृ. उ. ४ । ३ । १३)

इति
श्लोक उक्तः ; आख्यातारश्च स्वप्नस्य सह इव - शब्देन आचक्षते — हस्तिनोऽद्य
घटीकृताः धावन्तीव मया दृष्टा इति । अतो न तस्य कर्तृत्वमिति ।

Shankara also says there itself:   यो हि करोति पुण्यपापे, स ताभ्यामनुबध्यते
; न हि दर्शनमात्रेण तदनुबद्धः स्यात्    He who performs punya-pāpa, becomes
endowed with them. By mere darshana, witnessing, punya-pāpa phala, one does
not become endowed with them.

Hence the question of prāyaśchitta for sinful karma done in dream does not
arise. The yogashāstra prescribes sixteen pranayama-s if the sādhaka has
lost veerya in svapna. Even here it is an expiation for the samskāra that
lead to such an effect.
