Could you please quote as to where is this prescribed? If it is indeed
prescribed, it is not for what is committed in dream, but for the saMskAra
which manifested in the dream. In dream, there is no puNyapApa earned, but
only spent.

On a related note, this is also one way that rAsalIlA is explained, whereby
Gopis didn't accrues any pApa.

Kind rgds,
