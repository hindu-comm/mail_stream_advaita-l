Namaste,

I wish to submit the following.

Before we compare the relative merits of waking n dream state we should
first look into the way they r araising. the upadhi  is a three body
principle of sthoola,suksma n karana sariras,manifested by the self (the
atman-immanent principle)

When all the three bodies are active it is called as waking state where in
the sthoola collects world info n sends to sookshma for analysis n storage
n karana(ego)arrogates the experience to itself.this experience is
discontinuous but the senses n anthahkarana play a trick to make it appear
as if it is continuous.(same as when u watch a film on screen or tv)



In dream state the sthoola is cutoff from receiving thaught from
antahkarana(sookshma) n hence made ineffective.the pent up thaughts qued up
for expression in antahkarana before sleep express at random in dream n are
experienced thru thaught in the subtle space alone.as the knower n known r
present in thaught simultaneously the experience of knowing takes place.so
dream state pertains to info stored in memory.


Same way the waking state also pertains to info stored in sooksma
antahkarana.when a form is perceived by physical eyes n transferred as
image to physical brain,it is scanned n perceived by thaught emanating fm
chidabhasa(layer on antahkarana)thru impulse coming fm mind n is compared
in memory by intellect n concluded as so n so nama.the same is arrogated by
ego as known to it n announces as thaught which is experienced in subtle
space .(knower n known being simultaneously present in thaught).

As the process of knowing is common for both waking n dreaming n also
experience of action also is same,the waking n dream states r treated on
par without any difference.

This is the essence of vaithadhya prakarana of mandookya Upanishad.
