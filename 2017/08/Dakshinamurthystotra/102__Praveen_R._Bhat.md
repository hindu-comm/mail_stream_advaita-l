​I think your conclusion on above two counts was right. In any case,
although I was glad to see Subbraramaiyaji endorsing Dakshinamurti stotra
as DSV, my conclusion was arrived at earlier itself when the work was
taught. I had mentioned other reasons in that thread.

​This is another happy surprise for me, but since Swami Vidyaranya has also
voiced something similar about DSV, it should hopefully not be shocking to
Vivarana followers.

I was surprised by this and as a consequence went through Sri

​I have my own ways to interpret unless specifically said otherwise, which
most who have discussed with me know by now. If I see a rope-snake or
especially dream example used, I will be convinced of DSV. For what its
worth, there need not be a distinct bheda between prakriyAs in any major
Vedanta work. A part of it can be SDV and other DSV, the same thing being
meant for all types of adhikArins. Each picks one or the other learning
from it and move on for one's own sAkShatkAra; One should neutrally be able
to see both possibilities exist, since the commitment is in neither.

​I'll surely look up and do so, thanks. ​We have just begun chAtussutrI
study and its getting a little hectic and terse. I intend to steal time
before today's grahaNa japa if possible.

​Not at all. As I said, my conclusions preceded your mail about the book
comment.​
