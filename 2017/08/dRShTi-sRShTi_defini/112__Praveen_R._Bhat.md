However, this so-called flaw of not being able to control sRShTi by jIva in
DSV can be similarly, although not exactly same, shown applicable to
Ishvara in SDV, since there is no choice of creation. Its in keeping with
total karmas of all jIvas. So what jIva sees in DSV is based on such anAdi
purvasamskAra.
