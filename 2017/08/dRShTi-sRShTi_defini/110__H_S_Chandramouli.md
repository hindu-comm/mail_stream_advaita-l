I intend to address some of these topics as part of the discussion on DSV
as found in the advaitasiddhi.

It would also be useful if it could be confirmed whether this version of
DSV as found in advaitasiddhi is the same as the one advanced by Sri
Prakashananda or different. As per Sidhantaleshasamgraha of Sri Appayya
Dikshitar, there are two versions of DSV. And Sri Madhusudhana Saraswati
perhaps preceded  Sri Prakashananda.
