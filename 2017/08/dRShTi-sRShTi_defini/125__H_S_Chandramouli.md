In avasthAtrayavivEka, it is held that in sushupti of the jIva, the jAgrat
world, as known by the jIva, attains its unmanifest state (लय  laya) in
अविद्या (avidyA) located in sAkshi. The SAME jAgrat world attains its
manifest state from this अविद्या (avidyA) on waking. Hence in this
avasthAtrayavivEka the jAgrat world is not a fresh Creation each time the
jIva wakesup from sleep/sushupti. There are enough clues in pages 536/537
of AS to suggest that this is what Sri MS is referring to also. Hence I
feel Sri MS is not presenting either version of DSV namely DES or DSKS here
in AS, but is presenting avasthAtrayavivEka.
