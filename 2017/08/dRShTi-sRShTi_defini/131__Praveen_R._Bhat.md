​Namaste Venkatraghavanji,

Thanks for your additions. I was wondering when I saw an empty mail from
you earlier thinking it got sent by mistake and was looking forward to your
response then!

​This above, and the following ​that you mention seems to be a logical
conclusion if one subscribes to NJV DSV. Else there is no reason for an
overlap to be there between NJ's universes and Ishvaras. Not that it would
matter so much, since people who are not convinced of DSV will question EJV
and NJV alike with slightly different shade of questions. I deleted a
question as to what establishes nAnAtva in DSV, but I think that can also
be resolved, so I have no issues either way though I prefer EJV for already
stated reasons.

Kind rgds,
