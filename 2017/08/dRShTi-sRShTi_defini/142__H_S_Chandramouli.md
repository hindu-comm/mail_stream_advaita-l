> Introduction  pp 35-37   Quote << Each jIva would appear to be the
> creator of his world, through and out of his nescience abiding in him ; the
> world is sustained by his nescience, and is destroyed with its destruction.
> The true creator, sustainer, and destroyer would thus appear to be the jIva
> himself. If the world be considered to be created by a God, that could be
> no more than an illusion, on a par with the world-illusion itself. The
> Creator and His Creatorship would both be figments of the creature’s
> imagination. The jIva is enthroned on high and God apparently reduced to
> nothing. But such a conclusion can hardly be consistent with the true trend
> of advaita. It is true that for this system even Isvara is not ultimate ;
> endow Him as we may with the utmost knowledge and power, He still falls
> short of perfection, since the Perfect is beyond all attributes ; greatness
> is significant only in relation to smallness, while the Absolute is neither
> great nor small and is above relative predications. All this, however,  is
> very different from the position that Isvara is a figment of the jIva’s
> nescience. >>
