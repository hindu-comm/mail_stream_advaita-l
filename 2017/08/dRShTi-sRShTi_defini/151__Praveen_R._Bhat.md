five are mithyA can be part of DSV also; this is subject to correction by
Anandji if I am missing some technicality that makes it impossible. The
​hetu as I can see from his earlier post is that it can reduce to
kShaNikavijnAnavAda (KVV), but I don't think that is possible considering
that consciousness is never kShanika in any flavour of AV. IMO, if MS gave
a different reason, that should not necessarily mean that the other reasons
are not possible. As I remember, even in one long thread on DSV quite some
months back, Anandji too had confirmed that DSV need not be scared of
baseless AropaH of being KVV.

dRShTisamakAlInasRShTiH (DSKS creation happens in synchronisation with your
seeing it) and dRShTiH eva sRShTiH (DES, seeing itself is creation), both
have only two sattAs, not three. The reason I restate this is since from
your posts it appears as if you think that versions of DSV are those with
two sattAs or three, and that Swami Prakashanandaji (SP) belongs to former.
I don't think there can be three sattAs in DSV. That being said, in my
understanding, SP follows DES and which is what I also prefer for my
sAdhana.
