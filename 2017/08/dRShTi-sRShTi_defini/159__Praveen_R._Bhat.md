Sorry, they do not.  अज्ञात and सत्ताक are adjectives to वस्तुएँ which is
plural, talking of objects. That's Hindi. As for Sanskrit, यत् and तत् are
neuter relatives and co-relatives refering to karma (grammatical object) of
pashyati (sees), which is a worldly object. Else it had to be यः (masculine
of यत्) and there would be no सः (masculine of तत्) since it makes no sense
in anvaya.

Kindly tell me the shloka words if possible, I would like to check what
context you are referring to for these translations. I haven't found the
bhashya under 13.31 or even the entire 13th chapter. In any case, even if
you apply these very translations to the AS words under discussion, there
will be no anvaya of the sentence and will make absolutely no sense if yat
and tat are taken as you take them. Please try in English itself
substituting those words for Sanskrit words, and rearranging them however
you wish. The reason is there is no issue with translating individual
words, but what about the Sanskrit pronouns? You are not going to find
translations for those pronouns out of context.

the topic of discussion. Obviously, although the word vAda is not
mentioned, the justification is still of the DS of DSV, as the title
"
Drishtisrishtyupapattih" states. Moreover, you yourself said that the
versions of DSV being used by me are the ones found as 2 out of 10
definitions in AS by MS!

I don't know what you are saying here. Are you saying that DSV is only an
avasthAtrayaviveka as someone else said? I'd be very surprised. Else...

... I don't think I understand the dispute. In any case, I was only
answering the questions you directed to me. So I am fine with your decision
too, now that I have responded to your new interpretations.

Thanks
