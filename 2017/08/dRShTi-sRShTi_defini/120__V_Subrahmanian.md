This is in perfect tune with what Shankara says in the commentary to the
Br.Up.1.4.10 where occurs the mahāvākya: aham brahma asmi:

तस्मात् — यत्प्रविष्टं स्रष्टृ ब्रह्म, तद्ब्रह्म, वै - शब्दोऽवधारणार्थः,
इदं शरीरस्थं यद्गृह्यते, अग्रे प्राक्प्रतिबोधादपि, ब्रह्मैवासीत् , सर्वं च
इदम् ; किन्त्वप्रतिबोधात् ‘अब्रह्मास्मि असर्वं च’ इत्यात्मन्यध्यारोपात्
‘कर्ताहं क्रियावान्फलानां च भोक्ता सुखी दुःखी संसारी’ इति च अध्यारोपयति ;
परमार्थस्तु ब्रह्मैव तद्विलक्षणं सर्वं च । तत् कथञ्चिदाचार्येण दयालुना
प्रतिबोधितम् ‘नासि संसारी’ इति आत्मानमेवावेत्स्वाभाविकम् ;
अविद्याध्यारोपितविशेषवर्जितमिति एव - शब्दस्यार्थः ॥

Shankara has captured the heart of DSV, in all aspects stated in the
Prakāśānanda anuvāda above, in the above crisp couple of sentences:

Brahman, having created, has entered the body-mind complex. This Brahman
that is present in the body, was Brahman alone and everything in creation,
even before arriving at the realization that it is Brahman. But owing to
ignorance it thinks 'I am not-brahman, and 'not-all'. Because of these
wrong notions, the effects such as 'I am a doer, enjoyer of fruits of my
actions, happy, miserable, samsārin' also are experienced by it. However,
in truth, it is Brahman alone and also all that is other than Brahman (the
world) as well.  By some fortunate turn of things, a compassionate Acharya
teaches 'You are not samsārin', and it realizes its own native self that is
free of all superiimposition wrought by ignorance.

In another section of this very bhāṣya of the 1.4.10  Br.Up. itself
Shankara has stressed the need for propitiating the gods, pitrs, etc. who
will bless the nishkāma aspirant with all that is required for
ātma-sādhana. This is also echoed in the Prakāśātman anuvāda by the word
'pūjā'.     यं तु मुमोचयिषन्ति, तं श्रद्धादिभिर्योक्ष्यन्ति,
विपरीतमश्रद्धादिभिः । तस्मान्मुमुक्षुर्देवाराधनपरः श्रद्धाभक्तिपरः
प्रणेयोऽप्रमादी स्यात् विद्याप्राप्तिं प्रति विद्यां प्रतीति वा
काक्वैतत्प्रदर्शितं भवति देवाप्रियवाक्येन ॥

Thus we have incontrovertible evidence for the obvious presence of DSV as
the mukhya prakriyā of shānkara vedānta.
