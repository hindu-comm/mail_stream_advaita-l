Namaste Chandramouliji, Anandji,

(combining replies to reduce flooding the list)

Anandji, thanks for the elaboration on what dRshyatva meant earlier and
also on the avidyA shakti role in DSV (which I assume is in one flavour of
the same).

Chandramouliji,

Okay... however...

admitting three sattAs. I'm not sure how you landed that conclusion.

It has the capacity to include both, wherein it depends on how much of
avidyA do you use as a shakti. Following the line of argument used by
Anandji in his last reply to me, with avidyA as mAyAshakti as used by
Bhagavan Bhashyakara also, one could say it is DSKS. For DES, one doesn't
need additional tools. There is more lAghavam (Occam's razor) there.

Yes, just as dream in SDV. sattA just means a reality, whether satyasya
satya pAramArthika or apparent reality prAtibhAsika. However, you are
moving a little ahead of DSV, which is truly the goal. Its good thinking
that if dRShTi alone is sRShTi, then where is the sRShTi?! That lands one
into AV (ajAtavAda), which is the way Mandukya smoothly glides from DSV
into AV.

Well, in either version, there is an apparent world of objects, be it due
to seeing or seeing itself being such a world. So sattA still holds as a
tag for the world.
