Not only so, but they gained what is to be gained following that very
prakriyA. Those who sit throwing aside prakriyAs as impossibilities are
just waiting for jnAna to somehow occur. Its like waiting for the lion to
wake me up from the dream since I heard such an analogy. One needs to know
the dream in the dream, else its a catch 22.

I agree. This is precisely why I deleted/ dropped the question you

answered


anyway

. :) All of it is handled in the tradition already. No unanswered
"
flaws
"
can be found by us, since none exist. It finally boils down to what helps
one in संशयरहितज्ञान and निष्ठा thereon.

Therefore, as I stated in our last discussion, I do not insist on DSV/EJV
as the only one, since SDV has its own benefits for many;
my fault finding is mostly with people/ techniques that find faults and
talk of impossibilities of prakriyAs. I am mostly with samanvaya since
answers are given only to those who have questions, ergo, all prakriyAs
serve a purpose. If there is no doubt in a prakriyA after thoroughly
analysing, no one needs another prakriyA.
