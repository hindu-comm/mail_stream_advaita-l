>  But prabhuji,  you said that Ishwara does not forms a part of DSV (jeeva
kalpita or jeeva srushti) along with other five including shuddha Chaitanya.
There are variations of DSV. PrakAshAnanda holds that avidyA is responsible
for creation. Even in that case, Ishvara can be equated to shuddha
chaitanya, which is not jIva-kalpita. One of the six anAdis is jIva-Ishvara
bheda and it will still hold (until realization) if Ishvara is taken to be
nirguNa Brahman.


>   And finally one more important and final question with regard to DSV.
Whether the 'drushti' which is the hetu (kAraNa) for the srushti  in this
prakriya pertains to avidyA saMyukta jeeva / bhrAnta jeeva or
avidyAvinirmukta nitya shuddha Buddha mukta Ishwara??  Here jeeva denotes
parichinna Chaitanya with upAdhi or Ishwara with vishesha upAdhi ??  If
this whole DSV prakriya based on bhrAnta jeeva srushti.  Then I am afraid
this prakriya cannot be reconciled with shruti, yukti and anubhava.

It is not the case that a bhrAnta-jIva is responsible for sRShTi. shuddha
brahman in association with ajnAna gets jIva-hood and creates, again with
avidyA playing a crucial role. This is not a sequential process, in the
sense brahman becomes a jIva first and then creates the world. Both steps
are simultaneous, since Time itself is part of the creation. There have
been discussions before on Time as an Illusion.

There are different versions of DSV-eka-jIva-vAda as explained by appayya
dIkShita in his siddhAnta-lesha-saMgraha. However, the prominent among
them is the one put forth by PrakAshAnanda in his
vedAntasiddhAntamuktAvalI. According to this view, the
nityashuddhamuktasvabhAva Brahman, in association with ajnAna, attains the
state of jIva (ajnAnamAshritya jIvabhAvaM labdhvA), and creates (imagines)
the bodies of Gods, animals, humans, etc. and also creates the entire
universe with the fourteen worlds (brahmANDAdicaturdahsabhuvanaM sRShTvA).
Among those bodies, one is a God, one a human, one Hiranyagarbha the
Creator of all (teShu teShu deheShu kashcit devaH kashcit manuShyaH kashcit
hiraNyagarbhaH sarveShAM sraShTA). One is Vishnu the Protector and one is
Rudra the Destroyer of all during Pralaya (kashcit VishNuH pAlakaH kashcit
anyaH sarvasaMhArakartA rudraH pralaye)... I the son of a Brahmin, having
served the Gods with Bhakti consisting of pUjA, namaskAra, etc., and having
earned the sAdhanas such as shravaNa, manana, and nididhyAsana, will attain
liberation (ahaM punaH kashcit brAhmaNakumAraH teShAm bhaktiM
pUjAnamaskArAdinA anuShThAya shravaNAdi sAdhanaM sampAdya mokShaM
sAdhayiShyAmi iti). Thus, the jIva, although Ishvara (Brahman) himself
becomes deluded in the waking state (Ishvaro .api san bhrAnto bhavati
jAgare).
