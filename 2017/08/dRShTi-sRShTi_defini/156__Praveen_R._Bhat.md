Namaste Chandramouliji,

Thanks for the references. Could you also meanwhile link me to any Advaita
Siddhi online that you're referring to (say, for the ten definitions,
etc)? I do not have a hard or soft copy.

(Hindi)
 Without accepting the [presence of] unknown/unseen entity, accepting only
that which the self is seeing at whichever time, that is DSV
".
MS has mentioned the purport of DSV as: (Sanskrit) when one seen anything,
at the same time, [he] creates that".

As you can see from the above, the book's Hindi translation is generic
which can go with DES, but Sanskrit says DSKS! Unless thats the only
flavour that MS talks of, I would say that he accepts both possibilities.

I would very much like a translation of the same (commentary on verse 67)

My knowledge of two DSV flavours is as taught by my Acharyaji here during
Mandukya bhAShya. I would love to have a look at other definitions of DSV
from Advaitasiddhi some time.

Kind rgds,
