Namaste all,

That vivartavAda is also not the ultimate siddhAnta is mentioned in the
vedAnta siddhAnta muktAvali too.

"बालान् प्रति विवर्तोsयं ब्रह्मणः सकलं जगत् ।
अविवर्तितमानन्दमास्थिताः कृतिनः सदा ॥ " इति स्मृतिरपि आत्मनो
द्वैतदर्शनाभावमनुमन्यते ।
That this world is a vivarta, an appearance of Brahman, is said for the
sake of children. The wise on the other hand, are ever established in
bliss, in which there is no vivarta whatsoever - thus the smritis too agree
that there is no second thing seen in the Atma.

Does anyone know which smriti is being quoted here?

Regards,
Venkatraghavan

This is simply marvelous. Even vivarta is negated as adhyaropita at the
apavada stage. There is a verse in the Yogavasishtha that says: even one
jiva (of the Eka jiva) is not there really.
