Not at all, I just repeated the question since it was one question to you
in a long mail to Chandramouliji, so it was likely missed. Thanks for your
response.

Although, I too interpreted दृष्टिव्व्यक्ति as कर्मधारय translating to
"individual sights", but I wondered if it could be made द्वन्द्व by someone
to somehow accommodate Bhamatikara's NJV (although to do so strictly it
should have been व्यक्तिदृष्टि)।

I had particularly not seen the context in which the AS discussion takes
place and made सङ्गति connections, sorry! But I did see that EJV follows
this section.

Thanks, I'd said this very thing to my Acharyaji in one discussion on
Bhamatikara's DSV version that I don't need NJV at all since EJV is
लाघवम्। He seemed to agree. Yet, I don't think I landed this wonderful
thing of अविद्याश्रय with EJV the way you do below.

NJV. I was wondering as to how that conclusion was arrived at. Now it
perfectly syncs in. Thanks much; this is very helpful.
