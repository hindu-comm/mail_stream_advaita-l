Sorry, I left out the other verb when I said "यत् and तत् are neuter
relatives and co-relatives refering to karma (grammatical object) of
pashyati (sees)"; the sentence should be completed as "यत् and तत् are
neuter relatives and co-relatives refering to karma (grammatical object) of
pashyati (sees) *and of sRjati (creates/ manifests), respectively".

Kind rgds,
