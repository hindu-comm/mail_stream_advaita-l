Anandji, ​Why can't dRshyatva as a hetu be within DSV here?​

Also earlier, my post came out as a statement, but I meant to ask a
question, sorry. Couldn't the pointed flaw be turned around on the
purvapakShin who points out that jIva can't be a sRShTikartA, because he
has no choice of creation, since Ishvara also creates as per the jIvakarma,
not as per His whims? If its a doSha, its equal in DSV and SDV.
saMskArajanitA dRShTi eva sRShTirbhavati iti. Thanks.

​Chandramouliji, although I agree that other types of DSV as
samakAlInasRShTi and NJV may be possible, I subscribe to dRShTi eva sRShTi
with EJV. Just like SDV can have several varieties of creation "stories"
and supporting viveka prakriyAs, so can DSV, as long as they do not
contradict the siddhAnta.
