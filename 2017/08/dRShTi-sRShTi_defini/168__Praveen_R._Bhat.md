Namaste all,

(Advance apologies to the moderators and others)

Hopefully people noticed a sarcastic comment on other DSV followers who
perhaps haven't studied MS's wonderful work AS. That's rich coming from
whose own belief system allows study of Shankara Bhashya only! Laughable.
Still it is pleasing to read that at least MS is spared by such a person!
However, thats only a benefit-of-doubt perspective; more likely it is only
opportunism to attack others as always.

Kind rgds,
​
