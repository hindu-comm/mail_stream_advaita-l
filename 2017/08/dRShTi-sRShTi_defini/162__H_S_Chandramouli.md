I just checked with my friend reg the translation of the statement by Sri
MS. He says that the use of neuter gender is permissible for the Self. One
mistake I have committed is in the use of the word "His" in that statement.
It should read as " Its ". For that mistake I own responsibility. I am not
sure if you agree with this stand. But I may not be able to discuss with
him.
