Namaste,
I believe one of the conclusions from vAcaspati mishrA's nAna avidyA paksha
is not only multiple jIvas, but multiple Ishvaras and multiple universes
too! The logic is that Ishvara in this matam is kalpita or imagined due to
jIva's avidyA. The universe is also a creation of that avidyA.

Therefore, the avidyA of each jIva is responsible for the projection of a
unique universe, and along with it an Ishvara that the jIva imagines is the
creator, sustainer and destroyer of that universe. Upon the rise of jnAna,
that individual jIva's avidyA is destroyed, along with that jIva's universe
and that jIva's imagined Ishvara.

Regards,
Venkatraghavan
