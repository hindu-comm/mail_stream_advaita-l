>Anandji, ​Why can't dRshyatva as a hetu be within DSV here?​

Perhaps my message was not clear, but I didn't mean to say dRshyatva cannot
be used as a hetu within DSV. It is purely because the six entities are
anAdi, they will not have any sRShTi. This being the case, it is not
possible to show their mithyAtva using the DSV argument's hetu of being
created only due to cognition and not existent otherwise. Another way of
looking at it would be that five of the six entities (other than
shuddhacit) are either avidyA or are defined in terms of avidyA and hence
cannot be real. This reasoning is common to both SDV and DSV.

>Also earlier, my post came out as a statement, but I meant to ask a
question, sorry. Couldn't the pointed flaw be turned around on the
purvapakShin who points out that jIva can't be a sRShTikartA, because he
has no choice of creation, since Ishvara also creates as per the jIvakarma,
not as per His whims? If its a doSha, its equal in DSV and SDV.
saMskArajanitA dRShTi eva sRShTirbhavati iti.

Actually, it is not that jIva has no choice of creation, but he has no
shakti or capability to undertake the creation task, and once creation
happens, he does not have full control over it. Madhusudana addresses this
issue in DSV, saying it is not just the jIva alone who creates this
creation but it is the avidyA shakti that makes the (big) difference. So in
a sense, it is possible to view avidyA as reigning over creation. However,
due to reasons mentioned earlier, an Ishvara is accepted as part of the
DSV. Now, it is debatable what exactly this Ishvara is responsible for in
DSV. One may note that certain shruti/smRti statements such as mAyAM tu
prakRtiM vidyAn mAyinaM tu maheshvaram and paritrANAya sAdhUnAM... etc
point to a Controller role for Ishvara or it could just be that Ishvara is
the shuddha caitanya, as accepted in the bhAmatI. In the first case, saguNa
upAsana of Ishvara is possible, while in the second case, one pursues
strictly the jnAnamarga with the objective of realizing Ishvara.
Traditionally, many of our AchAryas have been upAsakas at some point or the
other.

Anand
