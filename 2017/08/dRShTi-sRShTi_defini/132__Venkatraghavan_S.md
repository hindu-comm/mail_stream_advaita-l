Namaste Praveenji,
Yes, I had sent that email by mistake, apologies.

Coming to the question you deleted, it is worth considering why the BhAmati
is arguing from a nAna jIva perspective. It is because the basic tenet of
vAcaspati mishrA is that it is the jIva which is the Ashraya of avidyA.

If that jIva was one, the argument goes, the liberation of that one would
lead to the destruction the world. We don't encounter that, so the jIvAs
must be many. If jIvAs are many, is avidyA one or many?

If avidyA is one, under the jIvAshrita avidyA view, all the jIvas would
share the one avidyA. You will have the same problem, the liberation of any
one jIva would either destroy everyone's common avidyA, or failing which,
if that avidyA is not destroyed, could lead to a relapse from moksha for
the liberated jIva.

Thus there are infinite avidyAs and infinite jIvas in this view.

Regards,
Venkatraghavan
