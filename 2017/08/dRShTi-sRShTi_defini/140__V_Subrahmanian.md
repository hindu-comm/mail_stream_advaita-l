In the Siddhāntakalpavalli of Sri Sadāśivabrahmendra, the above is what
likened to a cloth and each jiva getting mukti is like one strand of the
cloth getting removed.

नन्वेतस्मिन्पक्षे कस्याविद्याकृतः प्रपञ्चः स्यात् ।
विनिगमकाभावादिह सर्वाविद्याकृतः स इत्येके ॥ १.४५

His own commentary: नन्वस्मिन्पक्षे कस्याविद्यया परप्ञ्चः
कृतोऽस्त्वित्याशङ्क्य विनिगमनाविरहात् सर्वाविद्याकृतः
अनेकतन्त्वारब्धपटवदिति केषांचिन्मतेन उत्तरमाह - नन्विति । एवं च एकतन्तुनाशे
महापटस्येव तत्साधारणजगतो नाशे शेषतन्तुभिः पटान्तरसेव जगदन्तरोत्पतिरिति भावः
।  ४५

The next verse is what I think exactly matches the case you describe above:

अन्ये तु सङ्गिरन्ते तत्तदविद्याविनिर्मितं विश्वम् ।
प्रतिपुरुषमेव भिन्नं भवति यथा शुक्तिरजतमिति ॥ १.४६

Here, the shukti-rajata example is exaplained: each person's perception of
the prātibhāsika rajata is the product of his own ajnāna. Similarly each
person's world vision is his own making of his own ajnana. 'The
pearl-silver that you have seen is the same that is seen by me as well' -
this thinking shared by two persons is bhrama alone.

This work is full of verses, with three chapters with the author's own
commentary. Late Vidwan Sri Sheshachala Sharma has translated this to
Kannada. I think there is an English translation too. This work seems to be
a versified version of the Siddhāntaleśasangraha of Sri Appayya Dikshitar.
