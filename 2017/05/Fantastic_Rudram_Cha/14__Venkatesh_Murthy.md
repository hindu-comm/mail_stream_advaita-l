Namaste

Thanking Ramakrishnan and Venkateswaran for the Yajur Veda links. I
downloaded the audios. It is like a big ocean of Mantras and it will
take a long time to listen to them.

I have one more question. I heard we must not even say or listen to
Apara Karma Mantras like cremation Mantras at home but they must be
done outside home only. If we listen at home something bad will
happen.

Kindly inform which Mantras in the Krishna Yajur Veda are Apara Karma
Mantras. I will avoid them when I am listening to the audios.

One more question kindly inform where to find Kooshmanda Homa Mantras
in the audios.
