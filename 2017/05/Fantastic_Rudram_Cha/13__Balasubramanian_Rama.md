Dear Sarmaji,

No one learns phonetic rules before adhyayanam and I wasn't suggesting
that. I don't know for sure, but if I had to make a bet, I would wager that
these 4 pundits have not picked up a single shikShaa or praatishaakhya text
in their lives as well. My only point was and remains that just because
people repeat something together does not mean they were properly trained.
That's all. Beware of youtube recordings or CDs. Any Tom, Dick or Harry can
pick up some recording equipment and put stuff out there.

Rama
