// I heard we must not even say or listen to Apara Karma Mantras //

पितृमेध पन्नम् is not chanted at home.  It should either be chanted in mutt or outside home.  
If you have a courtyard, you can chant there.

The efficacy would be more if chanted on Tuesdays & Saturdays as told by my teacher.

regs,
sriram
