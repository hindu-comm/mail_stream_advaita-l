praNAms Sri Rama prabhuji
Hare Krishna

I have the audio CDs of rudra, chamaka, aruNa, taiteereeya, mahAnArAyaNa, mahAnyAsa, pavamAna (Rigveda) etc. recited  by Challakere brothers (Sri Srinivasan & Sri Venugopal).  It's too good.  It is one of the purest renderings I have ever heard in my life.  Kindly let me know the more details of CDs that you are mentioning.  Would like to have it.  

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar

This is not bad, but I can detect some mAtra flaws and some other phonetic irregularities. Get the CDs from Vediclinks, chanted by 4 people, 2 ghanapATIs and 2 of their disciples. I consider this the Rolls-Royce of tatittiriiya chanting.
