P.Bala Subrahmanyam
-------------------

I am an Electronics Engineer retired from ISRO, Thiruvananthapuram. I had the 
good fortune of SRAVANA of Samkaracharya's Bhagavadgeeta Bhashya some 40 years 
ago while I was a student in Bengaluru, along with parts of the other two of 
the Prasthanatraya Bhashyas, where-ever they are referred to in &/or relevant 
to the Geeta Bhashya. Have been doing their MANANA along with Bhagavatpada 
Samkara's Prakarana Granthas since then and meanwhile trying to make a 
comparative study with Bhagavad Ramanuja's and Madhvacharya's Bhashyas on 
Prasthana Trayi. This is besides my study of Puranas, Itihasas and Parts of 
Veda Suktas. I consider it my good fortune to come across and be a member of 
this group. Read with interest the posts on (1) "Seven untenables of Bhagavad 
Ramanuja in Advaita" and the elegant and suave response to it by Sri 
Kuntimaddi Sadananda & (2)the scholarly, analytical and informative essay:"Was 
Achyuta Preká¹£a an Advaitin" With Pranams to the highly knowledgeable 
members of this Group,
