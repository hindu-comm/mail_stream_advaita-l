Respected learned members,

Did the Lord did/ didn't make sankalpa during his raamavatara?

Especially on the following occasions:
1. Proceeding to forest.
2. Chasing the golden deer.
3. helping out sugriva.
4. Terminating raavana.
5. Banishing sita maata.
6. Executing ashvamedha yaaga.
....

He clearly had a choice in many of these occasions!

Thanks in advance.
