Namaste,

My brother has recently been transferred to Times of India, Mumbai branch near Bandra.
Owing to this, his veda adhyayana got discontinued here in Hyderabad.

Need contacts of good vedic scholars who can teach Taittiriya Shakha and who 
can understand / speak telugu.  If they are staying in and around Bandra,
it would be much better as commuting time would be less (considering the bombay traffic).

regs,
sriram
