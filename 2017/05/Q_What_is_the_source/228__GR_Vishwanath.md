I have this half memory of a quote instructing the sAdhak not to be
surprised by anything
that happens in the world: do not be too surprised if you  should one day
see a man
climbing up a column of rain drops to the clouds above.

Does anyone know where this particular imagery/quote is from? And what word
best describes
this attitude?

Thanks for entertaining this vague question,
GRV
