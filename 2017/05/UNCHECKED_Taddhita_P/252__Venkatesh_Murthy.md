Namaste

Taddhita Pratyayas are very important part of Sanskrit. Example, from
Vishnu we get Vaishnava from Siva we get Saiva. Daasharathi word is
from Dasharatha. Desheeya is a word from Desha. From Samnyaasa we get
Samnyaasi and so on.

In this video Taddhita Pratyayas is made so simple like drinking a
glass of water.
