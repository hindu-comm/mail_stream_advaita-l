Sir, let us first appreciate the fact that someone has put in time and
effort to develop something very useful to others. Will any product be
perfect at first instance? So pl don't be so hard and judgemental. If
you're a developer, pl implement your own suggestions. We all lecture each
others on vEdAnta for hours, but when it comes to putting into practice, we
fail miserably.
