If moksha is the goal, one is better off working for it when one is hale and hearty rather than when one is at death's door. Once jnAna is attained, thoughts at the time of death do not matter.


Ø   Yes, the bhautika shareera tyAga and the thoughts at the time of leaving the cage would hardly a matter of concern for the jnAni who very well knows he is that that which is nainaM chindanti shastrANi, nainaM dahati pAvakaH etc. And he knows the truth that he is ajaH, nityaH, ever existing one and na hanyate hanyamAne shareere.

However if one wishes to prepare for that moment, one can observe one's thoughts just before falling asleep / or when falls sick to get an idea of the dominant thought patterns in the subconscious. It is a useful indicator but by no means definitive.


Ø   Yes, it is not a definitive indicator what is there on plate at the time of our death and after death …ajamiLa got the bumper, stamped upon the eternal accidentally ☺

A useful exercise is to use those times as practice for guiding one's thoughts towards Atma svarUpa or Ishvara - depending on one's ultimate aim.


Ø   Yes, we should practice with such an intensity as if we are already on the death bed and there is no tomorrow for us…But alas where do we get that teekshNata when IPL matches going on and our favorite team winning on regular basis ☺ ??

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
