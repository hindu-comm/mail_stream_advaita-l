Dear Sri Durga Prasad Janaswamy,
You Write : " My question: What should a sadhaka (not jnani) be cautious at the time of
death?I understand it is difficult, but atleast what should I be aware of."
What should you be aware of ? You should be aware of the necessity to be a Jnani instead of being a sadhaka.You should become a Jnani before the death .
How to become a Jnani?Mantras 2-1-3, 2-1-4 & 1-2-22 of Katha Upanishad and Mantra 2-4 of Kena Upanishad give out in a very simple and direct method to become a Jnani. Why don't you devote your remaining peroiod of life for thi purpose and become a kRutArtha?
With respectful namaskars,Sreenivasa Murthy

 Subject: [Advaita-l] What can one do when one is dying?

Student: But what can one do when one is dying and maybe in the first three
days - was looking at - that can happen any time you know?

Master: As I said, it is not what one can do when you're dying. You will
not have any choice because a death experience will be so frightening to
you, it will be so powerful in your mind, you will not be able to do
anything. But, if you've been practicing eliminating the I all of these
years, perhaps you have not come home yet, awakened yet, but you'll be an
advanced devotee and you will not hold on to the I, you will simply smile
as you leave your body and you will realize that you are I-am,
consciousness.


My question: What should a sadhaka (not jnani) be cautious at the time of
death?
I understand it is difficult, but atleast what should I be aware of.
