Dear all,

Pranams, 
I think this question has been rightly posted and every sadhaka should be aware of what he needs to do,before death overtakes the physical body.

I sincerely thank Sadanandaji for his beautiful reply. I would also like to add here Sri Ramana's reply to major Chadwick who thought that he could go and fall in front of a running bus, thinking that he was brahman and that he would be freed from the vicious cycle of births and deaths after that. Sri Ramana sevrely reprimanded him and advised him to make all-out efforts at achieving unbroken, steady and firm self-abidance in the natural state as the only good option available 

Pranams once again, Ramesh Ramanan
