If moksha is the goal, one is better off working for it when one is hale
and hearty rather than when one is at death's door. Once jnAna is attained,
thoughts at the time of death do not matter.

However if one wishes to prepare for that moment, one can observe one's
thoughts just before falling asleep / or when falls sick to get an idea of
the dominant thought patterns in the subconscious. It is a useful indicator
but by no means definitive.

A useful exercise is to use those times as practice for guiding one's
thoughts towards Atma svarUpa or Ishvara - depending on one's ultimate aim.

Regards,
Venkatraghavan
