Namaste Chandramouliji,

Thanks for the links again, I downloaded the books when you shared them
earlier on.

​I know you are not keen to discuss it, so I shall not drag you back, but
since your comments are on the list, I would reply anyway, in case anyone
else is interested please.

​Would anyone know if these Swamijis talk of DSV/ EJV anywhere ​in any of
their talks in explaining Srishti prakriya of any work? I haven't come
across them myself.

I do not see why it has to be that way and so I do not agree it is that
way. If its not specifically mentioned, one can explain it using either SDV
or DSV as long as the explanation fits. I can bring in DSV too in almost
all creation stories.

​How so? If one sees the world as-if outside, its not really outside. One
has seen and then they are as if outside. It cannot be SDV, but only DSV.

​And me the other way round.​

about ​DSV. I would say that SDV is talked of as SDV, since DSV is a
possibility too.

Once again, thanks for the references, Chandramouliji, though I might take
a while to read them in toto.
