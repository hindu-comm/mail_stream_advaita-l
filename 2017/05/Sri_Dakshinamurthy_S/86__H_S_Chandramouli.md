Copying from earlier post for ready reference

There is a very exhaustive work in english on  << Shri Dakshinamurthy
Stotram - A study based on Manasollasa and Tattvasudha >> written by Sri
Subbaramaiya. It is a Magnum Opus on the subject and is considered the most
authoritative treatise on the same. It is in two volumes which can be
downloaded at the following links.
