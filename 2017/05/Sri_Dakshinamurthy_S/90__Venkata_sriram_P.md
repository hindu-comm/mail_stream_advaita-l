Scholars have approached this wonderful hymn from many angles.  

Some are of the view that दर्पण दृष्टान्त of 1st shloka takes off with बिम्ब-प्रतिबिम्ब वादः (the reflection of Brahman in mirror as Jiva).  
My teacher too expressed this view.  However, he is of the opinion that it is एक-जीव-वादः as echoed by Praveen Ji.

The 1st shloka is quite interesting one and equally is the mirror example. 

regs,
sriram
