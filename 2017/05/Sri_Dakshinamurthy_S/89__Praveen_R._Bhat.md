I was aware of Swamiji's mention of Vicharasagara being DSV-based, but I
didn't quote that in the earlier mail since I do not know if it has a
sRShTiprakriyA per se, and since it is a 19th century work in Hindi,
translated into Sanskrit; again, not so widely taught. I meant more in the
context of teaching Mandukya or any other Upanishad or prakaraNagranthas.
For example, I know that Sw. Tattvavidanandaji had mentioned EJV even in
the context of Brihadaranyaka!
