About the course:
This 30 day course is designed to present the salient ideas of Vedānta
to an audience who have a background in Science, particularly Physics. Concepts
learnt in this course will help the participants to get a fresh
perspective to carry their
research in Science forward.
No background of Vedānta will be assumed on the part of the participants.
A familiarity with high-school and pre-university Physics will be an advantage.
The interpretation of Quantum Mechanics according to the models of Niels Bohr
and David Bohm will be discussed in greater detail in the course.

About Swāmī’ji: Pūjya Swāmī Paramānanda Bhāratī, in his pūrvāśrama was
a Professor
of Physics at IIT Madras. Being the author of many books on Vedānta, Swāmī’ji
feels that scientists should have an exposure to Vedānta and similarly
traditional scholars
of śāstras should have an exposure to Science. Swāmī’ji has taken active part in
organizing and participating in various seminars and conferences that
bring together
scientists and traditionalists.
Swāmī’ji has also established a gurukula in Kolar to preserve and propagate
the Mādhyandina Śākhā of the Śukla-Yajurveda.
