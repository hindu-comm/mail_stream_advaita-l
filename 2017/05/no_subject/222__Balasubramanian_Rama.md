I'm not sure if you have seen this:

https://archive.org/details/VedantaParibhasa1942S.S.SuryanarayanaSastriAdyarLibrary

It's a very good translation with detailed notes. It's not a translation of
any of the commentaries, but S.S.Suryanarayana Sastri's translations are
really the best of the best.
