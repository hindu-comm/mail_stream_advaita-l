Namaste Sri Srinath ji,
Thanks for the invitation, but my time schedule at the present does not
permit following multiple forums.

I appreciate your sensitivity towards others' likes and dislikes (as you
perceive them) and choosing not to respond here.

That is your choice of course, but for what it is worth -

I cannot speak for anyone else, but I see nothing wrong with challenges, as
long as they are presented rationally. It helps to clarify thought and
identify areas where things have not been correctly understood. Of course,
the participants will have to follow basic rules of social decorum etc, but
in general, that should not be too difficult.

Regards,
Venkatraghavan

Namaste,

However much I would like to reply on these Advaitasiddhi postings from an
pUrvapaxin perspective, I am trying to hold myself off due to the fact that
members in this forum is not liking such challenges. This is the main
reason I did not care to reply to recently debated saMvAdi and visaMvAdi
bhramas among other topics.

If anyone interested in learning/debating issues relating to nyAmrita vs.
advaitasiddhi, I would like to invite them to neutral forums meant for such
debates, like vAdavaLi etc.
