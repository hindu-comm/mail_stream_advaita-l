Namaste

People living in glass houses should not throw stones at others.
Appayya Diksita has very rightly said of Madhva -
Poorva-Meemamsaa-Maryaadaa Api Asaamanjasyenaiva Neetaa. He has only
confused people instead of convincing them and breaking all rules of
Purva Meemaamsaa.

Such people can never appreciate Sukshma Vichara of Advaita texts.
