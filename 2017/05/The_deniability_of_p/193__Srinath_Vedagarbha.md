Namaste,

However much I would like to reply on these Advaitasiddhi postings from an
pUrvapaxin perspective, I am trying to hold myself off due to the fact that
members in this forum is not liking such challenges. This is the main
reason I did not care to reply to recently debated saMvAdi and visaMvAdi
bhramas among other topics.

If anyone interested in learning/debating issues relating to nyAmrita vs.
advaitasiddhi, I would like to invite them to neutral forums meant for such
debates, like vAdavaLi etc.
