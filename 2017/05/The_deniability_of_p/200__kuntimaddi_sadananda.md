Venkatraghavanji - PraNAms
I was once a member of this Vaadaavali list - I found it more like jalpavali than vaadaavali - dominated by dvaitin there.
I quit the list when I found that it was useless to do any vaada there.
You are better of not joining the list.
If Shree Srinath has serious arguments against Advaita siddhi, it is better that he presents them here. The list members are much more logical and if they have enough interest they would discuss. Most of the arguments of NyaayaamRita and Advaita Siddhi are based on Navya nyaaya and hair spilling logic with vikalpas that can only split the hair but not much substance from the point of the truth. Same applies to Shatadhushanii of Shree Vedanta Deshika.
Not sure if this appear in the Advaital list since the list has problem with yahoo.mails.
Just my 2c.
Hari Om!Sada

 Subject: Re: [Advaita-l] The deniability of perception

Namaste Sri Srinath ji,
Thanks for the invitation, but my time schedule at the present does not
permit following multiple forums.

I appreciate your sensitivity towards others' likes and dislikes (as you
perceive them) and choosing not to respond here.

That is your choice of course, but for what it is worth -

I cannot speak for anyone else, but I see nothing wrong with challenges, as
long as they are presented rationally. It helps to clarify thought and
identify areas where things have not been correctly understood. Of course,
the participants will have to follow basic rules of social decorum etc, but
in general, that should not be too difficult.

Regards,
Venkatraghavan

Namaste,

However much I would like to reply on these Advaitasiddhi postings from an
pUrvapaxin perspective, I am trying to hold myself off due to the fact that
members in this forum is not liking such challenges. This is the main
reason I did not care to reply to recently debated saMvAdi and visaMvAdi
bhramas among other topics.

If anyone interested in learning/debating issues relating to nyAmrita vs.
advaitasiddhi, I would like to invite them to neutral forums meant for such
debates, like vAdavaLi etc.
