Madhusudhana Sarasvati was a staunch Dvaitin who studied tarkashAstra
under one of the greatest Nyaya teacher of His time, followed by Advaita
Vedanta in order to refute the latter using tarka! Then He went on to study
Purva Mimamsa to refute the same, yet it couldn't be done. Finally, He was
Himself convinced of Advaita Vedanta and thereby refuted dvaitavAda.
Sufficiently said.

Most of us here have a decent idea of how Dvaita groups online treat
someone bringing up advaitavAda there. This group is comparatively much
more lenient.
