Namaste,

The 3rd प्रपाठक of तैत्तिरीय आरण्यकं is called 'चित्ति पन्नम' and every brAhmaNa should study this daily 
as a part of their daily svAdhyAya along with 'svAdhyAya brAhmaNaM".  

The 15th anuvAka is called मृत्यु सूक्तं. The adhiSTAna devata of मृत्यु is prayed as :

परं मृत्यो अनु परेहि पन्थाम् । यस्ते स्व इतरो देवयानात् ॥

"O Lord of Death ! Pls ward off other ways of Death; and bless me with Devayana path"

Shri Bhatta Bhaskara writes : देवयानं पन्थानं मे देहि 

Can anybody comprehend anything more grandeur way here !  A simply superb prayer to Lord of Death.

regs,
sriram
