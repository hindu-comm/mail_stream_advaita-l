Looks like advaitins are a divided lot since Shankara and Madhusudhana Saraswati consider Krishna as Ishwara and the latter considers Rama also as Ishwara.

 Dear Sir,

 The
 Upanishad says: Ishvarānugrahādeva pumsām
 advaitavāsanā. Shankara has
 said in the
 Brahma sutra bhashya: tadanugraha hetukenaiva hi jnānena
 mokṣasiddhir bhavitumarhati. Thus, in order
 to attain the knowledge of
 one's true
 svarupa, one has to have Ishvara's grace. Ishvara's
 grace can be
 had only by worshiping Him. In
 order to know who is Ishwara and who is not,
 such a discussion becomes relevant.


 warm
