Right .. Have you gone through the entire discussion in this section ? or
just catching onto some phrases which seems to strengthen your own opinion
on your claims to see things your way?

Do you find any gaps or shortcomings in the discussion advanced by Advaitin
in this section - BSB 2.2.32?

Do you have any comments to advance the Bauddha school of thoughts
(kshanika vijnAna) further, in continuation to bhAshyakAra's analysis
presented?
