Dear Sri Aathreya

Please see my previous posts in this thread. I have opposed the jIvatva of Rama and Krishna and defended their Ishwaratva. Hope that clarifies my position.

Regards
Kalyan

 This is
 pointless, you guys discussing on Jivatva of Rama or Krishna
 or not even a percent of how they engaged themselves in
 Brahmavaada. One must remember what Sri Krishna says in BG
 that he is the Lord of all beings and descends in the form
 he wills. This is an absolute heresy to Shankara vaada as
 well. Whoever however big have purported the idea of Rama or
 Krishna as Jivas are wrong and take a view which is shruti
 baahira. 
 Thank you,

 Aathreya

 Vidyasankar, I have had enough of
 your pointless posts. I am not going to reply to your
 further posts, unless you specifically address the question
 of the Atman's avidya.

 Vidyasankar, I see that you have no answer to

 the question of the Atman's avidya and you are harping
 on

 insignificant issues. If you want to remove me from the

 forum, feel free to do so. I have no time to write
 lengthy

 posts. I have nothing else to add.

  Yes, I was a previous member of the

 list. You can find some

  of my posts in the archives. You can

 see here for example

  -







  http://lists.advaita-vedanta.

  org/archives/advaita-l/2012-

  February/



  I see a

  new member introduction from a Kalyan

 in Sep 2011, followed

  by some activity from a gmail account

 with a different

  username (kalyankc.81) between Oct

 2011 and Feb 2012. After

  that burst of activity, you seem to

 have dropped off the

  Advaita-L map from March 2012 onward,

 till now,

  resubscribing to the list with a

 different email ID. At

  least, I can't find anything from a

 Kalyan in the

  archives over the intervening five

 years.

  There's nothing saying that you

  shouldn't do this, although I don't

 quite recommend

  it. At the least, when you unsubscribe

 and resubscribe, you

  could be more transparent with the

 moderators in the new

  introduction note that you send

 us.







  Having said that, I dont believe I

 have to prove anything to

  you. You dont need to boss around just

 because you are a

  moderator.



  Ah, there is that attitude again.

  One of the jobs of a moderator is to

 keep the peace among

  list members. At this point, you

 certainly need to prove to

  us that you can participate in

 discussions with other

  members of this list in a civil manner

 and that you can

  express your disagreement with their

 views in a measured

  manner, instead of getting hot under

 the collar at the

  slightest instance. In your responses

 to various list

  members in March and April of 2017,

 your content and tone

  seemed designed to make the moderators

 of this list pay

  special attention to you. If you think

 that is me bossing

  you around, you certainly need to

 rethink your expectations

  of what is involved in the moderation

 of a discussion forum

  online. You can check with the 500

 others on this list, how

  much we moderators actually boss them

  around.

  Seriously,

  what exactly are you trying to prove

 with this belligerence

  of yours? What do you hope to achieve

 by rejoining after a

  hiatus of five years (assuming you

 were not on the list in

  the meantime anyway, under a different

 avatar) and

  immediately picking fights with list

 members and

  moderators?

  Vidyasankar
