For all my statements, I provided a logical explanation. If they looked like personal attacks to you, I cant help it.

 Dear Sri Sriram



 I have not made any personal attacks against Sri
 Subrahmanian - the person who gave the arguments, so your
 contention is wrong.Holding that your questions are to
 Advaitins, all the sentences that attacks Advaitins can be
 ad hominem. The arguments are originally from Appayya
 Dikshitar, while Sri Subrahmanian brought it forth for us.
 The sentences including​1.
 ​"​Looks
 like advaitins are a divided lot since Shankara and
 Madhusudhana Saraswati consider Krishna as Ishwara and the
 latter considers Rama also as Ishwara.​"​ rather
 than, "How can we reconcile the opinions
 ofSriShankaracharyaandSriMadhusudhana
 Saraswathi who consider ..."
 2.Appayya Dikshitha probably has
 not studied the entire Mahabharata3​.Appayya Dikshita ultimately comes
 out as a very poor reader of the great epic.​​were ad
 hominem.​ I have only said that
 Appayya Dikshita comes across as a poor reader of the epic.
 Here is the reason why - Rama does not become a jIva just
 because he goes to svarga and is under Indra's lordship
 because Ishwara can be present in multiple places at the
 same time. Krishna does not become a jIva because he says he
 fell under delusion because the Mahabharata itself says that
 Krishna beguiles everyone and does actions as though he is
 powerless.



 Ishannapi mahAyogI sarvasya jagato hariH |

 karmANyArabhate kartuM kInAsha iva durbalaH || 14||



 tena va~nchayate lokAnmAyAyogena keshavaH |

 ye tameva prapadyante na te muhyanti mAnavAH || 15||
 (Mbh.5.66)



 So the so-called stray verses that Appayya Dikshita was
 using were not really showing jIvatva of either Rama or
 Krishna.


 Exactly, all advaitis agree to
 this claim of yours! These verses DO NOT establish the
 jivatva of Rama or Krishna. But on the other hand, if
 somebody quotes similar verses on Shiva and claim Shiva is
 jiva, it cannot be accepted. All that Appayya dikshitar
 ​​has shown is that, using the
 above said logic, even Rama or Krishna can be proved to be
 Jiva.​

 Dear Kalyan

 ji,

 While kindly

 advising you to refrain from ad hominem (attacking the

 arguing person rather than the argument) I would like to

 answer you.

 Please

 read the link sent by Sri Subramaniam ji. Appayya
 Dikshita

 is indeed saying that "if you can pick individual

 phrases from Ramayana Mahabharata etc and claim Shiva is

 Jeeva, it is not difficult to pick isolated phrases, or
 even

 chapters to show Rama and Krishna are jeeva. He just
 showed

 that with clever choice of selecting stanzas, even the

 counter argument can be implied. All that Sri Appayya

 Dikshita claims finally is Hari-Hara abheda.

 It is the same paramatma who is

 brahma, shiva, Hari or Indra."Sa brahma sa

 shiva sa hari saendra "

 I have

 touched upon only Rama. The idea that the Mahabharata

 considers Krishna as not Ishwara, is not even worth

 refuting. It is hilarious. At so many places in the

 Mahabharata is Krishna described as Ishwara, that it is

 pointless to list them all. Appayya Dikshita ultimately

 comes out as a very poor reader of the great epic.

 Appayya Dikshitha probably
 has not studied



 the entire Mahabharata. In
 Shanti parvan, when Vishnu

 shows



 his Vishwaroopa to Narada, Vishnu says that he will be

 born



 as Dasaratha's son Rama.







 sandhau tu samanuprApte
 tretAyAM



 dvAparasya cha |



 rAmo dAsharathirbhUtvA bhaviShyAmi



 jagatpatiH || Mbh 12.326.78







 Thus, the Mahabharata itself



 establishes Rama as Ishwara. Moreover Valmiki Ramayana

 also



 considers Rama as Ishwara. One must not study a text in

 bits



 and pieces.

 Kalyan

  A post on the above topic is available



 here



  for reading:







  https://adbhutam.wordpress.
 com/2017/05/20/rama-and- krishna-are-jiva-s-
 mahabharata/











  regards



  subrahmanian.v











  In the short work 'Bhārata sāraga



  sangraha stotram', Sri Appayya



 Dikshita



  concludes by pointing out that Rama



 and



  Krishna were jiva-s, endowed with



  karma, delusion, etc. on the



 authority



  of the Mahabharata:







  गोप्तारं ततो



  गच्छेत्







 सरव्यास्तीर्थमुत्तमम्



  ।



  तत्र रामो गतः



  स्वर्गं







 सभृत्यबलवाहनः ॥



  देहं



  त्यक्त्वा



 दिवं यातः







 स्थास्यतीन्द्रस्य



  वैभवात् ।’







  [Rama went to svarga along with his



  retinue, after giving up the body,



 and



  remains there with Indra's lordship.]







  इति







 गोप्रतारतीर्थमहिम्ना



  श्रीरामस्य







 स्वर्गप्रतिष्ठावचनात्;



  सभापर्वणि



  यमसभावर्णने -







  Having thus proclaimed the greatness



 of



  Go-pratāra, Sri Rama's settlement



  in Svarga, the sabhā parvan of the



  Mahabharata while describing the



  Assembly Hall of Yama further says:







  तस्यां



  राजर्षयः



 पुण्यास्तथा







 देवर्षयोऽमराः ।



  यमं वैवस्वतं



  तात



 प्रहृष्टाः



  पर्युपासते ॥



  ययातिर्नहुषः







 पूरुर्मान्धाता

 सोमको



  नृगः ।







  



  इत्यारभ्य







 स्वर्गप्राप्त्यनन्तरं







 यमसभायामास्थाय



  तमुपासीनानां



  राजर्षीणां



  परिगणनेन,



  ’रामो



 दाशरथिश्चैव



  लक्षमणश्च



 प्रतर्दनः’



  इति परिगणनेन च



 सोऽपि







 कर्माधीनलोकप्राप्तिको



  जीवविशेषः



 स्यात् ।







  In the Assembly Hall of Yama are



  present: Rajarshi-s with puṇya,



  devarshi-s, deva-s, who happily



  meditate upon Yama. Also are Yayati,



  Nahusha, Puru, Māndhāta, Somaka,



  Nṛga. Having enumerated those



 present in



  the Assembly and meditating Yama, the



  Mahabharata includes: Rāma the son



 of



  Dasharatha, Lakshmana and Pratardana.



  By so counting Rama along with all



  other entities, it can be concluded



  that Rama is a jiva who has attained



 a



  loka that is subject to and



 attainable



  by karma.
