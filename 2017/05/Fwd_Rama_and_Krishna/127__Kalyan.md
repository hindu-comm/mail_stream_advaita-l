Dear Sri Praveen

I dont believe in the Vishnu vs Shiva debate but I am confident of one thing. Vaishnavaites do not believe Shiva can give moksha. So one can argue similarly that vaishnavas are criticizing Shaivism for doctrinal reasons alone.

Regards
Kalyan

 Shankara has criticized mimamsa, nyaya,
 samkhya, yoga, vaiseshika, bauddha, jaina, pashupata,
 pancaratra, carvaka philosophers in his commentaries. To say
 that advaitins do not criticize anybody is far removed from
 reality.

 ​​There's a
 huge difference between criticising a sampradAya or a deity
 just because it is not one's own versus criticising the
 following as it does not lead to mokSha. Bhagvatpadacharya
 does the latter, as compared to all others who followed
 Advaita Vedanta.
