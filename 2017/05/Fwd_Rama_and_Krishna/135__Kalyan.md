Hey Supreme Lord Sriman VIdyasankar prabhu, thou art the yogeshwara who possesses the superhuman ability to read my mind and classify my posts as patronizing or uncivil or disruptive or whatnot. Forgive my sins my Lord. I am no match for you. I am a mere mortal ordinary human being.
PS: There is a proverb in Telugu. "Narayana ante kooda kondaru boothu ani anukuntaaru". I shall not translate it.

 It is merely a harsh reality, Kalyan. Of course, your two lines of response to Anand Hudli came across as being either quite sarcastic or extremely patronizing. I find it telling that you do not cite anything about your interactions with the other list members I named earlier. I also find it telling that you jumped to talking about sarcasm here. It shows that you are well aware how your readership view you.
