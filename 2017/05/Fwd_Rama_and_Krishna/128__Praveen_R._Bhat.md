Well, thats interesting. You objected to Rama and Krishna being called as a
jIva ​by some quotations. Unless you agree that Shiva being called as a
jIva by anyone is equally objectionable, you partially believe in the
debate.

​They are a few steps ahead of dvaitins in this area perhaps, since
Purandara Dasa prays to Shiva for a tailadhAravat manas in harI, which is
hopefully the means to their mokSha.

saying that the reasons for which Shiva is set aside as a jIva applied to
Rama or Krishna also.

On a related matter, I do not know as to why those who call themselves as
Vedantins following, Advaita Vedanta take to a non-Vedanta source as having
more authority in their doctrine.
