Kalyan,

1. You are not the first nor the only "not a traditional advaitin" on this
list. That is not an excuse for your obnoxiousness here. In my experience,
unlike you, most "not traditional advaitins" are quite decent people and
pleasant to deal with.

2. You are the first "not traditional advaitin" here, who has been so
disruptive in every discussion thread where you have participated. The
manner and content of your responses to various members, including Anand
Hudli, YR Bhaskar, Praveen Bhat, S Venkataraghavan and V Subrahmanian among
others, has always been questionable at best, all through the last three
months. I watched and waited till this last week, before pulling moderator
rank on you, to tell you that your modus operandi is not appreciated by
anybody with whom you have chosen to engage during this time.

3. Your behavior on this list is completely contradictory to your stated
purposed of wanting "to understand how traditional advaitins are convinced
of the truth of the philosophy." The manner of your engagement with
"traditional advaitins" is guaranteed to generate nothing but
misunderstanding. In any case, your introductory note conveniently left out
that you saw "unresolvable (sic) questions and contradictions." If you had
stated that up front, we moderators would have asked you to clarify, prior
to subjecting 500+ members of this list to these unsavory exchanges in
public.

4. You are in no position to claim that you have not personally attacked
any member of this forum. I gave you a mild warning about modulating your
online behavior and you launched into an attack on the entire list in
response.

Through that one post, you questioned the integrity of every single person
who is on this list. As a moderator, I'm merely doing my job. I have had to
drag it out of you, regarding your past history as a member of this list
from a different email ID. Hiding who you are is operating in bad faith.I
have asked you why you still want to associate yourself with us, no matter
which way you look at it. Your answer to that part is still pending.

5. Of course, you can only expect "similar behavior" from our side. And you
are getting back exactly that, although it is actually a lot milder than
what you otherwise deserve. Still, you reap as you sow.

Vidyasankar
