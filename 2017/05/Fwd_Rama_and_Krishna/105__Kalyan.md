Namaste Praveenji

To say that the title is a mere misnomer is an understatement. It reminds me of page 3 tabloids.

 Thus, the Mahabharata itself establishes Rama as Ishwara.
 Moreover Valmiki Ramayana also considers Rama as Ishwara.
 One must not study a text in bits and pieces.
 The title, perhaps
 intentionally, was a left a misnomer. You would have done
 well to take your own advice and read the whole mail to know
 what is being talked of.
 And again, kindly
 refrain from showing down the stalwarts of the
 tradition.
