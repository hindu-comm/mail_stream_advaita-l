Dear Sir,

The Upanishad says: Ishvarānugrahādeva pumsām advaitavāsanā. Shankara has
said in the Brahma sutra bhashya: tadanugraha hetukenaiva hi jnānena
mokṣasiddhir bhavitumarhati.  Thus, in order to attain the knowledge of
one's true svarupa, one has to have Ishvara's grace. Ishvara's grace can be
had only by worshiping Him. In order to know who is Ishwara and who is not,
such a discussion becomes relevant.
