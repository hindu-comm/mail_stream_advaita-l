Dear Sriram ji,

Vedanta Deshika in his work 'Sankalpa Suryodaya' (a drama) has composed a
sequence where a character keeps his leg on the head of Shiva. A legend
says that Appayya Dikshita was called to witness the enactment and on
witnessing this scene he was extremely moved and that also triggered his
zeal for establishing Shiva pāramya.

So, the bigotry of Vedanta Deshika is well known.

A true study of shastras does not result in bigotry of the above type. He
has thrown to winds the central theme of the scriptures declared by Veda
Vyasa in the immortal verse of the Mahabharata:

रुद्रो नारायणश्चैव सत्त्वमेकं द्विधा कृतम्।
लोके चरति कौन्तेय व्यक्तिस्थं सर्वकर्मसु।। 12-350-27a 12-350-27b.

It is One Principle that appears as Rudra and Narayana...

I understand what you mean by the above: by worshiping whichever deity one
approaches the Vedantic Truth, that is admissible. Sureshwara's words are
clear:

यया यया भवेत् पुंसां व्युत्पत्तिः प्रत्यगात्मनि । सा सैव प्रक्रियेह स्यात्
साध्वी सा चानवस्थिता ॥ Since the aspirants' make-up can be varied,
whichever method that suits one is good enough.

The words of the famous Mahimna stotram of Pushpadanta, which has been
commented upon by Madhusudana Saraswati too is relevant here:

त्रयी सांख्यं योगः पशुपतिमतं वैष्णवमिति प्रभिन्ने प्रस्थाने परमिदमदः
पथ्यमिति च ।
रुचीनां वैचित्र्यादजुकुटिलनानापथजुषां नृणामेको गम्य स्त्वमसि पयसामर्णव इव
॥७॥
