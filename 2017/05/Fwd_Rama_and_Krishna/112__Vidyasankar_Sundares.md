Sorry, as far as I am concerned, you have missed the entire point of my
stepping into this thread. I am exercising my duty as a moderator of the
list to bring order to a discussion that has gotten unruly, thanks mostly
to one member's outbursts. So, Sri Aathreya, I suggest that you read each
post in the entire thread carefully.

There is no vedAnta vicAra of any kind without basic viveka. What is
pointless is getting into a discussion without the ability to apply that
viveka towards how you understand or misunderstand other people's words. If
you want to understand something about the method of logical arguments
being used in such works as the one by appayya dIkshita with which this
thread started and the reasons why these works were written in the first
place, then I suggest that everybody take a step back, breathe and take
care not to deliberately misunderstand one another. Recriminations and ill
feeling do not contribute to the health of any discussion.

Unless anybody has anything to add to go back to where this thread started
from, I also suggest that everybody move on to other topics. I will allow
another two days for others to respond. If the tenor doesn't improve, I
will declare this thread closed, in order to force people to move on to
other discussions.
