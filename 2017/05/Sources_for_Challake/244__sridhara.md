Dear Suresh,The mahanyasam vedic mantras of challakere brothers is available in Ramakrishna mission at Basavanagudi, Bangalore or mysore. If you are not staying in these cities, you can request them to send it by courier. Best is to ask some of your known contacts to visit & buy.Yes, it's the best rendering of Mahanyasam - classic in every aspect.Thanks,SriFrom: Suresh Rajagopalan via Advaita-l <advaita-l at lists.advaita-vedanta.org>Sent: Sun, 28 May 2017 02:40:19To: A discussion group for Advaita Vedanta <advaita-l at lists.advaita-vedanta.org>Cc: Suresh Rajagopalan <sraja97 at gmail.com>Subject: [Advaita-l] Sources for Challakere brothers audioHello,I have several audio CD's by Challakere brothers which I greatly revere.Based on a earlier discussion on the list it appears I don't have all oftheir recordings.If Mr Bhaskar or anyone can tell me where I can get Mahanyasam or Rigvedaby Challakere brothers I would greatly appreciate it.RegardsSuresh------------
