Request all the vipras here to pass on the message to needy brahmins in Andhra.  Some good job
opportunities are coming up for unemployed youth as well as for smArta veda pundits / vedic scholars.

There are also opening up placement cells.  Some important Govt. orders, notifications, govt. schemes
