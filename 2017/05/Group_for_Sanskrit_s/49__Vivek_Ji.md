Hari Om dear group members

I have been studying with the "Teach yourself Sanskrit" books and also found over 500 videos on youtube that go through the whole course, which has been a huge help.

Since itâ€™s really been helping me a lot with learning Sanskrit I created a Facebook group for discussion about this course books and also help each other and share things related to this series.

Please feel free to join and share with anyone that could be interested.
