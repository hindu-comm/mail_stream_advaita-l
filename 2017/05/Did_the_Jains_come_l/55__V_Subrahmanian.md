In this video talk eminent scholar Sri Bannanje Govindacharya traces the
evolution of thought with regard to the size of the Atma. At 9 minutes 20
seconds in the video, he says, the Jains came 'after' Shankara, with their
thought that the atma is of madhyama parimana.

However we see that this thought is refuted in the Brahma sutras. It is
well known that the Jaina darshana preceded even the Bauddha.

Shankara has upheld that the Vedantic Atman is infinite. He has already
dealt with the Jaina view. So the scholar's statement about the chronology
seems variant from facts.
