In the archives of this list you can find a post be me analyzing the 
description of the "Buddha" avatar in Vishnu Purana and showing it could 
apply equally to Jains as well Buddhists.

There are 24 prophets of the Jains called Tirthankars of whom Mahavir is 
the last in this yuga-cycle.  Another earlier one is Rshabhadev who is 
mentioned in the Bhagavata and other puranas as an avatara of Vishnu 
Bhagavan.

I'm sure Shri Govindacharya knows this.  It does not seem likely a vidvan 
of his calibre  would make such an elementary mistake.  I wonder if as the 
"Jain view" he is refering to the great Hemachandra who holds a position 
similar to Shankaracharya for Jains atleast Shvetambar ones.  He is 
post-shankara in chronology as far as I can recall.
