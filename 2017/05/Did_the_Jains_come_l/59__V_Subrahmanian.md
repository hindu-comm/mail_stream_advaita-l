In the archives of this list you can find a post be me analyzing the
description of the "Buddha" avatar in Vishnu Purana and showing it could
apply equally to Jains as well Buddhists.

There are 24 prophets of the Jains called Tirthankars of whom Mahavir is
the last in this yuga-cycle.  Another earlier one is Rshabhadev who is
mentioned in the Bhagavata and other puranas as an avatara of Vishnu
Bhagavan.

I'm sure Shri Govindacharya knows this.  It does not seem likely a vidvan
of his calibre  would make such an elementary mistake.  I wonder if as the
"Jain view" he is refering to the great Hemachandra who holds a position
similar to Shankaracharya for Jains atleast Shvetambar ones.  He is
post-shankara in chronology as far as I can recall.


But the concept of the middling sized ( body-sized) Atman that the scholar
is talking of as jaina (aarhata) view was already there before Shankara and
refuted by him in the Brahmasutra bhashya:

ब्रह्मसूत्रभाष्यम्द्वितीयोऽध्यायःद्वितीयः पादः सूत्रम् ३४ - भाष्यम्

………जीवस्य अकार्त्स्न्यमपरो दोषः प्रसज्येत । कथम् ? शरीरपरिमाणो हि जीव इत्या
र्हता मन्यन्ते ; शरीरपरिमाणतायां च सत्याम् , अकृत्स्नोऽसर्वगतः परिच्छिन्न
आत्मेत्यतो………
