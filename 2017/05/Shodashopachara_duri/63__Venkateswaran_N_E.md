Request members to clarify the following question I have.

During any homa, after invoking the devata in the Agni, we do a quick
shodashopachara.

My question is whether the akshata and pushpa used for avahana, simhasana,
vastra, yajnopavita, Pushpak Hans etc should be offered into the fire or in
front of the Vedi ?
I've seen both practices, hence the question.

Any pramanas/shistachara references would also be appreciated.

Warm regards
Venkateswaran
