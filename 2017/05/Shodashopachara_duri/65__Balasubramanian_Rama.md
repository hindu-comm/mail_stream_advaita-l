In the Tamil aapastamba smaarta tradition, there is no ShoDashopacAra pUjA
for Agni in agnimukham. In the case of certain homes such as navagraha
homam, the navagraha and other devatas are invoked in a kalasha, placed
usually north of the vedi. The ShoDashopacAra pUjA and punaH pUjA are for
the kalasham only.

Which tradition is this?

Rama
