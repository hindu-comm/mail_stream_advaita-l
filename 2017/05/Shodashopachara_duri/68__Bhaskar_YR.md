praNAms Sri Ramakrishnan prabhuji and Sri Venkateswaran prabhuji
Hare Krishna

The vaidika homam as I know of it does not have ShoDashopacAra for Agni.

>  Though I am not aware of the mention of shODashOpachAra Pooja for yagneshwara in Apasthambha sUtra, it is a standard practice in our vaidika circle that we do this Pooja after hOma precisely after visarjana of pragAdi paristaraNa and brahma.  We start this Pooja by saying  hOmAnte Sri yagneshwarayanamaH  dhyAnaadi shOdashOpachaara poojaam  karishye...etc. and we would offer the remains of Ajya (ghee) also as the naivedyaM during this pooja.  And we do pradikshaNa to the yagneshwara with mantra-s like agne naya supathA rAye asmaan and shloka-s like agnim prajwalitaM vande jaatvedam hutaashanaM.....namaste garhapatyAya Namaste dakshiNaagnaye namaste Ahavaneeyaaya yagneshaaya namOnamaH...saptahasta chatushrunga..and we do prArthana also svasti, shraddhAm, medhAm yashaH, prajnAm etc.  and do praNAms after chanting pravara.  Yasyasmrutyaa cha namOktyaa tapOhOma kriyaadishu....mantra heenaM kriyaaheenam bhakti heenaM hutaashana etc. anena yaavachakti dhyAna Avahanaadi Pooja vidhaanena yagneshwara supreeta suprasanna varadaa bhavantu..

> And then only we do the kalasha Pooja (araadhitaanaam devataanaam punaraaradhanaM karishye). 

> But as I said above, I donâ€™t know whether this Pooja vidhAna has been suggested in homa vidhi / agnimukha  in sUtra and kapardi kArika.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
