I knew you would warn me sooner or later. This list is meant for a coterie of a few. A mutual admiration society, I should say. If somebody does not fall in line, he or she is out.

Now do whatever you want to do as the moderator.

Regards
Kalyan

 Kalyan, I have a two part
 answer for you. The first is as an individual responding to
 you. The second is as a moderator of this list.
 If you know yourself as nirguNa, nirviSesha, then
 you are no longer an ignoramus. If you know yourself as any
 other, then you are the biggest ignoramus. Yet, whatever
 little you know in your ignorance is only through the light
 of your own self. Therefore, this nirguNa nirviSesha self is
 described as the paraMjyoti.
 That said, watch your language and your combative
 attitude. This list does not exist to fatten anybody's
 ego. Over the course of several posts, it appears that your
 motive is to showcase how well you can get under the skins
 of other list members. In that case, take it elsewhere. It
 contradicts your professed claims of wanting to have
 productive discussions. You are trying the patience of
 almost everybody here. The moderators have mostly taken a
 benign attitude towards your posting history, but this is
 something up with which we don't have to put
 forever.

 Isn't
 the nirguNa nirvishesha Atman itself the biggest and only
 ignoramus in advaita? It beats me how such an Atman,
 wallowing in ignorance, can be described as param jyoti.

 Sayana in the bhashya to this sukta says - it

 is not any mūrtiviṣeśa, that

 is not any

 particular form, meaning that it is Nirguna Brahman. He

 gives

 the shruti 'param

 jyotirupasampadya..' which is discussed in the brahma

 sutra bhashya as the self that is realized upon

 right knowledge. This is

 nirguna Brahman in

 Advaita. Sayana also says that this entity is the

 adhishthana for the aropita jagat. That is

 again nirguna brahman.
