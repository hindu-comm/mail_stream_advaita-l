I think Kalyanji's question was clear enough, there was no clarity sought.

​No it is not.​

​His statement was "Isn't the nirguNa nirvishesha Atman itself the biggest
and only ignoramus in advaita". Will he or you be satisfied with no as an
answer? You will quote that but it is, since there is nothing other than
Atman, to which I will say yes too. Ergo, my follow on question of mithyA.

Rather, that is why AV brings in the same. If you went to sleep alone, how
are you dreaming ​the entire dvandva prapancha in svapnAvasthA? What does
it rest on? Did you divide and become many? Did you undergo change? The
dreamer is ignorant about being the waker along with the waking world.
Therefore, he takes the dreamer along with the dream world as real. Ditto.

NB is the Ashraya, which is unopposed to knowledge and ignorance alike,
just as the desert land is the Ashraya for mirage-water without being
affected.

If it cannot then why invoke ignorance argument to explain away duality?

I didn't say that ​ignorance is ​a guNa of NB; why ignorance, sat, chit and
Ananda are also not guNas of NB.

​Wonderful, please do. However, unless Kalyanji himself agrees with your
explanation, I can't assume that his understanding is same as yours.​

​More the merrier.​ Then, one can easily switch between each of these
definitions as used at each AV statement.

Ignoring all those technical definitions aside, let me say -- mithya is not

​I don't know this definition as being an AV definition at all, viz. sat
being confused as [atyanta] asat and vice-versa! Please elaborate as to
where this definition is seen in AV.
