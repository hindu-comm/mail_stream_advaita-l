// sa brahma sa śivaḥ sa hariḥ sendraḥ so'kṣaraḥ paramaḥ svarāṭ.//

There are few who chant this with slight changes.  "sa hariH" is omitted by them. 

Their pATha is:

"sa brahma sa śivaḥ sendraḥ so'kṣaraḥ paramaḥ svarāṭ"

This was told once by Shri.Devanathacharya during his discourse in Vedic Seminar held at
Tirupathi.

regs,
sriram
