//​This is answered in 2.1.13 of Brahma-sutra bhashya. ​It is only an axiomatic statement from the purvapakshi that we should swim or sink together. But there are counter-examples to that even in Pratyaksha (ल्लोकवत्). You call the bubbles in the ocean as ocean itself, not essentially different from ocean. You call the waves in the ocean as ocean itself, not essentially different. But never will you call bubbles are the same as waves! Though this difference was really told for existence of bhokta-bhogya difference (भोक्त्रापत्तेरविभागश्चेत् स्याल्लोकवत् ), it is applicable to your questions too.//

The ocean analogy does not work because the ocean is heterogenous while the Atman is homogenous.

 Sri Bharati Thirtha says, even if a
 question is asked in an improper manner, answers have to be
 given, otherwise the questioner might think that
 Vedanti's don't have answers. It is only an advise
 for the questioner that such improper vinaya viheena
 questions will not lead to his enlightenment.

 I am amused Vidyasankar.
 How could your warning have come sooner when I write only
 occasionally on the list?



 I think this list is a coterie, but I have no plans to quit
 on my own since I am only an occasional participant.



 Now moving on to your answer to my main question- If I know
 myself as nirvishesha Atman, I am no longer an ignoramus.
 But who was I before I gained this knowledge? Wasn't I
 the Atman? Isn't the Atman then the biggest ignoramus?
 ​I am not qualified to answer
 this, I leave this to more qualified
 members.​


 Moreover, you and I are both the One and same Atman. Why
 does my knowledge automatically not lead to your knowledge?
 After all, being the same entity, we both sink and swim
 together. Why do we both have to separately strive for
 liberation?
 ​This is
 answered in 2.1.13
 of Brahma-sutra bhashya. ​It is only an axiomatic
 statement from the purvapakshi that we should swim or sink
 together. But there are counter-examples to that even in
 Pratyaksha (ल्लोकवत्).
 You call the bubbles in the ocean as ocean itself, not
 essentially different from ocean. You call the waves in the
 ocean as ocean itself, not essentially different. But never
 will you call bubbles are the same as waves! Though this
 difference was really told forexistence of bhokta-bhogya
 difference (भोक्त्रापत्तेरविभागश्चेत्

 If you knew that, Kalyan, you

 should agree that this comes much later, rather than

 sooner. And if you think this list forms a coterie that

 excludes you, the decision about what comes next is

 yours.

 I knew you would warn me sooner or later. This list is
 meant

 for a coterie of a few. A mutual admiration society, I

 should say. If somebody does not fall in line, he or she
 is

 out.







 Now do whatever you want to do as the moderator.

 Kalyan, I have a two part



 answer for you. The first is as an individual
 responding

 to



 you. The second is as a moderator of this list.



 If you know yourself as nirguNa, nirviSesha, then



 you are no longer an ignoramus. If you know yourself as

 any



 other, then you are the biggest ignoramus. Yet,
 whatever



 little you know in your ignorance is only through the

 light



 of your own self. Therefore, this nirguNa nirviSesha
 self

 is



 described as the paraMjyoti.



 That said, watch your language and your combative



 attitude. This list does not exist to fatten

 anybody's



 ego. Over the course of several posts, it appears that

 your



 motive is to showcase how well you can get under the

 skins



 of other list members. In that case, take it elsewhere.

 It



 contradicts your professed claims of wanting to have



 productive discussions. You are trying the patience of



 almost everybody here. The moderators have mostly taken
 a



 benign attitude towards your posting history, but this
 is



 something up with which we don't have to put



 forever.

 Isn't



 the nirguNa nirvishesha Atman itself the biggest and
 only



 ignoramus in advaita? It beats me how such an Atman,



 wallowing in ignorance, can be described as param
 jyoti.
