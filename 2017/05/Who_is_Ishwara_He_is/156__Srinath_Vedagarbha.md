Whatever your answer on mithyA, it does not take away the position that at
least as long mithya is said to be there (i.e during vyavahArika avastha),
only nirguNa brahman is said to be under the spell of that avidya. That is
the distinction.

That is not the problem in the case of desert because it allows us to posit
the guNa (of being Ashraya or Ashrayattva). No one claims desert is
nirguNa. This cannot be said so in the case of Brahman, for by definition
it is nirguNa, including Ashraya for anything.

Isn't it your question to Sri.Kalyan -- "If the Atman is nirguNa
nirvishesha, how can he have the attribute of ignorance?" . Because you use
the hEtu (of Atman being nirguNa) in questioning sAdya of Atman having
attribute of ignorance, I am justified in translating attribute = guNa. If
you now disagree, then you have flaw in your duShaNAnumAna tarka in the
first place.

Isn't it entire adhyAsa-bhAShya is all about this confusion?
