Vidyasankar
I will keep this short. My posts and questions are straightforward. That may appear as combative to some. Another reason is that the Atman's avidya is an unsolved issue in advaita. Or at least I have not heard any satisfactory resolution of the issue. So people might interpret questions on this topic as combative. Hence I get responses like - "what are you trying to achieve in this list", "you must go to an AchArya" or "we have questions to your answers but your questioning method is not correct" or "it is a waste to discuss this with you", etc.etc. I see your reaction to my posts as part of the same trend.

 Kalyan,
Here's an exercise you can do. Please visit http://lists.advaita-vedanta.org/archives/advaita-l, click on the links that say "author" and count the number of your posts each month over the last three months or so. Also count how many posts were sent by me and by Jaldhar Vyas, another moderator, and by say, DVN Sarma or Praveen Bhat, other regular list members over the same time period. Then tell me whether you can actually count yourself as only an occasional contributor on this list. After that look at the basic numbers, take a look at the content of your posts and be a little honest with yourself about your constantly combative attitude on this list. This last post of yours to which I'm responding now is itself a case in point.
