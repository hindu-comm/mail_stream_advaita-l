the only real entity admitted within advaita is Brahman. Therefore, there can

of duality itself is unwarranted, because we hold that such a duality
itself does not exist - why search for the cause of something that does not
exist? Like how we do not seek the cause for an asat vastu in vyavahAra,
there is no need to the seek the cause for avidyA or mAyA or duality in
pAramArtha.

Not true, for reasons given above. From the standpoint of vyavahAra, we say
that avidyA is anAdi, and a beginning-less entity requires no cause which
would lead to AtmAshraya.

What makes you think that there is a vyAvahArika avastha? If you say it is
because of my statement, then I will say that the purpose of my statement
was to merely satisfy your curiosity, from the standpoint of ultimate
reality no explanations need be given. No explanations can be given.


If you say it is because of your experience of everyday reality, I will say
that your experience of everyday reality is only evidence of everyday
reality, not  ultimate reality.

One does not posit ignorance because there is vyAvahArika viewpoint – one
posits ignorance to ultimately invalidate vyAvahArika viewpoint.

What do you mean by "given"? If you mean - does raw data of perception have
pAramArthika validity? Then we do not agree. Perception is incapable of
establishing the pAramArthika satyatvam (ie tri-kAla abAdhitvam) of
anything.

If you mean - does perception have vyAvahArika validity? I agree it does.
The mithyAtva of the perceived object does not invalidate its vyAvahArika
satya as established by perception, for you to claim that there is driShTa
hAni.

It is by introducing avidyA. This is classic adhyAropa apavAda teaching.

Sorry, the words "without any real basis in shruti" is an addition on your
part, that was not intended by what I said. The tAtvikatvam or atAtvikatvam
of jnana is dependent on whether the jnana viShaya is bAdhitam or not.
Ultimately every thing with the exception of Brahman is bAdhitam -
therefore, even within shruti, it is only those vAkyas that have tAtparya
as Brahman which are  tAtvika - the problem of atAtvikatvam does not exist
merely for the concept of avidyA, but every jnAna, with the exception of
brahma jnAna.

I was not intending this to mean for a third person. By one realising the
truth, I mean whether brahma jnana has arisen for me or not  - if it has,
then the mithyA object never existed in any point of time. If it has not
arisen, then the object continues existing as mithyA, ie as vyAvahArika
satya. Really speaking, there is no epistemological error, because
epistemology itself implies a tripuTi, which does not exist after
realisation. The point I wanted to make was that calling mithyA ontological
is only in vyavahAra, as a concession to you, I said you can call it
epistemological after jnAna, but really speaking it is non-existent.

Before its bAdha, mithyA is very much an ontological category. After its

from the standpoint of ultimate reality, because of the absence of the
subject-object-instrument tripuTi. Therefore, any description or definition
of mithyA serves only to negate the reality of prapancha. What must be
noted is that both prapancha and its abhAva are ultimately only
vyAvahArika. For a jnAna to be yatArtha / tAtvika, it does not require it
to be made from the standpoint of reality, it only requires that the jnAna
viShaya is not subsequently sublated.
