Namaste

I listen to this popular Narayana Bhajan without fail everyday like
many many people -

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BnLfUf1Iefc

In the Narayana Sukta Narayana is the Ultimate Ishwara. Who is He? The
Upanisad has said -

sa brahma sa śivaḥ sa hariḥ sendraḥ so'kṣaraḥ paramaḥ svarāṭ.

He is Brahma, Siva, Vishnu, Indra and other gods. He is the
Imperishable, the Absolute, the Autonomous Being.
