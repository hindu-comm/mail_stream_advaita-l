Could you please give this reference where Sureshwara says antaryAmi could be brahma, vishnu or shiva? I thought antaryAmi was Atman.

 In the
 Br.up. Antaryami Brahmana, Shankara has identified the
 antaryami
 with 'Narayana' and stated
 that it is sakshimatra (nirguna brahman).
 Sureshwara while elucidating this in the
 Vartika has clearly said that the
 'antaryami' of the Vedanta can be
 anyone: Brahma, Vishnu or Shiva.

 It should also be remembered that Shankara in
 the Kenopanishad pada bhashya
 identified
 Umapati as 'sarvajna Ishwara.' In this very Kena
 bhashya he has
 very clearly stated that if
 the Brahman is any formed entity like Vishnu,
 Ishwara, Indra, Prajapati, that is, upasya, as
 'different from the upasaka'
  it
 will have to be a-brahma and anātma. He concludes that the
 Kena 1.5 is
 specifically aimed at warding
 off any entity other than the aspirant's true
 self as Brahman. This is nothing but Nirguna
 Brahman.
