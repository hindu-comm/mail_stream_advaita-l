Sayana in the bhashya to this sukta says - it is not any mūrtiviṣeśa, that
is not any particular form, meaning that it is Nirguna Brahman. He gives
the shruti 'param jyotirupasampadya..' which is discussed in the brahma
sutra bhashya as the self that is realized upon right knowledge. This is
nirguna Brahman in Advaita.  Sayana also says that this entity is the
adhishthana for the aropita jagat. That is again nirguna brahman.
