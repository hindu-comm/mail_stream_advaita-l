The 'question' Kalyan is posing has been answered many times over in this
list and also in the BVP. His inability to comprehend the answers, he is
transferring to others as their inability to answer. It is clear that he
has an agenda: to discredit Advaita and Shankara. A true jijnasu will not
display this kind of behavior. It is best he is ignored.
