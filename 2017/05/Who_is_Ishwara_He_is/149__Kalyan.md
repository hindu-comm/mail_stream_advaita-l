Isn't the nirguNa nirvishesha Atman itself the biggest and only ignoramus in advaita? It beats me how such an Atman, wallowing in ignorance, can be described as param jyoti.

 Sayana in the bhashya to this sukta says - it
 is not any mūrtiviṣeśa, that
 is not any
 particular form, meaning that it is Nirguna Brahman. He
 gives
 the shruti 'param
 jyotirupasampadya..' which is discussed in the brahma
 sutra bhashya as the self that is realized upon
 right knowledge. This is
 nirguna Brahman in
 Advaita. Sayana also says that this entity is the
 adhishthana for the aropita jagat. That is
 again nirguna brahman.
