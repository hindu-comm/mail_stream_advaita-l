I am amused Vidyasankar. How could your warning have come sooner when I write only occasionally on the list?

I think this list is a coterie, but I have no plans to quit on my own since I am only an occasional participant.

Now moving on to your answer to my main question- If I know myself as nirvishesha Atman, I am no longer an ignoramus. But who was I before I gained this knowledge? Wasn't I the Atman? Isn't the Atman then the biggest ignoramus? 

Moreover, you and I are both the One and same Atman. Why does my knowledge automatically not lead to your knowledge? After all, being the same entity, we both sink and swim together. Why do we both have to separately strive for liberation? 

Best Regards
Kalyan

 If you knew that, Kalyan, you
 should agree that this comes much later, rather than
 sooner. And if you think this list forms a coterie that
 excludes you, the decision about what comes next is
 yours.

 I knew you would warn me sooner or later. This list is meant
 for a coterie of a few. A mutual admiration society, I
 should say. If somebody does not fall in line, he or she is
 out.



 Now do whatever you want to do as the moderator.

 Kalyan

 Kalyan, I have a two part

 answer for you. The first is as an individual responding
 to

 you. The second is as a moderator of this list.

 If you know yourself as nirguNa, nirviSesha, then

 you are no longer an ignoramus. If you know yourself as
 any

 other, then you are the biggest ignoramus. Yet, whatever

 little you know in your ignorance is only through the
 light

 of your own self. Therefore, this nirguNa nirviSesha self
 is

 described as the paraMjyoti.

 That said, watch your language and your combative

 attitude. This list does not exist to fatten
 anybody's

 ego. Over the course of several posts, it appears that
 your

 motive is to showcase how well you can get under the
 skins

 of other list members. In that case, take it elsewhere.
 It

 contradicts your professed claims of wanting to have

 productive discussions. You are trying the patience of

 almost everybody here. The moderators have mostly taken a

 benign attitude towards your posting history, but this is

 something up with which we don't have to put

 forever.

 Isn't

 the nirguNa nirvishesha Atman itself the biggest and only

 ignoramus in advaita? It beats me how such an Atman,

 wallowing in ignorance, can be described as param jyoti.

 Sayana in the bhashya to this sukta says - it

 is not any



 particular form, meaning that it is Nirguna Brahman. He

 the shruti 'param

 right knowledge. This is



 nirguna Brahman in



 Advaita. Sayana also says that this entity is the



 adhishthana for the aropita jagat. That is



 again nirguna brahman.
