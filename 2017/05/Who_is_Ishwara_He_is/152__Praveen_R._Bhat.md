If the Atman is nirguNa nirvishesha, how can he have the attribute of
ignorance?

Interestingly, Krishna uses the word Ishvara in BG 15.8


शरीरं यदवाप्नोति यच्चाप्युत्क्रामतीश्वरः । गृहीत्वैतानि संयाति
वायुर्गन्धानिवाशयात् ॥


f
or
one who attains another body, having departed from one! I wonder who this
Ishvara is for you
 and why.


Later in your mails, you go on to assert that you asked a simple question,
I would like to ask you an even simpler one. What is your understanding of
the term mithyA? Otherwise, I see that after anyone gives any reference or
answers, you simply shirk off by saying something to the effect of "I'm not
convinced" or "it doesn't answer my question". That is quite easy for
everyone else to do as well that "your question is not a question at all".
So I suggest you explain what you understand by the word mithyA in contrast
to sat and asat, if you're really interested to get an answer to the
question you posed.

Kind rgds,
