In the Br.up. Antaryami Brahmana, Shankara has identified the antaryami
with 'Narayana' and stated that it is sakshimatra (nirguna brahman).
Sureshwara while elucidating this in the Vartika has clearly said that the
'antaryami' of the Vedanta can be anyone: Brahma, Vishnu or Shiva.

It should also be remembered that Shankara in the Kenopanishad pada bhashya
identified Umapati as 'sarvajna Ishwara.' In this very Kena bhashya he has
very clearly stated that if the Brahman is any formed entity like Vishnu,
Ishwara, Indra, Prajapati, that is, upasya, as 'different from the upasaka'
 it will have to be a-brahma and anātma. He concludes that the Kena 1.5 is
specifically aimed at warding off any entity other than the aspirant's true
self as Brahman.  This is nothing but Nirguna Brahman.
