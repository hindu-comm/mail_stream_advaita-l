Namaste

I have attended this program a couple of times and have found it very
interesting. The Trust is doing a very sincere job for the last 7 years in
conducting this program with a huge spending. I would recommend people to
attend this program which is free and even lunch is served. It is
everywhere Veda, Sanskrit, etc. sattva.
