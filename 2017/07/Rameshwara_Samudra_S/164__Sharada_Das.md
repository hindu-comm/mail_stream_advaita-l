Sri Gurubhyo namah:

Firstly i apologize for sending a query which is not directly related to
focal point of the group subject. However i searched the internet and didnt
find aything substantial related to this. I would like to know the
procedure (sankalpa etc) for performing samudra snana in Rameshwaram as I
am going there in a couple of weeks. Are they any dos/donts regarding this ?
Anyone who know may please reply to me directly so as to not spam the group
with these unrelated messages.

Regards
