Namaste Subrahmanianji,
Thank you for providing various references. But then it's all about how we interpret/understand it. For eg, how do we interpret 'Jagat karanam Achyutam' .
And thanks for the links. Interesting development in Advaita and it's rival schools over the centuries. And also, if I may ask, is there anyone today who is considered as self-realized like Adi Shankara?
