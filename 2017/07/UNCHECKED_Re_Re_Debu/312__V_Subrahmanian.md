Namaste

You have demonstrated well what you have claimed above प्रतिज्ञा.
It is perhaps because of this precise and concise way of teaching the
sādhya (advaitam brahma) and the sādhana (the three states) that this
Mānḍūkya Upaniṣat is extolled in the Muktikā upaniṣad as:
माण्डूक्यमेकमेवालं मुमुक्षूणां विमुक्तये (The sole Mānḍūkya upaniṣad alone
is sufficient for the mumukṣus to attain mokṣa).
