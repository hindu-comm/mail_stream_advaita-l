In the following URL, there is a passage of Brahmanandi, the commnetary of
the Advaitasiddhi:

quote:

//ityādiśruteḥ bhūtatvāvaccedena brahmajanyatvanāśyatvakalpane
lāghavāt *abhautika
vaikuṇṭhaloke mānābhāvāt* anāditvena
śrutiyuktisiddhamāyādibhinnajaḍatvāvaccedena lāghavāt brahmopādānakatvāt
sopādānakamātrasyāvidyakatvenāvidyānāśyatvāt jaḍasāmānyasya
vināśitvamityuktavākyasthaṃ nityādipadamavāntarapralayasthaparamiti bhāvaḥ ।
Purport (for the last paragraph above): The cited shrutivAkya-s show that
the limitation of (i.e., notion of/characterisation as) “bhUta”, while
associating naturally (lAghavAt) with the creation and destruction of the
universe from Brahman, cannot be considered to exist/associated with (
mAnAbhAvAt) the Vaikuntha worlds that are abhautika (not of the nature of
bhUta-s). Hence, their eternality is declared. But this is just like the
eternality of avidyA, which shruti also declares in the statement “
gauranAdyantavatI” (quoted by Madhusudana in the immediately preceding
lines). However, since even these Vaikuntha worlds are also avidyAtmaka,
they cease along with avidyA after Nirguna Brahman realisation.

(Laghucandrika, from the same source as above)

It is amusing to see desperate ones mistranslating “abhautikavaikuNThaloke
mAnAbhAvAt” as “pramANAbhAvAt” i.e., there is no pramANa for abhautika
vaikuNTha loka.//

Your attention is drawn to this highlighted portion (hetu):
*abhautika vaikuṇṭhaloke mānābhāvāt.   *(the parsing of the samasa:
abhautikavaikunthaloka)
