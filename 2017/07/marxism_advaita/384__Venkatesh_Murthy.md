If someone is a Marxist it means he does not believe in God and he does not
follow Sanatana Dharma. He is like a foreigner and outside Varnashrama.
Therefore he can study books like Avadhuta Gita, Ashtavakra Gita, Yoga
Vasishtha, Adhyatma Ramayana and so on and get Advaita Knowledge. He should
not study Upanishads because they are a part of Vedas. But he can read
translations and attend lectures in English and local languages.
