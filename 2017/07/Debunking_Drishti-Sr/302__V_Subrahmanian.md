There is simply no empirical evidence present for those who think so are
only deluded and have no understanding of the Vedanta shāstra. With
misguided and malicious intent such people come up with ideas that have no
basis in the Vedanta.

Shankara has himself followed only logic that is shruti-friendly.
shrutyanugrihīta tarka is his forte. So all the above observations simply
lose their punch.

Khyāti vāda is only how various schools account for the bhrama experience.
Anirvachaniya khyati is also based on pure logic of the superimposed object
is neither sat nor asat and hence anirvachaniya. Shruti does not come into
the khyati vada. Even bauddha has a khyati for him. So, people of the likes
of Modi can never succeed in breaching the sampradaya.
