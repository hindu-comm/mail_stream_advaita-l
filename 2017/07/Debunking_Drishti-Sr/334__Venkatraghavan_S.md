Namaste Chandramouliji,
Here is an attempt at translation -
>From that (Atma) is born this creation which is an appearance, therefore I,
the supreme Atma am the creator of the world - thus, in an instant, even a
small boy can understand this truth.

Regards,
Venkatraghavan

Namaste Venkatraghavan Ji,



I will respond tomorrow to your query. Meanwhile since you have quoted  the
verse



<< "seyam prAtItikI sriShTistasmaajAtA tata: svayam | jagatkartA parAtmeti
kshaNAd balOpi budhyate" >>,



it would be of some help if you could let me know how you interpret this. A
translation would also do, if not elaboration. It could have some bearing
for my response.



Regards
