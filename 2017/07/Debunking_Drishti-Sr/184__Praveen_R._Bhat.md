Very well said, a thinking I wholeheartedly agree with.​​ This is precisely
what I indicated in my earlier post to Adityaji that SDV should land on
aikya without the dream example to stand on its two feet. I will reply to
Adityaji's objection to that separately next, as to how people are wrong to
think that DSV avoids Shruti.

Kind rgds,
