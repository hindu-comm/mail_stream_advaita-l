Wonderful. I'm sure that can be taken offline since no one here would be
interested in our friendly chats.

It has nothing to do with yogyatA but more to do with overlap. As you
said, you are completely committed to bhAShya and only bhAShya and that is
the only tradition for you. I usually quote or state an understanding
without caring for where in the tradition it has come from (since I don't
read non-traditional stuff), nor do I have great memory like you. You would
ask me a bhAShya reference which I may not have. Then how would discussion
further, unless running in circles is furthering! Yet, I learn a lot from
reading your mails which have lessened these days.

I like a win-win debate that helps manana.

Since I read in it in the context of the development of the entire thread,
while you may not have, you saw an angle that I couldn't even imagine. As
my Sanskrit teacher would say, we are all vyutpannamatis. So, even if it is
not exciting, interesting it surely is.

True, only that your perception is partial in this case since you haven't
read the thread. And also thanks for conforming to DSV by that statement.

I would add "

orthodox" to qualify the above statement to express my view. And
I'll not get into the rest of the
mail
, lest it become a
n
"
 unfriendly 
fight" :)
