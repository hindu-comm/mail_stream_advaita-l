Namaste Adityaji,

As Venkateshji already suggested, kindly go through over 200 mails
exchanged on this ​​in the recent past.
Other than that, I suggest not to learn DSV or anything for that matter
related to Vedanta from scholars' books and consider that as traditional
stance. Learn the tradition from the tradition.

I wouldn't give much consideration to a scholar's refutation of a
traditional work of Sw. Prakashananda. If the comparison is between
Bhagavatpadacharya's work and Sw. Prakashananda's, you or anyone else will
have to establish that the latter contradicts the former. Your tucchatva
example is not good enough because at one place in Mandukya, Bhashyakara
has given a tucchatva example as well. One has to understand the
perspective of the example and not jump to conclusions without merits of
the context!

Those who compare Vijnanavada and Advaita DSV have unfortunately understood
neither. To say that both have a slight difference of one agreeing with
brahman and another not is beyond ridiculous, akin to saying that there is
only a slight difference between zero and infinity!

To call DSV as one individual's subjectivity is showing one's ignorance of
DSV and more, whoever it is. It is said कामी स्वतां पश्यति। One sees what
he desires... regardless of what DSV really says.
