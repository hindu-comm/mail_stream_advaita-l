​Since Ishvara can be understood as collapsed into tvampada in DSV, in my
opinion, it can also be said that in SDV, jIvas and jagat is merged into
one Ishvara, while in DSV, jagat and Ishvara are merged into one jIva.
These different approaches lead to the same goal, earlier or later.

​their misunderstanding on DSV and say there is no Ishvara, Maya, etc, in
DSV. And many a time, there is a misunderstanding of ​Kshanika Vijnanavada
also whereby people end up comparing DSV with it. As you point out, DSV
itself need not be one flavour. Everything that is possible in SDV
vyavahAra is equally possible in DSV vyavahAra, although prAtibhAsika.
