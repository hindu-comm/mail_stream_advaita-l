Namaste,
In this light, I am trying to explore the authenticity of few books, the authorship of some celebrated personalities such as Sureshwara, the apparent contradictions between the works etc. I may never find an answer but it's kind of become a hobby so I shall pursue it.




Namaste,Very good. What about moksha - Are you not interested in it?Regards,Venkatraghavan
