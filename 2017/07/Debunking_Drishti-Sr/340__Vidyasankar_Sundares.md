There is a problem here with that attempt to find a resolution. Oftentimes,
people see a contradiction between bhAshyakAra and later vyAkhyAnakAra,
where none really exists. Yet, prima facie, there is a mutual contradiction
between two later vyAkhyAnakAras. There is also the problem of us
misunderstanding the bhAshya itself, if we keep assuming that none of the
later vyAkhyAnakAras understood the bhAshya properly. We must recognize
that the bhAshyakAra himself is neutral towards two or more alternative
explanations and we must ask ourselves whether we are reading more
difference than there is, when we examine the works of the later
vyAkhyAnakAras.

It is unclear to me what is meant by a prakriyA that has been introduced
from outside the circle of tradition. Refutation of dualistic schools was
one of the main purposes of the bhAshyas themselves. As the context of a
proposition and its refutation changes with time, the stances taken by
various later authors also shows a variety. I don't see that as a great
problem that demands resolution one way or the other. Within the
bhAshyakAra's umbrella, there is wide room for interpretations that differ
in some details and are yet each consonant with advaita siddhAnta.

Best regards,
Vidyasankar
