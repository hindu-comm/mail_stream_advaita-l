Dear Anand ji,
Agreed with the points raised in both your emails, this is my understanding

Furthermore, in the anubhUtiprakAsha, vidyAraNya uses the term "coradvAra"
(coramArga) or shortcut to refer to DSV. This implies there is a longer
route, the rAjamArga so to speak, without which a shortcut does not make
sense. Please see:

SDV, DSV, etc are prakriyAs for attaining the same result, and hence no
prakriyA is exclusive in nature nor meant for all people. I agree advanced
sAdhakas and even jIvanmuktas may find DSV suitable to view the world.
