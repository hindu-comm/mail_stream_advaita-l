If its not from Bhamati, I am not interested in Dasgupta's hypotheses.
However, I will just respond to just some points in the following.

I can use this to establish that there is EJV and not NJV,

This must be distinguished from the normal Vedanta view which holds that

I am curious if there is any defence for this critique.

Yes. Manudkya Karika says:

What does not exist in the beginning and in the end, that is so (

non-existent) even in the present.

Why are you suddenly landing on EJV? You are objecting to tucchatva, aren't
you?
I could equally ask you
 if tucchatva is not talked about but only mithyatva, how does that prove
SDV?
 This bhAShya is leading to
tucchatva
,
the only reason by 
which
it 
was quoted next.
