Apologies for wading into this conversation - I have not been following the
details of the various arguments, but could you please explain your
statement that a person who holds on to srishTa drishTi has to necessarily
come to drishTa srishTi before attaining moksha? I am not saying it is
incorrect, I am only trying to understand.

Could the order not be: 1) I see creation. 2) What I see is an appearance
3) Therefore there is no creation 4) I am all there is.

Why would there have to be an intermediary step "Whatever I see is there
because of my seeing" which would make DSV a necessary step before
culmination. Once I conclude that what is seen is an appearance, why is it
necessary to attribute an causal agent for that appearance? If no causal
agency is needed, there is no necessity for drishTa srishTi to follow
srishTa drishTi before moksha.

Thank you.

Regards,
Venkatraghavan
