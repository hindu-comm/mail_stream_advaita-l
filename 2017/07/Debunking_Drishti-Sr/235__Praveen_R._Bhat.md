It is very well within our knowledge that any understanding based on tarka

many questions to be resolved there, since there are too many views of too
many philosophers. In DSV, any question thrown is answered as svapnavat,
since the sAdhaka has no doubt of mithyAtvam of jagat. The details as to
how that is becomes irrelevant.

Bhashya specifically mentions this in advaitaprakaraNa that such sAdhakas
do not need any futher sAdhana since all stages of jnAna are attained
immediately. Those who don't get it on shravaNa need to other stages with
effort, where Karikakara and Bhashyakara use words such as "manaH
nirudhyate", "nirvRttiH", "samAdhAna/ samAdhiH", all hinting to yoga. I was
planning to write this up as a separate thread sometime, but haven't gotten
to it yet.

as talked about in Panchadashi 9th chapter! The main difference is that one
resolves any doubt that show up due to vAsanAs by the only logic that DSV
stands on, but in nirguNabrahmopAsana, it is Shruti says so, aham
brahmAsmi. That said, just as in SDV, nididhyAsana and upAsana are
possible, so too in DSV.

The translation looks okay to me, but here's my try:
यतः स्वप्रबोधात् स्वसंसारः स्वप्नवत् लीयते, [ततः] 
ब्रह्मानुभवी
 इमां दृष्टिसृष्टिं बहु मन्यते।
Since one's bondage disappears like a dream on rise of knowledge of the
self, [therefore] the enlightened considers this DSV great.

In closing, I agree with most of what you said, except that there instead
of saying there is no tarka at all in DSV, I would say that there is only
one tarka needed. And I wouldn't call DSV as upAsana, since upAsana is the
term technically used when there is no jnAna of oneness, which is possible
in both cases of SDV and DSV.
