Dear Praveen ji,

The above observation is very valid and Shankara says in the Mandukya
karika 1.7:

विभूतिं प्रसवं त्वन्ये मन्यन्ते सृष्टिचिन्तकाः ।
स्वप्नमायासरूपेति सृष्टिरन्यैर्विकल्पिता ॥ ७ ॥
 भाष्यम्

विभूतिर्विस्तार ईश्वरस्य सृष्टिरिति सृष्टिचिन्तका मन्यन्ते ; न तु परमार्थ
चिन्तकानां सृष्टावादर इत्यर्थः, ‘इन्द्रो मायाभिः पुरुरूप ईयते’ (बृ. उ. २ ।
५ । १९)

श्रुतेः । न हि मायाविनं सूत्रमाकाशे निःक्षिप्य तेन सायुधमारुह्य
चक्षुर्गोचरतामतीत्य युद्धेन खण्डशश्छिन्नं पतितं पुनरुत्थितं च पश्यतां
तत्कृतमायादिसतत्त्वचिन्तायामादरो भवति । तथैवायं मायाविनः सूत्रप्रसारणसमः

मुमुक्षूणामार्याणाम् , न निष्प्रयोजनायां सृष्टावादर इत्यतः सृष्टि

The above bhashya has several far reaching effects:
1. Those who are keen on the ultimate truth, Paramartha satyam, are not
concerned about creation.
2. Those who are concerned with creation lose sight of the Paramartha
tattva. This is stated in the second sentence in the bhashyam.
3. The Supreme Mayavi, the Turiya, is the one who is not 'within' creation;
he is beyond it.
4. Therefore mumukshus are concerned about the Turiya alone and not in
creation.
5. Creation-theory is of no utility; nishprayojanam.
Thus, Shankara is clearly implying that DSV alone is the only purport of
the Vedanta. As you have observed and as Madhusudana, etc. too have stated,
DSV is the only path in Vedanta. All those who are at present considering
the SDV, an adhyaropa, as the truth, will have to eventually come to DSV,
naturally.   They may postpone the transition but can never avoid it. There
are no 'this or that' alternative in Vedanta; it is 'only DSV' as the
ultimate path.
