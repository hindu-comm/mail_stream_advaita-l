An advaita sadhaka, by default, will have to go through the eka jiva vada
prkriya alone, before arriving at the destination.

There is one, among many, yukti-s that is available in the Shankara
bhashyam for this:

Br.up.5.1 Bhashya:

अथैवं सति तदौदासीन्यस्वरूपावस्थाने फले प्राप्ते शास्त्रस्य प्रामाण्यं प्रति
अर्थित्वं निवर्तते ; तदभावात् शास्त्रस्यापि *शास्त्रत्वं तं प्रति निवर्तत
एव* । तथा *प्रतिपुरुषं** परिसमाप्तं शास्त्रम्* इति न शास्त्रविरोधगन्धोऽपि
अस्ति,

For the aspirant who has become established in the Self, there is no more
seeking in respect of the validity of the shaastram, since the seeking is
not there, the shAstratvam of the shAstram too, *for him*, ceases. Thus, *for
each individual* the shAstram ceases to be and therefore there is no
contradiction of the shAstra.

Here the words 'tam prati', and 'pratipuruSham' show that bondage
experienced by each one consists of the whole world and all duality, and it
is his realization that frees him from this world of duality. This is the
phenomenon of eka jiva vaada that each sadhaka will have to come to at the
end of sadhana. It was he that imagined a world and it is for him the
imagination ceases.
