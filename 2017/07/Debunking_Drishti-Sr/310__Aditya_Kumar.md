So, you are only agreeing that there is no world other than perception, the core of DSV : )

A : Oh look! there is the word 'perception' innit so it's gotta be DSV. Oh, you are using dream example, so it's gotta be DSV. Sure, whatever makes you happy. But common sense and scriptures tell us that when there is perception, there is a perceiver and perceived duality.




Here exactly the subject-object duality is collapsed and advaita is established. So, this also does not help your case of driving a wedge between SDV and DSV. 

A : Drive a wedge between SDV and DSV?! What?why?


There is no difference between perception and the perceived world. In fact GK very explicitly states the world is projected by the perceiver: chitta. So, ultimately you have not made a strong case for a difference between Shankara and Madhusudana, etc.
A : Alright.
