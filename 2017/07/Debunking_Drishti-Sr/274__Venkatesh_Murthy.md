Namaste

If you listen to the Pandita Maninas scholars they are saying Vacaspati
Misra also is following Mandana Misra only and not Adi Sankara. What do you
say to that? Vacaspati Misra has accepted Jeeva as the seat of Avidyaa just
like Mandana Misra. Adi Sankara did not say that. Vacaspati Misra has
accepted many Moola Avidyaas. This is a wrong idea because Adi Sankara did
not say that. Vacaspati Misra has rejected Sravana of Maha Vakya will give
Brahma Jnana. But he is saying you have to keep on doing Manana and
Nididhyasana and then only Jnana will be the result. Adi Sankara did not
say that but it is following Mandana Misra. Holenarsipur Swami's disciples
have written books to show Vacaspati Misra is going against Sankara
Bhashyas in many places. What then?

We should not listen to these Pandita Manina scholars like Modi and
Dasgupta but we have to follow Sampradaya. Then we will get correct
picture. Scholars will have different motivation like becoming famous. If a
scholar says simply everything is fine and there is no problem in any
Bhasya he will not become famous. But if he says Madhusudana or Vivarana
Acharya is not following Adi Sankara he will become famous.

When a Teekaakaara is writing something he has to add something to the
Guru's Bhashya to make it clear. He has to correct mistakes in the Bhashya.
He has to explain in better way. When he is doing this some silly people
will think he is changing and writing against the Bhashya. This is a wrong
opinion.
