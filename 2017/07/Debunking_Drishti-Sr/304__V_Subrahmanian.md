Where has Shankara said the above? How do you link the above to Shankara's
Advaita.  On the other hand Shankara has said in the Mandukya bhashya
beginning:

यस्य द्वैतप्रपञ्चस्योपशमे अद्वैतप्रतिपत्तिः रज्ज्वामिव सर्पादिविकल्पोपशमे
रज्जुतत्त्वप्रतिपत्तिः, तस्य द्वैतस्य हेतुतो वैतथ्यप्रतिपादनाय द्वितीयं
प्रकरणम् ।


...The second chapter is to establish the unreality of duality through
reasoning.

In the beginning of the second chapter again Shankara says:

‘ज्ञाते द्वैतं न विद्यते’ इत्युक्तम् ‘एकमेवाद्वितीयम्’ (छा. उ. ६ । २ । १)
<http://advaitasharada.sringeri.net/display/bhashya/Chandogya?page=6&id=Ch_C06_S02_V01&hl=%E0%A4%8F%E0%A4%95%E0%A4%AE%E0%A5%87%E0%A4%B5%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%A6%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%B5%E0%A4%BF%E0%A4%A4%E0%A5%80%E0%A4%AF%E0%A4%AE%E0%A5%8D>
इत्यादिश्रुतिभ्यः । आगममात्रं तत् । तत्र उपपत्त्यापि द्वैतस्य वैतथ्यं
शक्यतेऽवधारयितुमिति द्वितीयं प्रकरणमारभ्यते — वैतथ्यमित्यादिना ।


In the first chapter with shruti base, the non-existence of duality has
been established. That was merely on the basis of the veda. The second
chapter is commenced* as even by reasoning* the unreality of dvaita can be
established.

So, there is mindful logic indulged in by Shankara. In the Advaitasiddhi
specific Advaita shruti vakyas have been discussed in detail and thus,
there is no 'indulging in mindless logic'.

Thus, the case of PM Modi is without any substance.
