Namaste,
In this light, I am trying to explore the authenticity of few books, the
authorship of some celebrated personalities such as Sureshwara, the
apparent contradictions between the works etc. I may never find an answer
but it's kind of become a hobby so I shall pursue it.


Namaste,
Very good. What about moksha - Are you not interested in it?
Regards,
Venkatraghavan
