Where has Shankara said the above? How do you link the above to Shankara's Advaita.
A : Please refer BSB 2-2-28 and 2-2-29. I have merely restated it.


On the other hand Shankara has said in the Mandukya bhashya beginning:

यस्य द्वैतप्रपञ्चस्योपशमे अद्वैतप्रतिपत्तिः रज्ज्वामिव सर्पादिविकल्पोपशमे रज्जुतत्त्वप्रतिपत्तिः, तस्य द्वैतस्य हेतुतो वैतथ्यप्रतिपादनाय द्वितीयं प्रकरणम् ।


...The second chapter is to establish the unreality of duality through reasoning.
A : Please refer verse 4,6,11,12 from Vaitathya prakararana. In this prakarana, Gaudapada is not establishing the unreality of external objects/world or internal ideas. He is saying _perception itself establishes unreality_ by using dream as an _analogy_. Put in other words, he is explaining how sad-asad-vilakshana is unreal from the absolute position as he speaks from paramartha view. He is merely elaborating on the 'indescribable nature' of the world from absolute view. Unlike other later Advaitins who reduced this concept of sad-asad-vilakshana to subjective idealism or at times unreality of external objects.Again, Asat-khyatis - External objects are unreal. Hence unreal.     Atma-khyatis - Objects are merely ideas. Hence unreal.     Vedantin/Gaudapada - Perception itself establishes unreality. This is nothing but, in paramartha, even sad-asad-vilakshana is unreal and does not remain as a separate category. 

In the beginning of the second chapter again Shankara says:

‘ज्ञाते द्वैतं न विद्यते’ इत्युक्तम् ‘एकमेवाद्वितीयम्’ (छा. उ. ६। २। १) इत्यादिश्रुतिभ्यः। आगममात्रं तत्। तत्र उपपत्त्यापि द्वैतस्य वैतथ्यं शक्यतेऽवधारयितुमिति द्वितीयं प्रकरणमारभ्यते — वैतथ्यमित्यादिना।


In the first chapter with shruti base, the non-existence of duality has been established. That was merely on the basis of the veda. The second chapter is commenced as even by reasoning the unreality of dvaita can be established.
A : Unreality of duality, not unreality of objective world. Hope you appreciate the difference.

So, there is mindful logic indulged in by Shankara. In the Advaitasiddhi specific Advaita shruti vakyas have been discussed in detail and thus, there is no 'indulging in mindless logic'. 

Thus, the case of PM Modi is without any substance.
