Dear Shri Praveenji,

>also whereby people end up comparing DSV with it. As you point out, DSV

>vyavahAra is equally possible in DSV vyavahAra, although prAtibhAsika.

SureshvarAchArya's famous and oft-quoted verse, yayA yayA bhavetpuMso
vyutpattiH pratyagAtmani| sA sAiva prakriyA GYeyA sAdhvI sA chAnavasthitA|,
leaves room for even new prakriyAs to be formed, as long as they are in
tune with the advaita tradition of Shankara. This shows that advaita need
not be a static, rigid discipline but in fact, could be a dynamic and
adaptive philosophy! This is what sets advaita apart from faith-based
systems on the one hand, where everyone follows the same path rigidly, and
new age philosophies on the other, where pretty much anything under the sun
passes as a genuine path to Nirvana.

Anand
