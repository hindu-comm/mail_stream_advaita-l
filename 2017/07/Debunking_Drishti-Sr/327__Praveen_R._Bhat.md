This is discussing only chapter ​​4 of the Panchadashi, where IshvarasRShTi
and jIvasRShTi bheda, former being vyAvahArika and the latter prAtibhAsika,
is shown in the process of viveka and what all has to be given up in the
end. I am a little lost on how does it mean that Sw. Vidyaranya never
endorsed DSV? Is the 4th chapter the only part in Anubhutiprakasha
commentary on Kaushitaki? I haven't studied the latter.
