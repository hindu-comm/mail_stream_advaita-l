Even the Kaivalyopanishad is cited in this section.

The Manisha panchakam of Shankaracharya is another source for DSV. The
Br.Up.1.4.10 and its bhashya is yet another place to study and understand
DSV.  The BSB 2.2.29 is misunderstood by you. You have not seen how
Shankara argues apparently exactly the opposite in the GK bhashya. A
westerner had even written a paper claiming that the author of the BSB and
the GKB could not be the same, based on his misunderstanding of the BSB
2.2.29 and the GKB.
