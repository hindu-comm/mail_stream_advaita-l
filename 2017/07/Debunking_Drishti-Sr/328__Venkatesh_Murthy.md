Namaste

Sri Venkatraghavan is absolutely correct. The VC is giving Satta Traividhya
for Manda Adhikaris  and giving Satta Dvaividhya for Uttama Adhikaris.
Satta Traividhyapaksho Manda Adhikarika Iti. The Uttama Adhikaris are
treating Waking and Dream States are equal. No difference. For them
Vyaharika Satta is meaningless. They are always in dream even in so called
waking state. There are now only two Sattas. Paramarthika Brahman and
Praatibhaasika of dreams.

For Manda Adhikaris the Waking is different from Dream. They have to accept
Vyavaharika Satta. There are now three - Paramarthika, Vyavaharika and
Pratibhasika.

In explaining this Panchadashi has accepted in one place Vyavaharika as
Ishwara Srushti and Pratibhasika as Jeeva Sruchti. But in DSV EJV there is
no separate Ishwara Srushti. Everything is Jeeva Srushti only. Therefore
there can be no Vyavaharika Objects in DSV EJV. This is my understanding.
