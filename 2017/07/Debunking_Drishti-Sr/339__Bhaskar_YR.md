praNAms
Hare Krishna

Can we avoid names calling in these discussions prabhuji atleast in this list ??  Pitting one against another, weighing one person over other, calling saints like Sri SSS silly etc.  It is due to this reason I always hesitate to quote Sri SSS.  IMHO, our purpose would be better served if it is subject oriented.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
