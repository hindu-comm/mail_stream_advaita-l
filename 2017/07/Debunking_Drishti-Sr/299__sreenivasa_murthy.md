Dear Sri Venkatesha Murthy,You write : "Nothing wrong in Vyaakhyaanakaara correcting and
adding explanations to Bhaashyakaara. Silly people think we should not
touch Bhashyakaara at all." Have you come across with such silly persons? What are the names, either past or present, of such silly persons?Thanking you,With respectful regards,Sreenivasa Murthy

Namaste

If you take Vyakarana Sastra there Panini is the Master. Vararuchi wrote
his Vartika but in many places he is not agreeing with Panini and in some
places he has removed Panini sutras. In some places he has corrected
Panini. In others he has explained Panini very nicely. Then Patanjali has
written Mahabhashya and in some places he has defended Panini and in some
places he has agreed with Vararuchi. That is why they say उत्तरोत्तरमुनीनां
प्रमाणम् The next Muni is more correct than previous Muni.

This is the tradition. Nothing wrong in Vyaakhyaanakaara correcting and
adding explanations to Bhaashyakaara. Silly people think we should not
touch Bhashyakaara at all.
