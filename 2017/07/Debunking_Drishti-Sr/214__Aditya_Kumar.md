True. But is there a difference between a hare's horn and a car?

Here is just one instance, of several, where the DSV is very prominently articulated: BGB 2.16
न हि शीतोष्णादि सकारणंप्रमाणैर्निरूप्यमाणंवस्तुसद्भवति। विकारो हि सः, विकारश्च व्यभिचरति। यथा घटादिसंस्थानं चक्षुषा निरूप्यमाणं मृद्व्यतिरेकेणानुपलब्धेरसत् , तथा सर्वो विकारः कारणव्यतिरेकेणानुपलब्धेरसन्। जन्मप्रध्वंसाभ्यां प्रागूर्ध्वं च अनुपलब्धेः कार्यस्य घटादेः मृदादिकारणस्य च तत्कारणव्यतिरेकेणानुपलब्धेरसत्त्वम् ॥
Shankara says: that which is grasped, objectified, by the senses is not real. That which is so grasped is a transformation and hence it does not stay forever. Before and after manifesting since it is not there apart from its cause, the object in the state of manifestation is asat.
The GK आदावने च यन्नास्ति वर्तमानेपि तत्तथा is what Shankara is implicitly stating there. This is the characteristic of DSV. pratItikAlamAtra sattvam.
