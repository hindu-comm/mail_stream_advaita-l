Thanks for your quotations, but it is not what I am looking for. You are
proving that Bhamati uses SDV, which I have no doubts about. I am looking
at a quotation where Bhamati agrees that DSV is possible but with NJV, not
with EJV. I asked my Acharyaji who confirmed this, but he couldn't quote as
to where it occurs in Bhamati, hence the question.

Kind rgds,
