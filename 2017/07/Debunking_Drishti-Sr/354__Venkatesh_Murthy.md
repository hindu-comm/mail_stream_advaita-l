Namaste
Ø    * Sri Vidya prabhuji might be of some help to us if he is free to
concentrate on this topic.  But if I am right parA bhakti in Advaita is
something different from dualistic bhakti in vaishNava saMpradAya.  Perhaps
Sri MS’s propagation of bhakti concept was from the backdrop of vaishNava
saMpradAya whereas shankara’s pro-advaitic non-dualistic bhakti.  Just
guessing anyway J *

Being a Advaita Acharya MS cannot support Dvaita type of Bhakti
of Vaishnava Sampradaya. He has supported the equation Saguna Brahma =
Nirguna Brahma = Advaita Tattva like in Sankara Kavya Prabodha Sudhaakara.
Highest Bhakti is God is not different from Bhakta. That is the Tat Tvam
Asi of the Advaitis only. Vaishnava Acharyas cannot say that. MS said that.
It is a Huge difference.
