Thank you Venkatesh ji. This is pretty much the same translation as what I
had given. The reference to Ananda in suShupti is because the author is
linking tasmAt to sushupti of sloka 49, which was the start of the
description of DSV.

Coming to Chandramouli ji's point, sloka 43 also says that for the purpose
of realising the Atma, sriShTi is talked about everywhere. Sw VidyAraNya
further says there are two kinds of srishTis  talked about - alpA and mahA.
He later links these two srishTis to the two prakriyAs, DSV and SDV.

Therefore in my view its pretty clear that what is referred to as DSV here
is DSV, not SDV. Thus the original point stays - Sw VidyAraNya endorsing
SDV in pancadashi does not invalidate his endorsement of DSV here.

Chandramouliji, you had said that according to VAsudeva Brahmendra
Sarasvati, SDV was presented as DSV by vidyAraNya.

To quote:
"Ref book page 209, adobe page 312. According to him, the
> version presented by Swami Vidyaranya is only a different interpretation
of
> SDV only and not DSV (either of the two versions) !!!"

Please can you clarify if this is his opinion or yours, because I couldn't
find a reference of him saying this at the place you mentioned.

Regards
Venkatraghavan

Namaste

I could find a Hindi Translation in the book for 9-52 -

सुषुप्ति में जो अद्वैत् आनंदरूप मैं आत्मा था उसी से यह प्रातीतिक सृष्टि
उत्पन्न हुई है इसलिये मैं स्वयं ही जगत्कर्ता परमात्मा हूँ यह तथ्य बच्चा भी
समझ सकता है ।

Only from me the Nondual and Blissful one in Sleep this Illusion is
created. Therefore I myself am the Creator of the World and God. This fact
even a child can understand immediately.
