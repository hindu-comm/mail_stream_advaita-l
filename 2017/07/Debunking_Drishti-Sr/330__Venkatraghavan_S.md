different works. In the anubhUti prakAsha he is describing DSV, in
panchadashi he is describing in SDV. The fact that he endorses SDV in
panchadashi does not invalidate his endorsement of DSV in anubhUti prakAsha.

Which was the reason I said your comment "If confirmed, then the understanding
that Swami Vidyaranya has endorsed DSV (any version) would not be correct."
is not correct based on this piece of evidence.
