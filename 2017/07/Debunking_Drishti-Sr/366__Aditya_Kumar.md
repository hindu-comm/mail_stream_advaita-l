Well, DSV is also a creation theory. Instead of God/Ishwara, the Jiva is the creator.

Namaste
DSV EJV requires guts and that is why most people cannot accept it. Here
you have to take full responsibility for creating this Illusion of the
World from your own Avidyaa. It is easy for people without courage to put
full responsibility on God and say they are like monkeys or cats hanging to
God or being carried by God. Silly people. They don't have courage to stand
up and say Yes I have created this meaningless Samsaara. Don't blame God
because even that God you have created in your dream. If you blame God you
are blaming yourself.

This is very very difficult for timid people. Therefore they run to all
types of Creation Theories and say God is the cause. They are comfortable
if some other Force is answerable for misery in the World.
