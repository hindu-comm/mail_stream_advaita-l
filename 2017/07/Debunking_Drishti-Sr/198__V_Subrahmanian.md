In the BSB 3.2.21 Shankara says:

अथ अविद्याध्यस्तो ब्रह्मण्येकस्मिन् अयं प्रपञ्चो विद्यया प्रविलाप्यत इति
ब्रूयात् , ततो ब्रह्मैव अविद्याध्यस्तप्रपञ्चप्रत्याख्यानेन आवेदयितव्यम् —
‘एकमेवाद्वितीयं ब्रह्म’ ‘तत्सत्यꣳ स आत्मा तत्त्वमसि’ (छा. उ. ६ । ८ । ७)

अविद्याध्यस्तः सकलोऽयं नामरूपप्रपञ्चः स्वप्नप्रपञ्चवत् प्रविलीयते —
अनावेदिते तु ब्रह्मणि ‘ब्रह्मविज्ञानं कुरु प्रपञ्चप्रविलयं च’ इति
शतकृत्वोऽप्युक्ते न ब्रह्मविज्ञानं प्रपञ्चप्रविलयो वा जायते । नन्वावेदिते
ब्रह्मणि तद्विज्ञानविषयः प्रपञ्चविलयविषयो वा नियोगः स्यात् ; न,

The points Shankara is making are:


   - The world is superimposed in Brahman that is unitary by / due to avidya
   - Brahman alone, by negating the world, is to be realized
   - By knowing Brahman, vidya, the vrtti, arises by itself.
   - This vidya destroys avidya
   - Thereupon the entire world superimposed by avidya, resolves like a
   dream world.
   - If Brahman is not realized, instructions such as 'realize brahman,
   resolve the world', even if given out hundreds of times, will not result in
   realization or world-resolution

Thus, there is evidence in the BSB for the world resolving due to sublation
in Brahman.



You say:

In order for it to be sublated, Maya is essential which establishes the
paramartha satya. This is the unique position of Vedanta. If maya is
accepted, then objectivity of the world need not be denied. On the other
hand, whether we accept maya or not, if we assert that world is only
subjective, it needs a positive proof. No such proof or illustration can be
given. This is the same refutation against the Buddhists.


Response:

The experience of everyone that I am in a world of duality, experience
misery, etc. is itself the undeniable positive proof for the subjectivity
of the world. The illustration of the dream-world for samsara and its
resolution upon waking is given. For Buddhists there is no eternal
substratum of Consciousness upon which the subjective world is
superimposed. That is the difference.
