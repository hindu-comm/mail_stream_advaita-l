Very well? I think not. In any case standard, normal, etc, are also
ridiculous adjectives to Vedanta. What ought to be standard or normal
cannot be defined by an onlooker or an outsider from the tradition. What is
agreed by the stalwarts of orthodox tradition such as Sw. Vidyaranya,
Appayya Dikshita, etc, cannot be said to be non-standard.

Perhaps, a better set of words to use would be "more popular". And more
popular doesn't make the less-popular wrong.
