Namaste

When we and people like SSS are sitting and reading Sankara Bhashyas in
this Century we are forgetting one thing. Direct disciples like Padmapada
heard directly from MukhaKamala of Adi Sankara. They understood better from
hearing and maybe doubt clearing from the Guru. They had this advantage but
we don't have it. We are only Likhita Paathakas. We are Adhamas in
understanding Sankara Bhaashyas.

 When there is a Conflict between SSS and Padmapada we have to choose
Padmapada only. Take Mithyaajnaana from Adhyaasa Bhaashya. . SSS saying it
is Mithyaa Jnaana and Padmapada saying Mithyaa Ajnaana and Bhaava Roopa.
Padmapada is correct. Maybe Adi Sankara told Padmapada directly.

Another mistake is People now think we can study original Bhashyas like
text books. They are not TEXTBOOKS.
