>  Too many mails on this subject line for the past ten day...not reading all in detail  :-) 

Further, many scholars like P M Modi(not the minister) opine that Madhusudana clearly deviate from Shankara, quite boldly, which can be verified by reading his works like Gudarthadipika.  Quoting P M Modi from the Introduction part of 'Siddhantabindu' English translation :-"To illustrate briefly, in Advaitsiddhi, Madhusndana has at various places differed from Sankaaracharya in his interpretation of the Brahmasutras which he has quoted. He is the only exception from among the Aeharyas of the Sankara Sehool of Vedanta, to differ from Sankara in this manner."

>  Sri MS deviates from shankara  at some places ( though not Advaita hAni from it) is also the observation made by Sri Vidyashankara Sundareshan prabhuji.  So, it is not new to the advaitins here in this list atleast :-) 

"But in the Gndharthadipika he goes further and rejeets the view of Sankara altogether whenever , he found that it was not in harmony with the Bhaktimarga of the Gita." Here the author is talking about the fact that Madhusudhana Saraswati considers Bhakti Marga as a legitimate 3rd marga other than Jnana and karma. However, Shankara and the mainstream Advaita does not consider Bhakti marga as a path in itself like Jnana and Karma.

>  Will it be possible to quote these differences with exact references..Hearing about this 3rd alternative mArga I remember the 4th rAja yOga mArga as well :-) BTW, donâ€™t you think geetaachArya himself is clear in this issue??  Lokesmin dvividhA nishTA,,jnana yOgena sAkkhyAnAM, karmayOgena yOginaam :-) Four types of bhaktA-s can be accommodated in these two mArga-s without taking bhakti as separate sAdhana for mukti.  

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
