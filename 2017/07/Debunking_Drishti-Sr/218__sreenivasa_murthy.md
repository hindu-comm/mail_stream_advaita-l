Dear Sri Aditya Kumar,
You write : "A Jnani is established in Brahman."Please permit me to slightly amend this sentence as follows :A Jnani is Brahman. brahmavit brahmaiva Bavati || 
Where is the question of being established in Brahman 
when he is Brahman / Atman itself?A mumukshu, when he realizes his intrinsic nature by shedding the adventious one the realization reveals that he was never an individual person, he is not an individual person even NOW, he will never be an indidividual person.

Thank you.With warm regards,Sreenivasa Murthy

Namaste,
A Jnani is established in Brahman. So for a Jnani, there is no creation at all. So it is Ajati - adau ante cha yennasti.....what was unreal in the beginning and end is unreal even now. So there was never a creation.
For a Mumukshu, this Anirvachaniya/Maya is inevitable. So no DSV here.
