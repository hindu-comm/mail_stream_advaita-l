Suppose in my dream, the dream me sees a dream tiger and is struck with fear. When I wake up, I should consider both dream me and dream tiger as unreal or both as real. Similarly, after realisation, both the waking me and other jivas are unreal. So there is no premise for EJV. Only Eka Brahman. So when you say - "In your imagination, only you are a sajiva jiva", you mean to say 'Brahman's imagination? or 'Aditya's' imagination?
Gaudapada makes it clear in his Karika :
3.3: “Atman may be said to be similar to akasa manifested in the forms of the jivas which may be compared to the ether enclosed in the pots”4.92: “All jivas are, by their very nature illumined from the very beginning and they are immutable in their nature”

Shankara has said this in respect of what is decisively known by pratyaksha cannot be annulled by the shruti. You are applying that to a wrong situation. Krishna in the BG has said: samshayaatma vinashyati. shraddhaavaan labhate jnanam.
A : But we know by pratyaksha that there are multitude of jivas. Between the two of us, who is a Jiva and who isn't?

In your imagination only you are a sajiva jiva and all others are nirjiva jivas. That is ekajiva vada.

Since you have not cared to do a proper research you make the above shallow claim. In the English book 'Sridakshinamurti stotram' Vol. I, published by the Sringeri Sharada Peetham, pages 217 onwards has a very detailed discussion of the Ekajivavada which is also known as the DSV. You can see a wide variety of authors/works cited there, apart from the Vedanta siddhanta muktavali.
A : Sir, how can we consider an author's independent opinion view as a proof?

It is not his opinion but the stated works that Advaita tradition considers authentic.
