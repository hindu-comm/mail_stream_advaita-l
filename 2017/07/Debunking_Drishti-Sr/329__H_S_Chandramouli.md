> My conclusion is based on the details of the prakriya given in
> Anubhutuprakasha. Verses 41-51. The details correspond to that in
> Panchadashi. Sri SVBS on book page 209 topic 329-330, first three lines
> refers. Notes on page 208 also may be referred. Three levels of satta are
> recognized in SDV while only two levels are recognized in DSV. Both in the
> prakriya referred to in Anubhutiprakasha and in Panchadashi, three levels
> of satta are recognized. Hence my conclusion.

>
> I agree Sri SVBS has not used the terms SDV/DSV by name in respect of
> Anubhutiprakasha. As explained above it is my conclusion.

>
>
> The context is explanation of DSV and SDV. DSV considers satta dvaya only.
> You are also saying the same thing

> Dream and waking together is one satta, Paramarthika is the second.
