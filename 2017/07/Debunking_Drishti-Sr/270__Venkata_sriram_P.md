................

For those who feel inclined to SDV the "tattvamasi" upadesha, with the
usual jahadajahallakShaNa directly leads to brahmajnAna. Here the "tat"pada
represents the upahita caitanya, not the shuddha caitanya as implied by
"satyaM jnAnam anantaM brahma". For those inclined to DSV/EJV the
"tattvamasi" upadesha directly leads to brahmajnAna. However, here the
"tat"pada is the anupahita caitanya or shuddha caitanya. The
jahadajahallakShaNa is applied only to the "tvam" pada.

Wonderful clarity & approach Anand-ji.  As usual, your posts end up
