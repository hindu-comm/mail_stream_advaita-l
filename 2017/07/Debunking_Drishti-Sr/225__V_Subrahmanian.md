While Shankara Bhashya itself is there for the countless instances of DSV,
you are claiming something that is not based on study under a qualified
Acharya. If you have studied the Shankara Bhashyas properly, you would not
have started this thread.

Shankara has said this in respect of what is decisively known by pratyaksha
cannot be annulled by the shruti. You are applying that to a wrong
situation. Krishna in the BG has said: samshayaatma vinashyati.

Since you have not cared to do a proper research you make the above shallow
claim. In the English book 'Sridakshinamurti stotram' Vol. I, published by
the Sringeri Sharada Peetham, pages 217 onwards has a very detailed
discussion of the Ekajivavada which is also known as the DSV. You can see a
wide variety of authors/works cited there, apart from the Vedanta siddhanta
muktavali.
