Kindly do not partially quote me, that would be to misquote me, if you did
understand what I said. To reinforce: I said that Bhamatikara agrees with
NJV DSV not EJV DSV.

No, as above, Bhamatikara agrees with one version of DSV. Even if he did
not, he is not the end of tradition and that in NO WAY means it is alien to
Shankaracharya. It is alien to whosoever's books you are reading with great
commitment against the traditional perspective. Please understand that
traditional stance is even one example of traditional Acharya stating
something is taken as supporting a view. Shankaracharya says in Mandukya
4th chapter that "anumodAmahe, we joyfully approve" Vijnanavadins approach
of refuting the reality of this world as a mere perception. Then he goes
ahead and refutes the momentariness of their consciousness. We're done
there. So no amount of selectively quoting BSB will work.

Incorrect. So many statements of Shankaracharya and Shruti itself have
been shown by many people in this very thread.

Even SDV is an interpretation.

In doing so, we have to compromise heavily.

One small instance is Tat Tvam Asi as already discussed.

Discussed incorrectly as already clarified by Chandramouliji. tattvamasi
is not the only mahAvAkya, nor is it limited to four.

Again, there's no earlier or later in tradition. If there is, it is
asmadAchArya paryantAm to each traditional student. To an
anything-goes-as-Vedanta self-styled researcher, it may not be. Thats
called ardhajaratInyAya.

So? Sureshvaracharya wrote an independent Naishkarmyasiddhi. Do you know
what is the praise reserved for MS in the sampradAya, which is not even
said about anyone else, including Bhamatikara? You should look up what is
said of the limits of his knowledge.

Madhwa's proponents are realists. But instead of saying - we have

Its his prerogative. That you or I do not understand what need was there
doesn't mean there was no need. I'd like to know if you are willing to
answer: what are your qualifications for assessing the need of MS' work(s)?

In doing so, MS essentially might have revived the almost dead Madhwa's

Assumptions and more assumptions, was that a ridiculous conclusion of one
of your researcher scholar books? Even if he did, so what? It helps manana;
each sAdhaka has to undergo the same, lest he end up in confusion like...
you will have enough to fill the gaps. dvaita stands right in the face, no
one has to teach it. Bhashyakara has no issues with several dvaita
traditions, since he says jeShyAmi sarvAn Arabhe cha chintAm, why should MS
or anyone else fear a revived dvaita sampradAya?

Please note that I am not attacking anyone personally even passively.

Oh, you are actively doing so! It may not be direct, but it is actively
being done, else I wouldn't be pulled back in the discussion.

How many orthodox traditions do you know of? Go to Kailashashram, Rishikesh
where both have been taught by the mahAmaNDaleshvara. My own Acharyaji has
studied them there. You will find many places in Kashi where it is taught.
Mani Dravid Shastriji and others in the tradition regularly teach it. These
are just some examples. Others may point out more please.
