Namaste Sri Jayakumar

I agree you have given a very nice example. Another example is if there are
10 people and they cross a river. After crossing the leader counts and
finds there only 9 people but not 10. One trustworthy person is seeing the
problem and will tell him you are counting wrong and you are 10 people.
When the leader hears him it is like Jnaana only but not Anubhava. Then he
counts 9 people and tells the leader at last  'You are the tenth'. That
last person will immediately experience he is the tenth. This is Anubhava.
When Adi Sankara is saying Anubhava it is this Anubhava.

It is not like elders telling a child Don't touch fire because it will burn
you or don't touch open electric wire because it will give you a shock. The
child should not try to get first hand experience of fire burning his hand.
That is not Anubhava. If elders tell him he should accept it as Final Jnana
only. No more Anubhava required. Many Panchatantra stories have the moral
teachings. It is not required for us to test each moral of the story and
get first hand experience. That is foolish experience.
