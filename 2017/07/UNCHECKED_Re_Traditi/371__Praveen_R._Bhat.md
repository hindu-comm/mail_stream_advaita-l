Namaste Subbuji,

​Thanks for more references.

I forgot to add one of the best works on DSV, which is the only other (than
Yoga Vasishtha) work recommended by Ramana Maharshi: Tripurarahasya.

Of course, I also forgot to list Yoga Vasishtha itself!

And Ashtavakra Gita can also be added to this list.
