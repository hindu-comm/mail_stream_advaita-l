Who are all meant by the term 'Guru'?

Someone shared this verse in a Whats App group:

सदाशिवश्च श्रीकृष्णः सविता च बृहस्पतिः।
व्यासश्च शङ्कराचार्यो गुरुशब्देन भाविताः॥

Sadāśiva, Śrīkrṣṇa, Savitā (Sūrya), Bṛhaspati, Vyāsa and Śankarāchārya are
known by the term 'Guru'.

Not sure who composed the above shloka.

//The Brahmanaspati and Brihaspati of the Vedas and the Brahma of the Hindu
Trinity are said to be the same god.//
