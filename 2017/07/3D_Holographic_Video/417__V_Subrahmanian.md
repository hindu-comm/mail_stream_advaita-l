Dear Vishwanath,

3D Hologram is a technology which enables to present a certain content in
such a way that one feels the effect of 3D while watching it. The program
that is on at Sringeri is a display of a few video clippings containing
certain events in the life of HH Sri Abhinava Vidyatirtha Swamiji
(1917-1989). It is a 20-minute show in a theater environment, in both
English and Kannada versions. Thus, there is nothing odd about the Sringeri
Jagadguru blessing it after seeing it. Let me assure you that there is no
gimmickry about it.

If you have the time and inclination, it would be worthwhile making a trip
to Sringeri and watching it, among other things like visiting the
Sharadamba temple, having darshan of the Jagadgurus, etc. Here is a sample
of the technology:
