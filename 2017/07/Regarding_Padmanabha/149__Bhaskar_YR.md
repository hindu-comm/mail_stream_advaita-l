I am afraid it would be a vast subject.  First of all to know the methodology difference (prakriya bheda) between these two schools we should know the prakriya as presented by our mUlabhAshyakAra i.e. shankarabhagavatpAda.  Then only we would be able to understand their different approach with regard to vedAntic methodology in general and nature / svrUpa of avidyA, its function, valid means or evidence to establish avidya (bhAvarUpa avidyA etc. ), to whom is the avidyA and in which aspect (vishaya), how does the avidyA will be removed, svarUpa and function of vidyA which removes avidyA, what is mOksha and and mOksha sAdhana etc. etc. in particular.  It will be a comprehensive and tedious task need to have lot of patience to do the comparative study with the basic premise of our Acharyaâ€™s prasthAna traya bhAshya.  So, IMHO, it is better to ignore those differences and concentrate on prakriya as presented by our mUlAchArya.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!

Sir,

I want to know the differences between Bhamati and Vivarana. I have a only a brief understanding of it like Avaccheda vada and pratibimba vada. But I want to grasp it fully, like what are it's implications and how consistent it is with Shankara's Advaita.

Thanks

Similarly, I think we should follow our purvAchAryas' footsteps and try to focus on decorum and rational debate, ignoring the name calling.

Yes, but unfortunately our vyAkhyAnakAra-s themselves within the Advaita tradition did not follow the footsteps of our bhAshyakAra.  There were lots of names calling with below belt comments exchanged between bhAmati and vivaraNa vyAkhyAnakAra-s while presenting their own doctrine and refuting other's.  So pity it is.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
