It is surprising that you did not find the attacks on Shankara such as 'of sinful tendencies', '“One who studied the Vedas in the shop of a Mādhyamika Buddhist” (referring to Shankara’s parama-guru Gauḍapada'' etc.
inflammatory.

I read somewhere that one of the Advaita proponent (vellaM kOnda rAmarAya kaveendra or somebody else not remembered his name but I am sure it is some Telugu name like this) compared madhva rAmAnuja to kAma, krOdha amshAvatAra in kaliyuga based on some skAnda purANa shloka.  And how can we forget the notorious maNimanjari when it comes to our AchArya nindana ??  All these fanatical abuses are nothing but  dust bin stuff only.  

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
