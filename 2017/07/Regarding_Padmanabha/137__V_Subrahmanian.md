About the Chola kings: https://jaideepprabhu.org/tag/
sri-ranganatha-swamy-temple/

 //It is worth noting that though the Cholas were Shaivites and the
squabbling between the different *matha*s had started in their time, they
continued to support all *dharmic* institutions within their realm.//

// Apparently, the shrine was moved outside the temple premises during the
reign of Kulothunga II in the early to mid 12th century but was returned to
its present location by Krishnappa Nayak in the mid-1500s.//

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kulothunga_Chola_III

//He is credited with building a number of temples, including the
Sarabeswara <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarabeswara> Temple at
Tribhuvanam in Kumbakonam <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kumbakonam> district,
Tamil Nadu, as well as the renovation and repairs to the two temples
proclaimed as tutelary deities of the Cholas, namely the Shiva
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiva> temple at Chidambaram
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chidambaram> and the Sri Ranganathaswami
Temple <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sri_Ranganathaswamy_Temple,_Srirangam>
 of Srirangam <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Srirangam>. //

There are references to the effect that for the Chola-s, both Shiva and
Vishnu were kuladeivam.
