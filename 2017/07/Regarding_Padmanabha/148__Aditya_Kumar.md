Sir,
I want to know the differences between Bhamati and Vivarana. I have a only a brief understanding of it like Avaccheda vada and pratibimba vada. But I want to grasp it fully, like what are it's implications and how consistent it is with Shankara's Advaita.
Thanks

 Similarly, I think we should follow our purvAchAryas' footsteps and try to focus on decorum and rational debate, ignoring the name calling.

Yes, but unfortunately our vyAkhyAnakAra-s themselves within the Advaita tradition did not follow the footsteps of our bhAshyakAra. There were lots of names calling with below belt comments exchanged between bhAmati and vivaraNa vyAkhyAnakAra-s while presenting their own doctrine and refuting other's. So pity it is. 

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
