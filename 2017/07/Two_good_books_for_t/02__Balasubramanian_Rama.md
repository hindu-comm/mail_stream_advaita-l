Hmm, no idea why I wrote vishvanAtha instead of vaidyanAtha. Yes, looks the
same. However, my copy says 2015 printing date inside, has a uniform
magenta color cover, not the one in the link. It also has many pages of
errata at the end. I don't know if the link sends you the first printing
and also whether it will have the errata sheets.
