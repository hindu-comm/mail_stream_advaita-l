confuses others. There is a perfect endorsement to EJV by Bhashyakara under
Mandukya Karika 4.37 so:

यथा स्वप्नः स्वप्नदृश एव सन् साधारणविद्यमानवस्तुवदवभासते, तथा
तत्कारणत्वात्साधारणविद्यमानवस्तुवदवभासनम्, न तु साधारणं विद्यमानवस्तु
स्वप्नवदेवेत्यभिप्रायः ॥
Just as dream is indeed real only for the dreamer and appears like
objective reality. So too, due to being [considered as] the cause of that
dream, waking appears like objective reality [for the waker only]. However,
commonly experienced objective world is not an existent thing, just like
dream itself; this is the idea.
