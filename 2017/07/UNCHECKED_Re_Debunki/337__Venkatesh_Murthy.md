Namaste

You are not logical at all. If Vidyaranya Swami has agreed to  EJV DSV any
where it must and should mean dream and waking are same. There cannot be
DSV EJV with dream and waking different. As a matter of fact the Anumaana
used is Jaagradavasthaa Drushti-Srushti-vatee Avasthaatvaat Svapnavat. The
Waking State has Drushti-Srushti because it is also Avasthaa like Dream.
All three states have Drushti-Srushti only. Therefore it must and should
mean Satta Dvaividhya only. There cannot be Satta Traividhya if dream and
waking are same. You are not correct to assume he said Satta Traividhya for
DSV. He cannot make such mistake any where.
