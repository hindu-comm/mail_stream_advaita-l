praNAms Sri Ananda Hudli prabhuji
Hare Krishna

Shankara himself says on (3.2.38) phalamata upapatteḥ, tasyaiva brahmaṇo vyāvahārikyāmīśitrīśitavyavibhāgāvasthāyāmayamanyaḥ svabhāvo varṇyate /.

BhAmatIkAra says, commenting on Shankara, nityaśuddhabuddhamuktasvabhāvasya brahmaṇaḥ kuta īśvaratvaṃ kutaśca phalahetutvamapītyata āha- # tasyaiva brahmaṇo vyāvahārikyāmiti # / nāsya pāramārthikaṃ rūpamāśrityaitaccintyate kintu sāṃvyavahārikam / Hence, the Ishvaratva of Brahman and His awarding the results of actions is vyAvahArika.

>  Yes, you are absolutely right prabhuji, Ishwara is the karmaphaladAta, karmAdhyaksha as long as there is bheda among, jeeva, jagat and Ishwara.  So, this bheda and due to this bheda actions (karma / kriya with katrutva / bhOktrutva) etc. can happen only in avidyA vyavahAra.  And this vyavahAra i.e. bondage, release, jeevatvaM, janana, maraNa etc. presupposes creation.  And for this creation who is responsible obviously the Ishwara who is sarvajna and sarvashakta and this is not the whims and fancies of parichinna jeeva.  Ishwara remembering his pUrva srushti creates again and again by controlling by prakruti ( dhAtA yathA pUrvamakalpayat says shruti...prakrutim svAmavashtubhya visrujaami punaH punaH says geetAchArya).  And it is in the spirit of this abhinna nimittOpadAna kAraNatvaM of brahman, ekatvaM, adviteeyatvaM of brahman, kArya-kAraNa ananyatvaM, all Upanishads spoken brahman as the cause of ether etc. 

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
