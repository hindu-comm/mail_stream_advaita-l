I had cited a bhashya passage where Shankara says that one of the purposes
of creation passages in the shruti is to teach the identity of Brahman and
Atman. Hence alone the second sutra after the first sutra instructed
'Brahman is to be enquired into'.

True. That is what Shankara says in the Mandukya bhashya that during
meditation the world is not experienced and therefore also the world is
only imagined. On this basis we can say that for the Yogi who has
experienced this non-perception of the world in repeated samadhi-s, the
experience/understanding of the illusoriness of the world is very evident,
vivid.  Of course for the aspirant given to deep enquiry, vichara, too,
such a conviction arises, owing to viveka abhyāsa and vairāgya.
