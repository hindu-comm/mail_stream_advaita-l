In the Br.up.bhāṣya Shankara has very explicitly said that the universe is
the creation of jiva, through avidyā, kāma and karma. The creation is a
result of karma for bhoga. The entire infrastructure for the karma phala
bhoga is thus a creation of the jiva. I am not able to pinpoint the bhashya
lines and would like someone to please provide the same.

This is reasonable since Brahman being nishkriya and Ishwara being
nityatrpta, there is no need for creation/creating.
