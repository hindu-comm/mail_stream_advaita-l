sAshtAnga praNAma

Respected learned members,

do animals, other than humans, have antakaraNa, or some  of it's
components?
(As per our accepted traditions, and not modern science)

In vyavahaara, we tend to assume animals don't have it. While some stories
in puraaNas speak otherwise.

Thanks in advance.
