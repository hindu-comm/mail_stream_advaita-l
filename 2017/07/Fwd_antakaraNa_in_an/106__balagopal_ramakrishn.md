Namaste Subbu Ji,
Can we say that the 'anthakaraNam' also differs in respect of its ability to reflect 'chaitanyam', like a mirror ? i.e In 'jada' the reflection medium is almost nil and in a jnAni it is the most 'sAtvic', the best possible for an embodied where the 'aatma paramaatma' aikyam is firmly established 24*7.

 Dear Sri Dinesh,

All jīva-s, by default, have the three-fold body-mind complex. The three
are: gross body (sthūla śarīram), subtle body (sūkṣma śarīram) and causal
body (kāraṇa śarīram). The antaḥkaraṇa is a component of the subtle body.
Every jiva will have all these three bodies till one attains mokṣa. Sukha
and duhkha are experienced in the antahkarana. Animals too have these
experiences.

regards
vs
