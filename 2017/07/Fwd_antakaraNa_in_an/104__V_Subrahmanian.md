Dear Sri Dinesh,

All jīva-s, by default, have the three-fold body-mind complex. The three
are: gross body (sthūla śarīram), subtle body (sūkṣma śarīram) and causal
body (kāraṇa śarīram). The antaḥkaraṇa is a component of the subtle body.
Every jiva will have all these three bodies till one attains mokṣa. Sukha
and duhkha are experienced in the antahkarana. Animals too have these
experiences.

regards
vs
