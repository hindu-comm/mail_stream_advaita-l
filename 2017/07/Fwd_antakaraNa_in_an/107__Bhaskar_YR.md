Namaste Subbu Ji,
Can we say that the 'anthakaraNam' also differs in respect of its ability to reflect 'chaitanyam', like a mirror ? i.e In 'jada' the reflection medium is almost nil and in a jnAni it is the most 'sAtvic', the best possible for an embodied where the 'aatma paramaatma' aikyam is firmly established 24*7.

Yes, there is a shruti vAkya to this effect perhaps in Itareya AraNyaka.  In this mantra it has been said that  in trees and plants antaH prajna is 'dull' when compared to animals  and in manushya it is glitteringly evident.  Because he has the special power called viveka, he strives to achieve the infinite through finite sAdhana whereas in case of others ashanApipAse evAbhi vijnAnam.  Sri Subbu prabhuji or others may pick the right mantra from shruti with more details.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
