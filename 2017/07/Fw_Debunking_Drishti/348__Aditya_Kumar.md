Namaste Praveenji,



wrt Paramartha of course. 
No, w.r.t. each other, they are sublated. And both are sublated in deep-sleep. Don't forget that and make a jump to Paramartha. Its a avasthA-traya-viveka, not paramArtha-vyavahAra vivekA that you seem to think it is.
A : We infer the three states only in the waking state. We do our sadhana in waking state, not in dream state. In dream state, we never think that 'oh waking state was unreal because now it's a dream'. This is exactly why Vyavaharika is indispensable.

No where does he say both are of the same status.
What part of "seeing dream in both states/ both are dream alone" quoted earlier from Bhashya didn't mean that both are of the same status to you?
A : That is from Paramartha view. If we consider both dreams and waking state also similar to dreams, then we should have been able to learn a new language or get moksha in dreams. Can you see the absurdity? This is what happens when we take analogies literally. From paramartha, we can say there is no duality of seer and seen and hence the world is 'like' dreams.

My response A : Again, Both refs are pointing towards paramartha.


My goodness, now I see your confusion as to calling DSV wrong: you are landing a wrong sAdhya from the right hetu! I suppose there is hope though. SDV also is pointing only to paramArtha by saying that everything is a kArya and brahmAtmA is kAraNa. DSV says everything is a perception, I, brahmAtmA am the only existent truth. Somehow, you didn't make that jump with SDV, but easily made the jump with DSV prakriyA, thereby proving that DSV is a shortcut method insisted by everyone here!
Thanks, I'm done with that. om tat sat
A : No compulsions.
