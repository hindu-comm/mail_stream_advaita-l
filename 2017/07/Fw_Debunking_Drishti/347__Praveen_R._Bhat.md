I'll not respond to the earlier elaboration of yours, which is just a
repetition of your previous post disregarding the reference of Bhashya and
Tika I had given.

No, w.r.t. each other, they are sublated.​ And both are sublated in
deep-sleep. Don't forget that and make a jump to Paramartha. Its a
avasthA-traya-viveka, not paramArtha-vyavahAra vivekA that you seem to
think it is.

What part of "​seeing dream in both states/ both are dream alone"​ quoted
earlier from Bhashya didn't mean that both are of the same status to you?


*My response A* : Again, Both refs are pointing towards paramartha.

​SDV also is pointing only to paramArtha by saying that everything is a
kArya and brahmAtmA is kAraNa. DSV says everything is a perception, I,
brahmAtmA am the only existent truth. Somehow, you didn't make that jump
with SDV, but easily made the jump with DSV prakriyA, thereby proving that
DSV is a shortcut method insisted by everyone here!

Thanks, I'm done with that. om tat sat
