Both are equally valid on what your tilt of mind is; the first for an SDV
follower and 2nd for the DSV. The former merges all the vyaShTis into the
samaShTi and the latter the samaShTi into a single vyaShTi who is himself.

In either case, the individual is equated with the projector.

That is in SDV, which is perfectly fine. One sees the creation as created
by Ishvara and finds oneself a tiny insignificant part 
of it. With the help of shAstra and the guru, one realises that although
the functionalities are different between Ishvara and himself, they are
only upAdhikRta, caused by adjuncts. When these are dropped on both sides,
one's essence is no different from the essence of Ishvara. One doesn't have
to think that he is the projector of the universe, but he is in essence
non-different from the projector Ishvara.

The limitations of vocabulary indicated were for questioning and finding
faults with each statement. Such "faults" can be found within Shruti
itself, let alone in verbose discussions and debates online. One has to
understand the tAtparya of the discussion before just throwing some random
high-flying lines which almost ridicule those having the discussion; the
choice can instead always be to stay out of uninteresting discussions and
remain in one's niSHThA, if that.

Kind rgds,
