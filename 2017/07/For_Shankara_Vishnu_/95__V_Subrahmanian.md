The 'itthambhāva tṛtīyā' that I have mentioned here is actually found in
the Bhāgavatam itself, in this very context:

०२१००४४१ इत्थम्भावेन कथितो भगवान्भगवत्तमः
०२१००४४३ नेत्थम्भावेन हि परं द्रष्टुमर्हन्ति सूरयः

Meaning as per Sridhara Swamin: (After saying 'brahmarūpeṇa,

viṣṇurūpeṇa and rudrarūpeṇa) he says:

इत्थंभावेन = स्रष्टृत्वादिरूपेण ’तस्माद्वा एतस्मादात्मन आकाशः
सम्भूतः’, ’सोऽकामयत

बहु स्यां प्रजायेय’ इत्यादिश्रुत्या कथितः । सूरयस्तु परं केवलं
एवंरूपेण द्रष्टुं नार्हन्ति ।

[The shruti teaches Brahman as endowed with the functions of

creation, etc. through the passages 'From Brahman ākāśa emerged',

'It desired, deliberated, let me become many and be born as

many'. However, Knowers of Brahman, Jnanis, cannot perceive

Brahman in this form.]

It is after this verse the Bhagavatam says that the teaching

of Brahman as creator, etc. is only with a view to negate it later.

Thus, the itthambhāve tṛtīyā, a form of the instrumental case,

 is found used in that very sense in the Srimadbhāgavatam: Brahman

as Brahmā,as Vishnu and as Rudra.

Om Tat Sat
