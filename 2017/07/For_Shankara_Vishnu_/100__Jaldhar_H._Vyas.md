See what I mean?  You haven't actually engaged with anything I wrote. 
Instead you just quote a mantra whose meaning is indeed clear to me 
(Though not necessarily to others on the list.  Did you think of them?) 
but does not seem to be relevant to anything previously discussed.

As per Sitarama Shastri's translation:

"If one knows (that) here, then there is truth.  If one knows not (that) 
here, there will be great loss.  The wise, seeing the one Atman in all 
created things, having turned away from this world, become immortal."

It's about sannyasa.  How does that relate to discussion about the 
relative positions of Shiva and Vishnu?

Look, many members are content to remain silent and read.  I don't think 
that is the best policy but I understand it.  Others are willing to jump 
in and discuss with each other.  That I understand too.  But to just talk 
to yourself?  What is the point of that?
