Dear Sri Venkat ji,

A brilliant post covering several nyāya concepts as well. With regard to
akhaṇḍarthatā, there is an example given in the Vāsudeva-mananam, an
Advaitic work:

The flame of a lamp is red, hot and bright: raktam, uṣṇam and prakāśa. We
cannot say that one part of the flame has some of these and the other parts
have the rest. All these are there everywhere in the flame.  Without any of
these there is no flame at all. Similarly satyam, jnanam and
anantam/anandam are verily Brahman. That is why Shankara in the Taittiriya
bhāṣyam says: satyam brahma, jnānam brahma and anantam brahma.

warm regards
subbu
