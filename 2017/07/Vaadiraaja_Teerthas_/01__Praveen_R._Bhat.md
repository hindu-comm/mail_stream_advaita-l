Incorrect. This is precisely why I say that mithyA is hugely misunderstood
by dvaitins.​ It the world is mithyA, how do you say that AV says brahman
is different from the world?

We say that world is sadasadbhyAm anirvachanIyam, which is not to say that
we are agreeable​ to brahman being different from the world. It is not sat
is only 1/4th the agreement, what about the other 3/4th to complete the
understanding?

​The nature of the world is what leads to a conclusion as whether it is
same, different or something other than same and/or different.​

​The other way round would mean that Dvaitins postulate the difference
based on perceived world's existence​. Then you have erred into our pakSha
which says that Shruti is not a pramANa for establishing difference, which
is what you objected to!

​Precisely so, the world is pratyakSha, but its real existence is not​.
brahman is known through Shruti, but its difference with the jIva is not.

If you agree that an atheist will agree to difference between this world
(which includes himself)​ from brahman, congratulations, you have erred
into our pakSha again. An atheist has also landed into duality without
Shruti pramANa, which proves that Shruti is not a pramANa for dvaita, but
for advaita.

A fictitious concept is as good as not having such a concept. Even such a
person agrees with duality. So Shruti brings him nothing new and therefore,
it is not a pramANa for bheda. Again you are proving our pakSha alone.

All types of bhedas are landed into by the atheist without Shruti, existent
or non-existent.

​Oh, for this viShama udhAraNa, I have to invoke Dvaitin's misunderstanding
of mithyA again! That we do not summon a vandhyAputra for murder case does
not prove that we cannot invite a dream murder-witness for a dream-murder
in dream where the accused wakes up as free from all false cases!

mithyA ajnAna can be removed only by mithyA jnAna. The dreamer chased by
the dream lion wakes up the scared sweating waker who was never in the
forest, but yet knows himself to be non-different from the dreamer who was
in the forest. The waker and dreamer are the same individual whose
knowledge includes the dreamer, dreaming, dream world including the dream
lion and forest. This is why the dream veda is evidence for brahmajnAna
since the Veda is nothing but knowledge of the same entity who is waking
into brahmajnAna by his own knowledge which is in the form of Veda. If your
knowledge is not pramANa for you, then you should be seeing, etc, through
someone else's sight, etc.

​I do not know how you treat asat vastus, since I have never treated any
atyanta asat vastu.​

​No, sorry, it doesn't. Its a non-example example or at best, another
viShama udhAraNa.​

​The vandhyAputra cannot apply for a PAN card. One who applied with false
documents is an existent person and so are the documents existent. ​The
authority doesn't make a differentiation between the non-existent person
who didn't apply and another existent who applied, but on the merits of the
existent documents of both sorts of people. So either he issues one card
only if vandhAputra's documents are known to be falsified or two cards if
documents seem valid, not issue two or not at all.

I do not know which govt department have you dealt with, since I have come
across officers that say "your documents are insufficient", but not "you do
not exist". :)
