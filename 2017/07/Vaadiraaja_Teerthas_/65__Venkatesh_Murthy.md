Namaste

True Narayanam Maha Jneyam is there in Sruti but Sruti also has Na Drushter
Drashtaram Pashyeh and Na Vijnater Vijnataram Vijaniyah and so on. You
cannot see the witness of Vision. You cannot know the Knower of Knowledge.
What should we do? One is Saguna Brahma and another Nirguna Brahma.

God is Yogibhir Dhyana Gamyam. The Yogis see Him in meditation. But He is
the Saguna form with Sankha Cakra Gada Padma. Anything with Gunas can be
seen. How can we see Brahman with no Gunas? That is the True Narayana. We
cannot see Him.
