Even in prayOga  'so'yam devadattaḥ' , the pada "dEvadattha" should refer
to the anuyOgi by its mukhyArtha if the intension for the identity has to
make sense.

Btw, jahadajahallakshana (which is quite unique to AV only and none others
accepts it) is used for aikya in identity statement. It is not used as
mukhyArtha vs.lakshyArtha point of view of a pada used.
