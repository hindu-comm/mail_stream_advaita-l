No problem. Drashta means Brahman only. The same Brahman has become a Jeeva
because of His own Avidyaa. If objection is how can Brahman have Avidyaa it
is said the Avidyaa is not real. The Brahman becoming Jeeva is also a
Vivarta like Brahman becoming the World. It is not Parinaama like Mud
becoming Pot but Vivarta like Rope becoming Snake.

Suddha Brahman cannot be Drashta also because Drashta means there is a
Drushya Vastu otherwise what will Drashta see? There will be Druk Drushya
Duality.
