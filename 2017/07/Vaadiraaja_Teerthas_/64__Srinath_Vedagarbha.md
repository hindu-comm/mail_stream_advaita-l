Shruti would not have said nArAyaNaM maha jnEyaM if it supports your
position. You can reconcile this if you think Narayana is other than
Brahman, but that would make you go against Shanakara!

Your understanding goes against shruti again;

'tad Eva brahma paramaM kavInAm' says maha-narayana upanishad. The shruti
would not have used 'tat' pada to denote Brahman if what you are saying is
correct.
