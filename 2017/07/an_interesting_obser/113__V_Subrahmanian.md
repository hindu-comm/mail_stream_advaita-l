Sāyaṇa has given a famous etymological verse from a purana:

"*आपो नारा इति प्रोक्ताः* आपो वै नरसूनवः । अयनं तस्य ताः प्रोक्तास्तेन
नारायणः स्मृतः" and says that he who rests in the pancha bhuta-s. Or, he is
beyond prakrti and from Him the world has emerged.

He also says 'नारायणः पर एवात्मा, न तु अपरो मूर्तिविशेषः ।’ ’Narayana is
the Supreme Atman and not the apara= inferior formed one.

In the Advaitasiddhi commentary, Brahmananda says: in the Mahopanishat
passage 'एको नारायणः..’, the 'Nārāyaṇa' there is 'chinmātra in association
with māyā.'  Pure Consciousness with maya upadhi.
