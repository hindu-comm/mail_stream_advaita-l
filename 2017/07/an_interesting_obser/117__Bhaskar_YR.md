Namaste

If only Naama and not Bhaava will grant Mukti even a Mleccha can say Naaraayana on his death bed and go to Vaikuntha. But it is not like this.
Ajamila was a good Brahmin earlier. He was following his Dharma properly.
But one day he saw in the forest one beautiful prostitute was having sex.
His mind got disturbed and he fell down from his Brahmin duties and went to the prostitute. Then his life was spent with her and on the death bed he called his son Narayana. Because he called out 'Narayana' and he had also good Samskaaras earlier the Vishnu Dootas took him to Vaikuntha.

Thanks for the clarification.  A patita (fallen)  brahmaNa is no more a brAhmaNa according to shAstra he is mere 'brAhmaNa bandhu' says shankara somewhere.  Let that be aside, now the doubt is,  if the erstwhile 'good' ( good here means following his svadharma ) mleccha remembers god's name at the death bed, will he be granted the mukti??  Or else is this the whole and sole property of ONLY brahmaNa (as a varNa)  irrespective of his past history ??

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
