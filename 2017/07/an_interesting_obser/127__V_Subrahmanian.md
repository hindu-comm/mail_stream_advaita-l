The Bhāgavatam 4.4.14 has a verse spoken by Sati, Shiva's consort, to her
father, Daksha Prajapati:


यद्द्व्यक्षरं नाम गिरेरितं नृणां
सकृत्प्रसङ्गादघमाशु हन्ति तत् ।
पवित्रकीर्तिं तमलङ्घ्यशासनं
भवानहो द्वेष्टि शिवं शिवेतरः ॥१४॥

The two-lettered name of 'Shi-va' even if uttered just once amidst common
talk would quickly free one from sin.

There is a famous verse about the uttering the name 'vishnu':

मूर्खो वदति विष्णाय विद्वान् वदति विष्णवे।
उभयोः सदृशं पुण्यं भावग्राही जनार्दनः।।


Not knowing the correct form, one utters 'viṣṇāya' while a learned man says
'viṣṇave'. Both attain the same merit, for the Lord is pleased by the bhāva
rather than the uttered word.
