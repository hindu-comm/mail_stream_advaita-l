sAshtAnga praNAms Sri Vyas prabhuji
Hare Krishna

The moral is that the names of Bhagavan (all of them not just  Narayana) have power even when spoken unconsciously.  

>  bhagavAn is sarva nAma vAchya.  And I read somewhere that each and every word in shruti and smruti denoting brahman only.  And vishNu is aNu, bruhat, krusha, sthoola etc. as well.  If that is the case,  remembering any name or any object without bhAva ( or unconsciously) would give us the mOksha or nArAyaNa sAyujya !!  Is this not something a complicated approach in bhakti mArga??  Kindly clarify prabhuji.

Your humble servant
Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
