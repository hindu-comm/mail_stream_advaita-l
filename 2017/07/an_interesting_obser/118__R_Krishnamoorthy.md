The name of the divine is more powerful than the divine is our belief. The
sloka I quote "Harir harathi papani dhushta Chithair api smrutha
:Anichayapi samsprushtum dhahathyeva hi pavaka :" This says that just like
fire who ever touches even unintentionally does burn the nama of the Lord
even uttered by bad minded ones will prove beneficial to that person. R.
Krishnamoorthy.

good Samskaaras earlier the Vishnu Dootas took him to Vaikuntha.

brAhmaNa according to shAstra he is mere 'brAhmaNa bandhu' says shankara
somewhere.  Let that be aside, now the doubt is,  if the erstwhile 'good' (
good here means following his svadharma ) mleccha remembers god's name at
the death bed, will he be granted the mukti??  Or else is this the whole
and sole property of ONLY brahmaNa (as a varNa)  irrespective of his past
history ??
