Namaste
The mind must play a role here otherwise we can make a computer to say Hari
Hari in the background we are doing Sravana of Bhagavan Naama and we expect
to go to Vaikuntha. That will not work. No body can unconsciously get
Moksha. Minimum requirement is Mind must be devoted to God. If you see
Gayatri Japa they say you have to do Mental Japa. Why? Because if you do
loud Japa your Mind will give responsibility of Japa to the Tongue and Mind
will wander to some other thoughts like family matters, money matters and
so on. Gayatri Japa will be on Tongue but Mind will be thinking totally
different thoughts.  In Mental Japa Mind cannot run away like that.

If Mind is devoted and sometimes there is a mistake it is alright. But
saying mechanical Japa with no role played by Mind will fetch Moksha is
ridiculous. Mind must be towards God also. All this Naama Japa comes under
Upaasana. In Upaasana Mind must be there. We cannot ignore Mind. That is
why they to say to atheists question 'Show me where is God?' the answer 'He
is in devotee's Mind'. The Mind is the Universe and it has everything. If
it wants it can be interested in worldly life or turn to God.
