Namaste

If only Naama and not Bhaava will grant Mukti even a Mleccha can say
Naaraayana on his death bed and go to Vaikuntha. But it is not like this.
Ajamila was a good Brahmin earlier. He was following his Dharma properly.
But one day he saw in the forest one beautiful prostitute was having sex.
His mind got disturbed and he fell down from his Brahmin duties and went to
the prostitute. Then his life was spent with her and on the death bed he
called his son Narayana. Because he called out 'Narayana' and he had also
good Samskaaras earlier the Vishnu Dootas took him to Vaikuntha.
