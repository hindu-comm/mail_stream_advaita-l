Namaste

In 2-2-42 Sutra Bhashya Adi Sankara has agreed Narayana is the Supreme.
Gaudapada also worshipped Narayana in Badari forest. Mahabharata begins
with Narayanam Namaskrutya Naram Caiva Narottamam. Therefore  Narayana of
the Narayana Sukta is the Para Brahman because He is approved by our
Acharyas, the Smruti-Itihasa-Puranas and Sruti.

Vaishnavas may say only Vishnu is Narayana but Saivas will argue like this.

Narayana word has to be examined. What is Narayana?

There are two ways.

नारायणपदेन नराणां समूहः अयनं यस्येति विग्रहम्

The Place of Refuge of Men or Naraaha is Narayana.

Or

अथवा न विद्यते राः धनं यस्य स अराः निर्धन इति यावत् । स निर्धनो न
भवतीति नाराः धनाधिपः कुबेर इत्यर्थः । तं सख्येन अणयति संलपतीति नारायण
इति व्युत्पत्तिमाश्रित्य शिव एव गृह्यते ।

Raa is wealth and Araa is poor person. Naaraa is not poor person. This
means he is Lord of Wealth Kubera. He is talking Anayati to Kubera as
a friend. Therefore He is Narayana. He is Siva only. This is the
meaning.

Siva and Kubera are friends because one name of Kubera is Sivasakha.
