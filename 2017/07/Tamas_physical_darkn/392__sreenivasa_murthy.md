Dear friends, Who is the seer of the tamas? A serious and sincere student of Vedanta who is a mumukshushould direct his attention to the SEER and never to the SEEN. "AtmasaMsthaM manaH kRutvA" so says Bhagavadgita. Why not we heed to this advise of the LORD? Any amount of discussion on the seen is a futile excercise and and waste of time for a mumukshu who has thirst to know his true nature. 

With respectful namaskars,Sreenivasa Murthy
