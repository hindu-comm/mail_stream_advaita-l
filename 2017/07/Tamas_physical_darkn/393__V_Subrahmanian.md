Sir,

What you say is absolutely true. Yet, the Bhagavadgita for example teaches
the kshetram, the seen, as the reference point for the knowledge of
kshetrajna, the seer. The Vedanta Brahman/Atman is devoid of any attribute
 and that makes the task of the Shruti very difficult. So, it devises the
method of teaching the seer-seen connection to teach the aspirant to focus
on the seer and identify himself with that. Of course the process includes
rejecting the seen as unreal, neti neti.
