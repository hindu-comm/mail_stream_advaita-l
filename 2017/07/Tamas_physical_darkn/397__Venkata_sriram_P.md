Tamas, physical darkness, is a positive object

In त्रिपाद् विभूति माहानारायणोपनिषद्, vide 4th अध्याय​, the 'tamas' has been defined as:
"तमश्शब्देन अविद्या".

So, one who believe that 'अविद्या' is bhAva-rUpa, then for them the तमस् is also bhAva-rUpa.

The link to this wonderful upanishad is below:

This is a wonderful upanishad that gives out the 'nArAyaNa' tattva from advaitic perspective.

This also details our a secret yantra and mantra of 'tripAd-vibhuta-mahAnArAyaNa' which is 
installed in the temple of Satya Narayana Swamy in Annavaram, East Godavari District.

At the bindu sthAna of this yantra, a pillar stand out and on the top of it, are installed
the deities Hiranyagarbha, Shiva, Satyanarayana with Rama Devi.  

The speciality here is the vigraha is त्रिमूर्त्यामक​ (hari-hara-hiranyagarbha).

sriram
