PraNAms
The theory of colors is that when white light falls on an object - it looks red only because all colors except red are absorbed by the object (not eyes) and the only red color is reflected. Similarly, an object looks blue only because except blue all colors are absorbed. It looks white since no color of the VIBGAR are absorbed and it looks black when all seven colors are absorbed by the object and It looks transparent when all colors are transmitted without absorption.

Namaste All,

I have a doubt regarding darkness being considered as objective existence
and request scholars to help me to understand.

If we say , since darkness is black hence we consider as positive object,
does it not contradict the science behind it.

As we understand , it is well known that the nerves in the eyes absorb the
colour of an object entering into them, therefore, the object appears in
that colour.
Since all the colours are present in the sunlight and all of them are
absorbed by the nerves, sunlight appears colourless.

In darkness there is no colour to be absorbed by the nerves, the darkness
appears black and blackness is not a different colour and it is only
absence of all colours. The eyes get darkness only because there is no work
to be done by them, also if blackness of the darkness been another existent
colour, the eyes would have to be doing the job of seeing it, hence the
eyes would have had no rest.

Therefore, how can we say darkness has a objective existence.

Regards
Ramachandra
