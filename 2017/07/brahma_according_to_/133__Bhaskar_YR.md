As you can wait for more scholarly replies on a cursory note we can understand that 'akshara' is the synonym used for mAya as well like prakruti, vaishNavi mAya, mUla prakruti, avyakta.  For example etasminnu khalvakshare gArgyAkAsha Otashcha prOtashcha.  And the akshara purusha is brahman who has this potency (Shakti) if we consider this shakti as upAdhi vishesha (sOpAdhika) than that upAdhi vishesha akshara brahman can be considered as inferior to upAdhi rahita (nirupAdhika) upanishad purusha i.e. uttama purusha.  And in some placed this akshara purusha is depicted as mahattattva, hiraNya garbha, prathamaja, prajaapati brahma etc. And as we know the brahman which we know through upAdhi is not an ultimate brahman.  I reckon from this background if we approach below shloka-s, there will not be much confusion or controversies.  

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!

- So according to Gita, "brahma" is NOT the ULTIMATE TRUTH. This place is
  reserved for "puruSottama" / "uttama puruSa".
