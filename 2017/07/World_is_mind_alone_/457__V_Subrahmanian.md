Dear Sada ji,

The vijnanavādin does not hold an eternal non-changing entity apart from
the momentary consciousness. On the other hand, the Vedantin holds the mind
to be a viṣaya, object, to the Atman, the kshetrajna. Shankara is alluding
to everyone's everyday experience of the mind, not the Atman, being
observed to wake up and go into sleep mode. In fact that is the basis of
the avasthātraya viveka. Hence the above objection does not stand. Also
Shankara has stated that an appearance cannot appear without a basis, the
adhishthanam. Hence apart from the vijnanavada, even the shunyavada has
been refuted:


Mandukya 7th mantra:

सर्वशब्दप्रवृत्तिनिमित्तशून्यत्वात्तस्य शब्दानभिधेयत्वमिति
विशेषप्रतिषेधेनैव तुरीयं निर्दिदिक्षति । शून्यमेव तर्हि ; तन्न,
मिथ्याविकल्पस्य निर्निमित्तत्वानुपपत्तेः ; न हि
रजतसर्पपुरुषमृगतृष्णिकादिविकल्पाः शुक्तिकारज्जुस्थाणूषरादिव्यतिरेकेण
अवस्त्वास्पदाः शक्याः कल्पयितुम् ।

No, actually the verse says 'the world is the mind of the cosmic person'.
Shankara is helping us understand that by citing our own experience. Thus,
what is applicable to the cosmic person is applicable to the individual
too. That is the purport and purpose of Shankara alluding to the
individual. Neither the verse nor Shankara even suggest that 'there is no
cosmic person apart from the cosmic mind which is the world'.  The cosmic
person, the Consciousness, has his own cosmic mind, which is the world, as
a viṣaya, object for him. This same phenomenon is present with respect to
the individual also. The eternal unchanging viṣayi is different from the
vishaya that is changing.

The need is there for helping the aspirant appreciate that the situation is
so even in the case of the individual. It is only with a view to help
understand and appreciate Shankara's remark in the Mundaka bhashya I cited
the Mandukya bhashya passages too:  //Therefore it stands established that
dvaita (dvaita prapancha) is only a mental concoction.//
