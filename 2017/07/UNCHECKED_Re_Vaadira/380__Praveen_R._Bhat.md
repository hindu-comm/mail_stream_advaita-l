Namaste Venkateshji,

Sorry for top-posting, but refuting each and every ridiculous argument
doesn't seem worth the effort.

Vadiraja has shown misunderstanding or his skills in misrepresenting and
using kapaTa by means of presenting filthy examples to dismiss by shock yet
again!

​That jIva is considered jaDa in EJV the first mistake​, its all downhill
from there.

​The "utility of waking people and objects" argument to prove its reality
is dismissed in Mandukya Karika's vaitathyaprakaraNa​ by saying that there
is vaishamya in dvaitin's comparison in waking vs dream examples.

The argument of using EJV example that show mithyAtva of waking by
comparison with dream and turning it around on EJV to prove reality of
dream doesn't work because दृश्यत्वात् मिथ्या shows dependent existence,
but Dvaitin cannot say it is real since it is seen. (I'd written a short
note on this here <http://anythingwise.blogspot.in/2017/05/blog-post.html>).
Otherwise, insane and intoxicated people see many things which will also
become real!

This last tarka has been used by Karikakara in 4.24-4.28 section to refute
two types of Buddhists with other two types of Buddhists. On a related
note, interestingly, those Dvaitins who accuse AV to be Vijnanavada could
themselves fit into Vaibhashikas and Sautrantikas as they too are
bAhyArthasatyavAdins. :)
