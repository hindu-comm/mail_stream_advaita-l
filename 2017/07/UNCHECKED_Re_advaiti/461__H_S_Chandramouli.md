Namaste Praveen Ji,



Reg  << But it is from the individual's, so-called vyaShTi's perspective.
Where is the samaShThi resolved? >>,



As you are no doubt aware, there are two well recognized prakriyas in SDV,
namely adhyArOpa-apavAda prakriyA and avasthAtraya prakriyA. The issue you
have pointed out is covered in the second prakriyA. I am not myself well
conversant with it, having only some familiarity. But Sri SSS has written
several texts covering this prakriyA like “AvasthAtraya Chandrike’,
“ParamArtha ChintAmaNi “  etc. You may like to refer to them.  This is from
vichAra perspective. But Swami VidyAranya contends, like in Panchadashi,
 that it can be resolved through upAsana also. Infact , in my
understanding, the vyaShTi perspective  is what Swami Vidyaranya  covers in
anubhutiprakasha  as driShTi sriShTi which was discussed in the other
thread. This is just an aside note and not intended for discussion here.



Regards
