​Sure, there are many viveka prakriyAs in SDV, one of them being the
avasthAtraya viveka, which can be used for mithyAtvanischaya of the
avasthAs themselves, landing into a self which is different from it.
However, I have voiced earlier that since the dream itself has far-reaching
implications, its very likely that SDV changes to DSV in the avasthAviveka.

​The total being resolved into an individual is definitely more DSV than
SDV, and that is what I have pointed out.

​Thanks, but I can barely read Kannada​ words! Even in other languages, I'm
very choosy with what I read. I prefer to stick to main prasthAnatraya or
prakraNas than anything else.

Although you have mentioned your perspective earlier too as to what is
vichAra and what is upAsana, there is no such rule at all that I know or
agree with. In fact, any vichAra based on Shruti vAkya is manana. This is
definitely possible regardless of vyAShTi, samaShTi, aikya, SDV, DSV,
avasthAtraya, kArya-kAraNa, shariratraya, etc. As for what follows is
nididhyAsana only when aikya-tattva is doubtlessly understood, but with
doubts it becomes nirguNopAsanA. I particularly assert this here, since as
I understand you also follow Sw. Paramarthanandaji and I thought you would
like to know that this is how he particularly addresses the issue at hand.
This is endorsed by Panchadashikara in chapter 9 wonderfully.

Infact , in my understanding, the vyaShTi perspective  is what Swami

​And hence, I said its DSV, more than SDV.​
