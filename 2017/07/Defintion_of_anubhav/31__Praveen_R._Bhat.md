Undoubtedly so; thats why I questioned as to why some object to the use of
the word anubhava based on English translation of it.

Yes, this is the one I mentioned in the earlier mail. However, there is a
nice पूर्वपक्ष to this as well saying that although ज्ञप्ति is भावसाधन/
भावे व्युत्पत्ति, still that धात्वर्थ has an अपेक्षा of कर्म since ज्ञा
धातु is a सकर्मक धातु। This is the basis for my asserting that if the word
अनुभव is rejected saying that it ends up meaning that there is something
different from oneself to experience, the same objection applies to ज्ञान
since the verb-root has an expectancy of an object! Although Bhashyakara
doesn't specifically tell the Purvapakshin that he is right, yet the
agreement is in his statement that it is not really ज्ञप्ति also but
लक्ष्यार्थ meaning चित् consciousness only.

Thanks, a similar one was quoted by Sreenivasa ji.

True.

Having said that, Praveen ji, your profile statement:

:) Yes, but I you see why I would have liked a technical one to refute the
difference between the two words.
