> IMO, Bhamati is advaitic sense. Although it is a slightly different
discussion, I would state that Advaitin's only issue with yoga is that it
ends in duality, but the same word निरोध is used by Sw. Vidyaranya in
Panchadashi chapter 9, replaced with the word वृत्तिशून्य in
Brahmavidashirvadapaddhati and by Bhashyakara under mantras Mandukya
3.3.4-35 by saying मनः निरुध्यते। The difference is clearly in the
culmination of non-duality and that Bhashyakara specifically says with the
introduction to these mantras by raising a question as to what is the
difference between both suShupti and nirvikalpaka mind since they are same
due to commonality of having no प्रत्यय = वृत्ति (सर्वप्रत्ययाभावे and
प्रत्ययाभावाविशेषात्). The reply given is that in the former there is the
seed form of duality and in the latter the seed form is destroyed by
understanding of non-dual self.

Anyway, we have differed earlier on this point as to your saying that
वृत्ति exists in निर्विकल्पकसमाधि and my not agreeing. The difference
doesn't matter, since when the tripuTibheda is gone, whether the vRtti
exists or not is a technicality irrelevant to tattva, at least for me. On a
technical difference, I'll choose to say it does not.

Summarizing my understanding with specific reference to your query, the

Surely so. However, please recall that I already mentioned that the
definition need not be limited to the context of Brahman. That is, it can
be same for laukika usage, completely different or qualified with
adjectives. What I intend to show is that one will indeed arrive at is that
अनुभव is ज्ञान alone repackaged, or one has to discard the latter word as
well, since the word ज्ञान has the same issues of definition when it comes
to the context of Brahman.

Thanks much.



Kind rgds,
