True, this is one of the best places of Bhashya where the vRtti is said
to be like a छिदिक्रिया which removes the false notion after which the
self-evident आत्मा shines on its own merits, which is how we say that there
is no फलव्याप्ति needed for ब्रह्मज्ञान। Yet, my question is about the
definition of अनुभव। I haven't come across a definition of the word अनुभव
in AV works I have studied and if that is true, my assumption is that we
agree with शब्दकोश which uses Nyaya definition of अनुभव। Else we would
define it.

Undoubtedly, all अनुभव will include all ज्ञान, barring स्मृति, then, but I
am not worried of अतिव्याप्ति since ज्ञान itself has that, including
स्मृति. We differentiate them contextually as व्यावहारिक, etc. My goal is
only to show that अनुभव need not be seen as a wrong word, as I can equally
prove ज्ञान as a wrong word too, since it is wider than अनुभव।
