​Wonderful. In this context, I also like Vidyaranyamuni's ध्यानदीपप्रकरण
where he recommends निर्गुणब्रह्मोपासन and refutes objections to it by
saying that if निर्गुणब्रह्मोपसन is not possible, निर्गुणब्रह्मज्ञान is
also not possible, something that I landed on after using similar logic
with someone who questioned as to how निर्गुणब्रह्मोपासन is possible!
Undoubtedly, I was so happy to read that. :)
