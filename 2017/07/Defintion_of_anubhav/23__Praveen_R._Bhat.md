Thanks. :)

Although this is used by both पक्षs to either accept or refute अनुभव,
there is some truth to both sides. Those  who refute it do so saying that
ब्रह्म is not an object of experience, but Bhashyakara has said that ब्रह्म
is not an object of knowledge either, in Kena under प्रतिबोधविधितं मतम् and
Taittiriya in ज्ञानलक्षण under सत्यं ज्ञानमनन्तं ब्रह्म। Advaitins who
accept so do not take ब्रह्म as an object but ब्रह्मज्ञान = ब्रह्मानुभव as
an आनन्दवृत्ति। The आनन्द is प्रतिबिम्बित but due to विषयरहितस्वरूप।

There is certainly an impossibility of accurate expression w.r.t. something
that has no other which is equally true with the word ज्ञान as it is with
the word अनुभव। My intention is only to show that the sword cuts both ways.
