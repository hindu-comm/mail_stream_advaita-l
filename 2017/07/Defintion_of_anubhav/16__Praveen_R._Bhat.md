I do not have the book with me readily, but that चकार tells me that its
not a definition. Its also not a definition due to the reason mentioned in
my first post that only suffixes used are different between अनुभव and
अनुभूति, so its like a dictionary meaning. The qualifiers used are equally
true for any word used there, be it ज्ञान, अनुभव or अनुभूति।

Thanks.
