I mentioned the sense of immediacy of the word anubhava only w.r.t. jnAna
as two words in those forms. If qualifiers are added, they can be added to
अनुभव also, although परोक्षानुभव is a word unseen, the usage would mean
परानुभव or अननुभव, else the qualifier leading to the title अपरोक्षानुभूति
would not be needed. (I have already said that अनुभूति and अनुभव have exact
same connotation with different suffixes). Ergo, I don't see any difference
between ज्ञान and अनुभव with same qualifiers.
