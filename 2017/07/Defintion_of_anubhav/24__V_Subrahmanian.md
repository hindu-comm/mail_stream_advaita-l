Very true.  Just see this sentence of the Br.up. bhashya:

तस्मात् आत्मा वै अरे द्रष्टव्यः दर्शनार्हः, दर्शनविषयमापादयितव्यः ;

So, Atman has to be made a vishaya! Certainly this does not contradict the
Advaitic position that Atman is aprameya or avishaya, etc. What is intended
here is that it has to be a vishaya for the vritti. मनसिवेदमाप्तव्यम्. न
तत्र वाग्गच्छति,नो मनो ...

Bhamati holds that it is the  upahita brahman that is vishaya for the
vritti. Madhusudana has taken this in the Advaita siddhi in reply to the
opponent.
