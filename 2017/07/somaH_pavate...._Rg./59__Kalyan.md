//The Rg vedic mantra: सोमः पवते जनिता मतीनां जनिता दिवो जनिता पृथिव्या:।
जनिताग्नेर्जनिता सूर्यस्य जनितेन्द्रस्य जनितोत विष्णोः 9.5  which depicts
Shiva as the progenitor of agni, surya, indra, vishnu,//


Here, Sayana does not interpret soma as a reference to Shiva.

In fact, in Rig veda 7.40.5, Sayana interprets that all devas are branches of Vishnu.

How do we reconcile this with the so-called birth of vishnu mentioned above? Madhusudhana gives us the answer. In BG, when the Lord says he is vishnu among adityas, the interpretation given for the word vishnu is the vAmana avatAra. So the Rig vedic birth of vishnu in the above shloka is nothing but his incarnation as vAmana. This is also confirmed by the mention of birth of Indra, since Vishnu as vAmana is upendra, the younger brother of Indra. Hope that clarifies.

Kalyan
