namaste,
this mail is written only after some hesitation to interject in to a
conversation between senior members..

the rik in question is  9:96:5  (9th mandala, 96th sukta, 5th mantra)
While Sayana provides multiple synonyms to Soma,  Sri Aurobindo enunciates
a key to RV by providing uniform meaning to words and phrases to derive
mantraartha whereever they are used.
In that sense, Soma at one level is explained as ananda or delight of
existence, as in sat-chit-ananda. It is described as the source of all
manifestations..

Applying this subtle meaning, this rik may point to devashrushti -
theogony- from very Ananda or Delight. Both Sri Kapali Sastry, and
contemporaneously,  Sri RL Kashyap  have used the same key to describe Soma
in such terms (meaning of the terms here cited from RLK's  work). Navama
mandala is Soma mandala or Soma Pavamana mandala and there are hundreds of
mantras describing various aspects of Soma. I have not read the upanishad
yet, but would like to see context in which it picks up only one of mantras.

Maybe one reference to Shiva via soma comes in 10:25:9  as indrasa indo
shivah shakhA:  (shiva used here more in the meaning of mangalam) =  Indu
or Soma is the auspicious friend of Indra.
This is just to point out that there are, traditionally, different
interpretations of rik mantras...
