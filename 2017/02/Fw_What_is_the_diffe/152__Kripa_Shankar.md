‎»‎Thanks a lot for the references Subramanian. It is clear that Gaudapada makes a distinction between Arambhava - Parinama vada / Satkaryavada and vivarta vada.

You said : ‎Vedanta too admits the satkāryavāda: the effect, prior to manifestation, is non-different from the cause. Brahman the 'cause' alone appears as the 'effect', the world. It is for this reason the rajju sarpa, mirage water, etc, examples are given in the bhashya. As per sankhya satkaryavada, the effect, prior to manifestation, is real. They do not negate the effect as unreal unlike the vedantins.

»‎ This is essentially the difference between vivarta vada and satkaryavada / parinama vada. Here the key word is * appears*. The real world example is given by your self in the Gita portion :
‎
‎अपरंभवतोजन्मपरंजन्मविवस्वतः।
कथमेतद्विजानीयांत्वमादौप्रोक्तवानिति॥ ४ ॥

If we accept parinama vada to be same as vivarta vada, how can Krishna explain this paradox? Because it's akin to effect preceding the cause.

Krishna replies in the very same fashion as Gaudapada and explicitly says Atman is Ajata, ishwara etc. The key criterion here is mAyA. ‎
‎
‎अजोऽपिसन्नव्ययात्मा
भूतानामीश्वरोऽपिसन्।
प्रकृतिंस्वामधिष्ठाय
सम्भवाम्यात्ममायया॥ ६ ॥‎

Hence creation sustenance and dissolution is mAya, vyAvahArika only. Ultimately it is Aja. Only vivarta vada can explain this paradox sufficiently. parinama vada is limited only to vyaahaarika level.

Regards
Kripa ‎
