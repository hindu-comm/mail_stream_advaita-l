Samshaya vanishing is the same as they getting answered in the sense that there is no need for any articulation by way of clarification. It can happen to others in other circumstances too where for example while studying one gets a clarification of the question under discussion and as a corollary other doubts can get addressed.

One example is the Mundaka vakya  'bhidyate hrdaya granthi.....chidyante sarva samshayāḥ' where the bhashyam says:  छिद्यन्ते सर्वे ज्ञेयविषयाः संशयाः लौकिकानाम् आ मरणात् गङ्गास्रोतोवत्प्रवृत्ता विच्छेदमायान्ति ।   All those doubts pertaining to the jneya that the loukika-s bear till death, like the flow of the Gangā, will get dispelled upon the very realization of the Truth.
