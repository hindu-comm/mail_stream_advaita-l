‎Sorry for the barrage of emails. In Sankhya, prakriti is kriyatmaka and purusha is nishkriya. Both purusha and prakruti are real and eternal. Hence in parinama vada of Sankhya a real cause produces a real effect.

But if we apply parinama vada to Advaita, prakruti is neither real nor unreal, brahman becomes the ultimate cause and hence will not be nishkriya anymore, and a real cause produces an apparent effect.

But we observe in daily life that a real cause produces a real effect like gold-ornament. I am bit confused now.

Regards
Kripa ‎
