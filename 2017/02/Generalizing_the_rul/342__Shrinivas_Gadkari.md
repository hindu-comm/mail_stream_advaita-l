Namaste,

We know that under certain conditions ‘n” sound in Sanskrit changes to ‘N’. 


http://sanskrit.samskrutam.com/en.grammar-tutorial-miscellaneous-Natva.ashx
I wonder if we can generalize this to the entire group of sounds 
‘t, th, d, dh, n’ change respectively to --> ‘T, Th, D, Dh, N’ under 
certain conditions. 

May be ‘T, Th, D, Dh, N’ do not have a standalone existence of their 
own, but are derived, supporting consonants. Hence we have so few 
words starting with these consonants. 

Regards, 
Shrini
