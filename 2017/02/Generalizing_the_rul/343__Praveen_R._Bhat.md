Yes, there are specific Panini rules for this, main ones being रषाभ्यां नो
णः समानपदे and अट्कुप्वाङ्नुम्व्यवायेऽपि। There are few exceptions negating
these rules or extending it across समानपदs that follow these.

I wonder if we can generalize this to the entire group of sounds

No, this cannot be imagined; there are no Panini rules for this. टवर्ग is
a class of consonants separate and not dependent on तवर्ग। Hypothetically,
if this has to be imagined, then the other way rule will also be
meaningless which is धात्वादेः णो नः। The णकार at the beginning of a धातु
takes the नकार as a substitute. For example, the धातु नी that we see being
used to form words such as नयति or नायकः is णीञ् in the धातुपाठ।

Even in the case of नकार becoming णकार, the latter has to have a standalone
existence for it to become an आदेश / replacement. So too, the टवर्ग।

Moreover, the words do not have to start from a particular letter for that
letter to have existence. It can occur anywhere in the word.
