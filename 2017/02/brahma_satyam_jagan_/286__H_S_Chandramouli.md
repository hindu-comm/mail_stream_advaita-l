Namaste.



Reg  << If we say Jagat is Satya as Brahman we are agreeing
with Sri Vaishnavas and Dvaitis.>>,



Not so. This view was also advanced by advaitins like Sri Bhartruprapancha
(prior to Sri Bhagavatpada) and Sri Bhaskara, Sri Yadavaprakasha (Both
later to Sri Bhagavtpada). They are also considered advaitins because they
held Brahman and Jiva to be the same. They are advaitins who are termed
Brahmaparinama vAdins as opposed to other advaitins who follow the sidhanta
advanced by Sri Bhagavatpada and are termed Brahmavivarta vAdins.
