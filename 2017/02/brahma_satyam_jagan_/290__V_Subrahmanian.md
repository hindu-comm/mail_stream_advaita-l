I have heard that Bhaskara had openly proclaimed that his sole  objective
is to criticise Shankara. It appears that the first pejorative use of
'maayaavaada/in was by him. How can he be called an advaitin? Also
Ramanujites distinguish Yadavaprakasha's school from Advaita. There is a
project to reconstruct this school from the various passages of the
Sribhashya.
