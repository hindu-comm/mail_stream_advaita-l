This is first time I am hearing Bheda is existing even after Jnana.
How can this be Advaita if Bheda is always there?

No it is not possible. He will be seeing ring also but he may not
focus on it. He may focus on gold and its weight.

That is the mistake. The World did not exist at all at any time -
Past, Present and Future. Jnana will give the experience of
Nishprapancha Brahman only.

Kindly see how Adi Sankara has described Nishprapancha Brahman in
3-2-14 of Sutra Bhashya

रूपाद्याकाररहितमेव हि ब्रह्म अवधारयितव्यम् , न रूपादिमत् । कस्मात् ?
तत्प्रधानत्वात् ; ‘अस्थूलमनण्वह्रस्वमदीर्घम्’ (बृ. उ. ३ । ८ । ८)
‘अशब्दमस्पर्शमरूपमव्ययम्’ (क. उ. १ । ३ । १५), (मुक्ति. उ. २ । ७२),
‘आकाशो वै नाम नामरूपयोर्निर्वहिता ते यदन्तरा तद्ब्रह्म’ (छा. उ. ८ । १४
। १) ‘दिव्यो ह्यमूर्तः पुरुषः सबाह्याभ्यन्तरो ह्यजः’ (मु. उ. २ । १ ।
२) ‘तदेतद्ब्रह्मापूर्वमनपरमनन्तरमबाह्यमयमात्मा ब्रह्म सर्वानुभूः’ (बृ.
उ. २ । ५ । १९) इत्येवमादीनि वाक्यानि --
निष्प्रपञ्चब्रह्मात्मतत्त्वप्रधानानि, -- न अर्थान्तरप्रधानानि —
इत्येतत्प्रतिष्ठापितम् ‘तत्तु समन्वयात्’ (ब्र. सू. १ । १ । ४) इत्यत्र
; तस्मादेवंजातीयकेषु वाक्येषु यथाश्रुतं निराकारमेव ब्रह्म
अवधारयितव्यम् । इतराणि तु आकारवद्ब्रह्मविषयाणि वाक्यानि न तत्प्रधानानि
; उपासनाविधिप्रधानानि हि तानि ; तेष्वसति विरोधे यथाश्रुतमाश्रयितव्यम्
; सति तु विरोधे तत्प्रधानानि अतत्प्रधानेभ्यो बलीयांसि भवन्ति — इत्येष
विनिगमनायां हेतुः, येन उभयीष्वपि श्रुतिषु सतीषु अनाकारमेव ब्रह्म
अवधार्यते, न पुनर्विपरीतमिति ॥ १४ ॥
