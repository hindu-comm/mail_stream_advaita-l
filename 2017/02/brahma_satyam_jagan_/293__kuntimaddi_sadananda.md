Durgaji - PraNAms. 

The answer lies in your question itself. Janga mithyaa - mithyaa means it is not non-existent. From the absolute point - there is nothing other than brahman. Jnaani understands that there is nothing other than the self at the absolute level but at the relative level (or transactional level ) the world of plurality exists. From the point of Gold, there are no ornaments other than gold - that is the vision of gold-smith. Yet at transactional level - rings or different from bangles and their utilities and date of births etc all differ. There is no confusion there. It is like knowing all are fundamentally electrons, protons and neutrons. That understanding does not make me equate garbage and the delicious food as one - There is ontological difference.

He can say that to teach others. As part of anusandhānam also he can invoke
such statements. Also, that statement is bheda-nindā or bheda-negation
specific and hence does not espouse bheda.
