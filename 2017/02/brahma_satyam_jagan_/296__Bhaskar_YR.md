If a jnani says "Brahma satyam Jagan mithya", then does it not amount to 'Jnani has a bheda buddi'?

Yes, it will be dvandva drushti, jagat is mithya and who sees this mithyA jagat ( or who sees anAtma vastu) is satya i.e. jeeva who is brahman.  This bheda buddhi anyway does not allow him to have the bhUma drushti or samyak drushti.  Sometimes I really wonder, how jagan mithyatva vAdins attribute 'bhAva' to avidyA and at the same time argues that jagat is abhAva even though it has been equally available for both jnAni-s and ajnAni-s through asti and prateeti.  

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
