Namaste

Main ingredient missing in your argument is Avidya. Are you hesitating
to bring Avidya? Why? Is it because Sri SSS cannot accept Avidya is
there as a Bhaava Roopa? With Avidya all Vikara will be possible like
rope to snake.

Brahman can have Vikara to Nama Roopa because of Avidya. Because the
Karya is due to Avidya we have to accept the Karya as Mithya like
Avidya. Therefore Naama Roopa are Mithya only. They can never be Atma.

>>  vikAra of brahman to nAma rUpa is not allowed in Advaita as brahman is nirvishesha and nirvikAra. But kAryAkAra (nAma rUpa) is not Atma vyatirikta for the brahma jnAni, sarvaM khalvidaM brahman and this brahman is ekaM sat but viprAH bahudA vadanti.  Sa cha bAhyalOkO nAsyasmAkaM AtmavyatiriktaH because sarvaM hi asmAkaM AtmabhUtameva...there is no existence for kAryAkAra 'ring' apart from 'gold' hence kAryAkAra ring too satyameva because it is nothing but 'gold'.
