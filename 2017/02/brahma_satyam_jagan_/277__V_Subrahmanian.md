Actually we are no differing here.

Where?

Shankara, keeping that alone in view has clearly stated, in Chandogya 6.1.4:

कोऽसौ ? विकारो नामधेयं नामैव नामधेयम् , स्वार्थे धेयप्रत्ययः,
वागालम्बनमात्रं नामैव केवलं न विकारो नाम वस्त्वस्ति ; परमार्थतो मृत्तिकेत्येव
*मृत्तिकैव तु* सत्यं वस्त्वस्ति ॥

So, even in vyavahāra, a distinction is made by the vastu tattvadarśī: the
kāryam , vikāra, is avastu, and the paramārtha dṛṣṭi is to hold that '(as)
clay alone' is real. It is keeping this in view alone that Anandagiri says
what I have referred to in the Mandukya karika bhashya tikā.

I would like to draw your attention to a recently published book:
वाचारम्भणश्रुत्यर्थविवेचनम् published by the Sringeri Peetham. In this book
the specific objection of non-advaitin schools on Advaita: If the shruti
wanted to say that the kārya is mithyā, it would not have used 'iti'. Thus,
this word is redundant according to the Advaitin - has been answered
showing how 'iti' is taken into account by Shankara implicitly by
annotating the sutra and upanishad bhashyas. It makes very interesting
reading. The book is available perhaps in Bangalore mutt book stall too or
in the Vidyabharati Press here.
