Namaste Sri Venkatraghavan Ji,



Reg  << Please could you elaborate the basis by which one should consider
bhesdAbheda vAdins such as BhAskara as advaitins? >>,



Let me clarify that I have made that statement based on such references
being made by some authors like Sri Venkataramiah, not by my own study of
Sri Bhaskara’s works. Sri SSS also in his work वेदान्तप्रक्रियाप्रत्यभिज्ञा
(vedAntaprakriyApratyabhij~nA) has covered the works of Sri Bhaskara along
with those of other advaitins like Sri Padmapada, Sri Vachaspati Mishra,
Sri Ananda Bodha, Sri Chitsukhacharya etc. In his work “History of Vedanta
Vichara” in kannada, Sri SSS includes Sri Bhaskara along with other well
known advaitins.



Regards
