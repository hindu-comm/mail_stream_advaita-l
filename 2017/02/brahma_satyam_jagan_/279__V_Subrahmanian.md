This is not supported by the bhashya. It is contradicted by the passages
that I have cited. Anandagiri:  यथा घटशरावादिष्वसत्येषु
मृत्तिकामात्रमनुस्यूतं सत्यमिष्यते, तथैवानात्मस्वसत्येष्वात्ममात्रं
सत्यमेष्टव्यम् ।

The above clearly shows that what is anusyutam alone is satyam and not the
karyam 'as clay' in the way you hold. Same way, anātmā is asatyam and what
is anusyutam in anatma, the sat, alone is satyam.

Not so, kāryam is avastu as nāma rupa object; what is anusyutam alone is
satyam. When the clay that is anusyutam is taught as the only real, there
is no way the kāryam is also held real.

Because Shankara has not said anything for iti explicitly. It is only
implicit.

The vivarta is there because Shankara takes this mantra and the analogy to
explain the satya-mithya in siddhanta, everywhere.

Shankara has already stated that the kārya drsti is apāramārthika and the
kāraṇa satyatva drsti alone is pāramārthika. So, effects are mithya and
that which is anusyutam in them alone is satya. In BGB 2.16 Shankara takes
the vikāra as mithyāvabhāsanam only:

त्वमपि तत्त्वदर्शिनां दृष्टिमाश्रित्य शोकं मोहं च हित्वा शीतोष्णादीनि
नियतानियतरूपाणि द्वन्द्वानि ‘विकारोऽयमसन्नेव मरीचिजलवन्मिथ्यावभासते’ इति
मनसि निश्चित्य तितिक्षस्व इत्यभिप्रायः ॥ १६ ॥ That he calls tattvadrsti.
Again, there itself:

 सन् घटः, सन् पटः, सन् हस्ती इति । एवं सर्वत्र तयोर्बुद्ध्योः घटादिबुद्धिः
व्यभिचरति । तथा च दर्शितम् । न तु सद्बुद्धिः । तस्मात् घटादिबुद्धिविषयः
असन् , व्यभिचारात् ; न तु सद्बुद्धिविषयः, अव्यभिचारात् ॥

That which changes, vikāra, is asat; that which does not change, running in
and thru them, alone is sat. That which is vyabhicharita is asat and
avyabhichāri alone is sat.
