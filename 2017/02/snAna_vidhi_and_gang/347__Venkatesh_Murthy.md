Namaste

The rule to not be naked in taking bath is for showing respect to God
because when Snana mantras are said and prayed to God we should not be
without clothes. In taking river and sea bath also we should not be
naked because Sun God is the witness. We should show respect to Sun
God. But I heard that after going to toilet we should wash both front
and back private parts with water or mud. The modern method of using
tissue paper is not allowed.

> Just off the topic !  Thought of sharing something which I follow.  It has been observed in many households that people don't follow the basic method of taking bath.  The bath sans ritualistic bath is like "kunjara-snAna" (akin to the bath of an elephant) where it takes the bath in river and again smudges itself with  the dirt in the banks.

> Furnishing below the basic method of taking bath everyday which everyone can easily follow.
>
> This is the “gangA dhyAna vidhi” which everyone should chant before taking the morning bath thereby one becomes externally pure, per se.

> Those who can chant अघमर्षण सूक्तं (Aghamarshana Sukta) can chant the same after this shlokas.
> Those who are applying मृत्तिका (mrittika – the soil / clay from tulasi brundavana) can chant मृत्तिका सूक्तं depending upon the availability of the time and official schedules.
>
> Infact, ritualistic process of taking bath is a lengthy one and one has to do Achamana followed by snAna-sankalpa.
> These aspects are followed when one is taking bath in flowing river. For taking bath in bathrooms of apartments and using soap is the order of the day now.  So,  chanting of  गंगा ध्यानं is enough.
>
> नग्नस्नानम् (taking bath without clothes) is prohibited in dharma shaastra and one has to wear a white cloth / towel while taking bath.
> Another dry cloth should be placed on the hanger.  Once the bathing is over with gangA dhyAna, one should wipe oneself with the dry cloth, rinse it with water and should wear the same (the towel / cloth used for wiping) by removing the wet towel (that was worn while bathing) from upwards. Depending upon the time, one can chant the वस्त्र निपीडिनमन्त्रं (mantra while rinsing the cloth) by which the pitru-devatas get tripti.
>
> After coming out, should wear the white dry dhoti and uttareeyam by perform पुराण आचमनं.  This is followed by ऊर्ध्वापुण्ड्र धारण either with jala or tulasi mrittika and regular procedure of sandhyavandana is performed.  Generally, bhasma dhAraNa is done after arghya pradAna which is followed by most of the andhraites and by me also.
