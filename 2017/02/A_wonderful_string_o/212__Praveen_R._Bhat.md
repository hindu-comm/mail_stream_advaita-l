To add to Siva Senani ji's translation, other possible translations of the
4 following words are: apUrva =causeless/ that which is not the cause,
anapara =effectless/ that which is not an effect, anantara =that without
inner-side (not that without inside like Max Mueller's translation leading
to shUnyatA), abAhya =that without outer-side.

Kind rgds,
