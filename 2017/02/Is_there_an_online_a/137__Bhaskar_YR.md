praNAms Sri Subbu prabhuji
Hare Krishna

Though I have not heard audio of Itareya up.,  bruhadAraNyaka & IshaavAsya  these Upanishads (br. Up. Truteeya brAhmaNa) are available  in the printed version along with atharvaNi sUryOpanishad, nArAyanOpanishad in rAmakrishna mission publication.  Both taiteereeya and mahAnAraayana Upanishad have been beautifully chanted my challakere brothers.  And it is a prevalent practice in our purOhit circle that for vaikunTa samAraadhana, we, most of the times chant only taitereeya and nArAyaNa Upanishads  during the program of veda pArAyaNa :-) 

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar


The Bṛhadāraṇyaka is chanted with svara by Shukla Yajurvedin Ghanapāṭhi-s.
I have heard this several times in Sringeri and elsewhere when Vidwan Vijayaraghava Sastri of Chennai who is a ghanapāṭhi of that shā;khā and an Advaita Acharya.  When he would visit Sringeri, he would chant the Brhadaranyaka upanishad portions in the presence of and much delight of the  Jagadguru.
