Namaste,

Does anyone know of an online audio resource for any of the Upanishads
chanted with svaras?

Isha and Taittiriya are pretty much preserved in the tradition by chanting,
but I am not sure if others in the dashopaniShad are. Unfortunately, even
shanti pATha of sAmavedIya Upanishads (ApyAyantu...) is losing svara at
many places.

Thanks,
--Praveen R. Bhat
