The Bṛhadāraṇyaka is chanted with svara by Shukla Yajurvedin Ghanapāṭhi-s.
I have heard this several times in Sringeri and elsewhere when Vidwan
Vijayaraghava Sastri of Chennai who is a ghanapāṭhi of that shā;khā and an
Advaita Acharya.  When he would visit Sringeri, he would chant the
Brhadaranyaka upanishad portions in the presence of and much delight of the
 Jagadguru.
