Namaste Sri Subrahmanian Ji,



Reg  << In the gloss, Anandagiri Acharya too remarks: the first analogy is
as per
the parinama vada and the second is as per vivarta vada. So, Shankara does
not make a distinction between the two methods. Ta he context of the above
bhashya is also interesting: It is the sankalpa of Brahman: Let me become
many and create the world.  So, the One becoming many is actually the Sat
appearing as many and both the parinama and vivarta prakriyas are fine in
explaining this.  Ultimately, Sat alone is real, whether it is seen as the
Karana (clay) or adhishtana (vivarta,  rope).>>,



I find it difficult to agree with such a conclusion. Sri Bhagavatpada
certainly makes a distinction between the two methods, parinama and
vivarta. One becoming many could be in both ways. But One becoming many
without itself undergoing vikAra is only by one method, vivarta.



For ease of understanding and to lead   to the final Truth starting from
familiar anubhava, parinama vada is accepted provisionally and
presented  initially
to explain the process of Creation. But it is rejected in the final
analysis and only vivarta vada is accepted by Sri Bhagavatpada.



Regards
