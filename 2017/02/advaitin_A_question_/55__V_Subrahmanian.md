I think the very Chandogya shruti which gives the example is admitting that
the clay-clay products case is a teaching of vivarta only for the usage of
'vikaro naamadheyam' and 'mrttiketyeva satyam' [vikara is mere name,
mithya, and the upadana karanam alone is satyam]  So, the vivarta vada case
need not be introduced by the advaitin with effort.

Everywhere. Shankara has held, it is the cause alone that is seen as the
effects.
