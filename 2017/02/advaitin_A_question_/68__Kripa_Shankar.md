‎Namaste Sadanand,

If I may, I wish to point out something for your consideration. First of all what is vivarta? It means apparent transformation. That means really there is no transformation but yet we observe it. Really there is no creation but we observe it.

Milk to curd is an illustration for parinama vada. Gold to gold bangles is not an ‎illustration for vivarta because we know it is not apparent transformation(it is real). But the cause does not undergo irreversible transformation. Hence it is not an illustration for parinama vada either. It is an illustration for cause-effect sambandha indicating that the effect is just nama roopa.

Snake rope is the illustration for vivarta because there was never a snake but still I saw it. So the transformation from rope to snake was apparent not real. Only vivarta vada upholds ajativada.

Regards
Kripa

PraNAms

I had to reopen the discussion just to point out of some interesting aspects. I do agree that I have not understood Shree Vidyaranya properly - that motivated me to raise the issue in the first place. I have no desire to irritate anybody, since I do see His glory in all. 


I will talk about reversible, irreversible and transformation-less transformations later and their relevance to parinaama and vivarta. I do find some of the fundamental concepts in science can be used effectively to communicate some of the Vedantic concepts, particularly to those who are exposed to science. I have no desire to address the traditionalists, as I know it is a waste of their time!

The point I want to bring here now is in the sloka 49 and also reference to little bit earlier slokas in the same chapter, the essence concurs Shree Subbuji's post.  Vidyaranya clearly points out in this sloka that the milk becoming curds which I referred to as irreversible transformation is indeed called as parinaam since the original is lost -due to irreversible transformation. On the other hand the mud-pot and gold-ear ring examples he refers to them as vivarta only. 



sloka 13-49 of panchadashi.

pariNaame puurva ruupam tyajet tat ksheerarupavat|

mRit suvarNe nivarteti ghaaTad kundala yoH na hi||


In the pariNaama, the former (cause) form is rejected or get destroyed - kshera ruupavat - like the form of milk (is destroyed in the curds, the effect). This is what irreversible transformation implies - I cannot get back milk or reverse the process. 


In the pot and ear-ring, the mud and the gold forms are not rejected or their state is retained. Hence we call this as vivarta or in the scientific terms - transformation-less transformation. Gold remains as gold and yet different ornaments are formed. It is not even a reversible transformation as ice becoming water but a transformation-less transformation - this word I coined for vivarta - graspable by those who are familiar with transformations. 


The rope/snake example even though is vivarta from the point of rope, it is not relevant for the topic of discussion of this chapter as I had pointed out earlier, since it is pratibhaasika. It is also evident, since Vidyaranaya did not discuss it any further. The reason is simple; the topic of discussion is how the creation-less creation occurred since there cannot real creation at Brahman level. Hence the discussion pertains to vyavahaara level and not praatibhaasika level. 



I thank again all who contributed in one form or the other for the discussion, with my apologies to those who get irritated with my posts. 



I will write more on this chapter for my own benefit as I revel more and more on the Vidyaranya's analysis of the multiple facets of maaya shakti - It is fascinating and meditative also, as I found. 


I find teaching is the best way to learn, even though some think that I can never learn.

First rule to understand anything which is being said is to not guess,
second avoid confirmation-bias, and third follow words.
That will remove most problems, if you are trying to get the meaning of a
sentence uttered by someone else.

Accept what vidyAraNya says, don't superimpose your ideas on it, don't bend
it to fit your ideas.

Mark the usage of 'irreversible transformation' instead of
'transformation' used previously.
That's superimposing your idea on vidyAraNya.
If he didn't included that in his definition, you should also avoid that if
you are a person willing to understand his words.

'Should belong'? On what basis? Any rule?
Just because a person never understood a sentence quoted from a
work/uttered by a person and created a castle of thoughts on wrong ideas,
it doesn't mean that other persons should do same!

'Transformation-less transformation'? Do you mean vivartta by it? If yes,
what is the similarity between rajju-sarpa and it?

Useless sentence in present context. It is a big contributor to confusion.

BTW, the sentence doesn't stand test, as no shop sells you ornaments
without charging for designing.
You are willingly ignoring that because of insignificance compared to gold,
or the pricing team is good at hiding it.

Yes, this will help you to understand why श्रुति uses मृत्पिण्डः, we
choose to ignore that - is another thing.

Can't get it.

Wow!! That's enough to show that there is some big problem with your
understanding.
