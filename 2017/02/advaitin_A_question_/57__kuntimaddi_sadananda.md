PraNams



Just as a final note. I am not disrespecting Shree Vidyaranya swami. As shree lalalitaalalitaa once pointed earlier that we are only addressing issues here and not the persons involved, and what is the best way to present the apparent transformation that appears to be real at transnational level, with Scriptures forming the ultimate paramaana. 



I just completed my talk on the topic and I did present what Shree Vidyaranaya said and also presented my understanding with clear distinction between the two. The listener can use their judgement.


With this I stop.


Hari Om!
