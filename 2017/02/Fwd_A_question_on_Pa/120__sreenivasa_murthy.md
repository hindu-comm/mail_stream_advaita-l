Dear Friends,
A lot of interesting exchange of postings is taking place amongst the eminenet scholars of this group.Has anyone tried to put this question to oneself : " Am I a vivarta or a pariNAma?" I am sure it will be an interesting subject and an answer to this question may provide a clue to the problem that is being presently discussed.
With respectful namaskarams,Sreenivasa Murthy

Thanks for the elaborate article. I can't claim to have understood
everything, so excuse my questions:
--Is "कारणस्यापारमार्थिकत्वम्" towards the beginning have a typo meant to
read कारणस्य पारमार्थिकत्वम्, since in my understanding कारणस्य
पारमार्थिकत्वम् इष्यते एव।
--"एकविज्ञानेन" अभेदे इति कीदृशी तृतीया? Grammatically, in what category of
तृतीया would you consider अभेद in? Would इत्थम्भूते or प्रकारवाचि be right?
--After न हि केवलाया मृदो ज्ञानेन... किन्तु... इति ज्ञानेन, I can't make
out the next word, is it to read अभिन्नाभावमादाय? Thats how I have
currently understood the word.

I was anyway tilting towards both, not only परिणाम। I just mentioned what
the Vyakhya confirmed on 13.51 that the Chandogya quoted examples can be
used for both परिणाम and विवर्त based on the aspects indicated.

Especially if we take everything of the example literally, or if we lose
the तात्पर्य of the example. It is nice to see that you established the
तात्पर्य of वाचारम्भणश्रुति examples.
