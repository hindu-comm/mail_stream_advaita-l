I just completed an article about this problem. It became long, so didn't'
post on शास्त्रम् GoogleGroup too.
Here is the link for those who are interested and can understand Sanskrit.

It concentrates on meaning of different bhAShya-s and pa~nchadashI shloka-s.

I was observing the thread. I think that a few people are standing in
support of pariNAmatva of pot.
H S Chandramouli started, Praveen said a few more things, and
Venkataraghavan presented it very well.

I'm amused to see that how vague can be our understanding about things
which we read. Many times, I've felt it myself.
