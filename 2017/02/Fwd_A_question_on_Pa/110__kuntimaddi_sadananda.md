Bhaskarji - praNams.

All three examples only provide the upaadaana kaaranam.

Nimitta has to be inferred - from further statements - tat aikshataad, bahu syaam - prajaayeyeti.

Hence chit aspect comes in besides the sat -this is the essence of Iishidaadikarana of Br. Sutra.

 Subject: RE: [Advaita-l] Fwd: A question on PariNAma and vivarta

Vaachaarambhanam sruti does not give milk-curds example for vaachaarambhanam since milk-curds is parinaama.
fortunately it gives example of gold-ornaments, mud-pots and iron-tools - which are all vivarta and not parinaama.

Yes, examples like the above have been given to clear the upAdAna kAraNa of this jagat. From which material the nimitta brahman created this jagat?? It cannot be different from brahman since brahman is the ekamevAdviteeyaM prior to the presentation of creation (sadeva sOmyedamagra Aseet ekam eva adviteeyaM) so the material used for this creation also should be him only hence by knowing the upAdAna kAraNa (the svarUpa of jagat) the brahman can be known. Thus, aruNi clarifies his son svetaketu in chAndOgya : yathA ekena mrutpindena sarvaM mrunmayaM vijnAtaM syAdvAchAraMbhaNaM vikArO nAmadheyaM mruttiketyeva satyaM. The brahman is the vivartOpadAna kAraNa for this jagat hence elsewhere shankara says : brahma svabhAvO hi prapanchaH na prapancha svabhAvaM brahma. This kArya-kAraNa ananyatvaM does not go well with milk-curd analogy as both these dravya-s have different substance. 

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
