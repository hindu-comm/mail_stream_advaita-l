Dear Sri Bhaskar
Milk becomes curd due to bacteria present in the atmosphere.So milk does not become curd by itself as time passes.But Brahman becomes the universe by Himself as nothing extraneous other than Brahman exists to get added.The example is just an illustration and one should not go on extending it to prove a point.The Upanishad just says that Brahman alone is truth and there is nothing other than Brahman.Just to make this understandable by us mortals the examples were given from mundane life.Even in gold and ornaments we know copper has to be added.Clay to pot also sunlight or heat is required to make it useful as pot.But the fact is gold,clay only get modified and they pervade the form is the truth as Brahman pervades the prapancham.
R.Krishnamoorthy.

> Yes, examples like the above have been given to clear the upAdAna kAraNa of this jagat.  From which material the nimitta brahman created this jagat??  It cannot be different from brahman since brahman is the ekamevAdviteeyaM prior to the presentation of creation (sadeva sOmyedamagra Aseet ekam eva adviteeyaM) so the material used for this creation also should be him only hence by knowing the upAdAna kAraNa (the svarUpa of jagat) the brahman can be known.  Thus, aruNi clarifies his son svetaketu in chAndOgya : yathA ekena mrutpindena sarvaM mrunmayaM vijnAtaM syAdvAchAraMbhaNaM vikArO nAmadheyaM mruttiketyeva satyaM.  The brahman is the vivartOpadAna kAraNa for this jagat hence elsewhere shankara says : brahma svabhAvO hi prapanchaH na prapancha svabhAvaM brahma.  This kArya-kAraNa ananyatvaM does not go well with milk-curd analogy as both these dravya-s have different substance.
