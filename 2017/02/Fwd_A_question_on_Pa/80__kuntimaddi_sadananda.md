Sir - while you are waring ring, you are wearing it because it is gold, sustained by gold and can merge back to gold. If it is wrought iron, even if it is a ring that fits your fingers you would not like wear it.
Hence it ring you like to wear is gold only and wants to preserve it if possible.

 Subject: Re: [Advaita-l] Fwd: A question on PariNAma and vivarta

You cannot wear a lump of gold on your finger as you can a ring. Looking
from the point of utility the lump of gold and the ring are different. A
real transformation has taken place and this transformation requires a
goldsmith's effort. So is the case with a lump of earth and a pot.

For me real example of vivarta is rajjusarpa bhranti.



regards,
Sarma.
