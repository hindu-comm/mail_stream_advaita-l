​Yes, it was a wrong word. It should be कार्य्यस्यापारमार्थिकत्वम् ।

​प्रकृत्यादिभ्य उपसङ्ख्यानम् इतिवार्त्तिकात् अभेदे तृतीया । यथा धान्येन धनी

​अविनाभावमादाय is correct.
अ-विनाभाव = The quality of not staying apart from (kAraNa).​

​As I said, that pot-example is always categorised as pariNAma in advaita
texts.
It is only vidyAraNya-muni, who has created a new prakriyA to treat all
kArya-s as vivartta of their cause. That's a new way to think. It is not
popular and accepted by all.
So, you have to be careful to not allow vagueness any space here.
That's why you have to treat vidyAraNya-s that chapter separately.
