praNAms Sri Sadananda prabhuji
Hare Krishna

All three examples only provide the upaadaana kaaranam.


Ø     Yes, all these examples given to show the upAdAna kAraNam of jagat..and for that matter this upAdAna kAraNam is too we have to decide through shAstra pramANa..Since nAma rUpa vikArAtmaka jagat is pratyaksha pramANa gOchara and for this adhishtAnaM / upAdAnaM is nirvikAri brahman which is not pratyaksha pramANa gOchara but shAstra pramANa prasiddha.  Which you have clarified below :

Nimitta has to be inferred  - from further statements - tat aikshataad, bahu syaam - prajaayeyeti.


Ø     Yes, and to infer the nimitta of the nAma rUpa, there must be some sAdrushya between vrAkruta jagat and its avyAkruta upAdAna…If we assert nAmarUpa itself kevala avidyAkalpita buddhi pratyaya of jeeva then the brahman adhishtAnaM cannot be established.  In the example of rajju-sarpa, the sarpa is adhyastha and adhishtAnam might be rajju or crack on the floor or a garland that we will come to know since the adhishtAnaM here is ‘pratyaksha pramANa gOchara’ where as in dArshtAntika brahman which  is adhishtAnam / upAdAnaM is shAstra prasiddha and not pratyaksha pramANa vishaya and to establish this shAstra prasiddha adhishtAnaM (shAstra pramANa vishaya) we should not and cannot supersede the pramANa vishaya which has already been established by another pramANa i.e. pratyaksha.  Then what we have to establish from the shAstra with regard to nAma rUpa which has the adhishtAnam brahman??  i.e. kAryAkArOpi kAraNa svarUpam eva satyaM…there cannot be an independent existence to nAma rUpa apart from its adhishtAnaM.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
