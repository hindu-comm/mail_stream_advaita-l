On this list, we discussed the upcoming website update at
http://www.advaitasharada.sringeri.net/ a few weeks ago. As you may
remember, the website release was scheduled to coincide with the kumbhAbhisheka
ceremonies of the newly repaired svarNa Sikhara of the Saradamba temple at
the Sringeri Sarada Peetham.

New features of the site include a number of additional texts, such as
pancapAdikA, along with a rare sub commentary, vaktavyakASikA, and the
ratnaprabhA commentary on the brahmasUtrabhAshya of SankarabhagavatpAda, as
well as sureSvarAcArya's vArttika on the taittirIya bhAshya and the
Anandagiri TIkA on the gItAbhAshya. A few prakaraNa texts have also been
included with this release.

Moreover, the current release includes toTaka's SrutisArasamuddharaNa and
the hastAmalakIya too, bringing texts by SankarabhagavatpAda's four primary
disciples into the scope of this digital archive. The vaiyAsika nyAyamAlA
of bhAratItIrtha is also available. naishkarmyasiddhi and bRhadAraNyaka
bhAshyavArttika of sureSvara and other important sub commentaries by later
authors are being worked on, for future updates.

The hyperlinked nature and searchability of the bhAshya texts are
maintained and can be accessed via the link that says "anveshaNam." They
have also removed the login feature, so the texts are available to all,
without having to create a user ID and password to access the site.

Best regards,
Vidyasankar
