The bhAShya doesn't talk about vedabAhya-s, that doesn't mean that it is
not in that purANa shloka. For bhAShya only vimohakatva was needed, since
such was the pratiGYA and only that part needed to explain in the context.
That's why he explained about vaidika-s who stray away, and not about
vedabAhya-s, who are already out of vaidika fold.
The same person can't be vaidika with pApa and vedabAhya at the same time!
