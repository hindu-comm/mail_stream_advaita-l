I have read this and could not get  at its meaning.

There are two types of people : vedAdhikArI and others.
Now, if the quoted purANa says that it was they are for delusion of some to
take them to a-vaidika-mArga, then it is obvious that it is talking about
vedAdhikArI-s and not others.
This tantra-nindA is only for vedAdhikArI-s, so that they don't go on that
path.

again,
तस्माद्धि वेदबाह्यानां रक्षणार्थाय पापिनाम्

विमोहनाय शास्त्राणि करिष्यामो वृषध्वज  १११

Tantras are created for the protection and delusion of Vedabahyas.
What is the delusion that tantras are supposed to be causing to the
Vedabahyas?


regards,
Sarma.
