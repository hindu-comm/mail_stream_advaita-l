Performance of Vedic ritual is to get punya(apoorva). From the bhashya it
appears that this punya can be got by
vedabahya tantras. In addition parameswaranugraha also. What else is
needed? Why janmantara VedanishTha and KRitakRityata.
They can continue to follow the tantras and get moksha. That is what
tantras also say.
So all this circuitous exercise is a lame invention of nanyadasthItivadins.

A number of people who proclaim themselves to be advaitins are prachchanna
purvamimasakas.
They use the advaita as an armour to protect themselves from the onslaught
of buddhists etc.
