How can you reconcile

 1. The Pāśupata and Pāncharātra are both doctrines composed for deluding
   those who are outside the vedic fold

तस्माद्धि वेदबाह्यानां रक्षणार्थाय पापिनाम्

and even if we assume that they will come to the vedic fold in janmanthara
how can some thing
which leads them to vaidica nishtha in janmanthara can be considered as
vimohanaya.. All this appears to be self contradictory.
This was the ruse employed against Lord Buddha. The whole thing does not
make sense.



regards,
Sarma.
