Any copy of this work?
I think that it is identical with *kaulagajamarddanaH *of 
*kRRiShNAnanda-achalaI(giriH/parvataH)*. This work was published years ago
in form of letho. Then it appeared on my website a few years ago.
There is another similar work of *bhaTTojI dIxitaH* called
*tantrAdhikAranirNayaH* which was published from *kAshI* a long ago, then a
better version was edited by *Ashok Kumar Kaliya* and published.
