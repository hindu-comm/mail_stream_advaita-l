That's true. But, only by adhikArI-s.
And, vaidika-s are not adhikArI of tantra. Only deluded vaidika-s  out of
chAturvarNya, and women and and shUdra are their adhikArI-s.

In addition parameswaranugraha also.


You have to know it clearly now:
In advaita-matam, pleasure of Ishvara is puNya and his anger is pApa.
parameshvara does anugraha because even tantra-s are his orders, like
veda-s.
But, what does it bring to present discussion?

For what purpose just IshvarAnugaraha is needed and nothing else is
needed- is being said here by you? Every thing needs causes apart from
puNya-pApa. So, more things are needed indeed.
Don't try to make everything so easy, that will make Ishvara partial to
some people and harsh to some.

That you have to understand, '*svadharme nidhanaM shreyaH paradharmo
bhayAvahaH*' - negates *paradharma*. If some vaidika-s are shunning veda-s
and following tantra-s, they are accruing pApam, because it is negated by
bhagavAn.
So, the puNya gained by tantra-s is also coming with pApam, just as
shyena-yAga comes with inevitable pApam. That's why shiShTa-s don't
perform shyena and hence they shun tantra-s too.

They can continue to follow the tantras and get moksha.


No, I hope that you know that the philosophy of tantra-s is not same as
vedAnta. So, they have to follow veda anyhow!

Every shAstra and every mantra is said to give moxa. But, do any person
with thinking facility accepts them all? No, that's why mImAmsA or vichAra
is necessary.

I think that nAnyadastItivAdinaH can not be used for mImAmsaka-s since they
think before what they say. They test every position.
We may not do the same and blame them, is another thing.

A few of members here are actually so angry and reactive to thinking and
testing of ideas that they utter anything here.

Actually, mImAmsA system is strong enough to protect itself. You need to
study it to appreciate that.
