One other request. When accessing the site from a phone browser, it is not
possible to reach a specific chapter of a text directly. For example if I
want to access the bhAshya to the 18th chapter of the gita, earlier it was
possible to go to the gita bhAshya page which would have drop down links
for each chapter, allowing access to any chapter.

Now, those chapterwise links are not there when accessed through the phone,
nor is there a way to scroll down from the first chapter which is the
default page to the 18th chapter (as each chapter has its own page and
url), so the only ways to get access to a particular chapter is either :

1) to do an anveshaNam using a word that occurs in the chapter, or
2) remember the url for each chapter an enter into the browser page

I don't think this problem is there when we use a pc/mac, only for phones.
If there is some solution incorporated for phone access that would be
great. I'm using a chrome browser on an android phone.

I tend to do a significant amount of reading on trains etc when I don't
have a computer with me, so this would be helpful.

Regards,
Venkatraghavan
