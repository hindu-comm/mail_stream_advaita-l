The sruthi says only this:A pot made of clay will have the qualities of the clay.Shape has nothing to do with the clay 's properties .So to know the property of clay it is enough one examines just a pot made of clay and need not go on examining all different vessels made of clay -jar ,plate and so on.Such an approach is wasteful and not required is what sruthi says.Brahman is the material of this universe and one need not go on examining all its manifestations .An examination of even one manifestation is enough to know about Brahman is what the example of clay and pot conveys.
