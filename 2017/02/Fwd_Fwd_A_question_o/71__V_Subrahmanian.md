Dear Venkat ji,

What you state above is exactly reflected in the Ratnaprabhā gloss to the
BSB 2.1.14 words annotating the vācārambhaṇa shruti: एवकारवाचारम्भणशब्दाभ्यां
*विकारसत्तानिषेधात्परिणामवादः श्रुतिबाह्य* इत्यर्थः । [The shruti by the
words 'eva' ('as mrittikā alone' and 'vācārambhaṇa' by negating the
existence, sattā, of the vikāra, is teaching that the pariṇāmavāda is
unacceptable to Veda. This is clearly because the parināmavādin does not
accept the kārya to be mithyā.]  This clearly shows that the clay, etc.
analogies are not pariṇāma para.

A few months ago there was a Dvaita-Advaita discussion in Bangalore where
Sri MDS and Dr.Maheswaran Nambuthiri were representing Advaita. Asked about
how the clay-pot example is useful to the Advaitin, the reply was on the
above lines, apart from other reasoning. MN, annotating from the work
'Shankara pāda bhūṣhanam' made an interesting observation: Not just in one
place in the beginning 3 places, but repeatedly later too the Chandogya
shruti makes the statement: .....vācārambhaṇam vikāro...ityeva satyam...
thereby reiterating the vivartatvam of all effects.

Another interesting observation made was: The bhūshana kāra has cited the
example of the BG 16th chapter verse:

आत्मसम्भाविताः स्तब्धा धनमानमदान्विताः ।
यजन्ते* नामयज्ञैस्ते* दम्भेनाविधिपूर्वकम् ॥ १७ ॥

to show that the word 'nāmadheyam' of the Chandogya vācā shruti really
means what the Advaitins take it to be:

Shankara's bhashya to the shruti word:

 विकारो नामधेयं नामैव नामधेयम् , स्वार्थे धेयप्रत्ययः, वागालम्बनमात्रं *नामैव
केवलं* न विकारो नाम वस्त्वस्ति ;


Shankara's bhashya for the BG above is:
यजन्ते नामयज्ञैः *नाममात्रैः *यज्ञैः ते दम्भेन

indicating that it is merely a name, an appearance, a show, with no real
substance underlying it. [in colloquial Hindi it is 'nām ke vāste'
https://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20111018060917AAQeQQA]

I have not yet made serious attempts to secure the recording of that
debate.
