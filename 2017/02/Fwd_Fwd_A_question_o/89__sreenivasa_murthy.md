Dear Readers,
 Please permit me to draw your kind attention to mantras 7-25-1 & 7-25-2 and to mantra 7-26-1 of Chandogya Upanishad as well as to the commentaries of Sri Shankara to these mantras. They may throw some light on getting satisfactory answer to the question that is being presently discussed. The observations of the learned members may please be shared with others.With respectful namaskars,Sreenivasa Murthy

Venkatraghavanji - PraNAms

Beautiful. This is exactly what I have been stating. Vidyaranaya too says mRit iti eva satyam - uses the example as vivarta only. In the sloka 8 he is only referring to parinaama as transformation of one clump to pot. That is how I have resolved the apparent contradiction in the two slokas 8 and 49 of Ch. 13, since the rest of the discussion of the chapter is based on only vivarta.

Namaste Subbuji,

Having thought about it, I have come to three conclusions in this regard -
which is a revision of what I had argued for perviously. I will share with
the group:

1) the tAtparya of vAcArambhaNa shruti is also in teaching vivartam (apart
for kAraNa kArya ananyatvam) - the shruti in using 'eva'-kAra, as in
mrittika iti eva satyam, says only the cause is satyam, the effect is not.
If it wanted to include pariNAma too, it would not be appropriate to use
"eva" with respect to mrittikA, because both cause and effect are satyam
for a pariNAma.
2) In the ghaTa drishTAnta, when we are talking about the change in AkAra
from mrit piNDa to ghaTa, that change of AkAra is pariNAma only.
3) When talking of the mrit appearing as ghaTa (ie material), that
transformation is a vivarta - it is only an appearance, and no actual
transformation has taken place. I believe this is what the vAcArambhaNa
shruti is referring to.

vidyAraNya svAmi in 13.8 was referring to (2) above. In 13.46-48, he was
referring to (3).

Thank you.

Kind regards,
Venkatraghavan
