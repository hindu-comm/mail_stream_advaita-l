The two examples are given since the first one is stated in the shruti
explicitly and the second implicitly by the 'vikāro
nāmadheyam...mrttiketyeva satyam..'.  Surely the parinamavadin will not
hold the vikara to be mithya, not-satya.  For him the karanam and karyam
are satya. Both examples, in the shruti context, are for proving the
nirvikaratva of brahman.

Since the tatparyam is nirvikaratvam, the two examples are there to
establish that.

It looks like you are trying to posit an anyonyashraya here, but such is
not the case.

Both. The wording is clear.

The term buddhiparikalpitena is not for the thought arising in Brahman
articulating bahu syam.

Not so. Chetanatvam, as in the BUB 1.4.10 case, too, is only to show that
the world cause can be Brahman. It is admitted in the system that the
actual sankalpa, etc. is due to maya association; a maya vrtti.

It is to make clear that ghata is no more than an akara and a word, which
even the vikaro namadheyam shruti states. In advaita even the process
called parinama is also an imagination just as such a process in dream is
held to be. So, at all stages, Shankara has said in another bhashya, it is
Sat that appears as those stages/objects of transformation. That is why in
all stages of the object the '...it is' is experienced, which belongs to
Sat. It is that reality that one attaches to transformation and effects
which is the cause of samsara that the shruti seeks to remove, correct.
That is why even in the discourse of the transformation of the body, mind,
organs, etc. in this very chapter, the repeated occurrence of '....vikaro
namdheyam....satyam' is found.

I had made that post to which you are now referring as an additional point
the vacharambhana shruti is making: nirvikaratvam.

That is exactly the point. The 'buddhi' takes all into consideration; how
it appears, etc. For this passage, both the pot-creation and the
sarpa-appearance are no different from each other: both are appearances
having names/forms imagined by buddhi.

The point to be noted in respect of mrt example is: the pinda is admitted
to be already a kārya of mrt. And the vijnana of the pinda as non-different
from its kārana mrt. is what is taught as resulting in the knowledge of all
other karyas that will emerge from the pinda which itself is a karya of
mrt. That is why he says  mrido'nyabuddhi. Even the pinda is realized to be
mrdeva just as sarpa is realized to be rajjureva.
