Y'day I had been to some vaidika kAryakrama there someone told me that there is a Taitireeya Ghana pAtaH from one Sri Ati Satyanarayana Murthy from the place called  Tuni (AP).  I heard that it is in Telugu and has 10 volumes in total.  Will it be possible for any prabhuji-s, who is in and around this place  to get more details on this publication ??  In the meantime I shall try all other possible sources as well.

Hari Hari Bol!!!
