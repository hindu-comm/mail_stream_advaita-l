Many thanks Praveen ji for the post. I shall copy this to some other
groups/blogs so that many will come to know that the rope-snake analogy is
an Upanishadic one. The Kaṭharudropaniṣad that is in this list, is cited by
Shankaracharya in his Brihadaranyaka bhashya for a reference on sannyāsa.

warm regards
