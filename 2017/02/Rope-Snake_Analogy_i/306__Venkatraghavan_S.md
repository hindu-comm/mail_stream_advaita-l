Namaste Sri Chandramouli ji,

That a conclusion is a mental construct should not be a surprise. The
conclusion that whatever is pratyaksha must be satya is called into
question by another pramANa, in this case shruti. In the case of the world,
this does not imply that pratyaksha and shruti are in contradiction because
pratyaksha reveals the world's presence, and shruti denies its reality.

YogAchAra would not agree to shruti as a pramANa. SautrAntika/VaibhAsika
would certainly not agree with the mithyAtva of external objects.

Regards,
Venkatraghavan
