Namaste Sri Venkatraghavan Ji,



Your current statement  << The conclusion that whatever is pratyaksha must
be satya >> is different from your previous statement  << the conclusion
that there must therefore
be an object corresponding to jnAna is a mental construct.>>.



There is no reference to *satya* in your earlier statement. Hence my
observation.



Regards
