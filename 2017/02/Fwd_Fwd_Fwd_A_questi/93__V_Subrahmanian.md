Namaste

The vivarta idea 'the object without undergoing any change being perceived
to be something else' is common in all kinds of bhrama-s. The word
'vivarta' need not be employed necessarily. Shankara has used both
rajju-sarpa, shukti-rajata, one moon appearing as two, perception of dirt
in space, sphaṭika appearing as variedly coloured, etc in his bhashyas to
denote bhrama.
