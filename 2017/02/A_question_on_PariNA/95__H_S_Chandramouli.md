Namste Sri Subrahmanian Ji,



This is reg your observation  << The point to be noted in respect of mrt
example is: the pinda is admitted
to be already a kārya of mrt. And the vijnana of the pinda as non-different
from its kārana mrt. is what is taught as resulting in the knowledge of all
other karyas that will emerge from the pinda which itself is a karya of
mrt. That is why he says  mrido'nyabuddhi. Even the pinda is realized to be
mrdeva just as sarpa is realized to be rajjureva.>>,



My understanding concerning the last sentence  * Even the pinda is realized
to be
mrdeva just as sarpa is realized to be rajjureva * is different. In my
understanding of the bhashya, the correct rendering in respect of pinda
should be  मृदित्येव  सत्यम् (mRRidityeva  satyam ) and not  मृदेव सत्यम्
(mRRideva satyam ). In respect of rope-serpent, रज्जुरेव सत्यम् (rajjureva
satyam ) is correct. That is why transformation from मृत्पिणड(mRRitpiNaDa )
to  मृद्घट (mRRidghaTa ) is parinama while that from rope to rope-serpent
is vivarta.



Regards
