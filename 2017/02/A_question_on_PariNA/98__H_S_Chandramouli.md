Namaste Sri Subrahmanian Ji,



English translation by Ganganath Jha of what is cited by you is as follows
(for the benefit of members not familiar with Sanskrit)



<< Just as, in the ordinary world, in the morning, one seesthe potter
gathering clay for the making of the jar etc; and then having gone away to
some other place, and returning in the evening, he finds in the same place
various such articles as the jar, the cup, and the like; and then, the idea
in his mind is that “ all this jar etc was only clay in the morning”; in
the same manner, we have the present assertion – “In the beginning, this
was *Pure Being*.” >>



Please indicate which part of this is applicable in the context of our
current discussion. Is it सदेवेदमग्र आसीदिति (sadevedamagra AsIditi) (“In
the beginning, this was *Pure Being*)  or the part prior to it. I will
respond accordingly after your confirmation.



Regards
