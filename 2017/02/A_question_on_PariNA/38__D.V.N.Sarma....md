Does not Milk and Curds example belong to Arambha
Vada(Nyaya-Vaiseshika).which says cause and effect are different.
Mud and and Pot, Gold and Ring appear to belong to PariNama
Vada(Sankhya_yoga) which says cause inheres in effect and they are not
different.
Only Rope and Snake appears to be genuine Vivarta case.

regards,
Sarma.
