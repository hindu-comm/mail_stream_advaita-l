 Subject: Re: [Advaita-l] A question on PariNAma and vivarta

Dear Sada ji,

In the Chandogya bhashya Shankara has given both clay-pot and rope-snake
analogies together to convey the same purport: Sat alone is real and
anything other than that, whether it is a transformation or a
transfiguration (vivarta), is unreal:

छान्दोग्योपनिषद्भाष्यम्षष्ठोऽध्यायःद्वितीयः खण्डःमन्त्र ३ - भाष्यम्

………प्रभूतं स्यां भवेयं प्रजायेय प्रकर्षेणोत्पद्येय, *यथा मृद्घटाद्याकारेण
यथा वा रज्ज्वादि सर्पाद्याकारेण बुद्धिपरिकल्पितेन ।* असदेव तर्हि सर्वम् ,
यद्गृह्यते रज्जुरिव सर्पाद्याकारेण । न, सत एव द्वैतभेदेन
अन्यथागृह्यमाणत्वात् न असत्त्वं कस्यचित्क्वचिदिति ब्रूमः । यथा
सतोऽन्यद्वस्त्वन्तरं परिकल्प्य पुनस्तस्यैव प्रागुत्पत्तेः
प्रध्वंसाच्चोर्ध्वम् असत्त्वं ब्रुवते तार्किकाः, न तथा अस्माभिः
कदाचित्क्वचिदपि सतोऽन्यदभिधानमभिधेयं वा वस्तु परिकल्प्यते । सदेव तु
सर्वमभिधानमभिधीयते च यदन्यबुद्ध्या, यथा रज्जुरेव सर्पबुद्ध्या सर्प इत्यभिधीयते,
यथा वा पिण्डघटादि मृदोऽन्यबुद्ध्या पिण्डघटादिशब्देनाभिधीयते लोके ।
रज्जुविवेकदर्शिनां तु सर्पाभिधानबुद्धी निवर्तेते, यथा च मृद्विवेकदर्शिनां
घटादिशब्दबुद्धी, तद्वत् सद्विवेकदर्शिनामन्यविकारशब्दबुद्धी निवर्तेते —\\

In the gloss, Anandagiri Acharya too remarks: the first analogy is as per
the parinama vada and the second is as per vivarta vada. So, Shankara does
not make a distinction between the two methods. Ta he context of the above
bhashya is also interesting: It is the sankalpa of Brahman: Let me become
many and create the world. So, the One becoming many is actually the Sat
appearing as many and both the parinama and vivarta prakriyas are fine in
explaining this. Ultimately, Sat alone is real, whether it is seen as the
Karana (clay) or adhishtana (vivarta, rope).

subbu
