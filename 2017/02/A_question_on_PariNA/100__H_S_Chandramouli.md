Namaste Sri Subrahmanian Ji,



I think the appropriate bhashyam part relevant to current discussion  is on
6-1-4



<< यथा लोके एकेन मृत्पिण्डेन रुचककुम्भादिकारणभूतेन विज्ञातेन
सर्वमन्यत्तद्विकारजातं मृन्मयं मृद्विकारजातं विज्ञातं स्यात् । >>,



(yathA loke ekena mRRitpiNDena ruchakakumbhAdikAraNabhUtena vij~nAtena
sarvamanyattadvikArajAtaM mRRinmayaM mRRidvikArajAtaM vij~nAtaM syAt |)



Translation by Ganganath Jha (Just as in the ordinary world, when a single
clod of clay – the material cause of the jar etc – is known, all other
modifications of clay become known by it).



Clay is the material cause of all the modifications including clod,jar,pot
etc. By knowing one such modification, namely clod, all other modifications
of clay become known.



Regards
