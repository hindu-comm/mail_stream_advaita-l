Praveenji - Great and thanks.
I remember Goudapada kaarika or somewhere, the opposite is also referred - snake-rope. where one mistakes it as rope where it is really a snake!

   Namaste,

Further to the discussions about the Shruti examples used for the creation of the world, there was a question raised as to whether the rope-snake example is used by the Shruti.
Here are the Upanishads in which the rope-snake example is used. Some of them are clearly in the context of the creation itself while others are in the context of mokShakAraka jnAna. Please note that all these Upanishads are considered authentic in the tradition since they occur in Muktika's list of 108 Upanishads. And since Shrutis have ekavAkyatA as per siddhAnta, no Upanishad can be placed above the other to disqualify the same.
