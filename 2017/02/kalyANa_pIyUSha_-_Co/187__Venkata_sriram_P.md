Namaste,

There is a traditional commentary in sanskrit on Vedanta Panchadashi called
"kalyANa peeyusha" (कल्याण पीयूष) by Sri.Rayaprolu Linganna Somayaji.

Here is the link:

It is a good commentary which is in line with tradition.  One can go thru this apart from Ramakrishna Pandita's vyAkhya.

regs,
sriram
