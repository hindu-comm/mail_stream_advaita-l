Namaste Sri Nitin Ji,



Translation by Swami Gambhirananda is as follows.



<< Those of sharp intellect on the otherhand who have no obstruction like
ignorance, doubt, and confusion, withregard to the object to be known can
realize the meaning of “ That thou art “ even from the first utterance, so
that a repetition in their case is certainly useless >>,



<< But to one to whom this realization does not come promptly, this very
repetition is meant for bringing about the realization >>.



Since you know kannada, I suggest you refer to the kannada translation by
Sri SSS which can be accessed at the following link  <<
http://www.adhyatmaprakasha.org/php/kannada/kannada_books_toc.php?book_id=101B&type=kannada&book_title=%E0%B2%AC%E0%B3%8D%E0%B2%B0%E0%B2%B9%E0%B3%8D%E0%B2%AE%E0%B2%B8%E0%B3%82%E0%B2%A4%E0%B3%8D%E0%B2%B0%E0%B2%97%E0%B2%B3%E0%B3%81%28%E0%B2%B8%E0%B2%82%E0%B2%AA%E0%B3%81%E0%B2%9F-%E0%B3%A8%29
>>.



Incidentally reg your query



<<  I was wondering if any
of our Acharyas specifically mention this that for Uttama Adhikari, Sravana
directly leads to Jnana and Moksha, while Madhyama adhikari require
Nidhidhyasa and the Mandha adhikari requires Karma+Upasana.>>,



manda adhikari does not require karma plus upasana. Adhikari of whatever
level, uttama/madhyama/manda,  for Brahmavidya is one who has attained
sAdhana chatushtaya. For such a adhikari, karma is not prescribed by
shruti.



Regards
