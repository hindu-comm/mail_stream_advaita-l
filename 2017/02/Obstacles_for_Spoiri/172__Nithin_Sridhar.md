Thank you for the elaborate explanation Sada ji. What I am specifically
looking for is a scriptural reference or a reference from our Acharyas be
it Gaudapada, Shankaracharya, or others, for this specific aspect "For
manda, Vedanta does not produce jnaanam or jnaaa phalam (jjivan mukti). For
uttama adhikaari, he gets both jnaana and jnaana phalam, just by listening
to the teachings, shravanam and mananam".

I want the reference to quote in one of my references. The Karika of
Gaudapada does not specifically mention the above, I was wondering if any
of our Acharyas specifically mention this that for Uttama Adhikari, Sravana
directly leads to Jnana and Moksha, while Madhyama adhikari require
Nidhidhyasa and the Mandha adhikari requires Karma+Upasana.

Regards,
Nithin
