A word that mesmerized Ramana was 'Arunachala'. That word triggered his
quest for the truth and revolutionized his personality.


//
Arunachala

It was apparently by accident that Venkataraman heard about Arunachala when
he was sixteen years of age. One day an elderly relative called on the
family in Madurai. The boy asked him where he had come from. The relative
replied 'From Arunachala'. The very name 'Arunachala' acted as a magic
spell on Venkataraman, and with evident excitement he put his next
question, 'What! From Arunachala! Where is it?' And he got the reply that
Tiruvannamalai was Arunachala.//
