What is Prathipasika? If it is Pratibhasika Satyam yes every thing in the world is Pratibhasika only because it is like a dream object. 

>  however, shankara differentiates between dream and waking world objects and says dream objects donot have even an iota of pAramArthikatvaM in it.  What we see in jAgrat is Ishwara srushti and svapna is jeeva kalpita.  Though these clarifications from bhAshyakAra as an answer to pUrvapaxi, when it comes to vAvakArika satyatvam of jAgrat jagat the adhishtAnam is brahman only.  And again from the PPO, ultimately Atman has the three different avasthA-s and those three avasthA-s are svapna only since our Atma svarUpa is avasthAteeta and nirvishesha rUpa.


Film songs may say World is a dream. It is also correct. But we cannot get Jnana from film songs. It is like a small boy saying E=MCsquared without knowing what is the meaning. Will you learn Physics from the small boy's sayings?

>  sometimes, a punching quote  from novel, a punching dialogue from our favorite hero, a punching line of a song could prompt us to dive deep into the truth embedded in those lines, its all depends on the saMskAra what we have...And an uttama adhikAri can get the realization / svarUpa jnana from those lines who knows??   paramahaMsa rAmakrishna used to get samAdhistiti after hearing some vyAvahArika daily usage word which is remotely related to the 'truth'...
