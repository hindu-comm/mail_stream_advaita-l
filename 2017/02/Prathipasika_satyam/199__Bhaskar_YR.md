praNAms Sri Subbu prabhuji
Hare Krishna

A word that mesmerized Ramana was 'Arunachala'. That word triggered his quest for the truth and revolutionized his personality.


Ø     Thanks for sharing this prabhuji.  I read somewhere (might be in rAmakrishna vachana vea) that uttama adhikAri-s are like bundle of gun powder, a little spark is enough to explode and the source of that ‘spark’ could be from anywhere ☺ Sometimes, repetition of an inert word like ‘mara’ may lead to ‘rAma’ as in the case of vAlmeeki ☺

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
