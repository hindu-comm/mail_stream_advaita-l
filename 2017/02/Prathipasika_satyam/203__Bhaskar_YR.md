Yes Vasanas can be powerful. A drunkard hearing one single word 'drink' can become forced to action of drinking. Similarly, good Vasanas can become activated like hearing a word 'Arunachala' and the person may actually go there.


Ø     Yes, the strong sAtvik vAsana-s /  saMskAra-s  would prompt sAdhaka-s to pursue the matter further.  Getting Invigorated itself may not be ultimate realization but it could be a strong source to tread that path of realization through the direction of guru and saMpradAya.

But Aparoksha Jnana cannot come from Vasana activated by words. Because Jnana is not result of any action. It is only removing wrong understanding.


Ø    Yes again, for that matter even the Upanishad mahAvAkya-s would not bring us the aparOksha jnana afresh, it only illumines what is there already within us by removing the curtain of avidyA.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
