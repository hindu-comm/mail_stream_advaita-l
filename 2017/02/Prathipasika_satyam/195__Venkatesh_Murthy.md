Namaste

What is Prathipasika? If it is Pratibhasika Satyam yes every thing in
the world is Pratibhasika only because it is like a dream object. Film
songs may say World is a dream. It is also correct. But we cannot get
Jnana from film songs. It is like a small boy saying E=MCsquared
without knowing what is the meaning. Will you learn Physics from the
small boy's sayings?

Nowadays Bollywood films are trash quality. They are always copying
some foreign film. I heard the big box office hit Ghazni was copied
shamelessly from English film. Films like Aamir Khan's are anti Hindu
and he is a Muslim fanatic. If he has guts he has to make jokes on
Prophet and Islam like he does on Hinduism and temples. No wonder
because Gulf money and criminals are financing the Bollywood films.
