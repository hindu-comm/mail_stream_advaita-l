I have been blessed to listen vedantic views and reading for couple of
years.  Off-late got a forced break and try to live like a normal person
who dont know any of this..

But finding it very difficult and even in cinema songs linking upanishad
statements. this comes effortlessly when I left these consciously...

 Is this feeling/contemplation of associating vedanta is yet another
prathipasika or a path every one crossed ?   seeking guidance.

Namely,
Venkat
