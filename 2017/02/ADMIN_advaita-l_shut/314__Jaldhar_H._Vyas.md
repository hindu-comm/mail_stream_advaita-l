Best wishes for Mahashivaratri.

Tomorrow, advaita-vedanta.org and all services include the advaita-l list 
will be moving to another server.  So after I finish this email, I am 
shutting down mailman and it will not be available until late Saturday or 
Sunday.

If you send a message and do not get any response, do not keep resending. 
If by Monday you still do not see it then you may or alternatively contact 
me to investigate.

I will post here when normal functions resume.
