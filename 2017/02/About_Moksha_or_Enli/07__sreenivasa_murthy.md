Dear Friends, Enlightenment or moksha can neither be given nor taken. Because It is one's own true svarUpa. Sri Shankara says : nityatvAt mOkShasya sAdhakasvarUpAvyatirEkAcca ||The mumukShu who heeds to this advice of Sri Shankara should resort to know his true svarUpa which is HERE & NOW. It is as simple and straight-forward / direct as that. 

With respectful namaskarams,Sreenivasa Murthy

Kripaji - 

Yes, Jeeva-brahma aikya bodha - 

Shankara says in Vivekachudamani

ya yogena na saakhyena 
karmaNaa nonavidyayaa
brahmaatmaikya bodhena 
mokshasidhyati naanyathaa.

Hari Om!

Thank you for a well reasoned answer Sadanand. When we say everything happens due to daiva/guru anugraha, it should then follow that it is a way of renunciation. But technically, it is only jnana that is responsible for liberation.

Further, when you say inquiry, do you mean jiva-Brahma aikya? Thanks
