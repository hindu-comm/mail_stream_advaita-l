they worship the grave of RM. 

/////////////

It is not grave but अधिष्ठानं and there is difference b/w two.

When shiva linga is put on samAdhi, it is called अधिष्ठानं  and when tulasi is put on 
samAdhi, it is called बृन्दावनं.  

The acharyas of traditional mutts belonging to advaita, v.advaita & dvaita do 
worship their preceptor's अधिष्ठानं & बृन्दावनं as per their traditions.  

There is also traditional aaraadhana paddhati which is done annually 
which is called "तीर्थ नारायण पूजा" to the samAdhi sthala.

regs,
sriram
