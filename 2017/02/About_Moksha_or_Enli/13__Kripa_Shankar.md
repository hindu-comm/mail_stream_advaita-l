‎Namaste Praveen,

My sole purpose is clarifying doubts from the learned. In the process, I have shared my own personal views. Most of what I presumed were proven to be otherwise and I have accepted it. I don't see where the problem lies.
‎
Regards
Kripa ‎

Namaste Kripaji,

I knew on reading the very first mail of yours that your "target" is yet again RM. Unfortunately, your sole purpose on this list seems to be RM. Be that as it may; to each his own. However, you bring an interesting thing up... which points to some more things your are unaware of...

‎I forgot to add this point in previous email. We SanAtana Dharmis don't worship samadhis or offer puja to it. It is strange that in Ramanashram, they worship the grave of RM.

... The "grave" that you think it is, is a samAdhi and although you may be ignorant, samAdhis are indeed worshipped in the orthodox tradition. In fact, there is an elaborate vidhi of processing the body of a jnAni/ sannyAsi to make the samAdhi with abhisheka, rudra, etc, and there onwards.

Kind rgds,
