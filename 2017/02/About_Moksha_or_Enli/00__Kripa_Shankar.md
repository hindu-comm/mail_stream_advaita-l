Namaste,

I have a doubt whether an animal like cow or a monkey get Moksha. I think it is possible for two reasons. One is that, the force or knowledge from previous birth accomplishment. The second is by the grace of Guru. For eg a guru is attached to some animal /pet. In that case, can a guru reward the pet with enlightenment?

‎I hope this did not sound trivial and I humbly request for the standard answer to this doubt. Thanks

Regards
Kripa ‎
