I too had these names (gajendra, jataayu, cow Lakshmi in ramaNAshrama etc.) when the enlightenment has been presented as the sole property of 'manushya jaati' :-) Anyway, it can be argued in another way that the 'mukti' that these jantu-s got is not the 'mukti' in absolute sense (like aham brahmAsmi or tattvamasi type mOksha) but something similar to krama-mukti where in dvaita mukti-s like sArUpya, sAlOkya, sAyujya mukti can be accommodated.  These pashu-pakshi-s  might be BMW (garuda) of vishNu or Rolls Royce (nandi) of shiva or Lambhorgini (siMha) of devi or nano (haMsa) of brahmalOka :-) And tattvamasi enlightenment is anyway unconditionally preserved ONLY for manushya jAti that too who has ONLY vedAdhikAra.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!

ie., even they (animals, birds, reptiles etc.) who take refuge in Me, would reach Me and attain liberation.
The episode of "gajendra moksha" from Bhagavatam is the testimony to that.
