Kripaji - 

Yes, Jeeva-brahma aikya bodha - 

Shankara says in Vivekachudamani

ya yogena na saakhyena 
karmaNaa nonavidyayaabrahmaatmaikya bodhena 
mokshasidhyati naanyathaa.
Hari Om!Sadananda



      From: Kripa Shankar via Advaita-l <advaita-l at lists.advaita-vedanta.org>

Thank you for a well reasoned answer Sadanand. When we say everything happens due to daiva/guru anugraha, it should then follow that it is a way of renunciation. But technically, it is only jnana that is responsible for liberation.

Further, when you say inquiry, do you mean jiva-Brahma aikya? Thanks
