Namaste Kripaji,

I knew on reading the very first mail of yours that your "target" is yet
again RM. Unfortunately, your sole purpose on this list seems to be RM. Be
that as it may; to each his own. However, you bring an interesting thing
up... which points to some more things your are unaware of...

... The "grave" that you think it is, is a samAdhi and although you may be
ignorant, samAdhis are indeed worshipped in the orthodox tradition. In
fact, there is an elaborate vidhi of processing the body of a jnAni/
sannyAsi to make the samAdhi with abhisheka, rudra, etc, and there onwards.

Kind rgds,
