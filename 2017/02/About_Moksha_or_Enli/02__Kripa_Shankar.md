Thank you for the answer Venkatesh. Some say that due to guru's grace (anugraha - to set free) it is possible. What is your take on that?

Namaste

There is no way animals can be awarded Moksha like that. In other
disciplines they may get it like a Guru may take the animal to
Vaikuntha and say it is Moksha. But in Advaita we say Moksha means we
have to only realize Atma by correcting a mistake of thinking Anatma
as Atma and Atma as Anatma. How this realization can happen to animal?
Guru cannot automatically make it happen without teaching. Animals may
not understand Guru Upadesha.

Some crazy explanation may be given like in past life the animal had
studied Vedanta with Guru as a human being and he gets Moksha now. Who
knows what happened in past life?

The second is by the grace of Guru. For eg a guru is attached to some animal /pet. In that case, can a guru reward the pet with enlightenment?
