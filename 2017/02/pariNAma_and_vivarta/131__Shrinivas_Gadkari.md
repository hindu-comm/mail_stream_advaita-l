Namaste,


While we engage in hair splitting arguments about which transformation 
is vivarta and which is pariNAma, I cannot but note that the chAndogya 
upanishad section that relates to this discussion aims to teach "That 
which when known, everything else is known". Assume that these arguments 
are settled. After that will we be anywhere close to the lofty goal 
of achieving the state of "all knowing"? And by all knowing I truly 
mean all knowing - all sciences, arts, technology, astra-shastra, mantra 
- every imaginable vidyA and its siddhi? If the answer to this question is 
a loud "NO", at least a few of us should be troubled that our understanding 
of veda-s and vedAnta is very shallow. 

PLEASE do not respond to this post with hollow statements like - "vedAnta 
teaches that all this is mithyA - so there is nothing to know - except the 
one all pervading consciousness ...". 

Regards, 
Shrinivas Gadkari
