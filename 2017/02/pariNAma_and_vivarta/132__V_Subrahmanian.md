The Mundakopanishat teaches:

ब्रह्मा देवानां प्रथमः सम्बभूव विश्वस्य कर्ता भुवनस्य गोप्ता ।
स ब्रह्मविद्यां सर्वविद्याप्रतिष्ठामथर्वाय ज्येष्ठपुत्राय प्राह ॥ १ ॥

The Acharya clarifies that all vidya-s are revealed by the common
substratum that is Brahmavidyā.  सर्वविद्याप्रतिष्ठां
सर्वविद्याभिव्यक्तिहेतुत्वात्सर्वविद्याश्रयामित्यर्थः
; सर्वविद्यावेद्यं वा वस्त्वनयैव ज्ञायत इति, ‘येनाश्रुतं श्रुतं भवति अमतं
मतमविज्ञातं विज्ञातम्’ (छा. उ. ६ । १ । ३)

इति
श्रुतेः ।

Any knowledge is revealed only only by that Consciousness. Knowledge arises
in the mind as a vritti and this is revealed/illumined by Consciousness.
In this sense it is said that Brahmavidyā is at the base of all vidya-s.
In another sense too, since all vidyas are only vivartas of Consciousness,
the above affirmation stands in tact.
