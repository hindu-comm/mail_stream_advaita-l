Vrushank Vyas
-------------

I am an MS Research student under Professor Navjyoti Singh at Centre for Exact 
Humanities at International Institute of Information Technology, Hyderabad. 
Throughout my undergrad years and on, I have had opportunities to partake in 
various discourses and courses having to do with Indic Arts, Philosophy and 
what could be called the Indic civilization. One of the aims of our centre is 
to find the roots of 'exact' humanities in the way the Indic culture has 
tackled the theories on Arts, Philosophy and other 'softer' disciplines as per 
the modern thought. This exactitude is found in the works of Panini, Bharata 
Muni, Kshemendra among many others. This inspires reverence for Sanskrit, 
among many other widely articulated merits of the language.
