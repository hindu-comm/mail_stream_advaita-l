Namaste

In the work 'Anubhūti prakāśa' of Swami Vidyaranya there is a chapter
dedicated to the discussion of the 'Vācārambhaṇa' shruti of the Chandogya
Upanishad. This is available in the pdf on pages 331 onwards at this link
with Hindi explanation. Those who do not need the explanation can read the
verses:

The part related to the discussion of the three analogies of clay, etc. is
covered from the first verse up to the 25th verse. It is a lucid
explanation and worth perusing.

warm regards
