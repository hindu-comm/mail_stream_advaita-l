In the Taittiriya AnandamImAMsa it is said that when one has vairAgya for a
particular dehaprApta Ananda, his Ananda is 10-fold the Ananda possible in
that dehopAdhi. This shows that all bimbAnanda, experiential happiness, is
also due to reflection of svarUpAnanda. Having vairAgya for something
reduces the bAhyapravRtti towards it and frees the antaHkaraNa from the
kAmavRtti towards such bhogya object. That being so, the duHkharUpa vRttis
that keep one away from svarUpAnanda being enjoyed in pratibimba form, go
away. And to that extent the happiness is increased. So for a jnAni who has
vairAgya from all types of bhogyAnanda of all living beings, he would
experience his svarUpAnanda to the fullest, effortlessly being in oneself,
which is figuratively said as happiness of everyone, since all happiness is
really brahmAnanda alone.

So too, all the sufferings, whether relating to his body or bodies of all
living beings, do not keep the jnAni away from enjoying svarUpAnanda as
pratibimbAnda, as he just a sAkShi of both bhogya sukha as well as duHkha,
completely asanghaH.
