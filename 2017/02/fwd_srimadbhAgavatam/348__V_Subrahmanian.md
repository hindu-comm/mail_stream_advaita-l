Namaste

I am looking for buying or downloading any good rendering of the entire
Srimadbhāgavatam in chanting mode, without any commentary. This is for a
person who wants to learn the pārāyaṇam of the text. As a recorded resource
will be helpful in this endeavor the request is made here to share details
of any such audio. Preference is for a rendering by South Indians, male or
female.

warm regards
