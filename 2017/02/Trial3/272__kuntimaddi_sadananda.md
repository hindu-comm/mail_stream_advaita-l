PraNAms to all.
My posts were not appearing in the list serve and I was trying find where the problme is - It looks like the computer with windows 10 where the Dell has downloaded some new program that does not like adviataL list since I had no problem with advaitin list. I have to find out now what that program is. Anyone has any ideas?
