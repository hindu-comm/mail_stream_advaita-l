Swami Vidyaranya has, in his Jivanmukti viveka, in the Vasanakshaya
prakaranam, mentioned that the South Indians fault the Northerners (brahmins)
for their meat-eating habits and the latter taunt the former for their
practice of girls marrying their maternal uncles and so on. So there is
this 'vasana' to hold one's own practices as high and fault  those of
others as censurable.  Such vasana according to the author  is not
conducive to spirituality.
