Dear Venkata Sriramji,

That way we are all advaitins feel that we are also Shiva. "Shivoham Shivoham" as Adi Shankara's sloka says. Could you find anywhere, where Adi Shankara says that he was an avatara of Lord Shiva. 

Regards,
Sunil KB

 Namaste,

 Though not explicitly, but, indirect mention is found in the
 3rd shloka of 
 shivAnanda-lahari. (as told to me by my Sanskrit teacher)

 त्रयी-वेद्यं हृद्यं
 त्रि-पुर-हरम् आद्यं
 त्रि-नयनं
 जटा-भारोदारं
 चलद्-उरग-हारं मृग धरम्
 महा-देवं देवं मयि
 सदय-भावं पशु-पतिं
 चिद्-आलम्बं साम्बं
 शिवम्-अति-विडम्बं हृदि
 भजे ..............(3)

 Bhagavatpada, while referring to Himself, uses the word 
 "मयि सदय-भावं" ie., exhibited compassion
 towards Him.

 My teacher told me that as Sankara was born with the grace
 of 
 of Shiva and as he took birth in the womb of Aryamba endowed
 with 
 Shiva's kaLa, He considered Himself blessed.

 regs,
 Sriram
