Namaste,

Though not explicitly, but, indirect mention is found in the 3rd shloka of 
shivAnanda-lahari. (as told to me by my Sanskrit teacher)

त्रयी-वेद्यं हृद्यं त्रि-पुर-हरम् आद्यं त्रि-नयनं
जटा-भारोदारं चलद्-उरग-हारं मृग धरम्
महा-देवं देवं मयि सदय-भावं पशु-पतिं
चिद्-आलम्बं साम्बं शिवम्-अति-विडम्बं हृदि भजे ..............(3)

Bhagavatpada, while referring to Himself, uses the word 
"मयि सदय-भावं" ie., exhibited compassion towards Him.

My teacher told me that as Sankara was born with the grace of  
of Shiva and as he took birth in the womb of Aryamba endowed with 
Shiva's kaLa, He considered Himself blessed.

regs,
Sriram
