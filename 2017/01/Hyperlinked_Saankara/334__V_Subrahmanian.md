At another phase the Sureshvaracharya Vartika with Anandagiri Tikā will
also be included in this project. The other Gita bhashyas of Adviatic
interest like Madhusudana's along with the other tika-s for the Shānkara
bhashyam will also find place in this.  I have requested them to eventually
add the Advaitasiddhi with the commentary too.

At a future point the prakaraṇa granthas of Shankara with commentaries will
also be included.

The prasthanatraya bhashya that is available now is of a very great
utility.  Anyone can search now to find if Shankara used a particular
word/idea/shruti smriti passage in his core bhashyas. Such a facility is
not available, I think, at present with regard to the Ramanuja and Madhva
Bhashyas.
