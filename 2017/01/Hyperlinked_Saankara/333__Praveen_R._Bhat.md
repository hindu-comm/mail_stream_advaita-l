Namaste Vidyasankarji,
bcc: Yoganandaji

I am happy to know about this upcoming development, since I was awaiting
the TIkAs. The bhAShyas in unicode have been very useful for my study,
since I type my notes. I am extremely thankful for the same.

I had some interaction with Yoganandaji when I typed out Mundaka TIkA for
my study and he found my via my blogging the same. Unfortunately, I have
not been able to meet him and participate actively. I do hope to see more
TIkAs. Meanwhile, I've begun keying in Chandogya 6th chapter TIkA for my
studies, but it is going slow.

Thanks much to all involved in this wonderful effort.

Kind rgds,
--Praveen R. Bhat
