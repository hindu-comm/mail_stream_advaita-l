I admire the quora author’s enthusiasm, but some of the items listed are quite misleading, and IMHO authors like P.N. Oak, and their fanciful etymologies, are not to be trusted.

That said, there are many evidences of trade and other links between ancient India and other parts of the world.  Augustus Caesar received an ambassador from India in his court.  The “Greek-Kannada Farce” (per B.A. Saletore) found at Oxyrhynchus in Egypt is a play in both languages, and the old-Kannada parts are mostly understandable by modern Kannadigas also.  Saletore also notes that Ptolemy, who gave a geographical description of the world known to his people, names and describes Mangalore and places near it (which were evidently known to Greeks who came to trade).
