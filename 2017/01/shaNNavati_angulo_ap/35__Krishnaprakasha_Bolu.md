IMHO, it would be immature to conclude that Madhvacharya was of 8 feet
height based on the mention of "shaNNavati angulo apetam" (that he was
of 96 angula height). Angula does not translate into inches. In
coastal Karnataka, tulunadu and kerala of those times, danda (kolu)
and angula were used as units of measurement. 1 Angula = roughly 28
inches.

By these calculations, one angula is 1.763 cm which would make 96
angulas 170cm, a more acceptable figure.

This was mentioned in another thread. As this is another topic, I have
posted it as a separate thread.

Regards,
Krishna
