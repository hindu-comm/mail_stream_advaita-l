Man must keep his mind always pure. A pure mind always
wishes well for others. It also enables him to strive to improve his
forgiving nature towards mistakes committed by others.

It is mainly because no one can say with certainty that mistakes
will never happen. Some venial errors do happen even without
your knowledge. Having realised it, you should seek God's
forgiveness and ensure that such mistakes are not repeated.

Likewise, if someone harms us, we should forgive and accept
him back. This way, even one who has harmed us will regret and
purify his mind.

Some people will never forgive anybody. Instead, they will be
ever ready to retaliate. This is a grave error.

Some others will trouble people even if they have done no harm.
Such people will have to reap the result of their sins. As the
saying goes, what you sow, you reap.

So a man of good qualities will hardly ever think of harming
anyone.

We bless all those who understand this well and wish only good
for others in their lives.
