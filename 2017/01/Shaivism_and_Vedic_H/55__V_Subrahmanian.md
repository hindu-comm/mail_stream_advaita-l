The above idea is emphasized in the Mahabharata by Arjuna, in the
Harivamsha by Brahmā and in the Skandopaniṣad where the exact lines that
are chanted during sandhyavandanam are found. The Telugu Sandhyavandana
book printed over 110 years ago also contains these verses.

Shankara has also cited the verses bearing the Hari-Hara aikya in the VSN
bhashya beginning.

What is of interest is that these verses are inimical to the doctrine of
non-advaitins and hence these are dubbed 'tāmasa' or interpolations by
them!!
