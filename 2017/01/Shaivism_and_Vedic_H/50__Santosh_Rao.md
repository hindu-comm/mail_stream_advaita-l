Namaskara,

Is there a difference between "vaidika dharma" and the Shaiva sects?

>From some reading it seems the prevalent academic opinion is that Shaivism
and Shiva worship in general was largely separate from the Brahminical
religion for a large period of history before some coalescing between the
two occurred. Also, while Vaishnavism seems to be heavily tied into this
"Brahmanism," Shaivism seems to be less so. Is there a reason for this, or
is there a discrepancy between tradition and the academic view?

Also, how does the Smarta tradition view the Shaiva agamas? Are they
accepted as authoritative at all? Is there a general view of Shaivas
regarding Vedas and Upanishads, Puranas, etc; or does it vary from sect to
sect? Are there any Shaiva sects that could correctly be labelled as
"non-vedic?"

Thanks,

Santosh
