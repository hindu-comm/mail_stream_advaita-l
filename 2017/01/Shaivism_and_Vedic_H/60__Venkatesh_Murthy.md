Namaste

There is Namaha Sivaaya mantra in the middle of Rudram. Saying Siva is
different and Rudra is different is like saying Vishnu is different
and Krishna is different. In Vedas only Vishnu is mentioned but not
Krishna. Then we should not worship Krishna? This is not correct.
Vishnu and Krishna are the same.  Similarly Siva and Rudra are the
same.
