I understand that there is a pauranic story that Lord Brahma requested Lord Shiva also to create and he created the Ekadasha Rudras. As the creations of Lord Shiva are amar, Lord Brahma requested Lord Shive to create no more. May be some of the list members may know the details as to which purana has this story etc.

 Namaste

 There is Namaha Sivaaya mantra
 in the middle of Rudram. Saying Siva is
 different and Rudra is different is like saying
 Vishnu is different
 and Krishna is
 different. In Vedas only Vishnu is mentioned but not
 Krishna. Then we should not worship Krishna?
 This is not correct.
 Vishnu and Krishna are
 the same. Similarly Siva and Rudra are the
 same.
