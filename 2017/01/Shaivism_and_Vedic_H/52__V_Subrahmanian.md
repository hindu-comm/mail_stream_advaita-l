Here is an excerpt from a Ramanuja discussion group:

//NO CASTE EXCLUSIVITY AMONG VAISHNAVAS

Sri Vaishnavas can come from any caste (e.g) Alvars. Kulasekara was a
Kshatruiya. Thirumangai was also a Kshatriya by birth. Nammalwar was not a
Brahmin. Thirumazhisai Alwar was a Siva Worshipper  earlier. Thondaradipodi,
Periyalwar were Brahmins. The common things that tie them are the observance of
the sacraments of Vaishnavism and the observance of the religious duties of
Vaishnavas.DR.S.M.S.Chari"s well-written book "Vaishnavism, Its philosophy,
theology and religious discipline" will be very helpful to you to gain a
perspective on the details of Vaishnavism. Chapters 8 and 13 are brilliant
summaries of  two important doctrines of Vaishnavism. Chapter 8 deals with
Vishnu and Goddess Sri. Chapter 13 deals with the important subject of
Prapatti.//
