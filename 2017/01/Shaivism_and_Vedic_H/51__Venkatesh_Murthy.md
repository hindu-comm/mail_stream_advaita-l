Namaste

How is it possible to say Shaivism is different from Brahminical
religion when Satarudriya is from Vedas only? It is a useless
argument.

As a matter of fact in Gujarat and other places Vaishnavas are not
considered Brahmins. Only Shiva worshippers are Brahmins. Well known
fact is Brahmins must worship Siva and Kshatriyas Vishnu. Vaishyas are
Devi Upasakas and Sudras have to worship Ganesha.

In Pooja and other matters Vaidika and Agama methods are combined.
This is the way it is today. Nobody in Brahmin tradition is doing pure
100% Vaidika or 100% Agama worship. Non Brahmins must not do Vaidika
worship but always Agama or Puranokta worship only. Ladies also can do
Puranokta worship with Pauranika Mantras. They should not say Gayatri
Mantras and Vedic Mantras like some ladies are doing. It is wrong.
