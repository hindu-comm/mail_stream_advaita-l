Srimad Bhagavatam is not authentic. Further, it is said that, it was
written by a Vaishnava and attributed it to Vyasa. So Vyasa is not it's
original author.

Sridhara swamin has commented on this work. He brings out the advaitic
purport here and there and also holds Shiva Vishnu abheda. He has also
commented on the Vishnu Puranam and says at the beginning itself that this
is a fine source for advaitic knowledge.

Dr. BNK Sharma is reported to have identified Srimad Bhagavatam quoted by
Abinava Gupta in his BG commentary which preceded Ramanuja.
