Namaste,
‎
There are many scholars who have listed a number of ‎reasons as to why Srimad Bhagavatam is not authentic. Further, it is said that, it was written by a Vaishnava and attributed it to Vyasa. So Vyasa is not it's original author.
‎
I haven't read Bhagvatam nor compared it to Mahabharta for it's authenticity. But the revisionists are correct to a large extent, in my opinion.

Another point is that, apparently, Ramanuja and Yamunacharya does not mention this text anywhere. ‎
‎
Do the Advaitins regard it as an authentic work?

Regards
Kripa ‎
