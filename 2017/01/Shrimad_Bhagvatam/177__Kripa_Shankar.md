Thanks for the input. I don't know anything about Sridhar Swamy and so I'll reserve my comment. Any clues as to which parampara he comes from?

The fact that Ramanuja, the foremost among the Vaishnava/pancharatra school has not mentioned Srimad Bhagavatam anywhere weighs down Sharma's (possibly weak) defence. BNK Sharma, to my little knowledge has made many a claims which are not accepted by Advaitins. I am also curious to know the exact reference which he points to.

Sridhara swamin has commented on this work. He brings out the advaitic purport here and there and also holds Shiva Vishnu abheda. He has also commented on the Vishnu Puranam and says at the beginning itself that this is a fine source for advaitic knowledge.

Dr. BNK Sharma is reported to have identified Srimad Bhagavatam quoted by Abinava Gupta in his BG commentary which preceded Ramanuja.
