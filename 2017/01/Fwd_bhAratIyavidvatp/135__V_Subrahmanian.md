That's good. But does this observation of the researcher support the idea
that 'Shankara was criticizing Ramanuja's vishishtadvaita'? Also, the paper
confirms the idea that the Kashmir recension has been there even prior to
Shankara and there have been Kashmir-based commentaries, some five, before.
Sarvatobhadra is also one such pre-shankaran, it appears. Further, the
number of verses and the several different readings identified in that
Sarvatobhadra by the editor lets us think that even in Shankara's times the
Gita-text determination was not a settled issue.
