Dear Scholars,

Sorry to say that instead of selecting my name, i have put
"भारतीयविद्वत्परिषत्" by mistake.  Kindly excuse me.

Namaste,

Apart from commentaries to 108 upanishads, उपनिषद् ब्रह्मेन्द्रसरस्वती has
also authored several works on his iSTa-devata shri.ramachandra.  One among
them is उपेय नाम विवेक which was edited by Dr.V.Raghavan.

Any whereabouts of the digital version would be appreciated.

regs,
sriram
