praNAms Sri Sri Ram prabhuji
Hare Krishna

Thanks for the clarification.  But is there any reference / justification for this 'vidhi' with explanation in any of the texts?? Please let me know.  And it is strange that we are unhesitatingly chanting some of the sUkta-s and maNtra-s which belongs to AraNyaka portion.  For example durgA sUkta, nArAyaNa, medhA sUkta etc. which forms the part of taitireeya mahAnArAyaNa Upanishad.  And during mantra pushpa, we chant yOpAm pushpaM veda which again belongs to taitireeya AraNyaka Prathama prashna (aruNa prashna).  And if I remember right, during navarAtri, in sringeri mutt also during ashtAvadhAna seva to shAradAmba at night, when Upanishad seva offered to devi, Upanishad mantra-s being chanted.  I don’t know whether there is any exception to this 'vidhi' on special occasions.  If possible please share more details on this.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!

 Yes, I too heard this. Whether this rule is  applicable to only adhyApana, adhyayana or parAyaNa or both  ?? If yes, why?? Any specific reason??
