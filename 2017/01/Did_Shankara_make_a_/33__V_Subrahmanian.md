Just one of many such statements found here:

http://www.stephen-knapp.com/were_there_two_buddhas.htm

// Acarya Sri Shankara has by mistake referred to Maya's son, Buddha, as
Sugata Buddha' in the following commentary: *sarvatha api anadaraniya ayam
sugata-samayaha shreyaskamaih iti abhiprayaha. (BSB 2.2.32)//*

Is the above charge been addressed by any Advaitin?

subbu
