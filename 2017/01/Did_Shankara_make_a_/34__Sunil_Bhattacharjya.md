Dear Subbuji,

Lord Mahavira and even the great buddhist scholar and prodigious writer Buddhaghosha  as well as the vijnanavadi Dignaga preceded Adi Shankara but they were very much later than Lord Buddha. Any of these three could also have been called Sugata as in Adi Shankara's time the influence of them was possibly prevailing more than that of lord Buddha, who lived very much earlier. 

Regards,
Sunil KB

 Just one of many such statements
 found here:

 http://www.stephen-knapp.com/were_there_two_buddhas.htm

 // Acarya Sri Shankara has by mistake referred to Maya's
 son, Buddha, as
 Sugata Buddha' in the following commentary: *sarvatha api
 anadaraniya ayam
 sugata-samayaha shreyaskamaih iti abhiprayaha. (BSB
 2.2.32)//*

 Is the above charge been addressed by any Advaitin?

 regards
 subbu
