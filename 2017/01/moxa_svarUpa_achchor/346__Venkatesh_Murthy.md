Namaste

Interesting. One more thing is some Vaisnavas may not want Moksha
only. They say we want to keep on serving and remember the Lord in
every life endlessly. We don't want Moksha but opportunity to serve
the Lord in every life. Some even say we have to keep on getting
difficulties in life because we can keep on remembering the Lord in
the difficulties. In good times nobody remembers God. They say Sankata
Bandaaga Venkataramana.
