Is there evidence of Shankaracharya having destroyed Bhāgavata dharma/s?


In the post referred to below, some alleged purāṇic references are provided
to 'prove' that Shankaracharya is the same as the demon called 'maṇimān
born to a brāhmaṇa, destroying and criticizing 'sat dharma' / 'bhāgavata
dharmas' and criticizing 'sat śāstra-s':

Madhvas also quote purported Garuda purāṇic verses in the same vein as the
above:

The complete text of the Garuda purANa is available here:

http://fiindolo.sub.uni-goettingen.de/gretil/1_sanskr/3_purana/garup3_u.htm

tena saṃkaranāmāsau bhaviṣyati khageśvara /
dharmānbhāgavatānsarvānvināśayati sarvathā // GarP_3,16.71 //

[Owing to this, sAnkarya karaNam, this person will be known as 'samkara', O
GaruDa. He will destroy the complete bhAgavata dharma totally.]


On the basis of the above lines of the purāṇa, is there any evidence within
Shānkara bhāṣyas or any other sources of the writings of other Acharyas
that Shankara:

1. Destroyed Bhāgavata dharmas

2. Sat dharmas

3. Criticized sat śāstra-s.

Also, based on the following verses cited from Garuda purāṇa:

maṇimānnāma daityastu sankarākhyo bhaviṣyati /
sarveṣāṃ saṃkaraṃ yastu kariṣyati na saṃśayaḥ // GarP_3,16.70 //

[A demon named maNimAn will incarnate with the name 'sankara'.  Undoubtedly
he will bring about the samkara, admixture, of 'all'.  The verse does not
say what is meant by 'all'.  It is reasonable to take, from the popular
meaning of the word 'sAnkaryam' that castes will get mixed up and there
will be varNavyavasthA.  So, this maNimAn will bring about such a
situation.  How this happens is not stated in the puraNa.]

Are there evidences in the Shānkara bhāṣyas for Shankara having
taught/supported admixture of castes?

BGB introduction:
अनुष्ठातॄणां कामोद्भवात् हीयमानविवेकविज्ञानहेतुकेन अधर्मेण अभिभूयमाने
धर्मे, प्रवर्धमाने च अधर्मे, जगतः स्थितिं परिपिपालयिषुः स आदिकर्ता
नारायणाख्यो विष्णुः भौमस्य ब्रह्मणो ब्राह्मणत्वस्य रक्षणार्थं देवक्यां
वसुदेवादंशेन कृष्णः किल सम्बभूव । *ब्राह्मणत्वस्य हि रक्षणे रक्षितः
स्याद्वैदिको धर्मः, तदधीनत्वाद्वर्णाश्रमभेदानाम् ॥*

Even if 'sānkarya' pejoratively means the core Advaitic doctrine of 'One
without any differences of any kind', does it amount to 'mixing up of
everything?' Is the Advaita tattva a result of 'mixing up' everything in
creation to arrive at the 'One'? Has Shankara taught anywhere that a mixing
up is what is to be done to arrive at the One (and not negating the
name-forms that are superimposed)?

Also, is there evidence anywhere that there indeed existed an individual by
name 'sankara' (since the puranic verses and the Mani Manjari say that that
person was *named so/well known so*) who matched the personality details of
the well known entity called Shankaracharya?


One can take into consideration this statement, for example, of many, from
Shankara's BSB on the bhāgavata doctrine sūtra:

   - That Vāsudeva is to be attained by worshiping him by going to temple,
   contemplating on him continuously with one-pointed devotion, etc. is not
   refuted/objected to since worship of/ dedicating one's everything to
   Ishwara is taught in the scriptures.
   - A noted Madhva scholar Dr.Anandatirtha Vysampayanacharya Nagasampige,
   Director, Purnaprajna Samshodhana Mandiram, a Bangalore-based premier
   Madhva research institution run under the patronage of Sri Vishvesha Tirtha
   SwamigaLu, the seer of the Pejawar Mutt (whose disciple is the author),
   writes in his popular Kannada book: 'Mata traya sameekshaa':

   // * ಮೂರು ದರ್ಶನಗಳಲ್ಲಿರುವ ಸಮಾನತೆಗಳು:*  ಅದ್ವೈತ-ವಿಶಿಷ್ಟಾದ್ವೈತ ಹಾಗೂ ದ್ವೈತ
   ಸಿದ್ಧಾಂತಗಳಲ್ಲಿ ಸ್ಥೂಲವಾಗಿ ಕೆಲವು ಸಮಾನತೆಗಳನ್ನು ನಾವು ಕಾಣಬಹುದಾಗಿದೆ:  *ವಿಷ್ಣು
   ಪರದೇವತೆ ಎಂಬ ಸಂಗತಿ ಅಚಾರ್ಯತ್ರಯರಿಗೆ ಸಮ್ಮತವಾಗಿದೆ*:

   [The similarities/sameness present in the three systems: In Advaita,
   Vishishtaadvaita and Dvaita, we can see an explicit similarity: - ]

   And has quoted appropriate passages from the works of the Three
   Acharyas.  In respect of Shankara, he quotes the following:

   ೧. नारायणः परोऽव्यक्तात् अण्डमव्यक्तसंभवम् ।

   अण्डस्यान्तस्त्विमे लोकाः सप्तद्वीपा च मेदिनी ॥ [Introduction by
   Shankara to His Gita Bhashya]

   Narayana is beyond the Avyakta; From the Avyakta the Mundane Egg is
   born; Within the Mundane Egg, verily, are these worlds and the Earth made
   up of the seven dvipa-s.

   The Madhva scholar goes on to list other 'commonalities' across the
   Three Acharyas:

   *1. All the Acharyas agree that the Veda is apauruSheya and is the
   parama-pramANa. (he quotes appropriate passages from the works of the three
   Acharyas which substatiate this)*

   2. That Bhakti alone is the means for liberation is admissible to all
   the three Acharyas.  In support of this he quotes Shankara's statement from
   the Gitabhashya 18.65:

   एवं भगवतःसत्यप्रतिज्ञत्वं बुद्ध्वा भगवद्भक्तेः अवश्यम्भाविमोक्षपलमवधार्य
   भगवच्चरणैकपरायणो भवेदिति वाक्यार्थः ।

   //The idea conveyed by the passage is: Having thus understood that the
   Lord is true in His pormise, and knowing for certain that liberation is the
   unfailing result of devotion to the Lord, one should have dedication to God
   as his only supreme goal,//

   3. That karma is subsidiary to Jnana and is the cause for chitta-shuddhi
   is admissible to all the Three Acharyas. The Shankara-passage given for
   this is:

   ....अग्निहोत्रादिलक्षणं कर्म ब्रह्मचर्यादिलक्षणं च अनुग्राहकं भवति
   विद्योत्पत्तये. (Taittiriya Up.Bhashya 1.11)  [for the karmas such as
   Agnihotra, as also the practices of celibacy, etc., undertaken in the past
   lives, become helpful to the rise of knolwedge....]
   -

   Noted Madhva scholar Dr.Bannanje Govindacharya has in several public
   platforms stated that Shankaracharya upheld Vishnu sarvottamatva
   -

   The Pejawar Swamiji, during an address at the PPSM Bangalore, after a 10
   day Vivekachudamani workshop, which I attended, said: All the three
   Acharyas stressed the need for Bhagavad bhakti.
   -

   Shankara is admitted by even other schools to have authored the
   Vishnusahasra nāma bhāṣya. Many devotional works such as the
   Ranganathāṣṭakam, the Viṣṇu ṣaṭpadī, Nrsimha, Jagannātha ashtakam, etc. are
   admitted to be his by even vaiṣṇavas.
   - List given by Vedantadeshika as follows:   पिशाच - रन्तिदेव - गुप्त  -
   यादवप्रकाश -  शङ्कर - भास्कर -  नारायणार्य -  यज्ञस्वामि -  प्रभृतिभि:,
   does not mention 'Shankara' as 'sankara'.
   - The contemporaries of Shankara, Sureshwara and Padmapada do not seem
   to have known Shankara as 'Sankara'. If that was his real name, it would be
   easily known to the followers too, along with his supposed ill-famed birth.
   On the other hand Sureshwara says in the Brihadaranyaka bhashya vartika
   that he belonged to Atrigotra. He also refers to his Guru as the one who
   bore the name of 'Bhava' and 'Vedhāḥ', both names known to be of
   Shiva.There is no name 'sankara' that is one of the epithets of Shiva.
   Padmapada, in his invocatory verse for Panchapadika compares / contrasts
   Shankaracharya and Shiva and not any Sankara.
   - We can also see that all the advaita Acharyas that followed Shankara,
   before and after Ramanuja and Madhva, have invoked the blessings of Viṣṇu
    in one or the other form.
   - If it is true that Shankara had 'destroyed bhāgavata dharma-s', how
   could those who followed him have displayed devotion to Viṣṇu? Even
   Vāchaspati Misra, the author of Bhāmatī, has prayed to Veda Vyasa as the
   shaktyavatāra of 'Bhagavan' Viṣṇu.
   - If it is said 'the writings of Shankara are not to be relied upon for
   the person Shankara was quite the opposite (demoniacal)', then such a
   charge is open to other Acharyas like Ramanuja and Madhva as well.
   - Even a Madhva historian has said that 'in Sringeri the temples to
   Shāradā and Janardana have been there since ancient times.’
   - It is also strange that the purported Garuda purana quote is
   completely silent about Ramanuja:
   - tadā bhūmau vāyudevo bhaviṣyati na saṃśayaḥ /
   yajñārthaiḥ sadṛśo yasya nāsti loke caturdaśe // GarP_3,16.72 //

   [*Then *in the world vAyudeva will undoubtedly take birth.  He will be
   unequalled by anyone in matters of yajnArtha (?) in all the fourteen
   worlds.]
   - Between the four hundred years (that is the meaning of 'tadā',
   'then'!!) that passed after Shankara and before Madhva, Ramanuja had come
   to do the same work Madhva did: of refuting Advaita darshana of Shankara.
   If Madhva is credited to have established 'sat śāstra' by refuting
   Shankara, there is no way one can deny that credit to Ramanuja too. And the
   Ramanuja school has thrived these 1000 years producing great quantum of
   Acharyas and works even as the Madhva school has. Yet, curiously enough the
   author of the Garuda purana takes no notice of Ramanuja and ignores him
   completely, who arrived two hundred years after Shankara and before Madhva.



It is quite understandable, and reasonable too, that the Madhvas value the
listed purāṇic references for the primary reason that they are corroborated
by the real events, names, etc. pertaining to the birth and life and
activities/works of Madhva. Similarly, it would be reasonable to value
those references the Madhvas think are pertaining to Shankaracharya, too
are corroborated by the real events, names, what he did, for example
'destruction of bhāgavata/sat dharmas and his criticizing sat śāstras'. The
'śāstras' Shankara is known to have refuted in the Brahmasutra bhashya are:
mainly sānkhya, nyāya vaiśeṣika, chārvāka, purva mimāmasa, pāśupata,
bauddha and jaina. Are these 'sat śāstra-s'? The pāncharātra has been
critiqued by him on certain doctrinal grounds, but not by denigrating
Vāsudeva. It also doubtful as to whether the pāncharātra that he had
referred to there is the same as what is popularly known.

In the above background one can assess the merit of the purāṇic verses
pertaining to Shankaracharya cited in the post or elsewhere.
