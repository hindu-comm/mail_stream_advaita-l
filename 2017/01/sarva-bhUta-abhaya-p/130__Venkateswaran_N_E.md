Namaste.

At the time of sanyAsa diikSha, the incumbent is said to take a sankalpa of sarva-bhUta-abhaya-pradhAna.

1. What is the scope of this sankalpa? Does it include all life forms?

2. As the very act of living involves himsa to other prANis, directly or indirectly, how is this sankalpa put in practice by a sanyAsi ?  

3. Is its scope only deliberate manasa-vaaca-karmaNa acts leading to himsa, and not accidental ones ? If so, how do we explain chaturmAsya vrata, one of the objectives of which is to avoid accidental prANi himsa during rainy season.

Thanks in advance.
Venkateswaran N E
