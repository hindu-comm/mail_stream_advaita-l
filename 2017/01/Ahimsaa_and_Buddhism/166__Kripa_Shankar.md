Namaste,

Like you have mentioned, there are many references to sacrifice of animals ‎in many Puranas.

However, there were many who misinterpreted the verses and were taken to worship by sacrificing animals where it was not intended. It was Adi Shankaracharya who stopped this form of worship at many temples during the course of his travels.

Example : gomamsam bhakshaye-nnityam pibedamaravArunim
Kulinam tamaham manye chetare kulaghAtakAha
‎
This verse taken literally would mean one eats cow meat and drinks liquor daily are considered kulinam by me (Sadashiva) . Rest after kulaghAtakAhas.

However the actual meaning is one who drinks the nectar by reversing the tongue upwards (kechari mudra) is the best.

The commentators however claimed that Adi Shankaracharya shunned ritualism and promoted contemplative life. Further, the intellectual thieves told us that Buddha was a reformer who taught non-violence to the violent brahmins.

Regards
Kripa ‎
