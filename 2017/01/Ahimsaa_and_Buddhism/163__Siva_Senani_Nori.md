Modern textbooks state that Buddha denounced the hiMsaa in Yajnas. This is so well propagated, that it is now accepted as a fact that Yajnas involve hiMsaa. Such an objection is met with in Niruktam (through the words of Kautsa) and refuted by saying that hiMsaa is injury done outside Yajnas. Then there is a mention in caarvaaka darSana about hiMsaa (if the sacrificed creature indeed goes to heaven, why don't you sacrifice your father?) Beyond these two mentions I do not recall any discussions.
I admit that I have not read Buddhist texts, but I have seen that most criticisms (of sanaatana dharma) are discussed and refuted in different ways in Nyaya, Mimamsa and Vedanta. However hiMsaa does not seem to have been discussed. Please give me pointers to where there were discussed in traditional texts.
Overplaying of this hiMsaa aspect seems to be the result of a modern historian's enthusiasm rather than fact because so many ready arguments are available. For instance, animals are food fir human beings and not all Buddhists are vegetarians (which again are lifeforms). Comments of scholars are solicited.
