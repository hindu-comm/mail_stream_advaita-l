 Namaste,

 Like you have mentioned, there are many references to
 sacrifice of animals ‎in many Puranas.

 However, there were many who misinterpreted the verses and
 were taken to worship by sacrificing animals where it was
 not intended. It was Adi Shankaracharya who stopped this
 form of worship at many temples during the course of his
 travels.

 Example : gomamsam bhakshaye-nnityam pibedamaravArunim
 Kulinam tamaham manye chetare kulaghAtakAha
 ‎
 This verse taken literally would mean one eats cow meat and
 drinks liquor daily are considered kulinam by me (Sadashiva)
 . Rest after kulaghAtakAhas.

 However the actual meaning is one who drinks the nectar by
 reversing the tongue upwards (kechari mudra) is the best.

 The commentators however claimed that Adi Shankaracharya
 shunned ritualism and promoted contemplative life. Further,
 the intellectual thieves told us that Buddha was a reformer
 who taught non-violence to the violent brahmins.

 Regards
 Kripa ‎
