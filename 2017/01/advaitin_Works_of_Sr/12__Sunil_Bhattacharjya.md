Dear friends,

The Mahabharata as published by the GIta Press does contain the statement that the Bhagavad Gita as originally composed was of 745 verses and goes on the say it has 620 verses attributed to Lord Krishna. Mr. Kaul has not read the Mahabharata. well. He is used to telling numerous lies and he thinks that everybody lies.

Bhaskara wrote a bhashya without those missing verses, as whatever he found difficult to handle he left them out.The refutation of that by Shankara (not Adi Shanaka) obviously got limited to that vulgate version. That is why also the Gita press incorporated the commonly available vulgate version. 

Those who do not want to read the original Bhagavad Gita of 745 verses, may very well forget about that. Lord Krishna advises towards the end of the Bhaagavad gita not to talk about the Bhagavad Gita to the unbelievers. 

Regards,
SKB

  Shri
 Sunil Bhattacharjyaji,Jai Shri
 Ram!In your
 response to Shri Venkataraghavan of "Advaita-l"
 lists (appended below), you have saidQuoteTthe
 Bhagavadgitabhashya does not have 745 verses, even
 though the Gita press
 edition of the Mahabharata clearly
 shows that the
 Bhagavad Gita had 745 verses.
 UnquoteThat is a lie of the worst kind since the
 Gita Press edition of the Mahabharata also contains the Gita
 of only 700 (not even 701) shlokas, not to speak of 745
 verses!.It has exactly the same number of shlokas as
 detailed by me in my mail of December 31, 2016, and I
 quoteQuoteFollowing is
 the number of shlokas in each Adhyaya of the
 Gyaneshwari-Gita vis-v-vis the Gita of Gita Press as well as
 the commentary of Aadi Shankara:I=47;
 II=72; III=43; IV=42; V=29; VI=47; VII=30; VIII=28; IX=34;
 X=42; XI=55; XII=20; XIII=35 (as against 34 of Aadi
 Shankara/Gita Press Gita); XIV=27; XV=20; XVI=24; XVII=28;
 XVIII=78.The
 total of all these shlokas of Gyaneshwari--Marathi, comes to
 701 shlokas as against 700 shlokas.UnquoteThe Gita
 of the Gita Press Mahabharata does not have even the
 additional shloka of the thirteenth Adyaya of
 Gyaneshwari-Marathi edition!Why do
 you spin lies to prove your points which you can never
 prove!You have
 also yet to tell us as to how Prof. Narahari Achar has
 "used modern astronomy " to show that Aadi
 Shankara was born in 509 BCE. How long do we have to wait
 for those clarifications?Jai Shri
 Ram!On Mon, Jan 2, 2017 at 4:22

 Dear Vidyashankarji,

 

 I think you have not known that my doubts about the

 authorship of the Bhagavadgitabhashya by Adi Shankara,
 arose

 only after I came to know about Prof. Karmarkar's
 analysis.

 It looks as if due to prejudice many have not cared to
 read

 the paper of Karmarkar. So there is no case of

 force-fitting, and it was only the open way of examining
 new

 information.

 

 Good that now I find that the general opinion is that
 Sri

 Vidyashankar had not written any text. But there must be

 some reason why both the Kudali Sringeri and the
 Sringeri

 mathas have the grand Vidyashankar temples in their

 premises, but similar honour to the other
 post-AdiShankara

 pontiffs are miising. 

 

 Regarding Nava Shankara or Abhinava Shankara, it was
 Shri

 Pathak who got the three page document on that according
 to

 which this Nava Shankara was born in 788 CE. Shri Pathak

 published a paper on that. It is interesting to see that
 the

 Sringeri matha also claimed the date of their first

 mathadhipati from that time. This probably gave an

 impression to some scholars like Udaivir Shastri that
 the

 Sringeri math was established by this Abhinava Shankara.

 Abhinava Shankara, for your kind information is one of
 the

 pontiffs of the Kanchi Kamakoti matha.

 

 As regards Shri Niranjan Saha's paper I wrote back to
 him in

 private as he asked for a review of his paper. I am yet
 to

 hear from Shri Saha. 

 

 I don't condemn the mathas other than the Sringeri
 matha,

 and I also look with an open mind at what others are
 saying,

 even if they differ from the opinion of the Sringeri,
 for

 which I have great respect. I wish I belonged to the
 inner

 circle of the Shringeri matha, so that I could have
 helped

 the matha to undo the wrongs the historians had done to
 that

 matha. 

 

 Regards,

 Sunil KB

Dear

Sunilji,

In general, if you want to answer questions of

textual and historical import, you have to have a more

 solid

basis first to ask questions, not just some doubts and

hunches. Secondly, you should try not to force fit data
 to

preconceived conclusions.

It looks like you are determined, somehow or

the other, to come up with a different author for the

gItAbhAshya than Adi Sankara. So, in your estimation,
 it

must be anybody else, either an entirely mythical and

non-historical abhinava Sankara or the historical

vidyASankara who has traditionally not been known to
 have

written any texts at all. 

Our list member, Niranjan Saha, has already

shared with you, by private email, a very recent paper

surveying the academic scholarly output regarding the

authorship of the gItAbhAshya. Please read it with some

care.

I don't understand why you would throw out

both the tradition that says that this bhAshya is by
 Adi

Sankara and also the bulk of the modern scholarship
 that

concludes that this traditional attribution is right.

Instead, you are basing your argument upon a solitary

 paper

that is now quite outdated, along with a highly

 speculative

attempt at reconstructing history. The entire exercise
 is

very strange indeed!

Best regards,



Vidyasankar

Namaste

Venkataraghavanji,







Thank you for your mail. may I request you kindly to
 send

 me

a photocopy of T.K. Gopalaswamy Aiyengar's
 paper

titled "BhAskara on the



Gita" presented at the GIta SamIkshA conference held
 in

Tirupati on March, 1970.







Would you think that Abhinava Shankara, another very

 famous

avatara of Adi Shankaracharya, could have written the

Bhagavadgita bhashya, if and when all evidences confirm

that a fresh bhashya on the Bhagavadhita was needed
 to

 be

written by Sri Vidyashankara to refute Sri

Ramabujacharya's Bhagavadgitabjashya, as one
 advaitic

bhashya was already therein Sri ramanujacharya's
 time.

This will be satisfy the objection that language style
 of

the Bhagavadgitabhshya was different for Adi
 Shankara's

other bhashyas.







Tthe Bhagavadgitabhashya does not have 745 verses, even

though the Gita press edition of the Mahabharata
 clearly

shows that the Bhagavad Gita had 745 verses. One

 possibility

is that Sri Vidyashankara had just to refute only the

version with 700 verses on which Sri Ramanujacharya
 wrote

his bhashya. But if any one before Sri Ramanujacharya

wrote the advaitic bhashya on the Bhagavadgita, then
 the

question as to why the 45 verses were omitted still

stands,







Regards,



Sunil KB

Namaste,



One thing we can use to determine objectively



if Shankara bhagavatpAda



wrote the gIta



bhAshya, or if it was a later advaitin in his

tradition,



is



to see if there is any evidence from



other commentators that are



chronologically



proximate to him.







It is



widely accepted that BhAskara, a bhedAbhedavadin, who

is



said to have



lived around c. 800 AD



("BhAskara the VedAntin", Daniel Ingalls),
 is

a



close contemporary of Shankaracharya. BhAskara



quotes Shankara's brahma



sUtra bhAshya



quite extensively in his own bhAshya to this
 prasthAna.



BhAskara, in turn, is quoted by VAcaspati



Mishra in BhAmati. Therefore, he



must have



lived between Shankara's and VAcaspati's



lifetimes.







Now turning to



the question if there are any references to

Shankara's



gIta



bhAshya in any of BhAskara's works.



Unfortunately, not too many surviving



works



of BhAskara are available to us. Thankfully, there
 are

some



fragments



available from his gIta bhAshya (9



chapters of his gIta bhAshya are



published



by the Benares Sanskrit University, edited by Dr.



Subhadropadhyaya, 1964).







In the few fragments of the BhAskara gIta



bhAshya available today, there is



one



interesting comment he makes when commenting on sloka



2.21:



वेदाविनाशिनं



नित्यं य

एनमजमव्ययम्



।



कथं स पुरुषः



पार्थ कं घातयति

हन्ति



कम् ॥ २१ ॥







These are Shankara's words in his



commentary to the bhAshya:

हेत्वर्थस्य



च



अविक्रियत्वस्य



तुल्यत्वात् *विदुषः



सर्वकर्मप्रतिषेध
 एव



प्रकारणार्थः



अभिप्रेतो भगवता*



।







Turning to BhAskara, he



quotes Shankara in the bhAshya to the same verse:



अत्र क्लेशभीरव:



केचित् स्वमतं



भगवत्यारोप्य



वर्णयन्ति *विदुष:



सर्वकर्मप्रतिषेध



एव



 
 प्रकरणार्थोSभिप्रेतो



भगवता* इति.







In commenting on this verse, BhAskara



criticises Shankara's bhAshya by



saying



that Shankaracharya is simply attributing his own
 views

onto



Lord



Krishna when he says "in this



context, Krishna's view is that for the wise



person total renunciation of karma is



prescribed".







Its quite



clear here that BhAskara is quoting Shankara's
 gIta



bhAshya



verbatim. Given that BhAskara also



quotes Shankara in his Brahma sUtra



bhAshya,



we can conclude that the Shankara that wrote the gIta



bhAshya must



have lived at the same time as



the Shankara that wrote the brahma sUtra



bhAshya. A reasonable simplification to make is



that it is indeed the same



person.







(The above references to



BhAskara's bhAshya and his quotation of



Shankara's



bhAshya are from T.K.



Gopalaswamy Aiyengar's paper titled
 "BhAskara

on



the



Gita" presented at the GIta



SamIkshA conference held in Tirupati on March



1970. The proceedings of the conference have



been published by Sri



Venkateswara



University, Tirupati. It is available in electronic

form



at



archive.org)







Regards,



Venkatraghavan
