Dear Subbuji,

Yes, in the beginning  it appeared like that to me also and that is why I wondered if Sri Vidyashankara, considered by many to be an avatara of Adi Shankara, could have been the author of the Bhagavadgitabhashya. Thanks to a member of the group, who let us know about the paper of Aiyengar, On going through that I realized that it was not Sri Vidyashankara, but Sri Abhinava Shankara (also considered an avatara of Adi Shankaracharya), was the person, who composed the Bhagavadgitabhashya. I understand some advaitins consider Sri Abhinava Shankara to be no lesser scholar that Adi Shankara.

Regards,
Sunil KB

       The concluding observations of
 Prof. Karmarkar clearly show that he was convinced that the
 Advaita Gita commentary had come later than that of
 Ramanuja. But we have seen that is not true since there is
 incontrovertible evidence in Ramanuja's commentary to BG
 2.12 criticizing the Advaitin's view of that very verse.
 This is enough to show that the Prof's conclusions are
 not worthy of serious consideration.

 It is to be further pointed out that
 the following instances of Shankara using the first person

 All
 the above verses are commented upon by
 Anandagiri.
 So
 also the verses at the beginning of the Taittiriya bhashya
 that Karmarkar thinks are suspect:

 पदवाक्यप्रमाणतः ।

 सर्ववेदान्तास्तान्नित्यं

 Great observation, Subbuji. Another pillar
 supporting the different author theory falls.
 This is why I find the determination
 of authorship based on linguistic styles, fraught with
 difficulties. It's subjective, immensely hard to prove,
 and as has been demonstrated, quite easy to
 disprove.

 In the
 Karmarkar paper, the author, at the beginning makes an
 observation about the first-person usage by Shankara and
 says (apart from the Gitabhashua introduction) nowhere is
 such a usage made. However, we find in the Taittiriya
 bhāṣya Shankara refers to himself in the first person
 singular:
 एतदेव
 मे स्वस्त्ययनम् -
 यन्मामेकयोगिनमनेकयोगिबहुप्रतिप
 क्षमात्थ । अतोजेष्यामिसर्वान्
 ; आरभे च चिन्ताम्
 ॥
 Translation: This itself is a
 benediction to me that which you proclaim that I am a monist
 confronted with a number of dualists opposed to me. Hence I
 shall win all of them and shall commence the
 discourse.
 The
 highlighted words are all in the singular first person
 usage, whether it is a noun or a verb.
 This and the Gita instance are the
 only two of this type, in my observation.

 Namaste Sri Vidyasankar,

 Thanks for your comments. The reference to devatA mArga in
 the gIta bhAshya

 does address Prof. Karmarkar's comment.



 The common wording between the adhyAsa and kshetrajna
 bhAshyas is also

 noteworthy. Thanks for pointing out.



 Another recurring theme that comes to mind is the
 "whose is avidya"

 discussion that occurs in the gIta (13.2), BrihadAraNyaka
 (4.1.6) and sUtra

 bhAshyas (4.1.3). Prof Ingalls has written a paper on this
 very topic.

 Dear Sri Venkataraghavan,



 Thank you for the detailed analysis of the points raised by
 Karmarkar's

 paper.



 For the last point in your list, please note that the
 gItAbhAshya 8th

 chapter says, devatA eva mArgabhUtA iti sthito (a)nyatra.
 Thus, the author

 is here making a reference to another work where the
 devayAna and pitRyAna

 are discussed. That work has got to be the brahmasUtra
 bhAshya or one of

 the upanishad bhAshyas.



 And I would also like to draw attention to the wording used
 in the kshetra

 kshetrajna yoga chapter, which mirrors that of the
 adhyAsabhAshya -

 yushmadasmad pratyaya, tamaHprakASavad viruddha, etc.



 As such, my considered view is that no careful or impartial
 scholar can

 ever conclude that the gItAbhAshya could have been written
 by someone else!



 Best regards,

 Vidyasankar
