Dear friends,

Mahabharata did say that  the Bhagavad gita had 745 verses and Lord Krishna was attributed 620 verses etc. I have  never changed my statement and only given the detail about the number of verses attributed to Lord Krishna in the second mail. 

As regards the Critical edition of the Mahabharata I have written in the past many times that the chief editor of the critical edition, Dr. Sukhtankar, made the decision that only those verses which were common in all versions will be included in the critical edition. The rest of the verses will be added as extra. But unfortunately for him (Dr. Sukhtankar), when he gave the last four-lectures series of talk on the Mahabharata, in the Asiatic Siciety in Bombay (Mumbai), he could deliver the first three and expired in the morning of the fourth day, when the last lecture was to be delivered. The editor of the series of these lectures included the Dr. Sukhtankar's note of the fourth lecture to be delivered and added the preface to the booklet, in which the all the details of the lectures were included. . The editor mentioned in the preface, that Dr. Sukhtankara negated all that he was upholding during the making of the critical edition that the the verses not commonly found were not authentic. 

It appears to me that the shock was too much on Dr, Sukhtankar at the late realization of his folly as he quoted in the lecture, mostly the verses which he earlier thought to be not genuine, and the poor man had a heart attack in the morning, he was to deliver the last lecture.

Now, my request to moderatorji :

I do  not want to continue on this topic with Kaul. If it is personal mail he can write to my personal mail. If he writes to the group let him address his mails to all the members. . But if Mr. kaul makes false accuasations as he had several times in the past,   please do  not stop me from replying and exposing him.  THis is my request

Regards,
Sunil KB

       Shri
 Sunil Bhattacharjyaji,Jai Shri
 Ram!Your
 earlier statement wasQuoteTheBhagavadgitabhashya does not have 745
 verses, eventhough the Gita Press edition of the
 Mahabharata clearlyshows that theBhagavad Gita had 745
 verses.UnquoteNow you have changed it to "The
 Mahabharata as published by the Gita Press does contain the
 statement that the Bhagavad Gita as originally composed was
 of 745 verses and goes on the say it has 620 verses
 attributed to Lord Krishna".
 I have given you all the details as to how
 all the editions of Bhagvadgita---including the one
 enshrined in the Mahabharata itself published by Gita Press---- have only 700 shlokas.
 The five shlokas in the
 Mahabharata in Bhishma parva---Adyaya 43---attributed to
 Vaishampayana that Bhgwan Krishna had said 620 verses and so
 on thus making the total 745 shlokas fly in the very face of
 the Mahabharata itself, since it contains only 700
 shlokas!The editors of the Gita Press edition have
 indicated in the footnote of Adyaya 43 of Bhishma Parva that
 these five shlokas claiming the Gita to be having 745
 shlokas are not to be found in most of the manuscripts.
 For that matter, the BORI
 edition of the Mahabharata also does not contain these
 shlokas supposed to proclaim that the Gita had 745
 shloks!Above all, I have given you all the proofs
 that the Gyaneshwari in Marathai, that has been published
 from Marathi manuscripts of Shaka 1337 i.e. about 1259 AD
 has only 701 shlokas. It does not talk about 745 shlokas
 at all!That also confirms that these five shlokas
 claiming that the Gita had 745 shlokas are later
 interpolations in the Mahabharata!I have also checked the
 Mahaharata--Nilakantha Bhashya. That also contains the
 Gita of 700 shlokas and not 745 shlokas! Though the five
 shlokas of the claim that the Gita has 745 shlokas do appear
 in the 43rd Adyaya of Nilakantha Bhashya also, but this is
 what Nilakantha has said in his commentary
 Thus you are trying to base your arguments
 on some "facts" which are in fact worse than
 fiction!On top of it, you are making insinuations
 with comments like, "But if any one before Sri
 Ramanujacharya wrote the advaitic bhashya on the
 Bhagavadgita, thenthequestion as to why the 45 verses
 were omitted still​
 stands​​"​!They
 were "omitted" for the simple reason that the real
 Gita of the Mahabhaata has only 700
 shlokas!
 Please
 therefore avoid such speculations as they are highly
 damaging to the Hindu ethos, especially to the spirit of the
 advaitin forum of Aadi Shankara!
 Jai Shri Ram!Avtar Krishen Kaul

       Dear friends,



 The Mahabharata as published by the GIta Press does contain
 the statement that the Bhagavad Gita as originally composed
 was of 745 verses and goes on the say it has 620 verses
 attributed to Lord Krishna. Mr. Kaul has not read the
 Mahabharata. well. He is used to telling numerous lies and
 he thinks that everybody lies.



 Bhaskara wrote a bhashya without those missing verses, as
 whatever he found difficult to handle he left them
 out.The refutation of that by Shankara (not Adi
 Shanaka) obviously got limited to that vulgate version. That
 is why also the Gita press incorporated the commonly
 available vulgate version. 



 Those who do not want to read the original Bhagavad Gita of
 745 verses, may very well forget about that. Lord Krishna
 advises towards the end of the Bhaagavad gita not to talk
 about the Bhagavad Gita to the unbelievers. 



 Regards,

 SKB

  Shri

  Sunil Bhattacharjyaji,Jai Shri

  Ram!In your

  response to Shri Venkataraghavan of
 "Advaita-l"

  lists (appended below), you have saidQuoteTthe

  Bhagavadgitabhashya does not have 745 verses, even

  though the Gita press

  edition of the Mahabharata clearly

  shows that the

  Bhagavad Gita had 745 verses.

  UnquoteThat is a lie of the worst kind since the

  Gita Press edition of the Mahabharata also contains the
 Gita

  of only 700 (not even 701) shlokas, not to speak of 745

  verses!.It has exactly the same number of shlokas as

  detailed by me in my mail of December 31, 2016, and I

  quoteQuoteFollowing is

  the number of shlokas in each Adhyaya of the

  Gyaneshwari-Gita vis-v-vis the Gita of Gita Press as well
 as

  the commentary of Aadi Shankara:I=47;

  II=72; III=43; IV=42; V=29; VI=47; VII=30; VIII=28;
 IX=34;

  X=42; XI=55; XII=20; XIII=35 (as against 34 of Aadi

  Shankara/Gita Press Gita); XIV=27; XV=20; XVI=24;
 XVII=28;

  XVIII=78.The

  total of all these shlokas of Gyaneshwari--Marathi, comes
 to

  701 shlokas as against 700 shlokas.UnquoteThe Gita

  of the Gita Press Mahabharata does not have even the

  additional shloka of the thirteenth Adyaya of

  Gyaneshwari-Marathi edition!Why do

  you spin lies to prove your points which you can never

  prove!You have

  also yet to tell us as to how Prof. Narahari Achar has

  "used modern astronomy " to show that Aadi

  Shankara was born in 509 BCE. How long do we have to
 wait

  for those clarifications?Jai Shri

 Dear Vidyashankarji,



  



  I think you have not known that my doubts about the



  authorship of the Bhagavadgitabhashya by Adi Shankara,

  arose



  only after I came to know about Prof. Karmarkar's

  analysis.



  It looks as if due to prejudice many have not cared to

  read



  the paper of Karmarkar. So there is no case of



  force-fitting, and it was only the open way of
 examining

  new



  information.



  



  Good that now I find that the general opinion is that

  Sri



  Vidyashankar had not written any text. But there must
 be



  some reason why both the Kudali Sringeri and the

  Sringeri



  mathas have the grand Vidyashankar temples in their



  premises, but similar honour to the other

  post-AdiShankara



  pontiffs are miising. 



  



  Regarding Nava Shankara or Abhinava Shankara, it was

  Shri



  Pathak who got the three page document on that
 according

  to



  which this Nava Shankara was born in 788 CE. Shri
 Pathak



  published a paper on that. It is interesting to see
 that

  the



  Sringeri matha also claimed the date of their first



  mathadhipati from that time. This probably gave an



  impression to some scholars like Udaivir Shastri that

  the



  Sringeri math was established by this Abhinava
 Shankara.



  Abhinava Shankara, for your kind information is one of

  the



  pontiffs of the Kanchi Kamakoti matha.



  



  As regards Shri Niranjan Saha's paper I wrote back
 to

  him in



  private as he asked for a review of his paper. I am
 yet

  to



  hear from Shri Saha. 



  



  I don't condemn the mathas other than the Sringeri

  matha,



  and I also look with an open mind at what others are

  saying,



  even if they differ from the opinion of the Sringeri,

  for



  which I have great respect. I wish I belonged to the

  inner



  circle of the Shringeri matha, so that I could have

  helped



  the matha to undo the wrongs the historians had done
 to

  that



  matha. 



  



  Regards,



  Sunil KB

 Dear



 Sunilji,



 In general, if you want to answer questions of



 textual and historical import, you have to have a
 more



  solid



 basis first to ask questions, not just some doubts
 and



 hunches. Secondly, you should try not to force fit
 data

  to



 preconceived conclusions.



 It looks like you are determined, somehow or



 the other, to come up with a different author for
 the



 gItAbhAshya than Adi Sankara. So, in your
 estimation,

  it



 must be anybody else, either an entirely mythical
 and



 non-historical abhinava Sankara or the historical



 vidyASankara who has traditionally not been known
 to

  have



 written any texts at all. 



 Our list member, Niranjan Saha, has already



 shared with you, by private email, a very recent
 paper



 surveying the academic scholarly output regarding
 the



 authorship of the gItAbhAshya. Please read it with
 some



 care.



 I don't understand why you would throw out



 both the tradition that says that this bhAshya is
 by

  Adi



 Sankara and also the bulk of the modern scholarship

  that



 concludes that this traditional attribution is
 right.



 Instead, you are basing your argument upon a
 solitary



  paper



 that is now quite outdated, along with a highly



  speculative



 attempt at reconstructing history. The entire
 exercise

  is



 very strange indeed!



 Best regards,



 



 Vidyasankar

 Thank you for your mail. may I request you kindly

 Would you think that Abhinava Shankara, another

 This will be satisfy the objection that language
 style

 the Bhagavadgitabhshya was different for Adi

 other bhashyas.



 



 



 



 Tthe Bhagavadgitabhashya does not have 745 verses,
 even



 though the Gita press edition of the Mahabharata

 shows that the Bhagavad Gita had 745 verses. One



  possibility



 is that Sri Vidyashankara had just to refute only
 the

 Date: Saturday, December 31, 2016, 10:06 AM



 



 



 



 Namaste,



 



 One thing we can use to determine objectively



 



 if Shankara bhagavatpAda



 



 wrote the gIta



 



 bhAshya, or if it was a later advaitin in his



 tradition,



 



 is



 



 to see if there is any evidence from



 



 other commentators that are



 



 chronologically



 



 proximate to him.



 



 



 



 It is



 



 widely accepted that BhAskara, a bhedAbhedavadin,
 who



 is



 



 said to have



 



 lived around c. 800 AD



 



 ("BhAskara the VedAntin", Daniel
 Ingalls),

  is



 a



 



 close contemporary of Shankaracharya. BhAskara



 



 quotes Shankara's brahma



 



 sUtra bhAshya



 



 quite extensively in his own bhAshya to this

  prasthAna.



 



 BhAskara, in turn, is quoted by VAcaspati



 



 Mishra in BhAmati. Therefore, he



 



 must have



 



 lived between Shankara's and VAcaspati's



 



 lifetimes.



 



 



 



 Now turning to



 



 the question if there are any references to



 Shankara's



 



 gIta



 



 bhAshya in any of BhAskara's works.



 



 Unfortunately, not too many surviving



 



 works



 



 of BhAskara are available to us. Thankfully,
 there

  are



 some



 



 fragments



 



 available from his gIta bhAshya (9



 



 chapters of his gIta bhAshya are



 



 published



 



 by the Benares Sanskrit University, edited by Dr.



 



 Subhadropadhyaya, 1964).



 



 



 



 In the few fragments of the BhAskara gIta



 



 bhAshya available today, there is



 



 one



 



 interesting comment he makes when commenting on
 sloka



 



 2.21:



 



 वेदाविनाशिनं



 



 नित्यं य



 एनमजमव्ययम्



 



 ।



 



 कथं स पुरुषः



 



 पार्थ कं घातयति



 हन्ति



 



 कम् ॥ २१ ॥



 



 



 



 These are Shankara's words in his



 



 commentary to the bhAshya:



 हेत्वर्थस्य



 



 च



 



 अविक्रियत्वस्य



 



 तुल्यत्वात्
 *विदुषः



 



 सर्वकर्मप्रतिषेध

  एव



 



 प्रकारणार्थः



 



 अभिप्रेतो भगवता*



 



 ।



 



 



 



 Turning to BhAskara, he



 



 quotes Shankara in the bhAshya to the same verse:



 



 अत्र क्लेशभीरव:



 



 केचित् स्वमतं



 



 भगवत्यारोप्य



 



 वर्णयन्ति *विदुष:



 



 सर्वकर्मप्रतिषेध



 



 एव



 



  

  प्रकरणार्थोSभिप्रेतो



 



 भगवता* इति.



 



 



 



 In commenting on this verse, BhAskara



 



 criticises Shankara's bhAshya by



 



 saying



 



 that Shankaracharya is simply attributing his own

  views



 onto



 



 Lord



 



 Krishna when he says "in this



 



 context, Krishna's view is that for the wise



 



 person total renunciation of karma is



 



 prescribed".



 



 



 



 Its quite



 



 clear here that BhAskara is quoting
 Shankara's

  gIta



 



 bhAshya



 



 verbatim. Given that BhAskara also



 



 quotes Shankara in his Brahma sUtra



 



 bhAshya,



 



 we can conclude that the Shankara that wrote the
 gIta



 



 bhAshya must



 



 have lived at the same time as



 



 the Shankara that wrote the brahma sUtra



 



 bhAshya. A reasonable simplification to make is



 



 that it is indeed the same



 



 person.



 



 



 



 (The above references to



 



 BhAskara's bhAshya and his quotation of



 



 Shankara's



 



 bhAshya are from T.K.



 



 Gopalaswamy Aiyengar's paper titled

  "BhAskara



 on



 



 the



 



 Gita" presented at the GIta



 



 SamIkshA conference held in Tirupati on March



 



 1970. The proceedings of the conference have



 



 been published by Sri



 



 Venkateswara



 



 University, Tirupati. It is available in
