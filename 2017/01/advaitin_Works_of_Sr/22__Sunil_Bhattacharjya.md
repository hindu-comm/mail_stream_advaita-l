 As regards the bounced
 mails, I have seen my mails being bounced from the
 advaitagroup during the last few days and that is the fact
 and the bounced mails are still in my trash. If you have
 no hand in that, may be any of your other moderators could
 have done that. Kindly check.

 Mails would bounce back if the mail exceeds the
 stipulated size. If we donâ€™t edit or cut the unnecessary
 portion from the previous tail of mails it will bounce back
 and you would get the mesg. that your mail is waiting for
 moderator's approval. Please cut short your mails and
 try. I hope it would work since in Advaita-L, no
 moderator would involve in this task unlike advaitin list.


 Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
