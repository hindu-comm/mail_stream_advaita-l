Namaste,

Even to sing the praises of viSNu, one needs the akSara-samAmnAya whose source is
mAhEshwara sutrANi.

Without mAhEshwara sutrANi, one cannot imagine the existence of vyAkaraNa and 
other  scriptural texts.  

Why on earth people fight among each other about the greatness of viSNu or shiva ?

 regs,
sriram
