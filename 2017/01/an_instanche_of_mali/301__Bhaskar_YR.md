praNAms Sri Nithin prabhuji
Hare Krishna

Kindly let me know what you have written in this article as I am not able to read this blog.  Whether there is a reference to ‘animal sacrifice’ in our shrauta yAga-s or it is only pishta pashu said in shrauta formalities.  Is the animal sacrifice and eating the same as a normal food is strictly prohibited in our scriptures / dharma shAstra-s??  If It is yes, then we have the sound reason to counter the scholars who are announcing that ‘ahimsA’ and non-vegetarianism are the contribution of jains and was not the regular practice of ancient hindu tradition.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
