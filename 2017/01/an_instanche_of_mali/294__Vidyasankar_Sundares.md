 is believed that the sacrificed pashus (obviously the non-vegetarian
pashus) will take revenge on the sacrificer by eating the flesh of the
latter (sacrificer), in the next birth and Manu also seems to have
indicated this.


Reference?

This can possibly be obviated if the sacrificed pashu itself is a
non-carnivorous animal or if vegetables like Kushmanda are sacrificed as
Bali. The flesh eaters among the Hindus, eat the meat of the
non-carnivorous animals. It is also believed that eating meat of
non-vegetarian pashus (i.e., carnivorous animals) will make the mare
aggressive and brutal. However, Vishwamitra is said to have taken dog's
meat to save his life,  when there was a famine, but I do not recollect the
reference at this time


That is Apaddharma. It has nothing to with normal rules of yajna involving
pashubandha.
