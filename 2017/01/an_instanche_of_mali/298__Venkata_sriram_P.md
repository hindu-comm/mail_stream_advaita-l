Bhaskarji,

There are purva-pakshins and siddhanthis who oppose the pashu-yAga and the arguments are equally strong
on either sides.

See a sarcastic remark by a purva-pakshin:

वृक्षांश्छित्वा पशून्हत्वा कृत्वा रुधिरकर्दमम् ॥
यद्येव गम्यते स्वर्गे नरकः केन गम्यते ॥

If by performing the pashu-himsa and creating a bloodshed, one tries to go to
heaven then who will go to hell !

The shrautas of Andhra belt use the pashu in yaga and they don't use anukalpas whereas
the some shrautas of Maharashtra & Karnataka belt use piSTa-pashus.

regs,
sriram
