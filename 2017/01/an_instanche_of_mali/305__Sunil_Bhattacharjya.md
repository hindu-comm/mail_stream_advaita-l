Yes, this is not among the rules of Manu, nor of yajna.

 believed that the sacrificed pashus (obviously the
 non-vegetarian pashus) will take revenge on the sacrificer
 by eating the flesh of the latter (sacrificer), in the next
 birth and Manu also seems to have indicated this.

 Reference?
 This can
 possibly be obviated if the sacrificed pashu itself is a
 non-carnivorous animal or if vegetables like Kushmanda are
 sacrificed as Bali. The flesh eaters among the Hindus, eat
 the meat of the non-carnivorous animals. It is also believed
 that eating meat of non-vegetarian pashus (i.e., carnivorous
 animals) will make the mare aggressive and brutal. However,
 Vishwamitra is said to have taken dog's meat to save his

 That is Apaddharma. It has nothing
 to with normal rules of yajna involving
 pashubandha.
