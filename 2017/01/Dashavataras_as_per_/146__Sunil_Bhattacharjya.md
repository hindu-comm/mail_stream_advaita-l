∞ {\displaystyle \infty }  
Mathematicians are familiar with ∞, the symbol of infinity. Thus mathematically speaking 
1/∞ (infinity) = 0 (Zero or Shunya)

 As you can observe he
 relies heavily on some obscure Vaishnava authors /books and
 Buddhist works which are sheer fantasies. If we are to take
 this guy seriously, we will have to accept Shankara as
 prachanna baudha which is again a monumental lie.

 That does not make any
 difference at all. It is clearly established in the shastras
 / Puranas that animals sacrificed in yajnas attain higher
 worlds. There is an instance in Matsya Purana about this
 topic. I can give reference if needed. This Ahimsa as meant
 by this pundit and by Buddha, whether I or I I, is
 completely against the vedic view as mentioned previously.
 So apparently Vishnu has got the fundamentals wrong.
 Further, animals were being sacrificed from times
 immemorial. How did it suddenly become hinsa? The same
 yajnas involving animal sacrifices were practised by the
 Pandavas as advised by none other than Krishna, another
 avatara.
 ‎
 ‎Secondly
 the Madhvas do not have credibility as they have perpetuated
 a series of lies. A guru/shiva nindaka is considered a great
 saint by them, so should we have comparisons with them. So
 it's immaterial what they believe when we have first
 hand evidence from Vyasa!

 You will have to inevitably view it from a more
 socio-political angle. It is similar to some reformer
 banning an already dead practise such as Sati. More over, we
 do not know much about this pundit nor the sources from
 which he is quoting. Above all, none of it makes any
 difference as we have clear evidence to the contrary.

 Almost in every chapter of the Mahabharata, the Vedic yajnas
 are given utmost importance as can be seen in the Gita as
 well. Further, the definition of Ahimsa is starkly different
 in the Vedas /MB. For eg, harsh speech is also considered as
 himsa as per Shastras. So Vishnu getting up from yoga nidra
 and donning an avatara to oppose everything that is held
 sacred in the Vedas is just not sane.

 Here
 there is a proposal for two Buddhas:

 Madhvas believe in Buddha
 avatars.
