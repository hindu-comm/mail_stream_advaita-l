Namaste Sunil,

Like I mentioned before, there are a lot of historical lies in the Buddhists history and the same was exploited by the indologists. For eg, Ashoka persecutes all the jain monks in his kingdom just because someone painted a picture depicting Buddha falling at the feet of a shramana. But we regard him as the great king. As a matter of fact, Mahavira is a more illustrious character and preached the same non-violence much before Buddha 0.1 was even born. So why is he not a Vishnu avatar? Are we so gullible to think that Buddha preached something new that we didn't already know.

If Buddha 0.1 was a well wisher of people and hence out of compassion, corrected the wrong views held by the Vaidiks, he should have first accepted the validity of Vedas. But there is no such evidence either in truth or fiction.

Whether there were 2 or 20 Buddhas, whether he preached the same philosophy or not, the fundamental question is, did he accept the validity of the Vedas? Can you come up with something to prove that? I guess not. Hence it is a nAstika school. This is the difference between Shankara and Buddha, like day and night. ‎So calling adi Shankara a prachanna baudha is limited to a cult like Vaishnavas.

If we contrast with the truth, according to which Veda Vyasa is the actual avatar of Vishnu, think of everything that he accomplished. The progenitor of both kauravas and pandavas, the author of sharirika sutras, the compiler of Vedas, the author of all Puranas, the Brahmarshi of incomparable intelligence. 

No one ever has heard of dashavatara stotra composed by Adi Shankaracharya. So sparing kindergarten children, no one else will buy this mere statement. 

Regards
Kripa

Dear friends,

Sorry, a part of the text got deleted by mistake. I am giving that below:

Saying Adi Shankara to be Prachanna Buddha is not wrong, provided the speaker understands what Lord Buddha really taught. Adi Shankara taught us that the Jivanmukta leaves the body (including all the five koshas) and becomes Videhamukta, and that is the state of realizing oneness with the Brahman. Lord Buddha taught that the Bodhisattva Sariputra saw that the skandhas (koshas) were empty, i.e,, he left the five skandhas or koshas. Lord Buddha did not use the word “Brahman” here, but not that Lord Buddha did not know the word Brahman. Lord Buddha did use the word “Brahman” in Buddhist sutra. Buddha did not believe in the plurality of souls and he differed from his Sankhya guru on this. He did not believe in duality and he differed from his yoga guru also. Lord Budhha believed only in the Advayavada, which is the same as the advaitavada. 

In Adi Shankara's time the Mahayana buddhists did not understand what Lord Buddha taught at the highest level, and that happened because of lapse of thirteen (13) centuries from the time of Lord Buddha to the time of Adi Shankara. Nagarjuna, who lived about eight (*) centuries before Adi Shankara told that Shunyata is not “non-existence”, but that also did not have any effect in Adi Shankara's time and the Mahayana buddhists were teaching nihilism in Adi Shankara's time. That is why Adi Shankara had not only to oppose the Sarvastivadins and the Vijnanavadins, he had also to oppose the Mahayana buddhists. 

Adi Shankara is said to have composed the Dashavataara stotra, where he included Lord Buddha as the ninth avatara of Lord Vishnu. If any member has tseen hat stotra, may I request him to share that infornation with us.

Sunil K. Bhaattacharjya

∞ {\displaystyle \infty } 
Mathematicians are familiar with ∞, the symbol of
infinity. Thus mathematically speaking 
1/∞ (infinity) = 0 (Zero or Shunya)

As you can observe he
relies heavily on some obscure Vaishnava authors /books
and
Buddhist works which are sheer fantasies. If we are to
take
this guy seriously, we will have to accept Shankara as
prachanna baudha which is again a monumental lie.

That does not make any
difference at all. It is clearly established in the
shastras
/ Puranas that animals sacrificed in yajnas attain higher
worlds. There is an instance in Matsya Purana about this
topic. I can give reference if needed. This Ahimsa as
meant
by this pundit and by Buddha, whether I or I I, is
completely against the vedic view as mentioned previously.
So apparently Vishnu has got the fundamentals wrong.
Further, animals were being sacrificed from times
immemorial. How did it suddenly become hinsa? The same
yajnas involving animal sacrifices were practised by the
Pandavas as advised by none other than Krishna, another
avatara.
‎
‎Secondly
the Madhvas do not have credibility as they have
perpetuated
a series of lies. A guru/shiva nindaka is considered a
great
saint by them, so should we have comparisons with them. So
it's immaterial what they believe when we have first
hand evidence from Vyasa!

You will have to inevitably view it from a more
socio-political angle. It is similar to some reformer
banning an already dead practise such as Sati. More over,
we
do not know much about this pundit nor the sources from
which he is quoting. Above all, none of it makes any
difference as we have clear evidence to the contrary.

Kripa ‎

Almost in every chapter of the Mahabharata, the Vedic
yajnas
are given utmost importance as can be seen in the Gita as
well. Further, the definition of Ahimsa is starkly
different
in the Vedas /MB. For eg, harsh speech is also considered
as
himsa as per Shastras. So Vishnu getting up from yoga
nidra
and donning an avatara to oppose everything that is held
sacred in the Vedas is just not sane.

Here
there is a proposal for two Buddhas:

Madhvas believe in Buddha
avatars.
