Namaste Subramanian,

To my knowledge, there is no mention of Buddha at all in the Mahabharata.

Almost in every chapter of the Mahabharata, the Vedic yajnas are given utmost importance as can be seen in the Gita as well. Further, the definition of Ahimsa is starkly different in the Vedas /MB. For eg, harsh speech is also considered as himsa as per Shastras. So Vishnu getting up from yoga nidra and donning an avatara to oppose everything that is held sacred in the Vedas is just not sane.

And the Buddhist documents are riddled with lies and fiction. For eg, as per the history, raja raja chola died a natural death. But the truth is he was murdered by buddhist assassin. As a result his son rajendra chola shifted the palace and later went on to conquer the Buddhist king in srI Lanka.

Another aspect is that in works such as the sarvadarshana sangraha, Vidyaranya swami classes Buddhism next only to charvaaks. There is absolutely no connection between sanAtana dharma and Buddhism. Otherwise we might as well say, jesus was an avatar of Vishnu because he gave such an idealistic philosophy like - love thy neighbor. ‎

Lastly, we can trace this misinformation to the indologists who were funded by the British East including Co. It was them who mobilised Christian missionaries and most indologists were Christians. Obviously they had a political agenda which is why these scholars sprouted out of nowhere due to sheer nepotism. Otherwise, how could such garbage like Gaudapada was influenced by nagarjuna come to be accepted as if it's the truth. It's like the mid day ‎sun is influenced by a burnt match stick.

Sorry for the rant :D ‎

Regards
Kripa ‎

Does the Mahabharata mention Buddha as Vishnu-avatara?

Namaste, 

It is interesting to note that the original work of Veda Vyasa, the sequel to the Mahabharata - Harivamsha, ‎does not mention the name of Buddha anywhere as the avatar of Vishnu. Here is the list of the avatars :

1) Varaha
2) Narasimha
3) Vamana
4) Dattatreya
5) Parashurama (son of Jamadagni)
6) Rama (son of Dasharatha) along with 3 brothers < apparently 24th treta yuga >
7) Krishna < 28th Dwapara yuga >
8) Matsya
9) Kurma
10) Veda Vyasa (son of Parashara)
11) Kalki (yet to be born)
