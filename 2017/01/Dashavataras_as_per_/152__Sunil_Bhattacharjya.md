Dear Kripa,

Lord Buddha was Hindu and he died a Hindu. He never said
that he was promulgating a new dharma. He said that he was
from the Ikshaku vamsha and that is confirmed by the
Pauranic chronology. In the Jataka stories (giving his
previous births) he said that he was Lord Rama in one of
his earlier births. Pauranic chronology shows that Lord Rama
was also from the Ikshaku vamsha. Hindus do believe that the
ancestors do take rebirth in their lineage. 

Lord Buddha was never against the Veda. When he saw that a
very large number of animals being taken for yajna, he
advised the king Bimbisara to continue his yajna, but
without animal sacrifice, and did not ask the king not to
perform the yajna. Nowhere in Veda it is said that a large
number of animals have to be sacrificed. That may be the
reason why Bhishma said in the Mahabharata that animal
sacrifice was promoted by the hypocrites (in order to
satiate their great desire for eating meat).

Lord Buddha asked the brahmins of his time, as to what the
Vedas say regarding the way to cross the cycle of birth and
death, but they said that Vedas have not said any such
thing. Obviously the Vedic scholars ignored the Upanishadic
teachings ( which are the essence of the Veda). Lord Buddha
asked the brahmins to concentrate on the essence of the
Vedas. 

The colonial historians wanted to prove the pauranic
chronology to be fake and they tried to show that Lord
Mahavira was born before Lord Buddha, by reducing the
antiquity of Lord Buddha. The colonial historians were
wrong as Lord Buddha was born thirteen hundred (1300)
years before Lord Mahavira. Lord Mahavira too learned the
Sankhya and Yoga, but he did not go to the advayavada like
Lord Buddha did. 

Buddha means Jnani and Buddhists believe that there were
many jnanis before Lord Buddha. 

Sometime ago, I read one verse (quoted from a Dashavatara
stora) in a book on the date of AdiShankara and it was
written by one Kulkarni. That verse says that Lord Buddha
was an avatara of Lord Vishnu. Some puranas (called as the
fifth veda by two of the major upanishads) too say that Lord
Buddha was an avatara of Lord Vshnu. Late President Dr.
Sarvapalli Radhakrishnan said that Lord Buddha was a great
reformer of Hinduism, I agree with Dr. Radhakrishnanand and
I shall also say that Adi Shankara too was a great
reformer of Hinduism. 

Regards,

 Namaste Sunil,

 Like I mentioned before, there
 are a lot of historical lies in the Buddhists history and
 the same was exploited by the indologists. For eg, Ashoka
 persecutes all the jain monks in his kingdom just because
 someone painted a picture depicting Buddha falling at the
 feet of a shramana. But we regard him as the great king.
As
 a matter of fact, Mahavira is a more illustrious character
 and preached the same non-violence much before Buddha 0.1
 was even born. So why is he not a Vishnu avatar? Are we
so
 gullible to think that Buddha preached something new that
we
 didn't already know.

 If Buddha 0.1 was a well wisher of people and
 hence out of compassion, corrected the wrong views held by
 the Vaidiks, he should have first accepted the validity of
 Vedas. But there is no such evidence either in truth or
 fiction.

 Whether there
 were 2 or 20 Buddhas, whether he preached the same
 philosophy or not, the fundamental question is, did he
 accept the validity of the Vedas? Can you come up with
 something to prove that? I guess not. Hence it is a
nAstika
 school. This is the difference between Shankara and
Buddha,
 like day and night. â€ŽSo calling adi Shankara a prachanna
 baudha is limited to a cult like Vaishnavas.

 If we contrast with the truth,
 according to which Veda Vyasa is the actual avatar of
 Vishnu, think of everything that he accomplished. The
 progenitor of both kauravas and pandavas, the author of
 sharirika sutras, the compiler of Vedas, the author of all
 Puranas, the Brahmarshi of incomparable intelligence. 

 No one ever has heard of
 dashavatara stotra composed by Adi Shankaracharya. So
 sparing kindergarten children, no one else will buy
this
 mere statement.

 Kripa
