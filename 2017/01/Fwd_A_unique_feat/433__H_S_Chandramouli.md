Namaste Sri Ravi iran Ji,

Yes. I also find the link is not responding to regstration. But having
registered earlier I am still able to login and access the files. i do not
know how the problem can be overcome. Perhaps Sri Subrahmanian Ji can talk
to one of the scholars who have delivered the talks since he knows them and
clarify.

Regards
