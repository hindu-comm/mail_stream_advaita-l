The Advaitasiddhi was expounded by the three renowned scholars of Vedanta:
MM Sri Krishnamurthy Sastrigal, Sri Goda Venkateswara Sastrigal and Sri
Mani Dravid Sastrigal in Tamil over a period of 9 years in Chennai. It
appears that so far nowhere the entire text, sometimes even taking up the
commentary - Brahmānandī - has been discoursed upon. This was done on three
Sundays of every month by the three scholars, each expounding a particular
portion of the text. The entire discourse is available in audio recording.

Now that mammoth task is over, the triumvirate has taken up these three
works for exposition:

1. Swārājyasiddhi (of Gangādharendra Saraswati) - Goda Sastrigal

2.  Khandanakhandakhādyam (of Sriharsha)   - Mani Dravid Sastrigal

3.  Advaitaratnarakshanam (of Madhusûdanasarasvati) - Krishnamurti Sastrigal

The audio of the inaugural talk by Goda Sastrigal and the introduction to
Khandanakhandakhādyam  by Mani Dravid Sastrigal is here for those who know
Tamil.
