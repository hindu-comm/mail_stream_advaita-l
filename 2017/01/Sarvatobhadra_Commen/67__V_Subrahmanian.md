There is a Kashmir recension of the BG. Such a pāṭha has been recognized by
Ramanuja's Gita bhashya commentator, Venkatanatha. It is said there are at
least five commentaries on this recension. While I have not seen all those
five and compared the differences with ref. to Shankara's reading, this
Sarvatobhadra commentary is available for download.  The edition makes note
of such differences then and there.  Here is the difference with reference
to the total number of verses in the Shankara edition:

Sarvatobhadra has:

15th ch. at end one verse extra in some mss.

11th ch. 4 verses extra.

9th ch. 1 verse extra.

6th ch. 2 verses extra

5th ch. 1 verse less

3rd ch. 5 verses extra

1st ch. 1 verse less

One can perhaps make a survey with the Abhinava Gupta commentary too since
this is earlier to Ramanuja.
