Dear Venkatraghavanji,

You took objection to my examining the authorship of Abhinava Shanaka, when my examination of the Authorship of Sri Vidyashankara was not found suitable. A researcher does not given up if one possibility falis, he tries the other possibilities. The researchers have the habit of lateral thinking in search of truths. 

Anyway, you seem to argue well and congrats. May be you should take up in earnest.  solving the muddle concerning the date Adi Shankara. 

Regards,
Sunil KB

 Namaste Sri
 Vidyasankar,

 I agree, we
 need not get caught up with the number 16. It was merely
 an
 interesting coincidence - to the extent
 that what Sri Sunil said about the
 bRhat
 Shankara vijayam is verifiable and true, this would be
 evidence from
 another Sankara vijayam that
 corroborates it.

 I
 certainly don't agree with the view that Adi Sankara did
 not write the
 gIta bhAShya - the attempts
 thus far in this thread to prove otherwise, by
 attributing it to various other personalities
 have been a bit bizarre.

 Sri Sunil first brought up VidyAsankara as an
 author of the gIta bhAShya.
 However, when it
 was pointed that Bhaskara quotes Sankara bhAshya and
 therefore VidyASankara cannot be the author,
 that theory was abandoned. The
 new theory
 was to say that Abhinava Sanakara wrote it. When the need
 to
 postulate a new author in the first place
 was raised, Karmarkar's paper was
 quoted
 to question the authorship of the bhAshya. However, when
 the
 contents of it were refuted, we did not
 get any substantive response to
 those
 arguments. Instead it was argued that Pathak wrote a paper
 alleging
 the birth of Abhinava Sankara in
 788 AD. However when it was pointed that
 Pathak said no such thing in the paper that was
 cited, the argument changed
 to the
 manuscript pointing to a nava Sankara instead. Now that has
 been
 refuted too. In the interim there was a
 brief, pretty arbitrary segue into
 an
 allocation of bhAShyas to Sankara based on the number 16
 from
 chitsukhA's Sankara vijayam. I
 truly wonder where this will end.

 Regards,
 Venkatraghavan
