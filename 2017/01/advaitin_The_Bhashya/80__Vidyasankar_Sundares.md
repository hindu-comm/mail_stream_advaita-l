Dear Sunilji,

I never said that nobody knows how many bhAshyas were written by Sankara
bhagavatpAda. That is a misunderstanding of what I said. Of course, our
AcAryas do have a reckoning and as I listed in my earlier mail, they don't
add to 16. Rather, I asked about your source text that enumerates 16.

Nobody has seen the bRhac-chankara-vijaya. T S Narayana Sastry was
approximately the only person who claimed to have seen portions of this
text. I don't remember seeing this number 16 in his book on Sankara.

Saraswati.

Indeed, but I'm not the one speculating about how and why he passed away.
And at a comparative scholarly level, Raghavan, Ingalls, Mayeda and others
had already addressed the doubts that he raised.

Best regards,
Vidyasankar
