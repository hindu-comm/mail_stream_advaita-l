Namaste,

According to others the present Kamakshi temple was originally a Buddhist temple worshipping Goddess Tara. Goddess Tara is also worshipped by the Hindus. Goddess Tara is the second Mahavidya after the Goddess Kali, in the list of the ten Mahavidyas. Some say that it was a temple of Goddess Kamakshi (also called Lalita or Shodashi), who is also one of the ten Mahavidyas.  It is said that the goddess was Ugra and Adi Shankara installed a chakra Sri Chakra to make the goddess assume a shanta murti.  

Regards,
SKB

 According to some
 scholars the present Kamakshi temple was originally a jain
 temple and the name of the Devi
 Dharmamba(Jinadharmamba?).According to these
 scholars the original Kamakshi temple is the Adipeetheswari
 temple in Kanchi. The very fact Kamakoti Peetham recognises
 the present temple as Kamakshi temple shows that they are
 not aware of the change.

 Dear
 Subbuji,



 Adi Shankara wrote the Lalita-Trishati-bhshya and he
 visited the Kamakshi mandir in Kanchipuram.He advocated
 Samayachara and not Vamachara.



 As regards the Saundaryalahari, the first part called the
 Ananandalaharai (verses 1 to 41) could have been written by
 the Kashmir king Pravarasena (porbably called himself the
 Dravidashishu) and the second part was completed probably by
 Abhinava Shankara.

 To the list of works

 mentioned below, we may also add:



 The Soundarya Lahari which was translated to

 Tamil by Kaviraja Pandita

 stated to be of

 the 11 CE who mentions Shankara as the author.
 Another

 much later work 'Pulavar Puranam' while

 recording Kaviraja's life says that

 Shankara was a shākta practitioner, not of the

 vāmāchāra type.

 subbu
