Dear Sri Vidyasankar Ji,



 Namaste.



The following is from Guruparampara of Sri Kamakoti Peetam.



 << *Sri Abhinava Sankarendra Saraswati :* He was one of the greatest among
the successors of Adi Sankara, so great indeed that he and his deeds are
often confounded with those of the Great Bhagavatpada and his deeds. His
life story has been described in detail in a work entitled the "Sankara
Vilasa" by Vakpati Bhatta. His father was one Visvajit of Chindambaram. He
was invested with Yajnopavita at the age of five and taught Vedas. He
showed an extraordinary promise in dialectics and soon he became a
formidable disputant on intricate questions in philosophy. He defeated
Vakpati Bhatta, a great scholar of that time, in argument. He ascended the
Savajna Pitha in Kashmir. It is said that he entered the Dattatreya cave in
the Atreya Mountains in the Himalayas on Amavasya in the month of Ashada of
the cyclic year Slddharti (840 AD) and that it was the end of his mortal
career. >>.



He has been listed as the 38th Peethadhipathi of the Mutt.



Just for info.



Regards
