Dear frieds,

Shri Venkatraghavan has great zeal and he is is fully convinced that Nava Shankara was not born in Chidambaram in 788 CE and it was Adi , who was born in 788 CE.

The following question arises and hope a critical person like Shri Venkatraghavan will look at these and work towards finding the date of Adi Shankara. 
1)
Hope he will try to find the king Vikramaditya, whose reign started from 765 CE, as according to the information from a mathadhipati of the Sringeri math, Adi Shankara was born on the 14th year of the reign of Vikramaditya.  
2)
He will try to  find the king Amaru who died around 800 CE
3)
He will  try to find the  King Sudhanva around 800 CE, who was a contemporary of Adi Shankara. 
4)
He  will try to find the  evidence relating the king who was ruling Kerala around 800 CE as Adi  Shankara was born Kaladi in Kerala.
5)
Let us also hope that he will also find the astronomical matching of the time of AdiShankara, taking the details from the Shankaravijaya published by the Srngeri Matha or any other Shankaravijaya, which he think is the most relaible.
6)
He will try to find if and when the Nepal king  Vrishadeva was ruling during Adi Shankara's visit to Nepal.
7)
He will also try to find  from the historical sources like Rajatarangini, if and when Adi Shankara visited Kashmir. 


I await the intelligent people who are really highly concerned with the date of  Adi Shankara  to debunk the several datings of Adi Shankara. If he was really born in 788 CE , it should hot be able to prove a date about 1200 years ago, using the seven historical tips I suggested above. May be the other scholars would be able to suggest more tips. If however, the 788 CE date cannot be proved one should have an open mind to look for the BCE dates.  There have been curious situations in the past, such as follows :
A)
B Rice Lewis claims in an issue of the Mysore Gazette that the Sringeri math had given him the succession of Sringeri gurus, according to which the first guru Shankaracharya was consecrated in that math in 745 CE and he passed away in 769 CE. If Adi Shankara lived for 32 years he must have been born in 737 CE.
B)
Further at one time the  Sringeri math also published a guruparampara list according to which Adi Shankara was born in 44 BCE, and the guruparampara list was blank for 700 years.  

My interest has not been to criticize other people's views just to win any debate but to find the date of Adi Shankara. Pathak's paper at best shows that there could have been one Nava Shnakar, who was born in 788 CE.

 Pathak claims this
 is Adi Shankara only. If Sri Sunil wants to claim the
 manuscript refers to a navashankara then so be it - however
 that is his opinion, not Pathak's.
 Even then, one should note that the
 manuscript says that the very same Shankara (the one that
 Sri Sunil claims is Nava Shankara) is also the author of the
 shaAriraka bhAshya - which is the brahmasUtra bhAshya. So if
 Sri Sunil insists that this person is Nava Shankara here,
 who is different from Adi Shankara, then he must be prepared
 to admit, it is Nava Shankara that wrote the Brahma sUtra
 bhAshya also.
 The
 other reason why the mss. must refer to Adi Shankara only,
 is that the guru parampara given there is from Shiva
 onwards, down to Gaudapada, GovindapAda and Shankara. If
 Nava Shankara was meant, why would it stop at GovindapAda
 sishya Shankara, it would go all the way to Nava Shankara.
 Failing which, it would at least give the immediate guru of
 Nava Shankara. But it apparently does not, for Pathak does
 not mention it.
 The
 other thing to be noted is that the manuscript refers to
 rAmanuja and madhva, which reveals that the author of the
 manuscript wrote it after their time, which leaves a gap of
 500 years from Shankara's time, not much better than the
 Shankara vijayams.

 Dear Sunilji,
 Have you read the paper carefully?
 How do you explain the word schApita, which occurs twice, in
 two verses that refer to Ramanuja and Madhva? It could be
 emended to sthApita, but that only means that we should be
 very careful in interpreting these things. There are
 obviously editorial issues with either the manuscript or
 with Pathak's reading of it.
 The mss that Pathak reports talks of
 ONE Sankaracharya, who wrote commentaries, who established
 maThas, who was the disciple of govindapAda and grand
 disciple of gauDapAda, and who was born in the year 788
 (nidhi nAga ibha vahni abda of Kaliyuga). There is no
 reference whatsoever to Chidambaram. There is no reference
 to a theory that there were five reincarnations of
 Sankaracharya or even just to Nava Sankara In the verses
 quoted in the paper.
 Further, Pathak refers to
 Anandagiri, not to anantAnandagiri. Please read his paper
 again. Carefully. It is amusing that you accuse me of taking
 the two to be the same. When you look at the published
 literature on the Sankaravijaya texts, my paper is perhaps
 the only one which vociferously argues against making such
 an equation. 
 Finally, Pathak is concerned with
 the date of Adi Sankaracharya, nobody else, as is evident
 from his introductory paragraph. Those whom he quotes as
 assigning dates ranging from the 7th to 9th centuries were
 also concerned only with Adi Sankara. You cannot project
 your own opinions about Adi vs Nava Sankaracharya-s,
 backwards in time, on to writers who lived more than a
 century ago.

 Dear Vidyashankarji,



 ShankarAcharyanavAvatara means the new avatara of
 Shankaracharya. It is according to shashthi tatpurusha
 samasa. You can ask anybody who knows Sanskrit. This is not
 as you interpret. There is no alankara needed for Shankara,
 but only the differentiation that this Nava Shankara was a
 later Shankara regarded as an avatara of Adi Shankara, as he
 was as versatile as Adi Shankara, .



 Secondly, I was talkng of Anantanandagiri and not
 Anandagiri. You took Anantanandagiri to be the same as
 Anandagiri



 No entreaties please. Pathak was concerned with the date
 of this Nava shankara and he quoted what he thought served
 that purpose. He omitted most of the paper. That does not
 mean thaton onecan look up whether there was any Nava
 Shankara or not, and if there was any, where he was born
 etc.

 Dear

 Sunilji,

 Pathak's paper

 says he has seen a manuscript from a private collection.
 He

 quotes a verse that describes Sri Sankaracharya as a

 nava-avatAra. Of whom? Obviously, Siva. For, the
 adjacent

 verse says, Adau Sivas, tato vishNuH etc. The sense is
 that

 Siva was the first guru and that Sankaracharya is his
 new

 avatAra in the Kali age. There is NOTHING there about Adi
 vs

 Nava Sankara, NOTHINGabout birth in Chidambaram,

 NOTHING
 about one person being the author of commentaries

 and another being the founder of maThas, etc etc. As
 for

 Pathak's reference to Anandagiri, I have no idea
 which

 text me is really quoting from here.

 Please, I entreat you, please learn

 to read journal papers and original quotations as per
 their

 original contexts. Please resist the temptation to force
 fit

 your own contexts and interpretations to the bare facts.
 I

 don't know what else to tell you. We have been over

 these same details at least five or six or times in the

 past!

 The paper of Pathak, which I read, clearly mentions

  Dear Sunilji,



  I have read Pathak's paper in the Indian



  Antiquary. It says nothing about Nava Shankara or

 about



  Chidambaram. The paper attributes the date 788 CE to

 Adi



  Shankara and nobody else. You cannot cite Pathak in



 support



  of this fanciful theory of an 8th century Nava

 Shankara.







  >







  There might have some confusion in the past as the
 name

  both Adi Shankara and the Nava Shankara was
 Shankara.

 It



  appears that Anantaanandagiri had written a
 biography

 of



  Nava Shanaka. Antarkar had done some work on the



  shankaravijayas as part of his PhD work but did
 not



  continue that work to sort out all confusions







  >



  Sorry, anantAnandagiri also says nothing about



  Nava Shankara. His text claims to be an account only

 of



 Adi



  Shankara. However, it is an extremely problematic

 text.



  At the risk of sounding like I'm doing



  self-promotion, please note that I have published an



  extensive paper in the year 2000, published in The



  International Journal of Hindu Studies, examining



  Antarkar's papers as well as many of the
 original



  Sankaravijaya texts. I have sent this by email to
 you

 as



  well. I am only mentioning this here so that others



  following this thread are aware of it.I



  too hope that further research is taken up on these

 texts,



  but I hope that whoever does it adopts sound
 research



  methodology and works towards clarifying matters

 rather



 than



  confusing them even further.Regards,Vidyasankar
