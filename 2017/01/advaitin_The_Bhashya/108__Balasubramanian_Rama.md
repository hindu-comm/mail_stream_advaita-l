Exactly! If this is supposedly abhinava shankara, according to pathak, he

a. wrote the brahma-sutra-bhashya
b. was the person in the line
shiva-vishnu-brahmA-vashiShTha-shakti-parAshara-vyAsa-shuka-gauDapAda-govinda-guru
(traditional line as per regular lists)

where is this supposed adi-shankara, different from this supposed
nava-shankara in the line? Before shiva? And what was his role - wrote no
bhAshyas? In any case, Venkatraghavan is completely correct, Pathak is not
talking about any nava-shankara, he is talking about shankara and agrees
with the 7 - 9th century dates.
