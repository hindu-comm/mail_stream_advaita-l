One of the Vijaya-s (not mādhavīya) holds that Shankara was born of a pumpkin/ash gourd. If this is the case then the reference is to Adi Shankara, as per that vijaya.

praNAms
Hare Krishna

I think it is kUshmAnda shankara vijaya or shankarakathAmrutasAra, publisher (read somewhere) is Yedatore yOgaananda swamy....But I have not read this vijaya, read somewhere about this reference.  

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
