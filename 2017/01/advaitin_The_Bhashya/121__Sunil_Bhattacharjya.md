Dear Vidyasankarji,

Thank you for the mail, and supporting the importance of lateral thinking. in any investigation.ha 

Knowing the problem is half the solution, so the saying goes. It seems most of the people who shows concern for the date of Adi Shankara, have not really tried to look for the problem areas, some of which are created by some spokesman from the matha itself, at different times in the past. Most of the people want to have a status-quo and dump the issues under the carpet. That is against the ancient Indian ethos. Lord Ram says in the Ramayana about the importance of truth very clearly, He means that one has to care for the truth and that does imply that untruths should not be nourished.

Advaitins may think of the Vyavaharika as being of lesser importance than the Paramarthika, but the vyavaharika world is the karma-bhoomi, available to us for trying to live life like the past mahajanas lived. In science we know that only theoretical knowledge without practical is incomplete so also the advaitic knowledhge without practising that in karma, is not complete. This is despite the saying we do not believe in jnana-karma samucchaya. Hope you will agree. So let us take that our efforts should  be not to nourish what is doubtful and look for the truth.  

Regards,
Sunil

 Indeed, Sunilji. A
 researcher should examine alternate hypotheses and use
 lateral thinking. One of those alternatives for an impartial
 researcher is to consider seriously that the entire question
 of raising doubts about the authorship of gItAbhAshya by
 Sankara bhagavatpAda is quite baseless!
 And another application of lateral
 thinking would be to decide not to over complicate the
 problem. Intricately coupling the authorship question with
 the date question and with the Sankaravijaya question and
 with the Matha question and the subsequent lineages question
 only results in greater and greater confusion. Yes, these
 are related problems and cannot be made completely separate
 problems address, but a researcher will tie himself up in
 knots if he ties these various questions into complicated
 knots. He can get better clarity by not clustering them all
 together and by proceeding in a methodical
 manner.
 Best
 regards,Vidyasankar

 Dear
 Venkatraghavanji,



 You took objection to my examining the authorship of
 Abhinava Shanaka, when my examination of the Authorship of
 Sri Vidyashankara was not found suitable. A researcher does
 not given up if one possibility falis, he tries the other
 possibilities. The researchers have the habit of lateral
 thinking in search of truths.



 Anyway, you seem to argue well and congrats. May be you
 should take up in earnest. solving the muddle concerning
 the date Adi Shankara.



 Regards,

 Sunil KB

 Namaste Sri

 Vidyasankar,



 I agree, we

 need not get caught up with the number 16. It was
 merely

 an

 interesting coincidence - to the extent

 that what Sri Sunil said about the

 bRhat

 Shankara vijayam is verifiable and true, this would be

 evidence from

 another Sankara vijayam that

 corroborates it.



 I

 certainly don't agree with the view that Adi Sankara
 did

 not write the

 gIta bhAShya - the attempts

 thus far in this thread to prove otherwise, by

 attributing it to various other personalities

 have been a bit bizarre.



 Sri Sunil first brought up VidyAsankara as an

 author of the gIta bhAShya.

 However, when it

 was pointed that Bhaskara quotes Sankara bhAshya and

 therefore VidyASankara cannot be the author,

 that theory was abandoned. The

 new theory

 was to say that Abhinava Sanakara wrote it. When the
 need

 to

 postulate a new author in the first place

 was raised, Karmarkar's paper was

 quoted

 to question the authorship of the bhAshya. However,
 when

 the

 contents of it were refuted, we did not

 get any substantive response to

 those

 arguments. Instead it was argued that Pathak wrote a
 paper

 alleging

 the birth of Abhinava Sankara in

 788 AD. However when it was pointed that

 Pathak said no such thing in the paper that was

 cited, the argument changed

 to the

 manuscript pointing to a nava Sankara instead. Now that
 has

 been

 refuted too. In the interim there was a

 brief, pretty arbitrary segue into

 an

 allocation of bhAShyas to Sankara based on the number
 16

 from

 chitsukhA's Sankara vijayam. I

 truly wonder where this will end.



 Regards,

 Venkatraghavan
