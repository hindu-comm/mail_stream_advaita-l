Dear Subbuji,

Adi Shankara  wrote the Lalita-Trishati-bhshya and he visited the Kamakshi mandir in Kanchipuram.He advocated Samayachara and not Vamachara.

As regards the Saundaryalahari, the first part called the Ananandalaharai (verses 1 to 41) could have been written by the Kashmir king Pravarasena (porbably called himself the Dravidashishu) and the second part was completed probably by Abhinava Shankara. 

Regards,
Sunil KB

 To the list of works
 mentioned below, we may also add:

 The Soundarya Lahari which was translated to
 Tamil by Kaviraja Pandita
 stated to be of
 the 11 CE who mentions Shankara as the author. Another
 much later work 'Pulavar Puranam' while
 recording Kaviraja's life says that
 Shankara was a shākta practitioner, not of the
 vāmāchāra type.

 regards
 subbu
