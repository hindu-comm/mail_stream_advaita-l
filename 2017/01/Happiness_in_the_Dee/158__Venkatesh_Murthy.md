IMHO the waking and other states are part of Maayaa only and they are
not satya. But they may be Vyaavahaarika Satya. Only in Vyavahaara we
can talk about those waking, sleep and dream states. Therefore the
Ganapati Upanisad has said "Tvam Avasthaatrayaateetaha" You are beyond
the three states. We have to go beyond the three to the Fourth. In
chemistry there are three states commonly known as solid, liquid and
gas. But there is a fourth state also beyond the three.
