Pranams Sri Sadananda Ji,



Reg  << Now the question to all.
WHO REALLY ENJOYS THE HAPPINESS IN DEEP SLEEP STATE -

when vijnanana maya kosha is folded and there is not
experiencer-experienced- experiencing triad? >>,



 It is the jiva only which experiences the happiness which is inferred from
the fact that it is the jiva only which recollects, on waking,  the
happiness enjoyed in deep sleep. It is not that “experiencer-experienced-
experiencing triad? “ is absent during deep sleep. It is only unmanifest,
but present during deep sleep.



Regards
