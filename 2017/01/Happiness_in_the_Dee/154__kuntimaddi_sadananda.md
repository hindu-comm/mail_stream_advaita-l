We just started the talk series on Pachadashi - Ch. 11.
Now the question to all.
WHO REALLY ENJOYS THE HAPPINESS IN DEEP SLEEP STATE - 

when vijnanana maya kosha is folded and there is not experiencer-experienced- experiencing triad?
Bri. Up equates sleep with pure sat chit ananda while Mandukya says is only a third state. 

How Advaita acharya have interpreted this state. 

Hari Om!Sadananda
