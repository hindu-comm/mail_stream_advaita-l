PraNAms
Since there is not much input into the topic other than from Sri Chandramouli -I will pose another question.
How do we experience the waking state, dream state and deep sleep states? I am not referring to objective knowledge that involves tripuTi. How do we know the waking state, dream state and deep sleep states. This can be extended to the samaadhi state too.
Any inputs?
Hari Om!Sadananda
