Chandramouliji - PraNams 

Thanks for your input. What I am looking for is how different advaita accharyas - have interpreted the different statements of the Upanishads relating to the deep-sleep state - since it forms also one of the basis for 'advaita' anubhava.
One Mr. Aravind Sharma analyzes the deep sleep state as per Adviata - of course quoting some western scholars. - The article is available in pdf form - when I looked into Google. http://cincinnatitemple.com/articles/Sleep-as-a-State-of-Consciousness.pdf

I have a feeling that he is trying to impress some western scholars without any clear understanding of the deep-sleep state as per Advaita. Hence my question to see how the scholars have understood.

Pranams Sri Sadananda Ji, Reg << Now the question to all.
WHO REALLY ENJOYS THE HAPPINESS IN DEEP SLEEP STATE -

when vijnanana maya kosha is folded and there is not experiencer-experienced-experiencing triad? >>, It is the jivaonly which experiences the happiness which is inferred from the fact that it isthe jiva only which recollects, on waking, the happiness enjoyed in deep sleep. It is notthat “experiencer-experienced- experiencing triad? “ is absent during deepsleep. It is only unmanifest, but present during deep sleep. Regards

Bri. Up equates sleep with pure sat chit ananda while Mandukya says is only a third state.

How Advaita acharya have interpreted this state.
