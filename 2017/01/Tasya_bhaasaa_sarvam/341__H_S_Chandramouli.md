 Pranams Sri Sadananda Ji,    Reg  << Similarly without the mind present
the pure all pervading consciousness cannot be RECOGNIZED. >>,    But it
also needs to be recognized that the mind is also only an inert instrument
through which Chaitanyam (Consciousness)  “recognizes” itself. Of course
“as though”. The mind is illumined by Chaitanyam.  That is the meaning of
<< Tasya bhaasaa sarvam idam vibhaati >>.    Regards
