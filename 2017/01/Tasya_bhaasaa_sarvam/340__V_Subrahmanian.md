Dear Sada ji,

Nicely stated. I recall a point Swami Paramarthananda ji would make:

Supposing I ask you to list all the objects in this Hall. It is true that
all of you will list everything here like the desk, the office clip, the
chairs, the people, etc. But one thing that no one will even take note of
as an item is the light, whether it is the sunlight or the electric light,
that pervades this entire hall with which alone you are able to see the
desk, etc. That light is taken for granted and not even considered by
anyone.

Similarly we never take note of the Consciousness which alone is
 responsible for all transactions, vyavahāra, but get engrossed in them.
It is the Veda, the Guru, that draws our attention to that Bhānam.

regards
subbu
