It is said that even in shrAddha karmas, meat was an offering earlier;
instead, now, there are vegetarian substitutes used, which is a must based
on sampradAya. For example, traditionally, in shrAddha, we have brinjal and
an udad/ black gram dish as more or less a must.

I don't remember having come across this in Manusmriti regarding
sacrifices. Please quote the reference. In fact, the dharmashAstras define
hiMsA as that which is done outside Vaidika sacrifice. Offering an animal
sacrifice as part of the ritual is dharma and cannot have phala of adharma
as per Manu 5.31-32, 39, while 5.40 guarantees a higher birth for all
herbs, plants, birds and animals offered in sacrificial rituals.

This categorisation seems contrary to the any dharmashAstra. For example,
Manu Smriti 5.38 says that an killer of on an animal [accept for sacrifice]
dies similar violent death as many times as there are hair strands of the
animal! As for making one aggressive and brutal is true about any
non-vegetarian food, whether in this life or next. Such a person is said to
be born in a "more conducive" body to prey on other animals.

Eating food which someone has begun consuming or prohibited food in order
to save one's life overrides the rules of dharmashAstra in during daily
living.
