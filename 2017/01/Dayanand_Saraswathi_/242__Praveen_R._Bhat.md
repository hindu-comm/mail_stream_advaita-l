Namaste Kripaji,

Kindly allow me to be harsh in this mail, since you cannot just keep on
continuing to insult those who are consider saints by many including
several on this list. Every time you say that you don't intend to discuss
something and start throwing mud all over afresh!

Your confusion, self-contradiction, jumping all over the place is becoming
clearer by each mail on this thread.

Another irrelevant point. Do you know if the Swamiji quoted in the thread
title took permission from his mother before sannyasa, whose interview you
have interpreted to support your vague ideas?

This shows yet another ignorance of what is called in shAstras as
अत्याश्रमी। तस्य को विधिः को निषेधः।

Another vague idea and incorrect.

The one-liners are not vague, the understanding and eligibility to
understand that seems vague.


> He calls a hill to be a guru.

... as is clear here. You are the neovedantin here, since this is akin to
saying that in gayatri japa, people worship the insentient sun! There is a
temple right there called Arunachaleshvara, which as per you would be
hill-eshvara! Wouldn't that be hilarious! :)

Had it been commonsense, Shruti telling one to approach a Guru would be
what.. restating a commonsense known by your worldly pramANas? It is
considered as a vidhivAkya in the sampradAya and it is meant for one who is
ignorant, not one who already knows. Since the knower has no vidhi as Vedas
are no longer pramANa for him. You can go endlessly on RM not being a
jnAni, but the same can be repeated from the other side that RM was a jnAni
and so he had no vidhis.

Please... are you talking of yourself?

You have asked many times and it was answered by many already several times
in this very thread. You continue ignoring them, including HH Sringeri
Shankaracharya's statement, interpreted according to your convenience and
repeat everything that you have been saying.

You can't have it both ways. If there is a yardstick to measure, others
have it as much as you seem to think you have it. They have their reasons
as much as you do. If there is no yardstick with them, then neither do you.

The inference is at best as good as the data you have. Your data seems to
be wiki, which is weak data. The data set is also too small, which are
random quotes out of context.

After being impolite thus far?!

Incorrect. Each person you listed is considered as a saint, may be not by
you, but by many of their followers and others well-respected in the
tradition. What is your "authentic' yardstick to measure sainthood now?! So
is your definition of saint, if any. Moreover, why do all saints need to be
Vedantins or neovedantins and vice versa?
