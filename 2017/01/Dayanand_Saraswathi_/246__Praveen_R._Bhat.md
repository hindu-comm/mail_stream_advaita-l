Exactly what I said. When you give me the details of the scholar, I would
be free to say that the person is a scholar as per you and your "own
sources". You have absolutely no shraddhA in anyone but yourself! Don't
fall into that trap, you must be aware of संशयात्मा विनश्यति।

No, no, your concluding what I didn't say is interesting!

Please do not impose your confusion or deliberate twisting on what I said.
I will say it again in clearer words: there is no mukti possible without
Vedanta jnAna. That jnAna can happen could have taken place in this life or
earlier. If you do not agree with the latter, you are contradicting shAstra
examples and your are using ardhajaratinyAya, which would make you
neovedantin as per your own definition.

Does it? The independence is in your mind. If the shAstra gives an example
of a rare one who is born almost a jnAni, who has a little avidyAleSha
left, how do you explain it? If you disagree, your basis is not shAstra.

Please refer to Taittiriya Bhriguvalli mantra स तपोतप्यत and what
Bhashyakara says after raising a question as to how did Bhrigu know तपस्
was the means? And don't interpret तपस् independently, study what
Bhashyakara says. And please don't come back to say that Bhrigu was
instructed, since I am quoting this *only* to say that how the order
continues, be it across lives.

Jnana is dependent on Vedanta. So a jnAni would necessarily have to be a

As above.

Not many, I would say almost everybody.
