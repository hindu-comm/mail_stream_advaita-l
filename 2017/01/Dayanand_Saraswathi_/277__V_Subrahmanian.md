https://newearthpulse.wordpress.com/2016/03/04/there-are-no-others/

*Questioner: "How are we to treat others?**"*

*Ramana Maharshi: "There are no others."*

The pinnacle of Vedāntic realization has been taught by Shankara thus:

परमात्मव्यतिरेकेण अन्यस्याभावं विस्तरेण अवादिष्म । [Bṛ.up.bh
<http://xn--nig.up.bh>āṣyam 4.4.6]

[We have elaborately stated already the *non-existence (absence) of any
other* than the Supreme Self.]

The above realization is based on the following:

Bṛ.Up.Bh <http://xn--nig.up.bh>āṣyam: 3.5.1 concluding paragraph:

ब्रह्मैव सर्वमिति प्रत्यय उपजायते । स ब्राह्मणः कृतकृत्यः, अतो ब्राह्मणः ;
निरुपचरितं हि तदा तस्य ब्राह्मण्यं प्राप्तम् ; अत आह — स ब्राह्मणः केन
स्यात् केन चरणेन भवेत् ? येन स्यात् — येन चरणेन भवेत्, तेन ईदृश एवायम् —
येन केनचित् चरणेन स्यात्, तेन ईदृश एव उक्तलक्षण एव ब्राह्मणो भवति ; येन
केनचिच्चरणेनेति स्तुत्यर्थम् — येयं ब्राह्मण्यावस्था सेयं स्तूयते, न तु
चरणेऽनादरः ।

Translation by Swami Mādhavānanda:

....and becomes a knower of Brahman, or accomplishes his task:* he attains
the conviction that*
*all is Brahman. *Because he has reached the goal, therefore he is a
Brahm~a. a knower of Brahman ; for then his status as a knower of Brahman
is literally true.

Therefore the text says: How does that knower of Brahman behave? Howsoever
he may behave. he is just such - a knower of Brahman as described above.

The expression, 'Howsoever he may behave,' is intended for a tribute to
this state of a knower of
Brahman, and does not mean reckless behaviour.


If the above is not Vedanta, nothing else is.
