However I know that RM is against Vedanta and my opinion of RM is still the same.

>  For your own good you could have shared what you know about Sri RM and posed this question also to Sri Anantha Sharma.  You could have clarified him, according to you, how Sri RM was against vedAnta and due to that reason how you treat Sri RM.  Who knows, you might have received an answer that would have put complete 'full stop' to your never ending doubts on Sri RM :-)  Anyway, you are still planning for the second opinion from other scholar, all the best to you.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
