Namaste Praveen,

I completely understand your (and the forum's sentiments) with regards to Ramana. Hence I did not add any comment but merely shared the link which I stumbled upon. Let me make it abundantly clear that I do not subscribe to the blogger's introductory remark(conclusions/implied / whatever). I was only interested ‎in the views of Dayanand Saraswathi.‎
‎‎
As you said that, you regard Dayanand Saraswathi greatly, it is clear then that you should acknowledge what he is saying, not me. The Swamiji makes a distinction between a Vedantin and a mystic. I don't want to elaborate on this topic, but just gave clarification.

Regards
Kripa

Namaste Kripaji,

Looks like you are back to hunting "online resources" akin to Wiki or worse to discredit the Maharshi.

First off, I can assure you that Pujya Swami Dayanandaji himself would laugh at the title of the blog; he discouraged the use of word "bliss". Next, the blog writer seems completely ignorant if not about Ramana Maharshi definitely about the the interviewed Swamiji! He cannot even understand the interview, else he couldn't have drawn his conclusion stated in the introduction to the interview. The interview definitely DOES NOT lead to that conclusion. His blog starts with "There is one Swami..", which shows that he doesn't even know that there is an institution called Arsha Vidya Gurukulam, which is more famous than how he introduces Swamiji. Let that be.

Swamiji not only wrote a book which is a commentary on Upadesha Saram by Ramana Maharshi, but he alsotaught it himselfin his long term Vedanta course. That should let people draw their own conclusions. Perhaps, the blogger doesn't know this.

Of course you are a svatantra kartA, but I would urge you to stop this please. You have already made all your points on Bhagavan Maharshi in the old threads themselves.
