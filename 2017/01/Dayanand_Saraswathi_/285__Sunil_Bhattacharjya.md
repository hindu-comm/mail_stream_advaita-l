Dear  Kripaji,

How do you call RM as the flag-bearer of the neo-vedantins. Some people call the followers of Sri Ramakrishna Paramhamsa also as neo-vedantins. I follow Adi Shankara and I also follow Sri Ramakrishna. Ramakrishna, who endorsed the Advaita. Sri Ramakrishna did not say anything against the Dvaita and the Vishishtadvaita etc. What he said is that all these are having their jijnashas at different levels. I believe that one should not expect all to be at one and the same level, as different people can be at different stages of their spiritual development. 

Regards,
Sunil KB

 Namaste Bhaskar,

 As this was the first time I
 was speaking to him and considering that I am a complete
 stranger to him asking away questions out of the blue, I
 thought it was proper to address only the main issue. He was
 kind enough to answer all the questions to my
 satisfaction. ‎Although I did mention the issue about
 astika - nAstika aspect that crops up in such cases as RM,
 he didn't specifically address that.

 But it is clear now that
 anyone can claim RM to be a jnAni, Jivanmukta, Maharshi etc.
 I was only trying to criticize from that
 angle(shAstra).
 ‎
 ‎As
 for criticising the philosophy is concerned, we can never
 reach a conclusion in a debate and so it's futile. For
 whatever it's worth, I'll probably pen down my
 observations and share it. In fact, looking back, I feel
 Dayanand Saraswathi has made the best judgement on RM.
 ‎

 I am not desperately
 behind RM (as you may have suggested). He is the flag bearer
 of the neovedantins (just my opinion) and hence my
 doubts.

 Regards
 Kripa ‎

 However I know that RM is against Vedanta and
 my opinion of RM is still the same.

 > For your own good you could have shared
 what you know about Sri RM and posed this question also to
 Sri Anantha Sharma. You could have clarified him, according
 to you, how Sri RM was against vedAnta and due to that
 reason how you treat Sri RM. Who knows, you might have
 received an answer that would have put complete 'full
 stop' to your never ending doubts on Sri RM :-) Anyway,
 you are still planning for the second opinion from other
 scholar, all the best to you.

 Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
 bhaskar
