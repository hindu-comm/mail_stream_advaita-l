Be forewarned that I would be free to take the same stance as you do and
question scholarship, since RM has been established as Bhagavan, no less,
by a great orthodox traditional scholar Kavyakantha Ganapati Muni who was
well-versed in all Vedas and all shastras. So I hope you find someone more
qualified than Ganapati Muni to comment on RM to your liking! And I presume
that since you come off as someone who has respect for the orthodox
tradition, you would know who Ganapati Muni was.

Just giving an example doesn't help, it should fit the exemplified. RM did
nothing of the sort.

This is a question with an answer hidden within, because it is wrongly
phrased. No one said that one can become a Vedantin without studying it,
but one can be mukta *without studying it in this janma*.

Please understand that the accident was not the hetu for the jnAna. Neither
RM nor Vedanta says that. jnAna is only due to Vedanta. Such are only
reasons for a kalyAnakRt to continue where he left of in earlier janma.

Many of us here are mildly familiar with a lot of things under the sun, but
we don't go all out calling them as bogus.

Whatever gave you the idea that it is objective now!

This has been the key criterion since day one of your questioning RM and
answered many times since day one as YES, if you mean about RM's being
jnAni/ mukta. No one claimed that He was an orthodox Vedanta teacher though.
