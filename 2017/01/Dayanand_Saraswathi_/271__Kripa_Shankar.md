Namaste Bhaskar,

As this was the first time I was speaking to him and considering that I am a complete stranger to him asking away questions out of the blue, I thought it was proper to address only the main issue. He was kind enough to answer all the questions to my satisfaction. ‎Although I did mention the issue about astika - nAstika aspect that crops up in such cases as RM, he didn't specifically address that.

But it is clear now that anyone can claim RM to be a jnAni, Jivanmukta, Maharshi etc. I was only trying to criticize from that angle(shAstra).
‎
‎As for criticising the philosophy is concerned, we can never reach a conclusion in a debate and so it's futile. For whatever it's worth, I'll probably pen down my observations and share it. In fact, looking back, I feel Dayanand Saraswathi has made the best judgement on RM. ‎

I am not desperately behind RM (as you may have suggested). He is the flag bearer of the neovedantins (just my opinion) and hence my doubts.

Regards
Kripa ‎

However I know that RM is against Vedanta and my opinion of RM is still the same.

> For your own good you could have shared what you know about Sri RM and posed this question also to Sri Anantha Sharma. You could have clarified him, according to you, how Sri RM was against vedAnta and due to that reason how you treat Sri RM. Who knows, you might have received an answer that would have put complete 'full stop' to your never ending doubts on Sri RM :-) Anyway, you are still planning for the second opinion from other scholar, all the best to you.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
