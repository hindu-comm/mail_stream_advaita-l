Kripaji - PraNAms
No need to proclaim. If you are, then you are. 

Glad to know you are jeevan mukta. My PraNAms again and again. Even otherwise also My praNAms as Lord revels in you too. 

Hari Om!Sadananda

If that is the case, then even I can proclaim that I am a jivanmukta. No one can either deny or affirm it. No one.

Regards
Kripa
