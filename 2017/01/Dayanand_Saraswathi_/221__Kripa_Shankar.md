Namaste Vidyasankar,

Thanks for the clarification. Yes, that is the only option. However, I am not sure if Bharati teertha Swamiji will entertain such questions. On a second thought, he is also known to be a large hearted person. So perhaps I'll get an answer to this one way or the other.

‎Regards
Kripa ‎

Kripa Shankar ji,can we stop second guessing such things? As Praveen Bhat has already pointed out, via links to older posts, Andrew Cohen's representation of advaita vedAnta and its gurus, whether it is the Sringeri Acharya or Swami Dayananda, is extremely untrustworthy. You could do better than to quote a blog post which reproduces his magazine's interview.

I don't know where you live, but if you really want an answer to your latest questions, please make a trip to Sringeri, and pose them yourself to Swami Sri Bharati Tirtha. That is the only direct evidence possible. Nobody else's answer is going to satisfy you one way or the other.

As for publications, for whatever it is worth, let me just reassure you that the editors of magazines like Tattvaloka are extremely careful about what appears in print in their pages.

Thank you,
Vidyasankar

Both references are unsubstantiated. If the Sringeri journal really supported the claim, there are two more things we have to consider. 1) Was it a guest post and 2) was the Sringeri guru aware of such an article being published? This is because, there is no direct evidence whatsoever! ‎If however, the Sringeri guru really acknowledged ramana as a saint, I'd be really surprised. Kind of like the whole world becoming upside down. I'll probably stop the study / practice of Vedanta in this life.

All claims of the praise for ramana by Sringeri Acharyas are a bundle of lies.

Your being ignorant about things doesn't lead to them being lies. Here are some of the links for you to look up if you are really interested in stepping out to know the truth instead of your preconceived notions:

http://murtymandala.blogspot.in/2011/03/maharshi-and-pontiff-of-sringeri-math.html
http://www.advaita-vedanta.org/archives/advaita-l/2002-April/002630.html

These are more reliable than the ones you come up with on some random blogs whose authors know not head from tail.

If he indeed commented on ramana's work, still that doesn't change anything(wrt to the current topic). I think he expressed his views quite clearly in the interview. ‎

Hah! That changes everything; else it would contradict logic. I have said this earlier to you that everything is to be interpreted in the context. Swamiji's statement is for those Neovedantins who misinterpret Ramana Maharshi and work with "anything goes" in the name of Vedanta. I am quite certain that you have no clue as to who the initial AC belongs to in the interview you linked here. There's your hint!I shall leave it at that. I will not use your tactic of calling it a bundle of lies though. :)
