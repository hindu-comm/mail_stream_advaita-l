Dear Sri Balasubramanian Ramakrishnan,
 Is it ever possible for a mumukshu to have sAkShAtkAra of Brahman as an object ? Does this concept not contradict the Srutivakya "adRuShTam" , " yEnEdaM sarvaM vijAnIti taM kEna vijAniyAt, vijnAtAram arE kEna vijAnIyAt" etc. etc. Is Brahman available for sAkShAtkAra? What is brahmasAkShatkAra itself? I will be grateful to you if you could explain and clarify it.
With respectful namaskarams,Sreenivasa Murthy

You seem have a few misconceptions. Yes, after brahma saakShaatkaara a
"fall" is possible. Sankara says that the person should take up sannyaasaa
and become a parivraajaka immediately AFTER saakShaatkaara to avoid this.
This has been discussed extensively in the list before. No you cannot
identify a person as a jiivanmukta or not, I.e., an "objective" test is not
available. That is indeed one of the ideas expressed by the dharmavyAdha
story or the R^ibhu story in the Vishnu purana.

Furthermore I suggest that you spend some time in introspection on the
anger you are displaying towards Ramana and his followers. Perhaps he
wasn't a jiivanmukta, so what part of their behavior is creating so much
agitation in you?

Rama
