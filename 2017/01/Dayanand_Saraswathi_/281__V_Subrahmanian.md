Where has Shankara said this?  In the BGB 13.35 Shankara says:

...and bhuta-prakrti-moksam, *the annihilation of the Matrix of beings*-the
Matrix of beings is that which is described as ignorance and is called the
Unmanifest; (those who know) the annihilation (moksanam) of that Matrix of
beings; te, they; yanti, reach, go to; param, the Supreme, to Brahman, the
Reality which is the suprme Goal. The idea is that they do not take up a
body again.

In the Vivekachudamani, Shankara says:

क्व गतं केन वा नीतं कुत्र लीनमिदं जगत् ।
अधुनैव मया दृष्टं नास्ति किं महदद्भुतम् ।।483।।
Where is the universe gone, by whom is it removed, and where is it merged ?
It was just now seen by me, and has ceased to exist ? It is passing
strange!
( Vivekchudamani, 383 )
वह संसार कहां चला गया ? उसे कौन ले गया ? वह कंहा लीन हो गया ? अहो ! बड़ा
आश्चर्य है जिस संसार को मैं अभी देख रहा था वह कहीं दिखाई नहीं देता ।

Nowhere it is said that it is samadhi.

This is exactly what you have done!

Are you sure? Then, what is the meaning of 'self' above?

"त्वंपदार्थविवेकाय सन्न्यासः सर्वकर्मणाम् । श्रुत्याभिधीयते
यस्मात्तत्त्यागी पतितो भवेत्" ॥
इत्यादिवचनकदम्बैर्वेदान्तविचारमन्तरा क्षणमपि सन्न्यासिभिर्न स्थेयमिति
प्रतिपादितं भवति

'Renunciation of karma  is enjoined by the Veda for the purpose of engaging
in 'tvam-padārtha viveka.' That is what is meant by Vedanta vichāra,
Self-enquiry, which is non-different from brahma-vichāra. It is called
'śārīraka mīmāmsā' by Shankara.
