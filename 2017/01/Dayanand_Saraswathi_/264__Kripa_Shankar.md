Namaste Praveen,

Just because I mentioned that, I have studied some texts, you jumped to conclusions that I am not learning it via a Guru. Unless one is living in a gurukul / guru's house / in pre-colonial times, we cannot study each and every word from the mouth of a guru.

I have had not one but many gurus. I have learnt it in the orthodox way, not the modern Vedanta learning centre where you can do a course, but the old school style. ‎

Regards
Kripa ‎

Both references are unsubstantiated. If the Sringeri journal really supported the claim, there are two more things we have to consider. 1) Was it a guest post and 2) was the Sringeri guru aware of such an article being published? This is because, there is no direct evidence whatsoever! ‎If however, the Sringeri guru really acknowledged ramana as a saint, I'd be really surprised. Kind of like the whole world becoming upside down.

Not if its already upside down for you and turning it around will make it right. :)

I'll probably stop the study / practice of Vedanta in this life.

Far from it! It would be all the more reason to study seriously for your pursuit of the truth about Atma, than to prove the truth" about others. And by study of Vedanta, I mean traditional study under a teacher, not self-styled study, which is no different than Neovedanta. Then you will hopefully not jump to favourite conclusions. For example, HH did not say that Maharshi was not a jivanmukta, but you read that anyway. Hypothetically assuming that HH did say it, you said Maharshi was not a jnAni then. Such conclusions are way off orthodox Vedanta, that you claim to be a follower of. Please do yourself a favour and live up to the claim by studying further, even if you are already studying.
