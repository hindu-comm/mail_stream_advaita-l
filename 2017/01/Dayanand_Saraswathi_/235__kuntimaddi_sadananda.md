Kripaji - PraNAms
None other than oneself can know that he has realized or not. I can know my mind and not other's state of minds. I can infer but inference is only based on how one reacts under some circumstances and it is speculative at best. 

The realization involves clear understanding of Brahma satyam, jagan mithyaa and jeevo brahma eva na apara - via mahavaakya upadesha. Depending on the maturity of the student - i.e four-fold qualifications jnaana nishta takes place - that is for moving from paroksha jnaanam to aparoksha jnaanam. I have discussed these elaborately in my talks series on 'Self-Realization' that is available at Self Realization by Acharya Sadaji - These are being made available on Yu-tube by Advaita Academy slowly under Acharya Sadaji.

 If it is objective knowledge as knowing Chemistry or Physics one can set a question paper. For knowing the subject I am, there cannot be any objectifiable facts. The Shitaprajna lakshanas discussed on Geeta are meant for evaluation of oneself. 

No jnaani declares that I am self-realized, since it is useless to do so as none other than him can evaluate. Besides who would like to announce that I was stupid before! It is also important for the disciples to assume that my teacher is realized so that he will have faith in the teaching. A disciple can realize whether the teacher has realized or not. 

Bhagavan Ramana Maharshi is respected for what he could communicate. However many of his followers seem to understand that who am I inquiry is sufficient - Vedanta says that it will only provide tvam padaartha vichaara. For self realization we need understanding of mahaavakyaas, as a fact. 

The best thing is to do is to take what one can gain from the teaching that is in tune with Vedanta and leave the rest. We should not be evaluating if someone else has realized or not. If the teaching helps me to evolve we should listen - as sat sangh. otherwise leave and the teaching may help others. It is better to respect all Vedantic teachers without going there with a litmus paper. 

What we are interested in only - How can I realize the Self in this liife? - Everything else is important only if it helps in my understanding, otherwise it is waste of precious time.
This is my understanding.

Namaste Sadananda,

‎You got me wrong. I was just wondering if someone being a Jnani / jivanmukta can be determined or not. I also gave a reason that, if we can't determine if a person is jivanmukta or not, then it becomes an abstract idea. Moksha will become a speculation. I am curious to know your opinion regarding this matter.

Regards
Kripa ‎
