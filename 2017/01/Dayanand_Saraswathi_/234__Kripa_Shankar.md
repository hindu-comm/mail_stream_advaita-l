Namaste Sadananda,

‎You got me wrong. I was just wondering if someone being a Jnani / jivanmukta can be determined or not. I also gave a reason that, if we can't determine if a person is jivanmukta or not, then it becomes an abstract idea. Moksha will become a speculation. I am curious to know your opinion regarding this matter.

Regards
Kripa ‎

Kripaji - PraNAms

No need to proclaim. If you are, then you are. 

Glad to know you are jeevan mukta. My PraNAms again and again. Even otherwise also My praNAms as Lord revels in you too. 

Hari Om!
Sadananda

If that is the case, then even I can proclaim that I am a jivanmukta. No one can either deny or affirm it. No one.

Regards
Kripa
