Namaste,

There is an interesting story, which probably leads to  similar.  Once a man was taking bhang and another man asked him not to take bhang. Then the first man shouted at the second man saying "Lord Shiva also takes bhang, So what is wrong in taking bhang."  Probably to save the second man, Lord Shiva appeared before the first man and asked "Will you take whatever Lord Shankara takes?" and the man agreed.. Then Lord Shiva took him to the iron-smith and asked the iron-smith  to prepare two iron balls and make them red-hot. Lord Shiva ate one red-hot ball and asked the first man to take his. Then the first man realized his folly and fell at the feet of the Lord. and requested the Lord  to forgive him. The Jivanmukta is Lord Shiva himself. 

Regards,
Sunil KB

 The truth is
 that no one person can (or should) certify or deny
 another's
 Jivanmukti.
 ------------------------------------------

 PraNAms
 I
 think Vidya made the essential statement. No one CAN
 certify or deny anoher's Jivanmukta.
 There were discussion also before by
 LalitaalalitaaH on the same topic. 

 We can only go by what a mahatma says and
 writes. Upadesha saara and Sat Darshanam texts presents the
 essence of Vedanta and it it taken as one of the prakarana
 granthas in Adviata teaching. Sringeriji stated that
 Bhagavan Raman is a mahatma; that is more than one can say
 about anybody else. 

 Disciples always glorify their teacher as
 realized; they need to, otherwise they will not have faith
 in his/her teachings. 

 Was
 Vamadeva a jnaani - since he apparently did not or could not
 study scriptures! Not sure about Jadabharata in his later
 lives. 

 In the final
 analysis it is ridiculous to try to evaluate someone else
 whether he/she is jnaani. Jeevanmukta lakshana is only
 to evaluate oneself.
 Chandogya prescribes
 a simple test to see if one is realized or not.
 If you touch a red hot iron with bare hand, and
 if you do not get burned, then you are realized. 

 Shankara, of course,
 interprets this if a jnaani is one who when makes contact
 with the hot world, he will not get burned. 

 That is the litmus test.
 Bhagavan Ramana appears to have lived peacefully throughout
 his life without getting burned.
