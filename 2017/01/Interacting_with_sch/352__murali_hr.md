Dear All,

Good effort !

We have prepared a platform to map such heritage .

Currently being used to conserve the heritage of Pondicherry

http://pondymap.org/mapp

We members can support us we can create a similar site that puts in all the
information including the photos and also the talk by the scholars.

I also wanted to map all the places visited by Sri Shankaracharya !
