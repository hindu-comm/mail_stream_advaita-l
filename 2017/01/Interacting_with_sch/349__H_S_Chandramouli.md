Dear Sri Subrahmanian Ji,

Would it be posible to persuade at least some more scholars to become
members of the forum and participate in the discussions. I think this has a
better chance of success as we may not be able to find many scholars who
would be willing to discuss or advise totally unknown persons and without
knowing their level of understanding.

Regards
