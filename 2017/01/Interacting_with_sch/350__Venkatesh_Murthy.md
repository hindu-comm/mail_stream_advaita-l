Namaste

Many scholars are not comfortable to become members and write in
English in discussions. They can talk and give knowledge orally but it
is difficult to ask them to write. Or they may not have time. Some are
not comfortable to type into a keyboard. Writing takes more time than
orally saying something.

If someone close to a scholar can ask questions on discussions here
and get answers it will be good if he can share it here. Example, what
is the scholar's opinion about Ramana? and so on.
