Hari Om,

A two-day seminar on "Science and Technology in the Indic Tradition" is
organized on February 4th and 5th, 2017 at the IISc Faculty hall. This
seminar will explore high level perspectives on selected areas of Indic
science and technology by eminent researchers. More concretely, some of the
talks in this seminar will throw light on an interesting perspective that
seems to have informed a good part of the Indic tradition: that of
द्रुग्गणितैक्य dṛggaṇitaikya, the concordance between “observed” and the
“computed”.

Prof. Roddam Narasimha (JNCASR) will be giving the keynote talk on
“computational positivism” in the Indic tradition. Well known scholars such
as Prof. V N Jha, Prof. R N Iyengar, Prof. M. D. Srinivas, Prof. S. Sundara
Rajan will also be giving talks. There are also tutorials on Feb 3 and 6.
The brochure with details and schedule is at drona.csa.iisc.ernet.in/~gopi/
icpr/brochure.pdf.

Entry is FREE. Kindly register if interested.
Please circulate to interested parties as appropriate.
