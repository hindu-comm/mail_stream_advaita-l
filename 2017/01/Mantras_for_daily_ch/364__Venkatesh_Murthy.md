Namaste

Chamakam Namakam caiva purusa suktam tathaiva ca |
Nityam trayam prayunjano Brahmaloke mahiyate ||

Namaka, Camaka and Purusha Sukta are important. Gayatri Mantra is
already included in Sandhya Vandana. Others like Durga Sukta and Sri
Sukta may or may not be in daily chanting. If you have too many
Mantras there will not be time and soon everything will stop. Better
to say limited Mantras and be regular with it. In coming Maagha Maasa
on Sundays Aruna Prashna and Surya Namaskara is important.
