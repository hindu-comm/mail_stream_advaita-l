That's true. However it's all about priorities. My work schedule is quite flexible so I have enough time to chant some mantras, all three times.

I have started doing Surya namaskar (pattabhi jois school of Ashtanga Yoga) from past one year. It has been great. I am trying to add some more asanas as well to my schedule.

Thanks for the inputs. ‎

Regards
Kripa ‎

Namaste

Nityam trayam prayunjano Brahmaloke mahiyate ||

Namaka, Camaka and Purusha Sukta are important. Gayatri Mantra is
already included in Sandhya Vandana. Others like Durga Sukta and Sri
Sukta may or may not be in daily chanting. If you have too many
Mantras there will not be time and soon everything will stop. Better
to say limited Mantras and be regular with it. In coming Maagha Maasa
on Sundays Aruna Prashna and Surya Namaskara is important.
