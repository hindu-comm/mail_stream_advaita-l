Suggestion to chant the Vishnu sahasranAma is not foolish, you are forgetting the fact that it has the bhAshya in the name of shankara and before writing the  bhAshya, that bhAshyakAra  must have read this sahasranAma without sticking to the single word rAma, is it not??  That means....??  Anyway, though we have the sentence like : om iti ekAksharaM brahma but we are not sticking to only praNava thinking ekAksharaM OM is enough to realize brahma, are we not  religiously studying the veda-s ??  The word 'rAma' eulogized and advised for the sAdhaka bhakta-s who are not able to chant the whole sahasranAma.  It does not anyway mean that those who are chanting VS are fools and asking someone to chant VS is foolish.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!

People are foolishly suggesting Vishnu Sahara Nama without knowing 'Sri Rama  Rama Rameti Rame Rame Manorame'.
