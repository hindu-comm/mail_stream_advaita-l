praNAms 
Hare Krishna

And the gaNapati is sUrya kOti samaprabha and he is param brahma and he is everything..says ganeshArthavasheersha...These are all their to eulogize the particular deity that does not mean we can skip 'everything' and stick to one thing by finding the shortcuts...Anyway I donot want to get into the debate here.  HH Sri Chandrashekhara bhArati narrates the difference between two servants, one who is simply sitting and  praising his owner and another one is religiously doing the work what his owner is ordered.  If possible kindly read that article.  With this I shall stop.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar

Namaste

Japataha Sarva Mantraanshca Sarva Vedaanshca Paarvati | Tasmaat Kotigunam Punyam Raama Naamnaiva Labhyate || In Padma Purana Siva said to Paarvati - What Phala you get by chanting all Mantras and all Vedas
1 Crore times of that Phala you will get by Raama Naama.

Raama Naama Mantra is like the SUN and all other Mantras are like Stars. Sun is crores of times brighter than Stars. If Sun is shining why do we want light from the Stars? Sun light is also so easy to get.
You simply allow Sun Light to come in. No special effort is required.
