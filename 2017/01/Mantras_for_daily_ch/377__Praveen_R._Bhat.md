Namaste Venkateshji,

That is considered as a glorification of रामनाम and to be done only by
those cannot chant Vishnusahasranama for whatever reasons, not as a lazy
out! Else it would be like saying that ones who suggest chanting रुद्र as
opposed to shortcut रुद्र that goes सर्वो वै रुद्रस्... are being foolish.

Kind rgds,
--Praveen R. Bhat
