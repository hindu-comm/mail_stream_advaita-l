Namaste Shashi,

Thanks for your input. True that. Occasionally, I listen to Vishnu sahasranama by MS.

Regards
Kripa ‎

In addition to the excellent suggestions, please don't forget the repetition of the name of your favorite deity.

Such a simple form of devotion will weave the other great mantras like flowers into a wonderful garland that you can offer to your God or Goddess.
