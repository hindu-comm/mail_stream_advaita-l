Namaste

Purandara Dasa has sung - raama mantrava japiso, he manuja.  aa mantra
ee mantra nechchi nee keDabeDa

O Man, Don't be misled by that Mantra and this Mantra.

Why all thousands of Mantras when Raama Mantra alone is the Taaraka
Mantra? is the question.

I am talking about outside Puja. In Puja we require different
Panchayatana Puja Mantras like Namaka, Chamaka, Purusha Sukta. Outside
Puja if you feel like saying a Mantra Raama Mantra is the best.
Nothing like it.
