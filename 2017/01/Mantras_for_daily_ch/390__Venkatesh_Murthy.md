Namaste

Your question is like the Chandala disguised Siva's question to Adi
Sankara when he said 'Apasara' 'Move away'. What can he move? Body or
Atma? Body is matter and impure. Atma is pervading everywhere and
actionless. How to move it? To this Adi Sankara had no answer.
Similarly for your questions there is no answer but Sashtanga Pranams
if you have realized the Truth. Otherwise if you have to still get
Citta Suddhi all these Mantras will help you to get Citta Suddhi.
Nothing wrong in person doing all the Karmas for Citta Suddhi.

If you have realized Truth you should not disturb others trying for
Citta Suddhi by Karmas, Mantras, Discussions and so on. Na Buddhi
Bhedam Janayed Ajnaanaam Karmasanginaam. Kindly read and understand
the Geeta sloka.
