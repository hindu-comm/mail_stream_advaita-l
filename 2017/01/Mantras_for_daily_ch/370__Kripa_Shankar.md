Thanks for the valuable suggestion Bhaskar. This in fact, never crossed my mind. But I don't have a shiva linga at my home. Is it okay to buy it or should some one give it to me as a gift? ‎Are there any other mandatory rituals associated with keeping the linga at home?
‎
‎Regards ‎
Kripa ‎

IMHO, chanting mantra with bhagavat kainkarya will be more efficacious than mere chanting the mantra without following the Pooja vidhAna physically. Since you know rudraM chamakaM etc. it would be better if you chant those mantra-s while doing the abhishekaM to shivalingaM likewise if you know the purusha sUktaM, shree sUktaM etc. chant those mantra-s while offering the shOdasha upachAra Pooja to your ishta devata. So that archana, ArAdhana, upAsana will be complete in all respects i.e. kAya, vAcha and manasa. If you are already doing this, kindly ignore this message.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
