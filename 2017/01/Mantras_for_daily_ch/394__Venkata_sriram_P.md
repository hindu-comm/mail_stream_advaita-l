Similarly for your questions there is no answer but Sashtanga Pranams
if you have realized the Truth

//

In kali-yuga, नामसंकीर्तनम् is the advocated for all, irrespective of varNa, jAti and linga bhEda. 

There are dangers in vichAra / jnAna mArga. Sadhaka may end up with Atheism / arrogance /
self-aggrandisement / false prestige of showing one's scholarship unless properly 
moulded by satguru.  

Swami Ranganathananda Ji, former president of Ramakrishna Mutt, Hyd, used to always  
say in his lectures that the sAdhaka should be like "gulaab jamoon".  He should fry 
himself in the ghee of jnAna and then later soak himself in the sugar syrup of bhakti.  
Such a sAdhaka becomes soft and recipient of divine grace.

Otherwise, he would end up in shAstra-vAsana and show of knowledge.
