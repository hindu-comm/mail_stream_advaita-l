Namaste

Yes VS is good also but it will take more time and for same benefit in
less time Raama Mantra is the best.

In the Rama Purva Tapaniya Upanishad -

Ramante Yogino Anante Nityaanande Cidaatmani | Iti Raamapadenaasau
ParaBrahmaabhidheeyate || The Yogis rejoice in the Infinite and
Eternal Bliss Consciousness Para Brahman. That Para Brahman is
indicated by the Raama word. Raama is the name of Para Brahman itself.
What more do you want?

Raama Mantra is simple 'Sri Raama Raama Raama' and any person can
chant it without restrictions. One day Hanuman was flying over a place
and he heard one person after getting relieved of constipation in the
toilet saying Raama Raama. Hanuman became angry and hit him on the
head because he was saying Raama Naama in a impure place. But when
Hanuman went to see Raama He was complaining of head ache. He said
because you hit my Bhakta in the head my head is paining. Moral of
story is Raama Naama is so sacred it will not become impure in any
place or time.

But Veda Mantras are not like that. We have to be very pure and on
some days like Anadhyayana days like Pratipat Veda Mantras are
prohibited though you can say them in Puja and Nitya Karmas.

That means....??  Anyway, though we have the sentence like : om iti ekAksharaM brahma but we are not sticking to only praNava thinking ekAksharaM OM is enough to realize brahma, are we not  religiously studying the veda-s ??  The word 'rAma' eulogized and advised for the sAdhaka bhakta-s who are not able to chant the whole sahasranAma.  It does not anyway mean that those who are chanting VS are fools and asking someone to chant VS is foolish.
