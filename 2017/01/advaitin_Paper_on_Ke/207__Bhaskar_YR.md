I think the points raised by SSS on the two bhashyas of Sankara on Kenopanishad deserve careful looking into. After all a great commentator like sankara is not likely to contradict himself.

>  And while making these observations Sri SSS gives more importance to pada bhAshya,  as this bhAshya,  according to him,  more close to the style of other Upanishad bhAshya-s.  Elsewhere he observes that due to all these reasons, there is a room to say that kena vAkya bhAshya cannot be from the pen of Acharya.  KAryAlaya in the third edition of this bhAshya, published ONLY pada bhAshya citing the similar reasons.  

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
