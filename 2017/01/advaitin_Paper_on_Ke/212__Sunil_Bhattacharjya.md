Dear Bhaskarji,

Yes, That alone is sufficient for one to understand that Vakyabhashya was not by Adi Shankara. The million dollar question is which  Shankaracharya from any of the Shankara-mathas wrote it? 

Regards,

 I think
 the points raised by SSS on the two bhashyas of Sankara on
 Kenopanishad deserve careful looking into. After all a great
 commentator like sankara is not likely to contradict
 himself.

 > And
 while making these observations Sri SSS gives more
 importance to pada bhAshya, as this bhAshya, according
 to him, more close to the style of other Upanishad
 bhAshya-s. Elsewhere he observes that due to all these
 reasons, there is a room to say that kena vAkya bhAshya
 cannot be from the pen of Acharya. KAryAlaya in the third
 edition of this bhAshya, published ONLY pada bhAshya citing
 the similar reasons. 

 Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
 bhaskar
