Dear Vidyashankarji,

Like the Avogadro's Hypothesis in science, the hypothesis that Adi Shankara
wrote sixteen (16) bhashyas may stand tall, particularly because  the
Brihat Shankara Vijaya as well as the work of Shri Vidyaranya combined with
commentary on it says so, until someone gives another proven figure to
contest that.


Till I see credible reports of actual manuscripts of this so called
bRhacchankaravijaya having been found, I'll be extremely skeptical, even
dismissive, of arbitrary claims conveniently attributed to that text.
Whatever flights of fancy you choose to believe is your problem sir. Please
do not expect everyone else to subscribe to the same fancy!


Kindly permit me to say that I have no reason to believe that  there have
been people  all around, who have been conspiring against the Sringeri math.


This statement of yours is so laughable as to not deserve any response, so
I'm not going to give you one. I just wonder how some generic doubt about
authorship of one or the other text becomes an issue about the Sringeri
lineage in your mind! There is no connection at all that anybody else can
see, but please, have at it. I'm done, trying to respond sensibly to your
latest round of desperate attempts in this misdirection.

Best regards,
Vidyasankar
