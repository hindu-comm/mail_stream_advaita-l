Dear Sri Chandramouli ji,

Could you kindly post here those points of difference that Sri SSS has
listed as between the two bhāṣyas?  It would help members to study them.
In case they are too lengthy, you may pl. scan the pages and send the
images to me personally; which I shall upload somewhere and give the link
here. This roundabout way is because images can't be pasted on mails here,
or even as attachments.

Thanks and regards
