Dear Vidyashankarji,

Yes, precisely for that very  reason I was asking in the group as to what the sixteen (16) Bhashyas that Adi Shankara wrote. I also asked what were the texts Vidyashankara wrote.

Probably Sri Visyashankar wrote the Devi Aparadha Ksamapana Stotra,which was composed by the author at the age of 85 years. Sri Vidyashanlkar seems to fit in as he was  the pontiff for 80 years when he left for Kanchipuram in1198 CE.  Probably it pained him a lot in leaving the math blessed by Mother Sharada  and he could have written that stotra for that raeson. . If you know about the writer of that stotra, you can kindly share.

Regards,
Sunil KB

 Dear Bhaskarji,



 Thank you for quoting from memory. So what Mayeda says about
 SSS's view is correct. After going through the details,
 if you can share more, kindly do. I am trying to get a copy
 of Mayeda's paper, and If I succeed I shall share that
 with the group(s).



 About a couple of years or so ago I read a passing comment
 that the vakyabhashya was by Sri Vidyashankar, but without
 any convincing proof I don't want to talk more about it,
 particularly because it seems that no information is
 available about the works of Sri Vidyashanla, if any.

 Dear Sunilji,
 The best approach towards such
 passing comments is to ignore them. Lots of people, when
 they want to deny authorship of a given text by Adi Sankara
 bhagavatpAda, like to posit one or the other later Sankara
 as the putative author. These things should not be taken
 seriously. If we keep repeating such passing comments years
 after they are made and assuming that they may have some
 merit to them, we will be left in a bed of doubts all the
 time - saMSayAtmA vinaSyati, thus does bhagavAn teach us in
 the gItA.
 There are
 many inscriptional records from the earliest vijayanagara
 period, which praise SrI vidyASankara, the guru of bhAratI
 tIrtha and vidyAraNya, to the skies, with hyperbolic poetic
 language. Not one of them talks of a single text that he
 wrote. Tradition doesn't attribute any of such texts to
 his authorship.

 There are
 also many records that likewise praise vidyAraNya, just one
 generation later. And we also hear of the texts he composed
 in them. Tradition prizes him as the author of many specific
 texts.
 Look at the
 contrast in evidence within a short 50 year period in
 history. When we are specifically told that vidyAraNya wrote
 such and such a text and nobody has tried to foist it upon
 Adi Sankara bhagavatpAda, why should we give any credence to
 fanciful notions that vidyASankara may have written
 something and that it got attributed, mistakenly or
 deliberately, to Adi Sankara instead?
 It should be obvious that attempts
 to foist one or the other bhAshya on vidyASankara are
 desperate measures to somehow deny the authorship of Adi
 Sankara. Such claims don't stand the most basic of
 examinations. Mayeda has made a careful textual analysis,
 examined the previous objections from various sources and
 concluded that the kena vAkyabhAshya is genuinely by Adi
 Sankara bhagavatpAda. Unless his analysis can be
 controverted, and convincingly so, the matter should be laid
 to rest.
 Best
 regards,Vidyasankar
