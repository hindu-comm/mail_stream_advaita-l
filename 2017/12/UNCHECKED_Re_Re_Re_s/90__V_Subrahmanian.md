This position is not logical, for the very purpose of prarabdha bhoga is to
give suffering or other to the person. Unless it is experienced by that
person as pain or pleasure, it is of no use in terming it a bhoga. Ramana
had both kinds of experiences in abundance. Shankara asks in BSB: katham hi
ekasya brahmabhvam, dehadhaaraam cha aparena pratiksheptum shakyam?  How
can anyone dispute the fact of a person having the realization of Brahman
and simultaneously holding the body?   By this, the jnani is definitely
aware of his having a body (see also nava dvaare purey dehi of the BG 5th
ch.). Naturally, the bhoga which is meant to affect the body-mind complex
is experienced / cognized by him.  That his viveka is so strong that he
knows that 'gunaa guneshu vartanta iti' [it is at the body organs mind
level and not affecting the atman] is admitted.
