Bhagavan's life style itself is so wonderful that all are bound to fall in love with Him.

Very unassuming, no riches, no pomp, no show-off....very simple.  All were equal before Him..a brahmin and a chandala.
No VVIP treatments to ministers, celebrities who used to visit Bhagavan.  

Ganapati Muni never ever believed anyone unless he tested the people to the core....but got bowled over
after having the glimpse of Bhagavan !

A crest jewel among the mahAtmAs of this age ! 

rgs,
sriram
