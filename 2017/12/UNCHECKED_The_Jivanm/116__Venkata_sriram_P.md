.........
Sridhar Swamiji was a true Parivrajaka,
.........

Another important aspect of His Holiness was that He never ever touched money in His life and
treated all women as His own mother.  

His Holiness was trained in intricacies of yOga from a great lambikA yogi called Sivananda Yogi.

Swamiji considered Samartha Ramadas as His guru and was initiated in tAraka-mantra.
