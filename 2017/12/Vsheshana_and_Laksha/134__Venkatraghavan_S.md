This is not a problem for advaita, because we are satkAryavAdis. We do not
say that destruction is to a zero. Even after a pot breaks, it continues
existing in its subtle kAraNAvastha, ie it continues to exist in its
material cause. Thus the destruction of pot cannot be cited as something
which has no end.
Regards,
Venkatraghavan
