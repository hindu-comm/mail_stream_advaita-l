Will there be a separate discussion ( later ) on how avidyA is explained as
per Advaita Siddhi or does the siddhikAra references from earlier advaitic
texts?
If so, which ones ? If there is a summary on definition of avidyA as per
siddhikAra, posted here, it will help.

As per Bhamati, sruti mahAvAkya janya aikya jnAna is not aparoksha jnAna?

Thus, as shuddha Brahman is not knowable by any
