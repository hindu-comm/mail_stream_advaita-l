Namaste
I have heard it said that the 3 guNas and 4 varNas are correlated in this
way.

 A brAhmaNa has sattva guNa predominant and rajas in the second place in
his (brAhmaNa's) personality.

A kshatriya has rajas in predominance and sattva in second position

A vaishya has rajas in predominance and tamas in the second place.

A shudra has tamas in first place and rajas in second place.

Does anyone know of any traditional reference which talks of the above or a
similar correlation between guNas and varNas?

Thank you
Om

Raghav
