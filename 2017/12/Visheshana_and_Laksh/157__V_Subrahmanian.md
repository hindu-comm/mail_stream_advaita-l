Many thanks Anand ji, for the reply.  The nyāyakośa reference is
interesting. By 'Vedantins', do they mean only Advaitins?  If yes, we have
a situation where a non-vedantic philosophy recognizing the Advaitin alone
as 'Vedantin.'  A few years ago HH Sri Bharati Tirtha Swamin had given a
talk in which he listed several instances of non-vedantic texts referring
to Advaitins alone as 'Vedantins.'
