Dear Sri Belavadi Shankar
 A small ammendment to your statement "Yes, I have to make a correction to my statement above. Consciousness is NOT part of Brahman,IT is Brahman."
Consciousness is not part of Brahman, It is Brahman. I AM THAT.
   I am neither what I (the entity) think to be nor what I(the entity) appear to be.Upanishads declare : (1)ayamAtmA brahmA sarvAnuBUH ityanuSAsanam||Bruhadaranyaka Upanishad 2-5-19 (2) prajnAaM brahma || Aitareya Upanishad

With regards,Sreenivasa Murthy
