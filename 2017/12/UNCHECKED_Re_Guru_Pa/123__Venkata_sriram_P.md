.....
There are also many websites saying it is by Adi Sankara.
............

Websites are displaying wrong info.   As subbuji mentioned, this was composed by Sacchidananda Sivabhinava Nrisimha Bharati Swamiji.

I am fortunate enough to receive this hymn from the holy hands of Sri.Bharati Tirtha Mahaswamiji.  His Holiness Himself told me this
and this hymn later became the guru-pAdukA stotraM in the lineage of Sringeri henceforth.  All the later AchAryAs chant this everyday
in the morning and remember this guru-s.

rgs,
sriram
