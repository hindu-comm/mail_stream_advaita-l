Yes, there is a chapter later in advaita siddhi itself called avidyA
lakshaNam where multiple definitions of avidyA will be considered for
analysis.

As per the bhAmati, shuddha brahman is not the object of any vritti on the
basis of shrutis like यत्तदद्रेश्यं etc. It is vritti upahita brahman that
is the object of mahAvAkya janya aparoksha jnAnam. As upahita brahman is
vritti vyApyam, it is considered mithyA (drishyatvam = vritti vyApayam in
this school) according to bhAmati. The aikya jnAna generates an akhaNDAkAra
vritti that not only removes avidyA, but avidyA kArya (including the vritti
itself, which is also an avidyA kArya). What remains after the vritti
itself is destroyed is the anupahita, shuddha Brahman.

On the other hand, vivaraNa holds that shuddha Brahman can be the object of
mahAvAkya janya aparoksha jnAnam - it is vritti vyApyam, but not phala
vyApyam. In this school, drishyatvam = shabda ajanya vritti viShayatvam -
the object of any vritti apart from one that is born out of shabda. Thus,
despite Brahman being mahAvAkya janya aparoksha vritti viShayam, it is not
mithyA.
