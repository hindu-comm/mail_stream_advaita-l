In the Taittiriyopanishad bhashya Shankara handles the question: If Satyam
(Sat) is the kaaranam (since Shankara cited the Chandogya passage: sadeva
satyam - sadeva somya idamagra aasiit...) a question is raised: If Sat is
kaaranam, we find that everywhere the kaaranam (upaadaanam) is inert. In
order to answer this question, Shankara says, the shruti itself gives the
next epithet 'jnanam'.  This wards off the defect / doubt that Sat Brahma
that is the kaaranam, is jada.  And jnanam is also defined as pure
consciousness and not any mental modification as in pot, cloth knowledge.
