Thanks. In this post, can we take avidyA to mean as tattva agrahanam, as
mentioned in BUB 1.4.7 ?  (or would you suggest
a more relevant definition in this context ? )

Ok

The aikya jnAna generates an akhaNDAkAra

Can we say,

the aikya jnAna referenced above (bhAmati) is maha vAkya janya alone?
But, the generation of akhaNDAkAra vrtti is based on bhAmati prakriya ?

With the rise and destruction of such a vrtti, the dehAdi upAdi falls away,
soon after?
(or such a one is still subjected to prArabda karma fala upabhoga, as per
bhAmati,
where the upAdhi is functional based on samskAra ?)

Understand this is a deviation from the main topic. Shall search the
archives.
If you have any recommendation or pointers to any refs where this is
dealt in some detail, pl share ?
would be interested in, how the bhAmati school of thought is reconciled
with bhAshya wrt atmAikyatva jnAna and (prArabda) samskAra/avidya lesha?

you meant - Even if mithyAtva (instead of sat) above ..?

+just like in the perception of dream objects, generated due to nidrA doSha,
+perception is not considered as a valid means of knowledge,

(upon waking from dream)

+ (the world) is
+considered mithyA too as it is not revealed by a valid means of knowledge.

(upon jnAna born out of maha vAkyas) ; otherwise it is pratyaksha pramAna
(as you have covered earlier on)

*this definition* - refers to the prev, प्रमाणसिद्धत्वं
चाबाध्यत्वव्याप्यमित्यन्यत् | pramANa siddhatvam is vyApya
for abAdhyatvam ?

Is there a discussion into the intended meaning of sat, as per siddhikAra,
coming
in the future posts? can you share a peek view :)
