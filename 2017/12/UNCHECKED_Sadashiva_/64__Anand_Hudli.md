Here is a treat for music lovers by three maestros Shri Bala Murali
Krishna, Shri  L. Subrahmaniam on the violin, and Shri Hari Prasad
Chaurasia on the flute- Sadashiva Brahmendra's Gayati Vanamali rendered in
Raga Hamsadhvani. One may also notice, on stage, my friend and ex-colleague
Shri Sathish Pathakota, playing the Kanjira.
