This classic piece of Advaita Vedanta was translated here by Swami
Ashokananda of the Ramakrishna Order for the Vedanta Socity of California.
The title of the text, Avadhuta means "liberated soul", while Gita means
song. The text describes the nature and the state of a person who is
spiritually free and liberated.

*tattvamasyadi vakyena*

*swatma hi pratipaditah*

*neti neti shrutir bruyat*

*anritam pancha-bhautikam*

The saying, “That thou art,”

Affirms the reality of your own true Self.

The saying, “Not this, not this,”

Denies the reality of the five composite elements.
