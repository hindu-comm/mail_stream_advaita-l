Stotra and translation -

Dattatreya known as Avadhuta is described in Srimad Bhagavatam. He
describes his 24 Gurus. Anybody can learn from the 24 Gurus because they
are in Nature around us. Guru does not always come to us in Human form and
say 'I am the Guru. I will teach you'. We have to try to learn from Gurus
around us.

The 24 Gurus are described here -

Dattatreya has explained Advaita Tattwa fully in his Avadhuta Gita -
