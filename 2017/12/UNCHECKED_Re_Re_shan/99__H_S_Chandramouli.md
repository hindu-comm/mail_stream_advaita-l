Namaste Sri Ravi Ji,

Reg  << In such a case (B - just “happen” without “experience”), whether
such a jnAni is knowing or knows(aware of) the happening of prarabdha karma
phala ?

what exactly you meant by " just happens without experience" ?

For example: you may take a case of severe head-splitting headache as prarabdha
karma phala>>,

No. The jnani is unaware of it. As an illustration, let us say you are
having a severe headache. All of a sudden, completely unawares, your son
lands from abroad. You are so excited that you go about enjoying his
company completely unaware of your headache. It is a common experience. In
such a case, headache just continues to "happen", but you are not aware of
it.

Reg  <<If such a one is not knowing ( is what you meant by without
experience of the happening) the prarabdha karma phala while it occurs, is
it
due to the continuous atmaikatva jnAna vRtti's taking place ( based on his
will ) without mind entering into nirvikalpa samAdhi state ?
​ >>,

Yes. But why use two terms " ​
continuous atmaikatva jnAna vRtti's taking place
​ " ​
​ and  ​"
without mind entering into nirvikalpa samAdhi state
​ ". Just the first will do. I normally avoid using the term ​"
nirvikalpa samAdhi
​ " since it is too easily confused with the yogic state bearing the same
name. ​

​Regards​
