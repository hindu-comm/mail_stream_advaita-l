Namasthe Chandramouliji and Bhaskaraji,
I have been following your dialogue  concerning Realized Individual. I am
new and also
I am here to learn. I wish to express my understanding of this topic.
When a person becomes 'JnAni' I tend to understand it as 'AtmaJnAni'. And
such person is called 'Jeevanmuktha'. If I am correct then I remember Janaka
as the one whose name comes up in the Upanishads. Such a person will not
do anything to incur 'Karma phala' and he continues to do his 'duty' until
his
body falls off. Regarding the Prarabdha Karma, he just 'observes' without
reacting
to them one way or the other. His work in the form of duty will not incur
any karma
phala. Krishna tells Arjuna the same thing as long as he does not expect
any
return for doing his duty.
This is all my understanding by just reading. I seek advice on these topics
since
I cannot find anyone where I live.

PrAnam
