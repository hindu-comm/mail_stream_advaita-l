Since the announcement contained a picture, maybe the Advaita l forum,
which cannot display this, has not accepted my post.  Here, I am giving,
for the benefit of members a link from where the details can be seen:

https://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/advaitin/conversations/messages/69948

In fact I had only selected the non-picture part of the announcement; yet
it did not get posted in Advaita l. I find that most forums are upgraded to
meet the present needs of posting images.
