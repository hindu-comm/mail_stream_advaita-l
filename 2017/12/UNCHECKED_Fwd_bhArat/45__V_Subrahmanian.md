The pdf is valuable in the sense that it contains a fine overview of the
entire work by the preface.  The noteworthy feature of the work is that Sri
Appayya Dikshitar, in the invocation to his own commentary to his own work
'the Varadaraja stava', thinks of Lord Chandrashekhara, Shiva, and in the
invocation to the main work calls on Lord Mukunda!.

Dear scholars,

may anyone possibly help me acquiring a soft copy of Appaya Dīkṣita’s
Varadarājastava with the svavṛtti-? It seems that no library in my country
keeps a copy of any edition of the text. Here
<https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.496365> I found a digital
version of one of the editions printed in Telugu script. I thought it was
worth enquiring on the list before embarking on the study of Telugu. Thank
you very much in advance!

best,
Andrey Klebanov
