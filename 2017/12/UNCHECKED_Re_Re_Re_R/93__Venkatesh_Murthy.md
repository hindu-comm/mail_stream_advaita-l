Namaste

What about Apantaratamas like Vyasa and so on. They are Jeevanmuktas doing
some work for God. BSB has explained this. They may take births for doing
work of God. Then we cannot say they are not experiencing anything.
Sometimes they may get married and have children also. All this without
experiencing anything is not possible. But even though they are
experiencing the Phala they know it is not real. That is the difference. It
is like you are in a dream and you also know it is a dream.
