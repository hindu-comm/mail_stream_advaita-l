While explaining this verse, HH Swami Paramarthananda ji gave an analogy:
 A man alighted from the back seat of a car.  As he closed the door, one
end of  his angavastram was caught up.  The driver started the car and the
man could not stop him.  He just let the angavastram go.   So too the Jnani
lets go of the body, that is, harbors no sense of 'i or mine' with respect
to the body.
