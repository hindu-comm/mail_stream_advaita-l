I don't know  that verse as you have quoted. It sounds like Hanuman telling
Rama which
boils down to saying Dvaita, Advaita, and Vishistadvaita are technically
the same.

The dialogue between Chandala and Shankara Bhagavadpada went like this:

Chandala was standing on the steps obstructing Shankara's way. Then Shankara
asked Chandala to move. For that Chandala replays: 'Whom do you want to
move,
me or my Atman? Shankara immediately realized that he was Not a Chandala,
and tries to approach him. But Chandala immediately disappears. At that
time
Shankaracharya composed that shloka. This is what I saw in that you tube.
Warm Regards
