*Namaste.  *



*I had  copied the verse in the previous post from the book
SriVidyaranyavirachitah SrimatShankara Digvijayah  published by the
Anandashrama Press. The book includes a Tika also. The Tika mentions
against the verse cited by me that the same verse in ShAlinI v**RRittaM
(Shalini meter ) is as follows. ( This is what I understood )*



*<< **देहबुद्या*  *तु*  *दासोऽहं*  *जीवबुद्या*  *त्वदंशकः* *।*

*चितिबुद्या*  *त्वमेवाहमिति*  *मे*  *निश्चिता*  *मतिः* *॥** >>*



*<< **dehabudyA  tu  dAso.ahaM  jIvabudyA  tvadaMshakaH |*

*chitibudyA  tvamevAhamiti  me  nishchitA  matiH ||** >>*



*Regards*
