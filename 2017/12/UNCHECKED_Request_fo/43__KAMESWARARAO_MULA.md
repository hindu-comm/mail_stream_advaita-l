Dear List Members,                 On theoccasion of the 'Anaghastami' on 10th December (Margasira Krishna Ashtami), we would like to perform the 'Anaghaswami Devi' Vratam, but lacks the procedure. If any body having the puja vidhanam & Vrata Kalpam (Text/pdf), please send it to me so that it will be useful. It can be in Telugu/english/hindi.
I heard that the 'Avadhuta, Datta Paeethadiswara , Sh. Ganapathi Sachhidananda Swamiji' has established the vrata kalpam & people are performing in hyderabad/mysore/bangalore/chennai on different ocassions. I request here any body having the puja vidhana kalpam along with the kadha (5chapters), it will be great help to us to perform the puja on 10/12/17.
