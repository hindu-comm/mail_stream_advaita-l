 Apparently it was a curse by a parrot, as per padma purana. Not sure if it's accurate.

  Interesting. Although I am not sure if tragedy leads to vairagya or sadness/depression. In general, it is viveka that leads to vairagya. Otherwise might as well say Shakespeare's plays leads to vairagya.
>From Dharma perspective, Sita had undergone Agnipariksha. So not sure what the 'rationale' is.

 The principal emotion (rasa) of श्रीमद्रामायण is करुण which is achieved thru शोक (sorrow). Hence, the आदिकाव्य takes off with शोक (sorrow)
with the death of male bird when the two are conjugating. Hence, has to end with सीतापरित्यागः, thus, results in शोक which ends up 
with करुण. 

The रामायण महाकाव्य is a tragedy and study of such tragic poem leads to वैराग्यं. 
As भवभूति says 'एको रसः करुण एव' as also by आनन्दवर्धनः. So, this is from काव्य perspective.

Now, from धर्मः perspective:

संस्थाया धर्मशास्त्रेण शास्त्रं वा व्यावहारिकम् । यस्मिन्नर्थे विरुध्येत धर्मेणार्थं विनिर्णयेत् ॥

When there is a conflict between an assembly, loka-vyavahAra and dharma-shAstra, then one has to
resort to dharma-shAstra only. As भगवान् रामचन्द्रः was a King who was also
'dharma-personified' (रामो विग्रहवान् धर्मः), He acted as per the prescribed राजधर्मः as applicable to 
a क्षत्रिय of that era. 

भगवान् रामचन्द्रः acts as per His स्वधर्मः only but it is we who are unable to comprehend the मर्यादा पुरुषोत्तमः.

इति...
श्रीरामचरणरजोऽभिलाषिन्
