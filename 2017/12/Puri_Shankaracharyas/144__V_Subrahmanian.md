If so, how does one reappear to jAgrat avastha from Nirvikalpa samAdhi, in
the absence of shakti ?

Or, are we saying that, when one attains NS, such a one, no longer comes
back to jAgrat and drops the body from NS ?


What is meant, as I understand, is that the shakti will no longer be a
binding force. I remember even the Panchadashi says this in the same
context if avastha traya, samadhi and the three bodies, sthula sukasma and
karana.
