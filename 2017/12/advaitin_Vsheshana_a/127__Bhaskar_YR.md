Taittireeya bhAshya on brahma svarUpa ( is it 2.1 ?? not sure ) is appropriate to refer.  And how bhAshyakAra explains even words like satyaM jnAnaM etc. cannot directly denote the ‘brahman’.  For that matter in chAndOgya bhAshyakAra clarifies that even the word ‘Atman’ is not denoted to mean ‘Atman’ since there is shruti yatO vAchO nivartante aprApya manasa saha.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
