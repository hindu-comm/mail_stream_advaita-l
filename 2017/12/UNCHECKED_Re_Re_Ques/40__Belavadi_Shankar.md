This is n response to Sri H S Chandramouli's question regarding to
Knowledge and Action:

Swamy Nikhilananda explains in his book-'The Upanishads, page 87 as follows:

 According to Shankaracharya, the path of action and the path of knowledge
cannot be pursued by a person
at the same time. The goal of the former is attainment of happiness ....
and the goal of the latter is the realization
of immorality through knowledge of the identity of Brahman and Atman.
