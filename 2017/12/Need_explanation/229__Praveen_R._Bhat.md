Your question is little on the boundary of the context of the process of
the opponent quoted by Swamiji. The opponent's process is to evolve and
become something one is not. That is just not possible. Coming to your
question, its tricky. One can't say it is not a process since there is
effort involved. However, it is prAptasya prAptiH, gaining of the already
gained, what you already are. Since there is no choice in knowing something
as is, one can't say that ​there is a process of choosing to become. Yet
knowledge takes effort in terms of removing misunderstandings. So
realisation is a process of removing the misconceptions of taking oneself
as something one is not, including the thinking that one will become
absolute while being limited. That is an impossibility.

​Yes, it verily means that.​ This absolute is not like my saying that "O,
my friend is absolutely good", the absolute good there being relative/
subjective. This absolute is the real sense of the word absolute. There
cannot be anything outside of it.

​No, appearances do not contradict the one. A rope can be seen as a snake,
a split in the [path, a stream of water and so on, but the rope always
remains one even when perceived as many.

First of all the creation mentioned itself is just manifestation or
expression of one reality as many. It is not real creation or even
modification. That said, if the cause/ source of all causes were also to
have a cause, it would lead to infinite regress. That is a logical flaw, so
there has to be a cause that is Itself causeless. That is one and brahman
as per Shruti. Moreover, if there is a cause for brahman, that brahman will
not be absolute, as explained earlier.
