​No, it​

​doesn't mean that. In fact it means the reverse of that​-- since there is
nothing apart from brahman, there cannot be an inside or outside. Pls
recall that first para was the opponent's perspective.

​Yes.

Since there is no definite reason for appearance as to why, one may
erroneously conclude that it will always remain. However, Shruti says that
avidyA is the cause and by its destruction, the notion of appearance taken
to be real and eternal will also go.

An undivided change is no change.

​The relevance is by saying that what has never changed was never dual, is
not dual and can never be dual.​

​This is not real transformation, all are appearances​
. It is not pariNAma but vivarta. As  I said earlier, even you may make
eternal erroneous conclusions of rope, the rope will never change.
