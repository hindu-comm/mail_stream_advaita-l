Hari OM!

Sadar Pranam Sri Praveen Ji Maharaj,

I have some questions based on your explanation which is a God send to me:

Sw. Krishnanandaji was an excellent orator and writer and during his time
he stood tall even in Western Philosophy! Here, he has expressed the
Vedantic truth in what seems to be the style of the Kant's critique. This
is what the good Swamiji states:
1) A likely objection is noted that the neti neti method would end up in
shUnya but the (scientific) method is tending to reach the absolute by real
evolution. By this it is said that the continuous improvement is real and
it would tend to become absolute, but never become absolute, since
evolution is a continuous process, and the individual is ever-expanding to
infinity but never really infinity!

Does this mean that the realization of the absolute cannot be a process
because a process is changing every moment? Evolution being a process is
al;so hence unreal......

2) The response starts with a jab at dualists that considering duality as
real, one can blame each action of his on the Lord who prods as the
indweller. However, the happenings in the world and the world itself is not
a creation by the Absolute, since He doesn't act. It is the very nature of
the Absolute to appear as the world (ref Mandukya Karika in 1st chapter on
देवस्य स्वभावः)। However, being an appearance, it is never separate from
the absolute and so not an eternal second entity to be called dual, since
the presence of another entity itself contradicts absoluteness of the
absolute.

Does this mean that the world is not a second absolute, since two absolutes
would be a contradiction?

3) The absolute includes diversity of appearances and rejecting these
finite individual appearances doesn't lead to nihilism. That individuality
also is not an assertion of the absolute but something wrongly assumed to
be real. In the process of negating the duality at many levels of
association, if one doesn't immediately understand one's absolute nature,
still it is an improvement even in the progress. Swamiji uses an
interesting logic to refute these individuals now: since there is an
infinite set of various "finites" spread across space, they cannot really
be divided and thereby, have to remain undivided! Being undivided, there
cannot really be duality. Such duality can be asserted wrongly, but cannot
be proven.

Does the presence of infinite individuaualities not contradict that there
can be only one absolute? How do we arrive at the conclusion that an
infinite set of finites spread across space cannot be divided?

Thank you very very much for your help.

I have another question from the most blessed Swamiji's book:
https://www.swami-krishnananda.org/mundak1/mundak1_3.html

Putmān retas siñcati yoṣitāyām bahvīḥ prajāḥ puruṣāt samprasūtāḥ: In this
manner, the heavenly Purusha is causing, by his own vibration of will, the
creation of every little thing in this world. Even the little crawling
insects are created by the Supreme Purusha. Creation takes place in a
variety of ways, which is only one illustration of the manner of the
relation of cause and effect, highlighting how we, in our crude form of
understanding, imagine how something could have come from something else.
Why should anything come from something else? If something is not there
which is causeless, and if the ultimate cause also has a cause, there would
be a logical regression and the argument will break. A meaningful argument
should have an end. Endless arguments are no arguments. And so, the
argument in respect of the effect coming from a cause should lead to a
cause which itself has no further cause.

Could you please explain this.

Pranam!

OM
