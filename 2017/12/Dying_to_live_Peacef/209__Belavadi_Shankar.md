Namasthe Chandramouliji,

I agree with everything except the sentence; 'Don't worry about right or
wrong'.
Our Vedanta tells us, in essence: Pay attention to your actions. The Law of
Akarm
will keep track of all your actions and make judgement about your future,
especially
the reincarnation. In this regard action done 'Kaya Vacha Manasa' are all
included.

Warm Regards
