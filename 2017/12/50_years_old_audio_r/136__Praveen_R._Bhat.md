Namaste,

Sridhar Swamiji's pravachana mAlikA of ten or so pravachanAs in Kannada is
available on a CD at Varadapur/ Varadahalli ashram. Please note that
although Swamiji has spoken in Kannada, he quotes a lot of Sanskrit
(Upanishads, Gita) and Marathi (Sant. Samartha Ramadas' works, Sant.
Tukaram's works, etc). Another CD of 4-5 pravachanas is also available in
Marathi. There are a lot of others which have and are being transcribed and
printed in books, available at Paduka mandira, at Ramatirtha Honnavar in
Kannada and Marathi.

Kind rgds,
