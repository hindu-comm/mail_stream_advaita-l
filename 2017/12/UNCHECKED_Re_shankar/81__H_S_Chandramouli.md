Namaste Sri  Bhaskar Ji,



Reg  << So, there is a pravrutti of the indriya-s in jnAni due to karma
prAbalyaM. >>,



Why use the word “ due to” ??  Sri Bhagavatpada has not said so. The two
are independent.



Reg  << I think this will not do justice to ‘pravrutti’ of vAng manaH kAya
of the jnAni and as a result  kAma – krOdha of the jnAni which some
traditionalists believe inevitable.>>,



I repeat. “pravrutti” relates to vAsanAs and not prArabdha karma phala.



Reg  << There is demarcation between Atma vidyA (pAramArthika jnana) and
establishment in brahmAnanda and you are implying that for the first
fallout of vidyA is applicable to all and second fallout has to be achieved
with further sAdhana !!??  So, realizing Atmaikatva vidyA (jnana)  is
something different from AtmAnanda (mOksha).>>,



mOksha is also understood as “liberation from future births”. That is
ensured with “realizing Atmaikatva vidyA (jnana)”. What I have further
differentiated is between “Atmaikatva vidyA (jnana)   “ and  “being
continuously established in Atmaikatva vidyA (jnana) “.
