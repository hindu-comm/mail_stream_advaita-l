Sripada Saptathi By Sri Narayana Bhattatri Translated by P.R. Kannan Related



*Sripada Saptathi*

By

Sri Narayana Bhattatri

Translated by P.R. Kannan

>From the blurb:
//‘Sri Melpattur Narayana Bhattatri is the celebrated author of
Narayaneeyam, a devotional poem of about 1000 verses in soulful praise of
Lord Krishna, the god of Guruvayur in Kerala. Sri Bhattatri though cured of
 ailment in his foot longed for peace of mind and bliss which still eluded
him. Tradition has it that the lord of Guruvayur appeared in his dream and
directed him to a place called Mukthisthala and to worship Devi Durga.
Bhattatri, upon Darshan of the goddess, burst out in 70 moving verses in
praise of Devi’s Holy Feet entitled Sripada Saptati.//
