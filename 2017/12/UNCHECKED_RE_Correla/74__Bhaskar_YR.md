Does anyone know of any traditional reference which talks of the above or a similar correlation between guNas and varNas?

praNAms
Hare Krishna

If we see the varNa dharma / karma that has been prescribed in shAstra, we can infer the dominant guNa in a particular varNa.  For example brAhmaNa should have the control over the mind, he has to be saMyamendriya should maintain cleanliness he has to have satva gUna pradhAna kAruNya, shraddhA in shAstra etc.  likewise Kshatriya,  Vaishya, shUdra too have their varNa vihita dharma / karma  ( we can see the details varNAshrama dharma  in  geeta   18th adhyAya) accordingly we may infer which guNa has to be predominant in a particular varNa while discharging these duties.  I am not aware of any reference which is directly linking the varNa with dominant  guNa hence thinking in these lines :-)  You can wait for more accurate quote (may be available in some dharma shAstra).  BTW, modern day brAhmaNa-s like us are admixture of all the four varNa-s when it comes to varNAshrama dharma and karma :-) 

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
