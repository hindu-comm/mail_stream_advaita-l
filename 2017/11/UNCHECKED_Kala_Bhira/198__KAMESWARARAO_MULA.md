Dear Friends,          Baṭuka Bhairava,the son of the goddess CaṇḍīBhairava presides over the holy city in a group of eight calledaṣṭabhairavapaired with a group of eight goddesses calledaṣṭamātṛkā. However, it is no longer possible to reconstitute the spatial organization of theaṣṭamātṛkāas it has been in the Katmandu Valley. Though Kāla Bhairava is the most important and central among them, he is not counted among the eight traditional Bhairavas in the, roughly speaking, eight different directions of the holy city to whom he has relegated his function of Kotwal. Apart from the above eight classical Bhairavas, there are images of Bhairava scattered all about Banaras, either in the open-air or housed in small temples or in a subsidiary position in the temple of some other divinity. Very often Bhairava is represented merely by an amorphous stone heavily bedecked with vermilion. The embryonic implications of Bhairava’s entry into Banaras are reflected in the relationship between his “child” (Baṭuka) manifestation and one or more forms of the benign goddess.Mantra moolam guru vakyam –Guru’s words and by following the mantra –that such heights were reached by the sadhaks. These stories are not myths but are facts that are helplessly trying to tell the modern day man to wake up while there is time and save the Creation, and his individual soul will be blessed and go to higher dimensions, where the pains of the bhulok would be non-existent, Guru being the medium.Sahasrara Mahachakre karpura Dhavale guru, patumam batuko devo bhirava sarva karmasu.Pls find the useful link of bhirava kavachhttps://youtu.be/5rSXXo92DXA
