"Sri Appayya Dikshitar was a renowned scholar and poet and an Advaita
Philosopher of first rank and His fame spread all over India. He is the
reputed author of over hundred works of real merit and importance.  Though
He was an exponent of His own school of thought and has written several
works refuting other philosophies as unsound or untenable He was at heart a
devoted worshipper as much of Vishnu as of Siva. He was not a sectarian
bigot by conviction but when controversy was forced upon Him by others bent
upon polemics in religion or philosophy, they found in Him a foeman more
than worthy of their steel. He abhorred religious controversy but did not
flinch from battle when narrow sectarianism reared its head."
