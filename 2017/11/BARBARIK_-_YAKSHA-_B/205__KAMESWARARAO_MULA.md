Dear Friends,              Barbarikawas originally a yaksha, and was reborn as a man. King Yalamber of Nepal isportrayed as Barbarika in Mahabharata.Barbarika was the son of Ghatotkacha andgrandson of Bheema. God Shiva had given Barabrika three infallible arrows (TeenBaan)—BASICALLY SEARCH AND DESTROY CRUISE MISSILES.He rode to the Mahabharatabattlefield field on his Blue Horse equipped with his three arrows and a bowgiven by God Agni.Before the Mahabharata war began, Lord Krishna asked all thePandavas how many days he would take to finish Mahabharata war alone. Bhishmaanswered that he would take 20 days to finish the war. Dronacharya replied thatit would take him 26 days. When Karna was asked, he said he would take 24 days.Arjuna told Krishna it would take 28 day for him to complete the battle byhimself. In this manner, Lord Krishna asked each warrior and received ananswer.Krishna disguisedas a Brahmin stopped Barbarika to examine his strength. When asked how manydays he would take to finish the war alone, Barbarika answered that he couldfinish it in one minute.Krishna baited Barbarika by mocking him for goingto the great battle with only three arrows. On this, Barbarika replied that asingle arrow was enough to destroy all his opponents in the war, and it wouldthen return to his quiver.



He stated that,the first arrow is used to mark all the things that he wants to destroy. Onreleasing the third arrow, it would destroy all the things that are marked andwill then return to his quiver. If he uses the second arrow, then the secondarrow will mark all the things that he wants to save. On using the third arrow,it will destroy all the things that are not marked.In other words, withone arrow he can fix all his targets and with the other he can destroythem.Krishna then challenges him to tie all the leaves of the peepal treeunder which he was standing, with those arrows. Barbarika accepts the challengeand starts meditating to release his arrow by closing his eyes.Then,Krishna without the knowledge of Barbarika, plucks one of the leaf of the treeand puts it under his foot. When Barbarik releases his first arrow, it marksall the leaves of the tree and finally starts revolving around the leg ofKrishna, forcing Krishna to lift his leg. Krishnato his surprise, finds thatthe first arrow also marks the leaf that was hidden under his foot. Of course,the third arrow does collect all the leaves (including the one under Krishna'sfoot) and ties them together.By this Krishna concludes that the arrowsare so infallible, that even if Barbarika is not aware of his targets, theconscious arrows are so powerful that they can still navigate and trace all hisintended targets.



The moral of thisincident is that, in a real battle field, if Krishna wants to isolate someone(for example: the 5 Pandava brothers) and hides them elsewhere in order toavoid them from being Barbarika's victim, then Krishna will not be successfulas the arrows can still trace the target and destroy them. So, nobody will beable to escape from these arrows. Thus Krishna gets a deeper insight aboutBarbarika's phenomenal power.



This part of Lordkrishna’s foot becomes a weak spot later .Prior to thisevent, lord Krishna also gets a boon from sage Durvasa that his entire bodyexcept his foot will be immune to all weapons. Later in life a hunter by nameJara shoots an arrow at Krishna's foot mistaking him for a deer leads to thedeath of Krishna. In other words, this weak spot on Krishna's foot was firstcreated by Barbarika’s arrow.Krishna then sought charity from Babarika.Barbarika promised him anything he wished. Krishna asked him to give his headin charity. Barbarika was shocked. Perceiving that all was not as it appeared,he requested the Brahmin to disclose his real identity. Krishna showedBarbarika a vision of His Divine Form and Barbarika was thus graced.



In Rajasthan Barbaric is worshipped as Khatushyam babji.
