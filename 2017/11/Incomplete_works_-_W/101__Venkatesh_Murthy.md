Namaste

If you are talking about Padmapada's Panchapadika it is not incomplete work
but rescued work. The story is Padmapada's work on Sutra Bhashya was
destroyed by a fire. But Adi Sankara remembered Panchapadika commentary for
first 4 sutras and dictated it again back to Padmapada. The first 4 Sutras
commentary are the important part and sufficient to give all important
points of the Sutra Bhashya. Nothing is lost.
