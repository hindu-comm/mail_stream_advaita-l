 Namaste,
If my views have hurt anyone, I sincerely apologise for the same. I have no hard feelings for Vaishnavas in general. There are many instances of matrimonial alliance among different sects. However, I am not apologetic about stating the truth. I am not a sycophantic hate-monger or a rabble-rouser. I am not making inflammatory comments against any person or sect. I am merely stating the facts. One has to read Mani Manjari to understand the extent of hatred one can cherish. As to what are the facts is a completely different matter. The previous post about Udupi temple is a clue.
When I say Vaishnavas, I mean their rabidly supremacist ideology which assumes propriety over all temple/deity/affairs. They can practise their supremacist ideology in their own homes or in their mutts. But when you start removing idols from temples, forcefully appropriating a personal view over everyone, meddling in other's affairs repeatedly, you don't have to interpret history because history itself is repeated.
I think in future, the Vaishnavas may even erase vibhuti on Shiva and put their nama instead because for them, he is supposedly a Vaishnava.

If we continue to retrospectively interpret history in the lines of
intra-vedantic-darshana conflicts as above, then the next stop would be to
speculate whether those vaishnava sanyaasis conspired with the five
Bhamani kings to sabotage the great hindu empire only because an advaita
sanyaasi helped to create it ;-)

In that process we can also conveniently sweep under the rug (preferably a
Persian one) all the unparalleled dharma seva done by vaishnava sanyaasis
like Sri Sripada raja, Sri Vyaasa raja and a couple of the latter's
disciples to the kingdom and the kings like Krishnadeva raya. We can also
find fault (self-hypnotism, avidhya, ajnaana ??) of the Vijayanagara
kings who not only recognized these sanyaasis but also the haridaasas as
jewels of their courtrooms.

Historical facts do not matter at all, when we let the dry, blinding colors
of half-cooked, quarter-educated, zero-objective mindset blind our eyes
with khandana, dhooshana and sheer visceral hatred of anybody who does not
follow our favorite philosophy.. even if they are dead and gone swallowed
by actual tides of history.

Maybe pressing the pause button on our guesswork and trying to browse thru
some historical facts would help.. How about
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vijayanagara_Empire and corresponding pages
on Sri Vyaasa raaja, Sri Sripaada raja, Purandara daasa, Kanaka daasa --
all contemporary vaishnava personalities intimately connected with the
golden period of Vijayanagara empire? A book on this perspective
(exclusively) would be William Jackson's Vijayanagara Voices...

thanks
