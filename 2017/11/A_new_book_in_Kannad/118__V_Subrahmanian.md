This is a repeat announcement in view of new members.

A new Kannada book with the title 'Sri Vidyāraṇya Vijaya Dundubhi'  has
been published recently.  This book, authored by Sri.G.R.Patil, Dharwad,
Karnataka, is a third in the line of books on the topic of a supposed
debate between the Madhva pontiff Sri Akshobhya Tirtha and Sri Vidyaranya.
The author has strongly denied the very event.  The first book 'Akshobhya
Vijaya Vibhrama' evoked a lot of reactions and was followed by 'Sri
Vidyāraṇya viṣayaka ākṣepa nirāsa' and the present book is the third.

The present book is primarily a rejoinder to Sri Raghuvijaya Tirtha of Sri
Kudali Arya Akshobhya Tirtha Maṭha, repudiating the objections raised by
him on the first book.  It also rejects the views of, and answers the
doubts raised by, Sri Viśvanandana Tirtha of Hanosoge Maṭha.  The views of
another Madhva are also reviewed and discrepancies thereof disclosed in
this new book.

The book of 450 pages in good print is priced at Rs.250 per copy.

A particular section of the book contains invaluable citations from the
shruti, smriti and purāṇas on the topic of 'nirguṇa, niṣkriya, nirākāra',
etc. Brahman.
