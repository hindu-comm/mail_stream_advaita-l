 Thanks for sharing the samples. Vidyaranya's time is an important landmark in Indian history. There was a power struggle which started during this period between Vaishnavas and Vaidikas which has continued on till date. It is also worthy to take note that the grand Vijayanagara empire rapidly declined and perished soon after the Vaishnavas took the helm. Sorry if it is off-topic.

 This is a repeat announcement in view of new members.

A new Kannada book with the title 'Sri Vidyāraṇya Vijaya Dundubhi' has
been published recently. This book, authored by Sri.G.R.Patil, Dharwad,
Karnataka, is a third in the line of books on the topic of a supposed
debate between the Madhva pontiff Sri Akshobhya Tirtha and Sri Vidyaranya.
The author has strongly denied the very event. The first book 'Akshobhya
Vijaya Vibhrama' evoked a lot of reactions and was followed by 'Sri
Vidyāraṇya viṣayaka ākṣepa nirāsa' and the present book is the third.

The present book is primarily a rejoinder to Sri Raghuvijaya Tirtha of Sri
Kudali Arya Akshobhya Tirtha Maṭha, repudiating the objections raised by
him on the first book. It also rejects the views of, and answers the
doubts raised by, Sri Viśvanandana Tirtha of Hanosoge Maṭha. The views of
another Madhva are also reviewed and discrepancies thereof disclosed in
this new book.

The book of 450 pages in good print is priced at Rs.250 per copy.
Enquiries may be made to: Sri Venkatesh - ph
9036572651, Bangalore. One may contact this email id too:

I have uploaded two samples from the book: 1. A page titled 'Bhīmabala' and
2. The contents page here:

http://www.mediafire.com/download/djttnth033i9bf8/Dundubhi+contents.pdf

A particular section of the book contains invaluable citations from the
shruti, smriti and purāṇas on the topic of 'nirguṇa, niṣkriya, nirākāra',
etc. Brahman.
