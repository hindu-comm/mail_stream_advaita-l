They are prAtibhAsika in my view.

If we define prAtibhAsika as brahma pramA atirikta bAdhyam (that which is
sublatable by something other than brahma pramA), then it is applicable to
them both. Even if we define prAtibhAsika as pratIti mAtra sattvam
(existence at the time of appearance or existence as appearance), it is
applicable to both.

Venkatraghavan

Thanks.

Also, can we say, in these above examples, the appearance of mirage-water
or red crystal is not prAtibhAsika, unlike the prAtibhAsika shell-silver ?
We have to see them as vyavahArika illusions only.
