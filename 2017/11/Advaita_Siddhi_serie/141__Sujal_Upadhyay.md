Pranams Sri Bhaskar Prabhuji,

Yes. I agree. It is also said that the knowledge of Self is permanent I.e.
once potato is boiled it cannot be used as a sees. Similarly, a gyani or
better a jivanmukta cannot get illusioned by Maya.

Thank you Sri Chandramauli ji and others for giving various explanations
and special thanks to Sri Venkatraghvan ji

when a GYAnI is doing some vyavahAra, he may perceive duality, but is

roots his mind in Brahman, nothing else then him-Self is experienced.

Yes, mere seeing computer hard disc, key board, monitor in itself not
avidyA.  To think that they are mutually different, has its own independent
existence and they are also different from computer operator is due to
avidyA bheda buddhi.  Likewise mere walking, running,  eating the food is
not avidyA vyavahAra but thinking that he is kartA bhOkta, saMsAri etc. is
due to avidyA.  ahaM manurabhavaM sUryascha is the vAmadeva rishiâ€™s
realization, his realization does not fetch him the knowledge that manu
sUrya is mithyA OTOH he realized that he  is manu and sUrya because what
pervades  each and everything in this jagat  is ekaM and it is adviteeyaM.



Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
