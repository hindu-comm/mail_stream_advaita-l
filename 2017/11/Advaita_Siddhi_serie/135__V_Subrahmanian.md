Quite an interesting discussion. I think the differentiating factor is
whether the bhrama is sopādhika or nirupādhika. I was listening to the
Adhyāsa bhāṣya exposition in Sanskrit by Vidwan Ganesha Ishwara Bhatta.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-sMzll5GmA   (in the portion towards the
end)  He said: the idea of I with the ego, ahankara, is nirupadhika bhrama,
like the taking the rope to be a snake. However, the considering the mind,
body as I is sopadhika bhrama, like the crystal-red case.

Applying that exposition to the present case, when right knowledge of the
self has arisen, the identification with the ego ceases but the body-mind,
and the world perceived, all continue to be perceived. Unless and until
the red flower is removed from the proximity of the crystal, despite the
knowledge of the colorlessness of the crystal, the perception of the
red-crystal continues. Similarly until the body-mind falls off, upon
physical death, the body-mind and the world continue to be perceived,
despite the knowledge of their unreality.

Maybe someone can put the above in better words.
