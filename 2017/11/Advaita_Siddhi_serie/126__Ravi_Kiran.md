How can one extend this explanation to other examples like mirage water,
*crystal* appearing *red* because of its proximity to the *red* rose etc ?

(since even after the ignorance (material cause of the illusion) is
destroyed , the
effect (prateethi), continues)

Can you elaborate on this (implication) ?

with akhanda brahma sAkshAtkAra, there is no longer prapancha prateethi /
anubhava?

Is it some continuous samAdhi experience, until the upAdhi drops/falls away
of its own accord ?


Thanks
