when a GYAnI is doing some vyavahAra, he may perceive duality, but is detached and not affected by it. When a GYAnI withdraws his senses and roots his mind in Brahman, nothing else then him-Self is experienced.

Yes, mere seeing computer hard disc, key board, monitor in itself not avidyA.  To think that they are mutually different, has its own independent existence and they are also different from computer operator is due to avidyA bheda buddhi.  Likewise mere walking, running,  eating the food is not avidyA vyavahAra but thinking that he is kartA bhOkta, saMsAri etc. is due to avidyA.  ahaM manurabhavaM sUryascha is the vAmadeva rishiâ€™s realization, his realization does not fetch him the knowledge that manu sUrya is mithyA OTOH he realized that he  is manu and sUrya because what pervades  each and everything in this jagat  is ekaM and it is adviteeyaM.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
