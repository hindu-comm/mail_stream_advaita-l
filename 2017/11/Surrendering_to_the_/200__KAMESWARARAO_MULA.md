Dear Friends,            If the unity entity (Individual self/ single cell-kanam) feels th existence of the universality and yet fails to attain him, it gives paychic affection. By Intensive effort & pursuation of the individual the wavelength of the unit mind will increase & one day it will be with the universal's wavelength (frequency SinØ) and finally merge with the microcosmic wave. This merger is termed as " Self-Surrender".

The self resonance of body, mind & soul will make the individual to reach the lotus feet. The stretching & bending vibrations of the Far Infra Red (FIR) light will make the way to reach mountains, rivers, forests, nobody is either mute or silent. Research work should go as per the divine wish of the sriguru and all the karmic actions should resounds with eternal vibrations as if some one is in deep meditation like SriGuru Dakshina Murthy, his silence gives the orders.
Mantra moolam guru vakyam –Guru’s words and by following the mantra –that such heights were reached by the sadhaks. These stories are not myths but are facts that are helplessly trying to tell the modern day man to wake up while there is time and save the Creation, and his individual soul will be blessed and go to higher dimensions, where the pains of the bhulok would be non-existent, Guru being the medium.Sahasrara Mahachakre karpura Dhavale guru, patumam batuko devo bhirava sarva karmasuKameswra
