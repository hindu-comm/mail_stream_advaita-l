Namaste dear list,

I am looking for the disciplic succession of Jyotirmath. I want to check
when Shri Virananda Svami headed the matha (it must be somewhere around
1350s). I tried to find on google but could not locate any
official/authentic information. Any help is appreciated.

Warm Regards,
Kaushalendra das
