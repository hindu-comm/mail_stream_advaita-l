Kartik Ji,



Reg  <<1)How does Shankara define Consciousness? >>,



Consciousness/Chaitanyam is synonymous with Brahman/Atman. For
 
definition, you could refer to verses 4/5 of IshAvAsyOpanishad or
 BruhadAranyaka Upanishad chapters 3-4 ( UshastHa BrahmaNa) and 3-5 (KahOla
BrAhmaNa). There are any number of other places as well.



Reg  << 2)Is Consciousness present in the three gunas of prakriti, viz,
Sattva/Rajasic/Tamasic. >>,



the three gunas of prakriti, viz,
Sattva/Rajasic/Tamasic derive their qualities or strengths from
Consciousness only.



Regards
