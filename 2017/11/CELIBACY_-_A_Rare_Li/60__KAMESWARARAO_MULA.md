Dear Firends, One should understand the Big difference in Out-Look .What we call or names society is simply manifestation of the choices we make. This makes our life turns out & depends on the choices that individual will make on daily basis. One has to remember the fact always that we got this existing physical body by somebody's grace & indeed it was created from the choice of their Joy. Then why we should worry about the materialistic thing what we got from parents, I mean to say it will be taken by your children or grand children which will be decided by time as there is no choice exists here.
The Secret of Life explained by Krishna in Bhagavad Gita (9-1-3) is that since because the disciple trusts me Arjuna, I will tell you what wisdom(prajna) is secret before suffering, forever and those who does not believe me in my teaching , they can't reach me & they will be shuttling between death to death in the physical world.The great British Philosopher Bretrand Arthur William Russell say ' one should have passions in life for love, knowledge search & Pity for suffering of humankind. Love brings ecstasy and relives loneliness. Although knowledge search is essential, but some times it leads to 'AVIDYA'. Pity for the sufferers will make you elevated, brings out broad vision for the humankind who are in endless cycle of samsara i.e Brith-Death.

 Dear Friends,         The ability to look with out motive is missing in the world today, butone has to understand very clearly that every body is psychological creature,wanting to assign meaning to everything. Spirituality is not about looking forgod, truth or the ultimate. It is all about enhancing about our perception. MasterBuddha says “one should stop explaining after a certain level as the peopleunderstands from the perception level. Lord Hanuman never looked for anythingin his life & expected any thing from his master Sri Ram. His celibacynature is to teach people how to pass through in difficult times.If one wants to know spirituality, don’t look for any thing, just learnto look.

I have the opinion that to learn to Look, One should have ‘Celibacy(Manasika Brahmacharya), it is a rate life choice. It is an act of commitment madein the muladhara chakra that give up everything to the Master by which existenceexists today. One has to surrender all the materialistic things earned, self,ego, pride, ahamkar, greadyness, possessive ness, all the arishadvarga qualitiesto the lotus feet. Although it looks like that everything is going from ourhand or pulled off from us initially, it is not at all true, reality is something different, for that one has to look within. Let the Master deside ‘whatto do’, what not to do’, let him use or not to use, his choice of will, we willaccept his decision and start looking differently on the 

path of self-realization leads to moksha marga.
