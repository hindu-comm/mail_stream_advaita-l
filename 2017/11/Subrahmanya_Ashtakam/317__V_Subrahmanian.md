There is also a popular Subrahmanya Bhujanga by Adi Shankara. Sri
Subrahmanya Bhujanga Samashti Parayanam organised by Sarma Sastrigal at a
function held on Sunday, the 22nd November 2015, in Chennai. Second edition
of the book compiled by Sarma Sastrigal was also launched during the
function.

The first edition which was released earlier, a fortnight ago , was well
received by the public. Of course copies were distributed to the public as
gift, free of cost.

Sri Subrahmanya Bhujangam is one of the greatest gifts to the humankind by
Sri Adi Sankara. It has 33 slokas. Sri Subrahmanya Bhujangam holds out the
hope that those who chant it daily with devotion shall win His grace,
bestowing a life of plenitude and final beatitude.
