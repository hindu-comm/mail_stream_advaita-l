Dear Friends,           This was If the unity entity (Individual self/ single cell-kanam) feels th existence of the universality and yet fails to attain him, it gives paychic affection. By Intensive effort & pursuation of the individual the wavelength of the unit mind will increase & one day it will be with the universal's wavelength (frequency SinØ) and finally merge with the microcosmic wave. This merger is termed as "Self-Surrender". I mean giving everything to the lotus feet or surrendering to TIME on the occasion of KalaBhairavastami.
The self resonance of body, mind & soul will make the individual to reach thelotus feet.The stretching & bending vibrations of the Far Infra Red (FIR) light will make the way to reach mountains, rivers, forests, nobody is either mute or silent. Research work should go as per the divine wish of the sriguru and all the karmic actions should resounds with eternal vibrations as if some one is in deep meditation like SriGuru Dakshina Murthy, his silence gives the orders.
Jai Jai Maha Deva Karunabdi Maha Devo Sambho, Bhiravaya Namastubhyam, Pahi Pahi Rakshatu

 Namaste

This is a beautiful stotra by Adi Shankara on Kaala Bhairava. Every line
ends in काशिकापुराधिनाथकालभैरवं भजे. Kaala Bhairava is the ruler of Kashi.
People living there must live there with His permission. The most important
Kaala Bhairav temple is in Kashi at a distance of 2 Km from Kashi
Vishwanath temple. The temple is dedicated to the fiercest form of
Shiva and wears a garland of skulls and carries a club of peacock feathers.
The word Kaala means both death and fate. It is believed even death is
afraid of Kaala Bhairava.

The Vahana of Lord Bhairava is the dog. Even today we can see people
offering nice garlands and food to dogs in the Kaala Bhairava temple.

Listen to the stotra. At the end of the song the story of Kaala Bhairava is
explained in English -
