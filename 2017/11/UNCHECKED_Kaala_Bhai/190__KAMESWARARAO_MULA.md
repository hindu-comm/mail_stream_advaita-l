Dear Friends,          Baṭuka Bhairava,the son of the goddess Caṇḍī. Bhairava presides over the holy city in a group of eight calledaṣṭabhairavapaired with a group of eight goddesses calledaṣṭamātṛkā. However, it is no longer possible to reconstitute the spatial organization of theaṣṭamātṛkāas it has been in the Katmandu Valley. Though Kāla Bhairava is the most important and central among them, he is not counted among the eight traditional Bhairavas in the, roughly speaking, eight different directions of the holy city to whom he has relegated his function of Kotwal. Apart from the above eight classical Bhairavas, there are images of Bhairava scattered all about Banaras, either in the open-air or housed in small temples or in a subsidiary position in the temple of some other divinity. Very often Bhairava is represented merely by an amorphous stone heavily bedecked with vermilion. The embryonic implications of Bhairava’s entry into Banaras are reflected in the relationship between his “child” (Baṭuka) manifestation and one or more forms of the benign goddess.
Pls find the useful link of bhirava kavach as it says " Sahasrara Mahachakre Karpura dhavale guru patumam Batuko devo Bhiravah Sarva Karmasu

 Namaste

This is a beautiful stotra by Adi Shankara on Kaala Bhairava. Every line
ends in काशिकापुराधिनाथकालभैरवं भजे. Kaala Bhairava is the ruler of Kashi.
People living there must live there with His permission. The most important
Kaala Bhairav temple is in Kashi at a distance of 2 Km from Kashi
Vishwanath temple. The temple is dedicated to the fiercest form of
Shiva and wears a garland of skulls and carries a club of peacock feathers.
The word Kaala means both death and fate. It is believed even death is
afraid of Kaala Bhairava.

The Vahana of Lord Bhairava is the dog. Even today we can see people
offering nice garlands and food to dogs in the Kaala Bhairava temple.

Listen to the stotra. At the end of the song the story of Kaala Bhairava is
explained in English -
