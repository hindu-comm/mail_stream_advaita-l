Namaste

This is a beautiful stotra by Adi Shankara on Kaala Bhairava. Every line
ends in काशिकापुराधिनाथकालभैरवं भजे. Kaala Bhairava is the ruler of Kashi.
People living there must live there with His permission. The most important
Kaala Bhairav temple is in Kashi at a distance of 2 Km from Kashi
Vishwanath temple. The temple is dedicated to the fiercest form of
Shiva and wears a garland of skulls and carries a club of peacock feathers.
The word Kaala means both death and fate. It is believed even death is
afraid of  Kaala Bhairava.

The Vahana of Lord Bhairava is the dog. Even today we can see people
offering nice garlands and food to dogs in the Kaala Bhairava temple.

Listen to the stotra. At the end of the song the story of Kaala Bhairava is
explained in English -
