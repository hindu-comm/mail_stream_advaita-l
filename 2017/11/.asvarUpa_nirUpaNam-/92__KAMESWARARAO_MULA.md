Dear Sir,         It is the moderators will , I should contribute or not, it is their choice &decision and accept it.It seems your note looks like correct and to avoid any of the legal issues, better I should not post much to the list. How ever List masters, moderators can advise how should i contribute to avoid legal matters.Other than that I will not be able to contribute much after November 26th as the left over time is too short to spend.
regardsKameswara Rao

Dear Sir

Thanks for your posts to advaitaL.

On a side note, I find that the signature of your emails with legal disclaimers on confidentiality and privileges appear to contradict the open nature of the AdvaitaL portal.
Also you seem to be placed in a very sensitive position with respect to defense research in India.

It is my humble suggestion to not disclose the official governmental contact information and also avoid putting legal disclaimers in an open list such as AdvaitaL.

In this regard I also copy the list moderators.

Kind regards,
Jagannathan.
