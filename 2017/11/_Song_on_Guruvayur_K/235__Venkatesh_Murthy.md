''It is said that Chembai Bhagavathar almost lost his voice in a concert
which the medical experts could not rectify. It seems he prayed to the
deity in GuruvAyUr (Krishna) and sang this particular song after which he
got back his full voice. Later on he always concluded every concert with
this song as a token of everlasting gratitude.''

''The composer and musician, irayimman Thampi (also known as iravivarman)
(1783--1856) was the uncle of Maharaja SwAthi tirumAL (1813-1846) of the
ThiruvAnkUr kingdom.''
