Namaste

Nice Song by T S Ranganathan -

https://youtu.be/XQkGeW_OZ88

Adi Sankara has used Bhujanga Prayaata metre in this Stotra. Bhujanga
Prayaatam Chaturbhir YakaaraiH. There are 4 Ya Ganas in every Paada. There
are 4 Paadas in a Sloka. What is Ya Gana? It has three Aksharas - first
Laghu second Guru and third Guru. That means one short Akshara and two long
Aksharas following.

Example - If you look at the first Paada in 9th Sloka it is Mahaadeva
Devesha Devaadideva. It is broken into Ma-haa-de-, va-de-ve, sha-de-vaa-,
di-de-va. The last Akshara can be taken as long. In Ma-haa-de the first Ma
is short, haa is long and de is long also.

Bhujanga Prayaata means it is like a snake's movement. It gives feeling to
listener of a snake going.
