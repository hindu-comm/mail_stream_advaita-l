Thank you Niranjan Ji.  Will go thru the paper tonight.  Meanwhile, I was going thru the work authored by Shri.Madhusudan Ojha Ji, a great sanskrit & vedic scholar, who says that:

द्विविधा हीयमुपनिषद् भवति - श्रौति, स्मार्ती च । तत्र भेदकरणविदक्षया स्मार्तोपनिषदि गीता शब्दः प्रयुज्यते । पूर्वं केनाप्युपदिष्टस्यार्थस्य पुनरुपदेशो गानम् । स्वल्पकायस्य सतो वाग्विन्यासस्य विताने "गायति" शब्दस्य विवक्षितत्वात् । 

अर्जुने विमनस्के च गीता भगवता स्वयम् - इति महाभारते १२।३।८

स इत्थं यौगिकत्वात क्रियाशब्दत्वाच्चायं विशेषभूतोऽपि गीता शब्दः पश्चात क्रमेण स्मार्तोपनिषदि रूढः संपन्नः 

..............

My liberal translation:

There are 2 types of upanishads viz., shrauta & smArta.  So, to differentiate b/w the two, the smArta upAnishad has been named as 'gItA'.  The discussions that used to take place b/w guru & sishya in days of yore regarding Atma-vidyA when re-enacted again was termed as 'gAnaM'. 

Rest is understood...i believe.

 Dear Scholars,

 I would like to know the etymological and real meaning of
 the word गीता. Is the translation
 'song' appropriate 
 for this?
