KALBHIRAV JAYANTIDear Friends,         Bhairava, the terrifying aspect of Śiva, is the god of transgression par excellence, for he appears only to cut off the head of Brahmā, brahmanicide being the most heinous crime. Brahmā refused to recognize the supremacy of Śiva, who therefore created Bhairava and ordered him to decapitate Brahmā, promising him in return eternal suzerainty over his city of Kāśī (Vārānasī, Banaras), the cremation ground of the Hindu universe, where final emancipation is assured to all. However, the skull-bearing Bhairava had to expiate his crime through twelve years of wandering before gaining access to Kāśī. His guilt relentlessly pursues him in the form of a maiden called “Brahmanicide” (Brahmahatyā). Cast in the image of his sex partner (Bhairavī), Brahmahatyā appears in all her ambiguity as both his supreme punishment and his sole means of beatification, and thus imposes a causal connection between the two opposed meanings: it is through his transgressive sacrality (= brahmanicide) that Bhairava becomes the supreme principle of the universe. From the gender perspective, the feminine element indispensable to tantric sexuality is represented here as the ultimate transgression of the Brahmanical tradition. The maiden Brahmahatyā—or rather, the guilt of brahmanicide—is barred access to the holy city. On reaching Banaras, Bhairava plunges into a tank called Kapālamocana (“liberation of the skull”) to bereborn as the Kotwal or District Magistrate of the sacred city,who now chastises and liberates everyone at the moment of death through a metaphysical punishment calledbhairavī-yātanā. At the same time, Bhairava remains at that spot as a scapegoat (pāpabhakṣaṇa) taking upon himself the sins of all pilgrims.संसारस्यान्तकालेनररुधिरवशासम्प्लवेभूमधूम्रे|कालीकापालिकीसाशवशयनतरायोगिनीयोगमुद्रारक्तारुद्धिःकालीकापालिकीत्वंशवशयनरतायोगिनीयोगमुद्रा।रक्त्ताॠद्धीकुमारीमरणभवहरात्वंशिवाचण्डधण्टा।स्तोत्रेणानेनदेवेशी!किंनसिद्धयतीभुतले।सर्वशान्तीर्भवेद्!चानतेनिर्वाणतांव्रजेत्।।Lord Bhirava destroyer of the fear, the DHARMA setu palaka, will make the way to his disciples to cross the vaitarini river so that death will not occur and no need to be born again & makes not to fall in the cycle of samsara.Jai Guru!

  (Around the beginning of the month, a nugget of Wisdom from the Jagadguru may be posted
on the Chaturamnaya list : http://lists.advaita-vedanta.org/cgi-bin/listinfo/chaturamnaya )

Man has a peculiar disposition. He expects to attain all that his heart desires. He seeks immediate
fulfillment of all that he wishes for. Not understanding the improbability of such outcome,
he gives room for anxiety and anger. It is indeed futile to desire gratification of all expectations
without reflecting upon matters such as karma, or the results obtained in right time according to
karma and the Lord's dispensation of the results.

Nothing happens outside the ambit of time and cause and effect. To understand how the wheel of time
(and destiny) spins, one must have some orientation towards adhyatmic vichara (spiritual enquiry).

One must read at least a few verses of the Bhagavad Gita everyday. If one were to adhere to the path
instructed in the Gita by the Lord, one would be able to remain peaceful. If the blessings of the
Guru are obtained, one becomes eligible to listen to Vedanta. As sadhana (spiritual practice)
intensifies, man is able to control his senses and the stream of desires in him. Contentment dawns
only in a mind that is in control and only such a person can lead a happy life.

This is what our forefathers have advised: 

 yadRRichchhayopapannena santuShTo vartate sukham.h .
 naasantuShTastribhirlaukairajitaatmopasaaditaiH ..

He who feels happy over what is obtained sans expectations, leads a peaceful life. He who has not controlled his senses and mind will not be satisfied even if he becomes the master of all the three worlds. 
Our blessings for all to understand this well.
