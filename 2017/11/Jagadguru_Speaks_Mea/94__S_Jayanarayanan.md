 (Around the beginning of the month, a nugget of Wisdom from the Jagadguru may be posted
on the Chaturamnaya list : http://lists.advaita-vedanta.org/cgi-bin/listinfo/chaturamnaya )

Man has a peculiar disposition. He expects to attain all that his heart desires. He seeks immediate
fulfillment of all that he wishes for. Not understanding the improbability of such outcome,
he gives room for anxiety and anger. It is indeed futile to desire gratification of all expectations
without reflecting upon matters such as karma, or the results obtained in right time according to
karma and the Lord's dispensation of the results.

Nothing happens outside the ambit of time and cause and effect. To understand how the wheel of time
(and destiny) spins, one must have some orientation towards adhyatmic vichara (spiritual enquiry).

One must read at least a few verses of the Bhagavad Gita everyday. If one were to adhere to the path
instructed in the Gita by the Lord, one would be able to remain peaceful. If the blessings of the
Guru are obtained, one becomes eligible to listen to Vedanta. As sadhana (spiritual practice)
intensifies, man is able to control his senses and the stream of desires in him. Contentment dawns
only in a mind that is in control and only such a person can lead a happy life.

This is what our forefathers have advised: 

 yadRRichchhayopapannena santuShTo vartate sukham.h .
 naasantuShTastribhirlaukairajitaatmopasaaditaiH ..

He who feels happy over what is obtained sans expectations, leads a peaceful life. He who has not controlled his senses and mind will not be satisfied even if he becomes the master of all the three worlds. 
Our blessings for all to understand this well.
