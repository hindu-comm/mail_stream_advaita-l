Namaste,
..................
There is one shloka in Manu Smriti about performing three प्रजापत्य कृच्छ also. 
.............
I discussed this issue with our Acharya Br.Sri. Narendra Kapre-ji.  His advice is to go ahead with 
प्रजापत्य कृच्छ which is feasible in current circumstances.  Rest are difficult to follow and practice.

He has also advised to perform panchagavya-prAshana and nAma-smaraNa (pref. rAma mantra japa) that
cleanses off the sins.

After upanayana, performance of sahasra gAyatri japa regularly everyday would absolve all doshas.

regs,
sriram
