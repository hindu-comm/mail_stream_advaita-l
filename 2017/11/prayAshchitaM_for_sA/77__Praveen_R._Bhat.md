It appears that the above solution in Apastamba of following all of
Brahmachari's vows (except for agnikArya, vedAdhyAyana and gurusuSrUSha)
synchronising with a Rtu is valid only if upanayana is done immediately
afterwards, before 19 years of age is attained! There is more to be done
after the upanayana too, but its not applicable since your prospective
students are 23 yrs old.

Other than above for 18-19 age range, following seems the solution, which
is how you too seem to have landed on vrAtyastomayajna in your
dharmashAstra too.
19-20: 3 rounds of cAndrAyaNavrata.
20-21: uddAlakavrata.
21-22: avabhRtasnAna in ashvamedhayajna (and in Kaliyuga, uddAlakavrata as
well as 17-day yAvakavrata).
22+: vrAtyastomayajna.

That said, I am sure you will not give up on the students since people
wanting to study Vedas is rare and should be encouraged. To that effect, I
do feel that some simpler solution will definitely come to light when you
talk to some traditional scholar, HH Shankaracharya or with a Vedic
assembly.
