Some discussions are going on regarding this in FB also.   A person is saying that Madhvacharya
was murdered in Udipi Ananteshwara temple by local brahmins and the records are hushed up.  

Owing to this assassination of acharya, there is a 'doSa' associated which was
revealed in 'aSTa-mangaLa-praSna' and hence prAyaschitta is performed by every year. 

It is a news for me !  

rgs,
sriram
