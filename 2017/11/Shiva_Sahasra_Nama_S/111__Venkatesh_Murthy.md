There are three main Sahasra Nama Stotras - Mahabharata, Siva Purana and
Linga Purana. The Mahabharata's Siva Sahasra Nama is most popular. Most of
the available audios have this. There is one very good audio of Linga
Purana type by K.V. Raman but I could not find it on the Web. I have it in
my personal collection somewhere in some old CD.
