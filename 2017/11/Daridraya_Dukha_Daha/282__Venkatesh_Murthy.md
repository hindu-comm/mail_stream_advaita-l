In Geeta 6-41 Krishna says -

प्राप्य पुण्यकृतां लोकानुषित्वा शाश्वतीः समाः ।
शुचीनां श्रीमतां गेहे योगभ्रष्टोऽभिजायते ॥ ४१ ॥

Sankara Bhashya -

योगमार्गे प्रवृत्तः संन्यासी सामर्थ्यात् प्राप्य गत्वा पुण्यकृताम्
अश्वमेधादियाजिनां लोकान् , तत्र च उषित्वा वासमनुभूय शाश्वतीः नित्याः समाः
संवत्सरान् , तद्भोगक्षये शुचीनां यथोक्तकारिणां श्रीमतां विभूतिमतां गेहे गृहे
योगभ्रष्टः अभिजायते ॥ ४१ ॥
The person fallen from Yoga will get chance again to become successful. He
may be born in a rich family following Vedic rules after staying in world
of Ashwamedha sacrificers for many years.

He can also be born in a family of Yogis poor but having Knowledge.

अथवा योगिनामेव कुले भवति धीमताम् ।
एतद्धि दुर्लभतरं लोके जन्म यदीदृशम् ॥ ४२ ॥

Sankara Bhashya -

अथवा श्रीमतां कुलात् अन्यस्मिन् योगिनामेव दरिद्राणां कुले भवति जायते धीमतां
बुद्धिमताम् । एतत् हि जन्म, यत् दरिद्राणां योगिनां कुले, दुर्लभतरं
दुःखलभ्यतरं पूर्वमपेक्ष्य लोके जन्म यत् ईदृशं यथोक्तविशेषणे कुले ॥ ४२ ॥

This birth in family of poor Yogis with Knowledge is very rare even
compared to the birth in rich family. Why? Because in a rich family he will
have wealth and wealth always comes with attachments to worldly things. But
in a poor family he will not have distractions and he can practice his
Yogic discipline fully without disturbance. Anandagiri Teeka is saying
धीमतां means Knowers of Brahma Vidya -  Brahmavidyaavataam. Where can be a
better birth than this family?

Then why is Daridrya Dukha Dahana Stotra required? What is the use if
Daridrya is better than being rich? There are 2 types of poor people. One
is a poor person but he is unhappy and he is experiencing sorrow because of
poverty. He is in Pravrutti Marga. Another is poor person but he is still
happy. He is contented with even a little he has and he is always happy. He
is in Nivrutti Marga. Many Sanyasis and Brahmacharis are like this. They
will not have wealth but they are not complaining. They are not after
worldly affairs. Therefore by Ishwara Anugraha the Pravrutti Marga poor
person will get wealth to solve his problems. The Daaridrya Duhkha Dahana
is doing that. The Nivrutti Marga person is singing Ishwara's praises with
Bhakti and he does not require any wealth.

This is also according to 7-16.

Four types of people naturally approach God. One of them is person asking
for wealth. But the Jnani is the best and he is dear to God. He is the
Self. उदाराः सर्व एवैते ज्ञानी त्वात्मैव मे मतम् ।

In Geeta 7-16,17  Krishna says -

चतुर्विधा भजन्ते मां जनाः सुकृतिनोऽर्जुन ।
आर्तो जिज्ञासुरर्थार्थी ज्ञानी च भरतर्षभ ॥ १६ ॥

तेषां ज्ञानी नित्ययुक्त एकभक्तिर्विशिष्यते ।
प्रियो हि ज्ञानिनोऽत्यर्थमहं स च मम प्रियः ॥ १७ ॥
