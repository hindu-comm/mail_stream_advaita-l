There are various versions of the story of Ashwatthama. The Pallava dynasty
that is described in the post I shared is based on an inscription of the
6th or 7th CE.

One story says that he was the King of Panchala.

There is also a story that has Ashwatthama getting cured of the curse,
leprosy, etc. due to Shakti worship. He is believed to become the next Veda
Vyasa.
