Adi Sankara has referred to this Sloka in Vishnu Sahasra Nama Bhashya -

ध्यायन्कृते यजन्यज्ञैस्त्रेतायां द्वापरेऽर्चयन् ।

यदाप्नोति तदाप्नोति कलौ संकीर्त्य केशवम् ॥६-२-१७ Vishnu Purana

'What is gained through Meditation in Krita Yuga through performing
sacrificial rites in Treta Yuga, through ritual worship in Dvaapara Yuga is
obtained in Kali Yuga by reciting the names of Keshava.'

There is no better sin destroying action in Kali Yuga than Nama
Sankeertana. In Vishnu Sahasra Nama Bhashya these Slokas are also referred
-

अवशेनापि यन्नाम्नि कीर्तिते सर्वपातकैः ।

पुमान्विमुच्यते सद्यः सिंहत्रस्तैर्वृकैरिव ॥

यन्नामकीर्तनं भक्त्या विलायनमनुत्तमम् ।

मैत्रेयाशेषपापानां धातूनामिव पावकः ॥ 6-8-19, 20 Vishnu Purana

'By the repetition of whose name man is undoubtedly liberated from all
sins, which fly like wolves that are frightened by a lion. The repetition
of his name with devout faith is the best remover of all sins, destroying
them as fire purifies the metals from the dross.'

Bhagavata 1-1-14 -




*āpannaḥ saṁsṛtiṁ ghorāṁ yan-nāma vivaśo gṛṇantataḥ sadyo vimucyeta yad
bibheti svayaṁ bhayam*

*'*Living beings who are entangled in the complicated meshes of birth and
death can be freed immediately by even unconsciously chanting the holy name
of Kṛṣṇa, which is feared by fear personified.'

In the Gita also it is said Yajnanam Japa-Yajno 'smi. The best Yajna is
Bhagavan Nama Japa.

Adi Sankara has tailor made this Achyutashtakam for Bhagavan Nama
Sankeertana. He has packed it with the beautiful names of Bhagavan.

Example Sloka -

कृष्ण गोविन्द हे राम नारायण
श्रीपते वासुदेवाजित श्रीनिधे ।
अच्युतानन्त हे माधवाधोक्षज
द्वारकानायक द्रौपदीरक्षक ॥४॥
We can see above how the glorious names of Bhagavan are packed in the Sloka.
