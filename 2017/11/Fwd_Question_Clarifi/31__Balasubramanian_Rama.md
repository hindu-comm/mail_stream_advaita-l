Hello Raghav,

I don't have the time to go into this in detail right now. This requires a
whole paper, which I am in the process of writing. The svarita being udAtta
for half of the mAtra and anudAtta for the other half is only one of many
different ways of pronouncing a svarita according to ancient authorities.
It is clear from the prAtishAkhyas that there were many different
authorities who had different opinions on how svarita should be pronounced.
Now it's solidified into a few different traditions, and one should follow
sva-sampradaaya.

I hope the latter description below (de_vasya! is anudAtta-svarita-udAtta)
was not given by anyone teaching this subject. If it was, please run from
that place ASAP.

Rama
