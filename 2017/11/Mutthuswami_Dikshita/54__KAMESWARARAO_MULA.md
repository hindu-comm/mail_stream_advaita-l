Dear Sir,


   Being a Research Scholar since my child hood, the quest for searching & understanding the Siddhantha, vedanta & mimansa. I am actually looking for books fromSri Appayya Dikshithar 'Mimamsa Vedanta Sastra'.The questions and answers given here are intended to explain and make clear the basic truths of the twoMimasa Sastras i.e Purva & Uttara .These have never been clearly written anywhere else. But Sri Appayya Dikshita states that the tenets contained in them have been accepted as the basis for the truths of the Bhashya. In one of his excellent works of Chitrapata, he teaches the rules ofMimamsa.I really want those collection of works, books. Kindly advise/suggest how to get this information as I don't get any of the books here.
With respectful regardsKameswara Rao
