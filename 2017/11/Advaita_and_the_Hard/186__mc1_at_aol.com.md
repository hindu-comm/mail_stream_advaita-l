Namaste
I imagine the forum has previously discussed the scientific Hard Question but when asked for scientific thinking on classic Advaita Vedanta, Susan Blackmore responded: "This is a very difficult question. I don't think there's any science specifically on 'Nondual conscious reality' although there is a general consensus that dualism doesn't work so we must find some non-dual solution to the hard problem of consciousness. 



Perhaps someone on the forum might have a lead to offer me or take the lead and write a nice paper. :)



two nice intro podcasts:
first,  dan dennett explains consciousness
