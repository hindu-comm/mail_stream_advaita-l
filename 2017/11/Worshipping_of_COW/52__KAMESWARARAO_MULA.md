OurMaha Swami, Karpatri Maharaj founded theRam Rajya Parishad& prominent agitator in 1966 anti-cow slaughter agitation.



As per our Purana’s & Rig-Veda samhita, Indra sent the Deva-shuni to look for the cows.Indra first sends asupernatural bird Suparna to retrieve the cows, but he proves disloyal. Indrathen deputes Sarama, who agrees to find the cows on the condition that herchildren will be given milk. This deal secures milk not only for her children,but also for mankind. "Though knowing The Truth, a person out of greed inthis earthly life, loses all senses of values, Sarama, who knew The Truth,begged food from Indra on the occasion of redeeming the children i.e cattle’s.Aurobindo say’s that, "Saramais some power of Light i.e. the Dawn". She "must be a forerunner ofthe dawn of Truth in the human mind". Max Müller relates Sarama to theUshas, the Dawn. The tale of kidnapping of the cows and their recovery, heexplains, is the disappearance of the bright cows or rays of the Sun. Sarama,the Dawn, finds them and is followed by Indra.
