>>

>>
>> *TapasA*, through knowledge, by virtue of possessing the knowledge of

>> of creation--- when desirous of creating this world, like a seed sending
>> out its sprout ; *cIyate*, increases in size, as a father procreating a
>> son does out of elation. From that Brahman, thus become inflated because of
>> Its possession, through Its omniscience, of the power and knowledge of
>> creation, preservation, and dissolution ; *abhijayate*, originates (
>> grows ) *annam*, food ; the word being derived from the root *ad* in the
>> sense of that which is eaten, i.e. enjoyed, means the Unmanifested ( MAyA )
>> that is common to all creatures. ( That food originates or ) gets evolved
>> into the states of imminent manifestation. ( Footnote ; The beginningless
>> MAyA is the unmanifested food ; the Upanishad speaks of its origin in the
>> sense of its becomimg ready for evolution. Otherwise MAyA has no
>> beginning). From that Unmanifested, i.e. from that food in a state of
>> imminent manifestation. ( was born ) *prANaH*, Hiranyagarbha, who is
>> common (Footnote ; He is the sum total of all the individuals. Being common
>> to all, He is called Sutra, the thread (running through all). End of
>> Footnote) to all the beings in the universe that are endued with ( a part
>> of His ) power of knowledge and action, who sprouts from that seed of all
>> beings, constituted by ignorance, desire, and action, and who identifies
>> Himself with he universe ; “was born” this is to be supplied. From that
>> Hiranyagarbha evolved *manah*, that which is called the (cosmic) mind,
>> comprising volition, deliberation, doubt, determination, etc., evolved
>> *satyam*, the five elements, such as space etc., which are called satya
>> (i.e. the gross, *sat*, and the subtle, *tyat*). >>.
