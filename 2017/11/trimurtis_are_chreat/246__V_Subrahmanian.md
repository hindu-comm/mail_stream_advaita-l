Dear Raghav ji,

I don't think Chandramouli ji is talking about kāraṇa brahman. He knows
Hiranyagarbha is a created being; directly from Avyākṛta is his view at
present.  I just want to add that the Vedanta Paribhasha portion he cited
latest mentioning 'Hiranyagarbha sthūlaśarīra, as I guessed, it is stated
in the subcommentary that this refers to Virāt. In Advaita this Virāṭ is
admitted to be the samaśṭi sthūla śarīra abhimāni and with his creation
starts the fourteen worlds' creation. Hiraṇyagarbha is the samaṣṭi sukṣma
śarīra abhimāni. While he is termed 'prathamaja', the Virāṭ is termed
'prathama śarīri', as I understand. Sometimes their distinct identity is
also not maintained.

I suppose no one would contend with the above para?

This position is not flawed.
