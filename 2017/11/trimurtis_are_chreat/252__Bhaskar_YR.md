To my understanding, it is clear that according to this Bhashyam,

Hare Krishna

The discussing issue will be much clear if we investigate the origination of Ishwara (sOpAdhika brahma), chaturmukha brahma, hiraNya garbha, virAt purusha, prajApati, prathamaja etc.  as per our shAstra-s.  BTW, do we really have issue here when we already determined that jagat / Ishwara is mere jeeva's avidyA kalpita srushti??  Just wondering.  

Hari hari Hari Bol!!!
