Stotra and Translation -

http://www.hindupedia.com/en/Paramacharya%27s_Durga_Pancha_Rathnam
In the third Sloka there is a reference to Swetashwatara Upanishad Vaakya -
'parasya shaktihi vividhaiva suryaese swetaswa vakyothitadevi durge'.

Shiva and Shakti are same. If Shakti is Maayaa only how can She be Brahman?
For this we have to say there are two Shaktis. One is Paraa Shakti and
another is Aparaa Shakti. The Paraa Shakti is same as Nirguna Brahma. The
Aparaa Shakti is same as Maayaa same as Avidyaa.  In 1-1-5 Sankara Bhashya
itself he has given Swetashwatara Upanishad reference - Paraasya Shaktir
Vividhaiva Sruyate. In 1-1-1 he has said Asti Taavad Brahma Nitya Suddha
Buddha Mukta Svabhaavam Sarvashakti Samanvitam.
