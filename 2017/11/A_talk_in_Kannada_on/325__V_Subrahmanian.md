A talk in Kannada on Shankaracharya's compassion

Here is a talk by HH Sri Shankara Bharati Swamiji. The Kannada talk is
preceded by a welcome address in Hindi and a rendition of the Nirvāṇaśatkam
of Shankaracharya in bhajan format. Even though the talk by HH is in
Kannada, it can be followed and appreciated by everyone who has a knowledge
of one or more South Indian languages and Hindi/Sanskrit.
