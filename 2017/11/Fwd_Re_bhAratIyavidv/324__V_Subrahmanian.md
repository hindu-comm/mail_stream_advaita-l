Dr. Dash mahodaya,

It was helpful. Thank you very much.
I got information about the following Upanishatsara texts from it.

1. Upanishadartha Sara Samgraha by Tarakabrahmanandayati, disciple of
Raghavananda. 39 stanzas, mostly in Salini metre, giving the advaitic
essence of Taittiriyopanishad and celebrating Rama as the impersonal
Brahman, after the fashion of Ramatapani. Adyar Up. p. 191

(It is not clear what is meant by 'Adyar Up. p. 191. Is it reference number
of a manuscript or printed edition?)

2. Upanishatsarasamgraha with vyakhya (vidvanmanohara) by Subrahmanya, son
of Sarvesara, of the Mindi Somayaji family and pupil of Venkata Pandita. MT
2182 (with C). 2497.

I got information about one more text from another source.

3. Bodhananda Gita A metrical epitome of the 10 Upanisads in 12 chapters by
Bodhananda, pupil of Brahmanandayati. Printed Kalpathi 1909.

Though the 3rd one, Bodhananda Gita was published in 1909, it could not be
found in any of the digital libraries on the internet.

explore their Hindi versions.

There is book "अष्टादशी" by Vinoba Bhave. It gives verse-by-verse
translation of 18 Upanishat's. There is another book by Vinoba Bhave
"उपनिषदांचा अभ्यास" i.e. Study of Upanishat's. There is yet another book
ईशावास्यवृत्ति actually a commentary on ईशावास्य because the word वृत्ति
connotes commentary, apart from its lingual meaning as "way of life -
ईशावास्य as way of life.

What I have with me are books in Marathi. But they might have been
translated into other languages.

It may turn out to be a good idea to put together शाङ्करभाष्य-s on
different Upanishat's. Actually every शाङ्करभाष्य is replete with
quotations from other Upanishat's.

Pranams to all,

Attaching Dasopanishad Rahasya and Dasopanishat Sara. I would like to know
if there are any other texts that deal with essence of Upanishads.

Dasopanishad Rahasya is extracted from the book 'Upanishat Sri' - Anthology
of Articles on Upanishads available online at https://archive.org/details/
