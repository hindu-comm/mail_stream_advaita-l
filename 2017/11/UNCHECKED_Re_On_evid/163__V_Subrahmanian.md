Very well said.  Shankara cites a Mahabharata/Vishnu purana verse:
अचिन्त्याः खलु ये भावा न तांस्तर्केण योजयेत् । प्रकृतिभ्यः परं यच्च
तदचिन्त्यस्य लक्षणम्’ BSB 2.1.27.  While this is about the jagatkāraṇam
that is beyond prakriti, even about the prakriti kāryam that is the jagat
Shankara says:  अस्य जगतो नामरूपाभ्यां व्याकृतस्य अनेककर्तृभोक्तृसंयुक्तस्य
प्रतिनियतदेशकालनिमित्तक्रियाफलाश्रयस्य मनसाप्यचिन्त्यरचनारूपस्य  BSB
1.1.1.2.

Thus, whether it is Brahman or the jagat, no brain-work would succeed in
determining the true nature.
