 Mahabharatha is certainly not a fantasy because recently an Indian researcher had found a large city under Dwaraka. The sea expedition was taken up after collecting information from the Mahabharatha. The Rameshwaram bridge is also a strong evidence for Ramayana as a historical event. Ramayana is again mentioned several times in Mahabharatha. All these are very consistent.

Time dilation was recently known, in fact was postulated first. But Dwaipayana knew about it thousands of aeons ago. That itself is enough to consider the validity of Yugas more seriously. There is no 'science' vs 'religion' jingoism in Vedic Dharma because everything is interwoven. In the Apasthambha Sutras it is said that the Vedas hesitate to grace the person with little learning. So just by learning few Vedantic works, we cannot hope to comprehend the truth of the Vedas. Vedanta is connected to Vedic cosmology which is again deeply connected to Vedic Mythology which is connected to Vedic chronology or sequence of events, etc. Even Shri Krishna mentions about Brahma loka/aho ratra in Bhagavad gita. Why would he mention if it was unrelated and of no concern for a Vedantin?
Stephen Hawking in his 'A brief history of time' has made very interesting points which insists that time is cyclical in nature and not linear. He has further said that Time does not have a starting point meaning that it is beginning-less.
