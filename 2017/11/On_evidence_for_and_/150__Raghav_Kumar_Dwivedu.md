Namaste Rajesh ji and Sujal ji
Thank you for your inputs
Rajesh ji,
Its not a question of their system versus our system, rather its about
having the patience to read through the arguments against the yugas etc.,
as historical realities and strengthening our dharma. If you notice
bhAShyakara does advance arguments against the Buddhists on logical grounds
alone without merely saying 'our shruti invalidates Buddhist ideas'. Just
saying that shruti is supreme is ineffectual.  Different pramANas like
shruti (and it's allies) and anumAna may appear to clash,  in which case we
have to put in sone efforts to either show the fallacies in the anumAna or
we reinterpret shruti without losing its key points.

Moreover when the dominant consensus  amongst large sections of thinkers
and scientists is presenting a pUrvapakSha against the itihAsas, atleast a
few of the Astikas can try and show the problems with these pUrvapakShas.

Another related issue , (on a diffetent note)
Take the idea of the time period of the yugas. I have not read but been
told that Sri Yukteswar Giri held the kali yuga to be 600 years and the
other yugas being multiples thereof in the usual way. Now this scheme was
endorsed by Sri Swami Dayananda Saraswati ji, a  traditional teacher of
Vedanta who said on more than one occasion that the current Yuga is Dwapara
yuga. ( He offered two reasons if I recollect, viz.,  the developments in
science and another reason being (this is my recollection) that atleast a
small significant section of people are able to worship as per Hindu
traditions and peacefully study vedanta etc., without religious persecution
unlike in the medieval ages. So things are better now than during say
Aurangzeb's time ) The above view represents a debate or discussion within
the tradition regarding the itihasa chronology. I wanted to ask if the
above book of Sri Yukteswar Giri has been read by anyone here.

Om
Raghav
