For many traditionalists the chronology of Yugas having the order of
hundreds of thousands of years where there were human beings living on this
planet earth, is taken for granted.

But there is a counter argument that the fossil records don't support such
as possibility.  I wanted to know the fallacies in this such a fossil
record based argument against the possibility of Yugas. This is no doubt a
bit off topic with respect to Advaita Vedanta per se but i am hoping some
learned members would know about ideas to defend the concept of Yugas given
the so-called evidence from fossil records which is claimed to invalidate
even the possibility of Yugas.

thank you
