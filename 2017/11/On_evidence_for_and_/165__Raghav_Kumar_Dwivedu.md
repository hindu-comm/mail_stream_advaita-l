Namaste

Yes there is no problem with atIndriya viShsyas like svarga, karma phala
etc., since such statements are *non-falsifiable* . Most of the discussions
related to shruti fall in this category.

The challenge is, with topics dealt with in some of the pauruSheya texts
which are well-regarded in the tradition, where the viShaya described is
*within the purview of the senses* and yet of some importance for Astikas.
In such cases, such as historiography, there is scope for objections coming
from current science.

I may choose to ignore and not address such scientific objections due to my
other priorities. But such objections from science are not something that
can be dismissed merely as a matter of principle by invoking
anadhigatatvaM, (when it comes to itihAsa purAnas.)Because they are indriya
viShayas.



Again you rightly observed, science remains perpetually a work in progress.
But that is true even of traditional historiography.
I gave the example of (a minority view) of a respected acharya mentioning
600 years and you mentioned 5000 years by some dharmic institution  to say
that such issues may also be works in progress. I was told that such other
calculations are not totally arbitrary and follow a different way of
calculation . I am looking for the exact details .

As for tAtparya nishcaya, that is about the mahAvAkya etc. It remains fixed
as the samanvaya has already been done. (dvaitins may disagree but let us
ignore that aspect for now)

But when it comes to other topics there is definitely scope for contention,
refinement even within the tradition. Take the example of year of birth of
bhAShyakAra. Even the two southern maths do not agree on the year.
The very fact they are contending (rather than ignoring it as a mere
vyAvahArika issue like in a dream) shows that it has some importance. I
certainly found it helpful to see both the views of the maThs and we can
reach a clearer conclusion and see where the later distortions are coming
in. So even within the tradition there is going to be debate over such
matters.


Thank you for all the inputs esp. the quote.

Even about the prakriti kāryam that is the jagat
Shankara says:  अस्य जगतो नामरूपाभ्यां व्याकृतस्य अनेककर्तृभोक्तृसंयुक्तस्य
प्रतिनियतदेशकालनिमित्तक्रियाफलाश्रयस्य मनसाप्यचिन्त्यरचनारूपस्य  BSB
1.1.1.2.
