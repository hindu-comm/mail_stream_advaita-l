No, I'm saying that there is a significanteffect of knowing the meaning of the Vedic Mantras that goes above and beyond merely chanting them.

I've recited the Purusha Suktam many times (even earlier today), and certainly gained from the knowledge of the meaning of (at least some of)the Mantras.

In a nutshell: knowing the meaning of (a few of) the Veda Mantras may not be essential, but is surely beneficial! Yes, even to the Average Devadatta!
