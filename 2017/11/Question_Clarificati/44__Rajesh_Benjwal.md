Namaste
​
Sarmaji,


About atirudram in California. It is good they did it but there cannot be
any अदृष्टफलम् for it. You may have some दृष्टफलम् mainly in the form of
fatigue and back and joint pain OR some kind of satisfaction. I doubt
that Sringeri
and Kanchi Acharyas allowed it but if they did they may have thought
something subtle. But any श्रौत कर्म done outside the आर्यव्रत does not
yield अदृष्टफलम्.


Thanks
