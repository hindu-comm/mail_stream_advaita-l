As I mentioned, hand movements are deprecated in South India and that would
go for KYV shAkhA. An exception: Among the paNDita-s, some but not all,
ghanapAThi-s use some hand movements to connect up the pada text and going
back and forth between the different padas. They seem to find this useful.
However some other ghanapAThi-s do no not use any hand movement here
either. They just rattle off the entire thing, which is pretty amazing to
hear and watch. I must confess here that I use counting techniques or other
mnemonic schemes to memorize certain anuvAka-s, where I do count off my
fingers, or do something else. But I try to make it as inconspicuous as I
can.
