It's the udAtta which fixes the meaning. The meaning is determined from the fact there is (usually) anudAtta-udAtta-svarita. The differences in svarita pronunciation is irrelevant and just needs a common convention, which might vary per veda, or even tradition. For example, the Nambudiri yajurvedins have a distinct tremolo like effect on their svarita-s, and tremolo like effects are taboo in Tamil yajruvedic traditions. There are different traditions how the svarita changes from high to low, high to higher,, if their a continuous drop from high to low, or precipitous, etc. It does not matter since once you agree on a convention the samhitA pATha will split into the same exact words.

Thanks for your immediate clarification. Yajurveda udAtta becomes svarita in Rigveda mantra.  In kanchi pAtha, udAtta for the hrasvAkshara will be chanted like deerghAkshara and here in Mysore paatha we chant Rigveda hrasvAkshara which has udAtta at the end of the mantra vAkya with visarga in a deerghAkshara style.  For example in Rigveda gaNesha sUkta adaashushtarasya vedaH..vaksya daH has the udaatta hence we chant it like vedAH...likewise in saMhita vAya ukthebhirjarante tvAmachhaa jaritAraH, raH will be chanted tArAH since 'raH' has the udAtta svara.
