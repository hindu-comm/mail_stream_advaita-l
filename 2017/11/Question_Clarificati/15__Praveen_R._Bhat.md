To clarify, ​I know what you're saying. ​I was restating what Ramaji is
saying and this was addressed to those who misunderstood his statement.

Same here, but gaining the knowledge is a dRShTaphala while the contention
here is about adRShTaphala. I doubt that anyone will question the gain
(dRShThaphala) in knowing the meaning (padArtha and vAkyArtha)! This
dRShTaphala is gained even without chanting properly or without svara. Just
reading it and making an anvaya and/ or studying Sayanabhashya will get us
that. However, it will not get us adRShTa, what will is chanting properly
with svara.

In a nutshell: knowing the meaning of (a few of) the Veda Mantras may not

​Sure, and that benefit is dRShTaphala. I wonder if Ramaji differs though.
