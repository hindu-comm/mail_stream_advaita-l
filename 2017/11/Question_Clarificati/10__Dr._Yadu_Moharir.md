Namaste:
Based on the recent discussions am I understanding correctly that meaning of mantra is not relevant ?
If this were so, then can some one help me understand the following ?

mananaata traayate iti mantraH tajjapastadarthabhAvanam.h ..paa. yo. 28..
matraartha mantra caitanya yo na jaanaat |
shatalaxaprajapto.api tasya mantro na sidhyati ||

Thx
Dr Yadu

>From the name Veda itself we come to know Veda is about Knowledge and not
just blind Karma. The Veda does not ask us to do Karmas blindly not knowing
meaning. In Vivaha Mantras the bridegroom has to promise the bride saying
Dharme Ca Arthe Ca Kaame Ca Naticarami. He will not deceive her in Dharma,
Artha and Kaama and will always share with her. He will remain faithful to
her. But the Purohita if he does not know the meaning he will simply go
through it and not tell bridegroom he has made a promise. What then? In
Upanayana the Vatu may ask why he has to offer the Samits into Agni for
Agnikaarya. What is the meaning of the Mantras in offering the Samit sticks
into Agni? Who will answer him if Purohita does not know meaning? Can we
expect the boy to be satisfied by telling him he should not ask any
question but simply do it?
