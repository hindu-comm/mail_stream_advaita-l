Dear Bhaskar,

I quite do not understand your questions at all, sorry. Are you saying
below that ALL yajur-veda udAtta-s become svarita-s in yajur-veda? I
am pretty sure this is not the case. The bhAgya sUktam for example
translates pretty much one-to-one regarding udAtta-s.

Or are you thinking about a specific mantra? It's quite possible some
specific words are treated differently in the yajur and Rg. For
example, For example, the samAsa anAturam is treated differently in Rg
and yajur with regard to svara-s, but this is reflected in the
different meanings as preserved in the pada-pATha.

If you are thinking of a particular example, please specify the entire
mantra and where it occurs in Rg and yajur along with svara-s if you
cannot provide the text references. Wikners transliteration would be
good.

Furthermore, there is no connection between hrasva and dIrgha and
svara-s udAtta, etc. The udAtta can be on a hrasva or dIrgha vowel. So
can any of the other svara-s.

I am also not sure what you mean by Kanchi pATha. Do you mean the
Tamil method? Tamil Nadu > Kanchi :-).

BTW, in the mantra adaa!"suu.s.tarasya_ veda!.h, the udAtta syllables
are "a" in the first word and "ve" in the second word. It's not da,
whch is svarita.

Rama

The differences in svarita pronunciation is irrelevant and just needs a common convention, which might vary per veda, or even tradition. For example, the Nambudiri yajurvedins have a distinct tremolo like effect on their svarita-s, and tremolo like effects are taboo in Tamil yajruvedic traditions. There are different traditions how the svarita changes from high to low, high to higher,, if their a continuous drop from high to low, or precipitous, etc. It does not matter since once you agree on a convention the samhitA pATha will split into the same exact words.

> Thanks for your immediate clarification. Yajurveda udAtta becomes svarita in Rigveda mantra.  In kanchi pAtha, udAtta for the hrasvAkshara will be chanted like deerghAkshara and here in Mysore paatha we chant Rigveda hrasvAkshara which has udAtta at the end of the mantra vAkya with visarga in a deerghAkshara style.  For example in Rigveda gaNesha sUkta adaashushtarasya vedaH..vaksya daH has the udaatta hence we chant it like vedAH...likewise in saMhita vAya ukthebhirjarante tvAmachhaa jaritAraH, raH will be chanted tArAH since 'raH' has the udAtta svara.
