I never disputed that "'adṛṣtam' is well accepted". As a matter of fact, I
mentioned that adR^iShTa, even in the mImAmsA, is a superset of
apUrva-phala. apUrva is something extremely specific. The context in which
adR^iShTa was mentioned seemed to refer to apUrva. The difference in
opinion was about what the "knowledge" of ritual/mantra-s results in. Is it
in actual tangible things (wealth/health/etc.) as well or ONLY in the so
called mental concentration, which is aided by knowing the meaning (pointed
out by Kartik as well as Praveen). My understanding, as I mentioned in my
previous email, is that it's the former. Knowledge of ritual and mantras is
far more powerful than just aiding mental concentration. In spite of that,
it's a fairly useless activity for *most* people. I hope I am clear now.
