The meanings can be changed even by non-svara mistakes such as dadAti vs.
dadhAti etc. Yes, there could be many examples, but the question is whether
there is a problem if the meaning does not change. This is in the case when
the svara is not said, but could match up to classical Sanskrit and make
the same sense. However, since the veda-s are aparuSheya, it's not a
sensible question to ask whether the vedic passage would make the same
sense when the svara was not recited, given that classical Sanskrit does
not have svara-s. The lack of svara-s/wrong svara-s makes it NOT the veda
and cannot give the requisite result, since the svaras are aparuSheya as
well. In some cases, it could convey the opposite meaning, but even if does
not, it cannot bear the same fruit.

Any chanting not associated with particular results would come under the
directive svAdhyAyo adhyetavyaH, which is a nitya karma. As I explained
previously, as per advaita there is no apUrva.

In rituals/karma-s there are a number of prAyashcitta karma-s meant for
expiation. As far as svAdhyAya goes, there isn't any, but the right effort
has to be made. Most people barely make any effort to learn the right
svara-s. If the right effort is made and it's not for a specific purpose,
samarpaNam to nArAyaNa should be good enough. But the key is to actually
make the proper effort. That's my understanding.

I am not aware of yati-dharma-s. It's not prohibited for them from chanting
veda-s, though it's not an obligatory ritual for them.
