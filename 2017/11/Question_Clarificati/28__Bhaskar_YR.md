praNAms Sri Rama prabhuji
Hare Krishna

I quite do not understand your questions at all, sorry. Are you saying below that ALL yajur-veda udAtta-s become svarita-s in yajur-veda? I am pretty sure this is not the case. 

>  No prabhuji, I am not saying all udAtta-s in YV become svarita in RV..But most of the popular upayukta mantra-s in YV and RV have different svara-s with same wordings.  


The bhAgya sUktam for example translates pretty much one-to-one regarding udAtta-s.

>  I am familiar with only YV bhAgya sUkta ( which we call pratH sUkta as well ) since my sva-shAkha is KYV.  But if we see some other popular mantra including gAyatri , trayambaka, apyaayasvametute ( which we use for the Chandra graha AvAhana)  mantra same words have different svara-s.  

Or are you thinking about a specific mantra? It's quite possible some specific words are treated differently in the yajur and Rg. For example, For example, the samAsa anAturam is treated differently in Rg and yajur with regard to svara-s, but this is reflected in the different meanings as preserved in the pada-pATha.

>  Does the meaning of the gayatri mantra also have the different meaning when we see the pada-pAtha for the above mantra-s??  for example we say bhargO with udAtta whereas bhagO will be chanted with svarita in RV gayatri mantra.  Likewise durga sUkta (jAtavedase too same mantra-s have different svara-s) do these mantra-s also have different meaning in pada pAtha??  Sorry, I have not read veda bhAshya and not familiar with pada pAtha of saMhita.  

If you are thinking of a particular example, please specify the entire mantra and where it occurs in Rg and yajur along with svara-s if you cannot provide the text references. Wikners transliteration would be good.

>  I have provided some of the mantra-s above...Infact there are somany like this in vivAha, upanayana viniyOga mantra-s and RV and YV mahAnyAsAdi mantra-s and udakashanti mantra-s.  

Furthermore, there is no connection between hrasva and dIrgha and svara-s udAtta, etc. The udAtta can be on a hrasva or dIrgha vowel. So can any of the other svara-s.

>  what I was trying to say is when the hrasva akshara has the udAtta with visarga at the end of the vAkya, then it will be chanted as if it is deerghAkshara in RV.  Sri Ananda Hudbli prabhuji may explain this in a better way I think.  

I am also not sure what you mean by Kanchi pATha. Do you mean the Tamil method? Tamil Nadu > Kanchi :-).

>  Yes, kanchi pAtha means Tamil method.  Rigveda mantra-s chanting method will be entirely different from what we used to here.  We call our style as Mysore pAtha (like Andhra pAtha, dravida pAtha in KYV) in kanchi pAtha all udAtta-s in the RV samHita mantra-s will be chanted differently and we will immediately come to know 'this is Kanchi pAtha' if some person started chanting mantra-s in this style :-) 

BTW, in the mantra adaa!"suu.s.tarasya_ veda!.h, the udAtta syllables are "a" in the first word and "ve" in the second word. It's not da, whch is svarita.

>  gaNapati sUkta in RV has the vAkya like this :  a'dA'shUshtarasya ve'daH'...Here first da is deerghAkshara which has the svarita svara and last 'da' in the word vedaH has the hrasvaakshara (da not dA) with visarga and udAtta svara.  But while chanting this vedaH, since last 'da' has the udAtta svara we chant daH as dAH as if it sounds like deerghAkshara !!   whereas this style of chanting we would not follow in YV.  

>  Kindly pardon me if I am not clearly expressing my doubts here. 

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
