The actual question about bodily movements. So according to pretty much all
shikShas, there has to be a show of hands to indicate udAtta, svarita, etc.
But this is deprecated in the Southern traditions. The Northeren shukla
yajurvedins use a show of hands, but the southern shukla yajurvedins do
not. shiraH kampanam is strictly prohibited. However the nambudiris, only
when learning, indicate udAtta by upper tilt of the head, anudAtta by
downwards and svarita by sideways tilting of the head.

See for an example
