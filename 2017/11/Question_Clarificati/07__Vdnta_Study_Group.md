hariH om

Thanks, Venkatesh ji for the overall picture, and Balasubramanian ji for
the specifics

Balasubramanian ji, interesting to learn that the nod of head is prohibited
across the board, but the northern shukla yajurvedis use hand movement to
indicate the svaras.
Do you have any idea of krishna yajurveda veda (KYV) shaakhaas? Though I am
a Gujarati, through my association with teachers of Vedanta (Pujya Swami
Dayananda ji and others), I have mostly studied the mantras in the KYV
tradition.

Namaste,
Prashant
