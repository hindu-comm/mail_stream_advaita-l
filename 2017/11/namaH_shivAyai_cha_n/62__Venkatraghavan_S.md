Thanks for that Venkatesh ji.

Not related to the ardhanArIshvara stotra-

Sri Chandrashekharendra Sarasvati Swamigal mentions that after the
recitation of the Raghuvamsha verse, its last quarter (vande
pArvatiparameshvarau) is traditionally repeated as vande pArvatipa
rameshvarau, ie with a gap between pArvatIpa and rameshvarau. This is to
indicate obeisance to Shiva (pArvatyA: pAlaka:) and ViShNu (ramAyA:
Ishvara:), the two fathers of the universe.

Apologies if this has been mentioned in the list previously, but your
opening words reminded me of Periyava's message from Deivatthin Kural.

Regards,
Venkatraghavan

Namaste

*Vagarthaviva sampriktau vagarthah pratipattaye | *
*Jagatah pitarau vande parvathiparameshwarau || â€“ Kalidasa's Raghuvamsha
1.1 *
I pray parents of the world, Lord Shiva and Mother Parvathi, who are
inseparable as speech and its meaning to gain knowledge of speech and its
meaning.

The two Shiva and Parvati are so inseparable they have joined with each
other to form Ardhanareeshwara. Adi Sankara has written a beautiful Stotra
on Ardhanareeshwara. Once again he has used very beautiful combination of
words to describe the two parts of Ardhanareeshwara - one Shivaa and one
Shiva. One line he is describing Shivaa and next he is describing Shiva.
Alternating lines like this are used. In Sloka 4 he is saying Samekshanayai
vishamekshanaya. Parvati has even number of eyes but Shiva has odd number
of eyes. In 6th Sloka he is saying Nireeswarayai Nikhileswaraya. Parvati is
without a Lord because She is same as Shiva. She is Nireeshwaraa. Shiva is
the Lord of All. He is Nikhileshwara. In Sloka 7 Jagajjananyai
Jagadekapitre. She is the Mother of the World and He is the one and only
Father.
