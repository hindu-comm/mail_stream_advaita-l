praNAms Sri Ravi Kiran prabhuji
Hare Krishna

>> Both prama-s  would continue to operate in their respective domains without >> coming in the way of one another.

The domain where the prArabdha is operating, one would necessarily apply the vivEka, vairAgya, shamAdi ShaTka sampatti that one has practiced earlier..is it not the case ?


Ø   As per the traditional understanding the domain of prArabdha is just like arrow which is already left the bow…it cannot be controlled by whatsoever means, for that matter even samyak jnana too cannot have the capacity to annul the force of this prArabdha karma phala.  Examples of kashyapa brahma, ramaNa, rAmakrishna etc. and their sufferings and activities given with regard to this.  It is in this prArabdha / avidyAlesha ambit  there is a provision to accept jnAni’s kAma – krOdha as well.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
