Reg  << karma phala (prArabdha) and more importantly that karma has the
capacity to even negate the jnana phala even in samyak jnAni-s, >>,



Not exactly. Jnana phala includes  nonaccrual of any phalas for subsequent
karmas performed by the Jnani. Jnanaphala also  includes nonaccrual of any
fresh bodies, after the fall of the current body, irrespective of any
karmas performed by the jnani subsequent to attainment of Jnana.
