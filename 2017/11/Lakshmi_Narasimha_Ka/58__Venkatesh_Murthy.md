Namaste

Listen to melodious song -

In the Sankara Dig Vijaya there is a story how Adi Sankara was rescued from
a Kapalika wanting to perform a human sacrifice. He wanted to offer a
Sanyasi as human sacrifice to get maximum benefit. Adi Sankara was willing
to be sacrificed because the body is destructible and will die
some day. What is the use of preserving the body? In the Sankaracharya
movie it is seen a lion comes and kills the Kapalika before the sacrifice.
But in reality Narasimha came and killed the Kapalika. At that time Adi
Sankara offered prayers to Sri Lakshmi Narasimha.

This is the best Stotra to conquer fear.
