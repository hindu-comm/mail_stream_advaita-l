Reg  << Why does Shankara say that names and forms are sarvajnasya
Ishvarasya
AtmabhUta (ie they are part of him), and later say sarvajna: Ishvara:
tAbhyAm anya: (ie he is different from them)?
 >>,

The important word
इव
 (
 iva
)
appears to be
 misssing from
t
he translation.
I think t
his leads to the question mark.
