From different points of view, they are either of these.  Sureshwara, in
the Vartika for this section says: The Antaryāmi, is the Superior, Directly
available, Bodiless, A-guṇa (nirguṇa), without a second. (33). By itself,
the antaryāmi, is without any organs, bodiless, nirguna, with no difference
whatever. Owing to the delusion that one has organs, body, etc. the
antaryāmi appears to be one endowed with body, etc.(37). Therefore He is to
be known as distinct from the pṛthvīdevatā (whom he controls).

Shankara raises a question:  One would think that 'those who are impelled
are different and the impeller, antaryāmin, is different. With a view to
dispel the idea that the antaryāmin is different, it is stated by this
mantra......Other than the Antaryāmin, there is no seer, hearer, etc.
Shankara has cited this mantra ‘नान्योऽतोऽस्ति द्रष्टा’ (बृ. उ. ३ । ७ । २३)
(whose bhashyam is cited above) innumerable times in the prasthāna traya to
affirm the identity between the Supreme and the individual self. Since he
has commented here: apart from the antaryāmin, there is no other seer,
etc., the Supreme is antaryāmin according to his commentary.

In the Naiṣkarmyadiddhi, 2.42 Sureśvaracharya paraphrases the above BU
mantra 3.7.23. the concluding mantra of the antaryāmi brahmanam, and holds
it to be
denoting Nirguna Brahman:

उक्तयुक्तिं दृढीकर्तुमागमोदाहरणोपन्यासः .
आर्तमन्यद्दृशेः सर्वं "नेति नेती"ति चासकृत् .
वदन्ती निर्गुणं ब्रह्म कथं श्रुतिरुपेक्ष्यते .. ४२..
"महाभूतान्यहंकार"इत्येतत्क्षेत्रमुच्यते .
न दृशेर्द्वैतयोगोऽस्ति विश्वेश्वरमतादपि .. ४३..

The commentator Jnānottama cites the ‘नान्योऽतोऽस्ति द्रष्टा’ (बृ. उ. ३ । ७
। २३) of the antaryāmi brahmana in full as the shruti Sureshwara is
paraphrasing.

Exactly; I have already addressed this: In the Mandukya, the antaryāmin is
stated along with the third quarter, anātmā, and hence the identity is only
with the fourth which is specifically stated as the ātmā: sa ātmā, sa
vijneyaḥ [the turiya is the Atma; he is to be realized]. On the other hand,
the Br.Up. explicitly teaches 'you are the antaryāmi, eternal.',
innumerable times in that section. That  is the difference. Nowhere the
sopādhika Brahman is taught to be realized as oneself. It is upāsya
brahman. Whereas the nirupādhika alone is taught as jneya brahman, as in
the fourth quarter of the mandukya. That is the samanvaya.

Such an interpretation is not admissible. There is no gradation in
'nirupādhika'. It is either sopādhika or nirupādhika. Even if, for
argument's sake, a few upādhi-s remain, it is only sopādhika and not
nirupādhika. Shankara makes a clear distinction between: with-upādhi =
samsārin, without-upādhi = mukta. Anandagiri says exactly this: सोपाधिकस्य
आत्मनः संसारित्वमुक्त्वा निरुपाधिकस्य नित्यमुक्तत्वमाह - निरुपाधिक इति ।
Sri SSS also has said: (in Kannada): ātmanu svataḥ nirupādhikanāgi
iruvāga....[When the Atman, by itself, is nirupādhika..then it is taught to
be nirupākhya, ....antaryāmin....]
