Namaste Shankarji,

The emails do not require anything of you. First was your introduction
shared by the moderator as written by you in your subscription to the list.
This mail is just one of the mails on the discussion list. If you prefer
not to receive each and every mail, maybe you should change your
subscription to digest.

In any case, you can read and/ or participate by sending replies if you
wish to or by asking questions in a new thread based on your interest in
Advaita Vedanta. That is how almost all discussion-lists work.

Kind rgds,
--Praveen R. Bhat
