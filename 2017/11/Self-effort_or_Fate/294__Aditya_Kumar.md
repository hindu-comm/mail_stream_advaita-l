Perhaps the oldest philosophical question. If everything is predetermined by fate, why put any effort? However, if self-effort can change our fate, why do we often hit a dead-end in our pursuits? Lastly, is Moksha gained by self-effort or fate?
I know there is a correct answer somewhere but not sure about it. Any thoughts?
