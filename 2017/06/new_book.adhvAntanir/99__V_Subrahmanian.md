New Book 'Dhvāntanirāsaḥ' - Sanskrit

A new book in Sanskrit with the above title is about the replies to the
objections on the early advaitic works by Sri Jayatirtha in his
Nyāyasudhā.  This short work was originally commenced by late MM Sri Goda
Subrahmanya Sastri and continued up to the samanvayādhikaraṇam by eminent
scholar late Sri Narayana Bhatta. The book carries a foreword by Vidwan Sri
Mani Dravid Sastri.  In the foreword it is said that even though many
objections were answered by earlier Advaitic works, this work is unique in
that it cites exact lines from the Nyayasudha for refutation.

The book was published in 2016 by Vidwan Sri Hithlalli Suryanarayana
 Nagendra Bhatta.  The price mentioned is Rs.100.
