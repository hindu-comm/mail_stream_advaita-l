Also, I remember having read about a bhAgavata sampradAya maTha affiliated
to Shankara BhagavatpAda's philosophy, probably the Balekudru Matha, where
the Yati wears a Gopi chandana in the morning and bhasma in the evening. It
is claimed that this is the only advaita pITha maTha in Dakshina Kannada
and Udupi districts combined.

I was able to find the webpage of the maTha for those who are interested:
