Thank you Anand ji, for the references. Actually there are some smarta
families in Tamil nadu and Kerala who adhere to the morning-gopi chandana
and evening-bhasma tripundra practice. I have myself seen such elders.
Youngsters of those very families of the modern times do not meticulously
practice that dual-pundra dharana; they stick to only one, mostly guided by
convenience, peer influence, etc. Nevertheless all such practices are
happily accepted by śiṣṭa-s without causing any ill feeling to anyone by
any other member.  Just one sample is:
