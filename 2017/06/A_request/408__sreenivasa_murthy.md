Dear members,
 I have a request to make to all of you. 
 Is it possible to teach/present the unique teachings of Advaitavedanta or Non-duality as presented in upanishads and in tune with the commentaries of Sri Shankara in a contemporaryform that can be easily understood and experienced by people leading normallives in the modern world? 
This will be a great service to earnest seekers of Ultimate Truth.Thanking you all,

With warm and respectful namaskars,Sreenivasa Murthy
