Namaste Sreenivasa Murthy,

In my latest book "Musings on Hinduism" on which Aravinda Rao Karanam ji
had kindly written a foreward, I had tried to do exactly that. It has two
sections, one on general Hindu philosophy and one on Vedanta, both from
standpoint of Advaita.

You can purchase the book from here-

Regards,
Nithin
