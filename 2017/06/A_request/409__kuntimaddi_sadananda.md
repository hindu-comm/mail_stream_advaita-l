SreenivaasaMurthy - PraNAms
Coming from Science Background that is what I have been doing for the past few years, and thanks to Advaita Academy, all my talks are available on yu-tube under Acharya Sadaji. The audio talks are available at wwws.Chinmayadc.org under Acharya Sadananda. Shree Aravinda Rao Karanam, who is also a moderator of Advaitin list has several talks on Geeta and Upanishads, where he follows closely Shankara Bhasyas.

 Subject: [Advaita-l] A request

Dear members,
 I have a request to make to all of you. 
 Is it possible to teach/present the unique teachings of Advaitavedanta or Non-duality as presented in upanishads and in tune with the commentaries of Sri Shankara in a contemporaryform that can be easily understood and experienced by people leading normallives in the modern world? 
This will be a great service to earnest seekers of Ultimate Truth.Thanking you all,

With warm and respectful namaskars,Sreenivasa Murthy
