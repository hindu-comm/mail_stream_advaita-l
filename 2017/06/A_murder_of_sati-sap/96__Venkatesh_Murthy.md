Namaste

Yes Dvaitis believe Antaryami of Siva is Vishnu. It is correct because
Sivasya Hrudayam Vishnuh. But they cannot say Vishnosca Hrudayam Sivah.

Sri Vaadiraaja has written one pilgrimage book 'Teertha Prabandha'. In that
book he has said Siva's Antaryaami is Parashuraama known in Udupi as
Ananteshwara.

शिवांतर्यामितां स्वीयां प्रियान् प्रति निबोधयन् ।
दयावारिनिधिः शैवीं शिलामाश्रित्य शोभते ॥ 14


In Dharma Sthala also he worshipped the Linga after keeping Hayagreeva
Salagrama in it. Kindly see Page 8 -

Again Sivasya Hrudayam Vishnuh. It is correct to worship Salagrama inside
Linga. But we Advaitis must also accept Vishnosca Hrudayam Sivah.
