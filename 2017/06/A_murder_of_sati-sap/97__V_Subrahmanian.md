Sridharaswamin the Advaitin, in his invocation to the commentary to the
Bhāgavatam says:

माधवोमाधवावीशौ सर्वसिद्धिविधायिनौ। वन्दे परस्परात्मानौ परस्परनुतिप्रियौ॥

I bow to Mādhava and Umādhava (Shiva) who are both 'Isha-s' Supreme Lords.
They are both the selves of each other and both love to engage in the stuti
of each other.

This is what we see in the Mahabharata, Harivamsha and many other
scriptures.
