PranamS Sri Sriram ji,

I just found shankar Matha in mating east. The chief pundit is a Tamil
brahmin. I could not recollect his name due to language problem. They are
not fluent in hindi. Matunga east is nearby bandra station. Matha is also
near matunga station. 10-15 minutes train route and 2-5 mins walking from
matunga east railway station.

On 6th June 2017 at 4.00 PM they are having a pradosha

Contact no is 022-24014397

The Matha is opposite to Bhuvaneshwar Mahadev Shiv Mandir. Mandir title
backlit board is written in Gujarati, but temple is famous. I will email
you pictures in private email if your brother is interested to go.

Hope this helps.
