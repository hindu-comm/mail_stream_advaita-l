Sriram ji,

There is one more reference:  Dr.K.Ramasubramaniam, son of MM Sri
R.Krishnamurthy Sastrigal of Chennai, works in IIT Powai. He is a Yajurveda
scholar. You can ask your brother to get in touch with him at IIT and work
out the timings, etc. Of course, the Prof. goes to many institutions in
India and abroad for presentations often. So time might be a constraint.
But he has been conducting Vedanta classes for many years in the campus.

regards
