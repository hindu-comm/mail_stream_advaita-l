Dear Sri Venkatesh ji,

It would be a good idea to send a synopsis, in Sanskrit, of this
discussion, along with the URLs / excerpts to the TTD magazine's readers'
reaction section. This may at least create awareness at the article-author,
magazine editor and other readers level about the matter and thereby spread
the information.
