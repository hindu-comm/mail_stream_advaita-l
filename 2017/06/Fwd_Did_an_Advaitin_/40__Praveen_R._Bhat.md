Namaste Vidyasankarji, Venkateshji,

Since Yadavaprakasha was bhedabhedavAdin and more likely with a mix within
leading to vishiShTAdvaita itself, their own story of his jealousy with
Ramanujacharya's fame makes sense. Yadavaprakasha's not being Advaitin is
enough to show the confusion that prevails in their understanding of
Advaita Vedanta, "murder plot" aside.

One would think that as to what happened later, they know best. However,
funnily enough, their confusion furthers to their own sampradAya's main
Guru's guru who became his shishya later, who was a Bhedabhedavadin or
something like that, but they want to continue mudslinging and call him an
Advaitin!

Kind rgds,
--Praveen R. Bhat
