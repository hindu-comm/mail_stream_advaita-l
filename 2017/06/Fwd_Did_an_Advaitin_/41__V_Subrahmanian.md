//According to Kuppuswami Sastri, it is not likely that Maṇḍana Miśra, the
author of *Brahmasiddhi*, is identical with Sureśvara, but the tradition is
correct in describing Maṇḍana Miśra and Śankara as contemporaries.[3]
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ma%E1%B9%87%E1%B8%8Dana_Mi%C5%9Bra#cite_note-FOOTNOTEKuppuswami_Sastri1984-3>
His
critical edition of the *Brahmasiddhi* also points out that the name
Maṇḍana Miśra is both a title and a first name, which is a possible cause
for a confusion of personalities.[3]
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ma%E1%B9%87%E1%B8%8Dana_Mi%C5%9Bra#cite_note-FOOTNOTEKuppuswami_Sastri1984-3>
Maṇḍana
Miśra's brand of Advaita differs in certain critical details from that of
Śhankara, whereas Sureśvara's thought is very faithful to that of Śhankara.

//

In any case, Shankara refutes the bhedābheda doctrine in the BSB 2.1.14. It
is interesting to note that this doctrine is associated with the following
names:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhedabheda

//Other major names are Bhāskara
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bh%C4%81skara_(philosopher)> (8th and 9th
centuries),[1]
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhedabheda#cite_note-IEPbheda-1> Rāmānuja’s
teacher Yādavaprakāśa,[1]
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhedabheda#cite_note-IEPbheda-1> and
Vijñānabhikṣu <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vijnanabhiksu> (16th century).
[1] <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhedabheda#cite_note-IEPbheda-1>//

It is necessary that concerted efforts should be made to give wide
publicity to the prevailing
erroneous idea and the malicious propaganda by  the Ramanuja school
linking Yadava
Prakasha to Advaita.
