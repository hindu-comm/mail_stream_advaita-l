One unfortunate side-effect of the way such stories have been preserved and
transmitted is that their political motivations make it very difficult to
make objective judgments about the historical facts.

Numerous secondary citations available from various viSishTAdvaita and
dvaita authors, that show yAdavaprakASa to have been a proponent of a kind
of bhedAbheda that aligned with brahma-pariNAma vAda, viewing cit, acit and
ISvara as attributes of or as powers of brahman. This is not an advaita
view at all, but rather, it can been seen as a precursor to Ramanuja's own
more view of cit and acit as attributes of Narayana in an inseparable
fashion (apRthak-siddhi).

Nevertheless, it seems to be more convenient for most people to repeat the
story that yAdavaprakASa was an advaitin!
