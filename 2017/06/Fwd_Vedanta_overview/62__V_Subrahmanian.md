Jagadguru Sri Abhinava Vidyatirtha Mahaswaminah expounds in Tamil in this
short audio clip:


What qualifies for a S'aastra? Is pain-producing bondage real or is it mere
imagination? Is this body the Atma or is it different from It? Are the
Jeevaatma (I) and the Paramaatma (Chaitanyam) one and the same or are they
ever different? An unmatched adept at presenting even complex subject
matter in an exceptionally  lucid style,  Acharyal addresses all these
questions in the following audio clip, in a manner that induces even a
layman to delve deep into the wisdom of Vedanta.
