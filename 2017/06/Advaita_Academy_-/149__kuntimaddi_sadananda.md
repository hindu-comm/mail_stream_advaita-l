PraNAms to all
I am not sure how many are familiar with Advaita Academy. When I opened my Facebook, I found under the memory, my post of 4 years ago, anannouncementby Advaita Academy of many talks on Vedanta and Sanskrit courses. The Advaita Academy continues to provide this noble service of on-line teachings my many scholars if I remember close to 25-30 speakers. Several Topics are being covered. Shree Mani Sastrigal has given talks on Vedanta Paribhasha for those who are interested.
Sincere Thanks to Advaita Academy and their team - And to Shree Kiran Vadlamani who is the visionary behind this. You can find talks by many eminent scholars some even from the lists – Talks by Shree Mani Dravid Shrastigal, Shree Subbuji, Vidyasankar Sundaresan, Prof. VK, etc., can be found here on various topics Shree Vadlamani is also now sponsoring ‘India Facts’ and ‘Swarajya’ - online news about Indian culture and tradition, with much critical analysis by many scholars; one can subscribe to them. These ventures require a lot of effort and teamwork. Many Indians are in high positions and financially well of, but very few come forward to support these types of noble ventures. Cannot but thank all those behind efforts. Hari Om. Sadananda
