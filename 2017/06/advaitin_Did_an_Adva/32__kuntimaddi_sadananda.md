Subbuji - PraNAms
As the story goes, Ramanuja and his cousin (forgot his name) were students of Yadava Prakasha - there was little debate in terms of the epistamological meaning of what Pundareekaaksha word means. Yadava Prakasha gave meaning that sounded like demeaning and Ramanuja could not stand and he corrected his teacher. As the story goes from then on Yadava prakasha was despising Ramanaja. Yadava prakasha was taking his disciples to Kashi and Ramanuja and his cousin also joined the group. Apparently Yadava prakasha planned to get rid of Ramanuja some where near Vindyas as they were travelling (by foot). Ramanuja's cousin suspected that there was a plot to kill and he managed to save Rmanuja by taking him in a different route and bringing him back to the home town since the cousin did not believe that Yadava Prakasha will not stop with this. Later Ramanuja went in search of another teacher - and ultimately ended up with Yamanacharya group and became later the head of that mutt.
As the story goes later Yadava prakaasha recognized his heatred towards Ramanuja is unjustified and also recognizing that Advaita Vedanta is not giving him mental solace approached Ramanaju to take him as disciple. Ramanuja treated him with reverence and taught him the essence of Sharanagati.
These stories are not different from the stories that we read in the Shankara Digvijayas where there were episodes to kill Shankara too.
The best thing to do is ignore these cock and bull stories and concentrate on the essence of the teachings.
Ramanuja purvapaksha on Advaita vedanta in his Shree Bhashya on Brahmasutra should be studied even by Adviatins to see if the criticism is valid or not. Sreeeman S.M.S. Chari maama (He has written a book on Adviata-Vishishtadvaita and can be found from Acharya Google) stayed with me and taught me the Shree Bhashya.
Some of the criticisms that was presented on Advaiita L on avidya in Advaita can be found as part of seven untenables against advaita-avidya by Shree Ramanuja. This is before navya nyaaya was popular.

 Subject: [advaitin] Did an Advaitin plot to murder Ramanuja?

   There is a wide spread belief among Ramanuja's followers that Yadava Prakasha, an advaitin, under whom Ramanuja started his tutelage, plotted to murder the latter. However, there appears to be some disagreement in this regard. Some feel that Yadava Prakasha was not an Advaitin. There is credence to this thinking since contemporary scholars of the Ramanuja school think that the Sribhashya contains bits and pieces of what can be collated to reconstruct a 'Yadava Prakasha's school of thought', which is obviously distinct from the Advaita doctrine (this is vide a recent post in the BVP forum). There is also a thinking that there were two entities by the name Yadava Prakasha. Such information is conveyed in this Tamil article:
http://vsrc.in/index.php/articles/2014-07-30-08-57-48/item/714-2017-04-18-07-24-21

Are there any authentic studies conducted on these issues? The core issue that concerns Advaitins is the malicious propaganda that an Advaitin plotted to murder someone who purportedly opposed his views. Has anyone written in public forum to question the theory and bring out the truth?
