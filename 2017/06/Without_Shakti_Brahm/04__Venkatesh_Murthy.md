can be Avidyaa Ashraya also. Take Siva and Bhasmasura. If Siva is so
powerful against Maayaa why He became tricked by Bhasmaasura? Why Raama ran
after the
Hiranya Mruga? All these questions are answered only if you accept even
Iswara also  is Avidyaa Ashraya just like ordinary Jeeva is Avidyaa
Ashraya.

Then you will invariably ask what is difference between Ishwara and Jeeva?
Both can have Avidyaa. Yes but Ishwara is very infrequently under Avidyaa's
control but Jeeva is very frequently under Avidyaa control. Example - Siva
saw Mohini and got disturbed even though He has Parvati the foremost
Pativrata sitting with Him. But He got back control quickly. OTOH the
Rishis doing Tapas lost control seeing the Apsaras.

If Avidyaa is so powerful it has to be same as Maayaa only. Avidyaa and
Maayaa are one and the same. SSS cannot justify they are different. Ishwara
is like a Magician and Maayaa is in His control. But Maayaa is tricking
others. Therefore it is same as Avidyaa.
