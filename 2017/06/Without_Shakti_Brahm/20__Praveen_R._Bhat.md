Apologies.

So you do agree that others may have other requirements or even if they do
not require they may indulge in it due to prArabdha. Then, as long as the
main tattva of ब्रह्म सत्यं जगन्मिथ्या जीवो ब्रह्मैव नापरः is not
compromised, why should it bother you as to whether the other works quoted
are inline with some Shruti mantra that helped you? प्रक्रियाभेद exists to
solve existent questions. The answers to those questions would not
necessarily be inline with some random mantra that you pull out of your hat
and question everything that by your own agreement may be useful to others!​

        Nowhere I have stated that the study of other works of Sri Shankara

Far be it for me to even imply such a thing! Even as a wiser person, you
ought to have patience with other prakriyAs, prakaraNas or their
followers.​

Whats the point in further Upanishad and other granthas dropping off and
yet continuing these email threads that you definitely don't need?! If you
don't need anything further, congratulations. ​Instead of questioning
others, you could answer them! For people who don't need things discussed
here, Mandukya Ka. 1.36 has a wonderful statement, which one can take as a
विधिवाक्य or फलश्रुति so: अद्वैतं समनुप्राप्य जडवल्लोकमाचरेत्।
