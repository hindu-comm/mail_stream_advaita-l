Namaste

True but Sankara  Bhashya also has अविद्यात्मिका हि सा बीज
शक्तिरव्यक्तशब्दनिर्देश्या परमेश्वराश्रया मायामयी महासुषुप्तिः, यस्यां
स्वरूपप्रतिबोधरहिताः शेरते संसारिणो जीवाः

That Shakti is nothing but Maayaa only and Avidyaatmikaa.

But in Saundarya Lahari Shakti is not like that. She is Brahman only and
not different. Many Shakti worshippers also will say Shakti is same as
Brahman. Adi Sankara did not say if there is Shakti there must always be
Pravrutti. He only said if there is Pravrutti there must be Shakti. Shakti
can be in Nivrutti condition also. Therefore Shakti is nothing but Brahman
only.

> चावश्याभ्युपगन्तव्या ; अर्थवती हि सा ; न हि तया विना परमेश्वरस्य

> If we admit an independent latent power as the cause of the world, then we

> The idea conveyed here is very nicely presented by Shankara in the very
> opening verse of the Soundaryalahari:
>
> शिवःशक्त्यायुक्तो यदि भवति शक्तःप्रभवितुं
> न चेदेवं देवो न खलु कुशलः स्पन्दितुमपि।
> अतस्त्वाम् आराध्यां हरि-हर-विरिन्चादिभिरपि
> प्रणन्तुं स्तोतुं वा कथमकृतपुण्यः प्रभवति॥

> Shiva united with Shakti becomes able to manifest
> If otherwise, this god knows not even how to pulsate.
> How then could one of ungained merit be able to bow to, or even praise
> One such as you, adored by Vishnu, Shiva and Brahma.
>
> In the above verse the greatness of Shakti is brought out by stating that
> Shiva, Brahman, will be able to engage in cosmic activity only when united
> with His power. Without so uniting with Her, it is impossible to do
> anything for Brahman.
>
> Shankara in the BSB implies that when it comes to creation, etc., Brahman
> has to depend on Shakti. Without that Shakti, the Nirguna, Nishkriya
> Brahman is incapable of engaging in any activity.

> Thus Shankara conveys the Upanishadic message of the status and role of
> Brahman and Shakti in the Brahmasutra and the Soundaryalahari.
