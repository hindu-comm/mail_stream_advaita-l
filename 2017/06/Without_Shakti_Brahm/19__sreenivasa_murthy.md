Dear Sri Praveen Bhat,
The sentence in my previous e-mail "I know very well that just because I do not feel the need for other works the others also do not need them." should read as follows : "I know very well that just because I do not feel the need for other works, it does not mean that the others are not in need of them." In other words, they may need the other works also.
The error is regretted.Sreenivasa Murthy.

Dear Sri Praveen Bhatt ,
 You write :" However, I'd be surprised if he said also taught you that all other works of Bhagavatpadacharya, except Upanishadbhashya, are irrelevant." My Revered Guru never taught me that all other works of Bhagavatpadacharya, except upanishadbhashya,were irrelevant. He gave me the teaching of Upanishads and Sri Shankara's commentaries to suit my requirements for Atmajnana alone because that was my goal. I never felt the need for the other works of Sri Shankara and I never read them nor studied them as the teaching given by my Revered Guru was enough. Nowhere I have stated that the study of other works of Sri Shankara are not required by a seeker. I am not that stupid to make such a statement. I know very well that just because I do not feel the need for other works the others also do not need them. Sri Shankara's teachings are like a big ocean and I have taken that much of teaching which quenched my thirst. When once the thirst was quenched further seeking, reading etc. dropped off on their own accord. 
You write : "Through what should one know That owing to which all this is known!"THAT was What my Revered Guru taught me. Mantras 2-1-3&2-1-4 of Kathopanishad and Mantra 2-4 of Kena Upanishad and the Shrautatarka as stated in Brahmasutra 2-1-6 helped me in my inward journey. 

With this I close.
With respectful namaskarams,Sreenivasa Murthy

 Please see and understand the the significance and true meaning of the line " tadEjati tannaijati ||"

(b)

It is never my intention to judge or pass comments on the understanding of oter honourable members.
The above two statements (a) and (b) are in direct contradiction to each other; most of your responses come off as either sarcastic or patronizing or at the very least sarcastic. It is difficult to see that it is unintentional even after many responding to you so.

Sri Shankara, in his commentary to the above mantra, writes : tat AtmatattvaM yat prakRutam Ejati calati; tadEva ca naijati svatO naiva calati | svatO^calamEva sat calatIvEtyarthaH ||
It is this truth that a student of Vedanta has to cognize within himself by himself. Thus taught my Revered Guru.


Your Guru may have taught you well. However, I'd be surprised if he said also taught you that all other works of Bhagavatpadacharya, except Upanishadbhashya, are irrelevant.gurupAdukAbhyAm,
