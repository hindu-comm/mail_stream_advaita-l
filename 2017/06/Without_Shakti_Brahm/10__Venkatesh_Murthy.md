I think your question has been answered before by scholars here and that is
why they are not responding every time because your question is almost same
every time. Kindly answer this question and if you answer this question it
will be the answer to your question also. My question  to you is this. Why
Adi Sankara wrote not only Prasthana Traya Bhashya but also Vishnu Sahasra
Nama Bhashya, Lalita Trishati Bhashya, Prapanchasaara Tantra, Saundarya
Lahari, Ananda Lahari, Sivananda Lahari, Subrahmanya Bhujanga Stotra, and
many many Devata Stotras, IF he wanted to only convey Meaning of Upanishads
to every man, woman and child? Why? Why? Why did he say
*Vedo-nityam-adhiyatam **Taduditam karmasvanushthiyatam and so on?*
