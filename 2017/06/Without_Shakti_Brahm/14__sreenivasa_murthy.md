Dear Sri Venkataraghavan, I am grateful to you for your response. 
Mantra 5 of ISAvAsya Upanishad reds thus : tadEjati tannaijati taddUrE tadvantikE | tadantarasya sarvasya tadu sarvasyAsya bAhyataH ||
 Please see and understand the the significance and true meaning of the line " tadEjati tannaijati ||"
Sri Shankara, in his commentary to the above mantra, writes : tat AtmatattvaM yat prakRutam Ejati calati; tadEva ca naijati svatO naiva calati | svatO^calamEva sat calatIvEtyarthaH ||
It is this truth that a student of Vedanta has to cognize within himself by himself. Thus taught my Revered Guru. 

I do not know whether you have understood correctly the spirit in which the question was put by me. It is never my intention to judge or pass comments on the understanding of oter honourable members. If I have hurt their feelings I tender my apologies to all. I have the greatest respect for the scholarship of the members.
With respectful namaskars, Sreenivasa Murthy.

Namaste Sri Srinivasa Murthy,You said:
"The works which you have mentioned in your reply is of very little interest to me ."
If that is the case, why are you interested to know if the position outlined in Soundarya Lahiri is consistent with Chandogya upaniShad? The ideas in the first verse of that work is the subject matter of this thread, and that work is, in your words, of no interest to you.
If you have been spending most of your time telling others what they have been doing is useless and of no interest to you, please do not expect them to reply to you the next time you question them about what they are doing. They will assume the question is only rhetorical.
Regards,Venkatraghavan
