Namaste

Adi Sankara has clearly said in BSB 1-4-3 itself Avidyaatmikaa Hi Saa
Beejashaktiravyaktashabdanirdeshyaa Parameshwaraashrayaa Maayaamayee. This
is clear saying Maayaa is Parameshwara's Shakti only and She is
Avidyaatmikaa. On what authority are you saying Maayaa and Avidyaa are
different? Maayaa is inferior than Nirguna Brahman and not only that Maayaa
is MITHYA. Now we have a problem.

But we have to say also Shiva and Shakti are same. If Shakti is Avidyaa or
Maayaa only how can She be Brahman? For this we have to say there are two
Shaktis. One is Para Shakti and another is Aparaa Shakti. The Paraa Shakti
is same as Nirguna Brahma. The Aparaa Shakti is same as Maayaa same as
Avidyaa. Unfortunately SSS could  not judge this from Adi Sankara's
Bhashyas but it is there. In 1-1-5 Sankara Bhashya itself he has given
Upanishad reference Paraasya Shaktir Vividhaiva Sruyate. In 1-1-1 he has
said Asti Taavad Brahma Nitya Suddha Buddha Mukta Svabhaavam Sarvashakti
Samanvitam.

How can Brahman be Avidyaa Shakti? Not possible. Therefore we have to take
Shakti as two but not one in his Bhashyas. Sometimes it is Aparaa Shakti
that is Avidyaa. Sometimes it is Paraa Shakti that is Nirguna Brahma
itself.

Another thing is if SSS says Maayaa is not Avidyaa there is a big problem.
Because then Maayaa will be creating Dvaita. There is Brahman and there is
Maayaa. To solve this Maayaa should be Avidyaa and Mithya.
