Nice Subbuji.  

This was the controversial work and benefit of doubt was ascribed to this work.  
I had a glance (cursory though..) and perplexed to see some tantric mantras (मन्मथ तन्त्र) 
and thought how could a great advaitin whose mind used to roam in the lofty heights of vedanta
could compile such mantras ! 

सौन्दर्यलहरी, ललितात्रिशती भाष्यं, प्रपञ्चसारतन्त्रं - these 3 are always put under the scanner.

regs,
sriram
