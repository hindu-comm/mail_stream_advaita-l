Namaste Praveen Ji and Subrahmanian Ji,

My interest in asking the question in the first place was only with a view
to get the idea concerning mAyA and avidya  in a sutra like form similar to
shrotrasya shrotram which is easy to recall from memory whenever the terms
are encountered, and immediately highlights all the implications. That is
what the interpretation of shrotrasya shrotram in kenopanishad does. Since
such a sutralike format is aprasidha, I sought an answer here. Thanks for
the positive result as far as I am concerned. It serves my purpose.

Regards
