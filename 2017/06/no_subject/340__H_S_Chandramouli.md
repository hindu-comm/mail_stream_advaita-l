Namaste Sri Subrahmanian Ji,

You had mentioned मायायाः माया (mAyAyAH mAyA).  Based on  << मायां तु
प्रकृतिं विद्यान्मायिनं तु महेश्वरम्’ (श्वे. उ. ४ । १०)  (mAyAM tu
prakRRitiM vidyAnmAyinaM tu maheshvaram’ (shve. u. 4 | 10) >>,  can we
modify your statement to मायायाः मायी (mAyAyAH mAyI).  Would it be proper
grammatically ?



Regards
