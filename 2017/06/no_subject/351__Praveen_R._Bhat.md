The difference I see is thus: श्रोत्रस्य श्रोत्रं, चक्षुषः चक्षुः, 
मनसो
 मनः, don't directly lead to the inner-essence of each of those, but as
that hearing which makes the ear to be an ear, that sight which makes the
sight be a sight, etc. Now, with Maya and avidyA, I do not think we would
agree to say that that which makes Maya to be Maya or avidyA to be avidyA,
since to avoid the doSha of nirguNa being a cause, we bring in Maya/
avidyA. If we use this phrase, I think it would lead to saying that Maya or
avidyA deludes because of brahma, which is clearly not the case.
