Namaste Praveen Ji,



Reg  << In the strict analysis, I cannot see brahman being अधिष्ठान as the
same as meaning माया as अध्यस्त, else it will amount to say that the holder
of शक्ति is the cause for that शक्ति।>>,



My understanding is that the term for mAyA as shakti in sidhanta is not in
the sense of power (to be wielded by another person shakta), but is
synonymous with mAyA itself. In other words the term shakti is used in the
sense of a  vastu, just like mAyA/avidya is.



Regards
