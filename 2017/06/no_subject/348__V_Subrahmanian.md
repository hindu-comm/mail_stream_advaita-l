Namaste all,

I wish to give these two points to give more clarity to my earlier post:

1.   Sri Shankara bhAshya for BSB for 1.4.3 highlighted below identifies
mAyA as परमेश्वराधीना -dependent on parameshwara (SB).

तदधीनत्वादर्थवत् ॥ ३ ॥
भाष्यम्
अत्राह — यदि जगदिदमनभिव्यक्तनामरूपं बीजात्मकं प्रागवस्थमव्यक्तशब्दार्हमभ्यु
पगम्येत, तदात्मना च शरीरस्याप्यव्यक्तशब्दार्हत्वं प्रतिज्ञायेत, स एव तर्हि
प्रधानकारणवाद एवं सत्यापद्येत ; अस्यैव जगतः प्रागवस्थायाः
प्रधानत्वेनाभ्युपगमादिति । अत्रोच्यते — यदि वयं स्वतन्त्रां
काञ्चित्प्रागवस्थां जगतः कारणत्वेनाभ्युपगच्छेम, प्रसञ्जयेम तदा
प्रधानकारणवादम् ; परमेश्वराधीना त्वियमस्माभिः प्रागवस्था जगतोऽभ्युपगम्यते,
न स्वतन्त्रा । सा चावश्याभ्युपगन्तव्या ; अर्थवती हि सा ; न हि तया विना
परमेश्वरस्य स्रष्टृत्वं सिध्यति, शक्तिरहितस्य तस्य प्रवृत्त्यनुपपत्तेः ।
मुक्तानां च पुनरनुत्पत्तिः । कुतः ? विद्यया तस्या बीजशक्तेर्दाहात् ।
अविद्यात्मिका हि सा बीजशक्तिरव्यक्तशब्दनिर्देश्या परमेश्वराश्रया
मायामयी महासुषुप्तिः,
यस्यां स्वरूपप्रतिबोधरहिताः शेरते संसारिणो जीवाः ।

Here Shankara is saying that a shakti is definitely to be admitted, but as
subservient, adhīnā, to Brahman.

2. When we admit māyāyāḥ māyā, as kāraṇakāraṇam, Brahman is vivartopādāna
kāraṇam of māyā as well as its products. It is then alone, on the analogy
of यद्रजतं सा शुक्तिः, it is बाधायां सामानाधिकरण्यम् - where only when the
adhyasta is negated, it can be 'equated' with the adhiṣṭhānam, just as in
the example, only when the rajatam is negated, it is 'equated' with shukti.
Here, the understanding is: (what was wrongly seen as) rajatam is shukti
(alone). What was wrongly comprehended as kārya-kāraṇātmikā
prakrti/māyā/avidyā is none other than Brahman. The Sureshwara verse that
conveys this implicitly is:

तत्त्वमस्यादिवाक्योत्थसम्यग्धीजन्ममात्रतः
अविद्या सह कार्येण नासीदस्ति भविष्यति ।

The right knowledge arising from the instruction 'Tat tvam asi', etc.
instantly renders avidyā along with its effects as non-existent in all
three periods of time. This is a fine application of the
jnānanivartyavastu, avidyā, having no existence in all periods of time in
its locus, Brahman. It is in this sense alone 'avidyā is Brahman'.  माया
बाधिता सती ब्रह्मणा सह एकत्वं भजते ।

subbu
