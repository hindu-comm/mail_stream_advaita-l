Namaste Chandramouliji,

I'm just a little lost on some of what you said, clubbing them together
below:

I'm assuming that your reference to what Shastriji says was about the crux
of Kena being that chaitanya itself gets the upAdhi name. Even if we take
it that way, we can't say chaitanya itself gets the name Maya/ avidyA and
hence such phrases cannot be used for them.

> In the same way as shrotrasya shrotram? I do not think so. You may be
able to do so only with the first part of Shastriji's explanation in that "Any
upAdhi is active due to its association with Chaitanyam alone" but not and
Chaitanyam gets the name of the upAdhi itself in that context." since
chaitanya is surely what helps shrotra, etc, as well as Maya/ avidyA act,
but chaitanya itself can be called as shrotra, etc, with the upAdhi, but
not Maya/ avidyA with the upAdhi. The reason is that shrotra, etc, are
upAdhis due to Maya/ avidyA.

Moreover, I try to maintain that whenever mAya or avidyA are talked of as
the cause of the world, it is with chaitanya as adhiShTAna, but when jIva
is talked of as the cause of the world, it is with mAya/ avidyA as upAdhi;
the exact other way around, since jIvobrahmaiva nAparaH.
