> And I'm not saying anything different than "shakti is synonymous with
mAyA", unless your statement is "shakti is synonymous with brahman
itself". If you are indeed saying the latter, that is also true, yet only
in the sense of तेजसः उष्णवत्, the heat/ burning power of fire is
non-different from fire, that is it can neither be separated from fire nor
can exist without fire, but fire is not heat. Similarly, Maya can neither
be separated from brahman, nor can it exist apart from brahman, but brahman
is not Maya.
