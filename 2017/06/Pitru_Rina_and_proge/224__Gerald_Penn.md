I had heard once many years ago from a sannyasi that, in fact, by
embracing sannyasa, seven generations of one's ancestors and seven
generations of one's progeny are liberated.  Or perhaps my
recollection of the calculation is off, and seven generations in
total, three in either direction, are liberated.

I was wondering whether the readers of this list are familiar
with this notion, and whether there is a scriptural antecedent
for it.

Thanks,
Gerald Penn
