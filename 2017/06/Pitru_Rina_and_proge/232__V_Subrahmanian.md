Dear Sri Bala Subrahmanyam,

Have you come across any verse with these words:

मोदन्ते पितरः नृत्यन्ते पितामहाः...    I vaguely remember this as a verse
conveying the above sense of a brahmajnani liberating ......


A friend pointed out another verse:

आस्फोटयन्ति पितरः प्रनृत्यन्ति पितामहाः।
वैष्णवोऽस्मत्कुले जातः स नः सन्तारयिष्यति॥
(गरुडपुराणम् ॥ १।२२७।३४)

regards
