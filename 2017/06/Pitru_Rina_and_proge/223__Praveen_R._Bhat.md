True, but that is not the scriptural pitR RNa. It may be a good way to
explain moderners though.

Yes, Brihadaranyakopanishad mantra 1.5.16 says;
अथ त्रयो वाव लोका मनुष्यलोकः पितृलोको देवलोक इति सोऽयं मनुष्यलोकः
पुत्रेणैव जय्यो नान्येन कर्मणा कर्मणा पितृलोको विद्यया देवलोको देवलोको वै
लोकानां श्रेष्ठस्तस्माद्विद्यां प्रशंसन्ति ॥


Kind rgds,
