Dear Sri Gerald Penn,

Actually what is told in Mundaka Sruti (3-2-9) is "*NAsyAbrahmavit Kule
Bhavati*".

S.Sitarama Sastri’s translation of this published by G.A. Natesan & Co,
Madras in 1905: “*Moreover in the line of this knower, there will not be
born any who knows not the Brahman*”.

Probably in several Smrtis, it must have been mentioned that a BrahmajnAni
liberates several generations of his forefathers.

In Dasama Skandha of Srimad BhAgavata PurAna, it is mentioned that SrI
Krshna has immersed the Nanda Vraja VAsis in "Brahmahrada"; ie., He
bestowed on them the divine experience of Parabrahman.

In Srimad RAmAyana it is said that Sri RAma granted SantAna Lokas to
JatAyu. SantAna Lokas means the Jivas in those Lokas will be monotonically
progressing forward in their spiritual sAdhana till they attain Mukti.

Regards,

P.Bala Subrahmanyam
