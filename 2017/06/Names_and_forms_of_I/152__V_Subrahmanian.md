Thank you Sada ji, for posting Sri Vidyasankar ji's very apt delineation of
the theme of names and forms of Brahman.  I recall the Sāyana bhāṣya for
the Narayana sukta where he explicitly says that 'it is not any
mūrti-viśeṣa', that is, the 'Narayana' of that sūkta is not any formed
deity but the Upanishadic Nirguna Brahman.

warm regards
subbu
