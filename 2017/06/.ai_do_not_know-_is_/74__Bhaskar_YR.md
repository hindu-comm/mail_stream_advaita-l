*All questions arises only when a distinction is made between jnAna attained in samAdhi vs jnAna generated through maha vAkya and if it is told that the latter is not sufficient to remove ajnAna completely, without taking recourse to former.*

Yes, this is the prevalent advice of the vyAkhyAnakAra-s who interpret nidhidhyAsana as dhyAna and resultant samAdhi.  And based on this samAdhi experience and the method adopted to come back from that state or otherwise would determine the 'grades' of brahmajnAni-s (brahmavidvara, vareeya, varishTa etc.) Popular prakaraNa grantha-s like jeevanmukti viveka, panchadashi, vivekachUdAmaNi etc. would insist the importance of practical experience of Atmaikatva jnana in a particular state over the shAstra vAkya janita jnana through shravaNAdi sAdhana.  Recent works like yOga perfection and enlightenment too talks about this practical experience of samAdhi to know the ekatvaM which is enshrined in scriptures literally/exactly.  And wise advice of some knowers of tradition is that scripture is just like operating and instruction manual needs to be put into practice in Lab :-) 

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
