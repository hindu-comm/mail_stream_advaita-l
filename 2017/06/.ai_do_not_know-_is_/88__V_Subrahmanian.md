The akhandakaravritti is not intended to remove the saushuptika ajnana. The
article presented the deep sleep case as yet another instance of bhāvarupa
ajnana.

Actually even for a Jnani the deep sleep state will be no different from
that of others. Only that others wake up as samsarins while the Jnani does
not lose his realization. Only that realization destroys the mula ajnana
that projects samsara. As bādhita-anuvṛtti the states continue even for the
Jnani only with the difference mentioned above.

In this section the deep sleep state is taken up as an analogy for the
liberated state. So only the bliss, etc. part is highlighted. Just some
similarities are shown between deep sleep state and liberation.  The two
are not the same.
