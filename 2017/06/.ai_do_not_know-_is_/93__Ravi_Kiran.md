Why so ? why admit the bhāvarupa ajnana in sushupti, even after getting the
akhandakaravritti, in jAgrat, that destroys avidya that is causing samsara ?

What purpose does it serve ?

Yes, that is clear .. when atman knowledge is attained, one knows that
Turiyan
alone is, in and through all states .. I see your point is to bring out the
