Namaste Praveenji

Sruti mahavAkya janya jnAna gives only parOksha jnAna, while the akhandakara
> vritti attained
> in samAdhi alone gives aparOksha jnAna ( which destroys the bhAvarUpa
> ajnAna inherent in sushUpti as well)
>
I've no issues with either of the vivaraNa or bhAmati prakriyAs. I could
easily reconcile them as what is aparokSha, it is parokShavat and hence
called parokSha.

*All questions arises only when a distinction is made between jnAna
attained in samAdhi vs jnAna generated through maha vAkya and if it is told
that the latter is not sufficient to remove ajnAna completely, without
taking recourse to former.*

*But, how it is interpreted by some (though not in this thread), indicating
attaining aparoxa jnAna through samAdhi as the next logical step after
getting vAkya janya jnAna, makes the difference. *

*When you say, "one with the self", in That, as ekibhUta or ekibavana or
samprasAda, there is no distinction, whatsoever .. all logic, attributing
bhAva rUpa or otherwise, comes only upon waking :)  *
