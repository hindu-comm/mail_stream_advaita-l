Fine. This clarifies your viewpoint.
Positing bhAvarUpa ajnAna in sushupti, does not seem to impact here, as waking
state knowledge
is considered as the ultimate (aparoxa) knowledge that destroys ajnAna
completely
( in all states)

There are some who are of the viewpoint (based on Yoga Vedanta?) that -

Sruti mahavAkya janya jnAna gives only parOksha jnAna, while the akhandakara
vritti attained
in samAdhi alone gives aparOksha jnAna ( which destroys the bhAvarUpa
ajnAna inherent in sushUpti as well)

Some refs which supports this viewpoint, are from panchadasi 9th chap:

Let it be so; but the speciality of
meditation on the Absolute is that it is nearest to the goal of
Self-realisation.


126. When meditation on the attributeless Brahman is mature it leads to
Samadhi. This state of intense concentration at case leads on to the
Nirodha state in which the distinction between subject and object is
eliminated.


127. When such complete cessation of mental activity is achieved, only
the associationless entity (Atman) remains in his heart. By ceaseless
meditation on It based on
the great Sayings, arises the knowledge ‘I am Brahman’.


128. There is then a perfect realisation of Brahman as the immutable,
associationless, eternal, self-revealed, secondless whole, as
indicated in the scriptures.



157. Destroying his idea that the body is the Self, through meditation a
man sees the secondless Self, becomes immortal and realises Brahman in this body
itself.

There are other similar refs in vivekachudamani reg nirvikalpaka
samAdhi leading to videha mukti
as opposed to sadyo mukti.

In the bhAshya, you may notice the specific mention, "* there being nothing
separated from the self by ignorance  in that state of profound sleep", *

"When, however, that ignorance which presents things other than the self is
at rest, *in* that state of profound sleep,* there being nothing separated
from the self by ignorance*, what should one see, smell, or know, and
through what?"

Since, you do accept the waking state knowledge (generated from Sruti maha
vAkya) is ultimate, that destroys the bhAvarUpa ajnAna in sushupti too (
those who would like to consider it that way), I have nothing more to add
to continue :)

Thanks
