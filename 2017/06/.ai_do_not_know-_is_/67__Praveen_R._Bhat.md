The ajnAna in different states has the same locus; in Mandukya too, this
state is called as suShupti which manifests in other two states as well.
Therefore, to remove suShupti ajnAna, waking state knowledge is sufficient.

Should not, one resort to samAdhi practices ( as mentioned in some

Could you please quote any statement that says that samAdhi destroys
ajnAna. AFAIK, samAdhi is recommended as a means to manonAsha and
vAsanakShaya.

Bhashyakara introduces this mantra by saying यत्र पुनः सा अविद्या सुषुप्ते
वस्त्वन्तरप्रत्युपस्थापिका शान्ता, तेन अन्यत्वेन अविद्याप्रविभक्तस्य
वस्तुनः अभावात् , तत् केन कं पश्येत् जिघ्रेत् विजानीयाद्वा  and later in
the section so: तेन न पृथक्त्वेन व्यवस्थितानि करणानि, विषयाश्च ; तदभावात्
विशेषदर्शनं नास्ति ; He specifically says that the avidyA that projects
other objects is quietened, not completely absent, due to the lack of the
sense organs and objects being separate from each other, one cannot see,
smell, etc. All आनन्द talked about is anyway the स्वरूपानन्द only, so even
if it is mentioned in सुषुप्ति, it is the आनन्दमयकोष that reflects it.
