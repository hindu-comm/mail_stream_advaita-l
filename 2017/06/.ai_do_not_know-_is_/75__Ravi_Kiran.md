It would be interesting to know, how such a knowledge ( akhandakaravrtti)
attained in samAdhi, differs from shAstra vAkya janita jnana?
If such a samAdhi janya jnana has potential to remove the avidya
completely, in such a way ( incl of avidya lesha responsible for
prarabdha), such a one (using just for discussion sake), may not return
back from nirvikalpa samAdhi ( the upAdhi may drop off eventually) , right ?
