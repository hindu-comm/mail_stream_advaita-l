​As to how this works, I like Panchadashikara's beautiful parallel that
drives the point ​home. He gives an example of a brahmachArI that tries
over the day to learn the VedapATha by rote, but just can't get it right.
However, he sleeps at night and on waking up in the morning, he chants
easily! How this happens cannot be explained, it just does. I'd be
surprised if people do not have any such "experience". So too, if one feels
that with shravaNa he has still not got it, yet after
niddidhyAsana-samAdhi, he could just as easily "get it". :)

On a related note, for what its worth: nirvikalpakasamAdhi cannot cause
jnAnotpatti, but savikalpakasamAdhi can.
निवृत्तिस्तस्य तु ज्ञानादेवेति प्रविभावितम्।
तज्ज्ञानं सविकल्पं स्यादज्ञानस्य प्रबाधनम्॥
निर्विकल्पकविज्ञानादज्ञानं न निवर्तते।
निर्विकल्पकविज्ञानं केनचिन्न विरुद्ध्यते॥

​Also on a related note, Vidyasankarji had written a good series on Yoga
and Vedanta which you may find in the mail archives, if you haven't seen​.
Unfortunately, I haven't been able to find the series beyond 10, where it
seems to be incomplete. Vidyasankarji, could you lead us to the rest? For
some reason, it is not listed in the series section on the main page.
