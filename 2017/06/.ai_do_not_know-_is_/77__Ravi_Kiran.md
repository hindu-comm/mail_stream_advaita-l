Thanks for sharing this ref. So, one can decidedly conclude that the
knowledge born of samAdhi ( of the form, I am Brahman, based on वाक्यात्
जायेत तत्त्वधीः ) has no more role to play, in removing the ajnAna (cause
for samsara) completely, be it in sushupti ( as bIja rUpa or bhAva rUpa),
than the atmaikatva knowledge attained through Sruti maha vAkya.

If there is any difference of opinion, on the oneness knowledge born of
samAdhi, would be interested to hear more details regarding the same, from
(samAdhi) experienced ones.
