Either Shivprasadji is not on the list or he missed the list. In any case,
I am forwarding the same to the list before responding.

However, on a slightly different note, Shankara has actually cursed a whole set of Brahmins.  Let me give you some background.  Shankara came as promised to his mother, his mother's Anthim Kaaryam.  But the Brahmins of that place, and, following the tradition, said there is no Agni Kaaryam for a Sanyasi.  So, they refused to give him fire-wood and fire.  He cut banana trees and did the last rites.  But he was enraged so much that, he cursed them to be Paraya at mid-afternoon, the time when this incident took place.  That community of Brahmins are known as Maadyanika Parayas.  And, normally no Smarthas will have Vivaha Sambandham with that community, till today.  Now, don't enter inter specious and spurious lies like intellectually dishonest Subbu and, say no such incident took place or no such community exists.  Many Tamil and Kerala Brahmins would personally know people of that community.  So, now tell me, based on his Adwaitham, who was Shankara cursing, when he cursed those Brahmins?
