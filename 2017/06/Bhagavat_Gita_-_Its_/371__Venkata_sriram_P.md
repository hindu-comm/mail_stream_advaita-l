Namaste,

The great sanskrit scholar & modern economist Dr.VR Panchamukhi needs no introduction to the scholars' community.

A few months back, he gave beautiful discourses in english about the importance of BG and it's relevance to the current society
from management & administrative perspective.  I followed most of his lectures in SVBC channel.  However, Raghavendra Swamy Mutt, Mantralayam has uploaded online all his lectures which has come to almost 80 episodes.  

Here is the link to listen.
