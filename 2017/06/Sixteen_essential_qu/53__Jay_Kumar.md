Namaskarams to all.

While it is a very useful, comprehensive and an   informative posting to the
seekers of 'moksha'  (at all stages),  by Sri V Subramanian,  the
significance of the 16 points would get reinforced with authenticity if the
source is made known. Whether  they are  referred in the article by some
scholar or the views of a great individual. if so, name of the source or the
individual may please be let known .

Regards,

S K Jayakumar
