Dear Sri Jayakumar,

A google search led me to this source:

https://www.kamakotimandali.com/advaita/truefacts.html

The author of that blog seems to be the one who has prepared the list. He
has not identified anyone else as the compiler of the list. It is apparent
he had Sri Shankaracharya in mind and prepared the list based on the
Acharya's personality, philosophy, etc.
