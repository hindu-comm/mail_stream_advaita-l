Thanks, I didn't know that. I meant Vishnu sleeping on the snake. Maybe they are completely different because Brahma obviously is still not on the navel of Vishnu or is he still believed to be so?
Thanks

 Ananta is Sesha. Ananta sleeping on Sesha thus is not correct. By the way therei is temple for Sesha in Nagarcoil.

Kalyanji,
Yes, there are many idols which are different from each other. But in case of Ranganatha and Padmanabha idols, both are in the state of Yoga Nidra. I am wondering if there can be multiple ways of depicting Yoga Nidra. Further, I am not certain if there is another temple dedicated to Ananta sleeping on a serpent Shesha except the Ranganatha temple (3 temples, I think) and the Trivandrum temple. If there is, then there is possibly a reference in Agamas as to how the idol should be designed?
>From what I understand, Padmanabhaswamy temple is older than Sri Rangam temple.

Dear Sri Aditya

//So I am wondering if this is the original representation of Narayana/Vishnu and that Ranganatha was conceived later by Ramanujacharya.//

Srirangam temple is much older than Ramanuja. It is mentioned in Tamil Sangam literature.

Mahabharata also talks of Vishnu sleeping in the ocean on a giant serpent (without any mention of Shiva linga).

Having said that, there is no such thing as the original representation of Vishnu. In some temples the idol is in a standing posture, in some temples the idol is in a sleeping posture, in some temples the idol is in a sitting posture. It varies from temple to temple.

Regards
Kalyan
