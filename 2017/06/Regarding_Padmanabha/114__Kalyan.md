//Further, I am not certain if there is another temple dedicated to Ananta sleeping on a serpent Shesha except the Ranganatha temple (3 temples, I think) and the Trivandrum temple.//

Dear Sri Adityaji, there is also a Govindaraja swamy temple in Tirupathi where the idol is in a sleeping posture. The original temple was in Tamil Nadu, but it is said that a fanatical king got the original idol thrown into the sea. The temple at Tirupathi was built later.


//From
what I understand, Padmanabhaswamy temple is older than Sri
Rangam temple.//

Could you please tell me how you reached this conclusion? As far as I understand, the dates of very old temples cannot be determined with certainty.

Regards
Kalyan
