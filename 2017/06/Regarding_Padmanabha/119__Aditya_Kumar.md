Kalyanji,
Yes, we can't arrive at the exact date but we can get information about the time period. Inscriptions, local legends, some temple records or a lineage of priests or patrons can throw some light. The temple website claims that it was built during the beginning of the Kali era. Based on that information and also the uniqueness of the temple, I am inclined to believe that it is ancient.
In any case, both the temples are unique in their own way. However, the Padmanabha idol was so intriguing that I thought perhaps this is an accurate representation of Vishnu. I had never seen anything quite like that before.

Dear Sri Adityaji, there is also a Govindaraja swamy temple in Tirupathi where the idol is in a sleeping posture. The original temple was in Tamil Nadu, but it is said that a fanatical king got the original idol thrown into the sea. The temple at Tirupathi was built later.


//From
what I understand, Padmanabhaswamy temple is older than Sri
Rangam temple.//

Could you please tell me how you reached this conclusion? As far as I understand, the dates of very old temples cannot be determined with certainty.

Regards
Kalyan
