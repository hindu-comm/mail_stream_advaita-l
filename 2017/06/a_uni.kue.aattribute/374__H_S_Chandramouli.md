Reg  << right knowledge of
the form 'this is a rope and not a snake' arises, that knowledge as well is
illumined by the sakshi.>>,



Is this not termed “pramatr bhasya” and not “sAkshi bhAsya” ?  I agree that
the statement only states  “illumined by the sAkshi” and not “sAkshi
bhAsya” . But taken with the general flow of the post, it is very likely to
be understood to mean  “sAkshi bhasya”.



Also the term “pramatr bhAsya” does not find a place at all in the post,
and the difference between it and “sAkshi bhAsya” is not broughtout at all.
Is it intended?
