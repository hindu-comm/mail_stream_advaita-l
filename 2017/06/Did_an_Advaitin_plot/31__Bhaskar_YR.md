It is like an allegation on shankara who planned to kill thousands of bauddha-s.  And this aversion towards them is  due to his disagreement with their doctrine :-) 

I have read something related to this in an article title goes something like  ' Ancient Terrorist'  or A Terrorist monk :-) I think this article might still be available somewhere in web. 

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
