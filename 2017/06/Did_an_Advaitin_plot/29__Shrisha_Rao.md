Śrī Rāmānuja lived (according to his tradition, with no dispute that one is aware of) to the age of 120, completing two full 60-year cycles in his lifetime.  Therefore, at the very least, a murder (if there was one) did not cut his life too short.  Secondly, if Yādava Prakāśa was Ramanuja’s tutor, then he must have been even older, and must have waited for the better part of a century to carry out his heinous deed, which is surely a serious tax on any sensible person’s credulity.

Regards,

Shrisha Rao
