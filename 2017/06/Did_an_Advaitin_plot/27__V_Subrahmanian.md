There is a wide spread belief among Ramanuja's followers that Yadava
Prakasha, an advaitin, under whom Ramanuja started his tutelage, plotted to
murder the latter. However, there appears to be some disagreement in this
regard. Some feel that Yadava Prakasha was not an Advaitin. There is
credence to this thinking since contemporary scholars of the Ramanuja
school think that the Sribhashya contains bits and pieces of what can be
collated to reconstruct a 'Yadava Prakasha's school of thought', which is
obviously distinct from the Advaita doctrine (this is vide a recent post in
the BVP forum). There is also a thinking that there were two entities by
the name Yadava Prakasha. Such information is conveyed in this Tamil
article:

Are there any authentic studies conducted on these issues? The core issue
that concerns Advaitins is the malicious propaganda that an Advaitin
plotted to murder someone who purportedly opposed his views. Has anyone
written in public forum to question the theory and bring out the truth?
