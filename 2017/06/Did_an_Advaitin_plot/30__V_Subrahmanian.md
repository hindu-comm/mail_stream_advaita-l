I did not mean that Ramanuja was indeed murdered. What I said, basing on
popular story about Ramanuja, is that Yadava Prakasha *plotted* to murder
him during a pilgrimage.

http://srivaishnavam.com/ramanuja_lifehistory.htm

//Yadavaprakasa did not like Ramanuja coming up and wanted to kill him. So
he made a plan along with his other disciples to take a pilgrimage(holy
tour) and on the way kill Ramanuja and go to ganga and get rid of the sin.

On an auspicious day all the students with Yadavaprakasa started the holy
tour. After a few days, when they reached the vidhya mountains in central
India, Yadavaprakasa decided that it was the right time to kill Ramanuja
and started acting on his plan. Somehow Ramanuja's cousin came to know
about this plan and told Ramanuja to escape. Ramanuja immediately took the
advice of his cousin and ran inside the forest.

Yadavaprakasa and the other disciples started searching for Ramanuja and
Govinda also acted as if he did not know anything about this. After some
time they concluded some animal would have killed Ramanuja and continued
their pilgrimage.


CHAPTER 4

After Ramanuja escaped into the forest, he ran for a long distance and sat
below a tre to take some rest. He was so tired that he fell asleep
immediately. After some time when he woke up he found the sun setting in
the west. He thanked Lord Varadarja Perumal of kancheepuram for saving his
life.//
