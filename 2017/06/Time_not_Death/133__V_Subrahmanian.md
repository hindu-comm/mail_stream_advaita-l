In the Mandukya karika 4.58 bhashya Shankara has said:

सा च माया न विद्यते । मायेत्यविद्यमानस्याख्येत्यभिप्रायः ॥ [That Maya does
not exist. The purport is that 'māyā' is the name for that which does not
exist.]

Maya, avidya, space, time, etc. are admitted provisionally only to account
for samsara and the method for release from samsara. From the absolute
point of view these concepts have no place in Vedanta.
