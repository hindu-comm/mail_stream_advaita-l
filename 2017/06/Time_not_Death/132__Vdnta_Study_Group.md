*/// Time is just a concept. It is like Maya. There is nothing called Maya
///*

Is there any pramana to suggest the above? As far as I know, shankarAchArya
mentions avidyA (for the sake of our discussion let us akin it to the
samaSTi mAyA) as having bhAva. It is a vastu enjoying existence, albeit a
dependent one. Therefore I am not too sure how we're saying there is
nothing called mAyA. As far as 'time' being just a concept, even this I
would approach with some skepticism. Space is just as real (or unreal) as
time is, in that they're both mithyA, but have a dependent vyAvahAra
reality.

If time were just a concept, it would not be influenced by anything, which
we know to be untrue. But that aside, I'm we have shAstra to indicate that
mAyA is an existing principle, as are dEsha-kAlA

Namaste,
Prashant
