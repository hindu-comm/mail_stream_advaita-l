This is true.  But it isn't it strange that people are afraid of death but 
not afraid of time?  Shankaracharya brings this out in the mohamudgara 
stotra in which he admonishes an old man who is studying to vyakarana to 
"bhaje govindam".

This is another example of bad interpretations and translations.  Some 
make it out to be some sort of tirade against grammar which is ridiculous 
to anyone who knows the position vyakarana plays in Sanskrit scholarship. 
(In fact according to thinkers like Bhartrahari, it is itself a form of 
Vedantic sadhana.)  No; what the acharya is saying is that why would you 
wait until your time has almost run out to begin sadhana?  The right 
time is now.
