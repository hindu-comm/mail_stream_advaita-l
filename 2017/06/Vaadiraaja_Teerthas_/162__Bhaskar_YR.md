Only one answer to the dvaitins. It is the Veda itself that tells us, atra vedA avedAH.

Humble sAshtAnga praNAms Sri Vidya prabhuji
Hare Krishna

Yes prabhuji, it is shruti itself saying thatâ€¦but dvaitins donot interpret it that way that we do,  keeping the importance of shabda pramANa in mind.  According to them veda avedAH etc.  something related to  not knowing anything at that state and it is not the non-existence of shruti / veda.  Sri Krishna Kadiri prabhuji in vAdAvaLi group, has quoted something with related to this from anuvyAkhyAna by madhvAchArya and argued why veda is avedAH not related to shruti / veda  pramANa.

Your humble servant
Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
