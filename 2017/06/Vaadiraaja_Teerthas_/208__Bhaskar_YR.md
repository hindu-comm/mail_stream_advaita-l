But, how does this qualify paramArtha drSTi ?
Do you see it as such ? J


Ø     What exactly is the paramArtha drushti or saMyak drushti ?? One wave seeing the other wave and giving it an independent existence is parichinna drushti or avidyA drushti, the same wave after realizing that it is nothing but water seeing other wave and realizing that it is too water only and does not have independent existence apart from water.  To know this truth behind the wave, wave does not have to subside completely  and become levelled water if that is the case we will have to wait for the complete levelled settlement of these waves and whenever there is no waves in ocean then only we will have to call  it as ‘water’.  That can happen only in mahApraLaya where nAma rUpa would get transformed into avyakta and become one with its kAraNa.   And ekamevAdviteeyatvaM can be attributed to brahman only after mahApraLaya where there vyAkruta nAma rUpa conspicuous by its absence!!  OTOH knowing the kAraNa svarUpa (water) behind kArya  even when kArya existing is the drushti of ekatva.  From that drushti wave’s astitva does not come to an end only svatantra astitva of wave apart from water would get sublated (bAdhita).  One big wave knows that it is nothing but water and it also knows that other waves too nothing but water and all waves have the base as water and nothing else.  When the biggest wave (paramAtma who is instructing) instructs  bigger wave (special jnAni-s) to guide small waves (ordinary jnAni-jeeva-s) to know their svarUpa water, the water would remain same as water only despite the existence of big, bigger and biggest waves.  Because biggest and bigger waves know that they are nothing but water  sarvataH samplutOdakaM says geeta, apOvA idagaM sarvaM says veda, sarvaM ApomayaM jagat says durgaa saptashati.  This tAdAtmya saMbandha what bigger and biggest waves (kArya) has with water  (kAraNa) brahmavAdi kArya (apAntaratama –vyAsa) knows that it is in its svarUpa nothing but kAraNa and its saMbandha with kAraNa is tAdAtmya.  Shankara clarifies this in sUtra bhAshya : brahma vAdinaH kathA iti chet ??  tasya tAdAtmyalakshaNasaMbandhOpapatteH..


Ø   Hope we are not again going back to  jagat satyatva in its kAraNa svarUpa ☺


Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
