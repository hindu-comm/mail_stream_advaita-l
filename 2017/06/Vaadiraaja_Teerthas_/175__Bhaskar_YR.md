Thanks. If so, how can they raise objections against Vedic statements itself ?


Ø   By interpreting the veda vAkya in a different way like attatvamasi instead of tattvamasi ☺


without any conditions like advaitins :-)  because for us there is a state where 'atra veda aveda :-) ...but according to them (dvaitins) these are all inappropriate quotes from shruti to substantiate that everything is brahman.

When it is so told in Vedic texts itself, Brahman is spoken of as being fishermen, etc., how can dvaitins consider them as inappropriate?
Is it not more appropriate, the way Advaitin explains, that as sat svarUpa , everything is Brahman Itself ? ( from paramArtha stance)

Ø     From paramArtha stance brahman is nirvishesha nirguNa niravayava not antaH prajNa nor bahirprajnA not even prajnAna Ghana under these circumstances how can he be chandaala, bitch, woman, man, boy, youth etc. ?? does your brahman is vikAri like this in paramArtha ??   that is their point of objection and insist that we don’t have any legitimate right to quote shruti as pramANa when we comfortably putting everything (including veda)  under the mithyA category compartment ☺
Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
