Davitin's paxa is that bEdha (any bEdha) is the very svarUpa (self same
nature) of the dharmi. For a bEdha to exist, no need for two real entities
to exist.

Do you agree there a bEdha between you and vandyAputra?

Obviously yes. Even though pratiyOgi is non-existing, the bEdha is still
exist. Why? This bEdha is self same nature of anuyOgi 'you'. By yourself
being sat vastu yourself on your own, you stand 'differentiated' from all
other non existing entities.

These fine points are explained well in a nyayA terminology in a work call
bEdhOjjivana by Sri.VyasatIrtha (of nyAmrita fame) refuting earlier work
bEdha dikkara by Sri.nraSihma sharma (?)

Please study that if you can.
