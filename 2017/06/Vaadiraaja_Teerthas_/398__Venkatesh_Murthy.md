Namaste

The problem is Gunas and Vakyas giving Gunas of Brahman have meaning in
Dvaita but not in Advaita. The Upanishad is saying -
yatra hi dvaitam iva bhavati, tad itara itaraṁ jighrati, tad itara itaram
paśyati, tad itara itaram śrṇoti, tad itara itaram abhivadati, tad itara
itaram manute, tad itara itaraṁ vijᾱnᾱti. yatra tv asya sarvam ᾱtmᾱivᾱbhῡt,
tat kena kaṁ jighret, tat kena kam paśyet, tat kena kaṁ śṛṇuyat, tat kena
kam abhivadet, tat kena kam manvīta, tat kena kaṁ vijᾱnīyᾱt?

In Kevala Atma condition there is no Deva no Danava no Manuja no GooDha, no
Sarvavyapee because there is no Sarva but only One, there is no Sarvabhoota
Antaratma because there is no Sarva Bhoota at all but only One, No Karma
and so on. Therefore all the Gunas like Sarvajnatva become meaningless.

But for dull minded people the Sruti will first give instructions about
Saguna Brahma to make them understand Nirguna through Saguna. All the Bheda
Srutis cannot prove Dvaita because Dvaita is ALREADY KNOWN by Pratyaksha. A
baby to old man all know they are seeing Dvaita only. We don't expect Sruti
to come and tell us Dvaita is there in the world. Then why Bheda Srutis?
Because they are leading to Abheda Srutis like the Dog is leading to the
Lion in the dream. That is the only job they are doing. They are not
Pramanas for Dvaita.
