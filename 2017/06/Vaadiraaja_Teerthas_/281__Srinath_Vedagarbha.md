If both abheda and bheda shrutis are pramANas before bhama-jnyAna, then I
would argue there would not be any dawn of brahma jnAna at all, for what is
the nature of that jnAna ? jIva-brahm aikya jnAna? or jIva-brahma bEdha
jnAna? Since these are contradictory, it is jnyAna at all!

Your answer assumes there are already two phases of vyavahArika and
paaramaarthika are siddha before you even approach shruti. They are not.
Unless shruti is pramaNya as a whole, there is no such determination at
all.

Also from vAda perspective -- you cannot substantiate your argument based
on *your* siddhAnta of  vyavahArika and paaramaarthika. Dvaitins do not
accept such notions.
