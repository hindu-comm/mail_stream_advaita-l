Venkat ji,

For dvaitins 'ekam Eva advitiyam' only means Brahman is sajatiya bheda
rahitam. Vijatiya world and jivas can coexist with Brahman.

regards
subbu


How does that explain the two eva-s in that sentence? - sadeva ... AsId
ekameva. The first eva rules out coexistence of vijAtIya entities along
with sat.

Best regards,
Vidyasankar
