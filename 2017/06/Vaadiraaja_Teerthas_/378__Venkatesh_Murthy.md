Namaste Sri Subrahmanian

How do you answer the question about Advaitis supporting Bheda between
Brahman and Gunas? Will it not be against the Abheda Siddhanta of Advaita?
When you are seeing Abheda only everywhere why are you seeing Bheda here?

We cannot ask Dvaitis why they are supporting Abheda here and will it not
be against Bheda Siddhanta? Because Dvaitis never said they will see Bheda
only everywhere. They say there is 5 kinds of Bhedas like Bheda between two
Jeevas, Bheda between Jeeva and Ishwara, Bheda between Jeeva and Jada
Vastu, Bheda between one Jada and another Jada and Bheda between Ishwara
and Jada. But they never said everywhere we are seeing Bheda only in the
World. In some places they are seeing Abheda also. But Advaitis said
everywhere there is Abheda. That is why Neha Nanasti Kimchana and so on.

I think one answer is Advaitis say Brahman is Satya and Gunas are not
Satya. But this is not Bheda between Brahman and Gunas. Why? Because if
there is Bheda between a Satya Vastu and a Mithya Vastu that Bheda is also
Mithya only. When the Mithya Vastu is not there Bheda also is not there.
Therefore we have protected the Abheda Doctrine of Advaita. No Siddhanta
Hani.

The Dvaitis cannot  come back and say if you say there is no Bheda or Bheda
is Mithya you are agreeing Abheda between Brahman and Gunas. No that is not
correct because if Gunas are not existing where is the question of Bheda
and Abheda?

It has become a bit confusing but I tried to keep my head and
thoughts clear.
