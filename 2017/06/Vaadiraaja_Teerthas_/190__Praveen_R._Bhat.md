​Physical body is seen, but wrongly taking oneself to be the physical body
is naisargika. The physical body not being conscious is also known. One's
being conscious is also known by anubhava. Shruti just disconnects the
wrong locus where you have I placed which is anubhavasiddha.

​No, Atma is anubhavasiddha, but the wrong understanding is corrected by
Shruti. A meditator or a vivekin anywhere around the world can get this
experience of being totally separate from the body, etc, without being told
by Shruti so.

​To the contrary, as above, your conclusions are wrong.
