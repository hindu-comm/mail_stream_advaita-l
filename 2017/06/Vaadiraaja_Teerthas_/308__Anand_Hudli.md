Yes. MM Shri Sastri remarks in his VP commentary 1.9 - akhaNDAkAravRttireva
sarvadRshyanAsharUpeti svasyApi virodhinIti. The final vRtti, called the
akhaNDAkAra vRtti destroys all bhAva-rUpa-ajnAna ignorance and itself. We
had a discussion on akhaNDAkAra vRtti sometime ago. Please consult the
archives for more information.
