True, but I did not talk of anything after death. ​I just said that the
uttamapuruSha, who is later revealed by Shruti to be Purushottama, is known
to all. Just as a prince lost in a tribe thinks himself to be a tribal and
revealed later to be the prince, is known to him. Whether he knew himself
as the prince or a tribal is irrelevant. He knew himself is what is
anubhavasiddha, though wrongly, but knew. Similarly, the uttamapuruSha who
has wrong locus in any of the koShas cannot be revealed by any other
pramANa. Its wrong to think that anyone else but I can know I. That is why
advaitins say that Shruti reveals the oneness by removing ajnana of having
the wrong locus.

As I said do not get into science. One's brain is not anubhavasiddha. :)

If ​self-awareness known as self-awareness is ​not Atma, then Shruti can
give nothing other than some parokShajnAna like your brain being talked
about by science.

You think Atma is this self-awareness as we experince. That is not correct.

Disagree. When one knows of the possibility of error by saying that Atma is
sukhasvarUpa, ananta, etc, one can logically question that what is this
Atma since I know not of myself to be sukhasvarUpa, etc. In fact, we say
that had Atma not been known, there would be no problem and if Atma would
be fully known, there would be no problem. Only if Atma is known partially,
meaning incorrectly, is a problem. So we disagree with this interpretation
given by Madhvacharya and instead say that Atma is known ​but not fully, it
is known wrongly.

More over, this jIva does undergo change (vIkara) in waking, dream and

​Such thinking that Atma undergoes change itself goes against all Shrutis,
eg, nAntaHprajnaH na bahiShprajnaH.
