2) both abheda and bheda shrutis are atattvAvedaka.

When there was a discussion about shAstra prAmANya ( I don’t remember in which group), when I said,  bandha mOksha, shAstra all are in the realm of avidyA kshetra (vide adhyAsa bhAshya) someone asked me, OK after the dawn of knowledge through shAstra vAkya you are going to say shAstra is also in the avidyA kshetra, it is no more pramANa and pramANa, prameya, pramAtru all are kevala avidyA vyavahAra so no reality in it. So after the dawn of socalled knowledge you have you are sure that your approach towards pramANa is avidyAtmaka.    If that is the case how can you be sure that the socalled knowledge what you get from the shAstra is vidyA when shruti itself is in avidyA kshetra ??  Since the person (pramAtru) who approach the shruti is avidyAvanta, the pramANa the shruti is again in the realm of this avidyA kshetra  you boldly declaring that what you got (prama)  from this avidyA pramAna  which has been approached by avidyAvanta pramAtru is ultimate satya and jnana!!  How can you be sure about your jnana when you are claiming that shAstra is itself not directly teaching the brahman as that and this ?? In short,  How can a atattvAvedaka vAkya can fetch you the knowledge of tattva??  And again the karma, vidhi and phala which are part and parcel of karma kAnda of veda you are  pushing it aside as avidyaka (if not outrightly rejecting it)  and holding the other portion (jnana kAnda)  of same veda and claiming that knowledge obtaining from that is unsublatable knowledge...It clearly shows your dubious approach towards veda as pramANa.  He asked somany questions like this, I just remembered this objectione when I read the shruti pramANa is in avidyAkshetra but shruti knowledge is ultimate and other shruti / veda knowledge pertaining to karma kAnda  is dvaita and hence avidyAtmaka.  

And frankly I don’t know what I had replied to him since it was almost a decade ago :-) 

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
