samAnasattA - the bheda between khapuShpa and kham can only be said to
belong to khapuShpa, because it is accepted that kham only has one guNa -
shabda.

One can have bhAva abhAva vyavahAra with only bhAva padArthas, not with
those that never exist anywhere.

The sentence ekamevAdvitIyam can have only four possibilities:

1) guNas are the only thing, Brahman is not in existence. Then by that
definition Brahman is asat, because you are saying guNas are the only
things that exist (ekamevAdvitIyam). So Brahman cannot exist, which is
aniShTam for you. Further, how can guNas exist without guNi? So even guNas
cannot exist, leading to shUnyavAda.

2) Brahman is the only thing, guNa is not in existence. This is the same as
advaita, as it says Brahman is the only thing in existence and its guNas
are not in existence (if Brahman and its guNas both existed then
ekamevAdvitIyam would be wrong), leading to nirguNa Brahman.

3) guNas and Brahman both exist. Then either

a) they are two different things and shruti is wrong, which is impossible.

b) or they are the same thing, which again, leads to options 1 and 2.

4) Nothing is ekamevAdvitIyam. This leads to shUnyavAda and shruta hAni.
