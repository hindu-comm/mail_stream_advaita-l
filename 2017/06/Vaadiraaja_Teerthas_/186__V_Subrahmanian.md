This is true. Shankara has said in the Br.up. Bhashya: 5.1.1:

 न हि द्वैतम् अद्वैतं वा वस्तु जातमात्रमेव पुरुषं ज्ञापयित्वा पश्चात्कर्म
वा ब्रह्मविद्यां वा उपदिशति शास्त्रम् ; न च उपदेशार्हं द्वैतम् ,
जातमात्रप्राणिबुद्धिगम्यत्वात् ;

Every being knows its limited nature without being instructed . Even
atheists do not claim that they are infinite. They only deny a supreme
power higher than themselves.

And when Shruti teaches that Ishwara is infinite and if it also teaches
that the jiva is in truth finite, then there is the flaw of
vastu-paricchedatva for Ishwara and thereby His infinitude stands negated.
