Interesting .. the jIva is never free from adhyAsa ( in moksha too )

>  Interestingly in Advaita also there seems  a grade in jeeva-s (upAdhi-s) even after jnana and there is a difference among  paramAtma, ordinary jeeva  and specially eligible jeeva-s.  In sUtra bhAshya third adhyAya (?? Not sure) shankara talks about jnAni-s punarjanma.  Here he clarifies most of the jnAni -jeeva-s would get merged themselves in brahman  (like clean water merging with clean water) as soon as they exhaust the prArabdha.  But some special jnAni-jeeva-s like apAntaratama would take the next janma with the remnants of their prArabdha  (as vyAsa) as per the instruction of paramAtma.  So, here contextually we have to understand there is a difference among ordinary jnAni, special jnAni and paramAtma and there will be a dialogue between paramAtma and these special jeeva-s to fulfill the particular cause in srushti etc.  

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
