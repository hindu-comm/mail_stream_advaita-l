Somehow does not sound comfortable as a response to the dvaitins on the
current issue. It almost gives the impression that advaita sidhanta depends
upon vedA being avedA for establishing its  sidhanta,


nAyaM doshaH.

The advaita method depends on the word of the veda that the veda itself
becomes aveda. This may or may not be a matter of experience for most
people, but that doesn't matter. The siddhAnta arises naturally from the
analysis of the experience, as outlined in the veda itself. We do not
resort to any special interpretation that ends up negating the import of
the vedavAkya.
