Apart from this, the proposed position suggests two view points: a
mukta-view point of the veda and the amukta view point of the same. This is
only a rephrasing of the Advaita position.

Also, if the vedas are no longer useful to the mukta 'as veda', then, in
what way does the veda continue to exist for the mukta? If 'vedatva' is
divested of the veda by the mukta, the veda ceases to exists; just as a pot
if it does not have potness, ceases to be a pot.

In Dvaita there is a svarupa sharira for the jiva which will never cease to
be and will continue in moksha. With that sharira which has mind, sense
organs, etc which is all chinmātra, the jiva will enjoy all sense pleasures
and engage in devotional practices in moksha. And that svarupa of the jiva
is atomic in size as per their doctrine.
