I'm surprised that he is proud of using such junk words as you quote ahead
and that it is his best effort in life! :)

उत्तरोत्तरमुनीनां प्रमाणम् holds good only if it is a siddhAnta that
counters all other existent viewpoints after understanding them. Dvaitins
do not have a clue of what mithyAtva means as we have seen many times.
Their ridiculous arguments against AV based on the misunderstanding mithyA
has been refuted using their own choice of Nyaya tools by Siddhikara.
Therefore, we do not agree that Madhva, Ramanuja or any other mata is the
siddhAnta since it came later. AV alone is the siddhAnta. However, within
AV sampradAya itself, it could be said that uttarottaramunInAM pramANam
since one takes ones own guru's explanation of the various AV explanations
as the best interpretation, as long as it doesn't contradict the aikya.

Now then, the question would be: how is it that AV is the siddhAnta? Its
because its the only system that passes the test of six li~Ngas for
tAtparyanirNaya. Every other system fails it. In Chandogya, for example,
just taking the first लिङ्ग where उपक्रम shows the प्रतिज्ञा done was एकेन
ज्ञानेन सर्वं विज्ञातं भवति and ended with तत् त्वम् असि in उपसंहार, one
can see that aikya is the tAtparya of the Shruti. This first लिङ्ग itself
fails miserably in other philosophies.

As shown, it fails the basic test of finding the tAtparya of the Shruti,
so it is completely disagreeing with Vedas.

I love the example given by Swami Dayanandaji in this regard, wherein he
narrates a story of a Dvaitin who studied for 12 years and countered an
Advaitin. However, the conclusion is that Dvaitins study for several years
only to conclude what even an illiterate knows "I am different from
Ishvara".

What is the point of such study to learn what you know from birth that you
are limited entity different from an limitless Ishvara. There is no logic
necessary to establish dvaita, it is anubhava-siddha for all and therefore,
even Shruti is not a pramANa. Advaita has to be logically established and
Shruti becomes a pramANa for such aikya-jnAna.

What a start! It shows a complete misunderstanding of the terminology
mithyA used by AV. These kind of examples can be used only by Dvaitins
where the assumption is that the proof will be established by shocking the
reader. Some might think, "Oh, look Advaitins use abusive words for
Paramatma"! The fact is that by misunderstanding AV, the dvaitins call the
Bhagavan such names since they have no other sattA. We have different
sattAs and bhedA in vyavahArika sattA.

On a related note, if Dvatin's Ishvara is different from all types of
people and animals, then he is a limited Ishvara, which is itself against
the Vedas!

For us, from the pAramarthika sattA, where such expression is used, the
abusive words is also brahman/ Ishvara, the abuser is Ishvara, the abused
is Ishvara, abusing is Ishvara, all is Ishvara, where is the abuse then? I
can understand the Dvaitin's misery though: bhUmA vai sukhaM, na alpe
sukham asti.
