>  One more objection remembered after again reading your pramANa kArya :

One of the necessary conditions for a source of knowledge to be called a pramANa is that it should make things known that are not already known (anadhigata).

>  Advaitins strong belief is that Atman is aprameya and he is not pramANa siddha but svayaM siddha.  Under these circumstances how can,  for you shAstra is the untya pramANa when that pramANa itself not directly teaching you the prama of the prameya??  And as per your version, whatever shruti talks about Atman is apramANa only as you have already asserted that Atman is aprameya, so in short shruti is NOT at all talking about Atman and whatever it talks about karma, vidhi and lOkAntara karma phala (svargAdi lOka etc.) etc. is again avidyAtmaka in your understanding.  So ultimately shruti talking 'nothing' about karma and jnana hence it is nothing but shUnyavAda doctrine.  Perhaps this is the reason advaitins are being called as pracchanna bauddha-s.  

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
