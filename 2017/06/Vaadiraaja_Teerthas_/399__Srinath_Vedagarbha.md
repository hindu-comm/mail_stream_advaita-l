In one of your previous posting you gave this lion,dogs, dream example.
Thais is good but it is valid ONLY when you know it is a dream. The dogs
and lion themselves are not leading you to realize that they are all part
of the dream.

Think like this -- to start with we do not know prakriya of dogs leading to
a lion is a dream or not. This is the fair  starting point and I believe
you agree with me here. Now, such dogs and lion themselves are not telling
one way or the other. It could be real lion or could be dream lion. Your
knowledge is niShaya only after the fact. If you wake up on the bed then it
is a dream, otherwise it is indeed real lion!

So, given the fact that all we have bEdha and abEdha srutis and that is our
pramANa basis to start with. You cannot say bEdha vAkyas will lead to
abEdha jnAna definitively. It could be that advaita is the final verdict,
but we do not know yet till we wake up to that state. Preaching we will
wake up, is a forward looking statement and wishful thinking. It is like
claiming while dreaming we know that it is a dream and eventually we will
wake up!
