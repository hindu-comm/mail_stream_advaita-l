PraNAms
>From Vishishtaadviata point - Brahman does not have sajaatiand vijaatibhedaasbut it has swagatabhedas- the jiivajagat form organic relation with Brahman - like organs of the one total body. Brahman is still the material cause but creation involves subtle forms expressed as grosser forms.
For dvaitinsBrahman is not even material cause for the universe.
Just for info.

Venkat ji,

For dvaitins 'ekam Eva advitiyam' only means Brahman is sajatiya bheda
rahitam. Vijatiya world and jivas can coexist with Brahman.

regards
subbu


How does that explain the two eva-s in that sentence? - sadeva ... AsId
ekameva. The first eva rules out coexistence of vijAtIya entities along
with sat.

Best regards,
Vidyasankar
