To bring this discussion to a contemporary relevance, do read up on "false
memory syndrome" and how it is often a result of the so-called "recovered
memory therapy." Although our philosophical texts all more or less agree
that smRti can only be of things that have been actually experienced in the
past, there is mounting evidence that not only can the human recovery of a
past event be faulty in its process, but that a past event need not have
even taken place and yet people sometimes "recollect" a memory of something.
