That abAdhitArthabodhanaparatvam / anadhigatatvam is a key condition for
something to be a pramANa is something I am in agreement with. However, the
visheShaNa of anya pramANena in abAdhitArtha viShayatva lakshaNa is a bit
problematic as it leads to ativyApti in several instances, e.g. shukti
rajata jnAna. One sees shell silver first, and through pratyaksha itself
(ie not anya pramANa) viShaya bAdha happens.

In the strictest interpretation of this rule, the only pramANas are shruti
vAkyas that have Brahman as their viShayam, because their artha is
abAdhitam.
