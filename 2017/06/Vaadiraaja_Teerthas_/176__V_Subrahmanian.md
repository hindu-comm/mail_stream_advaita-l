Advaita has no problem with such shruti passages. We do not accept vikara
for Brahman but only vivarta. Ajaayamaano bahudhaa vijaayate. Purusha Eva
idam sarvam...Atmaivedam/Brahmaivedam sarvam, idam sarvam yadayamatma, etc.

When we say yad rajatam saa shuktih, it is baadhaayam saamaanaadhikaranyam.
The shell alone appears as silver. Brahman alone appears as everything. No
taratamya as uccha nicha etc. That is what the shve and cited paippalada
shrutis teach.
