Reg  << The
Candala, Mleccha, Jaara, Donkey, Monkey, Randaa Putra, Vidhava Putra are
all different and not same. Paramatma is also different from them.
Therefore abusive words will be for a particular person but not to
Paramatma. >>,



Advaitic stand is that all these terms really pertain to upadhis and not to
Atman/Brahman. Due to adhyAsa, they are wrongly attributed to
Atman/Brahman.
