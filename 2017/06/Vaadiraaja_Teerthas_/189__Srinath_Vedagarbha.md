Wrong.

What is anubhava siddha is you as a physical body (upaadi) is limited.
Without shruti you are not even aware there is such thing as atma/jiva
which is persist after death of your physical body. Otherwise science would
have accepted non-material chaitanya vastu long back.

So, my contention is that -- if you accept both 'I' and 'You' more than
bodies and jIva-s,  jIva-Isha bEdha is not anubhavasiddha at all, and known
only from veda. Hence your argument is wrong in denying bedha between them.

(on the side note -- if one wonder how dvaitins posit Ishvara-jaDa bEdha
using shruti, it would be for another day!)

As said above, anuyOgi is definitely not sidha without shruti.

When Ishvara is said to be shruti siddha, it always implied Ishavara's
laxaNa-s are also shruti siddha only. Since bEdha is dharmI-svarUpa,
Ishvara's bEdha from all other non-Isharava vastu-s are automatically
shruti siddha only.

Anyways, in your argument jIva is still assiddha from anubhava point of
view.

Whether shruti is pramANa is advaitajnAna or dvaitajnAna needs to be
evaluated on their own grounds. One cannot reject dvaitajnAna based on
wrong assumptions and predispositions.
