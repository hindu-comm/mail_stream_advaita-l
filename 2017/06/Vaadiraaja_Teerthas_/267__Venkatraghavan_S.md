Sri Anand ji,

Completely agree - that is pretty much what I had written yesterday.

Regards,
Venkatraghavan

One of the necessary conditions for a source of knowledge to be called a
pramANa is that it should make things known that are not already known
(anadhigata). What happens in this case can be examined in two phases. In
the phase before the dawn of Brahman knowledge, both abheda and bheda
shrutis are pramANas, since we are still in the vyAvahArika phase and there
is no sublation of vyAvahArika objects. After the dawn of Brahman
knowledge, *both* abheda and bheda shrutis, ie. the whole shruti itself,
becomes atattvAvedaka and ceases to be a pramANa, since it cannot make any
thing known that is not already known. So what I am saying is that we have
either a situation where 1) both bheda and abheda shrutis are tattvAvedaka
or where 2) both abheda and bheda shrutis are atattvAvedaka. The charge by
VAdirAja is that one type of shruti is tattvAvedaka and another is
atattvAvedaka, as per the advaitin. But as we have have seen, we will never
be in that situation.
