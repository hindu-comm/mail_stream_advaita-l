Yes, I agree Brahman is indeed *different* from vandyAputra.

Brahman being different from world irrespective of world is real or mithya,
is agreeable for both of us. There is no fight there.
The disagreement is about the very nature of this world itself, not its
difference from Brahman.

Dvaitins do not postulate world's existence based on the perceived
difference. It its other way in fact. The difference is known/registered
between this world and Brahman. While former is known from pratyksha and
the later by shruti.

For atheists, if you ask the same question -- they also agree difference
between this world and brahman. The only difference is while world is real
for them, Brahman is a fictitious concept as they do not accept vEda. This
is the bEdha between sat vastu and asat vatu type. For dvaitins, it is
bEdha between two sat padArthas.

The only difference we do not summon vandyAputra to be witness for a murder
case in the court unlike AV summons mithyA vEda to be evidence for Brahma
jnAna.

When I said no vyavahAra if we fail to recognize bEdha between sat and asat
vastus -- what I meant was that either sat vastus are tread same way as
asat vastus, or asat vastus are treated same sat ones.

An example might help -- say someone apply for PAN card for a vAndyaputra
and also for a real person. As a issuing authority if you fail to recognize
the difference between two applicant -- either you issue two PAN cards or
do not issue anything at all :)
