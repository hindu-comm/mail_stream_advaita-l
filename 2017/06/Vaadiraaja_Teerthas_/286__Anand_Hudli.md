MM Shri Sastri does not explain, but my guess is as follows. ajnAna of an
object has a correspondence with jnAna.  If I don't know a pot, my specific
ignorance is about the pot, but not another object, say cloth. When a
person says he/she is ignorant we may ask: "Ignorant of what?" The answer
to the question is the content of the ignorance, although I agree it could
be confused with the object itself. It could also be the case that ajnAna
could be general, not restricted to a specific object or specific set of
objects. In that case, the ignorance is in its primary form, ie. mUlAvidyA.
Both these cases have to be considered when we talk about pramANas, since a
pramANa, in general, must satisfy the condition of providing new knowledge
that removes ajnAna. There is also a reference to the siddhAnta-bindu
commentary which I will try to look into in the coming days.
