If so, then some questions that  arises are,


What is this knowledge (its lakshana) gained from Vedas ? Is it attained
through shravana itself or is it dependent on some other aspects (upAsana
etc leading to samAdhi ) to generate such a knowledge? If by shravana,
which vAkyas from Vedas can generate such knowledge ?

what is the phala of attaining such a knowledge while here, in this birth?

Does it result in the state of moksha, you have explained above?

Is such a moksha attainable by an embodied being, at the very onset of the
dawn of the knowledge (without any time gap
between the dawn of moksha knowledge and moksha experience) or it is
dependent on another entity (Ishvara) even after the gain of knowledge from
Vedas ?

what is this state of moksha, where one continues to know/experience the
multiplicity of objects (if everything exists as before and is experienced
as before) ?

how is such a moksha explained after attaining which, there is no return to
birth/death (samsAra ) as told in Bh. Gita ?
