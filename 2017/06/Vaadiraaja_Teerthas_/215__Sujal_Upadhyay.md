praNAms,

Shri Subbu ji says:

**In Dvaita there is a svarupa sharira for the jiva which will never cease
to
be and will continue in moksha. With that sharira which has mind, sense
organs, etc which is all chinmātra, the jiva will enjoy all sense pleasures
and engage in devotional practices in moksha. And that svarupa of the jiva
is atomic in size as per their doctrine.

What I have heard is that the Jiva, which is aNu (of atomic size) and it's
svarUpa with mind is abheda and advitiya or non-dual.

In case of dvaita's concept of moksha, jIva will have personality of male
or female. secondly they are bound in vaikuNTha so that they can stay in
intimacy of bhagavAn viShNu, serve his lotus feet eternally and be in
constant divine company of beloved bhagavAn viShNu. There is no vaikuNtha
on earth, it is a different specific place and has specific location, so I
use the word 'bound'. If it is infinite, then vaikuNTha is everywhere and
so there cannot be any travel to that place, just realization of that place
and so there cannot be any fall from that place.

I have also heard that no one from vaikuNTha ever falls back i.e. there is
no return to earth or any other kingdom. The case of jaya and vijaya is an
exception and had divine purpose, though some new ISKONites claim that one
can indeed fall from vaikuNTha citing example of jaya and vijaya, though
Srila Prabhupada himself didnt acknowledge the same.

Refer:

7.1.34-38

also also

http://vaniquotes.org/wiki/It_is_a_fact_that_no_one_falls_from_Vaikuntha

"Otherwise it is a fact that no one falls from Vaikuṇṭha. "

Coming back to the point, one cannot be a jivanmukta as per dvaita, as one
cannot return back from vaikuNTha.

Hari 
OM
