What Anand ji so nicely summed up is a reflection of the Bhashya:

Hence Shankara cites both the mantras in conjunction to conclude that the
abhāva of all these in the state of moksha, in the BSB 4.1.3:
 यदप्युक्तम् — अधिकार्यभावः प्रत्यक्षादिविरोधश्चेति, तदप्यसत् ,
प्राक्प्रबोधात् संसारित्वाभ्युपगमात् , तद्विषयत्वाच्च
प्रत्यक्षादिव्यवहारस्य ; ‘यत्र त्वस्य सर्वमात्मैवाभूत्तत्केन कं पश्येत्’
(बृ. उ. २ । ४ । १४)

Before dawn of right knowledge samsāritva is admitted and the perception
etc. pramanas operate there. Post-dawn of right knowledge, the shruti
teaches the abhāva of pratyaksha, etc. Then, in the absence of
pratyaksha,etc. pramanas, will not the contingency of the absence of shruti
arise? No, that is a desirable effect for the Vedantin for the shruti
itself has taught: then the father is no father, .....the vedas are no
vedas.

The 'yatra tvasya...' mantra negates the entire concept of 'pramana
(pramatr, prameya)' and hence even the shruti as pramana, pramā-karaṇam'
(not kāranam) ceases to be at that juncture. So,the question of applying
the lakshana for pramana does not arise at all owing to the lakshya vastu
itself not being there.
