does dvaitins accept Sruti as pramAna ?

praNAms 
Hare Krishna

Yes they very much do without any conditions like advaitins :-)  because for us there is a state where 'atra veda aveda :-) ...but according to them (dvaitins) these are all inappropriate quotes from shruti to substantiate that everything is brahman.  Because svagata bheda or savisheshatva of brahman like chandaala, bitch, youth, aged, stree, pum  etc. etc.  is not the Advaita cup of tea...as advaita  vehemently advocates nirvishesha, niravayava, nirAkAra and nirguNa brahman.  BTW, in vyavahAra when a person abusing other person with the abusive words like quoted, is not doing so with the brahma jnana that everything is brahman like Advaita paramArtha jnAni or sthita prajna (vidyA vinaya saMpanne braHmaNe gavi hastini......panditAH samadarshinaH)  ..these are all insulting words only aiming towards one person from another entirely different person :-)  

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
