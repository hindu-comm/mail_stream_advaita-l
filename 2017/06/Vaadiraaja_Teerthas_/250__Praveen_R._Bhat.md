​That is not true. We say that the Shruti has एक​वाक्यता in that all the
sentences of the Shruti have commitment in revealing oneness. Some
directly, being महावाक्यs and some indirectly, क्रमेण, being अवान्तरवाक्यs.
So this understanding/ argument of Vadiraja is also incorrect.

​He is also using the logic of convenience by selectively taking to
Advaita​ between both kANDas, while being a dvaitin. Why do they not use
the same logic and fix the fault of making only one deity as the greatest
and all other inferior then?

​And we do not disagree, but just as you can't teach your own son e=mc^2
when he is a child, so too the Shruti doesn't teach a child equation of
oneness till one grows using the karmakANDa.​

​​Its poetic alright, but that itself shows that to make dvaita appear as
the commitment of Shruti everywhere, Dvaitins ​are willing to interpret it
any which way by adding words, removing something, etc... and so the
following flaw applies to them and not us.

Here's the contradiction. ​If its yatArtha tattva, then it should not be
interpreted differently in order to make all statements mean the same as
suggested by the same author couple of verses back! The contradiction is
resolved by Advatins by showing that there is no contradiction at all since
the commitments are different and so are the goals. So who is killing the
Shruti really? Us who keep the Shruti as is or them who are suggesting
change and still calling it yathArtha?
