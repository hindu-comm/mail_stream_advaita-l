Adhyaropa-apavāda is considered as a laukika nyāya too:

https://sa.wikiquote.org/wiki/%E0%A4%85%E0%A4%A7%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%AF%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%B0%E0%A5%8B%E0%A4%AA%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%AA%E0%A4%B5%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%A6%E0%A4%A8%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%AF%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%AF%E0%A4%83


Shankara says while citing it as a part of a verse BGB 13.14:

उपाधिकृतं मिथ्यारूपमपि अस्तित्वाधिगमाय ज्ञेयधर्मवत् परिकल्प्य उच्यते
सर्वतःपाणिपादम् इत्यादि। *तथा हि संप्रदायविदां वचनम्* --
अध्यारोपापवादाभ्यां निष्प्रपञ्चं प्रपञ्च्यते इति।

That shows the concept is that which has been used by 'sampradāya vit-s'.

In this uttaragita bhashya of Gaudapada, this nyaya is used:

In day to day life too this nyaya is used.  During Ganapati puja, the idol
is purchased from the shop and the prānapratishtha, etc. is done to
'infuse' daivatva in it.  To this idol worship is offered, naivedya is
given and prayers are made for ishtārthasiddhi. Then the visarjana is done
and the daivatva is 'removed' from it and the idol is disposed of in one or
the other way.

The concept is used by every mother of every culture: gumma is the best
example of this. Purandara dasa has composed two songs: one for adhyaropa
(gummana kareyadire) and the other for apavada (gummanelliha toramma).
