How is that it is your knowledge 'I am different from Ishvara' is
anubhava-siddha ?  Is Ishvara in your anubhava? Unless you know pratiyOgi,
you cannot know the difference between anuyOgi and pratiyOgi.

Since Ishvara is only knowable from shruti, dvaita jnyAna (of jIvESha
bhEda) is shruti pratipAdya only. Otherwise there would not be any atheists
in the world.

Sorry to say that Sri.Dayananda Sarswati is missed this basic understanding
and hence misunderstood Dvaita Siddhanta.
