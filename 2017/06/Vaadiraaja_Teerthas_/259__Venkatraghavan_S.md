However, it is also clear
that advaitins do not state there is an atattvAvedaka pramANa in the Veda,
as alleged by VAdirAja. If they had indeed stated that a part of the Veda
is atattvAvedaka while another part is tattvAvedaka there would have been
shrutahAni surely, but they did not. advaitins do agree that every shruti
is tattvAvedaka, although the tattva that it conveys could be vyAvahArika
or pAramArthika.


Namaste Sri Anand ji,
Re the above, Sri vAdirAja's question is if the pramANa viShaya is
vyAvahArikam, it is by definition bAdhyam upon brahma jnAna. pramANa
according to advaitins is abAdhitArtha viShayatvam, so by definition, all
the shruti vAkya that have vyAvahArika vastu as their viShaya are not
pramANas. This point by vAdirAja is valid in my opinion, but is not a
problem for advaita.
Regards,
Venkatraghavan
