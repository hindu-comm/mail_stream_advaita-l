So also atheists do not accept there is such thing as 'jIva' which lives on
after death. Your argument is wrong assuming athiest's notion of limitation
is same as dvaitin's position of limitedness of jIva.

You think jIva's existence is material occupancy like box in a box.
vastu-paricchedatva vAda is wrong. It may apply if terms involved are
physical in nature and they cannot occupy same space at the same time.
Don't you know when a person die, nothing physical is lost?


Why would jIva's existence make Ishwara is not infinite? He is infinite *in
spite of* existence of jIv. That HIS aiShwarya!

When you advaitins yourself do accept simultaneous existence of Ishavara
and jIva (albeit in vyavahaara), why are you denying jIva's existence based
on illogical vastu-paricchedatva argument?
