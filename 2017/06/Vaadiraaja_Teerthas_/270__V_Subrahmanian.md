Dear Bhaskar ji,

Your nicely articulated question has been answered by Shankara in the
ārambhaṇādhikaraṇa bhashya: tadanyatvammm. BSB 2.1.14:

 तस्मात्प्राग्ब्रह्मात्मताप्रतिबोधादुपपन्नः सर्वो लौकिको वैदिकश्च व्यवहारः
— यथा सुप्तस्य प्राकृतस्य जनस्य स्वप्ने उच्चावचान्भावान्पश्यतो निश्चितमेव
प्रत्यक्षाभिमतं विज्ञानं भवति प्राक्प्रबोधात् , न च
प्रत्यक्षाभासाभिप्रायस्तत्काले भवति, तद्वत् । कथं त्वसत्येन वेदान्तवाक्येन
सत्यस्य ब्रह्मात्मत्वस्य प्रतिपत्तिरुपपद्येत ? न हि रज्जुसर्पेण दष्टो
म्रियते ; नापि मृगतृष्णिकाम्भसा पानावगाहनादिप्रयोजनं क्रियत इति । नैष दोषः,
शङ्काविषादिनिमित्तमरणादिकार्योपलब्धेः, स्वप्नदर्शनावस्थस्य च
सर्पदंशनोदकस्नानादिकार्यदर्शनात् । तत्कार्यमप्यनृतमेवेति चेद्ब्रूयात् ,
अत्र ब्रूमः — यद्यपि स्वप्नदर्शनावस्थस्य सर्पदंशनोदकस्नानादिकार्यमनृतम् ,
तथापि तदवगतिः सत्यमेव फलम् , *प्रतिबुद्धस्याप्यबाध्यमानत्वात् *; *न हि
स्वप्नादुत्थितः स्वप्नदृष्टं सर्पदंशनोदकस्नानादिकार्यं मिथ्येति
मन्यमानस्तदवगतिमपि मिथ्येति मन्यते कश्चित् ।*

Someone may kindly give a gist of the above so that in case Sri Bhaskar ji
is not able to view the above lines in his system, it will help him.

Thanks and regards
subbu
