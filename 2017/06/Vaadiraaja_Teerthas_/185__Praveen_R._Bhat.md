Since limitedness is anubhavasiddha and Shruti says Ishvara is limitless. I
don't need Shruti to tell me I am limited and therefore, it is
anubhavasiddha and therefore my knowledge. I knew I am limited even before
Shruti telling me of a limitless Ishvara. Even without Shruti, if someone
were to tell me that there is a mathematical possibility of inifinity, I
know I am not infinite by anubhava.

Is Ishvara in your anubhava?

No, Shruti is the pramANa for Ishvara.

Once you know of the pratiyogi from Shruti, I don't need it to tell me
the difference between anuyogi and pratiyogi.

There is a difference in saying that Shruti is a pramANa for Ishvara
versus saying that Shruti is a pramANa for difference between jIva and
Ishvara the way you say it and the way we say it that Shruti is a pramANa
for both, Ishvara and jIveshvaraikya.

I'd made a separate paragraph to indicate my conclusion, not Swamiji's.
Sorry that you missed it. However, Swamiji's conclusion was no different,
since he taught that Vedanta Shruti is a pramANa for advaitajnAna, it
couldn't have been a pramANa for dvaitajnAna as well. Yet, lets drop
Swamiji from the conversation please.
