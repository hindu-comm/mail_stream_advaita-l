I was simply responding to your statement that the word nirguNa must be
interpreted as an expression of an attribute or a descriptive property of
brahman. It doesn't matter whether that comes from a rAmAnujIya perspective
or an AnandtIrthIya one.

Like I've had occasion to say before, nice try! :) What exactly is meant by
a "pramANa platform?" Whether AV or any other V, we all use buddhi to
understand and interpret the vedavAkya-s. Unlike other V's, we don't bother
resorting to extraneous texts. That is the key difference between AV and
others.

adhyAropa-apavAda is not a "technique" or "framework" imposed by us upon
Sruti from outside. It is simply a descriptor of how Sruti and smRti
themselves consistently handle the issue of One vs. Many. It is a
descriptor of why Sruti and smRti often list diametrically opposite terms
when talking about brahman - aNurbRhat, aNoraNIyAn mahato mahIyan,
dUre-atyantike, jyeshTha-kanishTha-madhyama-pUrvaja-aparaja, ajAyamAno
bahudhA vijAyate etc. It arises naturally when we see that Sruti says so
much about brahman, including 'hRdA manIshA manasAbhikLptaH" and then also
tells us, "yato vAco nivartante, aprApya manasA saha."

Best regards,
Vidyasankar
