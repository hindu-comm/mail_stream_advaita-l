Advaita's anupalabdhi is not of the above nature. It is called
yogyānupalabdhi: only that object which is a candidate for pratyaksha can
be a candidate for anupalabdhi. Asat vastu does not qualify for anupalabdhi
pramana. In fact it is not at all a prameya in order for a pramana to
operate in its perception.
