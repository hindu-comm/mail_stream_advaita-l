Shruti is pramana with regard to Brahman by teaching what Brahman is
not  atadvyavṛttirūpeṇa prāmāṇyam shruteḥ. . And the mahavakya is required
to generate that vritti jnanam that destroys avidya.

The above is a complete wrong understanding of advaita, as usual. karma,
vidhi, etc. are all known only by shruti pramana since they are not known
otherwise. This is required in the vyavaharika realm where there are
seekers of other purusharthas and for mumukshus to attain chitta shuddhi by
engaging in karma yoga.  The Lord in BG 6th chapter teaches that the yoga
bhrashta will go to punya loka-s and return to this loka to continue his
sadhana. In the 8th chapter the shukla and krshna margas are taught for
those who die without atma jnana. All these are instances of a Jnani for
whom everything is mithya, still using the shruti pramana to guide
aspirants.
