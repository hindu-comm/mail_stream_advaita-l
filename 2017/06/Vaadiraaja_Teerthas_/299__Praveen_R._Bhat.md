Does this indicate the series of vRttis in seeing any object? For example,
if I keep looking at a ghaTa, there is a ghaTa-vRtti which is momentary,
but another momentary ghaTa-vRtti follows it which is exactly the same in
space, but with a little difference in time, and so on. Are these series of
cognitions considered as a single cognition without the role of smRRiti?

Kind rgds,
