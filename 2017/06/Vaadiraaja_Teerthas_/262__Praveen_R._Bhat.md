​True, same pramANa can also negate it. anya can be taken as English any
then :)

I agree with what you intend to say, but I'm not sure if this is the best
example, since one still sees silver from the distance. He just uses
anumAna that it is not so.

Of course, abAdhitatva is assumed in all pramANas.​

Could you please quote where such interpretation is given? I am afraid that
not only bhedashruti but other five pramANas will also cease to be pramANas
and one won't be able to even interpret the Shrutis with such apramANa
means. Their validity has to be necessarily accepted in vyavahAra and
pramANa definition has to be the same for all six.
