This is laughable and beyond ridiculous. vitaNDavAda is what it is, since
I'm sure Vadiraja is not ignorant of Shruti vAkyas of nirguNabrahma! He is
comparing apples and oranges. I'm shocked that it is a well-respected work
in Dvaita!

Anyway, it just confirms that Dvaitins do not even care to understand the
Tattvabodha of AV.



Kind rgds,
