That one is dependent on someone else is common for the atheist and the
jiva. It is well known that the atheist does not accept a dehātirikta jiva.
That is not a point of contention her at all.

It is not like a box in a box. That is why the vastu paricchedatva is
admitted as distinct from desha and kāla paricchedatva. Even ākāśa, though
desha pariccheda rahita, is admitted as kāla paricchinna since it is
produced and also vastu paricchinna since it is differently counted from
vayu, etc.

Advaitins accept the difference based on upadhis and hence that is not a
problem. But when the upadhis are negated there is no bhedaka to show the
two are different. The persistence of vastu paricchedatva between Ishwara
and jiva is ishṭa in vyavahara.
