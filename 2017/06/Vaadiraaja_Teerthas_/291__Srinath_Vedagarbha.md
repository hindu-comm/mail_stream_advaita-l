That is fine as far as memory being not valid pramANa. But my question is
specifically about whether it  is valid knowledge (pramA) or not.

Form your articulation it seems -- since memory is not a valid pramANa
(means of knowledge), it implies knowledge gained from such means is also
not a valid knowledge (pramA). Is that correct?

My understanding is that validity of knowledge is tightly coupled with
means of knowledge. If the means is invalid, the knowledge must be invalid
as well.
