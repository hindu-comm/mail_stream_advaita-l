Thanks for that interesting insight.
 To make that statement, we can fairly assume that such bhedaH is
knowable. How can existence of bhedaH with a non-existent pratiyogin be
known until the non-existence of the pratiyogin is known?
If it cannot be
, then the
refutation of the absurdity of the bhedaH with non-existent pratiyogin
would not be much different from Ch. Up.
6.2.1 mantra
and especially the bhAShya 
refuting asadevedamagra AsI
dekamevAdvitIyam.

In any case, it has no purpose as you mentioned, even compared to
kAkadantaparIkShA.

Kind rgds,
