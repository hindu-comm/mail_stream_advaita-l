It is only AV's paxa that asat cannot be known 'asat chEt na pratIyata'.


It only  means asat does not become cognized. We have the yoga sutra
'shabda jnananupaati vastu shunyo vikalpah' to explain asatvastu. So the
rest of what you  say below is not about  advaita.

VS

Dvaitins do not subscribe to that position. Both sat and asat (or bhAva and
abhAva) can be known using all three pramANa-s.

Madhva's argument on AV is that -- if AV's position is that asat cannot be
known ( this is part of sat chEt na bAdhita asat chEta na pratIyata) , then
how do the posit the bEdha from asat in their definition of
sadAsadvilaxaNaM for this world?  The vilaxaNattvaM (difference) cannot be
known unless pratiyOgi asat is known. But by AV's definition asat is
unknowable, yet vilaxaNattvaM is porsulated. That is the issue raised.

This is not an issue for Dvaitins, for asat is knowable just as sat vastu.
In case of vandyAputra it is known because of contradiction of terms used.
In the case of shashashringa, it is known so because lack of pratyaksha to
be other way (anupalabdhi in your case)
