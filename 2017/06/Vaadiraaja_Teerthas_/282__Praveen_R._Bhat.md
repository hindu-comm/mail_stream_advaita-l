Incorrect or misunderstood since this was explained earlier in this very
thread. bhedashruti is not bhedaparashruti in the sense of revealing
duality but shruti that goes along with anubhavasiddhabheda to reveal
objects unknown. In the sense of leading to abheda, it is abhedapara, but
krameNa. Therefore, it is pramANa for things not known by other five means
of knowledge.

Yes.

jnAna?

No.

Not contradictory at all, since former has has shruti as pramANa

while latter has anubhava as pramANa.

No, the conclusion is after studying both kANDas of the Shruti.

True.

It is pramANa, has prAmANya as a whole, the short-term goals

being different, long-term goals being one and the same, and that too of
oneness.

All vAdas are based on perspectives and therefore, substantiated so. If
Dvaitins agree that there is an Atma separate from the body, mind, senses
and objects, and really unaffected by the miseries of the body, etc, then
they already agree to Paramarthika. Its just that they are selective in not
calling it a separate reality. Moreover, the division is Shruti-based, not
created by Advaitins.
