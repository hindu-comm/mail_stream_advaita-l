Any knowledgeable ones, pl share the exact ref ?


Ø   Yes, it is better to check exact words in that bhAshya bhAga


Here he clarifies most of the jnAni -jeeva-s would get merged themselves in brahman  (like clean water merging with clean water) as soon as they exhaust the prArabdha.  But some special jnAni-jeeva-s like apAntaratama would take the next janma with the remnants of their prArabdha  (as vyAsa) as per the instruction of paramAtma.  So, here contextually we have to understand there is a difference among ordinary jnAni, special jnAni and paramAtma and there will be a dialogue between paramAtma and these special jeeva-s to fulfill the particular cause in srushti etc.

Even if such a difference is admitted (vyavahAra), it is never from tattva dRSTi..where Brahman alone eternally is ..ekam eva adviteeyam


Ø   If I remember right the talk is about post jnana period, where some ordinary jnAni jeeva-s merge themselves in brahman and some other special jeeva-s would remain there to follow the paramAtman’s instructions.  IMO it is not vyAvahAra where dvaita admitted,  it is ‘after’ attaining the svarUpa jnana, after pancha bhUta-s getting merged in tanmAtra-s, after the physical death of these ordinary / special  jnAni-s and more importantly talks about ‘paramArtha jnAni-s punarjanma.

 Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
