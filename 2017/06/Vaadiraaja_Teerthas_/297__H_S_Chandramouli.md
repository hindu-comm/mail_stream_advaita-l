“mounting evidence” here pertains only to the current life, not those of
previous lives. Whereas the statement



<< our philosophical texts all more or less agree
that smRti can only be of things that have been actually experienced in the
past>>,



the past covers “all” the previous lives.



Thus the two are not comparable.
