//By the way, the same upanishat passage also says, in the same context, atra
pitA apitA. Kindly exert the might of your logic to show why pitA is also a
"verb."//


Leaving aside the question of verbs, can't we interpret this passage in the following dvaita-friendly way -

In the state of moksha -

1. Vedas do not give any new knowledge to the mukta because the mukta already got all the knowledge that he/she could absorb from the vedas. Thus vedas have no further utility *as vedas* to the mukta.

2. A father is no longer a father, as the bonds with all his past children have been dissolved due to moksha and only his bond with the dvaitic brahman remains.

Interpreted in this way, these statements do not imply a sublation of the world. However, what problems can come up with the above kind of interpretation of these statements?  

Regards
Kalyan
