praNAms Sri Srinath Vedagarbha prabhuji
Hare Krishna

Also it is illogical in the way that when vedas are said to be sublatable
in mOksha, why they are still continue to exist now? Does it mean nobody in
AV sampradAya ever attained mOxa so far?

>  Though Sri VidyA prabhuji has taken your objection jokingly and unwilling  to address your objection.  Shankara in sUtra bhAshya in another context clarifies your objection.  Here the context is discussion about jagat is avidyA srushti or the avidyA Shakti is the upAdAna kAraNa for the jagat and for this avidyA or avidyA Shakti the custodian is an individual jeeva.  Shankara here clarifies there is no punarjanma to mukta-s since by the jnana their avidyA beeja Shakti would be burnt to ashes.  (muktANAm punaranutpattiH vidyayA tasyA beejashkterdAhAt.  So, one of those muktA-s would have burnt that avidyA beeja Shakti through his jnana as a result the jagat should not have been there since it's beeja Shakti itself burnt to ashes but still we are seeing jagat even after a mukta burnt the avidyA beeja shakti.  That means avidyA beeja Shakti is not the upAdAna kAraNa for this jagat it is something else and that something else is Shakti of Shakta which is nothing different from Shakta.  So, veda would continue to exist as veda only even after one mukta realizes that atra veda avedAH because vedA-s are not the avidyA srushti of an ajnAni.  

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
