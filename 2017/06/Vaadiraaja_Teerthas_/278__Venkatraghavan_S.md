Thank you Subbuji. Copying the group so that everyone can benefit from your
message. It is through sattvam (the mind) that sattvam (the guNa) is
transcended.

Regards,
Venkatraghavan

Thank you Venkat ji, for this piece from the Brahmānandī. There is the
'mahāmantra' in this regard from none other than Lord Krishna Himself in
the BG 18.48:

सहजं कर्म कौन्तेय
सदोषमपि न त्यजेत् ।
सर्वारम्भा हि दोषेण
धूमेनाग्निरिवावृताः ॥ ४८ ॥

Shankara comments for the crucial part of the verse: सर्वारम्भाः आरभ्यन्त
इति आरम्भाः, सर्वकर्माणि इत्येतत् ; प्रकरणात् ये केचित् आरम्भाः स्वधर्माः
परधर्माश्च, ते सर्वे हि यस्मात् — त्रिगुणात्मकत्वम् अत्र हेतुः —
त्रिगुणात्मकत्वात् दोषेण धूमेन सहजेन अग्निरिव, आवृताः । सहजस्य कर्मणः
स्वधर्माख्यस्य परित्यागेन परधर्मानुष्ठानेऽपि दोषात् नैव मुच्यते ; भयावहश्च
परधर्मः । न च शक्यते अशेषतः त्यक्तुम् अज्ञेन कर्म यतः, तस्मात् न त्यजेत्
इत्यर्थः ॥

The idea is whatever action, whether for remaining in samsāra or for giving
up samsāra, there is no way 'action' is free of doṣa, defect. The action
for remaining in samsāra is rajasic and the other one is sāttvic, yet both
belong to the triguṇātmika māyā, which is itself the 'mahā doṣa' something
that has to be transcended. So, even the action involving using the mind,
for dvaitin or advaitin, is inevitable for transcending samṣara. And this
antahkaranam, the mahavakya of the veda, deśa,  kāla, etc. when / where the
saattvik act of attempting to grasp the Brahmajnānam, all are products of
maya, avidya, prakriti (BG 13.5,6) and hence doṣayukta. Yet that is the
only way one can rise above maya: through sattva. Sattvāt sanjyāte jnānam
is another Gita tenet and jnānān muktiḥ is also from the Gita.
