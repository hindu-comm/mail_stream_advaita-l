We can answer this taking two pakshas
1) One is to say that there is no division between tattvAvedaka and
atattvAvedaka shruti. What is tattvAvedakam? - teaching about a thing which
is tAttvika. Teaching about a thing which is atAttvika is atattvAvedakam.

To an unrealised person, both the bheda shruti and abheda shruti are
tAttvika only. To a realised person there is no veda or the world, so where
is the teaching? veda has no vedakatva for such a person. So there is
neither tattvAvedakatvam or attattvAvedakatvam for such a person. Here too
there is no division between the two.

2) Second paksha is to agree that there is a tattvAvedaka portion and
atattvAvedaka portion. In this paksha, the advaitin would say that all veda
sentences that teach about Brahman are the only portions that are tAttvika,
everything else is atAttvika. Here, the question becomes who makes this
distinction? Is it the advaitin or shruti?
The point to be noted here is - that there is an attattvAvedaka portion of
the veda is known only from the veda itself, it is not something that the
advaitin dreamt up - because after having elaborately prescribed karma in
karmakANDA, it is the veda that denies that karma is means to paramArtha
through portions like "na karmaNA, na prajayA", "nAsti akrita: kritena"
etc. Further, it is the veda itself that denies the satyatva of the world
through sentences like "neha nAnAsti kinchana".

Can the advaitin be held to account for upholding what the shruti says?

However, even if there is an atattvAvedaka portion, so what? Our contention
is that shruti does not teach dvaitam, nor does it have to. That is
pratyaksha and anubhava grAhyam. On the other hand, shruti is only
prescribing rituals, having presupposed a pratyaksha grAhya dvaita
satyatvam. That is, shruti does not teach dvaitam, it teaches *about*
karma, which presupposes dvaitam.  There is a difference between the two -
so long as the presupposition, ie pratyaksha grAhya satyatva, is taken as
true, those rituals have meaning. When shruti bodhita pAramArthika satyatva
is realised, there is no kartA, karmA or jagat.

It is a funny situation here. Advaitis want to embrace Dvaita and Dvaitis

This line of argument is rich coming from a dvaitin.

By taking into account the two orders of reality for the two sections of
the veda, it is us, the advaitins, that protect the prAmANya of veda. It is
only when you fail to take these as two different orders of reality, ie
only if you hold that there is only one sattA, will jnAna kANDA and karma
kANDA be in contradiction and such an objection would be valid. However,
this would rebound on the dvaitin itself because either he holds on to
jagat satyatvam, making jnAna kANDa aprAmANyam, or he protects jnAna kANDA
prAmANyam, but in doing so, he gives up jagat satyatvam, leading to dvaita
hAni.

Teekaakaara is saying here this is accepted by Advaitis also. त्वयापि

If we say the veda teaches an atAttvika thing as tAttvika, or a tAttvika
thing as atAttvika, only then you can say we are causing shruti to have
aprAmANyam. However, we say that shruti says a tAttvika thing (Brahman) is
satyam, and atAttvika thing is mithyA. So where is the aprAmANyam here?

This is a viShama drishTAnta, because here bheda shruti and abheda shruti
are not in contradiction - one is speaking of vyAvahArika satya and the
other is talking of pAramArthika satya.

Actually, vAdirAja is talking about a mImAmsa principle - when there are
two rules (rule 1 and rule 2) that can be applied, and we are wondering
which rule to apply in two places (place A and place B). If Rule 1 can be
applied in both A and B, and Rule 2 can only be applied in A, then the
mImAmsa maxim is apply Rule 2 in A, and Rule 1 in B.

If you had applied Rule 1 in A, then Rule 2 would be rendered useless.
Therefore to save Rule 2 from being rendered useless (nirvakAsha), apply
the maxim so that both rules are applied (sAvakAsha). vAdirAja is saying if
you accept abheda shruti then bheda shruti will be rendered niravakAsha,
and therefore to make it sAvakAsha, you have to interpret abheda in abheda
shruti so that bheda is not rendered niravakAsha.

To this we say, not so, because bheda shruti is not rendered niravakAsha -
it is very much accepted so long as one is in vyavahAra - it is only denied
in parmArtha, but in that instance the entire veda is left behind,
including advaita shruti. The sAvakAsha - niravakAsha principle can only be
applied if the veda has any relevance to the issue in question. So long as
vyavahAra exists, both bheda and abheda shruti are sAvakAsha, when in
paramArtha, the very necessity of a pramANa is removed, so the question of
the application of sAvakAsha-niravakAsha principle is rendered moot.
