Dear friends, Please permit me to share the following mantra from Kathopanishad and Sri Shankara's commentary on it.

 uttiShThata jAgrata 
 prApya varAn nibOdhata || Kathopanishad 1-3-14 Arise! Awake! Approach the great and learn.

Sri Shankara's commentary for the above mantra:
taddarShanArtham, anAdyavidyAprasuptAH uttiShThata, hE jantavaH Atmaj~JAnABimukhA Bavata | jAgrata aj~JAnanidrAyAH GOrarUpAyA darvAnarthabIjaBUtAyAH kShayaM kuruta | katham? prApya upagamya varAn prakRuShTAnAcAryAn, tattvavidaH tadupadiShTaM 
sarvAntarAtmAnam "ahamasmi" iti nibodhata avagacCata | na hi upEkSitavyam-iti SrutiH anukampayA Aha mAtRuvat||

Translation the above by Swami Gambhirananda :
 You creatures, who are sleeping in ignorance that has no beginning uttiShThata, arise, turn towards the knowledge of the Self; jAgrata, awake--put an end to the sleep of ignorance which is terrible by nature, and is the seed of all evil. How to put an end to it? prApya, approaching; varAn, the adorable ones, the excellent teachers--who know that Self; nibOdhata, learn-understand the all-pervading Self, taught by them, as 'I am that'. The Upanishad says out of compassion, like a mother.
 OM TAT SATI Thank all the friends.
With warm and respectful namaskars,Sreenivasa Murthy
