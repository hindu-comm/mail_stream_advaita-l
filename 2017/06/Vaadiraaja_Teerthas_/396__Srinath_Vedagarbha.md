Why not? pratiyogin vandyAputra is already **known** to be non-existing. It
is already known because of contradiction in shabda prayOga (putra of
barren woman).

In general, for any bEdha to be known, you need to have knowledge about
both anuyogin and pratiyogin. Same example...until you know what is xyz,
you neither deny nor assert between mango and xyz. The xyz could be sat or
atyanta asat, nevertheless it has to be known so.
