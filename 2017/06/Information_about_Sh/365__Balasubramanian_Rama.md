Shanti mantras are more than just for upaniShads. This is known from the
relevant sutras or tradition. For example, udakashanti mantras are
enumerated by Bhagavan Bodhayana. In the Krishna Yajur Veda, the AraNyaka
prashnas have a shAnti mantra at the beginning and the end. The upaniShads
are part of the AraNyaka. For the Krishna yajur veda there is no R^iShi or
chhandas. The devata is known through traditional interpretations. There is
a kANDa R^iShi, but that's different.
