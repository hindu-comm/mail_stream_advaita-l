I think this view is not logical: The verse says:
ऋषिभिर्बहुधा गीतं छन्दोभिर्विविधैः पृथक् ।
ब्रह्मसूत्रपदैश्चैव हेतुमद्भिर्विनिश्चितैः ॥ ४ ॥

The word 'geetam' is in the past tense and is applicable to all the
components in the verse: ..sung by rṣis, sung by the veda-s and sung by the
brahmasutra-words endowed with reasoning that leads to certitude of
knowledge. It would be odd for Krishna to be saying about a yet to be
composed work, that the yāthātmya of kshetra and kshetrajna has 'been sung'
by brahmasūtra words. This verse, according to Shankara, is a stuti of the
yāthātmya  that is going to be detailed in the sequel.

The term Vedāntakṛt is about Brahman (Krishna) when he says this about
himself. On the other hand, the brahmasūtra text is composed by Veda
Vyasa.

If one were to take the 'event' reported above that 'having established the
knowledge for the benefit of all including
Brahma, Rudra, etc.,' we have contradictions from the Shruti.  There are
several Upanishads where Brahmā and Rudra are Jnani-s. For example the
Mundakopanishat starts thus:

ब्रह्मा देवानां प्रथमः सम्बभूव विश्वस्य कर्ता भुवनस्य गोप्ता ।
स ब्रह्मविद्यां सर्वविद्याप्रतिष्ठामथर्वाय ज्येष्ठपुत्राय प्राह ॥ १ ॥

1 Om. Brahma, the Maker of the universe and the Preserver of the world, was
the first among the devas. He told His eldest son Atharva about the
Knowledge of Brahman, the foundation of all knowledge.

Shankara says about Brahmā the teacher of Brahmavidyā in this Upanishad:

ब्रह्म परिबृढो महान् धर्मज्ञानवैराग्यैश्वर्यैः सर्वानन्यानतिशेत इति ;
देवानां द्योतनवतामिन्द्रादीनां प्रथमः गुणैः प्रधानः सन् , प्रथमः अग्रे वा

इति
विशेषणात् ।

Brahmā has been stated to be the creator of the world and the protector
thereof - with a view to eulogise the vidyā that is going to be taught
here. If he were to be someone who has learnt the Brahmavidya with the help
of Brahmasutras in order to be able to teach it to others, the above
Upanishad/event will have to be deemed to have been composed 'after' the
composition of the Brahmasutra-s.

Same with the 8th chapter of the Chandogya where Prajāpati teaches the
Vidya to Indra. This chapter, if the story cited by you were to be taken
literally, will have to be held to be composed and inserted in the
Chandogya after Prajapati got enlightened after studying the Brahmasutras.

We have the Shvetāśvataropaniṣat teaching:

अजात इत्येवं कश्चिद्भीरुः प्रपद्यते ।
रुद्र यत्ते दक्षिणं मुखं तेन मां पाहि नित्यम् ॥ २१ ॥

In his helplessness an aspirant looks to God for help and protection,
seeing that He is unborn, i.e. the only being that is not subject to
samsāra and therefore capable of helping individual souls out of it. He
submits to Rudra: With your benevolent face protect me forever.



एको हि रुद्रो न द्वितीयाय तस्थु -
र्य इमांल्लोकानीशत ईशनीभिः ।
प्रत्यङ् जनास्तिष्ठति सञ्चुकोचान्तकाले
संसृज्य विश्वा भुवनानि गोपाः ॥ ॥ 3.2

यो देवानां प्रभवश्चोद्भवश्च
विश्वाधिपो रुद्रो महर्षिः ।
हिरण्यगर्भं जनयामास पूर्वं
स नो बुद्ध्या शुभया संयुनक्तु ॥ ॥ 3.4

One will have to hold that the Shvetashvataropanishat has been composed
after Rudra became enlightened by the use of Brahmasutras of Bādarāyana.

Similar situation will have to be admitted with regard to the Atharvaśikhā,
Atharvaśirā, Kaivalyopanishat, etc. where the Para Brahman, the
Jagatkāraṇam, is Rudra.

On the other hand, Shankara, as sampled in the Mundaka bhashya cited above,
in all places where there is a background story/event/conversation between
individuals, says that it is a stuti for the Vidya that is taught.

On the other hand, going by the above facts and the consequences listed,
the skānda and the nārāyaṇa samhitā episodes are rendered weak in the face
of the Shruti prabala pramāṇa. These episodes are at best arthavāda-s,
stuti-s, as Shankara has pointed out. A stuti, as per purva mimamsa, finds
place in the sannidhi of a vidhi. The vidhi here is the teaching and
securing the brahmavidya for moksha.
