I have a photocopy of this book. Let me know the verses for which you want pages. I will scan them and send it to you. 

If you are in the US, this book is available in one of the libraries. I got this via ILL and photocopied two decades ago. You should be able to get it via ILL (inter library loan) from any US library as well.

 You can try the following link

 << https://archive.org/details/AnandaSagaraStavam
 >>.

 Different
 download options are available. I found the PDF option is
 more
 readable than the PDF with Text option
 for which I had given the link
 earlier.
