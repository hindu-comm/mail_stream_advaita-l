Dear Friends, The two most important things in life are when one is born & one person finds out that why he has borned. The perfect answer to this 'Celibacy'. The Truth is dynamic, governs every process un-winding in the universe which I will explain by taking one example. When some one resonate with Truth, we will do our duty as Dharma and can collaborate with divine work as Professor said, then there will be a way to love in freedom & harmony.
It is the swami viekananda who declared the great saint of Bengal 'RamaKrishna Paramahansa' that he is my Thakur = Master = Mother & everything and for him no body is there except him, it is Truth. Once it happened that Ramakrishna lifted Vivekananda to higher level (3-dimensional place) for a space walk, then the disciple could not understand what the Master was doing, Is it really required?.Although it is not necessary that the disciple know what the master was doing, then he used his discrimination power which his chitta by following the Prakritika niyama, he ordered a probe to reveal the facts . If the disciple wants to become master, then he has to face the master & vice versa holds good.
