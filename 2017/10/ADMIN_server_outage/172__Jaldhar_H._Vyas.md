The website and mailing list have been intermittently up and (mostly) down 
the past day or two as our server was under attack by Chinese hackers.

Things should be back to normal now but there may be some backlog remaining 
to be processed.  if you sent a message and it has not appeared, please 
wait a day to see if it shows up before resending.
