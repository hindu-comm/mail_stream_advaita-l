Advaita - explained by the Jagadguru in Tamil

The YouTube link given  below by Sri Sriram to the talks on Vedanta are in
Tamil. The set is an excellent exposition of the Vedanta as per
Bhagavatpada's Bhashya.  The talks, almost all of them, were brought out in
an English rendering in two books:

World and God

Emancipating Enlightenment

These are apparently available at the Book Stall at Sringeri and other
places.
