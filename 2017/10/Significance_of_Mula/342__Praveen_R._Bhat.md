Although we have gone down this road before, I'll still mention
Naishkarmyasiddhikara's view that brahman's jIvatvam being due to avidyA,
the kArya (jIva) cannot precede the kAraNa (avidyA), and therefore, jIva
cannot be the locus of avidyA. If brahman is taken as the locus of avidyA,
the objection is that there will be dvaita, but it is refuted by stating
that the level of reality of yat-kinchid-bhAva-rUpa-avidyA and brahman are
not the same.

It remains in bijAvasthA, seed-form in suShupti.
