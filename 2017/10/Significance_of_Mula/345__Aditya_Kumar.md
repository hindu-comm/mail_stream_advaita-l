If there is such a view, it has been refuted by Bhashyakara in Chandogya 6th chapter, where he says that the person in deep sleep would become mukta in such a case [and thereby have no reason to wake up at all].​
A : Hahaha. That's so true.​
​I'll let the Bhamati objections be, since all those are already answered in Naishkarymasiddhi. Although I subscribe to Vivarana, I have no issues with Bhamati, since I consider that both prakriyAs resolve doubts for those who have them, being very well convinced that all objections in either prakriyA (or both) will stand resolved for one who follows it with commitment, but a thorough study with more sub-commentaries on sub-commentaries may be needed. That is to say, to each his own; whatever works for one to move onward from manana proper.
A : That's fair because it's a different topic altogether anyway. I don't like to dig deep either but I just felt that whenever Avidya is mentioned, invariably the Jiva has to explained/associated. So it seemed to me that the locus of Avidya can be resolved definitively. Another reason why this feeling of mine is reinforced is because according to Dasgupta, even Padmapada in his panchapadika did not anywhere say Brahman is the Ashraya of Avidya. It was Prakashatman who first said that (in panchapadika-vivarana school). Of course, you are clubbing Sureshvara's and Prakashatman's views but I understand that, it is not an issue for a Traditionalist. I completely agree with you that a thorough study is required to understand the sub-commentator's and the commentator's views properly.
