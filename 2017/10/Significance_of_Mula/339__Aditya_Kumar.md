 Which one is bhavarupa? Seeing a snake or not knowing the rope? Because even if we realize 'It is not a snake', we may think 'Oh, it's an eel' or 'Oh, it's a tail'. As 'Knowing it as rope' alone can dispel 'Not knowing the rope', shouldn't this be the actual avidya?

Right knowledge dispels wrong knowledge. When the wrong knowledge 'this is
a snake' is dispelled, there ceases the (wrong) perception of the snake.
The person gets the right knowledge, which no doubt is vastu tantra: he has
known the vastu. rope, there, through the right pramana. The wrong
knowledge did not arise through any pramana; it is not pramana janya.
