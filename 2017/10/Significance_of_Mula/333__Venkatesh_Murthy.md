Namaste

IMHO Mula Avidya is necessary for us to explain Creation of the World.
Brahman cannot be Upaadaana for Jagat. If Brahman is Material Cause
Jagat will become Satya like Brahman. Therefore we say Jagat's Material
Cause is the Positive Mula Avidya. It has to be Positive because Jagat is
positive. If it is only Absence or Negative - some positive thing like
Jagat cannot come out of that pure Absence.
