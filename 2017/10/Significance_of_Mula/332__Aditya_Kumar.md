Namaste,
I want to understand the significance of Mula Avidya in Shankara's Vedanta. It seems to me that Mula Avidya is the main distinguishing factor between Vijnanavada Buddhism and Vedanta. Is this Mula Avidya also the reason why we have vyavaharika and paramarthika satyas?
I haven't fully studied SSS views on it. Hence I am keen to know if there are any implications if we consider Mula Avidya to be positive in nature or otherwise.
