It is not what I am saying but the movie says quite innocently though. I
think the best attitude to such a situation is none other than this:

//I remember in a very small town near Vridhachalam in Tamilnadu Rajani's
Raghavendrar was screened and even ordinary people but admirers of Gurugalu
were seeing the movie ,which I can never forget in my life AND REMEMBER THE
ACTOR ALWAYS with admiration.
LET US SEE THE POSITIVE SIDE OF THE THINGS AND IF POSSIBLE CONTRIBUTE FOR
ITS IMPROVEMENT.//

The caps are not mine but of the  one who has admiration for the actor and
the portrayal. There is much to learn from such an attitude.
