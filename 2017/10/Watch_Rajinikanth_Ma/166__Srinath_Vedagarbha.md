That's fine, but you are doing is totally different. Sri.Raghavendra Tirtha
is saying 'actual tatva' is xyz. You may agree or disagree and that is the
besides the point. What you are doing is saying is what is 'attava' to
Sri.Raghavenda Tirtha is good for society. That is what  exactly I am
saying is quite wrong.

At least such title will not confuse and misguide uninformed members here
about real siddhanta of Sri Raghavendra. Without such explicit title, one
thinks it is in fact actual siddhAnta of Sri.Raayaru.
