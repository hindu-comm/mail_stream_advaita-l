Namaste Sri Sujalji

I am neither pro-foreign travel nor anti-foreign travel. I have merely quoted a Shruti that prohibits foreign travel. Since Shruti is eternal, it's teachings cannot be bound by space or time - an argument which other members have tried to use. 

Yes, many issues crop up if this injunction is taken seriously in this day.  One alternative is to restrict the injunction to brAhmaNas alone. That might be a way forward.

Kalyan
