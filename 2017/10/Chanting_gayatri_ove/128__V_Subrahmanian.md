Dear Sri Ravi ji,

In this post, a Ramanuja follower says that the reason for other caste
people not being allowed to mingle with Brahmins - all Srivaishnavas - is
the reason that the latter are not prepared to give up the idea of their
being 'higher':

http://www.ramanuja.org/sv/bhakti/archives/nov2001/0141.html

//Now, the natural question is, if our AchAryAs

have shown so much open mindedness and so much
reforms, why does the current religion have so
much "brahminical" tendencies (like many
non-brahmin bhagavathas not allowed into the
gOshti, many people not dining with them etc.),
then the simple answer, though however
difficult it is to digest, is that most of
the community (in both the sects) is reluctant
to let go of the assumed "superiority" of a
brahmin birth. This "brahminisation" of
srIvaishNavam is not new - It has been happening
for centuries, and in fact is a major cause of
difference in opinion among many people (not
among vEdAnta dEsika and piLLai lOkAchAr as
many would immediately assume) of far lower

stature than our great AchAryAs.//

The talk of 'reforms' in the Ramanuja system is also noteworthy.  Why would
there be 'reform' by either Ramanuja or any other of that system, if there
was something that was not already there, now introduced? Thus there is the
perception even among the followers of Ramanuja that there indeed has been
a 'reform' with regard to the caste idea.

There is also the famous instance of Sri Vadiraja Tirtha of the Madhva
school admitting a community of goldsmiths into the Madhva fold:

Also in the above post: //4. Of course, we all know that Sri Ramanujacharya
inducted many non-brahmins including dhobis (or washermen) into his fold.
Now hardly anyone can tell who were the descendents of Smarthas who came to
Vishishtadwaita fold and who were the descendents of non-brahmins who came
to the Vishishtadwaita fold.//

regards
subbu
