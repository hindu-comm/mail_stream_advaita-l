...............
Of the Tri Matastha Brahmins only Smaarta and Maadhwa Brahmins follow Varna Ashrama rules strictly
...........

Not that all vaiSNava yatis are flouting the rules. There are vaiSNava yatis who practice the AchAra very strictly.  

The present Azhagiya Singar of Ahobila Muttam Srivan Satagopa Sri.Ranganatha Yateendra Mahadesikan
is a great vedic scholar and nityAgnihotri.  He is a salakSaNa-ghanApATigal in purvAshrama.  A very modest,
humble & down-to-earth grihastha.  He wanted to go to Germany for higher studies in shAstra. But Kanchi
Paramacharya forbid Him and advised to stay back.  Took to nityAgnihotra after marriage.  

After taking sanyAsa, spends His time in anuSTAna and dharma-prachAra.  He stays away from
pomp and riches; walks barefoot and takes cold bath even in chilly cold winter. 

He observes the dharma in 3 ways - with mind, speech and body and hence verily and can aptly
be called as 'tri-daNdin'.

regs,
sriram
