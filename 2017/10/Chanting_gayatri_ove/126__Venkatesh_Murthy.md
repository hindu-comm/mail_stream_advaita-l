'Ramanuja escapes along with some of his followers and arrives in the
neighbouring Hoysala empire, where a Jain King, Bitti Deva is ruling.
Karnataka had Jain Kings for several centuries. Ramanuja convinces the King
and converts him to a Shri Vaishnava, and renames him as Vishnuvardhana. A
large number of Jains are also converted. These are today are known as,
Hebbar Iyengars, who are Brahmins. Ramanuja also converts many other
nonBrahmins communities as Iyengars. Several Dalit communities are also
converted into Brahmins. This is history. Today in Karnataka and Andhra,
there are several Iyengar Brahmin communities, whose ancestors were not
Brahmins'
