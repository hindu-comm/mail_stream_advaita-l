If you read history of Ramanuja you will see he had many non Brahmin and
non Dvija disciples. They do not strictly practice Varna Ashrama Dharma.
Famous story is of the Sudra disciple Villidasan. Read it here -

Not only there were Sudras disciples but they also became converted to
Srivaishnava Brahmins with Ramanuja's blessings. That is why they say the
Sri Vaishnava Mata have many converted Brahmins in them. It is like some
person today may have a Sudra ancestor in his line.

If they are not following the Varna Ashrama Dharma the ocean crossing ban
does not apply for them. They are free to roam about everywhere on Mother
Earth.

Of the Tri Matastha Brahmins only Smaarta and Maadhwa Brahmins follow Varna
Ashrama rules strictly. Gaudiya Vaishnavas like ISKCON people are relaxed
and they are free to roam anywhere. ISKCON has also converted many Sudras
into Dvijas and they can do Archana of Krishna in the temple.

Saiva Siddhanta followers also have no restriction.
