On the aside, for all those living abroad, real threat is what Ravi Chandrasekhara pointed out. 
................

Yes....Caucasian marriages, rajaswalA niyamAs thrown to winds (even in the families who boast of performing anuSTAna abroad...).

The main problem is rajaswalA niyama paripAlana.  In India, almost all the ladies in every household know it's implications and atleast try to be 
careful while intermixing with people.  But, there, it is impossible.  This I got a feedback from a family who once upon a time were siSTAs in India.
