Sri Sujalji

I dont know how to respond to your posts.From what you say below, you seem to intend to deny a direct connection between the guru and SVBF. I find your view unconvincing. Pardon me if I am wrong about your views.

Thanks for the discussion.

Regards
Kalyan


//Direct guidance does not mean he is
 actively involved in day-2-day activities. No I am not
 chanigng sides :) He may be involved in setting up a matha,
 but that's it.//

 //I personally think that Sringeri Jagadguru remains aloof to many things. This does not mean he is unaware. He may or may not be aware. it depends if the issue is minor or major one. I would prefer to use the word 'unconcerned'. I also feel that the website or any activity like Newsletter, etc is not directly managed by him, meaning that he is not actively involved in these kind of activities. //
