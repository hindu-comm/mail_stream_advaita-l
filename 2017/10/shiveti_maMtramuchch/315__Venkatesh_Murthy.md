श्रीरावण-कृतम् शिव-ताण्डव-स्तोत्रम्
I have heard this Stotra sung by many people but this one is the best with

This hymn describes the power and beauty of Lord Shiva. It is believed to
have been written and sung by Ravana. This version has been performed by a
new, all-girl devotional music band called Om Voices.
