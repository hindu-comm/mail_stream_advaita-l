Here is the link to the YouTube channel where several informative and
inspiring videos containing short messages in Tamil by Sri Sarma Sastrigal:

https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCla6pFV_p9tFoMHPxqwV0qw/videos

If one subscribes to the channel I think he will get message about updates.
There is no need to be in FB for benefiting from Sri Sastrigal's messages.
