 The Enlightened Guru as Jagatkāraṇam

The Mundakopanishat, for instance, teaches that the aparokṣajñānin, if
worshiped with desire for aishvarya, lordliness, wealth, etc. these will be
granted.

यं यं लोकं मनसा संविभाति विशुद्धसत्त्वः कामयते यांश्च कामान् ।
तं तं लोकं जयते तांश्च कामांस्तस्मादात्मज्ञं ह्यर्चयेद्भूतिकामः ॥ १० ॥

10 Whatever world a man of pure understanding envisages in his mind and
whatever desires he cherishes, that world he conquers and those desires he
obtains, Therefore let everyone who wants prosperity worship the man who
knows the Self.

A : So does this mean that a Jnani will _certainly_ have Yoga/Ashta Siddhis? Many Gurus are said to have abilities to curse and grant boons. So is this a good sign of deciding who is a true Jnani?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sureshwara has said in the Mānasollāsa: Ishvaro gururātmeti
mūrtibheda-vibhāgine. vyomavad vyāptadehāya dakṣiṇāmūrtaye namaḥ.
Obeisance to Lord Dakshinamurti, the all-pervading Consciousness that alone
appears as the Ishwara, the Guru and the Self (jiva). Here too, Sureshwara
is consistently voicing the 'one only appears as many' that he has said in
the Bṛ.Up.Bh <http://xn--nig.up.bh>āṣya vārtika.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A : In the concluding verses of Manasollasa, the author states that the person will get all siddhis. But if anyone studying Manasollasa but do not have any siddhis, should we conclude that the person is not a jnani but wants to be a jnani?

There is a view that all jnanis need not have Yoga Siddhis. But how do we explain this? Is it a hit or miss kind of thing? another indescribable factor? But it seems like everywhere there is support to conclude that a true jnani _most certainly_ attains siddhis which is why he becomes the Lord in the true sense because he/she is capable of granting boons and cursing. All powerful.
