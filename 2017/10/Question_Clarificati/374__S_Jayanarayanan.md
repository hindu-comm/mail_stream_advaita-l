Yes, so far as the effect of performing a ritual is concerned, knowing the meaning
of Mantras is certainly secondary to chanting accurately.

That's taking it to the "extreme" level! Knowing the meanings of Mantras is
very good. One should add that knowing the *correct* meaning - not just the literal
meaning - is excellent.

Besides, the Veda doesn't consist of Mantras alone, but also Vidhis (Brahmanas).
One can ask the question: "Which is more important - Mantras or Vidhis/Brahmanas?"
Of course, the answer is that both are equally important, but some would say
that the balance is 51-49 in favor of the Vidhis, since even to know which Mantra
to recite comes from the Vidhis.Hence knowing the meanings of the Vidhis is the
foundation of Dharma!
