Namaste,
In the opening chapter of the ChAndogya upaniShad, there is a statement:

यदेव विद्यया करोति श्रद्धयोपनिषदा तदेव वीर्यवत्तरं भवति  whoever performs a
ritual with full knowledge of its meaning, with shraddhA, belief in its
efficacy and with upaniShad, meaning with upAsana, then that will be more
efficacious than the karma done without knowledge of its meaning, without
shraddhA and without upAsana.

Shankara comments thus: दृष्टं हि लोके वणिक्शबरयोः पद्मरागादिमणिविक्रये
वणिजो विज्ञानाधिक्यात् फलाधिक्यम् ; तस्मात् यदेव विद्यया विज्ञानेन युक्तः
सन् करोति कर्म श्रद्धया श्रद्दधानश्च सन् , उपनिषदा योगेन युक्तश्चेत्यर्थः,
तदेव कर्म वीर्यवत्तरम् अविद्वत्कर्मणोऽधिकफलं भवतीति ; विद्वत्कर्मणो
वीर्यवत्तरत्ववचनादविदुषोऽपि कर्म वीर्यवदेव भवतीत्यभिप्रायः ।
That something done with full knowledge, faith and concentration is more
efficacious than the one done without these qualities is well known even in
everyday life. However this does not mean that the ritual performed
mechanically is fruitless, it is just that this is more fruitful. However
in both cases, the mantra ought to be pronounced correctly, that is an
absolute necessity.

Regards,
Venkatraghavan
