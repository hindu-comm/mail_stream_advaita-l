Namaste All,

During ucchAraN of vaidika mantras, is nodding the head or moving eyes
up/down as a bodily support advisable to help modulate svaras? Or is one
supposed to enunciate the svaras without the assistance of bodily
movements? Could someone please clarify, and also, if possible, provide the
pramANa where these instructions are given?

Namaste,
Prashant
