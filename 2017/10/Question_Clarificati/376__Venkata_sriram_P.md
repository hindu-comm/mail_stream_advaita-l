.....................
That something done with full knowledge, faith and concentration is more
efficacious than the one done without these qualities is well known even in
everyday life. However this does not mean that the ritual performed
mechanically is fruitless, it is just that this is more fruitful.
....................

True.  अधिकस्य अधिकं फलम्..

निरुक्त (१.६.१८)  says:

स्थाणुरयं भारहारः किलाभूदधीत्यवेदं न विजानाति योऽर्थम् ।
योऽर्थज्ञ इत् सकलं भद्रमश्नुते नाकमेतिज्ञानं विधूतपाप्मा ॥

The niruktakAra says that one who doesn't know the meaning of the veda is like a 'sthANu'  (immovable stump / jaDa padArtha)
who is 'bhU-bhAra' (vide ref. भारहारः).   However, if knows the meaning and essence, then by burning the sins attains the kalyANa
and bhadrata.

But, initially, while learning, one has to take extreme care in pronunciation and that is what the शीक्षा stresses.
