Dear Friends,            "Dhanatrayodashi":It is celebrated before Diwali. Goddess Lakshmi & Ganesha are worshippedwith reverence. It is believed that Goddess enters house & reside there for awhole year. Lakshmi signifies purity and purification. 



Ganesha siddhi is must for liberation, as keeping intact the buddhi is necessary with out that people may fall again& again in the endless cycles ofsamsara.

Finallythose who can keep their mind dissolved in their atma by keeping the buddhiintact, they can walk on the path towards liberation with the help of theSriguru as he can make any sadhaga to crossthe Vaitarini river.
