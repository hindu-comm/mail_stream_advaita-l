Dear Hardik Ji,

Shri.Maheshananda Giri Ji of Dakshinamurti Mutt, Varanasi has written hindi
commentary on Sapthasathi.  This is not the commentary to Guptavathi but
Swamiji explains in details the innermost secrets of Sapthasathi and it's
upAsana rahasya.

The e-book can be downloaded from below link.  It is "मधुकैटभ वध एवं
दुर्गासप्तशती सार".  Wonderful concepts have been discovered

regs,
sriram
