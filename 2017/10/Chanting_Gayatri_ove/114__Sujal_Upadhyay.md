Sri Kalyan ji,

Calm down. No this is not what I mean :) - the point is  --no one is above
shastras, but there are always exceptions and exception is not a rule.

Can this logic be applied to Sringeri Jagadguru too. Is he exception or is
he not? I am not in a position to comment on this issue.

But I would not question you as you have already given your opinion -
follow smriti and shruti is to be restricted to Brahmins. Point Noted.
Thank you.

I am also studying the Br. Up. 1.3.8-17 and beyond. It looks like there is
slight difference in the translation of Gita Press (Sanskrit-Hindi) and
English one by Swami Madhavananda of Advaita Ashram. Maybe other members
can shed some light on the translation by comparing it with original
sanskrit.

Hari OM
Sujal
