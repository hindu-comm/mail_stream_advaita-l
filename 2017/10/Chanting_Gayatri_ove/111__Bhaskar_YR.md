Meanwhile the "traditionalists" are off somewhere in some dark corner of the internet debating lofty philosophical concepts in Sanskrit and native tongues making minimal effort to connect with the youth whose attention they are losing every second of every day. Nothing wrong with such activities, but there should be a much greater effort on the part of the elders to engage with the youth.

Good observation.  I reckon one of the reasons for this is, conservative nature of the traditionalists with a mindset 'vedAnta shAstra is not for all' :-) whereas the new age institutions like ISKCONites, are more flexible and accommodative when it comes to propagation of importance of nAma saMkeertana etc. doctrinal issues, yOgyata, adhikAra, varNa etc. always would take back seat hence more people get attracted easily.  How many foreigners can stay and learn shAstra in traditional Amnaya mutts under the guidance of traditional Acharya-s?? hardly any.  Whereas, modern day spiritual hubs welcome one and all irrespective of their caste and creed.   Traditional institutions are more particular ( to the extent fussy while chosing the students) about AchAra, vichAra, vidhi, nishedha, varNa, adhikAra, yOgyata etc. and after evaluating  these socio-physical appearance of students meticulously they provide accommodation to  study the shAstra in a traditional environment.  I am not blaming this as these formalities are traditional obligations followed since very long time, but this would be the main hindrance for the others who are really interested to study the shAstra in a traditional way but not meeting the eligibility criteria in one way or the other.
