यः नः धियः  प्रचोदयात् तत् सवितुः देवस्य वरेण्यं भर्गः धीमहि।

What is there that cannot be repeated here or elsewhere?

The method of meditation is prescribed as:

...............
शुचौ देशे प्रतिष्ठाप्य स्थिरमासनमात्मनः। नात्युच्छ्रितं नातिनीचं चैलाजिनकुशोत्तरम्।।6.11।।
...........

shrI madhusudana saraswathi writes as:

तत्रासननियमं दर्शयन्नाह द्वाभ्याम् शुचौ स्वभावतः संस्कारतो वा शुद्धे जनसमुदायरहित निर्भये गङ्गातटगुहादौ देशे समे स्थाने .....

shrI rAmAnuja writes as:

शुचौ देशे अशुचिभिः पुरुषैः अनधिष्ठिते अपरिगृहीते च अशुचिभिः वस्तुभिः अस्पृष्टे च पवित्रीभूते देशे दार्वादिनिर्मितं....

That is the reason, the 'sthala-shuddhi' is mentioned for meditation.  And hence, during gAyatri japa, the 
efficacy is terms of increased proportions is highlighted w.r.t to the places such as house, gO-shAla,
sacred rivers, swayambhu temples etc.

That is the reason that Shri.R.Hariram Atreya, who did his computer engineering from Texas University, unable to 
perform his anuSTAna in mleccha desha, resigned his lucrative job, came back to India, joined a vaidika gurukulam and started teaching vedas to
young brahmacharis.  This is called tyAga for preservation of one's swadharma.
