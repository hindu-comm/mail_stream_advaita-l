I think it would be incorrect to attribute some other reasons for the
traditional ancient Maṭha-s establishing branches in other countries. What
generally initiates such a move by the Maṭha-s is the presence of a
considerable traditional devotee-following in those places and their
sincere yearning for having their Maṭha there. If such a condition prevails
in African countries the Brahminical Maṭha-s may consider that possibility
too. Maṭha apart, recently someone had shared a picture of Upākarma (Tamil
Smarta) in Dubai. It was indeed an impressive gathering.
