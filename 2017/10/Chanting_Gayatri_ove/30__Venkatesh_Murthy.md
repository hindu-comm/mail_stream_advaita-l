Namaste
Like Sri Sriram said we should not use our intelligence against Swamiji's
statements. Two great Swamijis have said foreign lands are not suitable for
Brahmin Dharma. You cannot argue saying Pakistan had more Rishis and so on
because the two Swamijis already would know that. Still they said foreign
lands are not for Brahminism.

Some people will say 'Udaracaritanam Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam' and so on and
we can live anywhere and practice Brahminism. But they are not
understanding the prohibition is not because of the Land but because of the
people living there. The culture in foreign countries is not according to
Sanatana Dharma. People there have no purity restrictions like avoid
contact with woman in monthly period and Ashaucha duration when somebody in
the family passes away or a baby is born. They are not following any
purification procedures. If you live in that society and contact of those
people you will also become impure. In that impure condition how can you do
Vaidika Karmas? This is the problem.

Bhagavan Naama Smarana has not restrictions of place and time. One story is
Hanuman was flying in the sky and he saw one man passing stools after
constipation. He became relieved and was saying 'Raama Raama'. Hanuman hit
him on his head and scolded him 'Why are you muttering God's name in this
impure condition?' When Hanuman went to see Raama there was a severe
headache in Raama because Hanuman hit His Bhakta's head. Raama scolded
Hanuman 'My name is like Fire. There cannot be anything to make it impure.
It is always Auspicious. No restriction to chant for anyone anywhere and
anytime.' That is why even in cremation ground they say 'Narayana
Narayana'.
