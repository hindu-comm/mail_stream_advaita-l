If it was possible to go abroad it is also possible to come back. Why it
will become impossible permanently? Is Indian Govt prohibiting them to come
back? Not a chance. Mostly people give excuses to keep on staying abroad.
They will come for short visits but they hesitate to permanently come back.
Some try to come back and expect too much from the Govt and friends and
relatives to treat them like Kings. When they are disappointed they again
go back abroad. This also happens.

 But Nitya karma also requires Suddhi of place, person and time. In a time
of Ashaucha when somebody close in your family has died and you become
impure you can do Sandhya up to Arghya Pradaana. Some Pandits say you
should not even do that much. Gayatri Japa is not allowed. Nitya Devata
Archana is not allowed. This is showing Suddhi is always required. The
question of Pratyavaya comes if you are pure and don't do Nitya Karma.

 Sudddhi should be there. Without proper Suddhi all Vaidika Karmas will not
have any meaning.
