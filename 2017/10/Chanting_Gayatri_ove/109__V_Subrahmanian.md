Yes, I am in complete agreement with you.  mAta and mAtru bhumi most sacred
on this earth.  But my contention is with regard to  labelling some other’s
mAtru bhUmi as something mere bhOga bhUmi not fit for mOksha / karma etc.
especially when the mAtru bhumi boundary ( which we are sticking now)
itself debatable since it is time bound distinguished area!!  And we have
the ‘jagad’ guru/s, who are there to guide all sincere sAdhaka-s  on the
mother earth.  Under these circumstances, can we bifurcate mother earth
like some part of her is only good for bhOga and some other part naming it
as bhArata and declare it as karma / mOksha bhUmi??  Is it so difficult for
us to find only bhOga place in bharata khanda when ‘red light areas,
unrestricted beach areas’ etc. are abundant !!??  Likewise is it so
difficult to see serene and purified divine atmosphere, exalted souls,
sincere mumukshu-s / sAdhaka-s  at foreign country to label it completely
as mere bhOga bhUmi??  Kindly let me know if there is anything wrong in my
way of thinking.


The five 'places' that Parikshit permitted to Kali to reside in this dharma
bhumi itself are such 'areas' that shishtas will not go to. Yet such areas
have coexisted with other 'pure' areas.
