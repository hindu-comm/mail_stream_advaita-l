Namaste,

Just for the record parAshara smriti does permit remarriage of widow.
Please refer PS 4.30

When her husband is missing, or is dead, or has renounced the world, or is
impotent, or has been degraded by sin, — on any of the said five calamities
befalling a woman, law has ordained another husband for her.

​Pranams
Sujal​
