'The Baudhayana Sutra
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baudhayana#The_Dharmas.C5.ABtra>, one of the
Hindu Dharma Shastras <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dharma%C5%9B%C4%81stra>,
says that "making voyages by sea" (II.1.2.2)
<http://www.hinduwebsite.com/sacredscripts/hinduism/dharma/baudh2.asp#fr_1078>
is an offense which will cause *pataniya*, loss of caste. It offers a
rather difficult penance: "They shall eat every fourth mealtime a little
food, bathe at the time of the three libations (morning, noon and evening),
passing the day standing and the night sitting. After the lapse of three
years, they throw off their guilt."
