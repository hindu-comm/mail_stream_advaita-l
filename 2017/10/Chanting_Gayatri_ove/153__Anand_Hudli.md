Gokhale Institute of Public Affairs, Bengaluru (
http://www.gipa-bng.org/php/malike.php) has produced a large number of
mostly audio CDs containing Kannada lectures by traditional scholars on
Vedanta, Bhagavad Gita, Shankara Bhagavatpada's works, Puranas, Kavya,
Sanskrit Literature, and a variety of other topics. Their collection is
indeed a delightful treasure trove for those who understand Kannada.
