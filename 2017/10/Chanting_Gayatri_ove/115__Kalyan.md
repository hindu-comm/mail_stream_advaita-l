Sri Sujalji

I am very calm. What makes you think I am angry? I am merely posing questions which might be inconvenient to some.

If I wilfully neglect Sandhya, elders would point out my fault. But when elders do something contrary to shastras, it suddenly becomes sistachara and acceptable? 


Regards
Kalyan

 Sri Kalyan
 ji,
 Calm down. No this
 is not what I mean :) - the point is --no one is above
 shastras, but there are always exceptions and exception is
 not a rule.
