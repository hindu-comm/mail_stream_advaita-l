You can hear talks of this kind, in Telugu, for example:

There are talks, if you can search, by the Sringeri Acharyas, in various
languages. Swami Paramarthananda ji's talks are all in English and cover a
wide spectrum of smarta dharma and Vedanta. For example, he has given a 10
part talk on sandhyāvandanam. You can contact 'shāstraprakāśikā trust' in
Chennai and view their catalogue and order what you want.
