Namaste

http://rsvidyapeetha.ac.in/regular-courses.html

There is  no requirement to be a Brahmin and male for courses in RS
Vidyapeetha. The first course requires only a SSLC pass or equivalent
certificate. Age 15-18 years. No upper age limit for ladies.

Today young people from India are going for higher studies to USA and other
countries. Similarly interested young people from USA and other countries
can come here and learn Sastras.

They should not bank on learning from second hand sources abroad. It cannot
be a substitute.
