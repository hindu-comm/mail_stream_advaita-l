I am surprised that in this entire discussion no one has quoted the Brihadaranyaka upanishad so far.

Br.Up.1.3.10 advises against foreign travel. Shankara interprets it in the same way. 

Travel should be confined to lands inhabited by people possessing Vedic knowledge - this is the gist.

Thus, there is Shruti prohibition against foreign travel.
