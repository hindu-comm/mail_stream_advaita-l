It is well known that Sri Sugunendra Theertha of the Puttige mutt, one of
the eight maṭha-s said to have been established by Madhva, does undertake
foreign trips and some years ago there was a raging controversy about his
paryāya at Udupi Sri Krishna Temple.  As I had reported in this thread, he
has released a book on this very topic, that sees no defilement, authored
by a practicing Madhva settled in the US.

It should also be noted that śiṣṭāchāra is also a pramāṇa. The Sringeri
Jagadguru, though has not traveled abroad, nevertheless does not impose the
smṛti-ban on others. He does not excommunicate any devotee of the Peetham
for having traveled abroad. I have heard that there is the rule that is in
vogue that those from the Peetham at Sringeri who travel abroad are not
allowed to conduct worship in the temples there any longer.  Someone said,
once the present Jagadguru had observed that so far the Pontiffs of the
peetha have observed the ban for themselves but nothing can be said about
the coming generations. As has been reported in this thread, the Peetham
has institutions abroad, in the USA for some decades now and all religious
activity is conducted there. The Jagadguru has blessed the activity there
through a webinar type live relay from here.
