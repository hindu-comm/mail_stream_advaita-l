The ocean crossing prohibition is only for a person practicing Varna and
Ashrama Dharma. Even for him there is a Prayaschitta after coming back. For
others like Caarvaaka Materialists there is no ban. A person in Varna
Ashrama Dharma can take decision to A - go abroad and do Prayaschitta after
coming back or B - not go abroad. It is his decision and we cannot question
it.
Sanyasa also comes under Ashrama Dharma only. A Sanyasi can take his own
decision. We cannot question it.
