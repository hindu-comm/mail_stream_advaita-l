but they downplay varna and believe in Veda Adhikara for all, etc.

Veda adhikAra has been denied to non-dvija-s and stree, that is the traditional stand which has the stamp of bhAshyakAra also.  And traditional mutts dare not to deviate from this injunction.  Other neo-advaitic and other institutions hardly care !!! Few years back I was talking to a very knowledgeable 'vaishya saNyAsi' at kAryAlaya, during the discussion, he made a passing comment that there is no entry as a participant  in the vidvat sadas (vAkyArtha sabha) for the sanyasi-s and scholars other than brAhmaNa community !!  I donâ€™t know the existing practice with regard to this at traditional mutts.  Would like to hear more on this issue.  

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
