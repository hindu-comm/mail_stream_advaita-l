Sri Sujalji,

Would you recommend breaking of the Ashrama dharma as a regular practice? Shankara did it, so anyone else can do it? Comes under sistachara right? If we have sistachara to guide us, why have shruti and smriti?

Regards
Kalyan

 Pranams,
 Even Ādi Śankara
 has broken Āshrama dharma when he attended his mother's
 cremation. 

 Thank you Sri Subbu
 ji sharing sharing your thoughts in this and earlier
 emails.
 A little off-topic:
 I humbly feel that we should not try to find perfection in
 anybody. Except Iśvara no one else is perfect. People find
 faults in Bhagavān Rāma also.

 There is no compulsion for him to go there
 physically. For those who have

 gone there and settled, he does not refuse his blessings.
 His attitude in

 this has been already stated by me in this thread: So far
 the Jagadguru of

 this peetham has not gone abroad. We do not know what will
 be the case with

 the future pontiffs. That said, here is what he said, in a
 different

 context, about his predecessor Guru, Jagadguru Sri Abhinava
 Vidyatirtha as

 published in the book Yoga, Enlightenment and Perfection
 :



 //He was not in the least dogmatic. The ancients held that
 the earth is

 fixed while the modern scientists aver that it moves.



 purāṇamityeva na sādhu sarvaṁ

 na cāpi kāvyaṁ navamityavadyam ।

 santaḥ parīkṣyānyataradbhajante mūḍhaḥ

 parapratyayaneyabuddhiḥ ॥4 (Malavikāgnimitra I.2)

 (All that is ancient is not good nor is a work censurable
 because it is

 modern. The wise accept an alternative after examination;
 the

 unwise are guided by the beliefs of others.)

 In keeping with this statement of the pre-eminent poet
 Kālidāsa, His

 Holiness subscribed only to the position that the earth
 moves. He

 ignored, in this manner, the distinction of ancient and
 modern in numerous

 matters and gave weight only to that which was reasonable

 and accorded with evidence. Broadmindedness such as His was
 difficult to

 come by in anyone else. //



 And Jagadguru Chandrashekhara Bharati Swamiji, admittedly a
 very orthodox

 Sannyasin, 'encouraged his disciple (Jagadguru Sri
 Abhinava Vidyatirtha) to

 take a free and independent line of thinking in such matters
 in keeping

 with the need to cater to a changing a less orthodox
 society. For his part

 however, he was content with directly holding the views he
 had.' (cited

 from the book The Crest Jewel of Yogis, Vol I,p.109).



 So, there is no worth in asking 'why the Jagadguru does
 not travel

 abroad?'



 Swami Paramarthananda had said about 'personal
 habits/interests': In a

 spiritual retreat spanning a few days, every morning the
 participants would

 arrive at the dining hall in the morning for breakfast and
 beverage. A

 choice of Coffee, Tea, milk, etc. will be offered. Each one
 takes that

 which he is used to, is comfortable with, preference, etc.
 There is no

 censure of those who prefer coffee over milk. In fact if
 some of the

 beverages offered there were a taboo, they would not have
 been given as a

 choice.



 So, a person may not have objection to someone else
 travelling abroad but

 he may not be inclined to do so. Does not one have the
 freedom to hold a

 particular view?

 Conviction arising from an argument is subjective.
