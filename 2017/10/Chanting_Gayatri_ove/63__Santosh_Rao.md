I understand, I myself have emailed Sri Jaldhar directly with personal
questions because I value his opinions greatly. For the past 3 years this
list has been one of my "go to's" for shastric knowledge. But the fact that
I have to come to the obscure ends of the internet in order to read
traditional views and discussions regarding vedanta is demonstrative about
what I am saying.

I don't particularly favor the view that duties like SV and chanting
Gayatri should be forsaken overseas, but at the same time I don't find the
excuses made for disregarding clear statements in shruti very satisfying.
I'm sorry if I offended anyone, it wasn't my intention


Namaskara,

Santosh

If we take this injunction too seriously, this list will fall apart. Owner
(admin), moderators and some active members are living in foreign land. The
list itself should have filter that only those living in India should be
allowed to join.

This very discussion is possible because of these (foreign) members who
have contributed a lot to this list.

There are people who are actively involved in defending sanAtana dharma,
their contribution too should be discarded and we should not be in contact
with them. In fact practising dvija-s should avoid interacting with those
who do not practice.

All western invention should be at once abandoned like Computer, Mobile,
TV, internet, Youtube, etc.We should stop doing business with them. Those
doing business with them are not qualified to even see Brahmins, forget
giving donations. Everybody in touch with foreigner is impure and so must
be avoided.

I too am not qualified to say anything on any matter.

So now, what is the way ahead. Cannot deny shAstra-s, cannot ignore hard
work and contribution of (foreign) Hindu or say Western Hindu.

Sujal
