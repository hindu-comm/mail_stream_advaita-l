Dears
Our matadhi pathis going to foreign countries is for helping the Hindus
there to observe our religious instructions in the temples built there and
to create an atmosphere of devotion. They are not going there for money.
Christian missionaries go for converting the poor people to Christianity by
doling out freebies etc as inducement. Our gurus go not for conversion of
the ignorant. Our religion is intellectual oriented. One can begin with no
God and by enquiries could come to a conclusion of his own. There is no
compulsion.
R. Krishnamoorthy.
