Subbuji, I think you have a very unhealthy tendency to label everyone as an asAmpradAyavit or a fool very easily. I think you should curb this tendency. You very easily behave as if you are the only gatekeeper of sAmpradAya.

And stop selectively quoting Shankara bhAshyas. Sistachara does not replace Shruti. The bhAshya on Br. Up. 1.3.10 is quite emphatic that one must not travel to foreign lands. Similar views are found in other dharmashastras quoted by others here. It is these, that the Sringeri Acharya has violated.

Regards
Kalyan

 My guru batuk shastri (Brahmnal, Varanasi)
 always says it's next to impossible we go against shastr
 on anyway.

 Simple question: Is the
 Jagadguru of Sringeri wrong in blessing the SVBF initiative
 in Pennsylvania?

 Answer: I
 bipin chauhan on behalf of Eternal Law declared it totally
 wrong.

 the above name?
 

 For this
 my Guru ke Guru Swami Karpatri fight/ shastrath with madan
 mohan malviya that Widow marriage is not possible the fool
 vaishya kul empire goenka say as per shastr Swami Karpatri
 ji right but malviya is also not wrong due to desh kal
 stithi shloka of gita ji.

 I
 know Jagadguru Sri Bharati Tirtha Mahaswamiji but ignorance

 In the Taittiriyopaniṣat 1.11.3 we
 have:

 अथ
 यदि ते कर्मविचिकित्सा
 वा वृत्तविचिकित्सा वा
 स्यात् ॥ ३ ॥ ये तत्र
 ब्राह्मणाः
 संमर्शिनः। युक्ता
 आयुक्ताः। अलूक्षा

 says:अथ

 संशयः स्यात् भवेत् , ये

 If one
 gets a doubt as to how to conduct oneself on a particular
 issue, he must do as those brāhmaṇa-s who live in that
 place or time who practice dharma and are intent on
 adṛṣṭa, not given to desire, who are not given to
 anger....do.
 Sureshwaracharya too does not say
 anything different in the Taittiriya Bhāṣya Vārtika for
 this.

 Sāyaṇāchārya for this mantra
 says: vṛtta, conduct, means 'kula-paramparāgataḥ
 laukikaḥ ācāraḥ. ' That pertaining to his own
 family, lineage, etc. worldly conduct. There can be doubt as
 to this too, for one sees conduct like 'marrying
 one's maternal daughter, eating meat, etc. A person
 might get a doubt as to these issues too. In that case, he
 has to be guided by the practices of noble persons who live
 in that place, at that time, where this person
 lives.
 So it is very
 clear that in the matter of conduct, dharma, there can't
 be any 'eternal' law; it is essentially decided by
 desha and kāla. That is exactly what Shankara has said in
 the Brahma sutra bhashya. All that the Veda or he himself
 has said elsewhere has to be understood in the light of this
 statement of Shankara and the Taittiriyopanishat. Also, one
 can see the other element that I had highlighted: it is the
 adherence to yama (akrodha, etc.) that gains supremacy over
 niyama. The Taittiriya says: those brahmanas who are not
 given to krodha, kāma, etc. as Shankara has highlighted.
 Dharma differs from place to place, time to time. 

 The
 maṭhāmānya that you seem to refer to does not say
 anything about the topic. So, your own ignorance or
 whatever, you are trying to superimpose on the Jagadguru.
 Also is important to keep in mind what Shankara has said in
 the BGB: even if one is proficient in all shāstra-s, if he
 has not acquired knowledge according to the sampradāya, his
 views are to be rejected as those of a fool. The view you
 have expressed does not bear the kind of sampradāya that
 Shankara has adhered to as is evident in his
 bhāṣya.

 That's
 an excellent bhAShya reference, Subbu ji, on how dharma
 can

 definitely be reinterpreted by shiShTa-s in keeping with the
 present desha

 and kAla. No doubt it's not a licence to say, anything
 goes. We have to

 cautiously move on.



 But to say that all NRI brahmins are patita-s as long as
 they are based

 abroad seems untenable.
