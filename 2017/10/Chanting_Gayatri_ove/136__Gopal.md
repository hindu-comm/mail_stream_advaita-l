namaste,

Kindly, if you have time and inclination, download this (1000 page) book
for free:
https://www.himalayanacademy.com/view/dancing-with-siva

thsi is from the Himalayan Academy, a shaiva siddhantha Hindu monastry in
Hawaii, USA.  The author of the book was Satguru Sivaya Subramuniyaswami.

He was from the  shaiva siddhantha sampradaya from Sri Lanka who moved to
Hawaii.  In this order, monks of all ethnic backgrounds can be ordained and
they live an austere life.  They follow shaiva agama paddhathi currently
prevalent in Tamil Nadu and a few other places in India.

the intention of this post is not to compare, denigrate, expose them for
adulation or criticism but just to provide information and a suggestion
that there are multitude ways  Lord Shiva (for example) is seen by
different people even if they all accept veda pramaana.

I am neither competent nor interested to say anything about the
philosophical foundations of this order but this book gives a nice,
comprehensive view of various darshanas associated with worship of Lord
Shiva (that accept shruthi-pradhaana).
