this type of thing may be able to fly in India, since it is the land of dharma, but outside of India it will be an eventual death-knell for dharma.

Whenever I read boundaries of bhOga bhUmi, yOga bhUmi, karma/dharma bhUmi etc. I always wonder about the area that needs to be covered under yOga / karma bhUmi and exclusively labelling some land as mere bhOga bhUmi.  For that matter what would have been the boundaries of India before independence or say some 800-900 years ago, when dharma shAstra or any other shAstra labelling the bhArata desha / bhumi as karma / yOga / mOksha bhUmi??  I read somewhere that kanchi paramAchArya in his discourses used to tell (ofcourse with proof) that once upon a time (vEda yuga)  hindu dharma was the only universal dharma existing at that time irrespective of boundaries of countries (demarcation of boundaries of countries are recent development) and all  other religions, doctrines and their religious practices  are modified versions of that sanAtana dharma.  Anyway, I am not good at geography but still wonder if at all we talk about the karma bhUmi bhArata which is the only place you get mOksha before independence then that bhArata bhUmi  should be with Pakistan boundaries  also, so boundaries of  Pakistan also should be included  in mOksha bhUmi, karma bhUmi is it not??  Not sure I am thinking logically or in the right way...anyway thinking aloud :-)

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!
