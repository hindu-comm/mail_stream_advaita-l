Thank you Sri Subramanian ji and Sri Sriram ji for appreciation.

I too believed the same, but I didnt have answers. My friend has asked for
some time. If he gets some info and shares with me, I will definitely share
it with the list.

Thank you for sharing this information.

The entire AmnAya mantrAs are invoked into the daNDa by Yati during
daNDa-samskAra and daNDa-tarpaNa.  Such a daNDa sports in the hand of
a sanyAsi just like sudarshana chakra in the hands of Vishnu; trishula in
the hands
of Shiva and vajra in the hands of Indra.

The yati-daNDa represents praNava; that represents the shabda-brahman and
teaches the kartavya of yati which is mahAnirvANa and which is
paramAdvaita-rupa.

This is so helpful. My reverence for him will always be there. I strongly
feel he is a jivanmukta. Expectedly, his way of working, like all other
GYAnI-s, is beyond my comprehension.

Sujal
