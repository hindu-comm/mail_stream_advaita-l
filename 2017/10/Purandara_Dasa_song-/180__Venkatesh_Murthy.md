Namaste

ध्यायन्कृते यजन्यज्ञैस्त्रेतायां द्वापरेऽर्चयन् ।

यदाप्नोति तदाप्नोति कलौ संकीर्त्य केशवम् ॥६-२-१७ Vishnu Purana

'What is gained through Meditation in Krita Yuga through performing
sacrificial rites in Treta Yuga, through ritual worship in Dvaapara Yuga is
obtained in Kali Yuga by reciting the names of Keshava.'
