Thank you everyone for the helpful inputs.

There is a project, a work in progress, on Sri Adi Shankara by the Madhya
Pradesh government, given that probably the most significant place equal in
importance to Kalady, was the place where shri shankara studied Vedanta
from his Guru which is on the banks of Narmada in Madhya Pradesh.

There is a website, related to this project, whose link is given below.

www.statueofculturalunity.in

The MP govt. is also trying to promote Shankara Jayanti in a big way, i am
told.

One acharya from Uttarakashi whom i know, is giving some inputs for this
project and he asked me for more details  which is why I posted here.

Om
