Namaste

Many people know Adi Sankara established Govardhana Math in Puri. But they
may not know he wrote the best Stotra on Puri Jagannath known as Jagannath
Ashtakam. It is so beautiful with perfect combination of words. Even
Caitanya Mahaprabhu though not Advaiti used to chant it in front of
Jagannath. He was very much influenced by its beauty.

Just look at the words जगन्नाथः स्वामी नयनपथगामी भवतु मे 'may that Sri
Jagannatha-deva be the object of my vision'. And the words दया
सिन्धुर्बन्धुः सकल जगतां सिन्धुसुतया. Adi Sankara is simply brilliant.
Really I have no words to describe the happiness of listening to this
Vishnu Stotra.

Only tears of joy.

Koti Pranams to Lord Jagannatha. Koti Pranams to Adi Sankara.

In one Sloka he is describing the world famous Jagannath Rath Yatra.

रथारूढो गच्छन् पथि मिलित भूदेव पटलैः
स्तुति प्रादुर्भावम् प्रतिपदमुपाकर्ण्य सदयः ।
दया सिन्धुर्बन्धुः सकल जगतां सिन्धु सुतया
जगन्नाथः स्वामी नयन पथ गामी भवतु मे ॥५॥

'When Jagannatha's Ratha-yatra cart is moving along the road, at every step
assemblies of brahmanas sing His praises. Upon hearing them, Jagannatha,
being an ocean of mercy and the true friend of all the worlds, becomes
favourably disposed towards them -- may that Sri Jagannatha-deva be the
object of my vision.'

Listen to chorus song and melodious music  -
