Namaste,

A monumental work on 'yati daNDa' (the staff carried by monks of shankara sampradAya).  Authorship is ascribed to
Sankara Bhagavatpada but many scholars don't agree.  

Published in 4 volumes.  These prescribe the rituals (both vaidika & tantrika) of receiving daNDa from yati and also
how to worship the same including the daNDa-tarpaNa etc.  Also, daNDa bhAvana is done from shrIyantra and shrIvidya
perspective.

A sort of tAntric manual of daNDa-pUja.
