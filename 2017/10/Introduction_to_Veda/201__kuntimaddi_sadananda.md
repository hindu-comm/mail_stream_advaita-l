<https://www.amazon.com/dp/0999170406/ref=sr_1_2?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1500425363&sr=1-2&keywords=introduction+to+vedanta>

This book starts with the fundamental human problems and questions and search for happiness, and introduces the philosophy behind the spirituality of the many Upanishads and the Bhagavad Gita, and provides brief quotes from them. It goes on to explain the nature of the mind, its classification and describes what this “I” is. In the process, it also explains the errors in perception, what is real and what is unreal, and the nature of consciousness and ultimate reality. A brief list of materials for further exploration appears at the end of the book.
