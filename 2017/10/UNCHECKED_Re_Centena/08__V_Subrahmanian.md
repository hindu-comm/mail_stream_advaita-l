A Rare Discourse by Sri Sri Abhinava Vidyatirtha Mahaswamigal in Tamil:
Muktikku Bhakti Vazhi

Parables of Acharyal

The fields of two farmers were identical in size and had similar kinds of
soil. They worked equally hard, tilled their lands well and sowed seeds of
uniform quality. The rainfall over the fields was neither excessive nor
scanty and so the crops grew well. At the appropriate time, they commenced
their harvesting. Before they left for their homes on an evening, they were
able to behold with joy large heaps of grains, the result of their efforts.
There was hardly any difference in the yields obtained by them.

That night, while they slept, there was a very heavy downpour on one land
and only a light drizzle on the other. The next morning, when they went to
their lands, one was dismayed to find that the rain had ruined his grains
while the other felt relieved that his heaps of grain were intact.

Thus, notwithstanding the similarity in their efforts, the results they
obtained were markedly dissimilar. It was the unfavourable destiny of one
farmer and the favourable fate of the other that led to the loss of the
former and the gain of the latter. Those who have faith in the Veda-s and
śāstra-s and are logical do not regard the experiences of humans as just
fortuitous.

Two students wrote an examination. The boy who had studied better answered
all except two questions well. The other managed to answer just two
questions correctly. The examiner was an impartial but lazy man. He
scrutinised two of the first boy’s answers. They happened to be the
incorrect ones. Assuming the other answers too to be incorrect, he awarded
the boy low marks.

Then, he took up the second boy’s answer book. The answers he selected for
checking happened to be the correct ones. Taking it for granted that the
remaining answers were also correct, he awarded the boy concerned high
marks. On seeing the results, the boy who had studied better grieved, while
the other rejoiced. Thus, hard work fetched a poor result and poor
preparation yielded good marks. Here too the hand of destiny is seen.

Dyumatsena was destined to be blind and live in a forest. By Sāvitrī’s
efforts, he regained his sight and his kingdom. Aśvapati was not destined
to have sons, but obtained them. Satyavān was to die young, but he lived
long, he sired sons and ruled the Shalva kingdom for many years. This story
is a striking example to show that what is destined to happen can be
markedly changed by human effort.

Mārkaṇḍeya was fated to die at the age of 16 but lived on because of his
devout worship of Lord Śiva. Śuka, the son of Vyāsa, was such a great yogin
that he attained disembodied liberation at the time of his choice. Numerous
instances of the alteration of the course of fate by personal effort and by
the grace of God can easily be cited.

Neither destiny nor personal effort singly determines the course of human
life; there is great interaction between the two.
Destiny or actions of the past that have begun to fructify, human effort
and divine grace together govern what happens now. Manu has compared
destiny and personal effort to the two wheels of a chariot; a chariot
cannot move on a single wheel.

ELUCIDATIONS'.
