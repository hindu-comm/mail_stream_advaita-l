Will Sadhana performed in a foreign land be effective?

Here is an excerpt from the book 'The Saint of Sringeri' authored by Swami
Jnanananda Bharati and published by the Sringeri Pīṭham. A Frenchman's
experience with the guidance of HH Jagadguru Sri Chandrashekhara Bharati
Swamiji is recorded in the book under the chapter 'The World Teacher'.

We find from the report that even a foreigner who is sincere in pursuing
Advaitic sādhana, residing in a foreign land, under the guidance of an
orthodox Acharya of the Sringeri Pīṭham is effective.
