It must be noted that thought too has no real existence as it just appears
and disappears. That which is existent cannot suddenly become a nonentity.
Due to ignorance, one has this long dream that one is born, lives, suffers
and so on. The moment one wakes up from this dream, ignorance ceases and
one realises that one always was, is and will be the Supreme Brahman.
