Namaste,

I have tried to explain Panchkaraṇam Prakriyā as explained in Tatva Bodha
from Gujarati commentary of Swami Tadrupapand ji of Manan Ashram.

Panchiparaṇam is difficult to understand for beginners. In an attempt to
make it easy to understand various charts are created. Charts are created
using an online service draw.io which is connected to Google Drive. You can
save the file in Google Drive and open it from Google Drive.

All charts, their png versions in transparent and white background are also
stored in Google drive. Original article in odt and docx format along with
pdf format is also stored.

Please visit below link to access folder containing all document formats
and charts.
