Hi everyone
Rene Descartes was regarding "I" as the ego ; so by telling "I think" and "I am" his purpose was to confirm his individuality through the ego, a very common concept in western philosophy.It would be very hazardous to look for similarities with "I am" in Advaita.
Very best regards
Daniel Lecomte

Hello all,
Can Somebody please enlighten me the dictum of Descartes "I think,
therefore, I am" and in Hinduism "I am, therefore, I think"?

I am finding it hard to understand. Are there any specific quotes in Veda
or scriptures?

Thanks in advance.

Drb
