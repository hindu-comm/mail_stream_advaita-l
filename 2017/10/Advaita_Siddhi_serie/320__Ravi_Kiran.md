How to understand this ?  ( normally upAdhi referred as, avidyA (jIva) or
mAya (Ishvara) )

Is it meant that sat - as attribute that belong to itself (svadharma) -
Brahman ?

which implies - sat being considered as attribute of  (attributeless)
Brahman, while sat is Brahman Itself ?

Should we take the meaning of upAdhi as locus of appearance?

Then, by the earlier definition of upAdhi - samIpe AdhIyate svadharma: yena
, how to do samanvaya ?
