Hello, Your quote: Advaita members,
"I will be grateful to you if you could find 'prayaschitta ' bookAs such there exists no prayaschitta for the karma done by individual for the self interests/ego sake/materialistic benefits against the cause of service to the mother-land-father-guru, as all are same. one shouldn't go in between them.
One shouldn't see the tears from the father or Guru, if some one behaves or does any action towards that, there is no excuse, in my opinion it is crime .In that case one has to hang themselves, otherwise the officers for the land will do their duty merciless kriya for the Un-lawfull activitives & Un-ethical /moral less behaviour towards 'Guru'.
No knowledge is in the books and guru can only imparts the knowledge so no one can question by whose grace you are standing with physical body on this earth today. More overs orders/warrants has been issued to the disciples to the needful for any action against the dharma/or the welfare of the guru.
As somebody told that there is no escape for karma, one has to face it today or tomarrow or in the next birth.
