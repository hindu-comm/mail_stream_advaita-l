Namaste

This Stotra describes Siva as the Essence of Vedas. Example -  there is a
Sloka
परात्मानमेकं जगद्बीजमाद्यं
निरीहं निराकारमोंकारवेद्यम्
यतो जायते पाल्यते येन विश्वं
तमीशं भजे लीयते यत्र विश्वम्

This is describing Shiva the Paramatma, the One, the seed of the world, the
Origin, without passion, the Formless and known through the Om-kara. The
Universe is born from Him and protected by Him and dissolved into Him. I
worship Him.
