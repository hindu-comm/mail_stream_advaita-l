As practical as it ever was.

It is not that the paramhansa is not dependant on society (all grhasthas not 
just institutions.) but that he should not be attached to them.  Therefore 
there is a niyama that he should not ask for alms in the same place for 
more than three days in a row.

  There are still such parivrajakas to this day.  Many of them take a 
circuit that over several years take them to the four corners of Bharata. 
There are certain places and times where they may revisit.  (The 
Kumbha mela is probably the most well-known example.) but they do not 
"belong" to them.
