 Namste,
Thanks SubbuJi for the enlightened talk by Swami Paramarthananda Ji.
In fact all of us shall be grateful to BhagavAn for glorifying 'grihasta' against 'sannyaasa aashrama (nahi ninda nyaaya !), throwing the stone, as 'kali yuga was close at 'HIS' heels ! ahead of the running dog; wherein most will only be able to take mental 'sannyas' (essence) as opposed to physical !
In any case a 'theevRa mumukshu' will be guided by HIS grace, ALWAYS.
Regards
Balagopal
PS: as independent houses are fast disappearing in Indian towns 'madhukari bhiksha' is out of question. Security won't allow to enter the housing society premises even !    On Monday 23 October 2017, 3:33:15 PM IST, V Subrahmanian via Advaita-l <advaita-l at lists.advaita-vedanta.org> wrote:
