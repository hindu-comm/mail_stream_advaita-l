Teachings of kaṭha upanishad are a collection of teachings of kaṭha rishi which is his own understanding of upnishads.

praNAms Sri Sujal prabhuji
Hare Krishna

Not able to understand this sentence properly.  Do you mean to say here katha Upanishad itself a collection of some rishi and it is hiw own understanding of other Upanishads??  If yes, does it not mean, katha is a paurusheya grantha of the Katha Rishi ??  or am I missing something here??  Please elaborate.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
