I completely agree. There are teachings by rishi-s, hymns written in their name, but they have received the eternal truth by intuitions or as a sprak in their heart. They are just revealing the eternal truth, sometimes directly, sometimes by giving examples.

Yes, hence they have been called as mantra drashtA-s not mantra karta-s.  But question is whether the words (pada) formulated and composed  by rishi-s in veda-s after realizing the eternal truth ?  if the answer is yes, then paramArtha satya has been worded by rishi-s in various formats and given it to us in the form of veda/vedAnta-s.  Again, this is not agreeable since not only satya embedded in vedAnta is eternal and apaurusheya, each and every word in veda / vedAnta which has been there in the scripture is eternal and aparusheya.  Hence nobody dared to change the words in veda/vedAnta even though better clarity available in flourished language to convey the ‘SAME’ meaning.  So, pada and artha both are eternal and apaurusheyam when it comes to veda-s.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
