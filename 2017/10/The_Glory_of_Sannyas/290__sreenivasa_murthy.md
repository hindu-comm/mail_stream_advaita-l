Dear Friends,Before we, discuss about sanyasa, is it not more beneficial to know/cognize our true svarUpa as taught by the Sruti and Revered Acharya first. The prakriya for cognizing the same has been very clearly and in the most direct & simple way has been given by Srutimata in the mantras 2-1-3& 2-1-4 of Kathopanishad and Mantra 2-4 of Kenaupanishad. Then automatically the ochre robe is worn inwardly. Why not give a try? 
 Let us not forget that SrutimantradraShtAras were married persons.
With respectful namaskars,Sreenivasa Murthy

This does not seem to clarify. Not clear what is implied...?
