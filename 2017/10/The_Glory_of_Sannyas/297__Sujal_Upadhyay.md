Pranams Sri Bhaskar Prabhu ji,

I agree with what you say.

Upanishads are in question and answer format. So somebody has to be guru
and so his words are the essence of vedanta.

***
For that matter in most of the Upanishads characters used to advocate
eternal teachings.  Bhrugu-vaaruNi in taitereeya, janaka-yajnavalkya in
bruhadaaraNyaka, bhrugu-vaaruNi in taitereeya, shvetaketu- in chAndOgya
etc.  It does not mean these Upanishads have written after these dialogues
have taken place at some point of time.  Atleast this is what saMpradAya
has to say about apaurusheyatvaM of veda-s.
***

I completely agree. There are teachings by rishi-s, hymns written in their
name, but they have received the eternal truth by intuitions or as a sprak
in their heart. They are just revealing the eternal truth, sometimes
directly, sometimes by giving examples. Truth remains the same. There is
only one truth and it is eternal. In chatuḥsloki Bhāgavat, Bhagavāna Viṣṇu
/ Kṛṣṇa gives Jñāna to Bhagavān Brahmā jī  before brahmadeva began
creation.

Have I put things correctly?

Hare Krṣṇa
Jai Śrī Rāma
Sujal
