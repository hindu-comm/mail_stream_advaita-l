Abhinava VidyAtIrtha mahAsvAminah about his guru HH Chandrashekhara BhArati
mahAsvAminah, which he quotes in the introduction to the latter's (partial)
commentary on the VivekachuDAmaNi.
'व्याख्यापूरणाय आचार्यपादान् कदाचिद्वयं प्रार्थयाम | "वक्तव्या अत्रैव
संगृहीता: निधिध्यासनमन्तरा नाधुनान्यत्र चित्तं व्यापृणोति" इति

Of course, the latter is already a sanyAsi, but the frame of mind of a
jIvanmukta is quite evident.
