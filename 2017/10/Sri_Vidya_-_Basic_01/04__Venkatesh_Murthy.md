Namaste

This comes under Upasana. See the below link for explanation of Sri Vidya
Upasana Tattva -
https://www.kamakotimandali.com/srividya/utattva.html

YatrAsti bhogo na tatra mokShaH yatrAsti mokShaH na tu tatra bhogaH |
ShrIsundarI sAdhakapuMgavAnAM bhogashcha mokshashcha karastha eva ||

`Where there is worldly enjoyment, there is no salvation; where there is
salvation, there is no worldly enjoyment. For the great worshippers of Sri
Sundari, both worldly enjoyment and salvation are at hand'

The Upasakas of Sri Vidya will get Bhoga and Moksha both. This is
impossible for others because if you want Moksha you cannot have Bhoga and
if you want Bhoga you cannot have Moksha.
