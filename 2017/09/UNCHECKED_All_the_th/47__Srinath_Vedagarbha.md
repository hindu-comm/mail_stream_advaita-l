Saying one do not need tools anymore is different from saying tool does not
exist at all. What you are saying (regarding adhikAri bhEda) is later
version.

More over, you cannot talk in terms of present and future. Remember what
advaita-siddhi kAra has defined mithya as something which is subjected to
negation in ***all three periods*** of time, including period while it is
being perceived. So, even though you seems to perceive so called
"adhikAri-bhEda" now, in actuality it does not exist even now. So, your
argument based on distinction of present/future is toothless.
