You have not understood. To climb mountain if you are strong you can climb
yourself. Otherwise you can take mule and ride on it. Otherwise if you have
enough money you can take a helicopter to the top. But on mountain top you
don't require mule or helicopter or any help. The person without mule,
person with mule and person coming in helicopter all of them are equal on
top. There is Adhikari Bheda before climbing but not after climbing.
