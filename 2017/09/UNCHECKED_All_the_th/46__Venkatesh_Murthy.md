There are two types of accepting something. I can accept something now or I
can accept it in Future. I am accepting Adhikari Bheda now but accepting
there is no Moksha in Future. Now I have to accept Adhikari Bheda and
Moksha both. I am agreeing with Gaudapada in Future only.

It is like a person reaching a mountain top and saying he will not require
the climbing tools and animals like mule on the top. He can move on top
without any help. But a person like you and me we are still climbing and
not reached the top. We require mules and climbing help. You cannot follow
the top person and throw out the help you are getting though you agree with
the top person saying no help is required on top.
