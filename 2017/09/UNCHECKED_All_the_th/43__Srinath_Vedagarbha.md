Keeping aside this silly svakapOlitha story about Shankara and Madhva, this
adhikAri bhEda proponents has to answer this objection --

Is this bhEda tAtvIka or adhyAsa?

It couldn't former, because you as an advaitin you are ill-afford to posit
eternal status to bhEda.

If it is adhyAsa, then you are the loose grounds. You are arguing (and
refuting your opponents) based on imagined non-existing grounds of adhikAra
bhEda. For any vAda to sustain, the hEtu should be accepted as tAtvIka by
both the parties.

I am not even sure this "adhikAri-bhEda" is classical advita argument. But
you know, I am still a student!
