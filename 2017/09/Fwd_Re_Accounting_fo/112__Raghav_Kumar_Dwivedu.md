Namaste Praveen ji
Thank you for the detailed explanation. You wrote

 When अहं ब्रह्म
is analysed, अहम् of the जीव is already understood as not having BMS
upAdhis. So there is nothing left to do but ऐक्य।

A question regarding the above....
As per what you wrote in earlier posts, aikyasamAnAdhikaraNyam alone hold
in *all* cases of analysing the aham brahma sentence irrespective of the
depth of the ahaM pratyaya. (Let us restrict ourselves to only the nirguNam
brahma case for now).

The difference in the depth of the ahaM pratyaya  ( that's a likeable turn
of phrase! ) would only have a bearing on whether you would use
jahallakShaNA or no lakShaNA at all to understand the sentence and not on
whether aikya-sAmAnAdhikaraNyam or bAdhasAmAnAdhikaraNyam obtains between
the two words ahaM and brahma. ( Since it's always aikya even in the
chidAbhAsa case where there are some lingering adhyasta upAdhI-s  ).
This is a bit puzzling since no lakSaNa (where ahaM has already been seen
as free of sharIra upAdhI-s ) would imply that aham brahma is just a
tautology ? Then why even say it.  It would follow that some upAdhi has to
be assumed for ahaM , for it to be claimed that aham brahma generates
knowledge?

The other point... only restating what you said, to check.  In analyzing
jagat as brahma , the kArya totally resolved in to the kAraNa to point of
being absent finally ( in the abhAvam paSyati sense), in such cases alone
it makes sense to talk of bAdhasAmAnAdhikaraNyam.

This is what I understand you to be saying.
