I was only giving a sequence of thinking that can help understand the
aikya, when both sarvaM brahma and ahaM brahma are taken together for
analysis and comparison.

Yes. brahma in the equation is always saguNa brahma. The depth of ahaM
varies at each level, as clearly seen in the upasaMhArabhAShya of 6th
chapter of Chandogya, where Bhashyakara starts with the tvam (aham here
from Shvetaketu's perspective) being uddAlakasya putraH before the 1 out 9
upadeshas and slowly changing to land in lakShyArtha.

Yes.

True, the statement would be unnecessary if you already have lakShyArtha on
both sides. The idea of the equation is to drive home the point that as
they are there is no equation.

It would follow that some upAdhi has to

The assumption here seems to be that there is a process as to what should
take place before the other does. There is no specific sequence on either
side of the equation as to which should be solved first. There is no
applies-to-all manual. So whatever is said in general, thats to show where
it should land. How-to is not exact.

 It depends on the upAdhi that either side of the equation carries.

Precisely so. That applies to ahaMbuddhiH in all upAdhis too, which is
really what sarvaM brahma also is, where sarvaM = jagat = all my sharIrAs
also and brahma = ahaM. Understanding sarvaM brahma = jagat IshvaraH eva
doesn't not help me any, as I opine it to be a selfish pursuit of the jIva
alone and any equation without ahaMpratyayaH is useless for the jIva.

Finally, to stretch this idea, I will always use ahaM as a substitute for
any word brahma anywhere in the shAstras, adding upAdhis if required
; to me, t
his is DSV.
