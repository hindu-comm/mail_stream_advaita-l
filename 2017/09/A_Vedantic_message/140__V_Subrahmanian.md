Today is the Aradhana Day of  the 35th Sringeri Jagadguru Sri Sri Abhinava
Vidyatirtha Mahaswamiji

We are blessed to listen to a rare Anugraha Bhashana of Mahahaswamiji
This message is in Kannada. It is an elucidation of the Vivekachudamani
verse:


Verse 478वेदान्तसिद्धान्तनिरुक्तिरेषा
ब्रह्मैव जीवः सकलं जगच्च ।
अखण्डरूपस्थितिरेव मोक्षो
ब्रह्माद्वितीये श्रुतयः प्रमाणम् ॥ ४७८ ॥

vedāntasiddhāntaniruktireṣā
brahmaiva jīvaḥ sakalaṃ jagacca |
akhaṇḍarūpasthitireva mokṣo
brahmādvitīye śrutayaḥ pramāṇam || 478 ||

478. The verdict of all discussions on the Vedanta is that the Jīva and the
whole universe are nothing but Brahman, and that liberation means abiding
in Brahman, the indivisible Entity. While the Śrutis themselves are
authority (for the statement) that Brahman is One without a second.
