Dear Sri Sreenivasa Murthy

Thanks for your reply.

By the word "brahman", I mean the one and only nirguNa and nirvishesha brahman. 

I am making this clarification because there are some viewpoints that avidya is the material cause of the world OR that brahman needs a shakti to create.

Regards
Kalyan

 //The
 verdict of all discussions on the Vedanta is that the JÄ«va
 and the
 whole
 universe are nothing but Brahman//


 That
 means prakRti is also brahman and there is no shakti that is
 different from brahman and brahman alone is the material and
 instrumental cause of the universe?

 Kalyan
