Dear Sri Kalyan,The answer to your question is an emphatic YES.Mantras 7-25-1 , 7-25-2 & 7-26-1 of Chandogya Upanishad proclaim this.
With warm regards,Sreenivasa Murthy

//The verdict of all discussions on the Vedanta is that the JÄ«va and the
whole universe are nothing but Brahman//


That means prakRti is also brahman and there is no shakti that is different from brahman and brahman alone is the material and instrumental cause of the universe?

Regards
Kalyan
