It is advisable to go only to a Guru who belongs to a line of great
preceptors, is conversant with scriptures, teaches in accordance with the
scriptures, does not propagate a self-discovered path, is a master of his
mind and senses, is dispassionate, whose conduct is spotless, who is
clearly interested in the welfare of the disciple and who does not expect
anything in return from the disciple.
