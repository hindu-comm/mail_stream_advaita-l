Just to clarify, I am not hating anyone, please! I have nothing to gain or lose. I don't 'hate' vivarana. I don't 'hate' any person whatsoever.

Namaste

Name dropping is useless. So and so said Appayya is not following Advaita
is useless. We have the intelligence to see who is following Advaita and
who is not following. We are not sheep and not parrots to repeat some
Bhashya words. Parrots can only repeat but they cannot understand. To
understand we have to analyse Bhashyas and Vyakhyana Karas did that.

Person hating Appayya thinking he is from Vivarana is ignorant about
Appayya's Parimala -

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appayya_Dikshita

It is a Vedantic work, an extremely readable commentary on the very
difficult commentary called Kalpataru
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalpataru> by an advaitic teacher named
Amalananda <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amalananda>. That Kalpataru is
itself a commentary on *Bhāmatī
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bh%C4%81mat%C4%AB>* by Vācaspati Miśra
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V%C4%81caspati_Mi%C5%9Bra>, which in turn is
the famous commentary on the *Sutra-Bhashya* of Adi Shankara
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adi_Shankara>.
