​Thanks for your honesty here. In any case, I don't think you are lacking
qualities, but only openness towards sub-commentators. Even that wouldn't
have been an issue, hadn't your focus been to quote their negativity only
instead of samanvaya, being a little considerate towards those who don't
like to read that, just as you wouldn't want to read something ill talked
of your paramaguru. I prefer Bhashyakara's approach of accepting even
opponents' views unopposed to siddhAnta, let alone prakriyAbhedas in our
own siddhAnta.

​Neither do I consider anyone as an enemy nor do I have ill-wishes towards
anyone. Its against my prayer of sarve bhavantu sukhinaH.​
