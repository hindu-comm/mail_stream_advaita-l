Dear Sri Venkateshji This is a tricky situation. If we do not look at the flaws of the guru, then we might accept even gurus like Nityananda and Ram Rahim. Even these fraud gurus might have lot of positives. And they might also claim some parampara.

And they have the good line of followers as well, most of them well  educated, wealthy, English speaking people :-) I was seeing one of the devotees (disciple) of controversial bAba,  who caught in the rape case, defending his guru's act by citing some shloka-s from geeta and other taNtra shAstra-s explained how this could be the act of initiation (deeksha) which has been misinterpreted by those who do not know the subtleties of gurupadesha and guru deeksha !! :-)  And as a matter of fact with his name, a  big list  of degrees has been suffixed :-) The lawyer too who supporting his client was a famous criminal lawyer freely dragging all shAstra-s and dharma in that debate :-) 

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
