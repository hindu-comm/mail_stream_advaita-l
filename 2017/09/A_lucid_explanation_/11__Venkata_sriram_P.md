Dear Subbu-ji,

Why this simple & profound meaning couldn't be comprehended by v.advaita & dvaita acharyas ?

What could be the reason for misunderstandings among the scholars?

How beautiful it would have been if all the acharyas stand on a single platform and 
accept a single / universal philosophy without quarrelling among themselves.

Just thinking aloud ...

regs,
sriram
