every ignorant person will be comfortable with ‘incompleteness’, isn’t it?.

If the above is not a fact, from where the attraction towards likings and
aversion towards the dislikes come? >>,



All these come later to and consequences of the fundamental wrong
understanding of “ I “ itself.   Improper understanding of “ I “ is the
fundamental adhyAsa. All others are consequential to it.  SamsAra cannot be
overcome along with its roots  by any logic  or reasoning.  Correct
understanding of “ I “ is the necessary and sufficient condition for
escaping from samsAra along with its roots. That correct understanding is
achieved ONLY through shravana/manana/nididhyasana.  This is the Sidhanta
cryptically stated  through the verse
