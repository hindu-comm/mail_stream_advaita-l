'Meditate on this visual daily in the morning and before bed for 60 days to
experience miraculous benefits.
Sri Chakra or Sri Yantra is a diagramatic representation like a map of the
Complete Nerve Plexus of the body (Marma points). It is a known fact that
spiritual realization occurs when the consciousness enters a 'hole' like
region in the heart chakra , resulting in blissful and ego-free state.'
