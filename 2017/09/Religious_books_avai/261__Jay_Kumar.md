Namaste to all.



One of my close friend, a senior financial professional at Bangalore is
keenly interested to buy books on

1.      Garuda Puranam with elaborate analysis & Commentary, preferably
verse by verse  meaning   in English., 

2.      Yajur Veda : Detail analysis, Discussion and / or  Commentary in
English.



I request our group members to post the required information or let me know
the availability details so that I can pass on the same to my friend.

Thanks & Regards,

Jayakumar
