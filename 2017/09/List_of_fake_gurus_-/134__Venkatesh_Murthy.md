Namaste

Kerala is moving to Zero Hindu population with Huge Gulf money flowing in
and Huge Church money and anti Hindu activities of Communists. The three
forces will make Hindu population smaller and smaller. It is a race between
Kerala and West Bengal which one will become 100% non Hindu faster. Even
today only 1.76% of Kerala population is Brahmins.
