PraNAms
The list does not include in Hindu-Gurus - even though they do not use the word, Guru. There are lot of them in Kerala trying to convert people to their group.

 Namaste,

The Apex Body of Hindu Sadhus - Akhil Bharatiya Akhada Parishad (ABAP) has released list of fake sadhus and this would be updated further.

//////////

https://in.yahoo.com/news/ram-rahim-asaram-hindu-sadhus-034053079.html

///////////

Here are the 14 self-styled godmen, who have made it to the list:

•  Asaram Bapu (Asumal Sirumalani)
•  Sukhbinder Kaur (Radhe Maa)
•  Sachchidanand Giri (Sachin Datta)
•  Gurmeet Singh of Dera Sacha Sauda
•  Om Baba (Vivekanand Jha)
•  Nirmal Baba (Nirmaljeet Singh)
•  Ichchadhari Bhimanand (Shivmurti Dwivedi)
•  Swami Asimanand
•  Om Namah Shivay Baba
•  Narayan Sai
•  Rampal
•  Acharya Kushmuni
•  Brahaspati Giri
•  Malkhan Singh

I have few more to add like Ramananda Maharishi, Somnath Maharishi, Sri Sri Ravi Sankar, Brahmarishi Subhash Patri etc. who proclaim themselves not less than Maharishi & Brahmarishi. 

The list would be further updated after due discussions in Kasi. 

The self-styled gurus have risen like mushrooms in every nook & corner. Innocent & gullible people need to be careful in future. Considering the today's environment, one's best gurus are mother, father, gayatri mantra and acharya sankara bhagavatpada. 

regs,
sriram
