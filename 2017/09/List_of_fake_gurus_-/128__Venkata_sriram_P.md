Namaste,

The Apex Body of Hindu Sadhus - Akhil Bharatiya Akhada Parishad (ABAP) has released list of fake sadhus and this would be updated further.

//////////

https://in.yahoo.com/news/ram-rahim-asaram-hindu-sadhus-034053079.html

///////////

Here are the 14 self-styled godmen, who have made it to the list:

•    Asaram Bapu (Asumal Sirumalani)
•    Sukhbinder Kaur (Radhe Maa)
•    Sachchidanand Giri (Sachin Datta)
•    Gurmeet Singh of Dera Sacha Sauda
•    Om Baba (Vivekanand Jha)
•    Nirmal Baba (Nirmaljeet Singh)
•    Ichchadhari Bhimanand (Shivmurti Dwivedi)
•    Swami Asimanand
•    Om Namah Shivay Baba
•    Narayan Sai
•    Rampal
•    Acharya Kushmuni
•    Brahaspati Giri
•    Malkhan Singh

I have few more to add like Ramananda Maharishi, Somnath Maharishi, Sri Sri Ravi Sankar, Brahmarishi Subhash Patri etc. who proclaim themselves not less than Maharishi & Brahmarishi.  

The list would be further updated after due discussions in Kasi.  

The self-styled gurus have risen like mushrooms in every nook & corner.  Innocent & gullible people need to be careful in future. Considering the today's environment, one's best gurus are mother, father, gayatri mantra and acharya sankara bhagavatpada.  

regs,
sriram
