Whether fake or not, all of them are equally innocent about Brahman. Is there anyone who has attained Yogic siddhis? If not, then what's the distinction between fake and genuine?

Namaste
Some people may not agree Sri Sri Ravi Sankar is fake. Many priests are
trained in his Ashram and I have seen some temples calling them for Homas
and Pujas. He also has found one very good breathing exercise Sudarshana
Kriya. It is very good for controlling sugar level in blood and Diabetes
and other diseases. Some research done on that breathing Kriya showed brain
gets same joy feeling like the Climax in Sexual Intercourse. But there is
no Retas Skhalana. Therefore it protects Brahmacharya and gives joy to
Brain.
