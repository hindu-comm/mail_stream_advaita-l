Namaste all,

Currently I am referring to Rashtriya Sanskrit Samsthan book
Saundaryalahari (with commentaries in Sanskrit) which has ten commentaries.
Since I have borrowed it from someone and need to return it in couple of
days, would anyone know if a soft copy is available online? I couldn't find
the same in archive.org.

Would someone also guide me if all Rashtriya Sanskrit Samsthan books can be
bought online?

Thanks,
--Praveen Bhat
