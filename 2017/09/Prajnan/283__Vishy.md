Poojya Sadaji,

Pranams

In mahavaakya " Prajnanan Bramha"  what exactly Prjana is?? I mean in comman man's language...

1. Is it " Consciousness" or is it " Energy" or can I say " Conscious Energy"? to make it ONE
2.can I say : Consciousness is " Purusha" and energy is " Prakruthi" and all living beings are product of both??
3.can I say this product of both as Prajna??
And as you explained in your past series on " Tat Tvam Asi" ,this Prajna is Tat, right??

namaskaras
Viswanath
