Namaste
I wished to know if there are other traditional biographies which are
regarded as authoritative, apart from the Sankara digvijaya. And if so,
whether there are any online resources regarding them.

Any other good biographical reference material on shri shankara.

Any links to previous  discussions on this in this forum are also welcome

Thank you
Om
Raghav
