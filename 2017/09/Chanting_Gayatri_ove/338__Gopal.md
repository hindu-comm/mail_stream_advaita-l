Namaste,

in the same line of info given by sri chandramouli, please visit:
http://ananthsvedagroup.org/ from the DC area.  Sri Anantha Krishnan, an
ardent shishya of Sri Sringeri mutt Mahaswamins of 3 generations can be
contacted from the 'contact' link with any questions. He has been
practicing vaideeka dharma and more specifically veda paata, for around 5
decades in this "mlecchaa, non-varna ashrama-installed, decadent, adharmic,
rap-listening-pizza-eating-unrestrained" country (sarcasm intended with in
quotes for humor!).  HOpe you would get some pointers.  Another  source
would be  Sri Vidyashanker of this list.    In addition, Sri Sadaji, an
acharya resident of DC area and associated with chinmaya mission who leads
many discussions on this list, could be of a personal source of
clarifications..

I would also like to quote from an article (
https://ruthaavaree.files.wordpress.com/2015/05/musings-on-rig-veda-mantras_final.pdf)
that I wrote based on writings from Sri Aurobindo,Sri Kapali Sastry and Sri
Kashyap a temple souvenir.  In any of the texts quoted here that I have
read and also the mula mantra samhita paata, that I have (with my miniscule
knowledge and intelligence) come across qualifications of a vidhyaarthi
based on geography!   Like  Vidhya devi tells the rishi as quoted by
Yakshaacharya and later by Sayana,  the qualifications for veda  mantra
artha anubhava are more subtler and psychological  not liked to GPS..  just
my humble thought on your query. Forgive me for any imprudence:

1)    .."Brhat Devatā –  compendium of vedic gods by rishi Shaunaka -
states the qualifications of such a rishi who has the mantra drishti : “a
mantra is not perceptible to one who is not a rishi. He who knows Gods
knows the riks. They are  to be approached through Yoga (yogena) with -
clear understanding (daakshyena), selfcontrol (damena), skill and general
knowledge (baahu shruthyena) and above all with tapasyā ” (Brihat Devatā
8:129-130 as  translated by Sri Kapali Sastry). Only to such a sādhaka – a
rishi - a drishtā, that Mother vāk chooses to reveal the Truth :   uto
tvasmai tanvaṃ visasre jāyeva patya uśati suvāsāḥ - (she) reveals to the
one she chooses to, just as a loving wife, beautifully dressed, reveals her
body (only) to her husband (RV 10:71:4b)”.

2)  ....These mahāpurushās should be considered as rishis to whom vāk chose
to reveal Her Truths so that the glory and eternity of mantras can be
re-invigorated for the Man to call and invoke the devatās for worship
without any doubt or exaggeration. There is a cue to this earlier in Rig
Veda:“ rÉÑaÉå devānāṃ nu vayaṃ jānā pra vocāma vipanyayā /
uktheśuśasyamāneśu yaḥ paśyāduttare yuge – Let us proclaim with Light the
Hosts of Gods That one may see them when these hymns are chanted in the
future ages” declared a rishi in RV 10:72.1. Obviously the devatās are to
be seen  – pashyema, as one trains the inner faculties to sense their
Presence during worship – whether by the shores of river Saraswathi in Rig
vedic times or by the river Potomac much later.

thanks
