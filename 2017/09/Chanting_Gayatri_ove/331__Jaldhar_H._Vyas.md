There is a theory in dharmashastra that only bharatavarsha is the 
karmabhumi (but what are the limits of Bharata?  The current Republic of 
India is considerably smaller than its historical extent.) and therefore 
mantras do not have any efficacy outside its limits.

For myself and my son, we do sandhyavandana and Gayatri japa without fail 
despite living in America.  Bhagavan can decide if it has merit or not; we 
shall continue doing our duty without expecting any particular phala.
