Dear Mr. Santosh,

I would second Mr Vyas's point.
In addition there are some smriti texts that 
seem absolute in their exhortation for dvijas to perform nityakarmas. For example, 
the Daksha smriti says that one who neglects sandhyavandana becomes unclean and unfit to perform any ritual, and it makes no exception to those who are overseas.
