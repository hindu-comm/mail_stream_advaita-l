Worth a read especially for the stressed out ! A beautiful thought....

A SPLITTING HEADACHE...

The proprietor of a coffee shop had been busy all day. Being Saturday, it
was very crowded and the customers were just unending. He had been on his
toes since morning.
Towards the evening he felt a splitting headache surfacing. As the clock
ticked away, his headache worsened. Unable to bear it, he stepped out of
the shop leaving his staff to look after the sales.

He walked across the street to the Chemist, to buy himself a painkiller to
relieve his headache. He swallowed the pill and felt relieved. He knew that
in a few minutes he would feel better.
As he strolled out of the shop, he casually asked the salesgirl, "Where is
Mr Savarkar (the Chemist)? He's not at the cash counter today!" The girl
replied, "Sir, Mr Savarkar had a splitting headache and said he was going
across to the coffee shop. He said a cup of hot coffee would relieve him of
his headache."
 The man's mouth went dry and he mumbled, "Oh! I see."

This is a typical case of looking outside ourselves for something that we
have within us. How strange but true! The chemist relieves his headache by
drinking coffee and the coffee shop owner finds relief in a pain relieving
pill!

A man hunts across the lengths and breadths of the universe to find peace.
Eventually he finds it in his heart and realizes that peace is really a
state of mind. He undertakes many a pilgrimage to find God. Eventually he
realizes that God is the in- dweller of the heart. 👍🏻👍🏻👌🏻👌🏻
