//In the bruhadaaraNyaka Upanishad mantra bhAshya (2-1-20) , bhagavatpAda observes that there is no disagreement among the followers of the vedAnta / Upanishads with regard to the 'ikyamatya' uniformity  of vedAnta siddhAnta pertaining to the identity of the jeevaatma and the paramAtma. //

Dear Sri Bhaskar-ji

The bhedAbheda school of Vedanta is as old as advaita, if not older. 

Even Shankara criticizes views of other earlier upanishad commentators like BhartRprapancha and these others were not advaitins.

It is therefore incorrect to hold that advaita was the only original philosophy of all vedAntins.

Kalyan
