​​Namaste,

//Quote
To be sure, there were also pre-Sankaran representatives of non-advaita
vedAnta traditions, many of whom seem to have been *bhedAbheda-vAdins* of
one kind or the other - proponents of a doctrine of identity-in-difference.
Chief among them are the names of auDulomi, Asmarathya (both mentioned in
the brahmasUtras), bhartRprapanca, brahmadatta, bhartRmitra and bodhAyana.
//Unquote

With that in the background, what is important​ to note though is that just
as Bhashyakara dismisses the non-Vedanta traditions as they end in duality,
he also dismisses some Advaita-ending schools of thought since jnAnena
muktiH is compromised in them. samucchaya- or upAsana-prApyamuktiH is
anityA and so, siddAntaviruddhaH.

However, jnAnena avidyAnivRttiH and thereby advaitamuktiH is not
compromised by any sub-commentators of bhAShya, and therefore, they are
mere prakriyAbhedas and not tattvabhedas. This fact cannot be stressed
enough.
