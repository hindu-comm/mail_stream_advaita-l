I particularly feel that the fundamental reasoning used by Bhashyakara for
dismissal of all other Vaidika (not only Vedanta) schools of thoughts is
applicable to the later Vedanta schools also. The depth being quite
different though, through navyanyAya, that is handled by the juggernauts in
the form of Sriharshacharya, Chitsukhacharya and Madhusudanacharya.

The basic foundation of ekavAkyatA of Shruti and arthApatti of
impossibility of mokSha otherwise can potentially overthrow erroneous
conclusion of all Vaidika opponents. On a related note, I wonder what other
Vedanta schools of thought use for tAparyanishchaya instead of the
ShaDliMgas of Advaita Vedantins.

Kind rgds,
