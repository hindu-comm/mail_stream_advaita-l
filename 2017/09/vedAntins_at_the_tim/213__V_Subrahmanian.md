Here is a study on the Bodhayana-Upavarsha topic:

Nothing final arises from the study.

In BSB 2.1.14 a certain bhedābheda vāda is refuted. The identity of
jiva-Brahman is admitted by that vādin in the mokṣa state but not in the
bandha state. In that school both bheda in bandha and abheda in moksha are
absolute. In the 2.2 of BSB however, the schools refuted are all
non-vedantic. I have cited a Taittiriya Bhashya passage of Shankara where
he declares that he, the monist, is the lone representative of the Vedanata
and is faced with a number of non-monists who are outside the Vedanta.  The
subcommentator in the Br.Up.bhasya (if I remember right) has identified a
purvapaksha as Bhartruprapanchamatam.

In the Thangaswami research work on Advaita Vedanta literature, on p.191,
on Upavarsha it is stated that the view of the Vishistadvaitins identifying
Upavarsha with Bodhayana is incorrect. He considers Upavarsha as a
vrittikara that Shankara alludes to. In this book Bhartrpraoancha is stated
to be a bhedābhedavādin but not as an author of a vritti on the
Brahmasutra. He is believed to have written commentaries on Br.up. and
Kathopanishat. Shankara alludes to him as 'aupanishadmmanyaḥ', a derogatory
term to mean: one who thinks he is a follower of the Upanishad.
