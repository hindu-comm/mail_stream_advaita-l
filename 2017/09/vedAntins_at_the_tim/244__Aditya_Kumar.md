With that in the background, what is importantâ€‹ to note though is that just
as Bhashyakara dismisses the non-Vedanta traditions as they end in duality,
he also dismisses some Advaita-ending schools of thought since jnAnena
muktiH is compromised in them. samucchaya- or upAsana-prApyamuktiH is
anityA and so, siddAntaviruddhaH.


However, jnAnena avidyAnivRttiH and thereby advaitamuktiH is not
compromised by any sub-commentators of bhAShya, and therefore, they are
mere prakriyAbhedas and not tattvabhedas. This fact cannot be stressed
enough.

Thanks for the brand new definition of prakriya bedha.
