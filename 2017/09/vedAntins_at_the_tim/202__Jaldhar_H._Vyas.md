I don't agree.  Vaishnavism and  and Shaivism had a long independent 
history.  One of the arguments that Shankaracharya makes in the 
chaturvyuhadhikarana is that the pancharatra agamas are non-Vedic 
therefore non-authoritative.  At some later point there was an effort made 
to align themselves with Vedanta.  For instance it is Yamuna the 
predecessor of Ramanuja who attempts to make the case that pancharatra 
agamas are Vedic (i.e. Vedantic.)

Again I disagree.  Somewhat anyway. If we restrict Samkhya to 
Ishvarakrishna then yes it is non-theistic but theistic samkhya can be 
found in the bhagavadgita, mokshadharma and elsewhere in itihasa/puranas. 
And what is Yoga if not Samkhya + Ishvara?

However it should be conceded that the Samkhya concept of Ishvara is not 
acceptable to Vedantins of any stripe.
