Just cursorily read thru the book by Sri Srinivasachari on the
BhEdAbhEdavAda of Sri Bhaskaracharya. He (Sri Bhaskaracharya)  also bases
his vAda on Shrutis and employs the ShaDliMgas technique only. But the
Shruti vAkyAs he prefers for arriving at his conclusions and of course, the
interpretations of some of the vAkyAs  are different from those of Sri
Bhagavatpada.
