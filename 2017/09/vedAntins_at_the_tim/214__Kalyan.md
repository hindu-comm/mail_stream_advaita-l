 //I have cited a Taittiriya Bhashya passage of Shankara where he declares that he, the monist, is the lone representative of the Vedanata and is faced with a number of non-monists who are outside the Vedanta. The subcommentator in the Br.Up.bhasya (if I remember right) has identified a purvapaksha as Bhartruprapanchamatam.//

But we know that Bhartrprapancha was also a vedAntin. Shankara's claim is typical of all schools. Every school thinks that it is the true vedAntic school. Viewed in this light, Shankara's claim does not provide us any historical information about existence of other vedAntic schools at his time. But his criticism of earlier commentators shows that such schools existed.


//In the Thangaswami research work on Advaita Vedanta literature, on p.191, on Upavarsha it is stated that the view of the Vishistadvaitins identifying Upavarsha with Bodhayana is incorrect.He considers Upavarsha as a vrittikara that Shankara alludes to.//


Ok. I myself am not sure if this identification is correct.


 //In this book Bhartrpraoancha is stated to be a bhedābhedavādin but not as an author of a vritti on the Brahmasutra.//


Narayana Panditacharya, the biographer of Madhva counts BhartRprapancha as a commentator on the brahmasutras.

 Vishishthadvaitins hold
 that Bodhayana is the same as Upavarsha, that Shankara

 esteem, even though their schools are different, so it
 cannot be claimed for certain that Upavarsha was an
 advaitin.



 Narayana Panditacharya, the biographer of Madhva, refers to
 a vrittikAra as one of the commentators on BS. Bodhayana or
 Upavarsha (whether or not they are the same person) could be
 this vrittikAra.

 Here is a study on the
 Bodhayana-Upavarsha topic:

 Nothing final arises from the
 study.

  which is however missing now.



 //The schools thatShankara refutes in the second
 chapter of BSB are allnon-Vedantic//



 This does not prove anything. Bhartrprapancha, a
 bhedAbhedavAdin, has written a commentary on BS (according
 to Narayana Panditacharya) and I dont remember that he is
 refuted by Shankara in the second chapter. Just because no
 other vedantic school was refuted by Shankara in the 2nd
 chapter, it does not mean that there was no other vedantic
 school at the time of Shankara.

 In BSB 2.1.14 a certain bhedābheda
 vāda is refuted. The identity of jiva-Brahman is admitted
 by that vādin in the mokṣa state but not in the bandha
 state. In that school both bheda in bandha and abheda in
 moksha are absolute. In the 2.2 of BSB however, the schools
 refuted are all non-vedantic. I have cited a Taittiriya
 Bhashya passage of Shankara where he declares that he, the
 monist, is the lone representative of the Vedanata and is
 faced with a number of non-monists who are outside the
 Vedanta. The subcommentator in the Br.Up.bhasya (if I
 remember right) has identified a purvapaksha as
 Bhartruprapanchamatam. 
 In the Thangaswami research work on
 Advaita Vedanta literature, on p.191, on Upavarsha it is
 stated that the view of the Vishistadvaitins identifying
 Upavarsha with Bodhayana is incorrect. He considers
 Upavarsha as a vrittikara that Shankara alludes to. In this
 book Bhartrpraoancha is stated to be a bhedābhedavādin but
 not as an author of a vritti on the Brahmasutra. He is
 believed to have written commentaries on Br.up. and
 Kathopanishat. Shankara alludes to him as
 'aupanishadmmanyaḥ', a derogatory term to mean:
 one who thinks he is a follower of the
 Upanishad.
