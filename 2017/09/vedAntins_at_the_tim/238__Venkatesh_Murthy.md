Simply saying Yukti you cannot say you are using Yukti. Your friend is
repeating like a parrot Bhashya statements without understanding them
correctly and you are repeating second hand arguments from academic nuts
and others. Where is your original Yukti here? None. If you read
Traditional scholars there is a lot of Yukti in them at every step. They
are not asking us to follow them in blind faith. But you will not read them
in original Sanskrit because you cannot understand it. Therefore simply
repeat some wrong translations.
