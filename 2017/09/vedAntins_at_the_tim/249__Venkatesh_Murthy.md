Namaste

Adi Sankara has said Paramatam Apratishiddham Anumatam Bhavati and accepted
Yoga Shastra on Five Vrttis of Mind in 2-4-12. He has practically agreed
with Bhagavata followers in the Sutra Bhashya 2-2-42 on Supremacy of Narayana
and importance of Bhakti and Araadhana to Narayana. If he is so
uncompromising why he is allowing Bhakti instead of Jnana? He has showed so
much leniency to other Matas and he will be uncompromising to Prakriyas in
his own school? This is a joke.
