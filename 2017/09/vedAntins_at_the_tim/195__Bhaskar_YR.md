wasn't Nyaya / Vaisheshika Vedic ? any reason why you categorized as avaidika mata ?

praNAms Sri Ravi Kiran prabhuji

Though nyAya vaisheshika along with sAnkhya yOga listed under Astika darshana-s, they are tArkika-s and their doctrine not strictly in line with vedAnta.  Hence bhAshyakAra takes them as pUrva paxi-s at various places.  aNu, pradhAna, the establishment of existence of Ishwara through tarka, independent existence to purusha, Ishwara, prakruti,  attributing infiniteness to all three etc. not in line with vedAnta.  And for the vAda with vedAntins, the followers of these schools uses veda only by not taking the veda as svatantra pramANa whereas for the vedAntins shAstra is the antya and svatantra pramANa unlike these schools.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
