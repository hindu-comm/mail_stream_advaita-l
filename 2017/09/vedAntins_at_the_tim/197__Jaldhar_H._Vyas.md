Technically both these statements are true.

There are (and were) several different varieties of bhedabhedavada but 
they all agree that jivatma and paramatma are identical on some level. 
(That's the abheda part.) Where they differ from Advaitavada is that they 
do not think the two are _completely_ equivalent. (That's the bheda part.)

Completely dualistic schools of Vedanta are a relatively recent 
development.  The only dualists in early times were Samkhyas.  It is they 
that Shankaracharya is contrasting with "followers of the Upanishads."
