 Just thought of clarifying what I am saying. Although Bhartrprapancha is

So why didn't Shankara consider it as mere prakriya bedha? In Bhamati and
Vivarana too, Bhamati requires manas-shuddhi for aparoksha jnana which is
nothing but moksha. How is this prakriya bedha and not Bhartrprapancha's
view?
