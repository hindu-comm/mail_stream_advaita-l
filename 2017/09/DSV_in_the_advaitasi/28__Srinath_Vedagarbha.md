Who said dreams are due to jIva's dRShTi?

Shruti is quite clear on the source of svapnAvasTha;


1. Br. Upa -- swapnEna shArIramabhi prahatyAsuptaH suptAnabhi chAkaShIti,
shukramAdAya punarEti stAnam hiraNmayaH puruShaH Eka-haMsaH

2. In another instance the same Br.U clearly saying Deva creates
vaasanamaya swapna padArthas by taking various small & large forms, sports
with stree forms and sees jIva-s in scare of scary objects of dream.

"swapnAnta uchAvachamIyamAnO rupANi dEvaH kurutE bahUni, utEva steebhiH
saha mOdamAnO jakshadutEvApi *bhayAni pashyan*"

3. The same theme is asserted in another  Upa  "na tatra ratha-yOgA na
panthAnO bhavanti, atha rathAn rathayOgAn pathaH srujatE, sa hI kartha "

(in swapna, initially there will not be chariots, nor paths. Swapna kartha
Brahman creates the cahriots, paths etc for the jIva)

4. Same Brahman Who creates the swapnAdi avsta-s controlls those very
avasta-traya states of the jIva.  Br.Upa says "sa vA Esha Etasmin swapnAntE
ratvAcharitvA driStAiva puNyam pApam cha punaH pratinyAyam pratiyOnyA
dravati budhAntAaiva"

(This paramaatma only moves between jIva's swana and shuspti avastas,
witnessing jIva's puNya and paapa, again bringing him to jaagrata avasta)
