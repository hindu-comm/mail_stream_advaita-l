Namaste Anandji,

Thanks for a wonderful explanation of these interesting topics in AS.
However, I have a question:

In SDV, we could say that vyAvahArika is higher than the prAtibhAsika and
pAramArthika higher than vyAvahArika, but in DSV will we not be stating
only two?
And s
ince the objection is to the DSV perspective of things, what would mean by
a higher or a lower order of reality? That would mean that prAtibhAsika
cannot sublate pAramArthika, but can sublate anything prAtibhAsika,
including what is considered vyAvahArika since the latter is not higher
order of reality
 at all
.
 
Is that a fair statement?

Kind rgds,
