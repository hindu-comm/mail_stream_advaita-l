Saying "two vRittis that have contents of each other" itself is a piece of
knowledge, who's knowledge is this? That begs again the need for
consciousness delimited by vritti.  You are back to original anavastha
dOSha.

You can get away with this problem if you were to admit one of those two
vRittis is svaprakASha and hence svayam-nirvahaka in serving this knowledge
without need of Consciousness. But by saying so, you will end up with two
conscious entities -- the original Conscious and this vRitti with
svaprakAShatva.

Just as in a dream there is a vRtti-jnAna of an object (example, pot) and
its anuvyavasAya vRtti, i.e. jnAna of the form "I know the pot" (ghaTam
ahaM jAnAmi), without the need for a third vRtti, in DSV too, these two
kinds of vRttis are sufficient for knowledge of an object and its
awareness/experience. The vRttis arise from avidyA, which is one of the six
anAdi entities admitted to be outside the scope of DSV type of creation. So
there is no anavasthA.
