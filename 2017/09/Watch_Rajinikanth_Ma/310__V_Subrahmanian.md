The sentiment that one should do good to society is praise worthy, but not
the cost of actual tatva. Do you teach kids falsehood even if it is sweeter
to them?


What you call 'actual' tattva is what is disputed.

But again, in such article one needs to evaluate balAbala of quoted
pramANa-s (if anything at all). No need to jump to conclusion just because
a article appears it is established fact.


The fact that such an article appeared in a Madhwa journal is what I
reported.

That does not mean we should ignore real intent of Sri Raghavendra Swami
and applause those talking politically correct dialog in  a movie.

Your original claim should have been "A treat to the heart. A Tamil actor
acting as Madhwa scholar brings out Hari-Hara abheda in a Tamil movie".
This would have been more honest reporting and less misleading to others.


The title suggested by you does not change what title I have given. That it
is a movie, acted by Rajnikanth is clear.
By the way, Rajnikanth gave 10 crore donation to Mantralaya Temple:

//According to a press note from the temple authorities, the old buildings
to the rear of the Sarvagnya Mandir would be dismantled and 25 fresh A/C
cottages and 100 general rooms would be constructed, using the amount
donated by Rajini.//

The movie came in 1985, the donation was made much later. The Temple has no
objection to the portrayal in the movie.

//Few dacades back Actor Rajani Kanth took Rayaru Message which was
reverbarating in every nook and corner of Tamilnadu . I considered it as a
great contribution done by him to our system which we did not do. //

//I do not see religious leaders in our community who command respect from
all Madhwa people.

EVEN TO SPREAD THE MESSAGE OF RAGHAVENDRA SWAMY FROM 1970s till DATE, DR
RAJKUMAR, AN IDIGA BY BIRTH IN KARNATAKA & RAJNIKANTH, A MARATHI SPEAKING
KHSATHRIYA IN TAMILNADU percieved to have done more than MADHWA MUTTs /
COMMUNITY.//

//I remember in a very small town near Vridhachalam in Tamilnadu Rajani's
Raghavendrar was screened and even ordinary people but admirers of Gurugalu
were seeing the movie ,which I can never forget in my life AND REMEMBER THE
ACTOR ALWAYS with admiration.
LET US SEE THE POSITIVE SIDE OF THE THINGS AND IF POSSIBLE CONTRIBUTE FOR
ITS IMPROVEMENT.//
