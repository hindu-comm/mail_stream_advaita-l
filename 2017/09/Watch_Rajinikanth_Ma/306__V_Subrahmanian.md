It is not that I am unaware of the above. Yet what is depicted in the movie
is good to the society. By the way, some years ago I happened to see a
cover page title: 'hari-hara bheda salladu'  on  a Kannada journal named
'mukhyaprāṇa'.  I could not read the article, though, at that time. Nor
could I access the copy later.

Also, we have to keep in mind the fact that Sri Raghavendra is very popular
among Tamils, both brahmin and non-brahmin. Most do not know his philosophy
or his works. They look upon him as a miracle man.
