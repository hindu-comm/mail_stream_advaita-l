Namaste

Even today there is a Siva Linga in Mantralaya. Maadhwas believe it is very
ancient and Prahlada worshipped it before. Raayaru is
Prahlada Avatara according to them. It means Raayaru also was Siva Bhakta.
He may be Vishnu Bhakta but he is Siva Bhakta also. Otherwise why did he
choose that particular spot with Siva Linga in Mantralaya? Fanatic Madhwas
cannot answer this question but the broad minded can answer it properly.

*Outside Lord Hanuman temple on the right side we can also find the
presence of Lord Shiva in the form of Shiva Linga. It is believed and said
that it was found while excavating the spot for Brindavana at Mantralayam
and said to have been worshiped by Prahlada Rayaru in Krita Yuga.*
