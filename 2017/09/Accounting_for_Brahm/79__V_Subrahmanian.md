Dear All,

I think the various views/understandings expressed in this thread can be
reconciled.  In the book 'Sridakṣiṇāmūrtistotram Vol.1, on page 506 us a
subtitle: 6.6.14 Interpetation of the Mahavakya - Jahallakṣaṇā. There the
method is stated thus:

//In the school which speaks in terms of the ābhāsavāda prakriyā, the
primary senses of 'That' and 'thou' are taken either as ābhā-aviviktam
chaitanyam, i.e, Consciousness as not distinguished from the apparent
consciousness or as chidaviviktābhāsaḥ, i.e., the apparent consciousness as
not distinguished from the Consciousness, as pointed out by the
Nyāyaratnāvalī on the Siddhāntabindu (1). In the first case, the Mahāvākya
is to be understood by having recourse to partial abandonment i.e., the
bhāgatyāgalakṣaṇā as has been delineated above. In the second case,
however, it is to be understood by having recourse to the jahallakṣaṇā
i.e., the total abandonment of the primary senses of the words 'That' and
'thou' by pointing to the Consciousness that is the Substratum. On
sublation of what is illusorily regarded in parlance as the meaning of the
word 'thou', the Substratum that is the Consciousness, stands out. So also
in the case of the meaning of the word 'That.'//

It is this sublation, bādha, that is meant by 'apavāda' in the BSB 3.3.9
(that I had cited earlier). The Bhāṣyaratnaprabhā says:
बुद्धिपूर्वकाभेदारोपोऽध्यासः,
बाधोऽपवादः.  The wrong identity with body-mind complex is given up through
right knowledge and the substratum Chit becomes apparent. The contingency
of 'aham nāsmi' too does not arise. This I understand is the same as sarvam
(jagat) brahma where the jagat is negated and the Substratum Brahman alone
stands out. The difference between bhāgatyāga.. and jahallak....is that in
the former the adhyasta part is given up, tyakta and the anandhyasta part
is retained. In the latter there is no recognition of parts (bhāga) and the
entire anubhūta vastu is given up which by itself gives place for the
substratum to come to the limelight. This is in agreement with what is
articulated by Sri SSS:  <<  The way the understanding of the nature “ this
stalk of a tree is a man only “ by a person completely negates the idea of
the tree stalk, the  understanding  “I am Brahman “ completely negates the
idea of “ I “( aham )  ( in anAtma, anything else ) >>.

I think the difference between the two lakṣaṇās lies in the way the
Acharyas have presented the thought; the end-result does not change.

warm regards
subbu
