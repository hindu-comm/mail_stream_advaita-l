Joke can be turned back to you. If everything like a Jada Vastu Pot is
Brahman for you why not the Bhranta Jeeva also. That Bhranta Jeeva also is
Brahman only because in this Universe there is nothing but Brahman only.
Brahman is Jada, He is Chetana Vastu, Jnani and Bhranta also. Therefore let
Bhranta Jeeva Brahman create everything and become even more Bhranta. But
he is still Brahman only.
