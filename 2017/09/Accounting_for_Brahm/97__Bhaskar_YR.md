Yes, none is questioning that ..seems you have not gone through the thread series ..question is how would you do samanvaya based on  sAmAnAdhikaraNya and lakshaNa nirUpaNa ?

praNAms
Hare Krishna

Still not able to understand your queryâ€¦perhaps not reading the entire thread is the reason.  Would you mind if I ask you to elaborate your query with more details prabhuji??  Hope you are not asking about sAmAnAdhikAraNyaM with regard to sarvaM and brahma ( both are in same vibhakti).  Shankara clarifies how both sarvaM and brahma to be treated and how brahman is prapanchOpashamanaM.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
