You may want to revisit the thread history as it has been discussed
threadbare and my query was pertinent to the particular thread response
posted, from where you picked up only a part of it and trying to restart
the wheel :)  In case, you are still interested after reading through the
entire thread, we can discuss offline, so that it wont be a repeat for all
:)

On a related note on sarvaM, you may refer the bhAshya for Br. Up 5.1.1 -
pūrṇamadaḥ pūrṇamidaṃ..

अतः अदःशब्दवाच्यं पूर्णं ब्रह्म, तदेव इदं पूर्णं कार्यस्थं
नामरूपोपाधिसंयुक्तम् अविद्यया उद्रिक्तम् तस्मादेव परमार्थस्वरूपात् अन्यदिव
प्रत्यवभासमानम् — तत् , यत् आत्मानमेव परं पूर्णं ब्रह्म विदित्वा — अहम् अदः
पूर्णं ब्रह्मास्मि इत्येवम् , पूर्णमादाय, *तिरस्कृत्य अपूर्णस्वरूपताम्
अविद्याकृतां नामरूपोपाधिसम्पर्कजाम्* एतया ब्रह्मविद्यया पूर्णमेव केवलम्
अवशिष्यते ; तथा चोक्तम् ‘तस्मात्तत्सर्वमभवत्’ इति ।

Hence the ‘Infinite,’ denoted by the word ‘That,’ is Brahman. That again is
‘this infinite’ (universe)—Brahman manifested as effect, connected with the
limiting adjuncts of name and form, projected by ignorance, and appearing
as different from that real nature of its own. Then knowing itself as the
supreme, infinite Brahman, so as to feel, ‘I am that infinite Brahman,’ and
thus taking its infinitude, i.e. removing by means of this knowledge of
Brahman its own limitation created by ignorance through the contact of the
limiting adjuncts of name and form, it remains as the unconditioned
infinite alone. So it has been said, ‘Therefore It became all.’ //trans by
