Sri Bhaskara is saying as if Pot will be there even after Brahman is realized because everything is Brahman. Again we are slipping down to Parinama Vada. This is closer to Visistadvaita than Advaita. Because they also say all the Cit and Acit Vastus are real and the body of Brahma.


Ø     I am not able to understand why pot should go to realize the clay !!??  Here pot (jagat) is pratyaksha pramANa gOchara and its kAraNa (the brahman) is NOT pratyaksha pramANita he is Agama siddha.  That which is established by one pramANa another pramANa cannot overtake  or supersede  it.  Pratyaksha pramANita prameya i.e. nAma rUpa jagat cannot be effaced by shruti siddha brahma jnana.  Effacing the nAma rUpa jagat is NOT the ‘uddesha’ of shAstra and it is not in the scope of this shAstra pramANa.  One pramANa cannot go against another pramANa.  The relationship between  kArya and kAraNa here is not like anga-angi, shesha-sheshi, body-soul in vishishtAdvaita.  What we talk here is tAdAtmyalakshaNa between kArya jagat and kAraNa brahman.  And like kAraNa, kArya too are sattvaM eva na vyabhicharati, trishu kAleshu.  And it is because of the simple fact / vedAnta siddhAnta i.e. kAryAkArOpi kAraNasya Atma bhUta eva AnAtmabhUtasya anArabhyAt.  So, what is vedAnta maryAda  atleast according to bhAshyakAra is :  brahman is the abhinna nimittOpadAna kAraNa and hence shruti says : sarvaM khalvidaM brahma, brahmaivedaM vishvaM, satyanchAnrutancha satyamabhavat yadidaM kiMcha etc.  It is not vishishta Advaita, it is shishtAs’ shuddha Advaita for those who acknowledge the ‘vedAnta maryAda’.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
