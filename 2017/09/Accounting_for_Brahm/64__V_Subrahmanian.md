Namaste Sri Praveen

You are right. If Badhayam Samanadhikaranyam is not accepted it becomes
Parinama Vada only. But Advaita is not Parinama Vada. It is Vivarta Vada.
After Bhranti is over the Snake is not seen. In Badhayam Samanadhikaranyam
the Badhita Vastu will be Vyavaharika or Pratibhasika but not Paramarthika.
It will not be seen after realization.

Here both the adhyasa and the apavada type of sāmā...' are shown.  In
apavada type (which is what is relevant to the bādhāyām...type), when the
wrong identification as the Self with the body-mind complex is dispelled by
the right knowledge of the Self, the sāmānādhikaraṇya is between 'the
body-mind complex' and the 'Atman',  'The body-mind (that was wrongly seen
as the Self) is (now known to be) nothing but the Upaniṣadic Atman.'  The
right knowledge of the Atman dispels the wrong knowledge of the body-mind
as the Self.  This is the bādhā of the wrong knowledge.

But Pot is seen even after realizing
it is Mud only. Therefore this is Parinama Vada.

Sri Bhaskara is saying as if Pot will be there even after Brahman is
realized because everything is Brahman. Again we are slipping down to
Parinama Vada. This is closer to Visistadvaita than Advaita. Because they
also say all the Cit and Acit Vastus are real and the body of Brahma.
