>>
>> First part is answered above. Second part ; One does not “know” that.
>> That would be objectifying Brahman. Clarified further below.

>> But your question demands an answer. There is nothing like “establishing

>> guNa (object and quality) etc. Some more examples are normally covered
>> while explaining this issue. Atman and Brahman are the same entity. They
>> appeared to be different prior to Knowledge (jnAna) which difference is
>> negated (bAdha) after Knowledge. Negated means the realization that they
>> never were/are/will be  different.  Past/present/future. This Realization
>> is automatic consequence of removal of avidya/Ignorance, because Brahman is
>> Self-Revealing.
