That way, the satkāryavāda is protected. This is in perfect agreement with the Taittiriya passages/method cited.

praNAms Sri Subbu prabhuji
Hare Krishna

More agreements thence tempted to continue ☺

Yes, mAyA satkAryavAka does not come in the way of brahma nirvisheshatva nor propagates the brahma pariNAma vAda.  Those who are tempted to think that kArya-kAraNa ananyatvaM is bringing vikAra or pariNAma or transformation in brahman, perhaps forgotten shankara’s clarification with regard to this.  prAgutpatteH avyAkruta nAma rUpa bhedaM AtmabhUtaM AtmaikashabdagOcharaM jagat…”  idaaneem vyAkruta nAma rUpa bhedatvaat aneka shabda pratyaya gOcharaM, Atmaika shabdapratyaya gOcharancha iti visheshaH.  bhAshyakAra further clarifies by giving the example, when it is water, it is water only, when it is foam and water, that time also it is water only.  And as always the punch or bottom  line here in the kArya-kAraNa ananyatvaM needs to be understood to maintin shruti pradipAdita nirvishesha brahman is :  atO nAmarUpe sarvAvasthe brahmaNaivAtmavatee ‘na brahma tadAtmakaM’ or ananyatvepi kArya karaNayOH kAryasya kArANAtmatvaM “ na tu kAraNasya kAryAtmatvaM” or brahma svabhavO hi prapanchaH “ na prapancha svabhAvaM brahma”.

If it is not palatable to the bhrAnta jeeva srushti vAdins..they are welcome to interpret these bhAshya vAkya-s in their own way ☺

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
