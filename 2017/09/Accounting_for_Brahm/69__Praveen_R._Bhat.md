It's more of shuddhAdvaita, which is really a misnomer because it is
shuddha dvaita. They say that there is no mithyA at all, the jagat as is
also only brahman. It really exists!

In such understanding, the entire pursuit of mokSha becomes a waste, since
from real jagat, real samsAra, there can never be muktiH.
