praNAms Sri Subbu prabhuji

Since this is not the way Brahman becomes many, the answer to the question is: Brahman, through the medium of the nāma-rūpa combine, which is non-different from Brahman and remaining in Brahman in unmanifest form, becomes manifest in creation, and thereby there is the manifoldness in the world:

>  Very rare agreement between you and me prabhuji in Advaita based on shankara bhAshya :-)  Hence happily acknowledging it.  Something relating to this has been explained in sUtra bhAshya as well I reckon.  To the doubt how at one place avyAkruta itself became manifest and at other place paramAtma himself make the avyAkruta vyAkruta??  The bhAshyakAra replies, naisha dOshaH because the avyAkruta jagat is paramAtma himself and it has to be accepted that brahman is the prakruti that is the material cause and also the efficient cause.  And this is what geetAchArya also says avyayktAdeeni bhUtAni, vyakta madhyAni avyaktanidhanAnyeva...it is there in him, it comes out from him and it goes back to him only like spider says mundaka.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
