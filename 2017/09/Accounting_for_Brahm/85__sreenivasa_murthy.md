Dear Sri Subramanian, 
You write : " An explanation attributed to Swami Vivekananda The first one is
reducing one's ego completely, bhakti. The second one is expanding one's
ego so large as to loose all pettiness."
 Can an entity do that? How to do it?
With respectful namaskars,Sreenivasa Murthy

An explanation attributed to Swami Vivekananda: A fish caught in a net can
escape in two ways: it can squeeze itself and get out of a hole in the net.
It can expand so big as to come out bursting the net. The first one is
reducing one's ego completely, bhakti. The second one is expanding one's
ego so large as to loose all pettiness. This is jnana.
