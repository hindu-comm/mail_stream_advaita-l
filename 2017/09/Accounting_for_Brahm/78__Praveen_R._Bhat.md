Yes, it can't really be anything else in अहं ब्रह्मास्मि
...

... I'm not sure what context this is in, although some similar view
might exist as I mentioned later here. However, neither can aham be negated
nor can brahma, so it cannot really be bAdhasAmAnAdhikaraNyam.

The word apavAda and the nivartyate is not indicating connection between
aham and brahma, but between aham and associations with various sharIras
as indicated by

देहेन्द्रियसङ्घाते

आत्मबुद्धिः, etc. Ergo, when a person says ahaM idaM sharIram, etc, there
it is bAdhasAmAnAdhikaraNyam, .

In aham brahma the aikya sāmānādhikaraṇya could be accounted for post

As I said earlier, the depth of ahaMpratyaya decides whether lakShaNA is
needed or not, but it is aikyasAmAnAdhikaraNa with any type of lakShaNa.
What is negated is association of ahaMpratyaya with mithyA sharIras. but
ahaMpratyaya can never be negated, since it is aluptadRk.
