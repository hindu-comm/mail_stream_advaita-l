Yes, by negation, if it is said, the inexpressible revealed is Kutastha
Atman, then the question is, how its aikya with upanisadic Brahman is
established ? how is the sruti maha vAkya interpreted based on
sAmAnAdhikaraNya and lakshaNa nirUpaNa.

I think, it is extensively discussed and clarified in this thread itself,
but based on one of the later responses on negation, I had the above
clarification. You may want to read the entire series of emails on this
subject to know the full context.
