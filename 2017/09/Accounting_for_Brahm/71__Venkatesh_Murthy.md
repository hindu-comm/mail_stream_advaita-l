If you are saying after realizing Brahman there is Pot also and there is
Brahman also it is Siddhanta Viruddha because there will be many Realities
and not One Reality. If you say there will be Nama Roopa even after
 Brahman realization also there will be same problem. We can have only one
Reality not many. Sruti Pramana can go against all Pramanas and itself.
That is why they say Sruti and all Pramanas are not Pramanas at Brahman
level. Because Pramana means there will be Triputi. Jnana-Jneya-Jnatru.
This is only Vyavaharika Satya but not Paramarthika. In Paramartha there is
no Jnana, no Jneya and no Jnatru division.

I am surprised you are writing like a Dvaiti. May be you should change from
Tripundra to Urdhwa Pundra.
