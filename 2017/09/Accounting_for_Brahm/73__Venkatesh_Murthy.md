Namaste
Ã˜  * Yes that only reality and its vidyA does not have the capacity to
create anything new nor destroy anything that already existing.  It only
reveals what is there or what is existing in reality.  Seeing pot instead
of mrud is upAdhi drushti, seeing mrud in place of pot is pAramArthika
samyak drushti.  To have this samyak drushti (mruttiketyeva satyaM) pot
need not be destroyed.   *

This is the problem. The Drushtanta cannot be stretched very far. Pot will
be there when we see Pot as Mud. Agreed. But what about Naama Roopa of Pot
when Brahman is realized? This Naama Roopa is MithyA. It cannot sit beside
Brahman in Paramartha. Because if it sits with Brahman there will be not
One Reality but Two. Brahman will be first and Naama Roopa will be second.
Therefore Naama Roopa must get destroyed. Then only Brahman is left.
