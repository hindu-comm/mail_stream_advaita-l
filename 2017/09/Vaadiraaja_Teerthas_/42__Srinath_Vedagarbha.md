In both the example, the tAtparya of the speaker could be clarified/know
from speaker himself. There is no need to choose between lakShaNa and
mukhya. When we are dealing with shruti, wich is apouruSheya, who decides
the tAtparya? Isn't it that tAtparya itself is the central dispute between
two schools? Given this, assuming the tatparya in one way and interpreting
the vAkya is akin to flaw of theory laden observation.

More over, the existence of other animals (that could consume curds) are
known through shabda-s using their mukhyArtha, such as "marjAla", "shunka"
etc. In the system when you argue not a single word denote these creatures
in their mukhyArtha, how can you apply the tatparya of inclusion of those
animals in the vAkhya "kAkebhyo dadhi rakShyatAm"? Similarly, unless
brahman is denoted and known by any single shabda by its mukhyartha, such
brhman cannot be tAtparya of any vAkhya-s in shruti. Two arguments  --
 bhahman is avAchaya, and tAtparya-anupapatti; does not go with each
other.
