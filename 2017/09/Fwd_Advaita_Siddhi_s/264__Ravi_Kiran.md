when you say properties (dharma) here, //
सत्त्वात्यन्ताभावासत्त्वात्यन्ताभावरूपम्
धर्मद्वयं
it means the property as mentioned in the below example ?

//A defining characteristic of the class ‘cow’ (gotva) is the property
‘having dewlap’ (sAsnAvat)

Here, vyApya and vyApakam refer to nyAya terms ?

vyApyam - nyuna desa vRtti   (prithvitvam)

vyApakam - adhika desa vRtti  (dravyatvam)

Unable to follow above statement ???:

Can you pl mention the description of hetu and sAdhya referred here in
brackets ( also, in general, in any such future usages)..like

//the hetu (???)  of this rule present, but the sAdhya(???) of this rule is
not.

Are we still using the old anumAnam here (jagat mithyA, drishyatvAt, shukti
rUpyavat)?

sAdhya - mithyAtva
hetu - drishyatvAt

In shell-silver, hetu is present, sAdhya is also present, if we take the
siddhikAra's definition of sAdhya.

vyabhichAra based on this statement below ?

In the case of shell-silver, the absence of sat does not imply the presence
of asat, as the shell-silver is available for appearance.

Interesting...

// even if the presence of sat implies the absence of asat (and vice versa)

which means,

even if we agree to the definitions of dvaitin for sat and asat, in the
above rule ?
( and not insisting on the definitions provided by siddhikAra )

sAmAnyam?

gotva jAti ?

I am trying to link your translations with the nyAya terms, as I find that
helpful while studying these topics.
