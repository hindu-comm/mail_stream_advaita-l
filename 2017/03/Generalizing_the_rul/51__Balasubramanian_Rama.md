Dear Shrinivas,

We can't willy-nilly invent rules. There are rules that already exist in
the case of vedas. For example, the taittiriya praatishaakhya has a whole
chapter on change of nakaara to Nakaara. Namely chapter 7 which begins with
atha nakaaro Nakaaram. Every veda will have its own rules in its own
praatishaakhya, Sometimes there are additional rules from other shikshA
texts or just tradition which may either supplement the praatishaakhya or
in rare cases over-rule it. uccaahaaraNam is learned by going to a guru who
has done kramaanta-svaadhyaayam, and not picking up a book/books and
inventing rules.

Rama
