Dear List,
Namaste!
Could some of you please shed light on, with concrete references--(i)if Sankara was the author of the Dashashloki, (ii)distinction between the Śaṅkara known through Mādhava'snarratives and the historical person.
While we don't find any problem in accepting its authorship to Sankara, people raise doubt as well.

With best regards,Niranjan Saha
