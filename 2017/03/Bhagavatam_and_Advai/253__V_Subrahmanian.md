No. The 'bhāgavata darshana' of the BS also known as pāncharātra is not the
subject matter of the Srimadbhāgavatam.  One can find copious Advaitic
teachings in the Srimadbhāgavatam.  The Uddhavagitā of the 11th Canto is
especially dear to Advaitins.  Swami Paramarthananda ji has discoursed on
this section very elaborately in English. One can buy this recording from
the Śāstraprakāśikā Trust, Chennai.
