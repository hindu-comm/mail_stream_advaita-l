A delectable scholarly talk on Srirudram

Here is a very interesting, informative and instructive talk on the
Srirudropaniṣat of the Krishna Yajur Veda is available here:

The talk highlights the Jnāna kāṇda embedded in the Srirudram. The speaker
Vidwan Sri Kibballi Ganapati Bhat has done a great narrative. Even though
the talk is in Kannada, it is full of scriptural quotes and thus a treat
even for those who are non-Kannada knowing.

Please share the message with your friends and other forums.
