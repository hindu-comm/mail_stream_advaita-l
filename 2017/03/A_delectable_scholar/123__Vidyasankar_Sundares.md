This talk is really very good. The Kannada used is very easy and simple,
with a lot of Sanskrit usage as well. So even if one doesn't know the
language fully, with some knowledge of another south Indian language, one
should be able to make out most of the meaning.

The speaker is a very learned, traditional paNDita, who is associated with
the Swarnavalli Matha that is based in coastal Karnataka.

Best regards,
Vidyasankar
