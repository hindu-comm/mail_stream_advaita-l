Indeed, the many parallels with the viSvarUpa chapter of the gItA are very
noteworthy. I've always remarked that the viSvarUpa vision that Arjuna got
in that instance was a terrifying ugra form and seen as eating up all the
universe.

Another detail to share with the list is that the abhinava Sankara
described in this talk as the commentator on the rudrIya was a sannyAsin
named rAmabrahmAnanda tIrtha. He was most probably a junior contemporary of
the celebrated madhusUdana sarasvatI or lived even later than him.


Best regards,
Vidyasankar
