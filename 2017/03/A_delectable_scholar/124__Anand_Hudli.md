Amazing oratory skills! The speaker VidvAn Shri Kibballi Ganapati Bhat is able to draw information from and quote from a wide array of texts. Especially, the quotes from BhartRhari are illuminating. What is also noteworthy is the parallel he draws between Bhagavad gItA chapter 11 (perhaps chapter 10 as well) and the Namaka portion. He even mentions this could be an area of "research."
