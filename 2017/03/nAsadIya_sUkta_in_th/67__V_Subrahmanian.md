Thanks Venkat ji, for posting this sūkta with bhāṣyam and translation. Does
the mantra/bhāṣya talk about the unmanifest state that is generally
admitted to obtain prior to creation?

In the Mahopaniṣat is the statement: ‘एको नारायणः’.  Sri Brahmānanda in his
commentary to the Advaita Siddhi of Sri Madhusudana Saraswati has said that
this ‘Nārāyaṇa’ prior to creation is ‘chinmātra’ svarūpam, that is, is Pure
Consciousness, formless, nirguna Brahman.
