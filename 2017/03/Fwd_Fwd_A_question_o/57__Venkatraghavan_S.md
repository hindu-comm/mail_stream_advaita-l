Namaste Sri Chandramouliji,
True, that is why I said, taking these two as the definitions, there is
vyApya vyApaka sambandha between vivarta and pariNAma. The rope snake would
be another kind of vivarta.

Besides, these are not my definitions, they are the author's. You can
ignore it if you don't think my explanation is appropriate.

Regards,
Venkatraghavan

They cannot be so defined. Rope-snake is an example for vivarta, there is
no parinama.



However I would prefer to have a verbatim translation of  the entire
passage which could then form the basis for the discussion. I am unable to
provide the same. Either you could do so or perhaps Sri Praveen Ji could
​.​
 Any other member also  is welcome to do so. If considered necessary, the
words vyapaka and vyapya could be just left as such or translated as
applicable in the context.



We could continue with the discussion following this.



Regards
