By the gold-necklace analogy the delusion pertaining to transformation is
dispelled.
[Here the Upanishad holds the gold-ornament vikāra to be a bhrama, that is,
it holds such a transformation to be a case of vivarta.]

“ bhrama “ does not imply vivarta in all cases of vikAra. In the
gold-ornament example, bhrama is only jnAnAdhyAsa. There is no arthAdhyAsa.
 For vivarta, arthAdhyAsa is mandatory.
