Namaste,

A great srivaishnava scholar & rAmabhakta "mahAmahopAdhyAya" nallanchakravartula raghunathacharyulu garu has authored Bhagavat Gita commentary (in line with Ramanuja) and also provided the counter arguments to the objections raised by Bellamkonda Ramaramaya Kavi in Bhashyarka Prakasika.  I am told that the book is in market for sale.  

However, couldn't find in Hyderabad.  Any whereabouts, kindly let me know.

regs,
sriram
