Pranams Sri Sadananda Ji,



Reg  <<  My mail to the advaitaL list are not going through for some reason
- may be it is related to yahoo mail server. I am trying to register via
gmail. While I wait for the moderator's approval process, I just want to
comment on your comments.>>,



Very unfortunate indeed. I hope this will be rectified soonest. Meanwhile I
do hope members will be able to access your part of the post through these
responses.



Reg  << happiness pertains to only pratibimba ananda at the BMI levels. If
that is the case, then question is, what about samashTi duHkha-anubhuti.>>,




pratibimba ananda at the BMI levels implies that the jnani is directing his
attention to jagat  and not to Brahman. In this condition his experience of
both happiness and dukha is limited to vyashti level ONLY and does not
extend to samashti level.  This is not the subject matter of verse 35
Chapter 14 of Panchadashi.



Reg  << If you are happy with your explanation, so be it. I am currently
relishing in the idea that in the joining of vyashti components to become
samashti, the conflicting rajasic and tamasic vRittis drop out  leaving
only saatvic vRitties as at samashti level Iswara prevails. Saatvic vRittis
alone can join while the other vRitties due to mutual contradictions get
cancelled out. >>,



I must confess I did not understand  this part. Samashti experience in one
BMI  is not admitted in advaita sidhanta.



Regards
