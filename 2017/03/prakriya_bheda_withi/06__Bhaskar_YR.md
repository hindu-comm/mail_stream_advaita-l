praNAms

Just a curious question.  Do we have different types of siddhAnta pratipAdana (or prakriya bheda) in other dualists school as well as we have in Advaita??  In shankara's kevalAdvaita we have schools like bhAmati, vivaraNa, work which has been dedicated to reconcile these schools' differences and again there are some more works in an effort of presenting the same siddhAnta slightly (and sometimes considerably ) different from these two major schools etc.  I am aware of the ISKCON Vs dvaita, tengalai Vs vadagalai etc.  I am more interested to know whether within mAdhva saMpradAya itself there is any siddhAnta pratipAdana bheda ( I think ashta matha-s and their Achraya-s do not differ within themselves when it comes to Ananda teertha pratipAdita tattva vAda or dvaita siddhAnta).  Likewise whether there is any different prakriya (methodology) within the school of rAmAnuja's SrivaishNava sampradAya and its vishishtAdvaita siddhAnta.  Any related article with regard to this will be helpful.  

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
