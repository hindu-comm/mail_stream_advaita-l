hariH OM,

Vyoma Linguistic Labs, a non profit organisation working for samskRRitam
has published bhagavadgiita chanted by vyaakaraNa vidvaan Nagendra Pavan.
You can hear the audio sample here:

Note that the rates for India are different. There are also bulk discounts
available. You can think of this as a gifting option.

I am not formally associated with the above organization, nor do I have any
commercial interest in its promotion.

svasti,
      bhavaaniibhaaratii jayatetamaam,
                                                     shrivathsa.
