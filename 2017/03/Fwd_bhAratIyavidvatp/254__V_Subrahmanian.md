Subject: {भारतीयविद्वत्परिषत्} Adhyātma Rāmāyaṇa cited by Appayya Dikṣita
To: BHARATIYA VIDVAT <bvparishat at googlegroups.com>


Namaste

In his 'श्रीरामायणतात्पर्यसारसङ्ग्रहस्तोत्रम्’, a short work with an
auto-commentary, Sri Appayya Dikshita has cited a few verses from the
Adhyātma Ramāyaṇam. Those verses are all found in the Yuddha kāṇḍa of the
extant Gita press edition.  I would like to know if any earlier work has
cited verses from the AR or even mentioned it by name.

Thanks and regards
