The reality of the "really affected" is at the same level of reality as
the world which is vyAvahArika. On the pAramarthikA level, the jIva which
is brahmAtman, is not really affected.

I have discussed this point here -

On the same thread, some references were given, one of them being Gita 13.2
wherein Bhashyakara deals with this as pUrvapakSha in detail and refutes it.

What Des Cartes says is irrelevant to Vedanta; "I think therefore I am"
is putting the cart before the horse, according to any Vedanta flavour you
pick. You have to exist before you can think. So I definitely am and I may
or may not think. That I know myself as an individual may need a karaNa and
therefore a thought, but knowing that I exist is svatassidhaH. Its more
like I think, therefore I think I am; not thinking would not take away
existence. sata abhAvaH na vidyate.

Then do you learn that you were unconscious from someone else after waking
up? It is svatassiddhaH. The experience of having no thought, seeing
nothing, happiness, can be re-collected on waking up only due to it being
*collected* in the first place during deep sleep. Its shUnyavAda to say
there is no consciousness in deep sleep, which stands refuted by
pratyabhij~nA.
