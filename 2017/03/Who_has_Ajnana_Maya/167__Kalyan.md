Dear Sri Venkatraghavan

 //1)You are
 assuming that an experience of something implies the self
 is
 affected. That is not true.//


Then there is no need for anyone to try for moksha since no one is affected by misery.



// 2) You are concluding that the
 self experiences a real experience. That is
 also not true.//

Please give me one single example where the experience  itself is not real -rope-snake, nacre-silver or anything else.


// Taking your apple example, how did you know
 that the apple was perceived?
 Because that
 perception itself was perceived. Thus, that perception
 also
 belongs to the drishya, not the drk.
 Its not any more real than the apple
 itself.//

This will lead to an infinite regress unless you postulate that perception is self-evident.

Regards
Kalyan
