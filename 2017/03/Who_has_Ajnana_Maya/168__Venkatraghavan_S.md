Then there is no need for anyone to try for moksha since no one is affected

Ultimately this is true - but people incorrectly believe that they are
miserable, and to correct that moksha shAstra is there.


// 2) You are concluding that the
 self experiences a real experience. That is
 also not true.//

Please give me one single example where the experience  itself is not real
-rope-snake, nacre-silver or anything else.

Why one, every single experience, which is nothing but a thought, is
ultimately not real, because it is a viShaya for sAkshi pratyaksha,
drishyatvAt.


// Taking your apple example, how did you know
 that the apple was perceived?
 Because that
 perception itself was perceived. Thus, that perception
 also
 belongs to the drishya, not the drk.
 Its not any more real than the apple
 itself.//

This will lead to an infinite regress unless you postulate that perception
is self-evident.


No, because perception of thought does not require another thought, only
consciousness - so there is no infinite regress. It is consciousness that
is self evident.

Kalyan
