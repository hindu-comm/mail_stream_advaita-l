Dear Sri Venkatraghavan


 //Then there is no need for anyone to try for
 moksha since no one is affected
 by
 misery.

 Ultimately this is
 true - but people incorrectly believe that they are
 miserable, and to correct that moksha shAstra
 is there.//


An incorrect belief of misery is real misery. Therefore people are really affected by misery when they incorrectly believe they are miserable. I have discussed this point here -

 //Why one, every single experience, which is
 nothing but a thought, is
 ultimately not
 real, because it is a viShaya for sAkshi pratyaksha//


Please provide a single example to show that thoughts are not real.


 //No, because perception of thought does not
 require another thought, only
 consciousness
 - so there is no infinite regress. It is consciousness
 that
 is self evident.//


As Des Cartes says, I think, therefore I am. It is thoughts and perceptions that make us realize that we are a conscious entity. There is no consciousness in the state of dreamless sleep.

Regards
Kalyan
