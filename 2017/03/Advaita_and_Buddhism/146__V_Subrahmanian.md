Here is a pdf on the above topic. Sri Satchidanandendra Sarswati Swamina
(SSS) has studied the Mādhyamika Kārikā-s of Nagarjuna along with the
commentary of Chandrakirti and also the Kārikā-s of Gaudapada and given an
account of how Advaita and Buddhism differ.

I thank my friend Sri Pramod Bharadwaj for his effort in making this
document in a convenient pdf format from a larger book of the author.
