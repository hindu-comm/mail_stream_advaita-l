Dear all,

I am happy to share my new book "Musings on Hinduism", which contains my
writings on Hindu religion and philosophy in general and Vedanta in
particular. It is written in a simple manner with lay people in mind. It
also includes my english commentary on Nirvana Shatkam and partial
commentary on texts like Ganapati Atharvashirsha etc.

Look forward all the feedback.

Regards,
Nithin S
