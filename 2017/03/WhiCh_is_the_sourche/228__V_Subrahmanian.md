Thanks for this wonderful reference.  And I tend to take the above result
as very probable since Shankara has expressly admitted the maxim: 'para
matam apratiṣiddham anumatam bhavati' which means 'that which is
non-contradictory to us found in other schools is admissible to us.'  And
the point the Dharmakirti verse is making exactly fits the Panchadashi
topic discussed.

In the BSB too Shankara cites a tenet of Buddhist (on vairāgya) and says:
who would refute that?

warm regards
