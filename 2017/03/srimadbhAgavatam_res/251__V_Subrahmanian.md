Text
Sri Suta Gosvami said: While returning home, the King [Maharaja Pariksit]
felt that the act he had committed against the faultless and powerful
brahmana was heinous and uncivilized. Consequently he was distressed.
Purport

The pious King regretted his accidental improper treatment of the powerful
brahmana, who was faultless. Such repentance is natural for a good man like
the King, and such repentance delivers a devotee from all kinds of sins
accidentally committed. The devotees are naturally faultless. Accidental
sins committed by a devotee are sincerely regretted, and by the grace of
the Lord all sins unwillingly committed by a devotee are burnt in the fire
of repentance.
