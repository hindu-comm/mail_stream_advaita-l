Namaste,

These are all trivial things, in my opinion.  In other purANa, Shiva might sport with oordhwapuNDra.  
Infact, Shiva initiates His devotees into'tAraka-brahma-vidya' in the form of rAma-mantra in Kashi and Kalahashti.  

In brindAvana, Shiva becomes one of the Gopis and takes part in rAsa-krIDa who is the sthala devata there.  
Hence, a linga has been consecrated there with the name "gopeshwara".  

There is no end to this....Both Shiva and Vishnu sport themselves as shEsha-shEshi bhAva and 
ultimately they want to convey is they both are "abhEda".

regs,
sriram
