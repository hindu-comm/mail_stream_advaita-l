Namaste

It was in 2007 that a grand Soundarya Lahari (SL) samarpanam was held at
the Palace Grounds, Bangalore, where close to one lakh persons participated
in the recitation. Commemorating this event, the Vedanta Bharati which had
spearheaded that mega event, is planning an event in the latter half of
2017. In the run up to this, several programs are being organized in many
parts of Karnataka under the guidance of HH Sri Shankara Bharati Swamiji of
the Yedathore Yoganandeswara Mutt, K.R.Nagar, Mysore, with the blessings of
the Jagadgurus of Sringeri.
