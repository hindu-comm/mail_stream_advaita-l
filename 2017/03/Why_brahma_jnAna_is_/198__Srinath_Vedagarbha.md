If you now say light itself is confused for gem itself, then upon closer
inspection & realization he finds that it is light of the gem not the gem
itself. So the adhisTAna for this brahmA is light not the gem. The real gem
happens to be there by chance. This goes back to my original contention
that gem happens to be at that dESha-kAla, and definitely not the
adhishTAna for the brahmA.

Here too, what exactly is seen is dust and what is concluded is smoke.
Adhistana is dust and adhisTa is smoke. Inference prakriya based on such
false smoke (hEtu) is besides the point and does not belong to this bhramA.

Fire is not viShya of the brahmA  at all. But it is sAdya of anumAna based
on bhamAtmaka hEtu. I argue fire has nothing to do with this brahmA at all.
