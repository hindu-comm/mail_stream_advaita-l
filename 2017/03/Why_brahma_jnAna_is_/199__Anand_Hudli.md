Why don't you study the examples mentioned in the 9th chapter of
PanchadashI and get back with questions or doubts? It seems you are having
trouble understanding the basics of saMvAdi and visaMvAdi bhramas. Besides,
there are others in this list who are knowledgeable about the material in
the PanchadashI. Just note that the PanchadashI asserts that there are
crores of examples for saMvAdi-bhrama, involving pratyakSha, anumAna, and
shAstra, which means this type of bhrama is quite common.
