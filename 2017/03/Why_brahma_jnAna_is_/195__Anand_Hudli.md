Well, you have succeeded in creating a bhrama where the adhyasta
(superimposed) is an objection and the adhisThAna is a misunderstanding!!
It looks like an objection (snake), but upon examination it turns out to be
a misunderstanding (rope). And this is a case of visaMvAdi-bhrama!

Let me clarify the example of the gem and the lamp. There are two rooms, A
and B. Room A contains a gem alone, and room B contains a lamp alone. Light
emanates from both the rooms, ie. light from the gem in A and light from
the lamp in B. Two persons, P1 and P2 are standing outside the two rooms,
which are themselves some distance apart so that P1 is somewhere near A and
P2 is near B.  Person P1 sees the light from room A only (not from B) and
runs after it thinking it is coming from a gem. Person P2 see the light
from room B only (not from A) and runs after it, also thinking it is coming
from a gem. However, P1 does succeed in finding the gem in room A,
whereas P2 finds no gem but a lamp in room B. We say person P1 experienced
a saMvAdi-bhrama (P1 found the desired object), while person P2 experienced
a visaMvAdibhrama (P2 did not find the desired object).
