AFAIK Dvaitis say dream objects and dream persons are real. They are
not false like we are saying. God will create dream objects for every
person and he will see only that dream created by God. Therefore dream
objects are real because they are created by God. In this example you
have given the dream person is real and the dream shell is also real.
The Silver is not real because it comes under Bhrama. Therefore there
is no Sarva Nivrutti.

If you say after waking up the dream person and shell are not there.
It may be like some person and shell in the past. They are also not
existing now. But they were existing before. Now they are not there.
For that reason you cannot say they never existed and not real.

How to reply to this objection?
