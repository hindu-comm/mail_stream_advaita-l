Even accepting dream is mithya and hence bhramAtmaka as  per AV's point of
view, the difficulty in this example is that it does not support intended
scope. The person who is dreaming is not just adhishThAna as you are
saying, but draShTa of that bhrama as well. So, after dream is over, that
draShta still remains. So, where is sarva-nivritti here?

So, a pUrvapaxin would argue this example is its own antithesis.
