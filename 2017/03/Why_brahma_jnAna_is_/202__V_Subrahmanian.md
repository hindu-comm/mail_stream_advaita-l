In the Bhagavatam, Ajamila episode, it is said:




*sāṅketyaṁ pārihāsyaṁ vā stobhaṁ helanam eva vāvaikuṇṭha-nāma-grahaṇam*
* aśeṣāgha-haraṁ viduḥ   6.2.14*

One who chants the holy name of the Lord is immediately freed from the
reactions of unlimited sins, even if he chants* indirectly [to indicate
something else],* jokingly, for musical entertainment, or even
neglectfully. This is accepted by all the learned scholars of the
scriptures.

This example is given by Vidyaranya in the Panchadashi 9th chapter while
discussing samvādi bhrama:

jvareNAptaH sannipAtaM bhrAntyA nArAyaNa.n smaran .
mR^itaH svargamavApnoti sa sa.nvAdibhramo mataH .. 9.9


The commentator Ramakrishna Pandita cites two verses here:

हरिर्हरति पापानि दुष्टचित्तेरपिस्मृत: |. अनिच्छयाऽपि संस्पृष्टो
दहत्येव ही पावक: ||

एतावतालमघनिर्हरणाय पुंसां
सङ्कीर्तनं भगवतो गुणकर्मनाम्नाम् ।
विक्रुश्य पुत्रमघवान्यदजामिलोऽपि
नारायणेति म्रियमाण इयाय मुक्तिम् ॥२४॥ Bhagavatam 6.3.24

This power of chanting the holy name was proved by the liberation of
Ajamila. *When Ajamila chanted the holy name of Narayana, he did not
precisely remember the Supreme Lord; instead, he remembered his own
son.* At the time of death, Ajamila certainly was not very clean;
indeed, he was famous as a great sinner. Furthermore, one's
physiological condition is completely disturbed at the time of death,
and in such an awkward condition it would certainly have been very
difficult for Ajamila to have chanted clearly. Nevertheless, Ajamila
achieved liberation simply by chanting the holy name of the Lord.

So there is proof in pratyaksha, anumāna the purana (shastra) for
samvādi bhrama. Such instances are countless, says Vidyaranya.
