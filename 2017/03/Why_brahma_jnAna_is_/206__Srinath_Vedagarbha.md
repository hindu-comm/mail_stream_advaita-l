So also I am not claiming siddhikAra is claiming dreamer etc. also negated.
All I am saying is that this example does not prove the point he is arguing
against nyayAmrita-kaara. The bAdhaka jnAna belongs to one bhrama while
sarva-nivriti happens to entirely another bhrama. While former belongs to
dreamer's bhrama, the later one (sarva-nivriti) belongs to dream person's
bhrama of siver-on-shell. This misalignment disproves the claimed argument
that there are sambhAvana of sarva-nivriti can be possible.

In essence, sarva-nivriti can only happens to those bhrama cases where they
themselves are another bhrama. AV's claimed jagat-bhrama is not this type,
and hence it is wrong example and does not answer nyayAmrita-kaara.
