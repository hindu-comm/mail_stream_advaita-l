Namaste,

To begin with a small disclaimer -- my below arguments are purely mine and
not official from Dvaitins. I have not read either nyayAmrita nor
subsequent rejoinders from them.

This example is nested brama (brama within brama). One is outer and another
is inner. The inner one itself a viShya of the outer. The entire set of
inner bhrama -- drashTA(dream person undergoing shell-siver brama), the
bhrama viShaya (siver-shell), the brAnti (thinking shell as silver) and the
nivritti-jnAna (correcting knowledge 'this is shell only'); is itself
bhrama viShaya of the outer bhrama (of the dreamer). Even though entire
package of inner bhrama is bhAdita (sarva nivritti), nevertheless it does
not amount to sarva nivritti for the outer bhrama. At the end we still have
drashTa (the dreamer), his pramA, viShya of his bhrama, adhisTana (dreamer
himself) etc. still remains. Where is sarva nivritti here?

This example does not refute anything. In this example, one bhrama itself
is very viShya of another bhrama. By showing nivritti of that viShya of
outer bhrama, it is concluded sarva nivritti of bhrama is possible.

Think like this -- in order to say 'sarva nivritti' of (inner) bhrama is
possible and hence true,  the very bhAdha of that (inner) bhrama must
happen to begin with. This bhAdhattva is at the same level of reality of
the outer bhrama and hence remains at last. Where is the question of so
called 'sarva-nivritti'?

Opponent could easily use this example itself and can argue this example is
its own anti-thesis and proves otherwise.

Same here too, this example suffers from the above mentioned flaw.

It is incorrect to say so.

It is not possible unless if this bhrama of dvaita-prapancha itself a
viShya of Brhman's another outer bhrAnti. Can you say so?

Is this really Dvaitin's questions? or anuvAda of siddhAntin? Can you
please quote the reference for this question from Dvaitin's text?

When the very topic of prapancha adhyAsa is itself is at the heart of the
dispute here, and not already siddha, how can AV quote and use it to
substantiate the sarva-nivritti concept?

What is established from what? Is sarva-nivrittvaM is used to establish
prapancha-bhAdakatvaM? or prapancha-bhAdakatvaM is used to establish
sarva-nivrittvaM of adhyAsa?

That's fine, but that cannot be used to counter opponent. Don't you agree
one can only refute opponent using mutually accepted means?

I will cover this topic about sAkshi in another mail when I get some time
(it is unfortunate and hard to get time these days).
