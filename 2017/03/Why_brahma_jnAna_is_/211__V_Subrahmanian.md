It is chinmātra Brahman that is appearing as a samsāri. By realization of
the truth of Itself, this Chinmātra Brahman appears as the one liberated.
The very invocation by Madhusudana Saraswati to the Advaitasiddhi says this:

mAyAkalpita-mAtR^itA-mukha-mR^ishhA-dvaitaprapaJNchAshrayaH
  satya-GYAna-sukhAtmakaH shruti-shikhottha-akhaNDadhIgocharaH |
 mithyA-bandha-vidhUnanena paramAnandaika-tAnAtmakaM

  Translation based on siddhivyAkhyA of Balabhadra bhaTTAchArya
  and GauDa-brahmAnandI (laghu-chandrikA) of BrahmAnanda

 VishhNu shines supreme, He who is the substratum (basis) of
 the world of duality beginning with the notion of cognizer (mAtR^i),
 of duality that is false and fabricated by mAyA, He whose nature is
 Existence, Consciousness, and Bliss, He who is realized by the
 undifferentiated (undivided) direct experience arising from the
 mahAvAkyas of vedAnta, He who by shaking off the false bonds (of
 mAyA) has attained, as it were, mokshha wholly consisting of
 supreme bliss, and He who becomes free from all variety,

 manifoldness (vikalpa).

Here 'Vishnu' is not the god who is popularly known as Lakshmipati.

He has not done that. There is no equation in his example between the
silver bhrama and the shruti.
