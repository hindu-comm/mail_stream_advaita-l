Dear Sri Venkatesh,

There is no rule that the Advaitin should not use the dream analogy while
discussing/debating with the Dvaitin. In fact the issues at the base of the
whole exercise are those tenets of Advaita that the Dvaitins oppose and
vice versa. So, each one ends up critiquing the other's tenets in their
books.  That is why we find topics like: Prapanchamithyātvānumāna
khandanam,  Mayavada Khandanam & the Upadhi Khandanam, collectively known
as the Khandana Traya, ...in their books and the following, only a sample,
in Advaita siddhi:

सामान्यतो भेदखण्डनम्
विशेषतो भेदखण्डनम्
विशेषखण्डनम्
भेदपञ्चके प्रत्यक्षभङ्गः
जीवब्रह्मभेदानुमानभङ्गः
मुक्तौ तारतम्यभङ्गः

Other tenets of Dvaitins that have been repudiated in the Advaita siddhi
are, for example, the idea of aprākṛta śarīra for Ishvara/avatara, the
nityatva of vaikuṇṭha, form for Ishvara, etc.
