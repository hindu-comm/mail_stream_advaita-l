If room A is now said to be containing only gem (and no lamp), and the
light is said to be coming from the gem only; then why would anyone call
the first case is bhramA? It is quite yathArtha only -- for it is based on
hEtu (seeing light) and finding the sAdya (the gem). samvAdi-bhrama is
contradiction in terms. If the initial jnAna is later found to be samvAdi
to vastusthiti, it is not a bhrama at all. In Western language, it is
validity by correspondence.
