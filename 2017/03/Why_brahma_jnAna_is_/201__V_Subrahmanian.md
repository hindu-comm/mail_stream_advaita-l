This question is addressed in the Siddhi by pointing out upakrama, etc.
tatparya linga-s. That there is a separate debate about this beside the
matter. Hence, what shruti says, as seen by the Advaitin, is not subject to
change.

Further, the BSB 2.1.14 has also said, in this very context, that there is
no evidence for a bādhaka jnāna for the one that has arisen from the shruti
by which someone who has become liberated using the shrutyupadiṣṭa jnāna
has returned to samsāra.
