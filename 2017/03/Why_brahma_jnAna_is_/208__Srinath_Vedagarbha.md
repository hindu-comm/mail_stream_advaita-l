But when pUrvapaxin raises that objection based on the fact that those
elements -- hEtu, dOSha, adhysTa vastu etc. are not bhrAnti themselves but
yathArtha (at least same level of reality as the drisTa). SiddhAntin's
answer is missed this crucial point and showed the example where those
elements are viShaya of (another) bhrAnti itself. Hence it does not answer
the objection.

In that case you cannot claim sAdhaka's jnyAnOdhaya is resulting
sarva-nivritti. But it is result of suddha-brahman's jnynOdya. Just as in
the given example, the sarva-nivritti of dream-person's bhramA is not due
to 'jnyAnOdya' of that dream person himself, but the jnyAnOdya of the
dreamer.

In that same line, the shruti (which is equivalent to silver bharmA of the
dream person in your example) cannot be claimed by AV to be the cause of
the jnyAnOdya and sarva-nivritti. Because in the given example silver
bhrama does not 'cause' any jnyAnOdya for the dreamer.
