Dears
This shows that we were ahead of modern theories on how the universe
functions.Einstein found corrections were required for Newton's laws.He
enunciated General theory of relativity concernig the motions of moving
objects of uniform motion.This solved or explained about properties of
light and how universal gravitational force bends light rays which were
thought to be on straight lines only till then.Quantum physics tried to
explain how light made of photons behaves when getting reflected or passing
through perforated holes.Our vedic scholars have thought over these things
but did not pursue them .Their goal was what is Brahman and what is
universe.So belittling their theories that they could not put to use etc is
just whimsical.We knew these things much much earlier is what makes us
proud.Our goals were for knowing what is this universe and how it came into
being.Advaita says that all this are just super imposition on Brahman and
this super imposition is a mythya.R.Krishnamoorthy.
