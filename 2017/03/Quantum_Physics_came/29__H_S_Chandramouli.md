Pranams Sri Sarma Ji,

The answer is also equally simple Sri Sarma Ji.  In earlier times,  weapons
did their job through mantras. Sage Bharadwaja entertained entire ayodhya
citizenry who accompanied Bharata to visit Sri Rama just by his power
acquired through such anushthanas only. Any number of such examples are
available. But what has happened since is that the techniques have been
lost to posterity. How I do not know. But that does not negate the
potential capability of such anushthanas.
