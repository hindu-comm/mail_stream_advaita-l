Namaskaram Sriram garu,

A good morning to the Vidvat Sadas here.

This is my first post in the group.

I cannot restrain my excitement about the point you just made on the topic.

I concur with your views.

Also, many thanks for mentioning the name of the Vidwan Gopalakrishna
Sastry garu, a stalwart in this age. I am in touch with a gem produced by
him, who himself comes from nationally acclaimed Agama Sastra kovidas and
Matra Sastra pravinas.

Raghu


Best Regards,
Raghavender
