I think the discussions here are for Madhyama Adhikaris only and not
Jeevan Muktas and Uttama Adhikaris like you. The Uttama Adhikaris have
gone beyond words and discussions. They have no use for discussions.
Silence is the best for them.  Let them be in Nididhyaasana and
Nirvikalpa Samadhi. That is the best for them. But Madhyama Adhikaris
have to discuss and get doubts cleared. It is not wrong.
