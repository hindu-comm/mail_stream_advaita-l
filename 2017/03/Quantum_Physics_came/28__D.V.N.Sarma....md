I want to humbly inform the list members that I have taught PG students of
Physics in a University for 13 years and I taught
Quantum Mechanics also. So your quotations do not in any way affect my
simple question.

Why these people with all their anushThana and swadhyaya of vedas who claim
Vedic origin of modern science
themselves could not do what westerners did?

regards,
Sarma.
