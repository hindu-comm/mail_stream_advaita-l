Namaste

I don't want to upset the senior members. Adi Sankara and many
Advaitis in the Sampradaya have known Jagat is Mithyaa many many
centuries back. It is in the 20th Century scientists have discovered
Uncertainty and Universe as Hologram theory.

Advaitis have known Moola Avidyaa is the cause of the Universe many
many centuries back. Now scientists are saying there is Dark Energy
and Dark Matter. They are saying Dark Energy and Matter are 96% of the
Universe. Dark Matter is not seen and detected because it will not
reflect, absorb or emit light.
