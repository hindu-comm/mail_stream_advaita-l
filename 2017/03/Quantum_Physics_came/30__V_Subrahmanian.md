Dear Sri Sarma,

The scientist's account found in the cited book does not *claim* what you
state above. On the other hand it only says that the method of the
evolution of scientific theory has some striking similarities with the way
the Indian philosophical thought has.

// If the physical accompaniments such as the senses, apparatus etc., are
included in the notion of the observer, then, since they interact with the
observed, the so-called observer would correspond to the *pramātṛ* or the
*kartṛ*, while, if the ‘de-personalisation’ as is now-a-days envisaged, is
effected by stripping of these, the observer would then correspond to the
Witness – *Sākṣī* of Vedanta.  These theories have forced the view that the
universe can, at best, if at all, be ‘described’ succinctly, and never
‘accounted for’.  There is thus the admission of Avidyā of the investigator
and anirvachanīyatā of the universe, as in Vedanta.  That the universe has
been referred to by them (the scientists) as mysterious, recalls to the
mind the Māyā of Vedanta.//
