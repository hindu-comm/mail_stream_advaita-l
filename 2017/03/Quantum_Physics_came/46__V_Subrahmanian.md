Sir, the above has been put in a very interesting and instructive manner by
the ancients:

மரத்தை மறைத்தது மாமத யானை
மரத்தில் மறைந்தது மாமத யானை
பரத்தை மறைத்தன பார்முதல் பூதம்
பரத்தில் மறைந்தன பார்முதல் பூதமே

திருமூலர் 8-21

Tirumūlar in that famous verse says:

In an elephant carving, the wood is concealed by the elephant (when one is
engrossed in the carved elephant) and when the wood-vision is had the
elephant 'disappears'.  So too the Supreme is concealed by the world of
elements and when the vision of the Supreme is had, the world of elements
disappear into the former.

Shankaracharya, in his Svātmanirūpaṇam, says the same:

दन्तिनि दारुविकारे दारु तिरोभवति सोऽपि तत्रैव |
जगति तथा परमात्मा परमात्मन्यपि जगत्तिरोधते || 28 ||

In an elephant that is only a transformation of wood, the latter is
concealed and vice versa. So too the Supreme disappears in the world and
vice versa. In other words, only that which preoccupies the observer comes
into bold relief.

What is of significance here is that Shankara uses the 'vikāra' analogy to
demonstrate the vivarta concept. Just as the Upanishad does with the
clay-transformation analogy.

warm regards
