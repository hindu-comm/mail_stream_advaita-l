Man can learn from his life's experience. For example,
he must not keep company with those who trouble others. It is
because the troublesome person by nature will not spare anybody.
He will harm his friend also at times.

Some people find more pleasure in quarrelling with and
annoying others than pursuing their own interests. That is the
nature of some people. They are known as mean persons.

 उत्सवादपि नीचानां कलहोऽपि सुखायते |

 utsavaadapi niichaanaaM kalaho.api sukhaayate .

Hence, everyone should examine the character of the person
before developing friendship. Real friends are those who stand by
us through thick and thin, during happy times and misfortunes,
hardships from enemies or while receiving royal favours or
sharing grief in the graveyard.

 उत्सवे व्यसने प्राप्ते दुर्भिक्षे शत्रुसंकटे |
 राजद्वारे श्मशाने च यस्तिष्ठति स बान्धवः ||

 utsave vyasane praapte durbhixe shatrusaMkaTe .
 raajadvaare shmashaane cha yastishhThati sa baandhavaH ..

The mind of such people will be equanimous and their senses
pure. Their joy and prosperity will increase by leaps and bounds
in this as well as the next world. They will always be blessed.

 उत्सवादुत्सवं यान्ति स्वर्गात् स्वर्गं सुखात् सुखम् |
 श्रद्धानाश्च दान्ताश्च धनाढ्याः शुभकारिणः ||

 utsavaadutsavaM yaanti svargaat.h svargaM sukhaat.h sukham.h .
 shraddhaanaashcha daantaashcha dhanaaDhyaaH shubhakaariNaH ..

We bless all to understand this well and develop the tendency to
help others at all times.
