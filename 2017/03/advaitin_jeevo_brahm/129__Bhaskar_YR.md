praNAms Sri Sunil prabhuji

Hare Krishna

Why go into deatiled argumentation? Adi Shankara said that Agama-pramana is only required for (Shankara's Vedanta). I think it is said somewhere in the Shankara's Sarvasiddhantasangraha. Upanishad says "Sravam khalvidam Brahma". This creation, is Brahman, even though it is the creation of Maya, the Maya itself is the will of the Brahman to appear as many.

Ø     But as you know, problem is not simple as that due to illogical equation of this Ishwara’s  mAya with jeeva’s avidyA and shruti which says sarvaM khalvidaM brahma announcing that this jagat is gandharvanagari, svapnavat, mareechyudaka etc.  Holding this some would say jagat is mere jeeva bhrAnti and this mAya (nAma rUpAtmaka jagat) is kevala avidyA kalpita of the individual jeeva.  But yes, as you have rightly observed created jagat is brahman which is nothing but Shakti of shaktimAn and there is no bheda between Shakti and ShaktimAn.  There is a question : at some places it has been said that avyAkruta itself become vyAkruta and in other places the Ishwara did the conversion of avyAkruta into vyAkruta, how can it be?? Which one is correct ??  Shankara while answering this question clarifies : naisha dOshaH parasyApi AtmanaH avyAkrutajagadAtmatvena vivakshitatvAt.  Elsewhere shankara in sUtra bhAshya insists that : We have to accept that brahman itself  is the  prakruti i.e. upAdAna kAraNa as well as nimitta kAraNa.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!

bhaskar
