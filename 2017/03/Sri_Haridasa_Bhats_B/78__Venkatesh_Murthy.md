The big difference is we say Anirvachaneeya rajata is not Sat. It is not
real. We don't agree Mother is in Wife at Vyavahara level. Therefore no
Dosha in Patni Gamana.

You must understand Advaitis have accepted Vyavaharika Satya. In this there
is Bheda. We are only saying No Bheda in Paramarthika. At that stage there
