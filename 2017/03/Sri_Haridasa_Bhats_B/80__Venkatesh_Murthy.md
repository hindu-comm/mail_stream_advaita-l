Namaste

If you don't understand why I am using Sri Haridas Bhat's Khandana of
Sat Khyaati Vaada kindly do not make meaningless statements. We have
to accept the Khandana because Advaitis also say Silver in shell is
not Sat. Therefore partly we agree with Dvaitis on this point. Sat
Khyati Khandana is Ishta for us also. But at the same time we say
Silver in shell is not Asat also. On this point we can argue with
Dvaitis. I will write one more piece on how to handle Dvaitis.

>>  Please go with these explanations to Sri HaridAsa Bhatta to prove that all is fair in vyAvahArika satya and in pAramArtika there is no difference between wife and mother, see whether he agrees with your explanation.  Please remember, for the dvaitins we, the advaitins are more weaker pUrvapaxins (though influential )  with these comfortable distinctions (between vyAvahArika and pAramArthika) than the v.advaitins :-)  Since you are quoting his 'brilliant' presentation as a refutation to khyAti vAda, it is better to take his stand on these explanations as well I reckon.
