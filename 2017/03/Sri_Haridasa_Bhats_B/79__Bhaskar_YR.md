The big difference is we say Anirvachaneeya rajata is not Sat. It is not real. We don't agree Mother is in Wife at Vyavahara level. Therefore no Dosha in Patni Gamana.

You must understand Advaitis have accepted Vyavaharika Satya. In this there is Bheda. We are only saying No Bheda in Paramarthika. At that stage there is no bank account and no money also.

>  Please go with these explanations to Sri HaridAsa Bhatta to prove that all is fair in vyAvahArika satya and in pAramArtika there is no difference between wife and mother, see whether he agrees with your explanation.  Please remember, for the dvaitins we, the advaitins are more weaker pUrvapaxins (though influential )  with these comfortable distinctions (between vyAvahArika and pAramArthika) than the v.advaitins :-)  Since you are quoting his 'brilliant' presentation as a refutation to khyAti vAda, it is better to take his stand on these explanations as well I reckon.  

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
