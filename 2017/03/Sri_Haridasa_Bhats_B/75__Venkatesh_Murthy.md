Namaste

Visistadvaitis say there is no Illusion anywhere. The silver in shell
is actually there. Snake is there in rope. Water is there in the
mirage.

Sarvam Sarvaatmakam is the slogan. Everything is there in everything.
One best example Sri Haridasa Bhat gives from Nyaya Sudha is if Mother
is in Wife and Wife is in Mother there will be Matru Gamana Dosha
Pratyavaaya for a person even if he is doing only Patni Gamana.
