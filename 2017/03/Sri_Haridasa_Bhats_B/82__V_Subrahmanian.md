Dear Bhaskar ji,

There is no two views on this in Advaita, as far as I know.

Sat-asat-vilakṣanam means: The superimposed vastu is neither sat
(trikālabādhya like Brahman) nor asat (like hare's horn). What is stated as
'traikālika atyanta asat in the locus' also means this alone. The
difference between hare's horn type asat and this traikālika.....asat is
that the former cannot have pratīyamānatvam in any locus (that is, no one
can have the experience of perceiving a hare's horn anywhere) and the
latter is that it is perceived in a locus, just as a snake in a rope.  The
Dvaitin scholars know this well.

subbu
