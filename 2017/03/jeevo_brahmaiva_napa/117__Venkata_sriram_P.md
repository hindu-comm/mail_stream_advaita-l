Praveenji,

The beauty of dakshinamurti stotra is amazing and the commentary by Swayamprakasha Yati has added more beauty to that.  

See the vyAkhya here:

The crux lies is the complex sentence "dakshinamurti, having deluded by mAyA, becomes jIva".  This needs 
tremendous contemplation and meditation.

regs,
Sriram
