Namaste,

If the same medicine is applied to all, it would lead to wrong treatment.  The person is confused about about the
Ishwara tattva and if we say further that it is also mAya-kalpita, there is every danger that he may land in confusion 
which may lead him to agnosticism / atheism.

The first step is to instil Bhakti towards the Ishwara in the sAdhaka otherwise self-study of vedanta would 
lead to utter chaos.

आचार्य सायण says :

"परं सर्वस्मादुत्कृष्ट ब्रह्म परमार्थवस्तु ऋत सत्य अत्यन्तसत्यम । तादृशं ब्रह्म "जगदनुग्रहाय" दक्षिणे महेश्वरभागे ....."

It must be noted that the Supreme Brahman, the Absolute, manifested itself "out of compassion to 
uplift the individuals" as Maheshwara.....

The manifestation of saguNa-brahman as Ishwara is for upAsana and bhakti.  

Rest would follow with ईश्वरानुग्रं as the famous दहरविद्या मन्त्रः says:

"तमक्रतुं पश्यति वीतशोको धातुः प्रसादान्महिमानमीशम्"

Here, प्रसादान्महिमानमीशम् indicates the Ishwara anugraha

regs,
Sriram
