Namaste Sri Chandramouliji,

Yes indeed. I am not suggesting that we summarily abandon shruti, logic and
Ishvara - we certainly need them all.

However the same shruti also says neti, neti - so yes, by all means, let us
rely on shruti, Ishvara and tarka, but we have to be prepared to negate
everything negatable.

That being so, why repeatedly insist that my prakriyA is better than yours?
Both our prakriyAs come from shruti only - we are not making something up
independent of the shruti. If your prakriyA works for you, very good. If I
have questions or disagree with some aspect of it, I should seek
clarification from you. I see no point in repeatedly insisting that my
position is right, your position is wrong, if both our positions have to be
dropped eventually - ultimately what we both believe in is something which
is incapable of being negated.

Regards,
Venkatraghavan

Namaste Sri Venkatraghavan Ji,



Reg  << Any sambandha, even tAdAtmya or ananyatva, presupposes having
two entities between whom a sambandha is possible.>>,



Sri Bhagavatpada, in BSB 2-1-14, hence interprets *ananyatvam* which
literally means “not distinction” as equivalent to “not real distinction”
(taken from Prof Hiriyanna’s article on *what is ananyatvam* ).  The
sambandha between Brahman and Creation is one between Adhishthana and
AdhyAropa (ArOpita).



Reg  << Ultimately, no point getting attached to words and concepts like
kArya,

kAraNa, jIva, jagat, Ishavara, avidyA, mAya, satyam, Sankara said this,
vidyAraNya said that, etc - because Brahman is beyond all these, and we
have to necessarily drop every blessed thing in order to know that which is
beyond knowledge.>>,



Yes, undoubtedly. But unfortunately to  “drop every blessed thing in order
to know that which is
beyond knowledge”,  we need all the above “ to know that which is
beyond knowledge “.  Not that you are unaware of this. Nachiketas himself
asks the same question to Lord Yamadharmaraja for clarification.
