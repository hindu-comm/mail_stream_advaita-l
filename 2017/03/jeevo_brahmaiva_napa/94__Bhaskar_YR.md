praNAms Sri Balagopal Ramkrishnan prabhuji
Hare Krishna

The part 1 and part 2 of the Bri Up. 1.4.7, namely  'shrushti prakaraNam' and 'pravesa prakaraNam' respectively will also help in solving the equation :- 'Brahma satyam jagan mithya' - by part 1.  'jIvo brahmaiva na parah ' - by part 2 

>  If possible kindly give more details on these two parts...as you know, in all probability the same bhAshya vAkya-s would mean differently to two different persons :-) 


PS: As Sriram Ji rightly said a simple example of gold and ornaments etc used in the adhyaropa apavAda method will be more useful in one's initial days of learning.  

>  No, this tAdAtmyata between kArya-kAraNa has been extended to even 'brahma vAdins' as well, for him also kArya is NOT mere a fragment of imagination of an individual soul (jeeva kalpita)...So, seeing the gold in place of ring despite the continuous existence of ring is what is called kAraNa / svarUpa drushti which brahmavAdins realize fully.  

Otherwise the 'mAya' will leave a mumukshu more confused. And as he rightly said - most will choose the easiest route - run awaaaaay !

>  mAya is brahma Shakti when it comes to the topic of creation...this Shakti has been used by Ishwara to do the creation for the sake of jeeva-s and Ishwara providing this platform to jeeva-s to  experience their respective karma phala-s.  Yes, a mumukshu will be more confused if he wrongly equates his ajnAna / avidyA with the Ishwara srushti mAya thinking on the terms like both mAyA and avidyA are synonyms. 

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
