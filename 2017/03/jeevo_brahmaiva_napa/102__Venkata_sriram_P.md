Namaste,

There is also another angle of perceiving the मिथ्या aspect of जगत् .  

There is a logical fallacy in the concept of cause & effect.  It is this fallacy of कार्य-कारण संबन्धः 
that has been mentioned in the 8th shloka of Dakshinamurti Stotra.

विश्वं पश्यति कार्यकारणतया स्वस्वामिसंबन्धतः
शिष्याचार्यतया तथैव पितृपुत्राद्यात्मना भेदतः ।
स्वप्ने जाग्रति वा य एष पुरुषो मायापरिभ्रामितः
तस्मै श्री गुरुमूर्तये नम इदं श्रीदक्षिणामूर्तये ॥ ८ ॥

Deluded by माया one sees the world in duality as cause & effect which is a fallacy.  This fallacious logic 
can't be cracked and hence the कार्य-कारण संबन्धः in the form of जगत् is मायाकल्पितं and hence
मिथ्या

Even westerners have also concluded that the logic of cause-effect is fallacious. 

This is another aspect of explanation which was taught to me while undergoing the adhyayana
of Dakshinamurti Stotra.

regs,
Sriram
