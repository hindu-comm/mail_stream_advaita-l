Namaste Praveenji,
True. kArya and kAraNa are simply two words, the substance is only one.
That being so, how can there be any sambandha when there is only one
substance? Any sambandha, even tAdAtmya or ananyatva, presupposes having
two entities between whom a sambandha is possible.

Ultimately, no point getting attached to words and concepts like kArya,
kAraNa, jIva, jagat, Ishavara, avidyA, mAya, satyam, Sankara said this,
vidyAraNya said that, etc - because Brahman is beyond all these, and we
have to necessarily drop every blessed thing in order to know that which is
beyond knowledge.

Regards,
Venkatraghavan
