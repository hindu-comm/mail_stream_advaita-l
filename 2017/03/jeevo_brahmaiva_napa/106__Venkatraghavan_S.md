Shankaracharya says this in the bhAShya to kArika 4.12  -

कारणाद्यद्यनन्यत्वमतः कार्यमजं तव ।
जायमानाद्धि वै कार्यात्कारणं ते कथं ध्रुवम् ॥ १२ ॥

उक्तस्यैवार्थस्य स्पष्टीकरणार्थमाह — कारणात् अजात् कार्यस्य यदि
अनन्यत्वमिष्टं त्वया, ततः कार्यमप्यजमिति प्राप्तम् । इदं
चान्यद्विप्रतिषिद्धं कार्यमजं चेति तव । किञ्चान्यत् , कार्यकारणयोरनन्यत्वे
जायमानाद्धि वै कार्यात् कारणम् अनन्यन्नित्यं ध्रुवं च ते कथं भवेत् ? न हि
कुक्कुट्या एकदेशः पच्यते, एकदेशः प्रसवाय कल्प्यते ॥

This has been explained further thus - if your favoured position is that
the effect is non-different from the unborn cause, then the effect also is
unborn. But it is contradictory to say a thing is an effect, and at the
same time, unborn. Moreover, if the cause and effect are non-different, how
can it be for you that the cause, which is non-different from the born
effect, be eternal and non-changeable? It is not possible to imagine that a
part of a hen is laying eggs while another part is being cooked.
