Bhaskar-ji,

////////////

The so called logical fallacy will not be there when one understand 

///

I am aware of the advaita-siddhAnta and also aware that सत् only exists.  

My point of emphasis was to state that Sankara has refuted various erroneous 
concepts like असत्कार्यवादः  and सत्कार्यवादः etc with the usage of विश्वं पश्यति कार्यकारणतया.

The one who is deluded perceives the Jagat as कार्य​-कारण संबन्धः that has been refuted
owing to अन्योन्याश्रय दोषः associated hence मिथ्या .  It is this मिथ्या which is 
called "falsity" which is the derivative of "fallacy". 

This logical fallacy even westerners agreed in the "cause-effect phenomena".

This is what I wanted to convey.  Rest of your statements are too hasty.  You didn't 
catch my point hence no comments from me.

regs,
sriram
