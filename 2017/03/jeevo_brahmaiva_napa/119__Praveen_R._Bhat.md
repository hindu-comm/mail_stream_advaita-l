True. ​​Precisely why I said I like the आत्मनेपद usage. कुरुते conveys a
lot more to me there than करोति (just thinking inline with Panini Sutra
१.३.७२ स्वरितञितकर्त्रभिप्राये क्रियाफलम्)।​ As I mentioned Laghu/
Tattvasudha or Manasollasa, both do not cover why Atmanepada usage, I have
seen bits of both. However, to me, the entire explanation is itself
justifying the Atmanepada word, which by itself beautifully covers all that
they say.
