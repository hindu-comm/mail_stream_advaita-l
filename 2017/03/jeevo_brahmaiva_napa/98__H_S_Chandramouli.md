Sri Vidyasankar Ji wrote



<< I have not seen any text that says jIva brahmaiva na paraH. The actual
pAda of the verse, as found in the brahmajnAnAvalImAlA, a prakaraNa
grantha, is as follows -

jIva brahmaiva nAparaH, (i.e. na aparaH).>>,



Vedanta Dindima also reads the same (as mentioned in the translation into
kannada and commentary by Sri SSS).



ब्रम्ह सत्यम् जगन्मिथ्या जीवो ब्रम्हैव नापरः । जीवन्मुक्तस्तु
तद्विद्वानिति वेदान्तडिण्डिमः॥




bramha satyam jaganmithyA jIvo bramhaiva nAparaH | jIvanmuktastu
tadvidvAniti vedAntaDiNDimaH||



In his commentary, Sri SSS clearly states as follows  ( Translation mine )
<< Brahman which is of the nature of SatchidAnandarUpa,
nityashudhamuktasvarUpa is the only satya
​ ;
  because its AtmasvarUpa is never changing. Jagat which is
nAmarUpAtmaka,consisting of numerous kartru-bhoktrus, displaying kriya
phalAs dictated  by time and space, experienced through pramanAs like
pratyaksha etc is mithya
​;
because it is always changing.  >> .
