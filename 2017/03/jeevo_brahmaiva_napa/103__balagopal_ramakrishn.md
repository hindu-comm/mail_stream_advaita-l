Namaste,
>>>cause & effect which is a fallacy.
'Cause and effect' is always within 'time and space' and thus fall within the category of 'kAryam'; whereas 'Brahman' is defined as 'kArya-kAraNa vilakshaNa', 'kAladesAtIta' etc. When everything is negated, the one left standing and which cannot be negated is the observer himSELF.
Also as science too confirms that matter can neither be created nor destroyed, so 'creation' per se is not the right way to understand. With 'mAya' one is able to satiate the inquisitiveness until the 'realness' of the so called perceived 'reality' is correctly understood as 'seemingly real' aka 'mithya'.

There is also another angle of perceiving the मिथ्या aspect of जगत् . 

There is a logical fallacy in the concept of cause & effect. It is this fallacy of कार्य-कारण संबन्धः 
that has been mentioned in the 8th shloka of Dakshinamurti Stotra.

विश्वं पश्यति कार्यकारणतया स्वस्वामिसंबन्धतः
शिष्याचार्यतया तथैव पितृपुत्राद्यात्मना भेदतः ।
स्वप्ने जाग्रति वा य एष पुरुषो मायापरिभ्रामितः
तस्मै श्री गुरुमूर्तये नम इदं श्रीदक्षिणामूर्तये ॥ ८ ॥

Deluded by माया one sees the world in duality as cause & effect which is a fallacy. This fallacious logic 
can't be cracked and hence the कार्य-कारण संबन्धः in the form of जगत् is मायाकल्पितं and hence
मिथ्या

Even westerners have also concluded that the logic of cause-effect is fallacious. 

This is another aspect of explanation which was taught to me while undergoing the adhyayana
of Dakshinamurti Stotra.

regs,
Sriram
