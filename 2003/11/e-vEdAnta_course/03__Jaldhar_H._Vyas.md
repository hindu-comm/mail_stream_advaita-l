I wholeheartedly agree.  When a student approached a teacher what did he
offer him?  A bundle of sticks.  Why?  Because they are needed as fuel for
the yajna.  That's it.  Now gifts may be given and such dana confers
great punya but they should be freely given.  Even now there are saintly
scholars who live in poverty because they fear "selling the Veda" like
vegetables in the market.

Perhaps Swami Tejomayananda was absent for the e-course which taught a
sannyasi doesn't need $350 for anything?
