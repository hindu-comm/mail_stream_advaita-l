hariH OM !!

Do the members think that a eVedanta course which
seeks/suggests minimum $ 350 per year be promoted ??

Can the knowledge of Vedanta be sold in 24 e-mail
capsules and concluded with a certificate (for what
purpose !! ). Do whatever you can to defeat any trend
of minimum fee/donation based Vedanta education. Let
us tell everybody that Vedanta is priceless Knowledge
of the great Rishis of yore and practiced now by
devoted seekers.

Om Namo Narayanaya !!
