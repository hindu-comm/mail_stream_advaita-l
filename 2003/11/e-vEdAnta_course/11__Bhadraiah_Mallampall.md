Shri. Vishwanthan Krishnamoorthy

Sir, if you permit me to remind you, honorable list members were too harsh 
on both ends..

- that there are institutions already in place and no need for new ones.

- that we need new institutions as we have no more kings.

May I elaborate for my own clarity, that the ground rules have always been 
there since ancient times and they need not be changed.

But the physical institutions need to be upgraded to modern laws or new ones 
created depending on place and time, because the new 'kings' do not help us 
any more but they are ready to demand income taxes. This is also needed to 
tackle the modern aashaaDhabhootis - the insincere students who are capable 
of doing U-turns.

Best regards
Bhadraiah
