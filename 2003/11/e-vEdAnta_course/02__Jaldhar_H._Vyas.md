Becoming a doctor is hard.  One has to wait to be accepted into a medical
college, study for years, complete a residency etc.  You can end up
waiting 10 years to do one little operation.  None of us today are
qualified (or even ready!) for that level of discipline.

So instead we should just spend $350 for an email course in meat-carving
right?

You don't need to be a prophet to realize that any enterprise that does
not challenge but aims for the lowest common denominator will not come to
a good end.
