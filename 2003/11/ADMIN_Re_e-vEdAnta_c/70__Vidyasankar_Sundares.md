I think the discussion on this topic is getting quite out of hand. Each of 
us falls somewhere within the wide spectrum of opinions regarding the 
e-course organized by the Chinmaya mission and the charging of fees for it. 
In my opinion, it is not proper to discuss details of that organization's 
functioning on our list. It is not part of the purpose of the Advaita-l 
list, period. A number of us have expressed our views and that should be 
enough for now. I request list members not to continue this thread, unless 
there is something completely new to add. Also, please observe our usual 
list policies on number of postings per day/week and the length of each 
posting.

In general, with respect to any organization that a member of this list 
might be involved in, if there are legitimate issues/complaints/criticisms 
about daily functioning or methods or policies, they should be raised within 
the context of that organization, in forums associated with the said 
organization. Not here.
