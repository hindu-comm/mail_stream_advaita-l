namasthe,

 I was reading the presentation on advaita of
shri Krishna Iyer.

 There in part-III the following topic comes.
http://www.katha.org/Academics/Advaita-PT-III.html
I've  a few questions which I've given after this paragraph in this mail.

=====================

Section 10  Creation of the world  :
=====================================

"The Advaita concept of creation is called vivarta 
vada. Brahman , the Existence-Consciousness does not 
undergo change when creation takes place.  What 
modifies are names and forms (  nama  roopa ) . The 
potential state of nama roopa  is called Maya . Maya 
as no  existence of its own. It is a thing of a lower 
order of reality superimposed on Brahman.  No 
superimposition  ( superimposition of the unreal on 
the real is called  adhyasa  in Sanskrit)  can 
xist unless there is a substrastum ( called  
adhishtanam in Sanskrit)   The consciousness aspect 
of Brahman is reflected in Maya. Maya plus reflected 
onsciousness is 
==> called Iswara. Iswara visualises the world-to-be 
and impels Maya to unfold the potential nama roopa as 
differentiated nama roopa on the substratum of the 
Existence Consciousness Infinity called Brahman.  
Bahman as Existence-Consciousness-Infinity is the 
substratum for the superimposition 
==>of the potential Nama roopa as well as the differentiated Nama roopa. Brahman  does not undergo 
any change. However since Maya does not  exist 
separate from Brahman, Brahman is called vivarta 
upadhana  karanam (changeless material cause) of the 
world and Maya is called the  parinama upadhana 
karanam ( changing material cause) of the world."
==========

Here, can someone explain the lines between 
the "==>"s ?

What is differentiated nama roopa and potential nama 
roopa ?

Is potential nama roopa simply (all possible) 
unmanifested  nama roopa that Maya can unfold into ?

And does differentiated nama roopa mean all the nama 
roopa after Maya  unfolds or manifests ? 

namasthe
Prasad
