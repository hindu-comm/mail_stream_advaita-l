Can someone explain how the word vairochaniim  in the mantra "taam agni
varNaam ..." is interpreted by traditional bhaashhya-s? If possible, can you
post the explanation in sanskrit, as given in the text?

I have come across to two brief translations of this term.

a) RK Math, Swami Ashutoshananda [Vedic Mantras Tamil translation]

   One who belongs to the Lord

b) RK Math, aNNa (subrahmanya aiyar) [devii suukta-s Tamil translation]

   One who is known through the eye of wisdom

I can see how they come to this rendering based on MWD. But would like to
know how it is explained in any of the traditional commentaries.


TIA
