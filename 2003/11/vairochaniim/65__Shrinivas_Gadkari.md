Namaste,

Did some search on the Internet and here is 
something that may be of interest:

vairochana has been adopted as a name for one
of the buddha-s. It represents the illuminating
quality like the brilliance of the sun. 

So vairochanIm might refer to the illuminating
luster of durgA devI, considering the fact that
she is already tapasA jvalantIm.

Regards,
Shrinivas

ps. No intentions to link durgA sUkta to Buddhism.
Just used the Buddhist reference as a guide to
find the meaning.
