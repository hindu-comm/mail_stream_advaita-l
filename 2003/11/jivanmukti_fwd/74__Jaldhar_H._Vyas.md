[Forwarded message from Badri Narayanan]

I would also like to add a statement made by swami sivananda
" A jivanmukta can do any activity like eating, singing and enjoying
nature. He can even marvel at the beauty of a woman. But he can also turn
his attention completely to his own self thus making his eyes as empty
sockets. Can a normal man do this!?"
