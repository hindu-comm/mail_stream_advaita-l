Namaste:

The electronic book, " ADVAITA VEDANTA: A PRESENTATION FOR
BEGINNERS by D Krishna Ayyar is available in the WEB for interested
members.

The book contains 3 major parts with a detailed appendix and a
comprehensive Glossary. Those who want to get answers
to "Everything that always want to know, but afraid to ask!"

My quick reading convince me that this is a very good book for list
members who want to get the perspectives of Vedanta.
