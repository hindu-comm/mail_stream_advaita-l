Dear members,

Do anyone know if the present Puri Sankaracharya, Swami Nischalananda Saraswati, is a disciple of the late Swami Hariharananda Saraswati (Karapatri Swami)? I have been told that in the late 1970´s and early 1980´s one Swami Nischalananda Saraswati visited (or rather stayed) in Vrindavan at the ashram of Swami Akhandananda Saraswati, and this Nischalalanda was a disciple of Karapatri Swami. I just want to know if this Nischalananda is identical with the Puri Sankaracharya.

Best regards
Stig Lundgren
