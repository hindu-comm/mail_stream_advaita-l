namasthe,

 Can someone explain the difference between
the physical structure of tombs/shrines for
jivan mukthas and other mahAns ? If so, can
someone kindly explain it elaborately ?  I heard
that Sri Ramana Maharishi asked people
to build a unique looking shrine for His Mother,
a cow called Lakshmi and a muslim man 
named Masthan.

 Secondly, is there any difference in the shrAddham/
yearly ceremony procedure for a jivan muktha and 
others ? I've heard once, that the coconut has to 
be kept horizontally in the kumbam/kalasam for a jivan 
muktha's shrAddham.

 Someone kindly explain.

namasthe
Prasad
