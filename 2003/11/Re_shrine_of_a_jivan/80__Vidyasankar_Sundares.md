We have to carefully see whether the person is question was a sannyAsi, and 
if yes, whether there were a wife and children before becoming a sannyAsi or 
whether the sannyAsa state was taken up without going through marriage at 
all. In the last case, there is no SrAddham to be done. In all other cases, 
SrAddham is to be performed. All saMskAras, including funeral related 
rituals, pertain to the physical body. So the children born out of the body 
of a person who later became a sannyAsi have a duty to perform the SrAddham. 
The idea is that we should not shirk the duty of performing SrAddham by 
appealing that a forefather was a jIvanmukta and therefore not in need of 
this ritual. I'm sure there are more specific answers for complicated cases, 
which expert scholars will be able to resolve, but the above is the general 
situation.
