So, why not a cheaper, low-priced alternative for
those we do not can not donate $ 350 ???

Becasue the degrees referred above have relevance in
the Indian society for recognition and livelyhood, and
they can fulfill a social need/demand for qualified
and reliable, and well trained people/priests etc. for
social/religious ceremonies and such schools. But,
this certificate course has no meaning to grown up
adults, except to decise that those people can become
study-group leaders etc. (new ideas coming, as we
already put the cart before the horse, we should push
the cart than to pull it) All, if someone cares.

Personally, it would have been intereting if it was
done to motivate young kids. By the way why does not
the Bala Vihar program have certificates ? Do you know
?

Om Namo Narayanaya !!
