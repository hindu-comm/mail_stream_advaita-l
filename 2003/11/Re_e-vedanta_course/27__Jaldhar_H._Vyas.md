You are painting a very bleak picture of the leaders and followers of the
Chinmaya Mission.  FWIw, I haven't taken much interest in the CM's
activities in my area but  I know some some people who are involved and
they seem quite decent and sincere to me.

I don't think this thread should turn into a referendum on the CM.  It's
not my intention anyway.  Rather it's the issues of economics, innovation
etc.  that we should think about.

Though it's not something we should be proud of either, this at least can
be somewhat excused by saying that mandirs and karma kanda are for
personal benefit, i.e. Dharma, Artha, and Kama.  Advaita Vedanta on the
other hand is for moksha and it requires vairagya.  Appealing to peoples
greed and stupidity is not going to promote vairagya anymore than feeding
fat people junk food is going to promote weight loss.

Yes but these titles are based on results i.e. mastering ghana patha not
completing x amount of lessons or giving x amount of money.

And again these are worldly pursuits.  Being a Shrauti doesn't guarantee
Mukti.
