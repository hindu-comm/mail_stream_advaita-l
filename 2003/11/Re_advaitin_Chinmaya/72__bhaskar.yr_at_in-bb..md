praNAm prabhuji-s
Hare Krishna

I am bit confused about this course & media of teaching & need learned
members clarification.  Is it not mandatory that aspirant should undergo
upanayanam (sacred thread ceremony) before formally taking vedAdhyayana ??
Apart from this all dvijas should fulfill all customary obligations like
nitya & naimittika karma (sandhyavandanam & nitya devatArchana etc.) before
taking veda pAtha in a traditional manner according to dharma shAstras.
How CM check the eligibility of desired candidates in this e-media course??

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
