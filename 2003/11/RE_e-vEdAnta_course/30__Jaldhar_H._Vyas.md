I know that at the time of the Gujarat earthquake, the Swaminarayan
sampradaya mobilized thousands of dollars within days.  Some local
businessmen sent their Guruji a blank check and asked him to fill in
whatever amount is necessary.  Now how come these Vaishnavas (not
especially well-educated ones at that) are able to perform this miracle
that we can't?

Fine if should treat it like a business, let's judge it like a business.

So -- strictly from a "realistic" perspective -- do you agree that it is
horribly overpriced?  Can we expect consumers to go for shoddy overpriced
goods?  Especially when the business doesn't have a monopoly and better
competing products are readily available?  Remember all this is from a
business perspective.

The reason more people don't think this way is because of course a charity
isn't a business.  Although as a conservative Republican I feel funny
saying it :) Capitalism doesn't dominate every facet of human behaviour.
Religious institutions have a higher, moral, imperative that overrides
all other concerns.

Given that many of the key concepts of Advaita Vedanta are
represented by Sanskrit words which have no exact English analogue, what
other measure would you propose?  I understand that not everyone knows
Sanskrit.  This is a pedagogical problem.  But they are going to have to
learn sooner or later.  I notice that CIF also has an e-course in
Sanskrit.  Wouldn't it make more sense for the unprepared to take that
before studying Vedanta?  Individual guidance from a Guru would advise you
of such things.

>  What would you have then? A course tailor made for each student?

Yes.  For the simple reason that its the _only_ way that works.  Remember
the goal of Advaita Vedanta is not a product but self-transformation.
Jnana is fundamentally unsuitable for mass production.

It gets a share if it deserves it.  Even the Devas only get the share of
the yajna they deserve not more, not less.

Institutions come and go.  Our Dharma is sanatana.

True.  So why hasn't your job been eliminated then if it is futile?
Because there are various grades of less than perfect.

Perhaps.  Maybe between us we can fully think this out.  This is why we
need to debate such initiatives instead of passing on them without
comment.
