What I disagree with is not new ideas but this underlying premise that the
best is infeasible and we have to settle for second best.  In what field
of human endeavour do you hear of such a thing?  Low expectations
inevitably lead to low outcomes.

Indian children in the US have a reputation for being good students.  Is
this because they are genetically smarter than everyone else?  Far from
it.  The reason is because Indian parents demand it.  Nobody tells their
children that a C is all they are capable of so that's all they should aim
for.   But the message I'm getting from you is that we can only hope to be
C students in Advaita Vedanta.

It is not uncommon in New York to see people, even teenagers wearing a
Vaishnava tilaka.  I've yet to see anyone other than myself with a
tripundra.  Because Smartas are paralyzed by these low expectations.
Vaishnava parents demand their children become A+ Vaishnavas.  Sure they
have their worries and problems too but I predict a brighter future for
them than us if we keep on the present course.  (I'm talking about the
Gujarati community but I think you'll find it's the same amongst South
Indians.)

Advaita Vedanta.

Btw, let me make it clear I consider advaita-l to be a poor alternative to
finding a proper Guru also.

Why not?  Did you follow the link sent by Prasad?  All these Pathashalas
are open right now.  All of them are accepting pupils right now.  These
_are_ Vedic times as much as ever.

What is the modern environment?  Advaita Vedanta doesn't teach weakness
and despondency.  Time and place are Maya.  YOU have the power to make
them.  YOU are capable of finding God regardless of the circumstances
because God is within you always.

Of course Maya is a treacherous and hard obstacle to overcome.  But we
have the assurance of our holy ancestors that it can be overcome.

As a supplement it's ok but not as a replacement.

And this is why I'm spending so much energy on this topic.  I don't
believe it is well thought out or properly cognizant of the modern
context.

Nobody is perfect.  Nobody is exempt from judgement either.
