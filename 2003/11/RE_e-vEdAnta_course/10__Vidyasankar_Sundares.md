While I do agree with the perspective of our list members who have raised 
questions
about the efficacy of an e-course for which people pay a fixed amount, I 
would like
to point out that running an organization involves expenses. In our 
contemporary
times, I think it is not unjustified for an organization to ask for a fee 
paid beforehand.
It also ensures that mostly only serious people enroll. Granted, there will 
be the few
who think they can throw money at something and get all problems sorted out, 
but
such people will not gain much from undergoing the course. Hopefully, those 
who
enroll for an e-course will gain some perspective that will kindle their 
interest.
