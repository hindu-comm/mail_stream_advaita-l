This is precisely my starting point. As young,
business minded or business savy vedantic students get
there in a mission of this nature, they change the
goals and direction of the organisation. This is
precisely the time when you expect the leader to make
critical decisions. After all we credit Swami T only
for the success of 50 years of Chinmaya Mission, not
necessarily the fellow how dug trenches. So, also
criticism goes to the leaders. Root out business minds
from such important decisions. It is not an
organisational committee formulated to organise the 50
year function. At times, we need to look at
organisations in similar lines and learn from them.
Why are they not doing it ? Can we stop and think ?

So, why not serve who do not and can not donate $ 350 
but lives in US; or those we do not know any thing
about Vedanta who can enthusiastically donate $ 350. I
did not see any such provision in the course.

This was precisely my complaint. I have been a member
of Chinmaya Mission activities for atleast 3 years.
When the new technology came why did I not receive an
e-mail from the Central Chinmaya Mission ? Who
authorised a Raffle ticket mailer and who denied a new
communication with the patrons ? If Sankara Matha had
asked me money to read their e-mails, I would have
flatly withdrawn from their lists. Instead of using
the power of new technology to bring people together,
we have devised a new plan to bring a few rich folks
(who may not care to read the e-mails because of their
business schedules.  How do I know ???) and some
highly enthusiastic patrons together. What an abuse of
new tools ??? On the positive side what a huge
community of Chinmaya Members could have been created,
so serve all, as vasudhiva kutumbakam.

This is not pre-mature judgment. We are debating after
the course announcements have gone out.

There is no discussion about intentions. But, the
methodology does not appeal to me, and I am sure there
are others like me. Just like one group wants to
change the world, the other also wants to serve the
people by propagating their views.

Om Namo Narayanaya !!
