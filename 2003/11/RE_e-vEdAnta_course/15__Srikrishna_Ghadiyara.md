The $ 350 is not a donation, it is a FEE. If there is
genuinity, I should have donated to a US center, so
that I could save Tax. Why should I pay Uncle Sam for
reading Vedanta e-mails ? I could use my Dollars
fully, for the benefit of a charitable cause as
approved by law. Did some one think about this aspect
of Fee ? sorry, ...DONATION.

Om Namo Narayanaya !!
