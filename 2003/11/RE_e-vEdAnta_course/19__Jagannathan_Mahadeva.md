Namaste,

I am completely in support of the e-course in Vedanta.

One of the expectations from Jaldhar is that one should go to a Patashala
instead of an e-course. How many of us are ready to do that?

Sincerity in learning a subject follows an interest in the subject.

Interest in the subject is aroused only after an exposure to it at an
elementary level (or an advanced level depending on the person).

The e-course, although lacking in the human touch, will definitely kindle
the interest in people who until that moment are unaware of such a thing
as Advaita Vedanta.

Now, it may be said that Advaita_L may fulfill that requirement of
exposure. I think it does and so does the e-course!

When we can have an Advaita_L why not an e-course!

I recall a story of how Swami Chinmayandji had to convince his guru
of his wish to go to the people to inform them about Advaita Vedanta.
Obviously, had he thought of the points noted by Jaldhar he would never
have reached out to as many people as he has now!

Thanks,
Jagannathan.
