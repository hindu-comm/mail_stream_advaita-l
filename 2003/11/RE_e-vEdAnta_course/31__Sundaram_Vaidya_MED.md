Namaskaram.

 (I am trying to collate several posts from Srikrishna Ghadiyaram here

Lets see for a moment ... you want to "donate" only if it's tax
deductible, and that too only "for your own satisfaction". That's not
donation. That's quid pro quo. Same with students expecting a
certificate in return ... lets not be hypocrites please.

>From the perspective of the ordinary, otherwise uninformed seeker, whom
is he to believe? Any one who will give him free advice? And do you
realize just how many people there are out there who will give lots of
"apparently" free advice? With so many people out there to cheat you out
of your money, whom would you rather trust. A mission that is generally
recognized as a charitable org. which is run ethically, morally and
legally? or some other ...?

But you are ok with spending money to buy a book which has 24 chapters? 

And why are you against this "mininum" donationg thing? You seem
surprised and seem to have a sense or righteous indignation about it all
... have you been to the upanyaasams or "hari kathas" as they are also
called, where the organizers expect people to donate a minimum amount?
This is to defray the costs of the organization. The world is run on
money. Even the Vedas recognize this. That's exactly why there is so
much material on the vedas devoted to the karma kaanda and kaamya karma.

What are you talking about?? Have you not seen books published by the
mission that is subsidised so that every one can buy it? How do you
think they get the money for that?? By running course like this!! And
selling the same book in the US in hard cover and jazzy persentation to
people who can afford it for $50 while giving it for 50 rupees in India
under a paperback edition.

Well, you are the one who thinks this money is going to be used to build
a new mission in his name. You brought it up. Don't fault the other side
for pointing it out and defending the authors or the mission

I think over all I have laid out what I see as hypocrisy, and I don't
think I need to go into further details of the many more mails on this
subject.

bhava shankara desikame sharaNam,
Vaidya.
