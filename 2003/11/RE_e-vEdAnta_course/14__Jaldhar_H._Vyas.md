I notice the sample lesson you reference does not mention any shastras at
all just unspecified "Indian masters"  In fact exactly two Sanskrit words
are mention in the first two lessons.

Fine, but here we are concerned with those who would like to approach it
through Advaita Vedanta.

You are right.  What specifically is claiming is "a unique method to study
Vedanta[sic], in the form of easy lessons"  This is the criteria by which
we are measuring the value of this course.

Btw shouldn't even introductory students be informed that Advaita is just
one kind of Vedanta?

Unfortunately the first two lessons do little to convince me.  But this
proves the point.  There is no way such a rigid framework could meet the
needs of such a wide range of students.

Unlike a business, one expects an organization that purports to be
religious to only make money by moral means.  Is it worth selling ones
soul for the sake of mortgage, utility and maintenance bills?  If people
have to bribed into donating with certificates, there are deeper problems
than can be solved with an e-course.

Again fine.  But are you saying that if the Swami appealed for funds to
his followers explaining why such a foundation is necessary they would not
provide?  He talks in his lesson about how we need to stop thinking about
everything in terms of a profit motive and work from a sense of duty.  Why
not hold prospective students to this standard?

Then which yard scale?  If someone came to you on the subway and asked you
for $350 would you "judge them" or just hand it over without a murmur?
God provided us with brains.  Why must religion be the only subject in
which we are not allowed to make use of them?

Ah the old "times have changed" argument.  Sorry but _right_now_ not in
the mythical past, you can get a thorough education in Advaita Vedanta
free of charge and free of hype.

I'll tell you what.  I'll put "my money where my mouth is" so to speak and
offer 28 free email lessons on Advaita Vedanta to anyone who wants them.
No charge, give whatever you think its worth to me or to the charity of
your choice (even CIF :-)

Any takers?

I'm quite sure Swami Tejomayananda is sincere in what he is doing.  And I
too know many followers of Chinmaya mission who are doing sterling
service.  But that does not excuse them from scrutiny.  As the saying
goes, the road to Hell is paved with good intentions.
