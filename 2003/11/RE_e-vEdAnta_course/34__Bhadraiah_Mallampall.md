Dear list members,

The duality of guru and shishya must be removed before mukti. Nature is the 
best teacher, but unfortunately nature doesn't say much, so we need 
teachers. Before going for a teacher it is good idea to exhaust our own 
resources first. Only then we realize importance of the teacher.

But who said mukti is the ultimate goal for everybody? It is the goal only 
for those who understand the futility of the objects. For others it is 
partly materialistic and partly adhyatmic, on a sliding scale. As you go 
down you compromise more and more. I have seen satsangs where the 'certified 
administrator' of the satsang decides the conclusion of a discussion, and 
ignores stronger arguments using his 'authority'.

All said, we still need to encourage these activities because something is 
better than nothing. Some dharma is better than no dharma.

BTW, Vaidic texts not only offer merit (titles of vajapayee etc), but also 
caution the risk of demerits if mistakes are made. Participants of a vedanta 
course must be warned that the certificates may not be worth the paper.

Best regards
Bhadraiah
