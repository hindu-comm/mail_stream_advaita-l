hariH Om !!

I am forwarding this e-mail to the list, because I
think it is still within the scope of the original
topic, i.e right method and tools of
teaching/propagating Vedanta for its bright future
patronage.

No, put both English sentences together and compare:

I said, "I should have donated to a US center, so
that I could save Tax. "

You said that I said, "I want  to "donate" only if
it's tax deductible". 

Are they same ? I guess, I do not know as much English
as you know. 

Even if you interpret what you are saying is the only
meaning, where is my hypocricy ? What is wrong in
donating to US CM center, just as we did for Gujarat
Relief ? 

If I earn $ 500, and I donate, the organisation gets $
500, but if you want me to pay after tax the
organisation gets $ 350. 

You told me that you ran a charitable organisation.
What happened to that experience to see simple math
and benefit to the patrons, who are the sole
supporters of the mission  and the mission itself with
the possibility of the mission getting more money. The
same incentive is offered to Bala Vihar Program
enrollment. I guess you know that.

Whether I donate before Tax or after Tax, it is still
a "Donation". or do you have a different name for that
? It becomes a donation, if I am not getting in return
any service/product, and/or the same is available for
anyone seeking it, without obligation of money.

I feel sad that the word "Donation" is being
mis-interpreted, and conveniently mis-used by you and
in turn you are branding me a "hypocrite"

Did I discuss with you in any of my mails about the
certificate ?? 

I said, donations are given for one's own
satisfaction. That is all. Only then it becomes a
donation, otherwise it may be extortion.

Certificate is a different matter. If someone is going
to donate for the satisfaction of certificate, you may
do it, as you please. It does not concern me. But,
when it becomes a possible tool for appeal, all I said
is that it defeats the purpose.

HEY ! (just like you) who said my point of view is the
only valid. I thought we are still debating pros and
cons, all with the best interest of vedantic education
and teaching methods.

Yes, I continued the thread, when some one (I do not
know if it is you)  posted informing the public about
this eVedanta course on the list. But, I knew about
the course before that. But, the post on the list was
a good starting point for debate. Possibly some
feedback will go back to the Mission, as there are
many CM patrons on this list. Let whatever good should
come out of this debate come out.

Another one !! ?? You call me a 'hypocrite', that is
fine, on what basis ? Do you know the meaning of
'hypocrite' ?. I just saw the meaning on www.m-w.com 
It says "a person who puts on a false appearance of
virtue or religion"

What false appearance am I making in presenting my
argument ? I am not trying to hide any thing. Only
thing is I am being fearless in calling a spade a
spade. I am not judging any thing. I am just
presenting what has been the traditional practice, and
what is being done now. Let individuals decide what
they please. This being a forum, I voiced my opinion.

I did not say that you mix-up my paragraphs with Sri
Jaladhar's. Did I ?

You mixed up paragraphs from my writings, from two
different places. That is enough to mis-interpret and
draw wrong conclusions.  

I have the e-mails and I read a couple of times before
I post, and I even read after posting. You can read
the archives. I guess, you know how to.

How you write is your convenience. But, as you know,
the objective is to make others understand, not for
your convenience only. What all I am saying is that if
you read them in the way they are written, without
taking pieces out of order. They make more sense.

So, charging $ 350 will not make it more genuine or

Can you see clearly, that you are mis-quoting ? Why
did you omit the middle paragraph of yours for which
my reply was "So, charging ...". But, you skipped the
middle paragraph of yours and confusing yourself, and
possibly some other gullible fellows.

And to that you added additional comments in this mail
from your side ...

I said originally that "teaching" comes first, and the
objective of buildings comes later, if it has to....

As I said several times, I read the posts that come to
me and also those I post.

I did not miss it. I added two more names to that, of
Divine Life Society, Arsha Vidya and also said
countless others. Infact, I have referred to
'parampara'.

That is what I precisely said. I did not use the words
'Swami T' or some one else. That is not my concern.
What is the right method of propagating and delivering
eVedanta course. How to encourage the organisations
doing it.

The point is being raised here because, we are looking
for Credible people/teachers who are not out there to
cheat us. Parampara ensures that the method delivered
by them will probably take us where we want to go,
because in our eyes they have demonstrated it. It is
not a concoction of some neophyte. For example, I look
towards Divine Life Society becasuse it produced
realised souls for two generations. (if it can be
generated.) I feel probably, their methods work.

I am not rediculing the course per say, but I have
negative opinion on the method of delivery and a huge
price barrier for that. I have a concern that a rich
and world-wide organisation like Chinamaya Mission to
which probably a million people look to for right
guidance in the spiritual context has taken an
approach which is detrimental, in my view, for the
said objectives of the Mission and Sanatana Dharma
propagation at large. and a hindrance to the East-West
bridge, which is stated to be the purpose.

By the way, here the word 'East West Bridge" does it
mean Indians in the West and the Indians in the East
?? If not will this particuar method of eVedanta,
bridge that gap ?

If you felt that the method is questionable and
someone may ridicule it, I am glad. Let the message go
back to the organisers of the course. It is good that
an 'insider' like me is commenting, than an 'outsider'
with whom the organisation wants to bridge the gap
says it loud.

Let us teach Vedanta in e-way, which can not be
rediculed by any one.

It is not a mere argument. It is my right to voice my
opinion. I am not taking the course. I would have
loved to  read, as an enthusiast of any spiritual
activity. But, because of my dislike for this MINIMUM
$350 Donation, I do not like that idea.

I have not even debated whether it is worth the money.
Infact, I have specifically said that I am not worried
about the efficacy of the course. I myself know by
personal study and svadhyaya that all these techniques
are useless, atleast in the short term. Unless one is
dedicated to the pursuit by rigorous commitment, no
clarity will come. These are my conclusions, having
reached some stage of understanding, by the grace of
several teachers, at my differnt stages, I can look
back and see how the road was at my back.

I would have loved to see this course, open to all
with no fee. Then the CM would have truly done a
service to bring the family of seekers together.
Please see many positive ways of achieving integration
I have spoken aloud in my mails.

I am not contradicting myself. An Indian organisation
in our San Francisco bay area when organises such
program, including CM, do not ask for a MINIMUM
donation. They may appeal at the end by citing the
services they are providing. But, the American managed
organisations such as Gangaji Foundation for example,
so that you are not confused again, ask for 'suggested
donation' of $ 10 - $ 15. 

Double standards, not for me...

You seem to have a different India in mind than what I
know. In the past none asked me a minimum donation for
a 'harikatha'. Generally a kathakar who is not a
sanyasi solicits donations in the name of god, for his
family needs etc. For bigger celebrations, organisers
go out collecting funds from patrons and businesses.
They also ask donations from individuals during the
program. I know that the hooligans collect minimum
donation during Holy etc. and for Dasara. Tell me
about the India you know...

karma kanda portion suggests rites for merits to live
in heaven and better life on earth. It does not call
for certificates. Karma kanda suggests rites on the
basis of 'duty' also. All in the name of 'happiness,
peace, satisfaction', you can call it by any names.

That is what I am saying, you can not say that for
this purpose of gaining any merit, eVedanta course
will not  help. It is for Knowledge. Its methods of
teaching are well tested for centuries. So, you can
not  give me any reference. So, bringing karma kanda
discussion here is irrelevant.

I have  many books published by Chinamaya Mission
(most English, and many Telugu books). Some I bought
in USA and some I bought in India, because US prices
are unaffordable as I tend to  buy all the book and
attempt to read what I buy, some time.

What I am saying is that even those prices are
un-comaprable to the books published by RKM or Divine
Life Society. They are no less worthy, OK.

For the same paper back books in the US, we pay in
Dollars dearly, you know that. OK. It is upto them how
they price it. I am only countering your view that CM
publishes low-priced editions, in the spirit of
reaching masses. Before you argue with me compare
other large and small spiritual organisations. It will
tell a lot.

Probably there is nothing wrong, in your view. I am
not against it either. What all I am saying is that
the MINIMUM fee of $ 350 sends a wrong message to the
world. 

Let us take the example: say I can afford to donate
only $ 500 to the charity per annum, and I am already
a member of the mission and I am doing my bit for 'my
own satisfaction', or let us say, I donate to some
other society, Veterans organisation, now when you
have a message of hope to deliver in the name of
Vedanta, and prescribe a minimum fee of $ 350 for me
and $ 700 for me + my wife, you have already ignored
me. This is NO WAY TO TEACH VEDANTA. That is all I am
saying. We need better minds to manage/make a
successful delivery of the eVedanta course and
spiritual organisations in general.

This course has no pre-requisites. Could the mission
have asked the student to go to a Temple once a month
? or done 1 hour social work for a week/month ? Could
it have asked the aspirants to fast one day in a month
?Could it have asked the aspiring student to meditake
for 30 min per week, to be eligible for the course. I
am very optimistic that it will yield better results,
than to think of $ 350 as the first rule and nothing
else after that. As it stands now, it is another book
reading. OK, is that  all a great Mission like CM can
think ? You and some others approve(d) it. That is why
the course has taken this route.

I already asked other questions, why did not CM
integrate the entire community of CM patrons and send
a monthly e-mail newsletter from Swami T ? It would
have inspired the whole community much better, in my
limited opinion. Do you see some value to my
resistance ?

So, that all the people can be taught; not only those
who can pay $ 350. I am talking your language only.
But, you are not willing to change your
interpretation. Before you decide to spend money for
other programs, decide what you want to do to "bridge
the gap between East and West" which was the stated
objective of CIF and for which this course is supposed
to help.

I just typed above .. it is OK. But, before that build
other people interested in the same eVedanta course
but who are not ready to see the value for it or who
are not ready for it or who can not pay for it. How
about the so many youngsters who just joined college
and at the most critical time of their life, who being
dependent on parents or working in Burger King etc.
can not afford to pay $ 350. Why don't you serve them
first. Why do you deny the opportunity to them. The
right way of saying is , why do not you offer the
opportunity to them pro-actively and encourage them,
to build a stronger CM for the future. You and I will
live only a few more decades, they will form a
valuable link to future. Are we thinking about it ?
How easy it is to accomplish it with this right first
steps, instead of putting a $ 350 barrier !!

Screaming, Yes I have to do because, you forgot the
human values and call me a 'hypocrite' that too based
on your mis-understanding.  And you hope to avoid the
conversation without answering my objections.

Also, CAPS are being used to draw your attention.

I keep my mails some time, and already I have read a
couple of times. If you decide not to  continue
conversation and leave it,  that is fine. You will
reamin thinking that all are 'hypocrites', except you,
and it will do only so much good.

BTW, I am really not worried that you called me a
'hypocrite'. I am just having fun, how people can not
face 'truth' and label others and stick to their own
thoughts and how detrimental it is to the larger good
and mission of an organisation.

Have fun.

Om Namo Narayanaya !!
