I'm not sure how this relates to desire and freedom. If you are free from 
karma then how come you still have desire? By having a desire one is then 
looking to fulfil it. If you wish to fulfil it then you are looking at 
some future consequence for your desire. If this is correct then you are 
not free from karma at all.

Regards,
Tahir
