I understand that from the exterior point of view a realised being is 
indistinguishable from the ordinary human. I am not quite sure about the 
meaning of freedom and it's relationship with desire. Can one be free and 
have desires? If you follow a desire then aren't you in some way bound to 
it when you fulfil it?

Regards,
Tahir
