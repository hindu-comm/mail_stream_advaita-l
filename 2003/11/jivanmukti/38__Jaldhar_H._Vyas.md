Well the single distinguishing characteristic of a jivanamukta is they are
free.  So if they seem to be expressing non-free behaviour (like addiction
in your example) then they are probably not jivanamuktas.

One of the criticisms of Advaita Vedanta has been that by saying the
jivanmukta is free of any bounds then it could excuse immorality.  What is
to stop him engaging in violence and other transgressions?  The answer is
because mukti is a total change in outlook.  He would not hurt others
anymore than he would hurt himself because from his perspective they are
his own self.
