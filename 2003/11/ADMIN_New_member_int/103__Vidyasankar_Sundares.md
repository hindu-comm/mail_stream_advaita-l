>My exposure to Vedanta started with Swami Chinmayananda. I was a member of
>the Balavihar classes, and had the pleasure of meeting and listening to the
>renowned Swami at a young age. I have started into a semi-serious study of
>vedanta by reading translations of Shankara's Gita Bhasya and slowly
>searching through the large volume of advaita/advaitin/advaita-l archives.
>
>I currently reside in the Seattle, WA area.
