> Is there a way of knowing if someone is a realized being (jivanmukti)?

Just yesterday I read this from Sri Ramana Maharshi's teachings:

Q:  What are the marks of a real teacher (sadguru)?

A:  Steady abidance in the Self, looking at all with an equal eye,
unshakeable courage at all times, in all places and circumstances, etc.

Q:  What are the marks of an earnest disciple (sadshishya)?

A:  An intense longing for the removal of sorrow and attainment of joy, and
an intense aversion for all kinds of mundane pleasure.
