Namaskarams,

I hope you have been following the debate regarding
Vedic studies in places other than India.

This Veda patashala concept ties in very much with my
thinking on this subject.
I feel that extending this organization abroad will
strengthen the goals of having a unified mechanism of
learning.

Competing schools of thought are always welcome in our
philosophy, however the basis is the same.
Learning vedas/vedantas involve at the very least
1. Learning the chanting
2. Obtaining a word translation 

the society is divided on the interpretation aspect
there is no harm in this) for learning this the
student can go in search of a competent Guru.

The major issues I believe are
1. the debate regarding women/non dwijas and learning.
my ignorance and lack of learning on this matter
leaves me with no opinion on this issue, I have not
been able to find any reason to support this or any
argument to oppose this. (please do not debate this
issue based on my email. the purpose of this email is
not to open up this issue to a debate)

2. Distances: Students may not be able to travel to
the patasala, driving 40 miles in winter for a one
hour class can be taxing

I personally am not comfortable with an elearning
course, maybe it an provide an introduction but this
can be had from books too

regards
vishwanathan
