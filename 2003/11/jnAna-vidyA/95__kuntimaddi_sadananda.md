Ravi - your comments are interesting. Question whether aj~naana is just
the absence of knowledge or presence of ignorance- is a very subtle
issue. Is it 'bhaava ruupa' that veils the knowledge or abhaavaruupa 
there is just the lack of knowledge has been debated. According to
Advaita - knowledge is considered as eternal ever existent entity - it
cannot be said as absence of knowledge (that which is non-existent can
never come into existence), but then one is cornered in bringing 
aj~naana as positive quantity that covers the ever present knowledge.
That brings another problme - if aj~naana is an existent entity then it
can never cease to exist.  'aj~naana' is muddled with aj~naana! -
anirvachaniiyam may be the best escape! 

Hari OM!
