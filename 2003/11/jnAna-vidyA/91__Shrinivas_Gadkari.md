 Namaste,

 It is a common observation that the following 
 terms are generally interpreted to mean knowledge:
 1. jnAna, 2. vidyA, 3. vijnAna.

 As per my understanding:
 jnAna - fundamental basic knowledge.
 vijnAna - specific knowledge, derived from jnAna.

 vidyA - involves both jnAna and vijnAna and is 
 generally concerned with how to deal with different 
 aspects of prakRti. Number of vidyA-s is infinite. 
 However some vidyA-s are very comprehensive and 
 general. These are given the status of brahma
vidyA-s.

 avidyA - that which is opposite of vidyA.
 ajnAna - that which is opposite of jnAna.

 Best regards,
 Shrinivas
