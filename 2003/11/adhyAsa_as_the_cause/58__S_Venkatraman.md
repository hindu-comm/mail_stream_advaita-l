In my humble opinion, in the causal chain, Adhyasa should come in between Kama and Avidya.

Kama happens because of Adhyasa, taking the unreal as real. And Adhyasa happens because of Avidya.

AFAIK, adhyAsa is not the root cause of evil. 

The words "good" and "evil" are used in relation to action (Karma)
alone. In advaita, karma is a product of kAma (desire), which in turn
is a product of avidyA. (avidyA --> kAma --> karma)
