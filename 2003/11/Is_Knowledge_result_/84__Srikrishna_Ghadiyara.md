hariH OM !!

Refer to upadEsa sAhasrI - Chapter 4 (metrical part) -
sloka 4 :

Arabdhasya phalE hyEtE bhOgO j~Anam cha karmaNaH
avirOdhastatOyuktO vaidhrmyam cha itarasya tu

Translation as per Mayeda:

Page 112

4. As experience [of the result of action] and
knowledge are both resuls of action which has already
begun to produce a result, it is reasonable that they
(= knowledge and action) are not contradictory to each
other. But other [action, namely that which has not
yet begun to produce a result,] is different in
nature.

--------

Similar is the translation by Swami Jagadananda.

Q: How is it said that 'experience and knowledge are
both results of action ..' ?

Om Namo Narayanaya !!

Srikrishna
