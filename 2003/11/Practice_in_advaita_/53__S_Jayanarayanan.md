Neither creation nor the product of creation has an "innate" error.

There are two important creation theories in advaita --
"shR^ishhTi-dR^ishhTi vAda" or "creation before perception", which
speaks of creation as an act of the Lord, and "dR^ishhTi-shR^ishhTi
vAda" or "perception before creation", according to which creation is
likened to a dream of the Self. 

Ramana Maharshi was speaking from the standpoint of the latter theory,
according to which the "perception of creation" is itself the product
of error. When he said, "Creation simply is. There is no error in
creation, the error is in us", he meant, "Leave creation alone, for you
will not find error in it. Find the Self and root out the ultimate
error."

I don't understand this question.

Shankara speaks of two paths:

1) Karma mArga or the Path of Action:
   Moral agent --> Moral action --> Moral development 

A Moral agent is one who can act and can distinguish right from wrong.
Moral action refers to the dutiful practice of right action (dharma),
according to principles of shruti, smR^iti and shishhTAchAra. Moral
development is the development of qualities such as self-restraint,
calmness, forbearance, etc. 

2) GYAna mArga or the Path of Wisdom:
   Moral Development --> Study of Vedanta --> GYAna

Therefore, only one who has attained Moral development is eligible to
study Vedanta. Such a person has already undergone a firm grounding in
dharma in the past, so there is no "danger" of him slipping into evil
action.

See above. A mentally retarded person or an infant or an animal does
not have the ability to distinguish right from wrong, and so is not
culpable for his/her actions. They cannot attain moral development and
so are quite far away from enlightenment.

Ramana Maharshi has emphatically said, "Everyone needs a Guru and I was
no exception. My Guru was Arunachala."
