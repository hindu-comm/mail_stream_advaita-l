Then how would you explain vidhva in the definition I quoted from
Medinikosha?  Vidhva is definitely widow in Gujarati and I'm pretty sure
it is the same in Sanskrit.

Also Tantric references to Shiva as 'dead' and Shakti as a 'widow' need
not be taken literally.  Rather they are symbolic of the active Prakrti
versus the inert Purush.  And does not Shiva Bhagawan proudly bear the
names Smashanavasi and Bhutapati?
