Namaste,

Jaldhar was simply quoting some other work and I was struck by the
term "red color" since something similar occurs in the durgA sUkta. As
regards respect for devI, I think everyone participating in this thread
has nothing but deep respect for HER (a look at the archives can confirm
this).

Would not like to go into an indepth discussion on dhumavatI here (and
also my knowledge about dhumavatI is limited). Just would like to mention
a point here, and I think this point is important. When we talk about
shiva tattva and shakti tattva, we are talking about tattva-s and not
necessarily about the greatest RShi-s of these tattva-s namely, bhagavAn
rudra and devI pArvati.

Thanks for this information.

Best regards
