 One should weigh options while choosing the translation or synonym.
 For example, one of the meanings of "shivA" is a jackal. We should not
 interpret this as characterizing shiva's spouse, PArvatI. Again, "Hari"
 can also mean "monkey", but whether we choose this meaning depends on
 the context. In another context, "Hari" can be a lion. In yet another,
 bhagavAn shrI Hari Himself.

 BhAskararAya has defined kAtyAyanI, quoting the vAmana purANa,
 as Ravi said : "tachchApi tejo  varamuttamaM mahAnAmnA
 pR^ithivyAmabhavat.h prasiddham.h|
 kAtyayanItyeva tadA babhau sA nAmnA cha tenaiva jagatprasiddhA ||

 BhAskararAya further quotes the kAlikA purANa which holds that kAtyAyanI
 is the abhimAni devatA of ODyANapITha.

 And the devI purANa says that "kaM" means brahma, the head, and
 sapphire. Since the devI is the basis of these (bears these) or
 resides in them, She is called "kAtyAyanI."

 I have no knowledge of tantric interpretations. I have heard that
 many unorthodox tantric concepts/practices should only be taken
 as metaphors, not literally. In fact, I have heard that it could
 be dangerous to take them literally.
