Stephen Huyler in his book, says that our kings of yore, immortalised
themselves through temples. They had a deeply ingrained thought that empires
rise and fall, but the religious nature of man will never fall. Satyam Eva
Jayate!

In europe and elsewhere you do not attach importance to the kings through
much of their contributions. The civilizations of the Greeks, Egyptians are
long gone. I am glad to see that there is now significant rise in those
ancient religions among the educated class in Europe.

Britannia is long gone. We have been a continuous civilization right from
the time the first hominoid walk on the Shivaliks. And no, there was no
outside invasion!
