Others have already addressed the issue of whether one can just declare
oneself a jnani.  Let me address some of the philosophical points.

I thought I was writing this email.  Do you mean to say that actually you
are writing it?

Obviously at some level there is seperate, individual doers.  Perhaps what
is meant is that you and I and everything else is in essence Brahman.  But
from that perspective how can you say anything is being "done" at all?

Who is this God?  If He is some seperate entity then what assurance do you
have that He is going to take care of it?  If He is ultimately your own
Self than "you" do have to do the work of realization.

No apart from the reasons given above, jnana is knowledge.  Certainly
effacement of the ego is an important contributor to jnana but it is not
jnana itself.

We can't.

It is one thing to talk about the futility of doership and another to
actually not do.  In my opinion these new age types are more interested in
evading reponsibility than actual renunciation.

Then why is there creation or destruction at all?

Yes and it also makes no sense.  If these random karmas are evenly
distributed, why do we see differences in creation of different organisms?
If they are uneven, then on what principle?

Judging by this and other information you have provided, it is just a
hodge-podge of half-baked and half-understood ideas designed to give a
mystique of "oriental mysticism" to the gullible and uninformed.  It is
the spiritual equivalent of junk food.
