Yes, but this would be consistent only if Ramesh Balsekar and his followers
define Totality to be God. In which case, there is a problem with the notion
of rebirth in that teaching. If there is no individual karma, and everything
gets mixed up and redistributed, there is no point in talking of good and
evil in this world. And this kind of God cannot be said to be impartial in
handing out the fruits of karmas. These make it problematic to think of such
teachings as equivalent to Advaita Vedanta, as in the traditional teaching,
there is a vyAvahArika difference between God and an individual jIva. The
totality is not attained unless even this difference is transcended, and
only then, there is no further karma.
