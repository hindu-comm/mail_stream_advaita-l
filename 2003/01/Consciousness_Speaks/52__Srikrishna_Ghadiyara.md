Would yo please elaborate this statement. It might
help me understand this concept better.

This statement is interesting. As per your
explanation, the concept of Karma in Brahman is
meaningless. Ofcourse, I have similar understanding
that Brahman/Atma is 'akarta' and mere witness, as
illustrated in the Upanishads.

But, in Sri Ramesh's teaching, "all karma is
non-individualistic", meaning the cosmic-doer is doing
the karma. This is at odds with the Upanishadic stand.

Om Namo Narayanaya !!
