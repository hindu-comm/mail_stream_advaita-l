Good and bad apply only when we stay within the sphere
of Karma. So long as we are under delusion we cannot
and should not do away with these concepts. Though the
fact is that good and bad apply only to the phenomenal
world it is wise to remain silent on the issue rather
than trying to explain it to one and all.
