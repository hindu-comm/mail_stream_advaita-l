As I mentioned earlier, I would appreciate a more
detailed explanation of these statements.

In one view, I do not agree with what you wrote here.
Even a J~nani is performing actions. It is only that
there is no doer for the j~nani himself. Yes, we do
see a body+mind doing the actions. But, as I
understand that body and mind is an instrument of God,
and there is no individual doer.

Your explanation that "> One truly
> transcends vyavahAra only
> when one recognizes that there is no karma
> whatsoever in the brahman state."  is different from
a jivan mukta's state of 'acting' in this world.

Would you please expound more on this 'karma in
Brahman' aspect.

Om Namo Narayanaya !!

Srikrishna
