Dear Sri Vidyasankar,

Don't our scriptures too have the same message:

> clearly in all of Shankara's bhashyas. However, what is meant
> by "in and due
> to" Consciousness? The question then is, does this one and only
> Consciousness have parts?

IN:

mayyeva chidvyomni jagath gandharava pattanam

- Advaita Makaranda, Verse 3.

(mayi and vyomni - adhikaraNa saptami)

DUE TO:

tasya bhaasa sarvam idam vibhaati

Regards,
SVS
