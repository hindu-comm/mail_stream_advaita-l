Namaste,

At the risk of sounding foolish, I would like to
mention the following:

maharShi vyAsa is supposed to be living even today. The texts
that we use today are probably the latest edition that has
approval of maharShi vyAsa. May be these texts were somewhat
different in their earlier editions (especially itihAsa/ purANa
portions). But as long as the current version has approval of
the maharShi, we may as well treat the current texts as good
as original.

(What about the contradictions in the texts? May be these are not
very important as far the the real message intended to be conveyed
by the texts.)

Best regards
Shrinivas Gadkari
