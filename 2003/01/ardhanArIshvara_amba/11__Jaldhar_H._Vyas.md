The puranas point out that the present srishti is the second one.  The
first was manasika (mental) and gave birth to Rshis like Narada,
Sanatkumars etc.  But they went off to do tapa and did not have progeny.
Then Brahmaji did the second srshti by maithuna (the union of male and
female.) This did result in progeny.  Brahmajis ahamkara was in assuming
the creation due to duality was a "success" while that based on
non-duality was a failure.  Through the Ardhanarishwara rupa, Shiva
Bhagavan showed Him that even the duality of male and female has only
non-duality as its basis.
