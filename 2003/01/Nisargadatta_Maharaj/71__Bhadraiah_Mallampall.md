>Theory & practice is another dualism.

Tai.Up. says 'swaadhyaaya pravachanecha' studying and practicing.

I am not sure about practice of advaita, or if advaita can ever be
meaningfully practiced, but whatever list of items were mentioned by Tai.Up
can safely be practiced without any restriction as per authority given. For
instance 'praja' can be practiced after garbhaadhaanam ceremony. Rtam and
satyam etc can always be practiced.

Best regards
Bhadraiah
