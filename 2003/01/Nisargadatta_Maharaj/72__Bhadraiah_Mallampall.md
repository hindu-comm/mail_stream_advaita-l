The function of Prana named samaana automatically balances our actions and
draws back the objects created, usually soon after they are born unless we
get interested in those objects and want to retain their existence. So
advaita always happens. All we have to do is to gear up the mecahnisms of
samaana. Just my 2 paisa.

Best regards
Bhadraiah
