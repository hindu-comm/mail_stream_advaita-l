It is good that you brought out this point. Even in
the other posts titled 'Texts', I was pointing to this
same thing by objecting to the interpretaion of
'practice'. Sruthi, as a valid means of knowlege is
sufficient to produce Knowledge. Upadesa Sahasri has
enough discussion on this topic and refutes
karma-sumachaya vada. I am personally excited to
understand Veda being a 'means of knowlege' just for
this purpose. In light of this understanding of what
constitutes a 'pramana', sravana, manana, nididhyasana
is part of that teaching of sruthi by a teacher. There
is no relevence of any other practice.

Om Namo Narayanaya !!

Srikrishna
