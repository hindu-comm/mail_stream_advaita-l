I am glad you quoted this. I have often wondered if
there are any scriptural injunctions about naama
sankIrtana and naama japa. In bhagavad gIta also, I
recollect bhagavaan saying "yagyAnAm japayagyosmi..."
in chapter 10, but don't recollect anything more on
this form of upAsana.

Are there any more?
