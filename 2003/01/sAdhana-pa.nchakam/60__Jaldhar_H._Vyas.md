Thankyou for sharing these important instructions from our Acharya.  Due
to the ill-fit between English and Sanskrit some misunderstandings are

Although Veda does come from a root meaning wisdom, it is the actual Vedas
which are meant here or at the most the Vedas plus the works based on them
such as Puranas, and Gita not generic "words of wisdom"

Sat does mean true but "pure people" would be better in my opinion.

The words _and_ their meaning.

Again it is the Vedas not generic words of wisdom which are meant.

search for the logic based on the words of the Vedas.

I don't envy the task of any translator but this goes to show you how
important it is to know Sanskrit so you can read the original for itself
and avoid unnecessary confusion.
