Vidyasankar

(Translation - Yes, but the mind becoming 'no-mind' is very difficult to
accomplish. Prior to this, it is essential to learn to control the mind and
the senses. dhyAna and textual learning serve as means to this end. The
brahmasUtra says, 'SAstra yonitvAt' i.e., as it (knowledge of Brahman) is
born through the SAstras. Even Gaudapada taught the meditation on OM, didn't
he?)
