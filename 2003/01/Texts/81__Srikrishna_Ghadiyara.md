This concept is against Advaita Vedanta tenets. There
are no separate parts called Theory and practice. This
is 'Knowledge' which comes by understanding, which
comes out of Sravana, Manana, Nididhyasana. To that
extent, 'Sravanam; paunah punyam Sravanam' is the Only
thing to do; There is no separate practice.

Om Namo Narayanaya !!

Srikrishna
