I agree. Besides one can learn a lot from works such as, trishati bhaashya
and sahasranAma bhAshya of AchArya.

There is a commentary on vivekachuuDamani by shri shri chandrasekhara
bhArati svaamigaL of shringeri maTha.

IMO, we need only minimum and basic theory to sustain and propel the
practice.

Also the difference between new age books and traditional text books on
advaita-vedAnta is the similar to the difference between the popular
science books on modern physics and actual modern physics text books.
Former merely give a glimpse of the subject and sometimes exaggerate and
make it look as it is it all rosy rosy. But the latter toil to make actual
physicists. Yes, it will require a lot of effort to go through the tedious
calculations, but it is required.

My 2c.
