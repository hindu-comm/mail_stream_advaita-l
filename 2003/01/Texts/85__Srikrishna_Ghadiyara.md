Hari Om !!

First of all, my previous post was in reply to Sri
Vaidya Sundaram's comments.

If your assumptions are correct Lord Krishna should
not have taught the Vedanta to Arjuna, and more so in
the thick of a battle. He should have restricted
himself to provoke him to fight, alone. The mere fact
that this knowlege is not restricted to Sanyasin's is
clearly demonstrated here. Do you see any 'practice'
done by Arjuna on the battle field ?

You agree that 's-m-n' is the practice, at most, if it
is acceptable to call it a 'practice'.

Do you think, I have a lot of free time to keep
raising 'objections' specially because it is from
'you' ??? you have clearly 'losely' stated several
times, your own interpretaions and want everyone to
buy that ignorance ???? or atleast read your mind and
not what you post. Unfortunately, I do not have that
'art'.

I do not need your certification. Neither do I need
your suggestion as to what I should consider as
correct.

If you were not open minded to debate, and would not
like others to point out your philosophical fallacies,
you need not post them here on this open forum.

Om Namo Narayanaya !!

Srikrishna
