On devotion :

31. Among all means to liberation devotion is supreme. To seek to know ones
real nature  this is said to be devotion.

32. In other words, devotion can be defined as the search for the reality of
ones own Atman. The seeker after reality of the atman, who possesses the
necessary qualifications, should approach an illumined teacher from whom he
can learn the way to liberation.
