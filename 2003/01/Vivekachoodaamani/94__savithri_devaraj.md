I am surprised to know that shrI shrI bhArati tIrtha
Swamiji has written another commentary.

I have the english translation of the commentary in
sanskrit by Jagadguru shri shrI chandrashekara bhArati
Swamiji - shrI bhArati tIrtha swamiji's parama guru
(guru's guru). The shlokas are both in sanskrit and
english. This is 1988 bhAratIya vidya bhavan
publication.

Savithri
