I agree with shriimati Savithriji. Giving the sanskrit verse (or just the
number) will be very useful. On the other hand not giving is also fine, as
it will make one put some extra effort.

Complete text is available in Sanskrit site and there are few translations
available online, including the one cited below. Cutting and pasting should
not be difficult though.

For a good overview of the entire text, please refer to the English
translation of shrI shrI bhaarati tiirtha's commentary Author nicely
summarizes the text, giving what verses cover what. At home I use this book
along with a nice Tamil translation of aNNaa subrahmaNya aiyar of  RKM.


For all the verses below, Vaidya has summarized the commentary on the list.
Please search the archives. I have tried to identify the verses below, I
may be wrong -- your corrections are welcome.
