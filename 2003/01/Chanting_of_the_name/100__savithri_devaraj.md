I think japa-yoga is different from dhyAna. I have not
read much about japa-yoga in Bhagavad Geetha and
elsewhere. This is what made me glad when I saw
references from Ch.Up.

In japa yoga, one constantly repeats a given mantra if
initiated, else a chosen name or mantra of one's
liking. It is not necessary to imagine the form of the
diety, just chanting and paying attention to the
chanting is important. The mantra cleanses the mind
and body of the aspirant as it were. A mantra coming
from a guru is very potent.

I have heard that when you foresee unworthy thoughts
coming, or like to get out of the grasp of unholy
thoughts, it is good to chant the mantra quite fast so
that the mind loses its grip on the unwholesome
thoughts and can easily concentrate on the mantra.

dhyAna yoga seems to be somewhat more advanced form of
upAsana. In dhyAna, the object of meditation - the
form of a diety or object captures the attention of
the meditator to the exclusion of all thoughts.
Initially there is effort, and the attention span is
quite broken, but as the aspirant progresses, it seems
that the object of dhyAna is holding his/her attention
continuosly like the flow of oil. It is possible to
attain sAkshAtkAra (or realization) of the diety by
this method, so it seems.

I am sure Sri SadAnanda and others on this list can
answer this better.

My 2 cents,
Savithri

Dear Bhadraiahji,

Japam is to be practised by all irrespective of which
religious ideas you subscribe to. It may not appeal to
the intellect but then God cannot be realised by the
intellect. Japam is the best method of cleansing the
subconscious. Our shastras say that the name and the
named are one. There may be an intellectual interest
in studying the name but then when I think of the name
"Bhadraiah" I remember you irrespective of what the
name "Bhadraiah" means.

Japam is like the rope that leads to God. You catch
hold of it and steadily progress towards the
objective.

Regards
Jagannath
