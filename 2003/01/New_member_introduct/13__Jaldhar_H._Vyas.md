Dear Sri Venkatesh,

While I am delighted that you have taken interest in this body of knowledge,
I would like to point out that there are enough resources in the USA -
various Ashrams, libraries, book shops, (some) teachers, Sanskrit learning
centers and mailing lists that help you learn.  Stay with this list for some
time and you will discover for yourself what I say.  You can post a request
to the list members asking for resources near your area of residence.  If
there are any who know about it, they may help you out with this.

And above all, pray for God's help and everything will fall in place.

Regards,
SVS

In addition to kADu, kaDaM also means forest.
vEM means bamboo. So the name perhaps indicates that
there were bamboo forests on the seven hills and  it got its
name due to that. In sandhi vEmkaDaM becomes vEMgaDaM.

I would like to point out that telugu along with kannada and
malayalam is a dravidian language and old tamil is a common
property of all the four people. Claims such as tirupathi
is ancient tamil land and it is in Andhra Pradesh are to say the
least simplistic. Telugus, Kannadigas and Malayalees are as much
inheritors of the Dravidianl cultureand land as the tamilians are.

Sarma.
