My name is Venkatesh Mahadevan. I have been interested in getting to know
more about Vedanta, Upanishads and Hinduism as whole.

Recently i have been having this sudden urge to know/learn more. Also I
have limited resources as i live in the US. This is one of them through
which i can get to learn more.

I don't have anything to contribute as of now. But I have a lot to learn.


Thanks

Venkat
