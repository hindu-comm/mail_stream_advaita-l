Our shastras speak highly of the value of satsang.  I encourage all the
list members to get together with like-minded sadhakas on a regular basis.
The Internet is good for some things but cannot provide the kind of
discipline Advaitic sadhana requires.  Such sadhana is hard to do on ones
own and when enthusiasm inevitably wavers, the support of good friends can
help you bounce back.

Even "scholars" should not rely on themselves alone.  While I answer a lot
of questions here, my knowledge has improved tremendously from the input
of others on this list.
