Yes. Samadhi is a state of peace when all the gunas are in equilibrium so
it is certainly useful.  Just as learning some subject is easier in a
quiet classroom rather than in the middle of a busy street.  However
unlike in Samkhya/Yoga, samadhi isn't an end in itself.  Only jnana is the
cause of moksha.
