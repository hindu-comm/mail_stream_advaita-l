Namaste,

I have some questions on sAmkhya, yoga and Kapila muni.

1. According to the mahAbhArata, Kapila muni, the founder of sAmkhya, is an incarnation of viSNu. But sAmkhya is atheistic. How can there be an incarnation who does not believe in himself?

2.sAmkhya and yoga have Kapila as their founder, according to the mahAbhArata. How then, can the former be atheistic while the latter is not? Or, is there an atheistic thought in yoga also?
