svAdhyAya involves recollection of what has already been learnt. What is
intended is that no new adhyayana is to be done after saMnyAsa.

On the other hand, if one takes Apastamba very literally, then there arises
a contradiction between first allowing svAdhyAya and then saying that the
veda should be renounced. It would not arise if we restrict veda to mean the
karma kANDa.

Indeed, there is no way to properly know "I am brahman" without the location
of the I-thought. Inasmuch as the process of locating it involves words, 
statements
will naturally arise. In that sense, manana and nididhyAsana on upanishad 
statements
are exactly the same as the location of the I-thought. It is not as if one 
merely keeps
chanting "I am brahman" repeatedly. Surely, the final realization transcends 
words, but
the traditional advaitic view of the upanishad statements such as "The Self 
is brahman"
is that they embody the path of Self-enquiry, as realized by rishis such as 
vAmadeva etc.
