Namaste Illustirous Moderators,

My wife and I are off to a remote part of Donegal tomorrow, for three weeks, and will be unable to get near a computer for most of the time.

I have set up a permanent, new e-mail address purely for the advaita mail but cannot find out how to change it to receive this site's postings.  Can you do it at your end please or advise me what to do?

The new address is anirvacaniya at yahoo.com

Many thanks,

Ken Knight
