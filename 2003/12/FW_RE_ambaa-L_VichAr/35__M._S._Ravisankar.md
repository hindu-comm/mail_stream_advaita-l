I did an cursory search on WorldCat (Catalog of many catalogs across the
world). I did not see any telugu or English translation of vrtti prabhakara.
But if my  keywords were wrong, for instance, it was vrutti (as typically
written in languages like telugu) I might have missed it. Especially, the
names get quite distorted when they standardize tamil words (as you can see
below - vichara saagaram becomes vicara cakaram).

But I found Tamil translations of both vichara saagara and vrttiprabhakara.
If anyone has university privileges they can get them delivered either as
Edocs or via ILL. BOth books are quite old and are available in microfilm in
Chicago. I am attaching both the records. I have a feeling the the tamil
translation of vichara sagara published in 1923 may the book referred by
bhagavaan Sri ramaNa maharishi (which Karthik referred).

hariH Om !!

The Hindi books of Vichar Sagara and Vritti Prabhakara
are available at the following link:

http://www.khe-shri.com

I read some time ago in the writings of Swami
Tapovanam that he used to give discouses on Vritti
Prabhakara. I searched for the translation in English
or Telugu, but did not succeed. If any of you come
across a English or Telugu translation, please let me
know.

Om Namo Narayanaya !!
