Kartik,

I agree with Shree SSS  last statement that any resolution of conflict
should be on the basis if the verdic of Vedas and reason. 

On the later basis I question the statements that relate to naama-ruupa
to ignorance.  Due to ignorance one can have naama-ruupa but naama-ruupa
does not necessarily implies ignorance.  The issue being a jiivanmukta
can see the plurality involving naama ruupa -which essentially viewed as
aiswaryam -the ignorance is only then taking the plurality as reality -
that is delusion of moha. If one looks from the perspective of realizes
soul - and look at the comentary on just on its own basis will be
misleading. As I see it, Padmapaada's conmentary makes the problem
worse. 

I thought basic objection of Shree SSS interms of shankara's vs post
shankara advaitins' commentaries is regarding the issue of the nature of
ignorance - Shree SSS claim is that post shankara adviatins have
interpreted it as bhaava ruupa, which became the target for subsequent
criticism by other schools, while Shankara did not consider it to be so.
Any thoughts on that? 

Hari OM!
Sadananda
