Karthik - I donot think that is true.  Is Shankara realized soul or not.
  Does he communicate with words and thoughts or not. Mind is nothing
but thought flow. For JN what is lost is the notinal mind with all
misconceptions.  The objective mind and the body and intellect stays as
equipments.  Otherwise we will not have any adviatic teacher left -
remember sotriyam brahma nishhTam!
