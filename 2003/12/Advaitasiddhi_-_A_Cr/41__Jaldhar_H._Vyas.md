Don't bother, it is fairly useless.  The author doesn't go into much
detail about the specific contents of the advaitasiddi and most incredibly
for a "critical study" does not describe the challenging arguments of the
Dvaitin Vyasatirth which prompted the writing of Advaitasiddhi in the
first place.

Unfortunately, a good study or translation of the advaitasiddhi in English
doesn't seem to have been written yet.  You might like to search the
archives of this list for some articles by Anand Hudli on this subject.
