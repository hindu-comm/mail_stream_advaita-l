I do not think, the Vedas give any 'reason' to
'substantiate' their claim/declaration that there is a
'Soul/Self'. They simply declare the 'TRUTH'. It is
later effort to substantiate by reason and logic.

The whole concept revolves around conscious and
non-conscious entities. All matter including
'thoughts' are non-conscious. If you can read some
introductory analysis about pancha-kosa prakriya, you
will become clear why a conscious-self is the
substratum of what you think you are. 

Having established that the 'experiences' are due to
the upadhi (body, mind etc.) differences, it is easy
to understand that that consciousness can be 'ONE', to
give the appearance of life as we know it i.e
multiplicity of subject and objects.

By such an analysis and understanding you can conclude
that there is no 'separate' independent 'jeeva',
independent of that ONE SELF. jIvatvam is mithya i,e
one that appears to be real but infact is not real in
final analysis. Body and mind have to continue their
experiences. Don't confuse with it.

Yes, Life itself is a process 'LAW'. But, whose law ?
Is it yours ? not mine, certainly. So, there is
certain order in the way things work in the universe,
whether a plucked fruit will ripen or not? at what
temperature and other conditions ? Answers to these
questions itself is 'Intelligence'. Scientists will
strive to uncover these 'facts' which reflect the
existance of this background 'intelligence'.

The bigger question is not,  if Life is a process ?
The concern is if this is a 'personal' process as we
know it now. Bring the question of 'subject' into your
question. 

While answering the above question, we just hilighted
only the 'intelligence' aspect of that ONE SOEL/SELF.
To that Impersonal Being, by  attaching the
individual/personal minds,  we made jivas; rather that
ONE became many jIvas. 

To conclude, Yes, Life itself is a process, ONE WHOLE,
UNIFIED process, spreading through all the worlds as
an interlinked process, as the Chandogya Upanishad
says.

Since we see some creation which reflects
'intelligence' we conclude that there ought to be an
intelligent 'Being' with that intelligence which is
LIFE itself. This word LIFE should be seen not as a
personal story, but chaitanyam.

Om Namo Narayanaya !!
