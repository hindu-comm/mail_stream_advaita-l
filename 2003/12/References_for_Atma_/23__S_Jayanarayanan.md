Thanks for pointing out that the term "Vedaan" can refer specifically
to the Karma KANDa, but there is the additional exhortation of the
renunciation of Truth and Untruth, which has to necessarily include all
statements. Also, Apastamba actually permits the study of the Veda to a
parivrAjaka-saMnyAsin, for three verses before (2.9.21.10), he says
that svAdhyAya -- self-study (obviously of the Veda) -- shall be done
by the saMnyAsin.

Verse 14, says: "He (the saMnyAsin) obtains salvation if he knows the
Atman." It feels like the AtmAnamanvichchhet of the previous verse is
the "final Self-enquiry" that leads directly to knowledge of the Self.

According to Ramana Maharshi, the one and only way to Atma GYAna is
through Atma VichAra. Although he sometimes says that the upanishadic
statements are the way, he always says that one must do Atma-vichAra
after studying the upanishads. Here is a quote, just for example: "'Who
am I?' is a different technique from the meditation - 'I am Siva' or 'I
am He'. I rather emphasize Self-Knowledge, for you are first conscerned
with yourself before you proceed to know the world or its Lord. The 'I
am He' or 'I am Brahman' meditation is more or less mental, but the
quest for the Self of which I speak is a direct method and is superior
to it." (Talks)

If I'm not mistaken, shravaNa, manana and nididhyAsana are all
concerned with the upanishadic statements alone. Self-enquiry that RM
teaches is not concerned with statements at all, but is "location of
the I-thought", which according to him, is THE WAY. "Everyone has gone
this way only".
