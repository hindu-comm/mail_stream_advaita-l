Dear Vidyasankar,

Thanks for your patient explanations.  It seems that you were kind to touch very important point, only too often overlooked by Western thinkers, namely, that the knowledge "about" something is radically different from experiential realisation of it. 

Those who engage in endless "intellectual" debates seem to overlook that jnAna constitutes necessary condition for having experiential quality knowledge of anything.  

>From this point of view, for them, moksha is bound to remain only a subject of intellectual games and endless speculations till it is revealed in the light of jnAna.  

Liberaton is not a matter of intellectual debate but a element of the state of realization brought by jnAna. 

The other question is: How free is the person you adress in your posts to accept the sastras you were kind to point him to?   As far as I am aware, Advaita tradition is not welcome in the ISKCON centers at all.

Regards

There are thousands of Sastric statements to the effect that jnAna is 
absolutely necessary for moksha.

Looking down upon liberation clearly marks most of the teachings of the Hare 
Krishna movement as being quite non-traditional and of very modern origin. 
By looking down upon moksha, you are looking down on what has been promised 
by Krishna himself in the Gita (ahaM ... mokshayishyAmi) In any case, it is 
beyond dispute that what we mean by moksha is markedly different from yours. 
So, why argue beyond a point?

Vidyasankar
