There are thousands of Sastric statements to the effect that jnAna is 
absolutely necessary for moksha.

Looking down upon liberation clearly marks most of the teachings of the Hare 
Krishna movement as being quite non-traditional and of very modern origin. 
By looking down upon moksha, you are looking down on what has been promised 
by Krishna himself in the Gita (ahaM ... mokshayishyAmi) In any case, it is 
beyond dispute that what we mean by moksha is markedly different from yours. 
So, why argue beyond a point?
