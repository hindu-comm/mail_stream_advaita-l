Actually it doesn't sound like the Advaitic path.  But it does sound a lot
like the Samkhya path.  I don't know how well Yin and Yang correspond to
Purush-Prakrti but I find it interesting that the dualism is also
expressed in male-female terms.  Though as this is one one of the most
fundamental human relationships perhaps it is not so surprising.

Anyway the same criticism applies.  Ok your mud has sunk to the bottom and
the water is pure.  What is to prevent it from getting all mudied up
again?
