The question is how?  there has to be sunshine or absorbent paper towels
or something.  the water doesn't dry itself.

With Samkhya/Yoga or Taoism there are two primordial entities and the goal
is seperation not transcendence. Advaita Vedanta says that you may be able
to reach a temporary balance but such a position is inherently unstable.
