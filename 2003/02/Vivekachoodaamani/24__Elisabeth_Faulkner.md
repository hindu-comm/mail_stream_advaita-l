*What if you don't have the tools for drying?  Then what good is the
*theoretical knowledge of e.g. paeper towels going to do you?

Towels aren't the only mechanism, just one. That's why I was asking does
it matter how the water is removed. Air and wind and sun would work...

*This is a good example.  Were one actually doing this one would have to

It's a
*far cry from saying let the mud and water seperate themselves.

*When I want a drink of water I'd rather not have any mud in it thankyou
*very much.  If I was gardening aquatic plants, maybe I would want mud.
*Different situations may or may not demand different outlooks.  Point
is
*again you cannot just say "let it be" and leave it at that.  The Taoist
*(as I understand) can because his goal is not transcend the universe
but
*simply to be unaffected by it.  And so with similiar Hindu
philosophies.
*The Advaita Vedantic criticque is that this useless because it actually
*leaves you totally at the mercy of external forces.

You can wait for the mud to settle in  your glass, and then resore the
mud to where it would be "useful".
Neither example seems to be "let it be" but rather utilizing what
forces - not being at their mercy_ in order to stay on path.

which is what I think you are saying when you wrote about path and goal
and determining them.
