Dear moderators,

I am a member of most of the Sri Vaishnavism lists. I'd like
to get a better understanding of the Vedanta, which is why
I am requesting membership.

I have been working on getting various Hinduism books online and
this list was brought to my attention because we are currently
proofring Thibaut's translation of Sankara's commentary on
the Vedanta-Sutras at http://texts01.archive.org/dp

Thanks
Srinivasan Sriram
