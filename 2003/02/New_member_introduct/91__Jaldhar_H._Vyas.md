I am an engineer working in the US. I am inclined towards spirituality in
general, right from my childhood. In the US, given the nature of my job , I
find it easier to read spiritual material from the web rather than from
books/libraries. To keep my thoughts engaged on the right things, I wanted to
join this list...As the great guru himself said...

        satsangatve nissngatvam
        nissangatve nirmohatvam
        nirmohatve nishchalatattvam
        nishcalatattve jiivanmuktih

||Om Gurubhyo Namah||

kind regards,
gokul
