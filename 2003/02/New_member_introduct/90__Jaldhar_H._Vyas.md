Respected Shri Vyas Ji,

Sadar Namaskar,

My name is Vinod Kumar Sharma, 49 years of age, married and father of a son
and a daughter.

Presently working in Sunflag Iron & Steel Company as Vice President (HRM)
and am based at Bhandara (MS).

Interest in Advaita has grown from our association with our Director Shri DB
Moharil and his wife.  Recently on their advise, we have started reading and
understanding Srimadbhagwat Geeta and Das Bodh by Shri Samarath Ram Das
Swami.  We are definitely not in a position to contribute any article
because we are still learning A, B , C of advaita-vedAnta.  However,
enrollment with your association is going to help us understand the subtle
interpretations.

Hope you will consider and allow our enrollment.

Regards

vks
