I am Min Yee, an American of mixed heritage (Chinese, Irish, Comanche
Indian). As far as Advaita Vedanta is concerned, I am culturally deprived in
comparison to most of this groups' rich philosophical and religious
heritage. I came upon this path by the introduction of a friend. I will
probably be very quiet in terms of writing but I am eager to learn. I look
forward to being a part of this group.

Sincerely yours,

Min Yee
