To Ravi Chandrasekhara: "A Brahmin who has drunk
liquor shall drink boiling hot liquor till he dies"
according to the Apastamba/Gautama/Bodhayana dharma
sutra. If that's followed/enforced to the letter, the
"Brahmin" population would decrease by quite a bit ;-)
Therefore statements such as you've quoted (those that
could be interpreted as denigrating non-dvijas) do
exist in the dharma shAstras. But the moral standards
demanded of the dvijas are very high also.

To Vaidya: Both the Bhagavatam and the Vishnu Puranam
have very graphic descriptions of the various kinds of
hell that one enters as a result of one's sins. But
the Vishnu Puranam ends by saying, "Heaven (svarga)
and hell (naraka) are only states of the mind." And
the Bhagavatam's recommendation for escaping all the
various kinds of hell is to simply chant the names of
the Lord.

It is interesting that Ramana Maharshi *demanded* all
of his close disciples, including so-called
non-dvijas, to listen to the daily Vedic recitation at
Ramanasramam. In case someone missed it and later gave
an excuse that he had to attend to some work, RM would
ask him, "What work can be so important?"

I have heard that RM chided one of his disciples
(Devaraja Mudaliar) by asking him not to chant the
Vedas along with the Brahmins, but I do not if it is
true.

To a certain devotee who was raising objections to the
caste system, RM said, "Kavyakantha Ganapathi Muni
once wanted to convert outcastes to Brahmins by means
of mantras, but no one came forward. It is obviously
due to an inferiority complex, so first work to remove
that complex." (Talks, # 507)
