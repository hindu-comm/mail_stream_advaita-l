Ravi - I donot see any contradiction. First, without recognition of
Krishan and his music, there is no raasaliila.  Once that is recognized
the dance goes on continously.  Here the oil example has two
implications. One is not continuity of the thought patterns towarads the
Lord - that is the raasaliila instead of disco dance, and second aspect
is the snehabhaava.  The oil sticks to the hand once you touch it.  Once
attached to the the lord the mind sticks to that or thoughts patterns
are  centered around that - it  is both continutity and ekagrata
involved.  What is implied in my post is to shift the attention in the
rasaliiala from the the thoughts - which are although centered on the
Lord to the Lord itself.  Thinking of the Lord is different from to
identify with the Lord himself or to become one with him.  That is
Bhakti to the ultimate since there cannot be anything other than the
Lord.  The bhakta gets dissolved in the alther of the love for the
supremen.  Yes then one cna see recognized that I am there in the gopies
too. Then only as others have pointed out that one is there inspite  of
thoughts as the essence of the thoughts - pasyamme yogomaiswram - They
are all in me and I am in all them becomes knowledge - that is adviata
or non-duality inspite of duality.
