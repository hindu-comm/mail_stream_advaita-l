Dear Ken,

It is good to see this series being resumed! Let us hope that you will be
able to carry it through without further problems from the computer.

>25.     The Upanishads are, therefore, commenced in order
>to teach the Knowledge of Brahman so that Ignorance
>might be removed and transmigratory existence might
>for ever come to an end.

It is my recollection that Sengaku Mayeda translates this verse somewhat
differently. In particular, I think he takes the term "upanishad" in this
verse as a reference to the Upadesasahasri itself. Of course, in the
original, the word used is "iyam," which is in the singular number
(prArabdhopanishat tv iyam). Could you post the translations of all three
sources that you have with you? I, for one, would be most grateful.

Best regards,
Vidyasankar

Good Evening ( in UK anyway ) Vidyasankar,

Only Jagadananda gives the translation incorrectly as
the plural 'upanishads'. Thanks for pointing this out.

I am posting below the two verses...25 and 26....in
the three versions that I have with the notes on each
as you may like to compare the full notes of each
translator. Only Alston has the Sanskrit
transliteration and I have no version in the
Devanagari script to check this against.
I am offering you these as I tend to only include the
notes which cross reference to sruti and I omit the
sometimes lengthy interpretations of the translators.
I will add these if a particular verse causes some
concern.

Mayeda:
25.     Therefore, in order to destroy ignorance, end
transmigratory existence, and set forth knowledge of
Brahman, this Upanishads been commenced.
26.     And the word Upanishad may be derived from the
verbal root sad preceded by the prefix upa and
ni and followed
the suffix kvip, (1) since it diminishes and
destroys birth and the like. (2)

(1)     kvip is a suffix which disappears after having
been added to several verbal roots, including sad, and
preceded by a preverb.  See Panini  III,2,61; 76 etc.
(2)     Shankara gives similar etymological explanation of
the word upanishad in his commentaries on
Upanishads. He takes the verbal root sad to mean (1)
destroy ..viSharaNa  (2) go, reach (gati) and (3)
mitigate (avasAdana) and interprets the word
upani-shad as: (1) destroy the seeds of transmigratoty
existence such as nescience (2)make seekers after
final release go to highest Brahman. Or (3) mitigate
such a multitude of miseries as living in the womb,
birth, death and old age (garbhavAsajanmajar
Adyapadravab^Rinda.  Shankara, Katha Upanishad,
introduction Shri ShankaragranthAvaliH  pp101-2.
    In another place he explains the word as (1)
destroy (niShAtayati) such numerous evils as birth,
old age and disease
    (garbhajanmajarArogAdyanarthapUga) (2) lead to
highest Brahman or (3) mitigate (avasAdayati)
completely, ie. Annihilate
    (vinAShayati) nescience and other causes of
transmigratoty existence ( Shankara on Mund. Up. Intro
as above p. 304.
    Today it is generally accepted by scholars that
the word Upanishad derived from the verb upa-ni-sad
means: sit (sad)
    down (ni) near [someone].

        Swami Jagadananda
25.     The Upanishads(1) are, therefore,(2)commenced in
order to teach the Knowledge of .Brahman so that
Ignorance might be removed and transmigratory
existence might for ever come to an end(3).

26.     The word Upanishad is derived from the root sad
(4) prefixed by two particles,  Upa (5) and ni (6)
and followed by the suffix Kvip. So, that (7) which
loosens the bondage of birth, (old age), etc., (and
enables a man to approach Brahman) and that which
destroys birth, (death), etc., is called Upanishad.(8)

(1).Upanishadic texts are meant. (2). As right
knowledge independent of actions produces liberation.
(3) This verse states the main conclusion of the
Chapter.
(4)This root has three meanings., (a) to slacken, (b)
to move and (c) to destroy (5)Near. (6) Certainly. (7)
The Knowledge of Brahman (8)1n the primary sense. The
books are so called in a secondary sense only.

Alston:

tasmAd aj~nAna-hAnAya saMsAra-viniv^Rittaye
brahma-vidyA-vidhAnAya prarabdhopanshat tv iyam

[25] Therefore this Upanishad is begun for the removal
of ignorance, for the ending of reincarnation and as a
means to the realization of Brahman.
sader upanipUrvasya kvipi copanishad bhavet
mandikaraNa-bhUvAc ca garbhAdeH  ShAtanAt tathA

[261 The word Upanishad is formed from the root
sad (to destroy) with the prefixes upa and ni
and the suffix called kvip (1) An Upanishad is so
called because it weakens and destroys the cycle of
experiences beginning with birth.
(1)The kvip suffix is a zero suffix supposed to be
used when converting a verbal root into a noun.
