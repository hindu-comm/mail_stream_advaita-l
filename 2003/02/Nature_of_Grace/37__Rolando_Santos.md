Dear Swaminarayan-ji,

Many thanks! It seems I have a weak translation. After
all it does say on the cover: "TRANSLATED FOR THE
MODERN READER." This should have set off some warning
bells. I'm guessing you hold SwamiSarvananda's
translation in high esteem and from the two verses and
commentary, it seems excellent. I will try to get a
copy. You have saved me much trouble. Again, thank
you!

AUM
Rolando
