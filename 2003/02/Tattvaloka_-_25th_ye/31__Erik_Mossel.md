Dear friends!

In April 2003 the magazine "TATTVALOKA" is celebrating its 25 year.

The magazine  founded by H.H. Sri Abhinava Vidyatirtha  is now under the
aegis of H.H. Sri Bharati Tirtha, Sankaracharya of Sringeri and has each
month 84 pages of inspirational articles, photograph, childrens pages, as
well as reviews.

Although reading alone doesn't bring us any further, there is enough
material in theses issues that can motivate us to "practised what is being
preached".

The magazine can highly be recommand to those who want to be in touch with
the source of Advaita teaching.
