The Shrikanthabhashya is more well-known due its' commentary called
Shivarkamanidipika by Appaya Dikshita.  (Appaya Dikshita was a Shaiva
before he converted to Advaita Vedanta.)

The Nirnaya Sagara edition of both works with other related
commentaries was reprinted in 1986 by Naga Publishers, New Delhi.

Was this bhashya from Siddhanta or Vira Shaiva point of view?  I'm not
sure.
