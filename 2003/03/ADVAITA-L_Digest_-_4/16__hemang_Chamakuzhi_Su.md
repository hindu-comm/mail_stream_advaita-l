All,

      Had actually posted a message long back question the very
facet upon which  a person's caste decided at his birth..or is the
varna decided on his Dina karma(his occupation).  By this
defenition most of the world...as they work for the others..and
are not involved in trades/devotion to God..are Sudras..its
improbable that everyone starts pouring lead into everyone else's
ears..anyway..so it would be preposterous to keep reminding
ourselves of arcane rules/laws that were bestowed..... This topic
has probably beaten all records..on the list by all means..

     Please enlighten me, if this defenition is wrong and any of
the scriptures elucidate that birth is  the only way a person's
Varna is decided(ie. his varna is fixed by his Father Or Mother Or
either Or not)....

     If the defenition of shudra, is a laborer or a worker or
someone..who works for others..then all people who work as
software engineers are more or less Sudras...(someone claimed that
since we sell our skill we are more or less the Vishyas...not
shudras..anyways..)

       So Swami chinmayananda, by that defenition of varna is a
Brahmin by Karma, as he has spend most of his life propogating the
hindu Dharma..by elucidating the scriptures to lesser mortals
veiled by their prognostic Karmas..


with due respect.
  -hemang Subramanian

I agree, this topic has captivated the attention more than any I can remember.
My final contribution on the topic of caste determination:
Please refer to BG 18:40 - 44
"In this world, in heaven or again, among gods, no being is found that is free from thse three contstituents [sattva, rajas, and tamas] of Prakriti."
"Sourge of foes! The works of Brahmanas, Ksatriyas and Vaisyas, as also those of the Sudras have been alloted according to the constituents of their nature"
[Shakara himself here comments that a Brahmana is one in whom sattva predominates, a Kshatriya is one in whom rajas subordinates sattva, and a Vaisha is one in whom rajas subordinates tamas. A Shudra is one in whom tamas subordinates rajas.]
"Restraing [of mind], restraint of senses, penance, cleanliness, endurance, guilelessness, knowlesge, realization, faith in the scriptures -- these constitute the work of Brahmanas"
"Courage, power, resolution, skill, non-flight from battle, generosity, and might constitute the work fo the Ksatriyas derived from their nature."
"Agriculture, rearing of cattle, and tade are the works of Vaisyas born of their nature. The work of the Sudras born of Sudra-nature is menial service in essence."
Once again, I refer to the story from the Upanishads [I will find the exact citation soon] in which a Brahmana teacher accepts the son of a prostitute as a Brahmana student based on his honesty and his "nature" -- caste was not determined by birth or family lineage spiritually speaking, though in practice it has been that way.
If anyone would like to offer competing interpretations of caste determinations, I have this to say in advance... The Upanishads and the Gita hold much more weight in the Hindu tradition (spiritually speaking) whereas the the shastras and epics hold much more weight culturally speaking (i.e, as practiced by common people).
Furthermore, in the practice of Vedanta, why does it really matter how caste is determined? Is this not a moot point in modernity? If the Vedas are not to be taught to anyone but the dvijas, then many of us would have have had access to them. It is because of modern techology, mass printing, and foreign translators (especially the Europeans during the 19th Century) that we have access to the shruti texts. The issue of access is a moot one one -- they are avialable to anyone who seeks them 9on the internet, in Indology bookstores, and elsewhere). The issue of access to genuine understanding of the shruti texts is also a moot one -- no matter what one's backgroung by birth, unless one has the right spiritual makeup, one will not undersand the shruti texts no matter how much time one invests in the study of them.
With that said, I conclude my contribution to this topic. I suspect that one can find just about anything in scripture to justify one's own attitude to these issues. That is precisely why I tend to quote the BG or the Upanishads in my contributions -- they carry more weight.
Peace,
Sanjay

All,

Had actually posted a message long back question the very
facet upon which a person's caste decided at his birth..or is the
varna decided on his Dina karma(his occupation). By this
defenition most of the world...as they work for the others..and
are not involved in trades/devotion to God..are Sudras..its
improbable that everyone starts pouring lead into everyone else's
ears..anyway..so it would be preposterous to keep reminding
ourselves of arcane rules/laws that were bestowed..... This topic
has probably beaten all records..on the list by all means..

Please enlighten me, if this defenition is wrong and any of
the scriptures elucidate that birth is the only way a person's
Varna is decided(ie. his varna is fixed by his Father Or Mother Or
either Or not)....

If the defenition of shudra, is a laborer or a worker or
someone..who works for others..then all people who work as
software engineers are more or less Sudras...(someone claimed that
since we sell our skill we are more or less the Vishyas...not
shudras..anyways..)

So Swami chinmayananda, by that defenition of varna is a
Brahmin by Karma, as he has spend most of his life propogating the
hindu Dharma..by elucidating the scriptures to lesser mortals
veiled by their prognostic Karmas..


with due respect.
