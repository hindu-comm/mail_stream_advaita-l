Smartha-s classify the purAna-s in lines of shanmata ideals. Roughly this is
mapped as follows:

1.) PurAna-s praising Vishnu as the para-devata: Eg: Bhagavatam, Vishnu
Puranam, Varaha Puranam,
2.) Praising Shiva: Linga Purana
3.) Praising Skanda: Skanda Purana
4.) Praising Devi: Devi Bhagavatam
5.) Praising Agni: Agni Purana

I am not able to recollect the other. A brief essay about the
classifications of the purAna-s was written by Dr R G Bhandarkar in his
critical translation of the Varaha Purana.
