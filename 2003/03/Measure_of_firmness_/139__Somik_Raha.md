Not related to the debate, but since you mention Sri
Ramakrishna with regard to Advaita, the saint was
approached by the Advaitins and Dvatins - each camp
asking him to endorse them over the other.

The sage said words to this effect - In the infinite
ocean of reality, supreme devotion solidifies water
into chunks of ice - which have definite form and
shape - that is dvaitavad. When the sun of knowledge
shines above, the ice melts and becomes one with the
ocean.

Of course, I don't mean to interrupt your debate -
just thought this story was beautiful.

Regards,
Somik
