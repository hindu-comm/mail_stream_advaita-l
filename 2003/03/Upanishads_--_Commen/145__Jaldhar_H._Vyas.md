There are actually more than that.  Plus whether a text is called
upanishad or not is actually not that useful.  There are various portions
of the Samhita, Brahmana, and Aranyaka portions which are also called
upanishad because they deal with Brahman and portions in the "upanishads"
which deal with karma or upasana.

This is the Bhamati prasthana. The names are not in chronological order.
It should be Vachaspati mishra, Amalananda, then Appaya Dikshita.
Another line of interpretation is started by Padmapadacharyas Vivarana.
Other works following this line are  Vivaranaprameyasangrah, sankshepa
Shariraka etc.

I would first recommend reading our home page at

Then reading some good historical and sociological accounts of modern
Hinduism and Advaita Vedanta so that you learn to distinguish between
tradition and distortion.

Then find some learned person to study with.

Then start reading books.
