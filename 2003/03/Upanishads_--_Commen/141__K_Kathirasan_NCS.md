Namaste Sanjay,

The Shvetashvatara Upanishad too is considered to be commented by Shankara
but some scholars do not accept this.  The commentaries on the Brahma Sutras
are terse.  Hence it is not recommended to learn the bhashya (or the
upanishads) on your own but rather from a teacher who knows the sampradaya.


The english edition of the Brahma Sutra Shankara Bhashya I have is one
published by Ramakrishna Mutt and translated by Swami Gambhiranada. It is
good but would be better if I learn it from a teacher. If I am not wrong,
Swami Paramarthananda Saraswati is giving classes on the Brahma Sutra in
English. If you are interested you may buy the recorded tapes to learn it on
your own. You may visit www.yogamalika.org for more information.

My best wishes.

best regards,
K Kathirasan
