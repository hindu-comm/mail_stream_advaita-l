Dear Members,

Thank you for the responses to my questions.  I can
"deal" with shastras stating considering women as
flesh, etc to develop vairagya or even "considering
vedic sacrifices as useless" compared to one seeking
moksha.  But to see a statement of pouring metal into
a Sudra's ear is contradictory to our morals.

Another qustion I have is about non dvijas not being
being taught Vedas.  Does it apply also to sanyasis of
non-dvija background ? (that is their purva ashrama)
For example, Swami Chinmayananda was of the Nayar
caste in Kerala (which belongs to the Sudra varna) and
he gave discourses on Upanishads.  Are upanishads
limited to sanyasis of dvija background only or
available to all ?

Dhanyavaad, Ravi Chandrasekhara

Hello all,
My sincere apologies if my comments are out of context. I have been busy studying for medical board exams, and as such have not been diligent in reading all the messages on this list serve. So, if my comments are redundant, I am sorry. I came across this email and felt compelled to reply...
While "Shastras" hold a high place in Hindu scripture, let us not forget that they are composed by fallible human beings (i.e., part of the smriti canon of literature). What is written in the various shastras should be taken with a grain of salt -- composed with perhaps good intention, but subject to the cultural and political biases of the time. Whenever there is conflict, the sruti texts always supercede the smriti texts. Therefore, debates about the "morality" or spiritual wisdom of ostensibly prejudiced and inhumane statements (e.g., chopping off the penis of a shudra who has sex with an aryan woman, as quoted below)... debates on these topics are in my opinion a waste of our mental and spiritual energy.
Going back to the purpose of this list serve (Vedanta as taught by Shankaracharya), I believe there is a story about Adi Shankaracharya who encountered an untouchable. At first Sri Shankaracharya was indignant that the low-caste person would not move away from his path. However, when the person responded that the true nature was the Atman, and that for the Atman, there is no low-caste or high-caste, no distinction between "I" and "you", Adi Shankaracharya paid him obeissance for reminding him that worldly distinctions of caste are truly inappropriate for the spiritual sage. Now, I don't have the details of this story memorized... please read this for the spirit of hte message and not the letter of the narration. Thus, women and low-caste memebers being excluded from spiritual teachings is absurd.
I believe on this website, it states that all commentators on Advaita Vedanta make their name by commenting on some canonical works (e.g., Bhagavad Gita, BrahmaSutra, etc.). So, here I refer to BG 5:18, and I quote from Adi Shankaracharya's commentary "Bhagavadgita Bhasya":
"The sages perceive the same truth in the Brahmana, rich in knowledge and culture, a cow, an elephant, a dog and a dog-eating outcaste." BG 5:18
Shankara's commentary:
"In the saatvika brahmana, endowed with knowledge ad culture, who has the best latent imporession of life's experiences, inanintermediate being like the cow that is rajasic without such impression, and in the low merely tamasic beings like anelephant etc, the sages are trained to perceive the same, single, and immutable Brahman, wholly unaffected by constituents like the sattva and by the latent impression they generate."
Furthermore, Shankaracharya anticipates the objection:
"Now, is not the food offered by such tained indivuduals forbidden? Vide, the smriti: 'The food should not be accepted from him who invidiously treats equals as unequals and unequals as eqals' GDS. Answer: 'No, the are not tainted. How?' " [going on to BG 5:19 for further explanation]
Furthermore, in BG 18:30-32, Sri Krishna says that that intellect is rajasic [not as pure as sattvic] which erroneously understands righteousness and unreighteousness, duty and non-dute. Adi Shankaracharya explains in his commentary that the righteousness here refers to those actions enjoined by the shastras and unrighteousness referes to those actions forbidden by the shastras. Clearly, the lesson here is to rise above such shastric morals and focus more on the universal, all-pervading divinity.
Near the end of the BG (18:67-71), Sri Krishna says that "this" (i.e, BG) should not be taught to a non-ascetic, a non-devotee, a person who does not seek it, or a person who reviles Him. Note, that there is no mention of caste or gender. Sri Krishna states that   A N Y O N E   who teaches the BG (to devotees), or who studies this righteous dialogue, or who listens to it, will have offered Him the knowledge sacrifice, which earlier He states is among the highest of sacrifices.
Okay, I must return to my studies... I do hope that we can focus more on the spirit of the all-pervasive Brahman and how to achieve that realization... the ritualistic practices enjoined by the Shastras often times serve to be more divisive rather than cultivating universal love.
Om Shanti,
Sanjay
