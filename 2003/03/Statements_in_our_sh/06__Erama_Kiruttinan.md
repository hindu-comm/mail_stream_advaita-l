Namaste.
"Nayars" or "Nairs" are actually shudras.
They follow a matrilineal system.
Hence  a Brahmin [ Nambudiri] man or a Kshatriya [Varma,Raja] man might have
an alliance with a Nair woman. Their progeny belongs to 'Nair' caste. By
this system, there are instances of paternal grandfather being a Brahmin, as
he was belonging to Nambudiri community; father a Kshatriya as his mother
was from Varma community and son a Shudra as his mother was from the Nair
community.
This is mindboggling, but this was the system being followed till very
recently.

Nowadays, with some exceptions, Nairs marry amongst themselves, Varmas marry
amongst themselves and so do the Nambudiris.

We may not be able to accurately date the shastras, but we do know that they are not in our time., and can safely say that they were composed much before us. How do we know the times have changed? Well, since there seems to be much emphasis on referring to those shastras, then even in the shastras it states that time is changing, and what is appropriate for one yuga is not necessarily appropriate for another yuga, and that even within a yuga there is progressive deterioration of dharma. As for eating meat, nowhere is it forbidden for all to eat meat -- only for Brahmins. In fact, for a Kshatriya warrier, it is encouraged to eat meat. The point is not wether or not you should eat meat based on your cultural surroundings, but rather, as was quoted on this discussion group some time back, "Better a man who eats pork and thinks of God than one who abstains from eating meat and does not think of God." Cleearly, what is more important is the cultivation of divinity within one's heart, not the outward actions. In fact, if one looks at the evolution of shruti, one sees that the reason the Upanishads came into being was that the ritualistic aspect of the Vedas was being mispraciced by the people as perfunctory rites. So, the Upanishads, which are supposedly a condensation of the Vedas, remind us that the intent and knowledge behind the yajna is more important than the physical act. Furthermore, an act done in a sacrifice without the awareness of Brahman being the sacrifice, is not Vedanta  its just propitiating a specific deity for a specific reward.

I agree with you... I was merely pointing out that some scriptures are considered to have more weight than others. Clearly, the shruti texts have the greatest weight among the scriptures. Since you brought it up, I have also read (can't remember the citation at present) that the greatest authority for wisdom is one's own experience. One should never accept something which does not correspond to one's exerience. The emphasis in Hiduism, especially Vedanta, has been "experience" (i.e, to practice cultivating that perception of the oneness of the universe). Once again, the point is not what is "infallible", but which carries more weight. If something is found objectionable in a shastra, one should be able to use one's own intellect, with reference to shruti texts, to completely disregard any objectionable statements. I do not have any suggestions about what one should do if one finds something objetionable in a shruti text... The Upanishads are considered shruti, right? Many statements in one ostensibly contradict statements in another. Paradox is inherent in the shruti texts, precisely because the subject is too complex for our most uncultivated minds (as most human beings are) to comprehend.

I am sorry for this. As I said, I had not been reading all the postings, so I didnt realize that the topic was whether or not they should have access to the Vedas. However, my argument still holds. One can probably find any argument to support the view in one's heart. I don't have the exact reference, but in the Upanishads (Chandogya?) there is a story about a boy who comes to a Brahmin for teaching. The guru asks him about his lineage. The boy replies: my mother is a prostitute, and hence I do no know who my father is. The guru accepts the boy as a student, saying, truly you must be a Brahmin for only a Brahmin would practice such adherence to truth without regard to shame. So, if only Brahmins (or other dvijas) should have access to the Vedas, then clearly who is a Brahmin is determined more by ones svabhava (inner, true nature) than ones outer body, which is discarded anyway.

Yes, this was brought to my attention last time also (i.e., that the Gita is actually a smriti text). While that may be technically correct, I dont think such classification is appropriate in the Hindu tradition. First, the Gita is only part of the Mahabharata from a literary standpoint, not a spiritual standpoint. What I mean by this is that there are many (hundreds?) recensions of the epics (both the Mahabharata and Ramayana). However, there is only 1 Gita, without any recensions. Through the centuries all 700 verses come down to us without even one syllable being changed. How could this happen if this portion of the Mahabharata did not carry more authority and value than other smriti texts? Now before anyone points out to me that some place 701 verses in the Gita, I am aware of this. But even this additional verse is consistent in that if it appears anywhere, it appears in the same form.  No such consistency can be found with the epics or nonshruti texts.

As for the Brahmasutra, I do not have any knowledge of what weight it carries in the tradition. I was under the impression (perhaps mistaken) that the sutras carry more weight than the shastras.

Yes, this can be debated on both sides. Perhaps we are splitting hairs. The message of the Gita and the Upanishads is to place a greater emphasis on knowledge and perception of oneness than on ritualistic duty. I brought this up from the perspective of debating the shastras. The Upanishads and the Gita do seem to place greater emphasis on knowledge and meditation and true sanyas (true sanyas in the Gita not being used to describe an ascetic but rather one who gives up attachment in the heart/mind) than on physical ritual.

BG 12:12 Knowledge is superior to repeated efforts; superior to knowledge is meditation. Renunciation of the fruits of works is superior to meditation. Of this renunciation is peace born, immediately.

If others find it valuable to debate the shastric injunctions, then I apologize for my interjection. I thought the purpose of this discussion group was Vedanta, and the shastras certainly do have a place, but I dont think that they are regarded as highly in the Vedantic tradition as the Upanishads and the Gita, and certainly not the Vedas.

Once again I refer to the story from the Upanishads about a true Brahmin being one whose character demonstrates his/her worthiness to learn scripture, not ones birth body.

It is very understandable to have anger and hatred toward someone who has caused so much harm. However, it is easy to love those who are nice to us. If we cannot love our enemies, then we still have some self-development to undertake. Universal love may sound absurd, but if one perceives the oneness of the Universe, the all-pervasive Brahman, then the whole issue is moot. To have love for one aspect of Brahman and not another aspect of Brahman is a contradiction, as Brahman is without division. While we may try and perform our social duties by trying to counter, even kill, enemies of dharma, we need not do this with hate and anger. In fact, Sri Krishna instructs Arjuna, that to kill without hatred is to act without being tainted by karma. Holding onto hatred will be an obstacle to ones spiritual development.

In BG 12:13 Sri Krishna describes the attributes necessary to attain the perception of oneness of the universe He hates no beings, is friendly and compassionate; he is rid of all sense of possession and of egoism; he is the same in pleasure and pain and is long-suffering.

Hate is the seed of anger, and anger is one of the three gates to hell (kama, krodha, lobha).

Once again, I refer back to stories in our tradition. Jayan and Vijayan were two guards at Vaikunta where Narayana was residing. A dirty ascetic (Brahmin) came asking for Narayana to grant him audience. The guards scolded him for coming to see Naryana in such an unkempt manner. The Brahmin took offense and cursed the two to be far away from Vaikunta since they were keeping him away from Narayana. Jayan and Vijayan ran to Narayan for protection. He said to them, I cannot void the curse of a Brahmin, but I can modify it. So, you can live as a cultured human for many lifetimes and then return to Me, or you can live as a rakhsasa for only a few lifetimes and return to Me sooner. The two immediately chose to live as rakshasas and return sooner. One of those rakshasas is none other than Ravana in the Ramayana. So, while Ravanas body may need to be killed to protect dharma, his Atman actually belongs in Vaikunta with Narayana. The point being here that we cannot not know for what purpose each Atman came to this humanly form. It may sound absurd, but if one does not practice universal love (for the inner Atman), then one is far from Vaikunta indeed.

What may seem stupid, is the only path to cultivating divinity within oneself. We must perform our social duties, but we must not allow ourselves to harbor hate, for any being.

A successful civilization is<BR>>one that can juggle these mutually incompatible goals.<BR><BR style="mso-special-character: line-break"><BR style="mso-special-character: line-break"><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"><o:p></o:p></SPAN></FONT></FONT></P>
<P><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">It is very understandable to have anger and hatred toward someone who has caused so much harm. However, it is easy to love those who are nice to us. If we cannot love our enemies, then we still have some self-development to undertake. Universal love may sound absurd, but if one perceives the oneness of the Universe, the all-pervasive Brahman, then the whole issue is moot. To have love for one aspect of Brahman and not another aspect of Brahman is a contradiction, as Brahman is without division. While we may try and perform our social duties by trying to counter, even kill, enemies of dharma, we need not do this with hate and anger. In fact, Sri Krishna instructs Arjuna, that to kill without hatred is to act without being tainted by karma. Holding onto hatred will be an obstacle to ones spiritual development.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">In BG 12:13 Sri Krishna describes the attributes necessary to attain the perception of oneness of the universe He hates no beings, is friendly and compassionate; he is rid of all sense of possession and of egoism; he is the same in pleasure and pain and is long-suffering.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">Hate is the seed of anger, and anger is one of the three gates to hell (kama, krodha, lobha).<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">Once again, I refer back to stories in our tradition. Jayan and Vijayan were two guards at Vaikunta where Narayana was residing. A dirty ascetic (Brahmin) came asking for Narayana to grant him audience. The guards scolded him for coming to see Naryana in such an unkempt manner. The Brahmin took offense and cursed the two to be far away from Vaikunta since they were keeping him away from Narayana. Jayan and Vijayan ran to Narayan for protection. He said to them, I cannot void the curse of a Brahmin, but I can modify it. So, you can live as a cultured human for many lifetimes and then return to Me, or you can live as a rakhsasa for only a few lifetimes and return to Me sooner. The two immediately chose to live as rakshasas and return sooner. One of those rakshasas is none other than Ravana in the Ramayana. So, while Ravanas body may need to be killed to protect dharma, his Atman actually belongs in Vaikunta with Narayana. The point being here that we cannot not know for what purpose each Atman came to this humanly form. It may sound absurd, but if one does not practice universal love (for the inner Atman), then one is far from Vaikunta indeed. <o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">What may seem stupid, is the only path to cultivating divinity within oneself. We must perform our social duties, but we must not allow ourselves to harbor hate, for any being.</SPAN></P>
