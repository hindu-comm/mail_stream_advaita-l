There are several problems with such a view.

1.  What are the "times"?  For many shastras we don't exactly when they
were composed or in what millieu.  How do we know "the times" have
changed?  For instance I live in America where most people eat meat.
Should I start eating meat too becuase that is what everyone else does?
Or convert to Christianity becuase my minority religion is just a cultural
bias?

2.  You say Shruti should be considered infallible.  What will you do if
objectionable statements are found there?  Maharshi Yajnavalkyas'
teachings are mentioned in the Upanishads.  There is also a popular and
influential dharmashastra called Yajnavalkyasmrti.  Why should some of his
words be considered infallible and others fallible?  Actually Hinduism
doesn't have the concept of infallibility of scripture as some other
religions do.

3.  How do you take a grain of salt?  Is there some method to determine
the appropriate interpretation or does everyone get to pick and choose?

As was mentioned in the last series of posts, this particular case is moot
because nothing like that actually happened.  Nevertheless it is
worthwhile for us to think about the foundations of Dharma if we want to
see it carried on into new situations.

Yes this was mentioned last time.

Ah but the issue is whether they are allowed to learn the Vedas.  The
Vedas are only part of the spiritual teachings of Advaita Vedanta so it
does not follow that exclusion from the Vedas is exclusion altogether.
But even if it were the case, from the Advaita point of view it would not
matter at all.  Brahman pervade all.  A rock or tree is also Brahman but
it cannot know it because it has no power of self-reflection.  People on
the other hand even people who have never studied the Vedas do have that
capacity.

worthy person as an inferior but that _he_treated_him_as_different_at_all_.
It would have been just as much a sin if the chandala had been ignorant.

But note of those three, the Gita (part of the Mahabharata) and
Brahmasutras are the product of "fallible" human authors. :)

The message here as Shankaracharya intends it is to take sannyasa.  Only
the one who has renounced the world can rise above Shastric morals.  Those
of us in this world however are the type who have non-duties and duties
etc.  It is illegitimate for such people to use Vedantic notions as an
excuse to shirk the dictates of the shastras.

And this is the key to the dilemna.  Those who are barred from the Vedas
can still know the way to liberation through the Gita and other Smrtis
which deal with adhyatmic topics.  And their goal if they reach it will be
the same as one who has mastered all four Vedas.

Now I am about to say something that might sound quite cynical but here
goes:  universal love is a stupid idea.

Take Osama bin Laden.  Quite frankly I hate him for what he almost did to
my family.  Thankfully so do many other people so we may soon be rid of
him but do you really think it would be a good idea to love him?  You can
argue that the present course of action being taken against him is not the
best or that hating him should not lead to hating all Muslims and these
are valid points but are still not the same as universal love.  I wrote
earlier about the contradictions in civilization and this is a big one.
People for the most part are uncomfortable with extremes of inequality yet
they also want to feel special and unique.  A successful civilization is
one that can juggle these mutually incompatible goals.
