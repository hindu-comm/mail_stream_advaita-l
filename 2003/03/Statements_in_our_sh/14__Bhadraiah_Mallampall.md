Sri Adi Sankara was also a reformer-type like Sri Dayanada Saraswati, but
with a difference. The former silenced all his contemporaries before he got
down to reform, whereas the latter didn't. There were many among Hindus who
opposed Dayanada's reforms. That will have a bearing on the meaningfulness
and effectiveness of the reforms. If people don't come out of closets or
dump you in a closet that is a different issue though :-)

Best regards
Bhadraiah
