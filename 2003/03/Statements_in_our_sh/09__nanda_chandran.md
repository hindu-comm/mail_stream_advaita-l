>"Nayars" or "Nairs" are actually shudras.

It is not for those who are not braahmanas in the traditional sense to make
such pronouncements. Most modern braahmanas today since they do not live by
their svadharma, as per shaastric rules, will themselves have to be
considered shudra or worse.

BTW the derogatory sense that the term "shudra" has acquired seems to be a
modern phenomenon - a good chunk of the bhakti saints in South India were
shudra - but they don't seem to have minded such a designation and weren't
known to have been particularly hostile to the varna system.
