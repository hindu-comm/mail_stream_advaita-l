Just to be a little legalistic about it - there are strong arguments for
classifying Nayars as Kshatriyas. Similarly with the Marathas in Maharashtra
and various other ruling/martial groups of people. These have been made many
times in the past, especially over the last two centuries. There has been a
particularly south Indian trend to designate all non-Brahmana-s as being
Shudras. This is highly debatable, and well-respected authorities on the
dharmashAstras have argued against it.
