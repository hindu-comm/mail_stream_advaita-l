My mother retrieved a bunch of old books from her uncle's house. They were
Tamil translations of Shankaraachaaryaa's commentaries on the Upanishads.
Apparently a few decades back, a scholar by name Somadeva Sharma, who lived
in West Mambalam in Madras, used to publish a spiritual magazine which
included these translations.

I read one on the Chaandogya - it was very good.

Maybe you could check for similar material on BSB by the same author.
