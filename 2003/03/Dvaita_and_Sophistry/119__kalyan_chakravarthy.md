Namaskaaram,

Where does sruti indicate this?

How do you know it is eternally constant?

Good. So experience is non sequitur.

> > Do you really get this eternal damnation idea from vedanta?
>
>Yes, for example, from `andhaM tamaH pravishanti ye.avidyAmupAsate'
>(Ishavasya U. 9), and also Krishna's word `mAM aprApyaiva kaunteya tato
>yAnti adhamAM gatim.h' (having certainly failed to reach me, they reach
>the lowest state).

1.How do you link the Isa Upanishad statement to eternal damnation? Where
does the Upanishad say that andhaM tamaH is eternal?

2.Besides, if lowest state is great darkness, then what about the
worshippers of vidya?

Best Regards
Kalyan
