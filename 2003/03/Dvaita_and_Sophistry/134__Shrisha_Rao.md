Okay, fair enough.  However, if a prolonged duration is indicated without
any recourse shown as to its end, then that shows an infinite duration
only.

On the contrary, there is no indication that the transit is ever reversed.

A verb does not stress or support a noun.

Let us deal with originals, not with translations (esp. unspecified ones
that cannot be checked).

In his BSB (1.3.1) Sri Sankara has explicitly stated his understanding to
be that the word AtmA is *always* (samyak.h) used to refer to one thing
and that no other meaning may be applied: Atmashabdashcha
paramAtmaparigrahe samyak.h avakalpate, nArthAntaraparigrahe.  I could
scarcely have conjured a more supportive statement were I able to have one
made to order.

Also see, e.g., the early portions of the adhyAsa-bhAshhya (AtmA cha
brahma, &c.) or the discussion of `Atmeti tu upagachchhanti grAhayanti
cha' (4.1.3).

In dealing with the same Upanishad you reference, Sri Sankara has clearly
prohibited any notion that the Atman is an object of worldly dealings (as
the mind is): nAtmano vishhayIkaraNam.h.  (See `tad.h brahma idaM
sharIrasthaM yad.hgR^ihyate...' &c., explaining `tad.h AtmAnaM eva
Avet.h'.)

I would most cheerfully grant that I am largely, or even almost totally,
ignorant of Advaitic texts (though I couldn't care less about their modern
interpretations), but on this point I have the word of the mUlAchArya on
my side.  Any evidence or inference you may adduce against it will run
stiffly up against his word, `nArthAntaraparigrahe'.
