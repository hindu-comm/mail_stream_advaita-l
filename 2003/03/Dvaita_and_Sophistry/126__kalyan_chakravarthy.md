Namaskaaram,

That bypasses the question. I am least bothered about existence. How do you
know that a "bad" soul is eternally "bad"?

Already said that it indicates a fall.

No. For you yourself said that sunless worlds indicate something bad.

You are just making a forced interpretation.

I dont need sruti to tell me atat tvam asi.

Sruti does not use atmA in the same sense always. You cannot disprove my
statement by quoting random references. You are diverting the main issue.
Introducing the *tat tvam asi* context here is unwarranted.

FYKI, did I give you this specific example in the first place to prove my
assertion that the word atmA is not always used in the same sense?

You have just forced an interpretation which by no means can be called as
meeting the burden.

If that does not make sense then sruti does not make sense to you. That's
your own problem. A sensible interpretation must not change the meanings of
words randomly and I know who has done it :-)

>How is one caught in blinding darkness to achieve this?

Method is simple - combine vidya and avidya.

Context - It does not contradict experience.

There are innnumerable examples of an obect moving from one state to another
in daily experience.

May be in dvaita as it attaches absolute reality to phenomenal experiecnes
but not so in advaita.
