That amounts to equating mR^ityu with andhaM tamas, which is unsupported
as the latter follows the former.  That death can be crossed over does not
automatically imply that andhaM tamas can be crossed over as well.

Further, there is no indication that the people referenced vide `mR^ityuM
tIrtvA amR^itaM ashnute' are the same people who are stated to go to
andhaM tamas.  Just as in the Bhagavad Gita, it is not indicated that the
cruel asura-s who "certainly fail to reach Me" (mAM aprApya eva) are the
same "un-selfish saints who enter [Me]" (vishanti yadyatayo vItarAgAH).

That seems to make sense, yes, though I will wait till I can look at
Anandagiri's commentary first.  (It will take me a couple of weeks to lay
hands on a copy.)

This being so, wouldn't you say the `AtmA' in that portion is not a
Vedantic usage, but a ritual one?

I would prefer to look at the subcommentaries first.  Even granting your
explanation, however, I don't see that the conclusion is weakened.

"Veera Shaivism" was more a "caste reform" movement though ofcourse they
have their specific texts, rituals etc - it is mainly restricted to
Karnaataka.

But Saiva Siddhaanta is a highly spiritual siddhaanta and has its origins in
TamilNadu. Srikantha belonged to this stream as did Appaya.
