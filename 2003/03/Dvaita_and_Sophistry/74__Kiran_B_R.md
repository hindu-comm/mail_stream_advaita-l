tvayi mayi chaanyatraiko vishhNuH

In me, in you and in everything, none but the same Vishnu dwells. Your
anger and impatience are meaningless. If you wish to attain the status of
Vishnu soon, have samabhava always.

bhajagovindaM bhajagovindaM
govindaM bhajamuuDhamate .
saMpraapte sannihite kaale
nahi nahi rakshati DukRiJNkaraNe

Worship Govinda, Worship Govinda, Worship Govinda. Oh fool ! Rules of
Grammar will not save you at the time of your death.
