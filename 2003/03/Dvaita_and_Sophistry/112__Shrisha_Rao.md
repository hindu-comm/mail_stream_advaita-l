Actually, in the BG, it is clearly the jIva-s, and not the foods, who are
labeled as sAttvika, etc.  The usages in chapter XVII are clearly `AhArAH
sAttvikapriyAH' (foods dear to sAttvika-s), `AhArA rAjasasyeshhTAH' (foods
liked by rAjasa-s), and `bhojanaM tAmasapriyam.h' (meal dear to tAmasa-s).
To support your contention, the usages *should have been* `AhArAH
sAttvikAH' (foods that are sAttvika), &c.

No, because your interpretation of the relevant scriptural text is clearly
incorrect.
