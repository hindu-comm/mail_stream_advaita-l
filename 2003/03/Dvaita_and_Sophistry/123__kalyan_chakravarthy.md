Thank you.

A being cannot be equated to a quality that it is known to possess at a
given instant of time. Thus an undecaying soul does not imply that the soul
is good or bad eternally. By the way I only said that the  soul is
undecaying.

It can indicate a fall.(not necessarily eternal)

As for this, there is no guarentee that a particular word is used in sruti
in always the same sense. As liberation is a state to be reached, there is
nothing wrong in using gachchhati and co. That liberation is eternal is
anyway known from other portions of sruti. Thus the usage of abhigachchhanti
does not necessarily signify eternal transit.

It is the context that decides the meaning when there is a doubt.
