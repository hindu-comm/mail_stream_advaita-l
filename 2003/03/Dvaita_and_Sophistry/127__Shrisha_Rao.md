No, it only "bypasses the question" because you have, once again,
forgotten what the question is.  Try to remain focused.  Your question
was, once again, how one knows that a soul has an eternal self-same
nature.  This is known merely from the fact that it has the eternal nature
of existence.  That it has the further nature of sattva, etc., as the case
may be, is known from Bhagavad Gita XVII-2/3.  The self-same nature is
immutable, for if it were not, then even the self-same quality of
existence would be in jeopardy.

No lexical authority or traditional interpretation supports such a
reading, and your unlearned say-so is not enough.  (I notice that you
hesitate little in making wild postulations -- learn first to check and
come up with some acceptable authority or support before you do.)

Further, the point is that `gachchhanti' is itself enough to indicate a
fall: why the adverbial modifier?  If you say it "indicates a fall,"
then you have no idea what an adverb is.

However, a verb referencing a noun-phrase in the same verse/sentence
cannot be sensibly called as repeating something that has *already been
said*.  Before the verb is used, nothing has yet been "said" yet.

Rubbish -- you just don't know what `asAdhAraNyena vyapadeshA bhavanti' is.

Apparently, you don't need it to tell you anything; your foot remains
stuck in your mouth unaided.

Rubbish again; you just don't understand.  What I said is black-letter
Vedantic doctrine; even Sri Sankara accepts that `AtmA' refers to one
thing only, and his criticisms of others in several places are based on
this principle.

I ask that you study up on your Vedanta before venturing to discuss it.
Do you even know the references I gave, and their classical
interpretations? Vedanta is not, contrary to what you imagine, a mere
chimera that you can make up as you go along; you need serious discipline,
as well as the serious commitment to make whatever efforts necessary, and
the humility in learning from a genuine master, before you can be accepted
as making any sense in its regard.
