Is it not possible for a tamasic person to become a sattvik one? If it is,
then one cannot claim that his nature does not change. If not,of what use
are the scriptures to one who is tamasic? Can sattva, rajas, tamas be an
inherent property of the soul itself? If they are, then all persons with
tamasic nature are bound for damnation(like in dvaita philosophy). Do you
really get this eternal damnation idea from vedanta?

But the difference in their actions show that prakriti acts in a
heterogenous fashion. Experience says that. You cannot deny experience. Your
wish however if you choose to deny it.

No,for a theist may get converted to an atheist. An atheist anyway has least
regard for spiritual labour. Similarly, an atheist may get converted to a
theist. Would you deny these possibilities? Would you still say faith is
constant?

You are making a far-reaching generalization. Faith is the major casuality
in today's world. Change of faith is possible. Dont you see many people
changing their religions? Who is a true seeker and who is not, who knows?

Well, even bad people get reformed. Dont they? Does a bad person remain bad
forever? May be in this birth. What about other births?

But anecdotal experience should not go against the theory itself. Theory
must be universally applicable.
