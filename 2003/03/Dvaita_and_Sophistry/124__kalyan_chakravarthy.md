Namaskaaram,


>Certainly.  However, the fact remains that being (astitva/sattA in

How does it show that this nature is eternally constant?

Same question as above.

Not necessary. For there is nothing wrong or meaningless in saying that
people fall into dark worlds. There is also a difference between stating the
obvious and emphasizing(or supporting) what has already been said. There is
no guarentee that sruti avoids the latter. Eg. tat tvam asi.(or atat tvam
asi in your point of view. Infact your reasoning jeopardizes atat tvam asi,
but I dont want to digress into that now.)

There is one more problem with your reasoning. How do you justify your
reading in of the eternal damnation idea?

The word atmA.

>That damnation is eternal is also known from other sources, e.g., from
>`mAM aprApyaiva'.

Leaving aside the truth value of your interpretation, are you admitting that
the Isa Upanishad does not indicate eternal damnation?

>If `abhigachchhanti' does not signify eternal transit (a position that

>Not having clarified this point, the Upanishad must be considered to have

>Therefore, even if the etymology that is the basis could somehow be fixed,

1. As you are reading in an idea, the burden of justification lies on you.
2. Combine vidya and avidya to achieve the goal.(comes immediately next)
3. Transition of states is a possibility from day to day experience.

Kalyan

Dear Learned members,

Can somebody explain the direct and inner meanings and explanation of the name ROHITH as it appears in Sri Rudram as 'Rohithaya sthapathaye'.

TIA
Regards
Anand K
