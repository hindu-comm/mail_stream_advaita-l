These are your own statements -

1. That's fine.  Even so, it suffices to show that difference is a quality,
which was the point you questioned.

2.Try the dictionary, which defines difference as "the quality of being
unlike or dissimilar," etc.

Why would suggest the dictionary, unless you yourself accept its definition?

Best Regards
Kalyan
