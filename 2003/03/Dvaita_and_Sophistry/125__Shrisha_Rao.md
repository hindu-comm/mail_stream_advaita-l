If existence is not an eternal property, then the jIva is not eternal, a
position that no Vedantin accepts.  Therefore, an eternal entity has the
eternal nature of existence.

Correct, except that the `abhi-' prefix is still not dealt with -- just
what are its significance and purpose according to you?

Except that there can be no suggestion that descent into dark worlds has
*already been said* in the IU as of verse 3, where `abhigachchhanti' is
used.  For your reasoning to work, we should have met `abhigachchhanti' at
the *second* reference on verse 9, or later, when we could have said the
Upanishad was supporting what had already been said.

Therefore, if we ignore the idea of repetition and simply accept emphasis,
then that very emphasis (vide the accepted exegetical principle of
`asAdhAraNyena vyapadeshA bhavanti') serves to show that the transit must
be eternal.

That's fine; besides, you have never studied `atat tvaM asi', so the
provenience of your arguments would be much in question.

The fact that `abhigachchhanti' signifies eternal transit -- haven't you
been paying attention?

That is probably the *worst* example one could find for your case, as its
Vedantic meaning is the most fixed: it means the same in, e.g., `AtmA vA
are drashhTavyaH', &c., and in `gauNashchennAtmashabdAt.h'.  In fact, the
latter specifically rules out applicability of the word to refer to the
embodied, living being.  The well known statement `sa AtmA tat tvaM asi'
("that is the Atman; that thou art," in the Advaitic interpretation)
requires `AtmA' to mean something other than the embodied.  If `AtmA' were
to mean the embodied being (which would be in direct contravention of
`gauNashchennAtmashabdAt.h'), then the final purport of the instruction
would be for Uddalaka to tell Shwetaketu that he was the embodied ("that
is the embodied; that thou art").

Stating that a person is the embodied also is not a non-dual instruction
(which is the common interpretation).  In fact, it is a mere belaboring of
the obvious like calling a pot round, and is not a Vedantic statement of
any kind.  Therefore, even in `sa AtmA' the word `AtmA' means the same.

Of course it does.  You seem to continually lose track of the context in
making your responses.  My statement was made in the context of yours
claiming that liberation (as opposed to damnation) is known to be eternal.

No, it does not in this case.  I have already met my burden.  If you come
up with an objection to my reading (as you have attempted), then the
burden of dealing with the absurdities arising out of your objection is
certainly yours and not mine.

> 2. Combine vidya and avidya to achieve the goal.(comes immediately next)

Except that such a reading makes no sense, in several ways -- exactly what
does "combine vidyA and avidyA" mean?  How is one caught in blinding
darkness to achieve this?

> 3. Transition of states is a possibility from day to day experience.

However, Vedanta is not about mere daily experience, so the simile is all
wrong -- one cannot compare dissimilar things and derive conclusions about
them (for example, one would be wrong to say that sea water must be
potable because river water is).  Besides, in fact, transition of states
is *not* daily experience, so the antecedent of the proposed inference is
false as well.  Daily experience has one living in the world as an
embodied, only.  Last but not least, if one ignores these problems and
simply takes transition to be a possibility based on the [alleged]
similarity with daily experience, then even mukti would become transitory,
a position that, by reductio ad absurdum, shows the inference rule also to
be fallacious.
