Which is why that was eliminated in the beginning itself.

Have you read the postings on dvaita and sophistry?

Is this the only tactic that you have been left with?  There was only one
post on dvaita and brahmasutras that I presented in that forum. Why dont you
check it out here?

The other posts on the paradox of differences were presented by my cousin
Akshara who shares his ideas with me. If you had found a similarity in
arguments, you should have brought it to my notice and allowed me to explain
it. Coming to hasty conclusions about me reflect your level of maturity.

The opinion was never foisted by me. It is your own dvaita which talks of
differences as being part of entities. That the dvaitic argument cannot
differentiate the real and the unreal is a good enough reason to reject it.

The dictionary meaning is useless for evaluation of a concept from the
philosophical point of view. It just mentions difference as a quality
without telling where that quality is held. Qualities cannot be ascribed to
non-entities. That is one more reason why it is impossible to capture
difference between the real and the unreal using the dvaitic mode of
reasoning. If you consider it as a being held individually by the objects
which hold the difference, then there must again be a difference between its
individual appearances and the reasoning goes on. In this case there is a
danger of the difference being the difference as well as a similarity. The
infinite regress occurs again if you try to capture it outside the two
entities.
