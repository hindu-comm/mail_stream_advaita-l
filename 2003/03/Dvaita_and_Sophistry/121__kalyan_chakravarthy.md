One can understand that avyaya means that soul has no death or decay.
But how does avyaya mean that the soul has a nature and that is  eternally
constant?

*abhigachchhanti* is more an indication of reaching or falling or entering
rather than an indication of going for good without coming back.

It does not necessarily signify that. Nor does it mean that the darkness is
eternal.

Not necessary again. The darkness could last for a very long period of time
and thus is very bad. No evidence that the darkness is eternal.

That could as well be termed as speculation. It would be illogical to say
that people who have right knowledge go into a darkness greater than people
with wrong knowledge. Besides if vidya or avidya alone provde very bad
results, how can their combination produce liberation?
