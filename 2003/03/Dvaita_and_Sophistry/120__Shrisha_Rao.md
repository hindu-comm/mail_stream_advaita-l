RV 6.47.18 and other places.  These are cited in one of B.N.K. Sharma's
books.

Because the embodied, i.e., the jIva, has been described as `avyaya'
elsewhere, which means precisely that.

No, your response was.

In verse 3, where in connection with `adhaM tamas', the usage is
`abhigachchhanti' ([they] go for good), rather than just `gachchhanti'
([they] go).  The very phrase `andhaM tamaH' also signifies unremitting
darkness.  As Upanishads, and Vedantic texts in general, are about
knowledge leading to unending liberation, they care little about the joys
or suffering of the heaven and hell from which one can return.  When an
Upanishad warns of unremitting darkness, it is warning of something far
worse only.

That is essentially Max Mueller's objection to Sri Shankara's explanation
of the verse.

However, if one grants, as the Upanishad itself indicates, that there can
also be degrees of suffering in damnation (as there are degrees of
enjoyment in liberation), then there is no issue.
