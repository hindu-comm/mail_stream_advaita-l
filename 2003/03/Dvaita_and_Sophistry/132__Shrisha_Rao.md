I am not linking damnation to it; I am just pointing out the relevance of
the prefix in light of the maxim `asAdhAraNyena vyapadeshA bhavanti'.  By
the way, you still have not met the burden of proof in regard to your
claimed interpretation of the prefix.

Not so separately, however, in the noun-phrase meaning "dark worlds" and
the verb "fall into."  That is the point.  Therefore, one cannot say that
"fall into" repeats something *already indicated by* "dark worlds" as you
claimed.

?  Hardly.  You have in any case not provided any hard evidence or
interpretation of commentary; I am least inclined to honor your bare
assertion (elsewhere too).  You in any case seem to prefer unspecified
translations (as per your word elsewhere) and not the original, which is
one reason I am disinclined to trust your understanding.

Once again, the maxim of `asAdhAraNyena vyapadeshA bhavanti'.  Pay
attention!
