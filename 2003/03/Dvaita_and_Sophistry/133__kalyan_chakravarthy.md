On the contrary, eluded.

Already said that the maxim does not necessarily show that the transit must
be eternal. The maxim can as well show the prolonged duration of the
transit. A pre-requisite for eternal transit is the eternal existence of
such dark worlds which again has not been indicated(definitely not by andHam
tamah).

The claim was not that of repetition but of giving stress or support. You
will understand it if you contrast it with "going into dark worlds".

The translations are advaitic translations. In the brihadaranyaka upanishad
1.2.1, the word AtmA is not taken as meaning either the individual or
supreme Self but is read as the mind. If you accept it, then you are eating
your own words. If you deny it, then I can rest assured of your ignorance of
advaitic interpretations.

Once again, the maxim does not show the necessity. Understand that the
necessity is being questioned.

Best Regards
Kalyan
