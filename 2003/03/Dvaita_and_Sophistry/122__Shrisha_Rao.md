Sharma, B.N.K., `Philosophy of Madhvacharya' (and probably also `History
of the Dvaita School of Vedanta), Motilal Banarsidass, hardcover.

By the way, I believe the exact reference is for verses 6.47.16 and
6.47.17; 6.47.18 is also important, but as a follow-on, when it says
`rUpaM rUpaM pratirUpo babhUva tadasya rUpaM pratichaxaNAya'.

By your own postulation, the *nature* of the soul is to have no decay or
death, and this is eternally so.  It cannot be otherwise even for your
interpretation to work.  Hence, the word does convey as said.

No, the prefix `abhi-' is very significant, and your idea does not cover
it.

Your interpretation also does not accord with Vedantic usage: the words
`gachchhati', `gachchhanti', `adhigachchanti', `nigachchhati', etc., are
used many times in the Bhagavad Gita, and not in the temporary sense you
envision.  What you said would make even mukti temporary (`adhigachchati',
etc., being also repeatedly used to refer to the seeker's reaching
liberation).  This is opposed to the sUtra `anAvR^ittiH shabdAdanAvR^ittiH
shabdAt.h' or the Shruti `na cha punarAvartate na cha punarAvartate'.
Therefore, the `abhigachchhanti' refers to an eternal transit only.

Again, you are actually assailing Sri Shankara's interpretation, not
something I feel compelled, or competent, to defend.  Your point also does
not correlate with the matter at hand.
