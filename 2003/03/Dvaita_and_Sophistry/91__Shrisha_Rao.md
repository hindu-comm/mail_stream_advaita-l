Correct in a certain limited sense, but that is because I am not
challenging your position, you are challenging mine.  I have not taken it
on myself to raise questions about your views; I am just defending my own.
In this context, saying that your question was deficient (or that you were
referring to a question that had not been posed) is a significant
objection.
