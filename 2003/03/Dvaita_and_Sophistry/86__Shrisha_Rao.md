Short answer: I don't.  You haven't even come close to demonstrating that
I do.

Correction:

Kindly please note that the Acharya always uses the words Ishwara
and Parameshwara to Bhagavan Narayana only.   The words are used
in the Gita Bhashya also throughout... but in places even when
referring to Vasudeva.   To Him Vasudava, Krishna, Parameshvara ,
Ishvara are all synonyms.

He NEVER allures anywhere to Rudra / Chandramouleeshwara etc.
ANYWHERE in this Bhashya.
