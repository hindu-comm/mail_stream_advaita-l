Correct, but it isn't possible.

They aren't.  No one has said they are.

Yes, as per Krishna's explicit word: svabhAvajA.

Correct; again as per Krishna's word: adho gachchhanti tAmasAH.

> Do you really get this eternal damnation idea from vedanta?

Yes, for example, from `andhaM tamaH pravishanti ye.avidyAmupAsate'
(Ishavasya U. 9), and also Krishna's word `mAM aprApyaiva kaunteya tato
yAnti adhamAM gatim.h' (having certainly failed to reach me, they reach
the lowest state).

No quarrel there.  The point however is that noting the various types of
food, etc., the various types of jIva-s form preferences in accord with
their own natures.  The preferences would have no meaning if the foods,
etc., were themselves all alike, which they aren't.

The external manifestation of a person's quality is not constant (just as
a gem's lustre may get lost because of a covering of dirt); this has been
dealt with in the BG elsewhere.

Krishna says there are people who remain bad birth after birth, whom He
refers to as cruel and foolish; these He "hurls" (kShipAmi) into one
demonic and inauspicious birth after another.  Such individuals, having
certainly failed to reach Him, reach the lowest state.  Those are the real
tAmasa-s, not anyone who reforms.

Note and understand the meaning of the adjective, `anecdotal'.  What you
said above does not even make sense.
