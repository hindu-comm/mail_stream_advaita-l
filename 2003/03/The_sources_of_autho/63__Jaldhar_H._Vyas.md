No this was just an example of people who attach different weights to
different parts of the canon.

I'm not discrediting Krishna Bhagawan but neither can I automatically
accept your account of what he taught as there are many conflicting
interpretations of what he said.  You and I may agree that Krishna
Bhagawan is a teacher of Advaita Vedanta but a follower of Ramanuja may
consider him a teacher of vishistadvaita.  A follower of Abhinavagupta may
conider him a Shaiva teacher!  At the very least we should suspend
judgement until we investigate further.

Chaitanya I definitely discredit as a valid authority.  Although he may
have originally taken sannyasa in an Advaitin order, he became a renegade.
Today his followers are the biggest opponents of Advaita Vedanta.

Shankaracharya, I obviously don't discredit.  But I submit to you your
estimate of the reforms he made is wrong.

The Upanishads have the same issue as Krishna Bhagawan. There are
conflicting opinions and to assume they teach Advaita Vedanta while
alright with me is putting the cart before the horse if we are looking a
them in a critical way.

No they have argued for limiting knowledge of the *Vedas* to Dvijas.  But
Vedic knowledge is more than that.  If that is all we are arguing about
then we have no argument.

Well the Ramayana is not part of the Vedas so that example is not relevant
to the question of access to the Vedas.

So then I ask you if the rules of the shastras are only a guideline, why
did Tulsidasji not translate the Vedas themselves into Hindi?  Why didn't
anyone else?  The very reason we are having this conversation is that
there are many people, including myself, who do not see the dictates of
our ancestors (which includes Shruti, Smrti, and Shistachara as mentioned
above) as mere suggestions but a way of life.  Further I argue that this
is the view of the majority and it is those who hold minority view who
have the onusof explaining themselves.

Maybe I didn't understand.

Yes! Precisely.  Historical practice trumps any book.  (consider until
recently the vast majority of Indians have been illiterate.)  When I talk
about my religion I'm not just talking about some theoretical concept but
the actual practices of my ancestors.  To understand caste why do you need
to look in the Gita?  Ask your own Grandfather.  See what his Grandfather
did and his and his and...

I'm not talking about a random man in the street either.  I'm talking
about *every* man on *every* street.  From Kashmir to Kanyakumari from the
21th century BC to the 21st century AD Indians have understood caste to be
based on birth.  If you are reading otherwise from the Gita there are only
two conclusions:

1. Throughout history all Hindus everywhere have misunderstood the Gita.
2. The Gita means something other than you think it does.

I'm sure you'll agree the first choice is simply absurd.

> Okay, fine. I place the burden back on you. Which scholars, acharyas,
> and elders are valid sources of authority and which are not?

My first and foremost guides to Dharma have been my parents and
Grandparents.  Whenever we have some family celebration, the first person
we consult is my Grandmother.  Despite the fact she has never learnt
Sanskrit beyond a few shlokas, by virtue of having seen many such
celebrations and rembering how her grandmother used to do things, she is
an authority.  Next is my Guruji though I've lost contact with him now he
has taken sannyasa.  But he taught me much of my outlook on how to
approach the shastras.  Next is the priest of our local mandir who is
actually a Vaishnava.  But he is very learned and I often ask his advice
on aspects of my studies which are unclear.  Next is the pious members of
my community.  In particular my daughters babysitter who is not a
Brahmana, not an Advaitin and doesn't have much formal education even in
Gujarati but is simply amazing in the way she combines the love of God
with the bustle of daily life.  I consider her and a few others as
authorities in vinaya (conduct.)

Now getting to formal sources.  On a daily basis I use
Shuklayajurvediyabrahmanityakarmasammuchaya of Durgashankar Shastri,
Shuklayajurvediyahnikakarmaprakasha and naimittikakarmaprakasha of
Nathuram Sharma, Dharmasindhu of Kashinath Upadhyaya and Nirnayasindhu of
Kamalakara Bhatta.  These are all compendia of quotes in Sanskrit from
dharmashastras.  For Vedanta I primarily read Shankaracharyas works and
the commentaries thereon, the later Advaita acharyas such as Vachaspati
Mishra, Swami Vidyaranya, Swami Madhusudana Saraswati, etc. Shrividya
authors such as Bhaskararaya and the contemporary heirs to Shankaran
tradition, such as the heads of the Sringeri, Kanchi, Dwarka maths etc.

Well I already answered you on several of these.  My mother is a follower
of Satya Sai Baba, I know many Sai devotees and I've even hosted their
bhajans in my place.  So I am aware of his good qualities.  But I must
say he is absolutely not a reliable guide to Advaita Vedanta.  These
Babajis come from a whole different social and intellectual stratum from
the Sanskrit authors we talk about here.

Ok but so what?  What I'm saying it doesn't have to be written anywhere to
be binding.

What you refer to as "common regional practices" is what I am refering to
as Dharma.  Dharma is not some abstract thing but means specific actions
for specific types of people.

Actually I'm intrigued.  Please do so.  And for each actual caste that
exists not theoretical ones.

Yes, they either are lazy or ignorant or hypocrites.  The Brahmana _ideal_
is a life of teaching and studying.  Of course they often fall short of
the ideal just as Arjuna fell short of the Kshatriya ideal of bravery,
nations sometimes fall short of the ideal of democracy etc.  Such failure
is bad but it doesn't invalidate the ideal.

Is comparable to a Shudra but is not actually a Shudra.  And I don't
believe "low" entered into it.  A shudra who fulfills his Dharma is just
as "high" if not "higher"

Yes absolutely.

But the thing is there is no such community.  This is a matter of
historical record.

Of course!  that's what makes me a Smarta and not a Muslim or a Sikh etc.

Yet it still continues to this day and is accepted by the vast majority.
So either the sages were totally ineffectual in their challenge or you
misunderstand what they are saying.

There is much literature in the Advaita tradition on pramanavada or
epistomology.  The Vedantaparibhasha is one accessible source.  Also
Advaitins take much of their exegetical theory from the Bhatta Mimamsakas
so you can take a look at some of their writings.

There is a vast middle ground between "one true way" and "anything goes."
I acknowledge some diversity of opinion.  In fact I think it is a plus of
our religion.  But just because there are some or even a lot of valid
alternatives, it doesn't mean _every_ alternative is valid.

The transcendental meditation guy? He may have started in the Shankaran
tradition but he broke from it.  His opinion is not valid on the subject
of Advaita Vedanta.  In fact with his "yogic flying" stunts etc. I
consider him a charlatan whose views are good for nothing.

As long as you use the word "seemingly" (which was missing from your
previous post) then I agree with you.  The reason I brought this up was
because there is actually a brand of interpretation that says the true
meaning of the Vedic words (or even speech in general) can only be
fathomed by "Yogic insight."  I wanted to make clear to readers that this
is not the Advaita position.

No.  Historically to make your mark you had to write a Brahmasutra
commentary.  for instance Chaitanya didn't so in the end his 18th century
follower Baladeva Vidyabhushana had to write one for the Gaudiya movement
to be taken seriously by the intellectual public of the day.

Gita commentaries are popular no doubt about it.  Lying on the fault line
between karma and jnana it is a very compelling work.  But did people
write to  "demonstrate their spiritual authority?"  No they didn't.

Agreed.  So from an academic viewpoint you should look at the actual
practice of caste and see how much the Gita is referenced with regard to
it.  I'm willing to bet you will find very little.

Yes certainly.  But only the Gita?  Shankaracharya quotes other sections
of the Mahabharata and Puranas also.  I don't see any sign that the Gita
is given special treatment.  True he wrote a commentary on it but healso
wrote one on Vishnu Sahasranama which is part of the Mahabharata, Lalita
trishati which is part of Brahmanda Purana etc.

Well I apologize if it came across as an insult as that was definitely not
the intention. It's just a statement like "I don't know what weight the
Brahmasutras has in the tradition" is astounding to anyone with more than
a passing aquaintance with Vedantic thought.

And the upanishads are?  Even the Gita has as much relevance as a stotra
then as a philosophical work.  More likely candidates would be the
Siddhantaleshasamgrah of Appaya Dikshita (which is a condensation of the
topics of the Brahmasutras) or the Vedantaparibhasha or the Panchadashi or
some of the prakaranas of Shankaracharya such as Vivekachudamani or
Aparokshanubhuti etc.  Certainly for the advanced student study of the
Brahmasutras is a must.  If this fact is not widely known, something has
gone terribly wrong.  (I think you can guess who I suspect is responsible
for this situation.)

You are right.  And I do invite you to continue the discussion.

Again, I'm sorry if that's how it looks as it was not how I meant it.
But the bottom line is that I think you are wrong on many counts.  And I
think the reason you are wrong is because your views are based on wrong
assumptions and a lack of context.  I'll strive to say this nicely but
there you are.

Yes you are right.

It should be clear by now that I regard this argument as a straw man.
