As an administrator, I would like to request members to refrain from sending attachments to the posts. It's an easy way to transmit viruses, and for a lot of us, like me, I cannot view the attachment anyways from mailing lists as they are automatically filtered out before it gets to my outlook inbox. To actually view it, for people like me, have to come home and try to get to hotmail or yahoo using separate ISP's (sicne a lot of office network prevent access to public mail outfilts like hotmail or yahoo) and then view and read them ...

If at all possible, please send the http links to the relevant web pages please. 

Thanks in advance for your cooperation.
Thanks,
Vaidya.
