Namaste,

apaurusheya: not created by a MANIFESTED being (this excludes devatas
too, including the trinity).

Consider this: Newton's Laws of motion are apaurusheya, and Newton is
the RShi of these laws. If you can understand this you will not encounter
any problem with the concept of apaurusheya.

I agree largely with the above sentiments. Instead of getting bothered about
the exact assignment of caste to individuals and about past societal wrongs,
real or imaginary, we should take into account the impact that modern
technologies have had on human society. Lest we start worrying about whether
translations can be read by anybody or only by a few, may I also draw the
attention of readers to a significant statement by the previous
Sankaracharya of Sringeri? He specifically told an interviewer that printed
editions of Upanishad translations can be read by anyone. And if we pause to
think about it, the original texts in Sanskrit have always been available to
those who have been interested enough to read them and make the translations
in the first place. Except for Dr. S. Radhakrishnan, none of the well-known
translators in the 19th-20th centuries was a Brahmana by birth.
