That is not quite correct. The words that Sankaracharya uses most often are
ISvara and parameSvara, not vishNu, not nArAyaNa, not Siva, not Sankara.

It is only in the gItA commentary that he uses the words nArAyaNa, vishNu
and vAsudeva, but that is understandable, given that the gItA is taught by
Krishna.
