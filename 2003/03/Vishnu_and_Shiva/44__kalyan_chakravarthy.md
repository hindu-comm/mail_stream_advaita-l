Namaskaaram,

The vishnu purana example has been used to ONLY show that I have not quoted
anything from it. Let Iskconites do whatever they want. I am least bothered
about them.

I find lot of similarity with the praajna of the Mandukya Upanishad, but no
similarity with the Turiya. But let me deal first with the more important
argument of yours.

>Firstly, there is no contradiction in saying that
>rudra gained his strength from himself.

1.Such a conclusion being obvious would waste the scriptural statement.
There is no need to look at the scriptures to know the obvious.
2.There is no gaining or losing of anything for brahman.


>In the same way, when the upanishhads say that agni

>ultimate cause of EVERYTHING.

And since Vishnu is the source of rudra, rudra cannot be Brahman. And anyway
as agni is rudra(see the original argument), brahman is also the cause of
rudra.

>3.2 Rudra is truly one; for the knowers of Brahman do
>not admit the existence of a second, He alone rules
>all the worlds by His powers. He dwells as the inner
>Self of every living being...

Once again RV 7.40.5.  I have previously showed why your arguments on this
RV7.40.5 dont stand. Not only that, devi is the source of power for rudra,
as one can see in the Rig Veda itself. To prevent this from contradicting
the shvetasvatara upanishad, - either rudra in this upanshad should not be
the rudra of the Rig veda, or the Brahman is the one that is actually being
praised in the upanishad and not the rudra of rig veda.

In any case, it bears a lot of similarity with praajna and not turiya.

But the shvetashvatara upanishad also says this - That Supreme Self is Agni
(Fire); It is Aditya (Sun); It is Vayu (Wind); It is Chandrama (Moon). That
Self is the luminous stars; It is Hiranyagarbha; It is water; It is Virat.

This should also mean that Agni, Aditya, Vayu etc. must be the Lords of the
Universe.

Thus, it is clear that the rudra here is not the rudra of the rig veda.

For argument's sake, let VishNu not be brahman. If VishNu himself is not
brahman, then rudra cannot be as rudra derives his power from vishNu. Even
otherwise, rudra cannot be brahman as seen from the RV.

Kalyan
