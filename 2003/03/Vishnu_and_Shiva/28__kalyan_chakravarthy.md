I took evidence given not only Srivaishnavaites, but also by Madhvas. As far
as ISKCON is concerned, it need not be taken seriously as it is not based on
vedas or vedanta.

Smriti statements are secondary to the sruti statements. The eg of vishnu
purana was given to show that I have avoided quoting from it as it is smriti
only. Let there be a 1000 statements in the smriti sub-ordinating Vishnu to
Shiva. What I need is a simple and a direct statement from the sruti that
says Vishnu has derived his power from Shiva.(not that which says Vishnu is
equal to Shiva).

>Before we proceed -- how do you identify purushha/nArAyaNa with vishhNu?

Note: I am using sruti only as primary. And I hope you do the same.

1.From the maha upanishad.
2.The Rig Veda praises Vishnu as helping Indra in defeating his enemies.
Again it is the Kena Upanishad, which says that the victory of Gods is
actually the victory of Brahman.(Brahman = Narayana).
3.The very statement that Rudra derives his power from Vishnu(in the
Rig-veda)and the statement made that Narayana is Rudra(just like Tat Tvam
Asi Shevataketu which does not mean shvetaketu is the creator) shows that
Vishnu has greater claim to be Narayana than anyone else. By no means of
imagination can I interpret Tat Tvam Asi to mean that Shvetaketu is creator,
preserver or destroyer. It means that the jiva of Shvetaketu is Brahman in
the stage of moksha.
4.The purusha sukta which calls purusha as having Lakshmi as His consort.
Again the Narayana sukta calls Narayana as purusha.
5.The Katha Upanishad which talks of Vishnu.(here however,Sri Adi Shankara
interprets it as all-pervading)
6.Vishnu is the solar diety. And the Upanishads call the "being" in the sun
as Brahman and more importantly as the Purusha, which as shown earlier is
applicable to Vishnu.
7.Again it is Vishnu who is treated as the sacrifice as his head was cut
off. Dont you see the similarity with the Purusha of the Rig Veda who was
also the sacrifice?
8.And in the Rig Veda itself, in the devi suktam, Devi mentions herself as
having her source of power in the oceans. Who is the being in the oceans? Is
it not Vishnu?
9. And Devi says that she is the power behind Indra and Rudra. No mention of
Vishnu over there. Thus she can be treated as identical to Narayana(she
being the source of power for Rudra) or derived from Narayana. Again, if you
identify this devi with the Uma of the Kena Upanishad, you can call her as
Brahma-Jnana.
10.Again, Devi calls herself as the Queen of the Universe and the giver of
wealth to those who worship Her. This can be taken as a similarity to
Lakshmi.
11. All major schools interpret Vishnu as Narayana.

As I said earlier, let there be a 1000 statements in the smriti which
sub-ordinate Vishnu to Shiva. I need one statement from sruti which says
that Vishnu derived his power from Rudra.

>(The statement in the nArAyaNa suuktam.h that goes as "sa brahma, sa
>shivaH sa hariH sendraH soksharaH parama.ssvaraaT.h" does not include
>"hariH" in the shrI vaishhNava tradition, and they claim that the broken
>chandas is a later addition.)

First of all, I am a smartha only and not a sri-vaishnava or a madhva.
Proof: I am an extreme and a fanatical believer in nirguNa brahman.(neti
neti of the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad, Turiya of the Mandukya Upanishad.)

Now, to the subject. Let Hari and Shiva be treated on an equal footing.
After all saying "Tat Tvam Asi, Shvetaketo" does a similar thing. But by no
means of wild imagination do we say that Shvetaketu is the cause of all
causes.

By saying that Rudra derives his power from Vishnu, it is clear that the
statements that treat Rudra as - equal to Vishnu, most auspicious, the
Supreme among Gods, etc., must be interpreted in the same way in which we
say "Tat Tvam Asi, Shvetaketo".(This is at the stage of moksha only).
Similarly all supremacy goes to the Brahman or Narayana in Shiva.

Please see the above explanation. Also, in the Upanishads, it is mentioned -
In fear of That(Brahman) fire burns. So if fire = rudra as you seem to say,
then rudra must be afraid of Brahman.

The word Gods is not necessarily used to mean Brahman. Brahman is that which
is not understood even by the Gods. Please refer to the Kena Upanishad. In
case your reading is right, then Fire, being Brahman should also be afraid
of Itself, which looks ridiculous.

PS: I repeat once again that this discussion is purely academic and not with
any other motives.

Best Regards
Kalyan
