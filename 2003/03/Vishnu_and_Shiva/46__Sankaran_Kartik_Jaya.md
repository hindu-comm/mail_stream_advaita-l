By the same token, the Veda should also not waste words by repitition,
since there is no need to know something already known. But the Veda
repeatedly points out that Brahman ought to be known.

So we now know that VishhNu is not Brahman, for it is from VishhNu that
Rudra gains his strength, and nothing gains anything from Brahman :-)
