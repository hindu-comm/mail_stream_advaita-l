In addition to that, in bah.hvR^icha upanishhat.h, which is also  from R^ig
veda there is an explicit statement that vishhNu was born/created by devii
(vishhNurajiijanat.h). This work starts with "devii alone existed in the
beginning ...". The verse 2  gives a list, explaining that all beings
that were created by HER and SHE is the power behind all of manifested
universe.
