Namaskaaram,

I DO have objection reading it as rudra gaining strength from himself.

Let it point out. But by no means that is obvious. And also you did not
address the other objection raised by me.

>Rudra gains his strength, and nothing gains anything from Brahman :-)

I think you have just made this statement to inject a sense of humour.
Nowhere is it stated in the sruti that Vishnu gains his power from Rudra.
The other objection that there is no gaining or losing of anything for
Brahman has not even been addressed.

All objections have been answered. The svetasvatara indicates similarity of
rudra with praajna and not turiya. This is not a circular statement.

If the rudra in Sv U is indeed rudra of RV, then it is a contradiction as
the rudra of RV *derives* his power from Vishnu. Also it is devi that is the
source of rudra's power. This is not a circular statement.

There is a new argument that I advance here. Immediately after the rudra
verses, the Sv U also says  -

Higher than this is Brahman, the supreme, the infinite,....

The *this* should rudra only especially if it is the rudra of the rigveda.
There is something higher than this rudra. This interpretation can also
prevents contradiction between RV and SvU. Thus the inner Self and other
words apply to Brahman only and to none else. This is not a circular
statement.

Good, if you find that all arguments are circular, then you are free to
refrain from replying. I never insist on a reply. Anyway, thank you for
taking your time off.

Best Regards
Kalyan

Pranam to all,
In my introduction to Bhagavadgita bhashya, it states:
"It was Shankaracharya who first brought it out into prominence from the vast mass of Mahabharata literature, fixed its contents to the seven hundred verses that now constitute it, and produced the first extant commentary on it. Not only that , he gave it the status of one of the Prasthanas (Foundation Texts), of Vedanta, and the lead he thus gave has been accepted by all succeeding Acharyas of even schools of Vedanta that are opposed to his school."
My question to those in the group have the answer readily available (i.e., I'm not asking for extensive research, even if you point me to a reliable website, it will siffice)... my question is: "What is the comprehensive list of the Prasthanas in Advaita Vedanta?"
Thankfully,
Sanjay
