The reason I gave the various quotes of Shankara on
several PurANaas was because of your statement
"Shankara uses the Vishnu Purana" [sic]. Iskconites
use this kind of half-baked knowledge to portray
Shankara as a Vaishnava!

Gladly!

> 1.From the maha upanishad.

There are several spurious upanishhads that are used
by VaishhNavaas for their propaganda, though I cannot
be sure this is one!

Please see the shvetaashvatara upanishhad:

3.2 Rudra is truly one; for the knowers of Brahman do
not admit the existence of a second, He alone rules
all the worlds by His powers. He dwells as the inner
Self of every living being...

3.3 His eyes are everywhere, His faces everywhere, His
arms everywhere, everywhere His feet. He it is who
endows men with arms, birds with feet and wings and
men likewise with feet. Having produced heaven and
earth, He remains as their nondual manifester.

3.4 He, the omniscient Rudra, the creator of the gods
and the bestower of their powers, the support of the
universe, He who, in the beginning, gave birth to
Hiranyagarbhamay He endow us with clear intellect!

So you have some quotes from maha upanishhad about
vishNu, and I have some from shvetaashvatara about
Shiva. You drive one car and I drive another. Big
deal!

The point that is made above is garbled, and far from
clear.

Saying "Vishnu has greater claim than anyone else..."
is hardly proof that he is indeed nArAyaNa! And it
certainly does not eliminate the possibility that:

nArAyaNa > VishNu, rudra etc.

The conscious Self that is Shvetaketu IS the creator,
preserver and destroyer of the universe. The conscious
Self is the same from Ishvara down to the smallest
insect. The upanishhad is firm on this point.

The purushha suuktam also says that "Hrii" is a
consort of the Purushha. "Hrii" is a bija-akshara of
aadiparaashakti a.k.a paarvatii, the consort of Shiva.
If anything, the purushha-suuktam praises both VishNu
and Shiva as the Purushha. Vidyasankar Sundaresan, one
of the moderators of this list, has explained this
before.

Again, how do you say that nArAyaNa is VishNu?

So?

Read again the shvetaashvatara upanishhad:

3.3 His eyes are everywhere, His faces everywhere, His
arms everywhere, everywhere His feet.

Contrast this with the purushha suuktam which says
very similar things about the purushha.

According the shrI rudram of the yajur veda, rudra is
the deity who is "sarveshvara" -- the Lord of All.

The mahaanaaraayaNa upanishhad says, "Everything is
Rudra, we worship That Rudra."

No.

That still doesn't say VishhNu is supreme/nArAyaNa/...

My point is: what about the statements that say that
rudra is the supreme? Are you going to simply ignore
that?

I think the one and only point you really have going
for you thus far is: RV 7:40:5 that says

(courtesy
http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/rigveda/rv07040.htm)

With offerings I propitiate the branches of this
swift-moving God, the bounteous Visnu. Hence Rudra
gained his Rudra-strength: O Asvins, ye sought the
house that hath celestial viands.

Firstly, there is no contradiction in saying that
rudra gained his strength from himself.

Second possibility: all that is being said is that
rudra gained his strength by sacrifice, but even if it
be by sacrificing to VishhNu, that still doesn't make
him strictly subordinate :-)

It really doesn't matter who one is for the sake of an

By the very statement of fact of the upanishhads, the
conscious being that is shvetaketu IS Brahman, the
cause of all causes, whether the shrI vaishhNavaas
like it or not. No wild imagination is required for
this. If the shrI vaishhNavaas are arguing that they
find shruti "hard to believe", they're like babies
talking nonsense!

When a science textbook says "This system OBEYS the
Poisson equation," it doesn't mean that the system is
sitting below the Poisson equation and awaits an order
from above! It only means that the system's laws are
described by the equation. We also say similarly "The
equation GOVERNS the system," again it is not to be
confused that the equation is the master and the
system the slave.

In the same way, when the upanishhads say that agni
fears Brahman, it only means that Brahman is the
ultimate cause of agni burning, just as IT is the
ultimate cause of EVERYTHING.

Hardly any more ridiculous than saying that "tat tvam
asi" is to be replaced by "atat tvam asi".
