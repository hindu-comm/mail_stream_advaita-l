This is a reply to several points raised in the thread.

You are absolutely right.  to be fair, Kalyan did say his question was
academic rather than practical.  From the point of Advaitic practice such
bickering is totally pointless.

And to address the bit about "return to spirituality", people write about
what they are interested in.  If you aren't interested in the same things
please write about something you are interested in.  (Like some of the
names from the Shivasahasranama and their advaitic purport maybe?)  The
beauty of the internet is there is an unlimited amount of space for
everyone!

This is a very important concept to grasp imo.  Time moves along a wheel.
So while it may seem to be in constant motion, the net effect is of
stillness if you look at the big picture.  Nowadays we are learning more
and more about the cycles of life.  Take for example forest fires.  In a
forest you occasionally have a huge conflagoration that devastates entire
areas.  But paradoxically, this is a good thing.  The fire destroys the
deadwood that strangles new growth and its ashes fertilize the ground
replenishing the source of nourishment.  So a forest fire is not just
destruction but also maintainence and creation.

Interestingly we read that as Shri not Hri.

In an offlist conversation, a list member and I were discussing a Rk where
Surya Bhagawan is called the Gandharva in the waters.

No this is just illustrating the difference between the saguna and nirguna
aspects of Brahman.

I think a case can be made tht Vishnu Bhagawan is given a greater
prominence in the Vedic texts.  In a followup posting, I'll explain why.
