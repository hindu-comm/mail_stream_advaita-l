Namaskaaram,

You answered it. Brahman is nirguNa as such, but saguNa from the point of
view of maya.

There are others. Anandamaya, all pervading, eternal, etc. The best
definition is however neti neti.

The point is not whether Vishnu is brahman or not. It is that rudra cannot
be brahman, Refer to my original post.
