Quite frankly, I find your arguments are circular and self defeating, for
you switch contexts when it suits your thought. Read your own message(s)
again and you will see where.  I am clear on my context. I am not
knowledgeable enough on everything else to devote more time to what appears
to me to be a fictitious argument in the first place. I don't have any thing
more to say on this subject.

bhava shankara desikame sharaNam
Vaidya.
