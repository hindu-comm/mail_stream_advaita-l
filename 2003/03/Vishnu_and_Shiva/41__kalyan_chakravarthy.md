Namaskaaram,

No. It does not. Nor does it show that Vishnu depends on Agni, even if your
logic is accepted.

No, for the logic given by you does not stand.

Otherwise supremacy will have no meaning. If rudra is worshipped as supreme,
then there is no way in which he can be thought of as deriving his strenght
from another entity.

I have explained it here and at many places before. Please read my complete
replies.

Best Regards
Kalyan
