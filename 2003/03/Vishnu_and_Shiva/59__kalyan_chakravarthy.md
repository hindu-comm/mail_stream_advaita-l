Namaskaaram,

Since I have started this useless discussion, let me try to end it. It is
not that any God is less or any God is more. It is rightly said that the
truth is one, and the wise refer It by different names. So, it does not
matter what you call That Brahman. That is Brahma, Vishnu, Shiva, Sakti,
Ganapati. Skanda, Surya etc etc etc. You can even add Allah probably.

I have realized that the most useless thing to do in the world is to look
for evidence as to who is greater. I apologize for wasting the time of many
members. I was just trying to see how far the other traditions are right
when they claim that one God(here Vishnu) is supreme. Personally I felt that
all are same.

I hope this is the end of this topic.

Best Regards
Kalyan
