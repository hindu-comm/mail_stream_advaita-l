Namaste,

1) Much of your argument hinges upon the statement
that praising other gods as supreme is really praising
the Narayana within those other gods. I am curious --
where did this come from?

3) Nirguna Brahman/turiya is completely untouched,
therefore calling it Narayana cannot be correct. Even
calling it "Brahman" or "atman" falls short. May be it
would be more correct to call Narayana and Rudra as
Saguna Brahman? Since they have qualities and are
within the realm of creation, then my previous
argument holds: that Vishnu's function of
sustaining/pervading depends upon a creation from
Brahma and Rudra's function of destruction depends
upon Vishnu's sustaining that creation, and again back
to Brahma after destruction. Hence they are all
inter-dependent and more importantly, the three gods
are really just states of the ONE being -- which IMO,
is what the contradictions in the Vedas hint at. The
contradictions make you contemplate "how can this be
the greatest and that be the greatest at the same
time?" Hopefully out of the contemplation arises the
realization: "A Ha! This IS That!"...which is sort of
a different version of Tat Tvam Asi, but is meant in
the same spirit.

The ONENESS beyond the three is turiya/Nirguna
Brahman. Therefore it isn't possible to equate
Narayana/Vishnu, who is one of the three, as the same.

AUM
Rolando
