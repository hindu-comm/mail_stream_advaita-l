246. The shruti says not this, not this because the upaadhis are
attributes and therefore not real. As you see the snake in a rope and as you
see things in dream  both unreal  therefore practice not this, not this.

247. The upaadhis are not real and so by wise meditations  doing away with
the upaadhis  should be known that things which is common to both.

248. When we say : this man is that same Devadatta whom I have previously
met, we establish a persons identity by disregarding those attributes
superimposed upon him by the circumstances of our former meeting. In just
the same way, when we consider the scriptural teaching that art thou we
must disregard those attributes which have been superimposed upon that and
thou.

266. In the cave of the heart, separate from the manifested and the
unmanifested, the truth exists  Brahman. He who knows Brahman within his
own soul and abides in him, for him theres no entering the body again.
