There was some problem in the prev post. So here goes:


[19:81] And they have taken (for worship) aliiha (gods) besides allaah
(God), that they might give them honour, power and glory.

[46.28] Then why did those whom they had taken for aliiha (gods) besides
allaah (God), as a way of approach (to allaah) not help them? Nay, but they
vanished completely from them (when there came the torment).
