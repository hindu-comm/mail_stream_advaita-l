Namaskaaram,

I have observed that dvaitins say that the "Tat Tvam Asi" is actually the
"Atat Tvam Asi". This looks out of the ordinary because, the whole world
including all the earlier and later commentators(other than Dvaitins) say
that it is "Tat Tvam Asi". Anyway, what is it? Tat Tvam Asi or Atat Tvam
Asi?

I hope some learned Advaitin members in this forum will clarify this point.

Best Regards
Kalyan
