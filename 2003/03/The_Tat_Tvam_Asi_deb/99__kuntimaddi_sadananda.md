kalyan chakravarthy,

Respecting all acharya-s is sign of culture and accepting all achaarya-s
is a sign of confused mind.

One can disagree with a particular philosophy without out disrespecting
individuals.

You are rising some of the dialectical arguments that were raised in the
past and answered in the past too.  There is nothing wrong in
re-churning it for understanding, if that is done with understanding.

There is a book by Vedanta Deshika against advaita Vedanta "Shata
Dhuushani" where similar arguments against advaita were presented and
VishishhTadvaitins claim, including Shreeman S.M.S. Chari (he has
written a book - vishishhTaadvaita-advaita which is the gist of
shataduushani - published by Motilal Banarsidaas).

There are lots of epistemological issues that are debatable and both
vishishhTadvaita and from my understanding dvaita too emphasize the
experience of plurality as reality.  One has to dissect these with clear
scientific understanding to the extent possible before one discusses the
ontological issues that are beyond perception and logic.


Hari OM!
