Hare Krishna

*Sri Rudram* by Swamy Dayananda Saraswati of Arsha Vidya Gurukulam is a
good reference book to start with. (They have the local branch here in
Girinagar, Near Sri Nagar, B.lore)  You can also see the archives for Anand
Hudli prabhuji's english commentary based on Sayanaacharya's sanskrit
commentary.
Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
