Dear Sir

You can find good books in both Sri Ramakrishna Math and also Bharatiya
Vidya Bhavan (book store) for translation and meaning of slokas in Namakam
and Chamakam.

Wish you a happy and blissful chanting !

Warm regards

Umamaheshwar

Pranam to all,



The following is from the introduction to The Brihadaranyaka Upanishad with commentary of Shankaracarya as translated by Swami Madhavananda (Advaita Ashrama). The introduction is written by S. Kuppaswami Shastri, from which the following passage is being quoted. All italics are in the original text. For those who do not have html email, the word greatest is italicized both times in the first sentence for emphasis.



The Brihadaranyaka is the greatest of the Upanishads; and Sri Shankaras Bhashya on this Upanishad is the greatest of his commentaries on the Upanishads. The Brihadaranyaka is the greatest not only in extent; but it is also the greatest in respect of its substance and theme. It is the greatest Upanishad in the sense that the illimitable, all-embracing, absolute, self-luminous, blissful reality, the Brihat or Brahman, identical with Atman, constitutes its theme. And, according to Sri Shankara, it may be said to be the greatest Upanishad also for the reason that it comprehends both the upadesha or revelation of the true nature of the mystic experience of the Brahman-Atman identity and the upapatti or logical explanations of that great doctrine of Advaita through the employment of the dialectic modes of argumentation known as jalpa (arguing constructively as well as destructively for victory) and vada (arguing for truth). Sri Shankaras Brihadarayanyaka-Bhashya is the greatest of his commentaries on the Upanishads in the sense that the great Acarya shows in this Bhashya, in a very telling manner, how the great truth of Brahman-Atman identity forms the main purport of all Vedantic texts in general and this great Upanishad in particular, and maintains by means of his powerful dialectics that the interpretations and views of others are unsound and untenable




As for comments on the dating or timelessness of this (or any other) Upanishad, I'll leave that for those who have such information more readily available to provide their perspectives.
