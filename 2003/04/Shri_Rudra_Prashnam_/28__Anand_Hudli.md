The Sringeri and other maths here in B'lore have many vedic scholars.
The maths also conduct classes in vedic recitation.

Regarding the Rudram, one of the vidvans in R^ig Veda at the Sringeri
Math, Srinivas Atri told me that just one R^ik of the manyu sukta of the
tenth maNDala (10.83 & 10.84) is equivalent to the entire shatarudrIya
of the Yajur veda.

This is the last R^ik in the sukta, with manyustApasa R^ishi, manyu
devatA, jagatI cchandas, and begins with "saMsR^iShTaM ..."
This is useful to know, especially these days when everyone seems to
be in a hurry in such matters.

Pranam to all,

As I have received a few requests on the book I mentioned regarding Shankara and his attitude toward the Bhagavad Gita, I am providing the information below for those who wish to try and order it.

"Sankara and Adhyasa-Bhashya" by S. K. Ramachandra Rao
ISBN: 81-88278-03-3     RS.. 100
Published by:
Abhijnana
8, GIPA Campus,
Bull Temple Road
N.R. Colony
Bangalore 560 019, INDIA
Phone: +91-80-6521414

I was fortunate enough to come across the book at a large bookstore in Bangalore, so I do not know how easy it is to find the book overseas or at online sites.

Also, I do not have the original email (accidentally deleted), but an issue was raised about the following statement I quoted by Prof. Rao: "But [Shankara] does not recognize it as part of the epic, Mahabharata, as it is usually understood." (p. 64 of the aforementioned book).

First, as I am not very well versed in Prof. Rao's scholarship, I cannot even begin to explain all that might have occurred in his mind when coming to this conclusion. Most of the book has numerous references and footnotes; however, this paragraph did not have a footnote explaining the rationale behind this comment. I actually was interested in contacting Prof. Rao to see if he would be willing to contribute some brief explanatory comments on the matter. If others are also interested, I can do so and pass on the comments when I receive them.

Secondly, the chapter is entitled "What did he rely on?", and from Prof. Rao's overall theme and other comments, it is clear that the Bhagavad Gita is strictly speaking a part of the Mahabharata. Afterall, the opening chapter would have little meaning if it were not part of the greater story. There is no dispute on that issue. Again, I will try and ask Prof. Rao to contribute his own explanatory comments, but it does seem that the statement was made within the context of which sources Shankara deemed more authoratative in the Vedanta tradition (hence the title of the chapter). Beyond that, I have not yet found any information to further clarify what he meant by "as it is usually understood." If I come across any further information, I will certainly pass it along.

Please note: I did not provide the information in my email "Old Topics" to prove such a view, but merely to illustrate that such a view is not unknown to scholars.

Om Shanti,
Sanjay
