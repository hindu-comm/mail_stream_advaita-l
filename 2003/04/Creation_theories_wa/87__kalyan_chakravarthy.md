Namaskaaram,

Sri Vidyasankar ji, how is creation to be explained in the context of
Aitareya Upanishad 1.3.12 which seems to be saying that the waking state is
similar to a dream. Elsewhere in his commentary on Br.U, Sri Adi Shankara
says this again. AchArya Gaudapada, in his vaitathya-prakaraNa, repeatedly
compares the waking state to the dream state, though he points out a
difference between them.

Thanks in advance

Best Regards
Kalyan
