The mANDUkya upanishad however says "ayamAtmA brahma"
which is pretty much
the same as "tattvamasi".

I tend to think of creation as Ishvara's "dream" as
opposed to the jIva's
dream, because there seems to be some qualitative
difference between the
external created world and the world "created" in our
dreams (the former
*seems* to be more real for most people). This is of
course just my
feeling.

Namaskaaram,

There are 2 aspects of this problem.

1.Is ayamAtmA brahma of Ma U the same as tattvamasi?

2.Even if the answer to the above question is yes, there is another
problem.If creation is not real then why should it be similar to a dream
alone? There are other unrealities like the proverbial horn of a hare and a
water in a mirage.

As of now, I dont want to touch upon the second aspect, though it is more
interesting. Coming to the first aspect, it is difficult to say whether
ayamAtmA brahma of Ma U is same as tattvamasi. Because the context is
different. The Ma U is primarily an explanation of the aspects of om. But
there are other places where you find ayamAtmA brahma, like in the Br. U
where it occurs atleast twice. And in each case it provides a better context
for its interpretation along the lines of tattvamasi rather than the one
that occurs in the Ma U.

The second aspect, which as I said is undoubtedly more interesting, will be
touched upon later.

Best Regards
Kalyan
