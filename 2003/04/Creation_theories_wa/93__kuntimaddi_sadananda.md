Vidya - I see fallacies in the arguments.

Even the conventional Advaita also says that creation is only name and
form anyway- vaachaarambhanam vikaaro naamadheyam - since the
substantive is only Brahman and attributes have no real existence.
Potness cannot exist without a pot and pot without a potness (if there
is such an attribute!). If potness is not created new then we have
eternal potness that is different from Brahman that violates Advaita.
one cannot also say that there no pot now there since it is perceived
and has a definite utility - mitya with vyavahaara satyam appears to be
more appropriate- If ajAtavAda accounts existence of potness, then there
is jaata of that potness when pot came into existence. One can deny its
absolute existence since it is praagaabhaava or uttaraabhaava or both.
If ajaata vAda cannot account the relative existence then how does it
account the appearances of objects with sajaati, vijaati swagata
bheda-s? I can not see how Shree Goudapaada just ignores vyavahaara
completely.  I can see existence cannot be created but existence as -
pot vs. other forms, which are experiential, can be ruled out completely
without bringing maayavAda - apparent existence with Brahman as
substantive. How can the appearence can be ajaata. Pushing the arguments
to a dialectic level - the very initiation of the theory comes under the
category of jaata since that theory was not eternally existent!

Hari OM!
