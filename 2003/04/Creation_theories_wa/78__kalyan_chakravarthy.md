Namaskaaram,

I have some questions.

1. How can asat mean unmanifested? A better and more direct word would have
been avyakta or probably asambhUti.

2.More over how can sat mean manifestation into name and form? If you take
manifestation into name and form as sat, then saying that in the beginning
sat alone was there would mean that creation was already completed as
creation involves such manifestation.

3.What exactly is meant by unmanifestation or manifestation when there is
only a single entity?

Best regards
Kalyan
