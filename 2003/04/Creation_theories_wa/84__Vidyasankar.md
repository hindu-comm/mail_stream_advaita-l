I did not bring up the word "dream" at all, except in response to your
having invoked it when a different poster referred you to ajAti.

What I am saying is this. It is wrong to think of ajAtivAda in terms of a
dream. That is all, pure and simple. To say that there is no event that can
be called creation is not to say that creation is a dream. The two are
quite different philosophical positions.
