Well, it doesn't. "ajaatasyaiva bhaavasya jaatimichchhanti vaadinaH" In the
case of a pot, the material of the pot was not non-existent before, and will
not be non-existent after. The space enclosed in the pot remains unchanged
throughout. What has happened is that we have given the name "pot" to a
shape, that is all. And although a particular pot may acquire its "potness"
at one instant of time, and lose its "potness" at another instant of time,
the concept of "potness" itself has not been created anew nor destroyed.

Gaudapada has an answer for this too, after mentioning a whole list of
creation ideas - "devasyaishha svabhaavo 'yam aaptakaamasya kaa sp.rhaa"
