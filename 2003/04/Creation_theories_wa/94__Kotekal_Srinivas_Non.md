Namaste,

It seems from the above writing that there are two view points(or satya) in
Advaita; 1.Paramarthika and 2.Vyavaharika.

I have some questions ;

1. How did we (humans) come to know the fact that there are two kinds of
satyas exist in the first place? What pramaNa is there to support this ?

2. Is this concept of "Vyavaharika Satya" real in absolute sense or not ?

Any help is greatly appreciated.

Regards,
Srinivas
