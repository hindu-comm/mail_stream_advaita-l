Namaskaaram,

I have a doubt. If the Atman described is jIva, then referring to the third
state, a state where Self-realization has not yet occured, why does the
upanishad say that it is the lord of all beings etc? We are not experiencing
ourself as the lord of the universe in the third state. Given this, can one
say that Atman here refers to jIva?


Best regards
Kalyan
