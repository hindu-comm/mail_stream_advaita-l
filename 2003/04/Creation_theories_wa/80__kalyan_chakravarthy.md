Namaskaaram,

As far as I know the mANDUkya upanishad, it does not seem to be saying that
creation is a dream though the kArikA speaks about it. But the actual
justification for creation being a dream can come from "tattvamasi".For
since jiva is brahman in the stage of moksha, and brahman is eternally free,
it follows that jiva can become brahman if and only if his suffering and
therefore creation were unreal.


Best Regards
Kalyan
