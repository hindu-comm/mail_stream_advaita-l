Well the way it is stated there it seems to suggest that additional karmas
need not be taken up.  But can the ones already undertaken be given up?  I
thought the reason the tridandi sannyasis keep shikha, yajnopavita etc.
was because they still keep up nitya and naimittika karmas.  Perhaps
Malolan or some other knowlegdeable person can explain?
