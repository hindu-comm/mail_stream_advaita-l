>If one is sick of the world and its endless round of suffering, then by
>all means one should renounce it.  The sannyasi is free of all attachments
>and thus it is legitimate for him to give up those dharmic obligations
>which are based on the idea of attachment.  But by the same token, the
>person who is entangled in worldly actions (as am I.  I take it from your
>name that you are not a sannyasi either.) must follow the dictates of
>Dharma in all things.  No ifs or buts.
