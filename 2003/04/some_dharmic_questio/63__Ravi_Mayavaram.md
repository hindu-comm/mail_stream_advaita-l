If you read the commentary of shankara (see sanjay's quote "Rid of works is
he also who is free from activities like penance, charity, etc., that are
not associated with the sacred fires.") #4 is not interpreted as you do.
niragnir indicates the abandoning of karma that is associated with sacred
fires and akriyaH indicates the abandoning of those that does not use fire,
such as penance etc. Thus both types/aspects of karma is indicated.
Combined performance of these two types is required, which is indicated in
iishavAsyopanishad as well. Just doing one alone will not help.



I saw a similar reading for akriyaH in  a shriivaishhNava bhaashya (which
condenses the views of both raamanjua and vedanta deshika ).

As shankara points out, this verse 6-1 has to be read along with 6-3.
One has no choice but to do karma till one ascends the peak of yoga, as it
aids him. After that it becomes an impediment and not an aid, hence, has to
be abandoned.

My 2c.
