If I understand correctly aatma sakshaatkaaram in VishishhTaadvaita is
different from paramaatma saakshaatkaaram.  It is in fact inferior.
That is not moksha since he is with limited ananda.  Jiiva attains
infinite ananda only when he has paramaatama sakshaat kaaram followed by
paramaatma j~nanam - which is called bhakti ruupaka j~naanam. There is
only videha mukti.  Till then one has to do his veda vihita karma-s -
these include sandhyaavandanam and nitya archana-s  etc.  Even sanyaasi
is not exempt from these.
