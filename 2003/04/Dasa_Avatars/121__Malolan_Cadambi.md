The Devi Bhagavata says that the purAna-s are the heart of Dharma. A heart
expresses both virtue and vice. Rama and Krishna are human avatAram-s of
narAyanA - they display both these qualities. The underscoring point is that
man needts to ultimately live by the dictates of Dharma not krOdha and mOha.
Narayana does not stand accussed and I am not echoing Sir Mortimer Wheeler
here.

I suppose you could come up with a new listing of dasA avatAram-s. Kalyan,
it is very important that we follow the *traditional* list of dasA avatarams
as handed down by our respective achAryas. None of them would get in a new
avataram for the sake of history or social benefit, as evident in other
Indian traditions.
