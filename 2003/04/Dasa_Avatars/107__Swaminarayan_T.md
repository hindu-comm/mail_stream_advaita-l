Not true. Buddha, i.e Siddhartha Gautama (S.G) henceforth, was not included
in the original list. Srimad Bhagavatam mentions that the advent of a Buddha
avatara who was born to Anjana. But SG was born to Maya not Anjana. The
Buddha Avatara of the Bhagavatam came down in order to trick the Asuras into
atheism

On the other hand, it is mainly due to the works of Jayadeva of Gita Govinda
fame that most North Indian traditions and Nepali traditions include
Buddha(S.G) as an avatara of Vishnu. Apart from them, in modern times,
Neo-vedantins like Vivekananda and the Gaudiya-s (ISKCON) inlcude S.G as one
of the Avataras. The VHP and the Sangh include any non-christian,
non-islamic icons as avatara-s. Enough said.

Here is a Sri Vaishnava prespective, which I am sure is endorse by SmArtha-s
and Madhava-s as well:

Balarama and Parashurama are said to be concurrent Avataras. This is
perfectly logical.

There were two sages - Nara and Narayana - who descend down as Arjuna and
Krishna. The dwArapAlaka-s (gate-keepers) of Vishnu in Vaikunta descend down
as HiranyAksha and Hiranyakashipu, who are anhilated by Varaha and
Narasimha, and as Ravana and Kumbhakarna who are anhilated by Rama and as
Shishupala and Dantavaktra who are anhilated by Krishna.
