Every Acharya, be it Shankara, Ramanuja, Madhava, Abhinavashankara consider
Krishna to be the 9th avatAra of Narayana. Siddhartha Gautama (aka Buddha)
is not considered one of the avatAra-s. This identification came during the
11th - 15th centuries in North and Northeast India. One of the reasons was
to foster a unity between Indic religions (Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism)
against a semitic one, which has a recorded history of destruction of both
Buddhist and hindu places of worship.

As I said, SG is not an avatAra of Vishnu. The identification and
popularisation was by Jayadeva and most parts of Uttar Pradesh, Nepal, West
Bengal have a hallowed tradition of a syncretism between both faiths. This
is very unlike what happened in the West, where even a small theological
argument lead to want on destruction.
