Namaskaaram,

Are you serious? nArAyaNa is all-knowing. He gives to people what they
deserve. Now this is getting wierd. Me trying to defend nArAyaNa from a
vaishNava!!!

>Can you accusse Bhishma of Adharma, since he sided with the Kauravas?

Bhisma was bound by his vow. Had he sided with pandavas, it would have been
adharma.

>Krishna, before the war clearly states that one could either have him on

Krishna's case already explained. Krishna knows the future. Let us not
forget it.

As for Balarama, since it required positive efforts on the part of Krishna
to prevent him, we cannot say that he is on the side of dharma.

>These two points:

>*BalarAma avatAram (8th in the list) is not taken by PerumAL Himself

Which means Balarama's case is closed.


PS In case you dont like to accept Buddha, there is a much better candidate
for that avatar. It is Vyasa. You will find the following right in the
beginning portion of the vishNu sahasranAma-----

vyAsAya vishNu rUpAya vyAsa rUpAya vishNave


Best Regards
Kalyan
