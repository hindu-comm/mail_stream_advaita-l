If Buddha hadn't descended and firmly established
Buddhism in India, would there have been a need For
Adi Shankara to rise and establish Advaita Vedanta and
expel Buddhism from India?

IMO, Vedic Dharma is even stronger than ever before as
a result of Buddhism. It seems that in order for the
Vedic Dharma to become stronger, it had to take a few
steps back (Buddha) in order to make a longer, running
jump (Shankara). God descended to break something
down, only to build it back up again in an even more
glorious fashion. Who can really know God's leela?

AUM
Rolando Santos
