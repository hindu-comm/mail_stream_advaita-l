For that matter, the Varaha avataram takes place before the matsyAvataram,
but is listed only after the kUrmAvataram. There are atleast 22 avatAram-s
of the Lord, out of which only 10 are most prominent. Balarama is very much
an incarnation of Vishnu, in the sense that Bhagavan invests his divine
powers in Balarama who is also an incarnation of Adi Sesha.

Like how Lakshmi incarnated as Sita during the ramAvataram and how Adi Sesha
incarnated as lakshmana, without investment of powers from the Lord. The
same way, in KrishnAvataram, the Lord invested more power in Balarama since
it was an agreement between both Adi Sesha and the Lord, that the Lord would
incarnate as Adi Sesha's junior as Krishna and his senior as Rama.

No they are not redundant. None of the achArya-s feel so. I do not think it
would be wise to have one's own logic in understanding the purpose of the
avataram-s without the guidance of an acharya. I am sure you will not argue
about the importance of an acharya.

> Given all this, any claim of avatarhood for Balarama becomes questionable.

Question answered.
