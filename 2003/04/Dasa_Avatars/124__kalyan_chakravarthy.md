Namaskaaram,


>The Devi Bhagavata says that the purAna-s are the heart of Dharma.

Are you asking me to believe the padma purana? :):):)
The puranas are not even proper smriti texts.

You are giving me varied definitions of dharma. Sometime back you said that
chanting janardhana's names is dharma. Now you say that puranas are the
heart of dharma.

Best Regards
Kalyan
