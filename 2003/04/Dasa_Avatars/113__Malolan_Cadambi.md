These two points:

*the manifestation of Aadhisesha. BALARAMA AVATARA was not a _PURNA
AVATARA_, say some scholars.
*BalarAma avatAram (8th in the list) is not taken by PerumAL Himself
directly. BalarAma is an avatAram of AdisEsha only. But, Lord invested more
potencies unto AdisEsha for performing some leelAs as BalarAma.

Kalyan, you are firing an unwanted trajectory. Lets get basics right, I
never implied that all acharyas accept the same position with regard to the
atman and brahman. Irrespective of any position, all achArya-s do not give
any credit to Siddartha Gautama being the Buddha Avatara of Lord Vishnu. I
think there is proof beyond doubt that SG was not an avataram of Vishnu. It
is upto you to belive it or not, I cannot convince the horse to drink water
unless it is thirsty.

Narayana lied to the Asura-s during Mohini avatAram. For that matter,
Krishna, the butter thief is well publicised. Would that still lower the
status of nArAyana? There are many instances in the Ramayana - for example,
when Rama gets very angry after the abduction of Sita and wants to destory
the entire world - thereby displaying krOdha.

Can you accusse Bhishma of Adharma, since he sided with the Kauravas? And
Krishna, before the war clearly states that one could either have him on
their side or his army, in which Balarama was a part of. Duryodhana clearly
chose the army and the Pandavas, Krishna. In the same light as you say
above, can we accusse Kripa, Drona and Karna of adharma?
