Where are you getting this notion?  The puranas contain all sorts of
material on Dharma and Moksha.

The Dharmashastra nibandhas quote extensively from Puranas.

The fact that some parts of them (like e.g. in the Padma Purana) may have
been tampered with doesn't tarnish the authority of the genuine ones.
