If Bhagavata 2.7 is being refered to, there are 24 and they are:

1. Varaha: In the shape of a boar, He rescued the earth which had sunk
below the ocean.

Indra and with His wife Dakshina fathered the Devas called Suyamas.

sage and the founder of Samkhya and Yoga.

founder of
the avadhuta marga and Shrividya.

5. Sanatkumara, Sanaka, Sadananda, and Sanatana.  The mind-born sons of
Brahma.  They refused to take part in Creation and became sannyasis.

21. Krishna and Balarama:  They were born to kill the daitya who had taken

parts and taught them to his students who founded all the shakhas.  He
wrote the Mahabharata and the Puranas.

confused them by teaching them heretical doctrines.
