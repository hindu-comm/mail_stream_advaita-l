Perhaps it is not based on logic :-)

Well the Puranic story is that He was out to confuse the Daityas and
the heretical teachings only 'accidently' leaked out to Humanity.  Of
course this raises as many questions as it answers.

I think the basic problem is that people assume that philosophy flows
'top-down' when in fact ideas bubble up from popular culture and only then
are systemized by philosophers.  They continue to exist at multiple
levels.  In this way it is not inconsistent to say Shakyamuni is highly
venerable yet in many cases quite wrong!

For a contemporary example look at how most people treat sannyasis.  If it
is just a question of saying 'jaya-jaya' and draping garlands on them does
it matter if they wear a tripundra or urdhvapundra or have one danda or
three or none?  But if one were chosing a Guru one would be more careful.

This is the tack taken with ostensibly 'Hindu' heretics too.  In the
Brahmasutras one of the questions is shouldn't the 'Kapilasmrti'
(Samkhya/Yoga) be treated as authoritative as they are also of hoary
antiquity and the product of a highly respected Rshi.  Yet the siddhanta
according to Shankaracharya is that they should not because however
respectable their origins, they are contrary to the teachings of the Vedas
(i.e. Advaita Vedanta.)

If you look at the list I posted from the Bhagavata (and that isn't an
exhaustive list) actually multiple concurrent avatars are common.  Is it
logical?  Are four arms logical?  Are 1000 heads logical?  why not two
bodies?  (or four in the case of Sanatkumars?)

Why does it need to be consistent?

I've not read the whole thing but from the parts of the original -- or
rather uncondensed -- Mahabharata, it is a bit more sympathetic to the
Kauravas then the versions we normally read.  Perhaps Bhagavan did
partially agree with the Kaurava cause.  That's why Kurukshetra was a
Dharmakshetra.

Vyavaharika satya needs no other pramana than the evidence of our own
senses.  Brahman is self-illuminating.  It is like the lamp that is
covered yet some of the light still leaks through.

A better way of thinking about it is as a difference in scale.  How
many pounds in an inch?  The correct answer is you cannot say.  What
Advaita Vedanta is trying to achieve is to shift the scale of our
perceptions to the greatest magnitude possible.
