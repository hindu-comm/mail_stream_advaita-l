I do not agree with this logic. In that case, we should
glorify Shishupala, Ravana etc, because if they hadn't
existed, there wouldn't have been a need for the Rama
and Krishna Avataras. Note that I am not comparing
Buddha to Ravana and Shishupala, but only carrying the
logic to its extreme.

I agree.
