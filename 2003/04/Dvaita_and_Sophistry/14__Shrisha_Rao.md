I don't know off-hand; look it up.  This is also probably off-topic for
this forum.  I am not getting the feeling that a lot of people welcome
lengthy expositions of Dvaita here, and would rather let discussion go
back to normal.  (I have already made more postings in the past few weeks
than in the preceding five years or so.)  If you wish to continue this
discussion in private or elsewhere, I would not mind that.

I will respond to your outstanding messages as of this time, but barring
other interest or responses, will not continue in this thread.

In the sense of not being equal to the first, who is sans pareil.  He
"comes second" in worth, rather than being a copy of the first.

The Upanishad says `me dvitIyaH' -- "my second."  I don't see that there
is much difference.

Everyday usage is but a very poor indicator.  It would be far more
convincing if you could gather up a corpus of evidence of `gachchhanti'
being used in the Vedantic literature (sUtra-s, BG, Upanishads) to denote
temporary transit.
