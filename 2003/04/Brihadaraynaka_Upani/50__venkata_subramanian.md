Dear  all

Mr. sanjay's quotation is fine.   the wonder is .. IT IS TRUE.

one can never miss the Acharya in his full form in this commentary.  i still have seen people reading his arguements to establish that karya and karana are both present before creation.  
his arguement at 0.4.10 is a marvel

putreshanaya..vitheshanaya...etc.  brahmanaha.. 
there the commentary shows what a Real Genius and Personality He is.

thank you sanjay.

regards
venkat

The Brihadaranyaka is the greatest not only in extent; but it is also the greatest in respect of its substance and theme. It is the greatest Upanishad in the sense that the illimitable, all-embracing, absolute, self-luminous, blissful reality, the Brihat or Brahman, identical with Atman, constitutes its theme. And, according to Sri Shankara, it may be said to be the greatest Upanishad also for the reason that it comprehends both the upadesha or revelation of the true nature of the mystic experience of the Brahman-Atman identity and the upapatti or logical explanations of that great doctrine of Advaita through the employment of the dialectic modes of argumentation known as jalpa (arguing constructively as well as destructively for victory) and vada (arguing for truth). Sri Shankaras Brihadarayanyaka-Bhashya is the greatest
>  of his commentaries on the Upanishads in the sense that the great Acarya shows in this Bhashya, in a very telling manner, how the great truth of Brahman-Atman identity forms the main purport of all Vedantic texts in general and this great Upanishad in particular, and maintains by means of his powerful dialectics that the interpretations and views of others are unsound and untenable
