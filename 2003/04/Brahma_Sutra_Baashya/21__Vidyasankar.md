Well, if we have to get technical about the application of these terms to
Saiva traditions, then yes, it is Saiva Visishtadvaita, which Appayya
Dikshita reinterprets in an Advaitic flavour.

On the other hand, Saiva Siddhanta proper is not Visishtadvaitic in nature,
but more like dvaita. It posits the eternal existence of three separate
realities, pati (Siva), paSu (jIva-s) and pASa (bondage of jIva-s, i.e.
comparable to mAyA/prakRti). And it does not say that pati has paSu and
pASa as attributes, unlike Ramanuja who says that Brahman has cit and acit
as attributes. Rather, pati is quite unconnected and separate.
