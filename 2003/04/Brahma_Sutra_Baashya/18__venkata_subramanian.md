dear sir

as far as i have heard, Sri Kanta Acharya and Appaiya Dikshita
both were Saivas.,.but DID NOT BELONG TO THE Saiva Sidhanta that
started in Tamil Nadu specially by sri maikanta sivam etc.

they both were Sivaadvaitins.... advaita in shivism,  which the
Saiva Sidhanta School in Tamil nadu DOES NOT ACCEPT.
Saiva sidhanta of Tamil nadu is SHAIVA VISISHTADVAITINS .

regards,
venkat.
