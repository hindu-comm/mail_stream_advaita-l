Namaskaaram,

Just a thought. Asat could be the non-causal state(?) of brahman. Sat could
the causal state(?). Logically it is OK to say that the non-causal state
comes before the causal state. If the nAsadIya of RV is added further, then
we conclude that nirguNa brahman which is neither the causal nor the
non-causal state(?) was "there" before asat and sat.

But that lands us into a problem. If asat is the non-causal state, how did
it cause sat? To avoid this we can say that asat is the non-causal state as
far as creation is concerned while sat is the cause of creation. We are
looking at things from the point of view of creation.

This need not be the correct interpretation.

Best Regards
Kalyan
