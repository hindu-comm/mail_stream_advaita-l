Namaste Kalyan,

How are you interpreting mAyA in relation to the early
hymns?

Although ultimately the question as to the cause of
creation is a non-question it is one we are correct to
pose. We can have no better guide than the Kena
Upanishad to help but that is a later thought as we
know.

By the way, I am not writing because I have any
answers but because I share your interest in these
questions,

Best wishes
