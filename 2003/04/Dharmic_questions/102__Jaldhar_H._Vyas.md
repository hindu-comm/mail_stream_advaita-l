The Swamijis heart is obviously in the right place but his defence is
(IMO) lacking.  He is trying to have it both ways.  He wants to tell
modern people "yes I know these things are obsolete but tolerate them anyway."
and he wants to tell the traditionalists "One can still respect these
things even while ignoring them."  Such an outlook would reduce its followers
to keepers of a dusty museum, not participants in a vital and spiritual
faith.

To me, the key is in his first observation that it is what kind of a man
one is that counts.  Dharmic obligations are represented as a threefold
debt: to the Devas, to the Pitrs, and to the Rshis.  What kind of a man
reneges on his debts?  Not the kind whose character we would admire.  The
Dharmic man does not do his duty grudgingly or out of duress but with the
joy of knowing he is doing the right thing.  And when he does renounce
duty, it is done in the full knowledge that there is not one being
mortal or divine who he has failed to repay.

You are right the name in itself cannot determine renunciation but it is a
big clue don't you think?  From birth to school to work to marriage to
death it is a name by which a person and his deeds are known is it not?
This is why we have the custom of taking a different name at sannyasa. It
is a punarjanma.

Thanks for posting the Gita extract.  I've written more on the subject in
a seperate post. (And btw Krishna Warriers translation to English appears
to have lost some nuances in the process.  A. Mahadeva Shastris' is better
IMO.)
