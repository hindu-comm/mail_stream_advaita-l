Namaskaaram,

Actually this is happening because many of the swamijis want to market
vedanta to a western/westernized audience. But I feel, why bother about the
west? If they(westerners) want to love/hate/learn vedanta that is their
problem. Why should anyone try to market vedanta in the west?

Best Regards
Kalyan
