Namaskaaram,

Many a time I have heard that the brihadaranyka upanishad is the greatest of
the upanishads? Is this right? If yes, then great in what sense? Size or
content or both? Though the traditional schools say that vedas are eternal,
some people consider the brihadaranyaka upanishad as oldest. How far is this
true from a neutral point of view?

It is generally accepted that the comprehensive Advaita philosophy started
with Sri Adi Shankara. But if one considers the fact that the brihadaranyaka
upanishad is much older and contains many direct and explicit non-dualistic
statements, can it be said that Advaita traces its origin to the days of the
brihadaranyaka upanishad?(In case it is accepted that this upanishad is the
oldest and was written/emerged at a certain point of time in history).

Best Regards
Kalyan
