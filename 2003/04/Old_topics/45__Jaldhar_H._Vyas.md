I had hoped it was crystal clear but evidently you are still confused
about what I said and didn't say.  I am not doubting the popularity of the
Gita.  I am not saying it isn't an important Vedantic text.  What I
emphatically _am_ saying is that those shlokas dealing with caste have
zero bearing on the issue.

No it is not obvious at all.  Shankaracharya is talking about jnana.  So
of course he quotes the parts relevant to jnana.  What does Prof. Rao
expect him to quote, texts on table tennis?  When the occasion to talk
about karma comes, he doesn't quote the upanishads but the texts relevant
to the subject like the Mimamsa sutras in the discussion on smrti below.
Furthermore he doesn't hesitate to use Vedantic statements found elsewhere
in the Shruti where appropriate i.e. in the bhashya on Ishopanishad 2.
where the Taittireya Aranyaka is quoted.

An important source yes, but not one of singular importance.

I wonder how Prof. Rao came to such a strange conclusion?  In the
introduction to his Gitabhashya, Shankaracharya says the Gita is

vedavyAsah sarvajno bhagavAn gItAkhyaih saptabhih shlokashataih
upanibandhah |

Now true he doesn't explicitly say that same Veda Vyas is the author of
the Mahabharata but why should he need to spell out a fact known to even
little children?  The works and authors that consider the Gita to be part
of the Bhishmaparva of the Mahabharata are too numerous to count.  The
onus is on Prof. Rao to defend such an odd surmise.

Then how do you explain Shankaracharya also wrote a prakarana called
sarvavedantasarasangrah?  This is poetic hyperbole that's all.

You can find similiar passages at the end of the Shivamahimnastotra,
Chandipath and many other places.  It is called phalashruti and it is a
kind of advertising if you will.  Remember shankaracharya also commented
on the Vishnusahasranama, Anugita and Sanatasujatiyam from the
Mahabharata.  He also quotes from the Mokshadharma, Shantiparva and
Striparva in the course of the Gitabhashya.

Again you are reading the words but completely missing their point.  This
is a rejoinder against those who say the Kapilasmrti (i.e. Samkhya/Yoga)
should be considered authoritative because it is also the work of an
ancient sage of legendary renown.  The siddhanta is no because
Samkhya/Yoga teachings (i.e. pradhana as the cause) contradict Vedic
statements that Brahman is the cause.

I didn't respond to that message but I did repeatedly tell you that your
foolish fundamentalist insistence on a fixed canon is methodologically
bogus.  There are far more than 108 works which go by the name upanishad.
Which are real and which are late forgeries?  Just because
"Allahopanishad" suggests you should visit Mecca does that mean Navaratri
etc. are suddenly invalid?  To determine "genuineness" (a contentious
idea) we should look at history.  The "big ten" upanishads are undoubtedly
real because every single acharya has commented on them.  There are
several others which have been atleast mentioned by multiple people.  Now
I ask you to use some common sense.  If this Vajrasuchika (it's name alone
should cause you to suspect something) is real part of the revered Shruti
and moreover is the "smoking gun" about the caste system, how do you
explain the total pindrop silence about it in the literary tradition?  The
fact is the only reason anyone knows anything about it is because
Radhakrishnan put it in his book.

No, only that he was a liar.

And what was the upshot?  That same Ashvatthama slaughtered all the
children of the Pandavas.  Only Parikshit was saved by the grace of
Krishna Bhagavan.  You should read the Mahabharata sometime.  It delves
deeply into moral dilemnas and their consequences.

Thus we see the terrible fruits of karma.  Evil deeds beget more evil
deeds.  This is why the shastras say (a motto adoped by the Republic of
India) that in the end only truth prevails.

Many of the people I've met through my mothers Sai Baba group are Sindhis
and I've heard some harrowing tales of those times.  (Though they don't
seem to have felt the need to change names.)

And yes we should pass judgement.  Right now a war is going on between
the US and Iraq.  It is particularly in the chaos of war that you should
think deeply about your own actions and the actions of others.  Why do you
think Bhagavan chose to instruct Arjuna on the battlefield?

Well what about now? What calamity are you in now as a doctor in
prosperous, independent India?

You brought it up not me.  Why is it mudslinging if it causes people to
doubt his reliability?

I've met hundreds of his followers (and Shirdi Sai Babas') including some
people who knew him before you were born.  How fortunate I've now come
across the only person who really understands his teachings.  Today must
be my lucky day :-)

Feel free to assert as much as you like.  Conclusions come from facts.

The bhashya on 4.1.15 says nothing of the sort.  But I'll leave it to you
to find out what it actually does say.

Hear hear.  And let doctors drop all that medical mumbo-jumbo and talk
only in words a simpleton can understand.  And if I choose to say that
cancer is caused by constipation then they should share my perspective and
not judge it as right or wrong.  (Because if they try and correct me it is
only because they are puffed up with pride in their shiny stethoscopes and
diplomas.)  I  have watched many medical dramas on TV so I am their equal
in every way.
