treatises (dharma-shastras like the one by Manu). His reliance on them,

Sri Ramachandra Rao is a great scholar, but I am puzzled by his last
sentence, and prima facie, I'd disagree with it. Does he elaborate on what
he means by "usually understood"?

The introduction to the Gita commentary clearly describes it as having been
set into 700-odd verses by Vedavyasa, capturing what was taught by Krishna,
son of Vasudeva and Devaki, to Arjuna, the Pandava. This squarely situates
the Gita within the context of the Mahabharata. Moreover, Sankaracarya
often quotes from other books of Mahabharata, including Santiparvan,
Asvamedhaparvan and Anushasanaparvan, both in the Gita commentary and in
the Brahmasutra commentary. And at the end of the Gita commentary, when the
dialogue between Krishna and Arjuna ends and the narrative returns to
Sanjaya, he says, "kathA-sambandha-pradarSanArthaM" (i.e., to return to the
story). Clearly, Sankaracarya is himself quite conscious that textually
speaking, the Gita is part of the epic.

Best regards,
Vidyasankar
