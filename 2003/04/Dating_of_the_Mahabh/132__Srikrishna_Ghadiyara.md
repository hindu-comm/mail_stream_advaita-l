Hari Om !!

Based on a recent post from Sri B. Shankar and his
reference of the article by Sri K.V. Venkataramana
Aiyer
(September
1991 Star Teller magazine):
" All my
efforts ending in failure, I was about to give up my
research in
despair on
the eve of a Janmashtami Day in absolute
self-surrender to Him. When I
was
in that prayerful mood, a wonderful horoscope not
hitherto available
flashed before my mind. I immediately pressed all my
astronomical
knowledge
to find out the horoscope. Lo!, my joy knew no bounds
to find the exact
horoscope 44778 days before Gatha Kali in 3224 BCE i.e
125 Lunar (not
solar
years) before Kali Yuga."

where as Sri Sadananda's referred article says "Sri
Krishna's Birth - He was born on 3112B.C. on Friday at
11:40 PM."

These two dates do not seem to match.

Would someone have comments.

Om Namo Narayanaya !!

If I may add a comment,

In vishva (waking) and taijasa (dream) states our biological systems are
failure driven. That is the reason why we get tired after being awake all
day and sleep for 8 hours. If these states were full of happiness they would
have surely lasted for ever.

When a failure is experienced in waking or dream states, we go back to
prajna for help, and after receiving help from prajna we return to our daily
life. This process happens so fast, we never notice it. We think of
ourselves as super heros for resolving the problem, whereas the credit
really goes to prajna. Prajna is awake for the whole life time of the
organism from birth to death and never sleeps. Even though prajna is called
deep-sleep state, prajna itself never sleeps! Prajna is awake even in waking
and dream states and supports these states in their failures every fraction
of a second. In deep sleep prajna is in full control of the body and organs.

The reason why deep-sleep state is lord of all is this:

vishva and taijasa states are limited, so my vishva is different from your
vishva, and my taijasa is different from your taijasa.

But deep-sleep state of one person is no different from that of another
person. As no person or living being can be in any state higher than
deep-sleep state, and no situation in life is beyond the reach of prajna,
and prajna can recover a failed system from any state of turmoil, deep-sleep
state is logically the lord of all beings.

>>Given this, can one say that Atman here refers to jIva?

If jIva means something limited, then prajna is unlimited and equated to
paramAtma. Prajna is the lord of all beings, also because the state of any
being in waking or dream states is included in the prjna state.

Best regards
Bhadraiah
