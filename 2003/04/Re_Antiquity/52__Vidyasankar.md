The way out of the confusion is to conclude either that 509 BCE is a wrong
date for Sankaracharya, or that 5th century BCE is wrong for Buddha's date.
Which alternative you choose depends on logic, according to me, but I have
found that for most people, their choice goes according to personal
preferences and not logic.
