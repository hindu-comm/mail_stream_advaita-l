Yet, 1300 years after Buddha's time, Sri Adi Sankara was able to do the same
(make people come out of ritualism) *without rejecting the vedas*. Remember
that Sankaracharya's main opponents were the ritualists, just as in Buddha's
time. I find it hard to believe that Buddha was an avatara of Bhagavan.
