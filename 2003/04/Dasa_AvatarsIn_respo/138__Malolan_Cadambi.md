Yudhisthira asks Bhishma in the Vishnu SahasranAma "kO dharma sarva
dharmAnam bhavatah paramO mataha"; "Kim japam muchyater jantu...."

Which is the highest Dharma of all, by chanting whose name will the
jiivatma-s attain mokshA? Bhishma replies that chanting the thousand names
of janardhana who is the jagatprabhu is the means to the higher end.

> And please tell me in what way did Buddha commit adharma?

Simply put: He rejected the vedA-s, which are the source of Dharma. But one
must cognize the fact that there was no violence against Buddhism and other
nAsthika faiths as compared to the west.
