I have become interested in eastern philosophy and would like to learn
more. I understand it is more than a philosophy as understood in the
western sense. Advaita-vedanta is a challenging system and by joining this
group I hope to enhance my understanding from the traditional perspective.
I would appreciate if you could also recommend a reading list for a
beginner.

Regards,
Tahir
