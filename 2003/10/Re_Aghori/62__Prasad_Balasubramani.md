namasthe,

The following are interesting sites having articles on Aghoris.
One site mentions that Ramakrishna Paramahamsa had been 
influenzed by Kena Ram, an Aghori.

It as well looks like Hartwick University/college in NY state has
a Video cassette with the title -  Aghoris, Living with The Dead.

I just got all these info by googling on Aghoris. 

Just thought of sharing all the info that I come across with all the Bhathas.

Prasad
