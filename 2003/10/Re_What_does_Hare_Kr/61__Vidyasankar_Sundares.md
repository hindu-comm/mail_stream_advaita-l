Obviously, one should not take it so literally. It is not as if Vyasa and 
Valmiki were wasting their time and ours by composing Ramayana and 
Mahabharata. Also, one should remember that different methods are taught for 
different levels. If I tell a seven year old student to learn only basic 
arithmetic and that calculus is unnecessary, this does not hold true 
throughout the lifetime of that person. That student has to graduate to a 
stage where he or she can understand calculus. Similarly, mantra chanting of 
any form (not just the Hare Krishna mantra) helps one regulate the mind as 
one of the preparatory stages towards moksha. Also note that what Sri 
Prabhupada means by moksha is not the same as what our older Vedantic 
tradition describes as moksha.
