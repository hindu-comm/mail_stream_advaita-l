This is significant. Because in the present day there are too many gurus saying too many things and sometimes the same guru says things which are completely inconsistent. Given this, I would appreciate it if the scholars in this list focus on removing the wrong notions that circulate currently. Can the scholars in this list please tell us the correct methods prescribed by our shAstra-s?
