I would replace "VasanA" with "Karma". We can see a definite corelation
between Karma and experience:

good Karma --> good experience
bad Karma --> bad experience

I think this is veering away from the true call of the Vedanta. Trying
to "create a world free of evil" is a far cry from what Shankara
teaches. To quote H.H. Chandrashekhara Bharati, "If there are good
times, they are sure to be replaced by bad times. If there are bad
times, they are sure to be replaced by good times." And HH then advises
detachment from both good as well as bad times. 

The Bhagavad Gita calls what you would advocate "rAjasIka Karma", Karma
performed for the sake of a certain result, and asks us to avoid it.

Arise and Awake from Karma itself (which includes both good as well as
bad Karma), not merely "bad Karma" alone. 

"Arise, Awake and Stop not till the slightest attachment to Action is
destroyed!"
