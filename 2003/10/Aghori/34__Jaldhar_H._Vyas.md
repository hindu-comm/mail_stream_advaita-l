Aghora means terrible and the Aghori panth is a tantric sect found in UP,
Rajasthan and such areas.  During medieval times they were quite
influential but are in decline now.

Our Acharyas have condemned them as their practices are contrary to Vedic
morality.  (Hence the name terrible I suppose.)

Omkara is also called aghora mantra but I don't think it has any
connection with these Aghoris.
