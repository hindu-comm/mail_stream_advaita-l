Friends
 If you see 
www.ambaa.org/download/namavali.txt
you will notice that already there are 820 names. Further names are coming up, particularly from the stalwarts to whose massive contribution we owe this much success. I will however like to plead with those who have not contributed at all, to contribute five entries each, so that the resulting sahsra-nAmAvaLi will have a still wider distribution, when it is finally put up as the first devi sahasra-nAmAvali on the internet in English. You may mail me your compositions of five names-cum-prayers.  Preferably, within the next 36 hours!

With pranAms to all devotees of Mother Goddess
