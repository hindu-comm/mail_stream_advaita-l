For achieving the ultimate, which is very much 
possible only if one has this body, one should take 
care of the body so that one uses the time efficiently 
(to attain the ultimate). For which,  the sanjeevinis 
of today like aspirin and others could be considered 
very much necessary. But, when it  comes to Sanjeevini 
krithya, the question comes up probably  because we've 
not  heard about people coming back alive after death. 
It just sounds unusual! 

If we can consider normal death as one's fate and suicide as  one's freewill, both cases have their  own ways of carrying forward whatever has to happen. When 
this is the case, how can one's using this krithya  at 
any one be justified ?
