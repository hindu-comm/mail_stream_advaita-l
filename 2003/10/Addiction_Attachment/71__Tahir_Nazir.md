What is the difference between addiction and attachment? Can a realized 
being have addictions? Suppose some one is a smoker and that person is 
also a disciple of the way. If that person becomes liberated in this 
lifetime, what becomes of his addiction to smoking? Is he still attached 
to smoking?

Regards,
Tahir
