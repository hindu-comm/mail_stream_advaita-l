Hari Om,

I hereby affirm that I have read your list of rules for the postings and
that I shall abide by them.

I have been interested in Vedanta for the last 5 years. Initially I got
interested after a meditation course (conducted by the Art of Living
foundation of Shri Shri Ravishankar) that I took when I was a final year
student in college. Subsequently I have been increasingly more involved
with
the gnanaa part. Over the course of the last 4 years I have learnt the
Katha, Taittiriya & Ishavashya Upanishad from Swamini Satyavratananda
saraswati (she teaches in chennai, and is a disciple of Swami Dayananda
Saraswati). When I did not have access to a Guru nearby after I came to
the
US I have tried to learn  Kena and Mandukya Upanishad (and still in the
process of learning the Gaudapada Karika), Bhavad Gita, Ashtavakra Gita
and
other similar works through self-study with the commentaries of Swami
Chinmayananda.

I am a member of the weekly Chinmaya mission vedanta discussion group
for
Raleigh-Durham-Chapel Hill (triangle) region. I also teach Balavihar
classes
on Sunday mornings to children in age group 9-13, and am running their
web
site for the next year or so as well.

After looking through your archive I believe that participation in you
group
will help me further clarify my concepts and questions on Vedanta. I
look
forward to active discussions in this e-satsang group.

Jai Gurudev,

Balaji Krishnapuram
