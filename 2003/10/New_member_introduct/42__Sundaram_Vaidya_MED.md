To Advaita-l mailing list,

Well, I live in São Paulo/ Brazil  and I study at USP ( São Paulo
University) . My heart's philosophy is the Advaita because I have learn
the Bhagavad Gita based on the Sankaracarya Commentary (bhasya) and it
was the start of my spiritual path. After this, I read several
Prakaranagranthas, some upanishads and other bramanic works. Because of
that I want to be part of your List.

Thank you for your atention. 

Ps: I have read the list policies and I accept these

 (Ma) Marcelo D. B. R.
