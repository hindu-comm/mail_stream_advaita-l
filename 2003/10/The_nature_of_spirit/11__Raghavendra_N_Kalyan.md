Some thoughts from my side on the views being discussed under this topic.

If an objection is made by saying that consciousness is neither an essential nor an inherent attribute of the body, but relational in the sense that it arises from interaction between matter and matter, then the reply is that it is not so, for such a thing is not supported by perception. In other words, this view is being rejected in the same way as a rationalist would reject the existence of ghosts. The difference is that the rejection in this case has a much more stronger basis, as interactions between matter are completely within the range of perception, thereby validating the objection, while in the case of the rationalist, the alleged ghosts are not within the range of perception.

A few more words.

While most of religion and God is based on belief, advaita is not a religion, nor is brahman a God in the strict sense of the terms. Belief without a basis becomes indistinguishable from superstition which vedAnta is definitely not.

While it might sound to be a good idea to publish Sankara's reasoning techniques in a journal, let is not be forgotten that vedAnta is not for materialistic ends. Sri Sankara, has never asked for any patent rights over his work. Nor did he ask for any money from his disciples. He has given us the gem of advaita in his infinite compassion. Let us not abuse it. The fundamental feature of Indian philosophy is that it has its goal as realization. It would be better to remember that always.
