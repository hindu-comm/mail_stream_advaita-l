Quite correct, this is a large portion of Shankara's argument. For if
consciousness were an essential attribute, the body should always be
conscious. But that would include dead bodies, which is absurd. If
consciousness were an accidental attribute, the attribute is not
strictly always associated with the body and so can be found
independent of the body also. 

There is yet another reason which I will explain when I type out the
entire argument.

There is a method of proof known as "Reductio ad Absurdum" according to
which one makes an assumption and proves that it leads to a
contradiction, thereby implying that the assumption is false.
