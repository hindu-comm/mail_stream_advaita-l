Dear Kiran,

There is no denying that there are physical symptoms of realization, but 
they are merely symptoms, the ultimate cause of all those symptoms is 
yourself. When you walk you leave foot prints. But don't want walk with the 
intention of creating foot prints; creating foot prints is not your aim. You 
also don't walk with foot prints because it is not your means either. When 
the sun rises or sets you may see auroras in the sky, but the auroras are 
neither the aim or means of the sun, just an effect.

Regards
Bhadraiah
