Dear Kiran

Yes you are right. A human being, or for that matter any living being, is 
like an $800,000 Ferrari that comes fully loaded with a portion of every one 
of the devas. These devas do their own things and generate their own 
symptoms, and to that extent we are not the cause of these symptoms.

The aham (self-concept) is on the drivers seat, or at least so do we think. 
But if we think we are the boss and neglect the engine, it crash lands 
somewhere. These are the symptoms for which our own aham is the cause.

But, if we realize the divine components within and let them do what they 
want to do, then they get their own liberation, we gets ours.

A point to remember is, the distinction between use and misuse is very 
subtle. Letting the devas do what they want after realizing their true 
nature is the correct thing to do. But letting the system do what it feels 
like without the underlying knowledge is like driving recklessly, turning or 
speeding when you feel like.

But then a symptom is still a symptom. Working on symptoms is good, if we 
use them to understand the divine components we are made of. But going after 
symptoms just because they look interesting is like driving through rear 
view mirror without looking ahead.

Best wishes
Bhadraiah
