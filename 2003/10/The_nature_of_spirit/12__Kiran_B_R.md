Dear Bhadraiah,

It is one thing to think that the ultimate cause of
all symptoms of realization is myself.

It is another to think that the ultimate cause of all
symptoms of realization is not-myself.

It is another to think that the ultimate cause of all
symptoms of realization is a combination of myself and
not-myself.

It is yet another thing to think that the ultimate
cause of all symptoms of realization is neither myself
nor not-myself.

But thoughts, mesmerising as they may be, cannot
circumscribe the un-circumscribable.

Cheers
Kiran
