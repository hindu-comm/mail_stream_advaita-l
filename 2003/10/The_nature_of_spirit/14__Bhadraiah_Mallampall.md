Remember the endless discussions snake and rope in advaita. Every symptom 
that we see, of realization or the lack of it, is like a snake. We need to 
study every symptom to guess the rope that caused the symptom in the first 
place. Enjoying the symptoms is optional, but doesn't add to our knowledge.

Best wishes,
Bhadraiah
