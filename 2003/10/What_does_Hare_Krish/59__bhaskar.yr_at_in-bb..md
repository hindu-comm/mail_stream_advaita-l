It is only the names Hari and Krishna in various combinations.  There is
no shastraic basis for it and it was probably invented by the 15th century
Bengali saint Chaitanya.

praNAm prabhuji
Hare Krishna

Hare krishna mahAmaNtra is in kalishantarana up.  But in this up. 'Hare
Rama' name comes first.  ISKCON prabhus chant this mantra in reverse order
i.e. first Hare Krishna & then Hare Rama & also they have their own
explanation for this reverse order of chanting.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
