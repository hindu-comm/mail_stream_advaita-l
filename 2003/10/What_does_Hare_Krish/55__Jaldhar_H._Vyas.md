Those who have fallen into the terrible depths [of samsara] can even at
the time of death be released by taking the name which is feared by Fear
Himself.

1.  Nothing in this shloka says anything about taking the name
   unconsciously. In fact 'taking' need not necessarily refer to chanting.

2.  Needless to say no mantra in particular is 'the' name.  While it is
   obvious from the context that it is the name of Vishnu which is being
   refered too, there is no reason why it exclusively has to be Krshna and
   not Vasudeva or Narasimha or any other.

3. 'released' may refer to release from rebirth which is not the final
   liberation in Advaita Vedanta.  We also believe in krama mukti in which
   a soul is free of a body but continues gaining jnana in a higher world
   like Vaikuntha until the final complete mukti.  This shloka is open
   to interpretation either way.
