The word "vivashaH" can mean, according to Apte's Sanskrit Dictionary,
"helpless" or "uncontrolled" or "dead". Or as I read in another place,
"a state of swooning". The words "sadyo vimuchyeta" speaks directly of
"immediate liberation". 

But that's not the only verse, there are umpteen more, I just searched
again (in ISKCON, no less) and found other verses, maybe you can help
with the Sanskrit original on these also:

http://www.srimadbhagavatam.org/canto6/chapter2.html
Knowingly or unknowingly chanting the name of the One praised in the
verses is that which, like fire does with dry grass, burns to ashes the
sins of a person. (6.2.18)

http://www.srimadbhagavatam.org/canto5/chapter25.html
Any person in distress who accidentally heard of, or whatever fallen
soul who just for fun could chant or repeat His name, will instantly
see the endless sinful of human association vanquished; of whom else
but Lord Ananta Sesa should any seeker of salvation take shelter?
(BhAgavatam 5.25.11)
