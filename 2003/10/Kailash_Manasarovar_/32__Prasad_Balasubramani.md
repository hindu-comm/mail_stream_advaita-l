namasthe All,

 There is a VCD - "Kailash Manasarovar Yatra" 
available for sale in Ramakrishna Mutt. Its 
actually the video of the trip made by Chennai 
Ramakrishna Mutt devotees to Mount Kailash 
and Manasarovar Lake.

 I was fortunate to get a copy for myself and 
watch it. Its very good. The background music 
is by Smt. Vani Jayaram and the commentary is 
by the renowned singer Sanjay Subramanian. 
It costs Rs.200 and is availble with English 
Commentary version or Tamil.

 I felt that I'd spread the word to all the 
devotees as its something everyone must watch. 
Ramakrishna Mutt's site also has this CD 
for sale online.

 The CD also gives information about whom to 
contact for those who are interested in 
making a trip to Manasarovar and Mount Kailash. 

 Enjoy!!! 

namasthe
Prasad
