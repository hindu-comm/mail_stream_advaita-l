Vyas mahOdayaH, namaskAraH.

shuBha dIpAvai to all of you too.

You noted the Vikrama era's new year name as manmatha (29th in the list 
of 60). Per tradition in down south (karnAtaka, kErala, tamilnAdu, 
AnDhra), samvatsara begins on chaitra shukla praThama, and this 
tradition notes the current year name as suBhAnu (17th in the list of 
60). I was aware of the two traditions with different points (chaitra 
shukla praThama and kArtika shukla praThama) as the New Year Day in the 
annual cycle, but did not know that the samvatsara names too differ.

DhanyavAdaH,
Cheers & namastE,
-Shambhu
