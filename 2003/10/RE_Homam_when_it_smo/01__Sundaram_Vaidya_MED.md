Yes. All offerings in the fire should be fully digested. One must take
care that the fire is not extinguished after the homan is done when
there are undigested offerings. It is common practice to cover all
offerings in the fire with dried cow dung cakes in India for this
reason. In the US, I have seen the priests pack regular fire logs or
wood chips as substitutes ... the point is that the offering should be
fully digested. 

The general idea here is that the agni is the courier taking our
offering to the deva loka as food. Deva loka is said to have every kind
of pleasure except food, and that has to go there from here. Agni takes
it there. Any unburnt offerings are (a) either undigested by agni which
is bad for us, because some hold that this will give the yajaman a
stomach ache (b) the food never went to the intended deva because agni
never fully burnt it.

I don't know which book you read this from, but this is definitely not
true. The offering in the fire is made with specific mantras such as
"agnaye idam na mama" etc. - meaning, this offering just made is not
mine but Agni's. How would you explain the fact you offered it to Him,
and yet will eat it? Will it not be like giving you guest food and then
plucking it out of his hands ...? 
And this question should not arise at all, given the answer to your
question 1.

As a general rule, yes you can, but there are exceptions to which kinds
of havan's that you may NOT take vibhuti from. I don't have the list
with me here. The thing to note though is that only that part of the ash
which is white is to be used as vibhuti. The gray or black portions are
not to be used. The exception to this rule again is when dharba grass is
used with specific mantras - although black, it is used as vibhuti or
raksha.

Yes. This is the rule in the "pure" form. But this almost never happens
today. 

Hope this helps.
