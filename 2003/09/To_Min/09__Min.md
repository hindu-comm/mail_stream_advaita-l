Dear Maria,

Thanks for your advice. My understanding was that
a seeker was supposed to have just one guru and
that the guru be in person. Also, I understood
that the guru finds the seeker, and not the other
way around.

But there are both ways, as Shankara sought out
Gaudapada and Gaudapada sent him to Govinda. So,
this makes my first statement wrong.

Much, if not most, of what is written here in the
posts is beyond my understanding, but I learn and
understand some important things sometimes and I
am very grateful for that.

Min    (a 65-year-old retired guy who still has
householder duties)  ;^)

Dear Min (excuse my poor english, please)
A year ago I began to study Advaita VedAnta and
few
months ago I join this list.
When I arrived here, one of my first mails was
about
my searching of a guru and, wonderfully, I can say
that five or six of the enlighten members of this
list
have become my teachers.
I attend their commentaries as a disciple who has
been
permitted to attend the chat of his masters.
They are enlighten and illustrated persons. I
limit me
to study their mails, to read the books that they
mention and compare them with their commentaries.
I
tell it to you because I have noted, excuse my
imprudence, few humility in your mails.
We are full of ignorance. Wise is the one who
listen
to his masters.
My humble recommendation is:  Open your mind and
your
heart to this opportunity that is offered to you.
Learns and meditate in what you learned.
Yours

Maria
