Namaste

In the postings of DPDS -21 and DPDS - 22, the appearance in the e-scribe archives is clumsy because of the mess with the wrapping of lines. I tried to increase the font size for purposes of easy reading, but this is the result. 
However while this is happening only in the archives presentation; it seems to be alright in the Messages portion of the Home page. Also in advaita-L it is coming out alright even in the archives of e-scribe. 
May I have the advice of someone who can help me sort this out? Thanks.

PraNAms to all devotees of Mother Goddess.
