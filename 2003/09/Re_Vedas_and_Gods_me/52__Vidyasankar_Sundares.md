That is a stretch, to say the least.

>Do Narayana, Shiva and Brahma ( not Brahman of the Vedas ) come up at all ?
>Do the Upanishads mention these Gods ?

They are all mentioned in the Upanishads and overall in the Vedas, but the 
preferred term for the supreme is brahman or parabrahman. In Sankara's 
commentaries, you find brahman, ISvara, parabrahman and parameSvara as 
preferred terms.
