namasthe,

  If during Homam/Havan, if the agni gets into
a smoky form without any flames (jwAlA) for sometime,
does it signify anything ? Can we continue the 
homam when its in this form (smoking without jWalA)?
I request the learned members of the group to kindly 
explain about this.

namasthe
Prasad
