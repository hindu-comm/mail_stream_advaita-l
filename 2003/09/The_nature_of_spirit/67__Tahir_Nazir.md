I came across a view from a religious person that stated spiritual 
realisation is due to a brain event, specifically situated in the right 
hand side. He said there is nothing demeaning to spirituality if it is 
seen as a result of brain activity.This is an anti-metaphysical view, 
reducing all things to the one level of reality - namely the corporeal. 
Could you comment on the nature of spiritual realisation that would 
clearly show  this view to be a misconception?

Regards,
Tahir
