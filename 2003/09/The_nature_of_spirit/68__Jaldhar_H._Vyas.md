This is a timely question.  I was going to write more about this as a
followup to my post last week but I'll reply here instead.

Advaita Vedanta is not idealistic in the philosophical sense.  I.e. the
phenomena of the visible universe is not "all in your head."  There is
actual "stuff" but it's true nature is misunderstood due to Maya.  There
is one level of reality and it is corporeal as well as spiritual.  The
error is in considering them to be seperate.  (Advaita == not-two)

In Yoga especially the correspondence of the macrocosm and ones own self
are explicitly described.  So the various veins and arteries of the body
are equal to the rivers such as Ganga and Yamuna.  The bones are equal to
the mountains such as Himalaya and vindhya.  In the same way the Yogis
personal practice is supposed to affect his outside environment too.

Thus there should be no objection to the idea of realization being a
result of brain activity.  As long as your friend also admits that brain
activity is a result of realization :)
