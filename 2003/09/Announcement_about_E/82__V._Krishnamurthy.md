Namaste all.

Om ShrI mAtre namah.



In view of Navaratri I want to offer, God Willing, my homage in the form of a continuous essay on Mother Goddess, in Hindu Thought and Culture in three instalments. The first instalment is being posted today separately. Much of the material is of course coming from my book on The Ten Commandments of Hinduism but I have augmented it for the occasion. Knowledgeable members might find it all rather elementary; but my target audience is youngsters and beginners. I wish the indulgence of the members to give it a little bit of their time and help me with their feedback and comments.   Thanks. 



With praNAms to all devotees of Mother Goddess
