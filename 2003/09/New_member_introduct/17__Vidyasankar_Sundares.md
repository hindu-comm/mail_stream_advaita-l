I come from an orhtodox hindu brahmin family. Right from my childhood I had 
the oppurtunity to be in constant touch with the teachings of Sri Shankara. 
Recently I came to know about this mailing list while browsing the net. 
Because my idealogies match with that of the work happening in this 
mailing-list, I would like to subscribe to the same. Being an ardent 
follower of the teachings of Sri Shankara and following the tradition of the 
unbroken 'parampara' of Sri Sringeri Sharada Peetham, it will be a great 
pleasure for me if I am given the opportunity to be part of the list.

Any more information needed will be mailed.

Thanks and Regards,
Chakradhar N R
