My name is R Karthick. I am basically an engineering student studying in 
Chennai, India. I was or rather am spiritually moved by Swami Vivekanandas 
articles on Advaita and Vedanta which i got hold of from Ramakrisha mission 
bookhouse here. I can understand that that the only truth in the world in 
the self, the supreme self. But still I am sometimes caught up with 
questions and in dilemma about certain things. I wanted to join the group 
because, I wanted to share my thoughts with people of my similar wavelength 
and be spiritually enlightened.

Hope you will consider my request for the membership in the mailing list.

Regards,
R Karthick
