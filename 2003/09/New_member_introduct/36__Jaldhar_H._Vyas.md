Hello. My name is Akilesh Ayyar. I'm interested in joining the list
because I am interested in learning about and discussing advaita
vedanta. I am also working with Swami Bodhananda Saraswati, a well-known
advaitic scholar and sannyasi, on a book manuscript about advaita. We
would like to present parts of the manuscript to the group to see what
they think. Thank you.

Akilesh Ayyar
