namasthe,

 If the learned members of the group can 
 explain the significance of each day of Navaratri
 and the specific set of Pujas that should be performed
 with the respective name of Slokas and Stotras, 
 it'd be very helpful for the devotees all over the 
 world.

 If it could be done atleast 2 days before start of 
 Navaratri, devotees can really use that information 
 this Navaratri itself.

Prasad
