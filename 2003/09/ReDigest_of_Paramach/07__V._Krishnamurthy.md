Namaste,
This is in reply to Manikantanji. Obviously you have missed the
fact that this is a series of articles of which this is the
15th. The first one was numbered Message 14046. That was on
August 1, 2003. Kindly read from the beginning. I am sure you
will find your question answered. Thank you.

PranAms to all adv aitins and Devotees of Mother Goddess
