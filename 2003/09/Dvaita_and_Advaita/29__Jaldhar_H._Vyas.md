Any question sincerely asked is a valid one!  (well relating to the
subject at hand that is.  We can't guarantee answers on income tax etc. :-)

However you should check the archives first to see if the question hasn't
already been discussed previously.  It would save everyone a lot of time.

No this is wrong.  All three were generations apart from each other.
And Ramanuja was an exponent of vishistadvaita not Dvaita (which was
Madhva.)

Yes they certainly disagree on many important issues.  However they do
agree on some issues too.

Well why not do some research and find out?

http://www.ramanuja.org/ - Vishishtadvaita Home Page
http://www.dvaita.org/   - Dvaita Home Page

They each also have a mailing list with searchable archives like this one.
You can compare and contrast their philosophies to see where and why they
differ with Advaita and where and why they agree.

I am a big proponent of followers of all the sampradayas learning about
each other.  From an Advaita point of view anything that decreases
ignorance has merit and should be encouraged.
