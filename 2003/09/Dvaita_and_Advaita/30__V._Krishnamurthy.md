Namaste. 
Apropos Manikantan's questions on Dvaita and Advaita
"......How can we know who is correct? Is it somehow possible
that Both are correct. or is it that ONE and ONLY ONE 
of these two contradicting things can be TRUE",

for a fundamental understanding, may I refer him to  the  four
webpages of mine starting at 

http://www.geocities.com/profvk/gohitvip/71.html

 The topics discussed are:

The Art  and Science of Spiritual Love:
1. The non-Absolutist school
2. The advaitic school and the message of Oneness
3. Practical non-duality
4. Difference and Non-difference.

Alond with Jaladharji, I also commend Manikantanji to search
through the early messages on this list where stalwarts on this
list have written elaborately on these topics.
