Namaste
Sri N. Seshan writes :

"referring to the below quoted piece , i would like to know why the deity of
the place Tirumiyachur , close to mayavaram is not mentioned. The temple
itself is dedicated to Lalita and the local temple history ( sthala varular)
says that the lalita sahasranama was composed there......."

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

It may please be noted by N. Seshan that the series of posts is the digest of what the Maha-Swamigal of Kanchi (the Paramacharya) spoke and as recorded by Sri Ra. Ganapati. So the mention or non-mention  of any particular deity or place was the choice of His Holiness only.
