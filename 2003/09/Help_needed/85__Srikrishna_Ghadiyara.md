Hari Om !!

It is very simple. Continue to eat, work, sleep and
all else that you do now.

Whether you 'practice' this or that or none, 'What Is'
is always Advaitam. When you get tired of the above
mentioned 'eat, work, sleep and all else that you do
now', contemplate on this Ultimate Truth.

Om Namo Narayanaya !!

Srikrishna
