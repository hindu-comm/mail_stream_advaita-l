Namaste,
I have a general question about the Vedas and the gods mentioned in them. I remember reading somewhere that ' Brahman ' and ' Ishwara ' are the only two names that come up as the supreme Godhead in the vedas.
Do Narayana, Shiva and Brahma ( not Brahman of the Vedas ) come up at all ? 
Do the Upanishads mention these Gods ?  

Thanks and Best Regards
Guruprasad
