My name's Madhusudan Rao, a resident of Bangalore. I was a member of
this list some years back when I was working for my masters degree.
I somehow did not continue after I joined Industry and now wish
to rejoin. I am a mAdhwa by birth and I am interested to know and learn
philosophies other than dvAita, advAita in particular.

I work for Texas Instruments (India), in the area of integrated circuits
for signal processing.

Thanks and Regards,
Madhu
