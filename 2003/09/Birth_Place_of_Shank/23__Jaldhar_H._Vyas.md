Just as using the proverb "carrying coals to Newcastle" doesn't
automatically mean you are from Northern England, a mention of
Pataliputra (modern Patna in Bihar) doesn't imply anything by itself as it
is a stock example in many Sanskrit sayings.

Interestingly in the Saundaryalahiri there is a shloka which speaks of
Mataji being adored by the "Dravidashishu" (child of Dravida)  Is
Shankaracharya talking about himself?  Some scholars think so.  Others
think it could refer to the saint Jnanasambandha.
