You can make a claim that certain ideas are similiar to Mahayana ones
(though on closer examination you would be wrong :-) or even to other
systems of thought.  But the question is would that be based on facts or
on some foggy notion of "Eastern Mysticism" or something?

As Advaitins our first and foremost loyalty should be to truth.

A common criticism of people who hold such views is that we are "living in
the past."  But this is a canard.  What we want is to harmoniously
integrate new ideas in a fashion that doesn't do violence to the old.
but A lot of people just want to use the name of Advaita Vedanta to push their
own pet theories.

True.  However it should be noted that it is equally a mistake to try and
reduce Advaita Vedanta to a narrow cannon.  It is a whole conceptual
framework and the prasthana-trayi is only the concentrated epitome of it.
For instance many references are made to the ritual portions of the Veda.
Although they are not a department of Vedanta per se, if you don't
understand them you can't claim to fully understand Vedanta.  That's why
we don't mind discussing general issues of Dharma here either.
