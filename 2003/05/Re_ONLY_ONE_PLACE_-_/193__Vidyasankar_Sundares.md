Similarity of naishkarmyasiddhi is not with pancIkaraNa, but with the 
vArtika on it.

Well, there are other scholars who opine otherwise. This is the nature of 
arguments about textual authenticity. Without clear evidence one way or the 
other, there is always something that can be said for both sides, without 
resolution. I will have to read the book you quote before I can add much 
else to this discussion.

Vidyasankar
