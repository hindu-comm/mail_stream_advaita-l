  The authority for my saying that Ribhu Gita is a part of Shiva
Rahasya is from Sri Thangaswamy Sharma's Sanskrit book - Advaita
Vedanta a Bibliographical survey. Madras University Publication.
1984 Edition.

  yes, sri vidyashankar, shiva rahasya is not a complete purana in
itself.

  regarding a one within Vishnu Purana, i am sorry i have not seen
it.

regards
venkat.
