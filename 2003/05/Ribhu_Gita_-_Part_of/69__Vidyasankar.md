Could you give us details of publication?

Be that as it may, as far as Puranic texts are concerned, Ribhu Gita is
found in many different texts. The Siva Rahasya itself is known as a kANDa
in the Skandapurana. Modern efforts to label the Siva Rahasya as an itihAsa
have no actual traditional basis.

Within Vishnu Purana, the Ribhu Gita is found as a subset of the story of
Jadabharata.
