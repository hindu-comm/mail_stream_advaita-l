Vidyasankar,

I found this book in the UT Library:

Title: Various interpretations of the Rbhu-hymns in the Rgveda : from
Sayanacarya, 14th century A.D. to Prof. Louis Renou,   1965 / translated
into English and compiled by G.V. Davane.

Call number: BL 112.56 V37 1991

You could locate the book through http://www.lib.utexas.edu
I am sure, there are Interlibrary facilities available in a library close to
where you live.

Regards,

Malolan
