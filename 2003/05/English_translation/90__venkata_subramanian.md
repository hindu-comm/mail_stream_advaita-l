Min,

   if you want a fair good idea of the Upanishads, Chinmayananda's
English lectures are a fair guide in my view, as he knows the
tradition, he is better and with a good language too.

   For a deep study, translation of Swami Gambirananda's would be
better published by the Advaita Asrama, Kolkatta, India.
