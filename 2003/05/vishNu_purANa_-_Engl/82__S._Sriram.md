I do agree that the motivations and translations etc. of the colonialists
were
not, to put it mildly, with the interests of the Hindus or Hinduism in mind.

However, it is of interest to note that Mahatma Gandhi's first exposre to
the Bhagvad Gita was with Sir Edwin Arnold's translation which had
a profound effect on him.

The beauty and majesty of these works cannot be hidden by corrupt
translations
and IMHO access to them is of greater value than no access. Tamil & Telugu
works unfortunately equal no access to the English reader.

Thanks
