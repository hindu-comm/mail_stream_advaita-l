The only available translation (I think) is the 1840 HH Wilson translation,
which was made available in reprint by Punthi Pustak, there is also a
more recent publication by Parimal Publications.

This book is in the public domain and is a candidate for proofreading and
e-distribution, if anyone has either the 1840 version or the punthi pustak
reprint please email me.

Thanks
