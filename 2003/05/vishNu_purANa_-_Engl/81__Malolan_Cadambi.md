I was waiting for someone to make this point. At all costs, please avoid
translations by missionaries like H H Wilson and a host of others. As a
general rule of thumb, do not read any translation by western "missionary
scholars". Yes, this rule applies even today and sadly(though not
surprisingly) even to some "Indian" followers of those orientalists.

In my opinion, Max Mueller, H H Wilson, Colebrooke et al belong to the one
best place - the trash can.

I would suggest two alternatives:

1.) The present pEthAdipati of Ahobila matham has translated the Vishnu
purAnam in Tamizh. Although, this is a Sri Vaishnava work - parts of it are
of universal appeal. You could purchase it through
http://www.ahobilamutt.org

2.) Please contact Sringeri matham or Kanchi matham - I am sure the
Chandrashekara Saraswathi Vishwavidyalayam would have Telugu translations of
the same.
