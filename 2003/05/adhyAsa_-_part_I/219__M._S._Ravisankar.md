namaste Sri Jay Nelamangala:

Your message reminded me of a long pending work of converting a Sri Subhanu
Saxena's article on adhyAsa bhaashhya to PDF. I posted the revision 1 of
this text document in 2001. Here is the revision 2 of the document:

them automatically using a script to Roman Transileration in LaTeX.


Enjoy.

Ravi

(Sunderji, can you please forward this to Advaitin)
