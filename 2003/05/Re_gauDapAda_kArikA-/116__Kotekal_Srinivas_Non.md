Dear Vidyasankar,

Just curious to know your following point ;

>You've got that last part right. There is no bondage, no liberation, no 
>seeker of liberation - from the pAramArthika level. This is as per
gauDapAda 
>himself.

If there is no bondage what so ever from absolute level (paramarthika
level), why should I put effort (in this v-level) for the liberation (and
which is also not real in P-level) ? anyway I am Brahmn ultimately, even
though I may or may not try to realize in this v-level.


Regards,
Srinivas
