However, think about the following. The jIva, being brahman, is also a kind 
of sa-guNa brahman (the guNa-s differ), and according to your own thinking, 
the jIva is deluded.

It is only when you equate saguNa brahman with ISvara that you have to 
insist upon ISvara being undeluded.

Well, asampradAyavit sarva-SAstravid api mUrkhavad upekShaNIyaH -

If so, I don't understand why you have to have a problem with gauDapAda 
kArikA-s.

un-vedAntic posulates? It seems to me that this is completely a 
misunderstanding of what he says.
