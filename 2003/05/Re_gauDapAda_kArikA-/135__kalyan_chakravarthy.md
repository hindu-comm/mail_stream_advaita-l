Namaste,

>So are you saying prakrti is not also part of Brahman?  If it is than how
>do you justify treating "material" vs "transcendental"?

I never talked about prakriti being or not being a part of brahman.


>That Brahman is free from _all_ attributes is known from the Gita.  Again
>why the distinction between material and transcendental?

No disagreement here. But since the context is saguNa brahman, I have not 
touched upon the topic of nirguNa brahman.


>You are I'm afraid.  Sammohitam means _He_is_deluding_Himself_.  There is
>only one true entity, Brahman.  So any illusion that we can speak of has
>to be Brahman.


This point has already been refuted. Refer to the previous mail.

In that case you must assume that a part of brahman is being deluded, while 
another part remains undeluded.

But even the upanishads or brahmaSutras dont attribute any delusion to 
brahman. So, we as finite beings in space and time need not do that.

Couldn't have agreed with you better. But notice that even your reasoning 
does not show that brahman is deluded.(no Mr.X in the final point)


>The Vedas themselves say that Brahman is prana etc.

But not to show that brahman is deluded.

>It is that identification which is being described here as delusion (but
>again I repeat it is a necessary one.)


Delusion. Yes.
To brahman. No.

Kalyan
