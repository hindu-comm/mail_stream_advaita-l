So are you saying prakrti is not also part of Brahman?  If it is than how
do you justify treating "material" vs "transcendental"?

That Brahman is free from _all_ attributes is known from the Gita.  Again
why the distinction between material and transcendental?

You are I'm afraid.  Sammohitam means _He_is_deluding_Himself_.  There is
only one true entity, Brahman.  So any illusion that we can speak of has
to be Brahman.

Only if avidya were the totality of Brahman.  It might help if I drew a
picture. (if it looks messed up, use a fixed space font like courier.)

I can say "the locus of the small box is in the left hand corner of
the larger box."  But can I say "the smaller box is the larger box"?

Yes but again it is a necessary part of Vedanta becuse we (meaning
advaita-l readers) are finite beings of space and time who normally deal
with concepts like loci (locuses?) When one finally moves beyond that
level a locus isn't necessary but by that point Vedanta isn't necessary
either.

You have it backwards.  Mr. X is deluded.  delusion is unreal.  Therefore
Mr. X is not deluded.  Actually the sequence of events is probably more
like this:

1. Mr. X thinks he is not deluded.

2. Mr. X learns from study of the shastras that view 1 is a delusion.

3. After further study Mr. X learns that both 1 and 2 are unreal.

4. For that matter Mr. X-ness is also unreal.

5. Brahman (no Mr. X at this point) _knows_ it is not deluded.

Unacceptable to whom?  The Vedas themselves say that Brahman is prana etc.
It is that identification which is being described here as delusion (but
again I repeat it is a necessary one.)
