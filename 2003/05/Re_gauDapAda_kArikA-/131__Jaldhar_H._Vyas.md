Yes.

Not just.  In fact the boundary between Atman and Brahman is arbitrary.
Placing it at the limit of the body is just convenient.  Like the boundary
between USA and Mexico is the Rio Grande river.  It could have been to the
north or it could have been to the south but it was convenient to have it
marked by a natural phenomenon like a river.

Yes and no.  In the saguna aspect Brahman has a seperate identity but in
the nirguna aspect It doesn't.  Again "identity" is an arbitrary mapping
onto the infinite.
