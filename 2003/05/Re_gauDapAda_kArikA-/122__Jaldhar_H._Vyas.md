The latter.  This is why his philosophy is also called Asparsha Yoga
because the atma is truly never touched by maya.  That is like the example
of the Moon appearing to sit in the branches of a tree when in fact it is
thousands of miles away.  So too, because our immediate perceptions are
based on the faulty testimony of the senses, the atma appears to be "in"
the body even though it is really seperate.
