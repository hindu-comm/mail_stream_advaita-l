Dear Shankaran,
Namaste.

Upanishat describes God as "poorvamarshat"

>You cannot say you really
> know something till you know it fully, can you?

Not really.  Take any branch of knowledge, say chemistry.

Of course we know chemistry,  does it mean we should
stop all research on chemistry, because we know chemistry ?

Do we say we don't know chemistry because research
is still going on all over the world on chemistry?.

"Brahma vidyAm sarva vidyA pratiShTAm"

If this is true for a mundane subject such as chemistry,
then it is necessarily true for Brahma-vidyA where the
subject matter by definition is Infinite.

What we already know about God is miniscule.
What is  yet to be known about God is always infinite.
Otherwise, "ananta" becomes a mere word.

Of course, one can kid oneself thinking otherwise.
