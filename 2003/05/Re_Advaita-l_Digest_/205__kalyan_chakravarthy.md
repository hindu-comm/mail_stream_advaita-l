Namaskaaram,

Leaving aside Sri Adi Shankara's commentary, I would accept what is being 
suggested here if you can throw light on two things -

1.The earlier said analogy of two birds in mundaka and the reference to the 
two entering the body in katha.

2.The reference to the size of the soul in the brahmasUtras.(aNu)

However you would not say that the five sheaths belong to the Atman. Would 
you? If not, you can call them only as limiting adjuncts.

I believe, here they are treated as limiting adjuncts.

>Who said that brahman is really deluded?

Two questions have been posed regarding this in my earlier mails with 
reference to gauDapAdA. I suggest you go through them.

>Just to remind you of the question, to quote your own words, "And as for

gauDapAdA. Before you disagree you may look at the same two questions.


>>You misunderstood me. My intention is not that jIvanmukta does not sleep 
>>etc. It is just that you cannot say that he is deluded even if he sleeps 
>>etc. No guesses - like comparing this with a normal jIva.

No. But the esscence is unaffected(really or otherwise) even though the jIva 
is. Also, it must not be forgotten that the jIva lost its individuality 
ultimately.

However for the sake of rhetoric sruti itself seems to be doing what you are 
accusing me of. You disagree?


>If the jIva is wholly unreal, then it cannot have its essence as the real 
>Atman which is brahman. So there has to be something about the jIva that is 
>real and that always was, is and will be real.

Who denied its empirical reality? And as for unreality you know in what 
senses the term can be applied.


>So, we return to my characterization of your view of jIvanmukti - that the 
>jIvanmukta loses individuality in turIya and then returns to unreal 
>individuality in other states, i.e. into and out of delusion periodically.


To repeat it again - "A jIvanmukta is not comparable to a jIva" Even you 
would agree that sruti is not useful, once realization dawns.

The statement regarding logic is in general accepted by all vedAntins. Also, 
you are yet to refute my statements on gauDapAda.(oh yes, by openly pointing 
out him, I took care to distinguish the traditional point of view)


Best Regards
Kalyan
