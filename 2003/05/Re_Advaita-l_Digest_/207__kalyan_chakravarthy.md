Namaste,

>Let's not leave aside the commentary. Rather refer to Sankara's commentary 
>on this sUtra and also on the guhAM praviShTAv AtmAnau sUtra.

Now that the sUtra has your attention, I would like to present your earlier 
statement -

*Rather, it is as the jIva that brahman pervades the body and the jIva 
itself IS the higher prakRti while the body IS the lower prakRti*

That jIva and Ishwara have both been spoken of as entering into the body 
would justify the statement that brahman is anyway pervading the body. 
Further justification comes from the two birds analogy.

Same question. *Who according to gauDapAda is imagining the individual 
self?* If this is not an objection to you, then nothing is.


>That is a cop-out and a refusal to address the fact that your notion of

I dont think so.

Who according to gauDapAda is imagining the individual self? (Incidentallly 
you never touched this point till now. You can verify it yourself.)

Best Regards
Kalyan
