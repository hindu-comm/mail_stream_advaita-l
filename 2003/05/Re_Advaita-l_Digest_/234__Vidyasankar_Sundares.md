This sentiment is fine, but I would still like to know whose interpretation 
you follow for these sUtra-s. As far as I know, it is not Ramanujacharya's, 
but I am unaware which bhAshya explains the Ikshaty adhikaraNam as you do. 
Besides, if these sUtra-s are meant to further expound on the previous 
sUtra-s on samanvaya and SAstra-yonitva, there is no need to consider these 
as a separate adhikaraNa at all.

Regards,
Vidyasankar
