I think of it slightly differently. Chemistry is a subject
which involves interpretation of data obtained from
sensory perceptions. It is only such subjects which are
limited and imperfect due to apprehension through the
senses. On the other hand, Brahman is not an object of
sense perception. It cannot be compared to mundane
subjects, and neither can brahma-vidya be compared to
mundane knowledge.

In advaita, it is brahman/atman which knows itself. So it
is not limited by this knowledge.

So, if brahman is always known only partially, why do only
some people get liberated? Is there a threshold of partial
knowledge of brahman which needs to be crossed before
liberation? If so, what is this threshold of knowledge,
and when and how is it reached? Where is this threshold
specified? Once this threshold is crossed, is there a
difference in the knowledge between different jivas? Since
the liberated jivas know brahman only partially, there
might be a difference in the brahman-knowledge of
different jivas, right?
