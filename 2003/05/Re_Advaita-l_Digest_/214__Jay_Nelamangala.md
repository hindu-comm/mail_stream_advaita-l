Dear VidyAshankar,

>As another example, take gItA 13. 12-13. sarvataH pANipAdaM etc. describes
>brahman as having faces, eyes, hands and feet everywhere, and as having
>entered everything. sarvendriyaguNAbhAsaM says that brahman also appears as
>all the sense organs. This is adhyAropa. The apavAda follows in the term,
>sarvendriya-vivarjitam. The same brahman is now said to be devoid of all

>unconnected to anything - asaktaM.

"BhAsrdeeptou"  -  It illumines sarva-indriya-guNa or indriya-vishaya.
sarvANi IndriyANi guNAn shabdAdi vishayAmscha AbhAsayati-pratyAyayati
pratyEti Vaa sarvEndriyaguNAbhAsam |

prAkrtAnAm cha indriyANAm abhAvAt sarvEndriya-vivarjitam |

sa-rvaE-ndri-ya-gu-NA-bhA-sam
sa-rvaE-ndri-ya-vi-va-rji-tam |

It knows everything from every organ.  It pervades everything (
sarva-vyApta ).  In this way,  Its form is thus infinite. (13.14).   Thus It
illuminates and controls all indriya-vishayas (sarva-indriya-guNa-Abhaasa).
But, Its indriyas are not made out of Prakrti. It is untainted by Prakrti
(asakta, nirlEpa),  enjoyer of essence of all ( sarva-sAra-bhOktr) and
Destroyer of All (sarva-bhuk, sarva-samhartr).

Here again,  I don't see any contradiction.  Thus,  I don't need
adhyArOpa-apavAda to understand Geetha 13.14.

So,  looks like adhyArOpa-apavAda is needed only for those who
are  unable to find consistency in what they read in Agama.

Correct me if I am wrong.
