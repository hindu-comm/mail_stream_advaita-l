Let's not leave aside the commentary. Rather refer to Sankara's commentary 
on this sUtra and also on the guhAM praviShTAv AtmAnau sUtra.

And sufficient discussion has gone by to show you that he refers to the jIva 
just three verses before the one you quote, and that he does not say that 
brahman is really deluded. Enough said, except for reiterating, read verse 
19 in its context of the verses that come before it.

Again, if you think Sruti itself seems to be saying so, read Sankara's 
commentary on the sUtra "avasthitheH".

>>If the jIva is wholly unreal, then it cannot have its essence as the real

I am not talking about the empirical reality of the jIva. I am talking of 
that which is eternally real about the jIva, that which continues to be real 
despite the state of delusion.

>>So, we return to my characterization of your view of jIvanmukti - that the

>To repeat it again - "A jIvanmukta is not comparable to a jIva" Even you

That is a cop-out and a refusal to address the fact that your notion of what 
is advaita is fundamentally incompatible with the very principle of 
jIvanmukti.

>The statement regarding logic is in general accepted by all vedAntins. 
>Also, you are yet to refute my statements on gauDapAda.(oh yes, by openly 
>pointing out him, I took care to distinguish the traditional point of view)

Well, I confess I don't understand what it will take to convince you that 
your statements on gauDapAda have already been refuted, many times over. 
Every sentence in the last five or six replies I have posted was geared 
towards that purpose. Since I don't care to repeat myself endlessly, this is 
the last post in this discussion with you.

Best wishes,
Vidyasankar
