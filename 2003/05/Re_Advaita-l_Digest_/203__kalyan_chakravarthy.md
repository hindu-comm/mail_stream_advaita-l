The misunderstanding is yours.

Brahman is pervading in the body anyway(not necessarily as a form of 
prakRti) - from the mundaka anology of two birds (jIva and paramAtma)  and 
the katha up statement about *two* entering the body. That should positively 
negate one of your conclusions.

>From the same chapter in BG- prakRti and purusha are eternal and forms and 
qualities are born of prakRti.

BTW, just to clarify again, by material attribues, I meant attributes like 
sattva etc.

See above. In general it is not argued that way because jIva suffers.

*There is nothing that is not brahman* means that the world is a 
superimposition.

And if you accept that the answer is not brahman you cannot say that brahman 
is deluded.

The essence of jIva is the Atman which is nothing but brahman. However, that 
does not mean brahman is deluded. Logic going against vedAnta is logic gone 
astray.

No erroneous conclusions here. avidya includes mistaken identity. That 
should close the issue. I have already written on this matter some time back 
in response to another member.

You misunderstood me. My intention is not that jIvanmukta does not sleep 
etc. It is just that you cannot say that he is deluded even if he sleeps 
etc. No guesses - like comparing this with a normal jIva.

This is not about bhedas as such. It is just that jIva itself is unreal. 
why? abhAsa eva cha. Even you would agree that jIva loses its individuality 
in turIya. That is as good as passively admitting the unreality of jIva. The 
point is that any such analysis carried in the backward direction, leads you 
directly against vedAnta. You disagree?

Not necessary. It is enough if he is able to discriminate *properly* between 
the Self and non-Self.


>As you want to completely divorce material attributes from brahman and as

A jIvanmukta is never going to identify himself with his body. All your 
reasoning collapses.


>In other words, according to YOUR definitions, or shall we say, loose 
>descriptions, a jIvanmukta is quite an impossibility, and the very term 
>jIvan-mukti is an oxymoron. So, it is you that has no alternative.

Already refuted. See above.


I think the rest of the mail is based on your incorrect understanding of my 
position. So I close the issue here.
