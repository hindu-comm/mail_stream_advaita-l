Dear VidyAshankar,

Thanks for the information.  So adhyArOpa-apavAda  is not a general  approach in
understanding Veda, but is applicable only in specific cases.  It  is to be used 
only when I see a contradiction between the first and last parts of the 
same vedic sentence.  Am I right?

>Take for example, purusha sUkta's "ajAyamAno bahudhA vijAyate". In the same
>sentence are two contradictory attributes - one of being born many-fold

I don't see any contradiction there.

ajAyamAnO tells me Brahman was never born and He was always there.
bahudhA vijAyate -   "roopam roopam pratiroopO babhoova"
"sO kAmayata |  bahusyAm prajA yEyEti"
Shrutis say, that He intended to become many and became many.

The things of the world are born out of prakrti as reflections of these many
forms that Brahman took.  This is how things of the world are prAkrita,  and
although He is sarva-bhootAntarAtmA  He is not prAkrita i.,e He is NirguNa.

Where is the contradiction here?   Since I do not see any contradiction,
I do not need adhyArOpa-apavAda to understand this shruti,  or do I?.

You have articulated very well on 'samanvaya'.  I have no problems with
the notion of  'samanvaya', at all.  I do have several questions on this
adhyArOpa.  I will pose them one at  a time.

I was supposed to write a series on it in the other advaita list,  instead
may be I will do it here,  in due course.
