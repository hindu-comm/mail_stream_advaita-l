However, SAstra directly says otherwise. Sruti says, 'brahmavid Apnoti 
paraM' and 'brahmaiva bhavati' while smRti (gItA) says, 'sa brahmabhUyAya 
kalpate'. These statements include not only human beings on this earth 
trying to know brahman, but any being, anywhere in the universe. These 
directly contradict the idea that those who are trying to know brahman will 
never be brahman.
