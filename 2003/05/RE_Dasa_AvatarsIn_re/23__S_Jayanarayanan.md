Did you know that the GauDapaadiiya KArikA is
considered to be one of the most important works in
the Shankaran tradition, and that one of the accepted
theories in advaita VedAnta is that the locus of
ignorance is the supreme Self (KArikA 2.19)? 

Before you go about making absurd statements, please
try and remedy your ignorance of the advaita
tradition. Suggested readings:
