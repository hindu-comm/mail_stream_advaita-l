If Atman is deluded by ignorance then ignorance should be as real as Atman.
None can drink water from a mirage. Nor can you say that I can be injured
by
the horns of a hare.

In any case saying that Atman is deluded is a highly unvedantic position.
Refer to the reply given to Mr. Jayanarayanan.

>  I completely agree with you prabhuji, atman cannot be the locus of
avidya as it is witness consiousness... which is alone is really real
ultimately according to vedanta.  So, agnAna can be traces its root in our
conditioned sharIras which is non-self made up of the body, the senses &
the mind & obviously unreal appearance, set up by ignorance.  Human
intellect has the natural tendency (svabhAvatah) to project the non-real
anAtma & confound the identity of the real & the unreal whenever it
functions (satyAnruta mithunIkaraNatvam).  Jaldhar prabhuji, kindly clarify
if I am wrong in my understanding.
