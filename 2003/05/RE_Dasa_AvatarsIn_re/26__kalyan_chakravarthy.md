Can you show me where in the vedanta would you find the idea of brahman 
being deluded? As evidence, you have to present me the original text of the 
upanishad in sanskrit. That brahman is free from all sorts of misery is THE 
vedantic idea. If you want to claim that brahman is being deluded, then your 
idea has no support in vedanta.(That is my understanding of vedanta) You 
cannot impose your subjectivity on brahman and claim it to be vedanta.

If however you are able to show me *from vedanta* that avidya can affect 
brahman Itself, then I promise you that I will accept defeat humbly and 
unsubscribe from this forum.


Best Regards
Kalyan
