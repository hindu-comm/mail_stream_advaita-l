Which means you are accepting that Atman being deluded is only subjective. 
Since subjectivity is not the means for knowing brahman, you are inherently 
accepting that Atman is undeluded.

That does not mean that brahman is deluded. Nor is meditation possible if it 
is thought that brahman is deluded.
