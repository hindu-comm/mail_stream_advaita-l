I am surprised then that Sri Sankaracharya has written commentaries to the
Karikas. Is there any place in the Karika-bhashya where Sankaracharya has
disagreed (strongly or otherwise) with Sri Gaudapadacharya's statements?
Till I find such evidence and understand it for myself, I will take the word
of the Acharyas that Gaudapadacharya's Karikas are vedanta only.
