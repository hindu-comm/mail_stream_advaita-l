namaste,

Sorry for the really late follow-up.

I objected to your statement that Sri Sankaracharya did reject the vedas.
The vedas includes the upanishads too. I wouldn't agree with a blanket
statement saying that He has rejected them. BTW, He has also quoted from the
non-upanishad parts of the vedas, hasn't He?

I thought you meant the avidya affecting the jiva.

Yes, Sankaracharya does reject the karma kanda but only for the purpose of
moksha. For normal day-to-day life, the karma kanda is of great importance.
There is therefore a significant difference between the rejections of any
part or whole of the vedas by Sankaracharya and Buddha.
