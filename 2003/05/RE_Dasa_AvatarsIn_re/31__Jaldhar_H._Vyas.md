And so it is. _As_long_as_one_believes_it_is.  The whole point of Advaita
Vedanta is to show that "conventional wisdom" concerning the nature of the
world is false (mithya.)

But it is very common sense position.  For a philosophy to be an effective
pedagogical tool, it has to work at all levels of understanding.
