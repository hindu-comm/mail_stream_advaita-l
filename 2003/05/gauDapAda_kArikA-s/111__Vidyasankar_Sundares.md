I am changing the subject header from "Dasa Avatars" ...

Kalyan, I presume you would accept that the jIva is deluded. And I presume 
you also would agree that the jIva is, in essence, Brahman. In what sense, 
do you think, is the jIva Brahman? Also, would you kindly look at verse no. 
16, three verses before the one you quoted from the kArikA?

It is obvious to me, from a number of your previous posts, that you quite 
miss the point of mANDUkya upanishad and the kArikAs. I would suggest 
studying it well and deeply, before making superficial statements that only 
serve to incite adverse comment.
