Namaskaaram,


>Kalyan, I presume you would accept that the jIva is deluded.

Surely. But not brahman.

>And I presume you also would agree that the jIva is, in essence, Brahman. 
> >In what sense, do you think, is the jIva Brahman?

abhAsa eva cha.(a reflection indeed)  These are not my thoughts. The 
brahmasUtras say it. Once again we have shAstrayonittvAt.(no scope for 
subjectivity.) The distinctions vanish only in the liberated state. Thus 
there is no way in which brahman is deluded.

>Also, would you kindly look at verse no. 16, three verses before the one 
>you quoted from the kArikA?

May I know in what way is that going to help?

>It is obvious to me, from a number of your previous posts, that you quite

I dont think saying that brahman is undeluded is equivalent to missing the 
point of the mANDUkya upanishad.

Best Regards
Kalyan
