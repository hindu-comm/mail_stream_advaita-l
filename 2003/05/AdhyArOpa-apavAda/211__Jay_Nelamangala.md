I know that Advaita vEdanta thinks that it is superior to samanvaya.
I would like to know why it considers samanvaya as inadequate,
what could be the possible reasons?.

Are you saying it is not found in the prasthAna-traya itself,  but is found only in
their commentories?

If I have a strong working tool-A in understanding Veda,  and if I am asked
to switch to tool-B,   don't I have to know why my tool-A is inadequate
before switching?

That is why I would like to know why the method of 'samanvaya' that is found in
the sootra and also found in shruti,  was found to be inadequate by the thinkers of
Advaita vEdaanta.
