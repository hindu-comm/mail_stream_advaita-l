This auspicious occasion of Shankara Jayanti is a good time to announce we
are moving advaita-l over to new list server software.  So tomorrow things
are liable to get a bit weird.  I  advise you to wait until thursday
before posting.  My apologies for any disruption in conversations this may
cause.
