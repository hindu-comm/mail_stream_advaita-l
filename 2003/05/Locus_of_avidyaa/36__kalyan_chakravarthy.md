A better solution would be - "Since avidya is ultimately unreal, talking of 
its locus is useless. It would be like talking about the salinity of the 
water in a mirage."

But you do contradict vedAnta if you say that brahman is deluded. Not even 
as a vyavahArik satya is it acceptable that brahman is deluded.

Not necessarily. SInce avidya is ultimately unreal.

Saying that brahman is deluded is the highest avidya. Better not to talk 
anything rather than spreading such avidya.

No text which says that brahman is deluded would be spared. vedAnta is more 
important than subjectivity.
