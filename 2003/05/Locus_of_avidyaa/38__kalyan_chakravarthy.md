That would destroy your own argument. The locus of the mirage is the mind 
which is the same as the entity which is being deluded. Mirage itself is a 
delusion. Wait till I come to your next point.

You need not say it explicitly. When you say brahman is the locus of avidya 
it automatically means that brahman is deluded. Avidya is more than a 
superimposition. It is also the mistaken identification of brahman as the 
world. Even though the snake was unreal our perception of the rope as a 
snake was real. But in advaita-vedanta, we deny even that mistaken 
perception (in the case of the substratum being brahman) as being ultimately 
unreal. So obviously, avidya includes mistaken identity. In whcih case 
saying that brahman is the locus of avidya amounts to saying that brahman is 
deluded.
