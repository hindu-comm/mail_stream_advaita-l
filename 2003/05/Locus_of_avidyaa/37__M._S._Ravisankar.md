It is actually like asking "what is the locus of the mirage?"

I did not say brahman is deluded. You reached the conclusion that the
statement "Locus of avidya is brahman" is implying that. It does not.
brahman can be the substratum for avidya without being deluded by it.  This
particular aspect is also discussed  in the book on taitiiriyopanishad I
cited.
