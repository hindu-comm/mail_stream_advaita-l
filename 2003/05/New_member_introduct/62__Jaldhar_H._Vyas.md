Hello,

I am 26 year old, have done my engineering and currently working. A year
back I did a yoga course conducted by Vivekananda yoga kendra. The things
I practiced and the lectures I attended there, urged me to know more about
Hinduism. Then I started reading about Vivekananda's work. I was also
impressed by the life and achievments of Sankara and now I want to know
more about advaita philosophy.

Regards,
Bharata.
