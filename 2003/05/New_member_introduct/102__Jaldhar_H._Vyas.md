Hi
My Name is gurupasad aged 36, I live in US , Born and
educated in India and US. I'm intersted in the
advaitic view of Vedanta. I have heard about a lot
about the sastra and read the postings, So i would
like to join the listings to learn more. My primary
faith is Dvaita philosophy, and there is a need to
understand the Poorva Paksha. Thus I would like to
subscribe for the list.

Thanks
Guruprasad.
