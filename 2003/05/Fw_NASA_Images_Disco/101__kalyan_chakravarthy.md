Namaskaaram,

Though the picture of the bridge was taken by NASA, the interpretation given 
in the article that was quoted, was not that of NASA.

What actually happened is that some site called vaishnava news network and 
other NRI sites propagated some non-sense regarding the photographs of the 
bridge. It is simply "much ado about nothing" for till date there is no 
conclusive evidence to prove anything.

There are many websites that indulge in similar propaganda about "great" 
discoveries, and miracles. It is better to use our own intelligence before 
coming to any conclusion.

All this is however unnecessary from a spiritual point of view. If we are 
longing for miracles, then we are passively admitting that our belief in 
brahman is not sufficiently strong. If we are really spiritual we would not 
care for miracles.

Best Regards
Kalyan
