Rubbish. Have you read the Rig Veda or the Satapata brahmana? Unlike Vishnu 
who was no important God in the Rg Veda samhita, Purusha(Narayana) have 
started their careers as supreme gods. No where is Purusha identified with 
Vishnu in the Rg Veda samhita.

You dont even know why the 10th mandala is treated as the later mandalas. 
There is evidece from linguistics. Linguists who have studied the evolution 
of language in depth have told this. All in all it is similar to a crime 
scene investigation where you proceed based on the rules

It is not as if the Rg veda is unauthored. Mandalas 2 to 7 which are 
considered to be  the oldest are called family mandalas as they are composed 
by families of rishis. So much for the nonsense that you talk.
