It is your assumption that I want to discuss Indology
here. Your reply to the earlier question had advanced
or supported the idea that Narayana and Vishnu refer
to different beings or that such an idea existed at
one point of time. Upon my pointing out that such an
idea has no place in sAmpradAya, which sees Narayana
no differently from Vishnu, you come up with this
incongruent advice as a reply? 

Actually, you were not even true to whatever
contemporary academe holds on the chronology of Vedas.
They hold that Yajurveda is a work later than Rg
(which is why they have to assume that X maNDala is a
latter addition; as if there was one set of accepted
redactions!). So, your point that Narayana started his
career as a foremost god is wrong. There are couple
more, but an instance is sufficient.

You would be doing yourself and everybody a lot of
good, if you, in your replies, distinguish between
sAmpradAyic view and others, i.e., if you know the
difference.

Krishna
