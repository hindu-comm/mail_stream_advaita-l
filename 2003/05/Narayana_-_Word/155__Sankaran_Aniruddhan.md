Though this is traditionally chanted after the nArAyaNa sUktam, it really
ocurs in the gAyatrI mantrA: section towards the beginning of the
mahAnArAyaNa upanishad, where the gAyatrI mantras for different dieties are
given.

I believe some vaishnavas prefer an alternative reading of this verse
without the sa hari: part, so that it identifies nArAyaNa with brahma, shiva
etc, and automatically assumes nArAyaNa's identification with hari or
vishnu.

See http://www.escribe.com/religion/advaita/m6385.html where Sri Anand Hudli
has referred to a verse from the aitareya brAhmaNa of the R^ig Veda:

  agnirvai devAnAmavamo viShNuh paramah | tadantarA sarvA devatAh ||

  "Agni is the lowest and Vishnu is the highest among Gods. All other
  gods occupy positions that are in between."

So Vishnu was certainly an important diety in the Rg Veda. Not the most
common one (I guess Indra gets this honour) but still maybe the most
important one?

I think MadhvachArya used the Rg Veda because he belonged to the Rg Veda
SAkhA.

Maybe I am wrong here, but I think it wasn't necessary for Bhagavan to
explain the intricacies of yogic techniques because traditionally only
sannyasis have practiced yoga extensively. Arjuna wasn't in a position to
renounce the world and become a sannyasi at that point of time.

I'm sure that Bhagavan wouldn't have had any qualms about identifying
himself with Shiva even if the Shiva-Vishnu debate had started by then.

Or mabe nArAyaNa wasn't a *diety* at all, but referred to nirguna brahman.

But this still doesn't explain why the tradition as a whole accepted this
identification.
