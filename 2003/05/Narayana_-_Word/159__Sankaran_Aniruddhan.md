I did not agree with Sri Kalyan when he said that Narayana was a different
diety at some point of time. However, I understood from his postings that he
was just referring to SN Dasgupta's theory and drawing some inferences from
that. There is no doubt that Vishnu is identified with Narayana
traditionally.

You are right, I made a mistake. NB is known through 'neti neti' only.
