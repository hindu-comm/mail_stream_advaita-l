Neither is the Purusha associated with Narayana in
RksamhitA. And in any case, you are forgetting that
this idea of Purusha is only in the 10th Mandala, not
before. So, your idea is again wrong that Purusha
started their career (sic!) as the highest god. That
idea came in much later, according to Indologists
view.

Imbecile assumptions.

If only it were to be so. Most of the times, it is
undoubtedly, an investigation to suit one's theories.

Your confusion is evident by the fact that I never
talked about any stuff that you impose on me. Just
check if you are shouting for the right thing and at
the right person !
