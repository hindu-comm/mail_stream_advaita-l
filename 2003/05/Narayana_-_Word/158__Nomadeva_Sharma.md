Yes certainly. Therefore, the presence of 'sa hariH'
is not a problem to avoid equating the referrent of
the word, 'nArAyaNa' and 'Vishnu'.

There is a commentary on the Mahanarayana Upanishad by
a mAdhva yati, shrI dhIrendra tIrtha. 'sa hariH' is
included in the pATha. 

The point in quoting MahopaniShat was not to support
the draviDa pATha, instead, to show that the Upanishad
does not distinguish between Vishnu and Narayana.

Good point, but the purpose is achieved if any portion
of karma-kANDa is taken (Why, somebody might say, why
not take up Atharva veda because it is tougher to
bring out knowledge from incantations). As such, the
topic is dealt with, partially, in the samanvayAdhyAya
bhAShya; names of different vessels in the sacrifice
are also 'samanvaya'ed.

How do you answer the points I raised above? In any
case, the entity glorified over there --
'sahasra-shIrShaM' (1000 headed), 'devaM'
(resplendent), 'vishvAxaM' -- has too many qualities
that, barring a few, cannot be explained in terms of
absence of negative. In any case, the line equating
him to 'paramAtmA' (which is equivalent of saguNa
brahman or Ishvara) rules out the possibility of
nirguNa brahman.

NB is known through negative statements such as 'neti
neti' and not through positive definitions (like in
the nArAyaNa sUkta).

Regards,
Krishna
