Respected members
 My name is John Mathew and i am very intersted in Advaita pholosophy. Iam a
regular reader of the mail list but just a passive member.
I would like to know the place that Sri Shankaracharya gave to Isvara worship
or devotion. Did He gave approval to the Worship of Ishvara in the form of
Avatars of God.
 If anyone will be able to give me insights on this  I wil be very gratefull.
Thank you
John Mathew
