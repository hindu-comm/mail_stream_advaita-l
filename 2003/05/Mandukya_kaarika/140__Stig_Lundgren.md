Dear Anand,

You can order a catalogue from:

Adyatma Prakasha Karyalaya
Holenarsipur - 573211
Karnataka, India
Telephone: 08175 - 73820

or the Bangalore branch:

Adhyatma Prakasha Karyalaya
68, 2nd Block, Thyagaraja Nagar,
Bangalore - 560 028

If you are interested in Mandukya Rahasya Vivruthi, you should also check out this book:  "The Essential Gaudapada" (First english edition 1997). This book - originaly written in Kannada entitled "Sri Gaudapada Hridaya" - was translated by SatchidanandendraÂ´s disciple D. B. Gangolli. It is a very comprehensive work (58 + 560 pages), and the author analyses in detail the Gaudapada Karikas. The chapters are: "Foreward" (p. i-iv); "Preface" (p. 1-33); "Introduction" (p. 1-25); "Agama Prakarana" (p. 1-103); "Vaitathya Prakarana" (p. 104-208); "Advaita Prakarana" (p. 209-361); "Alatashanti Prakarana" (p. 362-560).

Warm regards
Stig Lundgren



  I wish in this regard, (Bhagavan Gowdapada's Karika) to draw 
  your attention to the work 'Mandukya Rahasya Vivruthi' by Sri 
  Sachidanandendra Saraswathi Swamigal.

  Where can i get a copy of this book in india? and also books by the same author? Is there a catalog?
