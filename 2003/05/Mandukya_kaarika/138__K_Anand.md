Dear all,

I wish in this regard, (Bhagavan Gowdapada's Karika) to draw 
your attention to the work 'Mandukya Rahasya Vivruthi' by Sri 
Sachidanandendra Saraswathi Swamigal.

Where can i get a copy of this book in india? and also books by the same author? Is there a catalog?

Please help. TIA.

Regards
Anand K
