Respected Sri Kalyanji:

As one of the Administrators of this list, I find your language in 
this post unacceptable. 

It is the traditional view that shruti is apaurushheya. R^ishhi-s are 
only mantra drashhTa-s. Language of expression itself may have 
influence of temporal effects in it. That does not imply composition 
by human authors and  the time of seeing the mantra-s does not 
invalidate it or make it inferior. As long as you accept it as shruti, 
you have no choice but accept its apaurushheya aspect and consider its 
validity.

As far as this list is concerned, opinion of the traditional maTha-s, 
such as  Sringeri maTha alone matter and view of indologists are of NO 
importance. Hence, let us base our discussion from that view point.

I hope you understand our position. And I request all the participants 
to end this thread.

Thank you and if I have offended any of you by this post, I apologize 
in advance.

With best wishes,

Ravi
