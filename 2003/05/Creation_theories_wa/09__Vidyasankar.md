There is really no more avidyA after realizing Brahman.

Yes, there is a paradox involved in the transition from identifying with
anAtman to losing this identification with anAtman. The "jIva" is a
transitory entity; it gets affected by avidyA and loses avidyA when it
realizes its essential identity as Brahman.

>river is always the sea. When it merges in the sea, it has no more

But the river is always water, just like the sea is always water. An oil
spill into the ocean remains as oil and doesn't merge with the ocean.
It is only because of the underlying identity of the river as water that
the river can merge into the sea and then come back as a river through the
stages of vapor and rain/snow. You can think of river as jIva, sea as
ISvara or (saguNa) Brahman and water as (nirguNa) brahman. Of course, the
analogy remains inexact, but so be it.

Change the word from jIva to Atman, and we aren't violating anything.
