That is a wrong approach to understanding the upanishad. The *realization*
that jIva = brahman occurs in the fourth state, but the equation of jIva
with brahman remains valid everywhere. The goal of the true Advaita
Vedantin is to internalize this realization in all states, including waking
and dreaming. The return to the three "normal" states belongs to the body,
the anAtman, but once Brahman-realization arises, the jIva, the Atman,
stops identifying itself with the anAtman.
