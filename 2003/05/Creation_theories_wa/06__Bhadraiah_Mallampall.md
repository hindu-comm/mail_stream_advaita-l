Namaskar,

Anything that is poorNam is equal to anything else that is also poorNam.
vishva alone is not poorNam but vishva along with the objects that vishva
sees becomes poorNam, which equals THAT. When guru teaches tatvamasi, the
teaching is not about the limited jIva being equal to THAT, but about how
the jIva that sees itself as complete is equal to THAT.

Best regards
Bhadraiah
