This is an extremenly important point, because if it's
correct, then most of Ramanuja's "refutation" of
advaita amounts to nothing more than misunderstanding
of the advaitin's viewpoint.

Just one more doubt -- are the following points made
by Ramanuja in his "Summary of the advaitin's
position" true at all?

(1) "nirguNa texts are of greater force than saguNa
texts."
Ramanuja claims that, according to the advaitin, the
shruti texts describing Brahman as nirguNa occur
subsequent to those that describe Brahman as saguNa.
Now, since the "latter" always sublates the "former",
the nirguNa texts are of "greater force" ("more
valid"?) than saguNa texts.

(2) "Scriptures are of greater force as against direct
perception".
Manifoldness is perceived due to beginningless and
*defective* avidya. Scripture is beginningless and
*defect-free*, hence it can sublate this knowledge of
manifoldness (basically because avidya is defective
and scripture is not).

Ramanuja spends a great amount of effort trying to
"refute" the above points, which he claims constitute
important parts of the advaitin's thesis.

Thanks,
