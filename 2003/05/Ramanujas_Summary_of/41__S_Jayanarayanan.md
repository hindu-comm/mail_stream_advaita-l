Can you find me a single Upanishhadic statement that
*discredits* abheda? There are several that discredit
bheda (e.g. B.U. 4.4.19, 2.4.14, 4.5.15).

The upanishhads discredit bheda alone.

If Shankara downplays bheda, it is due to the fact
that the principal upanishhads themselves, though
favoring both abheda and bheda, repeatedly disfavor
bheda, while *never* disfavoring abheda. Shankara
simply remains steadfastly loyal to the upanishhads,
unlike Ramanuja, who, though well aware of the
disapproval accorded to bheda in the shruti, yet keen
on propounding his theory, proceeds to concoct a new
category:

Give me a definitive statement in the 10 principal
unpanishhads that specifically disfavors
non-difference, and I will completely subscribe to all
of Ramanuja's views.

One interesting point about Ramanuja's shrI bhaashhya
is that he quotes from the VishNu PuraaNa way more
than any other text -- including any upanishhad or
even the GItA. OTOH, Shankara primarily uses only the
upanishhads and the GItA, seldom quoting other texts.
Evidently, Ramanuja prefers a sectarian reading into
the Brahma suutra via the VishhNu purANa.

The answer to the question, "If there is only one book
that I should study, what would it be?" is, as per the
shrI VaishhNavas, the VishhNu PuraaNa. According to
the Shankaran tradition, it is the MANDUkya upanishhad
(with GauDapaada's KArikA and Shankara's
sub-commentary). The difference is rather telling.
