Namaskaaram Sri Jayanarayanan ji,

Such a criticism of vishishTa advaita against advaita, if true, is invalid.
The most important idea for nirguNa brahman comes from the *neti neti* of
the brihadAraNyaka upanishad. THE UPANISHAD ITSELF SAYS THAT THERE IS NO
BETTER DESCRIPTION THAN THIS. Which means, other descriptions like *satyam
jnanam anantam brahma*(found in the taittiriya upanishad) must be second
best.(Is there any other way?) Otherwise sruti will be contradicting itself.
Thus, any allegation against advaitin in this matter amounts to allegation
against the brihadAraNyaka upanishad itself. :-)

>Manifoldness is perceived due to beginningless and

Sri Adi Shankara says that thousands of sruti statements cannot make a black
crow white. Sruti never says anything that contradicts our sense experience.
It talks about stuff which are BEYOND our sense experience. Afterall if
sruti just repeats what we perceive, then what is the use of
sruti?????????????????

I believe other learned members of this forum can throw more light on this
matter.

Best Regards
Kalyan
