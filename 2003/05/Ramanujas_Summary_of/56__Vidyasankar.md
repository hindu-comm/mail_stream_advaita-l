Yes, I would quite agree with that. Each of our systems of thought is
highly internally consistent and has its own value. Of course, when viewed
in terms of which school of Vedanta best succeeds in interpreting the
source texts, each person has his or her own opinion, based largely on the
individual understanding of the texts themselves.
