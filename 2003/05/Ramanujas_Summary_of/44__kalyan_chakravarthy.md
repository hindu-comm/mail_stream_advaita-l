I would suggest the brihadAraNyaka upanishad.

If you are going to read only one book, then it better be sruti. And one
that is going to tell you all aspects of vedanta. I think the Br.U satisfies
this. May be, the bhagavad gIta is another strong contender.

If you read any non-vedantic book, you might be going against vedanta
without your knowledge.

A book which follows vedanta perfectly is vivekachUdamaNi. But if you read
the vivekachUdAmaNi first and then read vedanta next, you may not be able to
appreciate the harmony between them. Always read atleast some upanishads or
the gIta before going to non-vedantic texts.

Best Regards
Kalyan
