However, why place all of it at the same level, when each Sruti statement
itself tells us of the hierarchy in which it is placed? If we impose a
distinction between substance and attribute, between body and soul, in the
state of moksha also, then that is what directly contradicts the Sruti
statement, neha nAnAsti kiMcana.
