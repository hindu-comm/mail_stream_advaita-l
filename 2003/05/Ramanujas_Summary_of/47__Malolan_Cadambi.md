Quiet true. The VishhNu purAnam was the first of the original purAna
samhitams revealed by Brahma, in the state of sattva. This was expanded
later by respective sages and redracted by Vyasa who also redracted the rest
of the prasthana traya.

It is due to this, that the VishhNu purAnam is called "purAna ratnam". I
notice that Rbhu gIta found in the VishhNu puranam is cited as proof of
existence of a pre-Sankaran advaita here :

Yes, the Karunakaran swami you heard is the same mentioned in the bhakti
list. He is very well known for lectures on Swami Desikan's stotrams
(litanys) on Sharanagati and other topics.
