This has been the position of a few modern scholars of the Vedantic
schools. Indeed, John Grimes of Michigan State University, who has a very
keen understanding of Advaitic texts, has an extensive discussion of
Ramanuja's "sapta-vidha-anupapatti" criticism of Advaita, and he says that
the Visishtadvaitins misunderstand key features of Advaita thought.

ps. I know that the different approaches taken to interpreting Sruti are an
age-old problem between the two schools, and that we are not going to
resolve any of the serious debating points between them on this forum.
