Ok.  I can certainly concur with such a view.  What I'm leery of is
attempts to reduce the Puranic stories to an abstraction.  To some extent
Campbell was guilty of this too.  As a follower of Jung, he believed all
religions could be reduced to "universal archetypes."  But the compelling
power of these stories is that the hero doesn't have a thousand faces he
has _one_.  One face that we are intimately familiar with.
