Sankara Jayanti is on the fifth lunar day (pancamI) of the light fortnight
(Sukla paksha) of the second month (viSAkhA) in the Indian lunar calender.
This year, this falls on Tuesday, May 6.

Ramanuja Jayanti, which is calculated according to nakshatra ascendance
(ArdrA), if I am not mistaken, also falls on the same day this year.
