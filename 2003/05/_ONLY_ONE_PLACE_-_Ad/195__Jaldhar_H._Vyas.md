Yes these rules were systemized in the Purva Mimamsa Darshana of Maharshi
Jaimini.  Vedanta is the Uttara Mimamsa and all Vedantic darshanas
including Advaita accept the validity of these rules for Vedic
interpretation though they disagree about their relative place.

Advaita Vedanta for instance thinks that adhyaropa-apavada is superior for
the knowledge of Brahman.  However Upakrama etc. are used when
appropriate.

There are discusiions of this in the Brahmasuta and upanishadbhashyas but
the real systematic exposition is in the works ofSureshvaracharya
particularly sambandhavarttika which is the first part of
brhadaranyakopanishadvhashyavarttika.  According to tradition
Sureshvaracharya in his purvashram was Mandana Mishra the dean of
Mimamsakas in Shankaracharyas time.

I'll try and post about this later.
