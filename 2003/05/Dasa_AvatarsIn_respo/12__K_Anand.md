Dear Kalyan

Please recall Sankara's last message addressed to his disciples in Sopana
Panchakam or Sadhana panchakam - It starts with Vedo nithyam adheeyathaam.
Hope u get the point. And also note that knowledge springs from avidya. You
clean a gold vessel with dirty ash and not powdered gold. All sources of
knowledge available to us are in the plane of Maya (avidya). And if u think
u are talking in a different plane where there is only Pure Satchidananda
<WINK> God help u. Dont try to make Shri Sankara's teachings as compatible
to neo-vedanta. And all the upanishads which u vedantins hold in awe is part
of Vedas (Avidya for u). Take it or leave it.

Vedo Akilo dharma moolam
Vedo nithyamadeeyatham
Vedo rakshati rakshataha

Regards
Anand K
