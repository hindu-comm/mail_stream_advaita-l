Namaskaaram,

If you say advaita is avidya, then according to the IshAvAsya Upanishad, all
advaitins are going to go to andhaM tamas. Are you ready to accept that?
Anyway, read Sri Adi Shankara's commentary on I.U. He interprets the avidya
of IU to mean rituals. avidya can have many meanings. An aspirant of the
status of hiraNyagarbha, is addicted to vedic rituals which come under the
scope of karma kanda. So, when I said avidya, I meant karma kanda. The karma
kanda portion is rejected as producing no liberation.(That is true actually
and it does make sense.)

Best Regards
Kalyan
