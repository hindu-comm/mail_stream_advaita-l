Hello Stig Lundgren,

  i hope you will fully agree with me that the Isavayopanishad 
Commentary of Sri Sankaracharya translation into English by Swami 
Sachidanandendra Saraswathi is a good work.

  i have come to know that the swamiji has also written, a 
translation, (incomplete) for the Kena Upanishad, remaining 
unpublished...

  Bad luck for the readers.
