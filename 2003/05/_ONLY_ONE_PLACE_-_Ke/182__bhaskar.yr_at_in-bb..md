i have come to know that the swamiji has also written, a
translation, (incomplete) for the Kena Upanishad, remaining
unpublished...

  Bad luck for the readers.

  >  praNAm prabhuji, Hare Krishna,

  Adhyatma Prakasha Karyalaya, H.N.Pur,  has published some books in
  kannada including commentaries on kEna, prashnOpanishat by Sri Lakshmi
  Narasimha Murthy, direct desciple of Sri Swamiji.  Apart from this
  commentaries on mahAnArAyaNa upanishad, rudra prashna, chamaka prashna,
  sri sUkta & prabOdha sudhAkara are also available in kannada.   Just FYI.
  Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
