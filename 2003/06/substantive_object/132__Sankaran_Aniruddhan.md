namaste Sri Sadananda,

Thank you for your explanation. But I am still confused as
to why all schools assume that there is a substantive
different from the qualities. Is there a logical reason
for this? Is the other position (absence of substantive)
quite close to the buddhist position that nothing really
exists?
