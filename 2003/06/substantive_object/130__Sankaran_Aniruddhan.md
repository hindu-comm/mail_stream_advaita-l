namaste Sri Sadananda,

Does there exist a substantive for any object which is different from its
qualities? Any external object can be grasped only through the senses. If
you take a jar, it can be defined as being made of a particular material,
having a particular shape etc. The qualities are obviously not unique to the
jar itself since another object can be made from the same material, or you
can create another object using a different material and same shape but
which will not be mistaken for a jar at any time. So the jar is just the
aggregate of the different attributes and that is the inherent "jarness". I
don't see why it needs to have, or does have, a "jarness" inherent to
itself. Maybe I'm missing something here.
