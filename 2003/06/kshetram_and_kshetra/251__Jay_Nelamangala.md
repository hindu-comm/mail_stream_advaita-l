Dear Sadaananda,

Namaste.   I would like to know what exactly you mean
when you say something is notional, and something is factual.

What exactly is meant by jivAtman is 'notional' ?  
Does it mean it is just in 'thinking'?
or does it mean it is only described that way in Agama?

Does something that is 'notional' ever become 'factual' ? or
Will notional stay notional for ever?  Conversely,
Can  factual ever become notional ?

Also what would be the equivalent shAstraic terminology for
these two terms.

Help me out.
