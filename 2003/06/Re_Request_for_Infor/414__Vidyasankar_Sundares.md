I don't think there are any proper translations as such for either of these 
books. However, there is a free English rendering of the bhedadhikkAra, by 
S. S. Suryanarayana Sastry and T. M. P. Mahadevan, published in 1934 by 
Univ. of Madras, which should be in libraries or available with old 
booksellers.
