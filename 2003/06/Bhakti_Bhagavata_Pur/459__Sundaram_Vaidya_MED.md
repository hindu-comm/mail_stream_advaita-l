Namaskaram.
 I think the focus of the list is better served by respecting the
acharyas of today as faithfully carrying out the sampradaya of Shri
Shankaracharya. Some of these may have existed even before Shri Adi
Shankara, and some may have been modified/codified by Him. To go further
into purefly academic debates on what words were used and what
"theretically" seems more likely is pointless. We would all do ourselves
a huge favour by trying follow them. The Panchaayatana puja is one
example of this.

 Shri Anantaraama Dikshidhar has given a parable many times in his
discourses for such questions & discussions: a man who is about to die
by snake bite is offered a medicine, and told the medicine was hugely
potent because the medicine was given (discovered) by a great scholar of
the past. The man does not have the luxury of questioning its veracity.
He either takes it to live, or chooses to die in ignorance - we are in
this state.

 Let us please shy away from these types of topics and instead focus on
studying the bhashyas. Here again I am sure some wonderful scholar will
throw doubt on whether shankara wrote this book or that poem or such
silly thing. My point is: if it is usefull, and does not discredit or do
dis-service to The Acharya, lets just go study it and follow it.

i am again sorry if this begins a lugubrious lucubration....

the Great Bhashyakara mentions Narayana, Vishnu, Vasudeva..etc.
everywhere for Brahman.  many hold that he was a very great Narayana
Bhakta.  where is then Siva Panchayatana 

could anyone explain pl.



Thanks & Regards,
Venkat.

Sadgurubhyo Namah.
