i Agree on Principle with this, that as Vidyashankar has rightly pointed out, if we need a medicine, we have to take it now, no luxury of questioning the veracity.

In any case, i find (Sorry if this hurts anyone) that the Great Acharya Pada's Bhakti that i see from his mentioning Vishnu as Brahman everywhere in the Prasthana Treya Bhashyas, that he is a Great Bhakta, a true devotee, notwithstanding the loud protestation of the dualists schools to the contrary.




Thanks & Regards,
Venkat.

Sadgurubhyo Namah.
