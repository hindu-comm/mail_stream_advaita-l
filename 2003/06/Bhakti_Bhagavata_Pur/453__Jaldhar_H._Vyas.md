That was bad phrasing on my part.  The Advaita view is that the highest
form of Bhakti is to know ones true Self which is jnana.  But my point was
jnana is the ultimate goal of any spiritual practice, they cannot be split
off into seperate compartments.

Interestingly, A commentary on the Bhagavata Purana is also ascribed to
Chitsukhacharya though it has not yet been recovered to my knowledge.

Exactly.

I beg to differ.  The Bhagavata Purana also teaches an Advaitic message.
Swami MS also teaches that the highest Bhakti is jnana.

He has however quoted the Vishnu Purana.

No he didn't.  There is a tradition that Bhagavan Lakshmi-Nrsimha were his
ishtadevatas.  He did however establish sphatika-linga and Shrichakra in
his Mathas and various other places.  And he did also start the practice
of panchayata puja in which all the major Vedic Gods are worshipped.
