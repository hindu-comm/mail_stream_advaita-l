i am again sorry if this begins a lugubrious lucubration....

the Great Bhashyakara mentions Narayana, Vishnu, Vasudeva..etc. everywhere for Brahman.  many hold that he was a very great Narayana Bhakta.  where is then Siva Panchayatana 

could anyone explain pl.


Thanks & Regards,
Venkat.

Sadgurubhyo Namah.
