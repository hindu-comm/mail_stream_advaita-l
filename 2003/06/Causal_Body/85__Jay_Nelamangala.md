Dear sadAnanda,

>only attributes and not the substantive. 

That is right ! in the case of a white towel,  form is rectangular
and color is white,  neither is substantive.   Agreed.

>Each sense can only sense the  qualities but not substantive. 

What about the sense of touch.  What do you touch when you
touch a towel?.  Its attributes?.

You touch the upAdAna fibres of the towel,  which is the
substantive.   So how can you say each sense can only sense the
qualities and not substantive?

Please clarify.
