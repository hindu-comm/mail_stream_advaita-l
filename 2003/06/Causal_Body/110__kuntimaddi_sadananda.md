Jay - You take your own time.  Because it is you who brought the
question of saakshee A and saakshee-D and knowledge-A and knowledge-D,
and flooding the list with criticisms of Advaita without clearly
understanding its tenants, questioning the lack of attributes of Brahman
and how one can do Nirugunopaasana, etc.  Although the truth is beyond
logic, shaastra-s are not illogical. Adhyaasa as explained by Bhagavat
paada Shankara  is self-contained and is very clear.  There is no way
one can improvise it, unless of course one does not understand what it
says in the fist place.    Vidhya has brought out several of your
misunderstandings in his responses. 

Since you are claiming that dwaita is superior to advaita and you want
to synthesize all the models using your notion of samanvaya, declaring
that advaita does not have it, I am forcing the issue how do you
establish the reality of the universe to start with- since fundamental
tenants of dwaita is jagat satyam, jiiva satyam and parmaartha satyam. 

Take your own time Jay but think also before you flood the list with
poorly understood concepts.


Hari OM!
