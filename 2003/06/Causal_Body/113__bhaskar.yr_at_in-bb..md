praNAm Sri Sadananda prabhuji
Hare Krishna

I have a small doubt here prabhuji, since in deep sleep state there is no
mind & its vruttis, so atman will be in prAgna rUpa or in  swaswarUpa
without any contacts with material adjuncts (antahkaraNa). But from this
state of non-duality how he (??) comes back to other two states i.e. jAgrat
& swapna,  what causes him to switch over from sushupti to swapna & jAgrat.
What is the difference between sushupti & samAdhi?  how people who had the
experience of samAdhi can come back again to this material world inspite
one of these samAdhi states described as nirbIja, nirvikalpa samAdhi.  ( I
am not questioning the savikalpa or saviShEsha samadhi in which duality
maintained).  Where this avidyA lEsha resides when one in deep sleep &
samAdhi.  Kindly clarify my doubt.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
