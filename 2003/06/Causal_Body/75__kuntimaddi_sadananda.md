Krishna that exactly is my question when one says I perceived an object?
How does one perceive the substantive? 

Object has the qualities that do not mean object is the same as
qualities? One is an attribute and the other is substantive. The
relation between the two as Jay has recognized is assumed. There is a
fundamental problem involved in perception of the substantive? That is
the reason why epistemology is intimately connected to ontology in our
philosophies.

- Krishna, you are not answering the question - there is a jump in the
process - First one needs to recognize the fundamental problem involved
-By skipping it one cannot arrive at solution to the problem.  We need
to look carefully what exactly the process involved when we say there is
an ring or jar out there.

I will definitely address the problem once we identify the problem in
the perception.

Right. Observation is an experience involving experienced, experiencing
and experiencer. We are trying to understand the whole process is it
not?

No Krishna - experience is not listed of the six or one of the three 
pramaaNas. And rightly so.  Proper analysis of the experience can lead
to prama and that analysis is pramaaNa. PramaaNa is that gives you
knowledge. Experience can lead to knowledge if it is supported by valid
pramaaNa.

That is exactly my original question - where and when does that senses
input, manas and saakshee enter into the equation according to
Knowledge-D and Saakshee-D?

Krishna - My request to you is to keep following the discussion between
Jay and myself and enter when you find there is misrepresentation of
dwaita position.  Jay wants to get to the bottom of this by his series
of adhyaasa theories finding fault with the advaitic concept. I have no
problem if something is wrong in Advaita, but before one ventures into
the criticism of a well established theory, one should understand it
correctly too. 

Keep watching.

Hari OM!
