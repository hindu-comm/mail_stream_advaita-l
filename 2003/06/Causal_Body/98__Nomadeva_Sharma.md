I honestly don't think that there is a problem in
saying one explanation is better than another
(ofcourse, the personal element of 'mine vs yours'
will spoil it). It is not the desire to put down
another school of thought, but I think analyses should
not shy away from such results.

Btw, I haven't read any article on adhyAsa at all.

Well, here's one's thought process:

Facts:
A. One of the stages is A person get to deep-sleep.
B. Senses, brain are not working in deep sleep.
C. As soon as the person gets up, he exclaims 'hey, I
thought I slept for such a long time, but it is not
even ...'.

Derivations or inferences:
A. The person had some idea, correct or wrong, of time
in deep sleep.

Conclusion: Whatever goes to deep-sleep also has a
knowledge of time.

Now, I am not sure what you could call as explanation
here. AFAI see it, there is no explanation at all.
There is a naming ceremony, however. We refer to
'Whatever goes to deep-sleep' as sAkshi.

I have answered this in another mail.

The analysis I could do is included above.

Which is an assumption here? That object and
attributes are V-identical?

I have heard that this is the argument that shrIharSha
uses against the general definitions using laxaNas.
His point is that using the idea of laxaNa, one cannot
obtain both sajAtIya-vijAtIya bheda. (I am quoting
from faint memory; need to check this up).

Btw, I don't think it should be difficult to find the
'primary keys' for any entity. In other words,
'asAdhAraNa laxaNa' can be found out, though it will
be difficult for a non-biologist to come with the
same.

Sadananda garu, what are you saying? You just said a
few mails back that the substantive is an assumption.
And that it is only qualities that are perceived? 

Actually, why are you bothered about 'measuring'
potness? The question is whether you can grasp or
determine potness? The answer is yes. Just go by the
facts and do not go by assumptions.

The matter as it stands is that you have read much
more than intended. My point was that it is such a
logical concept that it behooves one to accept it. If
you don't think so, you should simply point it out.
Ofcourse, the very point in discussion is to why there
are other 'well-meaning' theories possible. Without
showing any such contrary theory and to assume that it
was my justification to include only well-meaning
theories, that it borders on fanaticism... That is
certainly not a well-meaning response.

I am hoping that you will cover this in your article.
