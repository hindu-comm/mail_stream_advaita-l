Your question presumes that (i) there exists something
called object and that (ii) object is different from
qualities. How did you percieve all this, while
maintaining that senses cannot grasp the substantive?

Through the same sense that you perceive this mail,
without doubting if it is actually a mail or a rope or
a snake.

How is this 'fundamental epistemological issue'
perceived?

Certainly, but if model cannot explain, that does not
mean observation is not real.

I am not sure what all has been told, but this is just
not sakshee-D (and AFAIK, not even sakshee-A). How can
anybody say that experience is not a pramANa for a
school that holds 'na cha anubhava virodhe Agamasya
prAmANyaM'?

Wrong. With that idea (if it has been conveyed thus so
far), there wouldn't be any difference between sAkshI
and manas. 

Pls note that my intention is not to uphold the dvaita
position or anything of that sort. However a brief
glance at this exchange makes it obvious the dvaita
position is either mis-conveyed or mis-understood
(similar to what Madhusudana Saraswati felt of Sri
Vyasatirtha's criticisms).

Krishna
