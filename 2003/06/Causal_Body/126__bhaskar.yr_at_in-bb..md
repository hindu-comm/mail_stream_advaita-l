praNAm prabhuji,
Hare Krishna

In reply to Sri Krishna Ghadiyaram prabhuji you wrote :

I don't think Swami Dayananda Saraswati means what you have stated.
Happiness is also a state of understanding that 'I am' as "I am' not as
I am 'this' or that including karaNa shariira ?

>  prabhuji,  what is this kAraNa SharIra, how can it be described?? In
stUla SharIra we have physical body, in sUkShma SharIra we have mind &
intellect.  Is kAraNa SharIra is *aham* vrutti?? has Sri Shankara anywhere
explained this kAraNa sharIra in bhAshyas??  if the kAraNa SharIra is
*ahamkAra* or *asmat* pratyaya, then how brahma jnAna is explained as
*asmat pratyaya gOchara* in brahma sUtras...pls. clarify.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
