Before you go to the next step Jay - tell us how you apprehend an
object? and how do you apprehend space and time? - before you establish
the existence of the object as sat or real? Do not assume - give us
details of the perception of the object before we can establishe as real
and therefore it is the right knowledge? How does the perception of the
object takes place? who perceives it and how and when and where does
saakshee come into picture to validate or invalidate. Go step by step
and take your time and educate us this process. 


I cannot go into details of the your norms of real 'this spirit of
consideration' - not knowing on what basis that spirit of consideration
has been established - since what you consider obviously has
ramification of sat and asat.  I can not go futher until the perception
of the object, space and time are clear since you seem to imply them all
at once.

Hari OM!
Sadananda
