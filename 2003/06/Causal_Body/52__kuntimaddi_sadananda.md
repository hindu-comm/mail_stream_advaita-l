Srikrishna,

Here is my understanding.

kartRitva and bhoktRiva are bhaava-s or notions in the mind.  Hence
should be there when the mind and intellect are functioning - that is
when manomaya and vijnaanamaya are functioning.  In deep sleep both  are
 folded since in that state there are no thoughts and notions that I am
the thinker or enjoyer are also not there. 

'That I enjoyed sleep' is also a statement of the intellect of the waker
about the sleep - but the intellect was not there to claim that I was
there to enjoy.  From my understanding "who slept well' during deep
sleep  also comes under the category of anirvachaniiyam - since vachanam
comes at the level of the intellect only - therefore only notional.  

To account for the deep sleep I am more comfortable with the statement
of what Swami Tejomayanandaji made. - this is only since you wanted some
comments.

I will be careful in the attempts since - the basis of the analysis and
conclusion is by intellect during the waking state and any conclusion
about the deep sleep state will invariably a conditional conclusion. As
long as the limitations of the intelect is understood, there is no
problem.

Srikrishna - They way I understood is in the combination of the
individuals into collective - the combination occurs by dropping the
rajasic and tamasic attributes that differentiates (which are mutually
contradictory and hence unmatching) and bringing together only the
satvic aspects since only love, purity alone can combine (since they are
integrating factors and not dividing factors). Take for example - KKK
organization - based on white supremacy.  They differentiate the
non-white but to have combined into one organization they have to have
love towards a common goal.  Thus love brings them together so that they
can hate the non-whites as one unit. If there is no love of unity the
organization will split into many. Hence in totality only saatvic guna
prevails and in differentiation - the others guNas will become more and
more predominate.  Anyway this is only an explanation for the
questioning mind.

No. the prakRiti  manifests with sajaati vijaati swagata bedha-s as the
perception of the plurality becomes increasing recognizes as reality -
that is maya now manifesting 'as though' real and that is the notional
ignorance.  

Hari OM!
