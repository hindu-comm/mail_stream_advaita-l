I will try to clarify.

Knowledge of what?  if it is knowledge of external objects then it is
knowledge of mind only  that sAkshii illumines.

Always.  When the sense-organ-mind generates knowledge,
the knowledge is grasped by sAkshI along with its truth,  under normal
circumstances.   When the mind has doubts about the knowledge,
the sAkshi-D only grasps knowledge and not its truth - for lack of
consistency and successfulness.

Without sAkshii means that person is dead.   So your question does
not arise.

Two kinds of knowledge - vritti and svaroopa.

vritti - produced by manas and sense organs
svaroopa - produced by sAkshi.

vritti type of knowledge is apprehended by sAkshI and sAkshI is
self luminous.

If the conditions are defective,  mind produces doubtful knowledge of
external objects.  sAkshI-D perceives that knowledge only but not its
truth.   When the mind has no doubts,  sAkshI-D perceives knowledge
along with its truth.  Thus,  sAkshI-D always perceives true knowledge.

No.  There is only one knowledge.  Second question does not arise at all.
Feed it only with  knowledge that is consistent with other pramANaas.
Don't feed it with knowledge that is inconsistent with experience and
knowledge
that is internally inconsistent.
Then, why not?.

If all your life,  you have been taught that "rope is really poisonous and
it bites"
then although,  your sAkshee-D  helps you with the truth of knowledge in
snake-rope confusion,  that it is only a rope,  but still  you won't pick up
the rope.
Your sAkshI-D is not going to make you pick up the rope.  But,  if you had
bothered to go with pramANas and not  with abhimAna that "rope is
poisonous",
then you would have rejected that idea soon after it was taught to you.
