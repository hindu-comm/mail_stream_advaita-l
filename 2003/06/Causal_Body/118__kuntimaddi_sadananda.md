Baskarji - I just wrote an exhaustive answer to Srikrishnaa's mail and
some of what you asked is included in that- Please study the answer and
if there is still some questions - I will try to address them to the
best I can.

In principle I am experiencing aatma all the time  but I mistake it some
thing else since I take myself as I am this upaadhi- to start.

Tamo guna is not vRitti of the mind - it is the qualities of the
prakRiti - and ignorance is the tomo guna and knowledge is the nature of
the satva guna and activity is the nature of rajo guna. They are there
all the states as long as prakRiti is there.  They manifest differently
in each state of experience.  When I am studying - satva guna is
predominating and when I am lethargic and sleepy - tamo guna is
predominating and when I am running around then rajo guNa is
predominating.

nirvikalpa ananda as understood in samaadhi is different from just lack
of vikalpa or thoughts as in deep sleep or when one is drugged. In both
cases absence of mind is there.  In nirvikalpa one is aware of the
absence of thoughts in that state itself.  In deep sleep one is not
aware of oneself.

In dream we only project what we know based on the waking state. Have
you ever created 'gaagabuubu' in your dream? What is that? Well you have
not obviously since you have no knowledge of gagaabuubu. What you dream
is reflections of your samskaara from the waking or in the previous
waking states - the impressions of which you have.

The difference between waking and dream is the intellect in the dream is
not in its highest potential - hence it is only a bhoga bhuumi - only
exhaust your vasana-s and not collect more.

Yes they are different - the dream is the creatiing of the waking mind
and the waking world is the creation of the total mind (consists of all
the waking miinds put together) - you can say - one is a subjective-
objective world and the other is objective-objective world. They are
parallel but identical.  

Hari OM!
