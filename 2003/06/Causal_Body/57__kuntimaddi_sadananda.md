Here is the case where typing mind has their own mind! - may be a new
class of adhyaasa that jay should consider!

What I wanted to write was unhappiness aries with VRitti and taking the
vRitti as real. Absence of unhappiness is just the absence of thoughts
as in deep sleep. I am happy  (not that I have happiness)is the
knowledge arises when notional 'i' drops with clear understanding of
true 'I' 

Hope it is clear now.
