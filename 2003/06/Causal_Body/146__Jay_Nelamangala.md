There are couple of minor corrections here.

1) "samanvaya"  is not from vyOma-samhitaa,  it is from brihat-samhitaa.
2) I quoted vyOma-samhitaa to understand how the word "bhakti" shows up in
shruti.
3) I am not claiming that I do,  but  I am only saying my school does.
4) VPS, Sri BhAshya and nyAya sudhA ??  -  you are comparing oranges and
apples

Sri bhAshya - is the rAmAnujeeya  brahma-sootra-bhAshya
nyAya-sudhA by Sri Jayatheertha is the commentory on anuvyAkhyAna by Sri
Madhwa.
Sri Madhwa has written four works on sootra-prasthAna.
1) Brahma-sootra-bhAshya 2) anyvyAkhyAna 3) nyAya-vivaraNa 4) aNu-bhAshya

VPS is an independent work by Sri VidyAraNya,  based on vivaraNa of
prakAshAtman
which is a commentory on pancha-pAdikaa  of Sri PadmapAda which is a
commentory
on Sri Shankara bhAshya.

This is what I meant when I said apples and oranges.
