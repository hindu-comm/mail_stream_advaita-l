Probably, your observation is not correct. If mind was
the seat of kartrutva and bhoktrutva, there should be
none to claim the deep sleep experience. But, on
waking up, we say "I was Happy. I had a sound sleep".
Unless Bhoktrutva is there, there would not have been
a claimant on waking up. We know that 'Karana
Sareera', whatever it be exists in all the three
states.  Probably that is the reason Swami Dayananda
explained that the Bhoktrutva is part of Karana
Sareera. Unfortunately, he did not elaborate. Also, we
can not say that during deep sleep there is no mind,
because Priya, Moda, Pramoda are Vrittis of mind only.
