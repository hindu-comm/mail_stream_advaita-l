Hai Jay 

Greetings. Why do I want to complicate my life unnecesorily with your
two saakshi-s.  One Sakshee A can do all the job needed for me- I do not
need another saakshi-D. If I do, I will definitely ring you up, since
yours is a local call. 

By the by, I am familiar with complicated theory of two saakshii-s of
dwaita and rejected that concept as it did not appeal to me.  

What you call sakshii-D is the 'ego', who is the false guy. This is what
bimba-pratibimba argument - or pot-space - total space concept.  He is
the result of adhyaasa that you are analysing. I am trying to get rid of
the fellow!

What you call saakshi-A is the absoulte consciousness which is reflected
as the 'ego' with in the antahkarana. Remember we are adviatins - no
need for two! The other fellow only appears and that is the essence of
adhyaasa.   If one can do, why bring a false guy to mess around! Just
joking.

By the by I did not have chance to study your adhyaasa articles. I will
do slowly and get back with you, if I need to.  I was hoping Vidhya will
be able to address the issues you have raised, if he finds time.  

Hari OM!
Sadananda
