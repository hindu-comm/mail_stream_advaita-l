namaste Sri Jay,

I had a couple of questions on parts of multiple posts and I have attached
them here. I do not intend to pursue these questions further though. This is
just to clarify my understanding.

But if a rope is seen as a snake in darkness, there is internal consistency
in this. So sAkshee-D assumes the knowledge is valid, but its really not
valid and sAkshee-D is gettin misled?

"yatO vAchO nivartantE" literally means "that from which speech recoils".
Shruti seems to be telling us literally that brahman cannot be expressed in
words and cannot be grasped through the mind. I don't see how this is
stretched to mean "Brahman cannot be known completely".
