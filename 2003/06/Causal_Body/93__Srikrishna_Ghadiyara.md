Why not ?? Give reasons. Do not just make a statement.
Property is a Property. Svarupa is not a property;
Property is not Svarupa. Heat is not a property of
fire; it is Svarupa of fire. But, you can add some
Diwali cracker substance and bring out some colors and
sounds, such sounds and smell and color do not fbelong
to fire.

You are digressing from the topic here. You are
abandoning your own statements. 

You said, "The acceptance of peculiarity (vishEsha) is
inevitable even for 
advaita,
though
advaita ignores it.  Advaita regards Brahman as
partless.  This implies 
that
partlessness is a property of It.   It is akhanda.  
So partlessness is 
not
different
from it.  Then the question is, "how can there be the
thought that
partlessness
is a property of Brahman? "
"

You do not have to postulate two distinct properties
such as Khandatvam and akhandatvam. Akhandatvam is
another way of saying khandatvam. So, you can not
attribute akhandatvam as an attribute of Brahman.
Instead say that khandatvam is a property understudy
and its measure in Brahman is '0'.

If we were to go by two distinct properties as said by
you above your Dvaita Sidhanta Brahman will become
such that 'akhandatvam' becomes His property !!

So, you are wrong.  Please read carefully, before you
contradict this.

Did Advaita say that there are two different
categories of objects and Brahman belongs to one
category and does not belong to the other ????

It says that both or any number, as you please, of
categories has ONLY ONE sad-vastu as its ESSENCE. Some
categories, evolutes of that sad-vastu have attributes
based on their form and name etc.

Wrong derivation. Your first definition itself is
rejected.

I as subject 'awareness' discern all attributes. I can
fully comprehend that vastness of attributelessness or
being in a state where all attributesness and
attributelessness is in me.

You are wrong again. You are denying your own
existance, akin to your dumbman. You are true to the
extent that you can not conceive ANOTHER Brahman apart
from you. The whole problem is coming because you are
looking for a Brahman different from yourself. It is
here and now, not some where else and at some other
time. Accept what is now - Because even for you
Dvaitin, Brahman can not be said to be 'not NOW'. So,
findout what is 'here and now' and that is
attributeless. The fact that inspite of all attempts
to find it in attributes, you fail at task. So, it is
attributeless. Because it is You !! The Awareness
principle, the Existance principle.

As 'I'. I conceived it as myself; none else.

You are wrong. I conceived the Same Dvaita Brahman
with attributeness where in the measure was '0'.

You are right. It did not say go to Vaikunta or
Kailasa to see Brahman. It said 'enquire', because he
wanted to say that it is 'here and now'.  It asks you
to enquire, so that it is what you do not even
consider it be !! Your ownself !!

Why is it so obvious to you ?? Infact why do you think
of 'Attributelessness' ? Think of 'Attributeness'
only. I am not enquiring about any 'entity' other than
me. Sootras say this enquiry is into the Truth or
Reality; whether it turns out to be an entity or not
does not matter. It turns out to be 'I' which is
beyond all attributes. All attributes are
superimpositions on me. I declare, I am not any thing
that you know which you can qualify with attributes.
The only way to know me is to be 'I'.

Who is questioning the 'Creator'. We are just
'enquiring' into reality. And we come to conclusion
that 'sadeva'. Later things are are derivations. That
'Sat' is the Existance principle; that Sat is
Consciousness principle; that Sat is 'Ananda'
principle; that Sat is everythingness principle; that
Sat is nothingness principle.

You are right. You start with an assumption that you
are enquiring into the 'Object' and endup concluding
that it is infact the subject. Surprisingly it is 'I'.

It is an object of enquiry, if the same 'object' is
the subject making the enquiry.

Say, Jay wants to enquire into the Svarupa/nature of
Jay, then 'Jay' becomes the Object and Subject. Infact
this what we are shouting all about. The Conscious
principle is 'Self-aware' it is 'Awareness' itself.
Otherwise, due to infinite regression the enquiry
would not have sustained itself.

I thought I was making it clear to you !!
