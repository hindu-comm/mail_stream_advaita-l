I do not think I am missing the point Krishna.  

There is no time or place concept in the deep Sleep State and that is
the universal experience.  The time he thought he slept and the time he
thought he really slept both come with the mind and mind is the
thoughts. In the absence of the mind there is no concept of time or
space.

Vidya has independently posed the same question - where are the indriyas
of Saakshii to perceive independent of the sense/mind/intellect -
suukshma shariira complex? 

Please clarify that pint, Krishna.

That is only misinterpretation of what actually happens. No mind, no
concept of time and space. This is not inference but factual experience
that need to be interpreted correctly.

For Advaitin consciousness, illumines the intellect thus mind and thus
indriyas etc.  What you call soul is just a notional I that is due to
apparent identification with the reflected consciousness in the buddhi.

You are absolutely right about that - which is exactly what I have been
pointing out.  In deep sleep there is no antaHkaraNa 'playing around'.
Since playing around involves 'time and space', they are also not there.
Adviatins are self-consistent with the universal experience and with
your above statement, as well. 

Saakshii has no other equipments to measure time and space. You may
invoke some swa indriya-s for Saakshii to justify your theory. That is a
postulation to support a theory.  

That also leads to another axiomatic statement that 'Saakshii' validates
the right and wrong knowledge on basis of samanvaya.

But if the indriya-s are defective and if one does not know that, the
info provided by the indriya-s are assumed to be right.  In what basis
Saakshii-D will validate or invalidate the knowledge provided by the
indriya-s. I need separate pramaaNa for that. I do not think this
question was answered or I might have missed the point.

May be, but my rejection is not on a wrong premise unless you can prove
to me that Saakshii has independent upaadhi-s to establish the time and
space. Also has the capability to validate what are Parma and bhrama and
on what basis?. How long Saakshii takes to declare that info that
bhoutika indriyas brought is right or wrong?  What pramaaNa does he use?
And how is his judgement  true if another Saakshii declares
independently that this Saakshii is wrong?  To whom does he reveal - to
the mind. But mind is already settled with the info it got from bhoutika
indriya-s. Do you have two independent knowers here. Krishna, please
unravel the puzzle step by step, just to make sure I am not
misinterpreting the role of Saakshii-D, even if do not agree with
postulations.
