Not so. The guarantee that knowledge-A is always true is determined for 
sAkshI-A by SAstra. As sureSvara puts it, "bodhAtma-vyatirekeNa na paSyati 
cid anvayAt". As SAstra itself puts it, "yatra tv asya sarvam AtmaivAbhUt, 
tat kena kaM paSyet ... ..."

So, no sublation of knowledge-A at a future time. If there is someone who 
thinks he had brahman knowledge at some point of time, which later got 
sublated, then the problem is merely that he has not really had pUrNa bodha. 
He has mistaken some vision as brahman knowledge. For those who have the 
certitude of knowledge-A, the question of sublation at a later time does not 
arise.

ps. Nice try, using labels -A and -D, but I'm not buying it.
