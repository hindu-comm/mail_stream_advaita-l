Here Atma is illuminer not as an external entity; it
is only by being one with it does Atma illumine
anAtma. What causes the mind to fold up ?? (Prakriti
going through creation-maintaining-destruction. I do
not have much comprehension, I am just writing). If it
is that the manifestation comes about because
consciousness 'wills', it should be so.

What is meant by 'presence of vasanas' ? If vasanas
are present, then mind should be there. In the
previous paragraph you should have said:

"Even if duality is not there, mind can exist". 

On the otherhad Where can prakriti go ? It has to go
back to "purusha", conscious principle. In such case
it can not have independent identity. I am just using
the anology of creation here.

Om Namo Narayanaya !!

Srikrishna
