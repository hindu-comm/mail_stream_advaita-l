Yes upto that are observations.

No that is not a fact - The person when gets up gets the idea of how
long he slept - If not he would not have to look at the watch to
conclude that "Oh My God I slept that long" - The time is measured in
the waking state before he went to sleep and after  got up from sleep. 
Hence the  a person has some idea of time in deep sleep state is a
inference and not a fact.

No it is not naming - there is assumptions and conclusions,  based on
the assmptions naming the conclusion.  All the sequences are involved if
you want to examine that carefully.
