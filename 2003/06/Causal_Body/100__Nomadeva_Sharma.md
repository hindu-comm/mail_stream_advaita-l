Oh no, you are missing the point. The person feels a
mismatch between the time he thought he slept for and
'actual' (for the want of a better term) time. 

This mismatch can occur only if there is some idea of
time in deep sleep. If there is no such idea, the
reaction would be that of ignorance, as it appears in
your statement: "Oh My God I slept that long".

I am not sure if you are aware that this too is
another point of contention: whether soul experiences
anything at all. The mismatch is explained by advaita
as a reaction of antaHkaraNa, I am told (I haven't
checked any source on this). However, that would come
under your assumptions category. Surely, when I go to
deep-sleep, I don't see any antaHkaraNa playing around
using my consciousness. (That was meant as pun)

We also hold that the soul experiences sukha that it
recounts later.

While your rejection of the conclusion was itself on
wrong premise, I just want to point here that we have
named not the only the conclusion, but something else.

As you like it.
