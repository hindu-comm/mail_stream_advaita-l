Bhaskarji - kaarana Shariira is the causal body - the title of this
thread.  you can find very detailed information in any text starting
from Tatva bhodha, or aatmabodha or vivekachuudaamani etc. 
Vivekachuudamani goes in to exhaustive details about the three
shariira-s and pancha kosha-s. 

Hari OM!
Sadananda
