This is a key place where we differ. We say the
visheShaNa and visheShya are not [absolutely]
identical, they are [visheShataH] identical. Your
objection that the idea of an object is an assumed or
inferred one does not apply to us, as we hold that
object and its properties (again, not all) are
[visheShataH] identical. Any well-meaning school would
do that, for, in the end, 'dravyatva' is also an
attribute.

That they are factual is also known by perception
(with a bit of anumAna-toppings), as you have yourself
said below:

There is a different idea that dvaitins follow:
yAvad-dravya-bhAvi (that which are co-eval with the
substance) and a-yAvad-dravya-bhAvi.

I had misunderstood your position, that you considered
the concept of substantive an illogical one. Hence all
that.

Now, coming to the point on whether substantive can be
grasped or not, it depends on the relation one assigns
to the object and its attributes. A school holding
'colorful identity' (as BNK Sharma puts it; though I
don't understand what is colorful about it) would say
every sense is perceiving the object or an aspect of
it.

As I mentioned earlier, all that I wrote was in
apprehension that you are denying the very idea of
substantive as illogical.

visheSha is not same as samavAya. Two key differences:

1. tArkikAs hold that there is only one samavAya:
samavAyastveka eva | We say there are
ananta-visheShA-s. That brings in an essential
difference in the way they operate.
2. samavAya and inherency [I think they call it
'apR^ithaksiddha'] assume differences between object
and its attributes. visheSha is different: abhede
bhedavyavahAra sAdhako visheShaH.

Thus, you should note that while tArkikas and [going
by your words] vishiShTadvaita others have accepted
some notion of 'thing in itself', while we reject the
possibility of such a notion. This, in a way, also
leads to our rejection of nirvikalpa-pratyabhij~nA
(and if you ask me, anybody accepting nirvikalpa
pratyabhij~nA is not far off from getting to either
advaita or buddhism).

Just to clarify what I have said: there is no
difference between substantive and attributes. Their
identity is not absolute, but through visheShas. So,
all perceptions involve the substantive, finally.

> The rest are all postulations.  

Yes.

> If this is not clear, the rest has no relavence. 

Actually I have lost the relevance of this thread. Can
you pls enlighten?

Krishna
