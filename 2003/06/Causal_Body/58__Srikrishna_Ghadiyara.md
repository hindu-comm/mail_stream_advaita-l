What does the word 'arises' mean in the above sentence
? Does it arise as a vritti ? In such case it is
another vritti different from the multiple-duality
vrittis.  EGO should identify with duality. Then,
duality vrittis should trigger another 'unhappyness'
vritti (which should get illumined by Self) and then
the EGO identifies with it and says "I am unhappy". It
means "unhappiness" is not duality but, non-acceptance
of duality and its triggering another vritti. Is this
based on punya phala ??!!

It is not !!  If there were clear understanding of
true 'I' how can it be lost on waking up ?
