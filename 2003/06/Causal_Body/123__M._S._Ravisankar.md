I think we should work with standard definitions. According to yoga,
karmaashaya is latent impression of action and vaasana is latent impression
of the feeling. vasana-s serve as field for the seed of karmashaya to grow
and come into fruition. I am saying this from my memory, if your refer to
Sri Hariharananda Aranya's book, he  discusses these issues in a great
detail.  If I find time, I will try to summarize or cut&paste relevant
paragraphs (as this book is on the netlibrary).
