Namaste Kathirasan-jI,

Good to hear form you again.  You are right.  Everyone has answers.

Yes, I am sure every school vedAntic and non-vEdAntic will have
their own answers on every question.   But  do those answers have
internal consistency is the question.   Either they will be contradicting
themselves, or they will be contradicting what is in prasthAna-traya.
That is why one has to filter out all these answers, and go with a
philosophy that is sound, that does not contradict other pramANas,
that does not contradict itself, and that is consistent with entire Veda.

They do this,  because they find the interpretation given to "tat tvam asi"
as "That thou art"  by advaita vEdaanta to be inconsistent with the context
in which it appears in the upanishat.

For an arrogant ShwEtakEtu,  his father is teaching  Brahma-vidyA.
That is the context of chAndOgya in which "sa AtmAtatvamasi" occurs.

ShwEtakEtu!  why are you arrogant? why do you think you know it all?
Don't you know that you are already the all knowing Brahman?
OR
ShwEtakEtu! why are you arrogant?  why do you think you know it all?
Don't you know how little you are in front of that all knowing Brahman?.

Which one of these meanings is "internally inconsistent" with our
experience,
inconsistent with the upanishadic context.   You decide which is admissible
and which is not.

Further,  the text itself can be split as "sa AtmA atat tvamasi" which makes
lot more sense in the context of the upanishat as "that thou art not".

Now you tell me why other Acharyas should not walk away and create their own
siddhAnta.?
