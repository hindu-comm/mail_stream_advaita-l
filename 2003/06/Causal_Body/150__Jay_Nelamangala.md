The word "dvaita"  was always there,  because it is a word coming from
upanishats.  Sri Shankara could not have studied  Madhwa-bhAshya on
upanishats,  geeta and sootras,  and therefore he could not have addressed
what you call today as "dvaita vEdaanta".   That is what I am trying to say.

Sri Shankara might have refuted some other  dvaita vEdaanta, which you think
is
the same as Madhwa siddhAnta.   If you tell me correctly,  what that other
"dvaita" that Sri Shankara has refuted, and the reasons he gives for
refuting it,
then for all we know,  it might be one of the schools that Sri Madhwa also
refutes!!

If you study "anuvyAkhyAna-nyAyasudhA-parimaLa" you
will see that Sri Madhwa has found fault with the 21 different
interpretations
that were given by other thinkers,  and  hence the need for his bhAshya
which is the 22nd one.  What Sri Shankara has refuted as "dvaita" could very
well be in one of these 21.   That is why calling Madhwa's school of thought
as dvaita may  not be appropriate, because "dvaita" and "advaita" are words
coming from the  upanishats,  and not from any school of thought.

Both nirIshwara and sEshwara sAmkhya are poorva-paksha to BAdarAyaNa
himself,   let alone to being poorva-paksha to dvaita-vEdaanta of  Sri
Madhwa.

sAkshI-D in dvaita-vEdAnta is not the same as purusha of sAmkhya either.
The sAkshI-D under discussion now,  is the jeeva-swaroopa.   This
jeeva-swaroopa does not create anything.   But the Creator in Seshwara
sAmkhya is the "nirlipta"  Creator,  who can't create anything by himself,
but can only do so only with Prakrti.  VedAntins reject sAmkhya because
what brings Purusha and Prakrti together, is unanswered in sAmkhya.

Thus, sAkshee-D and purusha of sAmkhya are not same.

So, when Sri Madhwa also has rejected  sAmkhya,  you can not claim that
Sri Shankara has rejected Madhwa while rejecting sAmkhya.

The same thing with yOga as well.
