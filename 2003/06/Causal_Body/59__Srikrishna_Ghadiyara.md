If vasanas constitute the Karana Sareera, and the
karana sareera is propelling all the time the other
two sareeras, accounting for  the waking behaviour, it
should apply to dream behaviour as well.  But, we seem
to be saying all the time that the dreams are based on
the experiences of waking state, implying without
explicit mention, of this life alone. And vasanas
themselves do not have an independent locus other than
what is called mind. So, mind should exist in sleep.

This is not a sufficient argument, because on waking
up we say, "I dreamt", assuming that the dreamer is no
different from the waker, because if it was not my
dream, I should not have known it, just like I do not
know your dream. Similarly, I say, "I slept". If it is
someone else who slept, I can not say, "I slept".

You seem to accept that there is recognition of the
dreamer in that experience. Factually, the dreamer
does not know himself as a dreamer. He knows himself
as a karta or WAKER of that state only.  

Similarly the "Sleeper" is no different from the
waker. 

In dream state I join 'myself' with the objects of
that state and express myself as a dreamer, in
relation to the dream world. Similarly,  I join myself
with the 'objects of the sleep world and express
myself as a sleepeer. But, the waker is not able to
understand that state because he can not now imagine
that 'objectless' sleep world, just as the waker would
imagine the same 'dream objects' in this waking state
and comprehend the nature of that dreamer. If the
waker can comprehend that objectless state in this
waking state, then he would recognise the sleeper as
well. This does not mean that there is no sleeper or
no experience of sleep. We know and recognise the
dream by reliving or remembering the experiences of
the dream state only. Similarly, now in this wakeful
state, we remember  the happiness of sleep state and
say I was happy in sleep. So, sleep happiness need not
be 'swarupa ananda' alone. Probably that is where
Priya, Moda, Pramoda, vrittis come into picture, along
with accounting for the happiness of the waking and
dream states. These three words have no other
understandable meaning  than the quantity of
joy/happiness they can give (leave aside the anology
of thinking , gaining and enjoying the object of
desire). Also, we know the the happiness is caused by
Punya. I do not remember the sanskrit sloka now, which
says that the happiness of the Punya purushas is
because of their punya phala etc. If it were Svarupa
Ananda it can not be described or limited by Priya,
Moda, pramoda etc. Ofcourse, we can not quantify the
happiness of sleep; neither it is different from day
to day, it is incomparable to happiness of waking
state. The results of the Punya are experienced even
in waking state as joy etc. We know those moments
where we are happy for no reason.

Since we know that 'Waker' and Dreamer are not the
same, we postulate a common-er. Hence the same
common-er should be the Sleep-er as well. So we say
Wake+er, Dream+er, Sleep+er make the three states, and
we say wake, dream, sleep is for the mind.

May be if I can simulate sleep in this waking state,
just like I simulate my dream in this waking state, I
will be 'Realised' !!!

Similar is the case about the dream state. It is
described as 'dream' only in the waking state.

It is not a conclusion of mind. How can I conclude
that I did not exist ?? So, the conclusion has to be
about the mind by the one who knows all the states of
the observed. Otherwise, we may become a Budhist of
flicker consciousness theory.

Your above statement may not hold good. Mind itself is
EGO-ness vritti (ahamkara) behind EGO. So, you can not
say if Mind is not there ....

I am familiar with this view/proposition. But, the
Punya purushas natural happiness is not because of any
absence of duality. We know happy people in the world
and none of them are in any non-daul state in common
life. Karana Sareera 'functions' in all the three
states.

This is what I was saying jnani's happiness is not
based on Priya. Moda, pramoda vrittis. So, the
happiness of sleep need not be svarupa ananda. It
might just be vrittigata punya phala.

Did you say it reverse ?

By the above statements it can only mean 'Witness'
attitude. It does not mean 'I am'; It would mean 'I am
witness' of presence or absence of vrittis. Probably,
'I am' is beyond that.

I meant may be "Unhappiness" is not a vritti, but
"Happiness" is a vritti, becasue Swami D, said
bhoktrutva of Sukha is Karana Sareera.

Om Namo Narayanaya !!!
