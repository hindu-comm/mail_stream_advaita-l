Krishna - these are presumptions. VisheshaNa and visheshya are different
and they are not identical - VisheshaNa may not exist independent of the
visheshya. That does not mean they are identical. There can be many
visheshaNa-s for a single object. Form is one attribute and color is
another, so is taste, smell - The very fact that each visheshaNa is
different from the other, establies that are related but not identical
with the substantive. 

Substance is what is referred to as dravya. Hence that they  are
identical is only a postulation and not factual. One is dharma and other
is dharmi. It is true that VisheshaNa or attribute should have a locus
or ashraya. The substantive is the dravya. These are some essential
visheshaNa-s and there are non-essential visheshaNa-s for an object. In
mathematicas we call them as incidental qualifications (tatasta
lakshaNa-s), necessory and the necessory and sufficient qualifications,
etc.

Not really - evey object has visheshanas and the substantive is
visheshya or draya or dharmi.  Fact of the matter is no way you can
grasp the substantive with senses. The rest are assumtions and
inferences.  This should be understood clearly. We take things for
granted and there lies the problem.

There is nothing false in the statements. Senses can only grasp the
form, color,sound,smell etc. Hence they are called maatra-s as they only
measure the degrees - eyes can measure the degree of shades in red or
green etc as diverget colors. 

Krishna - There is nothing new for me to delineate - this facts based on
the working of the senses and the mind. 

I am trying to draw your attention what actually happens in perception
and what is concluded, since conclusions involves further assumptions -
drawing the line between facts and postulations/inferences/conclusions
etc. 

I will present my postulations later!.  But first the problem is to be
understood.  That visheshana and visheshya are interrelated is known.
Tarkika-s have brought in 'samavaayu', a glueing factor, to account the
inseparatability of these two. Bhagavan Ramanuja and Shree Vedanata
Deshika have also postulated that one need not bringin unnecessorily
glueing factor  to account interdependency of the two. They called it
'inherency'.  Shree Madhva also rejected the glueiing factor and used a
differt term for the same thing.  Essential implications is the same in
both.  But these are just explanations or postulations of their
interdependency or to account for relationship between visheshaNa and
visheshya. 

But the fact remains that in perception senses can only grasp the
qualities not the substantive. The rest are all postulations.  

If this is not clear, the rest has no relavence. 

Hari OM!
