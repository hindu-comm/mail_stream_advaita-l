Jay - there are several fundamental problems in the model.

Question 1. First senses can only grasp the qualities of the object and
not the object (substantive)per sec. Qualities are different from the
object, right. Object has qualities but object is different from
qualities.    How is an object perceived and by what?  You say jarness
is perceived.  Jarness you have defined  as some imaginary quality but
what is that jarness - is it substantive or an antribute of an object. 
Mind cannot grasp the object out there without senses operating, right? 
It can only bring from the memory the image of the previously perceived
object.  So let us look at the first perception of the object. 

If five senses are not operating there is no way one can have any
perception of the object, right? The jarness is percived through what
sense and how?  Now you tell me how you can gain the perception of an 
object and its qualities to establish that there is object really out
there. This my friend is the fundamental epistemological issue. If this
answered satisfactorily then only one can go to the next step of the
reality and unreality of the object. If I cannot perceive the object how
can I establish the  validity of the knowledge of the object?  You can
have any model you want but the model has to explain the observations,
is it not? 

Question 2. you have not answered how saakshee perceives the time and
space either other than making an axiomatic statement that it is
perceived by saakshee since they cannot be perceived.  Remember
experience is not a pramaaNa even according to you - pratyaksha,
anumaana and shabda are only three pramaaNa-s for you. Now on what basis
or pramaaNa or means of knowledge saakshee perceives time and space
independent of senses, that needs to be established. 

Question 3. Is existence of the object  established because I perceive
it?  If I do not perceive  it  is the object there or not and how is
that established?   I see a snake out there  and saakshee  recorded the
time and space when I perceived the snake  now according to your
model that snake is sat or real , Right?  How is that reality validated
now? 

Hari OM!
