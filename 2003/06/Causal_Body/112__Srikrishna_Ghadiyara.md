Sri Sadananda: At times when we have a sound
refreshing sleep, and wakeup slowly, there are moments
when the active mind has not started its projection.
At that time, I am aware of myself, but the kartrutva
bhavana has not risen. So, only the Ahamkara is a mode
of mind not Aham. It is a kind of 'freedom' from
'..kara'.

It is that the consciousness withdraws its
manifestation. Think of pralaya and 'sadeva'. You do
not have to answer who slept. Sleep is simply other
than waking and dream states. Absolute consciousness
does not have to think of sleeper or dreamer. But,
when the idea of 'let me create' comes up then the
projection starts that is the time when 'I am aware of
myself' comes into picture. Without this
self-consciousness there would not have been any
possibility of this life as we know.

Sri Jay:

I think Advaita also has same thoughts that the
'Supreme Conscousness' is conscious of itself. As long
as you do not postulate another sakshee (as referred
by Sri Sadananda in a later post) that is fine, I
think.

If the Supreme does not keep 'knowledge' of the
previous creation how is He going to project in
another Kalpa etc. Ofcourse, all this can be referred
as prakriti, which is inseperable in that Absolute
consciousness.

As long as you are referring to only one Self, I see
not contradiction with Advaita Vedanta (ofcourse, as I
understad Advaita Vedanta)

Om Namo Narayanaya !!
