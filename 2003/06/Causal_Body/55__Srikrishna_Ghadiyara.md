First of all I am sorry if I hurt you in my words. It
was not the intention.

Now, I see some probability that you may be right
considering experiencer-experienced and experiencing
aspects. But, I do not have any deductions.

Swami D was mentioning in the context of Karana
Sareera.

I was commenting in the context of your original reply
when the idea occurred to me that mind has not
disappeared, becaise Priya, Moda, Pramoda vrittis are
there. But, we do not see kartritva bhaava in sleep
and we recognise the Happy states on waking up. Also,
Happiness is not described in the 'samsayatmika or
nischayatmika' list of Vrittis. So, I thought there
must be some thing related to Karana Sareera. It also
gives me an idea that though Aham Vritti is the first
vritti arising before idam vrittis, bhoktritva vritti
may exist without Aham vritti or even in deep sleep
aham vritti is not gone (all confusing). The
difficulty is it does not explain 'Unhappiness'. One
possibility is that 'Unhappiness' is not a mental
Vritti at all !!! ??? 

I welcome your comments. It is all learning to me.

Om Namo Narayanaya !!

Srikrishna
