Krishna I get the feeling that we both are saying the same thing. There
is no time and space experience in deep sleep state and it is known only
after  waking up.

How can you say mismatch when there is no experience of time and space
for to match and to mis it?

That is what deep sleep is, where one has no experience of time and
space.

This is because it is assumed that swayam prakaasha also implies the
illumination of things other than itself. Swayam prakaashatvam is
self-illumination - swayam jyoti. It does not need any other pramaNa to
know itself. If you start with the presumption that time and space are
other than itself then they need to be illumined.  On the other hand if
you presume that they are not different from the self in the same sense
as pot is not different from the clay - then swayam prakaashatvam can
include its apparent projected self.  Advaita accepts that self is
swayam jyoti -it illumines others only becuase the others are only in
the self only - tasya baasaa sarvam idam vibhaati - since it is ekam eva
advitiiyam. Krishna,swaprakaasha has different connotation in adviata.

No Krishna - I am not taking somebody's mind - it is the mind of the
sleeper. He has no knowledge of time and space - where  you Sri Krishna
if ask you where were you in during your deep sleep, all you can say is 
"I donot know" - Space and time are interrelated. There is a gap in the
memory tape since mind is not there in that state.

Precisely Krishna.  No body knows what happens out in deep sleep - Out
of mind out of sight! - that what happens when I start listening to
quantum mechanics - mind is somewhere and I can see what is being
written on the board - but during that class I know where the mind was
though. In deep sleep - nobody knows that happens only becuse nobody's
mind is there to know what happens.

This is what adhyaasa is all about.  Read above statement again Krishna,
I have stated clealy what adviata interprets as the jiiva. No mixing up
facts and interpretation. Even from adviata point it is only a model and
serves the purpose until one realizes there is  no need for any model.
Ignorance is also a model but is explicit in adviata but implicit in
other models just as adhyaasa.

Universal experince is only notional i when one takes the body is I. I
am a mortal, I am unhappy and I am ignorant are there notional I
Universally occurs for any jiiva- that is adhyaasa. When I recognize who
I am, the notional I drops out. 

That I am this body, if it is not notional, it becomes factual and one
may end up becoming a Chaaravaakii!

I did not say that way Krishana - it has no concept of time and space in
deep sleep state since antaHkarana was not there. That is my statement.
When you get up and look at the watch or the sun or lack of sun etc you
get the concept time and when you compare with that when went to sleep,
the difference between the two times gives you the amout of time you
slept - that is what Universal experience is - not how much I thought I
slept by comparing presumably some saakshii's time during sleep and
wakers time after getting from sleep, I donot think that is anybody's
experience.

Of course you do since you had no idea how much time it passed as there
is no measure of that during the sleep. There is no inconsistency here.

Looks like we are getting into jalpa here. Let us agree to disagree.

This may be my understanding or misunderstanding of Jay's mail. I know
you are not responsible for it. Let me look at the Nyaayasudhaasaara of
Pejawar swami's book how really validation by saakshii is explained.

Yes I remember reading that way although it is not clear to me how one
invalidates wrong knowledge - since invalidation invovles validation too
to know which passed the test and which did not. I will also look up.

Thanks Krishna.
