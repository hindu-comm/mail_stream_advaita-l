Jay - I am not.

 And you have not answered how does sakshee perceives an object. The
senses can measure only qualities. Where is an object Jay and until you
solved that problem - the perception of the world itself is in question?

Good - now when you say there is a jar or ring out there - that is
loukika experince, right and therefore it is not a pramaaNa, Right?
Good. 

The question now is how do I perceive the jar or ring out there?  you
also accept that qualities and object are related but not identical. If
you say  they are identical you may run into a bigger problem.  Senses
can grasp only qualities not substantive. You also mentioned that senses
cannot grasp time and space but Sakshee will know the space and time and
sat aspect. Question is how does the saakshee know these two or what is
the means or pramaaNa?  And you have not answered the quesion and I am
not even sure if  you have recognized the problem there. 

How do I perceive the object besides the qualities?

HOw does saakshii perceives the time and space since you say senses
cannot measure them.

These are fundamental questions that need to be resolved clearly.

I am not worried about parabrahman at this stage.  I will come to Him
once you establish that the world out there is real, since being a
vedantin we have already defined Him as the source of this world. 

Hari OM!
