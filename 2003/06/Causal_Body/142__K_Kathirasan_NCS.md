Namaste Jayji,

You asked, "Why do you think dvaita vedAnta has no answers to your
questions?" to Sadanandaji. 

Dvaita Vedanta, Visishtadvaita Vedanta, Advaita Vedanta, Islam, Buddhism,
Christianity, Satanism etc.... all have various answers to all kinds of
questions. So I sincerely believe that you have answers for all questions
and I have no doubts about it. But ultimately it boils down to the fact that
seekers are very different in nature. That is why we have takers for even
philosophies expounded by people like David Koresh & Charles Manson. Whether
or not one is able to accept your answers or any other answer heavily
depends on the maturity of the seeker. For every question asked, there could
be a hundred answers coming from various siddhantins but the most important
factor in understanding truth is the competency of the seeker. If a seeker
is not competent, teaching 'Tat Tvam Asi' a hundred times will not create
any change in him and he will walk away creating his own siddhanta which may
teach a completely different doctrine. Advaita Vedantins do spell out the
qualifications of the seeker in the form of Sadhana Chatushtaya.  If one
does not possess one or more of the qualifications, the possibility of
understanding Advaita Siddhanta is very slim. 

best regards,
K Kathirasan
