We are not saying the same thing, Sadananda garu. It
is perhaps illustrative of my communication abilities,
but this idea that we are talking of the same thing,
is seen in rest of the mail.

I said: Universal Testifiable experience says nothing
about Time and Space. In other words, it does NOT say
'S and T existed'. It does NOT say 'S and T did not
exist in suShupti'. We just don't have ANY sort of
information.

You interpreted that I am saying 'S and T do not exist
in suShupti'.

Hope you see the difference. 

Another thing I noticed that you are refusing to
acknowledge the fact that people do exclaim about
'mismatch'. Unless you accept this observation, there
is hardly any point in continuing our fact-based
analysis.

Just for sake of clarification, this experience of
mismatch is different from that of ignorance. In the
former, one says after waking up, 'I thought I slept
for hours-together, it is not even 10 mins since I
slept'. In the latter, 'Alright, I had a good sleep.
Now, what's the time'?

While I don't deny the latter, the former is what is
important to our analysis. If you deny that, I have
nothing to say but that you are not taking all facts
before theorizing.

Since all this started on an analysis of segregating
facts from assumptions, and since shruti is not yet in
the picture, I'd say that the fact is that people know
only one processing machine: call it mind or intellect
or brain.

The assumption is that space and time are associated
_only_ with brain/intellect/mind/senses.

There are two things again: (i) I don't see the
relevance of what you said to my reply; kindly explain
and (ii) svayaM prakAshatva as in advaita. Thanks for
the information (though I don't see how that fits with
my reply). 

But it appears to me that you are using 'svayaM
prakAsha' and 'svaprakAsha' interchangeably. There is
a thin yet significant difference between the two (esp
in the context we are in). Pls clarify. For example,
sun is svayaM prakAsha. That it is so, is not
'svaprakAsha' to some. Or do they mean same in
advaita?

I will not comment on the shruti you have quoted.

Sorry for wording the passage so horribly. Let me
reframe: 

A person has a nice good suShupti. We agree that mind
is absent in suShupti. I think we also agree that it
is the jIva that goes to suShupti.

He wakes up and makes an observation: I thought I
slept for hours-together, but it is such a short
while.

If you disagree that such an observation is never
possible, there is no further discussion possible. 

You say, mind is responsible and data-provider for "I
thought I slept for hours-together" part. I ask(ed):
Does the jIva experience coming in contact with his
mind and receiving that data?

If yes, you are violating the universal
experience-base (UE). If no, there are two
possibilities: 

(a) This event /experience of "jIva coming in contact
with his mind or antaHkaraNa" is not registered (for
whatever reasons). OR
(b) jIva himself had some idea of time.

I was saying that (a) is an assumption and has no
proof. Your objection to (b) is the consequence of
another assumption that there can be no conception of
time without the aid of mind.

There are many many assumptions in adhyAsa (Just like
the one about mind and space/time). To me, it is
nearly impossible to start from facts and derive the
inescapability of adhyAsa. Au contraire, one starts
with adhyAsa and tries to defend it. You are welcome
to prove me wrong! Unless you can afford to show that,
the talk of 'implicit ignorance' you see in other
models is 'adhyasta'.

Pls give me some more time to answer the thing on
validation and invalidation of sAkshi.

Regards,
Krishna
