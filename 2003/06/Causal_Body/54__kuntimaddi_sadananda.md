All the notions are in the mind and if there is no mind manifested in
the deep sleep - all baava-s too disappear. But that does not mean there
is knowledge. A restless ignorant mind has become restful ignorant -
that is all.

There was an extensive discussion on the sleep-experience in advaitin
list two years ago. If I remember even in this list also.  I urge you to
look at them -Shree Ravi may be able to give refs. to them - discussions
by Ananda Hudli, Vidya and others.

Karana Shariira is also defined as the anandamaya kosha - since there is
ananda in the deep sleep state - that is why it is identified as such. 
In that sense it is true - in that state the absence of duality is
happiness.  that is advaitic experience all right - but still there is
no apprehension of the reality in that advaitic experience. But
'bhoktRitva bhaava' involves deeper analysis. Since the duality of
experiencer-experienced and experiencing are not there - the question of
the dualistic nature of the experience requires a deeper examination. 
Hence there is a probability that I may be right too!

Yes - I was student of Swami Dayananda Saraswati too, and so is swami
Tejomayananda. Swamiji's reference is mostly from the reference of
anandamaya kosha, if I recall. 
Hari OM!
