If you decide to measure my devilishness, will
'devilishness' become my property ??  I think not.
Yes, 'Devilishness' as a property may exist in some
experience of yours say in Ravana. While explaining
about me to some other party you resort to measuring
my devilishness. Still, 'devilishness' does not become
my property. Inspite of such argument, what happens if
you come up with a '0' measure. Does devilishness
become my property ??
