No sir.  It is the other way, since you are flooding the list with your
version of adhyaasa and the answer you give, as you know very well has
direct bearing on the adhyaasa.

First answer your version of the perception since it lays foundation for
the attributes and the locus - objects and the world, real and unreal,
and  all the nine yards. 

I expect you to answer before we can unravel your adhyaas parts. 

Hari Om!
