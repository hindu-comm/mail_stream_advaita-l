Namskaram :

I am Srinivas Mallapragada, currently living in NJ, USA and working in NYC.
Our family has traditionally been followers of Sri Bhagavatpada and my
interest in sanAtana dharma, advaita and smArta sampradAya grew naturally
from my childhood. Currently I am doing veda adhyayanam and also learning
Bhagavadgeeta and the Upanishads under the guidance of my guru Sri
Yegnasubramanian.

We, at Sringeri Vidya Bharati Foundation ( http://www.svbf.org ) conduct all
activities and celebrate all events traditionally according to the Sringeri
MaTha sampradAya.

I wish to complement my understanding of advaita vedanta by following the
discussions of learned members of this satsang.

Thank You.

Best Regards,
Srinivas
