Well, we are talking about reality of world and not its self-nature or it's
independence from Brahmn. You are saying , world is unreal in terms of its
separate self-nature , and may I ask why there should be any condition (such
as "self-nature" ) for the definition of Reality ? What is the pramaNa for
such definition of reality ? Reality is nothing to do with dependence or
not. We do agree, this world and all these jIvas are eternally depends on
Brahmn.

True, but, we need physical moon to begin with  to reflect the sun's light,
isn't it ? Sun itself is not Moon. Without moon, no moon light even if sun
light is there. Moon light depends on Sun light but also at the same time
moon is *as real as* the Sun itself.
