In asking the question of "who is seeking brahman?"
you are pre-supposing Nescience (avidya). Since
Nescience is the cause of subject-object distinction,
the answer to your question can be stated as "the
individual(jiva) is to seek brahman" wihtout violating
any tenet of advaita. But if you object that brahman
is the only essence, then you are already speaking in
metaphysical terms in which case you have the doctrine
of "nothing ever is happening". No one is seeking
anyone in the metaphysical sense. The jiva is seeking
brahman only in the empirical sense.
