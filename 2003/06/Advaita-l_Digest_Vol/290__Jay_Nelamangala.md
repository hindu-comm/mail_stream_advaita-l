Dear NAgArjuna,

All right,  Let us go back one step.

What is self-nature?.  Give me the sanskrit equivalent.

In advaita,  any such notions of distinctions is also only in the
first level of truth.

Since I have my own set of questions on advaita,  it may be
proper that all your questions on advaita be answered by
a scholar from this List,  rather than me.

What is reality to you?

For me,  if you bang your head on a brick and get hurt
because the brick is hard,  then that is reality.
For me,  if you bang your head on a pillow and do not
get hurt, then that is reality.

How molecules are arranged is left to nature.  But the
fact remains that nature 'did'  arrange brick molecules
and pillow molecules differently for 'real'.  That is reality.

Why do you deny this 'reality' of work of nature ?
