The knowledge of the essence is definitely at a higher
level. Without essence there is no gross. Not
otherwise though.

Subtler than the subtlest is nothing but the ultimate
essence. Bigger than the biggest is an indication of
greatness and not grossness.

The mistake in your point lies in the fact that brick
is the not the absolute essence here.When you go down
from the brick, brick represents the gross. When you
come up from the brick, brick represents the subtle.In
the latter case a relative subtle item (brick) helps
you in constructing the well which is relatively gross.
