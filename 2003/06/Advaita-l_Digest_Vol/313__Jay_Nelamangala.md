Dear NagArjuna,

So what is your point?

By knowing the essence of great wall  as bricks
in the mundane world of civil engineering,
you may be able to reconstruct similar walls.

When it comes to the knowledge of Parabrahman,
neither bricks, nor walls, nor Great wall of China
nor your civil engineering is going to help.
That is the whole point.

BTW,  I have read "MoolamAdhyamika kArikA"
of Sri NagArjuna.
