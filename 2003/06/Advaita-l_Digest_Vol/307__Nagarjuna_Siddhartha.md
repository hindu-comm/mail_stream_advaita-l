In this mail, I am trying to address another issue. I have in the process skipped an important issue (of visesha) raised by Nomadeva Sharma, but I will be on it as soon as possible.(This delay is primarily due to my being an amateur to advaita and moreover the concept of visesha and saviseshabheda occurs in dvaita, of which my knowledge is pathetic.)

And as I always carry the possibility of mis-representing advaita or any other school, I request the members to correct me, if and when they notice such a mis-representation.

Creation, in advaita is "per accidens" (to quote T M P Mahadevan). Thus brahman is not inherently a material cause, but the causality is only accidental. This would preserve the sanctity of "neti neti".

If your intention sir, is to quote this as an explanation of difference beween brahman and its creation, then I have a different intention in mind. I can use this to question the omni-presence of brahman once upon a time (i.e. before he entered into his creation). The dualist who believes that the attributes of brahman are eternal, can ill-afford to discard omni-presence at any point of time.
