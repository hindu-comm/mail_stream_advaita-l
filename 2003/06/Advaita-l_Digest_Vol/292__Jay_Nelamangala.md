You can also increase your level of understanding
by looking at the grosser forms,  just as you look at
subtler forms.  Both are needed.  No can say one
knowledge has higher level truth than other knwoeldge.

"aNoraNeeyAn mahatO maheeyAn sam anusmarEdyaha"
One need to understand the subtler of the subtlest,
and bigger than the biggest.

>From brick you need to go down,  from the same brick
you need to go up as well.  Either knowledge has the
same truth,  because there are no levels in truth to begin
with.  Either it is true or it is not true.
