That is by your definition. Self-nature of an object is what describes
the object (roughly speaking). There is no criterion like 'dependency'
should not be an attribute of that 'self-nature' or its definition.

One question: Do you have some basis in buddhism? pratItya-samutpAda
vAda? This (wrong) argument comes from there, AFAIK.

Krishna

p.s. I am clearing my mails from bottom. If somebody has answered this
question of yours, ignore my mail. Thx.
