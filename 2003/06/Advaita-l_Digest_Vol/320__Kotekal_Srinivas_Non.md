For your kind information, I did not use the term "sought after" on my own
but I just reproduced Nagarjuna's wordings (please follow the mails
correctly).  Anyway, this is yet another example of different versions of
Advaita.

In any case, if you claim **Brahma-vidya is ever-realized** , then why do
you believe in Vedas ? as you are already **ever-realized** that you are
Brahmn ! what is the need of sAdana ?

Regards,
Srinivas.
