No vEdaantin says brick is the absolute essence.
Let the brick be gross or subtle,  let the well be
gross or subtle, let me molecules be gross or subtle

Vedanta asks you to enquire into the One cause of All,
which made the gross the gross,  and the subtle the subtle.

You seem to be carried away by giving more
importance to the subtler ones than the gross ones.

VedAnta asks you to enquire into the entire creation
which includes all these subtle and  gross elements.
