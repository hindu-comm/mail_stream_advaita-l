Hold it right there Srinivas - when you say the question arises - you
are already in the realm of ignorance.  Then we are coming to dwaita -
since there is questioner and question and questioning. J~naani will not
ask  such questions. If there is one and I am seeing two, I got to get
my eyes checked up. Hence for those who see two, one needs to go to
proper teacher to learn that there is only one and two and I am
projecting two due incorrect vision.   That is what the essence of tat
tvam asi teaching. It is not that you are going to join that or becoming
that- it says you are that, period.

You are absolutely right - no need for all that If I have no notions or
visions of two when there is only one. The upadesha all that is
therefore relavent only to those who see dwaita when there is only
advaita. 

Let me tell you a story - there is this jobn who suddently thought he is
a rat and not a human - do not ask me how and when he got that notion. 
He has been rat all along, according to him. His wife somehow took him
to a doctor and after many sittings he was tought that he is a man and
not a rat. He did everyday that japa - he is a man and not a rat. John
who are you - he said I am a man and not a rat.  Eveybody is happy - He
went back home. But after some time he came running back to the doctor -
When doctor asked what is the problem - he said I know I am a man and
not a rat, but how can I be sure that cat in the street knows that I am
a man and not a rat.

aham brahamasmi as to be reaized not as a thought but as a fact.  It is
not that john, the rat, is going to become a john, the man - That he is
the rat is only notional but not factual.  

If we know we are nothing but Brahman, the teaching is fulfilled.
Further questions will not be there. That my friend is the fulfilment of
the scriptures.

Yes. when I am no more dwaitin but become true adviatin! But as long as
there are the concepts of I, you and the world are taken as REAL then
Saadhana should go on. Plurality is not a problem but taking the
plurality as reality is the problem. Hence the teachinig is for those
who have that delusion, but not for those who know that everything is
Brahman. 

Srinivas - you can answer the rest of the questions yourself -All that
you mentioned are for those who not only see the plurality but take that
plurality as realty.

Srinivas - it is like John askng whey do these cats bother me
unnecessorily.  No need to bother about anythng my friend if you realize
adviata but until then you have that knowledge you need to bother since
ignorence is cause of the samsaara. If you have the knowledge that you
are indeed Brahman, then no more of these botherations.

Srinivas - it is indeed like a dream - when a tiger is chasing in your
dream, you run for your life - is it not. When when you are awakend to
higher state of reality that is the waking state only - you realise that
the whole dream world is your mental projection.  It is the similar -
the plurality is taken as reality and suffer the consequences of this
misunderstanding - Scriputure is giving a different vision of youself
than what you think of yourself.

Sreenivas - think deeply now - if everything is Brahman - sajaati
vijaati swagata bbeda-s resolve into one - that is who teaching started
- sat eva soumya idam agra asseet.  All relations come into picture only
when one is ignorant about oneself. Once knowledge is there you can
enjoy sunraise and sunset knowing very well that sun does not raise or
set. You become a jiivanmukta.

My friend - if you realized that my hats off for you . but do not act
like John who is afraid of cats anymore. Doctor is needed as long as
john is afraid of cats. 


Hari OM!
Sadanada
