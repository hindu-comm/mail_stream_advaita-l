You agreed shrutis are for ignorant and you also said jnAnis will not
question shrutis. But you failed to address the question how would one
becomes jnAni in the first place ? You are assuming some people are jnAni
somehow and they do not need shruti. This is absolutely baseless assumption.


For your information, Sri Vyasa Himself has said in first sutra "athAtho
brahma jignyAsa" (Then, therefore let us examine the subject of brahman) ;
this means real person (who wants to be jnAni) will enquire the subject of
brahmn by questioning and analysis. No one will just assume they are jnAni
like you did.

You only said "J~naani will not ask  such questions" and by saying so you
try to avoid me asking fundamental question about "ekam eva advitiiyam". The
more funny thing is ; you yourself only quoted that shruti in support of
your view ! Now you are trying to avoid my question !

Nice try, Sadanada-ji.

If you don't have time to discuss, that's fine with me but understand the
objections.
