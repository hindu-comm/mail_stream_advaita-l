Refer to the hardness example in my previous mail to
see why.

Inference.

It definitely has. That too when you talk about
essence. The sun and moon example should tell us why.
Pose the question - Is the moon essentially luminous?
A "No", which is the correct answer,contradicts our
perception.(Gives us one reason why perception cannot
always be trusted.) Perception alone would not notice
such dependancy (of the moon on the sun) and might
confuse this with self-nature of the moon. Here
perception does not give reality due to dependance
involved.

That would mean that the the world and the jivas have
no self-nature. This is the best justification for
advaita that one can get.

The analogy is not about whether the physical moon is
as real as the sun. It is about whether or not the
moon is luminous like the sun. A non-luminous moon
appears to be lumionus here.
