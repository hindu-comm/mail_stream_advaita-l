Srinivas - there is no paramaatma-jada aikya - neither any
paramaatma-jiiva aikya. Aikya implies two things joining.  Any dwaita is
notional and that is what the teaching is.  Notions are due to adhyaasa.
 When Brahman is ekam eva advitiiyam - there cannot be anything other
than Brahman. Brahman is sat and Brahman is chit and Brahman is ananda
or ananta - There cannot be anything other than sat and anything other
than chit and anything beyond limitless. Therefore sat has to be chit
and chit has to be anantam.   Where is the question of jada here? If
there is such a question, then that question itself is due to not
knowing the facts - and that my friend is what is called ignorance and
resulting effects of that ignorance is adhyaasa - it is as simple as
that. 

Hari OM!
