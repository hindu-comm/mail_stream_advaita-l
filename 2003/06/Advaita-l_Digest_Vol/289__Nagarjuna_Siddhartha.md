It is surprising that you talk about something called
"eternally dependant self-nature" because there is no
such thing. Self-nature of an object, by definition
cannot be eternally dependant on something else for
its existence.

To my knowledge, Advaita does distinguish between  the
perceived world and a barren woman's son.

The two levels of truth are empirical and
metaphysical. Empirical truth deals with the perceived
world. Metaphysical truth deals with the essence. 

To understand it from a physical example - The
hardness of a material is in reality due to a
particular way of behaviour of the molecules of the
material. Hardness is just our way of perceiving this
phenomenon. Hardness has no reality in itself.

Once you appreciate the fact that there is no such
thing as an eternally dependant self-nature, you will
realize that the second sutra clearly justifies
advaita alone.
