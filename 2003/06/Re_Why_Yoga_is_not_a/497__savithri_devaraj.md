Not to add something to that which has already been
very clearly stated, but it would also seem to be that
vision(s), power(s), experiences of samAdhi, etc do
not lend themselves to universal corroboration or
universal experience (sArvatrikAnubhava). The Self
being so close and being the core of one's being has
to be in the purview of common experience, not just of
a chosen few who practice yoga or meditation.
