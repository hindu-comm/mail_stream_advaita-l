I heard from a reliable source that the Na-kAra in
nArAyaNa is due to the common Sanskrit grammar rule of
a change in the na-kAra due to the presence of the
letter "ra". Therefore "narAnAm + AyanaM = nArAyaNam"
automatically, with nArAyanam (with the na-kAra) not 
being a possibility at all. 

The whole article on nArAyaNa referring to a specific
person was nothing other than a deliberate attempt to
skew the facts in favor of VishhNu. 

OM namaH shivAya,

Kartik
