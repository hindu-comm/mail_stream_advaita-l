Jayna, 

Ignore this if it has been answered.

Perception of object and object-as-is are clearly different; one is an
event, the other is an object (obviously). Is your question, how are
you sure the content of knowledge conveys the object as is? 

With a small correction that it is conveying an as-is aspect of
object-as-is, the answer would be that all defects in 'defective
knowledge' can be traced to extraneous reasons. And in absence of
extraneous factors, like one can be sure of in the perception of Self,
knowledge is always seen to be valid.

Regards,
Krishna
