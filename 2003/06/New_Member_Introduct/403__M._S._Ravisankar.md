Subject: Introduction


Namaste,
I am currently doing my PhD in Sanskrit. I have been exposed to many
Advaitic terms and concepts from a very early age because of my mother's
avid interest in Advaita. I read the brahmasUtra and vedAnta paribhASA as
part of my MA study. It was then that the terms I had heard earlier started
making sense. I do not know much to contribute to the list. I would just
like to listen.

Thanks
Aarathi.
