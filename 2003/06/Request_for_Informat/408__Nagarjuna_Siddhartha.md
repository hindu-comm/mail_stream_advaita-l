Citsuka could not have criticized dvaita of course.
But, in order to secure the fortress of advaita, he
made an all out attack on the concept of difference.
It seems he goes directly into the concept of
differnce and all the different ways of conceiving it
-  differnce as nature of things, difference as mutual
negation, differnce as distinctness, difference as
separateness of qualities and difference as 
manifested in the variety of categories, each of which
has its own separate definition. It seems that
Vyasatirtha never makes any attempt to meet these
arguments squarely. As such, this work of Citsuka
could be a very valuable asset of advaita.
