Jaldhar, 

I understand what you said about permitting dvaitins
to challenge advaitic concepts within the guidelines
of the list. But note what Jay Nelamangala has said
above: "...expose the limitations, inconsistencies in
the advaitic model..."! He is *directly* implying that
Shankara and his disciples were inconsistent! He ought
to have said "possible/apparent inconsistencies" if he
meant a respectful disagreement, but he didn't. Is
*that* allowed as per the list rules at all? If I
remember right, one of the rules demands that the post
be respectful towards the Shankaran tradition. 

IMHO, it is those arbitrary remarks that cast a slur
on advaita that simply shouldn't be allowed! I
wouldn't mind any dvaitin being disrespectful to
Shankara outside this list, or even respectfully
questioning advaita within this list, but throwing out
nonsensical remarks like Jay Nelamangala regularly
does (as in the above instance) is rather flagrant. 

Thanks,

Kartik
