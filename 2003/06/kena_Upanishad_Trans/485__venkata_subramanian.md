Dear All,

among the translations that i have seen for the Isavasya Upanishad, i consider the one into English by H.H.Sri Swami Sachidanandendra Saraswathi of Holenarsipur to be the best.

1. the language is clear and direct to the Original

2. there are good and pointed footnotes everywhere to usher us into several inner predicants

3. the summary and the appendices given at the end are very useful.


Thanks & Regards,
Venkat.

Sadgurubhyo Namah.
