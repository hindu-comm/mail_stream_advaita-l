What exactly does one mean by vAkyArtha jnAna and samAdhi? Non-advaitins 
mean a different thing by them as compared to advaitins.

sureSvarAcArya does not mention samAdhi explicitly, as far as I know, but 
points towards it.

See Naishkarmyasiddhi passage, "... vairAgayaM, tato mumukshutvaM, tatas tad 
upAya paryeshaNaM, tatas sarva-karma-tat-sAdhana-saMnyAsas, tato 
yogAbhyAsas, tataS cittasya pratyak-pravaNatA, tatas tattvamasyAdi 
vAkyArthaparijnAnaM, tato'vidyocchedas, tatas svAtmany evAvasthAnam ..." If 
I remember right, this is the prose passage immediately before verse 1.52. 
I'll check on it later this evening.

Note that yogAbhyAsa precedes the rise of the complete knowledge (parijnAna) 
of the meaning (artha) of sentences (vAkya) such as tattvamasi.

See also vArttika on BU commentary, under BU 1.4.7-10 - pratyag jnAne 
nirudhyante citta-tad-vRttayo yataH - a clear reference to citta vRtti 
nirodha in samAdhi, as taught in the yoga school. SankarAcArya makes an even 
more direct reference to citta vRtti nirodha in the relevant portion of his 
commentary. I have pointed out the exact quotation in an earlier discussion 
on our list, more than a year ago.

Finally, see also brahmasUtra bhAshya 2.3.39-40, for how samAdhi was 
understood by SankarAcArya.
