Show me where I did not do that.

It was Jay who was trying to assail the position of advaita using logic to which I raised an objection. If brahman is beyond logic, then there is no point in logically assailing advaita. 

To your latter question, an attributeless object is not reasonable. But brahman is not an object in advaita.

I thought you were asking Jay to use the same yardstick, logic or
shruti, to evaluate every school. Now, how come you are not doing that?

Since you are keen on using logic to determine the nature of Brahman,
who admittedly is beyond logic, I'd like to know if you find the idea
of an attributeless object logical and reasonable?

Talking of logic again, how can 'essence' and nirguNa brahman be same,
when the latter is supposed to be beyond the considerations of jAti,
etc, while the former isn't?

Krishna
