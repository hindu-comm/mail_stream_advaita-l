Srinivas tells me that shruti has to be interpreted so as not to contradict perception or inference.

>What criteria did you use to evaluate them to be better?

One obvious criterion is the illogicalness of holding the position that two attributes of something (brahman in this case) are not different, so that this position may not be given serious consideration.

On what criterion are you suggesting that the assumption is unwarranted?

>> brahman only. 

>'neti neti'

I think I got what you are trying to suggest. 

If it is objected that neti neti suggests that brahman is not the "ultimate essence", then the reply is that "brahman is the ultimate essence" is an inherently tautological statement which is a defect in language rather than a philosophical defect. For brahman being the ultimate essence was never suggested as a definition of brahman. It is synonymous with it, just like reality which in advaita is not treated as a definition of brahman but as a term synonymous to brahman.

I don't know if Jay used only logic. Shruti is used more than logic, as
the matters pertain to Brahman.

So your analysis starts with this assumption 'empirical' world, but
wouldn't such unwarranted assumptions bring down the quality of your
analysis?

'neti neti'.
