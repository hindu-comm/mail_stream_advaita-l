Dear NagArjuna,

>omni-science and omni-potence are the same. There

>I misunderstanding you?

The very first lesson that Shrutis teach is that Parabrahman
is not anything like that you know in this mundane world.
This is called His jagat-vilakshaNatva.

In the world,  one guNa of a worldly thing is different from
another guNa of that worldly thing. 
Similarly,  a  loukika thing may have the quality of creating another
laukika thing ( Ex : milk creating butter milk)
A loukika thing may have the quality of destroying another 
loukika thing ( Fire buring and destroying paper)

When you think that  Parabrahman is also a "thing" like
one of the above things, then only what you are saying is correct.

But Parabrahman is jagat-vilakshaNa.   To understand Him
just the knowledge of these wordly things and how they are structured
in terms of  their guNas etc,  that knowledge is of no use.
