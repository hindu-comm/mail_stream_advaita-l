Please wait. Here I am making an objection. The
interpretation of "neha nAnAsti kimchana" given by Jay
 is clearly illogical. He was indeed opposing anumana.
For it is absolutely illogical to say that the kriya,
jnana, guNa etc of brahman are not different.

This is a traditional argument but it is incorrect. 
When you are saying "brahman is real" you are
presupposing Nescience. For the statement "brahman is
real" assumes two concepts "brahman" and "reality" and
says that they are the same. Here you find an instance
of tautology but such a tautology is inescapable in
language, for even if you say that "brahman has
attributes" there is tautology involved. Thus the
statement "brahman is real" is an inherently
tautological statement and thus has no real truth in
itself, but occurs only due to the need for
communication of an idea. To understand the idea
further, just keep in mind that brahman and reality
are synonymous in advaita and not two separate
concepts for anyone to proclaim in the true sense that
"brahman is real". Thus advaita is free from the
defect which you are trying to attribute to it.

There is actually only one essence and that is
brahman.  For when you say that the world is
absolutely dependant on brahman, then you are forced
to conclude that the world has no separate
self-nature. Thus by proclaiming the absolute
dependance of the world on brahman, you are loudly
proclaiming advaita.
