That should not be a problem because mithya is not treated like crocodile's wings.

I have nothing to do with dvaita. I am just responding to your mails assailing the advaitic position. If you say that the world is absolutely dependant on brahman then you are inherently denying the separate self-nature of the world. That is close enough to advaita.

brahman. For when you say that the world is
absolutely dependant on brahman, then you are forced
to conclude that the world has no separate
self-nature. Thus by proclaiming the absolute
dependance of the world on brahman, you are loudly
proclaiming advaita.

The reality of Brahman need not negate the reality of the
world. 
But in advaita, Brahman is the only reality, and Jagat is
mithyA.

You are equating "mithyA of advaita" with
"world is absolutely dependent on Brahman of dvaita" 
and then saying I am loudly proclaiming advaita.
