what the Acharya said is true.  Higher Vedantic studies are for Sannyasis.
However I can offer a couple of reasons why a Grhastha might want to learn
more anyway.

1.  If you are a Brahmana pursuing sacred knowledge is your paramount duty
regardless of whether it is "useful" or not.  Even if you are not,
knowledge is always better than ignorance.

2. karmayoga, Bhakti, meditation etc. may be lower branches of Advaita
Vedanta but they are still part of it nevertheless.  They too must be
based on a firm shastraic foundation if they are to be followed properly.

It also means that people shouldn't feel that they are too new or too
ignorant to make a contribution even if it is only providing questions not
answers.

Usenet in general is dead.  It is too open to easily hijacked by trolls
and spammers and other miscreants.  Any successor would have to be
moderated and that takes a lot of time and energy.

That was my hope but I forgot to account for human nature. :(

It would be nice if we could summarize all the adhikaranas of the
Brahmasutras perhaps using works like Vayasikanyayamala of Madhava or
siddhantaleshasamgraha of Appaya Dikshita (both Grhasthas it should be
noted.)
