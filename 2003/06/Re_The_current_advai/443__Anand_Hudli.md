Well said. I couldn't agree more. It is far better to recognize
the various traditions (advaita, dvaita, vishishhTa-advaita, etc.) as
co-existing with each other and available for study to those who are
qualified and have a burning desire to study them. Some of our elders
point out that while brahminical values are disappearing fast among
the current generation, it is absurd to encourage bickering among
the sects.
