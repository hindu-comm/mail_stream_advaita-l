Trying to catch up on some old posts.

Two points to be made here-

1.Since brahman is the material as well as instrumental cause and since brahman is also unchangeable, it should follow that the "changes" that we see in the world are at a lower grade of reality than brahman. (vivarta vAda)

2.How about this analogy - Just as by knowing clay one knows the essence of all objects made of clay, while the rest being modifications in terms of name and form. Strictly speaking there is no proof for many things. Even the hardcore realist cannot prove that perception is real or that it will never be sublated in the future.

But the same text also says that brahman is nishkriya(actionless). If I follow the lead given by T M P Mahadevan these two positions can be reconciled by stating that while brahman is essentially qualityless(which includes nishkriya), Ishwara is *essentially* the doer of actions. The force of svAbhAvikI is applied to Ishwara here.

 >Similarly, what would you say of 'tadsR^iShTvA tadanupravishat.h'?

I believe that advaita considers prakRti as a form of brahman. That would explain this without any problem.
