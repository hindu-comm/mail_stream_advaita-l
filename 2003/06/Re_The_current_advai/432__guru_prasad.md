An easy excuse, as usual always. "When Ignorance is

I ment the followers of chaitanya and not himself,
just a typo. chaitanya lived somewhere in (15th
century 1430's CE) perhaps.

Keep dreaming! Where is the proof, can you quote the
place and documentation of this defeat. If you need
the proof from my side visit MulaBaglu in Karnataka
(about 50 miles from Bangalore) there is a victory
pillar marking the debate between Vidhyaranya and
Akshobyathirtharu and the King declaring
AkshobyaTiirta emerging victorious.

I have got the dates correctly now you go get the
records correctly for example VidhyaRanya, he after
being defeated, carries the GrantHas on Elephant as a
honor to AkshobHya Tiirtha..

Gururpasad.
