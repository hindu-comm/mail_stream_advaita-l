Sri Appaya Dikshita being defeated on a daily basis and Swami Vidhyaranya
bowing down to his opponents !!!!
Are you sure of what you are talking about? Or is it on the same lines like
the story that says Shri Adi shankara has been repeated defeated by
Dharmakirti, a buddhist ? If you havent got your facts right or if it is
just some cranked up stuff which you have lifted from some Madhvite
hagiographies (btw - these works are well known for their BIG LIES,
especially about personalities).
