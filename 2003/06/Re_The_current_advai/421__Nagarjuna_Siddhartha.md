Do you know what Dasgupta also says? He says that the
defence of bheda (difference) in dvaita is weak. In
this context he mentions 2 books which attack
difference. They are tattva-pradipika of citsuka and
bheda-dhikkara of Nrsimhasrama. This is the reason
why, I am looking for those two books. I posted a
request on this list regarding their availability. I
am still waiting for someone to respond to it. There
are other scholars who feel that Madhva has failed to
explain the true nature of difference properly. 

Do you know what Hacker has to say about vedanta? He
says that all schools of vedanta except one(dvaita)
follow a more or less radical form of monism. 

Do you know what Radhakrishnan says about dvaita? He
says that because of the differentiation in the form
of sattvika, rajasika and tamasika jivas, one is bound
to become indifferent to the practice of vedanta.

Do you know that B N K Sharma himself reads "tat tvam
asi" as "tat tvam asi" only? He says that atat tvam
asi is a "recommendation" of Madhva. He says that
Madhva himself made use of "tat tvam asi" in some of
his works and that Madhva himself would NOT HAVE
BOTHERED(!) whether it is tat tvam asi or atat tvam
asi. Why would he? He(Madhva) already had a
pre-determined agenda of dvaita in mind. He would have
twisted any statement to suit his convenience!
