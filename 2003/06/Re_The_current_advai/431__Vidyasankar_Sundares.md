To which, one could say that this was because they did not take the dvaita 
school seriously enough to bother refuting it.

Do you know the date of Caitanya? How did you decide that he addressed the 
affluence of the western world?

And you know this, how? We have accounts that say the opposite, e.g. that 
vidyAraNya defeated akshobhyatIrtha. Get your historical dates correct

of conflicting historical accounts later.
