             I believed you when u wrote this in your first mail but the mails which u posted after that suggest very much the opposite. You have resorted to typical tattvavaadi mudslinging. You sound audacious and arrogant. And I dont think your posts are in any way "constructive". You are much worse than Jay and Co. But I am not blaming you, You are a typical dvaitin and nothing better can be expected from you. And I am glad that you have decided to come out in open and not confuse people by shelling out hi-funda theories (that sound very innocuous) like Jay used to.

Regards
Anand K
