Western world? What are u talking abt? Do u know Chaitanya's dates? Or are u
referring to Moslems? Or is it that u got ISKCON & Co in mind? And
personally I would prefer not to call Chaitanya's way as Vedanta. Its purely
devotion. Only later followers tried to cook up a philosophy to suit this
devotion and to call themselves as a unique school.
