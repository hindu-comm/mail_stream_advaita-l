dhyAna in the context of advaita-vedAnta is not a karma. It is considered as
upAsana*.

Hence, there is a scope within that for krama mukti.  It is addressed in BSB
under the shrutatvaachcha 1.1.11. (... tatra kaanicidbrahmaNa upaasanaani
abhyudayarthani kaanicit kramamuktyarthaani kaanicit karma
samR^iddhyarthaani tatra guNa visheshha upaadhi bhedena bhedaH ...)

*There is an element similar to dhyAna in nidhidhyAsana, however, it is not
considered as upAsana. Recently someone posted a reference which contrasts
dhyAna and nidhidhyAsana.
