Hari Om !!

We have so much to say about Sruthi being a Pramana.
Pramana being that it can independently reveal the
Self. 

Why did Srikrishna say in Bhagavad Gita 'j~nana yogena
sankhyanam karmayogena yoginam' ? He obviously means
that both j~nana and Karmayoga are means of the same
knowledge. In such case why is not Karma Yoga accepted
as a Darsana ?

In the 6 th chapter Sri Krishna again does not refer
to Karma Yoga, but discourses about Meditation or
Dhyana. Does it mean that this Dhyana is independent
or part of both J`nana and Karma Yoga ?

Om Namo Narayanaya !!

Srikrishna
