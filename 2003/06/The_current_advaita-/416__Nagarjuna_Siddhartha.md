What was written above is mostly non-sense. By saying
that since chaitanya, ananda etc, has its own special
significance, they must therefore be properties, the
above writer has demostrated his glaring ignorance of
the fundamental concepts of advaita. Why are sat, cit
and Ananda not properties? Because -

1. They are not independant of each other. 

Properties like the blueness and geometery of an
object are independant of each other. I have a round
pot with me which is painted blue.But if I paint it
green, its blueness goes, but its rotundity is not
going to be affected in any way.  The same is not the
case of sat, cit and Ananda. Take away sat, then cit
and Ananda are unreal. Take away cit, then brahman
would be inert with no Ananda. More over, since any
object existent, has to  be invariably and inherently
manifested by brahman-intelligence(cit), to show its
existence, in the absence of a manifesting cit, there
is no more sat. Thus sat, cit and Ananda are not
independant.


2. All properties must depend on something else also.
But sat, cit and Ananda are not dependant on anything
else.

For example, even the property of omni-presence of
Ishwara, must depend on the creation of AkAsa or
space, because without space, the idea of
omni-presence is meaning-less. Thus, omni-presence is
dependant on something else. If Ishwara is to be
all-powerful, then there must be something else other
than Ishwara to exercise his powers on.(This is why
brahman is not defined as strength, in advaita) Thus
even all-powerfulness is dependant on something
else.But sat, cit and Ananda are not dependant on
anything else.  They are there irrespective of
anything else. Which is one more reason why they are
not called as properties. They are treated as nature,
inherent to brahman, where the mention of one thing
inherently implies others.

In conclusion, writers here, especially the dvaitins,
are advised to take the trouble of reading the advaita
concepts, if they want to comment on it. Otherwise
they would be making fools out of themselves.
