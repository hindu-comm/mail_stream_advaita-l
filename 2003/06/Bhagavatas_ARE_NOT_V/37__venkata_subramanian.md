Jaldar ji,

i am sorry to contradict you in this.

Please note that the Acharya Pada in his Brahma Sutra
Bhashya has mentioned about the paksha of the
Bhagavatas ..(II Chapter) a similar allusion is also
there in the Geeta Bhashya (13-2).

Now, the School of Bhagavatas that he has explained is
NOT the Visishtadvitins or the dvaitins of nowadays. 
that Bhagavata (Traditional School) believed that
after Mukti the Jeeva completely merges into Brahman.
While these two, are dualists even after Mukti.

Please refer - Shankara Vedanta Prakriya Bhaskara BY
Swami Sri Sachidanandendra Saraswathi of Holenarsipur,
for a Brilliant Discussion.

=====
Thanks & Regards,
Venkat.

Sadgurubhyo Namah.
