I know. The point is that they have not explained this
shruti later (though they have used it) to demonstrate
abheda.

Irrelevant. The unanswered point, also in the earlier
mail, was that this analogy is not 'answered' i.e.
explained to show abheda. Just in case you were to
reply that the idea of 'avasthiti' is the explanation
to the analogy of rivers, note that what is needed is
a word from Shankara or Bhamati or Kalpataru.

By thinking that this example establishes difference,
we are understanding the shruti perspective, which is
more important and different from advaita perspective.

That is advaita interpretation of the auDulomi school
(Did he have a school per se?). Personally (I don't
know what the chandrikA says or what the esteemed BNK
Sharma says) I think that the interpretation offered
by Shankara on these sUtras is quite irrelevant. It is
incongruous to bring out the topic of jIva-brahma
relation (esp having done that in the adhyAsa-bhAShya)
so late (in the last few sUtras of last pAda) in the
samanvaya-adhyAya. Moreover, the interpretation does
not do any 'samanvayA' at all.

We do not accept abheda after the merger. The analogy
is a clear refutation of 'abheda' even after merger.
The waters of the various rivers are still different
from each other, though you and I cannot make it out.
Moreover, the volume of water increases. Since none of
these are seen in the 'pare', 'avyaye' (changeless),
post-merger identity is ruled out
(jagad-vyApara-varjaM ityAdeshcha). 
On the other hand, the mixing of milk and water is
also a 'merger'. (The Pancharatragama, while
delineating the abheda-mukti says that the abheda or
merger should be understood from the analogy of rain
falling on earth (where water does not become earth)
and goes on to explain merger in terms of sAlokya). 

All these points (except that in parentheses) are
noted in nyAyAmR^ita. The author points out to the
acceptance by Vachaspati that the rivers do not become
one and Madhusudana Saraswati does not answer the
charge that advaitins themselves have accepted that
this example does not establish abheda. Instead he
takes refuge in Chandogya's: sa samudra eva bhavati.  

As it stands, the analogy in the shruti you quoted is
a hindrance to the idea of 'attributelessness' or
'partlessness' of Brahman (that which you set out to
demonstrate using this shruti). You were welcome to
quote the Advaita-siddhi text (or any classical
advaita text) to show how top-advaitins (!) have
interpreted this shruti to show that the
nadIdR^ishTAnta shows 'abheda'.

The muNDakopaniShadbhAshya does not address the
issues. It says, such a vidvAn obtains "parAt
akSharAtpUrvoktAt paraM divyaM puruShaM
yathoktalakShaNaM upaiti upagacchati. Boink goes the
idea that shruti talks of 'attributelessness'.

Irrelevant. The saptami vibhakti is of 'pare' and
'avyaye'.

May be; but, since this shruti has not explicitly said
that it is inherently attributeless (or that these
attributes of 'puruShaM' and 'divyaM' are imagined),
quoting this shruti to show partlessness and
attributelessness of Brahman is a goof.

On a different point, can you clarify this pls? From
the idea of 'bhAga-tyAga-laxaNa', it appeared that
Shankara was proposing an equality called
chin-mAtra-aikya. Undifferentiated consciousness. So,
I have been thinking that he holds (sagUNa-brahman -
imposed attributes) = (jIva - imposed attributes) =
(nirguNa brahman). But (sagUNa brahman with imposed
attributes) is not equal to (jIva with imposed
attributes).

In that light, with the muNDakopaniShat referring to
saguNa brahman, does the krama-mukti refer to merger
with saguNa brahman?

So, this shruti on the face of it supports reaching
the saguNa brahman? And calls that as amR^itatvaM?

Yes.

First understand what svarUpendriya means. The term
indriya is used to denote that it is an instrument of
knowledge. The term 'svarUpendriya' denotes that this
instrument is the jIva itself. anyathA, 'viGYAtAramare
kena vijAnIyAd.h'?

Do you want a quote that jIva has indriyas other than
normal indriyas in mokSha?

That was a 'strawman' reply. You did not mention the
source of your idea of sAkshi-A. Secondly, it is
evident that you do not know what or which portion of
Advaita-siddhi BNKS has quoted. Without even asking
for the text, you proceed to prattle so much?

The point is missed. You cannot do without a
self-intuitve, self-grasping knower in deep sleep.
That is sAkshi.

Let me repeat: 
What is the instrument through which you know that
'you have been to deep sleep'? Ask some person (who
has not heard of advaita) that question, it is not
unlikely that they will look at you queerly, search
for any catch in the question and then say, 'I know
it, dude'. That is the operation of sAkshi. Your
buddhi, antaHkaraNa --- every other indriya -- have no
contact with the 'chap' who is in deep-sleep.

It is rather the case that you are simply forced to
say that 'we don't need sAkshi which is svarUpendriya'
without answering why it is not needed for the above
example.

sAkshi. It is not necessary that all sAkshis come to
the same decision at the same time.

Read again. I am responding to your statement that
buddhi takes normal day-to-day decisions, because of
which you don't need 'sAkshi-D'. A side-question: can
an inert thing like buddhi grasp prAmANya?

You might disagree all about svarUpendriya, but the
point remains that Shankara did not address it. Please
give references, if any, where Shankara refutes a
theory that talks of an agent that is infallible in
its justifications?

folks; apparently they think that advaita represents
the 'hoary traditions' of Upanishads and what not, and
thereby, that it is many more centuries older than
dvaita is.

Hello! don't you have the term 'dUShaNAnumAna' in

Wrong. vAyu, even in its gross form, is rUparahita.
That it takes the form of container is a 'strawman'
(using your terminology) objection, for, the container
is the upAdhi. Does the air in front of you have any
form?

If you consider that vAyu-tanmAtra is rUpa-rahita, and
if you accept that tanmAtras of different types (i.e.
with mutually contradictory attributes) can get mixed,
that too proves the point that entities of mutually
contradictory can co-exist.

Actually, most of your questions/arguments are largely
impertinent because you forgot the premises that Jayna
laid out. Nobody sees the tanmatrAs or knows about
panchIkaraNa without the aid of shruti/smriti.

*chomp*

Jayna, this is a question to you. I have used the word
'co-existence' in exactly the same way when you said:
"A co-existence of the Self that is of the nature of
consciousness with the body that is of the nature of
the unconscious".

There is no need for me to answer any question. Read
Kartik's mail again. Experience is one of the
premises. If you think any of the above is not an
experience, but a postulate -- that would be a
postulate.

Yes, yes. I was just supplying the phrase you forgot.

shruti seems to have more prAjna than the entity it is
describing.

In any case, that is hardly a rejoinder to explain
prabhuH, devaH, turyaH. These words follow 'atraite
shlokA bhavanti' (which, I am not sure, you take it as
shruti).  Please note that the Brihadaranyaka says: yo
vai chaturthaM tat.h turIyam.h. (Also, note the nice
adjective that BU gives for turIya: the handsome!
