Mm. BNK Sharma quotes two sets of lines from
Advaitasiddhi:

1. sAxiNaH bhrama-pramAsAdhAraNyena
pramANAbAdhakatvAt.h | (I did not search for this one,
the next one proves the point that A-siddhi's
conception of sAkShi is quite different from Vidya's
ideas.)

2. chaitanyasya svarUpato doShAjanyatve.api
tadavachChedikayA avidyAvR^itterdoShajanyatvAt.h | 
tatpratiphalitachaitanyasyaiva sAxipadArthatvAt.h |

Thus sAkshi is that which is the reflection of
chaitanya in avidyAvR^itti. Does this err or not?
Further:

advaitatAtparyagrahasya cha pratyaxAdyavirodhena
pramArUpatayA doShatvAbhAvAt.h na
tajjanyamadvaitaj~nAnaM bAdhyaM |

Next,

bhramajanyatvasya viShayabAdhAprayojakatvAt.h |

Hardly the same thing as 'it knows that all this is
avidyA'. Further on,

avachChedakavR^ittyanityatvenacha __ sAxipratyakShasya
doShajanyatvokteH __ settles the matter. 

Regards,
Krishna
