Book 2 of Kisari Mohan Ganguli's translation of the Mahabharata, The
Sabha Parva is available for download from http://www.sripedia.org

Note: There have been many hundreds of downloads of the various sripedia
etexts thanks to their availability in the public domain.  Signing the
petition below will help keep many such etexts possible.

Lawrence Lessig - Stanford Law Professor - is requesting that people sign a
petition to the US Congress reqesting that they place a $1 fee on copyright
owners to extend the copyright after 50 years, this would ensure that those
who were not alive, who did not want to etc. would have their works enter
the public domain automatically, unlike the way in which it is now i.e. they
remain copyrighted unless explicitly placed in the public domain.

You can find the petition here
