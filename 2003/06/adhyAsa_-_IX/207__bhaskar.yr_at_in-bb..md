praNAm prabhuji
Hare Krishna

Thanks a lot for your series of mails on Adhyasa.  But I wonder, I've
learnt nothing new from the last 5 parts!!! (I dont know how other members
are getting benefited from these mails).  There is lot of repitition & you
have added nothing new to the topic of superimposition.  Hence, I humbly
request you to cut short your monotonous mails & tell us what is the exact
problem you are facing with shankara's adhyAsa bhAshya in a condensed 4-5
points.  That would help the list members to address those points
strightaway instead of going through your caravan of mails.  This will help
you to save your time also I believe.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
