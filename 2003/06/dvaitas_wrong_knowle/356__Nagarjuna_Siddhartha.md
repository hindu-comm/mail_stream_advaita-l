Dear Jay, you are not doing justice to advaita here.
Even your arguments of independance and dependance
lead to advaita only. According to you, since the rose
plant is absolutely and eternally dependant on
brahman, it must not have a self-nature. Because it
makes no sense in talking about an eternally and
absolutely dependant self-nature. For the self-nature
of an object is not dependant on anything else. (This
is the dialectic of the buddhist philosopher
Nagarjuna). Extending the argument to the world, it is
inferred that nothing ever, other than brahman, has
any self-nature. Here you would be finding yourself in
the tight embrace of advaita. Whether you like it or
not, you are strengthening the cause of advaita.
