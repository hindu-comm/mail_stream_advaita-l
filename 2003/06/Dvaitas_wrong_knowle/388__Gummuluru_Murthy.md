namaste shri Anand,

You have made a very valid point. The moderators of the List
are conspicuous by their absence and, in my view, are doing
a dis-service to the List, a List which says it is following 
shri shankara's philosophy. While shri shankara's teachings 
are maligned and thrown dirt all over, the List moderators 
allow these postings without even a whimper. I recall 
days when moderators used to intervene saying such and 
such posts are not allowed because they do not follow 
shri shankara's philosophy. To say that the dvaita 
follows shruti and hence these posts are allowed (shri 
jaldhar's feeble recent justification for allowing these 
posts) may be justifiable (i) if there is active point-by-point
debate by learned scholars on both sides, *and* (ii) if
the List mandate is amplified that such debates are allowed, 
*and* (iii) if such debate serve the needs of the List members
as per the moderators' judgement. 

I personally felt the last three weeks of debates a huge noise 
and a waste of time for everyone and specially for me.


Regards
Gummuluru Murthy
