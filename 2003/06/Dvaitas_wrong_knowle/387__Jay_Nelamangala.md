Dear Anand,

I feel the same of late.  Here is what I propose to do.

Having started the series on adhyAsa,   I will only keep that thread.
That too,  I will wind up with couple more postings.

The Dvaita replies and counter-replies to buddhists who want to
support advaita will not be on this List,  but only directly to that person.

I will only reply to SadAnanda, Bhaskar-jI and the moderators of the List,

Rest of them are more accusatory and offensive as the subject of this
email "Dvaita's wrong knowledge" should indicate.

When one runs out of pramANas, arguments start, when one runs
out of arguments, petty arguments start,  when that one fails too
accusations will start.   That is the story in every Email discussion.

  Subject: [Advaita-l] Dvaita's wrong knowledge


  I find lately that the list has been taken over by Dvaitins, Vishishtadvaitins and Buddhists discussing and explaining Advaita, its drawbacks and shortfalls. And some taking sides too !!!. I am not a very learned member of this list, but I find that except Karthik Jayanarayanan and sometimes Sankaran Aniruddhan, other learned members havent joined in these discussions to refute the claims made by members of the other school. Jaldhar Vyas is very conspicuous by his absence. No offence intended. Just wondering. Because there are lot of novices in advaita here and so much of talk over Dvaita being correct about interpreting Shruti and stuff like that can be damaging to the minds of new entrants who tend to get confused. While at the learning stage, it is advised to keep yourself to the philosophy of your choice, which you have chosen to study and  you are advised to keep away from books and articles of other philosophies. Once you are well learned in your area, you can then venture reading, listening and confronting other schools of thought. 
  All this is only my musings. No offence intended.

  Regards
  Anand K
