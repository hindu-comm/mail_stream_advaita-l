Namaste,

I had a couple of more mails to respond to, but saw this one
accidentally. I joined recently to know advaita and its tradition
properly. But unfortunately for me, Madhusudana Saraswati's words (that
advaita must first refute the established duality to proceed) have
shown their effect.

No more mails from me. I have promised K.Sadananda garu, a mail on
sAkShi, which I will send personally. 

Also, in my opinion, dvaita was/is also not presented correctly on many
ideas. The methodology and the analysis have been missed out by Jay and
only the conclusions have been presented. Which is why it was a waste
of time even for a dvaitin!

Regards,
Krishna
