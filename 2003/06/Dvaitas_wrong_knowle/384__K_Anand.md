I find lately that the list has been taken over by Dvaitins, Vishishtadvaitins and Buddhists discussing and explaining Advaita, its drawbacks and shortfalls. And some taking sides too !!!. I am not a very learned member of this list, but I find that except Karthik Jayanarayanan and sometimes Sankaran Aniruddhan, other learned members havent joined in these discussions to refute the claims made by members of the other school. Jaldhar Vyas is very conspicuous by his absence. No offence intended. Just wondering. Because there are lot of novices in advaita here and so much of talk over Dvaita being correct about interpreting Shruti and stuff like that can be damaging to the minds of new entrants who tend to get confused. While at the learning stage, it is advised to keep yourself to the philosophy of your choice, which you have chosen to study and  you are advised to keep away from books and articles of other philosophies. Once you are well learned in your area, you can then venture reading, listening and confronting other schools of thought. 
All this is only my musings. No offence intended.

Regards
Anand K
