Sri Sadananda and Sri Vidyasankar tried to discuss some points with them,
but as with many inter-vedantic discussions, it reaches a point of
disagreement on basics. After that, there is no point in debating about each
others' positions. However, discussion to clarify the respective positions
of the different vedantic schools is always possible.

I agree. Such debates can be learning processes, but usually more for
advanced aspirants than for beginners like me. I would rather get the basics
of advaita right first.
