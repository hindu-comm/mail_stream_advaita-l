Thanks man.   No need to be sorry.  That is a good one.
Atleast my posting helped you learn a new english word :-)
That is the whole point in posting these series.
We all get to know new things, that we did not care about all
these days.
I am also learning some new things about advaita everyday.

O Sure.

That is where - the knower, the object that is known and knowledge of that
object,  some call it triputee - or triad of knowledge,  comes into picture.
When the knowledge of that object, reveals that object to the knower,  the
knower comes to know that object.

When that knowledge reveals it as the object is,  then it is true knowledge.
When that knowledge reveals it as some other object,  then it is wrong
knowledge.

Say,  three people look at an object ( say a shell)  and come to
different conclusions - one as silver,  one as diamond,  and another as
shell -
then the first two got wrong knowledge, and third one got correct knowledge.
That is why,  wrong knowledge always comes in many varieties,  and there
can be  only one variety in correct knowledge.

You may ask how come they came to different conclusions?

Under normal conditions they don't.   That is why,  in broad-day light,
a snake is a snake for everyone,  and a rope is a rope for everyone.
When it is dark,  not enough light,  some may percieve rope as snake.

If you are a snake expert,  even when there is not enough light,
still you may see a rope as clearly a rope only,  because you know
the subtle differneces between how a snake curls and a rope curls and
also because you don't get very excited and scared when you see an
actual snake.   So, you will make an attempt to pick it up anyway, and
that is when you will know for sure if it is a snake or not.

That is why,  karma / adhrshTa are included while explaining wrong
knowledge.  'karma'  is what you have been doing all these days in this
life and also in your previous lives.   That is sum total of your
experience.
That is what makes you what you are today,  is'nt it?

If you have been busy with snakes all your life,  then that "karma"
will help you not to get wrong knowledge  easily when you see a rope.
On the other hand, if you have been busy with PCs and keyboards,
then you will easily get that wrong knowledge
when you see a rope in a dimly lit area.

If in your past experience (karma)  you have never seen a diamond,  then
when you see a shining  shell,  there is no possibility of getting the wrong
knowledge that it is a diamond.  So, the thing that you think it is,
must already be in your previous experience.  That is where 'karma' comes
into picture. Then,  there may be many shiny things that  could be in
your prior experience - glass, plastic, aluminium foil, silver etc
Which one of these will you get confused to when you see a shining shell?
That is where adrshTa ( luck) comes into picture.

I hope I answered your question.
