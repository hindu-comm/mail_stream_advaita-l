Thank you sir.

Shruti and Shruti context is same for both advaita and dvaita.
Asking one to look at the upanishadic context,  can hardly be called
"throwing dirt".

There is only  one  sAkshI, one Jiva, one ParamAtman, one pramA, etc
for all humans.   dvaita and advaita  models of these may be different.
To expose the limitations, inconsistencies in the advaitic model can hardly
be called maligning and throwing dirt on advaita.

I am glad that  Jaladhar Vyas, as a moderator  took the trouble to speak
out.
