My friends,

I think you guys are over reacting.  Please see the context in which
I said what I said.

This has direct reference to the advaitic model of pramA which was
compared to the dvatic model in a previous posting.   This has direct
reference to comparisons of sAkshI-A and sAkshi-D which has drawn
attention from some readers.

If you ignore this context,  of course,  you can always draw implications
such as:
"He is *directly* implying that Shankara and his disciples were
inconsistent!"

You are free to draw such implications,  but do not blame it one me.
Show me where I have mentioned Acharya Shankara in the article on
"dvaita and advaita on pramA"  before you make such statements.
