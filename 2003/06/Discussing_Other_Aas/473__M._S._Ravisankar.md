At least two members, Sri Sadananda and Sri Kartik broached this matter in
the recent past.

Beyond a certain degree, that is, other than the limited context of
puurvapaxa, it is not appropriate to discuss vishishhTadvaita, dvaita, etc.
in Advaita-L. If one wants to learn those schools in depth and understand
related issues, it is better that they join discussion forums such as,

 http://www.dvaita.org/list/ (for dvaita),

 http://groups.yahoo.com/group/bhakti-list/ (for vishishhTaadvaita) and so
on.

Certainly, Advaita-L was not created for such a cross platform discussion
and should not take that burden.

I understand that there is no active neutral forum such as
Soc.Religion.Hindu now. But those who are interested to have such a
discussion should come forward  to create a new one and moderate it. I sure
such a list/forum is possible with guidance of eminent members such as
Vidyasankar Sundaresan, Shrisha Rao,  Jaldhar Vyas, Ram V Chandran, K.
Sadananda, and others (with representation from all schools of thought).



Thanks.

Ravi
