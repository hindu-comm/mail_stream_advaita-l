I agree with Ravi - while there is some merit to understanding the different (and perhaps similar) aspects of dvaita and visishtAdvaita, there is little room in a forum such as this for such discussions. And for the more inclined, there are these other resources mentioned.

As far as purva paksha is concerned, I think we should recognize that we stand on the shoulders of giants and recognize that there is a purva paksha that has been largely sidelined in favour of the advaita vedanta thought. Understanding it may help to clear where the acharya is coming from, but trying to get it all, for me atleast, is over stepping. My suggestion is to take baby steps.

bhava shankara desikame sharaNam

  Subject: [Advaita-l] Discussing Other Aastika Schools


  At least two members, Sri Sadananda and Sri Kartik broached this matter in the recent past. 

  Beyond a certain degree, that is, other than the limited context of puurvapaxa, it is not appropriate to discuss vishishhTadvaita, dvaita, etc. in Advaita-L. If one wants to learn those schools in depth and understand related issues, it is better that they join discussion forums such as,

   http://www.dvaita.org/list/ (for dvaita),

   http://groups.yahoo.com/group/bhakti-list/ (for vishishhTaadvaita) and so on.

  Certainly, Advaita-L was not created for such a cross platform discussion and should not take that burden. 

  I understand that there is no active neutral forum such as Soc.Religion.Hindu now. But those who are interested to have such a discussion should come forward  to create a new one and moderate it. I sure such a list/forum is possible with guidance of eminent members such as Vidyasankar Sundaresan, Shrisha Rao,  Jaldhar Vyas, Ram V Chandran, K. Sadananda, and others (with representation from all schools of thought).



  Thanks.

  Ravi
