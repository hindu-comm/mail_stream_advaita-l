Correction:

 When astronauts walk on the moon,  they only see dark sky
 even when sun is present there,  because of the lack of
 atmosphere there, so there is diffraction.

Should read  as :

 When astronauts walk on the moon,  they only see dark sky
 even when sun is present there,  because of the lack of
atmosphere there,  there is NO diffraction.
