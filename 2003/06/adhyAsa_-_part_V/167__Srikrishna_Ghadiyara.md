You said it right. Advaita Vedanta should not CONCLUDE
'Adhyasa' of Atma and anAtma because colour of a red
flower gets superimposed/reflected in crystal. But,
who told you that Advaita Vedanta uses this as a
'CONCLUDING' evidence of Atma-anAtma adhyAsa ?? It is
meant to be an illustration only, as you wanted.

But, do you see they did not say that the same red
colour gets superimposed in an opaque material. !! i.e
the same Atma gets reflected in my opaque body through
sukshma sareera etc.. through 'IDENTIFICATION' not
through 'SUPERIMPOSITION'. It was just meant to be an
example/illustration/anology. Every illustration has
its own limitations. Otherwise the illustrated would
have remained the 'original' itself. 

If it is simply stated that the Atma and anatmA get
mutual-superimposition, then someone will ask what is
mutual-superimposition. Just for this purpose an
example is given to illustrate how the qualities can
get transferred to another entity (in proximity)!.
Here it is not said that Atma is crystal.

The example is only illustarating that this One and
Only Chid Vastu of the Universe gets very intricately
mixed up with (its own projection) anAtma. In this
perspective, I do not see any objection to adhyasa.

Om Namo Narayanaya !!
