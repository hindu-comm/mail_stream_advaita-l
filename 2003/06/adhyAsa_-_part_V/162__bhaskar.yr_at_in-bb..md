This also does not hold good. There  cannot be the superposition

the redness that is superposed on the stone,  but the flower also.
The flower is reflected in the stone and so its  redness. So the
properties of Atman cannot be superimposed on  anAtman without
Atman being superimposed.

on space..is it not?? though we cannot objectify the adhishtAna/substratum
*space* (AkASa) we think that the locus of bluness is AkASa.
