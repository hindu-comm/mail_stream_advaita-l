I have specifically in mind one of the oldest editions of Epigraphia 
Carnatica, brought out by B. Lewis Rice, one of the British colonial 
administrators attached to the Mysore court. The Mysore Gazetteer used to be 
a periodic publication, which was brought out till before the linguistic 
reorganization of states, when the then Mysore state was merged into 
Karnataka.

In Mumbai, the best bet to search for these publications would be the 
Asiatic Society library, or perhaps the University library. The high court 
library is also a possibility. One might have to hunt for them deeply 
though. I remember one half-verse that runs "akshobhyaM kshobhayAmAsa 
vidyaraNya mahAmuniH." Of course, the dvaitins quote a half-verse that says 
something like "vidyAraNyaM mahAraNyam akshobhyamunir achinnat."

Re: appayya dIkshita, it is known that he debated a lot with 
vijayIndratIrtha of the uttarAdi maTha tradition of the mAdhva-s, which used 
to be based in Tamil Nadu at the time. Who defeated whom is again a matter 
of disagreement, with conflicting claims on each side. Anyway, all of this 
is past history ...
