Namaste all,

Having looked back over the discussions from a year
ago I find that some parts are specific to that time
so maybe it is best to start again but I may find some
aspects relevant later on.
Also since that time I have acquired some other
versions of the Kena Upanishad...such as
Radhakrishnan's and Som Raj Gupta's that bring in
individual interpretations.
I am putting below the transliterated text with
efforts at brief translations of most words.  This is
for future reference and may be of value to some
people to cut and paste.
So that this posting does not become too cluttered I
will send another with the English translation of the
Upanishad later on today.  That posting will also have
a few first thoughts on the first Shloka.

May this study be of use,

Ken Knight
