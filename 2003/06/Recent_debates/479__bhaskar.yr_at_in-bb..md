praNAm Jaldhar prabhuji
Hare Krishna

prabhuji you suggested :

One should first learn the upanishad(s) that belong to ones shakha.

>  prabhuji is it indispensable for smArthAs to do *shiva panchAyatana
pUja* or nitya devatArchana before undertaking upanishad studies in a
traditional manner??  I was told by one of vedic pundits that apart from
sandhya vandanam one should perform vidhi pUrvaka nitya devatArchana before
persuing studies in vedanta.  Pls. clarify.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
