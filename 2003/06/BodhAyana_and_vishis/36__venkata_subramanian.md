Well, 

i may draw your attention to a masterly work in
Sankrit by the Late Polakam Sri Rama Sastry published
by the Madras University.

 it clearly points out that it is highly doubful
whether Bodhayana was a Visishtadvaitin.  even more,
it well articulates whether bodhayana has actually
written any Vritti on the Brahma Sutras. he shows that
such a proposition is very much doubtfull.  

 i feebly remember that the name of Sastri's work is
Dravidatreya Darshanam.

Elsewhere, it is well proved that the Vrithi kara of
Sri Shankaracharya's Bhashya is NOT Bodhayana.

Thanks & Regards,
Venkat.

Sadgurubhyo Namah.
