There are so many branches of advaita today that,  it may be
almost impossible to do 'samanvaya' within advaita itself.
If you have studied naishkarmya siddhi, bhAmatii,  vivaraNa,
advaita-siddhi and all the modern day neo-advaitins,  then you
probably  know that we get a variety of definitions of terms
and a variety of answers to certain philosophical questions.

What you mentioned above are all the story of post shankara's era.  Just
ignore the various theories propounded by post shankara advaitins, why dont
you study the genuine shankara's prasthana trayi bhAshya in original text &
do samanvaya according to  shankara's atmaikatvavAda.... just an
inquisitive question...
