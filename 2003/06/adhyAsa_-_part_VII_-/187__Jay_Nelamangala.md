Dear SriKrishna,

I am also an elementary student of shAstra.

There are so many branches of advaita today that,  it may be
almost impossible to do 'samanvaya' within advaita itself.
If you have studied naishkarmya siddhi, bhAmatii,  vivaraNa,  
advaita-siddhi and all the modern day neo-advaitins,  then you 
probably  know that we get a variety of definitions of terms
and a variety of answers to certain philosophical questions.

So, experts in advaita,  such as moderators of this group
can put thier heads together and make an attempt  towards
what you are asking me to do.

The school of thought that I come from,  we don't have that
problem,  and  knowledge-A  is not acceptable to sAkshee-D 
as true knowledge because it is not coherent with experience.
