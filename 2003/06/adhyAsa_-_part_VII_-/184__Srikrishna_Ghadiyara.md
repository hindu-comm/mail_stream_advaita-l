Hari Om !!

Your gloss on 'Adhyasa' is totally mis-construed, and
uneducated. It is akin to taking the details/stories
given  in a Elementary schools book, and preparing
your PhD desertation. You have posted seven articles,
without even mentioning the fundamental definition.
'Adhyasa' is neither rope nor shell.

"atasmin tad budhih - adhyasa" - In any thing 'That'
is not, 'That Budhi' is adhyasa.  This much is enough.
I may be sleeping and someone may think a huge python
is lying there. There are no rules about it. This
erroneous notion is adhyasa, and it is caused because
the 'Truth' is not known. This lack of knowledge of
'Truth' is because of 'Ignorance'. If you want to
create a false theory and give countless posts and
represent the level of understanding of other schools,
it will only be exposing their limited understanding
and waste of time.

Om Namo Narayanaya !!
