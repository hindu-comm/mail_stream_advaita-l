You are right.  When I say "substratum of knowing etc.,"
it is meant  "substratum"   of knowing, action, enjoying etc.

Knowledge itself is eternal, self-evident, undifferenciated
unity called "chit".

"ahamkArasya anadyanirvachanIyAvidyA upAdAnam" 
    - VivaraNa pramEya samgraha of Sri VidyAraNya
anirvachanIya avidyA is the material cause of  ahamkAra.

"avidyAyAha paramEshwara adhishTitatvam nimittam |
jnAnashaktikriyAshakti dvayam svarUpam | kUTastha
chaitanyam pramANam |  kartrtvabhOktrtvAdikam cha
kAryam | "

You also need to understand,  "vishaya chaitanya"
and "pramANa chaitanya" to know this "knowing" in
advaita vEdAnta and see how it all works.
Let me know if you are keen on it.

(Tomorrow I am out on business, so no emails from me)

Blue sky was not in my series.  It was brought out by
Sri Bhaskarji,  and I myself had several questions on
the blue-sky example,  so I had to ask them.

Thanks and regards,
