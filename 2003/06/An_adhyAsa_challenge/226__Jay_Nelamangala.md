Precisely.   This adhyAsa series is being written  so that
it provides an opportunity for  knowledgeable people like you
and others in this group who can educate all of us with works such as 
Naishkarmya siddhi etc.

If Sri BAdarAyaNa himself had supported the adhyAsa theory,  
then Sri Madhwa would have followed suite, and  I could have
helped you with your request.   But that is not the case.  In fact,
I would like to know myself  where adhyAsa-theory is found in
prasthAna-traya !!.   You need to find it out more than I do.

I am the minority in this group :-)
I don't mean to hurt anyone,  I do respect the knowledge of
Sri VidyAshankar ,  Sri SadAnanda and others of the list.

I am as human as anyone else in this group, nothing more
nothing less.   I  do make my set of ommisions and sometimes
unintentionally hurt the other person while trying to make a point,
especially when I have to answer a large number of questions in
a day.

But who is saying they are superposed in the first place?
