Read again Jayna, "For, it is only in the presence of
a container, you are __assuming__ that it has a form".

You are stretching the analogy beyond what it was
meant for. The analogy was given to contradict your
point that two objects with mutually contradictory
attributes cannot co-exist. Now, your reason for
rejecting the analogy is different from your original
point: that one of the two objects is partaking the
nature of other. That is unfair; just the same that
you would react to an objection to your analogy of
light/darkness because 'consciousness is not made of
photons'.

In any case, you have assumed that vAyu in my analogy
corresponds to consciousness. That is wrong. Just like
the earth co-exists with formless air, yet does not
partake any properties of air, so too does
consciousness not partake *anything* of the nature of
the unconscious. If you were to complain that the
unconscious is still partaking the nature of
conscious; that never was your objection in the first
place (yes, 'direction' of partaking matters). 

Moreover, it is also the case your doctrine holds that
it is quite possible that the reflection of chaitanya
in a non-chaitanya medium can act _as if it were_
chaitanya. But it does not mean the non-chaitanya
medium has partaken 'chaitanyatva', right? It's the
same with vAyu in the analogy I gave.

Anyway, what exactly did you mean by 'partaking' the
attributes of container? Are you saying the air
actually obtains, partially or fully, the 'taTastha
laxaNa' of having a form because of its upAdhi? If
yes, it would become incumbent upon you to accept that
Brahman, whose 'taTastha laxaNa' (sic!) is said to be
creatorship of this marvellous universe, actually
'partakes' it. OTOH, if you were to insist that there
is no actual partaking, that serves the case for vAyu
also; it has no actual partaking; thereby entities
with mutually contradictory attributes can co-exist.
Thus, the analogy stands (don't forget again why the
analogy was made).

I was just wondering about what happens if one were to
throw a beam of light into a blackhole. Given that
there is absence of 'that' light, wouldn't it be
equivalent to saying the light has partaken the nature
of darkness (i.e., its own absence)?

(Note that I am not advancing this argument seriously;
I am just curious as to see how you'd handle it.)

Well, you are agreeing to my point. The need for the
implicit assumption that the disputants will define
terms, arises because we know, we agree, we
understand, we realize the ignorance and incapability
of oneself: one cannot know what the other thinks. And
one is incapable of finding out what it is, without
doing anything abt it (such as issue a warning not to
respond).

Btw, I just need to give you instances of ignorance
and incapability (without giving any spl defintion to
those loaded terms) and if you agree that the
instances do convey such aspects, my point is made.

It is a very artificial condition you are putting on
the debate, Jayna. Why should your evaluation of the
solution be dependent on how it was arrived at? Think
about it. Your evaluation of the solution has not
happened at all.

Did you observe C in your deep sleep?
