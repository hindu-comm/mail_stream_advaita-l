The point about linguistics is understood, but the
reason for quoting people as saying such things gives
credence to the observation that people do, as a
matter of common experience, assume the body to be
intimately related to the Self.

Firstly, leaving aside tradition for now, I would
argue that the above analogy is highly defective since
air is not completely formless. We conceive of a fluid
such as water assuming the form of a container such as
a jug or pot, and rather than being "formless", it is
actually of "flexible form". In the same manner, air
is most definitely not totally formless, it being much
more fluid than water, takes the form of whatever
contains it in any direction, and possesses way more
"flexibility of form" than water.

Secondly, since no analogy can perfectly bring out the
difference between the subject and object of
knowledge, one can only be considered as an
approximation. In this context, the analogy of light
and darkness is much more in line with the original
question. Darkness is exactly the non-existence of
light that illumines an object so that "seeing" can
happen --> very similar to the case of unconsciousness
as the non-existence of consciousness which
"illumines" an object so that "knowing" can happen.
Whereas such is not the case for "form", which does
not "illumine", and hence is not as appropriate for
the discussion as light is.

These are very loaded terms. To claim that
consciousness is "incapable" is absurd. The "capacity"
for consciousness is simply to be conscious. In this
way, it is superbly "capable".

"Ignorant"? Hardly - being the subject of knowledge,
it is in fact the only entity that really "knows".

:-) We still haven't come to the reality of the world,
which being the object of perception, comes much
afterwards.

Since you are not posting a series on adhyAsa, I don't
see why I should quit my adhyAsa postings when you
can't do (quit) the same thing.
