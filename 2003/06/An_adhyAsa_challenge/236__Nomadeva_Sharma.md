Rather your explanation serves no purpose in setting
aside the analogy as defective. For, it is only in the
presence of a container, you are assuming that it has
a form. The container is the upAdhi, the conditioning
factor. Air, by itself, is formless. No container, no
form.

To say something has a 'flexible form', it should have
a default form (which changes according to the
situation). And, by default, air is formless.

In fact, I can use your idea of air_in_container as
further supporting my case that mutually contradictory
attributes are seen to co-exist.

(A Jaina will be happier to extend your analogy to
support his theory.)

Note that your original contention was between
consciousness and rest. That only the rest is an
object of consciousness is your postulate. Experience
says 'I know I am I'. So, you are violating one of
your premises.

Formlessness is exactly the non-existence of form.

It is a bit funny that you first label these terms as
loaded, and proceed to disprove me on the basis of
meanings you assumed.

This very act of yours proves my point that
consciousness is incapable and ignorant to a large
extent: you did not know what I meant by those terms;
nor were you capable of finding out what those mean
according to me, without asking me.

And ideally speaking, your business is only to find if
this solution is satisfactory or not. And that can be
independent of how that solution was arrived at. If
you disagree, I can give the meanings I assumed for
'ignorant' and 'incapable'.

Jayna sir, you need to understand that most people
take world as real and it is in the common
experience-base.

You cannot say that the link between consciousness (C)
and un-C is itself not possible, for, that violates
your basic premise: experience. In fact, no experience
observes C independent of a body. As in any scientific
process, if theories don't match up facts, theories
are given up. In this case, the theory that there
cannot be any link between C and un-C should be given
up. (and it should be understood that your analogy of
'light-darkness' does not represent this case).

My preference was for discontinuance of the original
postings on adhyAsa. Not yours.
