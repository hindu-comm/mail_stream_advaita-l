Mr. Kartik Jayanaryanan,

Namaste.

Why call it a challenge?   It is understanding of adhyAsa.
You are welcome to show where my posting on adhyAsa
is not according to vivaraNa-pramEya-samgraha of Sri
VidyAraNya.

If you are not interested in vEdaanta,  I am not interested
in any discussion with you.  But,  if you think adhyAsa is
according to what is in shruti-smriti-sootras,  then only
I am interested.   Therefore,  this premise is not acceptable.

Declarations and  pramANas are two different things.
If you declare with pramANa, we will discuss it.
If you want to just declare,  have fun.  Don't involve me.

A little bit of study of Geetha,  tells us that body is like
a shirt that we wear.  The jeeva wears it till it gets old, then
throws it away and gets another shirt (body).
So, when the jeeva gets a new body, we say a child is born.
When a jeeva throws away his body, we say the person died.
That is how we explain it.

Thus,  jeeva is the deha-abhimAniNI or the enabler
of body by being in it.  Deha is jada, it can not act on its own.
That is the connection between the two.

If moderators ask me to quit,  I will respect their decision.
Why don't you check with  Jaladhar vyAs first?

I would like to hear from other moderators as well.

Thanks and regards,
