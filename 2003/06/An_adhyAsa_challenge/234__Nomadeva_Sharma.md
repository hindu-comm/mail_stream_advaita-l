This is a matter of linguistic convenience. For eg;
one knows that it is one's fingers that is typing this
mail. Just an observation, not to rule out your
question.

If you used anumAna of light-darkness, here's a
duShaNAnumAna supporting co-existence of mutually
contradictory things (I am not talking of
samanAdhikaraNya, though).

vAyu, one of the panchamahAbhUtas, is generally taken
to be "rUparahitaH sparshavAnvAyuH", while, pR^ithvI
is 'rUpasahitaH'. One notices their co-existence.

If you are asking how the link between consciousness
and body happens, noting that the consciousness is, to
a great extent, incapable and ignorant, I'd postulate
another being, who has inconceivable powers, whose
ichChA shakti can by itself move the world.

Any corresponding quote in the shruti is coincidence
:-)

I'd go for it.

Regards,
Krishna
