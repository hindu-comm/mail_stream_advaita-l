I have a question: If it is the case that different jivas
are already destined for different final states, what is the
use in pursuing vedanta at all? The problem is, none of us
know if we are rajasika, tamasika or satvika jivas (or do
we?). What if I pursue dvaita vedanta and finally find out
that I am a tamasika jiva and hence bound for eternal
damnation? Isn't all my practice of vedanta a waste?
