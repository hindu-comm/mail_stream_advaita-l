There is no assumption AFAI see it. You had agreed
that

is an observation. So, the fact is that whatever that
'I' is, if it is able to grasp time without the aid of
any _external_ instrument. That is why, it is called
'svarUpa-indriya'.

Now, that is an assumption. Indriya is an instrument.

I understand sthUla sharIra. Rest are assumptions (as
long as we don't touch shruti). What is kAraNa-sharIra
(i.e., the original subject of this thread)? Is it
same as liN^ga-sharIra?

Note that I said, 'sAkshi _is_ svarUpa-indriya'. It
perceives itself without the need for any external
sense.

Well, the example I gave in other mail, points out
that atleast time is comprehended in deep-sleep. The
problem is that we cannot poll the guy, to a direct
check, in deep-sleep without bringing him out of
suShupti.

A school asserting that 'svataH prAmANya' must have
atleast one entity that grasps knowledge in the first
place. Since, it is _svataH_ prAmANya, the same entity
must be capable of grasping prAmANya also. 

The question is 'who provides this knowledge and its
prAmANya'? It can very well be an external instrument.


But if a school asserts 'sva-prakAshatva' ALSO, it
must, somewhere in its analysis, accept that the
cognizing agent does not need external
'prakAsha'/means, atleast to know about itself. 

So, if a school believes in both, its cognizing agent
must be an instrument by itself and the validator
also.

The above analysis is purely mine, not that of dvaita
school. I think it is a logical compulsion and not any
personal compulsion. I also think that there cannot be
better explanations of 'svataH prAmANya' and
'svaprakAsha'. If there are any mistakes or better
explanations, let me know. But instead of pointing out
problems, you and Vidyasankar have clearly gone
overboard that I am generalizing. 

This will be the last post from my side on this
thread. 

Regards,
Krishna
