Dear Members,

I request you to  restrict your messages to the list to a maximum of 2
messages per day (per member). Handling a large volume of e-mail is not
possible for all members and one cannot pay attention to the content being
discussed when the mailboxes are flooded at this rate.

Hence, please RESTRICT your contribution to the list to  maximum 2 messages
a day. Please cooperate and follow this guideline to make the discussions
more meaningful.

ADMIN messages are an exception to this request.

Thank you

Ravi
