Because,  SriKrishna is explicitly saying "mAm".  so, how can anyone take
avyakta to be prakrti in 7.24 ?.   So, in 7.24 it refers to Sri Krishna
only.

"avyakta nidhanAnyEva tatra kA paridEvanA".
Here avyakta neither refers to SriKrishna nor to chit-prakrti,  but only to
jeevas.
Whoever told you that  'avyakta' always should refer to chit-prakrti only?

Pl. do not argue with me for the sake of arguing.
With all the shAstraic knowledge that you have,  I am sure you knew this
one.
With all the advaita knowledge you know,  probably you are also aware
of the fact that,  Geetha  probably is the most difficult one to interpret
from
an advaita standpoint.

Why only  two?  I just showed you three different things represented by
'avyakta'
based on the context in which that word appears in the Geeta.

I have already given my answer.  It is your turn now.
