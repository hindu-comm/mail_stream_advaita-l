The shastras contain statements mentioning duality and and non-duality.
Putting them all together it becomes clears that the ones mentioning
non-duality take precedence.

All people are born under three debts.  The debt to the Rshis is fulfilled
by studying the shastras.  So at the beginning, it is purely vyavaharic.
But learning would be pretty pointless if it just told you what you
already know.  What it does is teach you new perspectives.  It slowly
changes you until you develop a desire for moksha. (mumukshatva) and
eventually even that desire burns itself out.
