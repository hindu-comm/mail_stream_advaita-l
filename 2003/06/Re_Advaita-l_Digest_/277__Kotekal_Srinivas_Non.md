OK.... but why do you think so revealed Brahmn (after removing avidya) is of
pAramArthika in nature ? what makes you think so ?  why can't so realized
**Brahmn** be also of vyavahAric reality ? 

Another thing is, if role of shAstra is only "to *remove* avidyaa or
ignorance" ; it does not address the question how that avidyA came in to
picture in the first place ? and that too **on** Brahmn ??
