Dear SriKrishna,

The terms dvaita and advaita are upanishadic terms,  so 
must be understood as their usage is in those VedOpanishats.

dvaita means this world of differeneces.
advaita means parabrahman

I live in this world of differences,  and I am trying to understand
that Parabrahman through those vEdOpanishats by the 
process of 'samanvaya' provided by brahma-sootras.

Now,  you tell me which school  I belong to?
