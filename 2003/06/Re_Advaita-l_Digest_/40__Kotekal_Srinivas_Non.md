Namaste,

>talking proof of highest knowledge. 

How are you so sure that they are talking highest knowledge ? On what basis
?

>How can we ignore them and accept what scriptures say ? After all
>scriptures should not contradict aparoksha jnana.

Well, if you use scriptures to label a particular jnana as 'aparoksha' then
yes scripture should not contradict it's own definition/identification of
such jnana. Without considering scriptures, I am not sure how you are
labeling mystic's knowledge as 'aproksha'. If one considers any mystic is
telling highest truth, then we have to believe every Baba in every nook &
corner of India !

Srinivas.
