Hari Om !!

This is precisely the question. Leaving aside what the
Visishtadvaita or Dvaita or Advaita philosophy says,
why is it that the modern mystics say that 'Advaita'
is their 'DIRECT' experience ? Why do not they say,
that Dvaita is their DIRECT experience. So, is Sruthi
contradictory to this DIRECT experience, if we were to
go by Dvaita or Visishtadvaita expositions ? 

If there are 'Realised' souls coming from these three
different schools of thought, is their DIRECT
realisation different ? 

Om Namo Narayanaya !!
