Why is Sri Jay avoiding to answer this question. I
thought any respectable argument starts with complete
introduction of the participant, and identifying the
schools and gurus is one such important clue to know
the complete basis of an honest open discussion. This
gives an opportunity for the readers to understand
complete argument, and do not have to depend on a
peace-meal approach.

Om Namo Narayanaya !!

Srikrishna
