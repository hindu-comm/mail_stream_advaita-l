Let is not set aside mystics experience. They are
talking proof of highest knowledge. How can we ignore
them and accept what scriptures say ? After all
scriptures should not contradict aparoksha jnana.

Also, my limited understanding is that Advaita Vedanta
does not accept sArupya, aAmippya, sAyujya and sAlokya
muktis. Others can elaborate.

Om Namo Narayanaya !!
