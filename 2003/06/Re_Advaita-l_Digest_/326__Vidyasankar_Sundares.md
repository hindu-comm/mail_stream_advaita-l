Simple. So long as embodiment exists, sAkshI-A uses his buddhi and can 
decide what is samyag-jnAna and what is mithyA-jnAna. Seeing through 
everything, he remains silent.

Not so fast. As I mentioned above, sAkshI-A has buddhi as an adjunct.

Please curb the tendency to make such generalizations. I request the 
dvaitins who are taking part in this discussion to let us advaitins decide 
for ourselves what we accept and what we reject.

Elsewhere, there has been talk of svarUpendirya. So your conception of 
sAkshI-D as jIva says that he has indriyas different from "normal" indriyas. 
Pray tell me which Sruti or smRti or nyAya establishes such a thing.

That is a misunderstanding of sAMkhya. purusha is never a creator either.

None, so long as you give up the sAMkhya ideas of multiple purusha-s and of 
an independent prakRti.
See gItA 13.24 and its commentary (by Sankara, of course) for why I say 
this.
