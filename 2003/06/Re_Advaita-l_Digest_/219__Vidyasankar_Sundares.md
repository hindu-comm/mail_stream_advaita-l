>'advaitaM' part, we also note that this same 'advaita'

And you know, we consider that your opinion about what is illogical is 
contrary to the express words of Sruti. Please note that the upanishat does 
not use the word turyaH, but says caturthaH. Please also note that this 
caturthaH is na antaHprajna na bahishprajna, ... na prajna, na aprajna.
