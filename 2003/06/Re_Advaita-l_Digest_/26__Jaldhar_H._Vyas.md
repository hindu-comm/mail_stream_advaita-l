The founders of all those other sampradayas :-)

Ok it's a slight exaggeration but its true they devote a major part of
their energies to refuting Advaita Vedanta.  They have to because Advaita
Vedanta is indisputably the first and most comprehensive explanation of
Brahmavidya.  On the other hand Advaita Vedanta stands on its own without
needing to make reference to these others.

I think this is a futile line of argument to take because "modern mystics"
tend to be completely ignorant of the broad range of thought in India and
think Advaita Vedanta is all there is to it.  As flattering as it may seem
to us, we must correct them because we serve truth above all.
