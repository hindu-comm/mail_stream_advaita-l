So?.    I don't see its relevance to the case being discussed.

When a person that can speak  keeps saying "I am dumb"
then it does'nt make him dumb.   That is the case being discussed.
It only makes him self contradictory.    Similarly,  to ascertain
attributes called "attributelessness" and "partlessness" to an entity
does not make it partless and attributeless.  It only makes it
self-contradictory.

This "Neti Neti" is another passage that we have to take a closer look at
in the context of that upanishat.   I will do it sometime soon.

Which shruti told you Brahman is partless and attributeless?  May I ask?
I take it as a compliment that you remembered me as having great
concern for shruti.  My concern is shruti interpreted with the help of
sootras.

It is upto you.  But in my opinion,  this  gives me a chance to verify
the soundness of my own understanding of  shruti-sootras-geetha.
So I do not consider as mere vAg-vilApana.
We can keep it more friendly,  I do respect your knowledge of shAstra.

As for the three AchAryas,  yes I do respect them

In my school,  Sri Shankara is considered as an  incarnation of Shiva,
Sri RAmAnuja is considered as an incarnation of AdiShEsha,
and Sri Madhwa is considered the third avatAra of vAyu, after hanuma and
bheema.

So how can I disrespect any of  them?  or pretend to  respect any of them?
I disagree with some of the tenets of  philosophy of Sri Shankara, because
our
AchAryas have taken the trouble of exposing the "internal inconsistencies"
in
advaita before arriving at their own philosophies.

But,  Sri Shankara did not have to do it,  because dvaita was just not
there.
He had to deal with mainly poorva-mImAmsaa and Buddhism which he
has successfully done.
Some people blindly say that Sri GoudapAda had already done it with dvaita.
But one should study AnuvyAkhyAna and NyAya-sudhA before making
such statements.
