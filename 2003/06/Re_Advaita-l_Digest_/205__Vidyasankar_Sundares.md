Nobody. Rather, my stance is that YOU are wrong in taking avyakta as prakRti 
(or as you call it, cit-prakRti, whatever that may mean - we advaitin-s 
don't use that term) in verse 12.1.

Please! What is that supposed to mean?

As far as I am concerned, gItA is advaitAmRtavarshiNI.

Finally, even if you take avyakta in 12.1 as SrI tattva, how does that imply 
that brahma in verses 14.26-27 refer to mahAlakshmI? After all, in 14.26, 
Krishna again says, "mAM".
