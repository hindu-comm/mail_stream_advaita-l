There is no dispute that the Knowledge of Brahman is a
blessing. Neither am I saying that the mystic
Experience is 'superior' to the Vedic pramana. What I
am asking is about the DIRECT experience of the
mystic. Is it in any way different in 'quality'
envisaged in the Vedas ??  If it is not so, then why
are people insisting on explanations which are not
supported by these DIRECT experiences ? I am not
worried that the mystic is not prescribing certain
theories of evolution etc. etc.  I am purely
interested in that DIRECT knowledge. Is it Advaitic or
Dvaitic ??

Om Namo Narayanaya !!

Srikrishna
