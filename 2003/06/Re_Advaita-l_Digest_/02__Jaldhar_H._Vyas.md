Actually what is being called the womb is mahadbrahma.  Many translations
unhelpfully give this as "the large Brahman" or "the great Brahman" which
apart from not making much sense, is completely off the mark.

Shankaracharya says mahatvAdbharaNAccha svavikArANAM mahadbrahma iti yoniH
eva vishiShyate

Mahat in Samkhya philosophy is the manifest form of Prakriti which evolves
(devolves?) into the three gunas.  This shloka echoes the ancient theory
of creation as the sexual union of the divine male and female principles.

I don't see where Mahalakshmi is mentioned here.

I don't see why.  I can say I know "seven" without necessarily knowing
seven seas, seven sages, seven continents etc...

In other words one can know an abstract concept without knowing each of
its concrete applications.

But this refers to the lover knowledge not the higher one.  In fact Shruti
does give positive descriptions of Brahman viz. Om or sacchidananda or
satyam jnanam anantam etc.

Where Advaita Vedantins part company with Mimamsakas is that we say after
a certain point shastra _does_ become useless.  So our Acharyas weren't
too worried about this.

If one defines knowledge as collecting "facts" about God then you are
correct.  Such a task is futile.  But what is being asked is a different
kind of knowledge -- of the true nature of God.

Perhaps that is plausible for param but for satyam jnanam anantam?  These
are not 'abodes' of Brahman or attributes but its very nature.

You say he reaches 'his' completeness?  But if his completeness is not the
same as Brahman then how can it be advaita?
