Dear SriKrishna,

All these saints or 'yati's are no ordinary people.
They have to be respected by all,  even if we 
do not subscribe to their school of thought fully.
Each AchArya has come here for a definite purpose, 
and they have done their part.

People have also run away from sanyAsa to lead married life.
It all depends on that individual person.   A mandana mishra
who was a buddhist became surEshwarAchArya of naishkarmya
siddhi fame.   The first four students of Sri Madhwa were all
great advaitic scholars of their times.

Any personal experience is 'limited to' and 'limited by' that person
hence the need for an apourushEya vEda.
"tamEvam vidvAn amrita iha bhavati nAnyah panthA ayanAya vidyatE"
There should be a reason why Veda insists on the knowledge of
Parabrahman, don't you think?
