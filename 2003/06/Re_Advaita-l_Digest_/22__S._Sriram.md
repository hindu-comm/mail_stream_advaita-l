Because from a visistadvaitic perspective jivanmukti is not possible,
If a soul is associated with a body, it is a karmic body unless the soul
having attained moksa choses a body of its free will in which case the
body is not a karmic body.

Souls in karmic bodies cannot be in a state of release as long as it is
associated with a body.

Ch.Up. 8-12-1
... na vai sasharirasya satah priyApriyayOh apahatirasti...
There is no cessation of pleasure and pain for one who 
is embodied.

Thanks
