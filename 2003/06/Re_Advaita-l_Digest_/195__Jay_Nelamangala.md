Dear VidyAshankar,

>that Sruti is meaningless when it says, "yato vAco nivartante" - the very
>sentence uses vAk. According to your thinking, it is impossible to say
"yato
>vAco nivartante", but see, Sruti does say it.

Shruti is not meaningless.  If we interpret it to mean Brahman is avAchya
then it becomes meaningless.

"yatO vAchO nivartantE aprApya manasA saha"
That is why this shruti is interpreted by us as "Brahman can not be
known completely" through words,  nor can  He be comprehended fully by the
mind.
