Dear Vidyaashankar,

>>SriKrishna has already declared what this Brahma is.
>>"mama yOnir mahad brahma tasmin garbham dadAmyaham"
>>So, the Brahma in this context is mahAlakshmI.

>No, that is your peculiar interpretation. Nowhere in the gItA is there room
>to explain it so.

It is not peculiar.   The 12th chapter begins with that question.
UpAsanA of  avyaktA ( chit-prakrti) or You ( SriKrishna) which is better?.

SriKrishna answers:

mayyavaeshya manO yae maam nityayuktaa upAsate |
"shradhdhayaa parayOpEtaasteme yuktatamA mataaha" 12.2
"klEshO adhikarastEshAm avyaktAsakta chEtasAm"
"te prapnuvanti mam eva"

That is where it is coming from.

Some interpret 'avyakta' here as the unmanifested God,
 the 'vyakta' God SriKrishna,  and start the 12th chapter as

aE-vam   sa-ta-ta-yu-ktA  yaE
bha-ktA-stvAm  pa-ryu-pA-sa-taE |
yaE  cA-pya-xa-ra-ma-vya-ktam
taE-SHAm   kaE   yO-ga-vi-tta-mAH || 12.1
Which is considered to be more perfect, those who are properly engaged in
Your
devotional service, or those who worship the impersonal Brahman, the
unmanifested?

But  SriKrishna has already rejected it by saying
avyaktam vyaktimaapannam manyante maam abudhdhayaha || 7.24 ||
Only the un-intelligent think that I have manifested from the Unmanifested
impersonal Brahman.

So,  what do you think  this avyaktaa  is?  if it is not chit-prakrti or
Shree- tattva.
