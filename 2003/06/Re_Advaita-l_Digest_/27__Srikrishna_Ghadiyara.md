I am not flattered by the mystics conclusion. I would
also agree that the mystic may not be familiar with
different philosophic theories of India. I am
accepting all such opinions/limitations.

What I am saying is that the mystic has 'Aparoksha'
knowledge. What does that knowledge signify/convey ?
All of them seem to be saying ONENESS, non-duality.
Ofcouse none seems to refer to Advaita Vedanta. They
simply say Advaita or non-duality. My question is if
Duality is the Ultimate Truth why none comes to such
conclusions out of their mystic experiences ?

Om Namo Narayanaya !!

Srikrishna
