This is a distinction without a difference. When you know that there is 
nothing that is really superimposed there, you have already done the apavAda 
of adhyAropa.

You agree that the sky is not inherently blue. The blueness is a property of 
the diffraction due to the atmosphere. Nowadays, everybody who has gone to 
school knows the physical reason behind it. Yet, people (including 
scientists) say all the time, "The sky is blue." They exclaim, "How 
beautiful, today the sky is such a clear blue." Or else they say, "It is 
such a gray day; you can hardly seen any blue in the sky."

THAT is superimposition, in a nutshell. People do it all the time when they 
use words. This is adhyAropa. However, it is not as if some specific person 
takes some specific thing called "blueness" and physically superimposes it 
on a specific thing called the sky. Through education, one knows that 
blueness is not a property of the sky itself. This is apavAda.
