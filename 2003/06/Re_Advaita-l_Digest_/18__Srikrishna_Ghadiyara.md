If you remove the restriction of 'samanvaya', then you
could belong to any school. All schools aspire to
address the issue of 'understanding' the jiva's
relationship to parabrahman only. It is the
conclusions which they came to, and the process and
support they developed to arrive at such conclusions,
that is part of the debate.

Anyway, I understand you are inclined to 'Madhva'
school of thought. This should certainly help the
people participating in the discussion.

Om Namo Narayanaya !!
