Very interesting quote Vidya - it has bearing on the substantive and
attributes that I am discussing in another thread.  Attributes belong to
naama and ruupa - which is so called 'object' Ultimately the substantive
of all objects is only Brahman which is akhandam. - Beautiful and
thanks. 

Hari OM!
