Namaste,

How do we validate the so called modern mystics and their "Direct
experience" to be real ? Anybody can claim any ** direct experience **. Why
do you believe what they all experiencing is **DIRECT REALITY**  ? it can be
hallucination also ? So, what is the measure ? 

In case all those claims are just 'Mystism' and definitely not Vedanta !

Regards,
Srinivas
