The upanishads very convincingly tell us, brahma veda brahmaiva bhavati, 
paramaM sAmyam upaiti, neha nAnAsti kiMcana etc. All these are descriptions 
of moksha. That you wish to interpret these sentences differently does not 
take away from the message the texts give us.

The knowledge of a normal jIva in the state of saMsAra is incomplete. Not so 
with moksha. What SAstra does is to make the incomplete knowledge complete. 
It is really superfluous for SAstra to reinfoce to us that the jIva's 
knowledge in saMsAra is incomplete. We already know this as a matter of 
daily experience.

This only warns us not to assume that we know brahman well. It is meant as a 
caution towards those who think that they know brahman when they don't. It 
doesn't exclude the possibility that brahman may indeed be known, through 
SAstra and through a guru.

pRthak-tva is cited here because the faults of the jIva in saMsAra do not 
affect ISvara. Limitedness is itself a fault. In the state of moksha, there 
are no more faults, so the question of the faults affecting ISvara does not 
arise. It does not mean that even in the state of moksha, the jIva suffers 
from the fault of being limited.
