It is the word illusion which is tripping you up.  There are nuances to
the english word which are not there when we use the Sanskrit mithya.

In  fact we play the two (or more) level game of truth all the time.  Take
the sun.  "Everybody knows" that the sun rises in the East in the
morning and sets in the West in the evening.  This "fact"  is as obvious
as your own two eyes.  Yet through education we somehow accept the
seemingly preposterous notion that the earth in fact goes around the sun!

What has changed?  The sun is the same.  The earth is the same.  The
observer is the same.  The observers' _perspective_ has changed.  Sunrise
and Sunset are false in this sense.  They are not illusionary but
misunderstood.  An educated person can still say something like "I shall
perform the sandhyavandana at sunrise" using the word sunrise only as a
matter of convention (vyavahara.) Similiarly the message of the upanishad
is that birth and death are misunderstood as the beginning and end of the
atma when in fact they are just the beginning and end of the body.  When
all these examples of avidya have been conquered, what remains is Brahman
the highest truth (paramartha)

There are no two truths just two perspectives on one truth.   Both you
_and_ us will play this game till the pralaya. :-)  I don't know whether a
jnani would choose to drink the poison or not but whatever choice he made,
he would make it with perfect equanimity knowing that he is Brahman.  That
is the essence of Jivanamukti.

Look at Gajendra.  He was dying trapped by the crocodile until he realized
that in fact he was and always had been eternally free.
