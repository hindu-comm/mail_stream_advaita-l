Which part of shruti says this?
Which Shruti says "avidyA such as pramANAdi vyavahAra" ?
It is not in the geetha and definitely not in the sootras.

>  If you ask shruti pramANa for each & every line of mails  then it is
very difficult prabhuji.  Advaitins follow shankara's teachings with utmost
sharadda prabhuji.  Shankara in his introduction to sUtra bhAShya clearly
states that *sarvE pramANapramEyavyavahArA loukikA vaidikAscha pravrutaH
sarvANi cha ShAstrANi vidhipratiShEdamOkShaparANi*  Here meaning is quite
evident that  "all conventions of the means (pramANa) and objects (praMEya)
of right knowledge-whether loukika or vaidika - & all the ShAstrAs dealing
with injuction (vidhi) & pratishEda (prohibition) or final
release'deliverance (mOkSha) are in the realm of avidya.  This is further
explained that since all human activity (kriya) based upon perception &
other means of knowledge, is in the field of innate error due to want of
discrimination between the real & the unreal (nityAnitya vastu vivEka).
