It is less true than Brahman. How much less true depends on the
perspective of the observer.

The difference is that in my example, the observers prior observation is
sublated by his _own_ later observation.  It is the illumination provided
by Brahman that makes it possible for him to do so.

Perhaps, but again it must be noted that this is how we do actually
behave.  We believe a piece of green paper signed by the U.S. Secretary of
the Treasury is worth one dollar while a similiar piece of paper signed by
me is worthless.

Paramarthic truth is the only kind that really deserves to be called
truth.  But sometimes for strategic reasons or maybe even just laziness we
call other things true.  Advaita Vedanta is not just a theory but a
practical method for liberation so it has to take such things into
account.

By our interpretation yes.  It does not invalidate the idea of Shri Hari
as saviour because He resides in our own selves.  When Gajendra thought "I
am not defeated, there is hope for my freedom" he became able to receive
the divine grace.
