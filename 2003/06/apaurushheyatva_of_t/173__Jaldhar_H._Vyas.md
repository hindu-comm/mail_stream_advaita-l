The Mimamsakas believe that the portions of the Vedas that mention the
Self are arthavada (eulogies.) praising the agent of action and
establishing that the effects of karma persist after death and rebirth.
But what is action as a phenomenon?  We say (without argument from the
purvapakshins) that an action is something that causes

1. creation  like making a pot out of clay (utpatti)

2. modification like bending gold into the shape of an earring (vikrti)

3. purification like throwing rice (saMskara)

0r 4.  attainment like reaching a far village (Ashreya)

Now which of these would apply to the upanishadic statements concerning
knowledge of Brahman?

Not 1 because knowlege does not create Brahman, it is always existent,

Not 2.  Because it is not the case that the jiva is not Brahman and is
being made into Brahman by knowledge.

Not 3 because how can a ritual purify knowledge?  It is either right or
wrong but sprinklig rice on it won't help.

4 seems promising but in the final analysis no because Brahman is not
obtained rather the existent knowledge of Brahman is recollected.

So by the Mimamsakas own reckoning knowing Brahman is not an action so
they must admit, either the upanishads are not Shruti at all (which no one
in India would admit to until European times) it is a special kind of
action hitherto unknown and unaccounted for, or it is not action at all.

Furthermore, we have statements like brahma veda brahmaiva bhavati
(Mundaka 3.2.9) "The knower of Brahman becomes Brahman" in which the
mere fact of knowing Brahman not any action is the goal.

So Vedantins reject the very premise "the Vedas only speak of Dharma" The
subject of the jnanakanda is knowledge of Brahman.  In fact Advaitins go
further and turn the whole Mimamsaka ideology on its head.  Instead of
knowledge of the self only being important in so far as it encourages the
performance of action, actions are only important in so far as they remove
the obstacles to knowledge of the self.  Apaurusheyatva is important for
that knowledge too because Brahman is also something that is known
only through shabda pramana.
