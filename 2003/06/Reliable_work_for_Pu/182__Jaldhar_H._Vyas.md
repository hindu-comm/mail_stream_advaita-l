And two more:

Ramakrishna Mission have a translation of Mimamsaparibhasha by Tryambaka
Yajvana.  As the name suggests it is a simple overview of the terminology
of the school.  (As an aside, Mimamsa has its own technical vocabulary
like any other branch of shastra.  It is not deliberately obtuse but you
need to know the jargon to be able to make any sense of it.)

Arthasamgrah with Kaumudi was translated into Englishe by George Thibaut
in 1882.  It was reprinted by Chowkhambha in 1974.
