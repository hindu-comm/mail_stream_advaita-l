Namaste members,

Recently a friend of mine showed me a copy of the Siva Gita published by the
Centenarian Trust. This seems to be a very rare text and I am unable to get
hold of a copy for myself inspite of searching for it in the WWW. I would
like to know if anyone in this list knows any member from this Trust which
is located in Chennai. Thank you. 

best regards,
K Kathirasan
