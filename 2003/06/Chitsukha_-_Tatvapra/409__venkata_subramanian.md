Dear All,

this is a line about Chitsuka's tatvapradipika.  i
would request jaladar to share anything he understands
from this book.

i havent read this work completely,(in fact, i could
not understand even a wee bit of what he is saying). 
the language is so armed and the subject is on such
level of height that i doubt what it talks about.

=====
Thanks & Regards,
Venkat.

Sadgurubhyo Namah.
