Obviously vyavaharika satya is not really satya is it, since nirguna brahman
is the true reality? All philosophy is only at the vyavaharika level, so
that's why we can postulate two levels of empirical and ultimate reality.
You cannot find fault with advaita for considering the world to be
ultimately unreal, and again for attributing some level of reality to it.

Kartik has explained this better than me.
