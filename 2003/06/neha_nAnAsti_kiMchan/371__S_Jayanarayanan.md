Read my statement carefully before you warn me of
anything. I specifically said the *interpretation*
that you've given is nonsensical.

Surely, your Parabrahman is conscious? So you see
distinctions in Parabrahman such as consciousness and
achintya-adbhtuta-shakti.

dvaita teaches that Brahman is *part* of a Reality
that consists of Brahman, jIva, world, etc. Therefore,
according to your school, Brahman is NOT Reality, but
only a *subset* of Reality. 

Hence, in dvaita, there are distinctions in Reality.

Simply that there are no distinctions in Reality.

Not so. The terms "vyAvahArika" and "prAtibhAsika"
explain the descriptive for "satya". They are only
conventionally or provisionally real which means they
are NOT Real. It is like a guest referring to the
guest room as "my room" when it is actually "the
host's room", yet the guest's reference is deemed
"socially true". 

Another (better) example: Newton's laws are false. Yet
they are taught as "true" in every high school.
