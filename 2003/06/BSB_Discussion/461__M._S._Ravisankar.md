It would be nice if we could summarize all the adhikaranas of the
Brahmasutras perhaps using works like Vayasikanyayamala of Madhava or
siddhantaleshasamgraha of Appaya Dikshita (both Grhasthas it should be
noted.)

--------------------------------

brahma suutra-s by Swami Sivananda, provides a good synopsis before each
paada of each chapter. Entire book is online at
