I cannot claim to have read the mImAMsA sUtra bhAshya, but certainly, 
learning about some key aspects of that school has helped me to better 
understand the prasthAna trayI bhAshya-s. For example, when SankarAcArya 
says that "AtmetyevopAsIta" is not an apUrva vidhi (initial injunction) but 
may be accepted to be a niyama vidhi (restrictive injunction) - in both 
brahmasUtra and bRhadAraNyaka bhAshyas. There are very technical issues 
involved in the discussion, and the advaita vedAnta position cannot be 
adequately understood without first understanding what the pUrva mImAMsA 
objection is all about in the first place.
