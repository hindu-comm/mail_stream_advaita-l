Jaldhar has already discussed some points. I'll add a few.

The advaitin adds, "... and the primary source of teaching about moksha."

>Why should one enquire into dharma?

The advaitin would say, "yes, so long as one thinks of oneself as the doer 
and enjoyer."

The advaitin would agree.

dharma, artha, kAma and moksha are accepted as four goals of human life by 
all parties concerned. If a fundamental question is asked, "Why must I be 
concerned about liberation?", the answer readily follows, "one who suffers 
in this world and doesn't get concerned about how to put an end to it is a 
fool, who will only continue to suffer." Enough independent motivation for 
study of moksha-SAstra. Additionally, in the context of today's world, one 
might add that there are a million and one people claiming to teach you how 
to be liberated, almost every one of whom fails on one count or the other. 
Hence, turn to apaurusheya Sruti.

That knowledge is gathered from a study of the SAstra, not before.

Rather, that is why one should study. Note that Kumarila does not say that 
Sruti establishes the Self as the doer and enjoyer. Doing actions and 
experiencing their results, good and bad, are instinctual behaviors for 
embodied human beings. We should study the Sruti, so that we may know how we 
may overcome this by knowing the true nature of the Self as non-doer.

To this, the advaitin would say, that is only one aspect of dharma, i.e. 
pravRtti dharma. There is also the nivRtti dharma taught in the Veda. This 
point is made by referring to the Sruti itself, which says, "tyajet" 
"pravrajet" etc. Such actions as gurusevA are not incompatible with nivRtti 
dharma.
