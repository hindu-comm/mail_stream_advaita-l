Is there an inconsistency here between RV and the Kena U? While the KU clearly identifies the taTastha-lakshaNa (accidental nature, acording to advaita) of brahman as the director of everything (and by implication also the creator), the RV leaves an agnostic note while talking of creation. Is it possible to explain this real or apparent inconsistency?
