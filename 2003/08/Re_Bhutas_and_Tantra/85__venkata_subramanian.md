vinAyakamAtRgaNa is one compound, and refers to the groups of vinAyaka-s and 
mAtR-s. The former refers to yakShas and the latter usually to the 
sapta-mAtRkAs, who are usually worshipped together in Tantric rites. Sankara 
actually uses the term saptamAtRkA in chapter 17. The term caturbhaginI is a 
bit more obscure. I have found references to "four sisters" only in Tantric 
Buddhist (vajrayAna) accounts.
