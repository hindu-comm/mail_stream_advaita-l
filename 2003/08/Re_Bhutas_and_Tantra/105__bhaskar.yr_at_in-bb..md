praNAm Sri Jaldhar Prabhuji
Hare Krishna

>  Thanks for the clarification prabhuji.  I am sorry for wrongly
mentioning the name.  ( But, still  I vaguely remember that you did mention
appaiah dikshita in that post:-))

What this shows is that Veda and Tantra are not polar opposites but in
fact intersect at some points.

>  Yes that might be the case since the field of veda is very vast. But I
do strongly feel that these occasional intersections only limited to karma
kAnda portion of vedas.  What is your opinion prabhuji??

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
humble praNAms
bhaskar
