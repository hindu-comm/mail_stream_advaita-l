Dear Mr. Bhaskar,

can you please do a help.

Can you please translate into English, Sri Holenarsipur swamiji's footnote in kannada in his Brihadaranyaka Bhashya kannada translation in one place

see - Asadeva idamagra aseeth (brih 1.1.2) where the bhahyakra says in the context that light not only dispels the darkness but also enlights the Pot, holena Swamji, points out there that this Bhasya here doesnot contradict Mandukya Bhasha in this regard.



Can you please translate this foot note into English.


Thanks & Regards,
Venkat.

Sadgurubhyo Namah.
