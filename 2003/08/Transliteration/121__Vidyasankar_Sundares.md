Dear Min,

Yes, the capitals are used for a specific purpose, as a shortcut 
transliteration scheme, to avoid complicated transliteration marks like 
macron, underdot etc. Please see www.advaita-vedanta.org/avhp/ and go to the 
link called Transliteration at the top. There is an explanation of the 
symbols there. I will add a pronunciation key to that page soon. Feel free 
to ask if anything on that page is unclear.

Best regards,
Vidyasankar
