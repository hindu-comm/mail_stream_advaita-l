Jnaana is a highly ambiguous term in the Vedaanta and can mean different 
things in different contexts. The chapter "Tat tvam asi" in the Upadesha 
Saahasri is highly instructive on the distinction between jnaana in various 
contexts.

Verse 77  knowledge is used only in a secondary sense to mean a change 
called action, the meaning of a root. A modification of the intellect called 
an action ends in a result in itself which is the reflection of knowledge, 
the Self. It is for this reason that this modification is called knowledge 
in a secondary sense just as the action of cutting a thing in to is 
secondarily called its separation in two which is the ultimate result of the 
action of cutting the thing.

Verse 79  the knower is eternal knowledge only  the knower and knowledge 
are not different as they are in the argumentative philosophy.
