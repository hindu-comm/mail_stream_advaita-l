There are several verses in the VC that speak of nirvikalpa samadhi.
This is what Bhaskar may have meant:

AruuDhashakterahamo vinAshaH .
kartunna shakya sahasApi paNDitaiH ..
ye nirvikalpAkhyasamAdhi nishchalAH .
tAnantarA.anantabhava hi vAsanAH .. 342..
"Even the learned cannot destroy the powerful ego, only those who
remain tranquil by nirvikalpa samAdhi can do so. For vAsanas
(tendencies) have existed for countless births."

AFAIK, there are two "versions" of the VC. One version is published by
the Ramakrishna Math, which has several translations by Madhavananda,
Turiyananda, etc. The second is the English translation of the VC along
with HH Chandrashekhara Bharati's commentary. I am (and I think you
are) using the former whereas Bhaskar is probably using the latter. The
verse numbers in the two versions are a bit off. 

I feel the RK Math verse numbers are incorrect, as some shlokas (such
as #19) are assumed to have 3 lines (aren't all shlokas supposed to
have 2 or 4 lines?), whereas all the shlokas in the other version have
an even number of lines.

I will respond to this part later, as I do not have the upadeshasAhasrI
with me now.
