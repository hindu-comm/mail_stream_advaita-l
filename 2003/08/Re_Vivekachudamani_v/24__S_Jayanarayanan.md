Where is Shankara here saying that GYAna is not mukti? He merely says
that more effort is necessary to *maintain* GYAna = mukti. Not that
mukti itself is to be obtained AFTER GYAna. This GYAna = mukti may
require stabilization, indeed Shankara says:

shruti mahAvAkya --> GYAna = mukti (needs stabilization)

Whereas to the author of the VC, GYAna obtained from the mahAvAkyas is
NOT mukti. In other words,

shruti mahAvAkya --> GYAna --> vAsanAxaya --> mukti

There is a clear separation between GYAna and mukti for the author of
the VC, for whom GYAna is NOT mukti. In this regard, the VC rather
feels like the jIvanmuktiviveka of Swami Vidyaranya, where it is said
that AFTER obtaining GYAna, one must strive for mukti!
