I used the word "useless" because the English translation of the
commentary of the Vivekachudamani by HH Chandrashekhara Bharati employs
the words "of no use". 

Of course the verse is not unadvaitic, and it certainly admits of an
interpretation that does not speak of the lack of importance of
scripture to an aGYAnI. But see verse 61, two verses after:

aGYAna sarpadashhTasya brahmaGYAnaushhadhaM vinA .
kimu vedaishcha shAstraishcha kimu mantraiH kimaushhadhaiH .. 61 ..
"To a person who has been bitten by the serpent of aGYAna, the only
remedy is brahmaGYAna. To such a one what can the Vedas, shAstras,
mantras and medicines avail?"

The above verse is also very advaitic, but my point is that I find
absolutely no statement in any of Shankara's BhAshhyas which comes
close to downplaying shAstra *before the dawn of GYAna*. I may
definitely be mistaken as I've not read the BhAshhyas thoroughly, but I
would like to know where in his BhAshhyas (or even the
upadeshasAhasrii) Shankara says to the effect that shAstra is not
useful to an aGYAnI. 

The VC itself speaks of the importance of shAstra at various places,
but does at times belittle the importance of shAstra to an aGYAnI,
which IMHO Shankara never does.
