They're both using the term to denote one who has obtained aparoksha
BrahmavidyA. Shankara generally makes the assumption that the world has
been sublated aparoksha brahmaGYAna has dawned, but there seem to be
rare cases when due to infirmity in the means, the world remains
unsublated (e.g. YAGYavalkya).

Shankara merely gives it a passing glance. The works of later advaitins
are needed to fill in the details.

"Doctrinal variations" needs clarification. For the record: I never
ever claimed that the VC was espousing doctrines opposed to
Shankara-BhAshhyas, and I even explained this carefully. 

However, we cannot expect later advaita texts to be carbon copies of
Shankara's works, but we can certainly expect that they complement and
not contradict Shankara.

In this respect, the term *and* doctrine of "shAstra-vAsana" is a case
in point. Both the JMV and VC caution the disciple against "addiction
to shAstra that can be an impediment to mukti", which cannot be found
in Shankara BhAshhyas except in a VERY tangential manner (such as
"there are no Vedas after GYAna" or "the Atman cannot be expressed in
words" etc.). The explicit cautionary note on shAstra in the JMV/VC is
simply absent in Shankara's works. My guess: during the time of JMV/VC,
scriptural scholarship came to be held at such a high esteem that the
practical aspect of Self-realization was neglected, so the advaitins of
that period exhorted the scholars to not rest contented on the words of
the shAstra, but to seek the Self.
