>There are several verses in the VC that speak of nirvikalpa samadhi.
>This is what Bhaskar may have meant:

Oh, that explains it. I must also correct my earlier statement about the 
occurrence of the term nirvikalpa in VC. It does occur in more than one 
verse, in some places as a reference to samAdhi and in other places as 
describing brahman.

Sometimes verses in anuShTubh meter have three lines. There are quite a few 
such instances in the mahAbhArata.

Yes, that does seem to be the case, but compare numerous verses in 
upadeSasAhasrI that talk of draShTA, dRSi and dRSya. Also, it is a given 
that jnAna obtained through Sruti culminates in anubhava, is it not? 
anubhavArUDhaM jnAnaphalam, says the bhAshyakAra. VC seems to be emphasizing 
the anubhava part of the teaching. Yes, Sankara does not talk too much of 
this aspect in the bhAshyas, but he does get into quite some detail in the 
upadeSasAhasrI.

Yes, there are some differences between upanishad commentaries and 
brahmasUtra commentary. If one were to be rigorous in discussing authorship 
issues, shouldn't one also ask whether the same author wrote all the 
commentaries? There is no prima facie reason why only prakaraNa texts should 
be subjected to this kind of analysis. No post-Sankaran author has quoted 
praSnopanishad or kaThopanishad commentary, as far as I am aware. Indeed, 
before analyzing prakaraNa texts, one should first examine all the prasthAna 
trayI commentaries (and also upadeSasAhasrI) in order to get the widest 
possible idea of the range of Sankara's thought and writing style. Instead, 
almost all arguments of authorship to date have focused on brahmasUtra 
commentary alone. That is something that needs to be corrected before making 
judgements about the prakaraNa texts.

Best regards,
Vidyasankar
