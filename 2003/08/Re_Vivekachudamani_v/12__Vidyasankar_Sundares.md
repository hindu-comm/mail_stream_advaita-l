As far as the quoted verses of VC are concerned, the question is not about 
the existence or otherwise of Sruti in the state of enlightenment. Rather, 
it is purely functional, being about the use of scripture for jnAnI vs. 
ajnAnI.

Note that the gItA verses in chapter 2 themselves do not specify karmakANDa 
vs. jnAnakANDa. Likewise, the VC verses that apparently say that the vedas 
are useless even for the ignorant one may also refer to the karmakANDa only. 
After all, these VC verses say that brahmajnAna is the only medicine for 
those suffering from ignorance and it is a fundamental given that this is 
the upanishadic jnAna as imparted by the guru.

Whether or not the author of VC is Sankara is a different question. I, for 
one, do not think that this can be decided by deducing the attitude of the 
text towards scripture.
