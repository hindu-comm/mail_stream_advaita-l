may i draw your attention to the work 

Vedanta Prakriya Prathabigna ( Eng. trans:- Method of Vedanta by AJ Altson)

wherein, the author has beautifully distinguished Dhyana Vs Upasana.

the examples he has quoted for the former ( examination of a diamond ratna by a ratna parikshaka etc) in my view is a clincher in this point.


Thanks & Regards,
Venkat.
