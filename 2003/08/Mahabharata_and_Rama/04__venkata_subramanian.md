I'm not familiar with these but

The critical edition of the Mahabharata was published by the Bhandarkar
Oriental Research Institute. The late Prof. J.A.B. Van Buitenen of the
University of Chicago began translating it into English but he only got up
to the 6th parvan before he died.

Nag publishers in Delhi have published the Mahabharata along with the Tika
of Nilakantha. They also have an edition of the Ramayana with four
commentries.

I'm not aware of any full English translations of the Valmiki Ramayana.
