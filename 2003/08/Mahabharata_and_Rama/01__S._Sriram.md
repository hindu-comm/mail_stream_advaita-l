RTH Griifth and we recently proofed it thru DP. It still contains some
errors
and could use some extra proofing. For those interested in reading it
and help proofing it to you can log-in at the study site at
http://www.ibiblio.org/sripedia

FYI: Kisari ganguly's Mahabharata is being proofed, we are now at vol 3/12.

Thanks
Srinivasan Sriram
