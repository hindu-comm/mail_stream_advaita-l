Regarding writing styles, is it not possible that the style of a single 
author can differ between a commentary on an existing text and an original 
independent work?

Shankara when he comments on the Upanishads is naturally influenced by the 
style and mood of the texts. If such a style is not different from the his 
commentary on the Brahma Sutras, it could be that Baadaraayana who 
systematized the Upanishads was himself influenced by the Upanishads in its 
style. So it is possible that there's some level of likeness in styles 
between such texts.

The Vivekachoodaamani in my opinion is more Yogic in its views and itself 
might have been influenced by other earlier works that we are not clearly 
aware of. Or it might be a totally independent work of Shankara whose 
inspiration rests on his own genius.

So even that might account for the difference in writing styles.
