Yes it is singular.  However each of the commentators mentions groups in
explaining this shloka.  Alongside the three Shankaracharya mentioned,
Shankaranandi and Gudarthadipika also mention: yakshas, rakshasas,
yakshinis, vetalas, pishachas, and kshetrapalas as examples of bhutas.
They are all groups of devayonis.

It just struck me that perhaps it is similiar to the way Rudra is
represented as one or eight or eleven or even an infinite number of
Rudras.

No it's my mistake it should be kenopanishad.

Another mistake is vinayakakalpadiprakarana is the 11th not 7th.

In researching this I found it curious that none of the commentators have
made the equation Vinayaka = Ganesh.
