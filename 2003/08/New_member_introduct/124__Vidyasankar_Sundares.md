About two years ago I started attending classes of the Practical School of 
Philosophy. You can check out the website 
http://www.philosophy.wollombi.net/.

We study, amongst other things, the Bhagavad Gita and the Upanishads. We 
also look at the concept of Advaita. I am only learning about all this, and 
when I found your homepage I thought it would be a good resource for further 
study and discussion.

Thank you
Kay Pendlebury
