namasthe,

  I've read once that when we give havis/ghee into 
the Homa kundam, they have to be given to Agni 
(put into/placed in Agni) Bhagwan only after 
telling "swAhA" after the Mantra. There will 
be dhoshams/shortcomings if we give it to Agni 
Bhagawan either before swAhA or a little late
after swAhA.

  Can someone point out the right scriptures from 
which we can get similar insights about the Homams
(both vaidhik and tantrik) ?

namasthe
Prasad
