PraNAm,

Providing a satisfying answer to a question often depends on ascertaining the hidden assumptions or objections behind the question.  Since I don't know either one in the case of your friend, I can suggest this:

Reductio ad absurdum - if the fruits of the karma were instantaneous, they would be absolutely simultaneous with the act itself.  And it would make no sense that this were the fruit of the act.  That's incoherent.  Even one millisecond of lag time beyond the act, there's already *not* instantaneity.  So what your friend is actually asking for is a *shorter* time lag between the act and its fruit.  That's like asking for more money.

Your friend's question also assumes that he is 100% successfully able to pick out the particular fruits of a particular action.  That's quite presumptuous, and sort of a slot-machine view of the workings of karma.  Is he willing to read more in the matter?

Hari OM!
