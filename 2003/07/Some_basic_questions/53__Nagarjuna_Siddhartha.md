Namaste,

Yes. But is Ishwara also a reflection of brahman?

>>3. Is jIva a reflection of Ishwara or brahman?

My understanding is that jIva is the reflection of "cit" in the intellect. But I dont know if it is a reflection of Ishwara or of brahman? 

I feel that jIva cannot be identified with BMI. But if ahankAra is taken as a possible candidate, then jIva is the false Atman.

Beg your pardon but I had a different intention in mind. I feel that the acknowledgement of Ishwara as the supreme controller might perhaps damage the non-dual sAdhana of a sAdhaka. What I am unable to comprehend is, how a sAdhaka can accept Ishwara as controlling everything as a master and still proceed with the non-dual sAdhana. The paradox here is that while the former is a master-slave relationship, the latter is one of Self-sovereignity.
