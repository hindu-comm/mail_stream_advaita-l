Hari Om !!

I am looking for Mahabharata and Ramayana with
complete Sanskrit slokas, word-meaning, translation
and commentary. Would you please suggest me the best
options available. If  one book does not serve all the
purposes, what are the options..

I came across the following books at Motilal
Banarsidas.

Mahabharata:

1.	M.N. Dutt and Sshvar Chandra  9 Volumes
2.	Kisari Mohan Ganguly  12 Volumes
3.	Ramachandra Sastri  6 Volumes 

Ramayana:

1. Ravi Prakash Arya and M.N. Dutt - 4 Vols

Please give your comments on these and any other
titles available in the market.

Om Namo Narayanaya !!

Srikrishna
