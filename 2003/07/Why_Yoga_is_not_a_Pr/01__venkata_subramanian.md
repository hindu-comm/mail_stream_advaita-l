Taking into consideration the Acharya's Position in the 4th Chapter of Brahma Sutra Bhashya and elsewhere in the Brihadaranyaka also, i am of the humble opinion that what is said in the first para regarding the applicability of Sruthi Pramana and what the next para follows....are not necessarily identical.

Sruthi alone is the pramana that is what i understand from the Acharya.

Well, you are right in the sense that the sruti is the only source of
knowledge about matters of existence after death of the body, or means
to liberation etc. Having said that, knowledge of tat tvam asi does not
by itself lead to liberation. So much so that, knowledge of tat tvam asi
before karma has "readied" the individual is useless. It can at best act
as a motivating factor, and at worst lull the individual into a false
sense of already there.
So, what I am saying is, sruti by itself does nothing to the
individual. It is by strict observance of karma, followed by, or
concurrent with, repeated meditation on sruti vakyas (the latter of
which I am calling dhyaana) which liberates the individual.
I guess we are both saying the same thing though in different
words/perspectives.
