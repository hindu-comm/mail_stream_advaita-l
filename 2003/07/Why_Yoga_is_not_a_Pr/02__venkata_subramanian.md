Exactly.     Please see Vedanta Prakriya Prathyabigna wherein the Swamiji has beautifully differenciated Nidhidhyasana against Dhyana.  the example he quotes therein.

Agreed. My point was that both karma and Upasana still operate in the sphere
of avidya and for which one has to experience its phala here or hereafter.
Therefore both are opposed to Jnana which cannot DIRECTLY liberate a jiva.
Unlike Dhyana, Nididhyasana is neither karma nor upasana. It is not
dependent upon one's will but on the vastu which is the everpresent Atma. 

best regards,
K Kathirasan
