Let me first tell that it is a fact that Shiva and Narayana have both been considered as equally reverential in the hoary tradition... i have no objection at all.

my point is why the Bhashyakara Pada is silent in his Bhashyas throughout, about anyone other than Narayana.  what is the meaning of this conspicious absense.
thats all.  nothing more than that.

regards
venkat.

The fact that Shankara equates nAyAyaNa with Brahman
does not imply that he disapproved of the worship of
Shiva as Ishvara. Can you provide a single quote from
any of Shankara's BhAshhyas to the effect Shiva cannot
be considered as saguNa Brahman, or that the worship
of Shiva as Ishvara is incorrect, or even that
Shiva-bhakti is in some sense "inferior" to
VishhNu-bhakti? If not, I fail to see your point. 

Historically, the Shankara MaThas accept that the
panchAyatana pUjA has been prescribed by Adi Shankara.
The MaThas also say that Shankara has composed several
stotras on Shiva such as the shivaananda lahari, and
has established the worship of ChandramauLIshvara
(Shiva) in Sringeri. How do you account for all of
this? 

Ramana Maharshi, esteemed as a Rishi in the advaita
tradition, has recommended the worship of Shiva.
appayya dIkshita, a famous advaitin, was a well-known
shaiva. H.H.Chandrashekhara BhArAtI has said that both
Shiva and VishhNu are the same, and that one can
worship either as the Supreme. That should be enough
proof that the worship of Shiva as Ishvara is highly
commended in the advaita tradition.
