This list doesn't care about extrapolating all
"theories" based on Shankara's BhAshhyas alone.
Everyone in this list also accepts what the Shankara
MaThas teach us. The fact that Shankara is an
incarnation of Shiva is known from the biography of
Shankara written by Swami Vidyaranya. There, Shankara
is explicitly stated to be "The incarnation of Shambhu
who bears the crescent moon on his head."
