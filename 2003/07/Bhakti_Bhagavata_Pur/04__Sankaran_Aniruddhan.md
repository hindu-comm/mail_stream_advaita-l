Possible reason #1: Bhagavatpada may not be using words like
vishnu, narayana etc in their popular connotation (which
refers only to a particular form of god). He may be using
them considering their basic meaning. For example, Vishnu
means sarva-vyApi or all-pervading. So when He says Vishnu,
He is referring to the all-pervading Atman.

Possible reason #2: It is possible that Bhagavatpada's
ishta-devata was Vishnu, so He salutes Him in his bhashyas.

Or maybe, being Parameshwara's incarnation, He didn't want
to salute Himself! :-)
