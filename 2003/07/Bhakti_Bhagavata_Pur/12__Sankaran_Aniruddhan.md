He doesn't.

We can't. It is obviously only a *belief* held by some
people. My statement was meant to be a light-hearted comment
on the issue. I am sorry if it offended anybody.

In any case, note that Bhagavatpada's immediate disciple
Totakacharya in his Totakashtakam says "bhava eva
bhavaniti..." i.e. "You are Bhava (Lord Shiva) Himself...".
This may only be a poetic comparison though.
