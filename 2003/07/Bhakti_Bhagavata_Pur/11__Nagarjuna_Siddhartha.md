I can draw only one meaningful conclusion. Among the
various forms of Ishwara, his favourite was  Vishnu.
But this does not mean that he is an ardent devotee of
Vishnu, because he is more an advocate of
attributeless brahman, rather than Ishwara. He might
have had a soft corner for Vishnu. That is just his
personal choice. Let us not try to read too much into
this simple matter.
