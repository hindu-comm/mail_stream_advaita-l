The following are Sanskrit Dictionaries online:

http://www.uni-koeln.de/phil-fak/indologie/tamil/mwd_search.html
http://aa2411s.aa.tufs.ac.jp/~tjun/sktdic/

The links above each have their own transliteration scheme. 

The latest and most widely used transliteration scheme is itrans 5.3
which is available at http://www.aczone.com/itrans/ 

Hope that helped,

Kartik
