As some of you may know, I am a beginning seeker in Advaita Vedanta,
particularly according to the teachings of Sankara. I come by way of
Vivekananda.
I have absolute zero Sanskrit knowledge, having spent most of my life as a
reporter/editor/publisher in non-fiction books in English.

In my beginning search, I was fortunate enough to purchase the following
books recently from the Vedanta bookstore in Seattle, of which the first two
are wonderful, the third okay.

Swami Prabhavananda & Christopher Isherwood, Shankara's Crest-Jewel of
Discrimination, 1947, 78, Vedanta Press, Hollywood
Govind Chandra Pande, Life and Thought of Sankaracarya, 1992, 94, 98, Motilai
Banarsidass Publishers, Delhi
Kuppuswami, Sri Sankara Bhagavatpadacarya, 1972, 91, S. Radhakrishnan, Madras

>From the Pande book and from a website I have built up the following
incomplete Sankara bibliography. I am asking that Advaitin members please
comment, make suggestions and / or critique any of the titles in this list if
you know about them or read them.

Here is the list:
