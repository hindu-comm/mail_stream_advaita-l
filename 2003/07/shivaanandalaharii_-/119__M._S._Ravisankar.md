shivaanandalaharii is one of the classical resources on bhakti.
Traditionally, based on naarada bhakti suutra, bhakti is defined as parama
prema ruupa. Our acharya's definition makes bhakti  almost like
nidhidhyAsana (see vivekachuuDamani, sva svaruupa anusandhaanam bhaktiH iti
abhidhiiyate). Even here in verse 61 (see below) one can see that
undercurrent.

There there is anonymous sanskrit commentary on shivaanandalaharii (see
reference below). I requested one of my friends to post it verse by verse,
however, she finally declined. Hence, I thought, I will start posting and
compiling it (see verse 29 below for sample). In that context, I was taking
stock of what has been posted on this subject before and here is what I
could find.
