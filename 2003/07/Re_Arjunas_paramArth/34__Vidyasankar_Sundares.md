It is not about his being kshatriya, because saMnyAsa is open to kshatriyas 
too. It is just that, in his own specific personal situation, Arjuna was 
entitled to do karma, not to renounce it yet.

The reason Krishna talks about all different paths is because he had to tell 
Arjuna what is the correct path of renunciation and knowledge, in order for 
Arjuna to understand that it was wrong of him to seek to renounce at that 
particular juncture, when the battle had to be fought.

His doubt vanished regarding the battle he was due to fight, and his duty 
was clear. He did not claim to have all root avidyA removed, nor is it said 
so anywhere in the Gita.
