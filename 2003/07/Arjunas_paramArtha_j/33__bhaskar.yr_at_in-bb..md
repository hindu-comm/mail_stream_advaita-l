According to the Mahabharata Arjuna did forget what he has been
taught by Krishna and hence asks him to repeat it. Krishna says
that when he taught Gita he did it in higher state of consciousness
(say trance) he cannot repeat it now. Then he teaches Arjuna,
Uttara Gita.

>  But arjuna forgets gItOpadEsha just few days after it prabhuji (see how
he reacted after the death of his son abhimanyu)!! was arjuna so oblivious
to paramAtmA's divine preachings prabhuji??  Moreover, what arjuna hearing
was brahma vidyA,  yOga shAstra, upanishat from vEda purusha who could have
easily found out arjuna's unmindfulness at that time.
