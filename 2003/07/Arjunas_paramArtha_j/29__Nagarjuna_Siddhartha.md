Namaste Bhaskar Prabhuji,

The answer to your question can be probably found in the Vivekachudamani of Sankara - 

1.Sons and kin can pay a father's debts, but none but a man's self can set him free. 
2. If a heavy burden presses on the head others can remove it, but none but a man's self can quench his hunger and thirst. 
3.Health is gained by the sick who follow the path of healing: health does not come through the acts of others. 
4.The knowledge of the real by the eye of clear insight is to be gained by one's own sight and not by the teacher's. 
5.The moon's form must be seen by one's own eyes; it can never be known through the eyes of another. 
6.None but a man's self is able to untie the knots of unwisdom, desire, and former acts, even in a myriad of ages.

There is no defect with Krishna. He is the best teacher that one can get. Krishna has done his job. So who is found wanting? That is obvious. The Mahabharata says that Arjuna reached heaven after death. That is quite different from true salvation.
