There is no defect with Krishna. He is thebest teacher that one can
get.Krishna has done his job.So who is found wanting? That is obvious.
The Mahabharatasays that Arjuna reached heaven after death. That is quite
different from true salvation.

>  So, prabhuji it is clear that arjuna even after getting gItOpadEsha from
bhagavan himself did not get ultimate jnAna (brahma jnAna), what he gained
is only *kshaNika jnAna* that last very short time!!!  Inspite of having
associated with vEdAnta vEdya bhagavan himself all through his life, arjuna
ultimately could able to achieve only swarga!!  looks something strange
prabhuji!!
