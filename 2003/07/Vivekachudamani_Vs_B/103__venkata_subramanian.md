Dear All,

According to Michel Comans, in his work - Extracting the Essense of Sruthi (Sruthi Sara Samudharana ) English commentary - Motilal Banarsidass Publication,

in the ascending order of importance,, the following are the reasons for holding Vivekachudamani as not the genuine work of Sri Shankara

1. The Style does vary from the style of writing of the Bhashyas

2. No extant commentary is available, as in the case of Upadesa Sahasri etc.

3. No one in any traditional commentary quotes VC / as a work of the Acharya

4. the description of the sloka in VC which extols Samadhi as superior to Sravana even, is directly contradictory to the Acharya's Whole Bhashya in Brahma Sutra IV Chapter, where he demonstrates the self suffeciency of Shravana as an independant means to liberation.  

i am sorry, i dont have the book right now with me to quote the numbers.


Thanks & Regards,
Venkat.

Sadgurubhyo Namah.
