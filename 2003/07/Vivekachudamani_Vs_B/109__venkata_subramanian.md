Dear All,

in the course of his mail, Bhaskar ji has told about Sri Swami Sachidanandendra Saraswathi Swamiji's mentioning about the similarity of the work Vivekachudamani - and the latter's commentary on Gita - called Gita Tatparya Bodhini.

This Swami Shankaranandendra Saraswathi has authoured many Vrithis - nearly on about 27 Upanishads.  some of them have been published in the Anandasrama Sanskrit Series.   The Sringeri Math  has in its possession, the complete set in manuscripts.

Does anyone know whom else have publised these Upanishad Vrithis in Sanskrit ?!


Thanks & Regards,
Venkat.

Sadgurubhyo Namah.
