Because they were not written by "Sankaracharya"s. The main
cause of confusion is the existence of texts written by
heads of the Sankara maths from later times who were also
called Sankaracharyas. However, for a serious aspirant who
believes in the fidelity of the advaita tradition, it
shouldn't matter too much whether Bhagavatpada or a later
Sankaracharya authored it.

This would not be a valid argument as per the advaita
tradition. Passage of time or change in attitude is not
applicable to a jivanmukta. I do agree that the same author
can write in different styles.

I Agree. Considering the fact that Chandrashekhara Bharati
Swamigal has written a commentary to the VC, it should be
considered an extremely important text. Has Swamigal
referred to the authorship of the VC by Bhagavatpada in the
commentary?

And BTW, does anyone know if the VC was included in the
"Complete Works of Sankara" series?
