My suggestion for you is - do your daily sadhana - listening/studying/
discussing  Vedanta and make use of any sat Sangh available in your
area. Do not follow any one or accept any one as your guru until you
discover he/she is your guru in your heart - the one from whom you have
received the greatest help in quietening your mind. Ultimately you have
to discover the guru/god in your own heart. When you are ready, a proper
guru will come to you as long as you keep your heart open to satsangh. 

My best wishes.

Hari OM!
Sadananda
