I have a question and I am trying to find the answer.
>From a year ago I began to study advaita vedanta
philosophy... without a guru. I am trying to become a
bhakti yogi but it is a hard work to do this without a
master. My question is that if I have to wait and my
guru will come to me when I am ready (as Vivekananda
says) or if I have to look for him.
Thanks a lot.
Maria
