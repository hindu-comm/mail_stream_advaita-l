prNAm Karthik prabhuji
Hare Krishna

Yes, it was not the intention of swamiji to belittle the efficacy of VC.
Infact at the very beginning in introduction swamiji clearly says VC is a
must read grantha for any sincere advaita vedanta follower.  What swamiji
trying to convey us here is *blind acceptance* of authorship of these
granthas.  It does not mean anyway, swamiji pushing aside the validity of
VC  with dubious intentions.  No need to mention, subjective attachment to
authorship of these prakaraNa granthas prevents us from doing  objective
investigation.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
