i dont understand why even a casual remark i make is taken to such a cudgel and bellicose by some people............like this...

Nothing but some private mails that i received from people like vaidya sundaram etc. prevented me from posting any mail.  they have got some mysterious license of segregating "mere intellectual/academic" issues from those of "Practical" and i was told that all my posting are in the nature of the former.

If you really mean, then why dont any moderator send me what are the objectives, what topics are allowed and what not.........in this list.

That was to prevent flooding of e-mails. You cannot blame it for lack of
messages.
If you have a problem with a list moderation policy send it to the list
moderators.
And who on earth stopped you from posting your two messages per day all
these days.

And kindly restrict your messages to the subject matter of the list. Issues
such as
this should be sent to the list moderators and they can address this on the
list.

And silence by itself is not bad at all. As a moderator, I definitely do not
mind we having just 5 or 6 posts a week. It is more important that we make
them
constructive and useful. If you really have problems with silence, why dont
you
start posting useful messages/questions on shankara bhaashhya-s or
aacharya-s
prakaraNa grantha-s or translations of his stotra-s, etc.

As a list we have a great opportunity and tasks ahead of us. It is our
responsiblity to create good online content for all to benefit from. Even
if we can not translate, even just creating audio version of shankara's
works
in MP3 file (just for example
http://www.ambaa.org/audio/lalita300/index.html). I only wish more qualified
members will come forward and read works of shankara (possibly with
translation).


Thanks.

Ravi
