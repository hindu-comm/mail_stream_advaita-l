 As administrators, we do indeed contact individual memers to keep list
running smoothly. We never contact people and ask why the list member is
not posting. Restricting list postings to 2 per DAY per INDIVIDUAL does
not mean stop posting. If you have gripes with the admin policies,
please write to us. Not to the list. Every one on this list knows that
this list is only as good as member postings and self moderation is what
is required.
Thanks for your cooperation.
Vaidya.
