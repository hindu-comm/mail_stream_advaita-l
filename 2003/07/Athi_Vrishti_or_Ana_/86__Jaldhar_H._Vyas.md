I think maybe Ravi is just not expressing himself correctly.  I believe he
only meant to say that when list members think the direction of the list
is drifting they should take the initiative to right it rather than wait
for someone else to do so.  I doubt if any bellicosity was intended.

Because we are still mulling it over ourselves.  The basic problem is
there are two types of readers.  Those who are already firmly in the
Advaita camp and just want to get on with learning the practicalities and
those who are still trying to understand.  (and a third group is those who
aren't actually Advaitins at all but they know they are not the primary
focus of the list.)  On another axis we have those who can devote a lot of
time to participation and those who can't.  Providing a proper balance
between the needs of all these groups is hard.  I won't claim we have the
correct answer yet.  As you know, I think a (n) posts a day limit is the
wrong solution to the problem but in the absence of better ideas it may
have to do.

I do agree that such matters should be discussed off the list.  If
people want to send their thoughts to listmaster at advaita-vedanta.org we
are more than happy to hear them.
