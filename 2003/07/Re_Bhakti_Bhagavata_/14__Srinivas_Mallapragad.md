>Possible reason #1: Bhagavatpada may not be using words like vishnu,
narayana etc in their popular connotation (which refers only to a particular
form of god). He may >be using them considering their basic meaning. For
example, Vishnu means sarva-vyApi or all-pervading. So when He says Vishnu,
He is referring to the all-pervading >Atman.

>Possible reason #2: It is possible that Bhagavatpada's ishta-devata was
Vishnu, so He salutes Him in his bhashyas.

>Or maybe, being Parameshwara's incarnation, He didn't want to salute
Himself! :-)

Namaste :

I don't know if this has been referred to before, but here is what the
paramacharya of Kanchi H.H Sri Chandrsekharendra Sarasvati has to say about
