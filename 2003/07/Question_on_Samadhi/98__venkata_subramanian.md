In the link article you have provided some time before, Sri Kathirasan ji, the author has gone on to say that vivekachudamani is not a work of Sri Shankara.

K Kathirasan NCS <kkathir at ncs.com.sg> wrote:Namaste Bhaskarji,

However, it is saddening to know that works attributed to Shankara like
Vivekachudamani, Tattva Bodha, etc...advocates Nirvikalpa Samadhi experience
to realize the Self. 

best regards,
K Kathirasan
