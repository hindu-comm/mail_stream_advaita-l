To illustrate the drawbacks of such methods, let me give an example. One
of my other interests is the Linux computer operating system.  Let's say
1000 years in the future three articles about Linux are all that survive
of my literary output.  Some historian of that era might conclude "This
Jaldhar was an atheist.  He only talks about computers not God."  Then
perhaps one of my advaita-l articles might turn up and the historian might
say "This is obviously a forgery because it doesn't match up with the
themes of the know genuine works of Jaldhar Vyas."

I'm not one to simply dismiss the views of historians but we need to
soberly assess what they are capable off.  In many cases they cannot
"decide" emphatically but only suggest probabilities.

If you have some time can you write about these issues and Swami
Sacchidanandendras' views?

Until the invention of a time machine, they will have the same problem as
the historians of declaring their view 100% fact.  But as I pointed out
for hundreds of years learned people from all over the country have
accepted VC as a genuine work of Shankaracharya and a valuable work of
Advaita Vedanta.  If there were huge flaws surely someone would have said
something?
