Why is it saddening?  It's very useful in that a clear mind is a better
platform to enquire about Brahman.  Think of it this way.  A scientist
relies on observation.  But no matter how much of a genius he is, if his
instruments are dirty or contaminated etc. he cannot make accurate
observations so he cannot practice science.  The Advaita criticisms of
samadhi are only against those like Samkhya/Yoga who think it is the final
step.  Just as the criticism of karma is only against those like Purva
Mimamsa who think it is the final step.  But to treat it as an
intermediate step, there is no problem.

As for Vivekachudamani not being a genuine work of Shankaracharya,
scholars are divided on it and will probably continue squabbling for
eternity.  The Advaita tradition has always considered it to be an
authentic work.
