praNAm prabhujis
Hare Krishna

Just I forgot to mention that Prof. S.K. Ramachandra Rao is also of the
same opinion that most of the prakaraNa granthAs including *saundarya
lahari*  generally ascribed to shankara are not genuine shankara's work.
More details can be found in his book *Shankara & Adhyasa Bhashya* & in
*Consciousness in Advaita* works.  Prof. SKR is desciple of His Holiness
Sri Chandrashekara Bharati Mahaswamigal & Cheif of Kalpataru Samshodhana
Kendra in DakshiNamnaya Shankara Mutt here in Bangalore.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
