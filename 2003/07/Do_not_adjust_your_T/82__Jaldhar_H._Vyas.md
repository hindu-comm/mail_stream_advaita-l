If you're wondering why there hasn't been any mail to the list don't
worry there is nothing wrong.  Various frequent posters have gone on
holiday or are otherwise busy.  Things will get back to normal soon.

But why wait?  When Brahman is within you, what is the point of sitting
around and waiting for someone else to show you?  Start your own
conversations.
