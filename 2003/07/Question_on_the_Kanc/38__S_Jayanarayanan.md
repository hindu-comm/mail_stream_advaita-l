Simply put, the Kanchi Math started off as a branch of
the Sringeri Math, but eventually severed relations
with Sringeri. You can read more at
http://www.advaita-vedanta.org/avhp/alt_hindu_msg.html

Personally, I read articles on our dharma as espoused
by the Kanchi Math, but will not visit that place, as
their claim to be a Math independent of Sringeri is
untrue.
