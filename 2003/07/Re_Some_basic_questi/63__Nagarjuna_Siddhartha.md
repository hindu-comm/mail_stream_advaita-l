I did not understand one point in sureSvra's reading. Does the anvaya-vyatireka involve negation of the trasmigrating jIva also? The doubt is arising because sureSvara seems to be saying that the "tvam" in "tat tvam asi" is not directly applicable to the transmigrating jIva, as it (tvam) is qualified by "tat". (The space (AkAsa) in the pot and the space in the sky analogy also prevents us from taking this literally)

What is the difference between pratibimba and AbhAsa? Both mean reflection, right?
