Namaste Anand and others who have kindly helped me on
these questions,

Anand's word's on I.164 are very valuable and
deserving more time than I am giving this morning.
I have a group of people coming for a day's study of
'Aham' teachings and have some more preparation to
complete.  It has been the study for this day that
initiated the questions.

I will give a fuller response tomorrow.

Once again , many thanks to you all, your words and
insights will be sown in good ground today,

Ken Knight
