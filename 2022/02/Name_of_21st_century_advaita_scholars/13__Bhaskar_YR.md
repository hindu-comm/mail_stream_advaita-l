IMHO, you donâ€™t have to go anywhere else in search of Advaita scholars,  here in this group itself you have many who are representing the traditional Advaita and teaching to the needy / deserved.  Sri Jaldhar Vyas Prabhuji, Sri Vidya Prabhuji, Sri Ananda Hudli prabhuji, Sri V Subramanian prabhuji, Sri K Sadananda prabhuji, Sri Prof. VK prabhuji, Sri Chittaranjan Prabhuji, Sri Venkataraghavan Prabhuji to name the very few among others.  

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!

Sir

Can you give me names of twenty-first century Advaita Vedanti scholars?
Those whose names I know are MM Mani Dravid Shastrigal,  MM Krishnamurti Shastrigal, MM Vishwanath Gopalkrishna Shastri.

Thanks in Advance
