Dear friends, avivAdO aviruddhaSca || Mandukya Karike 4-2
siddhAntaand pUrvapakSha, siddhanti and pUrvapakshi appear in thatnon-dual principle which is one without a second (EkamEvAdvitIyam).They both are the expressions of that Principle and hence are thatprinciple only. The Principle is one with both its expressions /manifestations. Even though it is one with them it it is untouched by them. Why ? Becauseboth are vikarAs and Sruti says "vAcAramBaNaM vikarO nAmadhEyam || "(Chandogya.} The same Sruti says " AtmatO idagaM sarvam" (Chandogya7-26-1) and "AtmaivEdadaM sarvam ||" (Chandogya 7-25-2). Sri Shankarasays "sarvaikatvAt ||" (It is one with everything).

Where is vivAda and virOdha? It is SAntam, Sivam, advaitam.

SriShankara writes thus in Upadesasahasri Chapter 218, Soka 1 :

yEnAtmanA vilIyanta udBavanti ca vRuttayaH |

nityAvagatayE tasmai namO dhIpratyayAtmane ||

Kindlyrefer to Shrauta tarka 3 of Sri Shankara which reads thus:

prapaMcasya brahmapraBavatvAt

  kAryakAraNAnanyanyAyatvEna 

brahmAvyatiriktatvAt || Brahmasutra 2-1-6.

Whathas been stated above are facts of life which can be verified in one's ownlife.

Henceit is avivAdaH and avirOdhaH.
Please study the above in thelight of the following Sruti mantras :


(1) prajnanam Brahma ||Aittareya Chapter 3

(2) satyam jnanam anantamBrahma || Taittariya 2-1

(3) Ayamatma Brahmasarvanubhuh|| Bruhadaranyaka 2-5-19

Atma is one's true nature,which is actually present here and now because I am present hereand now. This fact can never be refuted.

According to the abovemantras I am ananta i.e. infinite. 

When I am infinite whereis the place for vivAda and virOdha?

When the FirstPerson does not exist how can second and third person exist?

Finite cannot bethere by the side of Infinite.

Hence even though a finiteform appears to exist it is only an appearance which has a borrowed existenceonly and does not have an independent existence of its own.

The above statedfacts emerge out from the enquiry done based on Tri-Basic-View of LIFE.

Kindly refer to mantra 2-1-4 of Kathopanishad.


With respectful namaskars,Sreenivasa Murthy
