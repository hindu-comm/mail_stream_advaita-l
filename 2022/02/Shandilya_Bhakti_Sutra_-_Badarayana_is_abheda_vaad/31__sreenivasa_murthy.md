Bhagavan Badarayana is an Abheda-vaadi says Shandilya Bhakti sutra
===========================
Mahamahopadhyaya Gopinath Kaviraj ji makes an interesting observation in
his book ‘Bharatiya Sanskriti aur Sadhana’ while discussing Advaita
Vedanta. In his Bhakti Sutras, Shri Shandilya ji presents Kshyapa and
Bhagavan Badarayana’s views before stating his own. While doing so, he
describes Bhagavan Badarayana as an Abedha-vadi. The earliest commentary
on the Bhakti sutras by Swapneshwara also clarifes that Bhagavan Badarayana
is an Advaitian. This favours the position of Advaita Vedanta which
professes Advaita as Vyasabhimata siddhanta. The same has been established
by Shri Ayyanna Deekshitar ji in his ‘Vyasa Tatparya Nirnaya’, where
similar instances are quoted to show that all the rival darshanas of
Vedanta held Advaita only as the purport of Badarayana sutras.
The snaps of the Shandilya Sutra with Swapneshwara bhahsya (Sanskrit text
and English translation) and notes from Pt Gopinath Kaviraj are attached
below.

One can read the images in the FB post linked above.
