nArada says:

॥ बालकाण्डम् ॥

इक्ष्वाकुवंशप्रभवो रामो नाम जनैः श्रुतः ।
नियतात्मा महावीर्यो द्युतिमान्धृतिमान्वशी ॥८॥

“The People know his name as rAma, born in the race of king IkShvAku[1] 
having steady nature, possessing incomprehensible prowess, self-effulgent, 
self-commanding and subjecting his senses under his control.”(8)

[1] IkShvAku was the son of manu and the first king of the sUryavaMsha.

बुद्धिमान्नीतिमान्वाग्मी श्रीमाञ्छत्रुनिबर्हणः ।
विपुलांसो महाबाहुः कम्बुग्रीवो महाहनुः ॥९॥

“He is wise, of good conduct, eloquent, handsome, the destroyer of foes, 
broad-shouldered, strong-armed, having a conch-shaped neck and prominent 
cheeks.”(9)

महोरस्को महेष्वासो गूढजत्रुररिंदमः ।
आजानुबाहुः सुशिराः सुललाटः सुविक्रमः ॥१०॥

“Possessing a broad chest, armed with a great bow[1], with fleshy collar 
bones, knee-long arms, a noble head, a graceful forehead and great 
prowess, he is the great conqueror.”(10)

[1] Which implies he is strong enough to use a great bow.

समः समविभक्ताङ्गः स्निग्धवर्णः प्रतापवान् ।
पीनवक्षा विशालाक्षो लक्ष्मीवाञ्छुभलक्षणः ॥११॥

“Mighty and powerful, he has a well-proportioned body neither tall nor 
short, shining complexion, well-developed chest, large eyes, lustrous body 
and other auspicious qualities.[1]”(11)

[1] A perfect man is said to possess 32 bodily signs that indicate his 
status some of which have been mentioned in the last few shlokas.

धर्मज्ञः सत्यसंघश्च प्रजानां च हिते रतः ।
यशस्वी ज्ञानसंपन्नः शुचिर्वश्यः समाधिमान् ॥१२॥

“Pious, firm in his vows, he is ever intent on doing good to his subjects. 
He is illustrious, wise, and pure at heart. He is obedient to elders[1] 
and ever meditating[2].”(12)

[1] The word vashya literally means “dependent.” The commentators explain 
it “as obedient to the wishes of elders” (we shall see a great example of 
this in the next kANDa.) or “accessible to those who are dependent on him” 
in which case “dependable” might be a better translation.
[2] i.e. meditating on means of protecting those who take refuge in him.

प्रजापतिसमः श्रीमान्धाता रिपुनिषूदनः ।
रक्शिता जीवलोकस्य धर्मस्य परिरक्शिता ॥१३॥

“Equal to Brahma, He is the sustainer of this world, destroyer of 
enemies and protector of all living beings and of dharma.”(13)

रक्षिता स्वस्य धर्मस्य स्वजनस्य च रक्षिता ।
वेदवेदाङ्गतत्त्वज्ञो धनुर्वेदे च निष्ठितः ॥१४॥

“He protects his subjects and their individual dharmas. He is 
knowledgeable in the true meaning of the veda and vedA~Ngas and is 
accomplished in military science[1].”(14)

[1] dhanurveda is the upaveda dealing with archery or the military arts in 
general.

सर्वशास्त्रार्थ तत्त्वज्ञो स्मृतिमान्प्रतिभानवान् ।
सर्वलोक प्रियः साधुरदीनात्मा विचक्षणः ॥१५॥

“He knows the true meaning of all shAstras and has a retentive 
memory. He Is wise. He is beloved and well-disposed towards all people[1]. 
He has an unperturbed mind and is circumspect[2].”(15)

[1] And courteous even towards those who would do him harm.
[2] In doing the right things at the right time.

सर्वदाभिगतः सद्भिः समुद्र इव सिन्धुभिः ।
आर्यः सर्वसमश्चैव सदैव प्रियदर्शनः ॥१६॥

“Sri Rama, like the sea to rivers, is accessible to men of virtue and has 
equal disposition towards all. He always has a pleasing appearance.”(16)

स च सर्वगुणोपेतः कौसल्यानन्दवर्धनः ।
समुद्र इव गाम्भीर्ये धैर्येण हिमवानिव ॥१७॥

“Sri Rama, bestowed with all virtues, enhanced the joys of Kausalya[1], He 
is like the sea in depth and like Himavant in fortitude.[2]”(17)

[1] His mother.
[2] i.e. immovable like the Himalaya mountain.

विष्णुना सदृशो वीर्ये सोमवत्प्रियदर्शनः ।
कालाग्नि सदृशः क्रोधे क्षमया पृथ्वीसमः ॥१८॥
धनदेन समस्त्यागे सत्ये धर्म इवापरः ।

“Sri Rama is like Vishnu in prowess, the Moon in pleasing appearance, the 
world-ending fire[1] in anger, the earth in forbearance[2], Kubera in 
charity[3] and Dharma in honesty.[4]”(18)

[1] The fire that manifested from Shiva Bhagavans third eye was submerged 
in the ocean.  It emerges at the end of the yuga-chakra to destroy the 
worlds so they can be created once again.
[2] The Earth patiently bears the weight of all those who tread upon her 
without complaint.
[3] Kubera is the God of wealth but what is wealth for if not giving in 
charity?
[4] Dharmaraja i.e. Yamaraja is the God of death but also of justice.
