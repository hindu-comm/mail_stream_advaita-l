In the Vishnu Sahasra Nama Bhashyam, prior to the actual sahasra nama, in
the long commentary, for the mangala shloka 'parivranam pavitram yo..'
Shankara, to convey that the truth is One only, cites this mantra:

एको हि रुद्रो न द्वितीयाय तस्थुः (श्वे.उप.3.2)

In this mantra it is stated that Rudra is One, without any second. This is
the Vedantic Truth.
