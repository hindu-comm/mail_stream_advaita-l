I am interested in learning about traditional scriptures in an authentic
way. I have read Vivek chunamani by adi Shankaracharya ji, and I regularly
watch YouTube videos of Puri Shankaracharya ji.

I have been avid listener and reader of Jagadguru Shankaracharya Swami
Nischalanada Saraswati ji Maharaj since few years and feel like I should be
part of this community which can teach more about Advaita Vedanta and
Smarta.
