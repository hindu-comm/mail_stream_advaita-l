Sometime early last week, Gmail in India (I don't think it affected users 
in other parts of the world or Indian users of other services) suddenly 
decided that mail from Advaita-L was spam and refused to deliver it. 
This caused our server to automatically unsubscribe everyone affected.  I 
fixed things on my end and contacted Google.  We eventually got it sorted 
out and things should be back to normal.  If however you are still having 
problems receiving our messages, let me know and I'll investigate.
