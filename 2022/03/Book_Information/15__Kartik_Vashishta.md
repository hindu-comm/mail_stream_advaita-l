OM NAMAH SIVANANDAYA

Revered Self,

Sadar Pranam,

I wish you comfort and peace.

At:

The blessed Swami mentions:
"There is a very beautiful work called Guru Gita, and another called the
Ribhu Gita, which give us a detailed account of the inner way in which the
Guru works for the benefit of the disciple, and the unimaginable manners
and the methods which the Guru employs for the good of the disciple."

Could you please let me know which "Guru Gita" the most loving Swami makes
reference to.

Thank you. Pranam,

OM
