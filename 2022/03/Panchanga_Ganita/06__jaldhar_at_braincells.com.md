I've mentioned before that I trust Pt. Mahesh Shastriji 
(www.mypanchang.com) for matters related to utsavas tithis etc.  Last 
weekend he had a webinar on "Hindu Panchang Outside India" which will be 
of interest to those of us living in foreign countries.  You can view the 
recording on Youtube at https://youtu.be/SKJEG44MwfA

There are other videos on his youtube channel which may also be 
informative.
