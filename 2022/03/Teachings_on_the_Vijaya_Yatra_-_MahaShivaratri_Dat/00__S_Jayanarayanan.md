PALANI: APRIL 22-23, 2017

Puja at Dandayudhapani Swamy Temple

Arriving at the renowned Subrahmanya Swamy Kshetram of Palani in the evening of April 22, 2017, Sri Mahasannidhanam and Sri Sannidhanam were accorded a reverential welcome.
Dhuli Pada Pooja was performed by the family of Sri Hariharamuthu. This was followed by Veda Ghosha. Swagata Patrikas extolling the greatness of the Sringeri Jagadgurus
and the association between Sringeri and Palani were then read out in Sanskrit and Tamil, and offered to the Jagadgurus.


ANUGRAHA BHASHANAMS

Sri Sannidhanam in His Anugraha Bhashanam detailed on the greatness of Lord Subrahmanya mentioning His vanquishing of evil forces such as Tarakasura. Sri Sannidhanam also
elaborated on the Avatara of Lord Subrahmanya as Kumarila Bhatta. Sri Kumarila Bhatta coming just before Bhagavatpada’s advent, was a great Mimamsaka who strove to reinstate
faith in the Vedic tradition and drive home the importance of the Karma Kanda.

Sri Mahasannidhanam in His Anugraha Bhashanam said it is essential for man to direct his faculties towards God. Bhagavatpada Shankaracharya has said,

 सा रसना ते नयने तावेव करौ स एव कृतकृत्यः । या ये यौ यो भर्गं वदतीक्षेते सदार्चतः स्मरति ॥

“Only that which sings the Lord’s glories can be called a tongue, only those that relish on the Lord’s form can be called eyes, only those that worship the Lord are hands,
and only he who always remembers Him can be said to have fulfillment in life.”

Sri Mahasannidhanam said that the essence of all Itihasas and Puranas is to engage in Bhagavad Seva and Paropakara.

Clarifying the doubt regarding the date of Mahashivaratri in the Hemalamba Samvatsara that the local pandits placed at His Lotus Feet, Sri Mahasannidhanam stated that in
accordance to the Dharma Shastras, Mahashivaratri in the Hemalamba Samvatsara is to be observed on Tuesday on the first day of the Tamil month of Maasi (February 13, 2018).

Sri Mahasannidhanam ended His Anugraha Bhashanam stating that worshipping the Lord Dandayudhapani with prayers for the welfare of all is a source of great joy, and blessed
the assembled devotees.

Sri Sannidhanam performed the Sharada Chandramoulishwara Pooja at night.

At around 8:15 am on April 23 morning, Sri Mahasannidhanam and Sri Sannidhanam arrived at the temple complex of Sri Dandayudhapani Swamy temple. The Jagadgurus were received

was a great blessing to receive Sri Sannidhanam who is accompanying His Guru, Sri Mahasannidhanam as part of the Vijaya Yatra and bestowing His Grace on all with
His Dharma Upanyasas. Sri Sannidhanam in His Anugraha Bhashanam blessed the all the Archakas pointing out that they are all blessed to have done enough Punya in the past to
be able to offer Pooja to the Lord every day. He also reminded that it is the duty of everyone who has such a blessing in this human birth, to sincerely perform one’s own
