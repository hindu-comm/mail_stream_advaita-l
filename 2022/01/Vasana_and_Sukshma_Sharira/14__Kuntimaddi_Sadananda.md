Ramanji PraNAms
I have answered below the questions you have raised based on my understanding.

Are vasanas the same as ignorance? Isn’t ignorance a part of the vasanas and not just that.
-------------------

Vaasanas arise due to karma - ego-centric karma will result in vaasanas which propel into more actions - one gets into what Vidyaranya says whirlpool of action into vaasanas into actions.
Self-ignoranceis not a part of actions but the root cause for ego-centric actions. A jnaani may get involved in actions for loka kalyaanam - In his case the karma does not bind him as he does with understanding that I am not really a doer - He is doing using this BMI. karmani akarma yaHa pasyet.----------------
By equating these two and then discrediting it, aren’t we over beating it?
Just like they call us vegetarians (we are actually satvik) and then beat us for calling ourselves the same and consuming milk and milk products which they say cannot be vegetarian?
The above statements do not arise in view of the explanationgiven above.
-------------

Secondly, if ignorance is also beginingless, then sat alone exists cannot be really true since these two have co existed?
------------

1. Ignorance is beginningless but it ends with knowledge - hence it is not similar to SAT.
2. The whole discussion is in vyavahaara level - there is no ignoranceat pure SAT level of paaramaarthika level. Being infinite, it is one without a second. No words can reach there - na vaak gacchati na manaH.
3. Even the so-called realization, the jeeva-Iswara-jagat divisions, ignornace and the removing knowledge and even the Vedas are all at the vyavahaara level only.
Hope this helps.
Hari Om!

Soma -PraNAms



There isno first time - The creation is beginningless since the root cause for karmaand vaasanas is the notion that I am jeeva due to ignorance of my true nature.Ignorance cannot have a beginning - For example, when did my ignorance ofChemistry start? From the beginning, I did not know Chemistry - but it can endwhen I gained the knowledge of Chemistry from the right teacher. The sameapplies to self-ignorance - one has to get the right knowledge from the rightteacher to gain self-knowledge.



Hari Om!

 Dear fellow Advaitins,
Namaste.
The vasanas are carried by the Sukshma sharira which incarnates, and develops the notion of a jeeva. How did the vasanas come to be in the first place to cause the incarnation?
First, Am I asking the right question?
If you can direct me to texts that would explain this I would be grateful.
Thank you.
Soma
