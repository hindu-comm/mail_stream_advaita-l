Dear fellow Advaitins,
Namaste.
The vasanas are carried by the Sukshma sharira which incarnates, and develops the notion of a jeeva. How did the vasanas come to be in the first place to cause the incarnation? 
First, Am I asking the right question?
If you can direct me to texts that would explain this I would be grateful.
Thank you.
Soma
