Namaskaram,
While it's debatable if Shanakara flourished between508-477 BCE. (generally, it's held that he flourished in 7/8th Century CE), it's held that Vidyaranya flourished in the early part of 13th Century CE and Anandagiri in 14th Century CE).


With regards,Niranjan

 Namaskaram,
He could not have been in the 13th Century BCE because he had commented on Shankara’s works, and (the earliest possible) Shankara’s period has been argued to be 508-477 BCE.
He has also referred to Sri Harsha’s work, and he was known to have been in the latter half of the 12th century.

“Anandagirirefers toKhandana-khanda-khadyaofSri-Harshain hisTaittiriya-bhashya-tippana.Sri-Harshaflourished in the latter half of the twelfth century. We may takeAnandagirias having flourished in the beginning of the thirteenth century. At that time, theNyaya-Vaiseshikaschool was active in opposing thejagan-mithyatva-vadaofSriSankara. By proving on the basis of reasoning that the universe is indescribable either as real or as unreal, he rendered a solid service to the cause ofAdvaita. His position as an interpreter ofSriSankara’s philosophy is evident from the number of excellent commentaries which he wrote on the commentaries ofSriSankara.”

For the gloss on the Bhashya for the Bhagavadgita verse:

देवद्विजगुरुप्राज्ञपूजनं शौचमार्जवम् ।
ब्रह्मचर्यमहिंसा च शारीरं तप उच्यते ॥ १४ ॥

Anandagiri says, for 'deva' it is brahma vishnu shiva, etc.

तत्र शारीरं तपः निर्दिशति -


देवेति ।
देवाः - ब्रह्मविष्णुशिवादयः

It is significant that Anandagiri is admitted to be of the
13th Century BCE, pre-Vidyaranya.
