Namaskaram,

He could not have been in the 13th Century BCE because he had commented on
Shankara’s works, and (the earliest possible) Shankara’s period has been
argued to be 508-477 BCE.

He has also referred to Sri Harsha’s work, and he was known to have been in
the latter half of the 12th century.

“* Anandagiri* refers to *Khandana*-*khanda*-*khadya* of *Sri-Harsha* in
his *Taittiriya*-*bhashya*-*tippana*.  *Sri-Harsha* flourished in the
latter half of the twelfth century.  We may take *Anandagiri* as having
flourished in the beginning of the thirteenth century.  At that time, the
*Nyaya*-*Vaiseshika*school was active in opposing the *jagan*-*mithyatva*-
*vada* of *Sri* *Sankara*.  By proving on the basis of reasoning that the
universe is indescribable either as real or as unreal, he rendered a solid
service to the cause of *Advaita*.  His position as an interpreter of *Sri*
*Sankara*’s philosophy is evident from the number of excellent commentaries
which he wrote on the commentaries of *Sri* *Sankara*.”
