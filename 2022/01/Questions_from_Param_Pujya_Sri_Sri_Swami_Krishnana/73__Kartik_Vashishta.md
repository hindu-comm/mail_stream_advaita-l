OM
OM NAMAH SIVANANDAYA

Revered Self,

Sadar Pranam,

I wish you comfort and peace.

I have trouble understanding something that Sri Sri Swami Krishnananda Ji
Maharaj wrote, it is in bold italics, underlined.:

From: https://www.swami-krishnananda.org/disc/disc_345.html

The characteristic of pure subjectivity is also indivisibility. If the
knowing entity can be divided, one part of it may become the object of its
own knowing. The meaning of subjectivity is that it cannot be known as
other than itself. Hence, the knowing entity is an undivided and concrete
mass of self-identity. Indivisibility implies immortality. *It is the
composed parts of a thing that cause the mortality of that thing*;
therefore, that which is not composed of parts cannot be mortal. The term
â€˜indivisibility' implies that it has no parts. *It is not composite but
eternal.* Eternity implies timelessness, and timelessness implies
spacelessness. This would mean that the knowing entity is a spaceless and
timeless eternity; it is eternity and, therefore, infinity. Therefore, the
whole world is included in this eternal knowing subject. This total knowing
subject, which is immortal, is called God Almighty. This alone exists, and
nothing else can exist. The knowledge of this total, eternal and immutable
existence is the freedom of the soul of man.

Please explain me:
1)How being composed parts of a thing causes the mortality of that thing
2)How not being composite implies eternal
3)How does "timelessness" imply "spacelessness"


Pranam,
