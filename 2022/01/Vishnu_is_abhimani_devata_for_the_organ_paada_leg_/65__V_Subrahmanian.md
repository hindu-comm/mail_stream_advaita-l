Raghav ji,

The stated part appears on p. 255 of the printed book (pdf page number 252)
of the Mysore Oriental Library Series edited by Srinivasacharya.  The
chapter is ‡§¨‡•ã‡§ß‡§æ‡§Ø‡§®‡§ó‡•É‡§π‡•ç‡§Ø‡§∂‡•á‡§∑‡•á ‡§¶‡•ç‡§µ‡§ø‡§§‡•Ä‡§Ø‡§™‡•ç‡§∞‡§∂‡•ç‡§®‡•á ‡§Ö‡§∑‡•ç‡§ü‡§æ‡§¶‡§∂‡•ã‡§Ω‡§ß‡•ç‡§Ø‡§æ‡§Ø‡§É |  In this
chapter, the (sutra) no.1 is the one that concerns the laghu nyasa, though
it is not named so.  It might be strange to think of a sutra of such a
great lengthüòä but there are such cases in other sutra literature too. For
example in Gautama Dharma Sutras we have such large paragraphs numbered as
sutra.

warm regards
subbu
