Thank you Subbuji for sharing these details as also help from Shri Aravinda
Rao that the Bodhayana Grihya Sutra is the source of the popular rudra
laghu nyaasa.

I downloaded one large non-searchable 480 page pdf and am trying to
manually see if laghu nyaasa mantras are there. If any specific Sutra
numbers are there, kindly share them.

Om
Raghav
