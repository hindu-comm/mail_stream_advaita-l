Namaste Swagata ji,

If you are not looking for answers to specific objections from those
Vaishnavas that you have named, but general Vaishnava objections, you can
find them in most of Bellamkonda Ramarayakavi's works, as he was a
Vaishnava who turned Advaitin. If you're interested, pls look up his
Sariraka-Catussutri-vicara by him where he has answered 108 objections in
his commentary on ataH shabda of the first sUtra, many of them being
Vaishnava objections! It has an English translation by R. Balasubramanian,
published by The Adi Shankara Advaita Research Centre, Chennai.

Kind rgds,
--Praveen R. Bhat
