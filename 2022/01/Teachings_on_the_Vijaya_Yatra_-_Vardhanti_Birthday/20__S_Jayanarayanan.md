Sringeri Shankara Math, Sri Sannidhanam graced the nearby Ayyappa temple, had Darshan and blessed devotees with an Anugraha Bhashanam. On returning to the

ceremoniously led inside the temple and had Darshan of Sri Ganapati, Sri Somaskanda, Sri Vishnu, Sri Durga and Devasena Sameta Sri Subrahmanya Swamy. Sri Sannidhanam also

Sri Sannidhanam then graced the Vilacheri Agrahara in Madurai. After having Darshan at the temples of Ishwara, Mahaganapati and Sri Rama, Sri Sannidhanam blessed the

Devotees who welcomed Sri Sannidhanam happily noted that the Rajagopuram and the shrine for Anjaneya (for both of which Sri Mahasannidhanam had laid the foundation
during the 2012 Vijaya Yatra to Madurai) had been completed. Sri Sannidhanam expressed joy that He had come to the temple whose foundation stone had been laid by
His Paramaguru (Jagadguru Sri Abhinava Vidyatirtha Mahaswamiji). Sri Sannidhanam stated that devotion to Lord Ayyappa, who is of the form of Hari and Hara, bestows both
Jnana and Mukti.

On March 30, 2017, Sri Sannidhanam travelled to the Avani Moolam Street near the Meenakshi Sundareshwarar temple and graced the Arya Vaishya Samajam. The Jagadguru first had
Darshan of Goddess Kannika Parameshwari. In His Anugraha Bhashanam, Sri Sannidhanam said that He had come to the Samajam with great joy as the members of the Arya Vaishya

67th VARDHANTI CELEBRATIONS

The grand 67th Vardhanti Celebrations of Sri Mahasannidhanam began on the auspicious Yugadi day on March 29, 2017, denoting the ushering in of the new Samvatsara – Hemalamba –
as per the Chaandramaana calendar. A Sahasra Modaka Ganapati Homa was conducted on the occasion and the Poornahuti took place in the divine presence of the Ubhaya Jagadgurus.

On March 30, 2017, the Sankalpas for the Maharudra Yaga and Shatachandi Yaga were performed by Sri Mahasannidhanam. Vedabrahmasi Tangirala Venkata Shivakumara Sharrma and
Vedabrahmsri Tangirala Sitarama Sharma officiated over the Yagas.

On the 67th Vardhanti day (Chaitra Shukla Shashti) (April 2, 2017), Sri Mahasannidhanam graced devotees with Ahnika Darshan. Tens of thousands of devotees arrived for the
Ahnika Darshan that went on from 6:45 am to 9:15 am. Many devotees performed Bhiksha Vandanam. Sri Sannidhanam gave Darshan around 10 am and distributed Bhiksha Prasada to
the devotees.

At 11:30 am, Sri Mahasannidhanam performed a special Puja to the beautiful Vigraha of Goddess Sharadamba in the Math. Thereafter, the Ubhaya Jagadgurus graced the Poornahuti
of the Maharudra Yaga.

In the evening, a special Sabha was organised to honour Sri Mahasannidhanam. The Sabha began with Veda Swasti by Vedabrahmasri Kuppa Shivasubrahmanya Avadhani of Tirupati.
Smt. Srilakshmi Vishwanath sang the prayer “Sri Shankaracharyam Bhaja Re” (a composition of Sri Mahasannidhanam) followed by a rendition of the verse “Pum Bhaavam Samupeyushi …”.

Thereafter, Prasada from the Ramanathaswamy temple, Rameswaram was offered to Sri Mahasannidhanam by the Archakas of the famous temple.

Prof. Anantaraman, on behalf of the citizens of Madurai, read out and presented a Sanskrit citation welcoming and revering the Jagadgurus.

Dharmadhikari Sri Sankaranarayanan spoke on the occasion offering his reverential pranams to Sri Mahasannidhanam and Sri Sannidhanam. Ardent devotees expressed the positive
impact of the Anugraha Bhashanams of Sri Mahasannidhanam on society.

Sri Mahasannidhanam then released a book titled “Hindu-mata Marumalarcchiyil Shankara Kripa” brought out by the Sringeri Shankara Math in Mahadanapuram, and a special issue
of Telugu magazine “Vishakha Vipravani”.

This was followed by Phala Samarpanam by various institutions and organizations.

CEO of Sringeri Math, Dr. V R Gowrishankar spoke about the joyous occasion of having celebrated the 67th Vardhanti of Sri Mahasannidhanam. He stated that all the activities,
which the Acharya engages in, are for the welfare of others. He said that the Acharya always says, “Let noble activities happen. The right hand need not know what the
left hand does and vice versa.” Sri Gowrishankar also said that it is the fortune of all to have Sri Mahasannidhanam as Guru, as every devotee feels that the Acharya has
special regard for himself or for his town.

Sri Sannidhanam in His Anugraha Bhashanam remarked that the Vardhanti day is a joyous day for all Shishyas. While it is a practice to celebrate the Vardhanti in all grandeur,
Sri Sannidhanam stated that for Sri Mahasannidhanam, the Vardhanti is an occasion to engage in worship of the Lord. This is why Yagas such as the Shata Chandi and Maha Rudra
are conducted. When the Lord is propitiated along with a Sankalpa, the Sankalpa fructifies. The Sankalpa for such occasions is always to ensure the welfare of all and that
enmities between people and communities in the country subside.

Sri Sannidhanam also remembered the events that unfolded during the time of His Parameshti Guru, Jagadguru Sri Chandrashekhara Bharati Mahaswamiji. During the latter’s
Shashtyabda Poorti, disciples prayed and sought permission to conduct the event in great grandeur. The great Acharya was so full of dispassion that He replied, “The day of
birth signifies that (having obtained a physical body) the Jiva continues to be in the cycle of births and deaths. The anniversary of the day of birth is actually meant to
reflect on this fact, and to strive along the path of Moksha.” However the Mahaswamiji eventually consented stating, “If you conduct activities to propitiate the Lord for
the welfare of mankind, you may do so.”

Sri Sannidhanam also mentioned the greatness of the Darshan of Mahatmas and conveyed that the Anugraha of Mahatmas can work wonders. Sri Sannidhanam said that the testimony
to the Anugraha is that one of the listeners (referring to His own self) of the Anugraha Bhashanam of Sri Mahasannidhanam during the 2012 Vijaya Yatra to Madurai, was
Himself now giving an Anugraha Bhashanam.

Sri Mahasannidhanam in His Anugraha Bhashanam said that the responsibility of the heads of the Chaturamnaya Peethams is to ensure the sustenance and propagation of Dharma,
and not to introduce new codes of Dharmic conduct. Sri Mahasannidhanam said that every man must follow Saaamaanya Dharma that constitutes Ahimsa (non-injury by means of
thought, word and deed), Satyam (truth-speaking), Asteyam (refrain from theft), Shaucha (purity of the body and mind), and Indriya-Nigraha (control of the senses).
Sri Mahasannidhanam pointed out that all these have been stated by Bhagavan Manu in the Manu-Smriti and that the sayings contained therein are akin to being a medicine for
the disease of Samsara – यन्मनुरब्रवीत तद्भेषजम्. However, when it comes to practice, people are found to slip and continue to engage in wrong deeds. Sri Mahasannidhanam pointed out the
need to stick to Dharma. Sri Mahasannidhanam ended His Anugraha Bhashanam blessing the residents of Madurai.

At about 9:15 pm, Sri Mahasannidhanam performed a special Chandramoulishwara Puja with Panchamrita Abhisheka, accompanied by chants of the Sri Rudra, Chamaka, Purusha Sookta
and portions of the Mahanarayana Upanishad. Sri Sannidhanam witnessed the Mahamangalarati at the end of the Puja. This was followed by Ashtavadhana Seva.

On April 3, 2017, the Ubhaya Jagadgurus blessed devotees with Darshan and Ashir Mantrakshatas. At noon, the Poornahuti of the Shatachandi Yaga conducted as part of the
Vardhanti Celebrations took place in the divine presence of the Jagadgurus.

Thereafter, Sri Sannidhanam graced the the Vaidika Samajam in Madurai to bless the Vaidikas of Madurai. After having Darshan of Lord Ganapati in the premises of the
Samajam complex, Sri Sannidhanam graced a Sabha inside the huge building of the Samajam, built with the help of the Sringeri Sharada Peetham, and named
“Jagadguru Sri Bharati Tirtha Sabha Mandapam”. On behalf of all Vaidikas of Madurai, a Sanskrit Patrika was read out and offered formally welcoming Sri Sannidhanam,
and requesting Him to grace the Samajam during every Vijaya Yatra to Madurai. Sri Sannidhanam in His Anugraha Bhashanam expressed great joy at being in the Samajam,
and talked about the importance of Aachaara.

JAGADGURUS AT THE MEENAKSHI TEMPLE

In the evening of April 3, 2017, the Ubhaya Jagadgurus started from the Sringeri Shankara Math in Bypass Road and arrived at the Sri Meenakshi Sundareshwarar temple.
The Jagadgurus were received with traditional Poornakumbha honours by the administration of the temple led by Chairman Sri Karumuttu Kannan, Joint Commissioner,
Superintendent etc, and by the Shivacharyas. Sri Mahasannidhanam and Sri Sannidhanam then graced a Sabha at the Thiru Kalyana Mandapam of the temple (where the Kalyanotsava
of Goddess Meenakshi and Lord Sundareshwara is held). The Chairman of the temple, Sri Karumuttu Kannan, spoke about the greatness and uniqueness of the
Sringeri Sharada Peetham, and also pointed out the close relationship between the Sringeri Math and the Madurai Meenakshi temple. He also mentioned that the existence of
the centuries old Sringeri Shankara Math in Amman Sannidhi Street (very close to the eastern entrance of the temple) is testimony to this fact. In His Anugraha Bhashanam,
Sri Mahasannidhanam hailed Goddess Meenakshi as the bestower of the supreme good, and recounted how the Acharyas of Sringeri have propitiated the Goddess from the times of
Sri Adi Shankara Bhagavatpada. Bhagavatpada Himself has composed the Meenakshi Pancharatnam on the Goddess.

Thereafter the Ubhaya Jagadgurus went to the Sringeri Shankara Math in Amman Sannidhi Street, had Darshan of Sri Mahaganapati, Goddess Sharadamba, Kashi Vishalakshi
Sameta Vishweshwarar, Sri Krishna and Sri Hanuman.

Later that evening, Sri Sannidhanam performed the Chandramoulishwara Puja in the Thiru Kalyana Mandapam in the Meenakshi temple.

The following day, Sri Mahasannidhanam and Sri Sannidhanam started from the Amman Sannadhi Street, and arrived at the Eastern entrance of the Meenakshi Sundareshwarar temple,
where dignitaries including the Chairman, Joint Commissioner, other administrative officers as well as Archakas of the temple reverentially received Them. The Jagadgurus then
proceeded towards the Garbha Griha of Goddess Meenakshi, had Darshan and were present near the sanctum for about half an hour. An offering of an emerald-studded gold
Mangalyam and a Silver bowl for Archana was made to the Goddess. The Jagadguru then had Darshan of Lord Mukkuruni Vinayakar following which they went to the Sanctum of
Lord Sundareshwarar for Darshan. Thereafter, the Jagadgurus graced a Sabha in the Thiru Kalyana Mandapam. On behalf of the temple, one of the Shivacharyas read a
Abhinandana Patrika in Sanskrit, extolling the Sringeri Jagadgurus and seeking Their Blessings, and offered it to Sri Mahasannidhanam. Thereafter, Temple Chairman
Karumuttu Kannan, Joint Commissioner, Superintendent and other authorities were blessed by Sri Mahasannidhanam. Sri Mahasannidhanam and Sri Sannidhanam also blessed all the
Shivacharyas. Pada Puja and Bhiksha Vandanam were also offered to the Jagadgurus in the Mandapam. Tirtha Prasadam was distributed. Sri Sannidhanam blessed all with
Ashir Mantrakshatas.
