Dear friends,

The simple Truth set forth by Upanishads merely requires in the seeker achange of mental attitude and no laborious study or deep erudition. 
There is no dogma to be accepted or obtruse doctrine to beassimilated.
A pure INTROSPECTION, on the basis of the suggestions,asimple grasp of the essential principle,realized as the SELF in man emergingunsullied through all the changes in the psychosomatic mechanism and throughone’s states, is all that is necessaryto recognize the immortal element which is one’s true nature, in him.

Without tasking the memory or straining the imagination, 

 everyhuman being can rise, 

IFHE WILLS,

 to an understanding of this simple truth.


With respectful namaskars,Sreenivasa Murthy
