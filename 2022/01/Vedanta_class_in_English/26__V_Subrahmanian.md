"Namaste. My name is ........ I would like to attend Mandukya Upanishad
class"

Our founder Kalyankumar ji has finished Taittiriyopanishad classes based on
Shankara Bhashya. Now he will continue with classes on Mandukya Upanishad.

The Mandukya Upanishad is part of Atharvaveda and comprises 12 verses on
OM. The shortest of all the Upanishads is the Mandukya Upanishad.  It is
often cited as the most important of the Upanishads. Gaudapada’s Kaarika is
studied along with the original verses based on the bhashya of Shankara
(Shankara's Commentary).

This Upanishad reveals the reality of oneself by analyzing the three states
of experiences (Avasthatraya-Prakriya). In the tradition it is said that
the study of this Upanishad alone is enough for attaining Moksha.
