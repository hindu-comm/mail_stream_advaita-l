As per the bhashya to the last verse of the 13th chapter of the Bh.Gita,
the discriminating knowledge/realization that one is not the body mind
complex but the knower-Consciousness AND the knowledge that Prakriti/Maya
that causes the world is in truth non-existent, results in liberation.  '

In other words, the discourse of the 13th chapter which teaches about the
world, Brahman/Atman results in Atman knowledge and the unreality of the
Prakriti. The Kshetram = Maya and its products, is observed, vedyam and the
kshetrajna Consciousness is the observer. That the Prakriti/Maya is
observed is sufficient reason for its mithyatva.
