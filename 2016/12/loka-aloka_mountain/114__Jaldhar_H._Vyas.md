Ingenious but there is a simpler explanation for why Krishna Bhagavan says 
mAsAnAM mArgashIrSho.aham.

The Margashirsha purnima is when the agrahAyaNeShTi is performed by 
shrautis.  It is the first observance of the Vedic year so Margashirsha 
can be considered the first month according to that cycle.

(However among the seasons, vasanta which the gItA calls kusumAkara is 
considered the first.)
