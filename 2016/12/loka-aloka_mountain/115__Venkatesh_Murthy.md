Namaste

I heard in Margashirsha Masa the Full Moon will be near Mruga Sira
Nakshatra. This means Head of Mruga. What is this Mruga? It is Head of
Brahmaa. How? When he created his daughter he became very desirous of
her and approached her. But she became afraid and took the shape of a
female deer. She tried to run away from Brahmaa. But he became a male
deer and chased her and tried to mate with her. But Siva became very
angry to see this. He became a Hunter and shot an arrow to cut the
Head of the Male Deer mating with his daughter. This Head of the Male
Deer is Mruga Sira Nakshatra.

Why Margashirsha is important? Because Siva played His Leela to stop
incest the Adharma. He must be worshipped  by all worlds for this.
