To: Venkatraghavan S <agnimile at gmail.com>


Thanks, Venkat ji, for the reference. Once again it is proved that an
ancient advaitin Shankara has cited from a tamasa purana, that too from the
Ishwara Gita that teaches the Supremacy of Shiva,  just as he has done from
the Shiva Purana in the VSN bhashya. Sri Visveswara Saraswati too cites
extensively from the kurma purana in the yati dharma sangraha.

subbu
