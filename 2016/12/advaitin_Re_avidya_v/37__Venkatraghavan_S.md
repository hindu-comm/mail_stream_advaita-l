Namaste SadAji,
I'm glad you did not misunderstand my queries.
One thing for you to consider is if you say jIva has some vikshepa shakti,
what is it in the jIva that has the vikshepa shakti, is it avidyA? or is it
antah karaNam?

If it is avidyA, then you will come to our side with avidyA having both
AvaraNa and vikshepa shakti.

If it is antahkaraNam, then you will also have to say avidyA is abhAvarUpa
- Otherwise how can avidyA existing in kAraNa sharIra cause vikshepa
existing in antahkaraNam to be activated? Thus every vishaya ajnAna means
lack of knowledge of that vishayA in the mind, leading to vikshepa of that
vishaya as something else.

Extending this argument, if all ajnAna is only antah karaNa dharma, what is
the need to postulate a kAraNa sharIra, but that is not a position that you
want to take, I think.

Regards,
Venkatraghavan
