Thank you sadAji for your patience in answering my queries.

What you are saying is very interesting - It appears that in delinking
AvaraNa and vikshepa, you are proposing a new theory of epistemology also.

1) Typically, in advaita shAstra, ignorance (AvaraNa) covers objects
(viShaya), whereas you are proposing that ignorance covers knowledge and
that pramANa (which is another vritti, thought in your view?) removes the
covering of ignorance from knowledge. The interesting thought that this
opens up is that in your system, the knowledge of everything must be
pre-existent in everyone's mind already, but is covered by ignorance. So,
when you use the "I am ignorant of Chemistry" example, what you are saying
is that the entire subject of Chemistry exists already in my mind, but most
of it is covered by ignorance. As and when right pramANa of Chemistry comes
to clear up certain portions of that covered knowledge, that knowledge that
is pre-existent in the mind becomes discovered, as it were. It's only if
*all* knowledge is held to be present in the mind that the statement
"ignorance covers knowledge" can be held to be true.

2) Coming to bhAvarUpa vs abhAvarUpa of avidyA. So when I say ignorance is
bhAvarUpa, I mean the "cover" or AvaraNa is the bhAva. If what you mean is
a lack of knowledge of a thing, it denotes the absence of a vastu, and
hence abhAvarUpa. So in the above example, if you said that Chemistry
ignorance simply means the absence of Chemistry knowledge in the mind
(which is different from Chemistry knowledge being covered by ignorance,
such a Chemistry ignorance would be abhAvarUpa.

Therefore the conundrum is a) does all knowledge of every possible thing in
all three periods of time already exist in every jIva mind, covered by
ignorance or b) does all knowledge not exist in the jIva mind, but the
nature of ignorance is the absence of knowledge, abhAvarUpa?

This is what I hinted at in my previous email.

This problem is circumvented in advaita, by postulating that a) ignorance
is located in the object delimited consciousness, as opposed to the mind
and b) the nature of ignorance has both AvaraNa and vikshepa. This allows
ignorance to be bhAvarUpa (ie cover the object in question), and at the
same time not require that all object-knowledge be pre-existent in the
limited jIva mind.

In advaita shAstra that I have come across, ignorance which is inert in
nature, can only be located in consciousness. However, that ignorance is
not postulated in the perceiver's mind-delimited consciousness, but the
object-delimited consciousness.  So for example, in the rope snake example,
the consciousness delimited by the rope contains within it, rope-ignorance,
which covers the rope. The perceiver's thought which is also inert, removes
the inert rope-ignorance to reveal the rope (vritti jnAnam), and the
consciousness enclosed within the revealing thought becomes one with the
rope-enclosed consciousness (phala jnAnam) to lead to the knowledge "I see
the rope there".

If the perceiver's thought is not able to remove the inert rope-ignorance
fully, that un-removed ignorance which also has the vikshepa shakti,
creates the projection of the snake where the rope exists. The
consciousness enclosed within the perceiving thought takes the form of the
projected snake, leading to the erroneous conclusion, "I see a snake
there". So each adhyAsa is actually two fold - one of the snake, which is
the arthAdhyAsa, and the thought "I see a snake there", which is
jnAnAdhyAsa.

Regards,
Venkatraghavan
