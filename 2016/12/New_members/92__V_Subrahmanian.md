Dear Dr.Narayan,

Welcome to this forum. Since you say:

//I have my PG in vedanta from Kerala University and PhD on the study of
SATABHUSHANI of sri ANANTHAKRISHNA SASTRI.//

could you kindly share with this forum the copy of the thesis or any other
paper on the work?

Thanks and regards
subrahmanian.v
