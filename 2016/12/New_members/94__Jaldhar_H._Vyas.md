Sivakumar Rajagopalan
---------------------

Ardent believer of our vedic culture and its relevance in today's world. 
Founded an organization for contributing in whatever way I can to help sustain 
our vedic sampradaya - learn the authentic way, share what we know and provide 
a platform to practice what we have learned - through various satsangs in NJ, 
USA. I also use any available time to research and go deeper into various 
aspects of the four vedas.

Bernard Huet

My name is Bernard Huet, I am French and 68, and my interest in
advaita-vedanta is because I practice the Transcendantal Meditation taught
by Maharishi Mahesh Yogi but right now my interest is limited to
Nandikeshvara kashika for the meaning of the Sanskrit alphabets.  This is my
research.
Thanks a lot for the opportunities you provide.
