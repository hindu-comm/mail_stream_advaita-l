One who has not done sandhya for 3 days / 7 days, is not a brAhmaNa at all.  He should undergo punaH upanayana and 
wear the new yajnopavitam.  

There used to be a brahmin who was a communist and didn't believe in vedic rituals.  He was Mantreshwara Sarma.
However, with the grace of HH Chandrasekhara Bharati Swamiji, he got re-converted to brAhamaNa after underoing
due prAyaschittaM and punarupanayana.  

This is the plight of present day brahmins...A blind leading another blind ....
