Namaste,

It is known that Maharishi Durvasa was the desikAchArya who codified the 
Srichakra Navavarana Puja vidhi in Kamakshi Temple. 
He is the guru who propagated the one among the 12 vidyAs called 
"dUrvAsa vidya" and authored "Saubhagya Chintamani"
which is followed till date in Kamakshi Temple.  

Sri.SV Radhakrishna Sastrigal Trust has brought out this manual to the posterity 
which is very useful for Srividya upasakas who intent to worship devi under 
Kamakoti Parampara.

Here is the link:

PS :  The methodology adopted in this manual should be learnt under competent authority 
who is adept in srividya in general and kamakoti parampara in particular.  The positions of
vardhani kalasha sthApana, visEsha arghya, pAtrAsAdana, bindu tarpaNa etc. differ 
from sampradAya to sampradAya.  Hence, a word of caution.

regs,
sriram
