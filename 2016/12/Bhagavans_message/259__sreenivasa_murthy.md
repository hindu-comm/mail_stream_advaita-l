Dear Readers,"When shall the day come, when the blemish of the fragmentation of pure
consciousness, as knower, knowledge and the known, shall have come to a
naught, and one abides as That, the pure Being?"
That day will come when one stops indulging in useless, worthless and fruitless discussions on anAtma subjects that are going on the various Advaitin groups and devotes one's time and energy exclussively for knowing one's true svarUpa or AtmasvarUpa. This is for sure.
With respectful saShTAMganamaskAr,Sreenivasa Murthy

காண்பானும் காட்டுவதும் காட்சியுமாய் நின்றஅந்த வீண்பாவம் பொய்அதுவாய்
மேவுநாள், எந்நாளோ?

When shall the day come, when the blemish of the fragmentation of pure
consciousness, as knower, knowledge and the known, shall have come to a
naught, and one abides as That, the pure Being?
