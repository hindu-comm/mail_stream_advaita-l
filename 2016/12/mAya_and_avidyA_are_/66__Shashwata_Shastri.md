Dear Bhaskar Ji,

Since this avidyA is abhAva rUpa it can be effaced completely after the
dawn of jnana if avidyA is a vastu, a thing or bhAva then it cannot be
eradicated by any dosage of jnana /// भाबत्बं चाभाबबिलक्षणत्बमात्रं
बिबक्षितम्‌, अतआरोपिताभाबोपदानाज्ञानेऽपाभाबबिलक्षणत्बस्बीकाराब्यप्तिः।
-अद्बैतसिद्धि-मधुसूदन सरस्बती।

Best Regards,

Shashwata Chowdhury
