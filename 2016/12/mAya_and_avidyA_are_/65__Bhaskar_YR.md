After realization, jnAni would not have any 'mithyA' darshana OTOH he would have only satya darshana or samyak darshana or Atmaikatva darshana.  In that bhUma drushti sarvaM brahma mayaM.  Left, right, top, bottom everything brahman only there exists nothing apart from THAT. //

Quite true. Nothing exists apart from Brahman. As the creation- without Brahman can not exist hence it is Mithya.


Ø   Yes, there is nothing that can exist apart from brahman.  Since mAyA is brahma Shakti (brahmAbhinna) and vyAkruta nAma rUpa is vishesha darshana of that brahma Shakti it is not mithyA like sarpa on the rajju but it is the realization of ghata (mrut vishesha)  does not have any independent existence apart from  mrutsAmAnya.  A jnAni who realizes this ‘sAmAnya’ tattva behind each and every vishesha realizes that this vishesha is nothing but that sAmAnya and this ‘vishesha’ is not bhinna from that sAmAnya.  Sa cha bAhyalOkO nAstyasmAkaM AtmavyatiriktaH,  sarvaM hi asmAkaM AtmabhUtameva sarvasya cha vayaM AtmabhUtAH.  Is the clarification of bhAshyakAra.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
