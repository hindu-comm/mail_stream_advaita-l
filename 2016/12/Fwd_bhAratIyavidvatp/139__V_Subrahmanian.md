Dear esteemed members of this group,


together with some of our friends we are going to organise a seminar on
Dates of Panini soon after receiving standard papers on this issue. I call
for papers from interested members. I also invite suggestions by members on
the persons who may be interesting.


Literary History of Ancient India plays a very important role in
understanding of the Ancient Indian History. Paninian Grammer is a very
important text of ancient indian literature. Panini is the anchor-stone of
the Indian literature History.  We can decide on the datings of many later
authors like Patanjali etc. only on the basis of Panini’s dating. Many a
historical things move backward/forward if Panini’s dating is looked at
again. At present Panini is assume to have flourished during the 4th
century BCE[1]. But many prominent thinkers like Yudhisthira Mimamsaka etc.
differ from this above view. Mimamsaka has placed Panini nearly two hundred
years after the Mahabharata War.[2]  Bhashyacharya puts Patanjali in 10th
century BC based on internal evidences, Panini preceding him. VS Agarvala
puts Panini in 5th century BC on the basis of Dhanishtha (Shravishtha).
Chandramani Vidyalankar places Pantanjali near 150 BC. Bronkhorst has tried
to find Buddhist influence on Patanjali.

We can take a critical look at the points raised by Agarvala.

1.      Panini has used wors Maskari and many people think that he is
mentioned Makkhali Gosala (Maskari) who was a contemporary of Buddha. Thus
Panini succeeds Buddha. But the word Maskari does not refer to Makkhali
Gosala. It is a very common word for Sannyasin.

2.      Panini and Buddha: Panini has not quoted Buddha name exactly. But
he refered to/used names such as कुमारः श्रमण, निर्वाण, संचीवरयते etc.
which have exclusive relation with Buddhism. But Shramana does refer to
Buddhist monk. It means any Sannyasi as found in Brihadaranyaka Upanishat अत्र
श्रमणोश्रमणो भवति.  Hence this is not a clear proof.

3.      Panini mentions the stars beginning with श्रविष्ठा (श्रविष्ठाफल्गुणी
etc).  In Mahabharata time Shravana Nakshatra came in the place of
Shravishtha. That means Panini preceded MB. However it does not necessarily
mean that Panini lived at the end of that period when Shravishtha was in
Beginning. Hence Panini can be moved back a thousand years, nearer to the
time of Vedanga Jyotisha, where Shravishtha was first in the line.

4.      Panini used यवनानी in an ambiguous sense. Whether it is Yavana
script or Yavana Woman it is not known. However it is assumed to be
something from Eonian Greeks. So Panini should not be older than period of
acquaintance of Greek alphabets to Indians i.e. around the 5th BC. But this
is not sufficient to place Panini in 5th century BC. Panini mentions
Vasudeva and Arjuna (वासुदेवार्जुनाभ्यां वुन्). That means Panini succeeds
Mahabharata war. This Arjuna is the 35th descendent of Yayati. Yayati’s
another son Turvasu was the father of Yavana’s. Hence Indians are well
acquainted with Yavanas.

All these issues are to studied in detail become we can come to any
decision on the Panini
