Namaste Sri Bhaskar ji,

As I have said before, I consider mAya and avidyA to be one and therefore
jIva bhAva is also due to avidyA/mAya only, and it is located in Brahman.
Such a mAya/avidyA really speaking does not exist although its effects are
experienced. The whole point of ajAtivAda is that we accept the appearance
and experience of the world, but we deny its origination and existence. The
same holds for mAya / avidyA.

On the second point about shruti becoming aprAmANya, in apavAda you are
negating all the shruti sections about srishTi, so yes, shruti itself is
making all the negated portions aprAmANya - but it is directed towards the
student who can handle such a mind-boggling apavAda.

Gaudapada in 3.23 says:

भूततोऽभूततो वापि सृज्यमाने समा श्रुतिः ।
निश्चितं युक्तियुक्तं च यत्तद्भवति नेतरत् ॥ २३ ॥

Gaudapada says whether there is real creation or only a seeming creation,
the shruti vAkyas on creation will be the same. However to understand the
tAtparya of shruti,  the final message of the shruti, we have to take the
help of textual analysis (mImAmsa) of shruti and by the application of
logic.

In kArikas 24-26 he establishes that creation is only seeming, through
mImAmsa, by giving several examples from shruti - नेह नानास्ति किञ्चन
"there is no multiplicity", इन्द्रो मायाभि: "Brahman with his magical mAya
powers creates", अजायमानो बहुधा विजायते "Brahman becomes/originates many
things, without becoming" (Purusha Sukta), सम्भूतेरपवाद: - from the
criticism of chaturmukha brahma (sambhUti) upAsana in IshvAsya shruti we
can infer that Brahma himself is mithyA, what to talk of all things he
creates, को नु एनं जनयेत् - "who can create this world" (from
BrihAdAraNyaka shAkalya brAhmaNa), स एष नेति नेति - "he is neither the
mUrta prapancha (manifest universe), nor the amUrta prapancha (unmanifest
universe)". Citing all these examples, Gaudapada argues that creation is
only seeming. He ends kArika 25 by saying, with all these examples,
Brahman's status as a kAraNam is negated -  iti kAraNam pratiShidhyate.

In kArikas 27-29 he establishes that creation is only seeming through
logic. In kArika 27 he says:
सतो हि मायया जन्म युज्यते न तु तत्त्वतः ।
तत्त्वतो जायते यस्य जातं तस्य हि जायते ॥ २७ ॥

सतो हि from the changeless Brahman, जन्म  the origination the world,  न
युज्यते is not possible तत्त्वतः actually तु मायया but it is possible as
though, seemingly, apparently.

तत्त्वतो जायते यस्य In the second line, Gaudapada gives a suppositional
argument. Let us assume that Brahman is the actual cause of the world -
 let us say that Brahman's status as kArana is actual.
जातं तस्य हि जायते then Brahman itself will will be savikAram. Because a
kAraNa cannot create kArya without changing itself. If Brahman is changing
and all the six fold changes are possible, which will mean that Brahman
itself is subject to birth, which is an illogical proposition.

In kArika 28, he says that if Brahman is not a kAraNam for creation, can we
say that an asat vastu is kAraNam?

असतो मायया जन्म तत्त्वतो नैव युज्यते ।

वन्ध्यापुत्रो न तत्त्वेन मायया वापि जायते ॥ २८ ॥

If Brahman cannot be the cause, why can't we say something else is the
cause? The Veda says before creation, Brahman alone was there. Other than
Brahman, nothing is there. So why cant we say the world come out of
nothing? Well, out of nothing, what can come? Nothing.

असतो from nothingness मायया जन्म तत्त्वतो नैव युज्यते nothing can
originate, either actually or apparently.

वन्ध्यापुत्रो the son of a barren woman न तत्त्वेन मायया वापि जायते can
never be born either seemingly or apparently out of nothingness.

In kArika 29, he concludes this discussion by saying that just like the
dream world is only an appearance, in the waking state also, the waking
world is only an appearance.

यथा स्वप्ने द्वयाभासं स्पन्दते मायया मनः ।
तथा जाग्रद्द्वयाभासं स्पन्दते मायया मनः ॥ २९ ॥

यथा स्वप्ने just like in a dream द्वयाभासं the seeming dvaita prapancha
स्पन्दते  मनः the mind perceives / reports मायया due to mAya shakti.
तथा जाग्रत् in the waking state also द्वयाभासं the dvaita prapancha
स्पन्दते मनः the mind reports / perceives मायया

Shankaracharya also in his sUtra bhAshya 3.2.22 says "लोकप्रसिद्धं तु इदं
रूपद्वयं ब्रह्मणि कल्पितं परामृशति प्रतिषेध्यत्वाय शुद्धब्रह्मस्वरूपप्रतिपादनाय
च — इति निरवद्यम्" - the well known two parts of the universe (mUrtam and
amUrtam), which are superimposed on Brahman, is being referred to by the
Upanishads for the purposes of negation, and for teaching the nature of
shuddha Brahman - thus (in denying creation) there is no defect in the
teaching of the Upanishad.
Now I know you may not agree with the above analysis, but at least to me it
is clear that apavAda of creation is very much the tAtparya of shruti.

Regards,
Venkatraghavan
