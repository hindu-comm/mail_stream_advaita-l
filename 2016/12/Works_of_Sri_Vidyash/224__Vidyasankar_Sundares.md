Dear Sir Bhattacharjya,

"Feeling" doesn't ever become a pramANa.

There was no historical personality called abhinava Sankara living in the
8th century.

vidyASankara was a historically well-attested guru in the tradition. There
are no texts attributed to him, but his eminent Sishyas, bhAratI tIrtha and
vidyAraNya, wrote many.

Best regards,
Vidyasankar

Dear friends,

There is a feeling among many that the Shankara-bhashya on the Bhagavad
gita as well as the Shankara- vakyabhashya on the  Kena Upanishad may not
be the works of Adi Shankara.

It is generally believed that after the genius of Adi Shankara there were
two great scholars, Sri Abhinava Shankara and Sri Vidyasankara, and this
should obviously mean that these two great scholars also could have left
their great works. It will be nice, if any scholar has any idea on the
works of Sri Vidyashankara, he or she  may kindly let us know about that.

Regards,
Sunil KB
