bAlAnAM sukhabodhAya bhAskareNa sumedhasA|
racito.yaM samAsena jaiminIyArthasaMgrahaH||

As per this concluding shloka, the intelligent author of the arthasMgraha,
laugAkShi bhAskara, states that this work is a summary of the topics dealt
with by Jaimini, for the easy understanding of beginners (children).

The author follows the bhATTa school, especially since this work has great
affinity to another work of the bhATTa school, namely the mImAMsA nyAya
prakAsha. Also, since the arthasaMgraha is a short introductory work, it
does not enter into polemics against pUrvapakShis.

Anand
