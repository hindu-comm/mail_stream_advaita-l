PraNams.
I find some problems in them or in the way they are defined traditionally.
Avaccheda vaada - pot space example - seems to ignore the enclosures - conscious or inert entities.
Abhaasa and pratibimba - based on reflection - traditionally seem to account the reflection by avidya - malina satva for jeeva vs suddha statva for Iswrara. Either way we are at the level of prakRiti for reflection. Chidaa bhaasa is reflection a the mind level rather than avidya level. Avidya rests with the mind since the mind that needs to be educated. 

I find some problems in the way they have been explained. Any thoughts on these?
