Namaste Sri Sadananda Ji,



I did not consider your earlier question as meant to compare the merits and
demerits of the two vAdAs namely avacheda and abhasa. I understood them as
two independent questions. Otherwise the two have to be compared
comprehensively in totality and not on just a specific issue like pot-space
and space. Considering it as an independent question pertaining to avachEda
vAda, being just an illustration and not an identity, the type of enclosure
really does not matter and does not constitute a limitation. .



Regards
