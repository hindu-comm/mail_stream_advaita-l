Namaste

Simplest answer is Time requires Change. If there is no Change it is
not possible to measure Time. You say some time has passed between two
separate events like hour hand of clock moving from 1 to 2. But if
there is no Change there cannot be time. If there no events there is
no time. In Brahman there is no Change no Events. Therefore no Time.

Scientists also say there is no Time. It is a Man Made concept.

The subject of time does not need a study of the book which you have quoted. Please permit me to draw your kind attention to mantra 7-26-1 of Chandogya Upanishad which concludes as stated below :        "Atmata EvEdagM sarvamiti||"

There after presenting Sruti statements and arguments, it is shown that a aakaaSa is indeed aVivarta of Brahman. At the end of the adhikaraNa, Bhagavatpaada says: "etenadikkaalamanaHparamaaNvaadInaaṃ kaaryatvaM vyaakhyātam" (By this it is explainedthat dik (direction), kaala (time), manas (mind), paramANu (atom) and others areeffects). Here reliance is placed upon satkaaryavaada.
> In Advaita Vedanta, usually the concept of Time is not further elaborated. If one wants a more detailed treatment, one ought to refer to VaakyapadIya of Bhartrhari - specifically the kAlasamuddeSa which occurs in the padakANDa.
> Sabdaadvaita of Bhartrhari is quite similar to Advaita; at any rate, if one has questions about how the unreal Time operates, Bhartrhari is the best guide in tradition.
