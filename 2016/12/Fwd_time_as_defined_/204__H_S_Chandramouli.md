Namaste Sri Siva Senani Ji,



Reg  << Whatever be the view, kaala is the first concept in the state of
avdiyA
and is not seen in the state of vidyA >>,



kaala and desha are the two first  manifests essential for  the
manifestation of avidya as a variety of  nAma-rUpa. Sri Bhagavatpada says
in Dakshinamurthi Stotra



मायाकल्पितदेशकालकलना वैचित्र्यचित्रीकृतम्



(mAyAkalpitadeshakAlakalanA vaichitryachitrIkRRitam).
