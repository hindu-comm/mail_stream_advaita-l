Thanks for your clarification, though there is no need for an apology.
Usually when the word just is used, especially contrasting it with
something that is based on Shruti, it means केवलतर्क। Hence my response
with that understanding as the basis.

Nonetheless, the set of questions were divorced from that and is it not you
alone, but if anyone else too who has another way to interpret Sutasamhita
verse for समन्वय is more than welcome.

My apologies too, if you think our discussion turned sour. There was no
such feeling on my part. My response was only as to the discussion takes
the healthy debate mode, nothing more was intended. There is no need to
terminate the same; I'd be happy to see your perspective on one or more of
the questions. Thanks for indulging me.
