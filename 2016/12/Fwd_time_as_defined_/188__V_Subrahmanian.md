I think that the 'paramaḥ kālaḥ' that the SS admits is the one, which I
mentioned in another post, that persists in pralaya. I had said that this
kāla does not get resolved, like māyā, and hence can be taken as
pravāha-nitya. It is only the aparaḥ kālaḥ that gets dissolved. Sri
Anandagiri in the Māndūkya bhāṣya ṭīkā cites a mantra to show that time  is
created:

He reasons for the mūlakāraṇam, that is the ajñāna, is not limited by time
since it is the very cause of time:

अव्याकृतं साभासाज्ञानमनिर्वाच्यं तन्न कालेन परिच्छिद्यते, कालं प्रत्यपि
कारणत्वात् ।  कार्यस्य कारणात्पश्चाद्भाविनो न प्रागभाविकारणपरिच्छेदकत्वं
संगच्छते । सूत्रम् (सूत्रात्मा) आदिपदेन गृह्यते, तदपि न कालेन परिच्छेत्तुं
शक्यते । ’संवत्सरोऽभवन्न ह पुरा ततः संवत्सर आस’ इति सूत्रात्
(हिरण्यगर्भात्) कालोत्पत्तिश्रुतेः ।
