Namaste Chandramouli ji, Venkatraghavanji,

I am replying to both here.

In my understanding, the word तत् as the part of the समास तत्सम्बन्धरूपः
कालः is not singular under 1.8.24. It has to mean तयोः सम्बन्धरूपः where
तयोः represents शिवमाययोः or मायात्मनोः as described under 1.8.22. That
should resolve the issue.

Vidyaranyacharya is following what is in the मूल which refers to all three;
he has no choice to deviate from the मूल। And I don't think it is really
deviating from Bhashya. However, I think there is a technical reason as to
why काल is listed separate from माया and मायाकार्य, although it is truly
मायाकार्य alone and असत्/ मिथ्या। At the "time" of महाप्रलय, माया along
with its कार्य resolves into ब्रह्म। Without going into specifics of how
long is the प्रलय, we do know that there is a duration after which there is
पुनस्सृष्टि। Even if someone were to say that the duration is not
consistent across creations, still it has to be inferred that there is a
duration. That being so, time would be ticking! The ticking काल exists when
माया is resolved along with its कार्य। Even if we say मायाकार्य is
resolved, but माया is not really resolved completely, still काल has a
special status among मायाकार्य since it ticks even when others are
resolved. This ticking may be मिथ्या, but it is necessarily inferred to be
there during प्रलय। Hence a so-called 3rd category, which is a सम्बन्ध,
though आध्यासिकसम्बन्ध, सम्बन्ध nonetheless, between शिव/ आत्मा and माया।
