Namaste Sri Venkatraghavan Ji,



Reg  << The sUta samhita makes a reference to kAla as the sambandha
(relation)
between mAya and Atma (2-2-10) : कालो मायात्मसम्बन्धात् सर्वसाधारणात्मक: >>,




Would it be appropriate to understand from this quote kAla as the product
of mAya on its association (सम्बन्धात्) with Atman, mAya being inert and
upAdAna kArana ?



Regards
