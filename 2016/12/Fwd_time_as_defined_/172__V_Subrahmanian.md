Thanks for the interesting post Siva Senani ji. Regarding the last remark
you make:

// Whatever be the view, kaala is the first concept in the state of avdiyA
and is not seen in the state of vidyA.//

we have the statement by advaitins: kāla is avidyā-chit-samyogaḥ.  The
tattva called 'kāla' arises only when there is the samyoga, connection,
between avidyā and Chit.When this happens events happen and for that kāla
is required. In any case, even the samyoga of avidyā and chit is itself is
ādhyāsika since there cannot be, in reality, any connection of Chit with
anything whatsoever.

regards
