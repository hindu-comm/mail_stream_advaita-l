Namaste

You can give some food grains like uncooked Rice, Dal, vegetables and
bananas and some money to one Brahmin or more on January 10th only.
You can also give Vastra and Upaveeta.  This type of Ama or Hiranya
Sraddha is easy to do in short time and nobody can give excuse. But
you cannot postpone or prepone Sraddha. It is against Sastra to
postpone or prepone. It must be done on that day only.  If there is
even a festival on that day that festival should be cancelled and
Sraddha only must be done.
