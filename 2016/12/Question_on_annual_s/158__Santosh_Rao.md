Namaskara,

By father passed away January 3rd, 2015 in Bangalore....I have performed
the past two annual rites, but this year I was told it will have to be done
on January 10th and I am afraid I will not be able to perform them on that
day because of issues related to my employment. Is there any way to make it
up somehow? Please advise, thank you.

Santosh Rao.
