Namaste Sri Durga Ji,



Reg  << Is it like svarga at one place and bhooloka (भूलोक) at another
place?

sUkShma sharIra (सूक्ष्म शरीर) of jeeva travels from bhooloka to svarga? >>,




Both these questions are covered in BSB 3-1-1 to 3-1-7 where extensive
references to the upanishadic statements are also included.   Briefly the
answer to both the questions is in the affirmative.



Regards
