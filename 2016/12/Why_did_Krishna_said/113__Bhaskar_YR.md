However we who are not caught in the 
heat of the moment can appreciate the long-term goal as well.

Humble sAshtAnga praNAms Sri Jaldharvyas prabhuji
Hare Krishna

Yes, that long term goal is giving up the vedOkta karma (nitya naimittika, kAmya and pratishiddha) by taking the vividishA saNyAsa.  These karma-s would invariably needs dvaita bhAvana since the goal of jnana is nirmUlaNa of this  dvaita bhAvana for the sincere / serious mumukshu 'karma saNyAsa recommended.  But for this saNyAsa the mumukshu should have the sufficient vairagya as well.  

Your humble servant
Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
