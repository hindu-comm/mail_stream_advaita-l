Dinesh Ji,

The brain child of Delhi Metro Shri.E.Sreedharan studies daily one chapter of Bhagavat Gita and 
drawn immense inspiration from it.  

Whenever he used to face administrative & technical problems, his guru - the Gita
used to give suggestions.  He especially followed the english translation of
original telugu book "Gita Makarandam" of Sri.Vidya Prakashananda Giri Swamiji, a realised monk
in the order of Malayala Swami Parampara.
