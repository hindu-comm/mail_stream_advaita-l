3rd sentence of last paragraph should read: "In any way", not "In my way".

Thanks

>> mAya, and the amsha where AvaraNa shakti is predominant is called avidyA.
>> Even though the upAdhi's of Ishvara and jIva are the same, because only

>> Ishvara does not. Here avidyA and mAya are two amshas of  the same upAdhi.
>> 4) In samkshepa shArIraka of sarvajnAtma muni: Based on the shruti
