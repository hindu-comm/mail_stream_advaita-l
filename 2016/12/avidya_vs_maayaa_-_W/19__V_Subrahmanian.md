Dear Sada ji,

Just because purvapakshas are raised, can we conclude that the Vedanta
doctrine as presented by Shankara and his followers is flawed? Also, we
cannot take it for granted that those who raise purvapakshas have
understood vedanta/Shankara correctly.  We have evidence in the shruti, for
example, the shukarahasyopanishad cited by Ventak ji, and Shankara's own
Gita bhashya and Mandukya karika bhashya quoted by me recently where for
both avidya and maya Shankara is giving the same lakshana-s.

regards
subbu
