praNAms Sri Sada prabhuji
Hare Krishna

I am happy to find that more 'yes' observations from my side to your classification between avidyA and mAya in the light of Ishwara and jeeva srushti and at the same time I have some other thoughts on avidyA's AvaraNa and vikshepa Shakti.  

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
