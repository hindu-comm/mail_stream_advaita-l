Namaste,
Sri VedAnta deSika, an eminent VishishTadvaitin, in his commentary on the
Gita mentions a list of commentators from other traditions of the Gita
(18.66) - पिशाच - रन्तिदेव - गुप्त - शङ्कर - यादवप्रकाश - भास्कर -
नारायणार्य - यज्ञस्वामि - प्रभृतिभि:.

This list is generally considered to be in chronological order (I believe F
Otto Schrader discusses this in one of his works). Secondly, VedAnta
deSika, being a visiShTAdvaitin, cannot be said to have a vested interest
in attributing the gIta bhAshya to Shankaracharya (i.e. with a view to
improve the latter's bibliography).  Thirdly, Sri DeSika is known as a
contemporary of Sri VidyAraNya, who was Sri VidyASankara's disciple. If the
gIta bhAshya was indeed composed by Sri VidyASankara, then I would imagine
that Sri DeSika would be better placed to opine on it than say, us, as he
was one generation below Sri VidyASankara.

Regards,
Venkatraghavan
