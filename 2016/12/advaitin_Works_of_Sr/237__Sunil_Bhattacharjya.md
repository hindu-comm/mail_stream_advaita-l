Dear Venkatraghavanji,

>From Adi Shankaracharya's style of writing in the Brahmasutrabhashya and his other works,  late Prof. Karmarkar showed that Bhagavadgita bhashya cannot be a work of Adi Shankaracharya. To my knowledge no scholar has refuted the observations of Prof. Karmarkar, that the Bhagavadgitabhashya cannot be a work of Adi Shankaracharya. If you are in the know of any refutation, kindly do let me know.

Moreover, in the book "Shankara and Indian philosophy, pp.41-42" by Nataliya  Isayeva, writes that the Bhavagadgitabhashya  of Shankara implies the doctrine of Sundarapandya on adhyaropa-apavada. 

Then comes the number of bhashyas by Adi Shankara. Has anybody been able to show which were the sixteen authentic bhashyas of Adi Shankara?

Regards,
skb

 Namaste Sri
 Sunil,The logic below is speculative at best, if there
 are specific philosophical or incontrovertible pieces of
 historical evidence to dispute Shankara's authorship of
 the the Gita, kindly present them.
 Going by untested propositions such
 as Vedanta deSika being a student of VidyAshankara etc., one
 cannot come to definitive conclusions. Even if it were true,
 that does not reconcile with Vedanta Desika pointedly naming
 his pUrvapakshi in several occasions as Shankara and his
 philosophy as Shankaramatam. If indeed he was referring to
 VidyAshankara here, why would he not mention him by his full
 name even once?
 Your
 second argument that had VidyAshankara not composed a
 gItabhAshya, vidyAraNya would surely have composed one, does
 not hold any merit. How does vidyAraNya not writing a
 bhAshya on the GIta, have any bearing on authorship of the
 existent bhAshya at all? VidyAranya did not write a bhAshya
 on the Brahma SUtra either, based on this can we say that
 the Brahma SUtra bhAshya was composed by
 VidyAshankara?
 Your
 third argument is that had Shankara written a bhAshya for
 the Gita, yAdavaprakAsha would have no reason to compose one
 after him. The attribution of yAdavaprakAsha as an advaitin
 is in the vishishtAdvaitin tradition, which must be tested.
 Are there extant works of yAdavaprakAsha to determine if he
 was an advaitin, or if this was simply a hagiographical
 attribution by vishiShTAdvaita scholars?

 Namaste,



 I feel that as Sri Vedantadeshika himself was a disciple of
 Sri Vidyashankara in Kanchipuram, he would have certainly
 valued Sri Vidyashankara's bhashya on the
 Bhagavadgita, even though he might have shafted later on to
 Sri Ramanujacharya's camp, Secondly had Sri
 Vidyashankara not composed an advaitic version of the
 Bhagavad Gita bhashya, we would certainly have had a bhasya
 by the eminent Sri Vidyaranya.



 Secondly the order given by Vedantadeeshika as follows need
 not necessarily have been in the quoted chronological order.
 The chronological order could have been पिशाच
 - रन्तिदेव - गुप्त -
 यादवप्रकाश - शङ्कर -
 भास्कर - नारायणार्य -
 यज्ञस्वामि -
 प्रभृतिभि:, If Adi Shankara would have
 composed the Bhagavadgita bhashya there was no need of Sri
 Yadavaprakasha to write another bhashya on the Bhagavad Gita
 bhashya.



 Would you kindly help us by quoting the exact words /
 concepts in the Ramanuja-bhashya, which can prove that
 the Shankara's bhaṣya preceded Ramanuja's
 bhāṣya and that Ramanuja-bhashya indeed refuted
 Shankara-bhashya of the Bhagavad gita specifically and that
 what Sri Ranujacharya wrote was not a general refutation of
 Adi Shankara's advaitic views.

 Sunil KB
