Namaste Venkatraghavanji.

How can you exclude Shankara-bhashyas on the Shvetashvatara upnaishad and the Yogabhashyavivarana, just because the Vaninilas press did not include these two in the list of 16 Shankara-bhashyas. I cannot imagine that Shankara did not look at the Yogasutra and the seshvara-Sankhya.as needed for higher studies on Indian philosophy.  

Secondly,  there is a doubt on the Vakyabhashya being a work of Adi Shankara. There is a paper on that, but I do not recall the detials. Moreover there was some discussion on it  in the "advaita group" as follows:
http://www.advaita-vedanta.org/archives/advaita-l/2009-June/021911.html

As regards the book entitled "Shankara And Indian Philosophy" of Natalia Isayeva, it is published by the State University of New York Press. Albany. I read from a library.

 Namaste
 Sunilji,I'm replying to both emails
 simultaneously:
 1) The vANi vilAs Press, which brought out a
 collection of AchArya's works under the aegis of HH Sri
 SacchidAnanda ShivAbhinava Nrsimha BhArati svAminah, lists
 the following as bhAshyas:1)
 Brahmasutra-bhashya2) Isa3) Kena
 pada4) Kena vAkya5) KaTha6)
 PraSna
 7) MuNDaka8) MANDUkya9) Aitareya
 10) Taittiriya11) ChhAndogya
 12) BrihadAraNyaka13) NrisimhapUrvatApani
 14) Bhagavad-GitA-bhAshya
 15) VishNusahasranAma16) SanatsujAtiya

 From the above, the number according to vAni
 vilAs ties in with the number referred to by
 chitsukhAchArya. If there is a bhAshya that is left out from
 the list above which can take the place of the gIta bhAshya,
 please let us know.2) Can't comment
 on language differences between gIta bhAshya and the rest,
 would have to see specific examples to opine. If you can
 provide instances from Prof. Karmakar's paper to the
 list, we all can take a look. I'm suspicious of
 philological research, but will keep an open
 mind.
 3) Not having readNataliya Isayeva's
 paper, I do not understand in what context the comment about
 adhyAropa apavAda was made. This is a common prakriya across
 all vedAnta shAstra in general, and not something that is
 unique to the gIta bhAshya. Also not sure about the
 sundarapANDya reference. If there is a peculiarity about the
 way it is used in the BGB which is indicative of sundarapANDya's
 work,please share that with the group. Why would
 that rule out Shankara's authorship in any
 case?
 4) Please can you point which verse number from
 the GK is supposedly from the expanded gItA, and missing
 from the gItA bhAshya?
 5) On yAdavaprakAsha, you were questioning the
 authorship of the ShAnkara Gita bhAshya based on a
 subsequent bhAshya byyAdavaprakAsha referred to
 by VedAnta deshika. If you do not believe in the first
 instance that yAdavaprakAsha wrote a bhAshya, that question
 of Shankara's authorship on that basis also falls
 away.
 Regards,Venkatraghavan

 Dear Venkatji,



 According Chitsukhacharya, there were 16 bhashyas written by
 Adi Shankara. Has anybody tried to identify these 16
 bhashyas of Adi Shankara? Can the Bhagavad Gitabhashya fit
 in the 16 Bhashyas?



 Secondly there is the language style of the
 Bhagavadgitabhashya, from which some scholars opined that
 Bhagavadgitabhashya does not appear to a composition of Adi
 Shankara.



 Thirdly, why would Adi Shankara write bhashya on the
 Bhagavadgita of 700 verses when the original Bhagavadgita of
 745 verses was available to him, as we can see the inclusion
 of thy ajati ada verse from the Bhagavadgita in the
 Mandukyakarika by Gaudapadacharya.



 Now coming to Yadavaprakasha, I still have one doubt, about
 his writing the Bhagavadgitabhshya, until some confirmation
 is seen. Just claiming that Yadavaprakasha wrote a bhashya
 on the Bhagavad gita is not worth accepting.
 Ramanujacharya is believed to have seen the Bodhayana-vritti
 on the Bhagavadgita, which is claimed to be the guide-book
 for Ramanujacharya, but that claim also appears dicey, as
 nowhere any trace of that Bodhayanavriti has been found.
 Swami Vivekananda also tried his best by searching for it
 all over India.



 Regards,

 skb

 Thanks Subbuji.

 So yAdavaprakAsha wrote a commentary to the

 Brahma SUtra also, one that was

 referred to

 by Sri RAmanuja.



 It's

 clear from this that using yAdavaprakAsha to claim that
 the

 Shankara

 who wrote the Brahma SUtra bhAshya

 is different from the Shankara who wrote

 the

 Bhagavad Gita bhAshya is not with merit - because

 yAdavaprakAsha wrote

 a commentary to the BS

 too!



 What applies for the

 Gita, applies for the BS too, so shall we say Shankara

 did not write the bhAshya to BS also?



 Regards,

 Venkatraghavan
