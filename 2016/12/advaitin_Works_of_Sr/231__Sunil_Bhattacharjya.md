Namaste,

I feel that as Sri Vedantadeshika himself was a disciple of Sri Vidyashankara in Kanchipuram, he would have certainly valued Sri Vidyashankara's   bhashya on the Bhagavadgita, even though he might have shafted later on to Sri Ramanujacharya's camp, Secondly had Sri Vidyashankara not composed an advaitic version of the Bhagavad Gita bhashya, we would certainly have had a bhasya by the eminent Sri Vidyaranya. 

Secondly the order given by Vedantadeeshika as follows need not necessarily have been in the quoted chronological order. The chronological order could have been   पिशाच - रन्तिदेव - गुप्त  - यादवप्रकाश -  शङ्कर - भास्कर -  नारायणार्य -  यज्ञस्वामि -  प्रभृतिभि:, If Adi Shankara would have composed the Bhagavadgita bhashya there was no need of Sri Yadavaprakasha to write another bhashya on the Bhagavad Gita bhashya.

Would you kindly help us by quoting  the exact words / concepts in  the Ramanuja-bhashya, which can prove that the  Shankara's bhaṣya preceded  Ramanuja's  bhāṣya and that Ramanuja-bhashya indeed refuted Shankara-bhashya of the Bhagavad gita specifically and that what Sri Ranujacharya wrote was not a general refutation of Adi Shankara's advaitic views.

Regards,
Sunil KB

 I think the clinching evidence that
 Shankara's bhaṣya preceded Ramanuja's
 was pointed out in another post by citing the
 very words/concepts that
 Ramanuja's
 bhāṣya contains in refutation of Shankara, found in the
 latter's
 bhāṣya.

 On another note, the Paiśāca bhāṣya is
 available in the 11 commentaries. Is
 the
 Ranti deva's too published? 'Gupta' listed
 above is Abhinava Gupta, I
 think. But dis he
 precede Shankara?


 An aside: It is reported that BNK Sharma has
 stated that Abhinava Gupta has
 cited from
 the Srimadbhāgavatam in his Gita commentary. Has anyone
 located
 the place where he has cited?
