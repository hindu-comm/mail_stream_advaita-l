Dear Sri Venkat ji,

Recently there was a discussion in the BVP forum where eminent Ramanuja
follower-scholars have said that the Yadavaprakaśa bhāṣya for the
Brahmasutras, though not available in its original form, is cited in
Ramanuja's bhāsya. There is a proposed project to reconstruct Y's
philosophy from the Śrībhāṣya. The discussion also gives room to think of
 'Śankara's matam' as distinct from 'Yādavaprakāśa's philosophy'.  So, what
hue of Advaita was that of the latter is not clearly known to us. But the
proposed reconstruction, if it happens, would bring these aspects to the
limelight.

warm regards
