Dear Subbuji,

I have read in some texts that Adi Shankara wrote 16 bhashyas and this is  based on Chisukhacharya's Brihatsankaravijaya. The Brihat Shankaravijaya was claimed to have been seen by some scholars  in the past. If you have any other view you may kindly share that with us.

Regards
Sunil KB
