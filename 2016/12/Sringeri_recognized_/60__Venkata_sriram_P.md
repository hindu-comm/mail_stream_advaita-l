The writer of the article in Kanchi forum seems to be confused.  He says Govinda Bhagavatpada taught various 
vedas to Sankara and also taught about Advaita. 

He also says that "they reached Sringeri which is on the banks of Tungabhadra". Infact, Sringeri is 
on the banks of Tunga and not Tunga-Bhadra.  Also, he says "sarasavani stood fixed on the sands".

To me, it seem to have referring to Kudali which is situated at the banks of the confluence of
two rivers Tunga & Bhadra.  Also, it is said that the Sarada was installed then and there itself
where Mother stood on the sand.  It is said that the same sand where Mother stood is 
still preserved and worshipped in Kudali Mutt and it is interesting to note that the muttadhipati-s of that
pITa has the yOgapaTTa starting with "वालुक​" which implies "sand" in Sanskrit.  

Some say, Mother Sarada has been installed with aSTa-dikbandhana of vanadurga mantra :))

What exactly is the history and date of Sankara only God knows.  Acharya Sankara is 
and His vaibhava is only known thru His magnificent and wonderful literature that has
been handed down to posterity.

regs,
sriram
