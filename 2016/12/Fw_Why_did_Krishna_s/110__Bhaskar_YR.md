praNAms Sri Shashwata Chowdhury prabhuji
Hare Krishna

Again I am not able to relate your geeta shloka quote with my doubt.  Yes, it is no doubt this this jnana which is enshrined by vedOpanishat will be appreciated by all Rishi-s…But how can this answer my question with regard to pUrva meemAmsa and krishNAvatAra in dvApara!!??  Kindly pardon me for again raising doubt  and bear with this dull wit.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!

Subject: Re: [Advaita-l] Fw: Why did Krishna said that he was unable to repeat Gita?

Pranam Bhaskarji,

 I am not able to understand this.  Would you please elaborate it.  KrishNAvatAra in dvApara, pUrva-uttara meemAmsa divisions etc. is in Kaliyuga..or am I missing something here?? Pls. clarify. // You may find this particular verse of Gita interesting-
ऋषिभिर्बहुधा गीतं छन्दोभिर्बिबिधैः पृथक।
ब्रह्मसूत्रपदैश्चैब हेतुमद्‌भिर्बिनिश्चितैः।। १३/५

Best Regards,

By the time BhagavAn took his Krishna avatar the pUrva mImAmsa had corrupted leaving very little scope for Vedānta to even breathe!

Hence had to denounce it badly. Also 'jnAnam' being a matter of mind and intelligence; external, physical renunciation, sannyasa was less important.

>  Shankara repeatedly insists formal saNyAsa (not mere karmaphala saNyAsa but Ashrama saNyAsa) for the jnAnArjana.  But also says jnana is not adheena to saNyAsAshrama.

Also BhagavAn had an ulterior motive - to keep Arjun in his present Ashrama to fight the war, destroy 'adharmIs' and reestablish 'DHARMA'. Hence HE promoted 'inner renunciation'!
