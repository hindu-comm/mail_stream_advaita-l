Hare Krishna

Bythe time BhagavAn took his Krishna avatarthe pUrva mImAmsa had corrupted leaving very little scope for Vedānta to even breathe! 

>  I am not able to understand this.  Would you please elaborate it.  KrishNAvatAra in dvApara, pUrva-uttara meemAmsa divisions etc. is in Kaliyuga..or am I missing something here?? Pls. clarify.


Hence had to denounce it badly. Also 'jnAnam' being a matter of mind and intelligence; external, physical renunciation, sannyasa was less important. 

>  Shankara repeatedly insists formal saNyAsa (not mere karmaphala saNyAsa but Ashrama saNyAsa) for the jnAnArjana.  But also says jnana is not adheena to saNyAsAshrama.  

Also BhagavAn had an ulterior motive - to keep Arjun in his present Ashrama to fight the war, destroy 'adharmIs' and reestablish 'DHARMA'. Hence HE promoted 'inner renunciation'!


>  Yes, I agree, ashOcyAnanvashOchatvaM,  kamaNyevAdhikAraste mA phaleshu kadAchana...are the best suited advice for the arjuna on the battle field.


Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
