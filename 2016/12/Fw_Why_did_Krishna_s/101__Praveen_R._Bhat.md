Namaste Chandramouliji,

Thanks for your mail. I was talking only of Paramahamsa sannyasi, which
obviously is not the context of Gita! Apologies for mixing up. However,
some other comments follow inline...

The four categories you mention are only based on the levels of vairAgya
which drive a person to renunciation, and therefore, what kind of rules of
stay, food, etc, they follow, but not based on whether they are
renunciation of the seeker or knower. Even among them, only बहुदक seems to
keep the यज्ञोपवित and therefore, can gain adhikAritva.

The 2nd mantra of Bhikshukopanishad says that Yajnavalkya was a kuTichaka
and we know from Brihadaranyakopanishad that he took vidvatsannyAsa!
Otherwise, I am inline with you that Bhagavan is placing karmayoga as a
better path compared to sannyAsa which is without adhikAritva.

In JMV, Swami Vidyaranya says that only Paramahamsa gets jivanmukti, while
even the Hamsa attains Brahmaloka and so, gets kramamukti. And he says
Paramahamsa has the two categories of vividiShA and vidvat.

Kind rgds,
