Namaste Sri Chandramouliji,

While Br. Up. 4.4.22 says that the adhikAri should take up vividiShA
sannyAsa, does it also mean that only adhikAris take up vividiShA sannyAsa?
Or alternatively, does it mean, that only the sannyAsa taken up by
adhikAris can be called vividiShA sannyAsa?

The bhAshya of BG 5.5 addresses your point "The reason why vividisha
sanyAsa is considered superior to karmayoga is because of the superiority
of the ultimate goal that is achievable through it."

Swami Paramarthananda interprets karmasanyAsa as vividiShA sannyAsa,
paramArthajnAna sannyAsa / jnAna apeksha sannyAsa / sAnkhya as vidvat
sannyAsa. and thus interprets BG 5.2 to say karmayoga is superior to
vividishA sannyAsa.

Regards,
Venkaraghavan
