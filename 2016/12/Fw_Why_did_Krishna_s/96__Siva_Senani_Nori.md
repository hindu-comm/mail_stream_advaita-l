In Gita, sannyasa means doing karma without phalaapekshaa. In fact Arjuna at one stage asks - "what is better: karma or karma sannyasa?" to which Bhagavan's reply is to the effect that they are not different. So the meaning of Arjuna's words करिष्ये वचनं तव may be taken to mean "I shall fight without expecting victory or defeat".

Both of you are quoting the same shloka Gita 18.73. You are right that in 
the first part of the shloka Arjuna is indeed claiming that his delusions 
have been destroyed and that he has become free of doubt but look at the 
last three words: karishye vachanam tava. "I will do as you have said." 
What does Krishna Bhagavan want Arjuna to do? Shankaracharya in the 
introduction to his bhAShya says (quoting anugItA 28.3) GYAnaM 
saMnyAsalakShaNam "The defining characteristic of jnana is sannyasa. isthe highest teaching of the gItA. But Arjuna does not take sannyasa and 
is not expected to either. Krishna Bhagavan has two objectives in talking 
to Arjuna. The long-term one is to foster renunciation which leads to the 
supreme knowledge. But the short-term goal is to get Arjuna out of his 
depression and to do his job and _fight_. It is this short-term goal 
which is met by the end of the gItA. However we who are not caught in the 
heat of the moment can appreciate the long-term goal as well.
