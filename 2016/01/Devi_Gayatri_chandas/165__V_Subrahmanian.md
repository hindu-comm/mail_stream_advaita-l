Here is a question that members may pl address.  Thanks.

A question on  छन्दस्.

As you are aware, Gayatri has 3 paadas of 8 syllables each containing 24
syllables in each stanza, and
Pankti has 4 or 5 paadas containing 40 syllables in each stanza etc.

Now my question is :

1. In the ऋषि-छन्दस्-देवता invocation for Pranava, we say - प्रणवस्य ऋषि
ब्रह्म देवी गायत्री छन्दः परमात्मा देवता.
Pranava consists of one syllable, so how does it become गायत्री छन्दः ?

2. Same with Narayana Ashtaakshari mantra, for which chhandas is said to be
देवी गायत्री छन्दः .

Similarly, in the ऋषि-छन्दस्-देवता invocation for Panchakshari mantra, we
say पङ्क्ति छन्दः , though it consists of only 5 syllables.

Please clarify how these chhandas have been given when the number of
syllables are much less than what is required ?
