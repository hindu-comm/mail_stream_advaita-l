Hari Om! Sadaji,
How to answer to you who is Gurusthaniyah?
Still as a question asked by Guru I'll show my ignorance so that you can
correct me.
गुरुरेवपरंब्रह्मः - There cannot be two, Guru and Brahman, when we are
taught सर्वं खल्विदंब्रह्मः। That is in the Paramarthika state.
Coming to Vyavahara as you said we need a Guru. The very reason we are in
Vyavahara is the reason which necessitate such a person who can show us to
go beyond the illusion of the Vyavahara. Eventhough I mentioned it as a
person above, it necessarily need not be a human form. As in the case of
Avadhuta Gitakara, anyone or anything that can remove the illusory vision
and bestows the Truth is a Guru. Rare indeed is such an aspirational seeker
to get those visions. Having said that, it makes the need of a Guru
mandatory for the seeker. Who can know where the seeker is presently
standing and also knows the path and procedure to take him to that ultimate
destination.
I belive that even the Gurukula system earlier were for the general vedic
practises. The teachings of Adhyatma Vidya was always one-to-one. The
गुह्यतमं शास्त्रम् cannot be a classroom monitored one. Here also the broad
explanatory class can be to multiple students or seekers, but when it comes
to the deliverance of that experiencing words, it will and should be
absolutely personal.
Until one knows That Truth, he also cannot know if the teacher is an
experienced one in Truth.
As Vachaspati Misra said even Goddess Sarawati will not be able to share
her personal experience, but bless that you too have one. Such being the
situation, a Guru too blesses his ward thru words of wisdom and knowledge.
But it's for the seeker to dawn That Truth in his bosom by Sravanam,
Mananam, and Nidhidhysanam.
Please remove my ignorance in the above understandings if any.
Hari Om!
Aurobind Padiyath
