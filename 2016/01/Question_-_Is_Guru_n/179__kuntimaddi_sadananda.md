PraNAms to all

Shree Subbuji just posted - How one can get under the grace of a Guru? 

Here is a question I want to pose it to all.

Q. 1: Do we really need a guru? 

Shastras says so - therefore we need one. Or Do we really need to have one understand Shastras? 

We do not have old gurukula system of education. We have now Missions and Missionaries. We have now internet and on-line discussion, talks on yu-tube or all other means to understand the shaastras. 

All we need to know is Brahma Satyam, Jangan mithyaa and jeevo brahma eva na aparaH. This can be learned by listening to many teachings available on line. 

I understand that we need to have shraddha - Does Shraddha comes with 'Guru or in the very teaching itself (shastra) 

Q2. Do we need a live guru or on-line guru? I find many claim that Bhagavan Ramana Mahasrhi is our guru; but he is not there in Physical form to teach. His teachings are available - so are other on-line teachers too. 

Claim: We need a teacher who himself is self realized? Well, since there are no litmus to evaluate a particular teacher is self-realized or not we cannot go by that rule as long as we have the faith in the shaastras and understand clearly the explanation.

I would like hear from eveyone those who are looking for a guru and those who found their gurus and those who do not think they do not need one (as JK - says - even though his follower want to follow!)

Q. We have many who do not have gurus as we know - starting with Bhagavan Ramana Maharshi himself. That he had Guru in the last life is only justification for the axiom that one needs a guru, since we do not Bhagavan's last janma to make a claim

The sadhana chatushtaya sampaathi does not necessorily for subtle inquiry does not demand a guru - it says Shraddha - Is Shraddha in the teachings available in may ways now - not sufficient.

What do you think? I am posting this to both groups to see the responses. 

Hari Om!
Sada
