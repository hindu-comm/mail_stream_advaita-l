Reg << In the bhashyam to Br.Up.4.3.22, it is said that ..

प्रकृतः स्वयञ्ज्योतिरात्मा अविद्याकामकर्मविनिर्मुक्त इत्युक्तम्,
असङ्गत्वादात्मनः, आगन्तुकत्वाच्च तेषाम् ।

It has been said that the self-effulgent Ātman which is being described is
free from ignorance, desire and work, for it is unattached, while they are
adventitious.


Are there any other places (Sruti / bhashyam ), where we can find such
mention ? >>


A few are cited below. Upadesha Sahasri mentions there are hundreds of such
statements in Shruti / Smruti.


BU 4.4.7 कामा येऽस्य हृदि श्रिताः ।


BU 4.3.21 << तद्वा अस्यैतदतिच्छन्दा >>


Mundaka 2.2.10 << हिरण्मये परे कोशे विरजं ब्रह्म निष्कलम् ।
तच्छुभ्रं ज्योतिषां ज्योतिस्तद्यदात्मविदो विदुः  >> Bhashyam for विरजं
<< विरजम्
अविद्याद्यशेषदोषरजोमलवर्जितं >>
