In the above objection, question is raised wrt "the selfeffulgence of the
Atman", as in -

>> the selfeffulgence of the Atman is not its true nature, since it is not
perceived in the state of profound sleep

Here, the objectioner, is equating the selfeffulgence with desire, work
etc, in the sense that it is Agantukam.

This is refuted by the Advaitin ( as seen above)

Also, in the above assertion:

>> it is asserted that the selfeffulgence is certainly present in profound
sleep , but it is not perceived on account of unity ; it is not advetituous
like desire, work etc. >>

Here, << it is not perceived on account of unity>>, ït" refers to
selfeffulgence of Atman in Sushupti ( as clearly stated स्वयञ्ज्योतिष्ट्वस्य
सुषुप्ते अग्रहणम्)

In continues and concludes as -  न तु कामकर्मादिवत् आगन्तुकम् - it is not
advetituous like desire, work etc.

Here, why do you interpret ït" as Avidya , and not as "selfeffulgence of
Atman" is not advetituous like desire, work etc ? Avidya was never the
objection raised, it was always wrt the selfeffulgence of Atman..

Is it not more appropriate the concluding ït" to refer to the "selfeffulgence
of Atman", which is verily the subject in question, as seen in this entire
discussion thread in the bhAshyam.

Pl clarify..


Thanks
