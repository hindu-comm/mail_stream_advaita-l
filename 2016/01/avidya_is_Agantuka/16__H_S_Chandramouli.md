A clarification/correction. Reg my earlier post


<< avidyA (अविद्या) is not considered to be adventitous (आगन्तुक) which
implies repititous comig and going.  >>,


adventitous (आगन्तुक) can be considered as having both beginning and end .
Thus with reference to specific sthUla sharIra( स्थूल शरीर ), the
kAraNasharIra (कारणशरीर ) is considered adventitous (आगन्तुक) even though
kAraNasharIra (कारणशरीर ) by itself for a Jiva is considered anAdi ( अनादि)
.


I am offering this clarification in advance anticipating objections on this
count !!
