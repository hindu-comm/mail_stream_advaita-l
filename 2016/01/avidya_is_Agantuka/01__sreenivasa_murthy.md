Dear Sri Ravi Kiran,
You write :"It has been said that the self-effulgent Ātman which is being described is
free from ignorance, desire and work, for it is unattached, while they are
adventitious."
Atman is not only free from ignorance but also he is free from knowledge. He illumines both knowledge (jnana) and ignorance (ajnana). 

You can refer to Sri Shankara's UPADESHASAHASRI .

With regards,Sreenivasa Murthy

Namaste

In the bhashyam to Br.Up.4.3.22, it is said that ..

प्रकृतः स्वयञ्ज्योतिरात्मा अविद्याकामकर्मविनिर्मुक्त इत्युक्तम्,
असङ्गत्वादात्मनः, आगन्तुकत्वाच्च तेषाम् ।

It has been said that the self-effulgent Ātman which is being described is
free from ignorance, desire and work, for it is unattached, while they are
adventitious.


Are there any other places (Sruti / bhashyam ), where we can find such
mention ?

Thanks
