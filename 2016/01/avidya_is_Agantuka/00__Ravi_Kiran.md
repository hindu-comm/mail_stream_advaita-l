Namaste

In the bhashyam to Br.Up.4.3.22, it is said that ..

प्रकृतः स्वयञ्ज्योतिरात्मा अविद्याकामकर्मविनिर्मुक्त इत्युक्तम्,
असङ्गत्वादात्मनः, आगन्तुकत्वाच्च तेषाम् ।

It has been said that the self-effulgent Ātman which is being described is
free from ignorance, desire and work, for it is unattached, while they are
adventitious.


Are there any other places (Sruti / bhashyam ), where we can find such
mention ?

Thanks
