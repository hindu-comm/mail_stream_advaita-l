Namaste Sri Chandramouli Ji

I had noted your references in earlier e-mail, but had not got chance to
check the same (in the bhashyam and the context in which it is stated), for
the mention of avidya as Agantuka ..Thanks for the clarification

As we can see in Br.Up bhAshyam, it is said that the svayam jyotistvam of
Atman is not perceived in sushupti, due to ekibhAvam

** स्वयञ्ज्योतिष्ट्वस्य सुषुप्ते अग्रहणम् एकीभावाद्धेतोः, न तु
कामकर्मादिवत् आगन्तुकम्

In that line, it is said while avidya is Agantuka, svayam jyotistvam is
not, as it is the very innate nature of Atman.

It further states - self-effulgent Atman (in sushupti) is free from
avidya-kAma-karma

** अविद्याकामकर्मविनिर्मुक्तमेव तद्रूपम्, यत् सुषुप्ते आत्मनो गृह्यते
प्रत्यक्षत इति

In this line of thought, was interested to see further refs/elaboration
regarding this mention.

Thanks
