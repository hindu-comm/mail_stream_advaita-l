Going by your above reasoning,

suppose the Jiva realizes its identity with Atman during  जाग्रत् (waking)
through
Sruti maha vAkya (Guru upAdesa), is it fair to say that -

in the state of सुषुप्ति, when the (realized) Jiva is directly in
association solely with the Atman, it will continue to know  its
identity with the Atman, since there is no longer आवरण ( ignorance of one's
own true
nature ) caused by अविद्या, as it was destroyed by the realization in जाग्रत्
(waking) ?

In that case, such a jIva upon waking up from deep sleep  should mention
that It
continued to have Self-knowledge (Atma jnAna) during सुषुप्ति ?

Thanks
