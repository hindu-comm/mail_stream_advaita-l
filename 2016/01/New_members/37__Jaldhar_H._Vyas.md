----------------

I am a cultural theorist, in that, I am interested in studying human
cultures as knowledge dispositions to be learnt as against studying them as
phenomena-to-be-explained. This led me to the study of my own culture by
using categories available therein. I began to explore intellectual
traditions first from the perspective of a social scientist but now
increasingly from the perspective of a student. My upbringing in a family
belonging to the Advaita sampradaya has, in a way of speaking, naturally led
me to take up the study of Advaita seriously.
