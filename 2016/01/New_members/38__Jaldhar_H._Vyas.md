Shashi Vishvanath
-----------------

Hello everyone,

My name is Shashi.
I'm born in the Telugu smarta community. 
and I'd love to learn a little more 
of the tradition of my ancestors.
I'd also love to learn from the experience
of people born outside it but who have made it 
their own. 
I look forward to a wonderful satsanga.

Hi I practise yoga regularly and am very interested in yoga philosophy. I
realise that after many years there is so much wealth of knowledge and that
I have only really scratched the surface. I am therefore interested in
deepening my knowledge and have just read an article on the four levels of
speech which was fascinating and want to read more.
