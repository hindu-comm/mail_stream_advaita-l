प्रणाम,

Also when we watch the videos, we see many seekers in the audience.  While the advantage of ambience in front of a Guru is there, how does it differ with how a person consumes online because I too make myself a member of the audience?  In fact, while viewing on computer, I can pause, read the book a bit, go back to check on doubts and investigate more thoroughly.

The real advantage, in my view, is if the live audience members are able to sit down with the Guru and ask questions in a prolonged and consistent way, in a regular fashion stretching over weeks and years.

धन्यवाद,
Sanju

Supposed I listen on line to Swami Paramarthanandaji talks - the questions you have raised will be answered. Now a days many on line talks are available to an earnest seeker.
