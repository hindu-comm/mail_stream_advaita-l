Namaste,
The following lines found in the book -
The Doctrine of Maya
In the Philosophy of the VedantabyPrabhu Dutt Shastri-
available at :-
http://www.forgottenbooks.com/books/The_Doctrine_of_Maya_1000025687  -
is interesting as in 'vyavahAra', when we speak of Brahman', 'mAya' cannot be excluded !
"...We may, however, note here in passing that where Indra is spoken of as assuming various forms (cf.especially iii. 53. 8 and vi. 47. 18) it appears that the singers of the hymns " and Indians of the Vedic age in general" were not unaware of a distinction between the one and the many, of the possibility of the one becoming the many and of the latter being a deceptive creation of a mysterious power...' (page 12)

 Namaste,
A good informative capsule.
The presentation certainly does declare that the Vedic people really had the knowledge of 'monotheism'.

But, Subbu Ji, listening to wouldn't one get a feeling that the 'brahman' is an object to be sought and experienced outside...
