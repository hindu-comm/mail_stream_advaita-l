namste,
I think one needs to go through the Mudgalopanishad to really understand the Purushasukta. The Nirguna and Saguna is a reversible situation. In scientific terms we can probably say that there is no change in entropy in a reversible situation. In common parlance, nothing is lost or gained in that reversible situation. A part of Him becomes manifested and then gets eventually dissolved and this cycle is repeated. This reminds me of what Shri Ramakrishna Paramhamsha said - A time will come when one will realize the Vedantic truth in one day. 

Regards,Sunil KB

 Namaste

If you are saying Para Brahman can have form show some Sruti
references to show he has four hands and so on. There may be Narayana
Sukta but there are also other Siva Para mantras like Sri Rudra in
Yajur Veda. Then there will be fight between Vishnu Para and Siva Para
views. What is the use of this? When will it end?
