Namaste Sada ji,

I think there is no need to deviate from the Bhāṣya (where Shankara has
given the straightforward meaning: umā, haimavatī, the daughter of Himavān,
and consort of Shiva) unless there is any special advantage in resorting to
such etymology, that too, in a convoluted manner, by so deviating. Rūḍhi,
prasiddhi, is stronger than yaugika, etymology.  If one has to resort to
always break the words into letters and somehow derive a meaning distinct
from what they give straightaway, there is no need to specify
deities/persons with specific names. Even Madhva does not take any other
meaning for the 'Umā' there other than Pārvatī.

In fact in the Shivasahasranāma of the Mahabharatha, names such as 'viṣṇu'
and 'kṛṣṇa' are present.

regards
subbu
