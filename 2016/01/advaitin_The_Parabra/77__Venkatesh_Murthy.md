Namaste

If you are saying Para Brahman can have form show some Sruti
references to show he has four hands and so on. There may be Narayana
Sukta but there are also other Siva Para mantras like Sri Rudra in
Yajur Veda. Then there will be fight between Vishnu Para and Siva Para
views. What is the use of this? When will it end?
