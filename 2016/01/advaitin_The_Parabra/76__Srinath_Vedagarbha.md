As other member said (about Uma), when prasiddhi artha exist for Vishnu
shabda as refering to rUpa chaturbAhu/lakshmIpati etc , why resort to
yOgika artha as "all pervading" ?

This will be problematic only for those they wrongly think that rUpa-s of
Parabrahman are similar to rUpas-s as delineated/limited in space as we
know it in mundane world.
