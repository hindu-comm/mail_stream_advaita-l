Dear
sriDurgaSuktham is a prayer addressed to Sri Durga only is my view.Durgam Devihum Saranamaham prapdye meaning I prostrate on the feet of Sri Durga matha.She is of Agni Varna says the Suktham.Ofcourse there are references to The qualities of Agni and direct address to Agni too.But invocations are only for Sri Durga who is conceived as a dispeller of all obstacles and who stands as a fort-Durgam -against inimical tendencies.
R.Krishnamoorthy.
