Dear Friends,As per sriram P's sugesstion , I am not checking the fonts, phonotics and the ritualistic writing of the stanzas, I agree. All these sukta's has to be taught or learnt from guru mukha or by a poper vaidiki guru.
But my objective of posting these is that any one who knows or a youngster who is interested in knowing the meanings can understand the bhasya or translation of what they chants. Nothing more than that.kamesh

DURGA SUKTAMThis is a prayer to the fire God Agni occurring in the MahaNarayana Upanishad. Durga is used here as a word for Difficult problems.salutation to Durga in all aspects. (But many people consider this as prayer togoddess Durga for removing all obstacles and evils). This translation is basedon Maha NarayanaUpanishad by Swami Vimalanda.TheDurga sooktam in praise of Devi is one of the traditionally recited pancha sooktasof the Vedic tradition.
