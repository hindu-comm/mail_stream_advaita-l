Sakshi is always understood as 'antahkarana sakshi.'  Any knowledge, both
yathaartha or ayathaartha, valid and erroneous, have to take place in the
antahkaranam only.

By definition, the dream state is the one where although the gross body and
sense organs are dormant, the antahkaranam is awake.  The Mandukya mantra
is there for this, which says, the the 19 organs are functioning, but these
are of the vasana type. So, the dream happens while the mind is awake.

In the Panchadashi it has been shown that even the deep sleep experience of
sukha and ajnana are 'captured' by avidyavrtti but requiring the anandamaya
kosha to be alive.  Only then, he says, that it is possible for the person
to recall that experience upon waking, thru the vijnanamaya kosha.  So, he
says, even in sushupti it is not the antahkaranam is 'wholly' dormant; a
segment is awake: anandamayakosha.
