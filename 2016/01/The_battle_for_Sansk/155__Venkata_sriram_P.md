At the beginner level using Kalidasa to teach Samskrit doesn't help either.

Without the study of आदिकाव्य, how can one learn देवभाषा ?

One should independently try आकाञ्शा, अन्व्यक्रमः including दण्डान्वयः and खण्डान्वयः 
with the help of  रामायण, at least संक्षेप रामायणं to attain confidence level.

Only then, one should touch another book.
