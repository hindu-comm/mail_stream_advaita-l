 Namaste

They are not realizing the Siva Vishnu Superiority debate will become
परस्पर निन्दा only. For outsiders it will be nice entertainment
because two groups are insulting Hindu gods and the devotees also.

Example if they say Siva Mahimna Stotra is not Vedic but used for Siva
worship. The other group can say Vaayu Stuti promising enjoyment of
many beautiful heavy breasted women to Vaisnavas in Vaikuntha written
by recent author should not also be used in Puja but it is used. Like
this it will continue and make tempers rise on both sides. And
outsiders will be enjoying the fun.
