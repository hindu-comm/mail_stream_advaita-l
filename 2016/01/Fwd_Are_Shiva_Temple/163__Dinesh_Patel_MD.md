Poet Narsinha Mehta gets frequently quoted   Gandhi popularized the the divine poem
Vaishnav Jan-- 
One of the stanza specifically says 
Ninda na karo Koni ray
Means do not do
> परस्पर निन्दा
That is true Vaishnav 

> परस्पर निन्दा
This is artificially created as 
Om Brhaman Atma self is one 
Three respected gods
Bhrama
Vishnu
Shiv 
Are manifestations of one but depicted differntly 
They must be looking at the human race and wonder ?
I am not deep in this but I like to do
> परस्पर respect and not
> परस्पर निन्दा
