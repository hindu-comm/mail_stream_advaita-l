Dear Friends,            Universality is an inherent truth where as individuality is an idea. The Indian Yogic system speaks of the Chitta Vritti Nirodha, This means even if the modification of the mind ceases, still remains as alert mind. One experience a profound state of existence.
Most of the people wants to speak with the mind, it is not so easy to all the ordinary human beings like us and it is possible for this great Masters who had over come " Deha Abhimana" i.e Body Consciousness. It doesn't come easily as one has to spend many years in intense Tapas.
Human body is undoubtedly most sophisticated instrument on this planet with the source of life inside into this wonderful machine. Consequently every human retains subconscious awareness in the mind that there is more life than the physical appearance which makes him to know what is going around him.
If one is Silent, It doesn't mean that they are immature or innocent or not capable of doing anything. But what makes them to be like that is their " Janma Samskara " which makes them to keep cool although they know everything.
Finally, what i think is that one has to be hermit like life style after the completion of house hold activities/duties as per the individual karma in this maya world. I mean one has to perform his job in this samsara with great dedication and action as there is no excuse here to any body.
I mentioned previously that celibacy with be the best choice of life. Hermit life means wandering like a monk (Parivrajaka) with his chitta/will as his religion of his choice then I believe that the gods, goddesses, Masters, Prakriti will automatically unfolds and you will certainly join them on the final day of Judgement.
Any learned members may comment or contribute their view on my opinion.
