Hari Om,

Namaste.

The email talks about 'Yoga' which is dwaitaa,  not adwaitaa.

Adwaitaa is not against Yoga.    For an adwaitin, yoga is a bahiranga
sAdhanA, useful for antaHkaraNa shuddhi.
There are several bahiranga sAdhanA for antaHkaraNa shuddhi and Yoga is one
of them.


For an adwaitin
"
आत्मा वा अरे द्रष्टव्यः श्रोतव्यो मन्तव्यो निदिध्यासितव्यो मैत्रेय्यात्मनो
वा अरे दर्शनेन श्रवणेन मत्या विज्ञानेनेदं सर्वं विदितम् ॥ ५ ॥

बृहदारण्यकोपनिषद्भाष्यम् । द्वितीयोऽध्यायः । चतुर्थं ब्राह्मणम् । मन्त्रः ५
"

The Self, my dear Maitreyi, should be realized -- should be heard of,
reflected on and meditated upon. By the realization of the Self, my dear,
through hearing, reflection and meditation, all this is known.

thanks and regards
