Hari Om,
Namaste.

Another one:

The Avadhoota Gita
ईश्वरानुग्रहादेव पुंसामद्वैतवासना ।
महद्भयपरित्राणाद्विप्राणामुपजायते ॥ 1.1॥

IshvarAnugrahAdeva pu.nsAmadvaitavAsanA .
mahadbhayaparitrANAdviprANAmupajAyate 1.1

Through the grace of God alone, the desire for nonduality
arises in wise men to save them from great fear.

> Says the Sarva-vedanta-siddhAnta-sAra-sangraha:

> जन्मानेकशतै:  सदादरयुजा भक्त्या समाराधितो
>
> भक्तैर्वैदिकलक्षणेन विधिना सन्तुष्ट ईश: स्वयम् ।

> साक्षात् श्रीगुरुरूपमेत्य कृपया द्रूग्गोचरस्सन् प्रभु:

> तत्त्वं साधु विशोध्य तारयति तान् संसारदु:खार्णवात् ॥ (225)

> [The Lord, being pleased with the constant and unflinching devotion and
> worship in the prescribed manner, extending over many lives on the part of
> the seeker, manifests Himself, in His infinite mercy in the human form of
> the Guru, thereby becoming accessible to the shishya for shushrUshA and
> vichara which culminate in his crossing over the perilous ocean of

> When such a thing happens, the aspirant is left in no doubt that he has

> अहिंसासत्यब्रह्मचर्यसर्वत्यागशमदमादिसम्पन्नः

> Here we see the Acharya clearly stating the kārya-kāraṇa bhāva:  the
> effect, kāryam, of obtaining the grace and guidance of a Mahātma is
> dependent on the cause, kāraṇam: one's puṇya sanchaya over several lives.
> When this happens there will be no doubt to that aspirant that he has come
> under the grace of the 'apta'.
