Reg << Can we then say in Kali Yuga that asura represents the rajasik and
tamasik qualities in a person? If that is the case, was it also not true in
other yugas where Prahalad and Vibeeshana demonstrated dharmic and saatvik
qualities, so essentially being a deva although born to/as asuras?

On the other hand, Varuna for example is an Asura; without Varuna there is
no life. So I am not sure what the basis of classifying devas and asuras
would be. (lineage of children born to Aditi and Diti respectively?)
Kindly clarify. >>.


It is useful to recognize at the outset that the three qualities (
satwic,rajasic and tamasic ) are fully integrated and one cannot exist in
the absence of both the other two qualities. An excellent treatise on the
subject of Triguna is available in the work Sankhya Karika by Ishvara
Krishna with Vyakhyana of Vachaspati Misra ( which has been translated into
english ). It is a delight to read through this and I would say is a Must
for proper understanding of the subject.


It is not as if rajasic and tamasic qualities are intrinsically undesirable
always. They are essential to lead a normal life and in any case cannot be
dispensed with entirely except through Brahma Jnana. Even Iswara is endowed
with all the three qualities satwa,rajas and tamas. Otherwise Creation is
not possible. He has Desire to Create ( Ichha Shakti, tamasic quality),
Ability to Create ( Kriya Shakti, rajasic quality ) and the Knowledge to
Create ( Jnana Shakti, satwic quality ). The key is the tamasic and rajasic
qualities are active under the control of satwic quality. In asuras,
tamasic quality ( charecterized by the sixfold undesirable qualities of
kama,krodha,lobha,moha,mada and matsaryaकाम,क्रोध, लोभ, मोह, मद, मात्सर्य )
predominates followed by rajasic and satwic qualities in that order. In
devas, satwic quality is of a higher order than rajasic and tamasic
qualities. But not overly predominant as in the case of Iswara. Also
sometimes the latter two predominate over the former leading to
inconsistent behaviour . In the case of human beings, there is a regular
change in the predominance of the three qualities leading to desirable and
undesirable actions. That is the difference between the three. Depending
upon how far and how often desires and actions are controlled by the satwic
quality , they get graded as good and bad persons. It applies to all yugas.
