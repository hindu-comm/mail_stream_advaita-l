Dear Rajeshji,
No words can take the one who holds on to the reality of the waking world
alone as reality to the state beyond all the three states. One should
comprehend the reasoning of the experiences of all three states as mere
transient experiences, while the witness of all those states remains
unaffected by what ever happens in any of those states, including brain
injury or flying in the dream etc.
You are holding on to the waking state experiences alone to extrapolate to
the state beyond the three states and hence finding it difficult to move
forward.
Regards,
Aurobind Padiyath
