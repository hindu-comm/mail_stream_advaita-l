H.N.Sreenivasa MurthyPranam to all.
A friend of mine who is well versed in Shankara Vedanta, who had gone through all the postings on the above subject told me thus recently : " Is it not much better and more beneficial if one attains jnana first and then afterwards to discuss the 'Sushupti anubhava of Jnani and Ajnani' and come to an authentic conclusion ? Iis it not futile to discuss as Secondhand persons who have gathered information from books instead of discussing as Firsthand persons ? All these discussions done by others other than the one who has cognized what he is teaching / conveying will it be not like blind leading the blind as stated in the mantra1-2-8of Mundakopanishad". I saw an element of TRUTH in what he told. What do the respected members feel about this?
With warm and respectful regards,Sreenivasa Murthy.

Sri Praveen Ji,

Reg << Not the rope-snake, but here your very example of desert water
works well.
Having known that the water is nothing but its adhiShThAna desert sand, one
doesn't stop seeing it as water, because the refraction superimposing water
on the desert sand continues. Yet, one doesn't take it to be real water. >>

and << Only for vikShepa itself to be taken as real, AvaraNa is necessary
.>>,

Would it not be more appropriate to state that what was निरुपाधिक भ्रान्ति
(nirupAdhika bhrAnti ) prior to Jnana becomes सोपाधिक भ्रान्ति (sopAdhika
bhrAnti ) after attainment of Jnana ?? The corresponding illustration would
be that of moonlight and the moon itself. भ्रान्ति (bhrAnti ) continues as
long as the उपाधि (upAdhi) lasts, but its reality does not.

Just a thought.

Regards
