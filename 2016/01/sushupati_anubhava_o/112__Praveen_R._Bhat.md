I don't know if its more appropriate but it looks like another appropriate
way of looking at it. One common example given to understand that the
removal of AvaraNa doesn't remove the vikShepa, is that even if we know
that the sun doesn't really rise or set, it doesn't stop our seeing the
as-though sunrise and sunset.
