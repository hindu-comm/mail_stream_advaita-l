jnAni's AvaraNa once gone cannot come back. TikAkAra Anandagiri indicates
this in the introduction to Mundaka, while refuting jnAna-karma samucchaya,
so: यदा ब्रह्मात्मैकत्वं विस्मरति तदा उत्पन्नविद्योऽपि करिष्यति ततः
समुच्चयः सम्भाव्यत इति न वाच्यम् इति आह-- विद्याया इति। Linking to what
Bhashyakara says: विद्यायाः कालविशेषाभावात् अनियतनिमित्तत्वात् च
कालसंकोचानुपपत्तेः ।  You may want to refer to that part in Kailashashram
teachings.

As Durga Prasad Janaswamyji also replied that "To account for

That avidyA talked of is avidyA lesha which is since prArabdha is seen in
the form of jnAni's body.

There is only vikShepa, not AvaraNa. So the world is seen, but not as
different from brahman, since the true nature has been revealed once and
for all.
