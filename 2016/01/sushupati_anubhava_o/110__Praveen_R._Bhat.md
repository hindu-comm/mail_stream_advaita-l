Not the rope-snake, but here your very example of desert water works well.
Having known that the water is nothing but its adhiShThAna desert sand, one
doesn't stop seeing it as water, because the refraction superimposing water
on the desert sand continues. Yet, one doesn't take it to be real water.

Only for vikShepa itself to be taken as real, AvaraNa is necessary. The
jnAni perceives vikShepa as mithyA, superimposed on his own svarUpa.
