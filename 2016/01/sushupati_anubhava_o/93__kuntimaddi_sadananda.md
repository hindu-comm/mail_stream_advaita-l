Rajesh - PraNAms

>From my understanding:

First answer is - a jnaani does not sleep since he has realized his true nature - brahma vit brahmaiva bhavati - is the scriptural statement. Hence being Brahman he cannot or need not sleep! 

However, his BMI exists due to praarabda karma, hence this BMI undergoes as before the three states of consciousness. 

The ignorance in the deep sleep state for ajnaani is of three types 1. I do not know - (no knowledge of subject-object duality) 2. I do not know myself - that I am existent and conscious entity. and 3. I am happy due to the absence of duality 
Hence he remembers that I I slept very well, 2. I did not know anything including my own existence and 3. I was happy. 

For jnaanam there are two aspect involved 

1. vRitti jnanam that involves - paroksha jnanam - Brahmna asti - and the world is projection of Brahman etc. all the vedantic knowledge. 

2. Swamruupa jnanam through mahaavaakya vichaara. The first part being vRitti jnaanam is with the mind only. Hence when the mind is folded, that jnaanam is also folded - hence a jnaani also does not have knowledge of subject-object duality in the deep sleep state. 

4. The swaruupa jnanam is there as aham bramaasmi - hence jnaani sleeps as jnaani only. But that knowledge is not expressed since for expression again one needs the mind or instrument for expression. 5. He has both the reflected happiness to the maximum since there is absence of subject-object duality but the degree is the highest as pramoda etc. and happiness due to his own ananda swarupa. 

Hence to answer the question one has to separate the vRitti jnaanam vs Swarupa jnanam for a jnaani. For ajnaani since he has taadaatmyam with the BMI, the moola avidya and the tuual avidya (ignorance of subject-object duality) both are there in the deep sleep state. 

For transactions, a jnaani also may say, I did not sleep properly - but what really means is his BMI did not sleep properly. It is the same aspect if one asks does jnaani has praarabda karma or not. His BMI has to go through the praarabda karma but he does not since he is Brahman!

Hari Om!

 Namaste,

 Is there a difference in sushupati of ajnAni and jnAni?

 An ajnAni sushupati anubhava is "I slept well, I do not know
 anything, I
 experienced sukham."

 A jnAni statement is also the same or it is different.

 If it is same then is it possible that after some
 brain-injury his wrong
 conclusion, I am body, based on avidhyA could come back.

 Thanks
