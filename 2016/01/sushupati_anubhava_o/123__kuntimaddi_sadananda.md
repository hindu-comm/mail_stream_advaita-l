Sreenivasa murthyji - PraNAms

Just one question to your friend and perhaps to you to since you seem to endorse his opinion. How can one distinguishes, based on the reading here, whether one is realized or not? Does he have a litmus test to do that?  On that basis no one can ask any questions on Vedanta in this form since blind leading the blind is applicable for all. 

Someone went to Swami Tejomayanandaji and asked - Swamiji, have you met anyone so far who has realized? Swamiji said, jokiningly, that by that very question, the questioner has already resolved that Swamij has not realized and now wants to know who else has realized. There are no holos that will be developed after realization.  

Based on the answers, one can only say if one has knowledge of shastras to back up his understanding. 

So far I have not discovered any scriptural discrepancies in any answers that were provided by the discussers.  One may have a clearer understanding or one can quote the scriptures more thoroughly or have patience to do so. What is needed is clear understanding of the essence of Advaita vedanta - Brahma sathyam, jagan mithyaa, jeevo brahma eva na aparaH. The rest is only avanata vaakyaas in support these fundamental truths. 

Hari Om!

Sadananda

 H.N.Sreenivasa
 MurthyPranam to all.
 A friend of mine who is
 well versed in Shankara Vedanta, who had gone through all
 the postings on the above subject told me thus recently :
 " Is it not much better and more beneficial if one
 attains jnana first and then afterwards to discuss the
 'Sushupti anubhava of Jnani and Ajnani' and come
 to an authentic conclusion ? Iis it not futile to discuss as
 Secondhand persons who have gathered information from books
 instead of discussing as Firsthand persons ? All these
 discussions done by others other than the one who has
 cognized what he is teaching / conveying will it be not
 like blind leading the blind as stated in the
 mantra1-2-8of Mundakopanishad". I saw an element of
 TRUTH in what he told. What do the respected members feel
 about this?
 With warm and respectful
 regards,Sreenivasa Murthy.

 Sri Praveen Ji,

 Reg << Not the rope-snake, but here
 your very example of desert water
 works
 well.
 Having known that the water is nothing
 but its adhiShThAna desert sand, one
 doesn't stop seeing it as water, because
 the refraction superimposing water
 on the
 desert sand continues. Yet, one doesn't take it to be
 real water. >>

 and
 << Only for vikShepa itself to be taken as real,
 AvaraNa is necessary
 .>>,

 Would it not be more
 appropriate to state that what was
 निरुपाधिक भ्रान्ति
 (nirupAdhika bhrAnti ) prior to Jnana becomes
 सोपाधिक भ्रान्ति (sopAdhika
 bhrAnti ) after attainment of Jnana ?? The
 corresponding illustration would
 be that of
 moonlight and the moon itself. भ्रान्ति
 (bhrAnti ) continues as
 long as the
 उपाधि (upAdhi) lasts, but its reality does
 not.

 Just a thought.

 Regards
