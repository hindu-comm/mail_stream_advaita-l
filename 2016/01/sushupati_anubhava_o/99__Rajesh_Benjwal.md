Namaste,

To *Praveenji,*

My emphasis on forgetting his true nature again is because of fear of
avidhyA which, I think avaraNa remain active even after jnAnam, is there in
some manner. As Durga Prasad Janaswamyji also replied that "To account for
prArabda karma lesha mAtra avidya need to be accepted in case of a jnAni."
So I asked about the possibility.

If avidhyA is not there at all then adhyAropa also should not be there at
all. But I think is not true, may be I am wrong. Like when we know the
rajju, snake disappear.
In case of mrigmarichika we keep seeing water even after knowing that is
not water but in that case the AvarnNa and vikshepa both keep working.


To *Venkatraghavan Sji,*

You are right but that is the question if jnAni is totally free from
avidhyA while body is still alive and he is braham in absolute sense OR
there are some ..................


To Aurobind Padiyathji,

I kept in mind your point also that He sleeps but with state of awakening.
There, there is no Avarana which makes him forget his nature. "Yad gatva na
nivarthante"
