Namaste,

Is there a difference in sushupati of ajnAni and jnAni?

An ajnAni sushupati anubhava is "I slept well, I do not know anything, I
experienced sukham."

A jnAni statement is also the same or it is different.

If it is same then is it possible that after some brain-injury his wrong
conclusion, I am body, based on avidhyA could come back.

Thanks
