Dear Rajeshji,
Your question
"but this jnAnam take place in
antahkAraNam which can develop
again the
association with the body mind complex somehow, OR it can
not
this is the question to ponder upon."

This question doesn't have validity in the state of Janani "Janathe dvaitam
na vidhyate ". Your Austin can come up only when there is Ajnana.
Janana and Ajanana or Vidya and Avidya are like light and darkness. Even
though opposing in nature, once light illumine darkness vanishes (often
explained as destroyed which is not correct as a thing has to be a vastu to
be destroyed but darkness is not a vastu but absence of light) That
darkness is both existing and non - existing. Existing because it gives
rise to misapprehension and nonexistent as the vastu it cannot be
described. This light of knowledge once dawns, all misapprehensions that
the absence of right knowledge created cannot come back.
Regards,
Aurobind Padiyath
