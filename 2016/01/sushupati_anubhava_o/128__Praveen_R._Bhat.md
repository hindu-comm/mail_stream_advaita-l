True.

It is very unfortunate that some people find the discussions pertaining to
the nature of jnAna, the experience of a jnAnI, etc, as anyA vAchaH! I
can't help notice that the same people do not apply the rule to themselves
and consider that their discussion about others having "anyA vAchaH
discussions" (including what I am doing right now with this mail) as more
anyA vAchaH!! Its a strange working of Maya, indeed. :)

praNAms,
