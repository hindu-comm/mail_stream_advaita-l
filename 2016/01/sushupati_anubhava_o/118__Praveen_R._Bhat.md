How else?!

If there is an authentic conclusion, that is discussed in the same works of
the tradition that make up Vedanta study. And that is the entire pursuit.

How would anyone know whether one is a "first hand person" or a "second
hand person"? As long as the people discussing are shrotriya or are trying
to be so, it is very helpful. That is, it is a further assumption that
people on the thread/ list are gathering information from books. Books are
reference tools unless people can hold and remember everything with their
medhAshakti.

Please refer the context of Mundaka mantra 1.2.8, if not in a book, then
with someone you put your trust in. It talks of those worldly people who
consider karma or aparavidyA as the last word and considers themselves to
be great. It is not in the context of people wanting to be free and raise
questions to learn that. On a related note, Bhagavatpadacharya considers
shrotiyatA to be one of the two qualifications to have, if not a more
useful one than brahmaniShThA.

Kind rgds,
