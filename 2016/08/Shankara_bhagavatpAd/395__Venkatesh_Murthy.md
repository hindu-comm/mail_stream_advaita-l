Namaste

5 years back itself this topic was discussed here. Kindly see archives
for June and July 2011. Ganapati Atharva Sheersha Vakyas like Tvameva
Sarvam Khalvidam Brahmasi, Tvameva Pratyaksham Brahmasi, Tvam Sakshad

is Brahman only. As a matter of fact we can show many Pramanas for all
five Panchayatana deities are Brahman. No need to make any deity
inferior like the Dvaitis.
