 An opinion of mine is that the Mahabharata is roughly or approximately Hinduism.
That is, the Mahabharata approves of almost every path which may be called "Hindu".
Here are some reasons for this claim.


(1) All the Deities are worshipped in their respective Temples or Shrines - Vishnu, Shiva, Devi!

 (Sage Pulastya says,) "The pilgrim should then, O king, proceed
 to the tirtha called Anaraka. Bathing there, O king, one never meeteth with distress hereafter.
 There, O king, Brahma himself with the other gods having Narayana at their head, is ever present,
 O tiger among men! And, O royal son of the Kuru race, the Wife also of Rudra is present there. Beholding
 the Goddess, one never meeteth with distress hereafter. There in that tirtha O king, is also
 (an image of) Visweswara, the Lord of Uma. Beholding the God of Gods there, one is cleansed of all
 his sins."

(2) Vishnu is of course praised in several places, but Shiva is accorded due respect in three important ways:
 (i) The Most Powerful Weapon in the Universe - the Pashupatastra - is in the custody of Shiva.
 (ii) The Vedic Hymn most glorified is the "Rudram", which is addressed to Shiva.
 (iii) Krishna is repeatedly hailed as the Greatest Devotee of Shiva.

(3) All the various "sects" of Hinduism are accepted as genuine paths to Moksha,
 albeit clothed in a world-view best described as "Advaitic Vaishnavism"! :-)

 “Vaisampayana continued, "I have thus narrated to thee, O monarch, the circumstances connected
 with the former birth of our revered preceptor, viz., Vyasa of unstained mind, as asked by thee. Listen
 to me once again. There are diverse kinds of cults, O royal sage, that go by diverse names such
 as Sankhya, Yoga, the Pancha-ratra, Vedas, and Pasupata. The promulgator of Sankhya cult is said
 to be the great Rishi Kapila. The primeval Hiranyagarbha, and none else, is the promulgator of the
 Yoga system. The Rishi Apantaratamas is said to be the preceptor of the Vedas, some call that Rishi
 by the name of Prachina-garbha. The cult known by the name of Pasupata was promulgated by the
 Lord of Uma, that master of all creatures, viz., the cheerful Siva, otherwise known by the name of
 Sreekantha, the son of Brahma. The illustrious Narayana is himself the promulgator of the cult, in
 its entirety, contained in the Pancharatra scriptures. In all these cults, O foremost of kings, it is seen
 that the puissant Narayana is the one sole object of exposition. According to the scriptures of these
 cults and the measure of knowledge they contain, Narayana is the one sole object of worship they
 inculcate."”
