An article of which I sent an intimation to in this group also does not
appear to have been delivered to the members.  If this is true, pl. access
the article from this URL:

https://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/advaitin/conversations/messages/67885

Somehow, my posts containing a URL does not go straight to the members.
The Mail managing company 'Mailman' probably thinks that the URL I give is
of some kind of a virus destination.
