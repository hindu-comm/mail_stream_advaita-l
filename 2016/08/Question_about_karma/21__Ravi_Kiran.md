True, it has been discussed at length in this forum, that jnAni karma
cannot be seen as *karma* as it is like burnt seeds ( incapable of
sprouting) and merely have the appearance, as there is no trace of avidya
kAma karma, avidya - having been destroyed by Brahma vidya (paramArtha
jnAna).

In paramArtha jnAnam itself, where there is no question of creation (ekam
eva adviteeyam sath svarUpam), there can be no question of any karma
either..
