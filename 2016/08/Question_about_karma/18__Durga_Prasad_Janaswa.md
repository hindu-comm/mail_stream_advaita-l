Hari Om,
Namaste.

Not sure the context of Karma yogi, whether referring to a jiGYaasu or a
GYaanI.

To a GYaanI, jagat is baadhita / mithyaa. Jagat includes body and mind.
That is, body and mind are also baadhita / mithyaa.

shaastra serves a  purpose to a jiGYaasu. The same  shaastra becomes
 mithyaa to a GYaanI. When shaastra itself a mithyaa, then karma yoga is
also a mithyaa to a GYaanI.

When a GYaanI knows that there is no snake but only a rope, the GYaanI does
not engage in analysis of snake viz. height of snake, weight of snake,
species of snake, whether punya accrues by dropping the snake in a forest
or paapa accrues by killing the snake or whether to leave the fruits of
such punya / paapa to some other person / God  etc.

GYaanI continues to do the activities he has been doing prior to
realization. This is one of the reasons why a jiGYaasu is told to engage in
bhakti / yoga /  niSkaama karma.

regards
