maya and avidhya are one and the same. yogavashistha clearly says that
maya, avidhya, ahankar, manas, are not different from each other at all,
expressed differently.

Applying a simple logic :

 avidhya = ahankara.
ahankara = manas
 manas= maya
avidhya = maya

this very logical rendering is also maya and avidhya   as Goudapada refutes
the very logic to show the Truth Ultimate as even beyond advaita
