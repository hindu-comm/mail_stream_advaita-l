Dear
Maya is the result of Avidhya. Maya is what is perceived by our sense
organs. You can read Mandukhya upanishad and Gaudapada karika for
understanding these two. You can also listen to SriParamarthanandha
lectures in the website mediafire.com under the heading Vichara Sarga
Both are difficult concepts.

advaita?
