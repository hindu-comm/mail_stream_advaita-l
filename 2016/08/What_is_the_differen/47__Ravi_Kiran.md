Existence is always of the Self, (ekam eva advitIyam)

सदेव सोम्येदमग्र आसीदेकमेवाद्वितीयम् ।

It is said in Brihadaranyaka Upanishad, for a knower of Brahman everything
has become the Self..

यत्र वा अस्य सर्वमात्माइवाभूत्तत्केन कं जिघ्रेत्, तत्केन कं पश्येत्, तत्केन
कं शृणुयत्, तत्केन कमभिवदेत्, तत्केन कं मन्वीत, तत्केन कं विजानीयात्?
येनेदम् सर्वं विजानाति, तं केन विजानीयात्? विज्ञातारम् अरे केन विजानीयादिति

Because when there is duality, as it were, then one smells something, one
sees something, one hears something, one speaks something, one thinks
something, one knows something. (But) *when to the knower of Brahman
everything has become the Self*, then what should one smell and through
what, what should one see and through what, what should one hear and
through what, what should one speak and through what, what should one think
and through what, what should one know and through what? Through what
should one know That owing to which all this is known—through what, O
Maitreyī, should one know the Knower ? ( trans: Swami Madhavananda)
