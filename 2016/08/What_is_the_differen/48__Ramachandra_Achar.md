Subbu sir,

               You gave "gumma," example and said,when you come out of that
notion....gumma is mithya

Here comming out of notion means notion is present at this time right?

And also at the beginning there was only brahman or paramarthika not even a
pinch of agnana

>From there how vyvaharika jgnana or agnana came?
Without existance can some notion of agnana come?
