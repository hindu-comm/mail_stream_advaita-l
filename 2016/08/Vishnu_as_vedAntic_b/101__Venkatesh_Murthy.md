Namaste

It is to counter attack Madhvas and other Vaishnava groups we will
praise Siva's greatness but not to make Vishnu inferior. We believe
both Siva and Vishnu are not different. As a matter of fact there is a
Hari-Hara Vigraha worshipped by many to recognize this.

Yes it is perfectly alright to prove Supremacy of Vishnu but then do
not say Vishnu and Siva are different and Siva is inferior. Because if
you do that you are not following Advaita. This is the point.

It's only fair that Lord Vishnu is praised as well, right?
