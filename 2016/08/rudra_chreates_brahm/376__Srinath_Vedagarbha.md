You did when you argued with me. Isn't it advaita's main tenet that
chid-chid aikya? whether it is between Vishnu & Shiva, or Vishnu & Jiva, or
between Shiva & Jiva ?

My argument for both the parties is that -- even though Shankara seems to
quote Vishnu sarvottamattvaM in his works, given advaitic doctorine of
chin-mAtra aikya, you do not have any hEtu to argue for Vishnu supremacy.
Do not tell me Mbh and other shrutis has Vishnu sarvottamatvam as mukhya
tAtparya, but they do not have chin-mAtra-aikya as theit stand either.

For other member who says Shiva sarvottamatvaM, also do not have any hEtu
in arguing given that he also subscribe to chin-mAtra-aikya doctorine.

In reality, while arguments about Shiva sarvottamatvM is only for Shaivas
(who are not advaitins), where as Vishnu sarvottama argument is for
VaishNavas (who are also non-advaitins). This topic should not be an
argument among advaitins themselves.
