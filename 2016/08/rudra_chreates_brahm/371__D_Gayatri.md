Since Shankara quotes only the Vishnu supremacy portions in the Mbh,
we may safely ignore the Shiva supremacy portions.

If one really were holding to the view of Hari-Hara aikya, then one
would not have claimed that Shiva is the only one fit to be meditated
upon. One who really holds the VSN bhashya as authentic would not have
claimed that Vishnu lives under Shiva's grace or Krishna begged
forgiveness from Shiva. So the Hari-Hara aikya-vAda is merely a
smokescreen.
