By that argument, verses supporting Samkhya or Pashupata or
Pancharatra philosophy in the Mahabharata, will also have perfect
validity.

And you claim that only Shiva is fit for worship. So much for hari-hara aikya!

I believe the vaishnava commentaries on Rudram were composed by
Acharyas of Ramanuja tradition. I dont think the bloggers composed
them. You must have noticed that the bloggers follow the sampradaya of
Ramanuja. So there is nothing wrong with them presenting their own
tradition.

As far as I know, Sri SSS also makes the same claim, in a different
context, that many later advaitins have not followed the original
teachings of Shankara. There is nothing new in such sort of claims.
Nor am I asking you to take it lying down. You are welcome to write
whatever you want. But then, if your intentions are beyond question,
so should my intentions be. You see the point? It is called fairness.
And as you must be very well knowing, the blog itself initially
started as a reaction to another Shaiva blog, which has your full
approval. If you have shown your full approval to the Shaiva blog
which makes ridiculous claims on Vishnu, then you must be prepared to
face the Vaishnava blog too.
