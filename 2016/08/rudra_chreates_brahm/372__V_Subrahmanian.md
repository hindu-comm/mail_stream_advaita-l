There is no rule that an entire text should be quoted by an Acharya to have
validity. Even if a text were not at all quoted, still that text does not
lose validity.

The portion from the Harivamsha was highlighted solely to show that the
bloggers who claimed that 'only Vishnu is allowed by shastras to be the
upasya for vaidikas.'  You failed to note this.

All the above were also to counter that vaishnava view which has no other
agenda than to show Shiva as inferior and Shankara as vaishnava. One can
see their urgency to compose 'vaishnava' commentaries on Rudram, etc  There
is also the campaign of those bloggers to malign the Acharyas of the
Advaita parampara by showing them as not followers of Shankara. You have
also lent support to them in other forums before by calling the Kanchi
Acharya as 'pseudo advaitin'. Why should advaitins take it lying down? To
show that all acharyas from
Veda Vyasa onwards are harihara abheda vadins would be the best way to free
oneself from sectarianism.
