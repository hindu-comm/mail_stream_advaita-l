Dear friends,

Gayatriji wrote as follows:

Quote
<To my knowledge, I never invoked oneness of deities. You are merely
assuming things. In fact, the above argument is applicable to the
opposite party. They thoroughly denigrate Vishnu first and in the end
they claim that all deities are one and the same.>
Unquote


It is very clear from her statement that  Gayatriji had not read Adi Shankara's "Prabodha Sudhakara". Had she read that she could not have made this absurd statement.

Regards,
SKB

 So you think the
 works that I quoted do not belong to Shankara or
 Vyasa? Does the BSB not belong to Shankara?
 Does the Mbh not belong to
 Vyasa?

 not, you invoke supremacy of your deity (apparently
 Vishnu).

 To my knowledge, I
 never invoked oneness of deities. You are merely
 assuming things. In fact, the above argument is
 applicable to the
 opposite party. They
 thoroughly denigrate Vishnu first and in the end
 they claim that all deities are one and the
 same.

 I
 dont think your post to me has any purpose either except to
 denigrate me.


 > All the while you kept claiming
 "shankara claimed so and so is supreme"..now when
 you are shown that Shankara also claimed something contrary
 to your view...you say he "would not have."

 The opponents were quoting
 from the VSN bhAshya, which I have always
 doubted is an authentic work of Shankara.
 That's why I kept confined
 myself to his
 universally accepted authentic works like BSB, BU
 bhAshya etc.


 > Like Kartik pointed out,
 you dont seem to be prepared to accept that all arguments
 and participants have to follow the same set of rules.

 Can you list out what rules
 that I did not follow?


 > Politely, it would be beneficial if you
 would withdraw from posting more on Vishnu is Supreme
 argument as I believe you started the pointless
 excercise.

 This is what I
 do not understand. When Shiva is talked of as supreme
 and Vishnu is denigrated, it does not bother
 you. Why does it bother
 you so much if the
 opposite point of view is presented?
