These portions are directly contradicted by the MB itself, by Krishna
himself, by the verses cited from the BORI edition.

Also, given that we have the VSN, which is part of Mbh and commented upon
by Shankara with quotations replete from various sources to hold Hari-Hara
abheda and trimurti aikya and Shiva parama kāraṇam, etc. and the highest
Advaita also with innumerable upanishadic citations both in the prelude as
well as in the body of the VSN, we can take Shankara's Vedantic  position
as this alone. And in the Prashna bhashya too Shankara holds Rudra to be
brahman.
