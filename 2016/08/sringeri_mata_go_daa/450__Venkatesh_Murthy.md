Namaste

You can do Go Daana with help of Ramachandrapura Math. There are some
branches in Karnataka. Kindly contact them. They are also producing
many cow products like pure Panch Gavya and pure distilled Desi cow
urine Go Teertha. I am taking 15 ML everyday with water on empty
stomach.  It is the best tonic for the body and mind. It can cure all
diseases like heart diseases, diabetes, cancer, liver problems,
respiratory disease and so on.
