Namaste

जन्माद्यस्य यतः इति सूत्रेण शिवस्यैव बोधो भवति।

The knowledge of Siva is given by the Sutra Janmadyasya Yatah. Why?

We have to split the words like this.

जन्म आद्यस्य यतः

From Him there is the birth of The First One Adya.

Who is the First One Adya? It is Vishnu. Adya is one name of Vishnu.
He is the first one and from Him there was a Lotus and in that Lotus
Brahma was born. Then Brahma created the Universe. There are many many
Pramanas for this.

Who is left in the Trimurtis? Siva.

Therefore the meaning of the Sutra is From Siva there is the birth of
the First One Adya Vishnu. From Vishnu Brahma and from Brahma the
Universe was created.

Siva is therefore the Para Brahman of Vedanta.
