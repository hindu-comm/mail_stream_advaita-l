Namaste

On page 35 of Dakshina Bharata Vidwat Goshthi the scholar Sri
Ramakrishna Bhat from Kalady has written -

दृश्यते च द्विविधं श्रुतिवचनम् - परमार्थब्रह्मस्वरूपावेदकम् यथा
’निष्कलं निष्क्रियम्’, ’अजरोऽमरः’, ’अस्थूलमनणु’, ’सत्यं ज्ञानमनन्तम्’,
इत्यादि । जगत्कर्तृत्वेश्वत्वसर्वज्ञत्वादि धर्मविशिष्टब्रह्मावेदकं
द्वितीयम् । ’यतो वा इमानि भूतानि’, ’तत्सृष्ट्वा तदेवानुप्राविशत्’,
’सर्वज्ञः सर्ववित्’ इत्यादि । तत्र पारमार्थिकदशायां व्यवहाराभावः ।
व्यवहारदशायां तु व्यवहारमुपपादयति द्वितीयश्रुतिवचनम् । अत्र भगवत्पादाः
- ’परमार्थावस्थायामीशित्रीशितव्यादि व्यवहाराभावः प्रदर्श्यते ।
व्यवहारावस्थायां तूक्तः श्रुतावपीश्वरादिव्यवहारः ’एष सर्वेश्वरः एव’
इत्यादि (सू. भा. २-१-१४)

There are two types of Srutis. First is the Srutis making known to us
the Paramartha Nirguna Brahman like 'Without parts and action',
'without old age and death', and so on. The second is Srutis making
known the Brahman with qualities like Creator of World, the Ishwara,
All Knowing One Sarvajna and so on. The second type Sruti examples are
'from Him all things are produced', 'He created and entered into it',
Áll knowing Sarvajna' and so on. In the Paramartha condition there is
no Vyavahara. The Vyavahara condition is described by the second type
of Srutis. Sankara Bhagavatpada has said in Sutra Bhashya 2-1-14 -
There is no Ishwara the Lord and being ruled by Him in Paramartha
state. In Vyavahara Avastha only there is Ishwara.
