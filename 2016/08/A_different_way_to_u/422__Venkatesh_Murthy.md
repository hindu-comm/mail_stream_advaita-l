The Janmadyasya Sutra with Siva as Origin of Vishnu, Brahma and the
world may not be there in Sankara Bhashya. But it is not opposed to
the Bhashya. We have to remember Siva Purana saying Siva is both
Nirguna and Saguna. For Upasana purposes He is Saguna but His Natural
State is Nirguna. If you take Siva as Saguna only it will be a
mistake.

First Sutra Athato Brahmajinasa is asking us to do Inquiry into
Nirguna Brahman. But second Sutra is explaining Creation. Second Sutra
cannot be about Nirguna Brahman. Nirguna Brahman cannot be creator of
anything. Siva is both Nirguna and Saguna. In first Sutra He is the
Nirguna Brahman. In Second Sutra He is Saguna Creator by giving birth
to Vishnu and Brahma and from Brahma the World.
