PraNAms - without getting into these discussions - just wanted to point out that janmaadyasa yathaH - is only taTastha lakshana - not swaruupa lakshana- since inquiry can be done only from the point of intellect which perceives plurality which is not really real. 

As Vaishnavism points out that through Lakshmi only -which is the eight-fold creation (ashTa Lakhmi) one can reach Narayana. Through inquiry that involves jnaana vRitti, one can understand the truth. There is a vRitti vyaapiti but no phala vyaapti. 

If we understand the import of the scriptures, all these discussions become really meaning-less, to say the least.
Hari Om!Sadananda



      From: Venkatesh Murthy via Advaita-l <advaita-l at lists.advaita-vedanta.org>

The Janmadyasya Sutra with Siva as Origin of Vishnu, Brahma and the
world may not be there in Sankara Bhashya. But it is not opposed to
the Bhashya. We have to remember Siva Purana saying Siva is both
Nirguna and Saguna. For Upasana purposes He is Saguna but His Natural
State is Nirguna. If you take Siva as Saguna only it will be a
mistake.

First Sutra Athato Brahmajinasa is asking us to do Inquiry into
Nirguna Brahman. But second Sutra is explaining Creation. Second Sutra
cannot be about Nirguna Brahman. Nirguna Brahman cannot be creator of
anything. Siva is both Nirguna and Saguna. In first Sutra He is the
Nirguna Brahman. In Second Sutra He is Saguna Creator by giving birth
to Vishnu and Brahma and from Brahma the World.
