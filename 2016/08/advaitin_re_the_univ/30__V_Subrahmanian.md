Dear Sir,

I agree with all that you say above by way of quotations.  However, to your
question above, I would like to respond as follows:

In the Bhagavadgita there are chapters 10 and 11 where the vibhūti and
viśvarūpa of Brahman is detailed. One might think that there is absolutely
no Advaita in these chapters.  Yet, upon close examination one would find
that there is the seminal teaching of Advaita there too.

If one would take the time to study the Vishnu Sahasranāma Bhāṣya of
Shankara, one can reap a very rich harvest of Advaita Vedanta therein.
Countless Advaitic concepts have been packed in that work by Shankara.
Especially the introduction contains a good lot of advaitic teaching. The
'nāma' portion too has here and there nuggets of Advaita buried in. It is
for the aspirant to unearth them and use them to the hilt.

Viṣṇu and Śiva are, though theological deities, yet, they, rather It, forms
the bedrock of all theology and Vedanta, being Brahman in essence.


In order to clarify to the readers at large that Viṣṇu and Śiva are verily
Brahman and not two deities opposed to each other, there is a need to bring
out aspects in the scriptural works that teach us the non-difference of
Hari and Hara.  Shankara in deed brings out these aspects to establish
Advaita, Ekatvam, in the VSN.

If you say we should adhere to 'anyā vācho vimunchata', then Shankara
should not have commented on those two chapters of the BG and the entire
VSN.
