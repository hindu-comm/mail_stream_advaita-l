Namaste VS mama,

Looks like you have used your gmail pictures to source the posts.(https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/?ui=2&ik=f5078b8526&view=fimg&th=15656bd5a2e6a83e&attid=0.3&disp=emb&realattid=ii_15656a41547ef434&attbid=ANGjdJ_1CuFoxyhEX-RvwchgXLf5MZ_U2XJKJw5PQ7L6Db2fyL4BAQHGWvuGk13VPl_rqtu92FBH5w7jjnb0kbVGFqZ5LB-aSyMMI4RTVuQvt5authaUeRO3Oah-Qag&sz=w906-h274&ats=1470378137648&rm=15656bd5a2e6a83e&zw&atsh=1)
. Only those who have permission to your image in the gmail will be able to view it. Probably you need to use a different cource or copy paste it to a word document and share.

regards,
Ganesh K.

 Dear Subramanian
 ji,

 Yes I went to this
 site
 https://adbhutam.wordpress.com/2016/08/05/the-universe-is-sivas-eight-fold-form-harivamsa/

 checked on FF 48,
 Chrome Version 52.0.2743.116 m, Opera 38.0.2220.41 ,
 Microsoft Edge (browser for Windows 10), Internet Explorer
 11. 

 Since I rarely use
 Chrome and do not use IE / Edge, hence there is no old
 cache. You might be viewing images because of cache. Please
 clear all history and cache, refresh browser or close and
 open again. 

 Kind Regards
 Sujal
