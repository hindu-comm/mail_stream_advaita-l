Namaste

This is very interesting. We all heard Sloka was first time uttered by
Adi Kavi Valmiki with sorrow of the death of a Krauncha bird when it
was making love with a female bird. The Soka of Valmiki got converted
to Sloka.
Soka converted to Sloka first time is this -

Maa Nishaada Pratishthaam Tvamagamah Shaashvateeh Samaah |
Yat Kraunchamithunaadekam Avadheeh Kaamamohitam ||

He has said this first Sloka was from his Soka -

Padabaddhoksharasamah Tantrilayasamanvitah |
Sokaartasya Pravrutto Me Sloko Bhavatu Naanyathaa ||

What is the connection of Brahmana Mantras with Soka?
