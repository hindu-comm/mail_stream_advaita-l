The Bṛhadāraṇyaka Up. 2.4.10 has a mantra (Vedas being brought out by
Brahman at the beginning of creation) which has these words:  पुराणं विद्या
उपनिषदः श्लोकाः (purāṇam, vidyā, upaniṣadaḥ, ślokāḥ...)  for which Shankara
in the bhāṣya says:

श्लोकाः ब्राह्मणप्रभवा मन्त्राः ‘तदेते श्लोकाः’ (बृ. उ. ४-४-८)

 इत्यादयः,
'ślokāḥ brāḥmaṇaprabhavāh mantrā...'[śloka-s are mantras which are from the
brāhmaṇa].
Vidwan Sri Mani Dravid Sastrigal said there is an discussion in the
purvamimamsa sutras on this too.
