Namaste

There is a hidden meaning in the first Sloka of Valmiki. Outside
meaning is he is cursing the hunter who killed the male Krauncha bird
making love. Therefore Valmiki was in great sorrow seeing the killed
bird and his sorrow got converted into Sloka.

But many people do not accept this. Because the first Sloka cannot be
a curse. If first Sloka itself is a curse it is not Auspicious
beginning to Kavya literature. Curse cannot be Auspicious. Therefore
we have to see Inner Meaning.

What is the Inner Meaning? Maa is not only Don't but also can be
Lakshmi. But Seeta is form of Lakshmi in Ramayana. What is Nishaada?
It means Hunter. Who is the Hunter? It is Raama. Why? Because He
killed Raavana like a Hunter killing animal. Raavana was Kaama Mohita
too much attached to sex desire and other people's wives. He was
behaving like animals and against Dharma. Maa Nishaada is one word
like SeetaRaama or SriRaama. Raama is also Hunter because He had
killed Vaali like an animal.

Who are the Kraunch bird couple? They are Raavana and Mandodari. Of
them the male Raavana was killed by Hunter Maa Nishaada or Seeta Raama
Prabhu. When Raavana the male bird with too much sex desire was killed
the female Mandodari was crying with grief.

Even though Raavana was very addicted to sex desire his wife was a
great Pativrata and wished his welfare always.

The First Sloka is not a curse but it is blessing by Valmiki on Raama.
O Hunter SeetaRaamachandra. Your greatness or Mahatmya will be there
for countless years. Why? Because You killed the male Krauncha Raavana
addicted to sex desire and followed Your Dharma. The Dharma of a King
is to protect the good and punish the wicked.
