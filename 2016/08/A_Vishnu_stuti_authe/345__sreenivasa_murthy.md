Dear Smt. Gayathri,
You have stated :"By quoting this Vishnu stuti in his BSB, Shankara has also
authenticated this portion of Mahabharata. This once again shows that
Shankara accepted Vishnu as brahman."
Sri Shankara has accepted not only Vishnu as Brahman but also he has categorically declared that everyone and everything including himself is Brahman . Please permit me to draw your kind attention to the following statements from Upanishads :
ahamEvEdagM sarvam || Chandogya 7-25-1AtmaivEdagM sarvam || Chandogya 7-25-2brahmaivEdaM viSvaM variShTham || Mundaka 2-2-12
The Shloka 83 from Bhishmastavaraja reads thus : yasmin sarvaM yataH sarvaM yaH sarvaM sarvataSca yaH | yaSca sarvamayO nityaM tasmai sarvatmanE namaH ||
 When the Sruti has declared thus, what are you trying to establish by he flood of your postings? Is It not much more beneficial and fruitful to utilize the time and energy ,used for these kind of postings, for utilizing to realize and and cognize the TRUTH that YOU ARE ALSO BRAHMAN? please ponder over this.
With respectful and warm regards,Your well - wisherSreenivasa Murthy

 Subject: [Advaita-l] A Vishnu stuti authenticated by Shankara bhagavatpAda

Namaste

Here, I will present another Vishnu stuthi in the Mahabharata that is
authenticated by Shankara bhagavatpAda himself (and I am not talking
of BG here). In this stuti, Vishnu is again praised as the vedAntic
brahman and Shankara authenticates this in his BSB.

The topic in BSB is that in the chhandogya upanishad, Vaisvanara
should be taken to mean brahman and no other mundane meaning should be
attached to it. Shankara gives some reasons why this should be so and
in BSB 1.2.25, Shankara quotes the Mahabharata again -



By quoting this Vishnu stuti in his BSB, Shankara has also
authenticated this portion of Mahabharata. This once again shows that
Shankara accepted Vishnu as brahman.

Regards
Gayatri
