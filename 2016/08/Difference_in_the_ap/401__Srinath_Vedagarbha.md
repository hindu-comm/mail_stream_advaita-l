Your very identification that Veda as "para vidya" is quite unvedic and
wrong. muNDakopaniShat has this say about entire aagama texts;

As you can see muNDakopaniShat puts the entire Agama, the only admitted
source
of knowledge of Brahman, under the category of apara vidyA as per
"tatraaparaa R^igvedo yajurvedaH saamavedo.atharvavedaH ".

So, your premise itself is wrong here.

Aren't you refuting yourself by quoting gIta (which is non-vEda and apara
per you) to justify your position? This is the classical svavachana virOdha
or apasiddhAnta flaw in tarka.

More over Advaita does not accept all Shruti as scripture, in addition,
preferring to arbitrarily brand some inconvenient ones as "atatvaavedaka"
and "anuvaadaka," so its own record in this matter is highly questionable.

It may be so for advaitins. But for others they are going by the very
definition of 'Agama' as given by texts themselves and consider purANas as
quite valid in this context;


RigAdyA bhArataM chaiva paJNcharAtramathAkhilam.h |
mUlarAmAyaNaM chaiva purANaM chaitadAtmakam.h ||

ye cha anuyAyinastveshhAM sarve te cha sadAgamAH |

(vEda-s starting from Rg, and the pancharAtra in their entirety, the mUla
rAmAyaNa in its entirety, and those purAaNa-s that follows the previous.
These, and others that follow these, are all sadAgamA-s; others are
durAgama-s, and from these janArdana (Brahman) is not known)

Also shruti asserts `itihAsapurANaH panchamO vEdAnAm vEdaH'

In another place Bru.Up asserts --

(Just like how smoke and sparks emits from the raw firewood, similarly;
from the Great Being of `hayagrIva' rUpi parabrahman, all these of
Rig-yajur-sAma-atharvaNa vEda-s, itihAsa, purANa, mUla vEda, Upanishads,
brahma sUtra, vEda-vykhyAna-s, yAga, hOma, annadAna, jaladAna, aids to
achieve
paralOka, all charAchara creatures emits at the beginning of creation. )

Brahmatarka is also  quoted by the early 17th century advaitin
AdvaitAnanda, the author of BrhmavidyAbharaNa on Shankara's BSB.

As far as charge of aprasiddha texts are concerned, it also apply to
others. Aprasiddha Paingi upaniShat is quoted by Shankara. Please show me
any non-advaitic tradition who holds such texts as yoga-vashiShTha,
adhyAtma-rAmAyaNa etc as valid.

Why that far, there is big disagreement about texts authored by Acharaya
Shanakara himslef in the tradition, what to speak about such ancient texts
such as Brahmataraka etc. not being carried on by advaita tradition.
