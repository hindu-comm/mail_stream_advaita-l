Sir, above quoted verse (on sadAgama) is not Madhav's own, it is brahmANDa.
If you have any disagreement on it, please take it to Vyasa, who is also
guru for Shankara,

Where does above quote excludes Shiva Gita? It clearly says any "other"
works which closely follow above listed works, can be considered as
sadAgama.

If Shiva Gita is also ekadAtmakaM with other texts listed, definitely it is
also be considered as 'sadAgama' (as per Vyasa). By accusing Madhva you are
implying Shiva Gita is not comply with other texts. It is indeed a joke you
are saying HH Swamji is writing on non-sadagma text
