Yes he does. The Bhagavad Gita itself is part of the Mahabharata. Shankara treated the Bhagavad Gita (which is included in the Mahabharata) as an Upanishada. and he wrote bhashya on the Bhagavadgita separately and not together with the ten Upanishads. Lord Ram told that if one has to read one upanishad then it should be the Mandukya and mind that this statement was made around the end of the Treta yuga and in the very beginning of the Dwapara yuga and the Bhagavad Gita as a text was not available in the time of Lord Ram. We find in the Varaha purana  that the Bhagavad gita is the highest knowledge and that too imparted by the Paripurna brahman Lord Krishna himself.

 To my knowledge
 Shankara does take the support of the Mahabharata and the
 Manu Smriti to establish that Advaita is the purport of the
 non-vedic scriptures too.

 Well,
 there does not appear to be any valid reason at all to use
 Apara vidya to explain Para-Vidya. The Upanishads constitute
 the Vedanta,i.e., the highest knowledge and the Lord says in
 the Chapter 15 of the Bhagavad Gita that he Himself is the
 source of the knowledge of the Vedanta. The explanation of
 the highest jnana by lower jnana may appear obvious to the
 Dvaitins but not to the advaitins including the greatest
 Advaitin, Adi Shankaracharya.



 As to the claim about Madhva's always citing specific
 texts, the Brahmatarka is the greatest obstacle for
 anybody outside the Madhva tradition to agree to that
 assertion. . Dr. B.N.K.Sharama himself admitted that Madhva
 quoted Brahmatarka 500 times, but nobody knows from where
 Madhva found the Brahma tarka and when during his
 life-time did the Brahmatarka vanish. Not even a single
 disciple of Madhva had seen the Brahmatarka. That is the
 reason why Non-Madvhites are justified in not recognizing
 the Brahma-tarka.
