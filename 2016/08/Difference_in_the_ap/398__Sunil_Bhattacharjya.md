Dear friends,

Kindly permit me to put before you the following assessment, given by  late C.R.Krishna Rao, a staunch Dvaitin, in pp.74-75 of his book  "Madhva and Brahmatarka" .

<Samkara generally restricts himself to the Upanishads for his authorities. Madhva on the other hand draws his quotations from the Vedas, the Upanishads, the pancharatras, the puranas, the Mahabharataand other authritative works. Some of the moot points have been clearly explained in the Smriti literature, and Madhva makes free use of it.>

Krishna Rao then goes on to say " The need for quotations from sources other than the Upanishads  to explain the Upanishadic texts seems obvious.

This clearly shows that Dvaitins prefer to explain Para-vidya with Apara-vidya. Please permit to take the side of Shankara in this matter.

Regards,
Sunil KB
