This is big joke. Madhva is first saying Brahman is Vishnu alone with
Kutarka. Then he is saying only Puranas glorifying Vishnu are
Sadagamas. Others are Duragamas. There cannot be a bigger joke on
Agamas than this. There is no place for narrow mindedness in Advaita.
Why not Siva gita? Why not Ganesha Gita? Sringeri Swamiji has written
Bhashya on Siva Gita. According to Madhva the Sringeri Swamiji has
written Bhashya on Duraagama. Another joke.
