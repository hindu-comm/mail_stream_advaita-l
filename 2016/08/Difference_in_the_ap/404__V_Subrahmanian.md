This is only your misconception. For example, in the Bhashya for the
Ishavasyopanishad 9, at the end Shankara says: न हि शास्त्रविहितं
किञ्चिदकर्तव्यतामियात् [Nothing enjoined by the scriptures can be unworthy
of performance.] In almost all upanishad bhashyas Shankara has shown the
'ekavākyatā', the non-contradictory nature between the karma and upanishad
portions. So, there is nothing that is 'inconvenient' for the Advaitin.

Can you give the reference? To my knowledge, that text was not available
even at the time of Appayya Dikshita. The author of the above work is a
much later one. It might be a quote from any Madhva work.

In this quote from the Bhashya, we can easily see that even though the
Paingi rahasya brāhmaṇam is not available now, the material, the viṣaya,
sourced by Shankara from there is not aprasiddha; it is very much prasiddha
as shown by him from the BG:

I do not know about Yoga vasishta by any non-advaitic tradition but the
 adhyAtma-rAmAyaNa is held very much valid, a favorite of a vaishnava sect,
which says they are the largest vaishnava sect in India: the one where Sri
Ramabhardacharya is the prominent head. They say they  are followers of Sri
Ramanuja. This Acharya is a scholar in Vyakarana and his doctorate thesis
was 'apāṇinīya prayoga in the adhyAtma-rAmAyaNa'. They hold that work at
great eminence. Once I pointed out that the adhyAtma-rAmAyaNa has a
specific section where the jahadajallakśaṇā is espoused and a criticism of
this lakṣaṇā by Ramanuja.

There has been no non-advaitic Vedanta tradition during the time of
Shankara. We know this from his bhashya where he says:

In the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad 2.1.20 bhashyam Shankaracharya makes a very
far
reaching statement:

// sarvopaniShatsu hi vijnAnAtmanaH paramAtmaikatva-pratyayo vidhIyata
ityavipratipattiH sarveShAmupaniShadvAdinAm. //

[That `All the Upanishads teach the idea of unity/identity of the Supreme
Atman
and the individual Atman’ is an undisputed understanding of all the
adherents of
the Upanishads.]

From this we come to know that during / prior to Shankaracharya’s time there
were no vedAntic bhedavAdins, dualists, of any shade basing their systems on
the Upanishads.

If there had been texts such as Bodhāyana vritti or Brahma tarka prevalent
in his times, he would have certainly noticed them.
