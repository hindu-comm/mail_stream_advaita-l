Sorry a botched OS upgrade left the website and list server down from 
Friday Evening to just now.  Everything is back to normal now.  But if you 
sent a message to the list and you haven't seen it yet don't resend just 
yet as the server is still processing the backlog.  If by Wednesday you 
don't see it then it is ok to resend.
