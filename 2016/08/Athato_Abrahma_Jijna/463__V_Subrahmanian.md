अ refers to Brahman as per a Rg Vedic mantra. So, Madhvacharya used this in
his Kathopanishad bhashya for the word ‘अक्रतु:’ occurring in I.ii.20. He
conveyed that he who has Viṣṇu for his goal, sankalpa, kratuḥ, will
attain...[For Shankara, akratuḥ means he who has no worldly sankalpa,
desire..]

By applying this meaning, the ‘a-tat tvam asi’ will be comprehended as:
‘विष्णुतत् त्वं असि’ – You are that 'Tat' which is non-different from
Vishnu. Or if one wants to take the vākya as 'atattvam asi', then it will
mean: 'You are Viṣṇutattvam.'
