Not so fast! There is yet another possibility - that there have been ELIMINATIONS from
rather than interpolations into the original text! For you to claim that the larger text
must have interpolations is invalid, because it is a definite possibility that the
shorter text had eliminations from the original text!

But you're missing the more important point - even the smallest of extant Mahabharata texts
has the following references to Shiva as the Supreme:
 (i) The Most Powerful Weapon in the Universe - the Pashupatastra - is in the custody of Shiva.
 (ii) The Vedic Hymn most glorified is the "Rudram", which is addressed to Shiva.
 (iii) Krishna is repeatedly hailed as the Greatest Devotee of Shiva.

In fact, every single quote in this link on Supreme Shivais present in the BORI critical edition:
