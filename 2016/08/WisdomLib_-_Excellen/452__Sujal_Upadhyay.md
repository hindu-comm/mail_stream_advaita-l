Pranams,

I just came across a site which has a collection of many articles, books,
shAstra-s and Ksankara commentaries on few upanishads like prashna, etc on
this site.

This site has recently uploaded Sankara bhashya-s, which can be seen on
home page. Sankara bhashya is only in English, but moola sloka is in
sanskrit (both devanagri and IAST), followed by English Translation.

Besides, Hinduism, it has texts from other religions like Buddhism.

It's a great effort by Admin of this site. Appreciate his hard work.

OM
