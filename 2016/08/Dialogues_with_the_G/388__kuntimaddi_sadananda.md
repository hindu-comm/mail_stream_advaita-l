Venkatraghavanji - PraNams
It was a divine injunction to overcome the so-many devilish posts on the nature of parabrahman- whether it is Shiva or Vishnu - The number of posts is overwhelming. 

Shiva word is there in the Vishusaharanaamavali - and in the mantra 7 of Mandukya - indicating auspiciousness and Vishnu meaning vyaapakatvam - in the parabrahman there cannot be divsions or distinctions of any kind. The rest is only for upaasana.

Your post is therefore divine intervention in the flood of devilish arguments. 

ThanksHari Om!Sadananda

Oh it is devas! I was wondering why there were so many references to devils!
Thanks for pointing out.
