Nice sharing .. Interesting to read Acharya's note on vAsanAkSaya on page
50.

When, by dint of practice, you have made all your vaasanas
good and practically eliminated the chance of any bad
vasanas leading you astray, the sastras take upon themselves
the function of teaching you how to free your free-will even from
the need of being led by good vasanas.
You will gradually be led on to a stage when your
free-will will be entirely free from any sort of colouring due
to any vasanas. At that stage, your mind will be pure as crystal
and all motive for particular action will cease to be.
Freedom from the results of particular actions is an inevitable
consequence. Both fate and vasana disappear.
There is freedom for ever more and that freedom is
called moksha.


Thanks
