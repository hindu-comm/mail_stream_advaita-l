Thank you for the Dialogues. They are very relevant to the recent
discussions too as you'd pointed out.

A few printer's 'devils' have crept into the pdf file viz., the word 'deva'
at several places has been wrongly printed as 'devil' presumably by the OCR
software playing devil's advocate!  (For example pages 21, 23 and 24.) A
simple find and replace of the word 'devil' with 'deva' should solve the
problem I guess.

Raghav
Namaste,

On the occasion of Upakarma and Gayatri japam, please find below a link of
a compilation of conversations between devotees and HH Sri Chandrashekhara
Bharati Mahasvaminah:

A very enlightening read, and curiously relevant to the recent discussions
in the group. To have a glimpse of Acharya's lucid, logical and intuitive
thought process is truly fascinating, and a blessing.

Regards,
Venkatraghavan
