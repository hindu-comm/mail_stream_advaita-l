Namaste Venkatraghavan ji,

Thanks for sharing such a lucid book. I'm in awe of the skill with which HH
makes each person use his own viveka and reach the right answer. It read
like the Upanishad dialectic at it's best. It's indeed a great pleasure to
read ... Or to put in the words of the book itself, "it's brahmAnanda". :)

Thanks once again.
