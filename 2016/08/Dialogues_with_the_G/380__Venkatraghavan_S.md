Namaste,

On the occasion of Upakarma and Gayatri japam, please find below a link of
a compilation of conversations between devotees and HH Sri Chandrashekhara
Bharati Mahasvaminah:

A very enlightening read, and curiously relevant to the recent discussions
in the group. To have a glimpse of Acharya's lucid, logical and intuitive
thought process is truly fascinating, and a blessing.

Regards,
Venkatraghavan
