 Namaste

In the website Vedantavidyarthi.org Swamiji's ongoing classes are
regularly uploaded. On behalf of a friend, I am looking for the link to
hear a very recent talk:

Manudkya Upanishad Mantra 6, Class No.13

If anyone can kindly locate this and pass on the link to me, I can thereby
help the friend who is a jijñāsu.

Thanks and regards
