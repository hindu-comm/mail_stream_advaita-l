That is not the only etymology.  Shankara, in No.23 of VSN gives few more
etymologies here:

अभिरूपाः केशा यस्य स केशवः. He whose hairs are very beautiful is called
Keshava.  Shankara gives a Panini sutra too here.

कश्च अश्च ईशश्च त्रिमूर्तयः केशाः ते यद्वशेन वर्तन्ते ...

All three are forms of Brahman and have their source and existence in
Brahman.  That is the meaning of 'yadvaśena vartante.'

Yet another is: केशिवधाद्वा because he killed the demon called keśī.

Since the etymology is not the sole one, it is certainly possible for
Keshava to arise from Rudra. No need to suspect interpolation. People good
at grammar can come up with several etymologies.
