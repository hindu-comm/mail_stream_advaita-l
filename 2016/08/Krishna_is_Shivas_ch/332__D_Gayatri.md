The existence of multiple etymologies does not invalidate any particular
etymology. All etymologies are equally valid and all are equally applicable
to Keshava. The author of VSN bhashya, uses all these etymologies to
indicate the same entity, Vishnu. It is not as if each etymology refers to
a different entity, which would be a ludicrous proposition. And since one
of the etymologies implies that Kesava is the controller of brahmA and
rudra, there is no way keshava could have arisen from rudra.

Thus, the interpolators of the Mahabharata, in this context, did a
remarkably poor job.
