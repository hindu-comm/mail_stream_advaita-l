To think that Shankara comments on each of the names there as applicable
'only' to the four-armed deity called 'Vishnu' is the folly.  For Shankara
that entity is Brahman of which one or some of the forms are relatable to
Vishnu the consort of Lakshmi.  For several names Shankara has commented
with the idea that it is nirguna brahman. For 'Rudra' Shankara gives an
etymology from Shiva purana that says: shiva is the supreme cause. Thus,
for Shankara that name in the VSN is shiva-param. Soma is alternatively
commented as 'one with umā, shiva' (not narasimha).  Bhutakrit, etc. at the
beginning is commented upon by shankara as 'one enitity taking three forms
to perform the functions, assuming three gunas.'

The 'control' etymology refers to Brahman that is the substratum of the
trimurtis. 'Controlling' is no more than being the source of the existence
of the three murtis. It is a passive one. So, that Brahman is beyond the
three murtis that are all created. Hence, it is quite possible for Keshava
the one with beautiful hairs to have arisen from Shiva, the one beyond the
three murtis. At that level the Vishnu beyond the three murtis and the
Shiva beyond the three murtis are non-different, Brahman.

Thus, none can prove any interpolation here. Those who allege that are only
doing an extremely poor job.
