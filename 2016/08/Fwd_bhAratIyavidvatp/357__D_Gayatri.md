For the (almost) exact verse, the following book published by Chinmaya
mission says that it is from Vishnu purana -

https://books.google.co.in/books?id=3UCHnUq18pUC&pg=PA17&lpg=PA17&dq=yadadatte&source=bl&ots=NWpVuscPLx&sig=R43o7p4MyOPtvfLx8347El99WbU&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjx0Z7KhsbOAhVEqo8KHbzDBvMQ6AEILDAG#v=onepage&q=yadadatte&f=false

However,  I searched the entire Vishnu purana ( at least one version) but I
could not find it anywhere in that version.
