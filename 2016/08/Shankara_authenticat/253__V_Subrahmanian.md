Shankara has always said in the Upanishad bhashyas that the background
story is only a stuti and the tattva conveyed there alone is relevant. So,
Shankara has left out that background as arthavāda. Hence, he has not
authenticated that irrelevant portion. Only what is relevant needs to be
authenticated and not the chaff.

In that case, Vishnu is also one among the devatās to be propitiated.
Shankara for that reason alone has included Vishnu also in the mantra
1.4.11 as one among the created deities since there is the 'well known'
instance for Shankara in the krishna yajur veda of Vishnu, listed among so
many other devatas as the pati of parvatas.
