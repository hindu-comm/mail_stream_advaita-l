This message alone is relevant to Advaita Vedanta. The incidental
information of the persons involved in the conversation is irrelevant to
Advaita Vedanta. So, the claim that 'Shankara authenticates Shiva is
Brahma's son' merely because the Advaitic message is contained there, is
only mischievous and smacks of bigotry and nothing more. For Advaita, even
the Veda, the container of the vedantic truth, is mithyā; what then to say
the irrelevance of the MB instance.

The above argument is invalid.  In the Br.up. 1.4.10 Shankara has clearly
said that the worship of devats, etc. is essential and conducive to the
generation of favourable mental state to the sadhana of advaita. Rudram is
directly favourable for the generation of Advaita jnana and hence Shankara
has authenticated it in the Jabala upanishad.
