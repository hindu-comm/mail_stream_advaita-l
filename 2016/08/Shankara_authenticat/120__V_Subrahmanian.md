In substantiation of the above, we have in the MB a conversation between
Krishna and Arjuna after the war where the former informs the latter that
it was Rudra, by name Kāla, that was responsible for the decimation of all
those warriors in the war. An article detailing this is available here:

Sri Vamśīdhara, a commentator on the Bhāgavatam has said that in all the
avataras of Vishnu, where the slaying of an asura was done, it was not
without the amsha of Rudra.  That is why it is symbolically depicted that
Rudra was born of anger. Without krodha the slaying does not happen. We
have in the Ramayana and the Bhagavatam how the Lord was fiercely angry
during those acts.
