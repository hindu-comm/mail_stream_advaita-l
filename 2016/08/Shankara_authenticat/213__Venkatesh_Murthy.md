I am sure there would be many among the Advaitins, who read the  puranas and knows this. Hope our Dvaitin friends would also read the puranas for these and not read the puranas selectively.
That is exactly the Dvaiti position. They read only Vaishnava Puranas
and say they are Sattvika Puranas. Other Puranas like Siva and Linga
Puranas they say are Tamasika and they will not touch them. If you
give a reference from Siva Purana they will not accept it. But they
will accept anything and everything from Pancharatra books.
