Namaste

The Sampradaya is important in accepting Veda translation.

There is a claim Guru Nanak is predicted in the Vedas. They have given
the Rg Veda Mantra for that.

(i) In Mandala 7-100, Mantra 4 and Chapter 6


 ví cakrame pr̥tʰivī́m eṣá etā́ṃ kṣétrāya **** Víṣṇur**** mánuṣe daśasyán /
dʰruvā́so asya kīráyo jánāsa urukṣitíṃ sujánimā cakāra //

meaning

"when in the world the sinful ways will be on the rise and noble
behavior will vanish, as the disappearance of the moon when on its
wane on the darkest night, there will appear Vishnu as a prominent
Prophet from the Kshetra Clan and will manifest in consecutive form
through 10 Prophets to bring back the ways of virtue to the ailing
world."
