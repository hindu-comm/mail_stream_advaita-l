Namaste

This whole discussion started with authentic critical edition of
Mahabharata. Here I will show a Critical Edition is Impossible. Every
Mahabharata version is corrupt including Critical Edition. Therefore
your argument based on
authentic Mahabharata as Critical Edition published in modern India is wrong.

Why? Because in Mahabharata Tatparya Nirnaya the great Madhvacharya has said

grantho.apyevaM viluLitaH kimvartho devadurgamaH | kalAvevaM vyAkulite
nirNayAya prachoditaH || 2.5  hariNA nirNayAn vachmi
vijAna.nstatprasAdataH  || 2.6
shAstrAntarANi saJNjAnan vedAMshchAsya prasAdataH |  deshe deshe tathA
granthAn dR^ishhTvA chaiva pR^ithagvidhAn || 2.7

5 - 7. When the original work itself is so altered, What is there to
say of its meaning which is intelligible (even) to the Devas only with
difficulty.  When the work had thus become altered in the Kali age,
under the direction of Hari for its clear understanding, I shall state
the settled truths having known them through His grace, and also
having well known the other (extinct) works and all the Vedas through
His grace, and also having examined the various editions existing in
several places.

In Madhva's time many many centuries back itself Mahabharata was so
corrupt and he says even gods can understand it with difficulty.

If Sukhthankar or someone in modern India is trying to do a critical
edition he is sure to fail because he is not a god. Therefore the
Critical Edition itself is corrupt and has many interpolations and
deletions.

What about Adi Sankara's references from Mbh? We have to not take them
as Primary Supporting texts. They should be taken with the rest of the
Bhashya and meaning should such as agreeing with rest of the Bhashya.

But you are taking them as Primary texts and making false assumptions.
