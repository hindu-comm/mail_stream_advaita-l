The Kaivalyopanishad directly says that one attains jnanam by chanting the
Shatarudriyam and enjoins its  chanting on the Sannyansins:

http://sanskritdocuments.org/doc_upanishhat/kaivalya.html?lang=sa

भवत्यत्याश्रमी सर्वदा सकृद्वा जपेत् ॥

अनेन ज्ञानमाप्नोति संसारार्णवनाशनम् । तस्मादेवं
विदित्वैनं कैवल्यं पदमश्नुते कैवल्यं पदमश्नुत इति ॥ २४॥


Shankaracharya is aware of the Upanishad as he has cited it in the VSN
bhashyam. The shatarudriyam is also called Rudropanishat in puranas and is
said to be the essence of upanishads. Its mention as the means to moksha in
the Jabalopanishat too is authenticated by Shankara who cites this
upanishat in the BSB.  If the mokshna sadhana in any upanishad is not
Vedanta friendly Shankara would not consider it to be an upanishat at all.

Further, Shankara has said in the  bhashya: nothing in the Veda is unworthy
of being practiced.

subbu
