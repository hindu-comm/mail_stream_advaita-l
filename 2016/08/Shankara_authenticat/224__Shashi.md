Dear D. Gayatri , 

Your statements are curious to me! I've been around Sankara's followers my entire life, and although I've encountered Advaitin Vishnu Bhaktas I've never encountered one who was both an Advaitin and a Veeravaishnava, like yourself. I'm aware that in South India there are a few groups of smartas - collectively a minority among Smartas- who've traditionally been Veeravaishnava, but I've never met such people in person. 

Because your interpretations are so different from what I understand to be mainstream advaita, I'm curious as to their sources. Are they the result of your own study, reflection, and inference? Are they part of a living lineage within the Sankara parampara? Is there a contemporary traditional Advaitin vidvan or sannyasi, in the line of Sankara, who also espouses your interpretations ? 

Namo Mahavishnave, 
Shashi
