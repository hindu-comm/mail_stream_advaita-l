Namaste! That's a fine piece of reasoning!

Here's my personal understanding, in plain English.

The pronoun "it" is considered gender-neutral:

http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/it

 “a person or animal whose sex is unknown or disregarded <don't know who it is>”

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender-specific_and_gender-neutral_pronouns

 “The masculine pronoun is he (with derived forms him, his and himself); the feminine is she (with derived forms her, hers and herself); the neuter is it (with derived forms its and itself).”

Although the word "it" is considered gender-neutral, it can definitely be used to refer to masculine OR feminine gender names, e.g.:

 "What is all the commotion on TV?"
 "IT is Michael Phelps!"

The person in question is a HE, but since the original question was in the neuter (or unknown)gender, it was appropriate to begin the reply in the neutral gender pronoun IT.
