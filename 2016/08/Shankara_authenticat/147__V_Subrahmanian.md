the ripe aspirants ऐतदात्म्यम् this-as-Ātman इदं this सर्वम् all  इति thus
आह declared परमाद्वयम् supreme non-dual

The purport of the above verses (from 101 to 108) is:

In this strain are mentioned, the end that is sought, the means for it as
also the relation between them, diverse nature of the universe, dharma and
adharma, the classification as also the duties pertaining to varṇa-s and
āśrama-s, of good and evil, the physical elements and their derivatives,
the distinction pertaining to words, and their meanings, the existence of
all else other than Ātman.

These are for seekers with feebler equipment. For seekers in the middle
range, with better equipment are mentioned –

Illusory nature of the world, existence of Māyā, Māyā as being responsible
for illusion, bondage as due to Māyā, episodes relating to the Master and
the disciple, Brahmavidyā (as the dispeller of primal ignorance),
Mahāvākya-s (sentence proclaiming the identity of the individual Self and
the Supreme Self) and reasoning as auxiliary, or, in brief, a host of such
other constructs.

All this is for the sake of the respective seekers.  The purport of the
Śruti, however, is not in these constructs or delineations.  She is
singularly devoted to the Supreme Brahman which is her own, true svarūpa
(essence).

In this manner, the great Śruti, depressed as she was, because of the
imperfect equipment on the part of the seekers and having offered
instruction leading each gradually, step by step, in his spiritual
progress, now unfolds, for the fully equipped, the Non-dual Absolute, in
the words – ‘All this is only the Ātman.’

One can see the MB contains all the stories, the dialogues about varna,
etc. dharma....

It does not matter whether it is or not in the critical edition. There are
'contradictions' coming not just from the purana but even from the
Upanishads!!  Jābāla, Shvetashvatara, Kaivalya and others have Shiva as the
Supreme Brahman.
