Alright, I think we are going again in circles. If you have read my
original message, you would not have raised this issue again. Anyway,
let me explain again. There are many interpolations in the
Mahabharata. But when an ancient Acharya quotes some portion of it,
that portion can be treated as genuine, especially when it is also
present in the critical edition. Here, Shankara bhagavatpAda quotes a
particular portion of the Shanti parva and in this portion, Shiva is
treated as the son of brahmA. Shankara's quote shows that this
incident is not an interpolation in the Mbh. This means, Shankara has
authenticaled the portion of the Mbh which treats Shiva as the son of
Brahma.

Again, we are going in circles, repeating the same points. In mantra
1.4.11, Vishnu is completely absent in the host of devatas. Moreover,
in his BSB, bhagavatpAda says at multiple places that Narayana is
supreme. So the above argument of yours cannot be considered as valid.
