The terms might be neutral but the context in which Shankara uses it there
is decidedly that of Shiva. Um훮, the daughter of Himav훮n, cannot be stated
to be living for ever with any other than Shiva, her consort. While Um훮 is
brahmavidy훮 in that upanishad as Shankara himself says, the Brahman there
is Shiva. The Suta samhita of the skanda purana too points out this.
