I want to make a point here about the Mahabharata itself. I want to
keep this point removed from the main debate. The shortest recension
of the Mahabharata has around 80000+ verses, while the longest
recension has around 120000+ verses. So between the shortest and
longest recensions, there are 40000 verses which are complete
interpolation. (That is almost half of the shortest recension).


Even if we take that 10% of the current shortest version of Mbh to be
an interpolation, that still gives us 8000 verses in the Mahabharata,
that would be interpolations. So let us not be surprised by the
magnitude of the interpolations in the Mahabharata.
