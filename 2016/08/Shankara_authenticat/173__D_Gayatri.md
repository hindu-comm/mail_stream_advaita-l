Please dont ask the same questions again and again. We are going round
and round in circles. Shiva cannot be brahman, according to Shankara
bhagavatpAda, because in his brihadaranyaka upanishad bhAshya 1.4.11,
Shankara says that Rudra-Pashupathi (Shiva) is a created entity. Now
you will again quote your same old article to show Narayana is also
created, but according to Shankara bhagavatpAda, Narayana is uncreated
and bhagavatpAda explicitly calls Narayana as paramAtman etc. I am not
interested in your personal opinions. I am only interested in what
bhagvtpAda says.

Tell that to the upanishad and not me. I have just quoted that
upanishad to show that Narasimha is also called as Umapati and a host
of other names that one would normally apply to Shiva.
