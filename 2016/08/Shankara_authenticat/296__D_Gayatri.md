It has already been shown that the JU does not imply that Rudra is
brahman in anyway. As for supremacy, Bhagavatpada himself says
Narayana of bhagavatas is paramatman, thereby accepting him as
supreme. Still, if some one wants to consider Shankara's quotes as
un-vedantic, then I cant help it.

If VSN is authentic, then then natural question that arises is why he
did not comment on SSN? May be because he knew SSN was bogus.

Nowhere does Shankara say that Rudra in the prashna upanishad is Umapati.

I find a curious contradiction in your views. You accept that NB
cannot do any creation and yet you say that the Narayana who took
birth as Krishna is NB!
