That is true. Only because it is well known that Umā, the daughter of
Himavān can logically be in eternal association with the Omniscient God,
Ishwara, Sw.Gambhirananda did not try to give the already well known,
never-in-doubt, word 'Shiva'.  For Umā, the daughter of Himavān can never
be in eternal association with anyone else.

In fact Advaitins have no ambiguity whatsoever in comprehending that line
of Shankara.  Only non-advaitins who are vaishnavas have a mental block in
accepting that Shankara refers to Shiva by that expression.

In fact Swami Gambhirananda does make the mention of the word 'Śiva' for
the Shankara's commentary to the Kena Pada bhashya 1.5 prelude:

तत्तस्मादन्य उपास्यो *विष्णुरी**श्वर *इन्द्रः प्राणो वा ब्रह्म भवितुमर्हति,
न त्वात्मा ; लोकप्रत्ययविरोधात् ।

//Therefore some adorable being other than that (Self), e.g Viṣṇu, Īśvara
(Śiva), Indra, or Prāṇa .....//

This is on p.52 of the Advaita Ashrama edition Eight Upanishads Vol.I.
Since Sw.G has given that clarification here, he did not translate the word
Ishwara as Shiva, which occurs only after this above bhashya.  No one will
ever wonder who the entity that Uma Haimavati will be eternally associated
is if not Shiva.

It is in the above cited bhashya that Shankara says that if the Upanishadic
Brahman is any attributed entity it is anātmā and abrahma.
