Depending on context, the word Ishwara can refer to God, or to Shiva
or to Vishnu or even to Indra. Even Indra is called as parameshvara
sometimes and Shankara does this, in the Kena upanishad bhashya itself
for mantra 3.11 and Swami Gambhirananda translates the word Ishwara
here as Lord. Therefore, Swami Gambhirananda has translated Ishwara as
Shiva only in that particular context that you show above and not in
the later contexts, which refer to Indra and God respectively. In the
Kena upanishad bhAshya itself, thus, the word Ishwara refers to Shiva,
Indra and God depending on the context, and exactly as Swami
Gambhirananda has translated it.
