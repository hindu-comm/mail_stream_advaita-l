This is not correct. The term Ishwara is used innumerable times in the
BSB by Shankara bhagavatpAda and in no case does it denote Shiva.
BhagavatpAda also calls Narayana as Ishwara in his BrihadAranyaka
upanishad bhashya and Bhagavad Gita Bhashya. In the BG itself, this
term is used both in a neutral sense and to denote Krishna. Nowhere in
the BG is the word Ishwara used for Shiva.

It is pure speculation to say that just because Uma has shown Brahman
to Indra, the Brahman must be Shiva. If it were Shiva and Shankara was
a Shaivaite, he must have taken the opportunity to say this. But he
does not.

You have completely misread the Prashna upanishad Bhashya. There,
Prana is treated as creator, preserver and destroyer. Here brahman is
being spoken of as everything. Such verses are pretty common. "sa
brahma sa shiva sendraH" speaks of Narayana himself as performing the
functions of creation, destruction etc. In Mahabharata, at many places
it is said that Vishnu himself is creator and destroyer. Even Shankara
bhagavatpAda quotes a purANa in his BSB 2.1.1 which shows that
Narayana is the creator and destroyer. I am merely following Shankara
bhagavatpAda.

The above conclusion is wrong because Shankara says that Narayana is
the supreme Atman in his BSB. That is why I said your article
contradicts Shankara siddhanta.

Nowhere have I said that the VSN bhashya is written by Shankara. I
only used the blog to quote from Madhvacharya's commentary on the
Mahabharata. So I will not bother replying to the rest of the portion
of your message.

Actually, that is what I am saying. In his BU bhAshya, 1.4.11,
Shankara takes Rudra as created and here I take Rudra to mean Shiva
only and no one else. Because Rudra is mentioned as Pashupathi and the
Rudra that is Pashupathi is Shiva only. Thus, it is clear that
Shankara takes Rudra as created.
