This stand is also quite correct.

We have sAkshAt Shiva's own words which excludes Himself from granting
'highest'  purushArtha --

In skanda purANa, Shiva tells Markandeya “ ahaM bhogaprado vatsA,
mokShadastu janArdanaH “  -- “O dear child, I am only a giver of prosperity
and worldly bhoga, but the giver of  mokSha is Janardana.”

Why?

The same purANa has the answer -- aj~nAnAM j~nAnado vishhNoH j~nAninAM
moxadashcha saH  |
Ana.ndadashcha muktAnAM sa evaiko janArdanaH

(To the un-knowing, Vishnu gives knowledge; to the knowing, He gives
moksha; To the liberated, He gives joy, and He alone is fit for all to
worship.)
