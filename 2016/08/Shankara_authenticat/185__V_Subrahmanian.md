He says Shankara is Sarvajna Ishwara in Kena bhashyam.  In advaita that is
nothing but Brahman. He also says Rudra is the annihilating power in the
Prashna bhashya. That is also Brahman as per the janm훮di sutra. Brahman can
not perform that function without the up훮dhi of Rudra and the other
functions without the respective upadhis that are Vishnu and Brahma.

That Narayana beyond avyakta is what is meant there which is Nirguna
Brahman, Turiya. If one takes that Narayana to be the formed, located,
attributed one then that is an훮tm훮, abrahma for Shankara, as per the Kena
bhashya. If this is understood there is no problem.
If that Narayana is different from Rudra and any other, then it is finite,
vastu paricchinna. Shankara has explained what this means in the Taittiriya
bhashya for the term 'anantam.'
Your personal views cloud your understanding of the bhashya.
