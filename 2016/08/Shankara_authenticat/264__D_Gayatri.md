For understanding who this Narayana is, one must look at his
introduction to Gita bhashya where Shankara says that Narayana took
birth as the son of Devaki and Vasudeva. Moreover, all the Adi parvan
verses that I quoted earlier, also unanimously support this view point
that Narayana took birth as Krishna. NB, being nishkriya, cannot take
any avatAra. So, the contention that Narayana in this context is NB,
does not hold any water.

Shankara separates the wheat from the chaff. So he does not quote any
verses that praise Shiva as supreme. It is interesting to note that
you already accept that Shiva-supremacy verses in Mbh may not be
conveying advaitic message. That itself should prove that they are
chaff rather than the wheat, as per Shankara. The Mbh also contains
other verses which praise sAmkhya, yoga, etc. and are not quoted by
Shankara for they do not convey advaitic message.

The RV 7.40.5 says Rudra derives his strength from Vishnu.
The BU. 1.4.11 says Rudra-pashupathi is a created entity.
The Satapatha Brahmana and Kaushitaki Brahmana say that Rudra is born
from Prajapati.
