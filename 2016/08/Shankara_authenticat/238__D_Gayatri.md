Hahaha. Actually, I remember reading in the Mbh about Shvetadwipa where
worshippers of Vishnu are implied to be young. However, I cannot guarantee
my memory is right. Anyway, coming back to reality, yes, worshippers of
Vishnu also age. But when did I ever say that mere worship of Vishnu
without any jnana, leads to immortality?
