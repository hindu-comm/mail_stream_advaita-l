Both BG and BS have full commentaries, and are hence authenticated.
But Shankara did not comment on JU, so the full text is not
authenticated.

There is no mention of Atman in verse 2.

It shows that the mantra's authenticity is not absolutely established.
Or it shows that the mantra is unimportant from an advaitic
standpoint.

But authentication of all chapters in BG is done by Shankara himself.
No such authentication is there for JU. And even if that verse is
genuine, it is mere arthavAda (this has become my favorite argument),
so it does not imply Rudra as brahman.
