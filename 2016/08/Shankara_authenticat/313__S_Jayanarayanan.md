Revered Sir, how then do you interpret the following verse(s) from the Jabala Upanishad?
(Which, one must add, is an Upanishad that is quoted by Sankara!).


 III-1. Then the disciple students (Brahmacharins of Yajnavalkya) asked him: ‘Pray, tell
 us, what is that mantra by reciting which one attains immortality?’ He replied: ‘By (reciting)
 Satarudriya’. These mantras are indeed the names of (Rudra to achieve) immortality. By
 (reciting) these (mantras) one becomes immortal.
