Exactly.  The context is Uma's eternal association with Shiva and hence the
Sarvajna Ishwara is Shiva only.  No one unless he is a pervert, will think
of any other person with whom Uma is eternally associated. None can succeed
in giving any other meaning than Shiva for the word Ishwara here.

Indra being called parameshwara is irrelevant here. In fact in the BU there
is the famous 'Indro Māyābhih pururūpa īyate' where Indra means the Supreme
Brahman that dons various forms to make itself known to the world.  The
root 'id pārameshvarye' is the basis for this word Indra. Indra can mean
Supreme Ishwara and not the devarāja here.
