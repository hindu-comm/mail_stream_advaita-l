If Shankara had Shiva in mind, he would have said so explicitly. But
Shankara does not bring in Shiva anywhere, and to bring in Shiva based on
presence of Uma, is nothing but speculation. And Shankara himself does not
consider Shiva to be Brahman because in BU 1.4.11, he considers Shiva as
created. And he authenticates the portions of the Mahabharata where Shiva
is treated as son of brahma. Thus, there is no way Shankara would consider
Shiva as Brahman.
