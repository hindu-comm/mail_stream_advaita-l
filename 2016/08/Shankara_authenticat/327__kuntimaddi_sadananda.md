PraNAMs - More I see the overflowing number of posts on the topic, more I agree with Ryan's assessment. 

It is a real wonder.

Namaskara
Having read through this thread, a question arises:
Why is this discussion taking place on a list dedicated to advaita?

Simple arithmetic will show that if there is a belief in a "shiva" and a
"vishnu", it is a belief in two.
Occasional interjections into this thread have tried to bring the
discussion back to advaita (e.g. Sri Venkatesh Murthy:
"You have not seen Vishnu or Siva and therefore you cannot confidently
say they are real. But one thing is real. Your Self is real. Try to
find out who you are and that is enough for realization.")

Believing that one is a vaishnava or shaiva indicates a lack of knowledge
of the आत्मन्
Not knowledge "about" the आत्मन् - for such knowledge is in the realm of
अन्तःकरण - the knowledge that अहम् ब्रह्मास्मि
Whilst this discussion is interesting, exciting and can lead to much
"mental exercise", does it belong on a list devoted to advaita?
Experience has shown that a belief that one is anything other than the self
colours the mind with dualism and roots one within samsAra.

Yours in Truth
Ryan
