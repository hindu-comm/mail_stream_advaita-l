If the Ishwara is Shiva, neuter gender cannot be used *at all*. It is
Indra who has used neuter gender when talking to Uma. The fact that
Indra uses neuter gender is significant. There is no way Indra could
have thought that Uma was associated with a male companion, since he
has used neuter gender to refer to the yaksha.


The use of masculine, Atm;a (mandukya 7th mantra),

Do you mean Shankara is referring to nirguNa brahman (ultimate truth)
when he uses sarvajna Ishwara? Then Shiva, as the husband of Uma, is
ruled out because nirguNa brahman is nobody's husband.


 In fact Shankara

But we are not talking about nirguNa brahman here. We are talking of
Shiva who is very much masculine.

Yes, masculine, feminine, neuter can all be used when referring to
nirguNa brahman, but here we are talking of Shiva and not nirguNa
brahman.

If Indra really thought of a masculine Ishwara, he would not have used
the neuter gender when asking about the yaksha to Uma. Indra would
have asked about a masculine yaksha. The fact that Indra asks about a
neutral Yaksha shows that Indra never thought this Ishwara was
masculine. Hence, there is no way this Ishwara could be Shiva. Indra's
very own question proves that.
