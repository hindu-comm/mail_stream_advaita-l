I don't think you have understood my point.

Indra did not use the neuter gender to refer to Uma's husband, he used it
to refer to Yaksha. Indra makes no reference to Uma's husband at all.

Only Shankara makes reference to Uma's husband as Sarvajna Ishvara, and not
when he is talking about Yaksha, when he is talking about Uma always being
associated with Him. And there is no gender confusion there at all.

Regards,
Venkatraghavan
