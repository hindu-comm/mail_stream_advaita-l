That is purely your assumption and it arises because you have not read
the Mbh. The Adi parvan itself says this Narayana is higher than
manifest and unmanifest.

The above is discredited by Shankara when he says Narayana is paramatman.

Nowhere does Shankara take Vishnu's name here.

I see that it is you who are interested in the chaff. That is why you
are quoting Shiva supremacy verses from the Mbh, which, as you
yourself acknowledged, do  not support advaita.
