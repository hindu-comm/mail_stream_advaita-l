Yes. This is missed by the member posting under the name 'Gayathri'.

The only logical conclusion, going by Shankara's sentence in the pada
bhashya is: umā, daughter of himavān, is forever associated with Shiva
only. We cannot speculate that she was  with someone else forever and
therefore knew who/what that yaksha is. That is what shankara is saying
there:'* because *she is eternally associated with omniscient Ishwara, she
knows' - this is the thinking of Indra.  There is no story, as far as I
know, that Uma learnt the Tattva from any other source.  On the other hand,
there are stories about Shiva conversing with Parvati on many topics.
