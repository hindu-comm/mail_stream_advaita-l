VOICE OF THE GURU
PUJYASRI CHANDRASEKHARENDRA SARASWATI SWAMI

HINDU DHARMA The Universal Way of Life 


Chapter 10 The One as Many

"If we were divided into two schools, the one insisting that the Saiva Puranas alone are authoritative among the Puranas and the other claiming that only the Vaisnava Puranas are to be relied upon, we would keep quarelling without ever being able to take a clear and dispassionate view of things. "The Truth is One. The wise speak of it by different names". There is no greater authority for us than this Vedic pronouncement. So all of us, without making any distinction between the Saiva and Vaisnaiva systems, must listen to the stories of all deities and be rewarded with freedom from worldly existence."

In this chapter, a more complete exposition is given on this.

Isn't it easier and more appropriate to take guidance from पर्मपरा/सम्प्रदाय as we try to understand शंकरचार्य's work?

Regards,
Sanju
