Come on, don't act too naive! It has always been your contention that "Sankara only accepts Vishnu as the Supreme
in his commentaries" right from the beginning! The problem with that allegation is that Sankara quotes from the
Jabala Upanishad which evidently praises the Rudram as THE mantra for attaining immortality!
