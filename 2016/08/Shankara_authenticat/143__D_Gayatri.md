If the BGB and BSB Ishwara is not referring to Shiva, one fails to
understand why the sarvajna Ishwara, who is Brahman should suddenly
start referring to Shiva in the KU.

Shankara himself says in his Brihadaranyaka Bhashya that the Ishwara,
is called by the name Narayana. So there is no indication from
Shankara anywhere else that the Sarvajna Ishwara is someone else.
Swami Gambhirananda translates the word Ishwara as God and not as
Shiva.

There is no indication in the BG, that the Vishwaroopa has anything to
do with Rudra. Yes, Rudra is sometimes treated as the deity of
destruction, there is no doubt about that. And Brahma is treated as
the deity of creation. There is no doubt about that too. But the
Mahabharata itself says that both these deities are nimitta mAtras at
the will of Aniruddha, who is Vishnu. And both are born from Narayana.
And Narayana is the one who is praised by all vedas. These are the
words of Krishna himself -

[These two, viz., Brahma and Rudra, are the foremost of all the
deities, having sprung respectively from the Propitiousness and the
Wrath (of Aniruddha). Acting according to Aniruddha's direction, these
two deities create and destroy. Although capable of granting boons
unto all creatures, they are, however, in the matter of the concerns
to which they attend (viz., Creation and Destruction), merely
instruments in the hands of Aniruddha.]


Now, a point regarding the Vishwaroopa darshana. To show that it has
nothing to do with Rudra, I will quote the Mahabharata itself. In the
Mahabharata, Krishna shows his Vishwraroopa again to Utanka at his
request and this Vishwaroopa is the same as what was seen by Arjuna.
The Mahabharata itself states it is a Vaishnava form (not a Shaiva
form, that one would expect, if it were Shiva). Here is the reference
from Mbh 14.54 -

[Gratified with him, the holy one then showed Utanka that eternal
Vaishnava form which Dhananjaya of great intelligence had seen.]

Not sure what you are trying to prove. Narayana is supreme Atman
according to Shankara and is hence uncreated.

No, all their functions are possible due to brahman only. It is due to
brahman that everyone is able to function. Since you have
misunderstood me, I will skip the rest of your message.
