The term 'Ishvara' is quite popular only with Shiva. Even in the MB this
name occurs for Shiva alone. Also, anyone with a basic exposure to our
scriptures will know without tutoring that it is with Shiva that Uma
resides eternally.  No one need to speculate on this.

Shankara considers Shiva as Brahman in the Prshnopanishat bhashya.  It is
no speculation there. He clearly says, even when the mantra is silent that
it is as Rudra Brahman annihilates and as sowmya  (vishn) protects. Anyone
with basic exposure knows that the trimurtis have specific functions.

Further, on your own logic, since the Br.up.1.4.11 is about the 'creation '
of the stated deities and etc. ityevamādīni as Shankara agrees, and also
with the prasiddhi that Shankara talks of, the creation of Vishnu is
authenticated by Shankara, even if Shankara expressly does not say so (just
as you held that even if Shankara expressly does not cite the verse, by
just citing some portions of that section, he authenticates the entire
section)   as Shankara's prasiddhi is very well known for those who have
done the Krishna yajur veda adhyayana.

Also, since you have cited from the bloggers approvingly, by your own
logic, you authenticate, following them, the VSN bhashya as that of
Shankara. There Shankara holds, on the Shiva purana pramana, that Rudra,
Shiva, is the Supreme Cause. Thereby Shankara authenticates that purana.
Also, in that bhashya Shankara, for the name 'soma' alternatively gives:
with Umā, Shiva. It is exactly this way that Shankara refers to her in the
Kenopanishat bhashya. So, by your own logic, Rudra is Brahman according to
Shankara.

Since the bloggers approvingly cite Madhva, they also authenticate the
Shiva sahasra nama as genuine, following Madhvas.

Finally, you will never be able to prove that Rudra in the pranshna bhashya
is any other than Shiva.
