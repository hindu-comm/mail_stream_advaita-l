By quoting the MB Shankara has authenticated Rudra-Narayana abheda. And the
trimurti abheda contained in the Harivamsha too. By quoting the Shve.up and
the Jabalopanishat Shankara has held Rudra to be Brahman in the
Prashnopanishat. None can succeed in making Shankara and Veda Vyasa bigots.
Only those who come from vaishnava background, as admitted by themselves,
can attempt to do this but will utterly fail.
