Shankara has said Parameshwara can take any for to bless the aspirant. That
is what is meant there.

 NB, being nishkriya, cannot take any avatAra. So, the contention that

With Maya as upadhi it can do all that. Shankara has said that too.

So what? The karma kanda, for example is not conveying advaitic message.
Yet Shankara has established an ekavākyatā with it in the BUB and all other
bhashyas. That does not mean he treats it as chaff. Without that grain it
is impossible to attain advaita, as per shankara.

He has already encapsulated this in the purvapaksha 'many purushas or one?'
the non-advaitic schools have treated this part as an indictment of
advaita.

Sampradayavit Sayana's bhashya does not approve this. Other's views are to
be rejected as those of murkha as per Shankaracharya's teaching in the BGB.

The BU. 1.4.11 says Rudra-pashupathi is a created entity.

This mantra admits Vishnu as a created entity. This 'Rudra' is Vishnu, as
vaishnavas hold the name Rudra to mean vishnu.

They are arthavadas. The MB says prajapati and Vishnu are born of Rudra
