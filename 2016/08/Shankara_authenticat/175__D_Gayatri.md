Nor does Shankara suggest that Shiva is brahman anywhere in his
bhAshyas whereas he says explicitly that Shiva is created in his
bhashya on BU (going around in circles again, aren't we?)

Here, we should look at what bhagavatpAda says and he says Narayana is
uncreated paramAtman. Rest all, I should say are your personal
conclusions.
