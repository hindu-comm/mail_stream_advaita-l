Please pardon me, 
but it's strange to say that a story
that Vaishnavas from Tulasidas
to Periyavaccan Pillai to 
the Gaudiya Acaryas have 
praised as one of the finest 
examples of Saranagati is a mere
interpolation. Here, I think 
Bhakti and respect to such great
Bhagavatas should take precedence
over such pedantry, however 
well reasoned and eloquent ...
