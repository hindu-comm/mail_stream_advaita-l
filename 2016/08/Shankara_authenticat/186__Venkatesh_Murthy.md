In the Aitareya Bhashya -
ऐतरेयोपनिषद्भाष्यम् । प्रथमः अध्यायः । तृतीयः खण्डः । मन्त्रः १४ - भाष्यम्

तस्मादिदन्द्रो नामेदन्द्रो ह वै नाम तमिदन्द्रं सन्तमिन्द्र इत्याचक्षते
परोक्षेण । परोक्षप्रिया इव हि देवाः परोक्षप्रिया इव हि देवाः ॥ १४ ॥
इति तृतीयः खण्डः ॥
भाष्यम्
यस्मादिदमित्येव यत्साक्षादपरोक्षाद्ब्रह्म सर्वान्तरमपश्यत् न परोक्षेण,
तस्मात् इदं पश्यतीति इदन्द्रो नाम परमात्मा । इदन्द्रो ह वै नाम
प्रसिद्धो लोके ईश्वरः । तम् एवम् इदन्द्रं सन्तम् इन्द्र इति परोक्षेण
परोक्षाभिधानेन आचक्षते ब्रह्मविदः संव्यवहारार्थं
पूज्यतमत्वात्प्रत्यक्षनामग्रहणभयात् । तथा हि परोक्षप्रियाः
परोक्षनामग्रहणप्रिया इव एव हि यस्मात् देवाः । ***** किमुत सर्वदेवानामपि देवो
महेश्वरः**** । द्विर्वचनं प्रकृताध्यायपरिसमाप्त्यर्थम् ॥


Here Adi Sankara has said Maheshvara is the God of all gods. We
usually use Mahesha and Maheshvara for Siva only like Brahma, Vishnu
and Maheshvara.
Famous Sloka is also there to prove it.

Gurur Brahma Gurur Vishnuh Gurur Devo Maheshvarah

In some other places he has praised Vishnu or Narayana also as the
Supreme. Therefore we must conclude he accepted Hari-Hara Abheda only.
He did not see difference between them.
