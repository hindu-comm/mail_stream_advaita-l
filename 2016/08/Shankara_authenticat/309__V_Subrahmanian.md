There is no such rule that there should be such continuity. The chapters of
the BG or the BS are themselves open to such a defect. It is only
commentators that take the pain to show the continuity.

The very question implies that: Japa of what leads to immortality? Atman is
the Immortal one.

What rule is there that Shankara should quote all the mantras in an
upanishad? That Shankara has quoted three mantras that too at different
places in the bhashyam shows that he has picked only those that are needed
for him. If mantra 3 is not needed for him to be cited, is that a defect?

Where is the rule that all the chapters/sections in a text should be of the
same size? On the above logic, the chapters 12, 14 and 15 of the BG are to
be held interpolations. Shankara holds the ch.15 to be the essence of the
entire vedanta shastra. So, the mantra 3  in JU is the essence of the
entire vedanta shastra since it is about the means to moksha.
