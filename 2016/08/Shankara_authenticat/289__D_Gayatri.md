Shri Shashi,

You don't need to worry about the harivamsa story about Sudarshana chakra.
The critical edition of Mahabharata itself has a story about the chakra. In
the Adi parvan, Agni requests help from Krishna and Arjuna for protecting
him from Indra and other gods while he devours the khandava forest. Agni
asks varuNa to give Krishna and Arjuna, weapons that match their valor.
varuNa gives the chakra to Agni, who then presents it to Krishna. Of
course, Arjuna also gets his own weapons.
