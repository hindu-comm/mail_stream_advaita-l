Advaitins give importance to vyavahAra also. Just because rice and
stones are both superimposed on brahman and are both mithya, it does
not mean that one can eat stones instead of rice.

Check Shankara's bhAshya on BSB 3.2.17. Narayana shows his Vishwaroopa
to Narada and implies that it is due to mAyA that Narada is seeing Him
like that.

Also, check out bhagavatpAda's interpretation for neti neti in BU. If
brahman is forever guNapUrNa, then neti neti is not the best
description of brahman at all. But the BU itself says this is the best
description. So brahman is truly nirvishesha.

When He is knowing the world with all its jIvas and their karmas, the
knowing is illusory because the world is also illusory.

Even that granting the knowledge and destruction of avidya are equally
mithya! Acharya GaudapAda says that there is no bondage, no one
seeking liberation, nothing has been ever created etc.

However, none of this reduces the importance of vyavahAra, as long as
one is not a mukta. Advaitins still work for a living, eat normal food
and take care of their families in day to day life.
