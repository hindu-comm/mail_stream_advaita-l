I would also say the same to you. I am not interested in your personal
opinion about the BUB.  I am interested only in what Shankara says.

The Upanishad did not suggest that Himavan's daughter is what is meant by
Uma in that name for Narasimha.  There may be a name similar to that for
Lakshmi.  That is beside the point.  We are interested only the Himavan's
daughter uma.

In fact, the words Rudra and Pashupathy are also applied by vaishnavas to
Vishnu and a commentary is also given. By that, the BU creation of Rudra,
as pashupathy, is applicable to Vishnu alone and nothing in the BU
upanishad says that Vishnu is the uncreated one.   I have seen this bigoted
attitude: Whenever Rudra is praised, it is actually Vishnu is praised.
Whenever Rudra is created or born, it is Shiva.  Surely, advaitins have no
such compulsions.
