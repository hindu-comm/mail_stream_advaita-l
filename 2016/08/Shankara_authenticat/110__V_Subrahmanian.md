Yes, it has been made clear many times before too that this article does
not interest you.  The Narayana that Shankara is confirming as the Supreme
Atman is the nirguna brahman, beyond avyakta. Just because you do not take
the article seriously, the facts stated therein do not go away. It no way
contradicts the views of Shankara. In the Prashnopaniishat bhashya Shankara
has stated Rudra is the world-annihilating entity. If your interest lay
with Shankara's Advaita philosophy, why take up the issue of Narayana? It
would be best to confine with the Advaita tattva which is divorced from any
deity.
