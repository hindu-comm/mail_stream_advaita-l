Only because the implications are artificially imposed does the problem
arise. A student of vedanta reading the bhashya will not lose anything if
that information is not provided. That is why Shankara does not care to
give that. For Shankara the MB is important only because Vyasa is the
author and not because of anything else.

The argument that the that mantra is about the creation of Rudra is
discredited by several shrutis including the Prashna, Shvetashvara,
Kaivalya, Jabala, Atharva shira, etc.
