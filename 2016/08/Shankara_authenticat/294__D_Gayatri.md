We have already seen that the JU does not convey the supremacy of
Shiva in any way. The Shvet Up, will be taken up shortly. Shankara
never quotes any abheda verses in his authentic bhAshyas like BSB. And
in Prashna upanishad, Shankara is praising prANa (brahman) itself as
the destroyer and not Umapati. In the BSB he says that whenever words
like prana or Akasa are used as the supreme cause, they should be
taken to mean brahman and not anything else.
