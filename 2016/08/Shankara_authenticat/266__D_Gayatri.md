WIth Maya as upadhi, it becomes Ishwara and not NB! That means it is
our very own popular Narayana.

This is completely irrelevant to the discussion.

I dont worry about the non-advaitic schools.

But Shankara's own quotes praising the supremacy of Vishnu are in
perfect harmony with that reading of RV. Hence that reading of RV
verse, as translated by Ralph Griffith is perfectly in tune with
sampradaya.

Nowhere does Shankara bring in Vishnu here.

They are not mere arthavadas, but show Rudra as born from brahma. Same
is mentioned in Mbh. By quoting this portion, Shankara authenticates
this.
