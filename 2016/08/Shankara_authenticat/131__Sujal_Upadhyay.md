another verse from skambha sUkta

Verse – 19: Atharva Veda (X:8:19)

“satyénordhvás tapati bráhmaṇārvā́ṅ ví paśyati |
prāṇéna tiryáṅ prā́ṇati yásmin jyeṣṭhám ádhi śritám ||”19
“By truth he blazes up aloft by Brahma, he looks down below: He breathes
obliquely with his breath, he on whom what is highest rests”.

"To disconnect from the self and to become Aware of anything else is
nothing but unhappiness" - Bhagawan Ramana Maharshi

He who has faith has all
He who lacks faith, lacks all
It is the faith int he name of lord that works wonders
FAITH IS LIFE, DOUBT IS DEATH - Sri Ramakrishna
