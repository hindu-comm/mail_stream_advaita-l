Above position is quite valid and quite vEdic.

We have shruti pramANa for that -- Rig vEda 7.40.5 is quite clear on this
topic when it says ;

asya devasya mILhuSo vayA viSNoreSasya
prabhRthe havirbhiH vide hi rudro rudriyaM mahitvaM yAsiSTaM
vartirashvinAvirAvat

It clearly establishes the fact that Rudra's power is due to Vishnu. Please
note interesting part here that shruti uses "vishNu" shabda and not
nArayaNa shabda. This refutes other member's argument that Narayana is
different from "Vishnu" and trimUrthi's power is from nAryaNa.
