Gayatri ji ,
«This is what I do not understand. When Shiva is talked of as supreme and
Vishnu is denigrated, it does not bother you. Why does it bother you so
much if the opposite point of view is presented»

Where and by whom was Vishnu denigrated on this forum? If anyone did that,
they're wrong.  If you are angry about that, point out that the denigration
is unacceptable and move on.

Your approach to denigrate and pull down Shiva, deny his Ishvaravatva,
attribute that denial to Shankaracharya etc. is counter productive - two
wrongs don't make a right.

If somebody did say Shiva was supreme, as long as they didn't denigrate
Vishnu, that is OK. You also may call Vishnu supreme, as long as you don't
disparage Shiva.

This is directed to everyone - Can we please move on.

Regards,
Venkatraghavan
