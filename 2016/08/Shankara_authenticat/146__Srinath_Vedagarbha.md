This kind of nirNaya (on purANa/vEda vAkyas) itself must be conveyed by
some pramANa in order to be true, for at the end of day all we speak must
be be based on pramANas. There is no such evidence present.

First I doubt it is part of so called critical edition. Even if it is,
since it contradict Rig. Veda, its prAmANya ceases to be valid  Do not
forget apourusheya vEda has prabala pramANya over pourusheys works.
