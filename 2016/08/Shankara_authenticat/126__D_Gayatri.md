Alright, you have a point. So I will explain why you can't compare birth of
Rudra from Prajapati to that of Ishwara taking an incarnation. This is
because, the baby Rudra, in the satapatha brahmana episode, cries that he
is not free from sins. Certainly, this is not the mark of Ishwara, since
Ishwara is always free from sins.

Regards
Gayatri
