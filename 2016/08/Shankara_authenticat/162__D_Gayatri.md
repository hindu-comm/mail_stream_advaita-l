I am saying, if Indra thought that the companion of Uma who was
sarvajna Ishwara, was a male (being her *husband*), then he would not
have used neuter gender to refer to the sarvajna Ishwara. I also
invite you to check the translation of Swami Gambhirananda. He uses
the neutral word "God" everywhere in this context for Ishwara and does
not interpret it as Shiva. So your assumption that Ishwara here refers
to Shiva is no more than speculation.

Let me point out that yaksha can be used both in neuter and masculine gender.

Having said that, consider the following -

1. ayam AtmA brahma - here Atman is masculine and brahman is neuter
but there is no problem with Atman referring to brahman.

2. Mohini is Vishnu - here Mohini is feminine and Vishnu is masculine,
but there is no problem with Mohini referring to Vishnu.

3. Brihannala is Arjuna - here Brihannala is (I think) feminine and
Arjuna is masculine, but there is no problem with Brihannala referring
to Vishnu

Hence there is no problem with the word yaksha referring to the word
Ishwara, even if the former is used in neuter gender.
