Well, if you want to believe that chanting Rudram leads to immortality,
then feel free to believe it. Some of my elders have been chanting rudram
right from their childhood. They are old now and still chant rudram. I
respect them but objectively speaking, I am yet to see them become
immortal. The position of bhagavatpAda is clear. Only jnAna leads to
moksha.

As for Shankara's position on Shiva's birth from brahman, I have already
quoted the BU 1.4.11. That leads to the natural conclusion that Shankara
accepted only Vishnu as Brahman.
