I meant when used as 'Ishvara uvācha'. This occurs in the MB. The instances
in the BSB and BGB are not referring to Shiva. But the Kenopanishat bhashya
is quite unique. The context too.

With whom does Umā, the daughter of Himavān, reside eternally, according to
you?  Only because Shankara is no vaishnavaite either that he does not
bring in Vishnu in the Kena bhashya.

Yes, that is what even I am saying: It is one Brahman that takes the form
of the trimurtis to perform those three key cosmic functions. Those names
of the trimurtis is also very popular. Why should Shankara bring in the
name Rudra there even though the mantra does not say so? He sees the word
veeryena samharan there and associates Rudra with that function.

इन्द्रस्त्वं प्राण तेजसा रुद्रोऽसि परिरक्षिता ।
त्वमन्तरिक्षे चरसि सूर्यस्त्वं ज्योतिषां पतिः ॥ ९ ॥
भाष्यम्
किंच, इन्द्रः परमेश्वरः त्वं हे प्राण, तेजसा वीर्येण रुद्रोऽसि संहरन् जगत्
। स्थितौ च परि समन्तात् रक्षिता पालयिता ; परिरक्षिता त्वमेव जगतः सौम्येन रूपेण
। त्वम् अन्तरिक्षे अजस्रं चरसि उदयास्तमयाभ्यां सूर्यः त्वमेव च सर्वेषां
ज्योतिषां पतिः ॥
And you alone protect, says Shankara, adding the word saumyena, from the
word parirakshitā, which is also quite well known that it is Vishnu he has
in mind.   The commentator adds: in the form of Vishnu, etc.

Rudra is associated with destruction and in the BG 11 th ch. Krishna says:
I am kāla, out to destroy the creation.  And I have shown that the same
Krishna says in the MB that it is Rudra, known as Kāla, as distinct from
himself, that slayed all those who lost their lives in the war. The prashna
bhashya is quite plain, One entity taking various forms to perform the
cosmic functions.

Yes, that Narayana, that is beyond avyakta, that, in association with maya
takes various forms to perform various functions. Shankara has also stated
in that place itself that it is Kshetrajna, nirguna, where the avyakta
resolves into.

The Supreme Atman is nirguna brahman in Advaita. Narayana is beyond
avyakta. So, the deity Rudra if as a pati of a group is created, by the
power of 'etc.' of the bhashya, the others who are left unlisted too who
are patis of any group, are deemed to have been created. This conclusion is
inescapable for anyone who follows Shankara's bhashya there.

Let me point out to you that by your above logic, the other entities listed
in the Prashna mantra like Indra and surya are also Brahman, uncreated.
Just because the BU 1.4.11 says Rudra is created you do not want to include
*that* Rudra in the prashna bhashya.  See the below details of the 1.4.11
BU:

Indra, varuna, soma, parjanya, yama, mrtyu and Ishāna are listed along with
Rudra and the unlisted etc. iti, which Shankara takes iti evamādīni, others
such as these.

Now the prashna mantra has Indra and Surya are there specifically named and
in the next mantra parjanya is there. From this list indra and parjanya are
in the BU mantra, as ones created.  Now, going by your logic, indra and
parjanya are also to be deemed Brahman, the uncreated and Rudra in the
bhashya is uncreated Brahman, distinct from the created pashupati of the
BU!!  Where is a Rudra well known as distinct from the Rudra pashupati,
unless it is one of the 11?
