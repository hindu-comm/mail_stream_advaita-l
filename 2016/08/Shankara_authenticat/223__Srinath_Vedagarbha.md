That exactly is the question -- why give importance even after you know
that it is the avidyA druShti ?

You cannot eat so because they are not mithya. The difference between them
is indeed a reality.

I am asking for pramANas, instead you are showing pouruShEya logic on
shruti's nEti nEti. It is sahavakASha and can yiled to alternate
interpretation. You do not have any direct niravakASha pramANas to convey
illusory nature of Vishnu.

The why did you invoke the non-existing difference by saying " Vishnu,
devoid of His Ishwaratva is NB and I, devoid of my jIvatva am NB.
Difference is that he knows and I don't know" ?

Is it false then often quoted vachana in advaitic circles that without
Ishwara prasAda advaita vAsana is not possible?

Then again Acharya GaudapAda did not argue for supremacy of one dEvata over
other neither. It is you have a quite self contradictory position.

This stand "as long as one is not mukta" is real or itself a mithya?

Many people think this vyavahAra and paaramartha are two avasthas in a
liner time scale which comes one after the other. It is not correct. Do not
forget the nature of mithya as defined is something which was/is not there
in all three periods of time. It is not that vyavahAra was there once and
not there afterwords, kind of understanding.
