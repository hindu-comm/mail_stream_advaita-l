For an academician let that part not be an interpolation.  For a Vedantin
 Shanakara only the Advaitic message is relevant. That alone is
authenticated by him in the MB and not the other peripheral things. So,
there is no merit in saying that Shankara authenticates Shiva as son
of.....

The mantra itself says 'iti' which Shankara comments as īti evamādīni'
=.'and other such cases ' showing that the list is not exhaustive. That is
why Shankara says 'it is well known.' Where is it well known? in the Yajur
Veda samhita.

that N as the resident of vaikuntha, etc. For Shankara 'Parameshwara' can
take any illusory form out of will to bless an aspirant.' Narayana is a
deity, is one such form. And if it is a form then it is anātmā and abrahma
for Shankara .  So, for Shankara the Supreme Brahman is Nirguna only which
alone can be identified as one's self.
