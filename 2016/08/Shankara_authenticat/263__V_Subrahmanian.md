Shankara quotes from that portion not because Vishnu is superior but
because those portions are convenient for Shankara to teach the Advaitic
Nirguna Brahman. For Shankara that Narayana is beyond avyakta and therefore
Nirguna. That is why he cites from those poritons.

This is not because he does not consider Shiva as superior but because
those portions may not be conveying the advaitic message Shankara looked
for.

The Rg Veda, the Brihadaranyaka, the Atharvashira and other scriptures
validate the fact of Vishnu being a created deity
