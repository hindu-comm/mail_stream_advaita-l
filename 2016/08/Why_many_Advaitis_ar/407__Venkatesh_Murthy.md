Namaste

I read somewhere Kanchi Swamiji gave explanation why many Advaitis are
Shaiva supporting. In Adi Sankara's time Advaitis were from different
backgrounds like Shaiva, Vaishnava, Sakta, Saura and Ganapatya. He
brought all different groups into Advaita. Main groups were Saiva and
Vaishnava because other groups had less followers. But Vaishnava
Acharyas like Ramanuja and Madhva came and took away majority of
Vaishnava Advaitis and converted them non Advaiti Vaishnavas like
Srivaishnavas and Dvaitis.

Remaining Advaitis had mainly Shaiva followers. Therefore today most
of Advaitis are supporting Saivas and Supremacy of Siva. But because
they are Advaitis they will accept Abheda of Vishnu and Siva. They
cannot and will not say Vishnu is inferior like Saivas.
