The BG 2.16 says about 'Existence': na abhāvo vidyate sataḥ [Existence will
never go out of existence.] That which exists can never go out of
existence. If X is admitted to no longer exist, then its former existence
is in question. If māyā/ajñāna/avidyā were admitted to exist at any time in
the past and present but not in future, then its earlier existence is in
question. Why? For the reason that it does not satisfy the above definition
of existence.  Since it is known to cease to exist upon the dawn of
knowledge, it is deemed to be non-existent in all three periods of time. It
only appeared to exist but did not really exist. Had it really existed,
then, like Brahman, it should be existing for ever.

Then how do you prove there exists only jgnana (Brahman),in all three kalas
