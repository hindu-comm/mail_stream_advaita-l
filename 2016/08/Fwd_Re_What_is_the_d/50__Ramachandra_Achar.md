Yes, subbu sir ,
           I accept because of agnana whatever we see is false,and that
object doesn't exist in all three "kaalas",
For example snake seen on rope,person seen on dream......

I too accept Maya ,which is due to agnana is false and doesn't exist in
three  folds of time.

But we have accept the existence of agnana in past and present.
For example in dream whatever we see maybe false and doesn't exist.....
But we have to accept the existence of dream in past and present...
Similarly, agnana of seeing snake in rope  maybe false....
But that agnana,which makes me to see snake in rope is not false...it is
true and 100% exists...otherwise we can't account for this world....
So,there exist two things agnana and jgnana (brahman)......atleast at past
and present ,maybe at features only jgnana continues to exit....

Then how do you prove there exists only jgnana (Brahman),in all three kalas
and agnana doesn't exist in all three folds of time?
