Ok, I accept what ever we see in dream is false,when we wake up .....But i
was in dream ,is true right?
Seeing snake in rope is illusion,when we come to know that it is rope
only...but that illusion exists right ,at least untill we get brahma jgnana?

There exists at least two things untill we get brahma jgnana 1)jgnana
(brahman) 2)agnana
When we get brahma jgnana agnana sizes to exist......

I too accept the effect of agnana (maya ) is false and don't exist in all
three kaala...
but how do you prove that only jgnana exists in all three kaala and agnana
don't even exists in all three kaala
