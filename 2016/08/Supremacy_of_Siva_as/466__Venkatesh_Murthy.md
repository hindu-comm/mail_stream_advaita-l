Yo vedadau svara proktah vedante ca pratisthitaha

tasya prakriti linasya yah parahssa mahesvaraha

The which is described as the primal sound (om) in the beginning ofthe
vedas, has been fully established as the supreme truth at the end of
the Vedas, the Upanishads . The one who realizes that Supreme
Principle is beyond the pale of those totally immersed in physical
realities. Indeed, He is none other than the supreme Lord Maheshwara.
