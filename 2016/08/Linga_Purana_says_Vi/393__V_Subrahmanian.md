This story is referenced in the Harivamśa too which I presented here
recently. Sridhara Swamin has also referred to this in his commentary to
the Vishnu puranam. While Veda Vyasa has no partiality towards Hari or
Hara, it is unfortunate that those who claim to be followers of Veda Vyasa
have ideas that he  never espoused.
