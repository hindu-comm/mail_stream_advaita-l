What samskAra does Atma have?  Why identify with paricChinna anAtma vastu
like samskAra or desha / kAla when one should remind oneself to identify
with consciousness instead?

One can have pride in one's culture, but when that pride looks down on
someone else is only an obstacle to Atma vidyA. chAndAl'ostu sa tu
dvijo'stu gururityeShA manIShA mama.
