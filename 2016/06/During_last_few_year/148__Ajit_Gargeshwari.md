During last few years of life, a jiJNaasu (जिञासु) should contemplate on Narayana. One who has the habit of Japa by inhaling will say the name of Narayana and while exhaling will say the name of Narayana. What else is needed. Sarva dharma Parityajay... Or as Shankara himself has said Bhaja Govinda Bhaja Govinda.....

Regards
Ajit Gargeshwari

 Death can come at any time. Age slowly pushes one towards
