Namaste

We cannot take only one word from Sankara Bhashya and worry about it.
Kindly see GK 1 - 13 and Sankara Bhashya below. Here Adi Sankara is
agreeing there is a difference between Prajna and Turya. In Prajna
there is Bija Nidra. That is not there in Turya. Adi Sankara is
clearing doubt if Sushupti and Turya are the same.

द्वैतस्याग्रहणं तुल्यमुभयोः प्राज्ञतुर्ययोः ।
बीजनिद्रायुतः प्राज्ञः सा च तुर्ये न विद्यते ॥ १३ ॥
भाष्यम्
निमित्तान्तरप्राप्ताशङ्कानिवृत्त्यर्थोऽयं श्लोकः — कथं द्वैताग्रहणस्य
तुल्यत्वे कारणबद्धत्वं प्राज्ञस्यैव, न तुरीयस्येति प्राप्ता आशङ्का
निवर्त्यते ; यस्मात् बीजनिद्रायुतः, तत्त्वाप्रतिबोधो निद्रा ; सैव च
विशेषप्रतिबोधप्रसवस्य बीजम् ; सा बीजनिद्रा ; तया युतः प्राज्ञः ।
सदासर्वदृक्स्वभावत्वात्तत्त्वाप्रतिबोधलक्षणा बीजनिद्रा तुर्ये न
विद्यते ; अतो न कारणबन्धस्तस्मिन्नित्यभिप्रायः ॥
