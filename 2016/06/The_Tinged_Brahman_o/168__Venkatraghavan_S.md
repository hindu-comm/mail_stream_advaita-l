Namaste Sri Subbuji,

Great, I remember the discussion in relation to आगन्तुकत्वं of अविद्या.

From Anandagiri AchArya's clarification, it appears that on similar lines,
the अभाव of अविद्या in सुषुप्ति here refers to its अनभिव्यक्तं. Presumably
here by अविद्या, अध्यास is being referred to.

Regards,
Venkatraghavan
