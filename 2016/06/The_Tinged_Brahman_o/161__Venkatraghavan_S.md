Thank you to Sri Ravi Kiran and Sri Venkatesh,

Prakriya bheda could be an acceptable reason. However, before we fall back
to the standard explanation for any perceived contradiction, I would like
to see if anyone has explored this previously and has alternative
explanations.

RE Sri Venkatesh's explanation that vikshepa is absent but AvaraNa is
present in deep sleep - to describe the avidyA (whose absence in deep sleep
AchArya talks about), the adjective he uses is
"अन्यत्वप्रत्युपस्थापकहेतोरविद्याया" अभावात् - the absence of that (factor
which is) the cause for the superimposition of other objects.

So here he is not talking about the absence of the projection, but the
absence of the cause (hetu) of the projection, which points to AvaraNa, not
vikshepa in my opinion. The translation by Swami Madhavananda doesn't seem
to include the word "hetu" in the bhAshya.

Regards,
Venkatraghavan
