Namaste

सुषुप्ते तु विक्षेपमात्रं निवृत्तम् तत्संस्कारोऽग्रहणं च नैव निवृत्ते
अन्यथा न तुरीयाद् भिद्येत विक्षेपमात्राभावात्तु ब्रह्मप्राप्त्यभिधानम्

Brahma Siddhi Kara Mandana Mishra has said this. He is the first one
to deny Vikshepa in Sushupti. Others have followed him. If Avarana
Sakti is also not there in Sushupti it will become just like Turiya.
That is not correct because nobody thinks he gets Moksha in deep
sleep. Why sometimes Sushupti is spoken as Brahma Prapti? Because
there is no Vikshepa in it. That is all. It does not mean it is
actually Brahma Prapti.
