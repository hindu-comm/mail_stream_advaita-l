Since either the presence or absence of ignorance in deep sleep state
cannot be established ( through reasoning based on one's own deep sleep
experience), I would think, both are different prakriyas (prakriya bedha)
used.

We could see many places in bhAshya (Chandogya, Brihadaranyaka, Brahma
Sutra), where deep sleep is taken as drustAntha for jIva ekibavanam,
samprasAda, svapiti etc , whereas in Mandukya, it is mentioned differently
