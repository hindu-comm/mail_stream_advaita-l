> यत आत्मकामम् — आत्मैव कामाः यस्मिन् रूपे, अन्यत्र प्रविभक्ता इव अन्यत्वेन
> काम्यमानाः यथा जाग्रत्स्वप्नयोः, तस्य आत्मैव
> अन्यत्वप्रत्युपस्थापकहेतोरविद्याया अभावात्

> The translation from Swami Madhavananda: "Because all objects of desire are
> but the self in this form. In states other than that of profound sleep,
> i.e. in the waking and dreaming states, things are separated as it were,
> from the self and desired as such. But to one who is fast asleep, they
> become the self, since there is no ignorance to project the idea of
> difference."
>
> The last bit is particularly problematic, because it seems to say that
> there is no ignorance in deep sleep state, and prima facie, seems to rule
> out the presence of  kAraNa sharIra (of the nature of ignorance) in deep
> sleep.>>,
