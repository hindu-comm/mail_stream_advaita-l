Namaste Sri Venkatraghavan Ji,



Dasgupta, in his book A History of Indian Philosophy , quotes the following
verse by PrakAshAnanda



वेदान्तसारसर्वस्वम् अज्ञेयम् अधुनातनैयः ।

 अशेषेण मयोक्तम् तत् पुरुषोत्तम यत्नतः  ॥



(vedāntasārasarvasvam ajñeyam adhunātanaiyaḥ ।

 aśeṣeṇa mayoktam tat puruṣottama yatnataḥ  ॥).



The gist of it as given by Dasgupta is as follows.



Quote    << The essence of the Vedanta as teached by him is unknown to his
contemporaries and that it was he who thoroughly expounded this doctrine of
philosophy  >>.  Unquote



Dasgupta attributes this to PrakAshAnanda , but not clear from which work
of his.



Regards
