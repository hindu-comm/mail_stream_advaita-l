Just to clarify the basic concept of prAtibhAsika satya, which seems to
be necessary these days!

The Vedaanta paribhaashhaa of dharmaraaja adhvarin defines these
   three orders of reality (satya):

   yadvaa trividhaM sattvaM -- paaramaarthikasattvaM brahmaNaH,
   vyaavahaarikaM sattvamaakaashaadeH, praatibhaasikaM sattvaM
   shuktirajataadeH |

   The reality of Brahman is pAramArthika satya, the reality
   of the objective world, which includes space etc., is vyAvahArika
   satya, and the illusory appearance of silver in nacre (oyster-shell)
   is  prAtibhAsika satya.

Note the example of shukti-rajata which is also cited by PrakAshAnanda
while describing the world (which I quoted earlier below).

Contribution of PrakAshAnanda: The so called "objective world" is not
vyAvahArika satya but only prAtibhAsika satya. In fact, there is no such a
thing called vyAvahArika satya in his DSV/EJV system.
