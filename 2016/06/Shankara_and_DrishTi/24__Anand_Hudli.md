 >* status. According to PrkAshAnanda Creation is just a fictitious
nonentity, *>* “tuccha”, as mentioned in “ A history of Indian Philosophy “
by Sri *>* Surendranath Dasgupta. Infact it is indeed like a Hare’s Horn
only. Sri *>* Dasgupta also presents the reasons which prompted
PrakAshAnanda to adopt *>* such an extreme position. He however also takes
care to specifically state *>* that PrakAshAnanda is an advaitin only !!*

Where exactly does Dasgupta say that according to PrakAshAnanda creation is
a fictitious entity? Please also note that Dasgupta is not necessarily
correct in interpreting Advaita, and his views are more academically
oriented as opposed to one who has traditionally studied advaita or one who
has an exclusive interest (read shraddhA) in advaita.
