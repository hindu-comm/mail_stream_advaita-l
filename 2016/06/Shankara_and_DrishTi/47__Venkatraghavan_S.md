Namaste Sri Chandramouli ji,

I don't know where he is saying creation is tuccha, but I suspect he means
that independent of the observer, the observed is tuccha.

I have a very different understanding of jnAnadhyAsa/arthAdhyAsa, but let's
leave that aside, as its not central to the topic.

On khyAti, please provide the Sanskrit quote - let us see what term he uses
that is being translated as "illusory".

Regards,
Venkatraghavan
