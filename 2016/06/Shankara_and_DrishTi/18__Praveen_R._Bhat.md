Namaste Anandji,

Thanks for mentioning an important point about the experience of
continuity. I'd just like to share my thoughts somewhat building on your
reply.

I am assuming that you make this statement *when compared to SDV*, else for
that matter, advaita vision itself is counter-intuitive against the
commonsense view of the world. :)

This अभिज्ञा that brings the feeling of continuity exists for the dreamer
also. The dreamer thinks that he is living in a continuous life of some
kind, he doesn't doubt the dream creation. As such, the waker's अभिज्ञा is
no different to the dreamer's. I think it can be seen that a dream is a
like an entire life. Across lives, the waker doesn't see continuity, so too
the dreamer doesn't see continuity across dreams. We tend to apply the
waking rules, the only ones we somewhat know through some kind of logic, to
the dream world. For example, we assume that the world is created with a
meticulous order that is followed through. However, the dream world is
spontaneously created still without the dreamer doubting as to how the
world was created and what rules are followed. The dreamer sees some logic
in the creation (if at all he thinks about it) and sees continuity and
order.
