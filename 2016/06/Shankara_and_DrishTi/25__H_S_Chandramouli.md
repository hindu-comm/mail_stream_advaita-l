I only intended to mean  that Dasgupta has also interpreted it the same way
as I had done earlier on my own . I am not depending on any endorsement by
Dasgupta for the correctness of my understanding. Nor am I suggesting that
he is an authority on the subject. I have presented earlier the reasons for
my understanding based on the contents of the work by Prakashananda.  I
have also presented in support of my understanding what is mentioned in
Sidhantaleshasamgraha about the versions of DSV. I have also mentioned that
Dasgupta has also presented what in his view are the reasons which prompted
PrakAshAnanda to take such an extreme view on the issue. I have given
reference to where Dasgupta has made the statements I have referred. It is
certainly open for anyone to come to his own conclusions.

Regards
