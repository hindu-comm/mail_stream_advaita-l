It is very interesting to note what the author Sri PrakashAnanda  says
about “khyati” itself..



Quote from Sidhantamuktavali (pp 171)



<< Then ( rejoins the pupil ) this is simply a teaching of asatkhyAti under
another guise. Not so, says the guru ; for in our view the khyAti
(perception) also is illusory, which the ChArvAka or holder of asatkhyAti
will not admit ( as he holds that the khyAti is real ) >>.
