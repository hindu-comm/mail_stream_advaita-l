Please read Gita BhAshya for 4.24 - आत्मव्यतिरेकेणअभावंपश्यति, यथा शुक्तिकायां रजताभावं पश्यति and 9.34 -भूतप्रकृतिमोक्षं च = भूतानां प्रकृतिः = अविद्यालक्षणा अव्यक्ताख्या, तस्याः भूतप्रकृतेः | मोक्षणम् = अभावगमनं च ये विदुः विजानन्ति. In both these statements, the status of the world apart from Brahman is abhAva only. That is the context in which the tucchatvam is being talked about.
Please understand the context of what is being said before making statements like "please get into the spirit of the Upanishadic teachings."
Regards,Venkatraghavan

Respected Sir, "Tucchatvam of the world" is the most inaapropriate word to be used for Jagat.

Kindly see how the Upanishads say about Jagat :sa EvEdagM sarvam || Chandogya ;7-25-1
ahamEvedagM sarvam || Chandogya 7-25-1
AtmaivEdagM sarvam || Chandogya 7-25-2brahmaivEdaM viSvamidaM variShTham || mundaka 2-2-12
When everything proceeds from Brahman where is tucca and ucca?It is a sacrilege to call jagat as tucca.
Please get into the spirit of the Upanishadadic teachings .
With respectful namaskarams,Sreenivasa Murthy

Tucchatvam of the world is happily acceptable to Shankara. One example is
the last sentence of the BGB 2.16 'asat eva sat iva avabhasate. ' It is in
this sense alone Prakashananda uses the word tuccha.
