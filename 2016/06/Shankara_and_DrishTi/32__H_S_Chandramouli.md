Dear Sri Venkatraghavan Ji,


I have still a very long way to go in understanding the Bhashya properly. I
am convinced, rightly or wrongly, that prakAshAnandaâ€™s postulate is very
contradictory of the Bhashya. I would not like to devote further time and
effort in understanding his postulate as it is unlikely to help me
understand the Bhashya better. As such very regrettably I am unable to
respond . Please excuse me for the same. I wish you all the best in your
further study of his work.



Regards
