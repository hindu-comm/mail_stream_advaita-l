Dear Sri Anand Ji,

> “tuccha”, as mentioned in “ A history of Indian Philosophy “ by Sri
> Surendranath Dasgupta. Infact it is indeed like a Hare’s Horn only. Sri
> Dasgupta also presents the reasons which prompted PrakAshAnanda to adopt
> such an extreme position. He however also takes care to specifically state
> that PrakAshAnanda is an advaitin only !! The book ( in 5 volumes ) can be
