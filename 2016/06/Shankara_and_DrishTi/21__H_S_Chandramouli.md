Dear Sri Anand Ji,

Namaste.

I was just going through " A History of Indian Philosophy " by Surendranath
Dasgupta. He mentions that in the work Sidhantamuktavali of PrakAshAnanda,
the term "tuccha" is understood as " fictitious nonentity ", exactly the
same as in my understanding. Thought would share the information. I would
still be interested in your response to my earlier query, in case your
understanding is different.

Regards
