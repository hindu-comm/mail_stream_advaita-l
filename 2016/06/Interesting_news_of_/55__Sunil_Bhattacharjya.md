Dear friends,

Yesterday there was an interesting news-item in the news-paper "Deccan Herald", mentioning about a samadhi in Bassein, The news-item is somewhat confusing. The  url is :
<deccanherald.com/content/455526/vasai-beckons-tourists-its-diversity.html>.

It writes as follows:

Visitors also can see at Nirmal, which was created by Parshurama, the temple of Adi Shankaracharya Vidyaranya Swami. The temple on a hillock  provides a birdâ€™s eye view of the surroundings.

The Samadhi of Adi Shankaracharya is also in the same place. Besides the temple, Parshurama had created two big lakes Nirmal and Viamal. Replica of Shani Mandir in Vasai-Wagholi area, which is about one km  from Nirmal, is very calm and beautiful and has been drawing good crowd.

Would any list-member, who  visited this place would kindly let us know the actual details of the samadhi and other related details.

With thanks and regards.
