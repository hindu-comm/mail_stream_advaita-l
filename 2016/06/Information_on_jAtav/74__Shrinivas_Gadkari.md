Namaste, 

I am looking for more in depth information / mahAtmya of the single 
mantra sUkta 1.99 from Rig veda. I am summarizing some information 
here to start with: 

- This is (probably) the only sUkta in the entire Rig veda containing 
  a single mantra. This itself should say a lot about the importance 
  of this mantra. 
- bRihadAraNyaka upaniSat 5.14 (interestingly) highlights that gAyatrI 
  upAsanA by itself may not be enough, and it needs to be supported 
  by agni upAsanA. (May be, the jAtavedase mantra is the agni upAsanA 
  referred to in bRhadAraNyaka 5.14 ?) 
- tripurA tApinI upaniSat lists this mantra along with gAyatrI and 
  mRtyumjaya mantra as the three mantras that contain the all the 
  veda vidyA-s contained in them. 
- It is well known that this mantra is also the first mentra of durgA 
  sUkta. 

Regards, 
Shrinivas Gadkari
