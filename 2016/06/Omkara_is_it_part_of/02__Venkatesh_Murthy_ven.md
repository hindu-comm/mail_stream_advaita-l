Namaste

Visistadvaitis say Om is not included in Brahma Sutras but Dvaitis say
Om is in them like they will say Om Janmadyasya Yataha Om ॐ
जन्माद्यस्य यतः ॐ. Vijayindra wrote a book to explain it against
Visistadvaitis.

What is the opinion of the Advaitis? I think Om is not there. I did
not see it in Sankara Bhashya.
