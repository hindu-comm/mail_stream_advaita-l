At Buddhi level Sunyavaada arguments are correct. But at Paramartha
Atma level they are wrong. Raja Ramanna was a scientist. He was
operating at Buddhi level only. He could not understand Atma is Higher
than Buddhi. Therefore he was asked to read Sunyavaada arguments to
prove everything is unreal. If everything is unreal what next? Next is
Atma.
