Namaste,

What the Shruti should have said, or have Jabala say is irrelevant. We
don't fully understand why the Shruti says what she says and hence the
bhashyam. If the translations used were right, then I could also say she
should have said "I do not know who the father is, let alone his gotra".
Our logic has no place there. Bhashyakara has done a great job to set the
interpretation well by filling gaps, yet we have distasteful translations,
or stories based on incorrect interpretations, sadly including RK Math!

Kind rgds,
--Praveen R. Bhat
