Pranam,

Fail to understand in what way these discussions are helping to aid in Atma
vicAra or paramArtha jnAna ( Atmaikatva jnAna) ?//

If you have doubt on Acharya's commentary shouldn't you clear it out? The
discussion is related to the commentary of Chandogya Upanishada which was
done by Acharya. I do not think that it is unnecessary or irrelevant topic
on the platform of Advaitya as it is directly to related to Acharya's
works. The reason for my doubt is-
 त्बानहं द्बिषतः क्रुराण संसारेषु नराधमान।
क्षिपाम्यजस्रमशुभानासुरीषेब योनीषुः।।
आसुरीं योनीमापन्ना मूঢ়ा जन्मनि जन्मनि। षोড়श अध्याয়-उनिशतम श्लोक,गीता।
Therefore, if the opposition parties claims were true like Satyakama being
a son of adulterer, how can he gain the essence of Brahmajana? This is an
extraordinary situation.
The tale of Mahavarata is Arthavada. It can not be taken seriously.

The question of Sharmaji is logical-


The wife a nityagnihotri hears her husband's gotra innumerable times when
he utters his pravara after finishing
the agnihotra. A wife not knowing the gotra of her husband is rather
difficult to believe.//

Simple answer: She never paid attention to it.

No for nastikas I do not.  I freely admit to being one of those fanatics
you hear about.  The Veda is my mother and Shankaracharya is my father.  I
react very badly when they are assaulted.

I strongly agree with Vyas ji. Aurobind ji pointed finger at Jagatguru
based on some dubious reasoning . And the members of the group remained
silent about it. What kind of Guru Vakti is this? Don't you all posses
devotion and respect for Jagat Guru?

Best Regards,
