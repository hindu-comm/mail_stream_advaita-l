The discussion was not just limited to upanishad or  Shankaracharya
commentary.

There was mention of shraddhA, tapas, Brahmacharya etc in the text shared,
but the focus of discussion was clearly not on that ..

Not sure how all the "öther" discussions (outside Sruti + bhAshya ) would
benefit for one, who is interested in advaita paramArtha jnAna.

Hence my question ..

If one's objective in following this List (or participating in this list
discussion) is to strengthen one's conviction on one's understanding of the
ultimate Truth, then surely such questions will arise.

Thank you ...for you have answered my questions.

Would rather ignore these "öther" discussions going fwd as mithyA :)

Sometimes if the urge is too strong to contain, will only raise the below
question:

how  these discussions are helping to aid in Atma vicAra?
