Fail to understand in what way these discussions are helping to aid in Atma
vicAra or paramArtha jnAna ( Atmaikatva jnAna) ?

or how is it relevant for discussion in Advaita-L ?

By indulging in or promoting controversies, what has one to gain here ?

someone knowledgeable pl explain...

If the purpose happens to be - anything and everything under the Sun can be
discussed here - can see little light to ignore these threads and not bring
it up again :)

Thanks
