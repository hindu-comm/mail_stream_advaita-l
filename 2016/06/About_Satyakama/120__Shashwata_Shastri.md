Pranam Vyas Ji,

I asked my mother. Even she doesn't know about my father's gotra. She
thinks that- we are generated from Brahma, therefore our gotra is Brahma.
My gotra is Kashyapa, Pravaras are Naidhubro, Apasara. We are samavedic and
follower of Kouthuma branch. My mother doesn't even have a single clue
about -"What is a vedic branch". For gotra- I think she speculated the
story from somewhere else.

Best Regards-
