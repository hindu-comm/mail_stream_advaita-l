Namaste all,

The history behind the institution of marriage has been captured in the
Mahabharata as a dialogue between Panda and Kunti:
http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m01/m01123.htm

Also Baudhayana in his Dharmasutra makes an observation as an afternote
that "Some commend the ‘Gandharva’ form of marriage for all, because it
flows from love." (1.20.16). There could be a possibility that Satyakama
was born of Gandharva Vivaha.
