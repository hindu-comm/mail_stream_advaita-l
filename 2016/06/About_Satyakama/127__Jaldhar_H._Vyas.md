No for nastikas I do not.  I freely admit to being one of those fanatics 
you hear about.  The Veda is my mother and Shankaracharya is my father.  I 
react very badly when they are assaulted.

The hypocrisy on display is breathtaking. Nowadays we are told to "arise, 
awake" if some professor distorts the meaning of shastras.  But if 
Aurobind Padiyath does it we are not to bat an eyelid?

If some Muslim or Christian disparages our Gurus, sampradayas, and customs 
than there is a huge hue and cry.  But if Aurobind Padiyath does it 
then...silence?

Someone like Karunanidhi engages in anti-Brahmana conspiracy theories and 
gallons of ink are spilled about 'pseudo-secularism' or 'anti-hindu 
sentiments' etc. but Aurobind Padiyath does the same thing and...nothing?

It's such a horrible thing that aspersions were made about Aurobind 
Padiyaths wife.  But he can blithely accuse other women of being 
prostitutes?

Aurobind Padiyath thinks it wonderful we do not discriminate on birth but 
thinks mentioning his reputable family and forefathers is an argument.

It would be funny if it weren't so sad.

Go stand somewhere else.
