namaste

Sri Shashwata, you ask "How did lord Shankara concluded that she was a wife
of a Brahmin?"

It is not Aadi Shankara who draws this conclusion, but the text itself.
Sri Aurobind has quoted the text and bhaashya of the first three verse of
this section.
The fourth verse, however, provides the answer directly. The first words
are:
तँ होवाच नैतदब्राह्मणो विवक्तुम्

This is spoken by हारिद्रुमतं गौतम - it is he who declares सत्यकाम as a
Brahmin.
The purport of this section is to emphasize the adherence to Truth.
सत्यकाम was unflinching in his Truthfulness as well as his devotion.

Yours in Truth
Ryan
