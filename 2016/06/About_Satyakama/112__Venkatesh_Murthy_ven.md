Mahabharata has said -
They used to go about freely, enjoying themselves as best as they liked.
O thou of excellent qualities, they did not then adhere to their husbands
faithfully, and yet, O handsome one, they were not regarded sinful, for
that was the sanctioned usage of the times.

The important question is Jabala was following the ancient custom or
the marriage system of Eka Pati Vrata? If she was following Eka Pati
Vrata it will be very strange because she is not remembering even her
husband. If she had only one husband she could have told 'I do not
know your Gotra but you are son of Rishi X'. But she is not saying
that to Satyakama. We can see also there is not a huge passage of time
because Satyakama is still a boy. She cannot say because of huge
passage of time I do not remember anything.

Therefore we have to say Jabala was not following Eka Pati Vrata and
she was following the ancient custom of no marriage. She lived with
many Rishis and one of them was father of Satykama but she did not
remember which Rishi.

I think the Mahabharata story is saying women are not sinful in matter
of choosing and living with any husband because they follow natural
instincts like birds and animals. Like animals cannot be sinful women
also cannot be sinful in this matter. Men are sinful in this matter
because they are egoistic and think they own the women and they become
jealous of other men. To protect Men the marriage system was made.
