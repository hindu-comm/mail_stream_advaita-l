Lord Shankara on his commentary of Chandogya represented Satyakama's mother as 
a wife of a Brahmin. How come a wife of a Brahmin never had the chance to know 
about her husband's clan? Moreover she doesn't even know about her own family 
status! How did lord Shankara concluded that she was a wife of a Brahmin? In 
means of what logic and proofs?
