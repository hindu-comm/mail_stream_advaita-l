Namaste

Another pot-shot is the Chandala Episode in Kashi. Brahmin Haters say
Adi Sankara bowed to the Chandala. But it is not true. Sankara Dig
Vijaya has said that Chandala was Lord Siva. When Adi Sankara was
going to bow to Him the Chandala disappeared and Lord Siva was
standing there. Adi Sankara did not bow to any Chandala in his life.
