Actually there is no allegory here. It is a matter of fact that
Jaḍabharata, who was reprimanded by the King for the awkward way the former
was bearing the palanquin (of the King), continued to bear the vehicle just
as before - pūrvavat.  This is because, the chastisement had no effect on
him for he had no identification with the body, etc.
