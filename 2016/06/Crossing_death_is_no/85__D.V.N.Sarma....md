It seems that there was a tradition prevalent in ancient times that death
can be crossed by ritual.

For example in Namakam (rudradhyaya) we have

ये ते सहस्रमयुतं पाशा मृत्यो मर्त्याय हन्तवे।

तान् यज्ञस्य मायया सर्वानव यजामहे।

In Vishnu Purana in the Kandikya-Kesidhvaja dialogue kesidhvaja says

अहं ह्यविद्यया मृत्युं तर्तु कामः करोमि वै ।

राज्यं यागांश्च विविधान्भोगैः पुण्यक्षयं तथा ।।

Yajna is here equated with avidya.

Isavasyopanishad after a lot of jugglery with words Vidya and avidya says

अविद्यया मृत्युं तीर्त्वा विद्यया अमृतमश्नुते ।।

Here avidya is interpreted by Sankara as ritual. Crossing death is
different from immortality.

My question is, what do we mean by “crossing death by avidya or yajna or
ritual”.

Sarma.
