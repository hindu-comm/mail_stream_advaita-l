Perhaps "obtain" is the wrong word.  Jnana is the knowledge that you are 
nothing else but the eternal imperishable Brahman.  No being, human or 
divine can give that knowledge nor can they take it away.  But by 
performance of nitya and naimittika karmas without regard to the phala we 
can remove the veil of maya which prevents that jnana from shining forth.
