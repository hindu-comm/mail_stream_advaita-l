Namaste,

Gyana can certainly be obtained. While one does not obtain Brahman or
become Brahman, as one is Brahman in reality, that knowledge is obscured by
ignorance. The obtaining of knowledge in essence is the removal of that
ignorance.

Jnana can only arise through shravaNa manana nidhidhyAsana (SMN). No amount
of nitya naimittika karma anushthAna, in the absence of SMN, will help in
obtaining knowledge. While karmayoga can help in chitta shuddhi, it is not
sufficient for jnAna.

<<One can try to remain equal to joy and sorrow as much as humanly possible
and one can "intellectually" comprehend the fallacy of maya, samsara, etc
but that that is not real Gyana.>>

Not true. Understanding is necessary and sufficient for moksha. The real
understanding is that apart from understanding, nothing else is required.

Regards,
Venkatraghavan
