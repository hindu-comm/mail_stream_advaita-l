There is the kind of mimamsaka view that Shankara takes up for refutation
in Taittiriya and elsewhere.

M: by just doing nitya vihita karma and by not indulging in kanya and
avoiding nishiddha one can exhaust prarabdha and without need for jnana can
become releases.

Vedantin: this is impossible. However much one is careful to avoid
nishiddha one cannot succeed on totally avoiding it. SunipuNAnAmapi
sUkshmAparAdha darshanAt. Also one cannot exhaust all karna on one life.
Thus jnanam with proper effort is the only way.
