Namaste Sri Ravi Kiran ji,

> At the same instance, when you say former is different from latter, it is
not separate or apart from It (latter).
>
> The former is latter's own self-effulgence or chit-sphurana , which one
obtains through S-M-N of Sruti + Advaita bhAshya

Everything depends on Atma, but not everything is Atma's intrinsic nature.
Only existence-consciousness-bliss is it's intrinsic nature. Everything
else - including knowledge - is just incidental and mithyA. (That doesn't
mean knowledge is not useful, on the contrary it is extremely useful - but
utility is not a determinant for a vastu's satyatva).

Regards,
Venkatraghavan
