Thank you for the post.   Started reading it and now hard to stop.  But slight confusion from a beginner.  In these two para, shouldn't the word तत् be equated That and  त्वम् to Thou?  If so, small typo in the nice article.

धन्यवाद,
संजू नाथ

8. There again, in the first section, the pure Self meant by the word ‘thou’ i.e. ‘tat’ (in ‘Thou are That’, ‘tat tvam asi’ Ch. 6.8.6) is ascertained rationally through the Path of Action and its renunciation.

9. In the second (section), by way of describing steadfastness in devotion to God, is ascertained the meaning of the word ‘That’ i.e. ‘tvam’ as the Lord who is supreme Bliss.

Sanju
