'Sankararum-Vaiṇavamum' - Or vimarśanam

An Tamil article titled 'சங்கரரும்-வைணவமும்’ - ஓர் விமர்சனம் is available
in this location:

http://www.mediafire.com/download/ya0ejj8wb03i3tm/sankararum_vainavamum_TTA.pdf

The article points out the mistaken ideas the author of the Tamil booklet
'Sankararum-Vaiṇavamum' has put forward to claim a relationship between
Shankaracharya and vaiśṇavism. Since it is in Tamil, the present article is
also in the same language.
