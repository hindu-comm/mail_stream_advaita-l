Essential of the birth in human form is search for spirit , self, atman and mingle with prakriti 
The chakra of where one lands after departure of body rests on our search for that unknown atman - immortality ??
Be good to others is what many would consider the ultimate in realization of self
Our ancient scholars -- wonderful thoughts
Why so much chaos in the wonderland that is Indus nations ?

Please permit me to draw your kind attention to mantra 2-2-5 0f Mundaka upanishad ? The translation of mantra is given below :      " In Him are woven heaven, earth, and the space between, and the mind with all sense-organs. Know that non-dual Atman alone and give up all other talk. He is the bridge to Immortality." Should we not heed to the advice of the mother Sruti? Please onder over and come to the right decision.
