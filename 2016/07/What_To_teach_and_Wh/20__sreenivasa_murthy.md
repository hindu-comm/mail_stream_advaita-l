In the above passage in very clear terms Sri Shankara has pointed out what a Vedanta teacher has to teach and what has to be cognized by a mumukShu within himself by 
himself .
Why not devote our time and energy for the purrpose as stated by Sri Shankara instead of wasting one's energy and time in discussions which have no bearing upon Atmajnana? Please permit me to draw your kind attention to mantra 2-2-5 0f Mundaka upanishad ? The translation of mantra is given below : " In Him are woven heaven, earth, and the space between, and the mind with all sense-organs. Know that non-dual Atman alone and give up all other talk. He is the bridge to Immortality." Should we not heed to the advice of the mother Sruti? Please onder over and come to the right decision.

 I trust that Sri Shankara's advice will be listened by interested readers and will give a serious thought to it.
With respectful namaskarams,Sreenivasa Murthy
