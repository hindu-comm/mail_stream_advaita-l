What do you mean by "it exists on the *borrowed* existence"? Even in order
to borrow, it has to exist before such borrowing. You think vastu is
different from its existence. Quite illogical idea. Hence, srI Raghavendra
Tirtha emphasis on the point of "(continued) existence" part of jIva and
jagat. This is in line with bhAgavata's assertion --

 dravyakarma ca kalaSca svabhAvo jIva eva ca yadanugrahatah santi na
santi yadupekShaya
|| (2.10.12)

(Dravya, action, time, svabhAva, jIva, all exist by the grace of God;
if He neglects
them they cease to exist.)

As I quoted earlier -- the best example is -- if I am holding a pot in my
hand from eternal times,
pot's existence in terms of its stithi of continued existence is indeed
quite *depends* on me and my wish to sustain it. If I ignore it (upEkSha)
the  pot, it cease to exist.

This snake-rope analogy is flawed. No one will say the snake "exist"
ontologically speaking per se. It seems to exist in your knowledge, which
is bhrAnti. This is unlike jIva-jagat. They do exist ontologically. Their
existence is not bhrAnti in Brahman, but quite valid pratIti.

Nyayamirta clarifies such misunderstanding as yours --  brahma kAlatrayE
api sat, viyadAdi kadAcideva iti nityatva - anityatvAbhyAm Eva vaiSamyAm,
na tu satyatva - mithyAtvabhyAm


On the point of involuntariness involved in snake-rope illusion, shruti
says this creation is not like that.  In fact, both theses  -- the universe
being a modification of Brahman's form, and of its being
of the nature of illusion such as snake-rope, are both rejected in the
Mandukya Upanishad:

vibhUtiM prasavaM tvanye manyante sR^ishhTichintakAH | svapnamAyA sarUpeti
sR^ishhTiranyairvikalpitA | ichchhAmAtraM prabhoH sR^ishhTiriti sR^ishhTau
vinishchitAH ||

Some people, in consideration of sRishhTi, think it as being a modification
(prasavaM) of Brahman's own form (vibhUti). Others imagine it as being akin
(sarUpa) to the illusion of a dream (svapnamAyA). However, it is
established (vinishchitAH) that Creation is solely by the Lord's own Will
(ichchhAmAtraM prabhoH).

Hence, your snake-rope analogy to represent Dvaitic position is quite wrong.

That's the reason we say relationship between Brhamn with jIva-jagat is not
like any mundane relationship you find in this world. There is no
substitution for Brahman in this world. Do not forget Brahman is Eka and
advitIya.
