The following could give you and idea.  The aparoksha jnana of the Bimba
(original) is to be had.

The prasAdA of BhagawAn being inevitable for Moksha is given in the
following Sutra as well.

Aum pareṇa ca śabdasya tādvidhyaṃ bhūyastvāt tv anubandhaḥ Aum (3:3:54)

pareṇa ca = By ParamAtmA only, His darshanA/Aparoksha JnAnA is attained,
which is one step before Moksha.

AchArya madhva with the aid of shRutis said that mOkSha is an individual
experience of the self. The soul experiences its inherent AnaMda to its
fullest extent.

muktirhitvA&nyathArUpaM svrUpENa vyavasthitiH

[Giving up one's non-native form and remaining as one's true nature is
mukti.]

This knowledge of tAratmya is yatArtha ~jnAna and is an intrinsic part of
mOkSha sAdhane.

 Every satvika soul has to have a vision i.e., Aparoksha Jnana of his
Bimbaroopa.This chart helps to have such vision.

It is a state of consciousness(which ISKCON incidentally calls as Krishna
consciousness) which Dvaita calls it as aparoksha Jnana where Bimba rupa of
Narayana is directly envisioned by the qualified sage for eternity once one
reached this stage.
