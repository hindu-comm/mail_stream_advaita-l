Namaste

It is a good article. I did not understand why you say Mithya means
dependent reality. Take a dog. The dog's tail is depending on the dog.
Without dog there is no dog's tail. But there can be a dog with tail
cut off. I heard some Tantric practitioners cut a dog's tail and use
it for strange practices. Near my home there is a street dog. Someone
has recently cut its tail and took it.  It is independently used. But
can we say dog's tail is Mithya compared to dog when it is attached to
dog? No. It is not less real than dog.
