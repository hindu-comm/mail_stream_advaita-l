Hello,

This is Nithin here. I am Editor of IndiaFacts (indiafacts.org) and we
focus on Indology, Hinduism, Vedanta, etc.

I thoroughly enjoyed your article and would like to publish a shorter
version of it. Will it be possible for you to write a shorter version of
the article containing around 2000-3000 words?

Also, I would like to invite you to write for IndiaFacts on topics of
Vedanta, Hindu philosophy, etc.

Look forward to your response.

Regards,
Nithin Sridhar
