Dvaitis will argue against this. A person when seeing a snake will not
say snake is depending on rope for existence. He will not be seeing
rope. This is the illusion. After the illusion the Dvaiti will say the
snake was Atyanta Asat only but not Mithya. Therefore even after
Illusion Dvaiti can never say snake is dependent on rope for
existence.

But a thing in the world like a Jada Vastu or a Jeeva is dependent on
God. The Dvaiti is seeing the Jada Vastu and saying this. He is saying
the Vastu and God are both real. He will never say snake and rope are
both real.
