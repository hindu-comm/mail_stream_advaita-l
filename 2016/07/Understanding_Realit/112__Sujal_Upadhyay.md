Namaste,

In Advaita Siddhi,  Śrī Madhusudana Sarasvatī has explained 5 meanings of
mithyā. Śrī Anand Hudli ji has explained 3 meanings in his translation of
Advaita Siddhi. Śrī Vidyārāṇya Svāmī in Panchadaśī has also explained
mithyā as which is not completely true nor completely false.

Has anyone compiled the list of these definitions in simple words? mithyā
is the most talked about and unique principle of advaita and IMO deserves a
separate page.

OM

Sujal
