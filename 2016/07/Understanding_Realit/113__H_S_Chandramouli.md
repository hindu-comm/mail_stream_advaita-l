 Five definitions for मिथ्यात्वम् (mithyātvam) proposed by different
AchAryAs have been listed in advaita sidhi. They are as follows.



1. सदसद्विलक्षणम् वा मिथ्यात्वम् (sadasadvilakṣaṇam vā mithyātvam)  by Sri
PadmapAdAchArya in PanchapAdika



2. प्रतिपन्नोपाधौ त्रैकालिकनिषेधप्रतियोगित्वम् वा मिथ्यात्वम् (pratipannopādhau
traikālikaniṣedhapratiyogitvam vā mithyātvam) by Sri VivaranAchArya in
panchapAdikA vivarana



3.  ज्ञाननिवर्त्यत्वम् वा मिथ्यात्वम् (jñānanivartyatvam vā mithyātvam)
again by Sri VivaranAchArya in panchapAdikA vivarana



4.  स्वाश्रयनिष्ठात्यन्ताभावप्रतियोगित्वम् वा मिथ्यात्वम् (svāśrayaniṣṭhā
tyantābhāvapratiyogitvam vā mithyātvam)  by Sri ChitsukhAchArya in
tattvapradIpikA or chitsukhI



5.  सद्विविक्तत्वम् वा मिथ्यात्वम् (sadviviktatvam vā mithyātvam)  by Sri
AnandabhodAchArya in nyAyamakaranda.



I have not attempted any explanations of the definitions here. Left it to
others learned in Sanskrit to offer the same.
