एतावद् एव जिज्ञास्यं तत्त्वजिज्ञासुनात्मनः ।
अन्वयव्यतिरेकाभ्यां यत् स्यात् सर्वत्र सर्वदा ॥

एतावत् this much only एव indeed जिज्ञास्यं to be known तत्त्वजिज्ञासुना by
one desirous of knowing the truth आत्मनः of Atma. अन्वयव्यतिरेकाभ्यां with
the help of copresence and coabsence यत् that which स्यात् would be सर्वत्र
everywhere सर्वदा always.

"यद् अन्वयव्यतिरेकाभ्यां सर्वत्र सर्वदा स्यात् तद् आत्मा" एतावद् एव आत्मनः
तत्त्वजिज्ञासुना जिज्ञास्यम् । "That which is [concluded] with the help of
copresence and coabsence to be always [existing] everywhere, that indeed
[is this self]". Only this much is [needed] to be known by one desirous of
knowing the truth of the self.
