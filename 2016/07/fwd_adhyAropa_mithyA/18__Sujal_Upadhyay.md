praNAms,

We engage with samsAra because of various reasons.

First is aGYAna. Since many life times have have been within samsAra.

Second, after GYAna, if Ishvara has some divine plan of which you are to be
a part of, then pseudo ego is left, as ego, mind, etc is necessary to
retain a faint link with body.

Third, the GYAna is not aparoksha, it is informative from shAstra-s and
from words of guru or AchArya. Here one has to make attempts to purity mind
and make it introvert, then introvert mind should be rooted in source.
Since this is an ongoing process and is not yet complete, there are
vAsanA-s that need to be fulfilled. Also mind cannot stay inward 24x7. It
needs an emotional outlet, hence we need to be active in samsAra.

Lastly, even if one has experienced GYAna, still s/he cannot abide in it
permanently, here there may or may not be social activity. Some renounce
samsAra and take up sanyAsa, some keep doing karma but are always detached
from body, mind and ego by guru's grace and Ishvara's grace.

There is also an explanation for jivanmukta-s doing karma to extinguish
their prArabhdha.

Please remember, samsAra is in mind.

OM

Sujal
