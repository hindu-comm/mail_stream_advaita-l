PraNAms to all
We had one day camp at Chinmayamat Chinmaya Mission Washington Regional Center during the Memorial Day weekend,2016. The talks were recorded and made available on yu-tube by Advaita Academy.The URL is provide below for those who are interested.---------------------------------------------------Spiritual Awakening & Meditation.
Longing for everlasting happiness seems to be thefundamental pursuit for all human beings. Experience shows that none canachieve this by any pursuit, nor one can give up the pursuit for happiness.This forms the essence of human suffering, life after life. Vedanta says thatthis problem can only be solved by AWAKENING to one’s SPIRITUAL nature.Accomplishing this is the goal of the camp; nay the human-life itself. Thisrequires clear understanding of the goal, the means and the commitment to solvethe problem. It involves preparing the mind for Spiritual Awakening, understandingone’s real nature and abidance in that understanding. Meditation as a means toaccomplish this will be explored.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33uUAN5A39k
