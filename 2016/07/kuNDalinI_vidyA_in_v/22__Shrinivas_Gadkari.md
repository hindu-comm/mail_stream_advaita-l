Namaste, 

First of all would like to clarify that my knowledge of kuNDalinI is 
from second hand sources, books, Internet etc. 

However, I do strongly believe that veda-s are primarily talking only 
about the different aspects of kuNDalinI, nADI-s, chakras and their 
relation to various aspects of our life. 

There is every reason to suspect that the first mantra of Rig veda will 
talk in brief about the purpose of the entire veda. Now, consider the 
first three words of the first mantra of Rig Veda 

agnim IDe purohitam: I would interpret this as : agni which is related 
to idA nADI is the foremost of the tattva-s that looks after our 
well being. In other words, agni of veda-s is nothing but the agni of 
kuNDalinI vidyA. 

So it is not that kuNDalinI vidyA is mentioned in veda-s, veda-s ARE 
ABOUT kuNDalinI vidyA ONLY. 

Hari OM.

Regards, 
Shrinivas Gadkari
