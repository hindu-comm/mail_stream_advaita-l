Subject: [science-religion-philosophy] Hari-Hara aikyavAda in the Harivamsa
To: science-religion-philosophy at googlegroups.com


I promised Sri Subrahmanian that I would pull up verses from Harivamsa
which are strongly in favor of hari-hara aikya. Here are these verses -

http://mahabharata-resources.org/harivamsa/vishnuparva/hv_2_125.html


na cha tau pashyate kechidyoginau yogamAgatau |
eko brahma tathA kR^itvA pashya.NllokAnpitAmahaH ||2-125-23
No one else could realize that both kR^iShNa and shiva are one with yoga.
Only the grandfather brahma who has seen the world has made them so,
realized them as one.
uvAchaitatsamuddishya mArkaNDeyaM sanAradam |
pArshvasthaM paripaprachCha j~nAtvA vai dIrghadarshinam ||2-125-24
Immediately brahmA spoke about this to mArkaNDeya and nArada, who were
nearby, knowing that they are endowed with a vision for future.
pitAmaha uvAcha
mandarasya gireH pArshve nalinyAM bhavakeshavau |
rAtrau svapnAntare brahmanmayA dR^iShTau harAchyutau ||2-125-25
grandfather (brahmA) said:
O those with the soul of brahman (O mArkaNDeya and nArada)! I saw both
bhava (shiva) and keshava (kR^iShNa), hara (shiva) and the one not having
any decline (kR^iShNa), in a dream, in the night near a lake by the side of
mountain mandara.
haraM cha harirUpeNa hariM cha hararUpiNam |
sha~NkhachakragadApANiM pItAmbaradharaM haram ||2-125-26
I saw hara (shiva) in the form of hari (kR^iShNa - viShNu) and hari
(kR^iShNa - viShNu) in the form of hara (shiva). hara (shiva) was seen as
holding the conch, chakra, mace and wearing a yellow garment (like viShNu).
trishUlapaTTishadharaM vyAghracharmadharaM harim |
garuDasthaM chApi haraM hariM cha vR^iShabhadhvajam ||2-125-27
I saw hari (kR^iShNa - viShNu) holding the trident, three point spear and
wearing the tiger skin. hara (shiva) was mounted on garuDa and hari
(kR^iShNa - viShNu) was having the flag of the bull.
vismayo me mahAnbrahmandR^iShTvA tatparamAdbhutam |
etadAchakShva bhagavanyAthAtathyena suvrata ||2-125-28
O those with the soul of brahman (O mArkaNDeya and nArada)! Seeing that
most superior wonder, I was wonderstruck. O lord! O the one who observes
good penances! Please describe the secret of this in the proper way.
mArkaNDeya uvAcha
shivAya viShNurUpAya viShNave shivarUpiNe |
yathAntaraM na pashyAmi tena tau dishataH shivam ||2-125-29
mArkaNDeya said:
I do not see any difference between shiva in the form of viShNu and viShNu
in the form of shiva. They provide auspiciousness to the world.
anAdimadhyanidhanametadakSharamavyayam |
tadeva te pravakShyAmi rUpaM hariharAtmakam ||2-125-30
I proclaim that the form with the soul of hari (viShNu) and hara (shiva)
has no beginning, middle and end (destruction). This form is imperishable
and having no decline.
yo viShNuH sa tu vai rudro yo rudraH sa pitAmahaH |
ekA mUrtistrayo devA rudraviShNupitAmahAH ||2-125-31
The one who is viShNu is shiva himself. The one who is shiva is the
grandfather. The manifestation is one for the three lords, rudra (shiva),
viShNu (kR^iShNa) and the grandfather (brahmA).
varadA lokakartAro lokanAthAH svayaMbhuvaH |
ardhanArIshvarAste tu vrataM tIvraM samAsthitAH ||2-125-32
They provide boons, they are the creators of the world, they are lords of
the world, they are born from themselves, they are the half woman-man lord,
observing severe penances.
yathA jale jalaM kShiptaM jalameva tu tadbhavet |
rudraM viShNuH praviShTastu tathA rudramayo bhavet ||2-125-33
As water that falls on water becomes water, when viShNu enters rudra
(shiva), he (viShNu) will become full of rudra (shiva).
agnimagniH praviShTastu agnireva yathA bhavet |
tathA viShNuM praviShTastu rudro viShNumayo bhavet ||2-125-34
As fire that enters fire becomes fire, when rudra (shiva) enters viShNu, he
(rudra, shiva) will become full of viShNu.
rudramagnimayaM vidyAdviShNuH somAtmakaH smR^itaH |
agnIShomAtmakaM chaiva jagatsthAvaraja~Ngamam ||2-125-35
Remember that rudra (shiva) has the soul of fire and viShNu has the soul of
soma (nectar, moon). All the world including the fixed and movable beings
have the combined souls of fire and soma (shiva and viShNu).
kartArau chApahartArau sthAvarasya charasya tu |
jagataH shubhakartArau prabhaviShNU maheshvarau ||2-125-36
Splendorous viShNu and the great lord (shiva) - both do good for the world.
They are the creators as well as the destroyers of the fixed and moving
beings.
kartR^ikAraNakartArau kartR^ikAraNakArakau |
bhUtabhavyabhavau devau nArAyaNamaheshvarau ||2-125-37
Both the lords, nArAyaNa (viShNu) and the great lord (shiva) are the
creators of the creation and reason. They are the creators of all beings.
Both of them are the past, future and the present.
[jagataH pAlakAvetAvetau sR^iShTikarau smR^itau] |
[They are remembered as the sustainers and the creators of the world.]
ete chaiva pravarShanti bhAnti vAnti sR^ijanti cha |
etatparataraM guhyaM kathitaM te pitAmaha ||2-125-38
They alone cause the rain in the world , light up the world (as sun), move
in the world (as wind) and create the world. O grandfather! I have
described the highest secret to you.
yashchainaM paThate nityaM yashchainaM shR^iNuyAnnaraH |
prApnoti paramaM sthAnaM viShNurudraprasAdajam ||2-125-39
The man who studies this daily and the one who hears it (daily) will
ultimately attain the highest place due to the pleasure of viShNu and rudra.
devau hariharau stoShye brahmanA saha sa~Ngatau |
etau cha paramau devau jagataH prabhavApyayau ||2-125-40
I worship the lords hari (viShNu) and hara (shiva) along with brahmA. They
are the supreme lords, responsible for the creation and destruction of the
world.
rudrasya paramo viShNurviShNoshcha paramaH shivaH |
eka eva dvidhA bhUto loke charati nityashaH ||2-125-41
The supreme lord of rudra (shiva) is viShNu and the supreme lord of viShNu
is shiva (rudra). The same lord is moving in the world always in two forms.
na vinA sha~NkaraM viShNurna vinA keshavaM shivaH |
tasmAdekatvamAyAtau rudropendrau tu tau purA |
viShNu does not exist without sha~Nkara (shiva) and shiva does not exist
without keshava (viShNu). Hence, rudra (shiva) and upendra (kR^iShNa -
viShNu) have attained oneness, since long before.
