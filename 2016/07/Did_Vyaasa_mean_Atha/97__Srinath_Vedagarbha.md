So, what is the final verdict on that Sv.Up mantra? I hear two argument
here. Who is this 'dEva' being talked about --  nirupAdhika brahman or
Ishwara?

If it is former, then all guNa-s will be self same nature of that 'dEva'
(even as per you).

If it is later, then providing that shruti vAkya as an evidence to prove
nirguNatvaM of Brahman is futile as you did here
