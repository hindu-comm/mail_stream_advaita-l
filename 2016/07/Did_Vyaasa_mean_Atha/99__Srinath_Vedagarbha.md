Of course, guNapUrNa brahman is indeed upAsana yOgya. The above mantra does
not say such guNapUrNa is *ONLY* for upAsana. The 'idam' usage is warn
aspirant not to think salagrAmAdi pratIka-s themselves as Brahman.

Isn't it your usage 'nature of this Brahman' rejects idea that Brahman is
devoid of viShESha?

Who said Krishna is a 'person'? Your argument is based on wrong pUrvapaxa.

if janmAdi karaya-s of Brhman is taken as svarUpa laxaNa, which means two
things -- Brhman is not nirviShEsha/nishkriya, and this jagat is not avidya
kalpita but Brahma kalpita. Also, it leads to vIkArtvam of Brahman if
vivartopādāna argument is supplied.

I'm not sure where are you getting this idea Brahman as a person. I do not
think any school of vedAnta says this.
