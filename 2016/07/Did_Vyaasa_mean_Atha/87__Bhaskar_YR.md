Namaste
Ekatva, Devatva, Sarvajnatva and so on can be attributes of Ishwara but not Para Brahman is my understanding. That Para Brahman is described by Na Antah Prajnam Mantra of Mandukya Sruti.

praNAms
Hare Krishna

In shruti ekO devaH sarvabhUteshu, deva is Ishwara not brahma which is also kevalo nirguNa.  Interestingly this mAndUkya mantra also says tureeya is not even prajnAna Ghana whereas bruhadAraNyaka says brahman is prajnAna Ghana eva :-) 

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
