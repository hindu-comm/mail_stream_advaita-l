Guṇas are attributed to Brahman for the purpose of upāsana. That Brahman
which is to be known, realized, is taught as:

Tat 'eva' Brahma tvam viddhi, nedam yadidam upāsate. Kenopaniṣad.  That
alone is Brahman that you have to know (which impels the sense organs) and
is not that which people meditate upon as 'idam', this, as an object.

Finding this detrimental to his siddhānta, Madhva broke that word 'upāsate'
into three: upa, āsa, te. 'That one who is sitting near you and controlling
you' is Brahman and not 'this jivarupam'.  Yet the mantra has been rendered
without the word shown as 'upāsa te':

In the Kathopanishad 1.2.15 in reply to Nachiketa's question which itself
defines Brahman, we have:

सर्वे वेदा यत्पदमामनन्ति तपांसि सर्वाणि च यद्वदन्ति ।
यदिच्छन्तो ब्रह्मचर्यं चरन्ति तत्ते पदं सङ्ग्रहेण ब्रवीम्योमित्येतत् ॥ १५ ॥

All the vedas teach that state to be reached and all austerities are
followed for that purpose, I shall say about it in brief: Om is that.

And after that what follows is all about the nature of this Brahman and
nowhere any guṇas are brought in. Thus, Krishna is meaning this Brahman
alone by the word 'Me', and not he, the person who was born on a particular
day and departed on another.

Not so. The janmādi sutra and the mantra underlying it is taken by
Advaitins as meaning both the svarupa and taṭastha lakshana of Brhaman. It
is the vivartopādāna kāraṇam of the world.  See this explanation by a
scholar, especially the last line in the image:

Thus the jijñāsya Brahman is not a gauṇī (saguṇa) but mukhyam, nirguṇam.

Presenting Brahman as a person, with a body, resting on a serpent-couch,
etc. is symbolic, to help the initial aspirant to think of the abstract
Tattvam.
