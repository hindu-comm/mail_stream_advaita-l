Guṇas are there only for being manifested; otherwise there is no use of
them. No one would carry a load for nothing. The Sun is just luminous; it
does not resolve to illumine anything.  By virtue of being in its range,
objects get 'illumined.'  We have two expressions: सविता प्रकाशते, सविता
प्रकाशयति. The former is the vastu sthiti while the latter is our thinking
about it.

This is what begs logic. With no respect (need) of the jiva-jagat, PB need
not have any gunas. Gunas are there only for using/manifesting them.

If it is His 'icchā' that the jiva-jagat exists, then there can be no
greater sadist than Him. The Lord has said: anityam asukham imam lokam
prāpya bhajasva mām.  Why would the Lord revel in having such a world with
jivas suffering only to also give them the path to come out? In Tamil there
is a saying which means: the mother pinched the baby and when it wailed in
pain, she rocked the cradle. Why do we agree upon ajnana being the cause of
samsāra and jnana to remove it if it were only His icchā that we are in
samsara?

The creating guna is no more than being adhyakṣa, the consciousness lender:
mayā adhyakṣeṇa *prakṛtiḥ sūyate* sacharācharam.  It is only because He
cannot do it himself does he feel the need for the prakriti to do it. The
creating guṇa itself stems from the co-opting (partnering) prakṛti.
