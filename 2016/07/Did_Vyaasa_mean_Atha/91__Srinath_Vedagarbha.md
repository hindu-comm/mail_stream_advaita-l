It only shows you have confused between terms 'having' and 'manifestation'.
Your argument is akin to saying soorya's having illumination power is
depend on object on which it illuminates.  Irrespective of objects,
soorya's power exist. It is only known (to us the perceiver) in relation to
objects on which it illuminates.

So also, Parabrahman's guNa-s do exist irrespective of jIva/jagat. It is
only when we need to know about its manifestation we need jIva-jagat.

>From another angle when you look at it, when the very existence of
jIva-jagat itself is depends on His iccha, how do you apply your illogic on
such guNa (of having eternal sankalpa of not destroying jIva-jagat)?

Same here, being creator is different thing and having creating guNa is all
together a different thing.
