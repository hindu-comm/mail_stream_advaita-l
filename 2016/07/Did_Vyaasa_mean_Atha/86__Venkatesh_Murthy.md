Ekatva, Devatva, Sarvajnatva and so on can be attributes of Ishwara
but not Para Brahman is my understanding. That Para Brahman is
described by Na Antah Prajnam Mantra of Mandukya Sruti.

May I understand here from your above statement  that devatva (karmAdhyakshatva, sarvajnatva, sarvashaktitva etc.) are inherent nature of  (para) brahman ??  what are the other attributes  adhyArOpita on brahman in that case??  Not for debate just curious to know your explanation.
