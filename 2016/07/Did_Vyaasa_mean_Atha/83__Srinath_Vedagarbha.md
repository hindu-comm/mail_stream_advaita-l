So, in this context we can not take 'nirguNa' as attributeless, because the
upanishat has already listed several attributes such as Ekatva, Devatva,
gooDhatva, sarva-vyAptatva, antarAtmatva, karmAdhyakshtva, adhivAsatva,
sAkshee-tva, chEtanatva and kEvalatva and then says Brahman is NirguNa.

Consistent with this upanishat, Brahman is kEvala and because of that
reason He is nirguNa i.e, not connected with any guNas ( such as
sattva-rajas-tamas) or prakrti. In otherwords, Brahman is not made out of
anything that belongs to prakrti. Whereas this creation is made out of
prakrti, no one made
Brahman including prakrti. For this reason, Shrutis call Him as NirguNa or
aprAkrita.

Many people think, nirguNa means nir-vishEsha (or attributeless ) but we
should remember that upanishat has already listed a host of attributes
before saying Brahman is nirguNa. Therefore 'nirguNa' must also be
interpreted consistent with the rest of the attributes that the upanishad
has given.

Same here in this shruti also, nir-vishEshatva is not the tAtparya, because
it list host of other attributes. It uses 'Atma' and we all know the
definition of Atma as given by shruti itself elsewhere. For its own
question 'kathama Atma?', it only answers -- AtatatvAchha mAtrutvAdAtmEti
