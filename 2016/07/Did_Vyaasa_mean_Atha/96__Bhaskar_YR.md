Thanks again for the clarificationâ€¦this reminds me the dialogues between janaka and yAgnAvalkya in br. Up. Where yAgnAvalkya gives his final answer that Atman alone is the light of all.  Shankara clarifies this in sUtra bhAshya as well by citing the dream example where self-luminosity of Atman has been highlighted.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!

Sri Bhaskar ji,

By deva, if svayam prakAsha chit is meant (dIvyate svayam prakAshe iti deva:), then it would be nirupAdhika brahman indeed.

Thanks for your clarification prabhuji.  One more question but last one, whether devatva is inherent nature of brahman or Ishwara ?? It seems from below comments,  it is an inherent nature of Ishwara and not pertains to nirupAdhika brahman..am I right prabhuji??

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!

Namaste Sri Bhaskar ji,

Sarvajnatva, sarvashaktitva, jagat kAraNatva, karma phala pradAtritva are all Ishvara's attributes - i.e mAya vishishTa chaitanyam's.

I'm not sure how you can take ekatva, devatva etc. as attributes. These are not features that Brahman is endowed with, these are Brahman's inherent nature.

Very interesting observation.  May I understand here from your above statement  that devatva (karmAdhyakshatva, sarvajnatva, sarvashaktitva etc.) are inherent nature of  (para) brahman ??  what are the other attributes  adhyArOpita on brahman in that case??  Not for debate just curious to know your explanation.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
Bhaskar
