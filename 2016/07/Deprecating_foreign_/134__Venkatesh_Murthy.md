But you are missing the point. A Mleccha will not have any Samskara like
Upanayana. He will not learn Sastra traditionally from Guru but may be from
University Professor wearing pants and shoes. How can such a pant shirt
shoe wearing Guru without Samskaras give proper instruction? He will give
bookish knowledge only.

A man  wanted to learn making Masala Dosa from a book. In the book it was
written 'heat the Dosa pan and apply ghee on the hot pan'. He applied ghee
with hands on the hot pan and got burnt badly. This will happen if you
are learning from books.
