Since Hindu Astronomy at that time was not upto the mark our astronomers
borrowed from Yavanas. Nothing becomes automatically right just because it

propounded by a Hindu.

Usually a latter commentator contradicts a former commentator's point of

It is unreasonable to say that the latter commentator has no right to
contradict the former.

Sarma.
