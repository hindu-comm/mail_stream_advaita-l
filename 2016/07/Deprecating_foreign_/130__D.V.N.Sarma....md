Hindu tradition is to give due respect to deserving people irrespective of
their religion or nationality.
This attested and made evident by by Varahamihira in Brihat Samhita 2-14.

म्लेच्छाहि यवनास्तेषु सम्यक् शास्त्रं प्रतिष्ठितम् ।
ऋषिवत्तेऽपि पूज्यन्ते किं पुनर्दैवविद्विजः।।

Because of their entrenchment in the Khagola Sastra Yavanas though Mlecchas
are adored as Rishis. What to say if one is a brahmin astronomer/astrologer.

regards,
Sarma.
