Yes, that is what is said, but only with the prefix 'anādi.'.  This is to
keep in view that the ādhyāsika samsāra is characterized by experiencing
happiness and misery for which one cannot trace the cause in 'that'
particular life and the shāstra teaches about the earlier lives.  Hence
anādi is a necessary component of adhyāsa. That is why the shruti says
'anādimāyayā..'

The dream analogy has to be properly understood. That 'time' is also a
component of dream, along with the other things there, is realized only
when one comes out of dream. Since the dream is viewed while in the waking,
there is no ātmāśraya.
