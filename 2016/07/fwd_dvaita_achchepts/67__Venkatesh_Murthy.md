Namaste

Many Madhvas have moderate nature. They are not fanatics. I know
Madhvas fasting on Sivaratri day also and Sankata Hara Caturthi for
Ganesha. There are also many inter marriages with Smartas and others.

The trouble of fanatics is there only in some Matha मठ people and
people close to those Mathas. They will raise slogans and false
propaganda against Advaita without enough knowledge of Advaita. There
are noises created by some of these people on Internet also.
