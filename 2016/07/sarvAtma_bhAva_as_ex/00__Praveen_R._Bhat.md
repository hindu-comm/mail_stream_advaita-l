I am just trying to confirm that you are also saying the same thing as I
have understood when I say: the word ब्रह्म in the quoted अनुवाक means
हिरण्यगर्भ though, since the context is उपासन। Moreover, the attainment of
सर्वात्मभाव here is after death.

Bhashyakara mentions Sushumna in his commentary under Katha 2.3.16 also.

That is interesting to note.
