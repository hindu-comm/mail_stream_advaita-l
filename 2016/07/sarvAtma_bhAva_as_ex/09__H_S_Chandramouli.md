>> Pranams.  I am very grateful for the elaborate explanation*. *
>>
>>
>>
>> Reg need for shravana after GYAna, I understand by the term GYAni one
>> who, on hearing the mahAvAkya upadEsha from the Guru, has attained the
>> following state.

>> क्षीयन्ते चास्य कर्माणि तस्मिन्दृष्टे परावरे ॥ ९ ॥  Mundaka Up 2-2-9.

>>
>> From this stage on, even if he has to practice any sAdhanAs for
>> achieving jIvanmukti, my understanding is that he undertakes them on his
>> own without a Guru. Since shravana means study of shrutis through a Guru,
>> the practice of studying the shrutis the GYAni undertakes comes under
>> nididhyAsana only and not shravana. I am open to correction on this.
>>
>>
>>
>> Reg your observation << So, if the person was meditating on brahma
>> before GYAna, he will start to meditate on something else after GYAna!?
>>
>> Do you have any clear idea of what you have understood??
>>
>> If yes, please tell that. Such ambiguous claims are not useful. >>,
>>
>>
>>
>> nididhyAsana (meditation on brahma as you term it) is through vichAra,
>> both before and after GYAna. While the vichAra is centred on Brahman both
>> before and after GYAna, the nature of this vichAra undergoes a complete
>> change as his “understanding”  of Brahman undergoes a complete change
>> consequent to GYAna. This is what I meant.
>>
>>
>>
>> Reg your observation  << What is the role of prakriyA in nididhyAsana?
>> Is he going to remember the whole prakriyA while meditating?
>>
>> That's not acceptable. He has to meditate on brahman, not on prakriyA.
>>
>> prakriyA-s are mithyA.>>,
>>
>>
>>
>> By prakriya, I am referring to the understanding of srushti and samsAra
>> vis-à-vis Brahman. VichAra centres on this. Why should he remember the
>> whole prakriya. He carries on with the vichAra based on this understanding.
>>
>>
>>
>>
>> Reg your observation  << Any mumuxu is adhikArI of brahma-GYAna.>>
>>
>>
>>
>> Absolutely. But how does anyone become a mumuxu? He has to become a
>> sAdhanaCHatuSHtayasampannah. This is possible only by allowing for
>> vyAvahArika sathya which implies following sṛṣṭidṛṣṭiprakriyā. There is no
>> choice. But then why subsequently change to dṛṣṭisṛṣṭiprakriyā for becoming
>> a GYAni ?? It is not logical.
>>
>>
>>
>> I have not said that a GYAni should necessarily changeover to
>> dṛṣṭisṛṣṭiprakriyā to become a jIvanmukta. He can certainly continue with
>> the system he was following earlier. But since his understanding has
>> changed significantly on gaining GYAna, there is nothing illogical if he
>> were to find dṛṣṭisṛṣṭiprakriyā to be more appropriate and follow the same
>> subsequently. That is all what I said.
>>
>>
>>
>> Pranams and Regards
