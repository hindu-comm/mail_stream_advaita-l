Namaste,

///

the word ब्रह्म in the quoted अनुवाक means हिरण्यगर्भ though, since the context is उपासन। Moreover, the attainment of सर्वात्मभाव here is after death.

is mentioned in shrutis also in contrary to some who argue that it is purely tantric and
doesn't find it's presence in vedas.

sriram
