I don't quite understand what you mean by jivanmukti is just one step
ahead. Could you please clarify? Do you mean that by upAsanA or by
understanding the सर्वात्मभाव? About the former, as I mentioned earlier,
सर्वात्मभाव as a result of Taittiriyaka उपासनs is post-mortem. As for the
latter, that can be, but that is not the context of the 1st chapter of Tai.
Up. In fact, Bhashyakara says that due to the context of उपासन, even the
mantra "अहं वृक्षस्य रेरिवा..." which is completely Vedantic, is only for
the purpose of स्वाध्याय which means जप for the purpose of चित्तशुद्धि here.

True. Perhaps those people think there are no Upanishads other than the so
called "main" ones. I am sure you are aware, but some may want to know that
Muktika lists many yoga upanishads, one (86th) of them being
yogakunDalyopaniShad dealing with Kundalini.
