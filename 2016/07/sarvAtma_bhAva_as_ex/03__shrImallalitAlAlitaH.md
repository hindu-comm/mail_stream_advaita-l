It appears as if it is being propagated that jIvanmukti is result of
saguNopAsanA.
If it is, let me clearly say that it is unacceptable in advaita-matam. We
accept that GYAna leads to videhamukti and if it is accompanied by
yoga/upAsanA and vAsanA-xaya it leads to jIvanmukti, which is just
unperturbed-ness of mind.
That person who is not emancipated from ignorance, can't be called free
while alive.
Just being upAsaka is not a sign of knowledge of advitIya-brahma.

kuNDalinI-vidyA is present in veda-s. OK.
But, why relate it to the usage of word suShumnA by bhagavatpAda in a
totally unrelated place.. Aren't veda-s enough to prove that devI or
chaitanya is to be worshipped as kuNDalinI for specific result.

Another thing, the word suShumnA is not necessarily related with kuNDalinI
vidyA. It was used to propound the dream-state too. So, why conclude that
just mention of suShumnA is enough to prove that kuNDalinI-upAsanA is
hinted there and hence is vaidika?
