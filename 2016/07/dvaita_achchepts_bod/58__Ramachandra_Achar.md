Sir,
       You said one should get rid of self nature of brahman,which means
destruction of chaitanya or in other words chaitanya can never realized
that it is brahman

For that answer is,yes chaitanya can never realise that it is brahman

Chaitanya it self is brahman

,here you are not getting rid of brahman nature of chaitanya,but you are
getting rid of adyasa or agjnana or

in other words anathma,or notion of being jiva is removed ,but brahman will
be retained

Or one converting from suguna to nirguna or pure chaitanya

So brahman indeed don't have knowledge of being brahman,but brahman it self
is knowledge.Pragnanam Brahma ,brahman is knowledge not brahman has
knowledge

I hope you understood
