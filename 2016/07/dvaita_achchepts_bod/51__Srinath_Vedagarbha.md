In the article posted, there are several misreading while posing the
objection.

In page 3 of the article, the objector ask the question --

//Quote

Now, the question that is all-important is: Is the body in the above
‘body-adhyāsa’ a real entity or not? If it is the former, then we have the
further question: How does one (jivātmā, which Sri Vijayadhvaja Tirtha says
is ‘chidānanda svarūpa’) come to have the mistaken identity with the body
which is inert, prakṛtikāryam? The Bhāgavatam and Sri Vijayadhvaja Tirtha
say that the body is ‘kalpitam.’ Going by the definition of Sri Jayatirtha

Sri. Vijayadhvaja Tirtha (also Bhagavatam) does not say body is 'kalpitaM'.
What is being said is kalpitam is the 'identity' of self with the body, not

notion/idea of non-difference of body from self. Not the body itself.

Rest of the objection in that article can be rejected as it was constructed
on wrong reading of original texts. Dvaita does not accept body is adhyAsa.
In fact in the school the body is very much real (but temporary) and needed
for saadhana.
