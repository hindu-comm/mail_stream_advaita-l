We can have another analogy:

In a dream I have a rope-snake illusion.  After the dream I can definitely
say: That I had an illusion is also a bhrama.  This is because the dream
itself is a bhrama.  There is no anavasthā here since it stops there.

In a dream it is not that the people, objects, etc. first appear and then
time element comes later; everything appears simultaneously, just like in
the waking where an afternoon event is happening in the afternoon setting.
There is no ātmāshraya here.
