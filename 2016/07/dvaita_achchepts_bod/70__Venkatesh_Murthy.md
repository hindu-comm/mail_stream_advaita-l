There are three Avasthas  Waking, Dream and Sleep. All the discussion
is happening
in Waking but can happen in Dream also. There is one more Fourth or
Turiya. That is the
Brahman. In Turiya and Sleep there can be no discussion. From logic
and Sruti we can see
the Waking, Dream and Sleep are MithyA only. Mandukya Upanishad is
telling all this.

Now we can answer your question. Where is the Anadi Bhrama happening?
Is it in Waking
and Dream and Sleep? Yes. Therefore it is not real.

You cannot accuse us with Atmashraya and Anavastha rubbish when
Mandukya Sruti is
telling us. You cannot say Mandukya Sruti telling you is also Bhrama
and so on. It is a
nonsense argument.

Dvaita is taking approach of arguing everything with Tarka or Kutarka.
But we take help from
Sruti and Sruti Anugruhita Tarka. Therefore we say Adhyasa is
established in Sruti itself. No need
for proving it separately.

Here also Sruti is telling is there is Avastha Turiya and in this
Avastha Jagat is MithyA.
No need for argument and proving it separately.


The big difference is we take help of Sruti and Logic but not Logic
and Puranas like Dvaitis.
Entire Dvaita is based on Kutarka and Purana stories.
