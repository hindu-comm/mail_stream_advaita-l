Anadi bhramA argument was given to explain adhyAsa/vyavahAra. Upon showing
such anAditvaM of bhramA will render bhramA as the self-same nature of chid
Atma, you did reply saying that issue is only when one accepts such bhramA
and said such bhramA itself is not there in reality. I was asking you
whether invoking anAdi bhramA argument itself is another bhramA?. If it
were, then how do you explain having this bhramA? To account for this
second bhramA you need to another bhramA parampara from anAdi. This is the
anvasthA I was talking.

Ignoring all these, let us ask again -- what is the actual position? Is
proposed anAdi bhramA as really real? or itself is a case of another of
bhramA?

When very concept of adhyAsa is in discussion and it's siddhattva is yet to
be established by the proponent, supporting the argument by calling the
very discussion under such assiddhA adhyAsa/vyavahAra -- is what else other
than AtmaShrya?

The assertion "This is a dream" is valid ONLY when the avastha in which it
was uttered is found to be really a dream. Now in this jAgrta avastha we
know that it was uttered in a dream avastha, hence found to be valid. You
can not assert the same validity while in dreaming itself.

In the same logic, a pUrvapaxin argues -- the assertion 'jagat is
adhyAsa/mithya' is may be valid when we realize the avastha in which that
sentence is uttered is found to be adhyAsa, definitely not while we are
still in this jagat avastha.
