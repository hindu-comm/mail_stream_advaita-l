Correct, in that case nobody will argue for rope-snake adhyAsa and its
cause. It is simply denied as svapna bhramA. But in the case of adhyAsa
debate, an argument base don anAditvaM was forwarded. Why not simply say
all body-self adhyAsa is adhyAsa itself?

As said in earlier reply, dream objects are known to be adhyAs outside of
dream avastha, not while in it. No value in argument in saying dream
objects are adhyAsa while in dream itself. This indeed is atmAShrya flaw.
