You are saying as if the Bhrama is really there in the Self. If it is
really there in Self it will be Svabhava.

But if Bhrama is not really there it cannot be Svabhava. This should
be realized by Jiva by Mahavakya like Tat Tvam Asi. He will realize
Bhrama was not there at all.

Time is existing only for Vyavaharika purposes. The instruction of
Guru is happening in Vyavhara only. Therefore we accept time. But in
Brahman stage there is no time.
