I am not saying having the Bhrama itself is a Bhrama. You are saying
that. You think you lost a necklace and search for it everywhere and
find it on your neck. Will you not say the necklace being lost itself
is a wrong idea? It was never lost. Now you cannot say thinking the
necklace as lost is wrong itself is wrong. Where is Anavastha here?

Without Adhyasa we cannot even have a discussion of Adhyasa because
words and thoughts are result of Adhyasa. Will this mean there is
Atmashraya flaw? No.
In a dream someone may say to you 'This is a dream'. There is no Atmashraya.
