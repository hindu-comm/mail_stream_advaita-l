What is your opinion on the author's comment on 'old lore' (scriptures /shAstra) 
and asking us to give more credence to the maharshi vAkya as against shAstra??   

//

My is opinion is that of Bhavabhuti's statement vide उत्तररामचरित​ as:

लौकिकानां हि साधूनां अर्थं वाक् अनुवर्तते ।
ऋषीणां पुनराद्यानां वाचं अर्थोऽनुधावती ॥

"Wise men speak about real happenings. But the words spoken by sages become reality after they are uttered"

regs,
Sriram
