An excerpt from the Book 'Exalting Elucidations' - 'Study of Śāstras' p.180:

Disciple: Is the study of scriptures necessary for one having absolute
faith in the teaching of one's Guru?

Acharyal (Srimad Abhinava Vidyatirtha Mahaswaminaḥ):  If a disciple has so
firm a faith, it is not necessary for him to study the śāstra-s formally in
order to know the Truth.
