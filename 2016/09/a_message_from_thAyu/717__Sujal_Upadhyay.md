praNAms,

A quick google search (query: essence of ribhu gita) landed me on this page
(pdf file)
http://www.sageramana.org/files/Essence%20of%20Ribhu%20Gita.pdf

Search "who am i" and on page 12, point 72

Enquiry should be made this wise:  With the kind help of the Sat-Guru one
should enquire “Who am I, what is this world and what is the reality behind
all these?” (Ch.32, v. 21)

But the method does not end up in just enquiry. Like nirvANa shaTaka, it
ends in "I am Brahman"

One should relentlessly pursue Self-Enquiry until all conceptual forms of
creature, world and creator merge and disappear in the pure thought-free,
alert Awareness-Self, enabling one to abide in that Bhavana of the
experience, "l am the Brahman-Self". (Ch. 32, v. 27)

OM
Sujal
