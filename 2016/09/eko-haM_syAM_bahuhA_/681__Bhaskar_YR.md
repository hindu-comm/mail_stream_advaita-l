What was the reason behind Hiranyagarbha's desire to become many?

>  According to veda, vedAnta prior to creation,  it is parabrahman only first think about becoming many as soon as he gets is 'eccha' (desire) paNcha tanmAtra-s, samashti buddhi, ahaMkAra etc. (at macro level),and purusha who has this macro level upAdhi called hiraNya garbha.  And according to shankara, srushti ( or becoming many) is for jeeva-s for karmAnubhOga.  Geeta bhAshya on 13th chapter would be relevant here.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
