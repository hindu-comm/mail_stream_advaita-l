Dear Sriramji,

I think you may find the Tamil commentaries by Sri Anna N.Subramanian of the Sri Ramakrishna Math, Mylapore, Chennai good enough for both the Brahma Sutra Bhasyam and Bhagavad Gita. However,f or bhagavad Gita, I would like to recommend the Tamil commentary by Srimad Swami Chidbhavanandaji Maharaj. You may find these books at the Giri Trading Agency in Malleswaram branch in Bangalore.

 I saw a Bhashyam book in Tamil at Ramakrishnan Book Store Opp Mylapore tank in Chennai. If I remember right it is written by Swami Ashokananda and is meant for the uninitiated. Though predominantly based on Shankara Bhashya, it also makes use of the bhashyas of the other 2 acharyas (as per its preface). Would recommend the same for your parents. Regards,

Venkatraman
