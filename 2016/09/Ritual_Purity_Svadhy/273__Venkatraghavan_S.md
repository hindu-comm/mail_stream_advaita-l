The Samkshepa Dharma ShaAstram book published by Kanchi Kamakoti maTham
quotes Atri and Shankha maharishis:

SandhyA trayam tu kartavyam dvijenaatma vidaa sadaa |
Pratah Sandhyaam
sa nakshatraam Madhyamaam snaanakarmani | Saadityaam paschimaam sandhyaam
upaaseeta yathaa vidhi ||

SandhyA is to be worshipped thrice as prescribed by Brahmins desirous of
Atma jnAna. The prAtah sandhya when the stars are seen (before sunrise),
the mAdhyAhnika in conjunction with the snAna karmas and the sAyam sandhyA
with the sun in the west.

The same idea is conveyed in the cryptic Tamil saying by IDaikADa siddhar
as he was grazing sheep - "kANAmal koNAmal kanDu kuDu, Adu kaN poguthu pAr."
The literal translation seems like gibberish, but there is a hidden meaning
to every word - "Give when you cannot see, when it is not crooked, and when
you see. See the sheep and kid go."

What it really means, give arghya when you cannot see the sun (before
sunrise), when your shadow is not crooked, or the sun is straight above
(mAdhyAhnika), and when you can see the sun, just before sunset. By ADu
(sheep), what is meant is nIrADu or bathe in the Ganges, and by kaN (kid)
it go see the lord in Setu (Rameshwaram), and see your sins vanish.

Regards,
Venkatraghavan
