Actually on such topics smrits, śiśṭācāra, aitihya are all pramāṇas. We
have known śiṣṭas to be performing trikāla sandhyā vandanam.  Hence that is
pramāṇa as per Shankara.

I have seen in Sringeri too several people, not just those from the
Tamil/Kerala origin, perform mādhyāhnika at the riverside.  Even the
present Sannidhanam, before sannyāsa, used to perform it as I have myself
seen it.

The Paramaguru Sri Chandrashekhara Bharati Swamiji, several decades ago,
had asked a devotee in his thirties, when the latter submitted to him his
daily practices,'How about mādhyāhnika?' (in Telugu).  From that day till
the end, not a single day he missed the mādhyāhnika. He used to recount
that incident to us saying 'The Guru's question that day in Sringeri
 sounded like an command and even to this day his voice and the tone
reverberates in my mind.'
