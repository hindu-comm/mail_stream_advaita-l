Namaste Venkatesh ji,
I don't want to argue about mAdhyAhnika - my family has been doing it for
generations so it's not something I can give up, however if you feel
differently that is of course your prerogative.

I had a general mImAmsa question on this statement: "When Sruti is one
thing and Smrti is saying extra things we may or may not do it."

The question is, isn't the rule that if Shruti is prescribing a
vidhi/niShedha and the smriti contradicts it, then the smriti should not be
considered?

However, if smriti is prescribing additional vidhi/nishedha (ie not a
contradiction, but an addition) then both smriti and shruti taken together
(ie the complete set of rules) will have to be followed? That is, the
additional smriti injunction is not optional, it is mandatory.

Regards,
Venkatraghavan
