Actually the very first sandhyā vandanam a vaṭu performs soon after his
brahmopadeśa is the mādhyāhnika.  That evening is the first sāyam sandhyā.

In the Srimadbhāgavatam, the story of Ambarisha has Durvāsa going to the
Yamuna to perform his noon-oblations:

SB 9.4.37



*pratinandya sa tāṁ yācñāṁ kartum āvaśyakaṁ gataḥnimamajja bṛhad dhyāyan
kālindī-salile śubhe*
Word for word:
*pratinandya <http://vedabase.com/en/synonyms-index?original=pratinandya>* —
gladly accepting; *saḥ <http://vedabase.com/en/synonyms-index?original=sah>*
 — Durvāsā Muni; *tām <http://vedabase.com/en/synonyms-index?original=tam>* —
that; *yācñām <http://vedabase.com/en/synonyms-index?original=yacnam>* —
request; *kartum <http://vedabase.com/en/synonyms-index?original=kartum>* —
to perform; *āvaśyakam
<http://vedabase.com/en/synonyms-index?original=avasyakam>* — the necessary
ritualistic ceremonies; *gataḥ
<http://vedabase.com/en/synonyms-index?original=gatah>* — went; *nimamajja
<http://vedabase.com/en/synonyms-index?original=nimamajja>* — dipped his
body in the water;*bṛhat
<http://vedabase.com/en/synonyms-index?original=brhat>* — the Supreme
Brahman; *dhyāyan <http://vedabase.com/en/synonyms-index?original=dhyayan>* —
meditating on; *kālindī
<http://vedabase.com/en/synonyms-index?original=kalindi>* — of the
Yamunā; *salile
<http://vedabase.com/en/synonyms-index?original=salile>* — in the water; *śubhe
<http://vedabase.com/en/synonyms-index?original=subhe>*— very auspicious.

For that word 'āvaśyakam', Sridhara Swamin (Advaitin) and Virarāghavacharya
(Viśiṣṭādvaitin) comment: mādhyāhnikam.
