उद्यन्तमस्तं यन्तमादित्यमभिध्यायन्कुर्वन्ब्राह्मणो विद्वान्त्सकलं
भद्रमश्नुतेऽसावादित्यो ब्रह्मेति इति ।

Taking this mantra as pramANa, shatavadhani R.Ganesh Ji argues
that there is no mAdhyAhnika sandhya which has been introduced 
later as a shiSTAchAra.  

He also says that there is no mention of bhagavAn rAmachandra doing
mAdhyAhnika sandhya in rAmAyaNa.  Only prAtah & sAyam sandhyA
are mentioned in rAmAyaNa.  

However, these arguments were not accepted by Sri.Bharati Tirtha Swamiji.

regs,
sriram
