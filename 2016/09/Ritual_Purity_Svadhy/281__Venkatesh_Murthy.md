Namaste

Many Swamijis have said we can do Madhyanhika in the morning itself before
going to office. But there is no concession like this for Pratah and Sayam
Sandhyas. Nobody has said we can do Sayam Sandhya also in the morning
before going to office. Pratah and Sayam Sandhyas must be done at proper
time only sunrise and sunset. If you are coming home late from office you
can do it at the correct time outside home or you can do it after
coming home with Prayascitta Arghya for the late Sandhya.

This is showing Madhyanhika rule is not so strict like Pratah and Sayam.
Why? Because Sruti has not said Madhyanhika must be done like Pratah and
Sayam Sandhyas. Because it is coming from outside Sruti it has flexible
time.
