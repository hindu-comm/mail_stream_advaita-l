adhyayana of Veda (including upanishads) should not be done outside of a 
shuddha environment.  Some allow Silent recollection of already learnt 
material or Gayatri japa.  I used to do japa on the train but then I 
decided that quality is better than quantity so better to do it at home 
even if less in number.  Shastras I still study on the train. 
Translations should be quite alright.  The main consideration is more 
about if one can concentrate with the noise, crowds etc. rather than 
shuddhi.  Still, it is a better use of your time than reading some rubbish 
novel, playing games on the phone etc.
