I thank you all PROFUSELY for responding.

In addition I want to convey my very pleasant amazement
at what has happened:

I ask what I thought
was a very elementary question
about ritual purity.

In return, I get detailed responses that talk about,
among many other valuable, useful, and thought provoking ideas:

1. The distinctions between purity required for Shruti and that for other
scripture, for original and for translation,
2. The importance of a calm, stable and receptive mind, and for repetition
of study
3. The differing requirements for Brahma anusandhanam
4. The alternatives of mantra japa, meditation, and mental recitation of
memorized verses
5. The need for constant Nidhidhyasanam
6. The necessity of a proper setting for proper pranayama and other yogic
kriyas.
7. The suggestion to start with a shanti mantra
8. The need to use time effectively.


Really, I am awed, inspired, and grateful to witness so much knowledge and
faith.
Thank you all again.


Shashi
