​​
Pranams,

Restrictions apply to yogic kriyA-s. We were advised not to mediitate in
public. After certain years, some of us were told not to even use public
swimming pool, avoid crowds and Mumbal Local trains, as there is lots of
stress and negative energies. There are lots of people around you and you
do not know if they are sick or have negative energy. When prANamaya
kosha-s get in contact with others, energies are exchanged. While
meditating in group, weaker ones are benefited, but stronger ones are on a
losing side. This is because, like water, energy flows from higher level to
lower grosser level.

As I understand, it is for this reason that prANAyama, and energy based
meditations and kriyA-s are to be avoided in public and are to be practiced
among like-minded people. However, japa is different. Here there is no
focus on any prANa shakti. It is simple japa. japa calms mind, removes
worldly thoughts. Infact japa helps you to stay connected with God
day-n-night. It should be practiced at any time, in any place, except that
you are urinating, etc. Even while bathing people chant mantra-s.

japa is not any process, not any energy based kriyA. Also have faith in God
that it is in him that you are surrendering. Ishvara is the creator of this
universe and if I am surrendering to him, what can disturb me, what
negativity can touch me? - we should have such a faith. Remove fear. We
must be God loving people and not God fearing people.

All the muhurat-s, good and bad are to be accounted seriously when you wish
to do something. But if you wish to withdraw yourself from the world, then
you do not need a muhurata. Yes we are all under the influence of mAyA and
prakriti. So we do have to take good and bad places into account. But we
should aim to rise above. When less options are available, we must make
good use of time.

OM

"To disconnect from the self and to become Aware of anything else is
nothing but unhappiness" - Bhagawan Ramana Maharshi

He who has faith has all
He who lacks faith, lacks all
It is the faith int he name of lord that works wonders
FAITH IS LIFE, DOUBT IS DEATH - Sri Ramakrishna
