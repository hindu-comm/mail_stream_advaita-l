Dear
As per Gita the place for meditation should be neat and tidy.Suchow dese......reads the stanza 11of chapter6.If you are to contemplate then you should go by this stanza and the previous one.But for reciting slokas which you had committed to memory and to investigate the exact purport of the sloka it can be done anywhere even when you are bathing,walking,traveling .Sometimes you may skip a station or a stop.Nevermind.Shows your involvement.
R.Krishnamoorthy.
