Namaste,

If the movement in the train is much jerky & bumpy, then it is not advisable
as it would effect the eye sight.

Because, owing to frequent jerks in the train, the eyes try to refocus 
on the reading material which would make it strenuous and painful and
sometimes, it may cause vomiting sensation.

So, sitting quietly and contemplating on the meaning of the mantra
and nAma-smaraNa is the ideal one usually while travelling.

regs,
sriram
