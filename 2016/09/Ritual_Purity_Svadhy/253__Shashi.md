Hello All,

I have a question about ritual purity 
and Svadhyaya.

I recently got a translation of 
Sri Madhusudana Sarasvati's
Gudartha Dipika which I am excited to study.

However my commute to work is a good two hours in total on the train.

I thought I could 
study on the train - 
this is when I have the most 
time that until now I typically spend 
the least effectively 
but I doubt whether that's a
pure enough environment to 
study. 

What are your thoughts 
on Svadhyaya conducted
outside a sanctified place 
like a puja room or temple. 
and inside a place like a train?
If it's ok, what does one need
to do to be ritually pure enough
to study it there? 

Shashi
