I just wanted to add that the practice of 'māngalya dhāraṇam' has no source
in the shruti or even smritis. I have heard that it is a practice among
only certain sections of Hindus.  Among Kerala hindus it is exchanging of
ring, etc. but mangalya dharanam is not a must. Even in the North not all
Hindus have this practice.
