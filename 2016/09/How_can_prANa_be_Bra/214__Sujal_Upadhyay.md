oh and yes, Jivanmukti Viveka, Panchadashi and Atmavidyavilas are indeed a
treasure house. I find svAtmanirupaNam and sadAchAra a good text to study.
sadAchAra of Chinmaya Mission in Hindi includes a translation of a Marathi
commentary originally composed in Ovi chanda. It is a treat to read.

I too am influenced by mAyA :)

"To disconnect from the self and to become Aware of anything else is
nothing but unhappiness" - Bhagawan Ramana Maharshi

He who has faith has all
He who lacks faith, lacks all
It is the faith int he name of lord that works wonders
FAITH IS LIFE, DOUBT IS DEATH - Sri Ramakrishna
