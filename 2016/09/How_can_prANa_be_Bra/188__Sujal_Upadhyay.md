praNAms Sri Raghav ji,

You said: On a lighter note - Given the bout of 'authenticitis' that is
prevalent on
the list can we say that the yoga upaniShads have been 'authenticated' by
the fact the muktikopaniShad lists them. I am under the impression that the
dakShiNAmnAya tradition accepts yoga upaniShads.

nArAyaNa tirtha wrote dipikA-s on them.
