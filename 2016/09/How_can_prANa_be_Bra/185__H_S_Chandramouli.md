Sri Ravi Kiran Ji,



Reg  << Have you come across any references from bhAshya on the second
type..? >>,



Specifically the word जीवन्मुक्त (jIvanmukta) appears in the Bhashya in
only one place BG 6-27 ब्रह्मभूतं जीवन्मुक्तम्, ‘ब्रह्मैव सर्वम्’ इत्येवं
निश्चयवन्तं ब्रह्मभूतम्



(brahmabhUtaM jIvanmuktam, ‘brahmaiva sarvam’ ityevaM nishchayavantaM
brahmabhUtam)



(brahmabhUtam, also termed jIvanmuktam,  one who has the conviction that
everything is Brahman only).



This is in the context of the result accruing to one who has attained the
second type. However there are other references in the Bhashya concerning
the second type while referring to the sAdhanas takenup for achieving this
state. For example BU4-5-1/2,4-5-15 ( Yagnavalkya leaving for
sanyAsa),3-5-1(kahola brahmana). These are cited by Swami Vidyaranya. He
quotes extensively from the Srutis जाबालोपनिषत् (jAbAlopaniShat) and
परमहम्सोपनिषत्  (paramahamsopaniShat) for which as you very well know Sri
Bhagavatpada has not written BhAshya, as well as many Smrutis for his stand.




Also Sri Bhagavatpada has dealt with the subject of जीवन्मुक्त (jIvanmukta)
extensively in Viveka Chudamani.



Pranams and Regards
