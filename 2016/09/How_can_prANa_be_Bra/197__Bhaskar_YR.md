Attaining the ekatva jnana is something different from 'experiencing' that same ekatva jnana, like knowledge about swimming and practically swimming in the water

> To strengthen the above line of thinking some advaitins would say that scriptures (shAstra) are just like an instruction manual and knowledge obtained from it needs to be put into test in the  'lab'.  According to them there is a difference between two stages i.e. vijnAna (theoretical knowledge of scriptures) and 'prajnA ( practically experiencing the theoretical knowledge of scriptures).  Hence there is terminology like Atma sAkshAtkAra, AtmAvagati, Atma darshana etc.  Ofcourse these developments are based on shruti vAkya 'vijnAya prajnAm kurveeta' from bruhadaaraNyaka.  It is because of this reason in the prakaraNa grantha like  viveka chudaamaNi and others, experiencing the nirvikalpa samAdhi has been given utmost importance.  

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
