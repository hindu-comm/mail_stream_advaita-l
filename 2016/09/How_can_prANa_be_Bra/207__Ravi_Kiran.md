Even if one, after attaining jnAna and isolates oneself from all
activities, to practically all the time
enjoy the “bliss of Brahman”, how is it possible to not allow the arising
of any vRttis ( pain or sorrow or any other ),
when the physical form itself is subjected to illness or pain to the point
that, one is no longer able to perform any of
the vAsanAkShaya or manonAsha (or samAdhi) practices ?
