Sri Sujal Ji,

Am I correct in my understanding of your post that what you are postulating
as moksha is as per yoga darshana and not as per vedanta (advaita)
darshana. If yes I have no comments. Or are you contending that it is as
per vedanta darshana. In which case of course I have to disagree. I will
wait for your response.

Pranams and Regards
