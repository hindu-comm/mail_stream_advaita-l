I have not followed this thread thoroughly.  Yet, going by the title of the
thread, I would like to share this:

In the Māndukya bhashya Shankara says: 1.karika 2 bhashyam:

यद्यपि प्राणाभिमाने सति व्याकृततैव प्राणस्य ; तथापि
पिण्डपरिच्छिन्नविशेषाभिमाननिरोधः प्राणे भवतीत्यव्याकृत एव प्राणः सुषुप्ते
परिच्छिन्नाभिमानवताम् । यथा प्राणलये परिच्छिन्नाभिमानिनां प्राणोऽव्याकृतः,
तथा प्राणाभिमानिनोऽप्यविशेषापत्तावव्याकृतता समाना, प्रसवबीजात्मकत्वं च ।
तदध्यक्षश्चैकोऽव्याकृतावस्थः । परिच्छिन्नाभिमानिनामध्यक्षाणां च
तेनैकत्वमिति पूर्वोक्तं विशेषणमेकीभूतः प्रज्ञानघन इत्याद्युपपन्नम् ।
तस्मिन्नेतस्मिन्नुक्तहेतुसत्त्वाच्च । कथं प्राणशब्दत्वमव्याकृतस्य ? ‘
प्राणबन्धनं हि सोम्य मनः’ (छा. उ. ६-८-२)

श्रुतेः । ननु, तत्र ‘सदेव सोम्य’ (छा. उ. ६-२-१)
<http://advaitasharada.sringeri.net/php/format.php?bhashya=Chandogya&page=06#Ch_C06_S02_V01>
इति
प्रकृतं सद्ब्रह्म प्राणशब्दवाच्यम् ; नैष दोषः, बीजात्मकत्वाभ्युपगमात्सतः ।
यद्यपि सद्ब्रह्म प्राणशब्दवाच्यं तत्र, तथापि जीवप्रसवबीजात्मकत्वमपरित्यज्यैव
प्राणशब्दत्वं सतः सच्छब्दवाच्यता च ।

Here Shankara says that prāṇa is a term used to denote the avyākṛta (māyā).
There is a reference in the Ch..up. to show that the Brahman where the jiva
rests in deep sleep and pralya is not the Nirguna Brahman but the avyākṛta,
that is, tinged Brahman. It is from this that jivas come back from sleep
and in new srishti.

There is also the case of Brahman being referred to as Prāṇa in the
Prashnopanishat. But that will take a detailed study of all the prashnas to
appreciate this.
