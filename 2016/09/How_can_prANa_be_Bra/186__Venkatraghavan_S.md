Namaste Sri Ravi Kiran ji,

In addition to the references provided by Sri Chandramouliji a description
of a jIvan mukta's life (sthita prajna) is provided in Bhagavat Gita
2.55-2.57 and it's bhAshya.

The reasons why the body continues to exist (conventionally) for a jIvan
mukta are discussed in Brahma Sutra 4.1.15 and the related Chandogya
6.14.2.

Katha 2.3.14 (अत्र ब्रहम समश्नुते) and it's bhAshya is often cited as a
pramANa for jIvan mukti but it's only a brief reference.

Regards,
Venkatraghavan
