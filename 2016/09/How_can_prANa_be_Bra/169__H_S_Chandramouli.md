Sri Sujal Ji,



Pranams.



In advaita sidhanta, there are two paths available for attaining “moksha”
(liberation from embodiment). One is krama mukti . The sadhaka attains
Brahmaloka at the end of  the current birth on satisfactory completion of
the prescribed sadhanas from where he attains “moksha” through jnana at the
end of the kalpa. But he has no other transmigration. This is the only path
available for attaining “moksha” through any path other than through jnana.
There are several sadhanas available including prana upasana,pranavopasana
( considering pranava as a pratika ) etc.



The second  path is through attaining jnana hereitself, in the current
birth itself. For such a sadhaka there is no further  transmigration (after
the fall of the current body) including to Brahmaloka.



Pranams and Regards
