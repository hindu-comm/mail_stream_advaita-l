Namaste Sri Chandramouliji,

Yes, your post was very useful indeed. Thank you.

Another useful source of information is Swami Paramarthananda's 2015 Guru
Purnima talk which was a high level analysis of the text in question, Jivan
Mukti Viveka. I think several of these issues are touched upon.

Regards,
Venkatraghavan
