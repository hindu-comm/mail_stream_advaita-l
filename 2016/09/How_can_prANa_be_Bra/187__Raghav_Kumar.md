Namaste Sri Venkatraghavan ji

You had written - 'For such people, nidhidhyAsanam  (yoga-based
vedAnta nidhidhyAsanam)  can be helpful to get rid of notions of viparIta
bhAvana, through a process of mithyAtva nishchaya.'

Just to clarify - can we say nidhidhyasana is necessarily yoga-based? ( the
pratyaya-ekatAnatA in such yoga-based nidhidhyasana would presumably be the
shabda-pramANa prApta jnAna vRtti without phalavyApti etc. Such a
restriction can arguably make the practice different from manolaya or even
the standard pAtanjala samAdhyabhyAsa in both of which there is little
scope for vedAnta-pramANa-vyApAra. )

Is there any non-yoga-based nidhidhyAsana which would be discernibly
different from the first type mentioned in the previous para?

(One could perhaps adopt a 'result-oriented' approach to what constitutes
nidhidhyAsana and say that whatever practice weakens or removes viparItA
bhAvanA-s is nidhidhyAsana. In such a 'liberal' definition of
nidhidhyAsana,  other non-yoga-based practices which deliver the goods
could also come under the ambit of nidhidhyAsana. I have not come across
any textual references related to such a putative non-yoga based
nidhidhyAsana. But it does sound plausible.)

Om
Raghav

P.S.
'This is where I differ from
the various yogic upanishads you quote that cite the requirement for jnAna
and yoga.'

On a lighter note - Given the bout of 'authenticitis' that is prevalent on
the list can we say that the yoga upaniShads have been 'authenticated' by
the fact the muktikopaniShad lists them. I am under the impression that the
dakShiNAmnAya tradition accepts yoga upaniShads.
Namaste Sri Ravi Kiran ji,

In addition to the references provided by Sri Chandramouliji a description
of a jIvan mukta's life (sthita prajna) is provided in Bhagavat Gita
2.55-2.57 and it's bhAshya.

The reasons why the body continues to exist (conventionally) for a jIvan
mukta are discussed in Brahma Sutra 4.1.15 and the related Chandogya
6.14.2.

Katha 2.3.14 (अत्र ब्रहम समश्नुते) and it's bhAshya is often cited as a
pramANa for jIvan mukti but it's only a brief reference.

Regards,
Venkatraghavan
