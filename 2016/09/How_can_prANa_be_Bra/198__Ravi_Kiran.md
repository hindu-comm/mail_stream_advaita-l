would be interested to hear if one, after having attained ekatva jnAna from
Sruti shravanAdi sAdhana and later took recourse to Yogic samAdhi practices
(why?) and having to experience Atma sAkshAtkAra or AtmAvagati or Atma
darshana in nirvikalpaka samAdhi and if one can share the similarity or
contrast (difference) with the ekatva Atma jnAna attained earlier, from
one's very own experience, in one's very own words ..?

I am sure, many on this list here would be interested to hear such
experiences directly from a living Yogi...

Thanks
