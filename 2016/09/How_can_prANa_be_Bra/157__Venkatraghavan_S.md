Namaste Sujal ji,

//Without any desires and
thoughts, there is no mind. Hence mind too is destroyed. This results into
permanent abiding in Brahman//

Just so that it is clear to me, are you saying that the yogic process of
"destruction of the mind" is the only way for permanent abidance in
Brahman, or moksha?
You also say:
//If it is not free then Brahman will become bound
and Atman or Brahman can be realised only be karma and not GYAna (Jnana).//

So it appears to me you agree that Brahman can be realised through jnAna
alone, not karma. How does that reconcile with the yogic process you
outline above - which is certainly not jnAna.

What pramANa is being used to generate jnAna in the yogic process? None of
the six pramANas are being invoked in samAdhi or in the destruction of
vAsanAs through the process you describe.

In fact if the mind itself is resolved in nirvikalpa samAdhi, there is no
pramAta even, so how can jnAna be generated then without a pramAta or a
pramANa?

So jnAna isn't the cause for abidance in Brahman. How can you agree then
that moksha is attained through jnAna  alone?

Or are you saying that abidance in Brahman is not moksha?

Regards,
Venkatraghavan

Dear,
You got me wrong.
Brahman is pure awareness, is beyond mAyA. jIva is reflection of this
Brahman. I explained the process how one consciousness manifests into many
via different types of prANa-s. These prANa-s and then spread through body
through nADI-s and make sensation possible.

During yoga, the reverse is followed. prANa-s merge into Atman.

When this happens, one is not aware of body anymore and enters nirvikalp
samAdhi. This is breathless pulseless state - the nirvikalp samAdhi.

But we are not able to stay rooted in Brahman permanently due to presence
of past vAsanA-s and karma-s. Hence consciousness re-enters into body and
again this process of manifestation happens. when prANa again splits into
many and spreads across the whole body, body begins to function.

Consciousness, as Brahman or when realised as Brahman, is always
independent entity. What I am talking about is that in Yoga, Atman (jIva)
merges into Brahman via the above mentioned process and then again reenters
into body to expatiate past karma and vAsanA-s. This goes on and on until
all desires, which are in mind are destroyed. Without any desires and
thoughts, there is no mind. Hence mind too is destroyed. This results into
permanent abiding in Brahman, which is pure consciousness beyond mAyA. some
believe that one does not experience nivikalp samAdhi unless all desires
and so mind is destroyed. Once one experiences Brahman, he/she permanently
abides in it. There is no coming back. - However this is a wrong notion.
One enters into samAdhi, again returns back to dual plane, then mind
creates thoughts, and desires, thoughts and desires are uprooted to
contemplation on Brahman or by Yogic process, mind calms down, again enters
into samAdhi, is again pulled back in dual plane as there are still some
vAsanA-s left ... this goes on and on until mind is completely destroyed.

Body is always lifeless. It is a tool to progress spiritually. Even dead
body has eyes, but it does not have vision. This vision is ability to see
things. 5 senses lie inside mind. Mind along with 5 senses transmigrate
from one body to another.

If there is no consciousness in body, then even if you pierce a sharp
object in eye, dead person does not react.

Consciousness, is always free and untouched by mAyA. But this has to be
realised. Once this is realised, everything else becomes mithyA, not real.
One detaches oneself from all that is not Self. Only when jIva takes
ownership of all the karma-s, becomes kartA and bhoktA. It is this
consciousness that cannot at will leave physical body. However great yogi-s
can leave their physical body and travel in subtle worlds and can even
transmigrate into another body. shAstra-s too say that consciousness
(Brahman) is always free. If it is not free then Brahman will become bound
and Atman or Brahman can be realised only be karma and not GYAna (Jnana).

Are you getting it?
