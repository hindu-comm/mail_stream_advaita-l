Namste Ravi ji,

*If the mind is completely destroyed (as per Yoga, as you mention above),
body should also drop at that moment..
then there is no more jIva bhAv left or coming back to dual plane any more..

Yes. As per Sri Ramakrishna, if one constantly abides in nievikalp samadhi,
then body will drop permanently. there is no return of consciousness.

Different types of nirvikalp samadhi-s are explained in 'Yoga,
enlightenment and Perfection - Life of Sri Abhinav Vidyateertha Mahaswami'

(I am quoting from memory.)

1. Seeker stay in Nirvikalp samAdhi only for limited time and returns back
- Still in meditative state
2. Seeker can come back to dual plane one its own (dont know how it happens)
3. Guru is required to bring down consciousness of disciple, else
consciousness will not return back on its own
4. samAdhi is so strong (ghADha) that not even guru can bring back
consciousness of his disciple back in the body. The connection with body is
broken permanently.

In the book only three types (from #2 - 4) are mentioned.

Only when some work is to be assigned by god, most of people do not return
and find no need to return back to body consciousness. For most seekers it
is one way trip.

Sri Venkatraghavan ji,

I was told that one has to experience two spiritual state to be free. these
two can be experienced in any order.

1. nirvikalp samAdhi (Brahma satya jagat mithyA)
2. sarvam khalu-idam-brahman (sarvAtma bhAva)

In case of Jnani, one experiences i.e. enters into nirvikalp samAdhi and
after meditation is over i.e. all thoughts and desires are destroyed, mind
transforms into Brahman itself. Sri Ramana Maharshi says, Mind of Jnani is
Brahman itself. One experiences that all this is Brahman. Then one is free

In case of Yogi, it is the opposite. Mind merges into infinite Brahman
experiences sarvAtmabhAva. Then it transcends this bhAva also and enters
into nirvikalp samAdhi.

Both are needed to be called as jivan mukta.

Alternatively, I have been told that if one manages to contemplate on
Brahman when one is dying, there is no rebirth either.

Kind Regards

OM
