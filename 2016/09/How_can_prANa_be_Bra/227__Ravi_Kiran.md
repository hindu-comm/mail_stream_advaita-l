Since you consider Yogic practice as a preparatory means before taking up
jnAna sAdhana, with jnAna, mind or no mind (samAdhi anubhava) should not
matter at all, as there is nothing apart from Brahman. i.e there is no more
effort required to destroy the mind ( through Yoga) after jnAna utpatti, as
Brahman is nitya prApti.
