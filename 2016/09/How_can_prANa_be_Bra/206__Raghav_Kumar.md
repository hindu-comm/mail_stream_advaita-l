Posted wrongly on the other thread - There is the other option i did not
consider in my earlier post viz., goal 1 of jnAnam and goal 2 of
'not-transposing-sorrow-vRttis occurring in the mind upon oneself which may
destabilise the jnAnam' are not necessary concomittants. They don't
necessarily go together always. In this option the idea of avidyAbIja
persisting has to be addressed. My understanding is that in this case we
have to qualify the word jnAnam with words like sapratibandhaka etc.
