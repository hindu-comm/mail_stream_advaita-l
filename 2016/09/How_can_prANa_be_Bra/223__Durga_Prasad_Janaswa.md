Hari Om,
Namaste.

For a GYaanI, mind is bAdhita/ mithyaa since it is also a part of jagat.

A GYaanI never identifies with any mind.  If GYaanI sees the mind in a
happy or sorrow state ,  GYaanI only  smiles at mind and says hi, here goes
the mind in happy / sorrow mode based on its  past saMskaara.

regards
