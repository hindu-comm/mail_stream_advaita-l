self. Knowing the self (1) means that one does not take the mind to be the
self, thereby falsely superimposing attributes of the mind onto the self,
or adhyAsa (2) . jnAna acquisition leads to adhyAsa removal.

However getting jnAna does not necessarily mean that sorrow / delusion in
the mind is never experienced. Therefore, my contention is that Swami
VidyAraNya was advocating vAsanAkshaya as a means of training the mind to
react better to external circumstances that disturb it. When this training
is done, the mind is calm more often than not, allowing for svarUpa Ananda
to be reflected in it and experiencing bliss (pratibimba Ananda), more
often than not.

Does it mean that a jnAni never feels pain or sorrow - no, it only means
that, on the whole, he experiences bliss. However, and this is the part
that is relevant to moksha, he never transfers any experiential bliss or
experiential sorrow onto himself and says "I am blissful" or "I am in pain".

Regards,
Venkatraghavan
