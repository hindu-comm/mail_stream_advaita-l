//Yes, advaita way is pure and direct way. there is no need of any other
means *if* one is able to contemplate on Brahman with ease.//

But this is precisely the point sir. Brahman is never an object of
contemplation - it is not something that one contemplates "on" - it is the
one contemplating! That is why the Upanishad uses elliptical language to
describe Brahman, in order to stop the mind's tendency to objectify and
conceptualise! (नाहं मन्ये सुवेदेति,  etc.)

Whatever is experienced is never an attribute of the experiencer, it as an
attribute of the experienced. If the mind experiences bliss in samAdhi,
such a bliss is located in the mind and it is an experiential, reflected
koshAnanda, and not the non-experienceable AtmAnanda.

Coming to your comment on bhoga, even if the experience of koshAnanda is
what is desired, the Upanishad says the means to experience all the bliss
of all the words (सोsश्नुते सर्वान् कामान् सह) is by vairAgya born out of
viveka, wisdom (श्रोत्रियस्य चाकमहतस्य)

Regards,
Venkatraghavan
