praNAms SrI Chandramouli ji,

Why the final goal has to be jivanmukta and not moksha. Why does it matter
if you get moksha while still in physical body or at the time of death?

A person may have two approaches or wishes
1. This is my last birth
2. This is my last death

btw, just for curiosity, does this discussion related to the thread topic
i.e. How can prANa be Brahman.
I understand that at the end, it is GYAna that leads to moksha, be it any
way.

Hari OM
Sujal
