All exercise by the intellect (kutarka? :) in seeding bhEda (by drawing
analogy from vyavahArika examples, which may seem convincing to a gullible
intellect :) in That (paramArtha) which is svarUpataha abhEda , is an
attempt to distance the embracing/acceptance of this simple effortless
undeniable Truth (aham brahma asmi), experienced always by all, in all 3
periods of time ( as revealed by the Sruti maha vAkyas like tat tvam asi
...)
