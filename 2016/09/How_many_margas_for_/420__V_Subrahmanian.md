Shankara has, in several places in the BGB, hastened to clarify that
wherever the ideas like 'by bhakti I am attained' etc., it is
'jñānalakṣaṇayā bhaktyā'.  One can verify this by giving a search in the
Advaitasharada resource. This qualification is required to avoid any wrong
conclusion that bhakti is a separate path.
