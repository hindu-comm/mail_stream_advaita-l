praNAms Sri Kathirasan prabhuji
Hare Krishna

Yes, as you have rightly observed there is no two mArga-s for mukti, for that matter shruti itself denies the second possibility of mukti apart from jnAnam.  nAnyaH panthA ayanAya vidyate.  However, to pursue this jnana mArga first we have to get chitta shuddhi and this chitta shuddhi can be developed through nishkAma nitya naimittika karmAnushTAna.  So we do need nishkAma karmAnushtAna prior to jnana mArga.   Shankara clarifies this in sUtra bhAshya by saying though nishkAma nitya naimittika karmAnushtAna is not direct means to mOksha it would be required for chitta shuddhi and to develop jnana which ultimately results in mOksha.  More details can be had with regard to this from shankara's sarvApekshAdhikaraNa sUtra bhAshya in 3rd adhyAya.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar

Subject: Re: [Advaita-l] How many margas for mukti

Namaste Kripaji,

It is not that there are two margas to multi. But rather two margas live your life in this world. The Jnana yoga is meant for the contemplative people who are competent for Moksha. And the Karma marga is for those who do not wish for moksha but prefer the path of pravrtti. These two do not mix and hence Shankara does not favour jnanakarmasamuccaya. But there is a hybrid path advocated by Vyasa through the Bhagavad Gita which is Karma Yoga.
