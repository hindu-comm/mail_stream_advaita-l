There is only path and that is jnAna. Even that is not a path per se, as
there is no distance to be traversed, only wrong notions to be refuted with
right knowledge.

Karma is not an alternative to jnAna, but a preparatory step in the
journey. By karma both the ritualistic aspects (karma) as well as the
meditative aspects (upAsana) are included.

I noticed that another member mentioned karma yoga as a hybrid - to
clarify, this means doing karma giving up the desire for results as an
offering to the Lord and with a mindset to accept any outcome as His
blessing. Such a performance of karma serves to purify the organs of
knowledge to enable one to gain knowledge and enjoy it's benefit.

It should not be understood that what Shankara was talking about is any
different from what Krishna and VyasAchArya spoke in the Gita. It is very
much the same message.

In advaita, bhakti is the attitude with which one performs the karma. What
the target of bhakti is, depends on the maturity of the worshipper. It can
be an ishTa devata, vishvarUpa Ishvara or the self.

The Gita talks of four kinds of bhaktas - Arta, arthArthi, jijnAsu and
jnAni. The first worships God to protect them from distress, the second to
gain something materially, the third to gain self-knowledge and the last,
having gained knowledge, worships the self as God.

Bhakti is therefore not an alternative to karma, it is a key component for
the first three categories of bhakta. For the last category of jnAni
bhakta, bhakti is not allied to karma, but is sva-svarUpa anusandhAnam, it
is jnAna itself.

Venkatraghavan
