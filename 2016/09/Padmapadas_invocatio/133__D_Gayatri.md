//While* that* Lord Shiva was donning the ashes, *this*, Shankaracharya, is
bereft of the vibhūti called aishvarya: aishvaryalakshanavibhūti vidhuraḥ.
Anyone with elementary Sanskrit knowledge will be able to see this. //

You can check the commentary. Or readers can check the commentary
themselves to see who is misinterpreting things. Commentary does not use
"vibhUti" but "bhUti". The commentary is saying he is devoid of wealth and
ashes. bhUti is given the meaning of bhasitam, or ashes, by the commentary
itself.

//That differentiation is only for the purpose of showing that the Original
Lord Shiva alone has incarnated as Shankaracharya. //

This is probably the most disingenuous (mis) interpretation that I have
seen. This, when the commentator is explicitly saying that he is
differentiating the prasiddha Shankara and Adi Shankara.

I have presented my case and have no further comments to add. Readers are
free to verify the link to the commentaries in Sanskrit.
