Excellent explanation by Sri Subramanian ji. While the word bhUti refers to
bhasma in the context of Lord Shiva, it is the absence of bhUtiH or outer
wealth in the case of Sankara bhagavatpAda. (nirastabhUtiH)

The wellknown verse from muNDaka clarifies this further
Atmajnam ki arcayed bhUtikAmaH meaning 'may the one who seeks bhUtiH or
worldly wealth worship the knower of the Self'.  (Although funnily some
godmen do dispense bhUtiH or ashes too!! )

The last two posts by Sri Subramaniam ji and word by word clear explanation
by Sri Venkataraghavan ji clinch the issue. We can say conclusively that
shri padmapAda was comparing his guru to Lord Shiva.

We should thank the narayanastra blogspot for highlighting this shloka.

Om

Esp. as seen in the verse
