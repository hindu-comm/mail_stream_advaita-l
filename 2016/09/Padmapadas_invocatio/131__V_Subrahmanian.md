The above is a patently wrong translation of the commentary. The correct
translation is:

While* that* Lord Shiva was donning the ashes, *this*, Shankaracharya, is
bereft of the vibhūti called aishvarya: aishvaryalakshanavibhūti vidhuraḥ.
Anyone with elementary Sanskrit knowledge will be able to see this.

No. Only the first commentary suggests that and the second never says that
and that too as an alternative.

That differentiation is only for the purpose of showing that the Original
Lord Shiva alone has incarnated as Shankaracharya. That vailaksanya is also
only done when the two individuals have something in common.  Here both
Shiva and Shankara are one entity but only appearing in different forms.
While so incarnating Shiva alone is found here without what he is found in
Kailasa.

This conclusion is wrong.

A human, Shankara Acharya or anyone, can be compared with God only when
there is a very special accomplishment with that human.  Just because two
individualṣ share the same name that does not warrant a
comparison/contrast.

We have examples of Vāchaspati Misra being compared to Brahmā, Vācaspati,
by Amalananda in the Kalpataru.  There too there is the double meaning:
Misra is such an accomplished scholar that he is a god among all other
scholars, vibudhāḥ (which also means gods).

We have another famous case of Vidyaranya in the Mādhaviya Shankara Vijayam
where he says: Lord Shiva, gave up the Mouna (Dakshinamurti) Silence and
the abode under the Banyan Tree and came down to the earth as
Shankaracharya (to speak, write etc.)

Thus, only when an extraordinary accomplishment is seen in a human a
comparison with God is made.  That is what is made by Padmapada and
Sureshwara.  Everyone knows, without being informed specially, that the
name 'Shankara' is a name of Lord Shiva. Yet, Sureshwara says twice that
Shankara bears the name of Lord Shiva only to signify that he is an
incarnation.
