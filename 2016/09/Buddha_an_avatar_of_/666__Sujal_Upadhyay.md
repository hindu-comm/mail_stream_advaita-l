praNAms Sri Kripa ji,

As I understand, Buddha was considered as an avatAra of viShNu i.e. amongst
24 avatAr-s. What you say is found in purANa-s, but this is probably an
interpolation. viShNu avatAra deluding asura-s and leading them to
non-vedic path was not alteast on this earth. It was a plan to end the
tripura, three planets of iron, silver and gold. Siva was given task to
destroy all three. They all needed to be destroyed in one hit. So all
deva-s helped them in achieving this task. Some became chariot, some
wheels, some bow and viShNu seated on the tip of arrow. Siv awaited for all
three planets aligning in straight line and then he destroyed them. Siva is
also called as tripurArI / tripurAntak. Since one cannot destroy when
anyone is on dhArmic path, but later they developed an ego and used to
attack deva-s. Hence, first step was to lead them astray from vedic life,
then attack them to establish justice.

In Thirumandiram, it is said - Who said Siva destroyed three cities. They
were 3 bodies, gross, subtle and casual i.e. annamaya, manomaya and
viGYAnamaya.

I do not know the authenticity of a Buddhist Text called Sutta NipaTa, but
there it is said that Buddha didnt completely disregarded varNa dharma and
vedic lifestyle. If a Brahmin is leading a pure life and is noy a
hypocryte, then one can give him alms, donations and such a person deserves
respect.

Further, the names of all ancient characters are karma based. their birth
names are not popular. For example, duryodhan is actually suyoddhA,
dushAshana was named sushAshana. So the name Buddha means bodha i.e. Atma
bodha i.e. GYAna. I really doubt that such interpolation is due to vested
interest.

Surely the Buddha, who is founder of Buddhisn, is not the same Buddha who
lead asura-s astray from vedic life.

I would like to wait for others opinion.
