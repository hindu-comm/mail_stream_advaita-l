Great summary, Subramanianji!

Could you also put up your thoughts on the famed yascandasaam vrishabho..
mantra of the Taittiriya Upanishad?

Also, could you throw some light on how and why this mantra is said to have
a positive impact on rentention (memory)?

Thank you in advance.

Best wishes,

Kartik Kunchi
