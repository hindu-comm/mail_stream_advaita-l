Namaste

There is a book by Candrakirti - A refutation of Self in Indian
Buddhism. If he is saying there is no Self in persons how can it be
like Vedanta? It is in Google books and Amazon.

You can deny Self in everything like Devas, Gandharvas, men and
animals but how can you deny Self in the Observer? In Advaita also in
Eka Jeeva Vaada we can deny Self in external things and persons but we
cannot deny Self in the person doing the thinking. He must have a Self
to realize. Otherwise what is there to be done in this life? If
everything is a Dream there is a Dreamer. He must have a Self.
