PraNAms
Just from my understanding.
aham brahmaasmi- and tat tvam asi - are not there in any other scriptures other than in the Upanishad. That reduces to1. Brahma satyam2. Jagat mithyaa3. aham brahmaasmiIf this is taught any way, then the mission is accomplished and that is the right teaching and the source of info. 
Hence Vedanta to be understand as the ultimate veda or knowledge. 

Logically one cannot establish aham brahmaasmi. which Madhyamika rests.naishaa tarken..

Namaste
Can we say that the अौपनिष्दं पुरुषं was likely to have been taught by at
least some of the माध्यमिक Buddhists? The similarities are there - such as
different orders of Reality etc. This would have been discussed before. But

My question is a more general one -
1. Can the content of advaita be unfolded and taught without explicit
references to shruti and bhAShya? Say in some other language...

2. What would be the key ideas which would have to be present in such an
unfoldment or pedagogy? (I was having in mind ideas like multiple orders
of Reality, importance of a prepared mind etc.)

3. We have the well-known vArtika saying that there maybe an endless number
of prakriyAs to unfold the truth. But what exactly constitutes a sadhu
prakriya and how may we discern an asAdhu prakriya?
For example, suppose a prakriya smartly (?) says that nirvisheSha brahman
alone is the paramArthika satyam , is it enough? Even if such a prakriya
says that vishnu alone is Ishvara as far as vyavahAra is concerned . ( this
is only an example i am considering and the specifics have already been
discussed 'threadbare' in a different thread.) This question of whether its
a sadhu prakriya or not applies to even the mAdyamika prakriyA lets say as
taught in the mUlamAdhyamika kArikA.
