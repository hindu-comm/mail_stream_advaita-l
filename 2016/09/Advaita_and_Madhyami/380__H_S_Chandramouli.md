Namaste Sri Raghav Ji.



If we are talking of realizing the ultimate goal as per advaita sidhanta
which I think is what you are meaning by quoting Sri Sureswaracharya, and
not just gaining academic knowledge, it is to be recognized that the srutis
prescribe specific methodology for the same. For example the aspirant
should be sAdhanachatushtayasampannah. Shravana,manana and nididhyasana
under a Guru (whose qualifications also are prescribed) are mandatory.
These preclude most of the alternatives suggested by you like learning in
some other language, other schools of thought, some other pramAna etc.  What
Sri Sureswaracharya whom you have quoted is suggesting is permissibility of
alternatives in respect of details (like
pratibimbavAda,AbhAsavAda,avachEdavAda etc) for defining jiva,iswara etc
within advaita sidhanta as explained by Sri Bhagavatpada. This is not to be
interpreted as allowing for wholly different darshanas like budhism, or
even vishishtadvaita and dvaita as broughtout by Sri Ravi Kiran Ji.
