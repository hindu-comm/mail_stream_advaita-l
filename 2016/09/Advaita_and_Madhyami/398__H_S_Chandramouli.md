Namaste Sri Venkatraghavan Ji.



Reg  <<  However I am not trying to compare Madhayamaka Buddhism with
Advaita. Only wondering if that school has been adequately considered and
rebutted in advaita. >>,



Considerable attention has been devoted to refute Yogachara or VignanavAda
Budhism  view on shUnyatva of external objects in Vedantic literature.
Since Madhyamika Budhism only adds on to this shUnyatva view of Yogachara
Budhism by claiming shUnyatva for self also (who is the inquirer), perhaps
it was felt by the vedantins that no separate refutation is called for in
respect of Madhyamika Budhism. It stands refuted automatically with the
refutation of Yogachara Budhism.
