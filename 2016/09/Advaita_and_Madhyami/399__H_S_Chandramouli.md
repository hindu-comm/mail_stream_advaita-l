Namaste Sri Venkatraghavan Ji,



In continuation to previous post,  After refuting vijnanavAda, the bhashya
on 4-28 in Mandukya has this to say



<< येऽपि शून्यवादिनः पश्यन्त एव सर्वशून्यतां स्वदर्शनस्यापि शून्यतां
प्रतिजानते, ते ततोऽपि साहसिकतराः खं मुष्टिनापि जिघृक्षन्ति ॥ >>



<< ye.api shUnyavAdinaH pashyanta eva sarvashUnyatAM svadarshanasyApi
shUnyatAM pratijAnate, te tato.api sAhasikatarAH khaM muShTinApi
jighRRikShanti || >>



Translation by Swami Gambhirananada << As for the nihilists, who, while
perceiving the nonexistence of everything, assert therebythe voidness of
their own philosophy, they are even bolder than the idealist (footnote; it
is through perception that the all-round voidness is proved. But how will
perception itself be annulled? Not that perception can annihilate itself,
for the simple reason that perception and its negation cannot coexist.
Besides, if you talk of absolute nihilism, you affirm the non-existence of
your own view as well), in as much as  they want to have the sky itself in
their grasp >>
