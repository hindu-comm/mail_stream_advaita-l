Doesn't this sound more like our definition of सदसद्भ्याम् अनिर्वचनीया माया
than ब्रह्म?! Since you clarify that the Buddhist definition of existence
is different, still I think Madhyamika calls it a dependent existence.

Where does this leave us? Essentially the sense I get of Nagarjuna's

I think the crucial difference may be in the fact that "no denial of the
self"  is a lot different from "affirmation of the self". Two Shruti
statements come to mind, one being असन्नेव स भवति and अस्तीत्येव
उपलब्धव्यः। Even for परोक्षज्ञान, affirmation/conviction that there is an
existent entity beyond time and space is necessary. I remember reading the
refutation of Buddhism (Vijnanavada I suppose) long back in
Gambhiranandaji's translation of Brahma Sutras that Bhashyakara says
against shUnyatA so: with shUnya, how does karma (which Buddhists too
believe in) continue from one thing to another? To that the Buddhist says,
there may be something that holds it or something to that effect.
Bhashyakara says that if you agree there *is* something, it amounts to
saying the same existence that we talk of and then, we don't have any
arguments with you! I can't recall the reference now, maybe people with the
know-how can add and/or correct the same please.

I doubt that this could be the case. Most of the refutation of Buddhism was
also done by other Astika darshanas. Uttaramimamsa added over and above it.

Kind rgds,
