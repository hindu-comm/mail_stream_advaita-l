Namaste Chandramouliji,
I agree on both points -
1) that by dealing with Yogachara, we have also dealt with shUnyavAda also.
However in dealing with the former we have focused on the evidence of
reality of objects as provided by pratyaksham and the implausibility of
kshaNikatva vAda, rather than a direct refutation of shUnyatva per se (I am
referring to the Brahma Sutra 2.2). Notwithstanding these, your point
stands.
2) that shUnyavAdins in arguing for the shUnyatva of everything are also
agreeing to the shUnyatva of their own theory. The emptiness of emptiness
is how it is characterized and accepted by them too. However it's reality
is a dependent one, like everything else in their system. They don't
require a satya adhishthAna to a mithyA vastu, just interdependence with
another mithyA vastu.

Regards,
Venkatraghavan
