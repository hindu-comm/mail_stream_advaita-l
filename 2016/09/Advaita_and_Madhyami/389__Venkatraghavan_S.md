The meaning of antya pramANa is more profound than that sir. The bhAshya of
the yaa nishaa sloka goes into it a bit. What it means is that after jnAna,
the very pramAtritvam of the pramAta is destroyed. Hence there is no more
pramANa for such a one.

Also I didn't say that any text can do so. I said that any text that is
based on the veda, taught by a guru. Reading a novel that has the hero
saying I am Brahman, does not count :)

As I told Chandramouliji, I presented my views. You are welcome to disagree.

Regards,
Venkatraghavan
