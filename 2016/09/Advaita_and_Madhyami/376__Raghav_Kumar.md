I remember Sri Swami Dayananda Saraswati ji saying that anywhere in the
world in any language if the truth of nonduality viz., the oneness between
the individual and the Whole is taught, it is acceptable as advaita. This
is ofcourse unexceptionable.

My question is to understand what is the reasonable position when, although
there is acceptance of nirvisheSha brahman as paramArthasatyam, there is
divergence on other issues like
1. Ishvara is viShNu w.r.t. vyavahAra.
2. In another system, like mAdhyamika, Buddha is  omniscient. His words
have prAmANyam.
3. avidyA being abhAva rupa alone represents the true teaching of Sri
Shankara BhagavatpAda. Accordingly those who regard avidyA as bhAvarUpA
will not be able to attain nivRtti from avidyA.

Can we take some common minimum principles to be necessary or sufficient to
be counted as a sadhvI prakriyA of the advaita tradition ?
