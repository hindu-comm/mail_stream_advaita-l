Namaste
Sometime back there was a discussion for all to explain the daily
spiritual activities. But some people said if we tell others our
activities there will be a negative effect and we will stop doing it.
It has happened to some people. They are afraid if they give out all
the spiritiual activities they are doing they will stop them and it
will be bad for them.

But there is easy way to plan our activities. There is no secret to
keep. Kindly see Upadesha Panchakam -

Vedo nityamadheeyatham, tadhuditham karma swanushthiyatham,
Thenesasya vidheeyatham apachithi kamye mathisthyajyatham,
Papougha paridhooyatham bhava sukhe doshonusandheeyatham,
Athmecha vyavaseeyatham nijagruhathoornam vinirgamyatham. 1

The first line is saying study the Vedas everyday and do the Nitya
Karmas well. We should do the Karmas as offering to God and leave out
Karmas done with desire for something. We should cultivate desire for
Moksha by seeing the defects of Laukika enjoyments. At the ripe time
break attachment with home and family and take Sanyasa.

Meditation and OM chanting can be part of the daily routine but we
cannot give up the Nitya Karmas.
