There is no secret to share in Nitya Karmas. It is a standard list for all.

It is not correct to drop Agni karya and Karma Kanda. This is a wrong
interpretation of Advaita of Adi Sankara. In Karma Kanda there are
four types of Karmas. Nitya Karmas must always be done till Death or
you become Sanyasi. Naimittika Karmas must be done also when there is
some event like Upanayana. Kamya Karmas must be stopped. Nishiddha
Karmas must not be done.

If you reject entire Karma Kanda before Death or Sanyasa there will be
Pratyavaya Dosha.

Sandhyavandana is a very important Nitya Karma. All must do it with no
exception. I see from your name Upadhyay you are a Brahmin. Brahmins
must never never stop doing Sandhya vandana till death or till
Sanyasa.

Agni Karya is a daily fire ritual done by Brahmacharis and it is also
Nitya Karma only. Gruhasthas must do Aupasana fire ritual everyday.
Nitya Brahma Yajna is also another Nitya Karma.

In South India we get Nitya Karma books. We can learn from some
Brahmin how to do it after Upanayana and continue it with help of
books for remembering proper procedure. After practice all Mantras and
procedure will come automatically.

Study Vedas and Upanishads is also compulsory. Read some part of Veda
and Upanishad of your Veda Shakha daily. If you are Sukla Yajur Veda
Shakha read some portion of Brihadaranyaka every day with Sankara
Bhashya. If you are Krishna Yajur Veda Shakha read a portion of
Taittiriya Upanisad daily with Bhashya.

If you have time after Nitya Karmas you can go for Yoga, Meditation
and OM chanting. It is good only to do it. Nobody is saying it is bad.
But it should not be done thinking Nitya Karmas are not necessary and
skipping them.
