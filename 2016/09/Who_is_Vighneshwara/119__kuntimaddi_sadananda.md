PraNAms
Yes, Visvaksena is the commanding officer (Security chief) in charge of keeping all the disturbing forces away from the field of operation. 

The point is the invocation of the supreme in some form is done to remove the unsurmountable obstacles that may arise in the course of action. These obstacles can be aadibouthika, aadidaivaka and adhyaatmika types - Om shantiH, ShantiH, ShantiH. 

I see a lot of discussions is going on who is the supreme Shiva or Vishnu. There is a upanishad that describes Ganesha as supreme. 

All it means not to give importance to names and forms - but to the essence.
Hari Om!Sadananda

Vaishnavas replace Ganesha with Vishvaksena and claim that Ganesa is
one of the courtiers of Vishvaksena.
