Adding to the previously said points, Ganapati Atharva Sheersham -
http://www.vediccenterofgreenville.org/pdfs/ShriGanapatiPathan.pdf is a
vedic text referencing Ganapati. Yet another direct reference from the
Vedas showing the advaitic truth unequivocally, in the phrases

Tvameva Pratyaksham Tattvamasi
Tvam Saakshaad Aatmaasi nityam
Tvam Pratyaksham brahmaasi

Hamsah soham
