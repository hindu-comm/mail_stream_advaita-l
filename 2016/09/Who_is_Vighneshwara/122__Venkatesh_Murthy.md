Ganesha likes number 21. We have to offer 21 Modakas 21 leaves 21
Durva pairs and so on. If you look at 21 it is 2 followed by 1. 2 is
Dvaita and 1 is Advaita. Because Brahman in Advaita is Adviteeya.
There is no second but only One. From 2 we have to go to 1. This means
from Dvaita we are seeing in Vyavahara we have to go to Advaita the
Paramartha.

Therefore Ganesha is instructing us to go from the ordinary Vyavahara
world of Dvaita to the Paramartha Advaita.
