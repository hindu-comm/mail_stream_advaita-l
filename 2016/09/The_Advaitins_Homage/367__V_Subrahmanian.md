The Advaitin's Homage to the musical legend M.S.Subbulakshmi

Today is the birth Centenary of M.S.Subbulakshmi. Her service to Advaita
will be remembered forever as it was her voice that made Shankaracharya's
'Bhaja Govindam' a worldwide popular number.  Some other compositions of
Shankara also were rendered and immortalized by MS.

MS was deeply devoted to the Kanchi Paramacharya (Maha Periyava) and led a
very religious life with his guidance and blessings.

Here is a tribute from The Hindu to the Legend of Music:
