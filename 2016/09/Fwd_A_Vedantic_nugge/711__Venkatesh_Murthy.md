Namaste

There is a Vaakyaartha Goshthi video showing Advaita and Dvaita both
accept Deha-Atma Bheda.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbeDvGpHu7w  - Day 1
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRUAn0OeXEw - Day 2

But important point in Advaita is any Bheda is Vyavaharika only. There
is no Bheda and no Maayaa in Paramartha. Deha is a product of Maayaa.
Therefore it is also not there. Bheda itself is caused by Maayaa.
