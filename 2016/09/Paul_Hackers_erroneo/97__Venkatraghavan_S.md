You're right I had forgotten, thanks for pointing out. Just like the Ganges
flows back to Lord Vishnu's feet, this knowledge-Ganga leads to moksha, the
तत् विष्णोः परमं पदं of Katha Upanishad.

Regarding the upamAna prayoga, true that is there too and will be in any
poetic imagery, but it is important to note the reference to the
equivalence of Shankara with Lord Shiva in the writings of Shankara's
direct disciples. It being a poetic device does not preclude the existence
of the belief, it only strengthens it.

Regards,
Venkatraghavan
