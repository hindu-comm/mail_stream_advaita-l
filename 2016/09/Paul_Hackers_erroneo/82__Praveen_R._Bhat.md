Namaste Subbuji,

Thanks for bringing in an important point which I was planning to make
yesterday, but didn't because I had not read through all that was being
discussed. This is amiss in people who lack the background of such kAvya
composition or tarka basis. Even in vyAkaraNa sUtras, what is prApta alone
can be a candidate for consideration, be it negation or not. No one would
think that Shankaracharya is Shiva due to his name being similar, bringing
in the necessity of consideration or negation.

Kind rgds,
--Praveen R. Bhat
