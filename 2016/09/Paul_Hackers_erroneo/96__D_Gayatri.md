Two things I want to point out here -

1. You seem to have missed the reference to Vishnu completely in your
translation! The Ganga flows from the foot of Vishnu.

2. This is an upamAna and not an incarnation theory. If you believe
this is an incarnation theory, then Sureshwara would be the
incarnation of Bhagiratha!

Sureshwara describes Shankara as bearing the name of Shiva in his
Taittiriya vartika (bhava-nAma-bhRto-yateh, 3.10.48-49, reference,
Life and work of Shankaracharya, by Govind Chandra Pande). There is no
mention that Shankara is the incarnation of Shiva. Once again, there
is only a mention of similarity of names, but not identity.
