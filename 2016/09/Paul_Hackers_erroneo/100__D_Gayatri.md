Padmapada's invocation is not upamAna. It is double entendre. I don't know
what this is called in Sanskrit, but it is a brilliant device employed to
differentiate Shankara from Shiva. It also conclusively proves that
Shankara did not don bhasma.

Regarding Bhagiratha, he is implied in the verse of Sureshwara, so your
argument does not hold any water.
