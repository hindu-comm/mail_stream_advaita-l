On p.27 of the book 'Philology and Confrontation' P makes a bold statement:

//Shankara's direct disciples Sureshwara and Padmapada show no awareness of
Shankara's Shiva incarnation.//

But the fact of Padmapada's invocation to the Panchapadika disproves P's
claim.

P's view that Shankara came from a Vaishnava background and the reasons he
gives for that also smacks of his poor understanding of the Bhashyas in a
global perspective. With such prejudiced and imperfect understanding of the
Advaita Bhashya, P does not rise to be the figure that he is made out to
be. Any traditional scholar of Advaita bhashyas with a proper study thereof
can easily prove P's ideas/conclusions wrong.

The above are just samples.
