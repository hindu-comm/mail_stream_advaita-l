I am at a loss to understand what gain or loss Paul Hacker is going to get
by denying Sringeri Mutt its due. If the mutt is really older than
Vidyaranya, and if Hacker has deliberately twisted facts, it would only
harm his reputation. I am not saying Hacker is perfect, but he sincerely
tried to verify the tradition, but could not find any evidence in favor of
the tradition. However, one needs to have an open mind. If there is some
evidence that was missed by Hacker, people are welcome to present it.

// I had also said that the Madhvas believe about such an encounter. //

Beliefs don't constitute historical evidence, because beliefs themselves
are in need of verification. Once upon a time, people believed earth was
flat. That belief is by no means, evidence to show that earth is really
flat.
