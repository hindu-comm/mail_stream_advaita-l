It would have been easier to comment if you had mentioned who the source
for Hacker is, instead of asking me to refer to the book which I am very
unlikely to refer to even if someone gifted me the same, not because I
think you're lying (doubting someone seems to be your turf, not mine,
please), but plainly because it is outside my area of interest.

Only you can answer such a question. Still let me try... you will believe
in the source that you trust or trust more, so will I. However, if the
source is Sringeri record itself, I will consider that website info is
likely a typo and leave it that and not think that website source lied for
some reason.

That this question of both contradictory dates being consistent occurs to
you as a possibility is itself surprising, let alone be explainable! :)

Kind rgds,
