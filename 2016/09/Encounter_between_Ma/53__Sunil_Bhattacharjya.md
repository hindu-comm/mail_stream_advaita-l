Dear Subbuji,

May be for historical reason the historians of the Sringeri math can come out with the facts, but before that the Madhvie scholars would have to 
say when  the so called debates took place. I read that there is confusion among the dvaitins about the birth date and the date of demise of Shri Madhvacharya. Further do the dvaitins have any record of what Shri Madhvacharya asked and what his opponents replied, if at all there was any debate with advaitin scholars. 

REgards,
skb

 Subject: [Advaita-l] Encounter between Madhvacharya and a Sringeri Pontiff

 Some Madhvas believe, on the
 authority of the Sumadhva vijaya, that there
 have been a couple of encounters between Madhvacharya and
 the then pontiff
 of Sringeri Maṭha:

 //Ananda Theertharu defeated many reputed scholars of the
 Buddhist, Jain
 and Advaitic schools in debates and his name began to spread
 far and wide.
 Encouraged by the growing response to his teaching, he
 undertook his first
 tour to Kanyakumari. At Anantapuram (located in the South
 Arcot District of
 Tamilnadu), he is said to have had a bitter debate with the
 then Sri Sri
 Sankaracharya of Sringeri Math, Vidya Theertharu, who was so
 enraged with
 this young ascetic's scholarly arguments that he threatened
 to break his
 Danda (the ascetic's staff). Such encounters with the
 followers of Sri Sri
 Sankaracharya and Srimad Ramanujacharya made him feel the
 need to write his
 own commentary on the Brahmasutras and found a new school of
 thought rooted
 in devotion to the Lord.//

 There is also a belief among some Madhvas that Narayana
 Pandita, a
 contemporary of Madhva, the author of the Sumadhva vijaya
 and Mani Manjari,
 belonged to a family of Shivalli Smarthas owing allegiance
 to the Sringeri
 Maṭha.

 //
 Madhva Vijaya
 Sri Narayana Pandita was born in Likucha or Pejattaaya
 family, of Angirasa
 Gotra Bhagavata Sampradayam, which has indeed done yeomen
 service to
 Madhwas by writing the Biography of Acharya Madhwa in his
 life time. He is
 the is the author of Sumadhvavijaya, biography of the
 founder of the Dvaita
 school of philosophy, Sri Madhvacharya.

 Sri Narayana Panditacharya was the son of Trivikrama
 Panditacharya, one of
 the direct disciples of Sri Madhva. Narayanacharya was born
 in about 1280
 AD, a junior contemporary of Acharya Madhwa.

 He was a born poet like his esteemed father: Kalabhaashana
 eva sooripota:
 Kavraaseet anavadyapadya vadee, in his early child hood
 itself, he used to
 compose Shlokas in praise of God, though they were Bhagavata
 under the
 control of Shringeri Mutt. //

 All the above events are much pre-Vidyaranya.

 A scholar known to me has visited the descendants of
 Narayana Pandita, in
 Mulbagal, Karnataka, who have maintained their smarta
 identity.
