Thanks for your views/response. I think you are aware that another scholar
Vishnudāsāchārya Nagendra refutes the above stated view of Vidwan Bannanje.
I have not yet heard the audio that the scholar has sent me on WhatsApp.

There are many names of sects/communities that are attached to a place:
Baḍaganādu, Seera nāḍu, Mulakanāḍu, Babboor Kamme, etc. Even among Madhvas
I think there are such names of sects/sub sects with places attached.
