In fact, Narayana pandita was born in kasaragod where tulu speaking
pejattaya family is located. Kasaragod was a part of tulunadu then. Almost
all places mentioned in Madhva vijaya viz. Vishnumangala, adooru temples
exist even today. They followed Madhwacharya sampradaya for a few centuries
and later reverted back to advaita later. A faction of their family moved
to udupi and later they might have moved to mantralaya or mulbagal which
were centres of dvaita school of Vedanta. Madhvachrya has placed a
vijaystambha in adooru temple as a mark of his victory.

Sumadhva vijaya is a misnomer. Dvaita scholar bannanje govindacharya
mentions this in his discourses. Even shivalli  smartas is a misnomer.
Shivalli is a village in udupi. It would be more appropriate to say tuluva
smarta.
