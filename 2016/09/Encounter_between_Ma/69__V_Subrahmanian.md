With or without Paul Hacker's 'findings' the situation does not change.
Even before his findings people have striven for the Truth and attained it
with the available infrastructure. Hacker's findings are not in any way
going to affect that. Hacker's sincerity will face a stonewall since he
cannot go beyond the kind of evidence he is looking for. Just because the
kind of evidence he is looking for is not available, he cannot conclude
that the tradition/evidence itself did not exist. So, whatever evidence
that is not within his idea of evidence will not convince him.

No problem.  What is 'history' for the academician, is charitram for the
believer.  Prahlada Charitram needs no verification for it to convey the
message it is intended to.
