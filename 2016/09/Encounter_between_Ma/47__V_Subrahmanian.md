Even Advaitins believe that Shankaracharya had a discussion with Veda
Vyasa. Advaitins, at a level, take such accounts seriously.  It is the same
as taking the stories of Krishna described in the various works such as the
Bhāgavatam seriously. If historians do not want to take them seriously, the
loss is theirs and not of the believers.
