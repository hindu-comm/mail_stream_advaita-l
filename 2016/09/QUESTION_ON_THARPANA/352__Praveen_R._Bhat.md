Namaste Anandji,

Some of the purohitas from our community had told my father that he could
give gogrAsa/ feed the shraddha-day bhojana to a cow as an exception,
considering his age and health, along with dakShiNa, etc, kept aside, for
the kulapurohit or any other purohit. Does this exception not have a basis
in shAstra?

Thanks,
--Praveen R. Bhat
