praNAms Sri Anand Hudli prabhuji
Hare Krishna

Thanks a lot for clarification.  Yes, I have read about the vidhi-s / niyama-s  to be followed in the case of tripAdi and dhanishtAdi paNchaka death.    But I was wondering why only these nakshatra-s are considered as inauspicious and why only certain nakshatra-s classified as tripAdi.  It is very difficult to get answers for 'WHY'-s in dharma shAstra, we have to follow the vidhi-s and do it just because 'it is there in the shAstra and do it without asking the question 'why'?? it is just because shAstra itself is the pramANa for dharma / karma jignAsa :-)   Anyway, thanks again  for your time and explanation prabhuji.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar

paNchaka.  Why these stars called tripAda nakshatra when all starts have 4 pAda-s and why dhanishtA paNchaka is inauspicious.  Any Adhara / vivaraNa in our dharma shAstra-s??  I know nakshatra names and dOsha-s etc. as we can see these details in paNchAnga.  But I am interested in more detailed explanation.  Kindly help.

As far as JyotiSha is concerned, all nakShatras have four pAdas, each 3 degrees and 20 minutes. It is just that some nakShatras are called tripAda nakShatras. They are punarvasu, uttarAShADhA, kRttikA, uttarA (uttaraphAlgunI), pUrvAbhAdrapadA, and vishAkhA. The dhaniShThA panchaka consists of dhaniShThottarArdhamArabhya revatyantaM sArdhanakShatracatuShTayam. This means it is four and half nakShatras, beginning with the second half of dhaniShThA and ending with revatI, ie.
dhaniShThA second half, shatatArA, pUrvAbhAdrapadA, uttarAbhadrapadA, and revatI. tatra dAhaniShedhAt- because cremating the dead body is prohibited in the dhaniShThA panchaka, darbhamayaputtalaiH-  with (five) dolls made of darbha grass, yavapiShTAnuliptaiH- smeared with wheat or barley
flour,panchorNasUtraveShTitaiH- wrapped with five kinds of wool, saha shavaM dahet- one should cremate the body. (dharmasindhu). There is a panchaka vidhi to be followed by placing the five dolls on different parts of the body, worshipping them with the appropriate nakShatra mantras, and also  offering Ahutis with ghee with certain mantras and then cremating
(burning) the body along with the dolls, after putting "pancharatnas" in the mouth of the body being cremated. At the end of the sUtaka period, a shAnti homa has to be performed. I remember this because when one of my aunts passed away in one of the panchaka nakShatras, her sons had to follow this requirement.

There is a similar procedure to be followed when death occurs in the tripAda nakShatras, where there could be a dvipuShkara or tripuShkara yoga.
tripuShkara yoga happens when death occurs on a bhadrAtithi (dvitIyA, Saptami, or dvAdashi) which is a Sunday, Tuesday, or Saturday, and in a tripAdanakShatra. dvipuShkarayoga happens when death occurs on a Sunday, Tuesday, or Saturday and in a dvipAda nakShatra, which is one of mRgashirA, chitrA, and dhaniShThA.

Anand
