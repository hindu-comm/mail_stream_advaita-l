>  Thanks for the further clarification prabhuji.  

If you ask me why Sundays, Tuesdays, and Saturdays are considered inauspicious, I can tell you that according to JyotiSha, sUrya, kuja, and shani are malefic planets.

>  Even Sunday also considered inauspicious in jyOtisha prabhuji??  Very interesting.  Though we normally  donâ€™t do  vaidika saMskAra-s like upanayana, vivAha etc. on Tuesdays and Saturdays, we do have good muhurthams on Sundays for vivAha, upanayanAdi saMskAra.  And most of the people would particularly insist for the bhAnuvAra muhurta :-) And even in Sringeri paNchAnga there are lot of muhurtha-s on Sundays like chUdAkarma, vivAha, upanayana, gruha pravesha etc.  

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
