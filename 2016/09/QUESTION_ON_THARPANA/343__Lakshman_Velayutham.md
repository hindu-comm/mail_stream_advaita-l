Just to add to Raviji's questions...

1) Do we perform Shraad for removing pitru dosha?  If yes,  what causes
pitru dosha in the first place? Despite doing Shraad,  how does pitru dosha
come?
2) Can pitru dosha be removed permanently?
3) When one performs Shraad,  how many generations ate we addressing?

Regards

Lakshman Velayutham
