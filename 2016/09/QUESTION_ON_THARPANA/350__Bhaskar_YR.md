Kindly let me know more details about tripaada nakshatra and dhanishtA paNchaka.  Why these stars called tripAda nakshatra when all starts have 4 pAda-s and why dhanishtA paNchaka is inauspicious.  Any Adhara / vivaraNa in our dharma shAstra-s??  I know nakshatra names and dOsha-s etc. as we can see these details in paNchAnga.  But I am interested in more detailed explanation.  Kindly help.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
