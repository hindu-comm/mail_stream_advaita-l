Dear Sunil ji,

Even I had asked the above question about the Ishtasiddhi and have not had
any replies so far.  I had even contacted MM Sri R. Krishnamurti Sastrigal
whose Ph.D thesis, decades ago, was the Ishtasiddhi vivarana and he said he
is not aware of such claims or the so-called flaws.

About the Bhadarakere Mutt, it is located in Udupi and these websites may
be of help to you:
