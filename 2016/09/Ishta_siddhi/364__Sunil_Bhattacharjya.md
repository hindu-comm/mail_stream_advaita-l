Dear Scholars,

I understand that there has been a claim that Shri Madhvacharya showed  thirty-two flaws in the advaitic text "Ishtasiddhi" while debating with his Advaita guru  Shri Achyutaprekasha, then the head of the "Bhandarkere Math". I shall be grateful if anybody can kindly let me have the details of the so-called thirty-two flaws pointed out by Shri Madhvacharya, as well as the whereabouts of the Bhandarkere math. 

Regards,
Sunil KB
