Summaniru manave nee brahmanaaguve.

In the gita sixth chapter we have ...yogaarudhasya tasyaiva shamah
kaaranamuchyate.

So already a step towards silence is taught: shamah.

In taittiriya bhrugu is asked 'tapasaa Brahma vijignaasasva' for which
Shankara cites a Mahabharata verse: kaayendriyaanaam hi aikaagryam paramam
tapah

The one pointedness of the body mind organs is the highest tapas.

gita: maunam aatma vinigrahah.

Shravna ends in nididhyasanam which is anyaa vaacho vimunchata. Naanu
dhyayaan bahuun shabdah.

That is what summaa iru means.

Viveka chudamani: yogasya prathaman dvaaram vaangnirodhah.

All sadhanas are aimed at quietening the mind.

Others can add more inputs.
