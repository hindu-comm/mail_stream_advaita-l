Rather, for one who has gone through the traditional method of SMN (like
most of us here in this group), and interested in reading the teachings of
our saints or sages, will surely share advaitic content in such Teachings.
This is only for mananam.
You can't help, but share, if Turiyan generates advaitic knowledge (Chitta
spandana) from such Teachings as well :)
You can't be a nishEdhi or nirOdhi saying, will only share if coming from
Sruti or bhAshya :)

All your questions are valid, if the intent or context is something else ..
