Raghav ji,

Could you confirm whether the above translation you give to the statement
is correct? For we have this too:

http://www.arunachala.org/docs/upadesa-saram/

27.

jñāna-varjitā-jñana-hina cit

jñānam-asti kiṃ jñātum-antaram

That is true knowledge which transcends
Both knowledge and ignorance,
For in pure knowledge

Is no object to be known.


If it has to be //'What is Jnana other than the Knower'// I think the
wording should be: ....jñāturantaram.  Because, jñātā is the knower.  Apart
from the knower where / what is Knowledge?  In this case jñātā will become
jñātuḥ in the panchamī .
