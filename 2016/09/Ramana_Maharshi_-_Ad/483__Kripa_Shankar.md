Namaste Subramanian

I will see if I can get a clarification on this matter by the Mutt.

Some great points of grave import presented by SrimaLalitalalitah. Praveen, like many others are trying to defend Ramana as if it's an assault on Ramana s character, which clearly is not(it's also irrelevant) . But I am baffled to see that when Shruti pramana is neglected, in other words when the Shruti is under assault, no one takes offence!

Just wanted to add one more point. I was watching a video of Bharati teertha swami delivering a lecture in Tamil. There he categorically stated that Sringeri Mutt never acknowledges anyone outside of the Mutt but a pramada (an exception) to this rule was when one of the great swamis (can't recall the name sorry) acknowledged Sadashiva Brahmendra. It is on YouTube.

Here is a quote from the book 'Crest Jewel of Yogis' Vol.I penned by Sri R.M.Umesh, a disciple has said while narrating a couple of incidents from the lives of Sri Ramakrishna Paramahamsa and Ramana Maharshi:

//We can even consider the cases of Sri Ramakrishna and Sri Ramana whom Acharyal (Jagadguru Sri Abhinava Vidyatirtha Mahaswaminah) acknowledges as Jnanins. That will help to throw light on the behavior of comparatively recent personages.// p.646

(The above book was published by Sri Sharada Trust, Sringeri)

and goes on to cite an incident or two from the famous book 'Sri Ramakrishna the Great Master' of Swamy Saradananda. And another or two from the book 'Ramana Maharishi and the path of Self Knowledge' by Osborne. Another incident from the book of K.S.Swaminathan on 'Ramana Maharshi' is also cited in the above book.

This the author does after citing incidents from Shankara (Madhaviya Shankara Vijaya), Rama in the Ramayana and Krishna in the Mahabharata. This is a chapter titled ' The Human Aspect' where Acharyal's expressions of several human traits have been mentioned. 

Thus there is solid evidence to the Acharya of Sringeri Maṭha acknowledging personages 'outside' the maṭha. I had already pointed out the case of one Para Brahma (from Punjab/Kashmir) whom also the Acharya had acknowledged as a Jnani and even directed one of his own devotees to associate with him. Sri Umesh has written about this Para Brahma too in his book. So, there is no way one can assert that the Sringeri Acharyas do not acknowledge those 'outside' the 'maṭha.'
