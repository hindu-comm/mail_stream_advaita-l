Agreed. Shruti has to be the only pramANa for aikya, since it cannot be
known through any other means.

"After hearing the Self to be the Brahman the person finds the true import
of the Self and reverts to it whenever he is diverted from it.  Here is the
*WHOLE PROCESS* of Realization."

The sentence does not say "importance of AtmA", but *import*, which means
what it really is, which is brahman. Then "reverts to it" would mean revert
to the lakShyArtha of self being brahman as learnt from Shruti. That would
be gaining niShThA..

I've read that the death-like experience caused him to understand self
apart from body. And that is what he clearly said and supported.
This type of experience is evident in even new sAdhaka-s who experience in
meditation that the japa and other vR^itti-s are coming and going and he is
watching. This is tvampadArthashodhanam. Same is case of ramaNa.
Rest parts, as aikyam and mithyAtva of prapa~ncha, can't be known by such
means.

I don't have such a doubt since this can be raised about anyone in the
sampradAya itself and I do not know how this would ever be proven.

I understand your point of view. Thanks.
