Sujal, you better know that why you were talking like that and what you
were talking. It is possible that you didn't have clear idea of the cause
of of your own reply and you are now trying to clean things. You don't
write posts for no reasons. If you wrote, then take responsibility.
I write harsh, I take responsibility. And that proves that I'm not a soft
person. Similarly your post indicates about your ideas, interests and
character, even if you don't know about yourself.

I've just put things generally, because it is a pattern which I observed at
many places.
It is common for people to refute things for absurd reasons(!) just because
that is opposed to their interest.

Rest of your post doesn't deserve a reply, since the tone has stopped me to
read further.
