There are 2 versions of Bhagavan Ramana's ashottara-shatanAmAvaLi.  One composed by Sri.Vishwanatha Swami 
another by Sri.Jagadeesa Sastrigal.

In the version of Sri.Jagadeesha Sastrigal, the 8th name is :

श्रृंगाद्रिमठाधीशभाविताय नमो नमः

Upon asking Bhagaan by a devotee, Bhagavan replied it points towards Sri Satchidananda Sivabhinava Nrisimha 
Bharati Mahaswamigal of Sringeri. His Holiness had high regards for Bhagavan and whoever used to visit 
Sringeri from Tiruvannamalai, used to enquire about the health of Bhagavan.    

Also, couple of highly acclaimed Acharya from Puri Govardhan Mutt approached Bhagavan for a clarification on certain shloka
which runs as "hara-gaurI samyOgAt....".  Bhagavan glanced at Puri Acharya.  They exchanged the glances and it 
was perfect Silence.  Later, Puri Acharya left the placed satisfied with the answer !

Sringeri Sivaganga Acharya (Sri.Subramanya Bharati Swamigal) used to seek guidance from Bhagavan.  

So, these are some of the examples that show that traditional acharyas held Bhagavan in high esteem.
