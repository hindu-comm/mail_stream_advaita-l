Namaste Kripaji,
"This is why I felt * the method adopted by Ramana * of always speaking in
paramarthika(apparently)  is not in line with scriptures. "

Scriptures speaks in vyavahAra in order to take people from vyavahAra
drishTi to paramArtha drishTi. The ultimate reality is only paramArtha.
There is no harm in speaking of it.

"It's the same with reincarnation. To say that reincarnation is applicable
for fools and the wise do not acknowledge it is just wrong."

I think you are missing the wood for the trees here. You expect that just
because some shruti uses a particular prakriya  (teaching methodology), all
shrutis need to necessarily use it. Aitareya, Taittiriya etc use srishTi as
a prakriyA to explain Brahman, but mANDUkya doesn't. Similarly if a student
is caught up with the view that reincarnation is correct, sometimes shruti
provisionally accepts it before finally invalidating it. However, that
provisional acceptance does not mean that all gurus have to use it all
times. Neither does an adherence to reincarnation confer "advaitatva" to
the teaching, nor does the failure to adhere to it deny it. As it has been
successfully argued in advaita tradition, prakriyA bheda does not mean
siddhAnta bheda. In order to determine if some teaching is in line with
advaita or not, one needs to look at the siddhAnta, not the prakriya. It is
not a question of someone being a fool or not, it is whether a particular
teaching works for him or not.

"Your last line is just a matter of terminology. "

You had said: "You have admitted that Ramana himself never claimed to be
either shAstra vid or sampradayavid. Then why is it an issue to classify
him as a great soul outside the orthodox school of Advaita?" to which I
replied "No issue whatsoever  - however it would be erroneous to use that
as a basis to classify his teaching as non-vedAnta or neo Vedanta." Perhaps
you mean this last line in my email.

Sorry, what I meant to say was that there is a difference between
classifying Ramana the person as outside the orthodox school of advaita, vs
classifying his teaching as outside the school of advaita. Even if you
concede the former, it does not imply the latter. Not an issue of
terminology, its the crux of the entire debate.

Regards,
Venkatraghavan
