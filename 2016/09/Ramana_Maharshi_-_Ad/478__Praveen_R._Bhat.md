Namaste Kripaji,

I wouldn't have replied to this since we kind of closed the discussion
earlier on, but for my name being mentioned. I just reply to a little more
than that line alone. :)

True.

Not true. Your usage of words such as what he ate, etc, could be construed
as an assault, especially since that was not only irrelevant, it was also
untrue.

I hope you meant somewhere else because shruti-pramANa is very well
defended, at least on this list. Please don't mix this up when you name me,
lest it be misunderstood. :)

Not a proving fact of anything, as we have seen Kanchi Paramacharya
acknowledging something didn't help. Nonetheless, a link might interest
others, since I don't know Tamil.

Kind rgds,
