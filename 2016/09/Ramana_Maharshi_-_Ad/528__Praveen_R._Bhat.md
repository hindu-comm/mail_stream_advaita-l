Making an oversight correction please. The line "Not in an ashram, but in
his writings and "authentic" records, especially since he didn't live a
living tradition" should be read as "Not in an ashram, but in his writings
and "authentic" records, especially since he didn't *leave* a living
tradition (behind)".
