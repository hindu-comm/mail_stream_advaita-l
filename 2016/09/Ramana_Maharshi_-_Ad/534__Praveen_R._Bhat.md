Even considering someone as an Apta is on shraddhA!

In Taittiriyopanishad, the teacher asks the students not to follow wrong
conduct even if done by them. What does that tell us? Anyway, this is
besides the point in case of the Maharshi, since his conduct was beyond
doubt, despite your insinuations from whatever sources, supposedly Aptas
for you.

As said above, even to consider someone as an Apta, you need to begin with
shraddhA, not doubt.

Investigation should be through the right sources too. Ganapati muni is
definitely an Apta for many in the tradition, so his statements about
Maharshi are more valid than Wiki, Bruntons, etc.

That may be criteria perhaps, but that cannot be the only one. Else, all
uttamodhikAris who have chittashuddhi from birth would be ruled out.

Good answer. Ditto about Maharshi for all who follow, including a huge lot
in the orthodox traditionalists. :)

And it is, in case of Maharshi's teaching.

Not sometimes, at all times relevant.

So am I. कर्म in Upadeshasaram is what shows Vedic karma. Moreover,
Maharshi was atyAshramI by his own acceptance and the traditional following
itself. Why an atyAshramI, even a Paramahamsa sannyAsi has no rules to
follow in the tradition.

Am I? No. There are many prakaraNa granthas in the tradition that deal with
one aspect of the mahAvAkya. They are self-sufficient for the purpose. Same
with Maharshi's teaching. Each teaching has anubandhachAtuShTaya, adhikAri
being one.



> Shastras consider even the most dull person.

So? No one says that each Vedanta teacher should consider the dullest
person also. Please understand the difference between Maharshi was not a
traditional Vedanta teacher versus what Maharshi taught is against
traditional Vedanta. You have completely erred the former to mean the
latter.


> Shastras are taught from vyakarana and not mahavakyas.
>

This is not an argument at all, since nobody claimed Maharshi was a teacher
of shastras. Nor is every traditional Vedanta teacher a teacher of shAstra.
vyAkaraNa is also shAstra. vyAkaraNaM mukhaM proktaM. vyAkaraNa is not the
only tool to learn Vedanta, many more are needed. Final Vedanta teaching is
from mahAvAkya only not vyAkaraNa, because Vedanta considers that all
shAstras have ekavAkyatA. One who is eligible for mahAvAkya needs nothing
else.

Already included in Upadeshasaram with the exact use of word कर्म itself.
What is the problem in understanding that?

Vedas are not for everyone for moksha. Some have to refer to prakaraNas and
purANas, albeit derived from Vedas, for moksha. Even with Vedas being for
ever, five more orthodox darShanas have all landed in dvaita! Being for
everyone doesn't mean that all followers are right or would get it.

Not the job of Vedas. Nor does Upadeshasaram do so. However, even HH
Chandrashekhara Bharati Swamiji told at least one Christian to continue in
Christianity since it is in his best interest towards moksha than
converting to Hinduism. I wonder what would you conclude from that.
