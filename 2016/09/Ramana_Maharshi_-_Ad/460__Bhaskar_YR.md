praNAms Sri Kripa Shankar prabhuji
Hare Krishna

Due to restrictions in accessibility of internet I am not able to open the link you provided at my office desk top.  Anyway, instead of depending too much on web data, what do you think of yourself about ramaNa's teaching  and why do you think his teaching goes against Advaita ??  can you share your thoughts in your own words prabhuji??  Kindly note I am not saying ramaNa's teaching and methodology is strictly in line with traditional teaching and sAdhana, but to my knowledge I hardly find any difference in ramaNa's teaching with that of Advaita.  In short, though bhagavaan ramaNa was not a rigid follower of orthodox Advaita tradition, his teaching is NOT alien to Advaita.  

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!

‎Namaste

Interesting article about Ramana. This mig‎ht explain so many aspects about Neo-Advaita and the confusion around. Further, this corresponds to the recent campaign of Rajiv Malhotra. This may also explain why Ramana is saying there is no reincarnation.

My query i‎s simple. There are so many concepts like shrAddha, Creation theory, Karma etc

> yes, in the shruti, dharma shAstra etc. we will find plenty of references with regard to shrAddhAdi karma, creation, karma etc. for the jignAsu-s who are yet to realize that ultimate truth that there is no creation, no jeeva, nor mukti nor bandha. 

Why pick up reincarnation, why mix up vyavahara and paramaartha and why to take pain to explain again that nothing holds in absolute terms when it is said already many times. Kim punaha?

> don’t you think shruti and bhAshya themselves an admixture of these dual viewpoints?? 're-incarnation' is one of those topics. And in this particular context ramaNa might have taken this topic and clarified his stand from the highest view point. To do apavAda first we have to know what is adhyArOpita, is it not prabhuji. Kindly see kArika maraNe sambhave chaiva gatyAgamanayOrapi and shankara bhAshya on that it would clear from this that exit, going away, reincarnating are all from the stand point of imputation and nothing real in 'real' sense.
