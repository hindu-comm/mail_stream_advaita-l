Specific details may be needed here so that I'm able to comment correctly.
BTW, my last post to praveen takes care to explain my views.

This is anuvAda of common process. Is he talking about himself?

It is readily acceptable that there were many shtitapraGYA-laxaNa-s in that
great saint.
The categorisation of him with sa~Nkhya-s is not based on his talks, rather
it is based on the fact that he accidentally came to know difference of
AtmA from body and then supported the quest 'who am i', without taking in
view shruti-s. Since, there is no other pramANa to reveal oneness, and
hence there is no way to decide mithyAtva of nAnAtva, it is obvious that we
have to put such person in some other group.

One thing which I forgot to add and which was reminded by your sentence
bearing similarity to that which I wanted to write is-
Although shAnti-dhAnti, etc. can also be seen in a dvaitI which makes them
unable to take us to decision about brahmaYGAna in a person(in some earlier
post I said that); when those qualities are accompanied by shrauta-GYAna
they become confirming sign of brahmaGYAna.

For me, the nature of his realisation is not yet same as that of generating
from mahAvAkya-s, owing to the concern related to pramANabhAva and shruti.

Let me clarify that 'ahem manurabhavam' is not brahmAtmaikyAnubhava itself.
It can easily be some type of upAsanA or arthavAda. So, no need to rush to
take that as example.
Then why bhAShya terms that as aikyAnubhava? You tell me. We will talk
about that later.
Moreover, AchArya always said that upaniShad-s have AkhyAyikA-s, they are
not history. Why? I hope you know that, because I 've talked about that
while supporting apauruSheyatva of shruti years ago. You were a part of
that.

This warning was heard by us from svAmI rAmAnanda-sarasvatI jI or
oMkAreshvara. Once a devotee came to him to say that mahArAja had given him
darshana and some mantra or something that night, which he denied. He said
that if I don't know that I went to you, then you must be imagining that.
Then he added that nowadays even siddha-s are made by bhakta-s/ certificate
of siddhi is given by devotees.
