We hear that people out of the fold of Hinduism have Advaitic experience.
How do we explain it? Saying that they were Hindus in previous birth
is simply our guess work
and it does not solve the problem because they are not Hindus in the
this birth in which they
have advaitic experience.

Why do we always try to drag every realised soul into Hindu fold?
Is this necessary? What do we get out of this?
regards,
Sarma.
