The article has just these two opinions about Ramana:

//*The medieval Acharyas and more recent teachers of Vedic spirituality
like Sri Ramana Maharshi
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramana_Maharishi> were able to know without
difficulty the religious identity and affiliations of their disciples. They
did not have to search out and verify their students’ political and
religious backgrounds.//*

*//**We remain ever reverent of Sri Ramana Maharshi. His devotion and
surrender to Sri Arunachaleshwar are an inspiration and example to follow,
though some of his “non­actions” are not easily understood by this writer.
//*

This does not say anything about his teachings. In fact in the entire
article, there are only parts related to Ramanasram and the politics
surrounding it and the Mountain Path journal; nothing of these is really
negative 'about' Ramana and his teachings.
