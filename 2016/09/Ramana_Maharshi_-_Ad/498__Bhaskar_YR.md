So it's definitely not personal. I started this query in true spirit of inquiry.

praNAms Kripa Shankar prabhuji
Hare Krishna

Would it be possible for anyone to get his doubts clarified when he has his 'own' uncompromised opinions on the same subject already prabhuji??   I donâ€™t think so.  You are already doubting ramaNa's associates writings, you have already concluded that the 'image' ramaNa has been hyped by media and white skin Apta vAkya-s, you are already clear in your mind that ramaNa quotes only Osho, Tai etc. and never cared to quote shankara and his answer to any 'deep' philosophical questions was monotonous & vague :-)  Under these circumstances and preconceived notions about a particular person how can your inquiry be objective prabhuji?? Just wondering.   

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
