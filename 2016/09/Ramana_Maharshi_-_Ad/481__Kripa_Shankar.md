Namaste

‎ Kanchi mutt. This is what happens when we keep aside investigation about truth and choose personality cults.

It is surprising that I found this link of this very same site. ‎

Namaste Praveen

What other sources? I could quote from Ramanashram site but then they too won't represent Ramana! Btw all quotes that are on Wikipedia are‎ excerpts from some of his works.

I mentioned about his daily routine because the argument made was based on assumptions/speculations. I merely represented the other side to show that such arguments do not hold.

I don't even want to get into the whole inaccuracies of Kanchi mutt‎ lest I should be cursed. I have already stated what Bharati teertha swami said from his own mouth. I'll try to go back and dig for the link. That said I shall write to Sringeri Mutt, which in my opinion is the only organised orthodox representative, to get a clarification.
‎
I just want to further my argument and ask this - what about Nisargadatta 'Maharaj ' or how should one regard 'paramahamsa' Yogananda who clicked pictures with Ramana (just stating a mere fact) and later claimed to have learnt from Ramana. I have read a few portions of the book - the autobiography of a yogi. If we consider Ramana to represent orthodox Advaita, then we have to accept P.yogananda as the rightful successor.

Regards
Kripa ‎

Namaste Kripaji,

I wouldn't have replied to this since we kind of closed the discussion earlier on, but for my name being mentioned. I just reply to a little more than that line alone. :)

True, unlike the points made without basis. Wiki quotes don't count.

Praveen, like many others are trying to defend Ramana
True.

as if it's an assault on Ramana s character, which clearly is not(it's also irrelevant) .
Not true. Your usage of words such as what he ate, etc, could be construed as an assault, especially since that was not only irrelevant, it was also untrue.

But I am baffled to see that when Shruti pramana is neglected, in other words when the Shruti is under assault, no one takes offence!
I hope you meant somewhere else because shruti-pramANa is very well defended, at least on this list. Please don't mix this up when you name me, lest it be misunderstood. :)

‎ Just wanted to add one more point. I was watching a video of Bharati teertha swami delivering a lecture in Tamil. There he categorically stated that Sringeri Mutt never acknowledges anyone outside of the Mutt 
but a pramada (an exception) to this rule was when one of the great swamis (can't recall the name sorry) acknowledged Sadashiva Brahmendra. It is on YouTube. 

Not a proving fact of anything, as we have seen Kanchi Paramacharya acknowledging something didn't help. Nonetheless, a link might interest others, since I don't know Tamil.

Kind rgds,
