Namaste Bhaskar

I am willing to set aside my bias! You have admitted that he may not be following the orthodox school of Advaita, which is evident. This does not mean he was a fraud. This means that Ramana has given birth or adopted another school of Advaita. The term Neo Advaita was already there and well defined. ‎In fact, Ramana asram themselves say so.

Everyone does not have to follow the scriptures. Yathecchasi tatha kuru. But in my sincere opinion, classifying the schools accordingly is important so that we don't mix up things. 

I personally don't like to mix up our ancient Rishis/culture with people/ culture from other faiths. That is my own inclination. Others may not have an issue. My own parents have high regards for Ramana and they travel to Tiruvannamalai frequently. I try to argue with them but they disregard me :) 

Regards 
Kripa

Subject: RE: [Advaita-l] Ramana Maharshi - Advaitin or Neo Advaitin?

So it's definitely not personal. I started this query in true spirit of inquiry.

praNAms Kripa Shankar prabhuji
Hare Krishna

Would it be possible for anyone to get his doubts clarified when he has his 'own' uncompromised opinions on the same subject already prabhuji?? I don’t think so. You are already doubting ramaNa's associates writings, you have already concluded that the 'image' ramaNa has been hyped by media and white skin Apta vAkya-s, you are already clear in your mind that ramaNa quotes only Osho, Tai etc. and never cared to quote shankara and his answer to any 'deep' philosophical questions was monotonous & vague :-) Under these circumstances and preconceived notions about a particular person how can your inquiry be objective prabhuji?? Just wondering. 

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
