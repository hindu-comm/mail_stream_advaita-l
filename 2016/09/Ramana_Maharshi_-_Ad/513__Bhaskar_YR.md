Oh I meant that I was only provisionally accepting Kripa ji's view that Ramana Maharishi did not belong to a sampradAya for the sake of argument. I do not believe that to be the case.

>  But I want to be true to myself here.  It is quite evident that, when we go by the strict norms of orthodox saMpradAya and its avichhinna guru-shishya paraMpara, ramaNa did not belong to any of the bonafide saMpradAya, as I said he can be considered as mahatma from atyAshrami.  But it does not make him an official representative of any  sAmpradAya and Acharya or saMnyAsi of an orthodox tradition.  Fact remains, atleast in my opinion, based on his biography and teaching that bhagavAN ramaNa  maharshi was a brahmanishTa jnAni but not shrOtreeya in traditional sense.  And he was not a traditional dashanAmi sanyasi but it hardly a matter of concern to this 'sage'.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
