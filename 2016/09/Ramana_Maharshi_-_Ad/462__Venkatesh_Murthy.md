Namaste

I appreciate your boldness to challenge Ramana Maharshi. There is
nothing wrong in challenging a famous person. We should not follow
famous persons like sheep. I agree.

The confusion by Neo Advaita is happening because of Sankara Bhashyas
only. They are wrongly interpreting Sankara's criticism of Purva
Meemamsa and concluding all rituals are bad. All religious practices
are bad. Forget all differences of caste and gender. All this is
Maayaa.

But if you listen to Sringeri Swamijis they are not giving talks on
Upanisad Vakyas all the time. They are talking about our culture our
Dharma and our conduct most of the time.

If Adi Sankara was alive today and writing Bhashyas what he would
write when he knows all the Vedic culture is dying and already dead in
North India. In entire states in North India there are no proper
Purohitas knowing correct procedure of our Samskaaras like Upanayana
and Vivaha. There are no Vedas studies in many states. Brahmins don't
know what Veda and Gotra they are.

Imagine what Adi Sankara would write if he was alive today. Will he
write another criticism of Purva Meemamsa when the number Purva
Meemamsa scholars can counted on fingers? It will be a joke.

It cannot be compared to Shankara even in wildest fantasy. For eg: 'Insert any question ' - Who are you, who is asking the question? To whom does the question belong? Or something like - There is nothing to be taught, no nothing, just keep asking who the heck you are. Or abide in yourself.

Anyway, instead of depending too much on web data, what do you think of yourself about ramaNa's teaching and why do you think his teaching goes against Advaita ?? can you share your thoughts in your own words prabhuji?? Kindly note I am not saying ramaNa's teaching and methodology is strictly in line with traditional teaching and sAdhana, but to my knowledge I hardly find any difference in ramaNa's teaching with that of Advaita. In short, though bhagavaan ramaNa was not a rigid follower of orthodox Advaita tradition, his teaching is NOT alien to Advaita.

>> don’t you think shruti and bhAshya themselves an admixture of these dual viewpoints?? 're-incarnation' is one of those topics. And in this particular context ramaNa might have taken this topic and clarified his stand from the highest view point. To do apavAda first we have to know what is adhyArOpita, is it not prabhuji. Kindly see kArika maraNe sambhave chaiva gatyAgamanayOrapi and shankara bhAshya on that it would clear from this that exit, going away, reincarnating are all from the stand point of imputation and nothing real in 'real' sense.
