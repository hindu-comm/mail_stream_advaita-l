Please re-read that line that Ramana maharishi said about advaita. He is
advocating going beyond terms like advaita and dvaita to understand the
self is all there is.

He is saying that what difference does it make what you choose to call that
which cannot be expressed by words.

Venkatraghavan

praNAms,

Sri Ramana Maharshi was fully realised saint. Sri Kanchi Paramacharya
acknowledged this fact. There were many devotees who had equal reverence
for both saints. Though Kanchi Paramacharya never met Sri Ramana Maharshi,
he pointed out Sri Ramana's name to a foreigner who was looking for a fully
realised saint. Ra. Ganapathi said both respected each other.

While Kanchi Paramacharya stood to traditional approach, Sri Ramana
Maharshi did not observe any traditional customs.

Kanchi Paramacharya was an AchArya, Sri Ramana Maharshi was a Guru. Please
refer to the Book, 'The Guru Tradition' by Ra. Ganapathi, which are
collection of teachings of Kanchi Paramacharya Sri Chandrashekharendra
Sarasvati Svami.

an Acharya has to observe certain discipline, ask others to follow the same
and should be able to defend his sampradAya when needed. AchArya teaches
step by step as per tradition. Sri Ramana Maharshi was not an AchArya, but
a GYAnI.

Sri Ramana Maharshi was an exception. Exception is not a rule. Sri Ramana
Maharshi never asked anyone to follow his way of life. Like Sri
Ramakrishna, he is considered as an avatAra by his devotees.

... and, please while studing advaita vedAnta or Hinduism in general, do
not trust Google guru and wiki pramANa :)

Hari OM.

Hare Krishna

Please forgive me for my ignorance. I had this long standing doubt about
Ramana. I believed that Ramana taught Advaita all along thanks to the
popular opinion. However I later realized that he was unacquainted with the
scriptures.

>  traditionalists who are familiar with Sri ramaNa's teaching would say he
has completed these formalities ( like shAstrAdhyayana, shravaNAdi sAdhana
etc.) in his previous janma/s so no need for him to start it again.  Rishi
vAmadeva realized the truth in his mother's womb and it is because of his
previous janma's saMskAra...justification for not reading the scriptures in
this janma would go like this.

 Further, he apparently learnt from the hill which he considered as Shiva.
Isn't this dogma‎tic and a deviation from the tradition?

>  for that matter guru dattatreya had 24 guru-s and all of them were not
shrOtriya and brahmanishTa vedAntins as you know, mara (tree) sometimes
lead to rAma as in the case of vAlmeeki  :-)

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
