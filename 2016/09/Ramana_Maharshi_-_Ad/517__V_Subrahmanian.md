How do you know Ramana did not follow the principles of conduct before he
became a renunciate?

Have you read about what condition was Ramana was in during the Pathala
Lingam times? How many servants were there then? What bhojana he was served
by whom then?

You fault posing for a photo?  If camera was popular then, Sadashiva
Brahmendral would also have posed!!  The Upanishads have given descriptions
of Brahman for upasana. Sadashiva has penned innumerable major and minor
works. How do you think this was possible without any interaction with
people? In fact he did interact with people, there are stories about that.

You have not read how many stories based on puranas Ramana has narrated.

You do not know that there was a Veda pathashala in the Ashram during
Ramana's times.

You do not know that Shankara has given a word of appreciation to Buddha's
vairagya. For Shankara 'para matam apratishiddham anumatam bhavati.' What
is non-contradictory to one's school, is happily admitted. So, if a
contemporary Acharya takes some points from Christ or Buddha, how does that
become bad?
