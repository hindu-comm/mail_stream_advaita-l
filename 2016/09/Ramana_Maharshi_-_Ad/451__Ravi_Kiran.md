Since jnAna is svasaMvedya, is it not appropriate to refrain from
categorizing others into one or another and posting such opinions and
starting debates?

In case of any such opinions ( so-and-so is x or y) are formed, is it not
better to keep such opinions to one-self rather than sharing or starting
discussions on such ideas ? what is the purpose / intent in posting such
content and goal to be achieved from continuing such discussions? How it is
helping one-self or other ?

Maybe, I missed something here .. If there is of some importance in such
threads, open to correct my viewpoint..

just my 2c,

regards
