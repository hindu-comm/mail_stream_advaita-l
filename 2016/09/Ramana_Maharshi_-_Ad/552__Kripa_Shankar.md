Namaste

Yes, the article/author acknowledges Ramana as a saint. But all points raised by the author solves the grand puzzle.

Interesting article about Ramana.

https://bharatabharati.wordpress.com/2011/01/30/atma-jyoti-ashram-sannyasis-or-snake-oil-salesmen-swami-devananda-saraswati/

The article has just these two opinions about Ramana:

//The medieval Acharyas and more recent teachers of Vedic spirituality like Sri Ramana Maharshiwere able to know without difficulty the religious identity and affiliations of their disciples. They did not have to search out and verify their students’ political and religious backgrounds.//

//We remain ever reverent of Sri Ramana Maharshi. His devotion and surrender to Sri Arunachaleshwar are an inspiration and example to follow, though some of his “non­actions” are not easily understood by this writer. //

This does not say anything about his teachings. In fact in the entire article, there are only parts related to Ramanasram and the politics surrounding it and the Mountain Path journal; nothing of these is really negative 'about' Ramana and his teachings.
