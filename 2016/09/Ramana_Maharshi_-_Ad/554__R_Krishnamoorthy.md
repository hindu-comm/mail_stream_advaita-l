Dear to
Bhagwan Sri Ramana Maharishi always left it to the devotee to find out for
himself the truth. He insisted on self enquiry. We have instances that the
persons including foreigners used to get their doubts cleared just by
sitting in His presence. He was a realised soul. He could effortlessly
grasp the sayings of the upanishads. So nothing to wonder how he speaks on
Gita etc. He was very simple to approach but great like the Himalayas.You
can read the book of His life by Sri Paul Brunton.
R. Krishnamoorthy.
