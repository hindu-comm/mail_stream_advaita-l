Namaste

Some people are criticizing Ramana Maharshi without understanding.

They are saying he was taking tobacco snuff and not caring how many
people died in World War. He was saying What happens if 5 million
people die? What if Hitler is a Jnani?  He was following caste system
in dining room, so on.
