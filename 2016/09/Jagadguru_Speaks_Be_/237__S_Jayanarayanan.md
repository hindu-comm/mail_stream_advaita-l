On occasions, man gets an opportunity to help others. His mind
also will be conducive. At such times he must be discreet in
rendering the help; he must consider whether that help will
benefit the seeker or not.

In other words, help must be given to one for whom it will be
useful. It must, of course, go to the needy, so that he will come
out of his problems.

For example, help can be rendered generously to a student to
pay his fees; to a good person who seeks help for his daughter's
wedding. Such help will be greatly appreciated. It will benefit
the giver also.

A wise saying illustrates this:

 ekamapi sataaM sukR^itaM vikasati tailaM yathaa jale nyastam.h .
 asataamupakaarashataM saMkuchati sushiitale ghR^itavat.h ..

It means that a single good deed rendered to a good person will
glimmer and spread like oil on water. But a hundred acts of
help rendered to a wicked person will shrink like ghee in cold
weather.

It is good to discriminate beforehand and offer the right help.
