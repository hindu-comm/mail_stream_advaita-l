True, but, if jnAna is not 100% (samyak), avidyA is not completely bAdhita ..

>  yes, that is the point.  Brahmavid brahmaiva bhavati says shruti.  Brahma vida is NOT different from brahman and he is verily brahman.  If we attribute even an iota of avidyA to the brahma vida it is as good as pasting the avidyA on brahman itself.  Even if you see vAlAgramapi (tip of the hair) anAtma, it is avidyAvasthA only insists shankara on the need of absolute Atmaikatva jnana.  If we still insist on 0.0001% of avidyA in jnana / jnAni it is as good as saying there is absolutely no 'trace' of snake it is only 'rope' BUT the tip of the tail of the snake is still be visible to the custodian of that 'rajju' jnana :-) Which is, no need to mention, untenable according to the Advaita's paripUrNa saMyak jnana.  

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
