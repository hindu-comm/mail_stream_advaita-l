As per the clarification from VenkatraghavanJi, mUlAvidyA is seen as jnAna

It means, this mUlAvidya is bhavarUpa (*anirvachanIyA)* in Brahman, though
Brahman is *ekam eva* advitIyam.

Pure Existence ( sad eva) also means possible presence of  bhavarUpa

If it is accepted as a padArtha, it cannot be a jnAna virOdhi as jnAna is
vastu tantra alone..
