 Namaste Sri Sadananda Sir

I have the doubts below.

How it is possible to get only intellectual Jnana and claim I am a
Jnani? Because you are saying Vaasanas may be there for a long time.
It is like a drunkard listening in day time to spiritual talks and in
the evening having drinks because of Vaasana. Can you say I have
understood Upanisads and Advaita but my Vaasanas are strong. Therefore
I have to wait for some more births to get liberation? Then what is
the use of this Jnana? I have to still struggle for more births. Are
you saying after Jnana there may be more births but there will not be
infinite number of births like Ajnani? Is this your meaning?

What is Jeevanmukti? Is it after Jnana the Vaasanas are also gone and
I have to only live remainder of this birth because of Prarabdha
Karma? Then I will get Moksha?

This is confusing me.

Even effects at the body level continue, even though intellectually one knows that it is a rope. Jaanam gained by intellect is not contradicted. Only emotional attachments persists.

Jnaanam removes the ajnanaam but ajnaana janya vaasanaas takes sometime to go. Even though the four fold qualifications are required, vedanta shravana starts before the complete purification - just as in many of us advaitins. The intellect is convinced but emotional mind due to remaining raaga dweshaas will linger on - To get rid of it it may take one life and even more than one life as in the case of Vaamadeva, he was a jnaani before and no one taught him when took the birth of vaamadeva. The same story may apply to Bhagavan Ramana, as people are arguing endlessly - even Brahmaji for that matter- If see Bri. Up. He was intially confused until the previous knowledge sinks in. In Uddhava geeta, there is Hamsa Geeta where Iswara has to come again to teach Brahmaji and sanatkumaaras -assuming this is different Brahmaji compared to the Bri. Up Brahmaji. Jadabharata story is also familiar.

>>  yes, that is the point.  Brahmavid brahmaiva bhavati says shruti.  Brahma vida is NOT different from brahman and he is verily brahman.  If we attribute even an iota of avidyA to the brahma vida it is as good as pasting the avidyA on brahman itself.  Even if you see vAlAgramapi (tip of the hair) anAtma, it is avidyAvasthA only insists shankara on the need of absolute Atmaikatva jnana.  If we still insist on 0.0001% of avidyA in jnana / jnAni it is as good as saying there is absolutely no 'trace' of snake it is only 'rope' BUT the tip of the tail of the snake is still be visible to the custodian of that 'rajju' jnana :-) Which is, no need to mention, untenable according to the Advaita's paripUrNa saMyak jnana.
