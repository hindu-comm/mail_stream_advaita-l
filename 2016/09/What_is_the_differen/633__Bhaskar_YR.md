From sushupti, isn't the the bhAshya clearly referring to kevala sath - सन्मात्रमेव केवलं वस्त्विति?

>  and bruhadAraNyaka further clarifies this state is crystal clear like water, he is one without second, he is abhaya, he is paramAtma, for jeeva it is parama gati, parama saMpat, parama lOka, paramAnanda etc.  From this it is clear that sushupti is the secondless state that we daily experience!! But from this, can we say just go to sleep and get mOksha?? No, though it is adviteeya state we donot know (jnAnAbhAva) that we are adviteeya there.  Shankara clarifies why there is no vishesha jnana in sushupti, it is because of 'ekatvaM' and not due to the existence of mUlAvidyA or kAraNAvidyA.  And elsewhere shankara further clarifies there is abhAva of avidyA in sushupti and it is ekaM eva adviteeyam hence there in sushupti there exists NO vishesha jnana (anyatva pratyupasthApakahetOH avidyAyAH abhAvAt).  However, shruti and shankara talks about 'tureeya' the fourth pAda, which is quite different from vishva, tejasa and prAjna,  why?? What is the need of mentioning the tureeya when prAjnA himself is secondless Atman??  A subject matter of another interesting discussion, which we have done and dusted somany times earlier without any amicable settlement :-) 

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
