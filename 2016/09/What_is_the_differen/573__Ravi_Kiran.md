Namaste

Please clarify :

1) avidyapratyupasthapita - conjured up by avidya -

Needless to say an absence of anything including knowledge can
conjure nothing.


That Brahman alone is the substratum for Maya - and it is none other than
the
Parabrahman's intrinsic innate Shakti - and that it alone is Avidya. Such an
avidya then cannot be an absence - Brahman with the "absence of knowledge"
cannot "like a magician" conjure up a multi-variegated appearance.

----

what do you refer by the phrase " absence of anything including knowledge"
or
 "absence - Brahman with the "absence of knowledge" ?

Is it tattva-agrahanam ?

In that sense, you are stating that -

avidya is not just tattva-agrahanam, but more an entity like - beeja shakti
(which has Parameshwara as ashraya), and has some rendering power and aids
in videha-mukti, after one attains vidyA (which destroys avidyA) ? Is this
so?


The existence of such a causal potentiality beejashakti renders it moreover
possible that the released souls muktanam should not enter on new courses
of existence, as it is destroyed by perfect knowledge vidyaya.

Is this based on some prakriya ? Can you share where such details are
discussed ?

Thanks
