Are you saying that, as per this understanding ( vivarana?) , both tulAvidyA  and mUlAvidyA are removed/destroyed/sublated upon sadAtmana ekatva jnAna prApti ?

Yes, through tattvajnAna (the Atma jnana)  avidyA will be removed completely.  And to the question, how can this mUlAvidyA be destroyed when it is something different from jnAnAbhAva, anyathAgrahaNa and saMshaya and which is bhAva rUpa and has the locus (Ashraya) in brahman itself??  The answer they give is, since the jnAnAbhAva etc. are jnana virOdhi, they will be destroyed by the dawn of jnana, the mUlAvidyA too which is jnana virOdhi gets destroyed by the jnana.  And interestingly they say for the adhyAsa upAdAna is this mUlAvidyA, when adhyAsa goes ( i.e. correct knowledge of rope in place of snake) the knowledge of rajju jnana will not destroy the mUlAvidyA but at that sandhi samaya (juncture) the sarpa etc. get laya (merged) in their cause i.e. mUlAvidyA that is all.  In short rajju jnana of the jeeva would destroy the adhyAsa (mithyAjnAna of sarpa  i.e. tUlAvidyA).

You can wait for more authentic answer from the subscribers of this type of avidyA nivrutti as I am not a part of it.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!
