Yes, if mUlAvidyA is accepted as jnAna virodhi and there are no
requirements for samAdhi abhyAsa etc for its destruction, there are no
questions.

Just for my understanding, would like to read more on this mUlAvidyA and
its destruction through Atma jnAna (how it is explained), if it is covered
somewhere earlier ( articles or links).

Thanks
