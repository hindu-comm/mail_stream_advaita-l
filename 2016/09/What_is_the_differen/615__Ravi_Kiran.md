If this is accepted as a result of avidyA (lesha) or diK brama (as it is
subjective), the jnAna nisTatha, which is considered as the pinnacle in
jnAna sAdhana would be another term for the paripUrNa saMyak jnAna
(dArDhya) of the svarUpa, which you are saying here. Is it not so or is
there more to it (from jnAna standpoint, without adding reference from JMV,
like mano nAsha or vAsana ksaya, at upAdhi level etc ?)
