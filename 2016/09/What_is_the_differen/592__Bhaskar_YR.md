the bhAshya says :

सदेव सदिति अस्तितामात्रं वस्तु सूक्ष्मं निर्विशेषं सर्वगतमेकं निरञ्जनं निरवयवं विज्ञानम्, 
Is it not clearly paramArthika sat mentioned before creation ?

>  Yes, but somewhere in sUtra bhAshya (4th adhyAya I reckon) shankara clarifies in shruti whenever brahman taught through creation it is apara brahman (kArya brahman) and when the brahman taught not considering the creation, jneya brahma it is para brahman.  When the gold is being taken as ring, bangles etc. it is kArya drushti, when the gold is mere / kevala gold without considering its kArya i.e. ring, bangle etc. it is GOLD only NOT bangle or ring.  

How it is possible to admit avidyA in paramArthika sat before creation ?

>  very legitimate question indeed.  Those who propagate the avidyA beeja Shakti in parabrahman would say it is with the associating of this avidyA beeja Shakti (mUlAvidyA) brahman does the creation.  So according to them when you talk about the creation, you have to accept the avidyA and its locus should be brahman before creation.  This declaration is because of no difference between mAya and avidyA in their dictionary :-) However, some others would say parabrahman svabhAva (not its attributes, itareya up. And bhAshya show this and shankara elsewhere clarifies that from the paramArtha drushti when there is one without second 'Ishwara's attributes like omniscience and omnipotence are in the spehere of avidyA)  itself is sarvajnatvaM and sarvashaktitvaM it is NOT something like avidyA beeja Shakti or mUlAvidyA, it is 'mAya' which is brahmAbhinna when it comes to creation.  ajOpi sannavyayAtmA bhUtAnAM IshvarOpi san, prakrutiM svAm adhishtAya, saMbhavAmyAtmamAyayA says geetA chArya and bhAshyakAra clarifies this Ishwara is avidyA vinirmukta forever in sUtra bhAshya.  

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
