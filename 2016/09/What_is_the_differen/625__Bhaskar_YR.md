praNAms Sri Sadananda prabhuji
Hare Krishna

Very beautiful narrative about the jnAni's body after realization.  Vyakti-vAsana kshaya and continuation of samashti vAsana, a very new perspective indeed and we have not discussed this point of view when we were discussing jnAni-s BMI in other list.  To be frank with you, it is very appealing to worship our guru-s as brahma, vishNu, maheshwara and parabrahma.  But from your previous explanation of jnAni's 'emotional attachment' to fear in 'his' mind, please clarify  whether it is due to vyakti vAsana or samashti vAsana or remains of erstwhile vyakti (jnAni as individual) vAsana in the overall (samashti) vAsana??  Since in the beginning itself you have clarified it is ONLY your understanding, I donâ€™t want to have the bhAshya pramANa for this and your further clarification would suffice.  

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
Bhaskar

PraNAms
As I understand (just so that I am not asked to quote references) - 

The praarabda has two components - one comes from vyakti and other comes for samaShTi. Hence vyakti vaasana-kshaya does not necessarily make the jnaani to die. The samaShTi vaasanas keep the body alive. SamaShTi can be thought of Lord - In essence the body is kept alive for Lord's work. When there are ripe students who need a teacher, they will be led to the mahatma and he cannot but teach - as part of aachrya RiNa or SamashTi vaasanaas. Krishna only says - tat viddhi praNipaatena pariprashnena sevayaa - and then says upadeshyanti .. The teacher will teach - that comes form samaShti vaasanaas or more politely one can say as Acharya RiNa.

Since brahavit brahma eva bhavati - now jnaani has become Brahman- which is totality- hence Brahman is now teaching in the body of jnaani. Hence we pray - the teacher as Iswara. 

Hence jnaani's body does not have to die if there are no vaasanaas. Vasanas are symbolized as snake - Lord Vishnu sleeps on it and Lord Shiva decorates himself with it. These are samashTi vaasanaas longing for the attention of the Lord.
Hari Om!Sadananda


      From: Venkatesh Murthy via Advaita-l <advaita-l at lists.advaita-vedanta.org>

But it is good for the Jnani to keep good Vaasanaas and kill only the bad Vaasanaas. Otherwise we cannot see examples like Adi Sankara. If he had zero Vaasanaas how could he work continuously and travel and preach Advaita?

If a person has zero Vaasanaas and zero desires he becomes like a dead person appearing to be living. It is not Jeevanmukti but JeevanmRti to other though he may be realized. Therefore it is good to keep good Vaasanaas like worship of God, conversation with good people, showing compassion and helping others Paropakaara and so on. What is JMV saying on Sattwika Vaasanas like this?
