Nice to see, how quickly you quote/produce all these texts from bhAshya / Sruti on any advaita thread ..

It is just because ‘charvita-charvaNa’ of these bhAshya vAkhya-s have done somany times earlier ☺   It is just a matter of recalling  those vAkya-s from old discussions and presenting it afresh for the perusal of new prabhuji-s in this list.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!

Similarly, for the jnAni there is no avidyA in reality, but to answer questions like the ones you raised we provisionally say until the prArabdha is exhausted,  avidyAlesha is there. He cannot have avidyA because jnAna has destroyed avidyA, and it's harmful effects like delusion and bondage are not felt by the jnAni.

>  Yes this what shankara says in geeta bhAshya : lOkavyavahAra sAmAnya darshanena tu laukikaiH ArOpita kartrutve bhiktanAdau karmaNi kartA bhavati, svAnubhAvenatu shAstra pramANa janitena akartaiva...It is only in the ajnAni's view jnAni's vyavahAra, jnAni's kartrutva, bhOktrutva, avidyA lesha, prArabdha karma etc.  in reality he is akartru, abhOktru as he was / is / will be ashareeri only.  Even though we ajnAni-s looking at the jnAni's BMI and its vyavahAra he is ashareeri and vyavahArateeta only.  vidvAn sa ehaiva brahma yadyapi dehavAniva lakshyate sa brahmaiva san brahmApyeti.  Without knowing this ashareeratvaM of jnAni, sometimes we tempted to attribute even kAma-krOdha too this jnAni due to his prArabdha karma phala vishesha and avidyA lesha and dare to say, when compared to other mortals (ajnAni-s) these kAma-krOdha would subside comparatively in less time  in jnAni  but he is not free from it.

It depends on - who is saying to whom ? :) in lOka dRSTi or Atma dRSTi :)
