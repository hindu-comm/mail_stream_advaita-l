so, we are accepting mUlAvidyA presence(bhAva rupa)  in Pure Existence
( nitya-shuddha-buddha-mukta
Brahma svarUpa), though as mithyA ? ( just like jagat experience as mithyA

In that case, Pure Existence was never without mUlAvidyA (though mithyA) ?

Existence alone IS :)

Isn't the context , in the beginning ( before creation, before jagat,
before world).. Pure Existence alone IS ( without any mithyA) ?  :)
