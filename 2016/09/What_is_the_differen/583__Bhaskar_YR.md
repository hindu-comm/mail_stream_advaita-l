Yes, if mUlAvidyA is accepted as jnAna virodhi and there are no requirements for samAdhi abhyAsa etc for its destruction, there are no questions.

FYI, according to some traditional Advaita Acharya-s, after removal of avidyA there should be an experience of Atma sAkshAtkAra (brahma sAkshAtkAra that he is adviteeya).  To experience it the means are shravaNa and manana.  So, shravaNa and manana mean dhAraNa (like in yOga school) and nidhidhyAsana means ‘dhyAna’ on that holding (concentrated) object (here it is shAstra vAkya) and darshana means samAdhi.  And in this samAdhi, Atma sAkshAtkAra (adviteeya jnana) happens which removes the sAkshAtkAra of jagat (the world of duality).

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
