The JMV is clear that even sāttvika vasnas have to be given up in order to
be in the highest state of jivanmukti. These vasanas (daivī sampat) have to
be developed in order to dislodge the other bandhaka vasanas (āsurī sampat)
and once that has been achieved, even these have to be given up.  Someone
may present the exact lines from JMV.  Even in the BG 14th ch. this idea is
admitted: one has to become (tri)guṇātīta, that is, rise above even sattva.
This is because, the verse says: sattva binds one to sukha and jnana.
