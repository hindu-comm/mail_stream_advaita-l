The bhAva rUpa of avidyA is also vyAvahArika only, not pAramaArthika. The
removal of mUlAvidyA is like the removal of any mithyA vastu - through
jnAna of adhishThAna. Any mithyA vastu has some bhAva rUpa in vyavahAra
right? How do we say that is sublated?  Same way for avidyA too. Whether it
is bhAva rUpa or abhAva rUpa, when jnAna arises it ceases to be. (and it
never was nor will be).

I am not sure what Sri Bhaskar is talking about. So I am only answering
your last question above, Atyantika avidyA nivritti is because avidyA like
any mithyA object is traikAlika bAdha pratoyogi. So once jnAna arises one
realises that avidyA never was, is, will be. Whether it is bhAva or abhAva
does not make a difference.

mUlAvidyA is indeed destroyed upon jnAna, so this consideration is moot.
