Bhaskarji - PraNAms
As I see it fits in correctly. Jnaani-ajnaani all in vyavahaara only - has not validity from the paaramaarthika point. 

VyashTi and samaShTi vaasanaas are not really new concept. When somebody causing mass scale destruction or even construction, it is the samaShTi vaasanaas operating. The whole creation of 14 lokas is on that basis, is it not? When I am born in a particular family - it is not only my vaasaanaas but my parents and my sibling,s and even that of doctors, hospital staff and maids etc - all their vaasanaas are involved - right? 

When Krishna says - yagnaartham karma - yagna involves cooperative action from the participants that contribute to the results and hence vaasaanaas too - both at individual level and at the samashTi level. Hence any organizational work involves samashTi vaasanaas and associated results.
When that yagna is done is self-sacrificing mode then Krishna says for him who does that his vyashTi vaasanas will not be there. Hence karma-bandhanam depends on the attitude in performing the yagnaa - since yagna also means Lord, yagnaartham karma - involves attitude in performing that action. 

Thus there is connection between vyashti and samaShTi in all actions that one performs - stating from the family level.
At the individual level - vyashTi vaasana-kshaya - will not necessarily eliminate samashTi vaasanas - just as even Jnaani if he is married - will have to go though samaShTi demands at the family level and similarly at larger levels - village, town, nation etc.
However Jnaani looks at the samashTi imposed actions are part of Iswara iccha - and his actions then become loka kalyaanam. 

All these are inter related and logical too.

Very beautiful narrative about the jnAni's body after realization. Vyakti-vAsana kshaya and continuation of samashti vAsana, a very new perspective indeed and we have not discussed this point of view when we were discussing jnAni-s BMI in other list. To be frank with you, it is very appealing to worship our guru-s as brahma, vishNu, maheshwara and parabrahma. But from your previous explanation of jnAni's 'emotional attachment' to fear in 'his' mind, please clarify whether it is due to vyakti vAsana or samashti vAsana or remains of erstwhile vyakti (jnAni as individual) vAsana in the overall (samashti) vAsana?? Since in the beginning itself you have clarified it is ONLY your understanding, I donâ€™t want to have the bhAshya pramANa for this and your further clarification would suffice. 

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
Bhaskar
