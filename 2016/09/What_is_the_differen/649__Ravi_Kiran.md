Namaste Praveenji

As per one line of thought, there is no need to posit avidyA (locus) in
nirguna nirvisesha Brahman (though Brahman is opposed to Nothing, as seen
in creation), as avidyA/mAya is upAdhi Ashrita, but never in para brahman,
though it (avidyA/mAya) is accepted as Brahman's own  (dvaya) AbhAsa or
spandanam (ananyatvam in kArya and kArana)

As per the discussion we had yday, the locus of (mUla) avidyA is admitted
in sat padArtha Brahman ( nirguna or para ) itself and it is traikAlika
bAdhita with the rising of knowledge.

Thanks
