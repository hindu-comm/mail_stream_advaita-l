The obstacles for nishta is discussed extensively by Goudapaada. Vidyaranya also talks about I think in the 9th or 10th Chapter of Panchadashi where he talks about nidhidhyaasana or meditation on aham brahmaasmi - after gaining the jnaanam. The difference between jnaanam and jnaana nishta is all about paroxa and aparoxa jnanaam.
