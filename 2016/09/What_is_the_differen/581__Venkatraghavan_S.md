All things you mention in this paragraph are true for jnAna virodha avidyA
also. If there are specific issues that require clarification, please ask.

The removal of mUlAvidyA is like the removal of any mithyA vastu - through
jnAna of adhishThAna. Any mithyA vastu has some bhAva rUpa in vyavahAra
right? How do we say that is sublated?  Same way for avidyA too. Whether it
is bhAva rUpa or abhAva rUpa, when jnAna arises it ceases to be. (and it
never was nor will be).

your last question above, Atyantika avidyA nivritti is because avidyA like
any mithyA object is traikAlika bAdha pratoyogi. So once jnAna arises one
realises that avidyA never was, is, will be. Whether it is bhAva or abhAva
does not make a difference.
