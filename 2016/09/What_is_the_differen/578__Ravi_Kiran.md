If there is any further explanation /elaboration behind this mention - that
mUlAvidya, which is bhAva rUpa (Ashrita in Brahman), is removed by Sruti
vAkya janita tattvajnAna alone without need for other abhyAsa, pl share the
links or articles.

Interesting..if laya (merge) is accepted, isn't there a possibility to
emerge back/manifest at a future time ? how it is explained as Atyantika
avidyA nivrutti ?

which also implies mUlAvidya cannot be destroyed like tUlAvidyA (upon
attaining tattva jnAna), but there is some mystic component (beeja shakti,
doing its part to release souls?)


In short rajju jnana of the jeeva would destroy the adhyAsa (mithyAjnAna of
