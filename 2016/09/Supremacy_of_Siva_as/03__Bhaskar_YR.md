"अहं चैव महादेवो न भिन्नः परमार्थतः"

>  Yes, indeed, paramArthataH no difference between mahadeva and mahavishNu and in that ultimate reality (paramArthataH) no difference between jeeva (mortals) and brahma (immortal) as well.  But participating advaitins here confirmed that their deity is the ONLY supreme godhead in the vyavahAra where Ishwara holds sway over jeeva and jagat :-) You see, problem is not simple as we think :-)

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar

Subject: [Advaita-l] Supremacy of Siva as Brahman

Namaste,

Bhagavan Narayana in कूर्म पुराण in the form of  कूर्मनारायण vide 2nd chapter says :

"अहं चैव महादेवो न भिन्नः परमार्थतः"

When Gods themselves declared their equal status, who are we to decide their credibility.

regs,
sriram
