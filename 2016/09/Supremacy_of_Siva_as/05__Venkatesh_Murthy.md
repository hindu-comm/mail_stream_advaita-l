’अग्नीषोमीयं पशुमालभेत’ इत्यत्र ’द्विपादश्चतुश्पादश्च पशवः’ इति
श्रुत्या द्विपाच्चतुष्पादश्च पशुशब्दवाच्यत्वेन निर्देशात्सन्देहे

Sruti is saying Animal must be sacrificed for Agni and Soma and also
Animals are two legged and four legged. Here there will be a doubt
what is the animal Pashu for the sacrifice?

But this doubt is cleared by another Sruti saying -

छागस्य वपाया मेदसो अनुब्रूहि इति श्रुत्यन्तरेण छागपशुत्वनिर्णयवत्
शिवस्य ब्रह्मत्वं ग्राह्यम्

This Sruti has very clearly said the animal is a goat. Similarly the
Sruti is saying Brahman in many places but we get a doubt who is
Brahman? Vishnu or Siva? But in Svetashvatara Upanishad the Sruti has
very clearly given explanation of Siva as Brahman. Examples -   यो
देवानां प्रभवश्चोद्भवश्च विश्वाधिपो रुद्रो महर्षिः । हिरण्यगर्भं
जनयामास पूर्वं स नो बुद्ध्या शुभया संयुनक्तु || and एको हि रुद्रो न
द्वितीयाय तस्थुः

Therefore the conclusion is Siva is Para Brahman.
