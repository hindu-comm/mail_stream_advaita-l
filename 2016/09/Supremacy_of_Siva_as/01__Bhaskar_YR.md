We need to rise above these petty issues .....O how long we would be trapped in this quagmire of supremacy of one god over another....

>  till we meet both of them in person, physically verifying  the corresponding testimonials in presence of them and hearing their arguments in defense of their supremacy over other :-) 

Seems to be childish ....quarrelling for a particular toy in the shop

>  I have seen this type of fight among the fans of two South Indian Sandalwood superstars of yester years i.e. Dr. Rajkumar and Dr. Vishnuvardhan :-) And even today there is a big question who is the real BOSS of Bollywood whether it is Salman or Sharukh Khan :-) But I could  understand the sentimental attachment of these fans to their respective heros because once upon a time I too was a victim of this same bigoted attachment to one particular deity :-) Supreme and demi gods were vivid in my mind at that time :-)

>  No offence is meant to any one deity follower here but it is quite evident from these discussion that age and wisdom would not guarantee the maturity.  

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
