Shri Jaldhar

Since you are the moderator I am answerable to you. I believe I must
be allowed an opportunity to respond to the various allegations
against me. I think you should hear my side, before you contemplate
action against me. Please allow me to contact you offline if that is
ok with you.

Thanks
Gayatri
