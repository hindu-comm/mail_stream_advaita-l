Thankyou.  There is a fine line and I'm not always sure I am maintaining 
it correctly.  Overall the point of this list is to assist astika 
followers of the Smarta sampradaya in understanding the siddhanta.  It is 
not a general forum for debates or parading ones pet theories.  However 
sometimes it is helpful to hear opposing views as long they are given in 
good faith, reasonably and respectfully.

My main concern at the moment is whether D. Gayatri has been dissembling 
in his/her identity and motives for joining the list.  (Quoting the 
Narayanastra blog is a huge red flag.)  Lying about such things is grounds 
for immediate expulsion.
