not appropriate here as we are talking of two different spheres of
knowledge. One is worldly knowledge, aparA vidyA, whose knowledge is
derived from pratyaksha pramANa and the other is spiritual knowledge, aparA
vidyA, which depends on shruti pramANa. To understand what shruti pramANa
has to say, one needs to be able to interpret it correctly and for this one
needs a sampradAya guru.
