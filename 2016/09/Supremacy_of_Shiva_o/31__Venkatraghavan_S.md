//One is worldly knowledge, aparA vidyA, whose knowledge is derived from
pratyaksha pramANa and the other is spiritual knowledge, aparA vidyA, which
depends on shruti pramANa.//

<<The question of history of the Shankara mutts and the personality of
Shankara, and scholarly analysis of his bhAshyas does not require Shruti
pramANa, since these are available to pratyaksha and anumAna. >>

The first of the three items referred by you in the paragraph above
(history of Shankara matha) is available to pratyaksha and anumana,
however, the third, ie the analysis of Shankara bhAshya to determine
tAtparya, should be according to sampradAya, and not contradictory to it.
The second one, ie commentary on the personality of Shankara, I would argue
is probably best preserved in tradition, unless it is argued that modern
scholars have the extra sensory perception to delve back a 1000 years to
make any statement on it which is not anything more than conjecture.

Coming to the topic of this thread, which is the interpretation of Shankara
bhAshya, if any scholar is deviating from sampradAya in interpreting
Shankara bhAshya, that is a serious flaw in my opinion. The tAtparya of
Shankara bhAshya is nirguna Brahman.

I am neither qualified to comment on or interested in the historicity of
Shankara or Shankara mathas, so I haven't commented on the other thread.
All I was pointing out was what I perceived to be slight double standards.
While you were pointing out that some western scholars' views on vedAnta
should be accepted, you were unprepared to accept any element of
historicity to any traditional accounts preserved in mathas.

Regards,
Venkatraghavan
