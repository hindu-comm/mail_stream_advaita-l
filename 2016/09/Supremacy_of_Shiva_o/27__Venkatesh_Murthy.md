Your advice should be to Western scholars also. They should not assume
superiority just because they are from rich countries and fair complexion.

Westerner Roth has said Sayana was ritualistic and he could not give proper
meaning for Vedic mantras. How can Roth with no Upanayana Samskara know
more about Vedas than Sayana? Is it possible in this Mleccha Janma for Roth
to know more than Brahmin Sayana about Vedas? Never.

Same Logic will apply here. How can the Mleccha Paul Hacker without
Upanayana Samskara have any authority to study and understand Adi
Sankara's Bhashya and comment he was Vaishnava. This Mleccha Paul
hacker can never understand Adi Sankara Bhashyas because he has not
studied it under a Guru in the Sampradaya.

He can publish papers and get appreciation in Western circles but in
Sringeri circles he will get a big Zero.

They say Half Knowledge is dangerous. These Western scholars have only
Half knowledge because they study in very unorthodox manner. Who knows
how they study? They give conclusions with this Half knowledge and
confuse everybody.
