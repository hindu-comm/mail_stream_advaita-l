Sankara refutes the Vaishnava (spec. Bhagavata) position in the Brahmasutrabhasya (2.2.42-45).

Amazing that the authorship of the Panchapadika is not doubted, but one freely
doubts the authorship of the Sri Shiva Panchakshara Stotram, Dakshinamurthy Stotram, etc.!

The Shalagrama stone is a small stone that can be placed on one's palm,
whereas there are Lingams so large that it takes a person several seconds to go around!
Here's an example of Sankara using this as a mere analogy:

This "stock example is probably because the image of Vishnu closely resembles the Deity,
whereas the Lingam does not closely resemble Shiva Himself! In fact, the Mahabharata
(and probably other texts) claims that the worship of Shiva Lingam is superior to the
worship of Shiva's Image!

In his commentary on the Kena Upanishad, Adi Sankara says that Uma, the daughter of Himavan,
is eternally associated with Omniscient Ishvara.

This is too silly! Devadatta is merely a "Placeholder name", like "Tom, Dick and Harry" in English!

The "Narayana" of the Narayana Suktam is (transcending) the Trinity of Brahma, Hari, and Shiva.

The commentary here is almost completely about Sannyasa, any references to Vaishnavism is beyond remote!

There is nothing disparaging here whatsoever. It's simply a matter of Karma vs. Jnana:

GOAL of svarga or "heaven" = GOOD in Karma-Kanda = LOW/CHEAP in Jnana-Kanda

Sankara says that although attaining the status of the Devas, Pitris and Vinayakas is indeed Karmically high,
it is not Moksha.Much like Gita 8.16, where even the status of Brahma the Creator is disparaged!
BTW, the word "Bhuta" is NOT a "bad" thing,as Vishnu Himselfcalled by these "SACRED NAMES" in his Sahasranama:

5 OM bhUtakR^ite namaH . (Salutations to the One who Created Beings.)
6 OM bhUtabhR^ite namaH . (Salutations to the One who Sustains Beings.)
8 OM bhUtAtmane namaH . (Salutations to the One who is the Self of Beings.)
