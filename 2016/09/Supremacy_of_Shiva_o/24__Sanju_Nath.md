The analogy of computers, etc also relies on standing on the shoulders of previous scientists.  There is a parampara of first learning physics, engineering, software, etc from teachers for many years before one is competent enough to further inventions.

Same or more important is the case of understand Vedic literature.  This sampradya starts in Bharat for many milleniums.  The issue with western thinkers is that they trace or attribute very rarely (other than a perfunctory list of attributions whose value is secondary to their "original" thinking).  Who is the guru, etc of Paul Hacker, other Western thinkers doesn't matter whereas Indian tradition dismisses those who learn the Vedas outside the guru parampara.

Strange how topsy-turvy the learning is in the West:  science requires a parampara, but Vedas - all free to study and attack.  Science has succeeded in the west because of the parampara of knowledge being learned and handed down by successive scientists, and not everyone doing their own thing, as attempted by them regarding Vedas , puranas, itihaas, smritis, sutras.
