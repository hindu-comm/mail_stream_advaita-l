Thought Advaita is all about attaining liberation or mokSa or sadyo mukti
(sarva dukha nivrutti and paramAnanda prApti) through jivAtma paramAtma
ekatva ( paramArtha or advaita) jnAna in this very life (as far as
spiritual aspirants are concerned).

For others, they will surely have other goals and objectives..

Note: If each participant can add a tag to the thread they start, stating -
Intended for spiritual aspirants or Academic or Others(specify?) - it would
draw members interested in such discussions :)
