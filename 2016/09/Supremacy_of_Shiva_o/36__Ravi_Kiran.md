So True, it is rather very unfortunate that instead of focusing the
discussions on the Sruti / bhAshya tAtparya which will lead us to the goal
promised in the Upanishads, the discussions tends to
distract/deviate/mislead by investing much reality into vyavahArikaa (
which could well be hethvAbhAsa) and terming it as advaita, which does not
take one, anywhere near to the Sruti tAtparya,  but, well into anAdi avidyA
parampara..
