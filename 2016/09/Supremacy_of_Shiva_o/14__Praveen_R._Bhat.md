Sorry, fixing herewith the oversight errors in two statements of mine in
the previous mails:

"An absence of proof doesn't no mean proof of absence" should read as "An
absence of proof doesn't mean proof of absence".

"I am afraid Clark doesn't barely understands whats Shaiva means!!" should
read as "I am afraid Clark barely understands what Shaiva means !!"

Kind rgds,
