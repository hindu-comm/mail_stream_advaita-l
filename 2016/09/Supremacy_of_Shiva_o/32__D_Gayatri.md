//however, the third, ie the analysis of Shankara bhAshya to determine
tAtparya, should be according to sampradAya, and not contradictory to it. //

Is there any reason why this should be so? For example, does it require
sAmpradAya, to count how many times Shankara has quoted the BU in his BSB?
Or does it require sAmpradAya to know whether or not he has used the word
vivarta anywhere? Aren't these available to perception and inference? And
moreover, what guarantee do you have that the sAmpradAya never evolved and
is static? Aren't there advaitins like Sri SSS who thought that later
advaitins changed the meaning of Shankara's teachings?


//The second one, ie commentary on the personality of Shankara, I would
argue is probably best preserved in tradition, unless it is argued that
modern scholars have the extra sensory perception to delve back a 1000
years to make any statement on it which is not anything more than
conjecture.//


Does it really require an extra sensory perception? Don't you think, the
works of Shankara or his disciples cannot provide any clues?


//While you were pointing out that some western scholars' views on vedAnta
should be accepted, you were unprepared to accept any element of
historicity to any traditional accounts preserved in mathas.//


Sorry, I never said any western scholar's views should be accepted without
question. You are welcome to check my messages. I have no personal affinity
to Hacker's theories. If you have any evidence contradicting Hacker, you
are welcome to present it.
