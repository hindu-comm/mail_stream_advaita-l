If nothing, this can be taken on mere shraddhA.

Even Bhagavatpadacharya's not being an avatAra of Shiva would take away
nothing from his teachings, with no parallel, of non-duality, not
vaishvavism!

That is to say, which is really no proof at all. This is something that is
talked about as an error even in archeological findings too. An absence of
proof doesn't no mean proof of absence.

I particularly find that the orthodox culture that is needed as the
foundation of such "analysis" is amiss among most of these Western/ modern
scholars. There seems to be absolutely no understanding of kuladevatA,
iShTadevatA and rUDhyartha and other possible meanings of the words in the
language during such analysis. Some of these points are seen in the
examples given below.

I could argue either way with this. Padmapadacharya may be merely saying
that his teacher though Shiva Himself didn't wear any marks of Shiva. But
since you start by saying that he had "merely the name of Shankara", lets
say he was not an avatAra, and he was not a Shaivite, but it is far-fetched
to say that he was a Vaishnava.

This can easily be set aside by saying that Bhagavatpadacharya's
pUrvAshrama kuladevatA was Vishnu.

Same as above. Also I could even argue that it is more likely that Shiva
avatAra would give examples of Vishnu than himself. This is seen in many
stories related to Shiva, including the interpretation of the samAsa
rAmeshvara which Shiva seems to have told Narada Muni to be rAmaH Ishvara
yasya saH. :)

Along with kuladevatA, it can also be seen as iShTadevatA.

Sorry, this is absolutely funny. :) Moreover, I don't see how Devadatta and
Yajnadatta are Vaishnava names!

Could you please quote the Gita verse here please? Meanwhile, bhUta has
many meanings in the language, one being devatA. Moreover, Bhagavatpada
established panchAyatana pUja, which includes Ganesha.

Sringeri and Kanchi are not Shaiva institutions. I am afraid Clark doesn't
barely understands whats Shaiva means!!

Kind rgds,
