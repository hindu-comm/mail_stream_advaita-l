Unfortunately even the arguments classified as affirmative are specious
too. Classifying Shankaracharya's vision as Vaishnava or Shaiva based on
stray quotations is missing the wood for the trees.

The tAtparya of his bhAshyas is very clear - that the one, limitless
nirguNa Brahman is the highest reality established in the Upanishads, and
the understanding of oneself to be that reality is the highest, most
glorious goal worth striving for.

Regards,
Venkatraghavan
