Namaste Ravi Kiran ji
Exactly the reference i was reminded of. The key point is to first have a
common understanding or convergence for the word विद्या . If all agree that
य एव अविद्यादिदोषनिवृत्तिफलकृत्प्रत्ययः आद्यः अन्त्यः सन्ततः असन्ततो वा, स
एव विद्या there are certain implications.

In the above the word अविद्यादि refers to avidyA, shoka, bhaya etc.
Therefore the existence of such shoka and bhaya etc., in a person even
after shravanam and mananam has to mean that whatever pratyaya has taken
place by the grace of Ishvara is no doubt a great blessing but it cannot
yet be exalted by the lofty label of vidyA or jnAnam. It is still to be
regarded as provisional. And such विपरीता भावना like shoka and bhaya re
still indicative of lingering remanants of अध्यास. Otherwise the sadhanas
collectively called nidhidhyAsanam to remove विपरीता भावना becomes
superfluous.

Great caution is advisable in this regard else one can end up rationalizing
all ones desires, saMkalpas and even actions which are born of avidyA as
falling under the more benign विपरीता प्रत्यय which are due to प्रारब्ध and
which bhAShyakAra compares to a released arrow.

My understanding is that there is a very subtle difference between shoka
and bhaya which are removed by vidyA as defined above and the more benign
viparita pratyaya mentioned by bhAShyakAra in saying येन कर्मणा शरीरमारब्धं
तत्

No wonder shAstra enjoins sannyAsa. Such a lifestyle alone makes the
distinction clear as to which of the pratyayas a person is experiencing are
born of lingering avidyA and hence are opposed ti vidya;
And which are due purely to prArabdha. If a person truly fancies himself to
have arrived at vidyA as defined by bhAShyakAra, the intellectually honest
course for him is sannyAsa like yAjnavalkya. Rather than rationalizing his
continuance in external pravRtti marga by referring to exceptions like
Janaka and Indra etc.  Such is my understanding of बृहदारण्यक 1.4.10 भाष्य

In a more anecdotal manner we can see in Sri Ramana Maharshi's life his
deep empahy to the point of shedding tears with one aged devotee Echhammal
who lost her only psychological support in life viz., her adopted grandson.
Such a viparita pratyaya due to prArabdha cannot be said to be the same as
moha-born grief experienced by people in general.

If this is so (avidya - cause for bondage, is not completely removed after
jnAna prApti), how would one reconcile/relate with
Br.Up 1.4.10 bhAshya - starting with

अविद्याशोकमोहभयादिदोषनिवृत्तेः प्रत्यक्षत्वादिति चोक्तः परिहारः..

and ending with ..

‘ज्ञानाग्निः सर्वकर्माणि भस्मसात्कुरुते’ (भ. गी. ४-३७) इत्यादिस्मृतिभ्यश्च
॥
