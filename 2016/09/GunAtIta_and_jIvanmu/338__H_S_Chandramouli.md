Just a clarification sri Sujal Ji.

The part in my previous post   The succinct answer is << Because the
“anubhava”is advaitic (paramArthika, pure Bliss) when the vritti assumes
“brahmAkAra”. It is called “akhandAkAra vritti”  But the event is taking
place only at the vyAvahArika level. Hence vritti continues to exist. There
is no damage to advaita sidhAnta >>. is NOT from VC or the bhashya thereon.
It is just my understanding of the sidhanta. Thought it better to clarify.

I will post the translation desired by you later in the day.

regards
