Namaste Sri Ravi Ji,



Reg  << Noted, in JMV, the advaita (paramArthika) jnAna is told as
asamprajnAta samAdhi ( ref in Muktika Up 2.53,54) , which alone is termed
as nirvikalpaka samAdhi ? >>,



I have not read  Muktika Up. So I cannot comment.   The terms relating to
Samadhi appearing  even in advaitic literature sometimes pertain to a yogi
(who is not a jnani in the advaitic sense) and at other times  to a jnani.
Hence it is always difficult to understand significance the term samAdhi
correctly unless the context is clear. Atleast that is my understanding.



Regards
