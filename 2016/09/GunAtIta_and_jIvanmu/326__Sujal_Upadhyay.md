Namaste,

Yes, patanjalI yoga sUtra-s are dual in nature, but even maharShi patanjalI
in 2.22 has said that for GYAnI, the world in unreal

Two levels of truths is not only accepted by Shruti-s, but it is accepted
by dualist schools like Patanjali Yoga Sutra

कृतार्थ प्रति नष्टमऊयनष्ट तदन्यसाधारणत्वात्* ॥ २२ ॥

2.22 Though the object of experience becomes unreal to him who has reached
the state of liberation, it remains real to all other beings.

P.Y.S. by Swami Prabhavananda of Ramakrishna Ashram, Page 90

Another translation.

2.22 For the one who has attained the goal [of liberation, the seen]
disappears [yet, the seen] is not destroyed because of it's common
universality.

krta = done
arthan = purpose, goal
prati = towards, for
naSta = destroyed
api = even though
anaSTam = not destroyed
tad = that
anya = other
sAdhAraNatvAt = because of, due to commonality, universality

Kriya Yoga Sutras of Patanjali and the Siddhas by Marshal Govindan, Page, 86
