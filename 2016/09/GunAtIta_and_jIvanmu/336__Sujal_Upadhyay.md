Namaste Sri Chandramouli ji

Thank you. I have not read Sri Jagadguru's Bhashya on Vivekachudamani.
Please can you give me his commentary on sloka 362

VC 362. When the mind, thus purified by constant practice, is merged in
Brahman, then Samadhi passes on from the Savikalpa to the Nirvikalpa stage,
and leads directly to the realisation of the Bliss of Brahman, the One
without a second.

Thank you once again.


OM

Sujal
