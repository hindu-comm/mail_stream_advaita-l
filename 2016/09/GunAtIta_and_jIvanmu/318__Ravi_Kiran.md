Reference is from JMV in manonAsa prakarana, which is quoting muktika up.

Agree with the difference noted with yogi from jnAni.

Question is more with the (Atma darshana) jnAna itself ? what is the
difference ( if any, in lakSana etc), if you happen to know ?

where it (advaita jnAna) is considered as NS (if not from JMV) ?

Isn't NS also a yogic terminology synonymous with asamprajnAta samadhi ?

Thanks
