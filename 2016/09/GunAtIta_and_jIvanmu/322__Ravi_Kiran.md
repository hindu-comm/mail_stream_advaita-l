Yes..interesting to note, arising of Atma GYAnam is admitted by such
practices ( in bhAshya ).

Also, the below note from Anandagiri's tIkA ..

*Samādhi*—This state of complete identity with non-dual Brahman, arrived at
as a result of discrimination and negation of phenomena, is the Vedāntic
conception of *Samādhi. *(which is quite different from any mystical or
mechanical state described as *Samādhi* in the *Yoga* system).

Yes..as a path is admitted from GYAna utpatti (from shravaNa) to GYAna
nishTa ( saMyak GYAna)

 Yes..noted this term RtambharApraGYA in JMV.

One small addendum -  the word samAdhi in the verse is treated as a synonym

The implication is - GYAna is synonym for samAdhi as it is ananya (and
nirvikalpaka, since अन्तःकरण is void of all other vikAras or vishayas to
the exception of Brahma AkAra).
