bhAshya says,

विमुक्तश्च सन्विमुच्यते ; पुनः शरीरं न गृह्णातीत्यर्थः

Though already liberated, he acquires final liberation means that he does
not acquire a body again.


The liberation is in the absolute sense and there can be no action (or
upAsana) after the rise of knowledge, to be liberated again >>,



The bhashya for katha upanishat mantra 2-2-1 reads inter alia



<< अनुष्ठाय ध्यात्वा । ध्यानं हि तस्यानुष्ठानं सम्यग्विज्ञानपूर्वकम् । तं
सर्वैषणाविनिर्मुक्तः सन्समं सर्वभूतस्थं ध्यात्वा न शोचति ।

Translation by Swami gambhirananda   << anuShThAya, meditating, on Him to
whom this city belongs; or His anuShThAna(lit, performance) consists in
contemplation with a view to complete knowledge(footnotestates
Unobstructed,direct vision. BAlagopAlendra interprets
samyagvij~nAnapUrvakam as (meditation) that has complete realization as its
objective). Onewho, after becoming entirely free from all desires,
contemplates on Him as residing equally in all beings, na shochati, does
not grieve. How can there be any vision of fear, since there is no occasion
for sorrow after the attainment of fearlessness resulting from His
realization? Even here, (while still living), he becomes vimuktah,
free—free from thebondage of desire and duty, vreated by ignorance;
vimuktah cha, and having become free(while still living); vimuchyate, he
becomes emancipated, ie he does not takeup a body again. >>



Notice the requirement सर्वैषणाविनिर्मुक्तः (should be entirely free from
all desires) for a विमुक्त (vimukta),. Yagnavalkya, participating in the
Janakasabha, desires the thousand bejeweled cows offered as reward. So
though a jnani he has not overcome वित्तैषण (vittaiShaNa) (desire for
wealth). He debates heatedly in the debate and even curses one of the
participants and threatens another with dire consequences. He is not
completely rid of  शास्त्रवासना (shAstravAsanA). This can be deduced from
his own admission later when he desires to take to sanyasa for achieving
this very goal of overcoming all एषणा (eShaNA) (desires) and वासना (vAsanA).
Hence he is himself is not covered under this clause विमुक्तश्च सन्विमुच्यते
(vimuktashcha sanvimuchyate).



Hence certain sAdhanAs could be required even after attaining jnana to be
“free from bondage” which is the meaning of विमुक्त (vimukta).



This is based on JMV by Swami Vidyaranya.
