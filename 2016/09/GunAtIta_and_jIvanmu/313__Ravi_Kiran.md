If this is so (avidya - cause for bondage, is not completely removed after
jnAna prApti), how would one reconcile/relate with
Br.Up 1.4.10 bhAshya - starting with

अविद्याशोकमोहभयादिदोषनिवृत्तेः प्रत्यक्षत्वादिति चोक्तः परिहारः..

and ending with ..

‘ज्ञानाग्निः सर्वकर्माणि भस्मसात्कुरुते’ (भ. गी. ४-३७) इत्यादिस्मृतिभ्यश्च
॥
