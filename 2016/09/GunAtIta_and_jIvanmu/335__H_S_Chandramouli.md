Namaste Sri Sujal Ji,



Reg  << If vritti still remains, how can there be advaita? There is the one
who is holding vritti still. Please explain >>,



I would suggest reference to Viveka Chudamani verses 428/429 (Bhashya of
Sri Jagadguru) .



The succinct answer is << Because the “anubhava”is advaitic (paramArthika,
pure Bliss) when the vritti assumes “brahmAkAra”. It is called “akhandAkAra
vritti”  But the event is taking place only at the vyAvahArika level. Hence
vritti continues to exist. There is no damage to advaita sidhAnta >>.



Regards
