This mantra is part of the ShAnti pATha chanted by Advaitins everyday
before and after the study/teaching of the prasthanatraya.

antaryāmi Brāmaṇam as 'It is by being a mere witness, the impelling
happens.' And that Impeller is the Ātman of everyone.

power behind every organ, prāṇa, etc. In the crucial fifth mantra the

all organs but That which the organs themselves do not know. And most
importantly, Brahman is NOT that which people meditate upon as a deity
distinct from themselves.
