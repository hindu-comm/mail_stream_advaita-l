Just so that some don't misunderstand, let me clarify that Bhagavan
Sridhara Swamiji was initiated into Advaita sampradAya sannyAsa in
Shigehalli, Sirsi, by Swami Shivananda of Shigehalli maTha. He didn't take
this or any pITha offered.

The earlier Sringeri Jagadguru was visited by him.

And vice versa, if not the other way around. HH Abhinava Vidyatirtha
Swamiji had broken his journey at Delhi to meet Bhagavan Sridhara Swamiji
who was then there and he offered the Sringeri pITha.
