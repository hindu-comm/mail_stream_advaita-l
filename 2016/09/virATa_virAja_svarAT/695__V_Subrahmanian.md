Vividham raajate iti viraat. Viraat alone is viraaj. When prathamaa
vibhakti is used it is viraat; in other vibhaktis it declines as forms of
viraaj.

2. svarATa occurs in the very first shloka of bhAgavatam, and also
elsewhere in the same text.

Svayameva raajate iti svaraat. Same as stated with regard to viraat.

I remember a mantra: viraadasi svaraadasi samraadasi ...etc.

Others could give more information.
