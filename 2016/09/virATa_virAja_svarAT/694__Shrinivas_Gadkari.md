Namaste,
I would like to ask if list members can shed light on three technical terms that often occur inthe vedic literature, especially bhAgavatam: virATa, virAja, svarATa
Notes.1. virATa, and virAja occur in mantra 5 of puruSa sUkta also2. svarATa occurs in the very first shloka of bhAgavatam, and also  elsewhere in the same text.
Regards,Shrinivas Gadkari
