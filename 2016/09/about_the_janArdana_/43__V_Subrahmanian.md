The Sringeri website also says this:

//Shankaracharya in the Vishnusahsranama bhashya quotes from the Vishnu
purana to show that, one Lord alone assumes various names and functions and
that even the puranas talk of advaita as the ultimate truth.

“* It is one Lord janardana alone that assumes different names as Brahma,
Vishnu , shiva and so on, depending on the functions of srishti, sthiti or
samhara – creation, sustenanance and resolution” (vi. Pu. 1.2.64)//*

This Janārdana is beyond Avyakta and manifests due to the association of
Māyā in various forms.
