The more interesting thing from the same Sringeri mutt link is this -

{The exquisite form of*janArdhana *carved in granite flanked by*Sridevi and
bhudevi on two sides,* has*chaturbhuja with shanka, chakra abhaya mudra and
varada mudra, a gadha and a prabhavali*.}

So even the folks at Sringeri hold the opinion that Janardhana is
shanka-chakra-gadha-dhaari and is Lakshmipati. Looks like the theory that
Narayana is nirvisesha Brahman does not seem to be on firm traditional
ground.
