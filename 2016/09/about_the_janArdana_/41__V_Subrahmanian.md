This page of the Sringeri Mutt website gives a lot of information about the
Janādana Temple in the Sringeri Mutt campus:

http://www.sringeri.net/temples/sri-janardana

The information is relevant to Advaita as a philosophy as well, apart from
proving wrong that the idea that 'the Sringeri Mutt is predominantly
Shaiva'.

//Shankaracharya in the Vishnusahsranama bhashya quotes from the Vishnu
purana to show that, one Lord alone assumes various names and functions and
that even the puranas talk of advaita as the ultimate truth.

“* It is one Lord janardana alone that assumes different names as Brahma,
Vishnu , shiva and so on, depending on the functions of srishti, sthiti or
samhara – creation, sustenanance and resolution” (vi. Pu. 1.2.64)//*
