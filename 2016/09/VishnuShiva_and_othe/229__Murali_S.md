Dear Learned members,
Please ignore the previous post by this mandha buddhi.I went through the
Siva,Vishnu thread and was able to glean some wisdom from our learned
members posts.Learned members have given so many perspectives that i am
dumbfounded.

I pray to Lord Ganapathi to remove my vigna-s,to give me sadbuddhi so i
atleast dont make a fool of myself in company of pandita-s.
