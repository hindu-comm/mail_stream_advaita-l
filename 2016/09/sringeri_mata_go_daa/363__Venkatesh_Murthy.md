Someone here can help him to procure Kannada translation of
Bhartruhari Vairagya Shatakam. It is a very fine Kavya.

There is one book by Ramakrishna Ashrama for only 19 rupees but I have
not seen it.

But I also think we have to read all three Shatakams. Neeti Shataka is
very good and Srungara Shatakam is for Gruhasthas and Lovers wanting
to enjoy Srungara Rasa.
