Namaste
Before we discard GaNesha and/or vinayaka we need to negotiate and understand the derivation of term vinaayaka. In the first place GaNesha is ayonijaka.
GaNesha is vinaayaka as per vaaman puraaNa

In 2011, I wrote a book (GaNesha 360 : The Science of Smart Living) on the this very subject of vinaayaka and their significance to our lives in all aspects, personal, spiritual, social as well as national levels. I had given several talk in US, Canada and India. Our Moderator Dr. Vidyashankar had attend my talk in New Jersey.

Please contact me, if any one is really understanding this vighnakartaa Model as suggested by Sage Vyasa, first they will need to read my book. Interestingly, this concept is utilized by the western world, especially NASA, The FDA, Pharma Industry, Computer Industry. Only folks who are not using it are the Indians who remain attached the rituals without understand the associated utility (viniyoga).
Best regards
Dr Yadu

Dears
My view about this topic is that this Vinayaka name only has created a confusion.Ganesa  of Sri Ganesa Pancharathnam has nothing to with the Vinayakas 4 /6 of manavagruhya sutra.Vinayaka means a chief for whom there is no chief to obey.One of the names of Sri Ganesa is Vinayaka.That is all.Sri Ganesa Pancha rathnam also contains this as namamitham Vinayakam.It is just an attributive name.InTamil we say karana peyar.
Sometimes these qualities indicative names are used as main names too to avoid repetition .
