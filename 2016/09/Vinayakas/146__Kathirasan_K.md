Namaste Subramanianji,

I want to assure you that I did not present this evidence to support the
theory that only one deity has to be propitiated for moksha. I am in your
camp with regard to this matter.

But it is worth exploring the plurality of Vinayaka(s) so that we can
better appreciate Shankara's perspective of the vinayakas in Gita 9.25.

To add on to your observation, Mitakshara in his commentary names 6
vinayakas. So perhaps Shankara is referring to an earlier conception
Vinayakas quite different from the form that gave a world miracle on the
21st of Sep 1995.
