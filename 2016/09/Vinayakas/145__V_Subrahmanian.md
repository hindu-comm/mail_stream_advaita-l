In this verse:

ādityasya sadā pūjāṃ tilakaṃ svāminas tathā /
mahāgaṇapateś caiva kurvan siddhim avāpnuyāt // Yj_1.294 //

the word 'siddhi' is explained by the Mitākṣara gloss as inclusive of Mokṣa
too.  In another chapter even pitṛ propitiation is said to result in mokṣa.

Thus, the worship of the deities mentioned above (tilakaswami is
Subrahmanya) can result in moksha.  The scriptures do not impose that one
deity alone like Vishnu is to be propitiated for moksha or he alone can
'give' moksha. Shankara in the Br.up. bhashya and elsewhere too says that
one should never be negligent in propitiating gods, etc. who bless the
aspirant with all that is required for self-realization.
