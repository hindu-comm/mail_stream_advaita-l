Subject: Re: [Advaita-l] Vinayaka(s)

Namaste Bhaskarji,

The Manavagrhyasutra states the names of the four Vinayakas: athāto vināyakānvayākhyāsyāmaḥ. śālakaṭaṅkaṭaśca kūṣmāṇḍarājaputraścosmitaśca devayajanaśceti. (2.14.1-2)

which are śālakaṭaṅkaṭa, kūṣmāṇḍarājaputra, usmita and devayajana.

Those of you who are familiar with Sanskrit can find full text here: http://gretil.sub.uni goettingen.de/gretil/1_sanskr/1_veda/5_vedang/2_grhya/manavgsu.htm<http://goettingen.de/gretil/1_sanskr/1_veda/5_vedang/2_grhya/manavgsu.htm> (look at 2.14 onwards for the section on Vinayakas and the effects they create)

The Yajnavalkya Smrti states 6 Vinayakas: mita, sammita, śāla, kaṭaṅkaṭa, kūśmāṇḍa and rājaputra (1.285). It also states that the Brahma and Rudra appointed the Vinayaka to be the remover of obstacles (1.271). Look at the effects of Vinayakas curse in verses 1.272 - 276. However, this text eventually relates that Mahaganapati needs to be worshipped daily along with Aditya to overcome the obstacles.  The Yajnavalkya Smrti is available here: http://gretil.sub.uni-goettingen.de/gretil/1_sanskr/6_sastra/4_dharma/smrti/yajn2_pu.htm
