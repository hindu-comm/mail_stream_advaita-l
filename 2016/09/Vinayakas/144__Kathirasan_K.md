Namaste Bhaskarji,

The Manavagrhyasutra states the names of the four Vinayakas: athāto
vināyakānvayākhyāsyāmaḥ. śālakaṭaṅkaṭaśca kūṣmāṇḍarājaputraścosmitaśca
devayajanaśceti. (2.14.1-2)

which are śālakaṭaṅkaṭa, kūṣmāṇḍarājaputra, usmita and devayajana.

Those of you who are familiar with Sanskrit can find full text here:
http://gretil.sub.uni
goettingen.de/gretil/1_sanskr/1_veda/5_vedang/2_grhya/manavgsu.htm (look at
2.14 onwards for the section on Vinayakas and the effects they create)

The Yajnavalkya Smrti states 6 Vinayakas: mita, sammita, śāla, kaṭaṅkaṭa,
kūśmāṇḍa and rājaputra (1.285). It also states that the Brahma and Rudra
appointed the Vinayaka to be the remover of obstacles (1.271). Look at the
effects of Vinayakas curse in verses 1.272 - 276. However, this text
eventually relates that Mahaganapati needs to be worshipped daily along
with Aditya to overcome the obstacles.  The Yajnavalkya Smrti is available
