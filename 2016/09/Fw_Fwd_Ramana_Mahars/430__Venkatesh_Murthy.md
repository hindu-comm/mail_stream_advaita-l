Namaste Sri Sujal Mahodaya

The below explanation of Raghav Kumar Mahodaya is best explanation to
show Sandhyavandana is enough to give anyone Advaita Realization. Asau
Adityo Brahma and Brahmaivasmi are there. Meditating with Gayatri
Mantra is best because it has OM, it has Vyahrutis and the powerful
Savitr Mantra. What more do you want? Why run after some other
meditation?

Remember Sayana Bhashya is saying this about Sandhyavandana -

सायणभाष्यम् -

वेदनं प्रशंसति -
ब्रह्मैव सन्ब्रह्माप्येति य एवं वेद इति ।

यः पुमानादित्यो ब्रह्मेति वेद स पुमान्पूर्वमजानानोऽपि स्वय्ं वस्तुतः
ब्रह्मैव सन् प्राप्तवेदनात् अज्ञानापगमे सति स्वानुभवेनापि ब्रह्म
आप्नोति ।

'He who knows this Sun as Brahman is himself Brahman and attains
Brahman with his own
experience and with Ignorance destroyed even though he did not earlier
know this.'

Having got a Brahmin's life it is the best method to reach Brahman. I
heard from a very learned Vedic Pundit if we say the Gayatri once
perfectly it will give us Moksha. That is enough.
