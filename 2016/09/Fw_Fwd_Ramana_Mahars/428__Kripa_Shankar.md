Namaste Sujal

‎I had to quote from Wikipedia because there is no Ramana in any classical
texts nor does he belong to any lineage. We have to only believe what they
tell us. So Wikipedia is the pramana here :D ‎

Namaste Sri Kripa ji,

To understand Sri Ramana Maharshi, please read

1. biography
2. His teachings - Who Am I
3. Sat darshan chalisi (40 verses on Reality)
4. Sri Ramana Gita
5. His recommendations were Ribhu Gita and other similar texts like Yoga
Vasistha
6. Read his teachings i.e. Q and A published by various authors.

As I have said, please do not build your judgement from wikipedia :)

OM
Sujal
