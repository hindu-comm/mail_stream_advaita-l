Apara Brahman is attained through pranava upAsana while para Brahman is attained through pranava jignAsa or vichAra.

Yes that is right upAsana of OmkAra like vishvarUpa upAsana, AhaMgrahOpAsana, vibhUti upAsana would lead to apara brahman or brahma lOka only since these are all katru tantra dhyAna.  Since these are all 'bhAvana vishesha' dhyAna needs to be done by concentrating on bhru madhyaM, hrudaya, nAbhi etc.  More details can be found in shankara bhAshya on geeta on 8th chapter and prashnOpanishat as well.  And again yes, by doing the jignAsa on praNava svarUpa parabrahman on can attain the ultimate knowledge of brahman as well.. upAsana is katru tantra whereas jignAsa has to be done based on vastu taNtra.  

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
