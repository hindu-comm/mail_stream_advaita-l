I agree with both Sri Chandramouliji and Sri Bhaskarji.

Essentially YamadharmarAja is prescribing OmkAra upAsana for those
adhikAris that do not feel that they are ready for jnAna sAdhana. Therefore
he says if you are not ready, please do OmkAra upAsana and you will go to
Brahma loka where you will get jnAna.

Shankara's bhashya to 1.2.18 confirms this: अन्यत्र धर्मादित्यादिना
पृष्टस्यात्मनोऽशेषविशेषरहितस्यालम्बनत्वेन प्रतीकत्वेन चोंकारो निर्दिष्टः
अपरस्य च ब्रह्मणो मन्दमध्यमप्रतिपत्तॄन्प्रति । अथेदानीं
तस्योंकारालम्बनस्यात्मनः साक्षात्स्वरूपनिर्दिधारयिषयेदमुच्यते
Translation - The letter Om was discussed as a prop (Alambanam) and a
substitute (pratIka) for Atma. The Atma, which was the object of the
question (of Nachiketas) that began with the verse "Anyatra dharmAt" and
which is devoid of all attributes. This was done for the purpose of helping
 men of weaker and middling intellects who wish to attain the apara
Brahman. Now this text commences for the purposes of directly ascertaining
the real nature of Atma to attain which the prop Om was mentioned
previously .


The relative merits of krama mukti and sadyo mukti are indirectly
considered later on in Katha Upanishad itself. In 2.3.5 of the same
upanishad, Yama says that the quality of knowledge produced in Brahma loka
is clear like the manushya loka (unlike the gandharva loka and pitr loka,
where brahma jnAna can occur too, but the quality of the jnAna is quite
unclear). However, Shankaracharya adds a caveat to this. He says - स च
दुष्प्रापः, अत्यन्तविशिष्टकर्मज्ञानसाध्यत्वात् । तस्मादात्मदर्शनाय इहैव
यत्नः कर्तव्य इत्यभिप्रायः - Translation- (while the quality of knowledge
in Brahma loka is very clear) it is very difficult to attain Brahma loka,
as it is only attained by the performance of a highly specialised set of
karma and upAsana. Therefore, please do not postpone the effort for Atma
darshana (that is jnAna), and try to get it  here itself.

Regards,
Venkatraghavan
