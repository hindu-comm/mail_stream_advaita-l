Just came to mind, it would be interesting to know what shankara says on TU mantra 'Om ityekAksharaM brahma' when brahman is yatO vAcho nivartante aprApya manasa saha..Unfortunately I donâ€™t remember anything about shankara bhAshya with regard to this in T. Up. mantra.   Age really matters some time :-)

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
