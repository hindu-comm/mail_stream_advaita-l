Translation given by Arya Samajis-
None being eldest, none among them youngest, as brothers humans have grown
to happy fortune. There is no discrimination among Brahmins Kshatriyas,
Vaishyas and Shudras. All are equal. ( How does this add up here? I
couldn't find any kind of words here, which are actually related to
Varnashrama dharma.)
May their father Rudra who destroys evil, young and performer of good deeds
(They don't accept Sakara Ishvara. Well this is actually funny, because
they consider qualified god as Nirakara  ), like ray of light mother nature
is pouring down happiness. May she bring us prosperous days.

Translation provided by Ralph T.H Griffith (Influenced by Acharya Sayana)-

None being eldest, none among them youngest, as brothers they have grown to
happy fortune.
May their Sire Rudra, young and deft, and Pṛśni pouring much milk, bring
fair days to the Maruts.

Arya Samajis are actually altering the meaning of the mantras. Their
publicity of vedartha is totally against the traditional teachings.
