Dear Scholars,

I am looking for the book Guru-Vijaya or Acharya-vijaya by Anantaanandagiri, published as the  Philosophical series, No. 16, 1971, by the Madras University.
There seems to be another copy published in 1968  by  the Baptist Mission Press, Calcutta. I shall be grateful if any member can give any information as to how to get a copy of the same, preferably in the pdf version. Some claim that this is about the Abhinava Shankara and not about Adi Shankara. '

Looking forward to hearing from you and with thanks in advance,
Sunil KB
