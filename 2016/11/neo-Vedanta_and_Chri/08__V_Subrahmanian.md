In the Vol.1 of 'Sridakṣiṇāmūrti stotram' published by the Sringeri
Peetham, (now on a second print)  is this section on p.650:

//6.13.7: Christianity:

In Christianity, the Ten Commandments, the beatitudes, and the statements
of Jesus the Christ such as 'He who has seen Me has seen the Father', 'I
and My Father are one', 'I am the way, the Truth and the Life', 'I am the
Light of the world' etc. are reminiscent of the implied advaitic
undercurrent. //

The other sections in this chapter are 'Sufism', Buddhism, Jainism,
Chārvākamata, Modern Physics, etc.

Jagadguru Sri Chandrashekhara Bharati Swaminah: 'The ultimate purpose of
all religious and spiritual practices is to make the mind still.'

Ramakrishna Paramahamsa: In the quiet mind God speaks.
