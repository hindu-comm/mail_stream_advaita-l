Namaste

This topic is quite confusing because Rajiv Malhotra is partly right but he seems to be defending all the wrong people.

Apparently Paul Hacker was the first to coin the term Neo Hinduism. This is because he observed that 'contemporary Hinduism' deviated from the traditional one. He is absolutely right about this although I am not aware of his intentions. But this part is a fact. For eg, who in their right mind would consider the womaniser Gandhi, the father of Pakistan, to be a 'Mahatma'? He gives more examples like Aurobindo, Radhakrishnan (who ranks experience ‎more than Shruti) .

I am not sure why Rajiv is out to defend these types. But he is right in his assessment that concepts like Karma and reincarnation are indigestible for certain gurus/organisations who in time will do a 'U turn'.

let me offer some thing for your consideration: 

What is the key word nay, philosophy of Nisargadatta Maharaj?- * I am that *
‎What about Ramana Maharshi? - * Summa iru (Tamil for Be Still) *

Exodus 3.14 (Bible) - And god said unto Moses, I am that I am.
Maharshi's gospel - I am that I am sums up the whole truth.
Psalm 46:10 (Bible) - Be still and know that I am god.

Be still, I am, I am that are all attributed to Bible, not by me but by Maharshi and Maharaj themselves :)

Subject: [Advaita-l] neo-Vedanta and Christianity

Dear folks,

There are some naysayers in Western Academia who opine that Neo-Vedanta was
Vedanta incorporated with Western (read Christian) ideas (for example
Halbfass). I for one know that certain Indian authors like Rajiv Malhotra
tries to disprove this thesis in some of his books like Indra's Net etc.

Does the good folks in this list know of any scholars/authors (Indians or
otherwise) who take a similar opinion?

Regards,
Vineet Menon
