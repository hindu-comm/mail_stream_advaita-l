Right you are. On a related note... Poonja Maharaj is quoted in his
biography as saying that he was sitting with Gandhiji and heard a
continuous chanting "Rama, Rama... ". On examining he found that although
Gandhiji himself was in silence, he could hear the chanting from Gandhiji's
body! Now, people who trust Poonja Maharaj may take this to be true or
those who don't, may take to two options: either leave it alone as
arthavAda or accuse even him of something, like Gandhiji.

And thanks for quoting Sringeri publication and HH Sringeri Shankaracharya
earlier where Christianity and other religions were quoted/ mentioned.
Unfortunately, the context and the purpose of sections of teaching is lost
on some. Every teaching is with an audience in mind and that includes
Ramana Maharshi's address. To his western followers, many of whom barely
knew anything of Hinduism, he surely couldn't have quoted Sanskrit
Upanishad passages.

Kind rgds,
