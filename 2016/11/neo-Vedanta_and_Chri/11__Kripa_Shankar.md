‎I guess you are right. I could have criticised without ridiculing anyone. Moreover, it may not suit well on a forum like this. Even the esteemed scholars like Shankara, Mandana, MadhusUdana Saraswathi etc have used ridicule in their arguments. Perhaps I am over-doing it or perhaps it is pointless. So I'll stop.

Kripa ‎

My only alleged allegation was calling Gandhi a womaniser and father of Pakistan, which is a simple fact.

Dear Sri Kripa Shankar ji,

You may have your own views about Gandhi but to air them here in this forum is not in good taste. The same holds with your views about Ramana Maharshi and other gurus who are respected by Advaitins. You may carry on any amount of tirade against these persons in your personal blog but please spare this forum from such expressions.

I have clearly mentioned that all these verses (and their supposed similarity with Advaita) were quoted‎ by the media-acclaimed sages like Ramana Maharshi and Nisargadatta Maharaj. I agree with you that these verses are taken out of context. But this criticism should be appropriated rightly to the above mentioned 'sages'. If you are not convinced, you should read the popular book written by Ramana's very own disciple, an international yogi, paramahamsa yogananda.

All said and done, I have realised that I should not be critical towards these gurus because we deserve them. Like they (don't know who) say ‎- we only get what we deserve.

Kripa ‎

Dear Kripa ji,

With due respect your reply sounds more like a political statement with all sorts of allegation of impropriety. I agree that Radhakrishnan gave more weight-age to *anubhava* while Sankara didn't considered *anubhava* at all in his three *pramanas* (Arvind Sharma argues the contrary in this paper, https://www.jstor.org/stable/1399276?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents, http://www.unipune.ac.in/snc/cssh/ipq/english/IPQ/21-25%20volumes/24%2001/PDF/24-1-1.pdf).

Also, you quoted certain verses from Bible without their contexts. I cannot imagine for the life of me how you can say that Christianity (where divinity and man are separated by a great chasm) and Advaita (where jivatma and paramatma are one and the same).

Regards,

Vineet Menon

This topic is quite confusing because Rajiv Malhotra is partly right but he seems to be defending all the wrong people.

Apparently Paul Hacker was the first to coin the term Neo Hinduism. This is because he observed that 'contemporary Hinduism' deviated from the traditional one. He is absolutely right about this although I am not aware of his intentions. But this part is a fact. For eg, who in their right mind would consider the womaniser Gandhi, the father of Pakistan, to be a 'Mahatma'? He gives more examples like Aurobindo, Radhakrishnan (who ranks experience ‎more than Shruti) .

I am not sure why Rajiv is out to defend these types. But he is right in his assessment that concepts like Karma and reincarnation are indigestible for certain gurus/organisations who in time will do a 'U turn'.

let me offer some thing for your consideration: 

What is the key word nay, philosophy of Nisargadatta Maharaj?- * I am that *
‎What about Ramana Maharshi? - * Summa iru (Tamil for Be Still) *

Exodus 3.14 (Bible) - And god said unto Moses, I am that I am.
Maharshi's gospel - I am that I am sums up the whole truth.
Psalm 46:10 (Bible) - Be still and know that I am god.

Be still, I am, I am that are all attributed to Bible, not by me but by Maharshi and Maharaj themselves :)

Regards
Kripa ‎

Dear folks,

There are some naysayers in Western Academia who opine that Neo-Vedanta was
Vedanta incorporated with Western (read Christian) ideas (for example
Halbfass). I for one know that certain Indian authors like Rajiv Malhotra
tries to disprove this thesis in some of his books like Indra's Net etc.

Does the good folks in this list know of any scholars/authors (Indians or
otherwise) who take a similar opinion?

Regards,
Vineet Menon
