Well let's start with some proper definitions.  What is Neo-Vedanta? 
What makes it "neo"?  For example I am writing in English but I don't 
think the Vedantic concepts I explain and the way I explain them are 
particularly neo.  But undoubtedly there are people who I would call 
"Neo-Vedantins" for whom "incorporating Christian ideas" would be an 
accurate description.

So we need to make sure we are discussing the same concepts/people if we 
are to have a fruitful discussion.
