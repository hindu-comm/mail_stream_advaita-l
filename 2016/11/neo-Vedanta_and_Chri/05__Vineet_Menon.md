Dear folks,

There are some naysayers in Western Academia who opine that Neo-Vedanta was
Vedanta incorporated with Western (read Christian) ideas (for example
Halbfass). I for one know that certain Indian authors like Rajiv Malhotra
tries to disprove this thesis in some of his books like Indra's Net etc.

Does the good folks in this list know of any scholars/authors (Indians or
otherwise) who take a similar opinion?

Regards,
Vineet Menon
