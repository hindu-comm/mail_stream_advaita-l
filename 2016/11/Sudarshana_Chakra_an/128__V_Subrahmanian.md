// As a way of conveying the message that both ‘Hari’ and ‘Siva’ are the
same, pujas are performed to ‘Sudarshana Chakra’ with ‘Vibhuti’, which is
distributed as ‘prasadam’ to devotees at the temple in the evenings.//

In this temple dedicated to Viṣṇu in the form of Sri Sundararaja Perumāḷ,
everyday, in the evenings, the Sudarśana Chakra is placed in Bhasma
(vibhūti) and several hymns are chanted: Viṣṇusahasra nāma, Lakṣṁī stotram,
Kubera, Dhanvantari and Sudarśana - and the vibhūti is distributed to
devotees as prasādam. People believe that this vibhūti is a panacea to
diseases. The Vibhūti prasada is given out by the Temple in deference to
the conviction that Hari and Hara are non-different.
