I think of it this way.  It's not so much about how comprehensive it is 
but the focus.  A prakarana is aimed inwards at people who already accept 
the principles of Advaita Vedanta but just have questions about one aspect 
or another.  Whereas bhashyas present the subject matter to a possibly 
uninformed or even hostile audience with polemics and apologetics along 
with exposition.
