Hi all,

Can somebody shed some light on the Visishtadvaiti Vedanta Desikan's work
Shatadushani, claiming to logically reject Advaitam?

What were the chief reasons to reject Advaitam? More interestingly, can you
also then shed light on a work titled Shatabhushani rejecting the claims of
Shatadushani? Besides the joke that "Shata"dushani has only 66 claims
against Advaitam, I'd like to know what those 66 arguments were and how
they were rejected.

Regards,
Sriram
