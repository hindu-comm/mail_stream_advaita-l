Dear Sri Sadanandaji,

Pranams, 

I have read in Sri Raa Ganapathi's work (a Tamil journalist, who enjoyed the patronage of Sri Kanchi Shankaracharya, Sri Chandrashekarendra Saraswathi that one Sri Anantha Krishna Sastriji wrote a book refuting all the arguments in the Shatha Dhooshani and had not decided on the title of the book. Sri Chandrashekarendra Saraswathi Mahaswamiji directed him to get a Srimukham from Sri abhinava Vidya Theertha Mahaswamigal. Sri Sastrriji did as directed and came back to Sri  Sri Chandrashekarendra Saraswathi Mahaswamiji  and asked him for his Sri Mukham. Sri Chandrashekarendra Saraswathi Mahaswamiji  told him that Sri Abhinava Vidya Theertha Mahaswami was also a great  logician apart from being a great yogi and that Sri Mukham from him should be enough and that should be treated as his Sri Mukham also.

Further, regarding the book's title. there is a funny and interesting , story. The Sastri hailed from a place called "Noorani' in Tamil Nadu, which means 'hundred ornaments'. Sri Chandrashekarendra Saraswathi Mahaswamiji  told him to keep this as the title of the book., instead of 'Shatha Dhooshani dhooshani or some thing like that.' So, the title of the book was kept as Shatha Bhooshani. But I  do not know whether the Kanchi Matham published that book or some other organization published it. Regards, Ramesh Ramanan.

 PraNAms
 There is book by Sreeman S.M.S Chari on
 Adviata-Vishishtaadvaita -where he discussed the objections
 by Vedanta Deshika - There are actually some 60+ objections
 mostly based on Navya Nyaaya. One can get this book on line.


 Shreeman Chari maaama is
 no more, but he used to tell me that these objections have
 never been answered. In the Shatabhuusani Shree
 Krishnasastri only reiterated the advaita position than take
 up each objection item by item.
 I have
 looked into these objections mostly based on vikalpas with
 hair-splitting arguments but no substance worth considering
 or debating. Some are extensions of Bhagavan Ramanuja's
 arguments in his Shree Bhasya. I am grateful to Chari maama
 who stayed with me and taught me the introductory part of
 the Shree Bhashya where most of the purvapakshas and
 siddhantas have been discussed.

  Subject: [Advaita-l] Shatadushani and
 Shatabhushani
 
 Hi all,

 Can
 somebody shed some light on the Visishtadvaiti Vedanta
 Desikan's work
 Shatadushani, claiming to
 logically reject Advaitam?

 What were the chief reasons to reject Advaitam?
 More interestingly, can you
 also then shed
 light on a work titled Shatabhushani rejecting the claims
 of
 Shatadushani? Besides the joke that
 "Shata"dushani has only 66 claims
 against Advaitam, I'd like to know what
 those 66 arguments were and how
 they were
 rejected.

 Regards,
 Sriram
