Mike Roper
----------

I have been a 'student' of Advaita for more than 40 years - I am always amazed 
at how much there is still to understand in this most subtle and enigmatic of 
'philosophies' !!! I am a physicist / applied mathematician and am 
particularly interested in using Advaita to understand the 'philosophical' 
concepts possibly behind quantum mechanics. Also to 'use' modern physics etc. 
to formulate a possibly 'clearer' understanding of Advaita. Since 'Reality' IS 
Non-Dual, it must be possible to start at either end of Brahman/Maya or pure 
consciousness/the world - there is only consciousness. Unpicking all this will 
take much effort and imagination - but surely imagination is a mark OF 
consciousness !! All the best in Dharma


Sandhya
-------

I'm very new to the Advaita Vedanta but am very interested in knowing about
it. I just know few things about Advaita.
