> Apparently there are two renderings for the Chandogya bhashya, one ending

> अनिति प्राणिति चेष्टत इति. Thus the bhashya would read either as तथा
> तस्मिन्नेव स्थितिकाले, अनिति प्राणिति चेष्टत इति तदन् or as तथा तस्मिन्नेव
> स्थितिकाले, अनिति प्राणिति चेष्टत इति तदनम्. In some prints both these

> Sri SSS mentions this in his translation of the bhashya into kannada and
> states that he has preferred the word तदनम् as it then renders the
> meaning in the Chandogya Bhashya more in line with BSB 1-2-1. He also
> mentions that the word तदन् in the shruti is छान्दस प्रयोग.
