praNAms Sri Subbu prabhuji
Hare Krishna

Thanks for the explanation prabhuji.

For  bhasma dhAraNa (tripundra, Urdhva pundra etc. in smArta saMpradAya), mudrAdhAraNa ( in mAdhva saMpradAya) tilaka/nAma dhAraNa (tengalai, vadagali etc. in Sri VaishNava saMpradAya) do we have any reference in our veda/vedAnta??  I read somewhere that ( in Hindu dharma of kAnchi paramAchArya ?? not sure) during the earlier times there exists only bhasma dhAraNa vidhi and nAma and mudrAdhAraNa are recent developments.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar

What is this about?? Please tell me about the miracle that took place in tirupati as I am not able to see this in YT.

Dear Bhaskar ji,

There appeared a strange cloud formation in the form of tripundra with the full moon (the following day was Gurupurnima) positioned on the centre of that cloud (three parallel lines).  Devotees who witnessed this phenomenon were amazed and felt it was a divine blessing on the eve of Gurupurnima. The TV channel that reported this added lot of masala to the event by repeatedly superimposing the tripundra on Lord Venkateswara's forehead. And played 'Govinda Govinda' chants in  the background. The narrative also mentioned that Shiva is stated to be the KshetrapƒÅla of Tirupati according to purana-s, thereby making the Shiva-connection even more emphatic.

Someone had shared this clip on WhatsApp.

regards
subbu

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
