If I may add more questions...

1) How do i go about identifying my varna?
2) Does my varna change with time as it is a function of Sattva,  Rajas and
Tamas.
3) How does knowing my varna help,  given the type of job opportunities and
extracurricular options that prevail in the society today?

Regards
Lakshman Velayutham
