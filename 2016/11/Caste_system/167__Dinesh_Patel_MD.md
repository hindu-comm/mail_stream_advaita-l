My educationists
A few of my American friends are asking about caste system as mentioned in Gita
Why lord Krishna did this or did he at all
Why are they treated as they are
Some western journalist in ny times a few weeks back wrote what looked to be a bias uninformed view point but no one has responded back
Dalits are badly treated by Govt - and society
I am proposing the topic
 Genesis of caste system
in India -- a Sanatan Dharma civilization
 Why
Pros and cons 
Compare such caste systems if any in other religions 
May be I am side tracking
If so disregard
IAM of course enjoying the information
