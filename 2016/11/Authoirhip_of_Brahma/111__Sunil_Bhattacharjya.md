Dear friends,

Many of us, if not all of us, know  that the Brahmasutra (BS) was composed by Badarayana Vyasa  and not by Krishnadvaipayana Vyasa or Vedavyasa. Has any work been done on the authorship of the first BS-bahhya, though it is generally attributed to  Adi Shankara? I mean, has anybody looked for internal evidences to establish that it was surely by Adi Shankara, or it could be by any other Shakara such as Abhinavashankara or Vidyashankara or Kripashankara, whom some consider to  be an avatara of Adi Shankara. 

Regards,
Sunil KB
