Just like the elephant and the wood with which it is made, are not different, the world and paramAtma are not different. To a child, the wood is not seen, only the elephant is. To an adult however, the wood that makes the elephant is visible. Similarly, to an ajnAni, the world hides the paramAtma. However, to the jnAni, all that is seen is paramAtma. सर्वं खल्विदं ब्रह्म.

Just for records, those who want to say ‘jagat’ satya, would say so keeping the above view point in mind.  The jnAni would not see any ‘mithyA’ (from the wood point of view elephant as ‘wood’ satya only)  he would see ‘satya’ and ONLY satya which is paramAtma.  Not for any fresh debates on jagat satyatva or mithyatva, just remembered the above after reading above Tamil translation.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
