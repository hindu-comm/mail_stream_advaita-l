Namaste.
In the Panchayatana Puja published in the book Nityahnikam by R S Vadhyar & Sons, there is a shloka on Paramesvara as follows :

नमः शिवाय साम्बाय सगणाय ससूनवे | 
सनन्दिने सगङ्गाय सवृषाय नमो नमः ||

Can someone explain the occurrence of two references to 'with Nandi', first as सनन्दिने and again as सवृषाय.  Or does one of these words describe another attribute of the Lord, and if so which word and what does it signify.

Thanks in advance.

Warm Regards
Venkateswaran N E
