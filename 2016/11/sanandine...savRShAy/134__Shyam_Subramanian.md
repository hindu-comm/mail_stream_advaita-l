Namaste,

I have read that nandi(n) was earlier considered a prime gaNa/attendant and
not the vAhana of Siva, which is the vRshabha and that both have been
equated in 'later' literature.

Ref : https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2008/02/27/nandin/ (I have not
personally verified the sources mentioned here).

dhanyosmi,
Shyam/श्यामः
