Namaste,


This is in relation to this article and similar other articles 
we have seen on this form recently. Since the topic here is 
related to mother godess, I thought of offering a clarification.
It is not my intention to stretch this discussion into a debate.

The Adi mAtA that is described in durgA saptashati is NOT
pArvati, lakshmi or sarasvati. She is NOT the spouse of
shiva, vishnu or brahma. She is their mother - this is very
clearly described in rahasya traya whose translation has been
shared by shri Jaldhar on this list.
