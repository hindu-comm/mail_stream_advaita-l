Namaste Sri Chandramouliji,

The reason the presence of turIya is not highlighted in the email is
because that is not the focus of what is being discussed - which is whether
an objective assessment of reality of the world can be made when being a
part of the world. Despite being present, turIya is not part of the world -
mANDUkya says he is prapanchopashamam.

We cannot take either the waker's assessment or the dreamer's assessment
of reality as truth, because each of them associate themselves with the
instruments of experience, which are very much part of the world that they
are assessing.

On the other hand the veda has an extraordinary vision of the world, which
is not vitiated by this particular limitation. Therefore, the veda gives us
an objective presentation of reality from the standpoint of turIya which we
should try to understand.

Regards,

Venkatraghavan
