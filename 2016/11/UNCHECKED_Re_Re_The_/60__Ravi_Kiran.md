Even though prAjnan being sarvesvaraḥ, sarvajna, sarvontaryAmi, sarvasya
yonih, prajnAna ghana...
yet, prAjnan is limited to sushupti avastha, as  there is no experience of
world in sushupti (ekibhutah), neither assessing
of waker's or dreamer's world from prAjnan, though it is considered as the
origin (or doorway leading to) for visva and taijasa (sarvasya yonih,
cetomukha)..
