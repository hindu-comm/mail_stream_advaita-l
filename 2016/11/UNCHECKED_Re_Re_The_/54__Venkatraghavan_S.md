Namaste Sri Sadaji,

Perhaps this alternate link may help:
http://www.mediafire.com/file/19n8s51s32mjua4/Five_pUrva_pakshis_of_vaitathya_prakaraNa.pdf

If this also doesn't work, I will mail you the pdf in a personal email
separately. I shared a link because, from memory, I believe file
attachments are not allowed by the list server.

Regards,
Venkatraghavan
