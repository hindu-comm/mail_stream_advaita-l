Here is one more dimension to this discussion:

In the Bṛ.Up.Bh <http://xn--nig.up.bh>āṣya vārtika, Sureshwaracharya cites
a purāṇic verse, that is cited by Shankara at the beginning of his
introduction to the Bh.Gita bhāṣya:

नारायणः परोऽव्यक्तात् अण्डमव्यक्तसंभवम् ।
अण्डस्यान्तस्त्विमे लोकाः सप्तद्वीपा च मेदिनी ॥

[Narayana is beyond avyatka, the Great Egg is born of the avyakta (maya),
within the Egg exists the entire cosmos consisting of these worlds..]

Anandagiri, raises a question: How does Narayana become the cause of
creation? And answers: through ajnāna.

That shows that ajnāna has to be admitted even at the level of Narayana
(Nirguna Brahman), the Cause.  This is reminiscent of the Br.Up.1.4.10
bhāṣya where Shankara admits ignorance to Brahman. So, whether it is for
the Cause-Brahman or for the jīva-Brahman, the attribution of ajnāna is
inevitable. To put it simply, since as per Advaita, the entire world, along
with the jiva-s, is a vivarta of Brahman, ajnāna (also can be termed māyā)
is at the root of everything: creation of the bhogya prapancha, the bhoktā,
and the bhoga. Here it is clear that it is enough to admit just one
Ignorance, called by whatever name, to account for the entire creation and
all that consists in it, including the bandha-mokṣa vyavahara of jīva-s.
And it is quite patent from Anandagiri's comment that such an ignorance is
at the level of Nirguna Brahman itself. Of course, that ignorance is itself
unreal goes without saying. It is only an admitting, abhyupetya, in the
Śāstra to account for the world. When the need for such accounting is
outgrown, there is no ignorance, no cause, no world and no jiva-s.
