Pranams Sri Sadananda Ji,



Thanks for your clarification. Perhaps mistake is mine.  I took it for
granted that  you were elaborating on advaita sidhanta in accordance with
the bhashya of Sri Bhagavatpada.  Now that you have clarified that you are
trying to simplify the sidhanta independent of the bhashya, I have no
commens to offer.



I do wish you all the best in your endeavour.






Regards
