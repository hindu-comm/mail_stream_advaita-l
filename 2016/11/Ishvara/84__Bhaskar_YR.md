doesn't Advaita accept both paramArtha and vyavahArika standpoints ?

>   Yes, but the question is, does the vyAvahArika satya has an independent existence apart from pAramArthika satya??

Where do you find such references of having independent existence in Advaitic texts ?


I don’t think so because pAramArthika satya ‘is_not’ an avasthAteeta vyavahAra abhAva satya.  In that sense what is our stand point with regard to Ishwara??  Just seeing Ishwara in vyavahAra realizing that he is ‘mithya’ like jagat ??  Those jnAni-s who have interacted with HIM even after jnana like madhusUdana etc. though that Ishwara  with whom they have interacted is ‘kevala mithyA’!!??

Why is there an effort to mix-up paramArtha and vyavahAra ?
Is there a contention in below topic, from Advaitic view?

>   Do you think that ‘Ishwara’s existence in Advaita out of contention??

The very mix-up is the contention ..
Hari Bol!
Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
