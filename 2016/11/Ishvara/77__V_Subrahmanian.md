Dialogue with acharya. ( Jagadguru Sri Abhinava Vidyatirtha Swamiji of
Sringeri)  l4 "ISHWARA"

D: Some people get a doubt as to whether Īśvara really exists or
not. This is because they are unable to see Him. Cannot
Īśvara, by some Dialogue with acharyal "ISHWARA"

D: Some people get a doubt as to whether Īśvara really exists or
not. This is because they are unable to see Him. Cannot
Īśvara, by some means, reveal to them His existence so as to
induce śraddhā (faith) in them?

A: Īśvara Himself seems to have been caught in a fix. If He were
to give darśana to them, He would have to assume some
form. On seeing the form, people may say, “You have a
form. Therefore, you are not omnipresent and cannot be
Īśvara.” If He does not give them darśana by assuming a
form, they may say, “We do not see Īśvara. Hence, there is
no Īśvara.” Thus, there are some people who will not believe
in Īśvara regardless of whether He takes a form or not. In
this situation, what indeed can Īśvara do? Variety is the
nature of the world. We have the group of atheists also. Faith
in Īśvara can be induced and further developed, but there is
no use in attempting to induce it by force. Arguments could
be advanced and the true experiences of many devotees
could be cited. Many wonderful incidents that have taken
place could be narrated. What has been made known in the
śāstra-s could be quoted. Still, if one does not believe that
Īśvara exists, what can be done?

D: Can a devotee see Īśvara?

A: You mean with form?

D: Yes.

A: Īśvara, though without form, can take one for the sake of His
devotees. If we have limitless devotion, we can definitely see
Īśvara’s form. There is no doubt at all about this.

D: Does Acharyal mean that one can see Īśvara’s form mentally
or that one can perceive Him even with the eyes?

A: Īśvara is capable of giving darśana both ways.

D: Does Acharyal say that He can be seen, talked to and
touched?

A: Yes. If there is pure devotion, Īśvara is sure to reveal
Himself. When He does appear, why cannot one talk with
Him?

D: Can this happen even in this kaliyuga?

A: What link is there between a devoted person seeing Īśvara
and the kaliyuga?

D: Who can get Īśvara’s vision?

A: He who longs exclusively for Īśvara can see Him. Limitless
devotion compels Īśvara to come to us.

D: How can one know whether the experience one had in
connection with Īśvara is real or not?

A: For him, who has had a real experience, such a doubt will
not arise , reveal to them His existence so as to
induce śraddhā (faith) in them?
