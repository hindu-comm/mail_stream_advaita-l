In the Bhagavad Geetha chapter2 stanza48 this word samathvam is used in the
sense of equipoised state of the mind.Sidhya Sidhyo:nir vikara:Samathvam
yoga uchyathe says Lord Sri Krishna..Efforts are put to achieve a goal. but
if the efforts result in success do nott get elated.Nor get disillusioned
when the result is unsuccessful.Such a state of mind is called
samathvam.This is also a yoga.One should do actions without getting
attached to the results of the action.
