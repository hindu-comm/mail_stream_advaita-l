The word 'samatvam' is popular in the Bh.Gitā as e.g. in 'samatvam yoga
uchyate' where the word means 'equanimity' in the face of dualities like
heat and cold, joy and sorrow, etc.

There is another word 'samam' in BG 'samam paśyan hi sarvatra samavasthitam
'iśvaram', where the meaning is the advaitic vision of ekatva, bhinnatva
abhāva, etc.
