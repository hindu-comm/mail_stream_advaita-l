praNAms
Hare Krishna

I donot know whether the below is pUrvapaxi's stand or siddhAnta.  When prAjnA is still associated with kAraNa shareera why veda is aveda, deva is adeva etc.  there in sushupti ??  Atra veda aveda is acceptable to us even though prAjna is associated with his kAraNa shareera/ avidyA, if it is the stand of the siddhAnti ??

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar

Namaste Sri Ravi Kiran,
Because prAjna is still associated with kAraNa sharIra, and therefore part of kAraNa prapancha. Only from turIya's perspective, which is completely disassociated from all sharIras, can the judgment be made.

Regards,
Venkatraghavan
