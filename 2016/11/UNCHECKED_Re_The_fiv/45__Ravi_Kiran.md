Interesting to note that, svarUpa ajnAnam is referred to as absence of
jnAnam (avastu) in sleep, as there is absolutely no knowledge of anything
(Turiya or jIva/jagat/Ishvara), but not denying the presence of chit or sat
svarUpa (ekam eva advitIya sat vastu or Pure Consciousness/Turiyan ).

Where as, in waking, svarUpa ajnAnam is referred to as ignorance of Turiya
Atman, through there is triputi jnAna.

For duality (or any knowledge to occur) to manifest in waking/dream, there
is a need for upAdhi.

Whereas, in spite of presence of upAdhi ( kAraNa sharIra ) in sleep, there
is neither experience of duality nor any knowledge, as it is
undifferentiated. And this continues to be so (during sleep or unconscious
state), whether one has svarUpa jnAnam in waking or not, as Turiyan is not
opposed to sat svarUpa ajnAnam.  kAraNa sharIra is admitted in case of
Visvan ( who has realized Turiya) until the prarAbda unwinds completely.

Of course, all of above kArya/kAraNa discussion is not from paramArtha
standpoint.
