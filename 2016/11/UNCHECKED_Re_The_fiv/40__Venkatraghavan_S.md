Namaste Sri Bhaskar,

I think your questions all stem from questioning the concept of kAraNa
sharIra and prAjna's association with it. I don't wish to enter into that
debate. I will briefly answer your questions, though I don't want to get
into a debate on the reasons. You can safely ignore my email if you wish.

Question: What exactly is this kAraNa shareera??
A: anirvachanIya anAdi avidyA rUpam sharIradvayasya kAraNamAtram
satsvarUpAjnAnam nirvikalpakarupam yadasti tad kAraNa sharIram.

Q: If it is a sort of avidyA then prAjnA is associated with avidyA in
sushupti right prabhuji??
A: Yes.

Q: Then in this avidyA state of prAjnA, can shruti claim there veda is
aveda, deva is adeva etc.??
A: I do not see why this is incompatible with that.

Q: It has been said there in shruti like this just to denote the fact that
it is ekeebhUtaM.
A: Yes.

Q: But we are saying here prAjnA has the upAdhi here (kAraNa shareera)
hence he is not trustworthy.  Clarification: I did not say untrustworthy. I
said any objective assessment of the reality of a system cannot be done by
a participant in the system.

Q: but OTOH, shruti saying  veda is aveda because ashareeraM vAva santaM na
priyApriye sprushataH how??
A: I do not see how ashareeram vAva santam na priyApriye sprushatah applies
to prAjna. The context of the mantra is not sushupti, nor is this referring
to the status of Atma in sushupti as far I know.

Regards,
Venkatraghavan
