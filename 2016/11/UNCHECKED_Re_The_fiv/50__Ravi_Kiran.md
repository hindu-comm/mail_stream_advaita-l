If such a bhAvarUpa avidyA beeja (as some potential undifferentiated form)
is admitted, as other than sat vastu ( seems a dvaitic standpoint), in deep
sleep, then, what is the yukti behind that beeja getting destroyed
completely (as not being the cause for any further manifestation), in other
words, how the Turiya jnAna attained during waking is cause for such a
destruction of beeja aka kAraNa sharIra ( if that is the cause admitted),
remains a question ( to Visvan ) ?

A question may arise, that Visvan ( realising oneself as Turiyan) during
waking, there is no rule that such Turiya jnAna is available to Taijasan as
well, during dream state ( may or may not be available, since dream being a
anavasthA ), this being so, how it is said that this Turiya jnAna in
waking, is responsible for the ultimate destruction of bhAvarUpa avidyA
beeja (kAraNa sharIra) in sushupti ?

I would think, there will be convincing answers on this topic ..as
otherwise, such admission of beeja rUpah in kAraNa sharIra will strengthen
the Yogi's sAdhana ( sAnkhya's viewpoints) of reaching prati prasava
/viveka khyati etc
