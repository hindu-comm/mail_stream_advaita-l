May I ask you more elaboration of two terms i.e. satsvarUpAjnAnaM and nirvikalpakarUpaM prabhuji??

nirvikalpakarUpaM describes the condition of kAraNa sharIra - whenever anything is in its causal form, all its parts are undifferentiated. In a tree, we can clearly see the branch, leaf, trunk etc, whereas in the seed form, while all those parts are there in their potential form, we cannot distinctly perceive them. The entire tree is in an undifferentiated/potential form in the seed, similarly this entire world - the 2 sharIras and their respective prapanchas are in an undifferentiated, potential, form in deep sleep. This is what is referred to as ekIbhUtam in mANDUkya mantra 5.

The nature of kAraNa sharIra is described as satsvarUpa ajnAnam. kAraNa sharIra exists during sleep, or before creation / after dissolution. As we said earlier, in the kAraNa form, no differentiation is recognisable - including subject/object duality. Since there is no knower / known difference recognisable, we cannot talk about knowledge. All knowledge is possible only when there is subject-object duality. Since this duality is not manifest in kAraNa sharIra, its nature is called sat svarUpa ajnAnam, i.e. where there is no knowledge of existence of either the subject or the object. Both the subject and object are of the nature of existence, sat svarUpa, hence kAraNa sharIra is described as satsvarUpa ajnAnam.

However, just like we said that objects are not absent in kAraNa sharIra - they are merely in their unmanifest, potential, undifferentiated form - the knowledge of objects (and the subject) is also not absent, that knowledge is in a potential form too. This is the equivalent of prajAnaghanam in mANDUkya mantra 5.

And also clarify whether this kAraNa shareeraM is an upAdhi for the prAjnA in the sushupti??

To clarify, prAjna is the name of Atma when it identifies itself with the kAraNa sharIra. So kAraNa sharIra is not an upAdhi of prAjna, it is an upAdhi of Atma in sushupti.

Venkatraghavan

Q: If it is a sort of avidyA then prAjnA is associated with avidyA in sushupti right prabhuji??
A: Yes.

I believe the answer to this was provided in the previous email in the answer to the question what exactly is kAraNa sharIra.
