anirvachanIya anAdi avidyA rUpam sharIradvayasya kAraNamAtram satsvarUpAjnAnam nirvikalpakarupam yadasti tad kAraNa sharIram

Hare Krishna

May I ask you more elaboration of two terms i.e. satsvarUpAjnAnaM and nirvikalpakarUpaM prabhuji??  And also clarify whether this kAraNa shareeraM is an upAdhi for the prAjnA in the sushupti??

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!

I believe the answer to this was provided in the previous email in the answer to the question what exactly is kAraNa sharIra.
