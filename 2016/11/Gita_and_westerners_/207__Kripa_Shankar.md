Namaste Dinesh,

Glad to be of any help. This was published way back in 1883 by Pratap Chandra Roy. The book is digitised and is available freely on the internet.

Here is a link : ‎http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m01/
Be sure to read the translator's preface.
‎‎
You can also download pdf versions from various sites. ‎

Regards
Kripa

>> Since the Professor taught Sanskrit at many Universities, including BHU, maybe he was linguistic scholar, but sorry to say, thats all he was. I know English very well, but I hardly have any say over all books written in English. Being a linguistic scholar, his opinion in scriptural works, where he has no expertise, is irrelevant. This is precisely why it is said that even if a scholar, one should not study the scriptures on his own. It will appear contradictory and one could lose whatever little shraddhA one has. 
>> 
>> People may say that Bhagavan made Arjuna fight a war which Arjuna himself was unwilling to fight, especially where in the former says: "fight" in 2.18. This seems like an order to them, because they read some translation or Sanskrit grammar which may say its a vidhi. However, it is not, as Bhashyakara explains. Bhagavan is just removing the obstacle in the form wrong thinking to Arjuna's dharma as a kShatriya. Gita is a mokShashAstra and any shloka has to be understood in the context. Giving up one's dharma is not conducive to spiritual growth. The sampradAya, teaching tradition, exists for this very reason as to teach the person willing and fit to learn.
>> 
>> Moreover, what kind of dharma would there have been if Kauravas had ruled, instead of Pandus?! The war was also the greater good *in the long run*. That is why Mahabharata is called a dhArmika war and was dharmakArya for Arjuna. That said, the the Prof has it all wrong as is clear from his statement "The Gita is hampered by the fact that it is supposed to justify Arjuna's preparation in war... and the author seems to have it in the back of his head a large part of the time", which makes one wonder if the Prof read Bhagavan's final address to Arjuna in 18.63 so: "yathA ichChasi tathA kuru", since being a Sanskrit scholar, he couldn't have not understood it! :)
