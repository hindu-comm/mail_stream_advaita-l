Namaste Dinesh-ji

When a demonic force enters creation in the form of, say, Hitler, it is
nonsensical to use this argument of non-harm to remain idle whilst the
demonic force is free to implement destruction.
The Gita is not a work on morality, but rather of advaita.
Making the claim "The Gita’s morality on this point is somewhat
disappointing. It does indeed include “harmlessness” or “nonviolence” in
several of its lists of virtues. But it never singled it out for special
emphasis." illustrates that the understanding of advaita is lacking.
Is it not presumptive to tell the Supreme Incarnation of the Absolute what
He should have as His most important moral attribute?

Surely becoming free from ignorance is a higher goal than following a list
of rules on morality?
When one sees "All creatures in himself, His Self in all creatures" the
correct course of action is known in any moment.

Yours in Truth
