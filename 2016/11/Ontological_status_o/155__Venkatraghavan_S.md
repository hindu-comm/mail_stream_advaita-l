Namaste Chandramouliji,

This is not my view.

This is the suggested reply to the question above.

What you have given below is a very good explanation and I am in agreement.

> My understanding of adhyasa and avidya very briefly  is as follows.
Adhyasa involves two  entities, one real which is the adhisthana and real
while the other is adhyasta and mithya (unreal). Brahman is the first
entity and avidya the second. Avidya as kArana refers to the unmanifest
form of avidya. When the same becomes manifest in the form of nAma/rupa
jagat, it is the kArya form of avidya. Since the unmanifest avidya is
adhyasta in Brahman, the nAma/rUpa jagat being the manifest form of avidya
 also is adhyasta in Brahman. When avidya is referred to as the kArana for
adhyasa my understanding is that the kAranarUpa unmanifest avidya is the
kArana for the kAryarUpa manifest form(jagat) of avidya. Avidya  is not to
be understood as the kArana for adhyAsa itself per se.

I am not saying avidyA is adhyasta on Brahman, I am saying avidyA is, to
use Shankaracharya's words, tattvanyatvAbhyAm anirvachanIya, incapable of
classification as one with Brahman or otherwise.
