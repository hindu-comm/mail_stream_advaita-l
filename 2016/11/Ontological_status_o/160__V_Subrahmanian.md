We have these explicit words of the Bhāṣyakāra:

Mandukya Kārikā 4.58 and bhāṣya:
धर्मा य इति जायन्ते जायन्ते ते न तत्त्वतः ।
जन्म मायोपमं तेषां *सा च माया न विद्यते *॥ ५८ ॥
भाष्यम्
येऽप्यात्मानोऽन्ये च धर्मा जायन्त इति कल्प्यन्ते, ते इति एवंप्रकारा यथोक्ता
संवृतिर्निर्दिश्यत इति संवृत्यैव धर्मा जायन्ते । न ते तत्त्वतः परमार्थतः
जायन्ते । यत्पुनस्तत्संवृत्या जन्म तेषां धर्माणां यथोक्तानां यथा मायया जन्म
तथा तत् मायोपमं प्रत्येतव्यम् । *माया नाम वस्तु तर्हि ; नैवम्, सा च माया न
विद्यते । मायेत्यविद्यमानस्याख्येत्यभिप्रायः ॥*

'Māyā' is the name of that which does not exist.

So, whether one calls it avidyā or māyā, either way, it is non-existent. In
fact one can notice a kind of pun in the above words: while giving a
definition for 'māyā', the bhāṣyakāra says: a-vidyamāna.  The word 'avidyā'
itself says it: na vidyate iti. Although in popular parlance 'a-vidyā' is
that which is not vidyā, right knowledge, yet, it also has this component:
na vidyate iti. It is also agreed by advaitins that 'āvidyakam vastu na
vidyate vastutaḥ.' [That which is a product of avidyā does not really
exist.]
