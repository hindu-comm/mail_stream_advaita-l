Namaste Sri Venkatraghavan Ji,



Reg  << I am not saying avidyA is adhyasta on Brahman, I am saying avidyA
is, to use Shankaracharya's words, tattvanyatvAbhyAm anirvachanIya,
incapable of classification as one with Brahman or otherwise.>>,



Then what I had mentioned in my earlier post namely



quote  << As you have yourself clarified, avidya having Brahman as locus is
to be understood as avidya being the adhyasta and Brahman as adhishthAna,
one being
mithya ( unreal) and the other real. >> unquote



can be taken as my view.  But I would only like to pointout that



<< incapable of classification as one with Brahman or otherwise >>



is the definition of adhyasta in the current context.



Regards
