Thanks, that's interesting. अविद्या "शक्ति" of the individual here is
referred as माया or interchangeably, मायाशक्ति of the individual is माया।

अविद्यालक्षणा is a little different from अविद्याकृत because the former
equates the nature of Maya as avidyA, as seen in introduction to Gita 9.8
also, where Bhashyakara equates both by saying-- एवम् अविद्यालक्षणाम् to
qualify प्रकृतिम् (=मायाम्) in the verse.
