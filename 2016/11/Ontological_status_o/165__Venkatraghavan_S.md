Yes, completely agree.

qualify प्रकृतिम् (=मायाम्) in the verse.

However, with your quoted reference on usage of अविद्याकृतमायाबीजोत्पन्नः
[रज्जुसर्पादिः], again, both are equated, since the word
अविद्याकृतमायाबीजोत्पन्नः would have समासविग्रह as follows: अविद्यया कृतः
अविद्याकृतः। माया एव बीजं मायाबीजम्। मायाबीजात् उत्पन्नः मायाबीजोत्पन्नः।
अविद्याकृत एव मायाबीजोत्पन्नः [रज्जुसर्पादिः] अविद्याकृतमायाबीजोत्पन्नः
[रज्जुसर्पादिः]।  That is, what is created by avidyA, is created by Maya in
the form of seed. Ergo, avidyA = mAyA. :)

is because अविद्या लक्षणं [=स्वरूपं] यस्याः मायायाः सा माया अविद्यालक्षणा
माया।
