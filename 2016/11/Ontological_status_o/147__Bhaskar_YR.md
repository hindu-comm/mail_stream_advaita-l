I think Sri Venkatraghavan prabhuji was clarifying that finding  'kAraNa' for the adhyAstha would suffer from anavasthA dOsha.  What is the 'cause' for that cause would end in anavasthA dOsha..To tackle this problem the term  avidyA has been explained by him as  anAdi, ananta and anirvachaneeya.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!

Namaste

Snake is Adhyasa on Rope. But Rope is Adhyasta on Brahman. Many examples can be given. You are seeing a movie on a screen. Movie is Adhyasta on screen. In that movie the actors may be seeing another movie. The second movie is Adhyasta on the first movie. There is no issue for one thing becoming Adhyasta on another and becoming cause for Adhyasa also for another.

Secondly what is the cause for avidyA to be adhyasta on Brahman in the first place?  This leads to anavasthA, because if you say another avidyA, what is the cause for that being adhyasta, and so on.

>>  Yes, a thing (avidyA) which is  adhyAsta itself cannot be a cause for another adhyAsa hence avidyA is not at all upAdAna kAraNa (material cause) for adhyAsa.  Hence elsewhere Sri SSS clarifies searching for the cause of avidyA is an illegitimate effort and asking the question with regard to the cause of avidyA (jnAnAbhAva) is not legitimate and sane question.  If I use the wrong transaction code (TC) in SAP while doing some work in this module it is quite obvious that I donot know the 'correct' TC  and no sane person would ask for the cause of not knowing the correct TC because everyone knows that it is due to 'absence' of correct knowledge of TC I have used the wrong TC.  So, it will be a waste of effort if we want to search a cause for avidyA which is abhAva rUpa.  avidyA has the ashraya in the person who is asking the question about avidyA...is this person not the brahman atleast according to scriptures :-) If this person realizes that he is brahman then there is no avidyA whatsoever to anyone, clarifies shankara in sUtra bhAshya.  No scope for assuming AtmAshrita mUlAvdiyA or bhAvarUpa avidyA which is on par with brahmAstitva.
