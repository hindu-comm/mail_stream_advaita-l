Devī Māhātmyam in the Kūrmapurāṇa

In the Kurmapurana which has been cited extensively by the Advaitin Sri
Viśveśvara Saraswati in his 'Yatidharma sangraha', there occurs a very
lengthy account of the Supremacy and stuti of Devī, the consort of Lord
Śiva. This file consists of that entire chapter.  Translations have not
been provided. There is also a Devī sahasranāma resembling the Sri
Lalitāsahasranāma. A Viśvarūpa darśanam of Devī akin to the one in the
Bhagavadgita too is present here. The file can be downloaded from this link:
