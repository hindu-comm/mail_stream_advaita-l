Jagadgurus: Sringeri Jagadguru on the Significance of Satsangam: The
Jagadguru said that Sri Adi Shankaracharya has given many Upadeshas for the
welfare of all. He lucidly expounded the Advaita Siddhanta of the
Upanishads in His commentary on the Prasthana Traya. He also penned many
Prakarana Granthas, smaller independent texts to convey succinctly the
teaching of Vedanta. In His prakarana Granthas, the Acharya has mentioned
the importance of Satsangha in a number of places: लोके सज्जनसङ्गतिरेका
भवति भवार्णवतरणे नौका । The company of Satpurushas is alone the boat to
cross this ocean of Samsara सङ्गः सत्सु विधीयतां भगवतो भक्तिर्दृढाधीयताम् ।
Be in the company of Satpurushas and strengthen your Bhakti सत्सङ्गत्वे
निःसङ्गत्वं निःसङ्गत्वे निर्मोहत्वम् । In the company of Satpurushas,
arises detachment and detachment results in the removal of delusion Video:
