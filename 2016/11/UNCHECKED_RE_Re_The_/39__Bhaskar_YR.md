Kindly pardon me, first of all I have not read the link you provided as I am not able to open the link. I am just going by whatever written in the mail.   You said prAjnA is not  trustworthy has to be ignored along with  vishva and taijasa as he ( prAjna) is associated with kAraNa shareera.  What exactly is this kAraNa shareera??  If it is a sort of avidyA then prAjnA is associated with avidyA in sushupti right prabhuji??  Then in this avidyA state of prAjnA, can shruti claim there veda is aveda, deva is adeva etc.??  It has been said there in shruti like this just to denote the fact that it is ekeebhUtaM.  But we are saying here prAjnA has the upAdhi here (kAraNa shareera) hence he is not trustworthy but OTOH, shruti saying  veda is aveda because ashareeraM vAva santaM na priyApriye sprushataH how??  It is again because here prAjnA is sarvOpAdhivinirmuktaH is it not !!??

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!

I don't understand why this is relevant or a problem.

I donot know whether the below is pUrvapaxi's stand or siddhAnta.  When prAjnA is still associated with kAraNa shareera why veda is aveda, deva is adeva etc.  there in sushupti ??  Atra veda aveda is acceptable to us even though prAjna is associated with his kAraNa shareera/ avidyA, if it is the stand of the siddhAnti ??

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!

Namaste Sri Ravi Kiran,
Because prAjna is still associated with kAraNa sharIra, and therefore part of kAraNa prapancha. Only from turIya's perspective, which is completely disassociated from all sharIras, can the judgment be made.

Venkatraghavan
