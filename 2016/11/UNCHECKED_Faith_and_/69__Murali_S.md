V Subramanian ji,
Namaskarams.

In humility I ask,is there any independent verification of this
incident?(like reference in books published by Sri Vidyatheertha Foundation)

Seems to be embellished in the tradition of "...." and also published in
Sakthi Vikatan?
(Can vidyaarthis ask Acharyal to recite Ramayanam,Acharyal doing Ramayana
Upanyaasam,in which language,acharyal 'forgetting' aasana for
Anjaneya(r),Acharyal coming out at 8 o clock after darshan,vidyaarthis
asking doubts(!) about style of pravachanam(!) -then the "talk" about- etc)

Might seem trivial in a forum devoted to Vedanta Vichaara.Still cant help
asking.

S.Murali
