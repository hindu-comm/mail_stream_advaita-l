It was not Krishna Bhagavans problem but his audience.  Shankaracharya 
observes in the Gitabhashya that Arjuna was a madhyama adhikari.  Not 
completely dumb but not the brightest either.  Why was the Gita upadesh 
given to him and not other eminently more suitable people such as 
Vedavyasa or Bhishma?  This is an illustration of the great krpa and daya 
of Bhagavan that he provided this precious knowledge to all not just the 
elite and perfected sages.

However, a good teacher shapes his lessons to the capability of the 
student.  Having seen that Arjuna has failed to fully grasp the lessons of 
the Gita wouldn't it be futile to just keep repeating it?  Hence He took a 
slightly different tack in the Anugita.
