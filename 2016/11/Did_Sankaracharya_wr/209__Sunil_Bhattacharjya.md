Dear friends, 

I came to know that Dr.. R..D.Karmarkar wrote a paper  entitled "Did Sankaracharya write a bhasya on the Bhagavad Gita", which appeared in the Annals of the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute, vol. 39 (part 4) 1958. I understand that the author concludes that Adi Shankara might not have written a bhashya on the Bhagavad Gita.  Has any scholar from this group studied this paper of Dr. Karmarkar or seen any other paper by other author(s) critically looking at the conclusions of Dr. Karmarkar.

Regards,
Sunil K. Bhattacharjya
