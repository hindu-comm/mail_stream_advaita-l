Namaste

While reading this account recently in a group, I recalled having read it
some years ago, in a person's private collection of incidents. I do not
remember now the details, though.  A couple of months ago someone in this
group mentioned about a Sundara Kanda upanyasam by Acharyal in TN but I
could not get any confirmed reply from my contacts.

I think vidyarthi-s, that too visiting from a different place, can be
recipients of special audience. In any case they did not ask Acharyal to
'recite' the Ramayanam.

In order to benefit those coming from TN, it could have been in Tamil.

I think this is not impossible.

Such things are not ruled out in Sringeri.

If Acharyal had given them opportunity to pose questions, this is also not
impossible.
