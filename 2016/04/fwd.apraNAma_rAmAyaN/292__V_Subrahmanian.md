'Praṇāma rāmāyaṇam' - Sanskrit - Tamil



The above work, a verse-composition based on the Valmiki Ramayana, authored
by Pattamaḍai Sri Subrahmanya Sastriṇaḥ (1830-1910), consisting of 680
verses over the six kāṇḍa-s, was first published in 1970.  Now, the book is
republished with a fine Tamil Translation.  This book contains the verses
in Devanagari, a Tamil transliteration and a translation by Sri Rāmā
Ghanapāṭhinaḥ.
