Sorry friends,

There was a typo. Please read <Bhagavad Gita : II-19>  as  <The Original Bhagavad Gita : II-19>

Thanks and regards,

 Namaste,

 The Ajativada verse in Bhagavad Gita II-19 , which is the
 same as used by Gaudapada in Mandukya-karika II-6, says it
 all that there has been the Brahman alone in the beginning
 and He alone is at the end and there is none else in
 between. So all the Jagat as experienced under the influence
 of Maya vanishes the moment one gets out of the grip of
 Maya. Thus the reality of Jagat is untenable and it is
 best said by calling the Jagat as Mithya. However,this is
 easier said than realized, while remaining within the world
 of Maya. Only the sthitaprajna, who is able to control the
 mind to desist desires of the senses, and does the Manana
 and Dhyana, (i.e.,in the yoga-yukta state) can get truly
 convinced of this truth.

  The above
  conclusion is contradicted by Shankara, in BGB 2.16 end:

  त्वमपि
  तत्त्वदर्शिनां
  दृष्टिमाश्रित्य शोकं
  मोहं च हित्वा
  शीतोष्णादीनि
  नियतानियतरूपाणि
  द्वन्द्वानि
  *विकारोऽयमसन्नेव
  मरीचिजलवन्मिथ्यावभासते
  *इति
  मनसि
  निश्चित्य तितिक्षस्व
  इत्यभिप्रायः।।

  Translation by Swami
  Gambhirananda:

  Therefore,
  you too, by adopting *the vision of the men of realization
  *and
  giving up sorrow and delusion, forbear
  the dualities, heat, cold, etc. some
  of
  which are definite in their nature, and others inconstant
 ,
  mentally
  being convinced that this
  (phenomenal world) is changeful, *verily unreal
  and appears falsely like water in a
  mirage.//*

  The Kannada
  translation of the above line of the bhashyam by Sri SSS:

  //nīnū antaḥ
  tattvadarśigaḷa dṛṣṭīyannu āśrayisikoṇḍu
  śokavannū mohavannū
  biṭṭu
  śītosṇagaḷu muntāda niyatarūpavāgiyū
  aniyatarūpavāgiyū iruva
  dvandagaḷannu
  'idu kāryavāddarinda bisilukudureya nīrinante asatte
  āgiddu
  husiyāgi toruttide' endu
  manassinalli niścayisikoṇḍu taḍeduko endu
  abhiprāya.//

  Sri SSS has very correctly translated the
  bhashya: the way in which the
  Jnani sees the
  world, its transformations: as the mirage water even
  though
  non-existent, asat, yet appears
  unreal. The Kannada word for that is
  'husiyāgi toruvudu'. So, according
  to the translation, the Jnani will see
  the
  world, its transformations, as a mere appearance, knowing
  that it does
  not exist really.

  Someone can kindly reproduce
  here Sri SSS's translation for the following
  bhashya sentences too, especially the 4.1.19
  BSB.


  In
  the BSB 4.1.15 Shankara clearly says:

  बाधितमपि तु
  मिथ्याज्ञानं
  द्विचन्द्रज्ञानवत्संस्कारवशात्कंचित्कालमनुवर्तत
  एव
  ।
  [Even after
  having been annulled, sublated, the mithyājnānam,
  false-knowledge, like the two-moon perception,
  will certainly continue for
  some time.]
  BSB 4.1.19

  ननु सत्यपि
  सम्यग्दर्शने यथा
  प्राग्देहपाताद्भेददर्शनं
  द्विचन्द्रदर्शनन्यायेनानुवृत्तम्,
  एवं
  पश्चादप्यनुवर्तेत —
 न,
  निमित्ताभवात् ।
  Objection: Even when the right realization is
  there, just as perception of
  difference,
  bheda darshanam, persists till the fall of the body (of
  the
  Jnani), let it (perception of bheda)
  continue even after death?
  [For this
  objection Shankara answers,
  उपभोगशेषक्षपणं हि
  तत्रानुवृत्तिनिमित्तम्,
  न च तादृशमत्र
  किञ्चिदस्ति । [The exhaustion of
  experience of prarabdha alone is the limit
  for such continuance (of bheda
  darshanam).
  Such prarabdha is no longer there after the body falls.
  Thus, Shankara explicitly says that the Jnani
  perceives the mithyā world,
  with the
  knowledge that it is mithya. That is why he is giving
 the
  analogy
  of (1) the mirage water - where the
  water appearance is continuing to be
  perceived but the knowledge that it is mithya
  is also there and (2) the
  two-moon
  perception where owing to an ocular disease, a person
  perceives
  two moons while he knows that it
  is only one. These two analogies, for
  Shankara, are to explain the state of the
  Jnani's perception of the world
  of
  multiplicity, while he knows that it is mithyā.

  This topic was discussed long
  ago, in 2009, and an article available here
  was the outcome of that:
