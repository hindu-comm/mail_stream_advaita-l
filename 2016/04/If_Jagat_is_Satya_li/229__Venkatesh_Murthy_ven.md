Namaste

Everything is Brahman and Jagat is also Brahman. Therefore Jagat is
Satya only not Mithya. Everything in the world is Satya and Brahman
only. This argument will have objection by Dvaitis like this. If
everything is Brahman and Satya the dog's excreta lying in the street
is also Satya and Brahman. What is the difference between you and that
dog's excreta? You both are the same.

Therefore to avoid becoming same as dog's excreta we have to say Jagat
and everything in Jagat is Mithya. Dog's excreta is also Mithya only.
It is not Satya. But Sruti has said Tat Tvam Asi and Aham Brahmasmi.
Therefore I am not Mithya. I am Brahman. I am Satya.
