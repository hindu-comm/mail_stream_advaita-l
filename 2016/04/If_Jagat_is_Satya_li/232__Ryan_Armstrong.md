Namaste Venkatesh Ji
" What is the difference between you and that dog's excreta?"

If I may be so bold as to answer your question with a question:
Who, or what is meant by the word "you"?

Does "you" refer to this being, the composite of body, mind and nature?
This is what, through avidya I spend most of the time believing myself to
be.
In which case there is no difference - both the excreta and the "so-called"
self are simply forms of matter.

Or does "you" refer to the True Self?
In that case, the body-composite and the excreta cannot be said to be "It"
but merely name-and-form not different in composition to "It", but not
Brahman.
If everything perceived by the senses is Brahman then there are countless
millions of Brahmans - that is not advaita.

Brahman is unmanifest.
The "sameness" is in the essence, not in the manifestation.
For one thing, I smell slightly better than the excreta so already there is
a distinction and the claim of "sameness" cannot be applied.

Yours in Truth
Ryan
