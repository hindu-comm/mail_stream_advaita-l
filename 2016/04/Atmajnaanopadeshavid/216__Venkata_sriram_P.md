Namaste,

You question seems something like this:

When Vishnu appears, instead of prostrating before Him, one tends to test 
the purity of Kaustubha he wears and asking the percentage of carats of Gold the 
ornaments consists of.

Read the book and grasp the essence of it.  It is a good prakaraNa grantha.

regs,
sriram
