ईश्बरः सर्बभुतानाम
हृद्देशेऽर्जुन तिष्ठति
भ्रामয়ण सर्बभुतानि
यन्त्ररूঢ়ानि माয়য়ा।।-श्रीमद्भगबतगीता

Who is this Ishvara who dwells in every living entity? If jeeva has free 
will then, why should Ishvara be controlling him? Jeeva performs action 
because of his samskara, avayasa and vasana as far as I know. Can this 
Ishvara be equated with those three insentient objects? Self is the 
shelter of objective universe.
