The contention of Advaita is that it is samskAra that is the prerequisite
for adhyAsa. The ontological status of the vastu or of the knowledge of
such vastu, can vary in different instances of adhyAsa and is not the
"cause" of adhyAsa - as long as samskAra is generated, that samskAra is
necessary for future AdhyAsa of that vastu.

The problem of anyonya Ashraya is only valid if you believe that creation
has a finite beginning - however, in advaita, srishTi is anAdi, so your
rule that samskAra requires a "real vastu to start with" is not true as
there is no "start" of creation.

The argument that was being made earlier was to deny the requirement for
similarity as a precondition for adhyAsa. Your point is well made that the
perception of blueness in the sky is not an adhyAsa itself - there is a
scientific principle to explain it (scattering effect). This makes the
blueness appear on a photo taken by a jaDa camera too. What is adhyAsa in
the example is the superimposition of a blueness attribute on the sky, made
by ignorant people, based on the perception of blueness in the sky.  The
point that was being made was that there was no similarity between blueness
and the sky for that adhyAsa to occur. So, similarity as a pre-condition to
adhyAsa was being refuted.
