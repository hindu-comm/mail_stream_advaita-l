 Namaste

In the Vivekacudamani it is said 'Sabdajaalam Mahaaranyam
Cittabhramanakaaranam'. We can see it is exactly happening here in
this discussion. People have made huge number of posts and created a
huge network. But this network is a big forest of words and it is
creating confusion only in the mind.

Simple sentence Brahma Satyam Jagan Mithya Jeevo Brahmaiva Naparaha is
causing so much confusion? Some people are following a bad rule 'If
you cant convince them confuse them'. This is a bad way of discussing.
Kindly do not confuse others because you cannot convince them.
