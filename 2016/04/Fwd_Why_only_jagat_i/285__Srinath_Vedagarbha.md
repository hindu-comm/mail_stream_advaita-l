While I agree that jnyAna which is the cause of saMskAra (for the
illusions) must not necessarily a pramA. However, the very cause which
generates such bhramA must necessarily be real.  The image of the ghost on
the cinema screen is quite real even if the vastu it suppose to represent
is asat. So also in cases of silver as adhyasyamAna, the "image" one sees
in silver-shop behind glass case is real as well. The only difference is
that while the image in the shop correctly represent the real vasthu (no
subsequent bhAdaka and coupled with vEdAntin's doctrine of pramANya
svatatsva), the image in cinema hall does not.

This is because, superimposed vastu is alIka as far its astva/abhAva is
limited to the given specific Eka dESha-kAla. It is real in other
dESha-kAla. Hare's horn is atyanta-asat, where laxaNa of "atyanta" stands
for serva dESha-kAla. Both are not the same.

Side question -- if you deny perceptability/knowability (pratIti) to asat
padArtha, then one wonder how mAyavAdins conceive asat-vilaxaNatvaM when
they define mithya as asat-lilaxaNa along with sad-vilaxaNa. Unless you
know what is asat, then only you can say given thing is "other than" asat.
But itself is used as hEtu in the anumAna 'asat chEt na pratiyatE'.
