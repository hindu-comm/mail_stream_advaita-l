Sri Bhaskar cannot be correct because Question 2 and 3 are
contradicting each other. If Answer for Question 2 is yes answer for
Question 3 will have to be No only.
If the Mattur scholar is saying yes for Question 2 he is saying yes
keeping in mind all points in Prasthana Traya Bhashya. Then why will
he go into deep analysis for
question 3 again? If answer for question 2 is No answer to question 3
will have to be yes only. Because nothing can be both Satya and
Mithya.

Problem in Sri Bhaskar's mind is he is thinking Mithya is totally
false like rabbit's horns totally Asat. But nobody said Jagat is like
that. It is not Sat and not Asat. That is why it is Mithya. This is
the most difficult part to understand in Advaita.
