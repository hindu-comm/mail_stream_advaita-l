Namaste Shri Bhaskarji.
If it is relevant only for a mumukshu who has to develop the vairagya, then what is the purpose of the discussions which ascribe this world-view onto a jnaani and then refuting it ? 
Is it not out of context?

Warm Regards
Venkateswaran N E

> IMHO, jagan mithyatva is for the mumukshu who has to develop the vairagya to realize the ultimate truth of his svarUpa.  Since our organs (indriya-s) designed in such a way to always go out, shAstra advises us to see the duHkha and dOsha in this temporary  jagat, our attachment to it and vyavahAra with it.  Hence there is much preference to sarva karma saNyAsa in saMpradAya.  So, jagan mithyatva teaching is for the sAdhaka mumukshu-s, ajnAni who wrongly think jagat is independent from him.  For the jnAni, from his paramArtha jnana realizes that this bAdhya lOka is not Atma vyatireka.  This jagat in its causal form nothing but brahman.  In short, for the ajnAni this jagat is like 'gandharva nagari, mAyAjAla, avidyA parikalpita whereas for the brahma jnAni this jagat is brahmameva and for him there exists nothing but brahman.  The mundaka shruti explains this beautifully : brahmaivedamamrutaM purastAt, brahma pashchAt, brahma dashiNOttareNa, adhashchOrdhvaM cha prasrutaM bramaivedaM vishvamidaM varishtaM, satyanchAnrutaMcha satyamabhavat, yadidaM kiMcha.
