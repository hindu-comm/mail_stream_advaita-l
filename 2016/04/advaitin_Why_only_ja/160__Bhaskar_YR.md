For my study sake, can i know some references from scriptures which specifically says Brahman is the adhishTanam of the jagat.

>  sOkAmayata bahusyAM pajAyeyeti, dhAtA yathA purvamakalpayat, and in purusha sUkta we say : sarvANi rUpANi vichitya dheeraH nAmAni krutAbhivadan, yadAste etc.  and svetAshvatara says : ekO devaH sarvabhUteshu gudAH, sarva bhUtAntarAtma, karmAdhyaksha, kevalO nirguNascha in the geeta also it has been said parApara prakruti is paramAtma. So that which is adhishtAnaM the same adhishtAnaM is also upAdAna of this jagat.  Hence he is abhinna nimittOpadAna kAraNa for this jagat.


Also , i would like to know few references from Shruti or Bhasya which specifically indicates that Jagat should be considered as Vivartopadana karana and not Abbinimmittopadana Karana.

>  Since we, the advaitins donot accept the svagata bheda in brahman, some would brought-in vivartOpadAna kAraNaM of this jagat and attributed to brahman and to explain nAma rUpa vyakaraNa (vikAra / changing nature) brought in mAya in the form of  pariNAmi upAdAna kAraNaM.  It is OK as long as you keep in mind that before creation, sustenance of creation and the dissolution of creation in all the three period of time this jagat does not exist apart from its kAraNa, effect is cause only does not deviate from cause trishu kAleshu.  So, whether it is vivarta or pariNAmi the ultimate siddhAnta is kArya is not an independent entity  and it is cause only in its causal form. 

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
