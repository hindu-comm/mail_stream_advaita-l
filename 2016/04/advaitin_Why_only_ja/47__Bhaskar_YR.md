praNAms Sri Chandramouli prabhuji
Hare Krishna

I have heard this from Prof. SKR’s one of the discourses.  Sri Pramod Bharadwaj prabhuji has created a whatsapp group in which he shared my lead post.  In that group, during the discussion,  one Sri Satya Prakash prabhuji shared this discourse and he too shared his thoughts questioning the jagat mithyatva as popularly understood.  I am CC ing this mail to Sri Pramod Bharadwaj prabhuji and requesting him if possible to share that audio discourse with you.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
Bhaskar

PS :  Planning to close this thread after writing my final (wrong) understanding on this topic as I am getting lot of personal ‘firing’ mails from all corners of advaitins’  world including calling me a pracchanna dvaiti (ISKCONite) in the mask of advaita ☺

Sri Bhaskar Ji,

 Pranams.

Reg  <<Having said this, as I clarified earlier, the above stand is not a ‘new born baby’ in shankara saMpradAya ☺ stalwarts like Late Prof. SKR Rao (was heading the Kalpataru Research Institution at Sringeri Mutt, B.lore branch) And other eminent and devoted scholars who are no more good friend of my parama guruji Sri SSS at any stretch of imagination ☺ are of the same opinion. >>,

Please provide some references to where Sri SSS, Prof. SKR Rao and other eminent and devoted scholars have taken the stand that  << according to Sri Bhagavatpada jagat is not mithya >> which is what you are saying and citing them in support thereof. I have made an extensive study of the works of Sri SSS at least and I cannot recollect any instance where he has taken such a stand. Maybe I have missed out ( which is very unlikely ) and I would like to take a relook based on your references.

Pranams and Regards
