Hare Krishna

That is Jiva becomes a jnani. For him the world is mithya .Thus Jagat becomes mithya for a Jnani.

>  jnAni's darshana of jagat is not mithyA darshana it is satya darshana in its causal form.  He would see no more vikAra of the ornaments he would see only upAdAna and nimitta of those ornaments (vikAra) i.e. GOLD!!  There is nothing that can exist apart from Atman for him hence there will be no more mithyatva darshana for him.  Just see what shankara says with regard to this in bruhad bhAshya : I realize myself as that immortal brahman in which the five panchajanas and the unmanifest jagat are woven like the warp and the woof.  I am thinking that I am not different from that.  It is because the external world neither opposed to the jnAni nor it appears as mithya for the jnAni because everything is Atman for him and he is the Atman for everything.  

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
