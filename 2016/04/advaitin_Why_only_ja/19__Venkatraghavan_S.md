Namaste Sri Bhaskar ji,
I see that we are just repeating, so I will only respond to this point
briefly:

<<Kindly give me the shankara bhAshya / shruti quote where it has been said
that brahman’s nimittA & upAdAna kAraNa both are mithyA >>

Mandukya kArika, Agama PrakaraNa:

नान्तःप्रज्ञं नबहिःप्रज्ञं नोभयतःप्रज्ञं नप्रज्ञानघनं नप्रज्ञं नाप्रज्ञम् ।
अदृश्यमव्यवहार्यमग्राह्यमलक्षणमचिन्त्यमव्यपदेश्यमेकात्मप्रत्ययसारं
**प्रपञ्चोपशमं** शान्तं शिवमद्वैतं चतुर्थं मन्यन्ते स आत्मा स विज्ञेयः ॥ ७ ॥

AchAryA's BhAshya for प्रपञ्चोपशमं:

प्रपञ्चोपशममिति जाग्रदादिस्थानधर्माभाव उच्यते

What is जाग्रत् स्थानधर्म if not कार्य प्रपञ्च? कार्य प्रपञ्च अभाव = जगत्
मिथ्या.

कार्यस्य मिथ्यात्वात् कारणस्य मिथ्यात्वं संभवति.

Regards,
Venkatraghavan
