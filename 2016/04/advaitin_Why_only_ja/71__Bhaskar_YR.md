praNAms Sri Ramesam Vemuri prabhuji
Hare Krishna

Sorry I read the  name Prof. A. Rambacchan as Prof. SKR perhaps in a hurry & pleasure to notice my thoughts in that paragraph :-)  However, just a mail received from one prabhuji (who has pointed out my mistake) who directly wrote to me says that  Prof. SKR like in his audio discourse, in his works too (like shaankara vedAnta, Consciousness in Advaita and shankara & adhyAsa bhAshya) questions the popular belief of jagat mithyatva and claims that Prof. SKR  clearly said somewhere in one of his works that  :  I don’t think shankara in his commentaries advocate the jagat mithyatva as popularly believed in Advaita circle.  Anyway, I am searching the details of his statement for my own academic interest.  

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!

praNAms Sri Ramesam Vemuri prabhuji

He says:  “Too much energy has been expended in traditional adviata metaphysics in establishing the so-called unreality of the world. The world, in itself, is neither illusory nor deceptive. The world simply is.  Ignorance is a human characteristic because of which one fails to apprehend the non-difference of the world from brahman.  In fact, the world, as non-different from brahman, enjoys the same permanency and reality as brahman.  In the words of Shankara, ‘Just as the brahman, the cause, is never without existence in all three periods of time, so also the universe, which is an effect, never parts company with Existence in all the three periods’.”

It is quite informative and useful to read the entire chapter for a thorough discussion of the topic from several angles with many citations.


Ø     Thank you very much for quoting this reference from Sri Prof. SKR’s book prabhuji.  In fact I am not too much familiar with all of his works but through some reliable sources I know that this late Prof. SKR was in disagreement with Sri SSS’s stand though he used to hold Sri SSS and his scholarship in high esteem.

Ø    BTW, can I have this book anywhere on-line in PDF format prabhuji??  Anyway, to our misfortune, these quotes are not so meaningful and out of context category to most of the prabhuji-s since it is not traditional stand of Advaita according to them.  I have seen the comments with regard to this quote of yours and questioning the very credibility and doubting the scholarship of Prof. Sri SKR, who was heading the official research foundation of dakshiNamnaya sringeri shArada peetha.  It is because of this main reason I always avoid to bring any names in these discussions…let us make the boundaries of this discussion to only shruti and shankara’s prasthAna traya bhAshya.  For that matter prakaraNa grantha-s like upadesha sAhasri, aparOkshAnubhUti etc. have plenty of verses in support of jagat satyatva in its causal form.  But I am sure prabhuji-s have their own interpretation to these verses as well  just like me  ☺   Anyway thanks once again prabhuji for your timely intervention and quoting Sri Prof. SKR’s work when it is specifically called for. ☺

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
