jIva is a result of misunderstanding of what? You have to qualify the
misunderstanding. Looks like you misunderstood my usage of
"misunderstanding" as avidyA. I am saying that jIva misunderstands himself
due to the avidyA/ ignorance of his own nature being brahman. (The
so-called original question has been answered very well in the Advaita
Vedanta tradition itself, so I don't want to open another can of worms).

This is *not* what I said (that jIvatva is BMSC), but I said jIvatva (that
you quoted earlier as jIvAhood) is an erroneous notion of individuality.
jIva being brahman, brahman is left, which was always there, even with the
wrong notion. When you remove error from jIva-brahman, brahman alone is
left, which was called as jIva. Anyway, I don't face this question you put,
because jIva = brahman. In my analysis of the ardhashloka, the main
sentence is jIvobrahmaiva na aparaH. That being said, jIva =brahma =satyam.
Everything else = BMSC =jagat =mithyA. In other words, after you negate
everything you can, what is left as unnegatable is brahman, which is you.

chid is not a part of jIva. chid is the whole. Anyway, what you say is
right that BMSC is mithyA. However, do know that BMSC is jagat and jagat is
mithyA.



PS: I think people find it difficult to understand BMSC=jagat because one
doesn't call jagat that he sees outside himself as his own BMSC, but fails
to see that jagat is some "other" jIvA's BMSC, and jIva being brahman, you
can say that it is brahman's BMSC, or his own BMSC.
