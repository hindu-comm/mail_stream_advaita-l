Sri Aurobind Ji,



Regarding your observation  << That's why Acharya keeps saying DhyayateEva
LelayateEva. The term Eva is the catch which is being missed out. >>,



you can notice the difference between parinama and vivarta vikara in the
following two.  For parinama  << mrittiketyeva satyam >> while for vivarta
it is << sadeva idam >>. In the former it is “iti eva “ while in the latter
it is “ eva “ only. When “ iti eva “ is used, kAryam is real as kArana only
and hence both have same level of Reality. When only “ eva “ is used kArana
alone is Real and kArya is not real. Hence they have different levels of
Reality. That is what denotes  the kArya as mithya when only “ eva “ is
used.



 Pranams and Regards
