Sorry for too many replies. I am just now catching up with the discussion.

I appreciate the rigor of above logic.

Btw, sad-asad-vilaxaNam for this jagat best fits in Dvaita model. This
jagat is *different* from asat such as hare's horn on the grounds that it
is a valid pratIti or pramA jnyAna in Brhamn. at the same time this jagat
is also *different* from sat (Brahman) on the grounds of it's dependency.

Your point 1 does not apply for dvaitins as they deny aikya between jagat
and Brahamn.

Point 2 also does not apply to them, as they do not hold jagat is same as
Brhman.

Point 3 and its infinite regression does not applies as well. This is
because the posited difference between jagat and Brahman is quite satya and
not sad-asad-vilaxaNa (or mithya).
