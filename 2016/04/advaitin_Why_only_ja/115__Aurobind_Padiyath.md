Sri Chandramouliji

"if you were to add , after Brahman “ which is nirvikAra “ to which I
presume you agree, you have indeed identified jagat as mithya because that
is the definition of mithya. But unfortunately at the same time you say
jagat is not mithya also."

■ I've not identified jagat as mithyA. Jagat in its swaroopa is the same
for everything in the jagat, which includes the Jeeva and Ishvara. That
swaroopa is called brahman. The VikAra is only in appearance not in its
swaroopa. That's why Acharya keeps saying DhyayateEva LelayateEva. The term
Eva is the catch which is being missed out.
Regards
Aurobind
