People not following any Sampradaya can manufacture any statement but
it is neither accepted by Advaitis nor Dvaitis. Advaiti Sampradaya is
always saying Brahma is alone Satya Jagat is Mithya and Jeeva is
Brahman only. Dvaitis are saying Hari Sarvottama Vayu Jeevottama and
Jagat is Satya. Let them say. We cannot change Advaiti statement.
