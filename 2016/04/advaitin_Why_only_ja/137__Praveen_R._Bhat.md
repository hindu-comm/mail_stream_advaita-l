We're back to square one! In the spirit of jumping, we have somehow jumped
back to the beginning of the first thread in about 250 odd mails here!! :)

The jIva misunderstands himself as the superimposed part of jagat, that
makes up the body mind sense complex (BMSC), while he is really brahman.
Somehow the crucial point is amiss that BMSC *is* jagat. The jIvatva is
really the erroneous notion of individuality. While the individual
considers the part of jagat, that is BMSC, which he associates with as
himself, he doesn't have the same problem with the rest of the jagat. Thats
why jagat appears to be as separate from one's own BMSC. However, BMSC is
as much jagat as the outside jagat is and therefore as mithyA as jagat.
Therefore, brahma satya jaganmithyA is saying that jIva's association with
mithyA jagat is an error, jIva is brahman.
