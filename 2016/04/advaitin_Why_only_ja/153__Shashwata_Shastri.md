Namaste to All,

"*There is a legend which states that when the four brahma-rishis Sanaka,
> Sanandana, Sanatana, Sanatkumara who are collectively called as ‘kumaras’,
> emerged from Brahma as his mind born sons; they didn’t show interest in
> becoming prajapati and helping Brahma in further creating by procreating
> offsprings. They were constantly in search of brahma-gyanam. They were
> looking for a preceptor capable of dispelling their all doubts. While being
> on lookout for such a preceptor they were wandering from pillar to post
> when suddenly in one secluded place they saw a huge banyan tree (vata
> vruksham) and under that tree they found a sixteen years old young lad
> ‘Dakshinamurty’ sitting surrounded by octogenarian sages. The names and
> number of these sages vary in various agamas. These four kumaras gravitated
> to the serene looking face of that Dakshinamurty and sat surrounding him.
> Soon they got absorbed into the supreme silence of Dakshinamurty and all
> their queries related to Brahman got resolved.*"






*"kaa.nsyaghaNTaaninaadastu yathaa liiyati shaantaye | o~Nkaarastu tathaa
yojyaH shaantaye sarvamichchhataa | yasminviliiyate shabdastatparaM brahma
giiyate | dhiya.n hi liiyate brahma so.amR^itatvaaya kalpate |”
(Brahmavidya Upanishad 12-13)*

*“And just as the sound of a metal utensil – or of a gong dies in silence –
so he, who seeks the All lets the OM sound fade away in silence. For that
wherein the sound fades away is the Brahman, the higher. Yea, the whole
sound is Brahman and conduces to immortality”.*Best Regards,
