If you limit to say that there is no doership or enjoyership in jnAni's
vyavahAra, it is understood or
jnAni experiences happiness or sorrow (or profit/loss), but he knows, it is
not paramArtham or
it doesn't exist in his nitya shuddha buddha mukta sva-svarUpa.

But, when it is said as samyak vyavahAra, isn't it, the prAdhAnya to his
samyak jnAna or brahmaikatva jnAna alone?

Is there anything "apart" or "other" from this samyak jnAna ?

 Question is : when you claim - jnAni's vyavahAra as satyatvam eva, the
satyam you are attributing to his samyak jnAna or anything else?

Yes., if the reference is strictly to "brahmaikatva jnAna" alone.

In the jnAna sthithi, why then bring up the word "vyavahAra"? why not say,
everything happens spontaneously or sahajam as far as jnAni is considered ?

True, since Brahman alone IS, how else can you express this .. :)
