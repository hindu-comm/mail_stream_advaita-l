jnAni's brahmaikatva jnana and jnAni's vyavahAra are in different realms, former is paramArthikam, while other is not ..


Ø   I have said for the  jnAni how the kAryAkAra (nAma rUpa) is veshesha darshana of kAraNa and how the transactions (vyavahAra) related to kAryAkAra is ‘vishesha shakti’ of that kAraNa by quoting shankara from chAndOgya.  This kArya-kAraNa tAdAtmya lakshaNa (non-difference) for the brahma vAdins (jnAni-s) not only restricted to the names and forms but it applies to even to his ‘socalled’ transactions.  The  vyavahAra is not with katrutva bhOktruva buddhi and his transactions are not avidyA lepita hence it is not from his individual socalled BMI, it is from his samyak jnana or bhUma drushti.  And in that drushti (point of view) he is anna (food), annAda (eater of food) and the shlOkakarta (who bridges anna & annAda).  It is because of this reason only jnAni would not have  shareera of his own, though he is looking like shareeri (emdodied), doing bhikshAcharya etc. it is only in the sight of ajnAni’s  only and  he is ‘ashareeri’ only.

If this Atmaikatva jnana (as he says) is extended further to a different realm ( as in jnAni's vyavahAra he quotes - whatever he does is satyameva, his vyavahAra with this jagat  is satyameva ), I see the dilution (avidya kalpita) ...

Prabhuji, jnAni’s vyavahAra with samyak jnana is not dilution nor it is avidyA kalpita coz. jnAni’s realization of Atmaikatva jnana would fetch him the knowledge that whatever he see as kArya (nAma and rUpa) is kevala vishesha darshana of the kAraNa (brahman) and whatever he does (vyavahAra) with that vishesha darshana kArya is nothing but vishesha darshana of that Shakti.  It is because of this reason bhAshyakAra says brahmavAdi would realize the kAryakAraNa tAdAtmyalakshNa saMbandha and for him through this Atmaikatva jnana sarva vyavahAram satyatvam eva..sadAtmanA satyatvAbhyupagamAt..sarva vyavahArANAM sarva vikArANAM cha satyatvaM.  It is not his (jnAni’s) avidyA kalpita delution it is the result of his samyak darshana , sama darshitvaM.
