With that question, there is nothing left to negate, including the body-mind -sense complex which is part of jagat, and the entire neti neti prakriyA is thrown out, like baby with the bath water.

IMHO, it is those who are throwing the baby with the bath water in the zeal of proving the brahma nirvisheshatva and asserting the jagat mithyatva :-) what exactly is this neti neti??  Does this neti neti asking us to throw away the jagat for which brahman is the abhinna nimittOpadAna kAraNa??  Neti neti should end in realizing that there is nothing that exists Atma vyatirikta.  Neti neti ityasya kOrthaH?? Na hi etasmAt brahmaNO vyatiriktamasti ityarthaH, clarifies shankara in sUtra bhAshya.  In the  Neti neti negation iti refers to jeeva mAnasa pratyaya mithyA jagat due to his anyathAgrahaNa ajnAna / avidyA and  that which is jneya (jagat) for this mithyA jnana of jeeva is not brahma, neti neti. And brahman svabhAvaM is not prapancha coz. Neha nAnAsti kiMchana...To protect this brahma nirvisheshatva, nirvikAratva there is no need to throw away the brahma kArya for which brahman is the only adhishtAnaM as well as upAdAnaM.  Jagat is pratyaksha pramANita whereas brahman's nirvisheshatva, niravayavatva, nirguNatva etc. is Agama siddha. 

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
