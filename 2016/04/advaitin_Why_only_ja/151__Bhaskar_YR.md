This long dragged discussion demands a final verdict. 

>  final verdict!! from which side you are expecting this final verdict?? Whether  from jagat mithyAvAdins or Atmaikatva/sarvAtmakatva vAdins??  And again, even if you chose one from these two parties, other party (other than what you chose) would always be eager to prove the verdict from the opposite party is subject to further appeal in the next court of law :-) Hence, don’t expect verdict from the discussants, try to reconcile both the viewpoints come to a legitimate conclusion / understanding of the topic on your own, take it to your guru, get the doubts clarified from him and accept the 'final verdict' from him.  Kindly don’t expect a final verdict so soon, on these issues especially on this list,  when the hearing is still going on :-) 


I have went  through many of the mails. All it seems , is the same point being   risen again and again. An infinite loop of word jugglery, sadly nothing else.

>  Sometimes repetition is required to maintain the consistency in the presentation of our viewpoints.  For that matter, shankara himself uses same shruti vAkya-s again and again at various places to insist certain points.  Charvita charvaNa is part of the mananaM in Advaita sAdhana.  If this is not satisfies you & if you are tired  of seeing the repetitive mails, you always have the 'delete' button in your key board, press it and get rid of the trouble of reading monotonous mails, simple is it not?? :-)

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
