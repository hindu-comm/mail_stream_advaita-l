Understood behind all your expressions, you are trying to highlight the
significance of having samyak or brahmaikatva  ekamevAdvitIya advaita
paramArtha jnAna for experiencing krta-krtyata ..  this is expressed in so
many ways as jnAni seeing satyatvam only, there is no avidya kalpita bhEdha
drushti or kartrutva/bhoktrutva in jnAni and so-on etc

The approach you have taken to express this underlying position of yours
quoting Sruti / bhAshya refs, has resulted in many responses/comments from
all members on this thread.. this is just my view..
