Sri Venkatesh Murthy Ji,

Sorry for butting in. Could not help clarifying as it has bearing on all
your consequential understanding. Gold and ornament example is an
illustration for pariNAma vikAra. Both enjoy the same level of Reality (
vyavaharika satya ). Rope and rope- serpent is an example for vivarta
vikAra. The two enjoy different levels of Reality (rope is vyavaharika
satya while rope-serpent is pratibhasika satya ). Brahman and Gold  example
is an illustration for vivarta vikAra. The two enjoy different levels of
Reality ( Brahman is pAramArthika satya while gold is vyAvahArika satya )

Once again sorry for the interruption.

Pranams and Regards
