Namaste Sri Bhaskar ji,

I have separately mailed you a transliteration of the section from MAndUkya
and BhAshya that explicitly refers to prapaNcha upashamam.

Please clarify how you interpret prapaNcha upashamam of the kArika and
AchArya's explanation of that term as "jAgratAdisthAna dharma abhAva" as
anything but the negation of prapaNcha?

I'm working on the assumption that you accept all shruti as pramANa and
accept kArika as a valid interpretation of mAndUkya upanishad. If that's
not the case, please clarify your position.

Regards,
Venkatraghavan
