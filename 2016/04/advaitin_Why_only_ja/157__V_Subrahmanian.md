Atmaikatva is impossible to arrive at without applying the neti neti
process which is the other way of saying the jagat is mithya. Shankara's
commentary to the last verse of the BG 13th ch. gives both these in one
shot. The word 'abhaava gamanam' there to show the mithyatva of the
kshetram is noteworthy. There are other sentences from the bhashya to show
that the jnani has mithya bheda darshanam.
