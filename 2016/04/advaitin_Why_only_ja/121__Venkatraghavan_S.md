Namaste Sri Aurobind,

Agreed. Everything is Brahman - however there is a difference between the
experience of a jnAni and his understanding. He experiences the world just
like an ajnAni, but he knows that what he is experiencing, the experience
and himself as the experiencer, are the same Brahman.

What is being said here is that his experience of the world as "idam jagat"
has two components - the "idam", which is satya Brahman and "jagat", which
is mithyA adhyAsa. Similarly his "aham" comprises of two components - satya
Brahman and mithyA ahamkAra. He knows that the Brahman component of aham is
the same as the idam component of jagat. So he can easily say "mayyeva
sakalam jatam, mayi sarvam prathishthitam, mayi sarvam layam yAti,
tadbrahmAdvayamasmyaham"

The ajnAni sees this not as comprising of two parts, but as  one "idam
jagat", which is different from his ahamkAra.

Seeing jagat as just jagat is mithyA, just like viewing aham as a limited
ahamkAra is mithyA. These are just two different names and forms given to
Brahman.

I am wondering if we should request Bhaskarji to post his final comments on
this topic so that we can move on to discuss other things. If people want
to respond to this mail or have more to say, then I am being presumptuous
and of course please carry-on.

Regards
Venkatraghavan
