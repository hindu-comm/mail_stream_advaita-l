I am not really sure if by this Sri Bhaskar Ji is referring to his
understanding of the sloka "brahma satyaM jaganmithyA" is the same as that
 that advanced by Mattur scholars or not. But I do believe that it is
liable to be understood as such by many of the members here.



My family is associated very closely with Mattoor scholars for well over a
century.On my recent visit to Shimoga ( Mattur is on its outskirts ) last
weekend, I spoke to Sri Aswathanarayana Avadhanigalu, a very learned
scholar there and whose views can be considered as representative of the
entire Scholar community there, over phone personally to clarify my doubts
in this regard. I very briefly mentioned to him about the topic of the
discussion here ( without mentioning any names except mine ) and requested
for his clarification on the following specific points.



1. Is the sloka beginning  "brahma satyaM jaganmithyA" a work of Sri
Bhagavatpada



2. If not does it reflect correctly the standpoint of Sri Bhagavatpada as
broughtout in his prasthAna traya Bhashya.



3. Is it correct to contend that  “brahma satyaM jagat satya” reflects the
standpoint  of Sri Bhavatpada as broughtout in his prasthAna traya
Bhashya.



The following was his response. I quote him here.



Quote



<< 1. Apart from the prasthAna traya Bhashya, we recognize only Upadesa
Sahasri as the work of Sri Bhagavatpada. However we do  impartially analyze
also the other works attributed to Sri Bhagavatpada by others and offer our
views as to whether they are in conformity with his standpoint as brought
out in the prasthAna traya Bhashya or not.



2. The sloka beginning with "brahma satyaM jaganmithyA"  is to be found in
the work Vedanta Dindima which is not written by Sri Bhagavatpada. However
it reflects absolutely correctly the standpoint of Sri Bhagavatpada as
brought out in the prasthAna traya Bhashya.



3.  “brahma satyaM jagat satya” does not reflect correctly the standpoint
of Sri Bhagavatpada as brought out in the prasthAna traya Bhashya. Brahman
is satya as the kAraNa for jagat , but since jagat is vivarta in Brahman it
is not satya but mithya only. >>

While I am not authorized to state this as the stand of the Mattur
Scholars, I vouchsafe for its authenticity since I have got the views
personally from Sri Aswathanarayana Avadhanigalu just last Saturday ( day
before yesterday ). This can certainly be considered as their
understanding. If anyone wants to crosscheck with Sri Avadhanigalu, please
feel free to quote me without any reservations.



I reiterate once again that I am not claiming that Sri Bhaskar Ji has
indeed stated his stand on this specific issue to be in accordance with
that of the Mattur scholars, but I felt that such a misunderstanding is
very likely in view of his observation quoted at the beginning of this post
and hence sought for the clarification directly from Sri Avadhanigalu  to
remove any lingering doubts.
