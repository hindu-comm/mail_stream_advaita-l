Namaste Bhaskarji,

Thanks for noticing my mail(s) written to someone else and also choosing to
reply to the same though not to the ones written directly to you, where we
went in repeated loops. :)

Sure you can have your opinion, just as I can have mine. :) I have no zeal
to prove anything, I just follow what is already proven. Moreover, there
cannot be any proof to anyone who does not have the same, or even a
definition for a word he uses. If two parties discuss that one thing is or
is not X, that X has to be defined and agreed between two parties. Else I
will be saying that jagat is X, where X means A and you will be saying
jagat is not X, where X means B. This is exactly what we have been doing
thus far. :) In other words, discussion is possible on mithyA between us
only when you have a definition for mithyA, the status of which you have
been refusing to jagat. I have already given the definition I used.

If you understand that negating the satyatva of nAmarUpa means throwing
away jagat, then the answer to your question is yes. I repeat,
bAdhasAmAnAdhikaraNam.

brahmakAryatvaM is itself mithyA, where is the need to protect that!

Jagat is pratyaksha pramANita whereas brahman's nirvisheshatva,

I have no clue why you say this, as if I dispute it!
