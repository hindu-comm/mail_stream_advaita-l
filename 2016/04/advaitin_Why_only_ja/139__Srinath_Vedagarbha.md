Jiva does not misunderstands that way, but rather Jiva is the result of
misunderstanding. Essentially this take us back to the original question
(Sri.Ramanuja questions in His srIbhAshya) -- who is having avidya? jIva is
having avidya? or jIva itself is the result of avidya?

When jIvatva is BMSC and BMSC is mithya, then what else is left in BMSC for
you to say jIva is brahman?

Correct way to say is Jiva/BMSC is mithya while only chid part of former
Jiva/BMSC is Brahman. This is the essence of bhAgatyAga nyAya as applied to
tattvam asi.
