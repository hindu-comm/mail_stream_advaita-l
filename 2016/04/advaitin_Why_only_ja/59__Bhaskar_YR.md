To him the jnAni tells what you see, the jagat is nothing but a MithyA you should see the tatva of what you see and that includes you is nothing but Brahman which is Sathyam. ""

So to a ajnAni vikAra jagat is Sathyam and to a jnAni the same jagat is nirvikAri Brahman.

praNAms Sri Aurobind prabhuji
Hare Krishna

Very beautifully said prabhuji.  Yes this is what I have been uncompromisingly trying to convey to the jagat mithyatva vAdins.  The socalled jagat, before its creation (srushti) and after the pralaya (laya) will be there  in avyAkruta rUpa (kAraNa rUpa) within brahman and now in the sthiti kAla too that which is subject to idam too brahman only, clarifies shankara in Aitareya bhAshya.  And to emphasis on this point shankara elsewhere in sUtra bhAshya clariries : As even brahman as cause does exist in the past present and future, even the world of effects does exist in the past, present and future because of the fact effect is not but cause.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
