 Dears
 Jagath is mithya in the sense that it is not as
 it is with the efflux of time.It is ever changing.Whereas
 Brahman is ever as It is.It is changeless.
 Brahman only has become the Jagath .Why it
 should become Jagath is variously answered.But there is no
 Jagath and it is a mental construct says Mandukya .Why a
 mental construct is answered as due to avidhya or
 ignorance.
 Avidhya is also synonymous with
 Maya .Maya is like a veil which forbids understanding or
 colouring the understanding of the exact Truth.
 The question now is when the Jiva is Brahman
 why Jiva is not able to know that he is Brahman.Why Maya
 which is an aspect of Brahman only should act as a veil to
 delude Brahman.
 The examples like clay
 ,gold,snake,rope etc throw some light but still it is beyond
 human thought or logic.May be it is
 anirvachaniyam.R.Krishnamoorthy.
