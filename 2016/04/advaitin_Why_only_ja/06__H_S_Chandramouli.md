Sri Venkatraghavan Ji,



Pranams.



Reg  << The examples of pot/clay or ornament/gold may not exactly apply to
the world/Brahman in all respects, but that is the nature of all examples I
suppose. Their utility is limited to justifying something particular
through one aspect of the drishtAnta.>>,



The answer is a very definite NO. The pot/clay or ornament/gold
illustration applies ONLY to the modifications in sama satta (समसत्ता)
context for cause/effect (कारण कार्य). It is not applicable in vishama
satta(विषमसत्ता) context for cause/effect. The illustrations are applicable
for all worldly modifications, all the way from mAyA to any other
vyavaharika vastu. They are not applicable directly for world( any
vastu)/Brahman relationship. But it is permissible to apply the vivarta
illustration for Brahman/any other vastu at vyavaharika level (say gold or
clay) and apply the pariNAma illustration for subsequent modifications of
gold/clay ( say ornament/pot)  to arrive at the ultimate vivarta
relationship between Brahman/ornament or pot directly.



Pranams and Regards
