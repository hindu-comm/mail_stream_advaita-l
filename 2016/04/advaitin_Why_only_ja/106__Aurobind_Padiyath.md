Sri Bhaskara ji,
You are right. "this jagat what we perceive is NOT like mithyA sarpa on the
rajju and clarifies that this jagat is nothing but 'vishesha' darshana of
that kAraNa and there is no mithyA whatsoever from that kAraNa drushti."
 But not all can fathom that Vishesha Drshti. This is why in the bhAshya of
Brhadaranyaka where the explanation for "Yat SAkshat Aparoksham Brahma",
the two Drshtii viz Loukika and Paramarthika are clearly explained by
Acharya.

Regards
Aurobind
