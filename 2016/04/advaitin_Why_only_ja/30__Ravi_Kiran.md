With all the above description on vyavahAra, are you only stating the
significance of samyak jnAna (just like by saying jagat satya, you actually
meant Brahma satya) ? Or, if you are extending it to mean jnAni's vyavahAra
as satyam, can you elaborate what is this vyavahAra you are referring to,
which is not involving pramAna-pramEya, which is not samyak jnAna but
satyatvam eva ?

In samyak jnAna or bhUma drushti, is there any entity other than the
paramArtha vastu? who is doing vyavahAra? what vyavahAra is possible in
samyak jnAna?

If none, where is the question of doing or seeing anything apart from
Itself or engaging in any transaction, when there is no "other" ?

What does vyavahAra signify in such samyak jnAna which is quoted here?


And in that drushti (point of view) he is anna (food), annAda (eater of

This statement again qualifies samyak jnAna or are you indicating anything
else ?

Here again, you are signifying the mahima of samyak jnAna  alone.. is there
a jnAni apart from jnAna ?

If the intent is to signify the glory of samyak jnAna, why not make it
clear in your posts.. ?

When you say jnAni's vyavahAra is satyam, you are only stating the
importance of samyak jnAna ..is it so?



*** Please note the word jnAni's vyavahAra used in my email response
earlier is different, and as quoted from BSB,

पश्वादिभिश्चाविशेषात्।

jnAni’s vyavaHara involving pramAna-pramEya, is said to be like
pashu's activity.

In that sense, jnAni's vyavahAra involving pramAna-pramEya will not sublate
(bAdha) his brahmaikatva jnAna ..

In the phenomenal world involving transactions, a jnAni sees a laptop as a
laptop only for sending emails or
doing other online transactions .. :)

If the company decides, since everything is paramArtha satyam for a jnAni,
not getting salary is also paramArtha satyam for him,
a jnAni has to go starving or fasting :)
