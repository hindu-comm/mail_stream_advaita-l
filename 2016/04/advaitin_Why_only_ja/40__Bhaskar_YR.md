SwAtma-drshti= as seen by oneself (jnAni or ajnAni )


Ø     IMHO, jnAni’s svAtma drushti is sarvAtmakatva drushti whereas ajnAni’s svAtma drushti is bheda sahita drushti, he thinks some of the kArya-s like BMI of his as him and other kArya-s as different from him.  He thinks (due to avidyA) that he is kartru, bhOktru by identifying himself as BMI and again thinks that other kArya-s are there as separate for his upabhOga (enjoyment).  As I said earlier jnAni’s svAtma drushti is paripUrNa, aparichinna, sarvAtma drushti, ajnAni’s svAtma drushti is aparipUrNa, parichinna, asarvAtma, avidyAkalpita bheda drushti.

Para-drshti= as seen by others about what a jnAni or ajnAni will be seeing.


Ø     Depends upon individual’s saMskAra and jnana paripakvata.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
