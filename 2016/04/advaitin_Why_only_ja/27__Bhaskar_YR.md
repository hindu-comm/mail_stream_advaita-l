If this Atmaikatva jnana (as he says) is extended further to a different realm ( as in jnAni's vyavahAra he quotes - whatever he does is satyameva, his vyavahAra with this jagat  is satyameva ), I see the dilution (avidya kalpita) ...

Prabhuji, jnAni’s vyavahAra with samyak jnana is not dilution nor it is avidyA kalpita coz. jnAni’s realization of Atmaikatva jnana would fetch him the knowledge that whatever he see as kArya (nAma and rUpa) is kevala vishesha darshana of the kAraNa (brahman) and whatever he does (vyavahAra) with that vishesha darshana kArya is nothing but vishesha darshana of that Shakti.  It is because of this reason bhAshyakAra says brahmavAdi would realize the kAryakAraNa tAdAtmyalakshNa saMbandha and for him through this Atmaikatva jnana sarva vyavahAram satyatvam eva..sadAtmanA satyatvAbhyupagamAt..sarva vyavahArANAM sarva vikArANAM cha satyatvaM.  It is not his (jnAni’s) avidyA kalpita delution it is the result of his samyak darshana , sama darshitvaM.
