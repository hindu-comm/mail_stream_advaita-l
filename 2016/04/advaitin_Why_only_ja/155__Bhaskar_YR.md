IMHO super imposition happens only on things which have similar resemblance to the major level .Our amygdala is responsible for this. So one can not see a lion on a rope . May be at best its tail.

Hare Krishna

The resemblance between kArya (jagat) & kAraNa (brahman)  shankara clarifies is 'asti' i.e. both are existent.  Anyway it does not mean there are two types of existents i.e. jagat and brahma, jagat is there because of brahman and jagat astitva is because of brahman hence there is no independent existence for the jagat apart from brahman.  

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
