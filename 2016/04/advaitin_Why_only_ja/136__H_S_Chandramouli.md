Sri Srinath Vedagarbha observed



<< In the spirit of jumping from one reference to the other, I agree with
you
in calling adhyaasa "jagat" as mithya. In the same we should also call
"Jiva" as mithya as the notion of jIvahood is equally adhyAsa over the same
adhishTAnaM. Then statement would be -- brahma satya jagan mithyA jeeva
mithyA ubhyOr brahmaiva na aparaH.

Why not the same treatment to jIva is given? >>,



definition of Jiva is Brahman plus Jagat ( as mind ). Basis for this is
Pravesha Shruti. Hence though jagat is mithya, Jiva is Brahman only.
