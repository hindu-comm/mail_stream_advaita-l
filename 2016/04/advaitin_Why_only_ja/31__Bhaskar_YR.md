With all the above description on vyavahAra, are you only stating the significance of samyak jnAna (just like by saying jagat satya, you actually meant Brahma satya) ? Or, if you are extending it to mean jnAni's vyavahAra as satyam, can you elaborate what is this vyavahAra you are referring to, which is not involving pramAna-pramEya, which is not samyak jnAna but satyatvam eva ?


Ø    Please shankara bhAshya on bruhadAraNyaka (2-1-20) avivekinAM vivekinAM cha upacharitA buddhirdrushtA iti chet, na, avivekinAM mithyAbhuddhitvAt, vivekinAM cha samvyavahAramAtrAlambanArthatvAt, yathA krushNO raktascha AkAshaH, iti vivekinAmapi kadAchit krushNatA raktatA cha AkAshasya samvyavahAramAtrAlambanArthatvaM pratipadyate iti na paramArthathataH krushNO raktO va AkAshO bhavatimarhati.  His vyavahAra on the face of it matches with ajnAni, but fact remains that ajnAni does the vyavahAra through mithyAjnAna (mithyAbuddhitvAt) whereas the jnAni’s vyavahAra is samyak vyavahAra which is the result of his sarvAtma jnana.  Kindly read this bhAshya vAkya completely to understand jnAni’s vyavahAra.

In that sense, jnAni's vyavahAra involving pramAna-pramEya will not sublate (bAdha) his brahmaikatva jnAna ..

Ø   The final pramANa indeed removes the very jnAtrutvaM (knowership) of Atman says shankara in geeta bhAshya.  The otherway of saying the above sentence is there is no pramANAdi triputi vyavahAra in brahmaikatva jnana.
In the phenomenal world involving transactions, a jnAni sees a laptop as a laptop only for sending emails or
doing other online transactions .. :)

Ø   Yes, seeing the laptop as laptop, seeing the stone as stone is not avidyA drushti, seeing the stone as different from me, seeing the same stone as my stone lying at my house backyard etc. are avidyAkalpita bheda drushti (ahaMkAraM, mamakAraM).  Here stone itself is not avidyAkruta having the bheda buddhi in stone or laptop and attaching to it in a specific way  is avidyAkalpita.  An ajnAni sees the satyatva in shAstra, Acharya and upadesha having the bhedabuddhi in the vyavahAra whereas a jnAni doing the same vyavahAra without an iota of  bhedabuddhi, for him everything (the nAma rUpa and vyavahAra) sadrUpameva satyaM .  Sri SSS somewhere says in Kannada :  brahma, brahmajnAnavannu, brahmanige, Brahmana mUlakavAgiye helikoduttaane. (brahma teaching the brahma jnana to brahma through brahma ☺
Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
