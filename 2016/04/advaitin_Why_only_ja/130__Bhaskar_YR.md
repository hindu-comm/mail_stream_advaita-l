My response to him  << Dont be silly >>


Ø     Your briefing of your dialogue with Sri ANA appears to me very silly and narrow that is the reason why I said you wanted to hear the answer from him according to your understanding of this issue.  First of all, despite my clarification to you, you have wrongly assumed (though you are not sure)  that I am following Sri SSS teaching to present my understanding on this issue and taking it to the Mattur,   don’t you think it is a ridiculous attempt on your part??  And again, without even presenting the other side’s viewpoints completely, if you openly claim in the forum like :  I asked him like ‘this’ and he answered me like ‘that’ and that is the end of the story.  It appears to me it is again an utter nonsense considering the complete context of this topic under discussion.

I am not used to making frivolous and meaningless  claims as made by him, pointedout earlier by me.


Ø   For your information, it is NOT my ‘own’ frivolous and meaningless claims, it is available in shankara bhAshya, it is available in shruti, it is available in geeta and it has been observed by scholars like Prof. SKR, a renowned swamiji in Advaita saMpradAya and other research scholars.  Those references for you any way are frivolous and meaningless just because it is not in line with your prejudiced understanding of Advaita.  First you asked Prof. SKR’s reference by making the comment that there cannot  be any reference from him as if you have already mastered his works, subsequently, I have asked you to search for  a link wherein Prof. SKR himself vocally said what is ‘vedAnta maryAda’ according to Advaita, what is to be shown to jagat mithyAvadins.  For that you made a silly comment that that reference is meaningless and flimsy !!?? Don’t you think all these attempts would show others that you have already closed your book for any possible corrections??  Do you still think you are participating in this discussion meaningfully and constructively??  Anyway, it is left to you to take a call on this issue.


My purpose is served if the other members note such claims with the ridicule they deserve.


Ø     Your purpose would have been better served had you participated in this discussion with an open mind and without assuming that you are the jury to make the final judgement ☺

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
Bhaskar

PS:: Since these comments from him and counter comments by me,  are getting bit personal, I am not going to respond to Sri Chandramouli’s subsequent mails unless it is something related to the topic directly.
