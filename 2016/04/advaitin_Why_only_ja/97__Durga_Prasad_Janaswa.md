Hari Om,

Pranams.

Brahma and Jagat

One Mahatma said:

bAdhAyAM sAmAnAdhikaraNyam (बाधायां सामानाधिकरण्यम्) is necessary for a
seeker during ignorance stage. bAdhAyAM sAmAnAdhikaraNyam talks about
neti-neti,  there is no serpent but only rope etc.


When ignorance is gone,  a tattvaGYa does not need  bAdhAyAM
sAmAnAdhikaraNyam. For a tattvaGYa, sarva shabda - aikya sAmAnAdhikaraNyam
only.   The pot-space is the same as the total space. What is jewelry? Gold.
brahmaivedam sarvam.


regards
