Namaste Sri Sastry,

In addition to Sri Sadananda ji's reply, here are my 2 cents.

Acharya has answered this very question in AdhyAsa BhAshya:

न चायमस्ति नियमः — पुरोऽवस्थित एव विषये विषयान्तरमध्यसितव्यमिति ;
अप्रत्यक्षेऽपि ह्याकाशे बालाः तलमलिनतादि अध्यस्यन्ति |

There is no rule that one can superimpose things on only that vastu which
is pratyaksha - for even on an apratyaksha AkAsha, children superimpose
dirt (colour) / surface (concavity) etc.

2) The same example can be used to answer the requirement for similarity.
What similarity exists between concavity (ie form) and a formless AkAsha,
between colour and colourless AkAsha? None, but adhyAsa still happens.

Regards,
Venkatraghavan

 Namaste,
 I have a
 query on Adhisthana (substratam) of Jagat being Brahman,
 request scholars to explain please.
 1) When we say the serpent that is
 seen is only an illusion due to Avidya, we can determine
 whether the Adhisthana is a rope or a crack in the ground by
 Pratyaksha, Similarly if Brahman were an object for
 Pratyaksa then we could determine whether or not it is the
 Adhisthana for the illusory Jagat, however, Brahman is not a
 matter of Pratyaksa at all and only the Jagat is seen,
 therefore it might be not possible to say whether it's
 Adisthana is Brahman or some think else?

Ans: Yes - you are right - Hence to know that Brahman is the adhishTanam of
the jagat - Scripture alone is pramaana. or means of knowledge, since
Brahman by definition is imperceptible.For that Vedanta alone is pramaana-
where creation is discussed.

 2)  How can formless Brahman be
 Adhishthana for the illusory forms, because there must be
 resemblance between the illusion and it's Adhisthana
 when it is not possible to imagine a snake in a shell or
 silver in a rope, how can the forms of the Jagat be imagined
 in the formless Brahman

Ans: Brahman being infinite cannot have form. The formless Brahman can
appear with many forms - just as formless mind projects many forms in the
dream world that you create. Hence to know the absolute truth which cannot
be perceived nor can be deduced by logic - one has to approach a teacher
and study Vedanta - says the scriptures. - tat vijnaanaartham guruam eva
abhigachchet says Mundaka Up. tat viddhi praNipaatena pariprashnena sevaya
- says Krishna. One need to study Vedanta under a competent teacher - a
competent teacher is one who studied vedanta under another competent
teacher - all the way to the Lord.

Hari Om!
Sadananda

 After posting I recognized that Shree venkatraghavanji
 already discussed the issue - I essentially agree what he
 has stated.



 Hari Om!

 Sada
