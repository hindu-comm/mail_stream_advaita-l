*What use is it to argue thus?*


Sharing the RAMANA MAHARSHi's verses SATDARSHANAM - After reading this I do
not get any queries that is being discussed !

3. ‘The world is real.’ ‘No, it, is a mere illusory appearance.’ ‘The world
is conscious.’ ‘No.’ ‘The world is happiness.’ ‘No.’ *What use is it to
argue thus?* That State is agreeable to all, wherein, having given up the
objective outlook, one knows one’s Self and loses all notions either of
unity or duality, of oneself and the ego.


>>>>>>>>>>>>>RAMANA MAHARSHI

All religions postulate the three fundamentals, the world, the soul, and
God, but it is only the one Reality that manifests Itself as these three.
One can say, ‘The three are really three’ only so long as the ego lasts.
Therefore, to inhere in one’s own Being, where the ‘I’, or ego, is dead, is
the perfect State.

3. ‘The world is real.’ ‘No, it, is a mere illusory appearance.’ ‘The world
is conscious.’ ‘No.’ ‘The world is happiness.’ ‘No.’ *What use is it to
argue thus?* That State is agreeable to all, wherein, having given up the
objective outlook, one knows one’s Self and loses all notions either of
unity or duality, of oneself and the ego.

4. If one has form oneself, the world and God also will appear to have
form, but if one is formless, who is it that sees those forms, and how?
Without the eye can any object be seen? The seeing Self is the Eye, and
that Eye is the Eye of Infinity.

5. The body is a form composed of the five-fold sheath; therefore, all the
five sheaths are implied in the term, body. Apart from the body does the
world exist? Has anyone seen the world without the body?

6. The world is nothing more than an embodiment of the objects perceived by
the five sense-organs. Since, through these five sense-organs, a single
mind perceives the world, the world is nothing but the mind. Apart from the
mind can there be a world?

7. Although the world and knowledge thereof rise and set together it is by
knowledge alone that the world is made apparent. That Perfection wherein
the world and knowledge thereof rise and set, and which shines without
rising and setting, is alone the Reality.

8. Under whatever name and form one may worship the Absolute Reality, it is
only a means for realizing It without name and form. That alone is true
realization, wherein one knows oneself in relation to that Reality, attains
peace and realizes one’s identity with it.

9. The duality of subject and object and trinity of seer, sight, and seen
can exist only if supported by the One. If one turns inward in search of
that One Reality they fall away. Those who see this are those who see
Wisdom. They are never in doubt.
