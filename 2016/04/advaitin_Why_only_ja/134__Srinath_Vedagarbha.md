The very act of realization is a karma and very much the attribute of
jIvahood. So, at the end of enquiry the jIva realizes he is *NOT* Brahman,
otherwise such realization itself is introducing karthu-karama virOdha in
Brahman. So, to avoid this swagatha bhEda, the jIva has to realize it is
not Brahman. Hence, part of this realization jIva has to realize itself is
mithya.
