Subject: Re: [Advaita-l] [advaitin] Why only jagat is mithya and jeeva is brahman !!??

Bhaskarji’s problem with due respects to him, as I see, is getting mixed up with paaramaarthika and vyaavahaarika – of course; he refuses to acknowledge this, and keeps arguing the same thing again and again. There is no problem as long as the fundamental doctrine – brahma satyam, jagan mithyaa, aham brahma eva na aparaH – is clearly understood.

praNAms Sri Sada prabhuji
Hare Krishna

It may kindly be noted that from the vyAvahArika view point too this jagat is satya and for this satyatva the existence of pAramArthika satya is acknowledged.  And most of you prabhuji-s are saying after realization jnAni would look at the jagat as mithyA since brahman is ultimately nirvishesha, nirvikAra whereas jagat is savikAra, savishesha.  And my contention is after jnAni's realization ( ofcourse I am not a jnAni to talk on behalf of other jnAni-s :-) this jagat would appear to him in its kAraNa rUpa like how a professional goldsmith would see the 'gold' despite the existence of nAma rUpa vikAra.  For him these nAma rUpa vikAra is NOT mithyA it is satya only because what is there in front of him as kAryAkAra is nothing but kAraNa only.  And in the absence of kAraNa in kArya, kArya does not exist it is kevala avidyA kalpita.  Since jnAni (brahmavAdi) is the custodian of avidyArahita paripUrNa jnana, he would see no more kArya vikAra apart from kAraNa.  And for this jeeva and jada brahman is the mUlakAraNa and hence we should follow 'ardhakukkuti' nyAya here to say jeeva is brahman and jagat is mithya.  From the svarUpa drushti both are satya and from upAdhi /parichiinna drushti both are mithyA.  

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
