That Brahma Sathyam,Jagath Mithya and JeevohiBrahma Eva is the final Truth.

>  The final truth of the above statement has to be declared by the shruti mAta and jnAni-s like bhagavatpAda.  And what shruti says is : idaM sarvaM yadayamAtmA, brahmaivedaM vishwaM, sarvaM khalvidaM brahman, tajjalAN etc.   And bhAshyakAra says : pUrvaM avidyayA asarva Aseet punaH vidyayA avidyApanaye sarvO bhavati, tadidaM apyetarhi ya evaM veda ahaM brahmAsmeeti sa idaM sarvaM bhavati.  Here shruti / shankara does not declaring sarvaM mithyA bhavati OTOH they are declaring sarvaM Atmameva bhavati.  Main difference between two parties is this :  one party saying after jnana, jnAni become sAkshi to mithyA prapancha and realizing that he is brahman / satya whereas the external world is mithyA and am the sAkshi to this mithyA jagat.  Another party trying to convey that jnAni after the dawn of jnana realizes that he is sarvaM, this jagat too (which he perceived as asarvaM, apUrNam, abrahmaM prior to jnana ) is sarvaM, pUrNaM, brahman and AtmaikatvaM.
