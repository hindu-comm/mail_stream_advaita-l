The jiva is the one who does the enquiry. He cannot negate himself.  What
he can, however, negate is the jivatva, just like Kana negated his
Rādheyatva when he realized his Kaunteyatva. ,  At the end of the enquiry
thei jiva realizes that he is none other than Brahman.the sarvadṛk/  Jagat
is dṛṣya and therefore mithyā, like the mirage water, that even while being
seen, is realized to be mithya.

While refuting the sarvaśūnyavādin Shankara says: You can negate everything
other than yourself but not yourself  the negator-consciousness.
