Namaste Bhaskarji,

This is not a response to the subject matter of the thread nor to your
understanding vs. Pujya Swamiji's followers' understanding of the article,
but only to your usage of the phrase "SDS school of thought". Being an
antevAsI at Pujya Swamiji's gurukulam, out of respect to him, I would like
to point out that he would never like this kind of usage about his
teachings as his "school of thoughts" since he always said that he taught
traditional Vedanta. This is FYI.

PS: its not pUrNamadaM, its pUrNamadAH or pUrNamidaM.

Kind rgds,
--Praveen R. Bhat
