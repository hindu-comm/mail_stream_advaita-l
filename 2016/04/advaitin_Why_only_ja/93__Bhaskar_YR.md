praNAms  Sri Sanju Nath prabhuji
Hare Krishna

Thank you very much for sharing SDS's explanation of pUrNamadaM mantra.  I am really surprised how the followers of SDS school of thought prabhuji-s can object the stand that idaM is kAraNa only though appearing in Karya rUpa when SDS elaborately explaining the same thing by giving the examples of cotton-cloth and gold - chain etc.  Last paragraph in this write-up would sum-up what has been said about jagat satyatva.  

Thanks once again for this link.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
Bhaskar

PS:  swamiji in this article makes an important observation that there is no difference between seer and seen, no need for giving special importance to only 'seer' when both seer and seen are operating on the same stage of reality.
