This is not a good question. It is like asking which Maha Vakya is the
best. Is it Aham Brahmasmi or Tat Tvam Asi or Prajnanam Brahma or Ayam
Atma Brahma. Which one? It is a bad question. Each Maha Vakya is the
best in its way. Similarly there are many Maha Slokas in Gita. We
cannot say and should not say only one is the best. It is a wrong
approach.
