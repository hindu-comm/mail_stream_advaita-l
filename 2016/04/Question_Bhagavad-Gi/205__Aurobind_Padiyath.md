Pranams to all,
For me the most enchanting verse and which reverberates 24x7 in my mind is

न मे पार्थास्ति कर्तव्यं त्रिषु लोकेषु किञ्चन ।
नानवाप्तमवाप्तव्यं वर्त एव च कर्मणि।। 3.22।।

That statement of Krishna is unparallel in the entire Gita.
It explains the Karmasanyasa by quoting नानवाप्तमवाप्तव्यं and then the
अवस्थात्रय निरूपणम् when he says त्रिषु लोकेषु which leads to कृतकृत्य भावं
when the effect of that takes to you to make the statement न मे कर्तव्यं
अस्ति। Yet the being in that state of achievement only one can say
that वर्त एव च कर्मणि।
He explains the whole process thru one verse which is the ultimate
पुरुषार्थम्।
I know each one of us gets his own feel of guidance with various other
verses. So I asked this question so that each one of can share the inner
meaning what Gita has provided us.
Hari Om!
Aurobind
