Namaste Sri Aurobind ji,
This is a very nice topic, thanks for suggesting it. I would probably say
the slokas (a pair) that most resonate with me are:

सर्वभूतस्थमात्मानं सर्वभूतानि चात्मनि ।
ईक्षते योगयुक्तात्मा सर्वत्र समदर्शिनः ॥

यो माम् पश्यति सर्वत्र सर्वं च मयि पश्यति ।
तस्याहं न प्रणश्यामि स च मे न प्रणश्यति ॥

When viewed separately, they connote ज्ञान and भक्ति - as if they are
different paths. It's when the slokas are read together, we understand that
all paths are but the same. To add to this, we get the most exalted unity
between Jiva and Ishwara as a direct statement of जीवेश्वर ऐक्यं by Sri
Krishna himself. So have always found these verses to be very beautiful.

Regards,
Venkatraghavan
