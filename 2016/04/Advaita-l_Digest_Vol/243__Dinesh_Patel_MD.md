Wonderful discourse on
Jagat -- Mithya
Brahman - Satya

More than likely this has been expressed in common persons terms 
Or quotes from shankaracharya  
I would love to reread the definitions 
May be Sanskrit and English quotes 
More you think about more you fall in that  ununderstandable  inner spirit 
What is Brahman and Jagat 
Jnana is necessary for all
But not all are jnanis
Going thru this discourse puts you in very high transcendation 
Churning thoughts with endless understanding or more confusion
What is jagat and Mithya
What is Brahman and Satya
Finally why the world is still lacking in being true brhamin
More than any other country why the citizens who have in their genes of Brhaman still following 
Jagat 
Education at bottom up and top down in simplistic way-- may be
I am taking awSy scholarly discussion in the thread but may be
Thanks
Dinesh
