Sarmaji - PraNAms

One can also say all beings are Brahman too - as Krishna says -brahma arpaNam brahma haviH...etc The statement is, arpaNam = brahman, haviH = Brahman, etc. . 

He does not say arpaNam is part of Brahman since from pure existence point there are no parts and the equation.

All are part of Brahman becomes vishiShTa Advaita. 

Hari Om!
Sada
