Chandramouliji,

Panchangas whether they are calculated today or in yester years are always
based on observations and nothing else.
The only thing regrettable is some of the siddhantis have forgotten that we
have to refine our methods of calculation
as more accurate data comes in and continue to stick to inaccurate
calculation. The siddhantis use the value of ayanamsa
as given in some old book and refuse to recognise that its value has
changed since that book was written.

Everything old is NOT - repeat - is NOT gold.

regards,
Sarma.
