Dear Sri Shashwata Shastri,
You write : "Brahmins are the manifestation of Lord Hari himself."
Mundaka Upanishad says : brahmaivEdaM viSvam variShTham ||Chandogya Upanishad says : AtmaivEdaM sarvagm ||

What does it mean ? Please ponder over and check up whether your statement is right or wrong.

With respectful regards,Sreenivasa Murthy

Namaste,

You are a Brahmin by birth and your surname does denote your identity.
Maximum members on this forum are Brahmins as far as I saw. And a Brahmin
should be respected no matter what. That is not just my own opinion but the
scriptures insist on that part as well. I think there is nothing wrong with
it if I mention your name with honorific titles. Brahmins are the
manifestation of Lord Hari himself.
