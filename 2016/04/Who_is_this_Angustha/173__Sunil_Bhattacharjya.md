Namaste,

I think ir is 96 angulas, not angusthas. While the height of a person is 96 angula, the ShassrAra chakra is at the height of 108 angulas.

Regards,
Sunil K. Bhattacharjya

 नमस्ते,

 "Thumb" was one of the ancient measuring scales. "Palm" was
 also used. 

 So, the height of one's body was measured in terms of one's
 thumb, in general 
 (to be precise - the distance FROM the dark line in the
 middle of the thumb TO
 the origin of the thumb). 

 The त्रिषिखि
 ब्राह्मणोपनिषद् says:

 देहमानं
 स्वाङ्गुलिभिः
 षण्णवत्यङ्गुलायतम् ।
 प्राणः शरीरादधिको
 द्वादशाङ्गुलमानतः 

 The measure of one's body is 96 times of the size of one's
 own thumb. 

 Hence, अङ्गुष्ठ प्रमाण
 पुरुषः should be taken from this perspective
 rather than
 splitting the meaning from metaphysical perspective.
