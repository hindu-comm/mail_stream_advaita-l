Bhagavan Ramana was asked as to the source of this right side spiritual
heart, and He replied that other than everyone's anubhava of pointing to
the right side to assert oneself, there are  two sources. If I remember
right, one was an ayurvedic work in Malayalam, while the other was Sita
Upanishad.
