Pranams,
Have you heard the story of Ekalavya in the Mahabharath?
Everyone knows the importance of the thumb. No action will become perfect
especially in manual jobs without the thumb. Since the thumb supports all
human endeavours, you can see the role of it in all actions.
So the importance is highlighted with the most important finger in human
body.
Next time onwards whenever you use your thumb remember to think about it as
Brahman (in that form) helping in all your actions.
(Even providing space while using a keyboard.)
I'm sure that the usage was only symbolic and not what I've mentored as my
theory. The same usage one can find in other meditation methods in other
systems too.
Hari Om!
Aurobind
