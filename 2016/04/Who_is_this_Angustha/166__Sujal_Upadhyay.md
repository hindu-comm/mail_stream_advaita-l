Namaste,

I am not too qualified to answer this question as to why only thumb is
given. I will try to answer.

अङ्गुल a.ngula means 'breadth of finger' or breadth of thumb' (not sure
which one to take).

Thumb is the unit of measurement. This unit is used in texts like Yoga
YajnavAlkya, highly revered by great Yogis like T. Krishnamacharya. T
Krishnamacharya revived Yoga Yajnavalkya. Nathmuni, (a Sri Vaishnav Yogi)
came in dream of Krishnamacharya and gave him instruction about his
(Nathmuni's) lost work on Yoga. T Krishnamacharya in his work Yoga
MAkaranda has explained the position of 10 chakra-s.

Distance between various chakra-s and nADI-s are measured in angula-s:

One angula means width of finger or thumb. four angulas means four fingers
joined together. One may argue that measuring any distance via finger is a
bad choice as each one has different size (thickness) of finger depending
upon height and body weight. But as far as measuring body is concerned this
defect becomes and advantage. It is said that height of human body is 96
angulas. For example if it is said that svadhisthana chakra is four angulas
lower than manipur hcakra, then this unit is true for people of all
heights, but if we say the distance between svadhisthana and manipur is 5
inches, it may not be true for a 5 year old kid. If it is true for 5 year
old kid, it may not be true for a 7 ft high person. angulas solve this
problem as said earlier, it depends upon our own fingers.

Just shooting in the dark.

btw, in acupressure, thumb represents Head, bottom part of thumb- neck,
Index and Little fingers- hands, rest 2 are legs. Three joints in fingers
correspondingly represents three joints of hands and legs.
