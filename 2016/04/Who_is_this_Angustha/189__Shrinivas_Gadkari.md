Namaste Shri Sriram,
In your message, copied below, after detailed description of the Anahata chakrayou have made a mysterious comment:
"all these yoga rahasyas are based on bhAvanA alone"
Can you explian further? Normal meaning of the word "bhAvanA" is sentiments.
Regards,Shrinivas Gadkari
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------......In this vAyu maNDala, there is a triangle (त्रिकोण) that faces downwards. Amidst this
त्रिकोण, one gets the vision of a linga of golden hue. This linga is called बाण लिंङः.

All these yOga rahasyAs that are based on भावना  only.....
regs,
sriram
