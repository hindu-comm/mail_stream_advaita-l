नमस्ते,

///

in the Anahuta Chakra a shiva linga resides. On the top of that lingam there
is a jewel.

//

In अनाहट चक्रं , one gets the vision of 12-petaled lotus.  Amidst this lotus, there
is a hexagon (षट्कोण​ यन्त्र​). Amidst this yantra, one gets the vision of वायुमण्डलं 
and the bija mantra यं shines there.  If one meditates on the अनुस्वार​ of vAyu bIja,
one gets the vision of Ishwara called हंसः.  

In this vAyu maNDala, there is a triangle (त्रिकोण) that faces downwards. Amidst this
त्रिकोण​, one gets the vision of a linga of golden hue. This linga is called बाण लिंङः.

All these yOga rahasyAs that are based on भावना  only.  ​Ultimately, vEdAnta & 
Atma vichAra is the right path which is devoid of confusion. 

regs,
sriram
