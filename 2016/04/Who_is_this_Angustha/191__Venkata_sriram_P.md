नमस्ते,

//

Can you explian further? Normal meaning of the word "bhAvanA" is sentiments.

“भावना नाम भवितुः भावनानुकूलो भावयितुः व्यापार विशेषः” – is the व्युत्पत्ति of भावना. 

The Individual / Person who performs the action is called “भावयित”.  The Desired Result / Goal 
of an Individual is called “गम्य”.  Now, there are various means (which involves both 
mental and physical exertions) adopted by the भावयित that create a conducive environment 
to achieve the गम्य.  

The mental exertions are called शाब्दी भावना.  This is similar to a concept plan prior 
to the execution of a project.  The शाब्दी भावना involves action plan to achieve the गम्य. 
And the later viz., physical exertions are called आर्थी भावना which involves actual 
implementation phase and execution of the concept.  In simple terms, the former is 
theory and the later is putting theory into practice. 

All the वैदिक शब्दाः fall in the category of this भावना only.  The conceptualization of 
वैदिक-शब्द-समूह is the शाब्दी भावना and the यज्ञ-कर्म that takes the gross form of शाब्दी भावना 
is called आर्थी भावना.  Ultimately, both of these ie., शाब्दी and आर्थी fall under a single 
umbrella called भावना. And the sole objective of this भावना is attainment of
चित्तशुद्धीः which is the गम्य.  

Now, in तन्त्र शास्त्रः, the chakras like मूलाधार, स्वाधिष्ठान, मणिपूर, अनाहट, विशुद्ध, आज्ञा, सहस्रार ....etc.
are  भावना गम्याः.  There is a conceptual plan in the form of आर्थी भावना and 
then implementation takes place in the form of आर्थी भावना under the supervision of a गुरु. 
 Only then, the भावयित (the उपासकः) attains the गम्य (सिद्धिः).  
This भावना has been elaborately given in योगिनीहृदयं in the form of 
सकल, सकल-निष्कल, निष्कल. 

So, भावना is NOT a Sentiment as per your understanding but the 
entire gamut called साधना whose siddhi matures into चक्र दर्शनं. 

नमः परदेवतायै
श्रीराम
