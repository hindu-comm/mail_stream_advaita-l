Sri Venkatraghavanji,

Anritam cannot cancel sat,(AGREED ) but sat can give existence to anritam
(NOT IN AGREEMENT) - allowing it to as-if exist.

Sat cannot be but Sat. What appears is also Sat only. It is the adhyAsa of
Asat on Sat. So at all times what always remains is only Sat.
Regards,
Aurobind
