Dear Sada-ji,

This last line of yours is simply superb !!

9. Jnaani understands through Vedanta that the changing world is 
not really real and only apparently real but the changeless substratum 
is real and is Brahman which is not different from one's own self. 
Hence can play the drama of life as best as he can knowing very 
well it is only a drama. ajnanai takes the roles as real and does 
not know how to play properly while being on the stage - 
and thus suffers.

regs,
sriram
