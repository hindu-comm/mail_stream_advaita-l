Namaste Bhaskar ji,
I'm happy we got 3/7 :)

On 5, you said: "In your position you are attributing satyatvaM only to the
antaryAmi / adhishtAnaM of the jagat (in a way you are accepting only
nimitta kAraNam and anupravesham as antaryAmi but ignoring the
upAdAnatvaM),"

I don't think that is true sir because adhishthAnam = vivarta upAdAna
kAraNam. We are saying jagat is a kArya of Brahman and MAya. The vivarta
upAdAna kAraNam is Brahman and the pariNAmi upAdAna KAraNam is MAya. So
even in our paksha, Brahman is the upAdAna kAraNa, it just so happens to be
a vivarta upAdAna, not a pariNAmi.

 On 6 -  how to explain the appearance of manifoldness in jagat , you said:
 "Don’t you think shankara explained this already by saying :
satyatvAbhyupagamAt ...sarva vyavahArANAM sarva vikArANAM cha satyatvaM."

Yes, shankara did say here: "sarvam cha nAmarUpAdi sadatmanaiva" (all nAma
rUpa are satya, in their nature of the Self), however he also said
"vikArajAtam svatastu anritamaiva". He said "ata: sadAtmanA
sarvavyavahArANAm sarvavikArANAm cha satyatvam sattoanyatve cha
anritatvamiti" - all vyavahAra and all modifications are real in their
nature of the Real Self, and unreal (anritatvam) separate from it.

The way I interpret that statement is to say that the Brahman as the
adhishthAnam for nAma rUpa is real (adhishthAna means vivarta upAdAna
kAraNa), that nAmarUpa by themselves are unreal. In other words, it is
sadasat vilakshaNam, or mithyA.

Your question may be why do we need to talk of modification by themselves?
Can we separate modification from Brahman? Why is it important to look at
nAma rUpa, different from Brahman? Our answer to that is that if it wasn't
important, Shankara could have stopped at sadAtmanA sarvavyavahArANAm
sarvavikArANAm cha satyatvam - he needn't have added sattoanyatve cha
anritatvam. Hence, in my opinion, AchArya's addition to the end of the line
is crucial.

So in the spirit of samanvayA:

1) Brahman is nimitta kAraNam and vivarta upAdAna kAraNam of jagat.

2) nAma rUpa in their essential nature are satya, but apart from that are
anritam. We call that mithyA, and you by ignoring the anritam part and
looking only at the satyA part are calling jagat satyam.

Regards,
Venkatraghavan
