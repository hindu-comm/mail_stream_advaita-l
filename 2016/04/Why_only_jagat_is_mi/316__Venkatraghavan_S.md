Namaste Sri Praveen,

Your points are valid - seen on its own, it is confusing.  The context was
that my post was made as a response to Bhaskarji's quotation of Chandogya
Bhashya 6.3.2:

सर्वं च नामरूपादि सदात्मनैव सत्यं विकारजातम्, स्वतस्त्वनृतमेव, ‘वाचारम्भणं
विकारो नामधेयम्’ (छा. उ. ६-१-४) इत्युक्तत्वात् । तथा जीवोऽपीति ।
यक्षानुरूपो हि बलिरिति न्यायप्रसिद्धिः । अतः सदात्मना सर्वव्यवहाराणां
सर्वविकाराणां च सत्यत्वं सतोऽन्यत्वे च अनृतत्वमिति न कश्चिद्दोषः
तार्किकैरिहानुवक्तुं शक्यः, यथा इतरेतरविरुद्धद्वैतवादाः
स्वबुद्धिविकल्पमात्रा अतत्त्वनिष्ठा इति शक्यं वक्तुम् ||

I was trying to use language that was consistent with the ideas of the
Bhashya - that is nAmarUpa - in its essence as Sat - is satyam -
modifcation on its own, is unreal.  If that has inadvertently caused
confusion, I apologise.

Regards
Venkatragjavam
