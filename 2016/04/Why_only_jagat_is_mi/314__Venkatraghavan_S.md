Namaste Sri Chandramouli ji,

I was using the statement "nAma rUpa is satya as Brahman" in the bAdha
mode. After bAdha, nAma rUpa is revealed to have not existed in any period
of time in the locus of its appearance, viz., Brahman. However, it
continues to appear even after bAdha.

By svarUpa of pot, I mean it's essence. Every aspect of the appearance of
the pot adhyAsa, is anritam, with Brahman as the real entity "supporting"
the pot. I do not know the technical meaning of svarUpa.

If I'm mixing up reference points, I apologise.

Regards,
Venkatraghavan
