Agreed - Here nAma rUpa is satya only as Brahman, viewed separate/distinct/different from it, it is anrita.

So when looking at a pot, if we say "that I am", then we are saying that the svarUpa of the pot is Brahman, and that I am. When looking at a pot, and saying there is a pot, that is mithyA. There is no pot apart from Brahman, viewing it as different is giving it an independent existence and such an entity is mithyA.

More agreements :-)  what you said is absolutely right prabhuji.  Since brahman is the upAdAna kAraNa for this jagat, the question asked by shaunaka to Angirasa make sense, he asks here : kasminnu bhagavO vijnAte sarvamidaM vijnAtaM bhavati??  For this Angirasa's answer is : yathA pruthivyAM OshadhayaH saMbhavanti, tathAksharAt saMbhavateeha vishwaM.  Here shaunaka asking about brahman but Angirasa pointing his finger at vishvaM !!? surprising, is it not??  If the jagat is mithyA, can any one show the vishvaM to explain the brahman??  Can the mithyA jagat fetch us the knowledge of satya brahman??  No, it is not like that.  Since jagat does not have any independent existence apart from brahman and brahman is the abhinna nimittOpadAna kAraNam of this jagat, the answer given my Angirasa would do the samanvaya between kArya-kAraNa ananyatvaM.  For explaining the kAraNa, kArya will be shown.  Because the kArya is nothing but kAraNa in its rUpa.  In the example, if someone asks :  tell me about gold (brahman), the jewller points his finger at 'ornaments' (jagat) and says know the gold (kAraNa) in kArya (ornaments) you will come to know the kAraNa in all kArya-s.  This is possible only and only when gold is the upAdAna for the ornaments.  Likewise, brahman is the upAdAna for the jagat and when you know the upAdAna you would know that jagat does not exist apart from upAdAna and this upAdAna is mrutsAmAnya in all the pots, pitchers, jugs etc.  and by knowing the upAdAna kAraNa of one kArya the all kArya-s can be known because in all kArya-s what is upAdAna is one and only i.e. brahman.
