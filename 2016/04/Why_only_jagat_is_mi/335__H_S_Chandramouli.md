Those of the members who would like to know clearly about pariNAma and
vivarta vikAra, here is a link to the latest talk by Sri Paramarthanada
delivered ten days back on Vichara Sagara. It is selfcontained and
comprehensive as far as the subject of vikAra is concerned and does not
need any crossreferencing to any of the earlier talks. He also explains how
jagat is mithya even though it exists ( vyavaharika satya )  either in
manifest or unmanifest form in all three periods of time.
