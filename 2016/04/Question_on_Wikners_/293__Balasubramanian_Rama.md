Dear all,

I am trying to understand how the Wikners pre-processor and style file
work. I am quite adept with LaTeX, but not very knowledgeable about writing
style files or metafont. If you are willing to answer some dumb questions,
please contact me offline. I am trying to adapt it for producing high
quality yajur texts, but I need to modify certain things.

Thanks!

Rama
