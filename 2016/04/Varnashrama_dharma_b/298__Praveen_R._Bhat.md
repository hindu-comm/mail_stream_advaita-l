Namaste Santoshji,

Isn't the word used there हंसः for the social class? If so, that is not the
same as चतुर्वर्ण। One who knows "सः अहम्" is हंसः। Then it would mean that
in satyayuga, people of all varNas follow svadharma and because of that, as
per the Gita, स्वकर्मणा तम् अभ्यर्च्य सिद्धिं विन्दति मानवः।  (Of course,
क्रमेण)।

This may be one way to reconcile both.
