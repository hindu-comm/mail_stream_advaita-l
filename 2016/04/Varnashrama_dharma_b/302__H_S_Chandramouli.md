Sri Santosh Rao Ji,






Reg your observation  << in bhagavata purana 11:17:10 Krishna tells uddhava
that



 in satya yuga, only



one social class was present. He says further that it wasn't until treta



yuga that the 4 varnas emanated from the purusha. Is it then correct to say



that varnashrama dharma begins only from treta yuga onwards? How exactly is



this to be understood?  >>,




My understanding based on the Gita Press Gorakhpur edition is that the
above


statement cited by you is applicable only to the first Satya and Treta
Yugas of


 the present Kalpa and not to the subsequent Yugas ( all including Satya and


 Treta Yugas ) of the Kalpa. It could be considered as an elaboration  of
the


 Order of Creation at the beginning of any Kalpa in a little more detail
than the


 crisp statements made elsewhere including the Shrutis. It should not be


 considered as a contradiction between this Purana and Purusa Sukta for


 example.





Regards
