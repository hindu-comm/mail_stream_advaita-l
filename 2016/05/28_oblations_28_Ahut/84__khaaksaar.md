Dear Shri Durga Prasad Janaswamy-ji and other Gunnijans, Pranaams!

I am looking for some contact information of Sri Yann Le Boucher, the
French Yoga teacher who studied with Sri Devarao Kulkarni-ji during 1977,
1998 and 1999, i believe. It is quite likely that he may have some
unpublished writings of Sri Devarao Kulkarni-ji.

If any members of the list have any information about Sri Yann Le Boucher
or point me in this direction, it will be greatly appreciated.

I am also looking for pdf versions of Sri Devarao Kulkarni-ji's following
books:
1. Guidelines to Shankara Vedanta
2. Avasthatraya Viveka
3. Prospects of  Teaching Genuine Vedanta
Thank you so much in advance for your time and consideration.

In Shri Hari Smriti,

satinder
