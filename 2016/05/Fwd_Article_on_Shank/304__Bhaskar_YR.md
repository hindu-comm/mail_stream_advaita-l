praNAms Sri Ramachandra prabhuji
Hare Krishna

Thanks for giving this link / sharing the article.  Here the author just echoed the principles  with regard to jagat advocated by Sri Shankara bhagavatpAda in his prasthAna traya bhAshya, what Sri SSS conveyed in his 'svatantra lekhana', what prof. SKR said in his discourse about vedAnta maryAda.  Another very renowned swamiji in Advaita saMpradAya ( definitely not in the lineage of Sri SSS) clearly declared jagan mithyatva is kevala 'kalpana pramAda' from the later Advaita writers and  it is really very difficult to find a solid reference to jagan mithyatva in shankara's Advaita vedAnta.  Anyway I could foresee the brickbats aimed towards this poor author from the Advaita vedAnta vida-s,  for whom this perspective is not palatable :-)  

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
Bhaskar

Namaste,

Please find the below link for an article in Kannada by Prof M A Hedge on account of Shankara Jayanthi.
The author's statements on Jagat Mithyatva is interesting to be noted for the members..

Refer to yesterday's edition Page - 9
