The gist of that article in the given link is that everything in jagat satya only not mithyA nor asat as this jagat is nothing but brahman.  It is only some false propaganda that some people trying to advocate and claim  that shankara is calling jagat mithyA without understanding what is mithyA in the perceived jagat.  Kindly note this is not actual translation of the Kannada article but shortly it is conveying the message like this.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
