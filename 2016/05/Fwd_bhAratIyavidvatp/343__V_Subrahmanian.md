A Shānkara Bhāṣya Pārāyaṇa Sattram, an annual feature, was held from May 14

During the evenings there were lectures on the theme of Mandukya Upanishad
with the four-part kārikās.  Eminent scholars -  MM Swaminathan Sharma, Sri
Mani Dravid Sastrinaḥ, and Sri  M.L.Narasimhamurthy discoursed on the four
