If I remember right, you had said something about the significance  and background of it.  Would you please share with me once again prabhuji.  Due to poor memory, I have forgotten it completely.  

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!

Subject: [Advaita-l] JAGAT MITHYATVAM IN ADVAITA - A CONCLUSION - part -1

Namaste,

All these hair-splitting discussions have been summed by शंकर भगवत्पादः in His bhASya to the 1st name of विष्णुसहस्रनामं vide the name "विश्वं".

The commentary to the first name itself is mind-blowing. 

With regards,
Sriram
