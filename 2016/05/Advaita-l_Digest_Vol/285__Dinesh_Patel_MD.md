Hi all
This nay be distraction but if so forgive and forget
I was reading Geeta the other day 
My 9 year curious grandson asked me if I can tell him what am I am so engrossed 
I started talking to him about lord krishna and Arjun and discourse 
Righteousness etc
Wonder if there are any books for young kids to explain Geeta etc
Thanks
D
