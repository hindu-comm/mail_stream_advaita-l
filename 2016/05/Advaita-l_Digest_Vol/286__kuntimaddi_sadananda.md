 Hi all
 This nay be distraction but if so forgive and forget
 I was reading Geeta the other day 
 My 9 year curious grandson asked me if I can tell him what
 am I am so engrossed 
 I started talking to him about lord krishna and Arjun and
 discourse 
 Righteousness etc
 Wonder if there are any books for young kids to explain
 Geeta etc
