Namaste Sri Subrahmanian ji,
I agree with you. It's a well articulated note.
However, it's not clear to me on point 2 if the author is saying that
Shankara does not use the rope snake example to explain the world. He
explicitly says Shruti does not.
If he does imply that Shankara does not use rope snake, it would be helpful
if he clarifies if he is saying that Shankara explicitly says somewhere
that the rope snake is inapplicable to explain the world, or if he means
that Shankara does not use it anywhere.

Because in BGB 13.16, after talking about सृष्टि-स्थिति-लय  of the world,
Shankara  does say - यथा रज्जवादि: सर्पादेः मिथ्याकल्पितस्य ।

Regards,
Venkatraghavan
