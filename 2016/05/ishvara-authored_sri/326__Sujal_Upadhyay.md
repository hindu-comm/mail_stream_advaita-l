Namaste Śrī Subramanian jī,

Śrī Vidyārāṇya Svāmī in Panchadaśī says that after attaining Jṇāna
sāṁsāra does not disappear. This is because ajṇāna is opposite of jṇāna,
mithyā is not opposite of jṇāna and hence it does not get negated even
after attaining jṇāna.

It is also true that in all examples, vachyārtha may be of dual nature, but
laxyārtha is non-duality only. Or any taught to point to Brahman has to be
taken in right context. An example is tat-tvam-asi.

It is said that sharīra is a sādhana. Hence undue importance should not be
given. Sādhana should not become sādhya.

Same is the case with other things like food, which is a medicine
(auśadha) to treat a disease (roga) named hunger (bhukha).

I personally feel that for explaining SDV, snake-rope analogy is a better
example.
