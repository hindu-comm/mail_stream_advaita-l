Namaste,
I like snake-rope, as I like it's approach and ability to explain advaita.
As students, we must not keep thinking about samsāra, we must take a

"To disconnect from the self and to become Aware of anything else is
nothing but unhappiness" - Bhagawan Ramana Maharshi

He who has faith has all
He who lacks faith, lacks all
It is the faith int he name of lord that works wonders
FAITH IS LIFE, DOUBT IS DEATH - Sri Ramakrishna
