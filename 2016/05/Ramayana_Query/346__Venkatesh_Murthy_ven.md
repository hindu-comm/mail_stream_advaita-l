Namaste

When I was telling Ramayana story to children one child asked me a
question and I did not know the answer.

When Maricha was dying from Rama's arrow he shouted 'Oh Seeta Oh
Lakshmana' and died. But Rama knew he was tricking Him. Why He did not
shout back 'Oh Seeta Oh Lakshmana. I am safe. Don't worry. Don't be
fooled by this Rakshasa. I am coming now' ? Why He did not warn Seeta
and Lakshmana? If He warned them Lakshmana would not come out and
leave Seeta alone.

One answer is - He wanted to complete the Avatara Mission to kill
Ravana. But it means He wanted Seeta to get kidnapped. Why? He was
very powerful He could have killed Ravana immediately. Why He is
allowing him to kidnap Seeta?  One more answer is He is also deceived
by Maayaa just like us. Maayaa is so powerful to trick even Gods. Rama
was shocked and did not know what to do.
