Neither dvaitins are charging you do perceiving asat. Instead what they are
objecting to is that when you say asat chEt na prateeyeth while defining
mihya, you cannot deny "knowablity" to asat. This exactly is the argument
Sri.Jaya tirtha forwards -- nothing can be denied without knowing it first,
so when asat is known, then only it can be denied as something is "not
asat". So when asat is known, it only means asat chEt na prateeyeth hEtu is
a contradiction in terms.


I guess you and Sri. Subu misunderstood "pratIti" as "perception" rather
than "knowing". You both are agreeing above that you do not deny
knowability to asat vastu. Thank you for agreeing with dvaitins!

Quite simple -- while adhyastha asat is Eka dESha kAlEna abhAva, atyanta
asat is sarva kalAdEshEna abhAva. There is no difference in their
ontological state is concerned. This is unlike notion of mithya - a total
another ontological category advaita posit.

Not really.

Please note, whatever difference dvaitin posit between them, such
difference is not critical/contradictory to the definition of either of the
terms. This is the key point.
