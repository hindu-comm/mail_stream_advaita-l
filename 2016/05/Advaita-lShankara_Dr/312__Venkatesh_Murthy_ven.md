There is no proof for others existing in Waking. Can you give
guarantee proof your own family is really existing or they are only
seen by you like in a dream? There is no proof for anybody in this 7
billion people world is really there. There is one proof only. You can
say you are existing. You cannot have doubt in your own existing and
living. Therefore why are you asking how dream is different from
waking. It is not different. All you are seeing in waking and thinking
it is different from dream is not different.

Your question on Delhi is not correct. In a dream you are staying in
Delhi. In that dream only you can catch a flight to London and go to
London. In that same dream will you start thinking Delhi is not there
now because I am in London? No you will not think like that. Therefore
why do you think like that in waking? Think like in a dream.
