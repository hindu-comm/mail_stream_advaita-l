​This belief has loose foundation.
vAchaspati-mishra is accepted as nAnA-jIva-vAdI, but as in his view the
aGYAnam is jIvAshritam, so the creation is also of jIva. Hence, his view is
considered as dRRiShTi-sRRiShTi.
Some essays are available.
One scholar, who is part of BVP, is also working on this subject.​
