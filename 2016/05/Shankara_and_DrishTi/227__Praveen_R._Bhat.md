Namaste Chandramouliji,

Apologies if I'm talking out of turn, but here's my understanding--

Not the tat, but the tvam-pada...

When tat tvam asi is told by the teacher to the disciple, the latter
understands it as aham tat (jagatkAraNaM)/ brahma asmi. Here, I think what
is said is that import of the three padas can be put together directly in
the tvam pada itself, when tvam/ aham is directly understood as
mithyAjagatkAraNam. The logic is that any knowledge that brings the
understanding of one's own svarUpa clearly is mokshakAraka, be it via the
asi pada of svarUpa-equality between tat and tvam followed by
jahadajahallakSaNa or via tvam pada itself as svarUpa.
