We have explained at length again and again that it is pure being (parabrahman) along that is spoken of as a jeeva owing to connection with an upAdhi.  This being so, we talk of one particular jeeva, so long as bandha continues to one upAdhi.  But in the case of bondage continues to attach another upAdhi, the talk of another (nAnA) becomes necessary.  Shankara in sUtra bhAshyaNa cha girinadisamudrAdishu nAnAvidheshu nAma rUpeshu aneeshvarasya jeevasya vyAkaraNa sAmarthyaM asti, and it creation is not possible even to siddha purusha-s and Ishwara is the ONLY capable person to do this jagadvyApArastu nitya siddha Ishwarasya  shankara in phalAdhyAya.  Call it jeeva, Ishwara, brahma whatever you want what ultimately remains is that Chaitanya only and that is eka meva.  I don’t have anything more to add to this.  

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar

From the empirical stand point we do believe and behave as if there are actually multiple jeeva-s.  samashti antaHkaraNa, vyashti antaHkaraNa comes into picture whenever there is a talk about eka jeeva and nAnA jeeva.  And most importantly when it comes to creation, the 'eka jeeva' vAda does not pertain the jeeva's avidyA kalpita jagat.  The srushti has been explained as Ishwara hetuka, shankara nowhere says this jagat and Ishwara both a jeeva's avidyA kalpita.  We don’t have to bring the ArambhaNAdhikaraNAM to prove that Ishwara is kevala vyAvahArika satya in this context of jeeva's imagination / illusion.

Kindly read the Ramana Maharshi saying 534

Let highly mature and courageous aspirants who

have a bright and sharp intellect, firmly accept that

soul [jiva] is only one [eka] and thereby be established

deep in the heart [by enquiring ‘Who am I, that

one jiva?’]. It is only to suit immature minds that

scriptures generally say that souls [jivas] are many

[nana].

Ramana Maharshi's philosophy is same as Adi Sankara's philosophy.
There is no difference. there is only one Jeeva and that Jeeva has created Ishwara and the Universe in his imagination. Yes this Jeeva is the creator of God. He has also created other Jeevas but they are not real. They are also imagined like God and Universe. He has also imagined Guru and Scriptures. That imagined Guru will give him instruction of imagined Scriptures and he will get liberated in his imagination only. There is nothing outside that Jeeva.

> It is very simple. Adi Sankara has not rejected Eka Jeeva Vaada in the Prasthana Traya Bhashya. Therefore if you accept Eka Jeeva Vaada of only one Jeeva existing in the Universe you can see DSV is also accepted. Because that one Jeeva has imagined everything in the Universe. If you say Ishwara has created the Universe even that Ishwara is imagined by that Jeeva only. The whole Universe is existing because of that Jeeva's imagination.
