praNAms Sri Subbu prabhuji
Hare Krishna

Sri SSS, has openly agreed to the above in the three Kannada translations that I have presented in another post. His words 'husi torike', ibbaru chandraru toruvudu are proof of this.


Ø   You can draw your opinion on Sri SSS stand by selectively quoting him from the bhAshya translation  and I too understand & present  his position based on his independent article where there is no boundaries for him to express his stand/thoughts  openly.  According to me (and according to Sri SSS as per me) there are two moons for the person who has karaNa dOsha (cataract etc.) Likewise in the case of ajnAni there are two jagats, one is his own imagination another one is what is there in its kAraNa svarUpa).  One of them is illusory and another one is real.  One is avidyA kalpita another one is what shAstra says.  After the cataract operation or after getting rid of ‘kaNNu pore’ the illusion of dviteeya Chandra disappears.  Only the real Chandra is seen.  And that persons vyavahAra thenceforth with that ‘real’ Chandra only.  Likewise, after the dawn of samyaK jnana the illusory (avidyA kalpita) parichinna, aparipUrNa, asarva, abrahma jagat ceases to exist, the world which is non-different from brahman alone stays.  Now for the jnAni the socalled transaction is only with the jagat which is non-different from brahman, hence for him sarva vikArANAM, sarva vyavahArANAM sadrUpaM satyameva.  The continuation of dviteeya Chandra darshana, jnAni’s vyavahAra, the jnAni’s BMI, jnAni’s vidyA lesha, jnAni’s kAma krOdha, jnAni’s prArabdha karma etc. etc. have been accounted to meet the demands of ajnAni-s who still want to identify the jnAni with an individual BMI.

Ø   As you know we have already spent lot of energy and time discussing all these points in both the groups over a decade but in vain ☺   Kindly don’t take the trouble to discuss these things with me as we know we both are travelling parallel  and no meeting point could be seen in the near future ☺  But if you want to share your thoughts with other prabhuji-s of this list with the quotes from Sri SSS you are most welcome to do that  prabhuji.  But as far as my discussion with your goodself is concerned, it is a closed chapter and this is in the spirit to keeping a good friendly relationship with you.  Hope you understand my sentiments and co-operate ☺
Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
