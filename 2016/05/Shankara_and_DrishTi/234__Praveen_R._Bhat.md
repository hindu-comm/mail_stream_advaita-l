No, it doesn't. Apologies if my usage of vAkyajnAna led to such a
conclusion, but as I said in my last mail to Ryan ji, vAcyArtha is not
mokShakAraka, but lakShyArtha is.

Which pada is to be answered and is tvampada as_taught_in_DSV.

Those may be other words but not what I meant. As already conveyed earlier,
mahAvAkya is that statement which reveals one's true nature as non-dual
saccidAnanda, which is not restricted to tattvamasi or four well-known
ones. Each Upanishad has at least one mahAvAkya, without which there are no
Upanishads.

I don't think the student would land on DSV teaching all by himself without
guru upadesha! The guru upAdesha can be mahAvAkya lakShyArtha directly as
explained in tvam of DSV. I don't consider the final teaching of SDV and
DSV to be different.
