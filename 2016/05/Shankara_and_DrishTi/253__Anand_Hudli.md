The philosophy of Yoga Vasishtha is somewhat different from Shankara's
advaita but there are many common points as well. Ananda-bodhendra is said
to have been a disciple of Gangadharendra Sarasvati of the 19th century.
PrakAshAnanda derives his DSV/ekajIvavAda from Gaudapada, Brahmasiddhi,
Ishtasiddhi, Yoga Vasishtha, and of course Shankara's works. He accepts the
VivaraNa school's view that Brahman is the Ashraya for avidyA.

holds dream and waking states are nondifferent, is suitable for advanced
sAdhakas or even jIvanmuktas,

samyak drushti or something else.  In any case, shankara clarifies what
would be the samyak drushti of the jnAni after the realization in chAndOgya
:  prAk sadAtma vijnAnAt svAtmanOnyasmAt sataH pANAdernAmAntasya utpatti
pralayaU abhUtAm.  SADAATMA VIJNAANE TU SATI EDAANEEM SVAATMATA EVA
SAMVRUTTAU, tathA sarvOpyanyO vyavahAraH Atmana eva vidushaH.  The bhAshya
vAkya is self-explanatory.  According to shankara jnAni is nothing but
brahman and brahman is the kAraNa for the srushti-stiti-laya of the jagat,
jnAni / brahman realizes that everything (including vyavahAra) from HIM
only.  In this sense EJV holds good, since here jnAni was erstwhile 'jeeva'
only.  In this view point only shankara says svapna kartru is brahman only
hence no difference between jAgrat and svapna prapancha.

Where exactly does he say the waking world is pAramArthika? In fact,
Shankara says quite the opposite in his BhAShya on the sUtra lokavattu
lIlAkaivalyam (2.1.33). na ceyaM paramAthaviShayA sRShTishrutiH

shankara observes in 'sandhyAdhikaraNa'  that jAgrat prapancha is Ishwara
srushti and in its kAraNa rUpa pAramArthika satya  and svapna srushti is
mithya eva there is no 'smell' of pAramArthika in svapna prapancha.  As far
as my limited knowledge goes nowhere shankara categorically says this jagat
is the creation of jeeva who is endowed with avidyA / ajnAna.  I have seen
quotes on nAsatO vidyate bhAvO from geeta to prove the jagan mithyatva it
is really amusing to say the least, this verse is about mithyatva of
arjuna's shOka, mOha and cause for it is his (arjuna's) avidyA / adhyAsa.
If everything is mithyA and kalpita geetAchArya would not have said na
tvevAhaM jAtu nAsaM na tvaM neme janAdhipAH, na chaiva na bhavishyAmaH
sarve vayamataH paraM etc. And if everything is mithyA / kalpita of arjuna,
geetAchArya would not have taken the trouble  of showing his 'vishwarUpa'
and declaring yad yad vibhUti matsatyaM etc.  :-) What is kalpita (asat)
here is arjuna's shOka-mOha, rAga dvesha, sukha-duHkha, sheeta-ushNa and
the kAraNa for this is arjunA-s parichinna drushti, avidyA drushti,
aparipUrNa avidyA kalpita drushti that bheeshma drONAdi-s are his kith and
kin and attachement to them & his wrong perception that killing them would
bring him the sorrow.  Those who quote this verse in support of jagan
mithyatva should atleast understand that this verse is not there to prove
that battle field of kurukshetra, geetAchArya Krishna, geetOpadesha,
vishwarUpa of Ishwara are all figment of imagination of avidyAvanta Arjuna
(jeeva).

> Hari Hari Hari Bol!!

If you take the view of DSV/ekajIvavAda, the entire Gita upadesha is for
the draShTA, the person who studies it for liberation. He/she does not have
to worry if Arjuna imagined everything in his mind, etc. Arjuna himself is
imagined by the draShTA. The same anology of a dream tiger waking you
up, i.e. liberating you, can be applied.
