Thanks for highlighting the ‘you’ and ‘not me’ in your statement, atleast from this can I understand what is heena in *my* imaginative world is adhyArOpita in *your*imaginative world and what is jeeva in my imaginative world is parabrahman in *your* imaginative world and at the same time both are sarvajnA-s for creating their own imaginative worlds ☺  could you see the absurdity in this stand of eka jeeva vAda??

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar

No, I am saying the hInatva adjective you add to jeeva is also your adhyAropa, not mine. So if you think I am belittling vedA by making a hIna jIva perform apparent srishti, that is because *you* are superimposing hInatva, *not me*.

In reality I hold no creation to have happened. However, even in avidyA dasha, when we talk of apparent creation, hInatva of the jIva is only an imagination, not fact.

Sri Bhaskar,

Without giving any importance to bhAshyakAra's verdict,  if we say this jagat is parichinna, avidyA paripUrNa, heena jeeva's imagination, we are undoubtedly insulting & belittling the vedAnta maryAda.

Sorry, I don't consider the jIva to be heena at all. He is sAkshAt Brahman.
