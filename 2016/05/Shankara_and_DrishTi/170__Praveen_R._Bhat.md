Namaste,

> That there is no creation is not in tune with what the sruthi says.In
Vishnu Sahasranamam the first word is Visvam.It means Brahman or the
Supreme being.Its root visati means enter or interpenetrate.Taitreya
Upanishad
> 2-6 readsTat srushtvaTad eva anupravisat-meaning Having projected the
universe He entered into it.Again Yat prayaanty abhisamvisanti Taitreya 3-1
-that unto which all beings enter at the time of dissolution.Thus Brahman
Enters  into its effect and the universe enters or dissolves in Him.
> Thus the eka Jiiva vada is not agreeing with the sruthi vakyas.Again
Vishnu means pervading every thing.So there is creation and it is created
by Him.
> He just desired say the sruthi further to project the universe.So there
is no creation is not just correct.It is not agreeing with the sruthi
