 No, they consider 3 levels of reality (paramArthika, vyAvahArika,
prAtibhAsika) - and hence consider DSV as untenable.

This is what Martha Doherty says in her paper whose reference was provided:

"PrakAsAnanda (1550â€“ 1600), an Advaita AcArya, propounds this view
predominantly, and other AcAryas advance it on occasion when the context is
purely paramArthika. Indeed, from the paramArthika standpoint, there is
no avidya  at all. Such a view, however, does not account for the empirical
reality (vyavaharika-satta ), which is why Sankara argues against it, and
in favor of a view that does (srsti-drsti).  Sankara holds that the world
is not a creation of the observer (drsti-srsti), but rather, is seen
because it is there (srsti-drsti)."
The point is that the waking state cannot be held to be any more real than
the dream state.

Regards,
Venkatraghavan
