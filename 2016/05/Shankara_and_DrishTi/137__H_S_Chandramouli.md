Namaste Sri Venkatraghavan Ji,
>>
>>
>>
>> My observation that jiva creates prAjna also stems from the citation by
>> Sri Anand Ji copied here
>>
>>
>>
>> << However, the prominent among
>> them is the one put forth by PrakAshAnanda in his
>> vedAntasiddhAntamuktAvalI. According to this view, the
>> nityashuddhamuktasvabhAva Brahman, in association with ajnAna, attains the
>> state of jIva (ajnAnamAshritya jIvabhAvaM labdhvA), and creates (imagines)
>> the bodies of Gods, animals, humans, etc. and also creates the entire
>> universe with the fourteen worlds (brahmANDAdicaturdahsabhuvanaM sRShTvA).
>> Among those bodies, one is a God, one a human, one Hiranyagarbha the
>> Creator of all (teShu teShu deheShu kashcit devaH kashcit manuShyaH
>> kashcit
>> hiraNyagarbhaH sarveShAM sraShTA). One is Vishnu the Protector and one is
>> Rudra the Destroyer of all during Pralaya (kashcit VishNuH pAlakaH kashcit
>> anyaH sarvasaMhArakartA rudraH pralaye).>>.
>>
>>
>>
>> Also  << Thus, the jIva, although Ishvara (Brahman) himself
>> becomes deluded in the waking state (Ishvaro .api san bhrAnto bhavati
>> jAgare).>>
>>
>>
>>
>> I have no doubt added the word prAjna on my own since equivalent terms
>> God, Hiranyagarbha, Vishnu,Rudra, Iswara  are all covered in the above
>> quote. There is no other source I have relied upon.
>>
>>
>>
>> Including this definition, we have three versions for the eka-jIva-vAda in
>> this thread. I only wanted to know if any or all of these are consistent
>> with the Bhashya or not  It was just for my own information only. Not with
>> any view to enter into a debate. If I can find an answer here , fine.
>> Otherwise no problem. Please ignore the question
