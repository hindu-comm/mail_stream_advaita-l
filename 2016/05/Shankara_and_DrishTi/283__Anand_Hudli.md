I am unable to understand how sUtra bhAShya 1.4.8,9 is referring to EJV vs
NJV. As far as I understand, this bhAShya is refuting the Samkhya position
that the word "ajA" (she-goat) in the shruti stands for pradhAna. The
shAnkara bhAShya makes it clear that the word means
"tejobannAtmaka-prakRti", i.e. prakRti consisting of fire, water, and food.
One might be nitpicky and object that PrakAshAnanda takes the word
lohitashuklakRShNAm as referring to prakRti consisting of the three
guNas, rajas, sattva, and tamas, while Shankara BhagavatpAda takes it to be
fire, water, and food, but I have seen other commentators in shankara's
line (and the gItA itself) take the same approach as prakAshAnanda. It is
not a serious deviation from shAnkara bhAShya.
