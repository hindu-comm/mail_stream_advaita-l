No worries, that happens to most of us in a non-realtime communication. :)

In the ChAndogya, the section beginning with सदेव सोम्येदमग्र आसीत् (Ch. 6.

That may well be seen this way, although it seems to me more of an

... I'm afraid you may be mixing up things if you make this above statement
to mean as a choice "between अन्वय co-presence and व्यतिरेक co-absence"
instead of "between SDV and DSV". If not, ignore the rest of this
paragraph. Both are needed in both DSV and SDV to find out what is seen to
exist together and what isn't. Or in other words, what comes and goes and
what remains. The त्रिकालाभादितसत् ever-existing reality is what is arrived
at which is आत्मा one's own self.

Between an inclination to SDV or DSV, yes. This inclination may change as
one is exposed to more prakriyAs and traditional works!

The first part of your sentence is precisely what I am saying. However, it
is any prakriyA is to be taken as a fact, though not the ultimate truth,
for it to work well, because the solution and the problem work at the same
level of reality. That is, in the case of SDV, a vyavahArika fact and in
the case of SDV, prAtibhAsika fact=vyavahArika fact, so to say.
