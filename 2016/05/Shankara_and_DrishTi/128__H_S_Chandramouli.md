Sri Venkatraghavan Ji and Sri Anand Ji,


Pranams.



I quote from the first post by Sri Anand Ji



Quote ( from  The sidhhAntaleshasaMgraha of appayya dIkshita  )



 << Who creates this
entire world? Is it the Atman without upAdhis? Or is it the Atman with
upAdhis? To this objection, one reply is as follows. It is the Atman with
avidyA upAdhi who creates the next avidyA. The Atman with the resultant
avidyA upAdhi creates the next avidyA and so on
(pUrvapUrvakalpitAvidyopahita uttarottarAvidyAkalpakaH). Since there is no
specified beginning for this process (similar to the seed-sprout process),
there is no anavasthA defect (the created avidyA requires Atman with avidyA
and hence mutual dependence). As can be seen here, the entire world
creation is similar to a dream, created by Atman with avidyopAdhi. >>.

 I now quote from the latest post by Sri Venkatraghavan Ji.



Quote ( from Madhusudana Sarasvati in Siddhanta Bindu )



<< Pure consciousness (the original) with avidyA upAdhi is Ishvara  >>.



Unquote.



Putting the two together it appears that Iswara is the Creator and not
Jiva.



But such a conclusion contradicts the following quote taken from Sri Anand
Jiâ€™s later post.



Quote (from Sidhanta Bindu )   << In this theory, the jIva itself is the
material and
efficient cause of the world, due to its own ignorance.>>



Unquote.



Clearly there is a difference of opinion between Sri Appayya Dikshita and
Sri Madhusudhana Saraswati.I think clarification is called for.



Pranams and Regards
