Sri Praveen Ji,



Namaste.



Three versions have been furnished for the Creator and Jiva in respect
of ekajIvavAda.



For the first one cited from sidhhAntaleshasaMgraha of appayya dIkshita
author is not



given. Second one is by Sri MadhusUdana Sarasvati in siddhAnta bindu. Third
one is by



 Sri PrakAshAnanda in his vedAntasiddhAntamuktAvalI. In all three Creator
himself



 appears as the Jiva also and gets “liberated”. This particular concept I
have not been



able to identify in any of  the 10 upanishads we normally refer to. Since
it is accepted



that “liberation” is possible ONLY through shravana of the Upanishads and
upadEsha of



mahAvAkya by the guru, can you please clarify which of the Upanishads are
takenup for



shravana in respect of each of these concepts and the corresponding
mahAvAkya.



Also is DSV always identified with ekajIvavAda or is it also explained as
applicable to



nAnAjIva vAda?





I would be grateful for a clarification.





Pranams and Regards
