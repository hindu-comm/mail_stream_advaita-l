My reply was in the context of the point of contention made by you earlier,
which was that the logic is used here is like other darShanas, that is
without Shruti-basis, whereas I said that it is Shruti-based logic since
Shruti uses this लिङ्ग among the six. It is a different matter whether the
author of the work chose to use only one or few of the Shruti- लिङ्गs to
explain a प्रक्रिया. And that by itself need not take away the fact that it
is based on Shruti.
