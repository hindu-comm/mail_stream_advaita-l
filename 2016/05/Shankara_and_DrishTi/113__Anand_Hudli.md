>Since no second conscious principle does exist whwere is the question of
EkajIva or nAnAjIva?

Assuming someone has to realize this only conscious principle that you talk
about, we have to admit that there is a jIva. If Brahman is already
realized all these theories of dRShTisRShTivAda, sRShTidRShTivAda,
ekajIvavAda, nAnAjIvavAda, etc. are not required, nay a study of Vedanta
itself is not required.
