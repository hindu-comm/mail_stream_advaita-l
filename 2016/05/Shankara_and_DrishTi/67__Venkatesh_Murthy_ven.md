Namaste

It is very simple. Adi Sankara has not rejected Eka Jeeva Vaada in the
Prasthana Traya Bhashya. Therefore if you accept Eka Jeeva Vaada of
only one Jeeva existing in the Universe you can see DSV is also
accepted. Because that one Jeeva has imagined everything in the
Universe. If you say Ishwara has created the Universe even that
Ishwara is imagined by that Jeeva only. The whole Universe is existing
because of that Jeeva's imagination.
