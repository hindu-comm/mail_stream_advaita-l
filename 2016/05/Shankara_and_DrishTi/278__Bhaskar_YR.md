What happens in a DSV/EJV type of upadesha is this. The "tat" pada is not upahita Brahman but anupahita Brahman, the shuddha caitanya Itself. The jahadajahallakShaNa method is applied only to the "tvam" pada and the inquirer (sAdhaka) is told "you yourself are the creator of all this, having created all this as in a dream". However, your real nature is shuddha caitanya - tat tvam asi

Apart from shankara in sUtra bhAshya, upadesha sAhasri and naishkarmya siddhi too elaborates this mahAvyAkya.  tvaM satOH tulyaneedatvAt, neelaashvavat idaM bhavet, nirdukhavAchinA yOgAt, tvaM shabdasya tadarthathA, prtyagAtmAbhidhAnena tat shabdasya yutesthathA, dashamaH tvamaseetyevaM ikyaMsyAt pratyagAtmani is the declaration.  A rough translation of this would be the word tat which denotes sadvastu and the word tvaM which denotes the svarUpa of jignAsu have appeared in a single sentence to convey the common tattva.  samAnAdhikAraNya.  Here tvaM is tat only not the duhkhi saMsAri jeeva hence it is said tvaM tadasi.  IOW, here the meaning of tvaM is tat (sUtra bhAshya 4-1-2 relevant here).  nelAshva, tenth man examples given here. And sureshwara's NS also talks in the same term I reckon.  Under these circumstances, I donot know how jeeva srushti entered here to deny the Ishwaratva of brahman.  Here what needs to be denied is jeeva's (jignAsu's) duHkha saMsAritvaM not the jagat perse as exaplained above.  Anyway, this is my opinion as per shankara's works and prakaraNa like US and NS.
