Namaste Sri Bhaskar,

Shankara didn't mention either of these terms explicitly. However my view
is that there are several sections of the kArika, bhAshya, etc. which seem
to argue from a DSV standpoint. There are others which argue from a SDV
standpoint. He doesn't definitely state his preference for one over the
other.

Therefore it is incorrect for some people to say he rejected DSV and
preferred SDV, or vice versa - that's the only point that I am making.

This is similar to Shankara's treatment of AbhAsa vs avaccheda vAda. In
different parts of his bhAshyas he seems to argue taking different
standpoints.

Ultimately all these are just prakriyAs, and whatever is suitable for the
student should be adopted - the difference in prakriyAs doesn't imply a
difference in siddhAnta

Regards
Venkatraghavan
