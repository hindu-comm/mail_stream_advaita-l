True, but even before one realizes, the %age of topics covered by Shruti,
etc, have nothing to do with their importance in determining the purpose/
tAtparya. Else karmakANDa would overshadow Upanishads by a huge multiple!
Each of the Shruti topics has adhikAribheda, be it karmakANDa or jnAnakANDa
and for the same reason, there are more works by the tradition following
Bhagavatpada. They cater to people with questions that others either don't
face and therefore don't need to, or haven't reached in their manana yet
and therefore don't need at that stage.
