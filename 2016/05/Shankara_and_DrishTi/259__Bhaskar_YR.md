praNAms Sri Ananda Hudli prabhuji
Hare Krishna

Frankly speaking, I am getting more and more surprised after reading prakaraNa grantha's declarations like below : 

There is no doubt upadesha by the Guru is required. It is only a matter of emphasis as to what the emphasized pada among "tat tvam asi" is. If one subscribes to the DSV/EJV, then the emphasis is on "tvam", not so much on "tat", because the inquirer is the one who is the creator of this "prAtItikI sRShTi", the jagatkartA paramAtmA as VidyAraNya says in the anubhUti prakAsha (quoted earlier). In that sense, understanding the "tvam"
pada becomes important and is said to be a shortcut, instead of trying to understand the concepts of Ishvara, Hiranyagarbha, multiple avidyAs, jIvas, etc. and the process of creation as described in sRShTi-dRShTi-vAda. 

>  IMHO, splitting the one of the mahAvAkya-s tattvamasi and deciding which word out of three words  is important and which is unimportant for the DSV/EJV is really news to me.  If there is no importance to the word 'tat' in the upanishat vAkya at the first place how can 'tvam' realize that it is 'tat' ultimately!!??  What exactly is the meaning of this 'tat' according to shankara?? We have to refer the sUtra bhAshya where bhAshyakAra clarifies : tat padena cha prakrutaM 'sat brahma' Ekshitru jagatO janmAdi kAraNaM abhidheeyate.  It is quite evident from bhAshyakAra's clarification that the pada 'tat' denoting the 'sat brahma' which is jagatO janmAdi kAraNaM.  Now tell me prabhuji, can we give less importance to tat pad when this tat pada is denoting the 'sat brahma' to realize the 'tvam' padArtha??  And again when uddAlaka giving the nine time upadesha in chAndOgya never ever gives even an iota of hint that 'idam sarvam' is kevala avidyA kalpita of svetaketu OTOH he is emphasizing the upanishadic truth that ItadAtmaM idaM 'sarvaM' 'tat satyaM' sa AtmA.  Under these circumstances how can a writer of this prakaraNa grantha making the kalpanA pramAda to declare tat is 'gaUNa' here when shruti itself saying it is 'satyaM' !!??  


 It is *conceptually* so simple that even a boy can quickly understand it as VidyAraNya says. There is no need to worry about who  created this world, what was the process of creation, etc. The standard answer is: "you created this just you create your dream world."  

>  unfortunately bhAshyakAra when it comes to jAgrat prapancha which is Ishwara srushti says it is Ishwara's sAmkalpika satya srushti unlike jeeva's vAsanA srushti of svapna prapancha.  

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
