Pranams.

I think it is desirable to also state the definition for Jiva , in their
own words ( in other words quotes from the respective works )  as in
Sidhanta Bindu and as in VivaraNa prameya
saMgraha of BhAratI tIrtha in the context of ekajIvavAda /
dRShTisRShTivAda.Otherwise
mixingup of definitions from different prakriyAs is a distinct possibility
with corresponding misunderstandings.

Just a suggestion. May please be disposed off as deemed fit.

Pranams and Regards
