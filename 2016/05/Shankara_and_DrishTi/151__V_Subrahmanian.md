This is what Shankara has to say about the teaching of 'srishti' in the
Upanishads:

BSB 1.4.14:

 न ह्ययं सृष्ट्यादिप्रपञ्चः प्रतिपिपादयिषितः । न हि तत्प्रतिबद्धः
कश्चित्पुरुषार्थो दृश्यते श्रूयते वा । न च कल्पयितुं शक्यते,
उपक्रमोपसंहाराभ्यां तत्र तत्र ब्रह्मविषयैर्वाक्यैः साकमेकवाक्यताया
गम्यमानत्वात् । *दर्शयति च सृष्ट्यादिप्रपञ्चस्य
ब्रह्मप्रतिपत्त्यर्थताम् *— ‘अन्नेन
सोम्य शुङ्गेनापो मूलमन्विच्छाद्भिः सोम्य शुङ्गेन तेजो मूलमन्विच्छ तेजसा
सोम्य शुङ्गेन सन्मूलमन्विच्छ’ (छा. उ. ६-८-४)

।

The aim of the Veda is not to establish  creation.  He cites the
sampradayavit Gaudapada: 'Creation taught in the Veda by giving examples of
clay, gold, iron (Chandogya), fire-sparks (Mundaka and Br.up.) are not to
conclude that a creation really took place but only to drive home the Truth
that Brahman alone is the Tattva, to the aspirant.'   Thus, for Shankara
those shrutis that teach 'so kāmayata...' is a-pāramārthika.  It is nowhere
to give the impression to the aspirant 'that Ishvara has created this world
and I live in it.'  That is not what the creation-shrutis aim at.  On the
other hand, Shankara says above that they aim at impressing that the effect
is non-different from the cause.
