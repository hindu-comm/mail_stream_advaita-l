There is a verse, apparently from the Vartika of Sureshwaracharya that
places the burden on the 'tvam':

tvampadrtha-vivekāya sannyāsaḥ sarvakarmaṇām
shrutyā vidhīyate yasmāt tattyāgī patito bhavet

The Shruti enjoins renunciation of all works for the *sole purpose of
engaging in tvam padārtha* enquiry.  If a person does not do that he
forsakes the purpose of sannyasa.
