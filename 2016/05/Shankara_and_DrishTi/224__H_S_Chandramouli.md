Dear Sri Anand Ji,

Sorry for bothering you again.

I came across the following statement in one of the reviews on the EJV
advanced by Sri  PrakAshAnanda.

<< It is clear that in following the *Yoga*-*Vasishtha* in this regard
*Prakasananda* makes a departure from the *Advaita* tradition handed down
from *Sankaracharya*.  While both *Prakasananda* and the
*Yoga*-*Vasishtha* deny
the existence of objects when not perceived, *Sankaracharya* not only
admits their existence but also holds that they exist in the same form in
which they are known*.  Sri Sankara’s* views on the matter are clearly set
forth in his commentary on*Brahma*-*sutra*, II.2.28.  His refutation of the
*Buddhistic* school of *Vijnanavada* in his commentary on the same sutra
applies as well to *Prakasananda*’*s**drishti-srishti-vada*.>>.


Nodoubt this goes against the view that EJV is accepted by the author of
Vivarana and also Sri Vidyaranya Swami. However are there any differing
views on this? Is it generally accepted by all advaitins that EJV is
consistent with the doctrine advanced by Sri Bhagavatpada?

I would be grateful for a confirmation.

Pranams and Regards
