Sri Anand ji should confirm his view, but I certainly don't hold any of the
above opinions.

I do think it is a more difficult view to accept, as it flies in the face
of everyday experience. It requires one to have a tremendous amount of
viveka/vairAgya to live by this view. However, that in itself doesn't make
it better or worse than other prakriyAs. Whatever works for the student is
best.

If any of my posts convey that meaning, I wanted to clarify that is not my
intention. I just found this an interesting topic, and hence brought it up
for discussion.
