Truth be told, its the only vAda that works purely off the dream
experiences, which everyone has. And experiences are *not* abstract.

True, since people have trouble analyzing the dream and accepting the fact
so: "I was completely deluded during the dream", due to the overwhelming
waking world experiences, which are exactly the same.

That may be said about any vAda or prakriyA, since one has to *use* it to
know whether or not it works.

If jIva is not brahman by nature, mokSha by j~nAna will become impossible!

The same way that it does in any other vAda, namely avidyA!

The conclusion is far from the fact. Sorry, but how you start off by saying
"difficult to understand" and end up with "not logical" is itself beyond
logic.
