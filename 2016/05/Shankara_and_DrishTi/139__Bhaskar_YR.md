praNAms Sri Venkatraghavan prabhuji

because Sri Appayya Dikshitar later uses Ishvara directly to mean the jIva himself - "Ishvara .api san bhrAnto bhavati jAgare" - despite *being Ishvara*, he is deluded in the waking state.

>  I donâ€™t know in which context Ishwara can directly mean the jeeva but in shankara bhAshya jeeva is shAreeri and he has very limited boundaries within this BMI under these circumstances there is difference between Ishwara and jeeva.  jeevO hi nAma chetanaH shareerAdhyakshaH prANAnAM dhArayitA, tat prasiddheH whereas Ishwara is not only in shareera of jeeva he is 'sarva gata' like AkAsha, bigger than puthvi and AkAsha but jeevastu shareere eva bhavati, tasya bhOgAdishTANAt shareerAdanyatra vruttyabhAvAt clarifies shankara in sUtra bhAshya.  So, when we realize this satya there is no jeeva bhAva but till then there is Ishwara jeeva bheda and that is what even smruti texts too emphasizes, smrtishcha shAreera paramAtmanOrbhedaM darshayati.  Ishwara himself deluded IMHO does not go well within the shankarAdvaita because Ishwara is avidyA vinirmukta, nitya shuddha Buddha mukta.  Kindly note I am not questioning the above statement just I am sharing my thoughts on Ishwara and jeeva according to shankara bhAshya.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
