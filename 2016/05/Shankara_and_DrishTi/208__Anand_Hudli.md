>How do we have to do the samanvaya between equality between jAgrat &
svapna prapancha with that of sUtra-s like : na abhAva upalabdeH,
vaidharmyAccha na >svapnAdhivat and corresponding shankara commentaries
etc. Though in this pUrvapaxi is vijnAnavAdi as per the context shankara
would not have given the >importance to jAgrat prapancha if the both
prapancha-s are kevala jeeva's avidyA kalpita.

This can be answered in two ways. First, adhikAri-bheda can be a
consideration which required Shankara to accept the difference between
jAgrat and svapna states. Ananda-bodhendra Sarasvati in his commentary on
the Yoga Vasishtha says, "jIvanmuktAnAM dRShTyA dRShTi-sRSHhTivAdasyaiva
shAstre pratiShThApanAditi bhAvaH". From this it is clear
dRShTi-sRShTi-vAda, which holds dream and waking states are
nondifferent, is suitable for advanced sAdhakas or even jIvanmuktas,
whereas the brahmasUtras' method of treating the two states as
different mainly for "beginners" and "intermediate" level mumukShus.
Second, as Shri Venkatraghavanji pointed out, Shankara's intention in the
brahmasUtras was to refute vijnAnavAdins' arguments, not those of
GauDapAda, which he does accept.
