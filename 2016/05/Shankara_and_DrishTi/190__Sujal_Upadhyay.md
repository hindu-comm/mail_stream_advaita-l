praNAms,

Interesting. Thanks for sharing.

At times dreams indicate our future :)

What I feel is that no creation or dream creation is better understood
w.r.t. to individual consciousness and not collective consciousness. That
is why when one jIva is Self Realised, the world is not *destroyed*, but
*negated*, else the whole world will be destroyed.

Until Ishvara does not detach 'I' from BMI, it is better to be a humble
bhakta, else it is like seeing snake, but keep saying that I see rope :)

After one experiences detachment, and sees own body clearly, just like one
sees others, as if a body is seen from a camera on top back, there are two
options - to be extrovert and run after material objects or to strive to
become introvert and merge in source.

Hare Krishna
