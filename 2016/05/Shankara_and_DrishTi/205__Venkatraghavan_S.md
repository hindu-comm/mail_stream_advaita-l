If anyone is able to find a reason for why drishti srishti vAda, as
outlined in siddhAnta muktAvali, and talked about in other granthAs (from
what I could make out, Appayya DIkshitar, MadhusUdana Sarasvati, Nishchala
Das etc. have a similar definition of DSV as PrakAshAnada) consider anya
jIvas as AbhAsa, I would be most grateful if you can share it here.

I will also read the links that Sri Ananda sent to the text and report back
if I find anything.

Regards,
Venkatraghavan

and that the AbhAsa of other jIvAs was because of that.

like there are other reasons for other jIvas' AbhAsa in eka jIva vAda.  As
you say, I need to spend some time studying / thinking. Thank you for
bringing this angle up.

one of the anAdi-s. People appreciate if someone presents some old
sentence, so here it is from advaitasiddhikAra - अनाद्यतिरिक्तसृष्टिविषय एव
दृष्टिसृष्टिस्वीकारात् ।
>> Why ekajIvavAdin-s don't accept jIva and support jIvAbhAsa is totally
another thing. And, similarly the acceptance of nAnAjIva has nothing to do
with dRRiShTisRRiShTi or sRRiShTidRRiShTi.
