You are correct, all statements which seems to yield to alternate meanings
must be reconciled (saManvaya) with other explicit shruti/smriti vAkya-s.

For example:

 paramOpaniShad explains (in the context of wherever/whenever shruti
equates this jagat to dream) on how one must understand such sentences as
-- 

"anitva vikAritva pAratantraAdi rUpataH | svapnAdi sAMyam jagatO, na tu
bhOdha nirvatyAtA | sarvajnasya yatO vishNuH  sarva dvaita pratIyatE |
bhOdhAsahaM tato naitat kMtvAjnAvashamasya hi"

Wherever this world is said to be akin to dream in shAstras, it has to be
understood not as something which is "nirvatya" or mithya .  It is said so
because both are similar in sense of their anityatva, vikAritva and
pAratantryatva. When this dvaita jagat is in Vishnu's knowledge (pratIti)
and since He is sarvajna, how can His knowdge is brAnti and how can this
jagt be mithya?

Jagat sristi is Brahman's svalaxaNa (and not due to association with
avidyA)  is quite explicit in bhAgavata 10th skanda 5th slOka --

EkaM paraMjyOtir ananyam adhvayam sva-smastAyA nitya nirastakalmaSaM,
brahmAkhyam asyOdhbhavanAdi hEtubhiH sva-lakShaNai lakShitabhAva nivrutim
