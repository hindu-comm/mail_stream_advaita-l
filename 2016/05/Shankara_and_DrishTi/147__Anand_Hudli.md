Dear Shri Venkatraghavanji,

Thanks for posting the conversation transcript with the revered Abhinava
Vidyatirtha SvaminaH. One more astounding thing about DSV/eka-jIva-vAda, as
elucidated brilliantly by PrakAshAnanda, is that he reduced the sattA
traividhya of pAramArthika, vyAvahArika, and prAtibhAsika sattA to only two
pAramArthika and prAtibhAsika! There is no vyAvahArika sattA at all! Since
the objects of the waking state are not any more real  than those of the
dream state, why bother to call them vyAvahArika satya? They are
prAtibhAsika satya too, not any better than dream objects. More on this
later.

Anand
