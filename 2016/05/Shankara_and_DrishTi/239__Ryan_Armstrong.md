Sri Praveen
Thank you for this explanation.
I see that I had taken your comment out of the context of the discussion.

In re-reading both your answer and Chapter 6 of ChAndogya, a new question
has arisen.
It is in relation to the state of the student, or perhaps the student's
approach.
In the ChAndogya, the section beginning with सदेव सोम्येदमग्र आसीत् (Ch. 6.
2. 1) describes the One becoming or, appearing to become, many.
As I understand it, this is the process called अन्वय.
>From Khanda 8, the "inverse" process व्यतिरेक is employed, moving
"backward" as it were, going to the source, to the source of that source
etc. until the ultimate source is arrived at.

It is also my understanding that some students would be more inclined to
one or the other of these approaches.
So the question(s) that arises is:
Is this an assumption on my part - that there is an inclination to one or
the other based on संस्कार built up?
And if this is so, would DSV/SDV not be more of an approach used by the
guru based on the student's "make-up" rather than a definitive statement of
"fact"?

Thank you again for your patience.
Yours in Truth
Ryan
