Reg  << If you read the description of dRShTi-sRShTi vAda in the second
pariccheda,
you will notice that appayya dIkShita has mentioned the view of the
prakAshAnanda's vedAntasiddhAntamuktAvalI as the last one. Usually, the
last view mentioned is taken to be the one endorsed by the author. >>,



The book is a presentation  of the different position taken by Advaitins on
various  issues. Different prakriyas also are presented. Each such issue ,
even opposing prakriyas , has a last view mentioned. Such being the case it
is difficult to conclude that in a book of this type the last one in each
case is what the author endorses.
