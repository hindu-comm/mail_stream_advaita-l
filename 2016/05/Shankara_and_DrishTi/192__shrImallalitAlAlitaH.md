​No need to try hard to justify it. If you are able to justify
dRRiShTisRRiShTi for ekajIva by using svapna-nyAya; you are free to use the
same for aneka-jIva.
It is accepted that there are nAnA-prapa~Ncha. The usage 'what i see is
being seen by you' is illusion again.

Rest of your post doesn't need attention at this point.​

​How vAchaspati reaches at nAnAjIva, is other point. We may head to
bhAmaati for that.​
