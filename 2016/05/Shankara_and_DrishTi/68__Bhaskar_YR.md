I don’t think whenever shankara endorses the concept of 'eka jeeva' he is pointing his finger on 'jeeva', it is on the other hand the concept of 'eka jeeva' vaada holds good 'eka Chaitanya which is pAramArthically true as per Advaita.  From the empirical stand point we do believe and behave as if there are actually multiple jeeva-s.  samashti antaHkaraNa, vyashti antaHkaraNa comes into picture whenever there is a talk about eka jeeva and nAnA jeeva.  And most importantly when it comes to creation, the 'eka jeeva' vAda does not pertain the jeeva's avidyA kalpita jagat.  The srushti has been explained as Ishwara hetuka, shankara nowhere says this jagat and Ishwara both a jeeva's avidyA kalpita.  We don’t have to bring the ArambhaNAdhikaraNAM to prove that Ishwara is kevala vyAvahArika satya in this context of jeeva's imagination / illusion.  

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!

Namaste

It is very simple. Adi Sankara has not rejected Eka Jeeva Vaada in the Prasthana Traya Bhashya. Therefore if you accept Eka Jeeva Vaada of only one Jeeva existing in the Universe you can see DSV is also accepted. Because that one Jeeva has imagined everything in the Universe. If you say Ishwara has created the Universe even that Ishwara is imagined by that Jeeva only. The whole Universe is existing because of that Jeeva's imagination.
