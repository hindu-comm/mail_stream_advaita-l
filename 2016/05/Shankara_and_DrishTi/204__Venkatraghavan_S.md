Namaste Sri Srinath,

Six entities are accepted as anAdi in advaita:
jIva Isho vishuddhA chit tathA jIveshayorbhidA |
avidyA tacchitoryoga: ShadasmAkam anAdaya: ||

None of these six entities are created.

kAla in advaita is the tacchitoryoga: in the above sloka - the sambandha
between avidyA and Brahman. So kAla is not a product of avidyA or Brahman -
it is their relationship.

Regards,
Venkatraghavan
