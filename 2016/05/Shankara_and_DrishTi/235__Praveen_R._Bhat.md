Any vAkya that gives rise to the aparokShajnAna of one's svarUpa is a
mahAvAkya, because it is mokShakAraka. In that light, the tat tvam asi
vAkyajnAna which is after the padajnAna of three words, is unnecessary for
one who understands the tvam itself as the sacchidAnanda svarUpa, which is
otherwise obtained by bhAgatyAga between tat and tvam. Here, tvam is
directly understood as sat-chit-Ananda and everything else, including one's
body-mind-sense-complex as mithyA, svapnavat. Hence a shortcut. Else, all
other questions, not restricted to creation story alone, are needed for
explanation of everything seen in vyavahAra and prAtibhAsika, before one
lands on pAramArthika tattva. IMHO, shortcut lies in svapnavat as an answer
for every such question.
