Exactly, karma kANDa being larger than jnAna kANDa does not it make it more
valid than jnAna kANDa. It is meant for different adhikAris who have
different purushArthAs.

The point I was trying to make is that any pramANa's usefulness is limited
to revealing the prameya. Once that is done, its purpose is served. The
fact that it's been made redundant afterwards does not mean that there was
no need for it or the jnAnam it produces are invalid.

Regards,
Venkatraghavan
