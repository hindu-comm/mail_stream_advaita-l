My understanding is that in the final teaching, there is nothing else apart
from aham - everything else is negated by neti neti.

That being the case, if one has sufficient viveka to separate the drik from
the drishyA and sufficient vairAgya to dismiss the drishyA, there is no
need to first know a tat padArtha and then do a bhAga tyAga of that that
tat and aham to realise the aikya of the one chaitanya.

Such a one can simply start off with neti neti, and end at the tvam / aham
lakshyArtha which is svatah siddhah.

Regards,
Venkatraghavan
