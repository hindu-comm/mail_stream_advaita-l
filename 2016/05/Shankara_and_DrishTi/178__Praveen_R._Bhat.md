Sarasvati, the author of Advaita Siddhi, whose usage of logic even the
logicians themselves feared! So one can say that I do not understand the
logic used, but to say that it is not logical is not right. Perhaps, this
is what you too mean with your closing statement.

First off, you are mixing the prakrIyA from SDV. Even there, the jIva also
desires to become many and therefore becomes *as if* many during svapna.
Are those svapna jIvas many? Its only one, the same vishva who slept. In
DSV, the tarka used is svapnavat, for jAgRt also. Hence, logical.

True, all varieties in Upanishads,etc, are used to establish brahman, not
the creation.
