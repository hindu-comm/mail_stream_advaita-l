In respect of EJV, at pages 176-179, it lists several different views
advanced by different advaitins on the number of Jivas and their nature in
order to satisfy the requirements imposed by different Shruti vAkyAs. It is
not as if there is unanimity on this issue amongst the advaitins
themselves.



Just for information.
