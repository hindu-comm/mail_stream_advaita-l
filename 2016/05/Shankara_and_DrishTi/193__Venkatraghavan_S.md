To each jIva, appearance of other jivAs is also part of his srishta
prapanchA? He may not think they are his srishti though.

No need to try hard to justify it. If you are able to justify
dRRiShTisRRiShTi for ekajIva by using svapna-nyAya; you are free to use the
same for aneka-jIva.
It is accepted that there are nAnA-prapa~Ncha. The usage 'what i see is
being seen by you' is illusion again.

Rest of your post doesn't need attention at this point.

How vAchaspati reaches at nAnAjIva, is other point. We may head to
bhAmaati for that.
