Dearshmanah
This vaada is like pure mathematics. Abstract in toto. Very difficult to
visualise or understand. It is purely academic in content. Also if Brahman
is the jiiva where is the question of jiiva getting to know He himself is
Brahman? How ignorance veils Brahman,? I think this vaada is not logical.
R. Krishnamoorthy.
