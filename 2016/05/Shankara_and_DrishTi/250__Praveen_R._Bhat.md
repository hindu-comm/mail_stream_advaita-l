True, adhikAribheda calls for this samanvayA too. One who is fit for
dvaitajnAna should have this exact understanding for his karma, upAsana,
etc. Else he will have confusion thus: I am satya, Vishnu is satya, how can
jagat be mithyA?!

He should continue that. And the instruction by Bhagavan Krishna is to
encourage them:

न बुद्धिभेदं जनयेदज्ञानां कर्मसङ्गिनाम्।

जोषयेत्सर्वकर्माणि विद्वान् युक्तः समाचरन्।।3.26।।
