Sri Ve

Sri Venkatraghavan Ji,
>

No wonder Eka Jiva vAda/DSV as elaborated by PrakAshAnanda is so difficult
to understand or accept. One Jiva who in his jAgrat state only created so
much including jnAnis like Hiranyagarbha himself seeks liberation from
samsAra.  Is this elaboration  supported by Bhashya? Or is it a prakriya
 independent of the Bhashya?  Would be grateful for a clarification.

Pranams and Regards
