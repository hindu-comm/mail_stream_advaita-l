 Is it not a joke and that so many jivas arguing about ekajivavada or nanajivavada? 
 This also Divine Lila.sarvaM hi nAnAtvam brahmaNi kalpitamEva || [Sri Shankara]

With warm and respectful regards, A Jiva one amongst other Jivas

Thanks, this is precisely what I was thinking! Moreover, prAtibhAsika is
not completely freewill-based as people seem to think. I don't have the
choice to dream exactly what I want to dream, similar to SDV where Ishvara
doesn't create the world as per his whims and fancies. So I would think
that the question as to why I created the world this way is as irrelevant
in DSV, inasmuch as it is in SDV as to why Ishvara created the world so. It
just is so and it doesn't affect my mukti.

Unfortunately we hold on to prakriyAs/vAdas and reject others based on the
one we understand, as if they are the ultimate truth and lose focus of
their purpose. Even in SDV, finally we have to say that not only jIva, but
Ishvara, Shruti, bhashya, all are mithyA. Who imagined is a moot point
then. I remember what Pujya Swami Dayanandaji says in the context of aikya.
For some reason, people find it comparatively easy to say "I am brahman",
because they think that brahman is consciousness, so its not really a big
deal. However, when it comes to saying "I am Ishvara", people hesitate, are
even scared! IMHO, this verisame thing is seen while assessing DSV.

BTW, as you said siddhAntapradIpikA doesn't seem to be available, even on
archive.org.
