Sri Subrahmanian Ji observed



<< The Br. Up. 1.4.10 is about Brahman itself getting the realization 'aham
Brahma asmi' and attaining sarvatmabhava. Shankara accepts avidya to this
Brahman. >>,



No doubt. Similar statement can be found in Mandukya also. But this applies
to ALL jivas  Not just one jiva. What the BU refers to is the equivalent of
“ jivo brahmaiva naparah “”. I do not think ekajIvavAda is applicable here.
