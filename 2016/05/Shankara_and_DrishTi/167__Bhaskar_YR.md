For *my* simple question on *your* stand without giving the answer *you* are asking *me* counter question avoiding the answer ☺ I don’t mind.  BTW, without knowing * your* answer how can *I* take the call on it and declare *illogical* ☺ Anyway, you are welcome to hold your stand firmly close to your chest…so I am ☺

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!

Sri Bhaskar,
If you think it is illogical, why bother knowing the answer? Let it be so.

Kindly don’t think I am unnecessarily arguing with you and wasting your / my time.  I am just showing the inconsistency in this eka jeeva vaada, his sarvajnata and his imaginative world  from your own observation.  Okay, last question in this thread from my side that too if you mind to answer :

Here in  eka jeeva vAda,the ‘eka’ jeeva here is jnAni or loukika whose imagination is this jagat !!??  I take your answer as final stand of yours without asking further questions ☺ Kindly be rest assured prabhuji.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!

Sri Bhaskar,
I don't want to argue with you. As I said you are welcome to agree or disagree with me, or adopt any prakriya which you feel is appropriate.

Thanks for highlighting the ‘you’ and ‘not me’ in your statement, atleast from this can I understand what is heena in *my* imaginative world is adhyArOpita in *your*imaginative world and what is jeeva in my imaginative world is parabrahman in *your* imaginative world and at the same time both are sarvajnA-s for creating their own imaginative worlds ☺  could you see the absurdity in this stand of eka jeeva vAda??

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!

No, I am saying the hInatva adjective you add to jeeva is also your adhyAropa, not mine. So if you think I am belittling vedA by making a hIna jIva perform apparent srishti, that is because *you* are superimposing hInatva, *not me*.

In reality I hold no creation to have happened. However, even in avidyA dasha, when we talk of apparent creation, hInatva of the jIva is only an imagination, not fact.

Without giving any importance to bhAshyakAra's verdict,  if we say this jagat is parichinna, avidyA paripUrNa, heena jeeva's imagination, we are undoubtedly insulting & belittling the vedAnta maryAda.

Sorry, I don't consider the jIva to be heena at all. He is sAkshAt Brahman.
