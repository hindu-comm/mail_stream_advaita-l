Very well said. This is a point missed by many people. They either get lost
in the literal details of the prakriyA/ examples or question the need for
elaboration, forgetting that each has an audience that may differ from
another. The final goal is to bring about an establishment of doubtless
siddhAnta.

PS: I haven't read your paper yet. Hopefully sometime soon.
