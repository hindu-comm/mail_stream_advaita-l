praNAms Sri Venkatraghavan prabhuji
Hare krishna

Three reasons come to mind, there may be others.
1) A jnani's actions cannot be called karmA at all (karnaNyakarmah yah pashyet, akarmaNi cha karma yah), whatever actions the body mind anAtma is performing, are not karma at all to him. They are just karma AbhAsa. He has nothing to gain or lose from them, as he is krtsna karma krt.

>  yes prabhuji, rightly observed.  paramArtha jnana sublates the pramAtrutva, jnAtrutva, bhOktrutva in jnAni clarifies shankara in geeta bhAshya. 

2) Whatever actions happen are for loka kshemA only.

>  and other reasons for jnAni's actions  are his prArabha karma and avidyA lesha so says some saMpradAya vAdins.  

3) Further, such actions are only to inspire others by his example to follow the path of dharma - yad yad Acharati shreshThah tad tad evetaro janah | sa yat pramANam kurute lokas tad anuvartate ||

>  Yes, it is only in the ajnAni drushti jnAni is acting but jnAni is in reality ashareeri only (no individual shAreeri) hence shruti says : ashareevaM vAva santaM na priyApriye sprushataH.  

>  More agreements more smiles :-) 

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!
Bhaskar
