Dear list members,
Yesterday I was hearing a tiruppavai 'upanyaasam'.The speaker was as
usual,berating Sri Sankara Bhagavatpaada for 'kapasyeva pundarikam'.

My question is a very low level question.You have the choice of ignoring it.

a)Whats the context of the Paramapurushas eyes?
b)Should Sri Sankara Bhagavatpada  have given that interpretation?

S.Murali
