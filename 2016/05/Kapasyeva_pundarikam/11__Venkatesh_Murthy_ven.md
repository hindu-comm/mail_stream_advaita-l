 Namaste
In the Sankara Bhashya -
तस्य एवं सर्वतः सुवर्णवर्णस्याप्यक्ष्णोर्विशेषः । कथम् ? तस्य यथा कपेः
मर्कटस्य आसः कप्यासः ; आसेरुपवेशनार्थस्य करणे घञ् ; कपिपृष्ठान्तः
येनोपविशति ; कप्यास इव पुण्डरीकम् अत्यन्ततेजस्वि एवम् देवस्य अक्षिणी ;
उपमितोपमानत्वात् न हीनोपमा

He has said there is no Hinopama or Bad Comparison. Why? Because
उपमितोपमानत्वात्. He has not compared Monkey's Behind part with God's
eyes. He has compared it with Lotus. Then the Lotus is compared with
God's eyes.

It is like saying A is like B and B is like C. Nobody said A is like
C. Why is Ramanuja crying? No need to cry.

But higher philosophy is also saying he is wrong to cry. Why? God is
everywhere and in everything. He is in me in you in Monkey in stone
everywhere even in stones and even in pigs and worms feeding on
excreta. Why we should feel ashamed to say this? If a person does not
like this he is petty minded and thinks God is only in Idols in
temples.
