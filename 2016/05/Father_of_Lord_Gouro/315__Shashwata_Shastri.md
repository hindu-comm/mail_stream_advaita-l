I was reading the preface of Advaitya Siddhi. While reading it, I came upon
an interesting statement. The commentator " Sri Jogendranath Tarka Tirtha"
stated that Lord Gouropada was the son of Chaya-Suka (shadow suka who was
created in order to alleviate the dolor of Krishna Dvaipayana by Lord
Mahadeva)   according to Devi Vagabatam. Is this statement true? Can anyone
please provide me the exact reference from Devi Vagabatam?

Best Regards,

Shashwata Chowdhury
