अन्यथानुपपत्तिश्चेत् अस्ति वस्तुप्रसाधिका ।
पिनष्ट्यदृष्टिवैमत्यं सैव सर्वबलाधिका ।।
anyathAnupapatti is strongest and hence doesn't expect example/similar
thing to generate conclusion.

At places, it is stronger than pratyaxa and can help us decide it's
invalidity. As in case of experience - 'I'm ignorant'. Since ego is
superimposed, so it can't be Ashraya of aGYAnam. And hence that experience
is illusion.

The rule is - that which is tested strictly, is stronger.
pratyaxa or any other vRRtti is not accepted intrinsically stronger by us.
