Namaste Durga Prasad ji,

Compared to which pramANa and on what basis do you expect arthApatti to be
said as being strong or weak? Each pramANa operates where others cannot
operate, so in that sense they would be have equal weightage in their own
application areas. However, other laukika pramANas are kind of based on
pratyakSha, so they may be said to be weaker in comparison to pratyakSha.
arthApatti is used where mere anumAna doesn't work, so one can't be really
considered stronger better than the other. So too with others. Similarly,
shabda has an alaukika application where none other has, so how would one
compare!

praNAm,
--Praveen R. Bhat
