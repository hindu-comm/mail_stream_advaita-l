 It has debated whether or not the Uttara Kanda constitutes a part of the original Valmiki Ramayana, or is a later addition to the text.

Here is the reason why I believe the Uttara Kanda may not have been a part of the original Valmiki Ramayana:
The Mahabharata actually contains the "Story of Rama, the Son of Dasaratha", known as "Ramopakhyana". After talking about Rama and Lakshmana going to the forest, Sita's captivity, Hanuman setting fire to Lanka, war with Kumbhakarna, death of Ravana, freeing Sita etc., it ends with:
"And then assisted by the celestial Rishi (Vasishtha), Rama performed on the banks of the Gomati ten horse sacrifices without obstruction of any kind and with treble presents unto Brahmanas."

Surprising that the "Ramopakhyana" as narrated in the Mahabharata ends exactly at the same place as the Yuddha Kanda of the Valmiki Ramayana (i.e. the beginning of Rama Rajyam), with no mention of the later events of the Uttara Kanda!
