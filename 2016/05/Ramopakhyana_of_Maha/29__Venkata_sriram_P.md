///

The moral of story is -  If even great people like Raama and Seeta
could not be permanently happy how can we ordinary people be happy in
this Samsaara. It is an ocean of unhappiness only.

//

एको रसः करुण एव ....

This is the underlying principle in rAmAyaNa if we analyze from "rasa" point of view.
Hence, the आदिकाव्य takes off with करुण and ends with करुण.

regs,
sriram
