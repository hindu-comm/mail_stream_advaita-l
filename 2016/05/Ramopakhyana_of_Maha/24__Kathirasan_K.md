Namaste Venkateshji,

While this approach to appreciating Ramayana may very well serve the needs
of those in Nivrtti Dharma where vairagya is a pre-requisite, it may not
help a community that wants advance its progress in terms of material
progress. I am referring to the majority of people who are in Pravrtti
Dharma here. I come from a place where hindus become very complacent with
suffering and difficulties in life so much that they feel that our
scriptures are strewn with adversities for even the gods. They quote Rama,
Sita, Yudhishtira etc as examples.

I am curious if the illustrious hindu kings of ancient and medieval India,
had such an outlook (that life is an ocean of unhappiness) towards life.
And if so, how did that contribute to an opulent society that they ruled
during those times?
