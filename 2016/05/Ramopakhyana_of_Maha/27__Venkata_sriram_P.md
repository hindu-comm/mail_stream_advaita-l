Namaste,

There were 3 culprits who raised this controversy namely 
1) Prof.Weber 2) Prof. Lasen 3) Prof.Keith

Their argument is that the language of mahAbhArata is crude 
and the language of rAmAyaNa is polished.  Hence, rAmAyaNa 
was composed much later than mahAbhArata.  Moreover, the source of 
rAmAyaNa was MB's rAmOpAkhyAna.  Hence, bAlakANDa & uttarakANDa 
 are prakSipta.  

There are several ridiculous arguments for them to hold their views.  

Our traditional scholars like Karapatri Swamin, Sri.Gunturu Seshendra Sarma Garu
have refuted them with valid points.  

Sri.Seshendra Sarma’s  research work on rAmAyaNa called 
“shODashi” which is a bit tantric representation of rAmAyaNa is here:
