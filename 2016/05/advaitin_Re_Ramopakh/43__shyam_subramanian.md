Hari OM
I recall HH Swami Dayanandaji had categorically stated in one of his talks that Ramayana ends with the coronation of Rama and that Uttarakanda portion is a highly imaginative poetic fancy.

Just for information only.

Those who recite Sundara kanda, also recite the Sri Rama Pattabhishekam episode (last chapter in yuddha kanda) after completing the recitation of Sundara Kanda. They dont recite the full Yuddha Kanda, but still they have to recite the Srirama Pattabhishekam episode after their Sundara Kanda parayana is complete. It is an implicit acknowledgement that the Ramayana ends with the coronation of Rama as the King of Ayodhya. This fact seems to go against the opinion you proposed that the uttara kanda is an integral part of Ramayana.

> Thirdly, Ramayana was seen in two phases - the pUrva-Ramayana (If I may call it), and Uttara-Ramayana (which is Uttara Kanda). By the time Valmiki started writing Ramayana, the Purva part was already past in time. He was blessed with the boon of having the ability to see the "Past" things "as it were" and write the poem. So, when he started writing Ramayana, that period was the time where Uttara Kanda's events were actually going on in Rama's kingdom. He started writing Ramayana and by the divine boon he recollected the "past" events and wrote it as "ramayana" in "Six" kandas. Now that was a "tale of the Past", let us call it "Story-A", then what comes "next" is the tale that is "[LATER to Story-A]", and in sanskrit "Later" is called "uttara", hence he named that seventh kanda as "uttara Kanda".
> 
> Fourth reason - Valmiki is himself a character in UK hence, it cannot be fiction - It needs little elaboration so here it goes --->  If you read UK, here Valmiki is one of the characters in UK, the UK activities were going contemporary to Valmiki's life. This is why you would see Valmiki himself as one of the "characters" in UK several times in his own poem. This is like Vyasa being one of the characters in Vyasa's own poem Mahabharata. what does it mean? It means that UK is authentic because an author who himself exists in a tale as a character, that cannot be falsified.For instance - If say I am interviewing Amitabh Bachan (AB), and I write his article saying "I met his wife Jaya and enquired about AB, "I" men his Son and his daughter in law and got inputs from them" - this article cannot be called a fiction as the author himself is a part of the narrative.
> 
> Fifth reason is - There is NO pATha-vidhi prescribed by Valmiki saying "One should recite Ramayana only till the Yuddha kanda and close". The Purva-Ramayana had a "logical closure" at the end of Yuddha-Kanda, hence a "phala-sruti" was included there. It doesn't say there is no further kandas to it. People usually stop reading Ramayana till that Yuddha kanda itself. that is just one pATha-vidhi.followed by people. Similarly, there si another pATha-vidhi followed which is "just to recite Sudara kanda", and learned people say, "Sundara kanda Parayana itself si enough". does that make us conclude sundara-kanda alone is authentic kanda and not others? No. That is the "Greatness" of that Kanda which needs to be understood from that statement. Similarly, the procedure to do parayana till Yuddha-Kanda is "yet another procedure" only  but not the conclusion. In fact, "Uttara Kanda" alone can be recited separately, hence it alone has earned a name "uttara-RAMAYANA", no other kanda is called "ramayana", they are Kandas only, only the Uttara Kanda is termed "uttara Ramayana" which also confers high benefits on the reciters. So, just based on the "popularity" of the pATha-vidhi adopted by the multitude in Kaliyuga, we cannot consider that as a "prescription" of Valmiki, it is just a procedure followed by different people. Hence UK is also a valid Kanda to be included in ramayana.

Since the six kandas were events of the past which we recollected and wrote, and the seventh one was a narration of events which were "later (uttara)" to the events of those six kandas. he poetically mentioned in that way.

> Seventh - The Bala-kanda itself starts from the Lava-Kusha singing Ramayana ballad as learnt in Valmiki's hermitage. Now if UK didn't happen, then why were Lava-Kusha in sage's hermitage? Hence UK events are correct. Ramayana has an excellent screenplay like our modern day films - it begins with current tale (Lava kusha narrating ramayana), and takes us into flashback (actual Ramayana tales of the past), and brings us back to present again in uttara Kanda. who could do such an excellent screenplay or direction that that adi-kavi??
> 
> Eighth - Rama doesn't refer to Lava-Kusha as his sons, he believes them to be "hermits" who have "kingly features".In the very same 4th chapter of Balakanda Lava-Kusha are trained by Valmiki to recite the ballad and they are sent to recite it all over the state. They reach Rama's kingdom and recite it in front of him. Rama praising them tells the following words to Lakshmana:
