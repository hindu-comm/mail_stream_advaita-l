Namaste


A 'Shānkara Ashtottarashata nāma Pārāyaṇa yajna' was started, under the
directions of the Jagadguru in December last and ended in May this year.
Those who participated in that, across the Karnataka State, had converged
in Sringeri  yesterday. A count was kept on the pārāyaṇam which came to
some 48,00,000. Originally it was envisaged at 20,00,000. But the
enthusiasm of people took the number to such great heights.  At the grand
function the Jagadguru addressed the gathering bringing out the various
aspects of the 108 names of Shankara Bhagavatpada.  The Kannada talk is
available here:
