But some SSS following people may say he did not write Aitareya Bhashya and somebody wrote and put Sankaracharya's name.

I donâ€™t know about other Sri SSS followers,  since Sri SSS himself has not raised any objection/doubt  with regard to authorship of Aitareya bhAshya and it is one of the principal dashOpanishats for which bhagavatpAda written commentary along with geeta & sUtra, I do believe that this work is from the pen of bhagavatpAda.  Infact it is where shankara clarifies brahman's svabhAva is sarvajnatvaM and sarvashaktitvaM and it is not loaded on brahman after treating him on Ishwara / creator.  

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
