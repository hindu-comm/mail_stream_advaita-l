>From : H.N.Sreenivasa MurthyPranams to all.
Respected Readers,
Here is a SlOka from Bhishmastavaraja : 

yasmin sarvaM yataH sarvaM yaH sarvaM sarvataSca yaH |yaSca sarvamayO nityaM tasmai sarvAtmanE namaH ||Salutations to HIM, WHO is the source of all that exists, from WHOMeverything springs forth, and WHO is manifesting as THE ALL , being Omnipresentin the Universe at all TIMES andis the ATMAN of all the livingcreatures. OM TAT SAT
I request the scholarly members to reveal the thought-positions contained in the SlOka and also guide / help me in cognizing those thought-positions. I shall be deeply indebted to all for this help. 

With respectful namaskarams,Sreenivasa Murthy
