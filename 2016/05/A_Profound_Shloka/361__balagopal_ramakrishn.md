Respected Readers,
Here is a SlOka from Bhishmastavaraja :

OM TAT SAT
I request the scholarly members to reveal the thought-positions contained in the SlOka and also guide / help me in cognizing those thought-positions. I shall be deeply indebted to all for this help. 

With respectful namaskarams,Sreenivasa Murthy
