Namaste

Everybody knows the film shown on screen is not really happening. But
many people cry and laugh watching the screen. When Dr. Rajkumar was
acting in one film he died on screen at the end of the story. People
in the theatre became very upset to see him die on screen. They tore
away some seats and damaged the theatre. Real loss for theatre owner
happened because of unreal death of famous actor on screen.
