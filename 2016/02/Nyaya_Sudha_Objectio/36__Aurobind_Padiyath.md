Namaste,
Right. Every one has "I" awareness but not that it is the same in
everything, until the teaching takes place. Also what is that which
everyone calls or deals as "I" is misunderstood to the physical body. Only
when a Guru explains the Sastravakhyartham and tells "Tat twam asi"
depending on the quality of the listener the true meaning is grasped. The
basic understanding of 'Twam asi as Aham asmi'  is in the vyavaharika level
will be understood but not the meaning that this Aham which is me and what
the word twam when I refer to anyone is ultimately directed to Tat which is
common and existing in everyone as Bhodhaswarupam. Because of which when
the teacher address some set of students "Tat twam asi" the understanding
of each one of that student is same and as "Tat Aham asmi" and that Tat is
the same in everyone which in me, which I understand as Aham.
