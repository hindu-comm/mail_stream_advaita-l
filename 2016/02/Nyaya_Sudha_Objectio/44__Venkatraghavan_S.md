Namaste,

Brahman is avAcyam in the sense that words cannot objectify it, because it
is the ultimate subject.

The very same shruti gives both negative definitions of Brahman as
"ashabdam, asparsham, arUpam avyayam tathA arasam" and  that it is to be
known by 'Neti, Neti', and also positive definitions such as 'satyam,
jnAnam, anantam'.

Samanvaya is required to reconcile what appears to the novice as opposing
viewpoints in the shruti, but in reality is one.

Regards,
Venkatraghavan
