Namaste Sri Venkatesh,

1) Sri Jayatirtha says "बन्धबाध एव मुक्तिरिति चेत् । नैवं श्रुतिसूत्रे वदतः
।
तरति शोकमित्यादौ विपरीताभिधानात्।"

The full quote is tarati shokam Atmavit, from Chandogya Upanishad. The
second part of this quote, "Atmavit", one who knows the self, is very
important. That is "he who knows the self crosses shoka(the ocean of
samsAra)").

If bondage were real, then *mere knowledge* of Atma will not liberate one
from bondage. It would *have* to involve some action to remove that real
bondage. That is some karma - either yajna, dAna, tapas, upAsana, bhakti
etc.

However, the upanishad repeatedly says only knowledge can relieve bondage,
attain the highest (brahmavid Apnoti param, T. Up.), etc. Here too,
Chandogya says that only a knower of Atma is relieved of bondage. If by
mere knowledge samsAra is ended, then the nature of samsAra must be
opposite to the nature of knowledge. Therefore, samsAra has to be the
nature of ignorance, which is the opposite of knowledge.

Ignorance of what? Of the self. How to gain such an ignorance-ending
knowledge? By knowing the truth of the underlying object, Atma. How to get
Atma jnAnam? By commencing its study - therefore, athAto brahma jignAsa is
valid.

2) Secondly, Sri Jayatitha says, "ब्रह्मज्ञानं जीवगतं बन्धं निवर्तयति’ इति
सौत्री
प्रयोजनोक्तिर्बन्धमिथ्यात्वं नापेक्षते" and "नहि शुक्तिकायामारोपितं रजतं
घटज्ञानान्निवर्तते ।"

Here he says that bandha mithyAtvam is not required for the advaitin's
statement that brahma jnAnam will release the jiva's bandhA. The reason he
quotes is that just like the knowledge of a pot will not remove the
illusion of silver seen in a shell. So he says that only jiva knowledge can
remove jiva bandha and brahman knowledge cannot remove jiva bandha.

This argument presupposes a real difference between a jIva and brahman. We
do not accept that such a difference is real. It is only because a shell is
different from pot, that the knowledge of the pot does not remove the
illusion of silver in shell. However, if there is no bhedA in the vastu
that is the adhishthAnam of the illusion, and the object of knowledge, then
by merely knowing the object of knowledge, the adhishthAnam of the illusion
is known and hence the illusion can be removed. Similarly, by knowing that
the jiva-hood of the jIva is unreal and that jiva is in reality brahman,
then brahma jnAna is sufficient to remove a mithyA bandha of a jiva.

Regards,
Venkatraghavan
