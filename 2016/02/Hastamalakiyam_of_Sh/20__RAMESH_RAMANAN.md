Dear Sahaji,
Pranams,

I am not aware of the Swayamprakasha commentary, but you might look up an Hindi commentary by Swami Purushottamananda Saraswathi of the Chinmaya Mission, which can be obtained from the Chinmmaya Mission in Powai,Mumbai, or its branch at Panchsheel Building, C Road, Churchgate, Mumbai. EMAIL: CCMT at VSNL.COM. The Hindi translation also has any relevant comments from saint Eknathji's utterances.If you do get the Swayamprakasha commentary, do please keep me informed at rameshramanan at yahoo.co.uk. Pranams, thanks and regards, Ramesh Ramanan,

 Dear list members,
Might any of you help me finding out a pdf of the Hastamalakiyam of Shankaracharya with a commentary by Svayamprakasha.
With best regards,Niranjan
