Dear Ramesh Ramanji and Girishji,My salutations!Yes, the work in question with English translation and the one that is available with CM would be of certain help, but I was looking for its copy with Svyamprakasha (I got it referred as manuscripts). I'll certainly let the list know if I come across it.

Best regards,Niranjan Saha

 Dear Sahaji,
 Pranams,

 I am
 not aware of the Swayamprakasha commentary, but you might
 look up an Hindi commentary by Swami Purushottamananda
 Saraswathi of the Chinmaya Mission, which can be obtained
 from the Chinmmaya Mission in Powai,Mumbai, or its branch at
 Panchsheel Building, C Road, Churchgate, Mumbai. EMAIL: CCMT at VSNL.COM. The
 Hindi translation also has any relevant comments from saint
 Eknathji's utterances.If you do get the Swayamprakasha
 commentary, do please keep me informed at rameshramanan at yahoo.co.uk.
 Pranams, thanks and regards, Ramesh Ramanan,
