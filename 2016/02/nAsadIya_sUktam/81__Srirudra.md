As per Upanishads the creator entered the creations.He is not a witness away from His creationsHe is the creation Anoraneeyam mahatho mahinam  further say the Upanishads to emphasise that the Brahman is All.The creation was avyaktham to begin with.Became vyaktham when Brahman so desired.Somewhat akin to the steady state theory.

>> The kaala or time came into being only on the advent of creation so That which is before the seemingly existing Jagat cannot be within the realm of time. But then why did the Rishi say "नो सत् आसीत्"? Because that is prior to both Sat and Asat and hence how can you even say that Sat was there prior to creation? Hence there is nothing wrong in saying it is "त्रिकाल आभादित सत्". Because the time and the Jagat in reality has not happened but like the rope and snake is an appearance. All the three states it was only rope and only rope existed. Similarly even the three states and the Jagat is an appearance in Chit.

As the creator of the snake on the rope, I am creating the experience of the snake by creation of a non-existing snake. But I was not knowing how I created the nonexistent snake at the same time I experienced the apparent reality of the snake too. For that experiencing to happen did a real snake come up and vanish? No. But the experience was real. So can you tell I knew how I created that snake? The Rishi is asking a similar doubt. Do not mix up with Hiranyagarbha etc here.
