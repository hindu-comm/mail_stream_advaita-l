Hari Om,
Namaste.

Swamy Tattvavidananda Saraswati gave talks (in English)  on Naasadiiya
Suktam in 3 sessions.

Please go to url

http://www.avgsatsang.org/hhstvs.html

and search for 'Naasadiiya'.

It would be nice if you can write down (and circulate within this group) as
to what Swamiji was saying about your doubts.

thank you and regards
