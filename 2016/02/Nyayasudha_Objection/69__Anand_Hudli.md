What about Upanishad statements, such as "na dRShTerdraShTAraM pashyeH",
"naiva vAcA na manasA prAptuM shakyo na cakShuShA", "yato vAco nivartante",
"na tatra sUryo bhAti", etc. Therefore, it is said "na hi buddhir brahma
vijAnAti" (vichAra sAgara).

nArayaNaM mahAjnEyam has to be interepreted in the sense of "AtmA vA are
draShTavyaH", not otherwise.

Anand
