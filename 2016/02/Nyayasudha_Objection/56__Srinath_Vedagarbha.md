Even Dvaitins are not saying in a sense Brahman is object. All they are
saying Brahman is jnEya and has IkShaNeattvaM and hence sUtrakAra's used it
as a hEtu in that sUtra Om IkShattEH  na aShabdaM Om. Other member was
denying that hEtu does not fit in Brahman.

What you are saying now is you are accepting jnEyatvam in Brahman, and that
is enough for the case.
