Namaste Sri Subbuji,

Regarding Sri PurandaradAsa's explanation for the limitation of words to
describe the infinite guNAs of Brahman, the context of where this vAkya
occurs in Taittiriya doesn't lend itself to that interpretation. Here the
context of shruti is when talking about Brahman as pancha kosha vilakshaNa,
and not occurring where the vibhUtis of the Lord are being described.

Going back to other arguments made in this context. Just because shruti
cannot refer to Brahman, it does not mean that it ceases to be a pramANa
for Brahman, and one cannot use shruti vAkya in support of advaita.

For shruti to be a pramANa, it is sufficient if it generates brahma pramA,
which it does, through mahAvAkya. This link between the need to referr to
mukhyArtha and pramaNatva does not hold.

The attempt made by the other member to paint advaita as unvedic, is
totally preposterous.

Thanks,
Venkatraghavan

Words along with the mind will fail to 'reach' Brahman because of Its
attributes, guṇas, are infinite.  They cannot be spoken of by words, fully.
Sri Purandaradasa, in the famous song 'jagadoddhāraṇa...' said:

.ನಿಗಮಕೆ ನಿಲುಕದ ಅಗಣಿತ ಮಹಿಮನ ಸುಗುಣಾಂತರಂಗನ ಆಡಿಸಿದಳೆಶೋದ.  [Yashodha cuddled
that Krishna whose greatness cannot be fully captured even by the Veda...]

And for the word 'aprameya', one can easily say: it is aprameya for the
worldly pramanas and not for the Veda. Of course, Shankara too, in that
commentary said this alone but went further to also clarify how the Veda
teaches Brahman, by the mode of negating what is superimposed.
