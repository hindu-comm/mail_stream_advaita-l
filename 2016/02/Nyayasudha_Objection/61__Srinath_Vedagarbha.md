Isn't it His vilakShaNattvaM itself His vibhUti?

This is the bigger epistemological question -- can we treat a source as
pramANa if it generates knowledge only by lakShya which is not known so
apriori by any other pramANa(s)?

How can even it generates  brahma pramA by lakShyartha, unless Brahman is
known apriori from other sources other than shruti? Can 'ganga' pada
generates the concept of bank in one's head if one were never ever seen a
bank by pratyaksha?

I am sorry, it was not meant in a negative connotation when "unvedic"  word
was used. What really meant was that it is an "what-if" analysis where if
the pramANa used is other than shruti, then such position would be
non-vedic. "Non-vedic" is better choice of word than "unvedic".
