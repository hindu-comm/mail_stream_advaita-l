Yes, but it is a stretch for the shruti to say " He has vilakshaNa vibhUti,
I cannot even describe his other vibhUtis with words"

Brahman is prati bodha viditam matam - it is the subject and the subject is
ever known, though not known correctly. Veda merely removes the wrong
superimpositions on that subject, allowing the subject to reveal itself.
Shruti's pramANatvam is in removing the obstacles/wrong notions that
obscure brahman.

see above.

It would, if we were saying that shruti was not a pramANa, but we are not
saying it. In fact, our very system of philosophy stems from the shruti
itself.
