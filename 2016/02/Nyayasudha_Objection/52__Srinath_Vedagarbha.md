Bit clarification needed here -- the context of this topic is not about
dispute about whether or not object of knowledge gained from experience
(anthakarNa/sAkshi) is object or subject. Instead the question is about
artha of a shabda/pada. We all have experience of type "I know myself" type
and the question is not about whether or not "I" as subject or object, but
the question is about atha of a shabda when someone says "You are a good
man".  What is that the pada "you" is referring to here is the question.
Obviously the artha of this pada-prayOga has to be object of knowledge so
gained from that shabda prayOga.

 vAchkatvaM/lakShyaM of the pada is not about description of the the
underlying object being conveyed, but rather connotation of what is being
conveyed. In the usage "you are a holy man" we are not trying to describe
underlying man, are we?

That is (another) objection of pUrvapaxin -- even in order to say "it
appears to be.." one needs some help from shabda pramANa, because our
immediate experience is that I am both subject and object in
self-referential knowledge of type "I know myself" .  But as soon as one
plead help from shada pramANa in order to do nirNaya "it appears to be...",
one will run into this issue of mukhyArtha vs. amukhyArtha.

This can be valid argument only if underlying hEtu  "Brahman has no
property" is true. But how do we say so definitively without engaging
shabda pramANa-s, such as shruti? Once we engage shabda to support that
hEtu, we run into the same issue. Since one cannot say one way or the other
about Brahman using non-shabda based pramANa-s, the very underlying hEtu
used in the above advaitasiddhi has no basis ---  so argues a pUrvapaxin.
