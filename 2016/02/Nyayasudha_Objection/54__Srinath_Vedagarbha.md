Why not?

Shruti is very explicit on this point when it said nArayaNaM mahAjnEyam.

In case if you were to object that jnEya brahman is amukhya brhahman, the
same shruti has emphasized it is talking about parama brahman only when it
says 'tad Eva brahma paramaM kavInaam'.

Shruti is contradicting such position.

This is valid argument only when underlying hEtu that Brahman being
substratum is true. But how do you know that fact? Obviously you are saying
so based on shruti as a pramANa. Otherwise brahman as substratum is not at
all given in pratykahAdi non-agamic pramAnas. Invoking shruti as a pramANa
is premature at this time as we are still not settled on vAchyatva of
Brahman from vedic texts. So, my argument about "you" pada in the sentence
"you are a good man" in its mukhyartha refers to you as a subject of that
knowledge.

As explained above this is not valid argument.

some pramANa(s) in his argument. If it is shabda pramANa (shruti/smirti
etc), pUrvapaxin's objection still stands and Madhusudhana has not
addressed it. If it is based on non-aagama pramaNa, pUrvapaxin has no
issues at all as such nirguNa brahman is unvedic after all for him. The
issue comes only when one says brahman's nirgunattvaM is vEdic.
