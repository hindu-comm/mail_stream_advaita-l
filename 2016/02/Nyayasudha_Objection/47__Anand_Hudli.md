Even in the case of "gangAyAM ghoShaH", unless a person already knows that
there is a river called gangA, there is no lakShyArtha required. Such a
person may think that there is a place called "gangA" and there is a
village in it. He/she may not realize that it is the river bank that is the
place where the village exists, not the river gangA itself. The word
"agangA" may indicate a river that is not gangA or something different.
There is no way of pinpointing a place as "agangA", nor can we take the
"mukhyArtha" of "agangA", because "a village not on the gangA" will not
yield any information about where the village is.
