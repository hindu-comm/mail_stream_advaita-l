Well, IkShattEH shabda is not ktin ptarEya, but rather Shiccp pratEya. The
usage "IkShattEH" is because IkShattE dAtu is in upanishad such as 'sa
EtAsmajjIvaghnAt parAtparaM purIShayaM puruShamIkShatE' , 'AtmanaEvAtmAnaM
paShEt" etc.

'IkShattE' shabda is also interpreted as "paShyati" (shruti such
as  'AtmanaEvAtmAnaM paShEt' ) based on "IkSha darShanAMkanayOH", dhruS
dhAtu as 'darShana' and this 'paShyati' is treated as kEvala-jnAna.

'IkShattEH' is the hEtu used in terms of 'IkShaNiyatvAt'.

In Shankara bashya too, this same hEtu is used in Brhamn while refuting
jagat kAraNattvaM to pradhAna (prakrti). Isn't it used the hEtu since
"Brahman creates with knowledge"....jagat kaaraNatvaM for pradhAna is
rejected?


Their bAShya on this sUtra is smooth and natural transition from previous
sUtra-s. From shAstra yOni concept to samanvayAt concept to avAchya-vAda
nirakaraNa. If Brahman is said to be shAstra yOni only, and to the question
on how that Brahman is shAstra gamya as so many virOdha exist in shAstras,
sUtrakAra introduce samanvaya aspect. For this, if one were to raise the
objection as how can Brahman is known from shAstra as Brahman is avAchya as
shruti itself has statements such yatO vAchO nivatraMtE etc, to refute this
pUrvapaxa,  Madhva argues sUtrakAra has explicitly used double negation as
na aShabdaM. You see how sangati has been smoothly tied between these
sUtra-s.

does not have any such adjunct/restriction as it is only in the sense of
ज्ञातव्यम्. One has to super impose that idea from outside.

ज्ञातव्यम् is not possible unless one already knows what is being
reminded/referenced. Since Brahman is known only from shAstra (even per
advaitic sUtra bhAshya on shAtra yOni sUtra) such referent in ज्ञातव्यम्
cannot be known unless such shAstra shabda-s have been understood in their
mukhyArtha only.
