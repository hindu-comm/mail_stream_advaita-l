The Veda itself resorts to 'lakṣaṇam-s' (not lakṣaṇā) when it uses the term
'Brahma'. For example, in the Taittiriya Upanishad, it says:

 यतो वाइमानि भूतानि जायन्ते । येन जातानि जीवन्ति । यत्प्रयन्त्यभिसंविशन्ति
। तद्विजिज्ञासस्व । तद्ब्रह्मेति ।

And  सत्यं ज्ञानमनन्तं ब्रह्म . Thus, without such lakṣaṇam-s it is
impossible to know what the word 'Brahma' means.

Even here, Brahman is denoted *only* through the function of 'īkṣaṇa'
(deliberation) even though the Veda teaches that It is niṣkriyam. In the
first case, Brahman is denoted through the function of jagat srishti, etc.
and by indicating that Brahman is not asatya, not jaḍa and not antavat.
Hence, the Veda itself resorts to the method of superimposing on Brahman
 some or the other function or attribute in order to enable us to
comprehend the word 'Brahma.'.  Without those 'add on' s there is no way
the Veda can use any word to indicate the vastu, whether it calls it by the
name Brahma, Chaturtham, Param, etc.  That such is only the means to denote
Brahman is also known to the Veda as it also teaches: na tatra vāk
gacchati' (kenopanishat), yatoi vācho nivartante, (Taittiriya) etc.
