नमस्ते,

A great Sanskrit scholar, seated on a carpet, was expounding 
the Shankara Bhashya of Gita Sloka "नैनं छिन्दन्ति शस्त्राणि नैनं दहति पावकः...." 
with all his intellectual gymnastics and references from various 
shAstrAs.  

A great avadhuta Sri.Gajanan Maharaj Ji of Shegaon was listening 
to the commentary expounded by this scholar.  Maharaj Ji had 
a habit of smoking like Swami Samarth of Akkalkot and Saibaba of
Shirdi.  Having sensed the puffed up arrogance of that scholar, 
Gajanan Maharaj threw His but of cigarette nearby. Dried grass that 
lay near caught the fire and the fire spread around. This engulfed the
dais which was occupied by the scholar.  

The pseudo-advaitin scholar threw the bhASya and ran out to 
save his life.

Those who are Atmavits, can only explain the nature of fear.  For
others, it is just an intellectual jugglery. 

regs,
sriram
