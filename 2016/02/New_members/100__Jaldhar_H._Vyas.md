----------

I tend to live by my version of an advaita philosophy. I do not consider
myself to be separate from anything or anyone around me. I do not believe
that I can control what happens to me. This way of living works well for me.


Kartik Kunchi
-------------

I have been interested in the Vedas, especially Vedanta, since long. I am
glad to note the increased activity of scholars on the web, of late, and
hope to learn more.


J Venkata Ramana
----------------

I am J.Venkata Ramana working as Sr. Accounts Officer in BHEL, 
Ramachandrapuram, Hyderabad.  I have been listening to Advaita Vedanta 
lectures in telugu rendered by Late Yellamraju Srinivasa Rao on advaita 
vedanta (Adi Sankara) works for the last 7 years.  I am very much interested 
in the subject and would like to receive mails, write ups/literature on the 
subject.
