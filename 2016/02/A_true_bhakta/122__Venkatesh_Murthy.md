This is correct only if the Nature of the God somebody is worshipping
is Saattvika. If somebody is worshipping a Rajasika or Taamasika form
like Demon Mahishasura and eating beef in JNU the true Bhaktas of
Saattvika Gods cannot agree.

Similarly if some God is saying kill all the non believers and you
will come to heaven and enjoy 200 virgins we cannot agree this God is
the same Divine God Ishwara for us.

The Bhagavad Gita has Slokas on Saatvika, Rajasika and Taamasika devotees.

yajante sattvika devan
yaksa-raksamsi rajasah
pretan bhuta-ganams canye
yajante tamasa janah 17-4

Men in the mode of goodness worship the demigods; those in the mode of
passion worship the demons; and those in the mode of ignorance worship
ghosts and spirits.
