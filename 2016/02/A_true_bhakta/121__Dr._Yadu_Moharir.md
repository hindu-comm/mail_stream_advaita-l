 Subject: [Advaita-l] A true bhakta

A true Bhakta never quarrels about the nature of God. The name or form that
you assign to God is of no consequence to him, for he knows that name or
form is not his essence. They exist for the sake of the particular bhakta
inclined towards it and the divine essence is the same across all names and
forms.

- JÃ gadguru Shankaracharya Sri Sri Sri Bharati Tirtha Mahasannidhanam
