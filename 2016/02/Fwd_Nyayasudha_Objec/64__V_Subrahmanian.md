The 4th pada is there, for Shankara, thus: Even though jagatkāraṇatvam for
Brahman is already established, along with the purvpaksha in the 5th sutra,
yet, since the Sankhyas hold that there are many vedic passages that
support them. Unless it is shown that such words/passages that he claims
are not in his support but they mean something else, the brahma
jagatkāraṇatvam will not be completely established. Hence the 4th pada. In
the Ikshati adhikarana only the claim that vedic passages support sankhya
has been refuted. Here, in the 4th pada, those passages mean something else
- is being shown.

See the above.

Advaitins also see that sutra as teaching svarupa lakshanam of Brahman,
that is jijnāsya brahman.  The 'yataḥ' indicates this. Without Brahman
being involved in creation, creation emerges 'from' brahman, owing to the
maya shakti. And that source from which such emergence of world is taught
by the veda, is Brahman that is jijnāsya.  Thus, advaitins take that as
svarupa lakshana as well. Since it is difficult to know which brahman is to
be known, the lakshana is given, as adhyaropa.  Like shākhā-chandra.

They do say.  They claim many words in the veda are in their favour. For
example, the word avyakta in the Kathopanishat  '....avyaktāt puruṣaḥ
paraḥ' is their pradhanam.  In fact it is said charvakas too claim veda
pramanya: sa vā eṣa purusho annarasamayaḥ.  Bauddhas claim: asad vā idam
agre āsīt...is in their favor.

In the Dvaita interpretation too: tat ikṣateḥ is not enough. Brahman is not
seen/realized by all. So you will have to add: mumukṣubhiḥ.

Apart from that, in fact that hetu as given out by you is redundant. There
was no objection to the Brahman being ashabdam since in the shāstra
yonitvāt itself it was clearly established that Veda is the source to know
brahman and veda is itself brought out by brahman. So,  the shabdatva of
Brahman has  been established eminently by the third sutra itself. Where is
the need to question that now in the fifth sutra, even after the grand
samanvaya has been done?  So, there is no worth in the dvaita
interpretation of the ikshati sutra. It ends up making the entire fifth
sutra redundant. You claim laghutva but did not realize the asādhutva,
aprayojakatva, vyarthatva dosha of the very sutra you have ended up
establishing.
