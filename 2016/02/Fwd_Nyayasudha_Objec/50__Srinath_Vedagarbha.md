Well, one could argue the presence of 'iti' (in brahmEti) to introduce word
"brahma" is the direct evidence of shruti's intention of mukhyArtha. Have
anyone uses gangEti to introduce tIra?

One question remains so --- are the terms "satyaM", "jnAnaM" and "anantaM"
vAchaka or lakShya? Since per advaitic view no pada can denote by
mukhyartha, it follows that they must necessarily be lakShya. If so, then
question would be what is it about it is drawing our lakShya? If you use
another pada to indicate that vastu in your answer, then the same question
applies to that second pada. Hence we have anvasthA.

Above problem is from the vastu perspective. Now, from the pada perspective
also we are not without problem. What is the mukhyArtha of those above
terms? Who is being referred in their mukhyArtha by shruti? They cannot be
simple attributes without having any paxa in which they have been
adjudicated.

On this I have a side question. In siddhanta above sUtra is commented from
brahman perspective (iksana is attributed to brahmn). However in
pUrava-paxa it is attributed from jIva's perspective. Their argument is as
follow;

Anvaya of that sUtra per pUrvapaxa is "(tat) aSabdaM na IkShatE". Per
advaita anvaya would be "aShabdaM (pradAnaM) kAraNaM na | kAraNasya
IkShatEh".

Objection is too many padas needs to be get adhyAhAra-ed (do not know
English term for this!) in advaitic anvaya.

Also, in advaitic commentory sUtra pada "aShabdaM" is used as paxAvAchaka
pada as "aShabdaM hi tat" with imagining (unnecessarily so) a totally new
sAdyavAchaka pada "kAraNaM. Also in this anvaya one needs to imagine new
hEtuvachaka pada kAraNa, which is not in sUtra.

Please can anyone point me to any rejoinder to above objection from
classical works in advaita?.
