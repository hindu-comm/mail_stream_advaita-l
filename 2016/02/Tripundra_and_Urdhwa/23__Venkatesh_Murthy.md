 Namaste

Someone has made a nice observation. If you see Shaivites with
Tripundra on the forehead the top line looks like Vishnu sleeping on
Adi Sesha the two bottom lines. If you see a Iyengar's forehead with
Urdhwa Pundra it looks like Siva's Trishula.

Shaivites are wearing Vishnu mark and Vaishnavas are wearing Siva's mark.

This is proving the Advaitic statement of Siva Vishnu Aikya.
