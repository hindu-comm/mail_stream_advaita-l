Namaste,

It is not accepted by all that Shankara Bhagavadpada composed the Saundaryalahari.

 Shankara
 Bhagavatpada's Soundarya Lahari mentions Hadi vidya(Ha
 Sa Ka
 La ...) first and then Kadi vidya.(Ka
 E I La ...).
 (I know Laksmidhara's
 commentary makes strenuous effort to reverse the
 order but many do not accept it. His
 commentary
 appears to be a case of text
 torturing.) In such a case, how could
 Sankara comment on a book which is not his
 first choice of
 Panchdasi mahamantra?
 regards,
 Sarma.
