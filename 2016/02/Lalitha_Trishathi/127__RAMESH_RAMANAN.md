Pranams,
Dear Ramaniji,
Sri Ramakrishna Math, Chennai, has published a Tamil translation by Sri Anna N.Subramanian (he was their best ever Tamil translator and it is really a pity that he is no more). He has also given comparisons with texts like Shivananda Lahari, Bhagavad Gita, Upanishads, Saundharya Lahari, Shakti Mahimna Sthotram, Varivasyaa Rahasyam, Thevaaram and Thirumandhiram, I do not think the book contains any commentary by Sri Shankara, though. You can check the Sri Ramakrishna Math and Chinmaya Missson websites for Sri Shankra's commentary on the same. Pranams once again, Ramesh Ramanan.

 Namasthe,Can I get the meanings as explained in Adi Shankara bhashyam on Lalitha Trishathi from some body who has learnt the Lalitha Trishathi with meanings. I am not able to search the advaita list as there is no search feature.
Ramani
