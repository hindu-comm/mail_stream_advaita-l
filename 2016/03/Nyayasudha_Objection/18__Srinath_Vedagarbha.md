God in other religion/culture is not same as God of Dvaitin's. Former is
based on pourusheya scriptures, while later one is aporushEya veda based.
Just because both gods are called "God" it does not mean they are the same.
Comparison based on this aspect and rejecting bhEda between God and jIva is
quite flawed.

My argument using presence of atheism was directed towards your earlier
assertion that vEdas cannot teach difference between Brahman and Jiva as
such difference is already known by pratyaksha. If Brahman (and Jiva also)
know by pratyaksha, then there is no atheism exist, for the reason that
they accept only what is known from pratyaksha. Thus, there is no value in
denying bhEda based on pratyaksha argument.

Such distinction again must be coming only from vEda itself. A position
which hold some part of veda is pramANa while other is not,  is again falls
under pramEya category. Such pramEya must be coming from pramANa texts and
not applicable on pramANa itself. You have it reversed.

How does vEda recognizes people have delusion about Ishwara, for given that
fact that itself only introduce us to that concept? We could have been
better if so such attempt is made by veda. Why introduce something not know
from other sources and call it as a delusion?

I think you are confused between "Ishwara" as a general concept from other
religion.

In that case  your original argument (to deny bhEda) based on bhEda being
known earlier (via prayaksha) is flawed?

That's the reason one should not take only lakshyArtha unless there exist
vAchyartha for the pada.

Thank you for your participation so far. One point though -- I am not
pursuing Dvaita per se, but a student of comparative study and wanted to
learn from the scholars here how these things are argued and defended.
