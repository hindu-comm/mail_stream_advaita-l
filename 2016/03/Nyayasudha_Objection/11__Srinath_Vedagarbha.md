"nEti" can be understood to be referring to both niruguNa vastu or
guNa-pUrNa vastu. In these two extreme edge cases only "nEti" can thought
of referring to other than known vatus. Given this, unless one accepts B as
guNa-pUrNa, other niravakASha vAkyas such as "brihintO asmin hi guNaH' etc
cannot be addressed .  If "nEti" is thought to be Brahman without any
guNa-s, then that position leads to shrutahAna or ashruta kalpana flaw.

property or no property, that has to come only after resolving
vAchyatva/avAchyatva issue. This resolution must be based on considering
both type of vAkhyas -- which says on both sides. As said earlier, both
types can be harmonized only in vastu which is very rich in its attributes
(guNa-pUrNa) such as Meru. Of course, if one starts with stand that B has
no property, only one type of vAkhyas (which says B is ajnEya etc) can be
accommodated.

Then other set of vAkyas has to forego and thereby step into shrutahAna
territory!

That's fine, but the issue comes when one out to do aikya of this "I" (tvam
pada ) to tat-pada, for how can anyone know about referent of "tat" pada
given that it is not vAchya nor lakshya ?

That's fine, buy again, what happens to other set of vAkya-s?
