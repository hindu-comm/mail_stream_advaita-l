The topic of Bheda-shrutis vis a vis the abheda-shrutis is discussed in
detail in the advaitasiddhi. Suffice it to say that, one solution is to
accept Bheda-shrutis, those vAkyas of the shruti that seem to deal with
duality, as describing vyAvahArika bheda, since there cannot be be any
bheda at the pAramArthika level. Bheda shrutis play a role similar to the
role played by arthavAdas in the context of a vidhi, vide mImAMsA sUtra -
vidhinA tu ekavAkyatvAt stutyarthatvena vidhInAM syuH, 1.2.7. Just as
arthavAda vAkyas are not independent pramANas but do help by supporting and
commending the enjoined act (vidhi), bheda-shrutis too serve the purpose
of supporting the abheda-shrutis. Taken independently, they are not
pramANas for revealing Brahman. Hence, there is no shrutahani.
