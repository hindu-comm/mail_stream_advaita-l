If you say Dvaiti God is not same as Islamic God or Christian God or
some tribal God and the contribution of Veda is to show this
difference between different Gods it is an insult to Veda. All these
Gods may be different but there is also some common base between all
Gods. The common base is all people believe God is higher Power than
Man. Because if God is not higher Power why should Man worship Him? In
this belief Dvaiti's God and Islamic God and Christian God and tribal
God are all the same. If Veda is telling this to us it is wasting our
time.

Agreed Pratyaksha is not showing difference between God and Jeeva. But
Pratyaksha with Logic can give two alternatives. One is this world has
no higher Power controlling us. It is all materialist actions and
reactions. This is atheist path. Another one is there is a Higher
Power controlling the World and us. This is the theist path. For both
Veda is not necessary. So what is the contribution of Veda? Simply to
give some details of this God like having four hands and shanka chakra
and so on?
This is a childish theory.
