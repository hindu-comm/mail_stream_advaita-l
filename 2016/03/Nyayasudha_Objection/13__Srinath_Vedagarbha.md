This exactly is what dvaitins do not agree. Bheda or no bhEda at the
ultimate level has to come only after doing samanvya of both type of
vAkya-s as these vAkyas are our starting point. Instead what's been done is
we decide the hEtu first that "since there cannot be be any bheda at the
pAramArthika level" type and then using this kind of hEtu one is explaining
away bhEda vAkyas as arthavAda.

arthavAda is one of tAtparya linga-s, and can be applied only when
vAchyatva of pada-s in vAkhya is accepted. It cannot be done so in the paxa
where all pada-s are considered as lakShya only.
