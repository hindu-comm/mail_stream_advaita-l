Dvaita admits bheda is known by pratyaksha:

//The satyavada of bheda is not only cognised by pratyaksa and anumana but
it is affirmed by Sruti more than once. Satyam bhida sathyam bhida satyam
bhida is the emphatic statement of Sruti. This bheda is five-fold.

1. Between Jiva and Iswara
2. Between Jada and Iswara
3. Between Jiva and Jiva
4. Between Jada and Jiva
5. Between Jada and Jada

The difference between Jiva and Isvara continues even after liberation.
This is made clear in the sruti passages.//

//To know Jivesvarabheda, one has to know both Jiva and Isvara. Though the
jiva is known by Pratyaksa, Isvara is not known either by Pratyaksa or by
Anumana. //

//Bheda that is established by Pratyaksa and Anumana, when also stated in
bhedasrutis establishes its validity more firmly.//

//The role of Pratyaksa Pramana in comprehending the reality is examined
and its priority over other Pramanas is pointed out. //

So, the above says that pratyaksha is pramana for knowing reality!!
