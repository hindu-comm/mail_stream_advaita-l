The source of above is not quite clear on the analysis. Aham pratIti as "I"
notion is pratyaksha siddha, no doubt, but that pratIti ends there. Other
details such as, whether it is other than this BMI or not, whether it
persists when this body dies, whether it has any guNa or not, etc etc...
are not known from pratyaksha. What to compare this with Ishwara?

Madhva says in Vishnu-tattva-vinirNaya --

na cha jIveshvarabhedaH siddhaH ityanuvAdakatvaM bhedavAkyAnAm.h  |
AgamaM vinA IshvarasyaivAsiddheH  |

"It cannot be said that the bhedavAkyas are repetitive (of the
obvious) on the ground that the jIva-Ishvara-bheda is already well
established (from pratyaksha or anumAna, says TIkA). That is because
Ishvara is not established without the aid of Agama".

The TIkA there explicitly mentions that the cognition of this bheda
requires 'IshvarapratIti'.


I would suggest one should go to classical works instead of relaying on
website to better understand the pUrvapakshi.
