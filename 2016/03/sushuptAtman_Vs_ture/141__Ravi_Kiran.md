Nice sharing these contemplation..

There are several references to sushupti (as mokSha dRSTAnta) in
Brihadaranyaka bhAshya, which I find useful for my contemplation..

One of them quoted here ..निर्विशेषमद्वैतम् अलुप्तचिद्रूपज्योतिः  (Br.Up -
4.4.6 - Sri Sankara bhAshya)

स कथमेवम्भूतो मुच्यत इत्युच्यते — यो हि सुषुप्तावस्थमिव निर्विशेषमद्वैतम्
अलुप्तचिद्रूपज्योतिःस्वभावम् आत्मानं पश्यति, तस्यैव अकामयमानस्य कर्माभावे
गमनकारणाभावात् प्राणा वागादयो नोत्क्रामन्ति । किन्तु विद्वान् सः इहैव
ब्रह्म, यद्यपि देहवानिव लक्ष्यते ; स ब्रह्मैव सन् ब्रह्म अप्येति । यस्मात्
न हि तस्य अब्रह्मत्वपरिच्छेदहेतवः कामाः सन्ति, तस्मात् इहैव ब्रह्मैव सन्
ब्रह्म अप्येति न शरीरपातोत्तरकालम् ।

‘But the man who does not desire,’ etc. How does such a man attain
liberation? This is being stated: He who sees the Self, as in the state of
profound sleep, as undifferentiated, one without a second, and as the
constant light of Pure Intelligence—only this disinterested man has no work
and consequently no cause for transmigration; therefore his organs such as
that of speech do not depart. Rather this man of realisation is Brahman in
this very life, although he seems to have a body. *Being but Brahman, he is
merged in Brahman.* Because he has no desires that cause the limitation of
non-Brahmanhood, therefore ‘being but Brahman he is merged in Brahman’ in
this very life, not after the body falls. A man of realisation, after his
death, has no change of condition—something different from what he was in
life, but he is only not connected with another body. This is what is meant
by his becoming ‘merged in
<http://www.wisdomlib.org/hinduism/book/the-brihadaranyaka-upanishad/d/doc122058.html#page-721>Brahman’;
for if liberation was a change of condition, it would contradict the unity
of the Self that all the Upaniṣads seek to teach. And liberation would be
the effect of work, not of knowledge—which nobody would desire.
