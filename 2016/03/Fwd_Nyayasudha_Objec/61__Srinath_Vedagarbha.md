Context of jagat kAraNa nirAkaraNa (for pradAna) does not go well with
samanvaya context. The very demand/akAnkSha of sutrakAra's for doing
samanvaya in previous sUtra by saying 'tattu samanvyat' , it means tat
(Brahman who was introduced in previous ones) has to have derive from doing
sam-anvaya of shAstra (which is again from yet previous sUtra) by clearing
all contradiction. So, at the time of tattu samanvaya sUtra, we are still
talking about shabda shAstra level, which is epistemological level only.
Where is the question of jagat kaaraNa here? for it is the ontological
detail comes only after textual analysis and resolving all epistemological
contradictions.
