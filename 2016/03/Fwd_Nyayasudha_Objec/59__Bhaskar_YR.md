avAchyattvam/aShabdattvaM, it is illogical to hold such knowing through the shabda pramana is possible. This is the argument.

I think you must be aware of shankara's clarification with regard to this in samanvayAdhikaraNa bhAshya.  Here pUrvapaxi raises an objection : if brahman is not an object of any action, then it cannot be maintained that the shAstra (Agama) is the means (pramANa) of knowing it.  For this vedAnti / siddhAnti clarifies : not so, for the shAstra purports are there to wipe off the distinctions superimposed (adhyArOpita) on brahman by avidyA.  For that matter shAstra does not indeed propose to teach brahman as such and such an object, but it (shAstra) teaches brahman as no object at all, being the inner most self and removes all distinctions created by avidyA such as the jnAtru, jneya and jnAna.  Elsewhere shankara clarifies Atman or self as is well-known is no adventitious thing for any one and it is not pramANa siddha, it is svayaM-siddha (self-established).

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
