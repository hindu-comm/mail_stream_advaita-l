That is also I am saying above. In any refutation hEtu must be acceptable
to both parties then only pUrvapaxin's sAdhya could be refuted.
IkShaNiattva is a hEtu which is acceptable for both dvaitins and advaitins,
but what is being refuted is advaitin's sAdhya of Brahman being
aShabdam/avAchyaM.

Correct, this hEtu part.

Even though you are not saying it directly, but with the position of
avAchyattvam/aShabdattvaM, it is illogical to hold such knowing through the
shabda pramana is possible. This is the argument.

As explained above, hEtu is not the dispute between two parties (and that
is the very prerequisite in any argument), but the issue is only with
advaitin's sAdhya of Brahman's avAchyattvam. That exactly is the sAdhya
sUtrakAra denying when He say na aShbdhaM. otherwise He would have directly
stated correct sAdhya as "ShabdaM", but instead He uses na-kAra exclusively
to drive home His point.

As explained in my other mail, doing samanvaya between these seemingly
contradictory shruti statements is not at all an issue.
