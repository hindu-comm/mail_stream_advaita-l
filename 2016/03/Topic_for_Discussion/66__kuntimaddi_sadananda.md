  PraNAms to all 

 Some topics for discussion -
 all centered on self-realization. 

 Some say - Vedanta study is not sufficient, One
 has to experience it. What does that mean? 

 Some say it is object-less
 awareness - Is that possible?

 What exactly means nirvikalpaka samaadhi - Is
 that required for self-realization. 

 What is akhandaakaara jnaana vRitti means? 

 Currently I am doing the 9th
 Chapter of Panchadashi - where Vidyaranya talks about -
 nirguna brahma upaasana - which may be Oxymoron. 

 Just some thoughts to
 ponder.

 Hari Om!
 Sada
