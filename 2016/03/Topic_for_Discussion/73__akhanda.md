Sadaji,

PraNAms.

 > What exactly means nirvikalpaka samaadhi - Is that required for 
self-realization.  Some say - Vedanta study is not sufficient, One has 
to experience it. What does that mean?

Here is the sentence from the Vivekachudamani that clearly says that 
nirvikalpaka samaadhi is a discrete step before self-realization.

Sloka 362. When the mind, thus purified by constant practice, is merged 
in Brahman, then Samaadhi passes on from the Savikalpa to the Nirvikalpa 
stage, and leads directly to the realization of the Bliss of Brahman, 
the One without a second.

Hence Nirvikalpa samaadhi leads directly for self-realization, and 
self-realization itself is therefore a step different from samaadhi. It 
must therefore occur at a specific point in time in an individual's life 
(as stated elsewhere, via the akhandaakaara vrtti generated through the 
mahaavaakya) and is therefore an experience and not simply understanding 
the Vedantic texts.

As to whether nirvikalpaka samaadhi is a compulsorily required step, 
that is not clear.

Hari Om,
Anil (Gidwani)
