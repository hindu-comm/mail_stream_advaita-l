That is the question. >>.



In advaita nirvikalapa samaadhi  is Chaitanyam/Atman/Brahman  itself.  “
Nirvikalapa”  is “ absence of differences such as vastu,attributes etc.” .
It It is not “thoughtlessness”. The advaitic concept is different from the
Patanjali Yogic concept. Reference could be made to Bhashya on Mandukya
karika 3-33



<< अकल्पकं सर्वकल्पनावर्जितम्, अत एव अजं ज्ञानं ज्ञप्तिमात्रं ज्ञेयेन
परमार्थसता ब्रह्मणा अभिन्नं प्रचक्षते कथयन्ति ब्रह्मविदः ।



( Translation Swami Gambhirananda ) <<The knowers of Brahman प्रचक्षते
 (prachakShate), say ; that absolute ज्ञानं (j~nAnaM) , Knowledge ; that is
अकल्पकं (akalpakaM ) , devoid of all imagination ( non conceptual ) ; and
is therefore अजं (ajaM), birthless ; is  ज्ञेयाभिन्नं (j~neyAbhinnaM),
nondifferent from the knowable, identified with Brahman, the absolute
Reality.>>
