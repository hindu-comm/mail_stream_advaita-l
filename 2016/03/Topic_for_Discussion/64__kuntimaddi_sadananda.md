PraNAms to all 

Some topics for discussion - all centered on self-realization. 

Some say - Vedanta study is not sufficient, One has to experience it. What does that mean? 

Some say it is object-less awareness - Is that possible?

What exactly means nirvikalpaka samaadhi - Is that required for self-realization. 

What is akhandaakaara jnaana vRitti means? 

Currently I am doing the 9th Chapter of Panchadashi - where Vidyaranya talks about - nirguna brahma upaasana - which may be Oxymoron. 

Just some thoughts to ponder.

Hari Om!
Sada

Hari Om!
