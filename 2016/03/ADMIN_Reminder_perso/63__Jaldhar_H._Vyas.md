While it is only natural that list members will argue their views 
enthusiastically, this must not cross the line into personal attacks. 
Neither ones personal sadhana nor the gaurava of Advaita Vedanta is 
enhanced in any way by such actions.

We do not want personal attacks in advaita-l and anyone who persists in 
making them will be sanctioned.
