Subject: Re: [Advaita-l] [advaitin] Why only jagat is mithya and jeeva is
brahman !!??
To: Ravi Kiran <ravikiranm108 at gmail.com>


Sri Ravi Kiran Ji,



Reg  <<one is at paramartha and other is vyavaharika ? why compare or
mention them ? what purpose it achieves or issue it solves ?

how it is useful in the current thread of discussion ?  >>,



both the pramanas are vyavaharika only. In fact the question  has been put
forth as a strong argument in favour of the proposition that jagat is
sathya. But the question itself is invalid due to following reasons.



Pratyaksha is not a pramana for Brahman. Only Agama (in the form of
Mahavakyas ) is.



Mithya does not contradict pratyaksha because part of the definition of
mithya is that for anything to be considered mithya, it must in the first
place conform to pratyaksha pramana.



So where is the contradiction of pramanas??



Regards
