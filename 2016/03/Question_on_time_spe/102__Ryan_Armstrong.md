Namaste Sanju Nath

>From experience, I have a few comments and observations.
Firstly, (and since I have no Hindi I can only really comment on English)
"lesser" languages cannot convey the essence of a subject in the same way
that Sanskrit can.
When approaching scriptures, Sanskrit provides a clear and unambiguous
statement.
Where it is not clear, the great sages have provided clarification.
It is my opinion that Sanskrit is the purest vehicle for expressing Truth.

I have a personal love for the Panini system of grammar and study it
regularly.
However, in studying a subject so fine, with its insights into the universe
and its structure, it is easy for ahankara to claim the knowledge.
It is easy for one to become "big headed", "holier than thou" or simply
believe that one is in some way "better".
And it seems that this is what Adi Shankara is warning against.

The first verse of the work you quote is :

भजगोविन्दं भजगोविन्दं
गोविन्दं भजमूढमते ।
सम्प्राप्ते सन्निहिते काले
नहि नहि रक्षति डुकृञ्करणे ॥ १॥

Worship the Lord, Worship the Lord, Worship the Lord - You of deluded mind!

When death's fateful time approaches, the recitation of grammatical
rules will not help you!

I have taken to reciting this when I embark on the study of Sanskrit.
This serves as a reminder that the study is not an end in itself, but a
tool for understanding Truth.
There is a place for all things in creation.
But claiming knowledge, no matter how fine, is nonetheless a claim and
something tying one to avidya and samsAra

I would not advocate against learning the grammar, but not as a direct
means to Truth.

I hope that this helps you...
Kind Regards
Ryan
