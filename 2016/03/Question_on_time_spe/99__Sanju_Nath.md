Pranams:

Given the advice in BhajGovindam (reproduced below) how much time should we
prioritize for learning Sanskrit versus meditation/reading English
translations/Svadhayaya/other Sadhana?

In the time it takes to read grammar, one can use English/Hindi
translations to understand better some slokas too.   There is no dearth of
reflection and understanding opportunity here.

The fear is that I'm being a mudha when I choose to pickup a grammar book
in comparison to other options.

Thanks,
Sanju.

During his stay in Kashi, Adi Shankaracharya noticed a very old man
studying the rules of Sanskrit by Panini.  Shankara was touched with
pity at seeing the plight of the old man spending his years at a mere
intellectual accomplishment while he would be better off praying and
spending time to control his mind.



मूढः कश्चन वैयाकरणो
डुकृञ्करणाध्ययन धुरिणः ।
श्रीमच्छम्कर भगवच्छिष्यै
बोधित आसिच्छोधितकरणः ॥ ३२॥

Thus a silly grammarian lost in rules cleansed of his narrow
vision and shown the Light by Shankara's apostles.
