But there is also Yuga Dharma. In Ramayana there are saying Rama was
offered bulls. It was Treta Yuga. In Kali Yuga some things are not
allowed like if one brother dies the surviving brother can take his
wife. Eating beef is not allowed in Kali Yuga. If you say we can eat
beef the same argument should be made for accepting dead brother's
wife.

In Mahabharata they also say in very ancient times there was no
marriage. Any man was allowed to take away any woman. Now if you use
the same beef eating argument what will you get? Will you abolish
marriage system? Imagine what will happen then.

The moral lesson is some things were done in the ancient times but
they should not be done now.
