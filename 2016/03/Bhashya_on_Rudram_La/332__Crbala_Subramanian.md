Sri Praveen

Late. Brahma Sri Meemamsa Vidhwan Sri E. Balasubrahmanya Sastrigal of
Sanskrit college, Mylapore Chennai, has written a bhasya for Mahanyasa.

That covers Laghu Nyasa as well. Don't know whether the text is still
available or not.

But not sure of other text which has in detail.

If my memory is right even the Sri Anna N Subrahmanya Iyer bhasya of Sri
Rudram published by Ramakrishna Mutt Mylapore also has these bhasya but in
Tamil Script.

Thanks
C.R.Bala
