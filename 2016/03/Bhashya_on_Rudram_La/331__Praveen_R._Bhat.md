Namaste,

Does anyone know if there is a bhAShya available on laghu nyAsa of rudram,
be it by Sayanacharya, Bhattabhaskaracharya or anyone else? I am unable to
find the same online or in print.

If the above is not available, could some one guide me to some bhAShya on
some other nyAsa, if any?

Thanks in advance,
--Praveen R. Bhat
