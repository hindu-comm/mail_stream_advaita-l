*Purva mimamsa is not holding the upanishad portions as paurusheya.  They
hold those portions also as veda alone.  Their view is that this portion
that does not talk of any action, is to be deemed arthavāda, a praise of
the doer or devatā to which actions are addressed. Shankara only showed
that both the action part and the knowledge part of the veda are not
contradicting each other and that each had its own area of application.  *
Any quote or reference supporting this? I mean directly from the
commentators?
