This is the prelude to the fourth sutra: tattu samanvayāt.  Shankara says:

कथं पुनर्ब्रह्मणः शास्त्रप्रमाणकत्वमुच्यते यावता आम्नायस्य
क्रियार्थत्वादानर्थक्यमतदर्थानाम् इति क्रियापरत्वं शास्त्रस्य प्रदर्शितम्।
अतो वेदान्तानामानर्थक्यम् अक्रियार्थत्वात् कर्तृदेवतादिप्रकाशनार्थत्वेन वा
क्रियाविधिशेषत्वम् उपासनादिक्रियान्तरविधानार्थत्वं वा। न हि
परिनिष्ठितवस्तुस्वरूपप्रतिपादनं संभवति
प्रत्यक्षादिविषयत्वात्परिनिष्ठितवस्तुनः तत्प्रतिपादने च हेयोपादेयरहिते
पुरुषार्थाभावात्। अत एव सोऽरोदीत् इत्येवमादीनामानर्थक्यं मा भूदिति विधिना
त्वेकवाक्यत्वात्स्तुत्यर्थेन विधीनां स्युः इति
स्तावकत्वेनार्थवत्त्वमुक्तम्। मन्त्राणां च इषे त्वा इत्यादीनां
क्रियातत्साधनाभिधायकत्वेन कर्मसमवायित्वमुक्तम्। अतो न क्वचिदपि वेदवाक्यानां
विधिसंस्पर्शमन्तरेणार्थवत्ता दृष्टा उपपन्ना वा। न च परिनिष्ठिते
वस्तुस्वरूपे विधिः संभवति क्रियाविषयत्वाद्विधेः
तस्मात्कर्मापेक्षितकर्तृदेवतादिस्वरूपप्रकाशनेन
क्रियाविधिशेषत्वं वेदान्तानाम्। अथ प्रकरणान्तरभयान्नैतदभ्युपगम्यते तथापि
स्ववाक्यगतोपासनादिकर्मपरत्वम्। तस्मान्न ब्रह्मणः शास्त्रयोनित्वमिति
प्राप्ते उच्यते  ...

The highlighted part says that the view of the mimamsaka is that the
vedanta part (upanishads) of the veda is still subsidiary to action by
revealing the nature of the kartā devatā etc.  This is how Shankara
presents the jaimini sutra and the view of the mimamsaka on that sutra.

” आम्नायस्य क्रियार्थत्वादानर्थक्यमतदर्थानाम् ” { जैमिनि सूत्र 1 / 2 / 1 }
यह मीमांसा का मुख्य सिद्धान्त है कि वेद याग आदि क्रिया परक है , जो वेद भाग
याग आदि क्रियाओं को नहीं करता वह निष्फल है । ” स्वर्गकामो यजेत् ” स्वर्गकाम
पुरुष याग करे यह विधि है । जो वेद वाक्य कर्म का प्रतिपादन नहीं करते वे भी
अर्थवाद रूप से साक्षात् वा परम्परया विधि से ही सम्बन्धित है । ”
