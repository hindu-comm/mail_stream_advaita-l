Namaste,

Actually what Patanjali was saying is "Chittavritti-nirodha" (i.e., to control the fluctuations in thought, i.e., to control the wavering mind). Having received the knowledge from the Shastras and the guru (sometimes there may even be more than one guru to attain the samyak jnana) and then one has to concentrate on the the "aroop, ashabda - - - - " state of the Lord, as Lord Rama was telling Hanumana in Upanishad.

 From : Dear Sri Balagopal
 Ramkrishnan,
  Very well said, Sir!
 This is what Sri Shankara is teaching. What understanding
 you are having now is perfectly correct. Please refer to Sri
 Shankara's commentary on Sutra 1-1-4 of Brahmasutra.
  
 With warm
 andrespectful regards,Sreenivasa Murthy

 Discussion: What is Nirvikalpaka Samaadhi?
 
 Namaste Sada
 Ji,
 Nirvikalpa samadhi and objectless
 awareness is not required for self realisation.
 If the self realisation has to be
 'gained' / 'worked' / 'taken' or
 'received', it tantamounts to 'anitya' and
 not 'aatma' which is permanent.
 The
 shaastra and the guru removes the obstacles and the light of
 aatma which was already there is recognised.
 Hope I am nearing the correct position.
 Regards
 Balagopal

 2)Some say it is object-less awareness - Is
 that possible?

 No. One can
 only turn one's 'attention' to the already
 experiencing 'awareness'. It is understanding the
 'vrutti' of understanding itself ! It's the
 'SUBJECT' himSELF ! - NOT an object
 ------------------------------------

 Balagopalji - PraNAms

 When they say it is
 object-less awareness, they are not objectifying it - They
 imply - going beyond the mind where there is no
 subject-object duality - by eliminating all thoughts, which
 are objectifyable entities - Hence a thought-less state -
 where three is no object - yet awareness -some say it is
 similar to gap or silence between two thoughts where I alone
 am there. Some think that (as per Ramana Maharshi's
 teaching also) if you have no more thoughts (as thoughts are
 centered on objectifiable entities) there is only conscious
 entity the self without any notion of subject-object
 duality. Hence the idea is to stop thinking and reach a
 state of absence of any thought and be aware of that state -
 That constitute the object-less awareness. The question
 posed is, is it possible, and is it required for
 self-realization. This comes from Patanjali yoga - chitta
 vRitti nirodhaH. Question is - Is that what is needed for
 self-realization? 

 By the
 by I saw your post in the advaital list also.
 --------------------------------

 3)What exactly means
 nirvikalpaka samaadhi - Is that required for
 self-realization.

 SELF
 stands already realized. Experiences, including the
 'nirvikalpaka samaadhi' are not negated, but are not
 considered as 'SELF realisation' as every vrutti is
 'dvaitam' - a division of 'experiencer' and
 'experienced'; whereas 'brahman' is
 'akartha' and 'abhoktha'.


 -----------------
 Nirvikalpaka
 samaadhi has been discussed extensively even by Vidyaranya.
 Vikalapa is thought - hence nirvikalapa samaadhi is same
 thing stated above - a thought less state of mind - that is
 one explanation coming from Pataangali yoga - or is it
 something different as per advaita. That is the question.


 I know Subbuji had
 discussed this once somewhere - may be he can also throw
 some light on that.

 Hari Om!
