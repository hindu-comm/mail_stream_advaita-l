It would be interesting to note that Shankaracharya in the BSB 3.3.1 has
given the following example to show how 'the wrong / erroneous thinking is
removed / replaced / annulled by the right understanding:

अपवादो नाम — यत्र कस्मिंश्चिद्वस्तुनि पूर्वनिविष्टायां मिथ्याबुद्धौ
निश्चितायाम्, पश्चादुपजायमाना यथार्था बुद्धिः पूर्वनिविष्टाया मिथ्याबुद्धेः
निवर्तिका भवति — यथा देहेन्द्रियसङ्घाते आत्मबुद्धिः, आत्मन्येव आत्मबुद्ध्या
पश्चाद्भाविन्या ‘तत्त्वमसि’ (छा. उ. ६-८-७)

इत्यनया
यथार्थबुद्ध्या निवर्त्यते — यथा वा दिग्भ्रान्तिबुद्धिः
दिग्याथात्म्यबुद्ध्या निवर्त्यते —

Here is it aikya sāmānādhikaraṇam or bādhāyām? The above clears this
doubt.  Shankara has given the example of shukti rajata in the BGB 4.24
 that the jnani will see 'everything', which includes his own body-mind, to
be Brahman just as it is expressed in a corrected erroneous perception:
what was wrongly seen as silver is verily the shell. This is a case of
bādhāyām sāmānadhikaranyam. But, strictly, I think that aikyam can be said
only in such cases as 'एकत्वं तु अक्षरोद्गीथशब्दयोरनतिरिक्तार्थवृत्तित्वम्
— यथा द्विजोत्तमो ब्राह्मणो भूमिदेव इति ।' (in the same BSB cited above)
[Ekatvam is the persistence of the non-distinct perception with regard to
several words 'dvijottama', brāhmaṇa, bhūmideva - all mean the 'same'
thing: a brāhmaṇa.  This is an example of aikya sāmānādhikaraṇyam. Here
there is no bādhā involved; no erroneous knowledge is there which requires
a correct knowledge to annul it.
