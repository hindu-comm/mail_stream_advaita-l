Dear Shri Bhaskar,

>Drum-beat of vedAnta in prakaraNa grantha says world is unreal whereas
>bhAshyakAra in sUtra bhAshya says vedAnta maryAda is accepting that from
the >parabrahman prANa etc. jagat would emerge :-) strange are the ways of
Acharya >teaching !! :-)

As far as I know, the vedAnta DiNDimA is attributed to NrisimhAshrama. In
fact, there is a publication by Holenarsipur Adhyatma Prakasha Karyalaya on
the same, dated 1936.

There seems to be a lot of confusion about jagatkAraNa, which is easily
resolved if we recognize that there are two kAraNas - vivartakAraNa and
pariNAmikAraNa. Brahman is the vivartakAraNa of the world while mAyA is the
pariNAmikAraNa. This I have explained before:

When jagat is said to be mithyA, it means the mAyA aspect of jagat is
mithyA, since mAyA itself is mithyA. However, the Brahman aspect of jagat
is satya. In the statement, "brahma satyaM jaganmithyA", what is being said
is basically "brahma satyaM mAyA mithyA", as the world has mAyA as its
material cause.

Anand
