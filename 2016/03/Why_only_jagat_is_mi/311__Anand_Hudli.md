The very basic tenets of advaita are nicely captured in this verse
from the VedAnta-DiNDima:

  brahma satyaM jaganmithyA jIvo brahmaiva nAparaH |
  jIvanmuktastu tadvidvAn.h iti vedAnta-DiNDimaH   ||

Brahman is real, the world is unreal, and the jIva is Brahman alone,
not anything else. And one who knows this is a jIvanmukta (liberated
while living).
**This is the proclamation (literally drum-beat) of VedAnta.**

Another version I have heard is the following:

shlokArdhena pravakShyAmi yaduktaM granthakoTibhiH|
brahma satyaM jaganmithyA jIvo brahmaiva nAparaH ||
Whatever is explained by crores of texts is summarized by a half-verse.
Brahman is real, the world is unreal, and the jIva is Brahman alone,
not anything else.

Anand
