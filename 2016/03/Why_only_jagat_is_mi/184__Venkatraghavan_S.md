Namaste all,

Another thing that struck me as I was contemplating Sri Bhaskarji's
question on ब्रह्म सत्यं जगन्मिथ्या जीवो ब्रह्मैव नापरः ardha sloka, is
that Brahman's kAraNatvam of the jagat is also just an adhyAropa, it is not
true paramArthata: .

Brahman's asamsargatvam / asangatvam - whether through a kAraNa kArya
sambandha (Brahma kAraNam, jagat kAryam), or AdhAra Adheya sambandha
(Brahman AdhAram, jagat Adheyam), or antaryAmi relationship (Brahman as the
antaryAmi for every object in jagat)  - all flow from jagat's mithyAtvam.

AchArya's bhAshyam for the famous मत्स्थानि सर्व भूतानि and न च मत्स्थानि
भूतानि pair of adhyAropa-apavAda slokas in the Gita (BG 9.03 and 9.04) is
very helpful in reflecting on some of these aspects.

Therefore, jagat mithyAtvam is very much a fundamental (and valuable)
component of  advaita siddhAnta.

Regards,
Venkatraghavan
