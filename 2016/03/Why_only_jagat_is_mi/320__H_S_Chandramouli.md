Sri Anand Ji,



Reg  << In the statement, "brahma satyaM jaganmithyA", what is being said
is basically "brahma satyaM mAyA mithyA", as the world has mAyA as its
material cause.>>



Most often it is not recognized that in the statement  “mAyA as its
material cause “, mAyA is the unmanifest (अव्यक्त avyakta) form of the
material cause while jagat is the manifest (व्यक्त vyakta) effect (कार्य
kArya). Since we are used to relating anything unknown to the known
(manifest), perhaps "brahma satyaM jaganmithyA" is more meaningful than
"brahma satyaM mAyA mithyA".



However it is very useful in understanding the applicability of the
wellknown Chandogya statement concerning the pot-clay relationship <<
वाचारम्भणं विकारो नामधेयं मृत्तिकेत्येव सत्यम् >> (vAcArambhaNaM vikAro
nAmadheyaM mRttiketyeva satyam ). This is an illustration for
pariNAmikAraNa. Here मृत्तिक (mRttika) refers to the unmanifest clay in the
pot-clay example. This statement can be extended upto << वाचारम्भणं विकारो
नामधेयं मायैव सत्यम् >> (vAcArambhaNaM vikAro nAmadheyaM mAyaiva satyam)
 to explain the pariNAmikAraNa  mAyA-jagat relationship. mAyA is the
ultimate pariNAmikAraNa for the jagat and is unmanifest while jagat is
manifest. This is the limit to which the Upanishadic statement quoted can
be stretched .



However it is very often stretched further and misunderstood to be
applicable to the Brahman-jagat relationship also by concluding  <<
वाचारम्भणं विकारो नामधेयं ब्रह्मैव सत्यम् >> (vAcArambhaNaM vikAro
nAmadheyaM brahmaiva satyam). This stretching is not permissible since mAyA
and Brahman relate to two different levels of Reality and mAyA is vivarta
in Brahman and not a pariNAma of Brahman. In fact I believe this is one of
the basic misconception regarding the Chandogya statement quoted above that
is responsible for the wrong notion about the relationship between Brahman
and jagat as far as Reality is concerned and is also quoted in support of
such wrong notion.



My 2-cents view.



Regards
