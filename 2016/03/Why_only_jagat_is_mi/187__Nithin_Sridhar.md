Sharing my old blog post on Brahma Satyam Jagat Mithyam-
https://nithinsridhar.wordpress.com/2015/06/30/random-musings-part-37-brahmo-satyam-jagat-mithyam/

I have tried to explain the half of the half verse in a very simple way.
Learned members are requested to point out if there are any mistakes in the
blog.

Nithin
