In my limited understanding, jagat is said to be mithya not because of
above analysis you have quoted. But, the argument goes like this in a
nutshell ;

1. This jagat and the samsAra it causes to us is filled with quite dhukha.

2. In order to get out of this dhukha (however it may be apparent or real
it may) we need a means. Shastra is this means.

3. Shastra-s say this dhukha praihAra is possible only by jnAna.

4. If this jagat is causing dhukha and if jnAna is said to be destroy this
dhukha, then the cause of dhukha this jagat cannot be destroyed if it is
real. Hence jagat is said to be mithya.

This is how mithyattvam of jagat is derived from anumAna only. Shruti has
not employed here to drive this point.

This is the gist when  Shankara says while starting the commentary on
vaitathya prakaraNa says that this prakaraNa is meant to prove the falsity
of world using anumAna: tatra upapattyA.api dvaitasya vaitathyaM
