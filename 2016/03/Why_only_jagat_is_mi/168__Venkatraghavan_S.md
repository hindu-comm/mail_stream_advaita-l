Namaste Sri Bhaskar ji,

I agree on both counts - but if you accept both the propositions made by
AchArya, what is the question?

I believe brahma satyam, jaganmithyA, jIvo brahmaiva nApara: is a complete
teaching within itself. So let us consider only those 3 statements for the
purpose of this discussion.

That Brahman is satyam is established, by the first statement in the triad.

Now coming to the second, jagat is nAma rUpa with Brahman as its vivarta
upAdAna kAraNam. By saying jaganmithyA, the intention is to convey that
nAma rUpa is mithyA.

This leads to the third statement, where the sublation of nAma rUpa by
jnAna, to reveal oneself as the jagat kAraNam Brahman, is being enjoined by
AchArya.

In the second statement, by only saying jagat is Brahman (without saying
the nAma rUpa component of jagat is mithyA) how is the sublation of mithyA
nAma rUpa by jnAnam possible? How are we conveying the idea that Brahman is
the vivarta upAdAnam, not pariNAma?

So without jaganmithyA, we are left with aham brahmaasmi upAsana, not aham
brahmaasmi jnAnam.

Thanks,
Venkatraghavan
