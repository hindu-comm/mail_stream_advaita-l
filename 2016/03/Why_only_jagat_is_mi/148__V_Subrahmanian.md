In the āgama prakaraṇa (first chapter) itself the dvaita mithyātva has been
established by āgama pramāṇa.  The 7th mantra is the pramāṇa which shows
the shāntam shivam advaitam Chaturtham, Atmā, vijneyaḥ as
prapanchopashamam. What has been done there with āgama pramana is now
further strengthened for mananam in the vaitathya prakaranam by using
yukti.
