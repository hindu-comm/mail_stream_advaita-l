Brahman is real, the world is unreal, and the jIva is Brahman alone, not anything else. And one who knows this is a jIvanmukta (liberated while living).
**This is the proclamation (literally drum-beat) of VedAnta.**

praNAms Sri Anand Hudli prabhuji
Hare Krishna

Drum-beat of vedAnta in prakaraNa grantha says world is unreal whereas bhAshyakAra in sUtra bhAshya says vedAnta maryAda is accepting that from the parabrahman prANa etc. jagat would emerge :-) strange are the ways of Acharya teaching !! :-) 

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
