 To me, religion is confining oneself to a form,
 applicable to groups of people.. 

 Spirituality is a way of living and hence encompasses every
 sphere of our life.. Applicable to anyone and everyone,
 irrespective of gender and religion..
 One can be religious and not be spiritual.. 

 When one is spiritual, one is religious also..

 What is the difference between Religion vs Spirituality? Are
 the complimentary or sometime contradictory. Should one has
 to be Religious (whatever that means?) to be spiritual and
 for one to follow spirituality should one has to be
 religious. 



 The question is raised since I see in some posts in facebook
 that Religion is a problem or is causing lot of problem in
 the very practice and can even be obstruction for
 spirituality. I have also seen many who spend lot of time in
 daily religions practices and not interested in Vedantic
 study. 



 Hari Om!
