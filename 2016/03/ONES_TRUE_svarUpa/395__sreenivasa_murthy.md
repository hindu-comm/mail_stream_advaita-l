Dear friends,
 " The Awarenessthat you are searching for is, and always has been, shining in you as the'ORDINARY EVERYDAY AWARENESS'. It is what is cognising all your thoughts andexperiences. It is shining in you RIGHT NOW." This is what mantra 2-4 of Kena Upanishad and 
 mantras 2-1-3 and 2-1-4 of Kathopanishad is teaching. In a nutshell this is Atmajnana or Brahmajnana. There is no teaching beyond this to know one's SELF.With sAShTAMganamaskaras,Sreenivasa Murthy
