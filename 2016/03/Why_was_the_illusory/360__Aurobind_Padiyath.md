Your statement
"It (darkness) can be experienced hence it is sat and at the same time
these particular experiences can be nullified (in the presence of light),
therefore, it is asat.

Brahman is cit (consciousness) Maya is Avidya or (Avastu).
Object(appearance) is very different from the subject but there is no
object without the subject (This assumption is wrong as in a mirage). But
where did this object (the water in a mirage or darkness in the absence of
light) came from? "
