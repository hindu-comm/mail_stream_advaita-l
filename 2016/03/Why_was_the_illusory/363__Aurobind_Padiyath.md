Is it not happening every day? Even without effort? You don't have to dwell
on the subject. It's a natural process called swabhava.
This world as it is perceived now will vanish but there will be and there
is only That by whatever terms you describe from this state. Can beauty of
a rainbow explained to the blind becomes his knowledge? Only when he gains
vision he will know about the rainbow, even how he himself looks and how
the world appears. No word nor his mind can reach that knowledge before
that vision.
Ignorance is said to be beginning-less, but can be ended up on knowing.
Same way once known it can never be unknown. Since time itself is a product
of this ignorance, it's not possible to explain or give a reason for the
cause of it. It will be trying to climb your own shoulders. That's why the
answer to your question of getting caught up in its own ignorance cannot be
explained or understood.
For a moment go into deep sleep where time is absent. Do you have any issue
of ignorance? But you as the pure existence knowledge and bliss was only
there merged into its totality of One Being. When you establish firmly you
are That even in all the three states where in one you dream and the other
you experience this world and goes back to that One Being, you are the the
One and Only One. Does the ocean undergo any change from it's wateryness
when it changes to waves, bubble, cloud, iceberg, rain, pond, lake, Brook,
stream, river and back into ocean?
That Being, in essence which is everything, is also is like that.
Words cannot take you there as it's beyond. The whole of ShAstras and Guru
can only point us to That. The journey has to be ours.
HariOm!
