Your own ignorance about your true nature is what makes your feel limited.
Similar to dream where you feel you as various entities inside your dream,
all your own creation, but identifies with the dreamer, similarly in waking
state. You are neither.
Only when you are given the knowledge of your real nature, these
misunderstanding will get eradicated and once you gain that then you won't
feel miserable. Just as you are no more worried about your dreams. But you
continue to see it. Same way knowing the real swaroopa of you will remove
your identification with the concept of the individual self. But this world
will not vanish, only it will be seen in the new light of knowledge. Seeing
the water of mirage will entice you only till the truth is unknown.
 This is the Moksha what Advaita guarantee.
(I'm purposely not using jargon as I find many get stuck up on them and
miss the purports of the teachings)
