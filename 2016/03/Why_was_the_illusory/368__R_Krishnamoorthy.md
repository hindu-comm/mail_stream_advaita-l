Dear
Maya is just avidhya which veils the true understanding of the Jagath.That
is Jagath is perceived by Jiva's senses.Jiva is Brahman only.Why this
Brahman which is Jiva itself should have this false understanding of the
Jagath?There is no Jagath as such.This illusion is because of avidhya or
maya.Why Maya should make Jiva think or perceive theJagath?This question is
answered as follows.Brahman is the only sath or Truth.Jagath is illusory or
Mithya.There is nothing like Maya.It is the term used to denote the
unexplainable factor which causes this false understanding.May be due to
the defective faculties which are endowed with the Jiva.We can not find out
why so?It is not going to serve any purpose as solving an equation.
Jiva=Brahman +Avidhya[Maya] Jagath is not a creation by Brahman.It is just
an illusion or Mithya.If the Jiva understands this it is liberation.It is
not ever bounded but thinks as bounded.
Hope this gives some clarity.And this is my understanding.I may be wrong
also.Lastly Advaita is treating the whole manifestation of the world
universe ,living beings and inert matters etc as just Mithya only.
