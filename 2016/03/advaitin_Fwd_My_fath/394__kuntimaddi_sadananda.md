PraNAms

Prof.VK has been one the moderators of this advaitin group. He has also given several talk series that are being presented in yu-tube by Advaita Academy. One can go to Advaita Academy and ask for Prof. VK. 

Here in this note, Prof. vk has given the glimpse of his father's works, as posted by Shree Subbuji. Prof. VK has written commentaries on some of his father's works and they are available in the adviatin archives. After getting acquainted via adivatin list, I met prof. VK for the first time in Chennai in 1999 when I was doing sabbatical at IIT Madras for an year. He organized my talk on 'Logic of Spirituality' at the Kuppuswami Institute at that time.

When Arjuna asked a question- what happens to the seeker when he leaves this body just before complete realization-. Krishna provides a very fitting answer, reassuring all of us - in this Adhyaatmic Study, nothing gets wasted. It is a evolution not revolution. He will be born in the next life in an environment conducive for rapid growth. Thus with Kamala maami oneside and logic of math on the other side, Prof VK's continuous contribution to Vedanta is a testimonial proof for Shree Krishna's statement in Geeta. I have met both Prof.VK and Kamala maami in States and in India. Both came once to my talk at Durga Temple - organized by Shree V. Ramachandran which was followed by scrumptious Lunch by Shanti (smt. Ramchandran). 

With PraNAms to the divine VK couple. 

Hari Om!
Sada

 http://lifeflashesvk.blogspot.in/This contains an
 account of my father’s last moments. See Flashes of My
 Life – 7.And here is a small
 account of his profile:Shri R. Visvanatha Sastri
 (1882–1956), worked in the judicial department of South
 Arcot District in the erstwhile Madras Province of British
 India and retired as Sub-Court Sheristadar in 1939. Even
 when he was in his twenties he had been, during
 summer vacations, studying under the feet of Shri Shri
 Vasudeva Brahmendra of Ganapati Agraharam, Tanjore District.
 He had his training in the Bhashyas of Adi Sankaracharya in
 the conventional manner of Guru-kula-vAsam under the
 lotus feet of that Guru of his. He had also been sitting as
 a public witness-listener to the Bhashya teachings given to
 Shri Chandrasekharendra Saraswati (now called Kanchi Maha
 Swamigal, then the new and young head of the Mutt) in the
 early decades of the 20th century at the Kanchi
 mutt, Kumbakonam. By age 32 or so he had already started his
 own Vedantic expositions. During his lifetime he gave
 numerous lectures and expositions of the scriptures
 including several SaptAhas (seven-day expositions) of
 the Shrimad BhagavataM and navAhas (nine-day
 expositions) of the Valmiki Ramayana at various places in
 the present Tamilnadu and Kerala and also in some north
 Indian locations. One such event is recalled by him with
 pride in his autobiographical notes. In the early thirties
 (October 1934) he gave a fifteen-day exposition of the
 Bhagavatam at the Mani-karnika ghat in Varanasi in
 the beatific presence of the Kanchi Maha Swamigal who was
 then on his first all-India tour. Shri Visvanatha Sastri has left
 27 original manuscripts in Sanskrit expounding the
 advaita school of thinking and its symbiosis with
 Bhakti. The longest of them all is
 Gita-amrita-mahodadhi. It is a marathon treatise on
 advaita through the medium of the Gita and the
 Upanishads. It consists of 2400 Anushtup slokas
 divided into five chapters. He wrote the whole manuscript as
 was his custom always, in the Grantha script of the Sanskrit
 language. The resulting manuscript (running up to 879 pages
 of notebook size writing) now contains both the original
 shlokas of the author and his own Sanskrit commentary
 (vyakhyana) in prose. The copy of the original
 manuscript of 2400 slokas alone is with the Kanchi Mutt
 Library. In order that the work may have a wider reading,
 the whole work has now been manually transcribed into
 Devanagari script by the son. A copy of this has been
 deposited (Nov.1998) with the Kuppusami Sastri Research
 Institute, Tiru Vi Ka Salai, Mylapore, Chennai, 600004,
 India, so that posterity may not miss it. A scanned copy as
 written originally in Grantha script is available in the
 files section of the advaitin yahoo-group.
