This appears to have gone to Sri Praveen Ji only. Hence I am forwarding it
to the Forum. Regret the oversight.

Namaste Sri Praveen Ji,



Reg your observation  << However, that is the fact when Bhagavatpada says,
जीवो ब्रह्मैव नापरः. To put it in other words, it is what is called as
ऐक्यसामानाधिकरण्यम्, which means that individual is really non-different
from brahman, while जगत् and ब्रह्म are in बाधसामानाधिकरण्यम्, which means
that world is really not there, only Brahman is there.>>, ,



 जीवो ब्रह्मैव नापरः( jIvo brahmaiva nAparaH)  is also explained in terms
of बाधसामानाधिकरण्यम् ( bAdhasAmAnAdhikaraNyam). In the school of thought
which includes कूटस्थ (kUTastha),   चिदाभास (chidAbhAsa) and mind as
components of जीव (jIva), and considers चिदाभास (chidAbhAsa) as the
understanding of जीव prior to ज्ञानम् (j~nAnam), बाध (negation)  of the
understanding that चिदाभास is different from Brahman leads to the
understanding  जीवो ब्रह्मैव नापरः.



In that school of thought which considers कूटस्थ (kUTastha) as जीव, ज्ञानम्
refers to cognition ( or recognition ) of कूटस्थ as nondifferent from
Brahman,  which is ऐक्यसामानाधिकरण्यम् (aikyasAmAnAdhikaraNyam) or
मुख्यसामानाधिकरण्यम् (mukhyasAmAnAdhikaraNyam.).



(As far as possible I have also given the English transliteration for the
Sanskrit words as in one of the posts a member had specifically requested
for such rendering for the benefit of members not familiar with Sanskrit
notations).



Regards
