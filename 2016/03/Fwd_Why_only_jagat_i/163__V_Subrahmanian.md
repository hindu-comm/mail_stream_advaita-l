Everybody, all schools, admit the 'body is the self' as an adhyasa. Without
that adhyāsa, even Ishvara will not create a new body for a jiva to
experience karma and to produce new karma. So, one cannot say 'there is
already a body and one gets the idea of self in it'. Now, for dvaitins, the
adhyasta vastu is atyanta asat, like hare's horn. in the case of the
rope-snake, one can say that there is a real snake and one sees its
semblance in the rope. But in the 'primary' body-adhyāsa, how does it work?
If the rope-snake analogy is to be applied,in this case too, for the
body-is-the-self adhyāsa to happen, the 'body'  must be known before. Where
was that body? Are there two bodies, one that is real and another that is
asat?

Samsāra, including the adhyāsa, is admitted to be anādi. In advaita, it is
held that the pūrva-adhyāsa is responsible for the uttara adhyāsa. No one
can say from when, how, anyone got the 'first' body-adhyāsa.
