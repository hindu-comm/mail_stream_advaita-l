By oversight the post has been sent earlier to Sri Bhaskar Ji only. Regret
the error.

Sri Bhaskar Ji,



 Reg  << Under these circumstances I don’t call your two levels of reality
is erroneous but out of context considering that fact that brahman is
abhinna nimittOpadAna kAraNa for this vyavahArAspada jagat. >>.



A very surprising observation. It is the only contextually correct
statement.  “fact that brahman is abhinna nimittOpadAna kAraNa for this
vyavahArAspada jagat.” should be understood in accordance with and
consistent with the two levels of Reality.



Anyway that is my understanding and I wish you well in pursuing a different
line of reasoning.



 Regards
