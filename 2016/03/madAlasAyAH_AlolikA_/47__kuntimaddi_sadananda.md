 Sada
 ji,

 The episode that you
 have in mind is perhaps of the 'Chūḍālā -
 Śikhidvaja
 royal couple'. Here, first
 the queen becomes enlightened and later the
 husband, thinking that leaving the palace, etc.
 will help him, renounces.
 In the forest, he
 strives hard, but does not succeed. Later, Chudala, in
 the guise of a brahmacharin, instructs him and
 now he becomes a jnani.

 regards
 subbu
