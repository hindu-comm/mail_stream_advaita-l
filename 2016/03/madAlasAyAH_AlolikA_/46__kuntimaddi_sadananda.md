 Thank you Sada-ji. With
 pleasure you can put on FB. No copyrights :)).

 This is from Dattatreya Mahatmyam of Brahmanda Purana.
 Amazing to see that such
 brahmavAdinis once walked on our
 land.Queen Madalasa taught Vedanta to her
 4 children
 in the form of "Lullaby" and all 4 became Jivanmuktas !

 Infact, this episode should be circulated widely on
 "Mother's Day" and my intention is to
 see that this reaches far & wide to every mother across
 the world.

 regs,
 sriram
