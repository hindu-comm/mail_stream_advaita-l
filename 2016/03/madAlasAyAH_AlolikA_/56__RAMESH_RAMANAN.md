Pranams to all members,
My sincere thanks to all those who posted (Sriramji this beautiful lullaby of Queen Madalasa, raised the doubt (Bhaskarji) and clarified it (Sri Subrahmanianji). I think this same Queen Madalasa also appears as the wife of King Shikidwaja in Yoga Vasishita. Ramesh Ramanan.

I am reminded of a verse that is popular with Advaitin. It would be
interesting to note a verse from the mahopanishat 4.54 / Laghu Yoga
vAsiShTha utpatti prakaraNam 1.12:

ऋतमात्मा परं ब्रह्म सत्यमित्यादिका बुधैः ।
कल्पिता व्यवहारार्थं यस्य संज्ञा महात्मनः ॥4.54॥

[In order to facilitate parlance, the wise employ words such as Rtam, AtmA,
Param, Brahma, Satyam, etc., to designate that Supreme Self.]

Even the word 'Advaitam' is not the absolute name. Words are used only as
long as the Truth is not recognized by the aspirant, just to help one turn
his attention to it. Once he is able to identify it as his very Self words
would have served their utility. He no longer needs words to 'get there'
for he is already That.

So, the Upanishad itself teaches that the names for That Advaitic Truth are
mere temporary facilities, to facilitate the aspirant to come out of
avidyā. That is the reason the Upanishad itself says: yato vācho
nivartante....Any name/word is inevitably, inextricably, tied to
relativity. To transcend relativity is the aim of the Upanishads. Hence
alone it says: prapanchopashamam, shāntam...again words!! Inevitable.
Shankara cites a vedic passage in the BSB 3.2.17:

बाष्कलिना च बाध्वः पृष्टः सन् अवचनेनैव ब्रह्म प्रोवाचेति श्रूयते — ‘स
होवाचाधीहि भो इति स तूष्णीं बभूव तं ह द्वितीये तृतीये वा वचन उवाच ब्रूमः
खलु त्वं तु न विजानासि । उपशान्तोऽयमात्मा’ इति । तथा स्मृतिष्वपि
परप्रतिषेधेनैवोपदिश्यते — ‘ज्ञेयं यत्तत्प्रवक्ष्यामि यज्ज्ञात्वामृतमश्नुते
। अनादिमत्परं ब्रह्म न सत्तन्नासदुच्यते’ (भ. गी. १३-१२)

इत्येवमाद्यासु
।

It is in the bhāṣya for the above cited BG verse that Shankara gives the
long explanation as to why, how, Brahman is beyond the ken of words: As per
the Vyakarana Shastra, words can be used only in that instance where
action, attribute, species (and sambandha) are involved. Brahman is free
from all these and hence alone no word can directly be used to denote
'Brahman' (which is also a word!!).
