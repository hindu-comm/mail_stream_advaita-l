Sada ji,

The episode that you have in mind is perhaps of the 'Chūḍālā - Śikhidvaja
royal couple'.  Here, first the queen becomes enlightened and later the
husband, thinking that leaving the palace, etc. will help him, renounces.
In the forest, he strives hard, but does not succeed. Later, Chudala, in
the guise of a brahmacharin, instructs him and now he becomes a jnani.
