Pranams Shri Aravinda Rao-ji,

Thank you for the recommendation on the CDs.  

Yes, self study is futile without guidance.  And incidentally your lectures on BG and Kathopanishad have been very helpful in understanding Shankar Bhasya which you are following and explaining word for word - thank you very much for that.

But there are many others available and it is the balance between learning grammar vs listening to pravachans.  30 minutes per day for 120 days seems doable but am sure will have to memorize quite a bit of rules.

Sincerely,
Sanju
