Thank you for the advice.  I continue to learn Sanskrit, no fear, but was looking for learned members advice on the balance between pursuing self knowledge and the hours spent on grammar.  In my 30s, no doubt but I'm in my 50s, hence doubt arose.

Now I'm clear.  Better to redefine the useless hours / activities in other pursuits, than to make it an (artificial) question of Sanskrit or Vedanta.

I liked the quote on stuti versus critiquing the alternative.

धन्यवाद,
Sanju
