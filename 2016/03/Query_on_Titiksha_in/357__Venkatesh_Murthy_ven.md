I also think this is the correct answer. Because I heard Hariharapura
Swamiji saying on Sankara TV the pollution will make Yoga practice
useless. Yoga practice is only good if there is no pollution. If there
is heavy pollution in the air and water how can we do breathing
exercises like Pranayama and benefit? We will be breathing pollution
and giving out pollution only. In big cities they are teaching Yoga
classes inhaling vehicle smoke and pollution. What is the use?
