 Namaste

In Sadhana Catushtaya they say Titiksha is bearing heat and cold. But
in modern day the bad effect of pollution is there. In India you can
see Pollution Index Real Time map

Question: Is Titiksha also means tolerating pollution? Because in
olden days there was no pollution like today. Why should we tolerate
pollution?
