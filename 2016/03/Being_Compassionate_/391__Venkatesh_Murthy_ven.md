Short answer is read Gita with Sankara Bhashya. Same questions Arjuna
also asked and he got answers. Don't think Gita was only for him. It
is for all of us. We have to make attempt to get answers. There can be
no spoon feeding. Guru also only points the way. But discovering
answer must be own effort.

They will slowly go as one constantly remembers of one's true nature based on the understanding gained by vedanta sharavana and manana. It is  a life-long process - but as one abides, the FIR, the frequency of perturbation, the intensity of perturbation and the recovery time from perturbation - slowly reduces It is not a discrete event but analog one.
