KameswaraRao - PraNAms

You are asking the whole of Advaita Vedanta. As you mentioned about tureeyam - which is described as Mantra 7 of Mandukya - understanding of the is Advaita in spite of any apparent dvaita.

There is exhaustive presentation in the Viveka chudamani of these. Those who are really interested can listen to the talks on Advanced Vedanta on yu-tube

<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwRNbT_-h5A&list=PLWjpkY4mU2RAlFcTU_5G2a1trhbcZUedZ>

The talk series follow closely the Vivekachudamani text presented based on my understanding.

There are also talks on Yogavaashishta - the essence of Advaita vedanta was presented.

 Pranamam Sadanand
 Ji,

 "Scriptures say that fear comes from
 the second.There is no fear in deep-sleep state as there is
 no subject-object duality". 

 Yes sir, it is agreed there is no fear in
 "Turiya" or when the breath is in sushumana but
 once we are off from the sleep again the story repeats, the
 same physical body, same thoughts, same people, how to over
 come them, then what are the methods to overcome that,
 what scriptures advise in this case?

 "Fear goes away, therefore, if and only if
 one sees oneness that pervades all the apparent
 duality"
 My question to you is that how
 vedanta address the oneness which removes the duality. How
 to over come raga, dweshs, aham, mama ?or AVIDYA
 Please explain in the interest of several
 readers who are in need of this.
 Dhanyawad
 with regards
 Kameswara Rao

 Scriptures say that
 fear comes from the second.There is no fear in deep-sleep
 state as there is no subject-object duality. 

 Fear goes away, therefore, if
 and only if one sees oneness that pervades all the apparent
 duality. 

 Understanding
 this truth is one aspect and abidance in that understanding
 is the next. The problem for the later is due to remnant
 raaga dwesahs with aham and mama - dushta chatushatam. They
 will slowly go as one constantly remembers of one's true
 nature based on the understanding gained by vedanta
 sharavana and manana. It is a life-long process - but as
 one abides, the FIR, the frequency of perturbation, the
 intensity of perturbation and the recovery time from
 perturbation - slowly reduces It is not a discrete event but
 analog one. 

 There are no
 short cuts here. 

 Hari
 Om!
 Sadananda

 TIMES,
  Author: Sh.Sudhamahi Ragunathan
  Dear Friends,          
  To be
  compassionate or to forgive some
 body's mistakes is not an
  easy task, In
 order to this one should be free from fear
  and able to give all the materialistic things
 without
  expecting anything in return, this
 can only be done by a
  'Veera' only.
 Then Question comes is how can we remove our
  fear, some times it comes to us as act of
 compassion. What
  causes Fear? It can be
 described as a feeling of not being
  good
 enough and a feeling of insecurity. It also comes from
  the ignorance of the rules that are in operate
 in the world
  and possibility of loosing
 material wealth and
  relationships.Fear can
 be born from the wrong revengeful
  enemy ,
 lust, target less ness and felling of not able to
  fulfil the committed tasks.    
 Jainism believes
  removal of all fearful
 activities describes as abhayadanam
  is the
 highest quality charity, best action and supreme
  manifestation of compassion.    
  Compassion
  can also be termed in
 sometimes as daya, vatsalya, karuna,

 anukampa, karunya, dana, maitri in different sinario's
 with
  some commonalities. Compassion form
 the foundation for
  FAITH. As the divine
 energy present in all human beings is
  same
 as ESWARA is same in all & All souls are same
  leading to one final destination. Causing harm
 to one soul
  is nothing but causing harm to
 one self which disrespects
  the
 universality of the soul as it can be insect or a
  plant.     Even the mosquito /
 cockroach that
  you spray against its biting
 has a desire to live and
  striving for its
 existence as you & I do with the same

 effort. All are part of Food cycle only. Jains tell us
 a
  true fact that being compassionate is
 more than ahimsa. It
  is understanding some
 one's feeling, appreciation of some

 one's mind, giving them an unique opportunity to live
 their
  own path by serving the master.
  Here is one examples of one of the 24
 dattatreya's guru's is

 'Courtsean".
  Some time back, it
 was happened that a monk was doing
  peace
 in a dancing lady's (Vesaya/kalavti/ not prostitute)
  house. In reality the monk was really testing
 his will
  power, chitta & steadyness.
 but the kala's arose from
  the lady
 i.e charms made him forget his targets. Lust was
  overtaking his spiritual thoughts and
 inclination. The
  lady rebuked him in a such
 manner that he became conscious
  of his own
 foolish acts and back to the path of renunciation
  with his guru's soul.The so called lady
 i.e courtesan being
  compassionate to the
 monk for several years. The monk is
  none
 other than the person who sold is ferari or beloved
  BMW.
  So a person who is on
 the path of renunciation will get
  automatic
 support from the nature, mother goddess, guru,
  through all the people whom you meet in the
 travel path, it
  is certain, only thing one
 should keep is that Divine
  vision,
 acceptance to open critics, finally being

 "COMPASSIONATE HRIDAYA".
  If some
 one having compassionate hridaya then , liberation
  from this cycle is certain as thesriguru
 opens thedoor
  to unite in hisatma, will
 happen.Atma vidya/ srividya
  will take the
 road to join the ananta jyothi of the

 paramatma/ parabrahama swarupa
  with
 regards
  Kameswara Rao
