Namaste Shashwata Shastri
The Paramaatman cannot be described in words.
He is beyond space and time.
If I recall correctly, the "size of the thumb" describes the space within the heart wherein the Supreme resides.
Scriptures provide explanations to point the mind in a certain direction, but the ultimately the mind needs to come to stillness in order for Consciousness to manifest fully.
Like a map shows one where the best roads are, scriptures guide us to the Eternal.
But the map cannot take the journey - and the destination is not in the map.

If you are looking for the Brahman in creation, you will not find it!
And yet all of creation is a form of that same Brahman.
Mind / Senses cannot perceive the Brahman since that Brahman is the very source of the looking / thinking.
Greater than the greatest, smaller than the smallest - yet eternally unmanifest.
