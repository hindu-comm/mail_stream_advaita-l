Namaste Bhaskar ji,
Can you please confirm that your argument boils down to this:

Jagat is mithyA nAma rUpa with Brahman as adhishthAnam. As nAma rUpa is
mithyA, it is bAdhita by shruti pramANa. Therefore, by bAdha
sAmAnidhikaraNyam, jagat is Brahman.

If this is your argument, I don't think anyone will argue.

However, if you are saying that nAma rUpa is Brahman's kArya and in every
kArya the kAraNa exists, and therefore nAma rUpa is verily Brahman,  that
is where the difference arises.

In the bhAshya for the BrahmArpaNam sloka (BG 4.24), Bhagavatpada says:

ये तु अर्पणादिषु प्रतिमायां विष्णुदृष्टिवत् ब्रह्मदृष्टिः क्षिप्यते
"नामादिष्विव चेति ब्रुवते न तेषां ब्रह्मविद्या उक्ता इह विवक्षिता स्यात्",
अर्पणादिविषयत्वात् ज्ञानस्य । न च *दृष्टिसम्पादनज्ञानेन मोक्षफलं प्राप्यते*
।

(Note: arpaNAdishu brahma drishTi: kshipyate nAmadishu iva cha iti chet)

Here Acharya is refuting the opponent's claim that Brahma arpaNam should be
understood as upAsanAbhyAm sAmAnidhikaraNyam. He says that no Brahman
drishTi in nAma rUpa (or attributing Brahman where nAma rUpa is) will give
moksha. What is needed is a complete bAdha of nAma rUpa.

Please see his bhAshyam of the first two words of the sloka:

ब्रह्म अर्पणं येन करणेन ब्रह्मवित् हविः अग्नौ अर्पयति तत् ब्रह्मैव इति
पश्यति, *तस्य आत्मव्यतिरेकेण अभावं पश्यति, यथा शुक्तिकायां रजताभावं
पश्यति*; तदुच्यते ब्रह्मैव अर्पणमिति, यथा यद्रजतं तत् शुक्तिकैवेति ।

Regards,
Venkatraghavan
