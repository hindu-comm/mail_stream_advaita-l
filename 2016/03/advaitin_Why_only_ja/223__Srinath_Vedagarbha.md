By concluding so, the author of above assertion is already under the spell
of mAya, for he is seeing "difference" and posting real distinction between
'laukikAs' and not so laukikAs. This difference is not possible unless
oneself is laukika himself.

To come out of this problem, I guess, one need not make such distinction;
or make the distinction but not hold difference is undesirable.
