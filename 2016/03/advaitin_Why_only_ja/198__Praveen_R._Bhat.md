Namaste Bhaskarji and others,

I'm sorry, but the entire mixup seems to be very nicely built over loose
usage of adhiShThAna and svarUpa as can be seen below...

Once again, nAmarUpa *having* brahman as its adhiShThAna or kAraNa and
nAmarUpa *being* brahman are two different things. You seem to treat them
as same! The former applies to jagat and the latter to jIva. Using both
interchangeably makes everything pAramArthika, there is no need for a
technical vyAvArika perspective at all. The thinking then is, anyway,
everything is brahman. :)

Kind rgds,
