Hari Om,
Pranams

what exactly is the jagat svarUpa
>> sat / chit

how it is avidyAkalpita
>>  seeing it as nama rupa  (having satyatva buddi in nama rupa),  but not
as sat /chit.

what exactly does it mean brahman is both nimitta and upAdAna kAraNa when
jagat is just like adhyArOpita 'sarpa' on the rope
>> please look it from dristi-shrusti vada, because rajju-sarpa (or sapna)
is dristi- shrusti only.

regards
