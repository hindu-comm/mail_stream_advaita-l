Namaste Sri Bhaskar ji,

<< jagat and its satyatvaM are the subject matter of pratyaksha pramANa>>

Let us keep this to only pAramArtha drishTi. 3 reasons why this statement
is inapplicable in pAramArtha:

1) shAstram tu antyam pramANam says AchArya. He says that no pramANa,
pramEya, pramAtr bhedA is possible in Brahman. jnAni loses his pramANA
status, perception loses its pramANA status and jagat loses its pramEya
status after the onset of jnAna. That is how brahmaivedam amrutam purastAt,
should be understood.

2) Even in vyavahAra, the adhishThAna of nAma rUpa can never be available
for perception, by your own logic. How is the anadhigatatvam of shruti
preserved if perception reveals Brahman as adhishThAnam? If it did, one
doesn't need shruti at all. So one has to conclude that what is available
for perception is only the mithyA component of jagat, never it's
adhishThAna.

3) Which brings me to the 3rd point. Considering  perception of nAma rUpa
as *perception* is valid only in vyavahAra - ie so long as they are not
understood as mithyA.  Once nAma rUpa is understood as mithyA, no pramA can
be generated for a mithyA vastu. The very definition of pramA is
abAdhitArtha vastu vishayaka jnAnam pramA. So if nAma rUpa is sublated, you
cannot call it's jnAnam pramA, and you cannot call the means of generating
that jnAnam pramANA.

So by 2 (anadhigatatvam), adhishThAna cannot be perceived, and by 3, nAma
rUpa perception is not perception at all.

By 1, AchArya himself relegates all pramANA prameya pramAtr vyavahAra only
until the generation of brahma jnAnam.

With this I am going to stop and let you consider whatever you have read -
over 100 emails have been exchanged on the subject. If after reading all of
them you still feel your position is justified, I'm not sure there is much
further to say. All the best.

Regards,
Venkatraghavan
