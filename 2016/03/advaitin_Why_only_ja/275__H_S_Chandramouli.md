Pranams to all.



I just recap my last post for the sake of completeness.

 Pranams.



You observe



<< When it was said in shAstra that brahman is the both upAdAna and nimitta
kAraNa it is not like milk has become curd nor it is like father has become
father to his somany sons >>.



 The examples cited essentially pertain to pariNama upAdAna kAraNa. Since
you are negating it the only other upAdAna kAraNa left is vivarta upAdAna
kAraNa. Then why shy away from saying so ??

Since he has nothing further to say on the issue here I would like to
complete what I have to say on the issue.





It is not a question of nomenclature or labelling. It is Sidhanta.
According to Advaita Sishanta


<< Brahman is abhinna nimitta ( vivarta)  upadAna kAraNa for kArya jagat>>.


Since jagat is vivarta in Brahman, it is mithya, by definition.
