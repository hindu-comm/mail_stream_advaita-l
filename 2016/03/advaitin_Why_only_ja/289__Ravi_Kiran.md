One is at paramArtha and other is vyavahArika ? why compare them ?

Yes..Hence,  Sruti advocates neti neti teaching, to de-invest the reality
given to jagat (diversity, bhedham) and realize the one-ness of brahman

*should not go against* - Why you are enforcing such conditions ? Why there
is a need as such? what we are trying to prove by bringing different
pramANas in the discussion?

Because Sruti says so ..

*vAchArambanam* vikAram nAmadeyam, mrtikka eva satyam

IN another thread, you mentioned:

aloof from its adhishtAnaM anrutameva.  Thinking that jagat is

there exists nothing apart from That.

If that is your viewpoint, it is fine ... That
*Ekam evadvitiyam vastu, you prefer to name it is as Jagat instead of the
more popular Brahman, it is fine, that is your choice, as there cannot be 2
realities - Brahman and Jagat , both having satyatvam in advaita..*
