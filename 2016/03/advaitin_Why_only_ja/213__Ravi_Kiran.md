paramArtha jnAnam and jnAni's vyavahAra are not the same and has to be seen
as such..

Sri Shankara in sUtra bhAshya says ..

पश्वादिभिश्चाविशेषात्। यथा हि पश्वादयः शब्दादिभिः श्रोत्रादीनां संबन्धे सति

शब्दादिविज्ञाने प्रतिकूले जाते ततो निवर्तन्ते अनुकूले च प्रवर्तन्ते
यथा दण्डोद्यतकरं

पुरुषमभिमुखमुपलभ्य मां हन्तुमयमिच्छति इति पलायितुमारभन्ते
हरिततृणपूर्णपाणिमुपलभ्य

तं प्रति अभिमुखीभवन्ति एवं पुरुषा अपि व्युत्पन्नचित्ताः क्रूरदृष्टीनाक्रोशतः

खड्गोद्यतकरान्बलवत उपलभ्य ततो निवर्तन्ते तद्विपरीतान्प्रति अभिमुखीभवन्ति।

अतः समानः पश्वादिभिः पुरुषाणां प्रमाणप्रमेयव्यवहारः।

jnAni’s vyavaHara involving pramAna-pramEya, is said to be like
pashu's activity.

This is deterministic of jnAni, when it comes to *vyavaHara*.


Rest is left to one's discretion ..
