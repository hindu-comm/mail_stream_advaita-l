To differentiate between the adhiSTAna (of jagat) and svarUpa (of jIva), I am attempting two analogies as follows. 
Request the learned members to comment.

1. Brahman being the adhiSTAna of jagat can be explained by the mirage in the desert, wherein the mirage has nAma-rUpa but ultimately it is bhrama (illusion) with the hot sand being only the adhiSTAna, but not its svarUpa.

2. The svarUpa of jIva being Brahman can be explained using the gold-ornaments example, wherein when you remove the nAma-rUpa of the ornaments, only the gold (svarUpa) remains.

Warm Regards
Venkateswaran N E
