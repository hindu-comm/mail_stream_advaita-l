Namaste Sadaji, Bhaskarji,

Apologies for responding out of turn in a communication between Sadaji and
Bhaskarji, but I see a discrepancy in that the statement is grossly
misinterpreted.

How does "in fact, it (seeing the world) makes it mithyA only" *logically*
mean "brahman becomes unreal as it cannot be seen"?! IMO, there is no
logical connection at all between the two statements. The fact is what is
seen is mithyA; what is not seen is what cannot be objectified since it is
the subject oneself and then understood as the very vastu, brahman.

Kind rgds,
