Namaste

There is Adhikari Bheda here also. For Ajnani the world is not Mithya.
It is Satya only. He must say Jagat Satyam only not otherwise. For a
seeker world is Mithya. It is not Sat, not Asat, not both Sat and
Asat. For a Jnani the world is not there at all. It is Asat like a
Man's horns.

Therefore when someone is asking 'how can you say World is Mithya?' we
have to ask 'Who are you?' Are you Ajnani, Seeker or Jnani. The answer
will be depending on who is asking. If Ajnani is asking we have to
agree and say 'No no, world is not Mithya but Satya only. Be happy'.
If Seeker is asking we can show him how world is Mithya. If Jnani is
asking... he will never ask at all. He knows the answer.

Otherwise there will be endless unnecessary debate for many many
centuries like with the Dvaitis.
