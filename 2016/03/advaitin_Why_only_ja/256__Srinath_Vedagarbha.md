I have a question here ---

 "not considered as untrue" means considered as true?

If so, how does one suppose to understand truthness of a pramANa when such
pramANa itself is operating "as long as" one does not correctly understand
aikya? Since truthness of pramANa is nested with in outer untruthness of
vyvahAra, it is equivalent to saying pramANa-s are not true after all?
