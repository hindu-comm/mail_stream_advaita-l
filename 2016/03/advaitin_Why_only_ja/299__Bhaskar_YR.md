When you negate, superimposed thing goes wholly

praNAms
Hare Krishna

I was / am talking about bedha buddhi nivrutti and not bhedAkAra (sic.) nivrutti. After realization jnAni’s jnana would reveal him the fact that that which has been (earlier prior to jnana) cognized by him as asarvaM due to avidyA, is sarvaM only and kArya in its kAraNa svarUpa satya only not mithya.  Infact, shankara clarifies that there is no mithyA as such when you realize that brahman itself is presented as object of word and thought such as ‘This’ (jagat).  The jagat will not disappear in thin air but the jagat svarUpa has been realized in its entireity.  Hence as per my understanding a ‘thing’ will not go anywhere, but the ‘thing’ has been realized in its svarUpa. adhyArOpita misconception will go wholly.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!

I don't know what those examples will prove which were put by Venkateswaran.
I just like to say that : there are two types of adhyAsa :
1. svarUpAdhyAsa
2. saMsargAdhyAsa

jagadadhyAsa is first and jIvatvAdhyAsa is second.
When you negate, superimposed thing goes wholly. In second case, only attributes dissolve.

Ask bhagavatpAda, and he says : यन्मायावशवर्ति विश्वमखिलं ब्रह्मादिदेवासुरा, यत्सत्त्वादमृषैव भाति सकलं रज्जौ यथाहेर्भ्रमः
