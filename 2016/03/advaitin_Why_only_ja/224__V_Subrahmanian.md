Ranjit,

Actually, a blogger did make a similar comment/objection about Advaita
realization.

http://creative.sulekha.com/dvaita-vs-advaita-vadiraja-attacks-advaita_325380_blog

//(ii) If everything and everyone is actually Brahman(God), then why should

My reply to that, in that blogger's comments area, can also be seen just
above that.
