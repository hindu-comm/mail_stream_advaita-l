Negation of world already happened? When? It implies from your explanation
that such negation must have happened in vyavhAra before arriving into
pAramArtha. If that is the case, you may have to violate Shankara in many
places.

"sarva-vyavahArANAmEva prAk brahmatma-avijnyAnAt satyatva upapattEhe
svapna-vyavahArasya prAk prabOdhat" - Sri Shankara BSB (II.1.14)
(Before coming by realization it is but proper to regard all our worldly
activities as real, as our activities in dream seem real to us till we wake
up )

prAk prabOdhAt samsAritvabhigamaha (Before the dawn of realization we have
to concede the reality of samsAra )

na cha dvaitasya anritatva-buddhihi prathamamEva kasyachit syAt |
(Nobody thinks from the very outset that duality is false )

prAk brahmAtmatvadarshanAt vishayAdi-prapanchO vyavasthitaroopO bhavati |
(Prior to the realization of the identity of Atman with Brahman, the world
of
senses and other things have their definite form.)

dEhAtma-pratyayO yadvat pramANatvEna kalpitaha loukikam tadvadEvEdam
pramANam tvAtma nischayAt |
As long as the idea of the Self is identified with the body consciousness so
long i.e, till the realization of the true nature of Atman, the world
perception, the reality of the world is also equally valid.

So, the negation must be from pAramArtha only.

This is not correct. You will not be in the state of very realization (that
"this is rope and not snake" kind) in the first place unless you negate the
perceived "snake" as false. This fact of negation itself is true at the
end. If you say this negation did not happen in the first place then the
perceived "snake" remains snake itself and never ever get corrected. In
other words, perceived "snake" remains abhAdita and hence you may have to
call it real!

The very reason you characterized "snake" appearance as mithya is because
you reasoned it on the ground that if it is real it should not be sublated
(along with other half  part if it is asat it should not be perceived). The
very fact that you can sublate such mithya vastu, now denying the negation
itself is a vyabhichAra at best.
