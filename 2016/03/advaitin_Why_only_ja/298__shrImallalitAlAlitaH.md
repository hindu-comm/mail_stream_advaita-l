​Don't worry.
I was not being critical.
I just found that only examples are not enough, so I tried to put them as
famous definitions.
Those terms are self explanatory.

svarUpAdhyAsa is where the dharmI is superimposed, as in rajjusarpa. There
is no snake nearby, but it appears. In that case, an imaginary snake is
produced by avidyA.
saMsargAdhyAsa is where the dharmI or dharma(thing or quality being
superimposed) is existent and present nearby and appears as something or
quality of something else, as in superimposition of redness in crystral.
Both crystal and red color have vyAvahArika-sattA and are adjacent to each
other. So, there is no need to accept that red color was produced by
avidyA. In that case, only relation of red color (with crystal) is
generated by avidyA.

Similarly, jagadadhyAsa is svarUpAdhyAsa; while chaitanya is not
superimposed in case of jIvtvAdhyAsa.
