Namaste Bhaskar ji,

When you asked the initial question "why is jagat mithya", we mistakenly
assumed you and us had the same definition of mithyA. However that doesn't
seem to be true, because you go on to say:

<<In this way, the AdhAra for both vyAvahArika and prAtibhAsika satyam-s is
nothing but that parabrahman only hence it is called prAtibhAsika and
vyAvahArika satya not mithyA.>>

Can you please succinctly define what you mean by mithyA, so that we can
revisit your question if need be?

To us, whatever is not paramArtha satyam and paramArtha asat (alIka/tuccha)
is mithyA. So we call vyAvahArika satya and prAtibhAsika satya as mithyA.
You may ask: but doesn't vyAvahArika and prAtibhAsika satya have Brahman as
AdhAra, or otherwise how would they appear to exist?

We say: Yes they do. But the AdhAra as a separate entity is not included
within our definition of mithyA - if it was, then that AdhAra - as sat, and
nothing else - is a paramArtha satya, and hence not included within what we
call mithyA (see the definition above, whatever is not paramArtha satyam...)

If you understand our position, that is sufficient for me - it's OK even if
we are in disagreement.

Where people will have a problem is when you claim Shankara is also taking
your position. The issue with that stand is that you would have to ignore
MandUkya BhAshya + prakaraNa granthAs attributed to Shankara.

Regards,
Venkatraghavan
