My question is primarily based on Acharya's reply to pUrvapaxin as stated
by you in your earlier reply.

It appears that there is tempral aspect to pramANyatvam of any pramANa-s in
a way that "as long as" one is in vyavahAra, pramAna-s are not untrue
(meaning true).

I agree with your latest reply it seems you are saying pramaNA-s doesn't
need the support of any other pramANA to establish its pramANatvam. But, it
is clear from your response what happens to pramANatvam when one consider
the fact that all pramANa-s are true "as long as" one is under vyavahAra,
which by definition a avidyAtmaka avastha. Hence my question about truth
nested under untruth avstha.
