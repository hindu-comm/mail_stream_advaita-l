I find the  gold-ornaments example is analogy of the Brahman being the
adhiSTAna of jagat..  though the ornaments ( jagat) is experienced, it is
not paramArthikam, while Brahman alone is ...

While, the mirage in the desert or rajju-sarpa example, analogous to the
svarUpa of jIva being Brahman - like the non-existent water or the
no-existent sarpa, jIva is non-existent at all times ( jagrat, svapna or
sushupti)
