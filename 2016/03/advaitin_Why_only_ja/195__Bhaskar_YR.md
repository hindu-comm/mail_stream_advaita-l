I find the  gold-ornaments example is analogy of the Brahman being the adhiSTAna of jagat..  though the ornaments ( jagat) is experienced, it is not paramArthikam, while Brahman alone is ...

I agree.  But point here is can there any existence be attributed to ornaments without the presence of gold in it??  When you know the true svarUpa of gold, the socalled nAma rUpa is nothing but gold only i.e. satyameva.  Shankara talks about 'bheda buddhi nivrutti' NOT bhedAkAra nivrutti.  Hence it has been clarified that the 'jagat' will not be vanquished by attaining the brahmavidyA.  But the assumptions (like it is asarvaM, paricchinnaM, independent from its svarUpa etc.)  about jagat conceived by the one who endowed with avidyA are gone!!??  For that matter brahma vidyA svarUpa jnana does not create anything new nor destroy a thing in front.  It (jnana) can reveal the 'truth' behind jagat which is nothing but brahman.

PS :  Kindly pardon me prabhuji-s for continuing this thread from my side.  Since I am the originator of 'doubt' on jagan mithyatvaM, I have to clarify certain points from my view point.
