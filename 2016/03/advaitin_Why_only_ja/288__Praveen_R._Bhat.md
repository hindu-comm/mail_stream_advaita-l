This is exactly what I have been saying in almost all my mails to
Bhaskarji, as to it being the very definition of mithyA!

In my first response to him, I said that I do not disagree with him, as
that is what will go well with ajAta vAda. However, nor do I agree with the
words in which he asserts that jagat is satya. That agreement and
disagreement at the same time is also sort-of mithyA! :) He is holding onto
the adhiShThAna being brahman that no one disagrees with, and asking: how
can jagat be mithyA then? With that question, there is nothing left to
negate, including the body-mind -sense complex which is part of jagat, and
the entire neti neti prakriyA is thrown out, like baby with the bath water.

Kind rgds,
