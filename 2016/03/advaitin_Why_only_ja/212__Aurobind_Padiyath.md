If we see the pot independent of mud, which is not possible and in reality
is name and form of the mudpot, then it has to be defined as MithyA. As
there will have to be the pot existence without mud. So the name and form
called pot of which the base is mud all put together is Sat not MithyA. You
cannot bring water etc with a MithyA pot. Like the snake case. That's why
we are able to carry on Vyavahara even after knowing that the pot is made
of mud.
Same way for the Jnani, the jagat is nothing but Brahman but the
vyavaharika Jagat is also of the same Brahman. If one sees a jagat (names
and forms) without knowledge and existence of those names and forms (I
don't know how it will be possible),then that jagat is mithya.
Yetra na anypascati = sarvam Brahma,
Yetra anypascati = how can this happen when one Knows the above? As there
is nothing in reality Anya.
