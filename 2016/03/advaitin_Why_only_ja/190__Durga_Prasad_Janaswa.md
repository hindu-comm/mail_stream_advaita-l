Hari Om,

Pranams,

I have few doubts. Appreciate if they can be clarified:

1
"chaitanyam in it's jIvatva-state can't be identified with brahman."
i. Can we say
chaitanyam in it's jIvatva-state is vachArthA,   sudha brahman is
lakSharthA?


2.  "vivarttopAdAna can't be identified with kArya"
How can one be termed as upadana without knowing that there is a kArya?

3
"If you want to add brahman to nAma and rUpa, then it must be added as
adhiShThAna; not as a svarUpa(part) of jagat.
While in the case of jIva, brahman(chaitanya) is part of svarUpa too."

i. here are we saying
chaitanya is part of svarUpa and adhiShThAna is not.

ii. In other words are we saying, there can be adhiShThAna (sat) without
chaitanya?
chaitanya without adhiShThAna (sat)?


Thanks and regards
