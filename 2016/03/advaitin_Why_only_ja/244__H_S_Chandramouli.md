Sri Venkateswaran Ji and Sri Ravi Kiran Ji,

>  << To differentiate between the adhiSTAna (of jagat) and svarUpa (of

> Request the learned members to comment.

> 1. Brahman being the adhiSTAna of jagat can be explained by the mirage in
> the desert, wherein the mirage has nAma-rUpa but ultimately it is bhrama
> (illusion) with the hot sand being only the adhiSTAna, but not its svarUpa.
>
> 2. The svarUpa of jIva being Brahman can be explained using the
> gold-ornaments example, wherein when you remove the nAma-rUpa of the
> ornaments, only the gold (svarUpa) remains.>>,

> Brahman was एकमेबाद्वितीयम् (ekamebAdvitIyam) in the beginning. This

> bhUtas refer to Gold and the gross Creation refer to Ornaments.  It should
> be noted that both this and the gold ornament illustration involves  विकार

> But the Shruti declares Brahman as निर्विकार(nirvikAra) (not subject to
