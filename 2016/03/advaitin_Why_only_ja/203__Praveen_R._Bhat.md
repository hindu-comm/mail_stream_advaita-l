You are right, but again mixing up from the pAramArthika angle. Nobody here
is talking about the vastu/ brahman, are we? We are all talking of what is
seen in vyAvahAra as jagat. That is not talking of brahman. "jIva is
brahman in svarUpa, while jagat has adhiShThAna of brahman" is being read
by you as both are invariable denoting brahman! Who denied that for you to
make that statement is really not clear. What that statement means and as I
said on more occasions than one that "the status of jIva, meaning that
which is svarUpatA brahman, is not comparable to status of jagat, that
which has adhiShThAna as brahma". Why? Because the former is nothing but
satyavastu brahman, while the latter is mithyA, nAmarUpAtmaka. What is
accepted is jIva = brahman. The truth of both being brahman is not being
denied. What is denied is jagat = brahman, because jagat = nAmarUpa and
nAmarUpa is not = brahman, but nAmarUpa = mithyA.

All your follow on argument is with the assumption that we are denying
adhiShThAna = svarUpa = brahman. That is not the argument at all as
explained above.

Please compare your statements:
1) "Nobody saying nAma & rUpa is one with gold"
2) "nAma rUpa of ghata is mrittike only"

... are they really not contradictory?! Your "saying same thing in a
different way" logic seems to be that:
a) ghaTa is mRttikA eva
b) and ghaTa is nothing but nAmarUpa
c) so nAmarUpa = mRttikA.

IMO, point c is incorrect. The conclusion drawn in the traditional teaching
is that nAmarUpa is mithyA, ghATatvam is mithyA, ghaTa is really not there,
mRttikA eva satyam. So nAmarUpa of ghaTa is not mRttikA.

For a simple logical statement such as "one thing that has a substratum is
different from another thing that is in its inherent nature the as that
substratum", you expect a bhAShya statement! Where is your bhAShya base to
show otherwise? All your statements show that the substratum of one thing
is the same as substratum of another which is its inherent nature. That
solves a problem that neither you nor anyone replying to you has, since no
one disagrees on it.

do you disagree that this is said at all?! Anyway, here's a quotation:
Bhashyakara says under Katha mantra 1.3.13  यच्छेद्वाङ्मनसी... so:
एवं पुरुषे आत्मनि सर्वं प्रविलाप्य ***नामरूपकर्मत्रयं
यन्मिथ्याज्ञानविजृम्भितं* क्रियाकारकफललक्षणं स्वात्मयाथात्म्यज्ञानेन
मरीच्युदकरज्जुसर्पगगनमलानीव मरीचिरज्जुगगनस्वरूपदर्शनेनैव स्वस्थः प्रशान्तः
कृतकृत्यो भवति

Please note the words. nAmarUpakarmatrayaM is mithyAj~nAnavijRmbhitaM,
there is pravilApana needed to be done in one's own self which is brahman,
the svarUpa, which is adhiShThAna. There would be no pravilApana needed if
the nAmarUpakarmatraya was svarUpataH brahma.

Here's one directly from the Upanishad: Mundaka 3.2.8 says यथा नद्यः
स्यन्दमानाः समुद्रेऽस्तं गच्छन्ति नामरूपे विहाय ।  तथा
विद्वान्नामरूपाद्विमुक्तः परात्परं पुरुषमुपैति दिव्यम् ॥ nAmarUpe vihAya
and nAmarUpAt vimuktaH both tell that nAmarUpa are mithyA. Bhashyakara says
under Mundaka 2.2.12 that nAmarUpa avabhAsamAnam, meaning that there is an
appearance and that appearance is mithyA.

which proves that nAmarUpa is mithyA, it doesn't prove that nAmarUpa is
satyam!

which also proves that nAmarUpa of ghaTa is mithyA.

Thanks for quoting on my behalf too, what do you understand by svataH tu
anRtam eva? That is exactly what mithyA means. sarvaM nAmarUpAdi svataH
anRtam = mithyA eva.

Yes, I mean to say that the jagat is nAmarUpa and nAmarUpa is not svarUpa,
it is mithyA. It has adhiShThAna of satyabrahma but nAmarUpa is not
svarUpataH brahma, while jIva is svarUpataH brahma.

Ditto.
