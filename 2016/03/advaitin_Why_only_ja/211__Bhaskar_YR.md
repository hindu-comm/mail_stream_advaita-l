For a jnAni, when Brahman is satya always (jnAna nishTa), is there a further need to mention jagat satya along with Brahma satya ?
By stating so, does it further qualify or enhances it, by any means?

Ø   For that matter for the ajnAni also jagat is satya only and from this satyatva buddhi in jagat he does the vyavahAra thinking that this jagat is his bhOga bhUmi and he is bhOktru, this jagat is karma bhUmi thinking that he is kartru / karmi etc.  So for his jagat is an independent satya and he is an individual enjoyer / sufferer etc.  Whereas from the pAramArthika drushti of the jnAni, this jagat is not an independent reality and jnAni is not an independent enjoyer etc.  Because in him there is no jnAtru, jnana, jneya triputi vyavahAra.  He sees Atman and only Atman in sarva vikAra, for him jagat is not MITHYA it is satya in its kAraNa svarUpa.  From this sarvAtma bhAva, whatever he does is satyameva.  sadAtmanA satyatvAbhyupagamAt…sarvavyavahArANAM sarvavikArANAM cha satyatvaM.clarifies shankara in sUtra bhAshya.  He is not declaring here jagat is mithyA and his vyavahAra with this jagat is mithyA, it is satyameva from the highest point of view that is brahmaikatva drushti.
Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
