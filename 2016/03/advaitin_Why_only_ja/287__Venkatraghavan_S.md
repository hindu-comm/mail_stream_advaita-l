Yes. Sri Bhaskar's contention is that jagat is Brahman. I see three ways
for that to hold good:

1) There is no difference between jagat and Brahman. If there is no
difference then jagat is simply nAma rUpa, which is mithyA. This ends up
proving the opposite of Bhaskarji's contention.

2) There is a difference between kArya jagat and kAraNa Brahman. If there
is a difference then how is jagat Brahman? Further, if there is a real
difference, and we somehow say that jagat is Brahman, this implies svagata
bheda in Brahman. This option is not possible as that is shruti viruddha
(neha nAnAsti kinchana) and yukti viruddha (we start off saying jagat is
Brahman and end up proving jagat isn't Brahman).

3) There is a difference in vyavahAra but no difference in paramArtha
between jagat and Brahman. Put like this, the difference between Brahman
and jagat itself is sadasat vilakshaNam. So the next question is, is that
difference mithyA or satyam? To answer that question we have to go through
the same 3 options, and if we reject the first 2 of the options for the
same reasons as above, we have to posit a second difference that is sadasat
vilakshaNa too, and so on so forth, leading to infinite regress. So the
more we try to define jagat, the more it eludes description, leaving us to
conclude that all we can say about jagat is that it is mithyA and leave it
at that.

Not sure if all that makes sense, but that's my understanding of the topic.

Venkatraghavan
