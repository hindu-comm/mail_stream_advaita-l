Namaste Bhaskarji,

I received two mails from you today via the list but both seem to be
replies only to to my old reply. I've already replied to that yesterday! I
think you haven't replied to my latest mail (where I said you are treating
all types of samAnAdhikaraNyam as same) but older one. Pls recheck.
