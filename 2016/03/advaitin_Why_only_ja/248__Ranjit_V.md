Hello sir

Even this is my understanding. Clay-pot, gold-ornament is analogy given for cause-effect relation. Since the effect is non different from the cause, the effect should be discarded as they are not permanent. Here the nondual cause is ever permanent and never the effect. Further the cause is nondual but the effects are many. This is the analogy.

First of all, mRdghaTa is not for adhyAsa, it is for kArya-kAraNAbheda.
See the prakaraNa of chhAndogya.
rajju-sarpa is not for niravayavatva. It's for saying that every thing
apart from brahman is superimposed. See brahmsUtrAdyAdhikaraNam.
