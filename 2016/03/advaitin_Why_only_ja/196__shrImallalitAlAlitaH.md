​No.

​True svarUpa of Gold? Really?
Do you want to say 'of ornament'?
​

​Really.
I've not seen such  an expression from any serious student.
Are you really studying vedAnta for a few years?

Who in this world says that nAma-rUpa (of ornament)​

​is one with gold?

Really, so satchidAnandenra jI support this view? At least have a look at
his works. He puts things very clearly.
As you are making proclamations, there is no need to put proof for
supporting my views too. So, I proclaim that if bhedAkAra doesn't dissolve
by GYAna, then it must be real and it makes advaita impossible.
I don't think you care about advaita-system.

​Sure! That's why you need to read first adhikaraNam of brahmasUtra, if you
could get the correct meaning without superimposing your pet theories on
them.

​Enough. I can't bear any more.
I've other works to do. Most important of them is to learn new shAstra-s.
I'll suggest all to learn to learn, if they are serious.
Future posts will be neglected.
