Sorry to interject here, but a small question..

Given that in siddAntha time itself is said to be mithya/anirvAchaniya, and
since this world will last long atleast as long as the time itself, how can
we say this jagat is not sat based on trikaala abhaaditam criteria?

Are we saying here there is outer time scale at pAramArtha level against
which this  trikaala abhaaditam criteria is evaluated?
