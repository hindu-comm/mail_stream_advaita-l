Namaste,

You let the cat out of the bag by saying "Probably our understanding of the whole phenomena is deficient and our reasoning faculty is not measuring enough to unravel what is Brahman."  That is because we are trying to do the impossible, i.e., to have a continuity between the Vyavaharika Satya and the Paramarthika Satya. Both are Satyas but in different dimensions.  The Vyavaharika Satya disappears at the very moment of true realization of the Paramarthika Satya. Until we become able to curb / destroy our desires and develop the Vairagya, all our knowledge of Advaita is mere academic exercise. The knowledge of Advaita is useful to begin with, but it become effective and produce result when we develop the Vairagya. At that stage we essentially become the Sanyashi, not necessarily by our attire, but by our attitude. The Vyavaharika Satya vanishes for the realized, but not for the world.. The Sun and Moon will shine for the others but the realized will become one with the Sun and the Moon and everything. 

My 2 cents

Regards,
Sunil K. Bhattacharjya

 Dears
 In
 the Mandukyopanishad while dealing with the rope snake
 analogy to explain the world as an illusion only,it is said
 that a substratum is necessary to create even an illusion.So
 the rope is necessary to create an illusion of a snake.If
 there is no rope there can not be an illusion of a snake.So
 Brahman is the substratum on which Jiva sees the world which
 is an illusion or simply mithya.It follows that there should
 be similarity between Brahman and the world.Probably with
 this in view other schools of thought like Saivism,Sankhyam
 etc were derived or propagated.Gaudapada Kariga can be taken
 as a reference.

 Further the
 Upanishad says that the substratum or Brahman is not the
 cause of the world .Though Jivas mistake the universe as
 projected by Brahman,Brahman has no role in it is the firm
 contention of the vedantins.
 So it is not
 correct to say there was creation as Brahman desired like
 that etc are not compatible with the attributes of
 Brahman.Brahman is poornam.He has no desire to fulfil and
 He does not require to play to get Himself engaged in
 creation to satisfy Him.
 This is very
 difficult to grasp .We are not able to get rid of our
 amazement on seeing the world outside with Sun Moon and
 other celestial objects following a pattern in clockwise
 precision.Plants,animals moving around with their assigned
 roles.We in our little thinking capacity come to a
 conclusion that there should be a single command which makes
 all these things happen.
 Taithriya Upanishad
 speaks of -for out of fear of Brahman the fire fires ,the
 Sun shines etc-.
 Therefore it is difficult
 to reconcile an action less Brahman.If the entire thing is
 an illusion does it mean all human beings are seeing the
 same illusion?
 Probably our understanding of
 the whole phenomena is deficient and our reasoning faculty
 is not measuring enough to unravel what is Brahman.
