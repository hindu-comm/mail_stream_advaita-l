Isn't is saying "you know what, there never was a snake at all" is same as
negation? It seems you are holding negation process which happens during
realization in vyavahAra is different from denying snake/world from
pAramArtha point of view. But it is not correct, we do not have two
negations.

Same here, if you know something does not exist, don't you use negation
sentence when somebody ask you for teaching aid?

The gist is: To say that 'by negating the world, the Advaitic Brahman is
known' is also a teaching aid; really speaking there is no world at all to
be negated. It is not that the world exists, which is negated. The world
does not exist at all in the first place for it to be negated.

Please note the denial of negation in the *first place* here. My reply
was based on this denial.
