praNAms Sri ChandramouLi prabhuji
Hare Krishna

<< When it was said in shAstra that brahman is the both upAdAna and nimitta kAraNa it is not like milk has become curd nor it is like father has become father to his somany sons >>.

 The examples cited essentially pertain to pariNama upAdAna kAraNa. Since you are negating it the only other upAdAna kAraNa left is vivarta upAdAna kAraNa. Then why shy away from saying so ??


Ø   If the labelling of it in a particular way is so important in the context of this discussion, so be it prabhuji as you wish ☺

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
