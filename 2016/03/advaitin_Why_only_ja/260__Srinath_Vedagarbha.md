We can definitely discuss in a different thread, but just a point in this
regard.

 This is acceptable only if said mithyAthvam is due any other reason other
than avidya (of a ajnAni). But you see in the siddhAnta it is said it is
indeed due to avidyA only. So, the question is still valid in terms of how
can the validity of pramANa be supported when itself is under the spell of
avidya. It is misleading to think they are different in terms of former
being epistemological truth while later being ontological mithyathvam.

Your real question should be different - do vedAs exist in pAramArtham?
