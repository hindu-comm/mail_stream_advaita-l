Thank you.. From the standpoint of paramArtha satyam, It alone is there and
It knows Itself by Itself (svayam prakAsa) ..

So, the significance is always to the paramArtha jnAna, which removes
(sublates) the anAdi avidya that was responsible for seeing nAma rUpa jagat
as satyam (real) by itself, independent of its adhiSTana Brahman.

when you say  - (though you are seeing the nAma rUpa) , it is ‘gold’ only -

Yes, when one is not introduced to 'gold', the above instruction holds
true.



Just because we are seeing nAma rUpa (ornaments / kArya) we cannot say

Ok, your discussion through out,  is from jnAni's viewpoint - Brahma satya
jagat satya ..?

For a jnAni, when Brahman is satya always (jnAna nishTa), is there a
further need to mention jagat satya along with Brahma satya ?

By stating so, does it further qualify or enhances it, by any means?
