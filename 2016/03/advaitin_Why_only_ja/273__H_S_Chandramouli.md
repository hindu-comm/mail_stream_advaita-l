Sri Bhaskar Ji



 Pranams.



You observe



<< When it was said in shAstra that brahman is the both upAdAna and nimitta
kAraNa it is not like milk has become curd nor it is like father has become
father to his somany sons >>.



 The examples cited essentially pertain to pariNama upAdAna kAraNa. Since
you are negating it the only other upAdAna kAraNa left is vivarta upAdAna
kAraNa. Then why shy away from saying so ??
