Yes, this is exactly what I understood also from all the posts from
Bhaskar-ji and commented so, in one of the earlier emails ..

If this Atmaikatva jnana (as he says) is extended further to a different
realm ( as in jnAni's vyavahAra he quotes - whatever he does is satyameva, his
vyavahAra with this jagat  is satyameva ), I see the dilution (avidya
kalpita) ...
