PraNAms to all.

What is the difference between Religion vs Spirituality? Are the complimentary or sometime contradictory. Should one has to be Religious (whatever that means?) to be spiritual and for one to follow spirituality should one has to be religious. 

The question is raised since I see in some posts in facebook that Religion is a problem or is causing lot of problem in the very practice and can even be obstruction for spirituality. I have also seen many who spend lot of time in daily religions practices and not interested in Vedantic study. 

Hari Om!
Sada
