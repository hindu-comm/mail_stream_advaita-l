Good article. It is also showing Paramartha and Vyavahara are already
there in Nature. It will silence the Critics of Vedanta saying
Vedantis have borrowed ideas from Buddhists. They cannnot understand
Sruti itself is giving Paramartha and Vyavahara instructions but put
full faith in Puranas and entertaining colourful stories.
