Listen Murkha. Yes even Drushti Bheda is Vyavahara and Mithya also. If
you want to see Bheda Rahita Avastha even a fool can understand that
there is no Bheda in Deep Sleep. Do you see Vishnu and Apsaras in Deep
Sleep?  Tell me. Do you see your foolish talking Mathas in Deep Sleep.
Nothing. No Bheda. Did you understand now? O God give these Dvaitis
some intelligence.
