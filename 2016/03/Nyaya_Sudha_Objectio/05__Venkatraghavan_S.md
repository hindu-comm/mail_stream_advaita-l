Sri Venkatesh,

Please let us try and be civil, even when we disagree. After all, let us
remember what AchArya said: त्वयि मयि चान्यत्रैको विष्णुः व्यर्थं कुप्यसि
मय्यसहिष्णु:

It does not behoove us, who are followers of advaita, to insult others -
there is no "other" for us. We find place for dvaita and vishishtAdvaita
within our system.

Everyone is passionate about and convinced about the rightness of their
belief system. Advaitins and dvaitins have been disagreeing for centuries,
it is presumptuous to think that any side will concede to the other now. It
is natural that one side's arguments will appear flippant to the other.

If I have offended you by this email, I apologise.

Regards,
Venkatraghavan
