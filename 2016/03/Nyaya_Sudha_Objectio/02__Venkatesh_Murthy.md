Again Dvaitis are showing dull mindedness here. Adhikari Bheda is also
from Vyavahara Drushti only. We are having this discussion in
Vyavahara only. Otherwise there is nothing to discuss. Think about it
till you understand. In Paramartha Drushti there is no Adhikari no
Adhikari Bheda no teaching no Bandha no Moksha. Think beyond
Vyavaharic Samsaara.
