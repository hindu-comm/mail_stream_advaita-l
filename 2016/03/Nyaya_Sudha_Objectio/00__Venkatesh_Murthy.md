Namaste

Thanks to all responding to answer the second objection about
Mithyatva of Bandha.

Dvaitis mistake is they are not recognizing the Adhikari Bheda of
people. There are three types. One is Adhama Adhikari. He is lowest
type. For him Bondage is real. He has to struggle with all
difficulties thrown in the ocean of Samsaara. He has to approach God
and pray for freedom from troubles. He is the dull minded Dvaiti
thinking he is different and God is different. But God will not give
him Mukti but make him born in next life with interest in Advaita.
Ishwara Anugradeva Advaita Vasana.

The next is Madhyama Adhikari. He is intelligent person knowing
Samsaara is temporary and all happiness and sorrow is also temporary.
He knows Bondage is temporary but he cannot be free from troubles. He
has Sadhana Catustaya and he has come to study Advaita. He is very
convinced Advaita is the only hope. For him approaching a worthy Guru
that Guru only will give Upanishad instruction to get Moksha here in
this life itself.

The next is the Uttama Adhikari. He is Jeevan Mukta himself. For him
Bandha is not there at all. It is Mithya. Even Sruti has nothing to
offer because he has become Brahman. Study of Prasthana Traya will not
give him any new benefit. But for helping others he will naturally
with compassion teach others. Because he has Prarabdha Karma a Lesha
Matra of Avidya will be there to continue his life.

The last is Uttamottama in Videha Mukti. For him Bandha, Samsaara and
Moksha was never there and never will be there. He is permanently
Brahman full of Sat, Cit and Ananda.
