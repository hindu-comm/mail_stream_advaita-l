Because of a dvaiti upholds bhEda he is called  "dull minded" and
adhmaAdhikAri, then by the same standard, what should a person be called
who also proposes the same bhEda in terms of adhikAra bhEda?

If bhEda is mithya (due to upAdhi-s), then this very framework based
adhikAra-bhEda be equally mithya and hence attAtvIka. The very conclusion
is its apavAda.
