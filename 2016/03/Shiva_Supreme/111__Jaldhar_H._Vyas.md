Speaking of Shri Jayanarayananji and Shivaratri, readers may be interested 
to know he has written an article with the above title.

We Smartas are comfortable with worshipping any of the Vedic devatas as 
Brahman.  For some it is Vishnu Bhagwan, some Shiva Bhagwan and some 
Bhagavati Ma.  Let it be so, according to the longings of the bhaktas own 
heart!  But there are some who would claim that the shastras proclaim only 
Vishnu Bhagawan as the supreme being.  This article demonstrates that it 
is not the case.
