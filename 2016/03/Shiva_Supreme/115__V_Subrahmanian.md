I have heard this stated by Sri Velukkudi Kannan Swami himself.  But no one
has thought about the following:

Rukmini, the Mahā pativratā, on the eve of her slated wedding (to
Shishupala), went to the temples of Shiva, Ambikkā (Parvati) and Ganesha
and worshiped them devoutly.  She observed the mouna vrata (even today many
non-Tamil brahmin weddings have this Gowri puja on the wedding day).  The
Srimad Bhagavatam gives a lot of details about how Rukmini prayed to Gouri,
Shiva, to grant her wishes.  Sri Viraraghavachariar, a Srivaishnava
commentator, has clearly said that Rukmini went to that temple complex and
worshiped those deities stated above.  He adds: Rukmini (verily Lakshmi)
had no real need to pray, etc. She did that only to be a role model to
others (यद्यदाचरति श्रेष्ठः....).  That means: Her intention is to teach
the people at large that going to Shiva temple worshiping and praying to
the Shiva parivāra is a commendable practice.

This episode of the Bhagavatam is to be contrasted with what Ramanuja
reportedly did.
