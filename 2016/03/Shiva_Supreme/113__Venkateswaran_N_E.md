Namaste.

Is there any specific reason why Vaishnavas are highly evangelical when compared to others like smArthAs etc ? Have their Acharyas mandated evangelical activities on their followers ?

I find they almost match the Abrahamic religions in their zeal and enthusiasm to evangelize Vaishnava supremacy.

Warm Regards
Venkateswaran N E
