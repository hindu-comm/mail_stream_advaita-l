Some very famous compositions of Muthuswamy Dikshitar are 'vātāpi gaṇapatim
bhaje', 'ranga pura vihāra' (on the Lord of Srirangam temple),
'Srivaralakshmi namastubhyam' in Sri rāga.  The devi navāvarṇa krtis are a
very rare composition with a deep mystical theme. There are the navagraha
kritis too.
