A very late thank you to Mr. Bhat 
and Mr. Sharma for pointing out 
the relevant sutras and explaining
them so clearly.

There is a वार्तिका under the previous sutra which says ऋवर्णाच् च इति वक्तव्यम्। That is, the नकार following a रेफ, ऋ or ॠ in the same पद is replaced by a णकार, even when intervened by any letter of the प्रत्याहार अट् (अ इ उ ऋ लृ ए ओ ऐ औ ह् य् व् र्), कवर्ग, पवर्ग, आङ् (a prefix) and नुम् (a grammatical आगम/ augment).

In the case of derivation of रामेण, at some point the derivation reaches रामेन where र् is followed by न् but intervened by आ, म् and ए। The 1st and last are part of प्रत्याहार अट् while the 2nd is a पवर्ग letter. So 8.4.2 applies making it रामेण। Same with रामाणाम्।
