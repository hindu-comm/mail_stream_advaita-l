Namaste,

Kanchi Paramacharya while expressing His respects to the great avadhuta of Arunachala Seshadri Swamigal,
also paid His respects to Bhagavan Ramana.  

Here is the e-book which is the biography of Sri.Seshadri Swamigal of Tiruvannamalai.  In the 5th page,
one can see the homage paid by Mahaswamigal to Bhagavan. The words are in Telugu.
