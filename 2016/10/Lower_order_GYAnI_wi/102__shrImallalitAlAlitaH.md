I just one more reading of all points, and the jIvanmuktivivekaH chapter
which I mentioned.
Then one more thing to add, any type of GYAnI, even that who appears
jIvanmukta, needs to continue practice because who knows when and how one
falls.
I request you to write the definition of jIvanmukta and videhamukta here,
then think about their fate according to my hints.
Then I'll reply.
I must say that you are very good at grasping hints, because things which
were barely indicated by me were written clearly by you.
I'll reply once you do as requested.
