Namaste Sri Raghav Ji.

I had also mentioned that there are  advaitins who do not subscribe to the
view expressed by Swami Vidyaranya in JMV  (as understood and expressed by

and complete if you could have added the following also.

.4. If indeed JMV mentions so, is it correct??

Thought I would bring it to your attention.

Regards
