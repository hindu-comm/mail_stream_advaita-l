praNAms Sri Subbu prabhuji

Thanks for the clarification.  I agree that yOga bhrashta would get the next janma in an environment which is conducive to continue his sAdhana.  But my question is more practical and simple.  i.e. which type of  thought an advaitin should learn to cultivate to have that thought forcefully at the time of his / her death.  Whether it is duality based ‘nArAyaNa’ thought or non-duality based ‘neti neti’ thought or as Sri Sada prabhuji explained a ‘bhakti mishrita’ jnana thought??

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!

How/what  does it matter what thoughts appear for an advaitin, who has realized one's nitya mukta svarUpa ?


Ø   I am not talking about the jnAni-s who have realized their svarUpa.  I am talking about the sAdhaka-s in Advaita mArga.  Whether they should entertain duality based thoughts or non-duality based thoughts at the time of death.

Bhaskar ji,

The 6th Chapter of the BG, yoga bhrashṭa case, is what is relevant here.  If the sādhaka is sincere in his vedānta sādhana, and he does not attain the end result of sadhana before death, he will, according to the Lord's assurance there, go to those worlds that are attained by people who have performed punya, meritorious actions such as ashvamedha. They will remain in those lokas enjoying the bhoga and thereafter return to this world and be born in pious rich families or in a family of Yogins and continue their sadhana, from where they left in their earlier life as human. In this life they will be pulled or driven by the force of that vedanta sadhana and will eventually reach the goal.

regards
subbu
