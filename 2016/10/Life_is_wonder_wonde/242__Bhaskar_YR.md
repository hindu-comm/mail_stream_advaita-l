How/what  does it matter what thoughts appear for an advaitin, who has realized one's nitya mukta svarUpa ?


Ø   I am not talking about the jnAni-s who have realized their svarUpa.  I am talking about the sAdhaka-s in Advaita mArga.  Whether they should entertain duality based thoughts or non-duality based thoughts at the time of death.
Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!

Let the mind sing its bhaja govindaM or Om Namah shivaya or aham brahmasmi ..it affects not one's Atmaikatva (sva)svarUpa..
