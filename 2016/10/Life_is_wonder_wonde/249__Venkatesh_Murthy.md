Namaste

I once asked my grandfather the same question. What should be thought
by pure Advaitis at Death? Bhaktas will think of the Lord and utter
mantras and so on. But Advaitis can be different. What should they do?

He said after knowing all this Maayaa you should enjoy Her activities
like you are enjoying a film on screen. You should not feel sad or
afraid at Death but enjoy that also as a part of the movie Mayaa is
showing you. If you try this approach looking at Life as a movie on
screen by Maayaa you will not feel sad any time. Life is a dream it is
a movie by greatest director Maayaa. Enjoy it. Don't be sad.

My grandfather did like he said. He was chatting with everyone and
enjoying the movie. Next minute he closed his eyes permanently.

As I said earlier, I have just taken your experience as benchmark to know what would be the ideal  mental status of the Advaita sAdhaka during the death time.  'bhakti mishrita jnana' drushti that you explained is really wonderful thought we should have.  After all , Advaita is not a dry philosophy it has a 'rasa', the nector we should taste through parabhakti.

Namo Naarayanaaya! came to my mind asmental chanting - not by effort but naturally, as I do that all the timewhenever I close my eyes, and do that also involuntarily as I see myself not asa devotee but as Advaitin only, since I see the presence of the Lord everywhereas the Self as that I am - For me chanting the name of the Lord first for themind helps to drift my mind from other names and forms,  as I shift mymind to the recognition of the Self and Iswara are undifferentiated due toAdvaita conviction.

When I open my eyes also Ikeep that vision of seeing first, the Lord in different forms - since every nameand form - is nothing but Him only based on the knowledge gained from thescriptures; and then see myself as everything. These two-stage mental steps arepart of my saadhana, which can be different for others - hence I do not discussthese also.

What I wanted to emphasize is only eventhough it started as saadhana, it became natural since that happens to me manytimes as meditate whenever I am alone. However the real surprise (thisanalysis is after the fact) is that even I was in a precarious state (as wastold by my wife) the name came to my mind spontaneously and mind recognition ofthe advaitic understanding by seeing the oneness that pervades everything. Ihave not even recognized that I was in precarious state at that time. I wasjust reveling in the beauty of the presence of the Lord or the self everywhere.

In spite of the fall, and in spite of the spatially in aprecarious position, I could but wonder the role of the Lord in putting me inthat position safely. - I could not but become a devotee with the Iswara asguiding principle - This is both vishistaadvaita and adviata too -  atBhati level they do not differ also.

I feel that I am blessed by the supreme intelligence fortaking care of me (Ok my body) so that it did not get hurt by my fall. My wifeheard big noise due to my fall for her to wake-up to run to the bathroom.  All I can say the constant practice of jnanaamwith Bhakti or devotion to  the lord forthe mind to hold on to.
