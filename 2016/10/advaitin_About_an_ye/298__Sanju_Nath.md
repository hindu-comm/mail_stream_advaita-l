> Just came to know that Pujya S.N. Sastriji has passed away. I first met him in Advaitin list and I paid visit to him few years ago since he lived in Chennai. He was in a way my mentor always making suggestions to my writings in Advaita and where my interpretation differs from the traditional approach. He was in a way guiding principle. Just 10 days ago he sent me a file translating part of Pancapaadika saying that he is unable to complete it. I will miss guidance. Sastri is well known as he translated Shree Narayaneeyam and was published by Chinmaya Mission. Here is small write up on him published in advaitin list. Hari Om!
