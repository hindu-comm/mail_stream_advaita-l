Om Namo Bhagavate Vasudevaya

Shri Avatar Kishen Kaulji,

Your two queris are interesting. My replies are given below:

1)

Quote
Regarding the horoscope of Bhagwan Ram in the Valmiki Ramayana, it has been discussed times without number in several forums and the only sane conclusion that could be drawn from those discussions was/is that the planetary positions of Bhagwan Ram etc. in the VR are "insertions" (interpolations!) of much later dates like early centuries of CE!

This has been the viewpoint of the western scholars, who thought that the world was created in 4004 BCE or near about, as one of their bishop calculated out.  That the world was created around 4,000 BCE was boldly inserted in the beginning of the King James edition of the Bible till 1980s. That is why the westerners thought that the ancient writings in India are all mythical. It is clear that you are also subscribing to their viewpoint. However among the westerners, there were some who did not agree to the above general western view and Prof. Troyer, a French-man  and one-time principal of the Calcutta Sanskrit College, was one of them. From a thorough study of the Rajatarangini he showed that Kanishka lived before 12th century BCE and Ashka Maurya was before him, which tallies with the Pauranic chronology. An intelligent study of the Rajatarangini itself shows that the claim that the Mahabharata took place in the 32nd century CE is not mythical. Ramayana events occurred a few millennia  before the Mahabharata war. It is a pity that the Indians  today do not value their own great historical texts. I can not go on further on this, as this not a forum for historical discussions

You have in fact confirmed it yourself indirectly that Mesha, Vrisha etc. Rashis are a post Mahabharata phenomenon---a work that has been going through various additions and alterations till at least fourth century BCE!

I  wrote above that the historical evidences tell us that the Mahabharata war took place in the 32nd century BCE  We have the12 rashis (Mesha, Vrishabha rashis etc.) linked with the 27 nakshatras some 5,000 years ago, and not like the westerners like David Pingree  imagined at one time, but without any proof. No Greek or European texts are available to prove what Pingree imagined. Ironically, Pingree's PhD dissertation was on searching for evidence of ancient Greek astrology in the Indian texts. 

Truly,
SKB

       Shri Sunil Bhattacharjyaji,

 Jai Shri Ram!

 We do not find any parameters for horoscope matching in any
 astrological work either---whether post or pre Varahamihira
 of about sixth century CE---- leave alone any dharmashastra
 much less the Vedic lore.

 Even Grihya-Sutras have not talked about any such fad!

 It is therefore inconcievable that something like
 horoscope-matching existed more than a few centuries back in
 India!

 Regarding the horoscope of Bhagwan Ram in the Valmiki
 Ramayana, it has been discussed times without number in
 several forums and the only sane conclusion that could be
 drawn from those discussions was/is that the planetary
 positions of Bhagwan Ram etc. in the VR are
 "insertions" (interpolations!) of much later dates
 like early centuries of CE!

 You have in fact confirmed it yourself indirectly that
 Mesha, Vrisha etc. Rashis are a post Mahabharata
 phenomenon---a work that has been going through various
 additions and alterations till at least fourth century
 BCE!

 That itself means and confirms that the astrological Rashis
 like Mesha etc. came to India after all the
 "layering" to the Mahabharata had been done!

 Since the Valmiki Ramayana is a pre-Mahabharata work, it
 means Mesha, Vrisha etc. Rashis did not exist then--at least
 in predictive astrological sense even as per your own
 assessments!

 And it is a common knowledge that horoscope matching sans
 Mesha etc Rashis is unimaginable!

 Jai Shri Ram!

 Avtar Krishen Kaul

       Dear Bhashkarji,



 I would reaffirm that what I wrote is really really so. 



 Now, coming to your objection, please confirm if you have
 really seen  the planetary positions in the natal horoscope
 of  mother Sita. I could not find that in the Ramayana. I
 know only that she was found as a new-born baby, by Janaka
 in a field. The Ramayana gives the details of Lord Ram's
 horoscope only. Under such a situation, how can Karthikji
 ever think of horoscope matching of Lord Ram and Mother
 Sita? To my understanding, it is obvious, that  Janaka found
 that the position of one graha in Lord Rama's horoscope,
 was adverse to their married life, even though it was in its
 own house (in svashthaana). That is why Janaka got their
 marriage solemnized under a particular nakshatra, to
 mitigate the ill effects, to the extent possible.  



 Now one more point, I wish to add, which probably many
 astrologers are not aware of. Astrology is not fatalistic
 and it is not meant to predict things and sit tight, waiting
 for things to happen. A  good astrologer always thinks of
 the ways and means to reduce the adverse effects seen in the
 horoscope of the people concerned.  



 Regards,

 Sunil KB

  praNAms

  Hare Krishna



  Yes, really so. That is why i wrote a whole lot of

  things,which most astrologers don't know, that rashi
 was

  used in the pre-Mahabharata times only for Suryodaya
 lagna.

  Please read the Ramayana to see why Janaka was
 particularly

  careful to choose the marriage time.



  Ø I think what Sri Karthik prabhuji

  asking is practice of horoscope matching not about

  auspicious muhurtham & its time. For that matter

  for Sri rAma pattAbhishekaM Sri vasishTa maharshi fixed
 the

  time, inspite of that we know the result. jAtaka

  parisheelan involves tallying the amsha / bhAva / janma

  kundali of both vadhu and vara (bride and bride groom)
 and

  checking whether out of 36 guNa-s how many guNa-s are

  matching etc. For this type of horoscope matching Sri

  Karthik prabhuji asking for the reference in ancient
 works.

  Sri Ananda Hudli prabhuji may throw more light on this
 issue

  I believe.



  Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!



  bhaskar
