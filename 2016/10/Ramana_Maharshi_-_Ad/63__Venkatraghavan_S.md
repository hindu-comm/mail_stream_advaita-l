Yes, I agree. Knowing the two is not enough. However, one knows these two -
I and Ishvara, and knows them not to be the same. The question is why does
the aikyAnusandhAnam of sandhyAvandana ask the brahmachAri to say
brahmaivAham? Therefore what the shruti says is one, is neither what I
think as "I", nor what I think as "Ishvara". The fact that I have
misunderstood this is the starting point of enquiry.

case, the father. Hearing a sentence from someone somewhere is not
learning. However, for a thinking student, the natural question that will
arise when he looks at the sun saying "asAvadityo brahma, brahmaivAham
asmi" is how can the shruti say that "I", who consider myself to be a
limited individual, and the all powerful Ishvara is the same? However,
shruti, which cannot be wrong, says that to be the case. Therefore, what I
consider to be as me, and what I consider to be Ishvara must be wrong.

By vichAra I mean the thinking process that is generated when the mahAvAkya
is heard - what would need to be the nature of aham and Brahman for that
equation to hold. If you read Ramana Maharishi's experience of death in his
uncle's house, his thought process is to consider who is I, and what is the
entity that is facing death, and dismiss the body, the mind and intellect
as "I" as part of the thought process.

I do not consider vichAra to be pramANa either. Shruti is the pramANa here,
and whatever thought process that is line with shruti that leads to
understand the real nature of "I" is what I call vichAra.
