The following श्लोक from तत्ववोध comes to mind going through this discussion:

Further those who praise, worship and adore the Jnani, to them go the results of the good actions done by the Jnani. Those who absuse,hate or cause pain or sorrow to a Jnani to them go the results of the sinful actions done by the Jnani. 

Sincerely,
Sanju
