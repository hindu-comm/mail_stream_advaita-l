Namaste Kripaji,

You said that you do no want to debate if Ramana is a jnAni or not. If you
do not dispute it and if the other side says he is a jnAni, then they are
free to conclude that the jnAna that Ramana has is from shruti - because
there is no other means for jnAna, other than shruti.

So if you dispute that conclusion, you will have to necessarily go back
from your stand of not disputing if Ramana is a jnani and assert that
Ramana cannot be a jnAni.

You cannot have it both ways.

Regards,
Venkatraghavan
