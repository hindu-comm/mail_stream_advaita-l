I really have no intention of bringing anyone who is outside into the fold
of the sampradAya. I never said that Ramana Maharshi was part of the
sampradAya, but that his teaching is not divorced from it. I was only
pointing out that there is a difference between the word "import" used in
the book vs the word "importance" that you thought it was. The word
"import" itself means "that which has to be implied". So when Ramana
Maharshi says "import of Shruti statement" it does mean "the implied
meaning of the Shruti statement". My guess is as good as yours as to what
that implied meaning is. I can give the benefit of doubt while you can
doubt the benefit given.

If his teaching was only "who am I?", which I don't think was, then I do
agree with you that it was only tvampada vichAra and it was just a
padavichAra not vAkyavichAra. And thereby, one who stops there may reach
only sAMkhya conclusions.

That is quite possible. And hypothetically considering that not only did
they do that but even the Maharshi himself came across these Shruti
teachings only via them, I don't see any harm in it. It may have helped him
go beyond the tvampada, that you suspect he reached, into tat and asitvam.

The latter is an assumption you are making, since you say that Maharshi
himself did not make a statement that he learnt from Shruti. Wherever he
did compose exactly what Shruti says, beyond the tvampada into
jiveShvaraikya, you say that is due to the influence of others who were
doing some kind of samanvaya. So its impossible to establish either way!

I agree.

I am convinced of the limitations of samAdhi. However, other than removing
doubt in the form of one's being different from anAtma, samAdhi also helps
in vAsanakShaya.

I would myself argue on these lines and even to those who say that
sampradAya is irrelevant placing words of anyone above Shruti, I still do.
That is because one may misunderstand what the words of the person who is
not a shrotriya, but with sampradAyavit, its less likely to go off the path.

Even with the study of mImAMsA, nyAya, vyAkaraNa et al, there are quite a
lot of people who do not have prAmANyabuddhi in shruti. eg, naiyyAyikAs who
place tarka above Shruti. Even with prAmANyabuddhi, one may end up a dvaiti
like many other sampradAyas. My argument, ergo, was that even if one who
has studied these claims the anubhava of whatever Ramana Maharshi claimed,
another cannot prove that. That is, another can still entertain doubt that
you do. The only benefit of doubt you would give is that since he studied
shAstras, maybe he really knows. I am giving the benefit of doubt that
maybe Maharshi studied in earlier life.

I can talk of myself that I do understand the importance of shAstre
prAmANyabuddhi. There cannot be more than one pramANa for any knowledge.
However, w.r.t., I have a question. In a response to someone else, you said
that prAmANyabuddhi in earlier life does not help in this life. This is
something I am unable to understand as to why that is. In conclusion, I
completely agree with your analysis, except for the knowledge gained with
prAmANyabuddhi in earlier life not helping in this one. Please clarify.
