The purpose of this exercise is not to prove whether Ramana is a jnAni.
That you have failed to even respond to that question means that the
opponent's propositionthat he is a jnAni, stands proven as it is
uncontested. The purpose is to establish whether whether Ramana went
through shAstra vichAra or not.

As there are no other means for shAstra vichAra, and since it was said that
there is no evidence of his having done shAstra vichAra in the current
life, it stands to reason that he went through shAstra vichAra in the past
life.

However, this elementary logic seems to be clearly beyond your
understanding.

Regards
Venkatraghavan
