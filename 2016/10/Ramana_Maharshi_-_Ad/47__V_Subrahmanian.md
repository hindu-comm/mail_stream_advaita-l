Just wanted to point out that the above is not what the correct meaning of
his expression:

अहं मनुरभवं सूर्यश्चेत्यादिना सर्वभावापत्तिं ब्रह्मविद्याफलं परामृशति ;
पश्यन्सर्वात्मभावं फलं प्रतिपेदे   - shankara says: by saying 'I was Manu,
surya, etc.' the mantra is showing that the fruit of brahman-knowledge is
'become all.'. So, it is not any recollection of past incarnations.
