​First of all, these are not those tattva-s which are said to be one by
shruti.
The parichchhina-chaitanya is not tattva.
So, no knowing these two is not enough.​

​Taught?
By whom?
If he was taught, then you are in my camp, not other's.​
BTW, just 'hearing' a sentence from someone somewhere can't be termed as
learning the same. More so when the meaning was never taught.

​What this vichAra is? I'll give you some time to ponder.
Think about the nature of vichAra. And, when you are sure that it is not a
prAmANa, then I'll look at rest of your post.
If I continue now, I'll have to propound many things.​
Moreover, I don't want to continue by assuming any of your faults(wrong
ideas) granted. It increases complexity of my answers.
