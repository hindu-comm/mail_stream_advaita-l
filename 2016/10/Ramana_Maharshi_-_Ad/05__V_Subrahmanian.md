That is fine. But that example can be applied to the case of someone who
has not performed shastra adhyayana in the current life and yet is a jnani
since birth itself and even gives upadesha.

There is no such requirement of knowing the immediate or remote previous
lives of jnanis. For example the case of Sri Chandrashekhara Bharati
Swamiji as stated by his Disciple Swamiji. Going by the above: 1. It would
be impossible to gain aparoksha jnana by anyone since there is no jnani at
all.The teaching by Krishna: 'Approach Jnanis and seek the Knowledge and
they will teach'  will be a waste since there will be no one called Jnanis.
In fact one reason for the acceptance of Jivan mukti is to enable the
dissemination of jnana to others.

 2. After the period of Vyasa, and outside the Mahabharata and Brahma
sutras, no one can become a jnani and the vedanta shastra is of no use in
the present day!! The sutra stated is not confined to the instances in the
Upanishads but a guideline for all times.
