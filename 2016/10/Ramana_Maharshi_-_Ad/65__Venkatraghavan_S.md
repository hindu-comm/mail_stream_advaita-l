I agree with your comments Swamiji. However, I am not trying to say that
the knowledge of shuddha chaitanya was gained by any means other than
vedAnta sAdhana.

The point I was trying to make was that for an uttamAdhikAri,
aikyAnusandhAnam may lead to jnAna, provided there has been sufficient
shravaNa - manana - nidhidhyAsana in the previous life. If aikyAnusandhAnam
triggers the activation of all the advaita samskAras, reminding one of the
shuddha brahma and shuddha aham padAs, the aikya message contained in the
aikyAnusandhAnam can generate jnAna  (not will, but can).

Further, there have been several examples of jnAnis who have ostensibly not
done jnAna sAdhana in the current life, but are said to have "gained" jnAna
in that life- Vamadeva, JaDabharata, HastAmalaka etc.

I am not saying that jnAna utpatti is only possible in the current life, or
that jnAna utpatti was because of some other means than shruti, it could
also be that jnAna was generated in a previous life, but there were
pratibandhakas preventing the jnAni from getting the jnAna phala in the
previous birth. A subsequent birth may resolve those pratibandhas and jnAna
phala may be obtained then.

Therefore, there are a couple of  possibilities
1)  JnAna was gained in a previous life, but there were pratibandhakas
then, which have been resolved in the current life. Once resolved jnAna
phala was gained in the current birth.
2) JnAna sAdhana was done in a previous life, but before jnAna was gained,
the sAdhaka died. In the next birth, they were born in circumstances
favourable to jnAna utpatti, and some incident triggered the activation of
advaita vAsanas which led to Atma vichAra on lines of shruti (as recalled
from previous birth) and jnAna utpatti in current life. This jnAna was made
dRDha and they became jIvanmuktAs.

Regards,
Venkatraghavan
