I'll be very happy to stop posting critical essays. But, that may harm
those who are ready for next step, to question more to get more clarity.
Believers are lower-grade. They must continue on there path. Because, that
may take them to the correct one.

In true sense, I started by believing vivekAnanda, then rAmakR^iShNa, then
ramaNa, then uriyA bAbA, then sha~NkarAchArya, etc. Now, I'm independently
studying, not relying on their talks wholly. Now, shruti is more important
for me, logic is needed more than bhAShya.
I know that such transformation doesn't occur in everyone's life. But,
wherever and whenever it happens, it needs some help. This thread may help
to turn their direction to pramANa.
