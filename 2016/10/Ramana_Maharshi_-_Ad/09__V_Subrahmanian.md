I am not clear how you use the example. What I had asked was whether he did
Vedanta adhyayana also apart from Veda?  For, mere veda study would not be
conducive to Atma jnana. You have not provided that information.

In all cases the cause of jnana is vedanta vichara. That is non-negotiable.

The above argument suffers from a serious illogicality. We will have to
restrict only those jnani-ns spoken of in the Veda/smriti to qualify for
the above. Just because a jnani of the post-veda/smriti period exists we
cannot say he has gained knowledge form a paurusheya source.  The purpose
of the sutra I referred to is to help us decide on those cases such as
Ramana. In fact Shankara has said that those who are not eligible to study
the Upanishads can get Jnana through purana, paurusheya source.

What you say //The cause of Ramana's jnana could not be established and
hence it is a mere belief that he was a jnAni.// happily applies to
Shankaracharya too.  Is Shankaracharya a Vedic-personage? It is only we
Advaitins *believe* that he is a Jnani; non-advaitins care least about this
belief.  For them he is an ajnani. Our belief that Shankara is a Jnani is
also from others saying so; we have no power to judge that ourselves. For,
even an ajnani can do the anuvāda, alluding, of the shrutis and that can
create a belief in someone that he is a Jnani.

I mentioned that outside Veda Vyasa's woks and period, there cannot be
anyone who can be admitted as Jnani because there is no way one can decide
whether one is since it is still a belief or someone else in whom we have
shraddhā has to vouch for it.  That is why I said in an earlier post that
in this field logic will never work; it is only āpta vākya for the seeker
or Grace that guides him to the Jnani-guru. Even Ramana has said he has a
Guru, the inner Self, Arunachala.

Shankara did not say how he became jnani.  We have to only believe that he
became one.

Now, this is self-contradictory.  On the one had you want to accept Ramana
as a Jnani. Tell me if 'Jnani' can be anywhere outside the purview of the
Veda? It is only within the range of Veda do we have the concept of a
Jnani. So, his alleged not acknowledging Veda as the source of Jnana will
never disqualify him from being a Jnani, which automatically means he is
within the purview of the Veda. In fact Vedic scholars approached him for
clarifications and blessings. Those who are accepted by all as being within
the Veda sampradaya have acknowledged Ramana as jnani. Do you think you are
better qualified than these personages to pass judgement on Ramana? In fact
this is what is contempt to shastra. The shastra never puts a bar on
Ramana.  It is because of Jnanis that the shastra gets its value. If there
are no jnanis the shastra will be merely empty words.
