​If this was so meaningless, you wouldn't have posted it here.
It has some purpose.

Shraddhaa you are referring is very important - but that is defined as -

​The misconception which is well spread among even advaitin-s is that they
think that avadhAraNa is assumptions.
It is not.
avadhAraNa means conclusion. And, that is not same as assumption. It must
be reached by using logic.
So, in this way even those teaching advaita are reaping benefits by making
fool of students. That's why we see that guru's rarely get questioned
seriously, for their anger(visible or not) may arise and destroy you. :P
​

> Whether one is jnaani or not cannot be litmus-tested,

​
Yes, that's why shruti says disciple to reach shrotriya​ and brahmaniShTha,
since no one can know who is brahmasaMstha!! :P

Hence one can say he is shaastravit not necessarily jnaani - but hopefully

​That's why I said that assumption is base of the whole breed of new
vedAnta sampradAya.

​You may need some help for differntiating 'negation'(bAdha) of GYAna and
anityatva of the same.
​I think you are capable, and will find the difference of what I told and
what you are superimposing on me.

​Then accept that GYAna is not a mean of cessation of saMsAra, since the
GYAna was not lost and he got birth too.

The portion of gItA which is exclusively for yoga(karma), is being bent
here for some unknown reason.
God know what purpose this dishonesty will serve.​

​So, here :
abiding in knowledge = anubhava
I leave people to decide, where this useless laxaNA will lead.

​I've seen K Sadananda doing this all over apauruSheyatva thread in many
forums. He doesn't have any idea about the meaning and context of the word
in which it occurs during discussion in older text. So, he always tends to
bring his version.
​
Rest of his post doesn't deserve attention, since this apauruSheytva thing
is too much disturbing.
