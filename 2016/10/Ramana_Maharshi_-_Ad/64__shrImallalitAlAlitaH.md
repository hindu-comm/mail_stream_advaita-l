I think, I missed to reply to this one.
It needs some help.

It doesn't say to know. It says to do upAsana. That again is to gain
specific results. The word viGYAna here means upAsana.

You are heading towards guess. That's not what we are talking here.
The saying is easily in sync with the karma/upAsana prakaraNa. You don't
need to force it to GYAna.

*To add, unless you know shuddha-jIva and shuddha-brahman through means
other than mahAvAkya-s, there is no way to relate padam to them. So, they
can't remind them and hence there is no possibility of aikya-bodha.*

Look above. This is not needed to save prAmANya of shruti.
