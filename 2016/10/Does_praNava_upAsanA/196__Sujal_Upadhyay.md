Namaste Sri Chandramouli ji,

SrI vidyAraNya svAmI has also mentioned 'Amrit bindu, et all upanishads' in
the same dhytAna dIpa prakaraNa and has said that one can get brahmagYAna
by yoga and by GYAna. svAmI ji also quotes gItA. I dont have panchadashI at
hand. Will quote exact quote later.

Hari OM
