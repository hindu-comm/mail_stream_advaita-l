The crux of the matter lies here in अत्यन्तविशिष्टकर्मज्ञानसाध्यत्वात्। To
my understanding, plain upAsana is not allowed per se, and needs to be
almost always combined with karma. One's ashrama karmas cannot be given up,
be they as accessory to another main karma, japa or upAsana. The phala is
said to be nullified when these are not done along with svakarma. Even in
case of purashcharaNa of a mantra, one has to do the ashrama karma along
with it. In case of Om, many traditions restrict it to only sannyAsis; its
the only mantra a sannyAsi is allowed/ required to utter. He doesn't have
any specific prescribed ashrama karma and this Omkara alone can fill up his
entire day in various ways.

Then again, there is a specific way near the time of death for the upAsaka
to leave one's body through suShumnanADi, "व्यपोह्य शीर्षकपाले"।
Undoubtedly, इह एव यत्नः कर्तव्यः :)

Kind rgds,
