One can use OmkAra or any mantra as a support for either upAsana or
nidhidhyAsana.

The former is well known. The latter is  mentioned in Mandukya kArika when
discussing the Upanishad equating the amAtra of OmkAra with turIya. One
starts off by drawing the attention to the mantra, then moving that
attention to the silence between two repetitions, expanding the duration of
the silence, gradually withdrawing the mantra and focusing on that because
of which there is awareness of silence - that is the sAkshi.
