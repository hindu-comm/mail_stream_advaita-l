Namaste Praveenji,

The Lord also said that he delivered the discourse in Yoga-yukta state.

Kind regards,

 Lord Krishna did not
 forget Gita. How cam he? Please do not go by the translation
 and better read what the Lord said to Arjuna as given in the
 Sanskrit verses.


 The relevant
 part of the verse reads so in Sanskrit: न च
 साऽद्य पुनर्भूयः
 स्मृतिर्मे
 सम्भविष्यति । The explanation may
 not have been given, but the translation is not incorrect,
 since it literally reads as: "And now, that
 recollection of mine [regarding the narration] is not
 possible".

 Kind rgds,
