Namaste Chandramouliji, Sujalji,

I caught up with this thread between yesterday and today. May I make a
couple of comments? Please ignore if I am disturbing the exchange midway.

Here, the mind rooted in brahman need not mean vRtti that comes with the
jnAtR-jnAna-bheda/ tripUTi, as in SS. It is the resolution of the mind (and
therefore also the jnAtR) into the object of the vRtti, which is mahAvAkya,
leading to NS.

I hope you mean shUnyavRtti by shUnya.

vRtti is a modification of the mind and when it is without modification, it
is merged into brahman as brahman. The steady maintained vRtti is SS
(specifically शब्दानुविद्धसविकल्पसमाधि as per Drigdrishyaviveka), which
culminates into NS.

The coming out of NS indicates the resolution of tripuTi in bIjarUpa. Just
like one comes out of suShupti but still will have experienced happiness,
so too during NS.
