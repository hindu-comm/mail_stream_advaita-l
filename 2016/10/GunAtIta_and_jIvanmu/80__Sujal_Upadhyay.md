praNAms,

oh and one more point. Destruction of mind does not lead to NS. NS is
rising beyond mind. but first mind has to be rooted in Brahman by
akaNDAkAra vritti. If mind is destroyed, then one cannot come down to
earthly plane. Sri Ramakrishna says, after 21 days, connection with body
drops permanently. i.e. one is not able to enter into body anymore.

Destruction of mind leads to moksha. After that of Ishvara needs to use the
body (all 6 kosha-s) for loka-kalyANa, then ego, vritti-s etc are created,
but if it is not created, IMO, after mind is destroyed, there is no
returning back.

I do not say destruction of mind leads to NS. I have said earlier that
repeated entering into NS leads to moksha.
