To clarify,

Yes, to the tarkika reference ( yauktika derivation).

Unlike, experience of happiness in waking or dream (thru upAdhi), there is
no such happiness (or any vyavahAra) experienced in deep sleep (while in
deep sleep), on account of unity with the Supreme Self,  not know anything
at all, either external, or internal, craves no desires etc

यत्र सुप्तो न कं चन कामं कामयते, न कं चन स्वप्नं पश्यति

Upon waking, it is asserted that the self-effulgence (sacchidAnanda) is
certainly present in deep sleep, but it is not perceived on account of
unity (saMprasAda, ekibhutha, svapiti - svam apeeto bhavati).

Unlike Deep Sleep, in waking, the upAdhi is definitely available for
generating brahmAtmaikya jnAna ( aikya jnAna alone is the  experience of
happiness)

I would say, the very knowing that one is bhUma, itself, is happiness (or
svarUpAnanda).

Agree, if you meant saMyak GYAna by knowing well ...(without any trace of
saMshaya or viparyaya etc)
