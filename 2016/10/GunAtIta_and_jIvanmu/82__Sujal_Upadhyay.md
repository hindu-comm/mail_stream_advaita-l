Namaste

I agree with both of you Sri Praveen ji and Sri Chandramouli ji
This type of discussion helps me focus on Brahman and help in my sAdhanA.
Desires for liberation intensifies. I am enjoying this discussion :)

the NS part, whether any vritti exists in NS or not, or steady vritti leads
one to NS or steady vritti on true nature of Brahman is NS - will
contemplate and read Vivekchudamani and if any doubt will come back to
harras you all :)

Thank you
OM
Sujal
