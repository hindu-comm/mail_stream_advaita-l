Yes, since, in deep sleep, there is no experience of anything ..(eki bhUtha)

similarly, in NS, it is knowing the advaya , eka rasa ghanam of Brahma
svarUpa

so, I understand this very knowing (परमार्थदर्शिनां) is the happiness
(Ananda - yo *vai bhUmA* tat *sukham*) attributed during NS ( which one
recalls / recollected after coming out of NS).
