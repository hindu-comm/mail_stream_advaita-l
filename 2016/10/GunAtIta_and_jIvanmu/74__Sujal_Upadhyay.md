Namaste Sri Chandramouli ji,

Thank you for explanation. I will leave other points and contemplate on
them.

Just one point. If there is no mind, does it mean it is shunya? Brahman is
already present isn't it.
One last point :) Do you think destruction of mind is possible. If yes,
what will you cal this state to be?

Kind Regards
Sujal
