Namaste Sri chandramouli ji,

oh thank you for your concern. Be assured I am not disturbed. Even if I am,
it is only for a day (generally), as next day after meditation I am good to
go. I am not perfect and my own understanding is limited. I am open to
correction. If I do not get it now, I may get it at a proper time.

*I am not sure if you are using the term “keep vrittis still “ in the yogic

Please give me a day or two to reply.

Kind Regards
Sujal
