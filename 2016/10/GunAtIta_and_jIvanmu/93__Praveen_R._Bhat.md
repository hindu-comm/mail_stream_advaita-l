Surely not a match, thanks.

As I explained to Sujalji, I didn't mean destruction by resolution, but I
see how that can go off in meaning. I am not sure if I should used Ramana
Maharshi's term here with the ongoing debate, but he called it manolayA.

I have a little trouble understanding this description. What do you
specifically mean when you say maintaining the "vRtti of brahman"? Is it
vichArarUpa as aham brahmAsmi or did you mean brahman as itself an object
of vRtti. Although you indicated the latter in an earlier mail, I was
assuming it was in a manner of phrasing alone and you didn't mean it, since
brahman can never be an object vide Kenamantra यदि मन्यसे सुवेदेति, where
Bhashyakara says that only a knowable thing can be सुवेद, not ब्रह्म।
ब्रह्म is विदितादविदाद् अन्यः। If you meant the former, then it is indeed
akhaNDAkAra vRtti, which as I understand removes avidyA and then removes
this vRtti itself. Then there would be no vRtti.

The only other possibility may be that I misunderstood and you are calling
NS that state of effortless being in brahman without maintaining a vRtti
per se, but vRtti w.r.t. to any object, which would be as Drigdrishyaviveka
puts it: यत्र यत्र मनो याति तत्र तत्र समाधयः, in which case my
understanding is the same.

I did read it due to which I started my reply on this thread.

Did you have a particular shAnkarabhAshya in mind that you could refer me
to?

I don't think I understand the significance of residual brahman here. If I
add the words you suggest, then the vRtti will stop being a vRtti, since it
will not have any modification. The mind will be merged (laya) in brahman.

The having merged into brahman, being purely brahman alone, there cannot be
a vRtti. What am I missing? This statement is unclear to me.

 I already asked a reference above unless you meant commentary on VC.

True.
