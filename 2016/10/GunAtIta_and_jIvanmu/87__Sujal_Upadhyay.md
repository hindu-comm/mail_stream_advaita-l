Namaste Praveen ji,


Well, even in deep-sleep, the experience of happiness is only recalled/
recollected on waking. It is not really experienced on waking. The tarka
used there is that what is collected alone can be recollected, so the
recollected happiness was collected during sleep via experience. So too in
NS, experienced during NS, recalled after NS.


Agree completely.

OM
Sujal
