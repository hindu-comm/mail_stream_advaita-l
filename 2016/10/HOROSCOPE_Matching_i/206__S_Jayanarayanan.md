I've been wondering whether the use of Horoscopes for Hindu match-making was present in ancient times or is comparatively recent.

One of the means of knowing Dharma or Ethics in the Hindu context is to look at the Itihasas such as the Ramayana and the Mahabharata. Surprisingly, I've not been able to locate a single instance of Astrological Horoscopes (or Astrology in general) being used in the context of a marriage in these two Ancient Epics!

Here are some examples of marriages conducted in religious history:

(1) Ramayana: Rama and Sita
 Choice of Groom: Whosoever can string (or Break!) the Bow of Shiva.

(2) Ramayana: Bharata to Maandavi; Shatrughna to Shrutakiirti
 Choice of Groom: Proposed by Sage Vishvamitra.

(3) Mahabharata: Arjuna and Draupadi
 Choice of Groom: Whosoever can shoot a target by looking at its reflection in water.

(4) Mahabharata: Bhima and Hidimba
 Choice of Groom: Love!

(5) Mahabharata: Krishna and Rukmini
 Choice of Groom: "Carried away"!
