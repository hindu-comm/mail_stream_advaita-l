Namaste Venkatraghavan ji

You had referred to the mirror analogy. Just a idea here...
My understanding of connection between svataHprAmAnyam and Apaurusheyatvam -

Apaurusheyatvam is important because the initial vRtti produced by shruti
vAkya -s , i.e., the 'untested' artha grasped by each of us by
shadArthasambandha is also instantaneously grasped as pramA rather than
rejected as bhrama or saMshaya-sahita (doubt-ridden).

We don't doubt the mirror because we believe the mirror is flat (veda is
apauruSheya) and not concave etc., as in a mirror in an amusement park
where there is an agenda to distort and amuse. Even so any pauruSheya vAkya
can be doubted even as it is heard, like we doubt a mirror in an amusement
park. So saMshaya rahita pramA may not arise when i am standing in front of
a mirror with unknown topology or listening to a pauruSheya vAkya.

The Apta case is taken care of because *by definition*, one who is part of
the advaita vedAntic teaching tradition is an Apta. His vAkya is only
anuvAda of shruti.

Namaste,
In addition to what Praveenji said, where pramANa leads to a conclusion
which is  apparently contradictory to what one gets from other pramANas,
one necessarily has to adopt yukti to determine which is correct.

This does not make the pramANa  paratah - only determine which pramANa has
been applied incorrectly.

Regards,
Venkatraghavan
