Yes, such contradiction can come from knowledge which has been comprehended
by any pramANa (pratyaksha,anumANa, aagama etc). But there is one catch
though -- such correcting knowledge itself has to be without any bhAda from
other knowledge. That means to say -- all correcting knowledges themselves
has to be pramA.

When your vision of 'snake' is contradicted by knowledge that 'it is a
rope', that rope knowledge itself must be pramA (yathArtha) by its own
merits. Otherwise it does not have a potency to invalidate snake knowledge.

In dream, it is not same pramAnas at play.  Otherwise when I see I am the
king in the dream, why others will not see I am the king? But in waking
state when I see myself a king, others also see I am king. So, the
conclusion is that my "pratyaksha" in the dream is not the same kind of
pratyaksha in waking state.

If authorship is denied based on anAdi argument, so also kalpita doctrine
has to be denied, for after all any kalpana has to have a starting point.
Another problem is that, in anAdi argument for kalpana, at least the time
itself must be kept outside kalpna domain. Otherwise anyOnAShraya.
