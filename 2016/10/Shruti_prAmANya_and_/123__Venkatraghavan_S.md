Namaste Subbuji,
Thanks for sharing this excerpt from AchArya's book.

"Consider the case of a person who has approached a Guru and carried out
intense spiritual discipline in an earlier birth but failed to get the
realization of the Truth before passing away. Such a person would easily
get knowledge in his next birth. In exceptional cases, he may not even
require a Guru."

The above section is particularly relevant to the other thread. I had tried
to present the same idea there.

Regards,
Venkatraghavan
