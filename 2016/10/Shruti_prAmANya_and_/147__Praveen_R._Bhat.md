Why would anyone have a shankA in a pramANa at all? I am not talking of
whether eyes are pramANa for seeing but whether eyes are seeing the right
thing.

No one talked about prAmANya utpatti. Only tested prAmANya was mentioned.
aprAmANyashankAnivRtti results in right prAmANyabuddhi. Else it is mere
faith.

As opposed to no manas in waking?! The indriyAs are part of the
sUkShmasharIra which last throughout the journey.

Why deny it right away? Everything has a purpose. This is like saying I am
going to die anyway, why live?!

You seem to be obsessed with baudhAs; why not follow them if you really
think they are doing the right thing? This is like saying that dvaitins are
like chArvAkas, since they also consider the world as real.

Thats precisely the entire problem of a jIva.

Who's to say that what a dream king does? He does exactly what the waker's
saMskAras offer him to build. For a dreamer, all his sources of knowledge
are given. A dreamer who knows that he is dreaming is no longer a dreamer.
He has woken upto the reality.

This itself is assumption based on the waking analysis, which may very well
be a dream! You cannot be sure, just as the dreamer is not. If one's
saMskAras of this avasthAtraya parIkShA is strong, his dreamer counterpart
could also analyse whether or not he is dreaming.

Similarly then, you can stop analysing anything that happens after death.
Why should you, since it should all after a fact? What Vaikuntha and what
Lord! All these are also equally fancy words that have no value to one
living.

As above. The words that you find fancy have no value for you may well be
true, but we do find value in them, since its serves a great purpose.
Suppose you convince yourself before sleep that if you see a dream lion,
that is not going to harm you at all. Not only that, suppose you further
tell him: if you have a gun, that is useless there. Its just a fancy word,
having no value, your dreamer counterpart is not going to stop running away
from a lion, or shooting the lion with this "fancy" gun, is he?

Not true. Why should all that co-exists be of the same nature! The levels
of reality are different.
