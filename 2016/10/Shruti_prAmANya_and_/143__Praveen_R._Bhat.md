Why is dream falsified on waking then? The same waking pramANas were active
then. The subject doesn't have a choice in using the pramANa differently,
but he can reject it. Even if you rejected the pramANa once, the prAmANya
has gone w.r.t. that pramA, because it is subjective to that individual.

(and prAmANya is confirmed). But my question was how do you substantiate
lack of apAmANya when it was said vedAs are also kalpita (by a single
chaitanya) along with entire jagat advaita system? Isn't it kalpita
equivalent to authored?

You can superimpose authorship idea on advaitins for Vedas, when we say
that kalpita has a beginning. anAdi works great for us.
