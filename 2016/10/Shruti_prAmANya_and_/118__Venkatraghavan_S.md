not arise - some jnAna (even bhrama may arise). shruti prAmANya-buddhi must
also definitely be there. However,  even that prAmANya-buddhi is based on
certain basic axioms that need to be accepted for that prAmANya-buddhi to
arise. And I believe it is to cultivate a belief in these axioms that
shraddhA is talked about.
