Advaitins will follow Meemaamsakas in Vyavahaara. Therefore Vedas are
Apaurusheya.

Later means after Vyavahara has ended the question of Apaurusheyatva
will not arise. Because who will be there to ask and who will be there
to answer?
Another answer is after Vyavahara has ended there will not be words,
debates, question and answers, and no Vedas also. If there are no
Vedas the
author becomes a Vandhya Putra or Shasha Vishana.

In a dream we can accept validity of a Pramana. But it will not mean
we are accepting validity always and even after dream is over. You may
have a close friend in dream. You will believe his sayings in the
dream because it is Apta Vaakya for you in dream. It is a Pramana. But
when you wake up you may not believe him.
