If a person has jaundice and sees the world yellow, does his sight have
pramANya or does it have aprAmANya? And how will you land there without
testing?

Moreover, advaitins reach advaita by tAtparyanirNaya, which is testing of
prAmANya. Else it would be blind faith which takes all contradictory
statements of shruti as-is and then one is likely to lose even that faith.
