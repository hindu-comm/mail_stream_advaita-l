Firstly, experience is a loaded term, because there is no objective Brahma
aikya experience - the one experiencing is Brahman. Our desire to validate
the message given by shruti through an objective experience is evidence of
aprAmANya buddhi in shruti.
Secondly, even if you did not mean aikya as an objective experience, the
context of the statement was in the *acceptance* of aikyA as pramA, not to
imply a difference between the two experientially.

For example - like the pot-space is fundamentally non-different from
room-space, and the perceived differences are really due to the upAdhi (pot
and room) - in reality there is only one all-pervading space. We can extend
this to chaitanyam also - in reality there is only one all-pervading
consciousness, the differences are upAdhi differences (aikya sAdhaka
yukti); like the difference between a reflection and the original in mirror
is only a mithyA difference (or the difference of space in different
enclosures is only a mithyA difference), we can say that the difference
between jIva and Brahman is only mithya (bheda khaNDana yukti), etc.
