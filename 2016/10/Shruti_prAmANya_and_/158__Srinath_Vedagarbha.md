That all make sense if such creation cycle are accepted as really real. But
you know when you deny creation itself (ajAti vAda) then there is no
validity for apourushEya vAda.

When you already know this dvandva-jagat is due to  avidya, by implication
we already know vEdas (and all other texts) are equally avidyamaya. Why
call vEda is pramA janaka? why introduce yet another dvaita of  apourusEya
vs. pourushEya ?

Same example -- when snake appearance is already known to be illusory, does
it matter snake is aadishESha (vEda) or takShaka (Bible/Quron etc)?
