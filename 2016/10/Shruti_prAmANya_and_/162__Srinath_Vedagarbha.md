Fort might be quite old in the dream, but people do not use such anAdi
objects/texts to prove their world is illusory world. You say dream is
illusory after wake up, but not while dreaming.

Also, dreaming and waking state are two nodes in the liner time scale. You
may deny content of dream, but you cannot deny its actual occurrence, do
you? But you do deny this vyavahAra in all three periods of time. That's
the big difference. Dream analogy is flawed.
