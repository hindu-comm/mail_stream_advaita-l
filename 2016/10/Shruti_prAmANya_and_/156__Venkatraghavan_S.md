My goal is to make these concepts clear and doubt free.

No problem.

What about the horns of a hare? Each exists independently, but not
together. anupalabdhi can be applied for abhAva features of bhAva vastu
also.

The attributes of cause are in effect. The cause can be inferred from the
presence of those attributes in the effect. Human beings have defects. I
can see defects in folk literature. Different people report the same story
with different, contradictory details.  Hence folk stories are composed by
human authors.

Your argument was that there was no known author of Veda, and to reply to
that I said there can't be a known author, because I haven't seen one. For
unknown author, the next sentence below was said.

Again it's because of the principle of parsimony. I do not postulate
something not observed to prove something observed.

Not true. Even existing objects can come under the purview of anupalabdhi.
A pot missing from a room is known after searching for it and not finding
it.

tarka (pratyAnumAna to be specific) how can texts with author can possibly
teach such viShaya. As a pUrvapaxin, I argue there is no alOukika at all
(because it is not given to our pratyaksha and pratyksha based anumAna).
So, there is no valid hEtu for your argument.

No, that it teaches alaukika things is not in question, the validity of
what is taught is in question. Veda says that if you want to go to heaven
do jyotishToma. That there is a heaven and I will go there if I do the
specific ritual in a specific manner is an alaukika matter. Why? I search
for heaven on earth as described and cannot find it. Hence the veda is not
talking of laukika things here.

Whether what I am talking of is valid is a separate matter.

is untrue, prove that you will not go to heaven if you do jyotoshToma as
described. If you cannot, what I say is proved as there is no bAdhaka

matters, we cannot conclude that he would have the knowledge of alaukika
matters that are beyond the world.

You are confusing subject matter with its validity.

of bhAva vastu.

See above for why bhAva vastu can have abhAva property.

Yes, correct. I meant unless.

> Speculating jagat will sublate one day is quite leap and forward looking
aspect. Is this sublation a speculative or a pramAna-siddha? It cannot be
pramANa-siddha (at least yet) as we are still debating apourushEyatvaM of
vEda as a pramANa. Unless apouruShyatvaM itself is siddha (I mean all
bhAdaka-s are resolved), vEda is quite useless as a pramANa in such
speculations. Then all you have is other six pramANas. Are you saying jagat
sublation is siddha based one of those six ?

I say that vedAs are valid because of svatah prAmANya, not because of
apaurusheyatva. Please also note that svatah prAmANya is not because of
apaurusheyatva, as even paurusheya pramANas also have svatah prAmANya.

The sublation of jagat is by definition an alaukika matter, which is
outside the jurisdiction of any other pramANa. So bAdha of a cognition
generates by veda on an alaukika matter by any other pramANa is not
possible.
