On this, a pUrvapaxin (to PM) would ask;

1. How do you know vEdas have no sources?

2. Given that we do not see any texts without author and we always see a
text has known author or forgotten author, so also vEdas must have "some
author(s)" even though we might not know who they are.

What is your reply?
