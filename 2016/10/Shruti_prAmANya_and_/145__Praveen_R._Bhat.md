True, that pramA is by own merits because it was tested to have come from
valid pramANa. That changes nothing. In fact, it strengthen the case of
being tested.

Why? Don't you see in dream with the sense organs? Which other pramANas
than the six do you have in dream? The golakA may be different "kalpita"
ones, but its the same senses. Else why would you wake up to say I saw
myself as a king? Its the same you who saw in the dream with the same set
of pramANas you have in waking.

Finally, we will deny everything, since we have only one reality. The
kalpita doctrine is an explanation used for those who perceive duality and
cannot understand the single reality there is. In your dream, the king was
kalpita, but that king didn't think that he had a beginning with your
dream. He doesn't understand the time that you do. He thinks he has taken
birth in a royal family and became the successor king.

This non-existing anyonAShraya problem you think there is, and keep coming
back to was refuted by Subbuji at least once. If you have forgotten, please
refer back. Your assumption that time must be kept outside of kalpanA is
incorrect. You assume that kalpita should have a beginning and then based
on an erroneous assumption, you make more errors.
