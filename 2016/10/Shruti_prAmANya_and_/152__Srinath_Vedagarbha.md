How do you know no sources? It could be forgotten sources as well.

No, the testing is all about either remove doubt about prAmANya or to
confirm it is indeed aprAmaNya. testing will never generate previously
non-existing prAmANya afresh.

Simple, in case of no-cause cognition, absence of any bhAdaka establishes
its validity.

In cases of cognition known to having causes (pouruShEya shabda), you need
to have sAdanA-pramANa, because you know it has cause but not sure cause is
free from flaws.

That's correct. It is the prAmANya svatatsva.

It is the same as in legal system -- by default you are not-guilty (same as
having prAmANya) unless proven otherwise in the court of law. You do not
need to establish you are not guilty afresh, but show flaw in evidences
which are saying you are guilty.
