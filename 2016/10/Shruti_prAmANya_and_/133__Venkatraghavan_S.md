Namaste,
In addition to what Praveenji said, where pramANa leads to a conclusion
which is  apparently contradictory to what one gets from other pramANas,
one necessarily has to adopt yukti to determine which is correct.

This does not make the pramANa  paratah - only determine which pramANa has
been applied incorrectly.

Regards,
Venkatraghavan
