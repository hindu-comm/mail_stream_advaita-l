It does not.

Testing only removes shanka of aprAmANya (in some case testing confirms
aprAmaNya if the initial jnAna is ayathArtha). Testing does not introduce
prAmANya afresh.

So, parIxa is for aprAmANya shankAnivrutti / aprAmANya siddhi, not for
prAmANya utpatti.

No, you do not use same bahEndriya-s for dream, but manas is involved in
dream.

That exactly was my point. When you are dening everything, but why
introduce all sort of apourushEya/prAmANya etc? Why not deny it right away
without pulling nirduSTa vEda? At least bOudha-s are doing right thing.

But such dream king does not know his world is kalpita neither. Neither he
does not use any of dream texts and use fancy words as prAmANya/apourushEya
to deny reality to his domain. All denial of dream is after the fact.

In the same line, if you are denying this jagat while in it, there is no
value using fancy & convoluted concepts such as prAmANya/apourushEya etc.

It was not.

I argued back then -- if avidya and its result kalpana is said to be no
beginning, logically it must be co-exist with that chaitanya vastu and
hence must be self-same nature (svabhAva).
