Knowledge gained by your vision is by default prAmaNya (this prAmANya
svatstva) unless it is contradicted by other piece of knowledge that "I am
having jaundice". So, any aprAMANya, if at all it exist, has to supply from
outside of the initial knowledge. This is the doctrine of aprAmANya parataH.

Every time you do not test your vision to confirm the validity of your
vision. Validity is intrinsic unless known otherwise.

along with entire jagat advaita system? Isn't it kalpita equivalent to
authored?
