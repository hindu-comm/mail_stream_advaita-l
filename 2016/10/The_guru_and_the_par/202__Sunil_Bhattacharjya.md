Dear firends,

>From  Sri Sadasiva Brahmendra's own work we know that his guru was Sri Paramasivendra. Now, there was one  Paramasivendra, who was a mathadhipati of the Kanchi Kamakoti matha, in the past. There is another opinion, according to which Sri Paramasivendra was not  a mathadhipati. I wish to know the details of the second claim as to who was this paramasivendra and also who was his guru, their times and and what are the proofs in favour of the second opinion.

Regards, 
Sunil KB
