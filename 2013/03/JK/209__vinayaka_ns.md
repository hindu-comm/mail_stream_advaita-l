This is a good point. Just because he was goofed by the  Masters of
Theosophical society doesn't mean that there are no better alternatives or
all the teachers and traditions are equally trash. This should be kept in
mind at least by those who are born and bought up in the Vedic Culture. I
personally feel that searching for clarity in that maze is a sheer waste of
time and afraid one may have to wait for clarity for eternity.

It is interesting to note that some people brand his teachings as advaitic
which he himself never claimed so.

Anyway, his biography is very interesting.
