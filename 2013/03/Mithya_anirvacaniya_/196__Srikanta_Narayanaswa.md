_____________________________________________________________________________-By itself the term "Vandhyaputra"is meaningless.It means that the son of a barren woman which is self-contradictory.The term has to be followed by the rest of the sentence"Vandhya putrah ajayata'or "nahi vandhya putrah jayeta".The sentence is mere reprimanding the "Purvapakshi"(Objector).Better examples are "Horns of a hare""Mrga tushnika"etc.
