Namaste

The dog is very affectionate to the owner. Moreover it is a good breed
Alsatian dog not like the stray dogs in the street. The stray dogs are
eating rubbish and they are dirty.

Your saying dogs should be kept out of daivika rituals may be  for
stray dogs only not for dogs with good owner and eating only good
food. They are clean and have regular bath and ,may be allowed to live
always with the owner. One time a Purohita came for a function and
told the dog should be tied outside. But the dog was barking and
making lot of noise outside. It was disturbing the function and
neighbours also. It is better to keep it inside because it is a clean
dog. It is not disturbing the Pooja inside.

Kindly let me know do the Madi rules allow clean dogs to be inside the house?

> Besides sanctity not associated with dogs,the main reason why dogs are not allowed when daivika/vaidika rituals are performed is that normally dogs eat "amedhya"which is prohibited in sastra.Otherwise,dogs are glorified that they are wirness to "yama",they are with Dattatreya,they are called "Bhairava',because of the barking 'Bhai,bhai'and "rava'means sound.If the "pinda'after the shraddha ritual accidentally eaten by a dog,the sastras say the performer has to go through the rituals of the shraddha,over again,after his ablutions.
