Namaste

I have a question My friend has a dog. When he is doing Pooja
sometimes the dog is sitting in front of Pooja room.
Is it allowed to do this? They say dogs are not allowed in Madi
matters. Can they hear Mantras?

I read somewhere if a cockroach, lizard or rat comes in Pooja room
there is no problem but dog should not come inside.
Dogs are not allowed. Why?
