Yesterday, to my second son, I was narrating the rAmAyana episode i.e. 
'lifting and bringing of sanjeevini parvata' by hanumAn to save the lives 
of lakshmaNa & other vAnara sena.  In all attentiveness he was listening 
to this story and at the end he asked me with all innocence (Kannada) 
'appa, hanumanta matte aa parvataana vaapas itnaa'  (has he kept that 
mountain back  in its original place after the purpose is served!!).  I 
could not answer him, somehow I avoided showing my ignorance and managed 
the situation.  Frankly I donot know the answer, is there any reference to 
this in vAlmeeki rAmAyaNa??  Pardon me for asking this 'baalisha' 
question.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
