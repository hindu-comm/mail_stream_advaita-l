namaste,

I presume this refers to the telugu script publications by Challa
Lakshminarasimha Shastry. A friend of mine purchased several of their
publications 2 years back, including two ~100 page booklets with selected
mantras and their vikritis. It is my understanding that this publisher is
well known in the Telugu smartha community, and the books are still in
print.

The same author published this book on the apastamba purva prayoga, which
is available online --
http://www.avkf.org/BookLink/display_author_books.php?author_id=1426

I will try and get the publisher's contact details.

sasneham,

   ajit
