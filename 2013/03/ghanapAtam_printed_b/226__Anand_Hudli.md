Speaking about the Rgveda ghanapATha, many rules for chanting are
mentioned in the prAtishAkhya. There are also other books on Veda
lakShaNa that are useful.

Many thanks for the kind clarification and suggestion.  Yes, I do have the
pattern of jata, ghana and danda pAtha  and tried to construct the ghanaM
for some yajurveda maNtra-s, like sadyO deekshayanti, mitrasya charshaNi
(sUryOpAsana maNtra), AyurdA agne etc. but failed due to lack of
availability of padapAtha and I believe svara-s also differs when chanting
in ghana pattern.   And as you rightly mentioned there are some intricate
rules involved while composing the ghanaM from saMhita, for example in
AyurdAagne ghanaM, after the first line of ghanaM AyurdAityAyuH - dA :,
and in gaNAnAntvA maNtra too gaNapati miti gaNa - patiM etc. will be
chanted, this will not go strictly as per ghana pattern.  Prabhuji kindly
let me know if there  is any specific rule for this type of chanting in
ghanaM ??

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
