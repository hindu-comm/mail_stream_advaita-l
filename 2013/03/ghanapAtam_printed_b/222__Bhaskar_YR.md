There are also some intricate rules involved in following the padapATha 
for
chanting the ghanapATha, which are best learned directly from a 
ghanapAThi,
not through books.

Many thanks for the kind clarification and suggestion.  Yes, I do have the 
pattern of jata, ghana and danda pAtha  and tried to construct the ghanaM 
for some yajurveda maNtra-s, like sadyO deekshayanti, mitrasya charshaNi 
(sUryOpAsana maNtra), AyurdA agne etc. but failed due to lack of 
availability of padapAtha and I believe svara-s also differs when chanting 
in ghana pattern.   And as you rightly mentioned there are some intricate 
rules involved while composing the ghanaM from saMhita, for example in 
AyurdAagne ghanaM, after the first line of ghanaM AyurdAityAyuH - dA :, 
and in gaNAnAntvA maNtra too gaNapati miti gaNa - patiM etc. will be 
chanted, this will not go strictly as per ghana pattern.  Prabhuji kindly 
let me know if there  is any specific rule for this type of chanting in 
ghanaM ?? 

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
