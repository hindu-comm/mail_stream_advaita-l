I'd like to know if there is any printed book available on ghanapAtaM of 
Rigveda or Yajurveda saMhitA maNtra-s in Kannada, Sanskrit or Telugu.  I 
have one Sanskrit book which contains only Yajurvedeeya AshirvAda 
ghanapAtam published by Sri Suresh & collection of some Rigveda & 
Yajurveda ghanapAtaM in Kannada published by purNa prajna, Bangalore.  I 
heard that in Telugu there is a good book available on ghanapAtaM 
published by 'Chellam' !!??  (not sure of the publisher name). 

Any help in this regard would be highly appreciated. 

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar

PS :  Sri Sivasenani Nuri prabhuji, Sri Sriram prabhuji I special request, 
 as you both have close contacts with Telugu speaking ghanapAti-s.
