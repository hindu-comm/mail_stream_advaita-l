Should be read as:

"Alaya, store-consciousness is the seed bed of
all that exists. Every seed lies in the store-consciousness and when it
sprouts out into objective world a reflection returns as a new seed . This
new seed lies latent in it and gets manifest when the seed becomes matured
under favourable conditions.
