Learned members of the group,

In the kalisataraNopaniShad, it is mentioned that the sixteen kala's of
Jiva are removed by the chanting of the Hare Rama Hare Rama Rama Rama Hare
Hare , Hare Krishna Hare Krishna Krishna Krishna Hare Hare. Can someone
shed some light of what those 16 kalas of Jiva are?

Thanks,

Raghavan
