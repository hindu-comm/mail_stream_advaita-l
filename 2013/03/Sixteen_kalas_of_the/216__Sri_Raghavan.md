Thank you for the immediate response.  I was also thinking that those would
have been the kalas. But Upanishad brahmendra in his bhasyam of the
KalisantaraNopaniShad has given this line -

pRANAdinAmantaShODashakalAbhiH AvRutasya jIvasya etatShoDashakaM nAma
jIvAvaraNavinAshakaM bhavati |

This means it has to contain pancha prANA's and ends with NamA.

So I am wondering if they would be pancha prANA's, pancha tanmAtras, manas,
budhi, ahaMkAra, chitta, sharIra, and nAmA?

While different permutations and combinations can be arrived at, I am
looking for some pramAnA for those 16 kalas which starts with pancha prANA
and ends with nAmA.

Thanks again,

Raghavan
