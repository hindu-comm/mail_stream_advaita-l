Maybe you meant to say 'gruel'.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gruel
//*Gruel* is a food preparation consisting of some type of
cereal<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cereal>—
oat <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oat>,
wheat<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheat>or
rye <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rye> flour, or rice — boiled in water or
milk <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milk>. It is a thinner version of
porridge <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porridge> that may be more often
drunk than eaten and may not need to be cooked.  From a literary,
bourgeois<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bourgeoisie>,
or modern <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_history> point of view,
gruel has often been associated with poverty. //

'Starch', also goes by the name 'kanji/ganji', could mean the excess water
drained/strained from the cooked rice.  Normally this starch is discarded
though in certain places the servants/beggars are fed this with
salt/onion/chilli added.
