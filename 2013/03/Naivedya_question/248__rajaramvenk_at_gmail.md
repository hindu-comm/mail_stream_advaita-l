Do such families exist? If so, where? What is their motivation for such serious adherence to vaidhika karma?

Subject: [Advaita-l] Naivedya question

Namaste,

//

I have electric stove. Can I use it? It is difficult to cook on charcoal stove.

Considering our busy official schedules, atleast something is better than nothing and this is the only option left now. So, you can go for it. 

Going by the strictest norms, one should have a *kumpaTi* for cooking naivEdya. The flame which is used for cooking should not be of blue in colour.The water should be from well only. The rajaswala strI should be put in outhouse and one should not look at her.LPG gas cylinders a strict NO NO. 

The above factors areextremely difficult but not impossible. But then, one shouldlead a different life style altogether committed towards vaidikakarmAnuSTAna followed by agnihOtra, veda adhyayana &adhyApana, swAdhyAya and tapas.Such dedicated families can be counted now who have completely sacrificed their lives for the sake of veda. 

regs,
sriram
