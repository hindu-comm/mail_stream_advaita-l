Namaste,


to generalize the question, "should we perform a nithya/naimitika/kamya karma) if we cannot do so as prescribed?"

My thoughts on this is we should try as much as possible to follow what is prescribed in the shastras and where ever wedeviate because ofdesAchAram and limitations, we do so with bhakti and humility in consultation with elders/Guru/Acharya who have the authority to interpret the shastras.

In the case of kAmya karmas we do have the option to not perform the ritual rather than perform it with mistakes

In the case of Nithya/naimittika karmas which we cannot avoid, we perform it with prAyaschittam for any omissions

for my panchAyatana pUja, I offer divyAnnam cooked on a gas stove

regards
vishwam

Maybe you meant to say 'gruel'.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gruel
//*Gruel* is a food preparation consisting of some type of
cereal<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cereal>—
oat <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oat>,
wheat<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheat>or
rye <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rye> flour, or rice — boiled in water or
milk <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milk>. It is a thinner version of
porridge <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porridge> that may be more often
drunk than eaten and may not need to be cooked. From a literary,
bourgeois<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bourgeoisie>,
or modern <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_history> point of view,
gruel has often been associated with poverty. //

'Starch', also goes by the name 'kanji/ganji', could mean the excess water
drained/strained from the cooked rice. Normally this starch is discarded
though in certain places the servants/beggars are fed this with
salt/onion/chilli added.
