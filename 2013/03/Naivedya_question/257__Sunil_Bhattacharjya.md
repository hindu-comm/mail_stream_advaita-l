Namaste,

What I wrote is as follows:

Quote
As regards the offering becoming ucchishta we have the story of 
Sabari offering fruits to Lord Ram,after tasting those herself. The 
shraddha and bhakti elements in the naivedya has the overwhelming 
presence in the naivedya.
Unquote

Probably I should have used the word "pre-tasted" rather than calling it Ucchista. The verses in Aranya kanda of Valmiki Ramayana,mentioning Sabari are as follows:

यत्र ते सुकृतात्मानॊ विहरन्ति महर्षयः
तत पुण्यं शबरीस्थानं जगामात्मसमाधिना

दिवं तु तस्यां यातायां शबर्यां सवेन कर्मणा
लक्ष्मणेन सह भरात्रा चिन्तयाम आस राघवः

In some other versions based on Purana the pre-tasting of the fruits have beem mentioned.

Regards,
Sunil KB
