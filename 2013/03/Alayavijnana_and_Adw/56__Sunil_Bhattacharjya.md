Lord Buddha's elightenment was at Bodhgaya and there is no dispute on that. It is not difficult to understand why Lord Buddha did not vomit out everything he understood, at Sarnath during his first promulgation. He wanted the people to follow first the basics needed for knowledge. That is why he refused to enter into any philosophical discussions immediately after the first promulgation. Later on he found disciples, who deserved higher knowledge, and accordingly he imparted that knowledge to them some 22 years after the first promulgation.

Not only you but there are many who do not know that Lord Buddha gave the second promulgation on the advanced (Mahayana) teachings at the Vulture-peak, some 22 years after giving the first promulgation on the basic (Hinayana) teachings at Sarnath. He gave the Tantri=c teachings at a still later date. This is also probably somewaht similar to what Adi Sankaracharya did . He composed the "Lalta Trishati Bhashya" towards the end of his life. 

That Lord Buddha learnt Yoga after completeing his learning of Samkhya is given in the book "Buddhacarita) by Ashvaghosha.

The enligte3nment of the Buddha ends with his enlightenment at Bodh Gaya.What is stated in the Buddhist scriptures is about his sermons.You say that he promulgated at Vulture peak.That he learnt "Yoga"is not stated.His teachings go only about Buddhism and not Yoga or Samkya.If you have evidence could you give about promulgation at Vulture peak as well as Yoga and Samkya as per "Budhacarita"?
