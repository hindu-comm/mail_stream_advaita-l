On the other hand, the Mahayana text Prjnaparamita, Diamond sutta and Hrdaya sutta indicate that the Bodhisattva attained Shunyata (got liberated) after leaving the five koshas. The word "Buddha" itself means "Jnani", if one has to trust the word of Lord Kapila, the avatara in which Lord Krishna taught Samkhya. The later-day Buddhist scholars only wanted logic to their rescue. Tarka cannot give liberation but Meditation can. This was known to Lord Buddha well.

Alaya vijnana is what travels from birth to birth to get new bodies till the bodiless state is reached ie. till one loses the five skandhas. To me the Alaya vijnana is not any different from the ancient concept of Atma. At the liberation the jeeva realises oneness of Jeevatma and Brahman. 

If the Buddhist scholars were not interested in any different terminologies they could have used the ancient Hindu terminologies. Lord Buddha did not want to found any new religion. The later day Buddhist scholars only made a new religion using Buddha's name.

Hindusism is based on Sruthi.The Vedanta is based on Upanishads and the smrthi.But,the Buddhism is based on Logic.Nirvana which means destruction of the five skandhas is defined only in Hinayana.It is like blowingout of a candle.In Mahayana Buddhists refrain from define what is Nirvana.It is not possible to say what continues after death,it is a mere hypothesis.
