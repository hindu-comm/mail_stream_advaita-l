This runs counter to what the Buddhists and the scriptures claim.If he 
learnt Yoga and samkya after that then his teachings were futile.

Lord Buddha's elightenment was at Bodhgaya and there is no dispute on that. It is not difficult to understand why Lord Buddha did not vomit out everything he understood, at Sarnath during his first promulgation. He wanted the people to follow first the basics needed for knowledge. That is why he refused to enter into any philosophical discussions immediately after the first promulgation. Later on he found disciples, who deserved higher knowledge, and accordingly he imparted that knowledge to them some 22 years after the first promulgation.

That means Buddha didnot get the complete enligtenment as the Buddhist sciptures claim.It is not mere undestanding,but enligtement as the scriptures claim.That means he waited patiently for the people to understand and digest what he was saying.This runs counter to what the Buddhists and the scriptures claim.If he learnt Yoga and samkya after that then his teachings were futile.
