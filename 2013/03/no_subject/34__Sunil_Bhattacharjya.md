Dear friends,

I am looking for the book "A critique of Madhva refutaion of Sankara school of Vedanta" by Dr. R. Narain, where the author criticizes the Dvaita-philosophy. I hope some learned member will be able to give some link for this book. 


The Dvaitins probably consider Madhusudana Saraswati (with his Advaita-siddhi) as one trying to be a saviour of Advaita and probably they also think of Dr. Narain the same way. Dr. Narain was initially a pro-Dvaita, but he changed his loyalty and wrote the above book. 


Regards,
Sunil KB
