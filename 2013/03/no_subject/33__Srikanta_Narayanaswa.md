"Alaya, store-consciousness is the seed bed of
all that exists. Every seed lies in the store-consciousness and when it
sprouts out into objective world. This new seed lies latent in it and gets
manifest when the seed becomes matured under favourable conditions.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
the above concept is not different from the "Pratitya samutpada theory"proposed by Nagarjuna.The seed and the sprout.The seed when it is placed in the earth cannot sprout without the aggregates of water,fertiliser,air and earth.When it sprouts we cannot say that the seed is the sprout because it cannot come without the aggregates.So,it is not possible to say the "svabhava".Hence he said "sarve nisvabhavah"as said by the Buddha(Gautama).It is not possible to establish the nature of the world.This is "pratityasamutpanna".The theory of conditional co-origination".This was put in different words by Vasubandhu and his disciples and the Buddhists who came after them.
