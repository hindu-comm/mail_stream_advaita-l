Turyatita is a 12 century construct, if I am not mistaken. 

praNAms 
Hare Krishna

In all probability you are right as you can hardly see any reference to 
turiyAteeta Atma in shankara's commentary.  tureeyatva has been explained 
as 'alakshNaM' and aprameyaM (for example 'etadapramayaM' in br.up.) I am 
just wondering what is that constitute in turiyAteeta to make it different 
from tureeya !!??

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
