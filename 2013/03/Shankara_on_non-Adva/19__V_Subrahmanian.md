The term 'Ishwara' takes different meanings in Sanskrit and Advaita.  For
instance in the first mantra of the Ishavasyopanishad, 'IshAvAsyam...' the
bhashyam takes the meaning of NirguNa Brahman which is none other than the
Atman.

We have the term 'kShetrajna-Ishwara aikyam' used by Shankara in the 13th
ch. BG where it is well known that there cannot be any aikyam between the
jiva and Ishwara (mAyOpaadhika).  What Shankara means here by the word is
only nirguNa brahman.

'Ishwaroham aham bhogI' of the AsurI sampat in 16th ch.BG means only a
wealthy, powerful, land lord.  He claims he is all this and enjoys his
status in society.  He is not claiming to be bhagavaan.

It is IshanashIla and not Ishwaranila (which was corrected long back).
Again, it is only the fundamental Lordship which is not Bhagavan as a
saguNa brahman.

Here Brahman is vivartopAdAna karaNam.  Just like a rope can appear as
snake, a garland, a creek, a stick and so on, Brahman appears as jiva/s,
Ishwara, world of objects, etc.

It is only with a view to posit an Ishwara the concept of mAyA is
admitted.  With mAyA it is possible for Brahman to be posited as Ishwara,
the wielder of mAyA.  This Ishwara can be called the abhinna nimittopAdAna
kAraNam while nirguNa brahman still remains the vivartopAdAna kAraNam.
This answers your next doubt.

nirupAdhika Brahman can be the fundamental adhishThAnam on which jiva,
ishwara, etc. appear.  That way nirupAdhika Brahman is IshanashIlaH.
nArAyaNa etymologically can mean the abode of all people...with different
upAdhis - both low and high.

Advaita happily uses the pot/external space analogy to convey the idea of
apparent division where no division is there in fact.  There is a fine
application of this analogy in the Gaudapada kArikA: 3rd ch..4,5,6,7..

'Ishwara' itself is a technical word that is used in relation to the
world.  If there is no relation to the world then there is no Ishwara.
Keep in mind the various meanings of this term that I have shown above. The
abode of creation, sustenance, dissolution, the antaryami...this Ishwara is
what is negated as not being the absolute turiya.

'nArAyaNa' has different meanings and depending on the particular
sannyasi's temperament/evolvement the smRti too varies.

AtmarAmas being devoted to VishNu is a case of 'pUjArtham kalpitam
dvaitam...' which we have discussed earlier.

Again, getting down to a serious study of the mAnDUkya is the best course
instead of asking the same questions in different words.
