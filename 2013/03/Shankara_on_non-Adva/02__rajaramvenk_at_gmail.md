Sri Devanathan used to say jokingly,"If an asura did tapasya, Indra will be worried that he will no longer be Indra. If a neo-vedantin did "tapasya", Ishwara Himself will be worried that he will no longer be Ishwara". 

There is difference in paths. We realise saguna brahman not in entirety but in a particular form in a particular loka according to the nature of upasana. So, you have to travel. However, He is in beyond spacio-temporal limitations and to know Him, as mayOpadhika brahman, you don't have to travel. He is our own antaryami. 

I have pointed out that definition of absolute in the seventh mantra of mandukya upanishad can be equally applied to Ishwara, in fact more so. That is why the differentiation between brahman and ishwara is artificial.

That is my argument to say that Brahman and Ishwara are not so different 
in Advaita.

Yes, you are right there is no separate celestial being called Ishwara 
that can have a separate existence apart from brahman.  So, in advaita 
aparabrahman is nothing but that parabrahman only but at the same time we 
have to keep in our mind that parabrahman is not aparabrahman. Like 'ring' 
can be said as gold but gold cannot be called as 'ring'.   It is because 
aparabrahman as such called due to its upAdhi sambandha (sOpAdhika) 
whereas parabrahman is nirupAdhika & niravayava.  I think in the sUtra 
bhAshya (4th adhyAya??) shankara clarifies the difference between 
realization of saguNa brahman and jneya parabrahman.  Here he clarifies 
saguNa brahman can be realized by going through devayAna whereas there is 
no going and reaching of parabrahman as it is the svarUpa, the inner self 
of all. 

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
