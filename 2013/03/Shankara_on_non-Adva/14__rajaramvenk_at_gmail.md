My understanding of eka jiva vada is as follows. There are two variations of it. In one eka jiva vada the prototype jiva is a reflection of brahman on avidya aspect of maya and in ishwara is a reflection of brahman on vidya aspect of maya. In the other version, Ishwara is mayopadhika brahman and the prototype jiva is a reflection of Ishwara on avidya. In both, the countless jivas are reflection of prototype  jiva on manas. On liberation, the mind is destroyed and along with it the reflected jiva merges in to the prototype jiva. It can still re-emerge at the will of ishwara as do jnanis in the shruti. Until all reflected jivas get liberated, the prototype jiva and ishwara remain.  Even if the prototype jiva loses its identity, Ishwara remains.

Namaste Sri Rajaram

Why to get confused with Ishvara? In Eka Jeeva Vada you are that
dreaming Jeeva. You are alone in the Universe. There are no other
Jeevas. All the people in the world are only your dream objects. You
are arguing with people here but they are parts of your dream only.
They are not real. Even I am writing this in your dream. Like that
even you have created someone called as Ishvara and you are
worshipping this dream Ishvara. When you worship this Ishvara if you
are happy it means your dream is good when you are worshipping.

 But you cannot guarantee your dream will always make you happy. If
and when your dream will end  by getting the dream Vedanta Jnana from
a dream Guru you will realize you are Brahman. At that stage there
will be no dream and no Ishvara also.
