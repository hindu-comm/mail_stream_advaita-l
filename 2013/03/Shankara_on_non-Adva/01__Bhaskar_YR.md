That is my argument to say that Brahman and Ishwara are not so different 
in Advaita.

Yes, you are right there is no separate celestial being called Ishwara 
that can have a separate existence apart from brahman.  So, in advaita 
aparabrahman is nothing but that parabrahman only but at the same time we 
have to keep in our mind that parabrahman is not aparabrahman. Like 'ring' 
can be said as gold but gold cannot be called as 'ring'.   It is because 
aparabrahman as such called due to its upAdhi sambandha (sOpAdhika) 
whereas parabrahman is nirupAdhika & niravayava.  I think in the sUtra 
bhAshya (4th adhyAya??) shankara clarifies the difference between 
realization of saguNa brahman and jneya parabrahman.  Here he clarifies 
saguNa brahman can be realized by going through devayAna whereas there is 
no going and reaching of parabrahman as it is the svarUpa, the inner self 
of all. 

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
