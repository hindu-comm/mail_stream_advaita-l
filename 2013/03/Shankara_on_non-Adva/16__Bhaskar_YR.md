The changeless Ishwara that Gaudapada talks about is beyond names and 
forms. 

praNAms
Hare Krishna

If you are calling same, nirguNa, niravayava, nirvishesha, nirvikAra, 
nirAmaya para brahman as Ishwara then we dont have any problem as this is 
another name given to that same tattva which is in reality nAma, rUpa & 
guNAteeta...But Ishwara in advaita works, contextually explained as 
'ruler' or lord of this universe and karmAdhyaksha which is kevala 
vyAvahArika satya where karma-dharma holds its own reality.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
