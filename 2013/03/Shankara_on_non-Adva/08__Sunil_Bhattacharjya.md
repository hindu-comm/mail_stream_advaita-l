By saying that all you want is evidence from bhasyam to show that Ishwara is to be given up, you are cleverly demanding a statement to pell out a distinction between Brahman and Ishvara. I think that is not proper. What we can say at most is that if Ishvara is the state of Turiya, Brahman is "Ttiuriyatita", i.e., no state like Turiya can be attributed to Brahman.

Auspiciousness is an attribute too. May be we can say "beyond attributes"

RV: My question to Sri Subrahmanian is why would the upanishad want tospecify an attribute (auspiciousness) to negate attributes. IfI say "Your are intelligent", it means you are.If someone says, "You are intelligent means that you are not intelligent, not that you are stupid but definitely you are not intelligent", then others will question such an interpretation. 

Also, Gaudpada defines Turiya as the changeless ruler capable of destroying all miseries. 

10 Turiya,the changeless Ruler, is capable of destroying all miseries. All 
other entities being unreal, the non—dual Turiya alone is known as effulgent and 
all—pervading. 

Regarding adhyaropa - apavada, Ishwara is the cause only through the instrumentality of maya. it is possible to negate cause (maya) and its effect (jagat) but how will you negate Him who is beyond cause and effect? When the pot (maya) is destroyed, there is no pot space (jiva) or great space distinct from the pot (ishwara) but how can you say that there is no great space (ishwara or brahman)? The subtle difference is that Ishwara is indestructible. All I am asking for is evidence from bhasyam to show that Ishwara is to be given up.
