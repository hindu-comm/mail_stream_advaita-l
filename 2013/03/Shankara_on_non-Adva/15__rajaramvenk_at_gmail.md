The changeless Ishwara that Gaudapada talks about is beyond names and forms. He assumes particular names and forms for upasana. I never said that Ishwara considered distinct from jiva is turiya.

All I am asking for is evidence from bhasyam to show that
Ishwara is to be given up.

Hare Krishna

As far as I know, advaita vedAnta does not ask anyone to give-up Ishwara. 
Ishwara or sOpAdhika or kArya brahma is meant for archana, dhyAna & 
upAsana for the adhyAtmic sAdhaka-s.  But Ishwara (sOpAdhika) 
nevertheless, a reality of vyAvarArika which is avidyAkruta as per 
advaita's ultimate 'nirvishesha' brahma siddhAnta.  If you are looking for 
the bhAshya reference for this, you can refer sUtra bhAshya in 
ArambhaNAdhikaraNaM, where shankara clearly says brahman conditioned by 
name and form set up by avidyA becomes Ishwara, just as universal ether 
limited as it were by jars, pots etc. I think the originals have been 
quoted earlier several times in this very list.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
