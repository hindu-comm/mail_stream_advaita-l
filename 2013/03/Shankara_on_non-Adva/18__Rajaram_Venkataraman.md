RV: Why is Turiya specifically called Ishana here by Gaudapada? Ishwara has
been dealt with in sixth mantra. Here his state as changeless ruler is
highlighted. If there is any other reason, what is that?

RV: There are many problems in your statement. If Brahman is the cause,
then it has to be negated. Also, the question arises as to what type of
cause is Brahman as it cannot be either material or intelligent cause? The
third problem is who wields the instrument of maya? If it is Ishwara, then
He is the cause not Brahman. Brahman cannot be the wielder of the
instrument because He is actionless. This problem is solved when you accept
that Brahman and Ishwara are one.

RV:  If you say Ishwara is different from Brahman and is the cause of the
universe, then you have to either say that there are two causes for the
universe viz. Brahman and Ishwara or that your previous statement  "
Brahman (not Ishwara) is the cause only through the instrumentality of
mAyA" is wrong. Is it not?

RV: The above is true only in dualistic devotion where the pot-space and
external-space are seen as two entities not in the non-dualistic devotion
where it is seen as one space, the third stage of devotion.

A significant bhAShya sentence in this regard is:
