Jaldharji - PraNAms
Just to keep the record straight again, it was not Swami Paramarthanandaji statement. He never talked about JK. The statement is only from my side. I have used the class notes as a basis and what I wrote in detail is more of my understanding. I have to give credit to Swamiji forproviding methe knowledge.I may writelatera detailedanalysis ofJK's talks based again on my understanding without going into details of his personal outlook. 
Hari Om!
Sadananda
