Sri JK spoke from the depths of self-realization

//

JK, no doubt, a great philosopher, was an enigmatic personality and continues to be an enigma. Whether, he is self-realized or not, isa different ball game altogether, because the state of jivanmukti has been well-described by our traditional scholars. 

What amazes me is his *romantic relationship* with Rosalind, inspite of his *jIvanmukta sthiti*. Probably, this is also one of the aspects of jnAni's charya :))

BTW, JK and Sri Lakshman Joo, a famous scholar of kashmir trika siddhanta, both met each other in a railway station for about half-an-hour. It seems, JK was impressed with personality of Lakshman Joo. Has any account been recorded anywhere about their discussions? Interested to know.
