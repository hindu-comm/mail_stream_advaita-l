If anything Swami Paramarthananda was being too kind.  In so far as I have 
been able to penetrate his brand of gibberish I gather Krishnamurti was an 
agnostic.  For him there can be no "purification of the mind" because 
there is no mind or objective truth.  It's all a lot of fine-sounding 
navel gazing which doesn't even rise up to the level of the solipsism 
which was recently discussed let alone Vedanta.
