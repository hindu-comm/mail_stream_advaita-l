He does not assume any abiding self so how can there be self-realization?

This why a guru is supposed to be both shrotriya and brahmanishta.  A 
person who lacks either of these qualities has no business teaching 
"self-realization."  Having a good PR department is not a substitute.  I 
see no reason to patiently wait for gibberish to turn to clarity when 
there are plenty of better alternatives.

Now it is true that e.g. the avadhuta marga for instance deliberately 
embraces irrationality but the avadhutas live by themselves in the forest. 
They do not presume to teach the general public.

No he was an awful philosopher by the standards of either East or West. 
Advaitins for all their acknowledgement of the treachery of language 
consider tarka and vyakarana -- rigor in thought and speech as the 
foundations of any serious sadhana.

When one insists on pounding square pegs into round holes it is not 
surprising one ends up in enigma.

Or a simpler explanation he was a garden-variety bhogi who used religion 
as his means of seduction.  It wouldn't be the first time such things have 
happened.
