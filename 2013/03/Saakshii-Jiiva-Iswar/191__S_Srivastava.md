Sir: Sri JK spoke from the depths of self-realization. Lack of appropriate
vocabulary may have constrained his expression but if you stay patiently
with him you will see that he is not talking gibberish.

On a different note you may find many vedAnta teachers also who are unable
to express the vision coherently and it is not due to lack of an
appropriate vocabulary.

One has to be truly blessed to come across a teacher who is self -realized
and also able to convey it clearly.
