Namaste,

Here is one clarification on shUnyavAda of the mAdhyamikas:

"Unfortunately the word ‘Shūnya’ has been
gravely misunderstood. The literal meaning of
the word which is negation or void has been
the cause of much misunderstanding. The
word is used by the Mādhyamikas in a different philosophical sense.
Ignoring the real
philosophical meaning of the word ‘Shūnya’
and taking it only in its literal sense, many
thinkers, eastern and western, ancient, medieval and modern have
unfortunately committed that horrible blunder which has led them
to thoroughly misunderstand Shūnyavada and
to condemn it as a hopeless scepticism and a
self-condemned nihilism. Shūnya, according
to the Mādhyamika, we emphatically maintain, does not mean a ‘nothing’ or
an ‘empty
void’ or a ‘negative abyss’. Shūnya essentially
means Indescribable (avāchya or anabhilāpya)
as it is beyond the four categories of intellect
(chatuṣkoṭi-vinirmukta). It is Reality which ultimately transcends
existence, non-existence,
both and neither. It is neither affirmation nor
negation nor both nor neither."
