On the other hand, the Mahayana text Prjnaparamita, Diamond sutta and Hrdaya sutta indicate that the Bodhisattva attained Shunyata (got liberated) after leaving the five koshas. The word "Buddha" itself means "Jnani", if one has to trust the word of Lord Kapila, the avatara in which Lord Krishna taught Samkhya. The later-day Buddhist scholars only wanted logic to their rescue. Tarka cannot give liberation but Meditation can. This was known to Lord Buddha well.

We donot know about Meditation in Buddhism.It is the story we read in Buddhist scriptures about the levels of Dhyana which Buddha reached before attaining Buddha state.We also donot know about the details of Buddha only that he went to Saranath to preach his sermon.All have become poetic descriptions.
