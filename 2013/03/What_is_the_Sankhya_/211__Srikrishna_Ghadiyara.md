Om!

I read the following sentence in the book, 'Popular Essays in Indian Philosophy' bu Prof. M. Hiriyanna. 
"But even in Pralaya, we must remember, Prakriti does not cease to to be dynamic; only its component parts, the gunas, constantly reproduce themselves then, instead of acting on one another and giving rise to a heterogeneous transformation."

What does this mean? What is this constant reproduction of gunas within themselves? What is the explanation in the Sakta terminology or Vedanta? What does Brahma Sutra comment about this saamyavastha?

Om!

Srikrishna
