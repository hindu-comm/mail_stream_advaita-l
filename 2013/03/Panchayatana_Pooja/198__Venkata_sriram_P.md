Namaste,

Prof. V.Krishnamurthy Ji compiled the shiva panchayatana puja vidhi which is a very 
prAmANika paddhati that has been handed down by his father who is a great advaita
shAstra paNDita hailing from the parampara of Upanishad Brahmendra Saraswati.

Here is the link:

But, the basic necessity is to learn atleast puruSa sUkta. 

If one doesn't know puruSa sUkta, then the entire panchAyAtana can be performed 
with *praNava followed by vyAhriti-traya* ie., *Om bhUrbhuvaHsuvaH*.

regs,
sriram
