Namaste,

The site pradosham.com has a compilation in sanskrit and tamil called pradosha vidhi wich has the pancAyatna pUja vidhi
http://pradosham.com/home.php

R.S Vadhiyar has a publication called Nityanhikam which also contains the vidhi

Sringeri math also has a publication which has the vidhi

Usually the samputam is obtained with the blessings of the elders in the family or priest.

regards
Vishwam

Namaste,

Prof. V.Krishnamurthy Ji compiled the shiva panchayatana puja vidhi which is a very 
prAmANika paddhati that has been handed down by his father who is a great advaita
shAstra paNDita hailing from the parampara of Upanishad Brahmendra Saraswati.

Here is the link:

But, the basic necessity is to learn atleast puruSa sUkta. 

If one doesn't know puruSa sUkta, then the entire panchAyAtana can be performed 
with *praNava followed by vyAhriti-traya* ie., *Om bhUrbhuvaHsuvaH*.

regs,
sriram
