Shree Ranga Rathnam - PraNAms. Thanks for your comments. 
Here is my understanding.  
As per tarka sangraha of Annambhatta-( See - A primer of Indian Logic, by Prof. Kuppuswami Sastri)  they have 9 fundamental substances - and space is one of them. Sound is its quality and is considered as all-pervading and eternal. Paricchinnatvam or division (into atomic size) or movement are not compatible with the all-pervasiveness and eternity of space. Hence for tarkikaas also, space is indivisible and all pervasive. Since it is subtler than other substances such as pRithivi, vAyu, Fire and water which can be subdivided into their finest particles- paramaanus, space can pervade them without out inhereing in them or not having any relationship with them. 
The point Nischaladaasa and also Goudapaada makes is potspace or ear-space, appear to be conditioned for transactions while space as such is unconditionable and indivisible. Consciousness is subtler than space.  
Just returned to States and will continue with the series. 
Hari Om!
Sadananda
