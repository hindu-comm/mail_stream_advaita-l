The sad truth is that for too many boys, the Veda is "finished" the day of 
their upanayana.  Hence my comment.

But 48 years on the other hand?  I doubt if that was ever a realistic 
option.  The snataka would be in his 50's before he was able to become a 
grhastha.  Or perhaps this is the origin of the concept of a naishthika 
brahmachari?
