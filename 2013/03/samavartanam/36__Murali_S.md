Learned list members,
What was the significance of samavartanam in Vedic education? Was it
some sort of 'graduation' ceremony wherein the student was certified
to have acquired Vedic education of some standard? Somwehat akin to a
graduation ceremony with a degree certificate.

Please enlighten me.Thanks in Advance.
