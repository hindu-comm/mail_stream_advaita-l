Namaste,
I am interested in doing panchayatana puja & I have learnt devatarchana too.
I am unable to procure the panchayatana shilas (viz bana linga, shaligrama etc)
I have heard that such things should not be traded too.
Hence I would like the learned members to throw some light on how to get the panchayatana shilas?

Thanks
Abhinand
