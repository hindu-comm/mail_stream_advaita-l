Namaste,

Here are some thoughts on "time" in vedAnta - I realize 
that not everyone will agree with the description below.
However, just in case some people find it useful, I am
sharing these thoughts:

1. Broadly speaking there are three entities here:
 a. nirguNa brahma - the absolute reality.
 b. saguNa vishva - the world as is projected to us.
 c. Adi mAyA - the power which projects the saguNa vishva
 out of nirguNa brahma.

2. Everything in the saguNa vishva is a projection of something
 in nirguNa brahma.

3.So "time" in saguNa vishva must also be a projection of"something"
 in nirguNa brahma.Let us call this "something" - "Time".

4. "Time" is absolute, while "time" is relative.

5. The concept of "before" and "after", based on my understanding, is
 an absolute concept, and hence belongs to the domain of "Time".

6. The relative concepts like "decay", "ageing", ... belong to the
 domain of "time".

7. Lastly, a conjecture: "Time" is the one that is associated with 
 the collapse of a wavefunction in Quantum mechanics, while, "time"
 is the one that follows the rules of Relativity. That is, unification
 of relativity and quantum theory is potentially possible in this
 vedanta inspired framework. If someone is interested in taking this
 forward - Best Wishes from my side. (I do not see myself able to
 devote any timeto this for a very long time.)

Regards,
Shrinivas
