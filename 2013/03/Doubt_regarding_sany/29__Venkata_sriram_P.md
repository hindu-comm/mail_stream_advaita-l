Namaste,

Let he be informed that he is neither a good grihastha nor a good sanyAsi. 

Sorry for my harsh tone here.

A grihastha should hand over his wife in the hands of his eldest son for proper care 
and supervision and then take sanyAsa. 

That said, a kuTichaka sanyAsi, havingundergone the prescribed rituals of sanyAsa
can stay with his relatives (wife & sons). However, again, there are certain vidhi & 
nishedha that needs to be followed. daNDa grahaNa should be there followed by
upAsana, dEvapUja and praNava anuSTAna. Wife can offer the bhikSa. kSaura niyamAs, brahmacharya dIkSa, upavAsaetc. are the vidhis for him again. 

Shri Bharati Tirtha Mahaswamigal during the current vijaya yAtra lamented while mentioning such sanyAsis and muttadhipatis who are lacking bAhya & antaH shaucha niyamAs and anuSTAna.

regs,
sriram
