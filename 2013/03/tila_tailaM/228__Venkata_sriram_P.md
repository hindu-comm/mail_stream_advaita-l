Namaste,

I don't know the adhyAtmic reason behind that but as per the recommendation of
Ayurveda, the tila removes kapha & pitta doshas, charma-vAta-doshas, bala-vriddhi (vitality and vigour) and increases the apetite (jIrNa shakti). 

All those items that are used in abhisheka have medicinal properties that are mentioned
in Ayurveda. My acharya told me that there is a commentary on the usage of abhisheka
items called *bhAva-prakAsika* which mentions the medicinal properties. 

I don't have that book. 

regs,
sriram
