Namaste Sri Bhaskar

The Upanisad has said Neha Nana Asti Kinchana. There cannot be many
Jeevas but only one. That one Jeeva is me. There is no use for
accepting Nana Jeevas are existing in the Universe. The Samashti and
Vyashti Upadhis may be there for explaining and arguing with dull
opponent schools.

For Advaitis it is not necessary to say all 7 billion people in the
world are so many Jeevas existing with me. These 7 billion people are
there only because I am dreaming of them. They are parts of my dream.
This is the direct straightforward approach.

I said earlier also there is no Ishvara, Hiranyagarbha and others
separate from my dream. They are also existing because I am dreaming
about them.

But I cannot say I am the only dreamer so I will do what I want. I
will not  care for any rules. Because Dharma and Moksha Shastra is
also in my dream. I have to obey that if I want the dream to be nice.
Otherwise my dream will become bad. I don;t want to suffer in the
dream. I want to have a nice dream. For this I have to follow the
dream Dharma Shastra.

But if I follow only Dharma Shastra I will have a good dream but I
will not wake up and realize Reality. To wake up I have to study the
dream Moksha Shastra. But first I must do Sadhana Chatushtaya. Then I
can study Vedanta. But I have to study it with another so called
Jeeva. This is the Guru. I am dreaming this Guru also.

You have said we cannot do Sadhana if we follow Eka Jeeva Vada. But
above I have given reasons for doing Sadhana. If you do Sadhana of
Dharma the dream will be good It will not make you to suffer in it.
But it will not wake you up. For that you have to do Sadhana of Moksha
Shastra.

Both Dharma Marga and Moksha Marga are available in your dream. Athato
Dharma Jijnasa and Athato Brahma Jijnasa are in your dream. Both
Sadhanas can be done.
