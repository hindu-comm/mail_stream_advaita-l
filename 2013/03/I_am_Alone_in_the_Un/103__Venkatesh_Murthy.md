Vedanta is telling us this Universe is a big dream I have created. I
am saying what Vedanta is saying and we have to think like this. I am
not forcing to think like this.

This thinking is good because it will help to remove confusion in the mind.

In the big dream I have created I have two choices. Let the dream
continue or make it end.

What will happen if it will continue? Then I want dream to be good. It
should not make me unhappy. Why I should suffer in my dream? I don't
like it.
If you ask anybody when he is sleeping will he like to have bad dream
or good dream? Invariably he will say good dream only.
Then I have to follow Dharma Marga. If I don't follow the dream Dharma
books are telling me I will suffer in my dream. Following the dream
Dharma
I can enjoy the nice things in the dream. I will be happy.

But the dream Vedanta books are telling me I can continue the dream
and keep it good.  If I want to end it I have to realize the Brahma.
This Brahma is me only.
To realize Brahma I have to go to the dream Guru and get his
instructions. Then I will realize Brahma and dream will end.

It will not help thinking  I am Brahma now. Why should I go to dream
Guru? If you are Brahma now why you are still dreaming? Why is the
dream not ending?

Unluckily we cannot simply say we know it is a dream. Now we have
realized. The LITMUS test is this one. If you see everything as a
dream why you are still dreaming.
A person is sleeping at night and dreaming. At that time he gets a
feeling this is a dream. Then he will wake up. You cannot continue in
the dream if you know it is a dream.
It is not possible to dream like this.

Yes.

Again LITMUS test. If you are complete why you are still dreaming? You
cannot say I know it is a dream and I am dreaming. Both cannot be
true. If you know it is a dream you must be AWAKE. There will be no
more dream.

Like following Dharma also we have to worship the dream God. The dream
God can also help us like the dream Guru. He can give good things to
make dream happy or he can do Marga Darshana.

If you are realizing this very truly there will not be a dream. You
will be awake. Are you awake?

Kindly see above. If you are enjoying Moksha now you will not be
seeing any dream. Both cannot happen.

Again Litmus test. If you are Brahman you will not see the dream. Why
you are still dreaming?

Brahman will not make any statement. Because Brahman cannot say
anything. There is nothing to say.
