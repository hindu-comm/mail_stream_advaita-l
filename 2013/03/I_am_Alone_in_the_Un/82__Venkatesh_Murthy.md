Namaste

The answer is simple. You are in my dream. You are only a dream
object. Only I can wake up. You cannot wake up because your are not a
Jeeva. Only Jeeva is me.
You can say the same thing to me. But I know you are saying that in MY
DREAM. I will not take it seriously.

I have faith in my dream Guru. He will say I can wake up. I have faith
in the dream Moksha Shastra like Vedanta. It is telling me in my dream
I can wake up. That is sufficient for me.
