Namaste,

Dreaming is okay but it has to be in the night or else it will be day-dreaming. So also the dreaming that the world and everything is dream has to be in the time when one is preparing to sleep, i.e., when one has taken Sanyasha. Hope you will agree.

Regards,
Sunil KB

Namaste

The Jeevanmukta is also in MY DREAM only. If he gets Moksha his Moksha
is in MY DREAM also. It is not real. When he gets so called Moksha my
dream is still the same. I can learn a good lesson from it. But good
things can be dream objects like Guru, Vedanta and others.

If I wake up the whole MY DREAM will end. My dream = Universe and
everything in it. Then there is no 'You' no Universe no Jeevan Mukta
no dreamer.
