How ? The whole Universe is my dream. I may or may not get Liberation.
If I get Liberation this Universe will end. The dream will end. How
you can guarantee I am not getting Liberation?

The deep sleep will not end the Universe because I can return to dream
from it. When I sleep every night I get dreams and deep sleep also. I
am moving from dreams to deep sleep and again from deep sleep to
dream. When I wake up in the morning it is one more dream. There is no
difference between dreaming in the night and dreaming in the day when
awake. I create the dream objects in the night dream. In the waking
day time again I am creating the Universe with all the people and
objects. The whole Universe is my dream Creation. There is no
difference at all between night dream and waking dream.  I have
created the Avastha Traya.

Even you are my Creation. All the list members are Created by me only.
All th e people are my Creation only. They cannot exist outside me.
