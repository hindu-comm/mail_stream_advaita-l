Namaste Sri Sadananda

Earlier itself I said in the Eka Jiva Vada the Jeeva thinks I am Alone
in the Universe. If I say Jeeva it is before Realization of I am
Brahman. The Brahman cannot say I am Alone in Universe because there
is no Universe. We have to talk about Jeeva only.

But Jeeva is saying I am Alone in Universe because all these people I
am seeing and things and the Universe I am seeing itself is my dream.
There is no proof for these people being actually real. They are not
Jeevas like me. They look like me they talk like me they behave like
me but they are dream objects. My parents and wife and children are
dream objects. The Jeeva is seeing the dream. But he does not know how
to get out of the dream. Why he has to get out?

Because the dream is not always making him happy. Sometimes he is
happy. Sometimes he is unhappy. If the dream is always good he can say
let it continue. But it makes him sad sometimes. He wants the dream to
end. Then he can be happy always. He can be Brahman. But now he is
only Jeeva. How to end the dream? The answer is in the dream only. He
has to go to a Guru in the dream and get instructions from him. The
Guru is also a dream object. The Vedanta he is teaching is a dream
object only. The dream Guru will teach from the dream Vedanta. Jeeva
has to study the dream books of Advaita. Then he will get realization
I am Brahman and the dream will be over.

This is the most beautiful and most simple Advaita Tattva. I don't
know why it is not taught but other very very complicated things are
taught. They are very confusing.

Only when the BMI drops nothing further can be said or need to be said.
