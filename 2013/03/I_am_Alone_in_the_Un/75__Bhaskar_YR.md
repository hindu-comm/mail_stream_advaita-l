It is correct that there is no proof for "these" people being actually
real. However there is no proof either for this particular body and mind 
to
be actually real. In dream I have a different body and a different mind. 
In
deep sleep I have neither any body nor any mind.

That is well said prabhuji, that is the reason why shruti says tasya traya 
avasathA trayee svapnAH..But to realize the dream nature of these three 
avasthA we have to first realize that 'ekatva', till that time it is 
futile to address this jagat & other jeeva-s as dream, coz. calling this 
jagat will be only on lips and not a siddhAnta backed by 'svAnubhava' :-))

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
