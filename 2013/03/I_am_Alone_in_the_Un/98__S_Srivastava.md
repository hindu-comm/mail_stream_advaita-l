Sir: That implication is only a belief.

When I say that "I experience an object", all I experience is an
object-like appearance in my awareness.

To claim that there is actually an outside object which is causing that
particular experience in an unverifiable belief. No one can ever go out
side the experience to verify the existence of such an object.

All I know -and will ever be able to know - is the object-like appearance
in my awareness, which is nothing but a modulation in awareness. In other
words, all the time I am experiencing only myself.

Experience of an object does not imply its existence. It simply implies
that there is an object -like appearance in awareness. Nothing more.
Nothing less. Belief in the existence of objects is an unnecessary
assumption. I awareness is all there is.
