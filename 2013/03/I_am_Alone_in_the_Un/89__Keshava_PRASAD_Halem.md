My dear Friends:

IMHO:

I like to draw your attention to the old "Akbar Birbal Story" wherein Birbal shows Akbar the multitude reflections of the one sun, one in each of the pots of water.
Each reflection/manifestation(?) is no doubt dependent-on/characterized-by/distinguished-by its associated upAdhi (water-in-a-pot) and may even seem to be quite/entirely different from all the rest/others.
Eka/anEka jeeva model(s) seem to be almost/quite similar to this scenario - based on one's 'identification' - characterized/distinguished by upAdhi.

All distinctions arise out of the attributes of upAdhi - upAdhibhEdaat - right?

After all, every analogy has its limitation; analogy itself is not the object(subject?) being analogized, right?
So, even the dream-(avasthaatraya)-analogy cannot be pushed too far - any analogy when pushed too far it shows such 'cracks/holes' (they say it cannot/doesn't hold water) in such arguments/reasoning.
Analogies are used only as pointers/arrows to help us to go far far beyond the tip of those pointers/arrows - all the way to reach the object(subject?) being pointed at - like pointing fingers to show the sun, moon & the stars.

Sorry if i have interrupted the overall thought process(es) among the members.
[i do not read/study all these threads that carefully, and so might have missed some critical issues/points being focused upon.]

Yours Truly,
Keshava Prasad Halemane
