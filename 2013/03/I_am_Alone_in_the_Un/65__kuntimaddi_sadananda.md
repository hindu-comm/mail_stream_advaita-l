Shree Venkatesh - Interestingly this topic was the discussion as part of puurvapaksha in the Vichaarasa saagara of Nischaladaasa that Swami Paramarthanandaji is currently doing at Astika samaaja. It just so happend that I attended these classes during my short visit here. I am preparing the notes and hopefully this question will be addressed. In essence the question raised was is Saakshii is single or plural. Puurvapakshi claims that saakshii if it all exists is plural and therefore identity as interpreted by advaita for mahaavaakya is wrong. More when I prepare the notes. 
Hari Om!
Sadananda
