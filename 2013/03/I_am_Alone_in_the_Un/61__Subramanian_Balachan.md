Dear All,

NamasthE,

The conception of Eka Jeeva is as follows:

The NirguNa ParaBrahman in the dimensionless state has created this
Universe with hundreds of dimensions, out of ITself, . Hence there is
nothing in this Universe other than the Brahman ITself.

As Maandukya Upanishadh says Eka Aathma Prathyaya Saaram - There is only
one Aathman - Brahman in this Universe and IT has created this Universe
with trillions of entities out of ITself.

But this can not be put to everybody,. An ordinary entity will invariably
see all the other entities as different from itself.
Only the REALIZED persons know that every Aathman is Brahman and hence
there is nothing but the Brahman in this Universe. So this Universe with
trillions of stars and galaxies itself is an apparition. So we are all in
the dream state of the Brahman and when we wake up, we realize that "I the
Brahman am alone".

Best Regards,

B.Subramanian.
