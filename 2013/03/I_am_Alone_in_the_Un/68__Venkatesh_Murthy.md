Namaste

I thank you for showing difference between Advaita and Solipsism.  In
Solipsism the Mind Body is real for me. But in Advaita even this Body
and Mind
are Mithya only. I have one response for your point below.

I awareness cannot do anything. It is Brahman. The Upanishad is saying
Aham Brahmasmi. It does not require any Guru's teaching. But the dream
I requires Guru's teaching. The dream I must have Mumukshutva 'I am
stuck in this dream but I do not know how to end this dream. I have to
go to the dream Guru to end the dream. The dream Guru will be like a
dream tiger. The dream tiger can make the dream terminate ' . Then in
the dream I can take the Guru seriously.

If I think I can be in this dream and no need to end the dream it will
continue for ever. But why should I end this dream ? Because the dream
is not always making me happy. If I have only good dream let it
continue for ever. But I cannot control my dream. Sometimes it becomes
a bad dream and makes me unhappy. I must end this dream to make me
happy always.

I am Alone in the Universe. All the people, family, friends are all in
my dream only. They are not real.
