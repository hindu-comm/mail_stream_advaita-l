Namaste

.'Seeing through the illusory nature of dream "I" is the end of suffering.'

But how to see through the dream I ? It is like understanding it is a
dream in the dream itself. It is difficult. When you wake up from a
bad dream you can say it was only a dream. But when you are in that
dream how can you say that ?

A dream Guru has to tell me I am in a dream. Then I will wake up.
