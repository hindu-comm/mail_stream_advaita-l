Namaste

Some Advaitis have accepted the Eka Jeeva Vada. This is saying I am
Alone in the Universe. The people in the world are only in my dream
not real. They are not different Jeevas but my dream creations. God is
also my dream creation. Even they say if a Guru comes and gives
instructions he is also in my dream only. He is teaching me in my
dream. But question is how can anyone take the Guru seriously if he is
only a dream creation? How can there be liberation without taking Guru
seriously?

In Wikipedia

 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solipsism#Advaita_Vedanta

They have said Advaita is different from this Solipsism. How is the
Eka Jeeva Vada different from Solipsism?

Some say there is proof for I am Alone in the Universe. They are
searching for earth like planet with life but they have not found it.
We are alone in the Universe. Like this in the world also I am alone.
