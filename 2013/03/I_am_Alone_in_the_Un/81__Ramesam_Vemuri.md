"These 7 billion people are there only because I am dreaming of them. They
are parts of my dream.
This is the direct straightforward approach."


Am I in your dream or Are you in my dream?

Even if you say that "I" and "you" are one and the same, which version
wakes up  first?

Say that "you" version wakes up, does that end the dream for the "I"
version?
