In the aparokShAnubhUti we have a fine verse:

सर्वोऽपि व्यवहारस्तु ब्रह्मणा क्रियते जनैः ।
अज्ञान्न विजानन्ति मृदेव हि घटादिकम् ॥ ६५

Whatever is done by everyone is always 'with' Brahman.  In other words, the
Only One Existent 'vastu' Brahman alone is the doer, the doing, the done
upon. All clay-products are nothing but clay.  All brahma-vikAra is none
other than Brahman.  Brahman alone appears as all. The pramAtR, the
pramANam and the prameyam are all only Brahman projected as the three-fold.
