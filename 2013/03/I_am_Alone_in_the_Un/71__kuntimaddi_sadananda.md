PraNams
When I recognize that I am alone - there is no question of - in this universe. Nay - there is no question of making any statements of the type.
What actually is - I am - is the only absolute realty and everything including this universe as well as the other beings are mithyaa - since perception of plurality will still takes place as long as BMI is there - but notion of reality to the perceived plurality drops down - it is recognized that jagat is mithyaa. Only when the BMI drops nothing further can be said or need to be said. 
Hari Om!
Sadananda
