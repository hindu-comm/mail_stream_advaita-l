Very nicely said, Sadaji.  The existence of anything that is an object in
the world is dependent, paratantra, on the Existence that is Brahman, the
swatantra, the sattAprada, for the objects which is also the
seer-consciousness. For, without the seer consciousness no seeing
experience is possible; hence the depender and depended-upon relationship.
So, all those non-advaitic systems that say the world is paratantra satya /
shesha - sheshi bhava are only admitting that the world has no existence of
its own but has only a borrowed existence from Brahman.  The satyatva they
attribute to the world is really no absolute satyatva, but only vyavaharika
or qualified satyatva/existence. The only analogy for such a phenomenon is
the rajju-sarpa, shukti-rajata types or, by extension, the dream example.
No one can succeed in giving an apt analogy for the paratantra satyatvam
other than the above stated analogies.

Yes. That is the reason Eka jiva prakriyA is admitted as the preeminent one
in Vedanta.  The siddhAntaleshasangraha, the vedantasiddhAntamuktavaLi, the
Mandukya kArikA and bhAShya, the kaivalyopanishat and the sUtasamhitA that
comments on it are valuable sources for the study of Ekajiva vAda
prakriyA.  A fine account of this prakriyA is given in the English book:
sridakshinAmurtistotram Vol.I in pages 217 to 268 with copious
notes/citations from the aforesaid vedantic works.
