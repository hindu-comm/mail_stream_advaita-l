"..... everything is dream  has to be in the time when one is preparing to
sleep, i.e., when one has taken Sanyasha."

i hope that the above statement is not made in all seriousness, Sir.

We are, perhaps, considering here 'dream' in a more generic sense.
(Philosophically, anyway, daydreaming and night dreaming (and even the
world) are  the same).

More than that the thought that all this philosophy (Advaita) is only for
the one going to sleep (or in sanyasa) is not that correct -- though some
people do insist on the fourfold ashramas, as you know. Dr. Sadananda
repeatedly points this fact that the renunciation has to be with respect to
all sorts of 'desire.'  We do have examples of regular householders,
rulers, tradesmen, housewives and so on who are non-renunciates but
Jivanmuktas.

And thanks to Shri Anand Hudli for the kind intervention.  But doesn't the
argument look a bit circular?

regards,
