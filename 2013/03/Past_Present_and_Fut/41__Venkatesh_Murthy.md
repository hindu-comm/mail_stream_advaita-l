Namaste

Is there analysis of Time factor in Advaita?

I read somewhere but I cannot remember. The Past is dead. It is Maya.
The future we do not know. The Future is also Maya. The Present only
is real.

Is there something like this in Advaita books? Kindly give references.

But if Present is the real thing it also gets converted to Past in the
next moment. How can you say Present is real? A real thing cannot
become Maya.
The Future moment will become Present. How can Maya become real?
