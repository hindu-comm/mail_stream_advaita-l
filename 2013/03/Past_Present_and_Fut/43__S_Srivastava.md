Sir:

Is there any time when I experience that it is not "now"? The answer is
-NO. In my experience it is always NOW.

If we remain close to our experience we can see that "Not now" is only a
concept which no one has ever experienced. Images of past is a memory that
occurs only NOW. Images of future is projection that also occurs only NOW.

Similarly, do I ever experience that I am not "here"? Do I ever experience
that I am "there"? The answer is - NO. I always experience that I am
"here". Again, "Not here" is only a concept which no one has ever
experienced.

Try for a moment if you can escape from "here" and "now". You cannot.
Wherever you are, it is "here" and "now". There is no escape possible from
here and now.

If you look at the experience of "now" and "here" - not as a concept but as
it is happening right now - you will see that they are one and the same and
are indistinguishable from I awareness.
