Nobody can forcibly think anything. It is a gentle reminder required.

Sir: If I think the other person as my dream creation, why do I care for
the upsetting of "me" which is another dream character?

The gentle reminder technique that you describe above splits the experience
in two different orders of reality. One is "me" whose getting upset is
somehow more real and therefore requires a gentle reminder to alleviate
"my" suffering. The other is the non-me jIva who can be thought of as a
dream character. In our experience there is no such division. If both of
them are of the same order of reality why would I need to alleviate my
suffering through a gentle reminder?

Please think over that.
