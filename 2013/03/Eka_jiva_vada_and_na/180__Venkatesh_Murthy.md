Namaste

It is easy to say everything is my dream. But it is difficult to practice.

The Eka Jeeva Vada is coming to us from Vedanta only. Adi Sankara has
laid down four qualifications for study of Vedanta. They are Sadhana
Chatushtaya.

They are Viveka, Vairagya, Shatsampat, and Mumukshatva. They are
explained in many Internet sites.

The same four qualifications are a must for Eka Jeeva Vada also. It is
same as highest Vedanta teaching in Vyavahara plane.

In Paramartha Plane the Ajati Vada is highest. Nothing is born  there
is no liberation no Mumukshu no dream no dreamer. But it is too
difficult to practice.

It is not correct if a person practice Eka Jeeva Vada thinking
everything is my dream without the qualifications.
