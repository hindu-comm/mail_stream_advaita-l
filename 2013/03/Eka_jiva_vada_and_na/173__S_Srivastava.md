Sir: Thinking in a particular manner (..that all these people are in my
dream) is not helpful. The fact that all the jIVa-s (including one
particular jIva that claims subject hood) are just like dream characters-
is to be seen clearly so that there is no need to "think" in a forced
manner.

If I have to "think" that all the jIva-s are in my dream, then clearly I
have not seen this as a fact. If I have seen this as a fact, then I would
no longer have any necessity to "think" in this manner. It will be my
direct experience all the time.

In fact if I don't really see that all the jIva-s are dream characters,
then merely "thinking" so will be a false and worthless superimposition. It
will not be helpful for paramArtha, but will screw up vyavhAra also.
