Namaste

If you naturally feel like the people are dream characters thinking is
not required.

But a person if he is trying to adjust to the experience of everything
in waking is a dream he has to think like that. This thinking is for
beginners only. In the whole life from birth they are thinking all
people are outside them. Frequently repeating the thinking everything
in Jagrat Avastha is a dream is required for them. When they get
adjusted to this experience it may be natural for them.
