If you say Upadhi Bheda is causing Nana Jeeva and Hiranyagarbha it is
very weak argument. Because in Advaita Upadhi itself is not real. If
you neglect the Upadhi only the deamer is there. Nobody is outside the
dreamer. He is Alone he is dreaming and in his dream he is creating
Hiranyagarbha and other Jeevas and the Universe. The Hiranyagarbha and
other Jeevas are not real.

The Bhokta is not real also. The Bhoga is not real. The Bhoga Vastu is
not real. The dreamer is thinking he is Bhokta enjoying all things in
life but he is enjoying the dream objects only. The dreamer is
thinking he can enjoy with his body and mind. But his body and mind
are not real.
