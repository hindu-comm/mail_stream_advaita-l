Recently I came across a Hindi translation of the 'RatnaprabhA' commentary
on the Brahma sutra bhAShya of Shankara.  This commentary is very useful
for the understanding of the bhAShya. Those not well versed in Sanskrit but
know Hindi will find the publication extremely valuable. I read through a
few pages and found it to be quite good with a lot of foot notes and
annotations.

The details of the publication are:

'brahmasUtra hindi anuvAd'

'shAnkaraBhAShya - ratnaprabhA bhAShyAnuvAd sahit'

anuvAdak:  yativar shrI bhole bAbA'

In Five Volumes:  Total cost Rs.2500.  Talk to the Chennai book shop and
ask for maximum discount.
