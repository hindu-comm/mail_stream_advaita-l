Namaste

I am looking for* buying within India *or downloading the Haristuti (also
known as 'HarimeeDe stotram')of Sankaracharya with the Sanskrit commentary
'Hari-tattva-muktavali' of Svayamprakasayati. There is another commentary,
by Anandagiri, to this stuti.

Any leads on the above title(s) in the Digital Library of India or other
sources may please be provided.

regards
