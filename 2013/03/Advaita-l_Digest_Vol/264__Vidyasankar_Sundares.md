sorry for the half response in the previous post.

In a general sense, charity towards someone in need does not have to depend either on the recipient's varna or the yuga we live in. For specific religious purposes, one needs to look for deserving Brahmanas to give dana and dakshina. But this aspect, again, is not dependent on the yuga. 

Hence the question needs clarification for what prompts it.

regards,
Vidyasankar
