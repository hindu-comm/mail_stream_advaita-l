No one will mistake sthANu for vandhyAputraH. Because vandhyAputra is
alIka. Until that point, we are not disagreeing. (Further I not saying that
vandhyAputra exists in dream, nor that vandhyAputra is mithyA).

Why is vandhyAputraH alIka (and not something that is  'mistakeable' for
sthANu)? That is what I am trying to understand - and what types of asattva
it illustrates. From what I have heard in this thread, he is alIka because
there is a logical contradiction. But there is no contradiction, only a
tautology. If something is alIka because of a tautology, it is a trivial
example.
