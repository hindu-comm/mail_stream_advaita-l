I think you did not grasp the crucial, non-trivial difference, that was
made out between mithyA and alIka (asat) examples:  pratIyamAnatvam
(pratItiyogyatA) with regard to a mithyA vastu and apratIyamAnatvam
(pratItiyogyatAbhAvaH) with asat vastu.  One can mistake a distant pillar
(or a tree shorn of branches) for a person: sthANau puruShabhramaH.  But no
one will / can mistake the sthANu for a vandhyAputraH.
