[Replying to both Sri Sadananda's and Sri Subramanian's notes.]

Pranam.

>> "Vandhyaa putraH is logical contradiction "

I don't see how it is a logical contradiction. Isn't it simply a
restatement?
1. A woman who does not have children is called vandhyaa
2. A woman who does not have children (i.e, vandhyaa) does not have a son.

So where is the contradiction here?

So if I understand this correctly, (a) what is thought of as tAtkAlika asat
today could indeed turn out to have a vyaavahaarika sattva tomorrow. (Mad
scientists designing a shashaviShaaNa or kUrmaroma,  a kavi popularizing
megha as gaganakusuma, and so on). (b) The proverbial snake which has
vyaavahaarika sattva turns out to be asat, and is therefore designated
mithyaa.

Isn't it the same human mind that is thinking about 'sat' as well? Then
does the existence of sattva become paratantra to intelligent thought?

By statements like  "world does not exist", then what is meant is the
"world is mithyaa". Is that correct?
The context to this question is a recent offline discussion in which
incidentally, one of Sri Sadananda's articles was offered in support of
arguing for a less nuanced point "world does not exist / world exists in
the mind / etc." where mithyaatva fell by the wayside.

It is one thing to say that we cannot be certain about the existence or
lack thereof of something (e.g., did a tree fall in the forest just now? I
don't know. I'm not in the forest now.), but quite another to say that it
does not exist.
