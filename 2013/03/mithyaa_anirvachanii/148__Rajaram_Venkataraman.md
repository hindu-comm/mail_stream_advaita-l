RV:  It is not there and not experienced - asat (hare's horn). It is not
there but experienced  - mithya (pot). It is there but not experienced as
an object - sat (atman). Is there a category "It is there and experienced"?
Can brahman become an object of experience without losing its svarupa? I
think that is Ishwara but am sure many would disagree who say Ishwara is
mithya.
