All the above are Brahmadarshanam. I would cite this passage from Shankara
BGB 13.18:

अस्मिन् सम्यग्दर्शने कः अधिक्रियते इति उच्यते -- मद्भक्तः मयि ईश्वरे
सर्वज्ञे परमगुरौ वासुदेवे समर्पितसर्वात्मभावः यत् पश्यति शृणोति स्पृशति वा
'सर्वमेव भगवान् वासुदेवः' इत्येवंग्रहाविष्टबुद्धिः मद्भक्तः। स एतत् यथोक्तं
सम्यग्दर्शनं विज्ञाय, मद्भावाय मम भावः मद्भावः परमात्मभावः तस्मै मद्भावाय
उपपद्यते मोक्षं गच्छति।
//Who is fit for this true knowledge? The answer is: madbhaktah, My
devotee, who attributes the fact of being the Self of all to Me who am God,
Vasudeva, the Omniscient, the supreme Teacher, (and) whose conviction has
been saturated with the idea that whatever he sees, hears or touches, all
that verily is Lord Vasudeva. Vijnaya, by understanding; etat, this, the
aforesaid true knowledge; he upa-padyate, becomes qualified; mad-bhavaya,
for My State (bhava) -the State of being the supreme Self; for that State
of Mine. He attains Liberation.//

It is not so. Actually the bhashyam, in the original reads, ends, thus:
....साक्षिरूपद्वाद्वा. which means: (after the lengthy reasoning to
establish the inability of shastras/pramanas to 'apprehend' Vishnu,
Brahman, Shankara gives another reason) OR since Vishnu/Brahman is of the
nature of a Witness, it is impossible to objectify.

By sAkShi what Shankara is meaning is: He/It is the subject, viShayI, which
can never become an object/viShaya.

Please note that, as I pointed out above, the term sAkShI is used as a
viShayI and it is only relative to the vishaya.  Hence there can't be any
absolute status for sAkShi.  Since Advaita holds that Brahman is not even
the cause of the creation, epithets such as sAkShI and ishwara will still
be within the relative realm alone.
