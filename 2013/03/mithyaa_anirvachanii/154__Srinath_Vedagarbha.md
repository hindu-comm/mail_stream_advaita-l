It seems you are splitting vandhyAputraH as vandhya + aputraH, and hence
for you the meaning of that pada looks like "vandhyaa does not have a putra" .
 In such a split it is indeed tautological.

But vedAntin does not mean that kind of split. It has to be split as
vandhya + putra (that putra of vandhya). If you split this way, it yields
to a contradiction of type "vandhya's son".

Going further, if you were to assert a full sentence "vandhya's son does
not exist", it would then a tautological position. But just the word
vandhyAputra does not make it tautological.
