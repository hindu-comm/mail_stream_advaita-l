Namaste Sri Sadananda Mahodaya

In dream there is no difference between Vandhya Putra and real Putra
because anything is possible in a dream. I can see anything. How can
there be a restriction? I am seeing a dream always. When I sleep it is
a dream. When I think I am awake I am dreaming. Both waking and dream
are dream only.  In the dream I can see a Vandhya Putra I can see a
Gagana Kusuma and I can see a Rabbit with Horns and Rabbit barking
like a dog. Everything is possible in a dream. A dream is not real.

In so called waking we cannot see half man half lion. But we believe
Puranas saying there is Narasimha. It is possible there is Half Man
Half Lion. Like this it is possible in dream there will be a Vandhya
Putra and other so called impossible things.

There is nothing impossible to see in a dream.
