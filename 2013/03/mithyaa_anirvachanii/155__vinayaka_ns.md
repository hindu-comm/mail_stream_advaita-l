If you subscribe to shrishTi-drishTi vAda then there will be no problems.
The world was created by Ishwara and it is the result of his visualization.
The rig vEda says:

sUryA chandra-asau dhAtA yathApUrva akalpayat
divam cha prithivIm cha antariksham atho svah...

The world is there for the ignorants and it is  real for them. There is no
world in sushupti and when a jnAni is in samAdhi. Then, is it real or
unreal?
Swami Vidyaranya nicely answers:

knowledge and
Shruti it is negligible (tuccha); for empirical reason it is indefinable
(anirvachanIyA) and for the ordinary people it is real (vAstavI).
