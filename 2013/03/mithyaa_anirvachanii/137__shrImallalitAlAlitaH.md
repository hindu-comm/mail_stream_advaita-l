That's wrong way to interpret a word. vandhyAputraH is a word, while you
are interpreting it as a sentence.
The specific word means 'son of a barren woman'. It doesn't mean that 'a
barren woman doesn't have a son' or repetition of any kind.

The relation of 'son' with the 'woman' which is denoted by word 'of' is
opposed to barrenness of woman. Hence, there is contradiction.

Why go that much ? Just think of a child not yet born. That is not called
alIka though.

If such thing happens, then it will remove shashaviShANa, etc from the
category of alIka.
However, note that the defining quality or definition of rabbit doesn't
include horn. So, as soon as an animal gets horns by experiments will be
categoriged as something else, but not as rabbit. See name 'liger', which
denotes an animal developed by crossing of tiger and lion. The change of
qualities is followed by change of name !!

Those who say that gaganakusuma is alIka don't mean cloud by it. So, this
is not going to be considered.

I don't think the famous snake is accepted as vyAvahArika anywhere by
anyone.
It is actually prAtibhAsika.

Moreover, note that just destruction or non-existence is  not going to make
anything alIka. alIka is that which is not found existing anywhere at
anytime.

vedAntin-s never say that whatever they don't know is mithyA. They consider
it aGYAta and in cases paroxa.

The anirvachanIyatva or mithyAtva of world means sattvena =
pAramArthikatvena ​​asattvena = alIkatvena cha nirvachanAbhAvaH. We try to
prove the world as pAramArthika or alIka, but fail; so we call it mithyA.
This is a pAribhAShika word only.
