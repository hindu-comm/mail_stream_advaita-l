Namaste Sri Sadananda

The three categories Sat, Mithya, Asat are there in Advaita but I
think Asat and Mitya are same. Because they are seen in dream only. If
you wake up they are not there. In a dream you can see anything like a
Rabbit horns and Rabbit barking like a dog. Like this you can see
normal Rabbit also. Both are seen.

You are saying normal Rabbit is Mithya but Rabbit Horns is Asat. This
is not correct because both can be seen in a dream.

 If someone says we can never see Rabbit horns he is wrong. We can
draw a picture of Rabbit with horns and show it. We can show rabbit
animation pictures looking just like real rabbit with horns. In a
dream there is no impossible thing. You can see a Vandhya Putra and
his children also. You can see anything you want. But also anything in
a dream is not real except me. Both normal Rabbit and Rabbit with
horns are Asat only. There is no Mithya.

If you wake up from the dream there is only Sat.

Then why are you saying we must have three categories Sat, Mithya and
Asat ? There is a confusion.
