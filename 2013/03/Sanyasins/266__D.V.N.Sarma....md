Sanaka, Sanandana, Santkumara, Santsujata, Suka etc.

In Mahabharata there is discussion between a father and son about merits
and demerits
of going throgh the four asramas on onehand and taking sanyasa right after
brahmacharya.
(Santi or Anusasanika parva).

Some people do not even without taking brahmacharyasrama leave the sansara.
Example is Suka.

यं प्रव्रजंतमनुपेतमपेत कृत्यम्
द्वैपायनो विरहकातर आजुहाव।
पुत्रेति तन्मयतया तरवोभिनेदुः
तं सर्वभूतहृदयं मुनिमानतोस्मि।।
