Some organizations in the USA use panchangs calculated for India which 
will lead to wrong results.  Some discrepencies are also due to 
differences in calculation methods.

Personally I recommend www.mypanchang.com as the most accurate and 
confirming to smarta principles.  According to them, the proper date for 
Vijaya Dashami is October 13.
