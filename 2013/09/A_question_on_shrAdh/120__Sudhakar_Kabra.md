Dear learned friends,

ShrAdh paksha is here and many of us do tarpan and pinda dAna to our departed parents.

If someone's child (not newborn but middle age) dies and there are no other siblings, then

1.Is there any rule to do shrAdh for the child?
2.Can the parents do shrAdh for the departed son?
3.If not, then who is authorized to do it for the child?

Guidance, reference, help is requested.

Thanks and regards in advance
Sudhakar kabra
