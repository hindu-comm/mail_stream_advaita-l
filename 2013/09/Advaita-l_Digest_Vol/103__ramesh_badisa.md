Namaskaram,

I have one question lingering in my mind for a while, and would like to know your responses.
While reciting Gayatri mantra, it is always good that the mind be focused on the meaning of the mantra. This is known to all. However, instead on the 'meaning', can one focus on any Saguna Brahman form. Is there anything wrong in doing this? If not, can it give the same results. What would be the final result of this?

Namaskaram,
ramesh

?Let me examine this post here :
Let us take the second sentence-
What does it mean ?
jAti is eternal - is understood. It's oath part.
The part of sentence starting from 'as a...' is either cause or explanation
of eternity?
If first, then just formation of a cluster with a name associated can not
be the cause of eternity of jAti.? How could formation of cluster justify
that ?
If other, the first part of sentence would go upto the word 'collection'.
Then the first part will be: jAti is eternal as a collection. Now where
will you add rest of words starting from 'forms...'.

A collection of forms that share a lot
> of similarities between them is called a pot.


?A collection of forms is not called 'a pot'. It is called 'collection of
pots'.
And, if I accept the sentence as it is, then what will be the name for
individual pot.
?


> If your
> opinion is that an ideal pot is eternal and the individual pots are

> form is eternal.


?I hope in your uses 'ideal pot' means jAti. But, what does 'instances of
ideal' means?
If 'a place of revelation', then only your use of words can be justified.
Anyway, existence of individual pot is temporary - is my motive. And,
similar to that the form of kR^iShNa.
And, as not many kR^iShNa-s are seen, so there is no possibility of
kR^iShNa-jAti too.
?

>

?Wrong.
In first part you were talking about individuals, and hence you must
conclude about same in the second sentence.
Anyway, you are against your own stand because you are propounding that
jAti can be modified. That means jAti is not eternal, isn't it.
So, you started for eternity of individual forms and went to negate
eternity of jAti itself !!
?

?I can not sense any sense here.
Ishvara can not know dead ones as living ones. That will make him
hallucinated. So, individual names and forms of past things and people are
not eternal in this way too.
?

?OK. You mean satkAryavAda here.
So, just because everything is existing in the form of it's cause or it's
own form, you hold that it is eternal. In this sense, devadatta's dead
grandfather is also alive and hence he must start serving him directly with
medicines.
So, just get it that existence of anything in it's cause form is not
accepted as existence of the thing needed for behaviour. So, kR^iShNa's
form is not eternal.

?By reading your words 'as long as Ishvara exists', it appears that Ishvara
is limited by time and hence not eternal. Now, where is the case of
eternity of anything created by him.
?


> Yes, a nirguna brahma jnAni can negate all names and forms

?OK. Only neglect, but can not kill. So, it appears here that Ishvara is
eternal.
You are confused as you are saying one thing in one part of post and
opposite in other part.
Be consistent.
?

?So, ultimately you mean that there is no possibility of advaitic-mukti,
because without sarva-mukti there can not be real liberation. And, hence
Ishvara and everything he knows becomes eternal.
This appears essence of your logic.

Now, get it that as soon as you come to talk about mukhya-jIva in
eka-jIva-vAda, you are actually compromising with it's basics. You are just
negating your experience of being jIva and superimposing jIvAbhAsatva on
it. This is second level of adhyAsa.
I must say that for such people, eka-jIva-vAda was not taught.

?We are talking about form of kR^iShNa, which is by no means adR^iShTa.
Even his mother saw him nude, without reading scriptures.
?

?You may not know about indra, etc., but if you accept that kR^iShNa took

?

So, you mean that dhruva, etc. just saw chaturbhuja rUpa and that rUpa
didn't do anything with them, no boons, no words....because it is not said
by shAstra that viShNu says those words, and of course dhruva must not have
read something like that !!
?

?Utterly ignoring facts of birth of rAma and kR^iShNa just to prove your
stance correct.

"yen?tivrajya tri-gu?a?" does not mean one becoming traigunya.

it is inadequate.

You are nor right in assuming that the Advaitin desires for Mukti.

RV: What is the purpose of sravana, manana and nidhidhyasana if it is not
for moksha? On the other hand, a pure bhakta loves god out of natural
attraction. He does not desire moksha.

Also, there is no risk for a bhakta. If he does not get atma jnana, he will
be born in a family of yogis etc. and continue. Krisha says my devotee
never perishes. A bhakta may reject five types of moksha but he
nevertheless gets vishnu bhava - mad-bh?v?yopapadyate.

there is no ideal pot but a collection of objects that share certain

jAti or collection and an individual. There can be a jAti with a single
member also. The jAti is eternal is the argument.

maya. He will not know a dead man as alive but know all that a dead man
did. His name and form are eternal as His knowledge.

SKB : "yen?tivrajya tri-gu?a?" does not mean one becoming?traigunya.? 

RV: Please check Sridhara Swamin's purport and then we can come to yours if it is inadequate.

SKB : Shridharaswami reluctantly wrote the commentary on the Bhagavatam only at the behest of his guru, who commanded him (Shridharaswami) to write the commentary only to set right the? wrong interpretation of the Bhagavatam by Madhvacharya. For any intelligent person reading the commentary on the Bhagavatam to understand the Bhagavatam is an insult to Vedavyasa. Vedavyasa clearly stated? that he wrote the Bhagavatam so that one and all should understand the Bhagfavatm. If you say that you do not understand what is written in the Bhagavatam without the help of a commenatary then I shall be constarined to take that you are not worthy of reading the Bhagavatam. 

2)
SKB :You are not right in assuming that the Advaitin desires for Mukti. 


RV: What is the purpose of sravana, manana and nidhidhyasana if it is?not 
for moksha? On the other hand,?a?pure bhakta loves god out of natural 
attraction. He does not desire moksha.
SKB : Oh, now we can see why you could not understand Advaita so far. For your information the Advaitin do not want to be in the dark. The Advaitin stalwarts had understood well the Upanishads
including? the Mahavakyas and that had told them that the Brahmavid is no different from Brahman. If you are not able to understand this simple thing, it may be better for you to pray to Lord Krishna to give you the Advaita Jnana. Krishna-bhaktas never perish but they remain in the dark as long as they do not have the Advaita Jnana but without the Advaita Jnana they cannot become one with Krishna

Dear Shri Sunil,

There is no need for commentary if you understand that a pure bhakta
attains the supreme state of vishnu simply by the power of devotion though
he does not even desire liberation what to speak of temporary material
gains. Even advaita jnanam comes to him on its own accord.

sa eva *bhakti-yog?khya*
?tyantika ud?h?ta?
*yen?tivrajya tri-gu?a?*
*mad-bh?v?yopapadyate*

However, if your mind plays with the direct words of smrti, you have to go
to bhashya or a guru who as bhagavad bhakti. There are 11 extant
commentaries on SBh and it is not an insult to Vyasa but the statement of
its profound nature.

Best Regards
Rajaram Venkataramani

What is that 'bhAva'? If it is saguNa, then the Lakshmipatitvam of Vishnu
is inescapable. The devotees attaining to vishnubhAva will be lakshmipatis
by default. No one can prevent this because Vishnu Himself cannot prevent
being Lakshmipati since the Shv.up. defines Ishwara as 'mAyAm tu prakRtim
viddhi, mAyinam tu maheshwaram.' The very prospect of being maheshwara is
impossible without the dependence on the Lakshmi-principle.

If on the other hand, vishnubhAva is nirgunam, then the bhakta attaining it
is impossible, for the bhakta, with the advaitic knowledge will realize
that he is already vishnu, vyApanashIla, as Shankara explains in the
kathopanishad bhashyam. In that case there is no choice for the bhakta to
'not even desire moksha' and prefer to be a bhakta. Such supposed
bhakti-rasa statements as 'though he does not even desire liberation...'
are completely devoid of any substance and only look immature. They can at
best be arthavada statements directed at enthusing aspirants to have
devotion to bhagavan. The Vedanta is moksha shAstra. No one comes to it
for a purpose other than that.

The only way to escape both these possibilities is to admit the moksha of
the dvaita and vishishtadvaita systems where the mukta will remain
different from the Lord in the designated loka.



The munDakopaniShad bhAShya on mantra 3.2.6:



//They become freed on every side - they do not stand in need
of going elsewhere. And this is in accord with such Vedic and SmRti texts
as: 'Just as the footprints of birds cannot be traced in space and of
aquatics in water, similar is the course of the men of knowledge.'
(Mahabharata shAntiparvan 239.24), 'Those who want to go beyond the courses
of the world, do not tread on any path'(itihAsa upaniShat18). The Paths
(to be followed after death), which are dependent on spatial limitation,
are indeed within phenomenal existence, since they are attained through
limited means. But, Brahman, being the All, is not a goal to be attained
in terms of spatial limitations. Should Brahman be circumscribed by space
like any concrete object, It will be supported by something else, It will
have parts, It will be impermanent and a product. But Brahman cannot be
so; therefore Its attainment, too, cannot be determined in terms of
limitation of space. Besides, the knowers of Brahman accept only that
liberation which consists of the removal of ignorance, etc., which are the
causes of mundane bondage, and not that which is a product. //
