I am sad to report that my uncle and great Advaita scholar Shri Dr. C. N.
Deshpande passed away about a month ago at the age of 93. He was a close
disciple of Samarth Sadguru Shri Ganapat Rao Maharaj of Kannur. Please see
the following website for details of the Sadguru and teachings:

My uncle translated many key works from Marathi to Kannada, including the
Jnaneshwari and the hagiography of Shri Ganapat Rao Maharaj. Prior to
retirement, he taught Sanskrit at Karnatak University in Dharwad. Some of
his students recollect his absolute mastery over Kalidasa's plays.  He was
also a key contributor of many articles on Advaita in Kannada periodicals.
He played a vital role in the growth of the Advaiti Prabodhaka Sangha in
the Hubli-Dharwad area.
His lectures on the Panchadashi and various topics in Vedanta were very
popular among people of the area.

Anand
