RV: Sankara considers the Lord as the Self not anAtman.

4.6 Api, san ajah, though I am birthless; and avyayatma, undecaying by
nature, though I am naturally possessed of an undiminishing power of
Knowledge; and so also api san, though; isvarah, the Lord, natural Ruler;
bhutanam, of beings, from Brahma to a clump of grass; (still) adhisthaya,
by subjugating; svam, My own; prakrtim, Prakrti, the Maya of Visnu
consisting of the three gunas, under whose; spell the whole world exists,
and deluded by which one does not know one's own *Self*, Vasudeva;-by
subjugating that Prakrti of Mine, sambhavami, I take birth, appear to
become embodeid, as though born; atma-mayaya, by means of My own Maya; but
not in reality like an ordinary man. It is being stated when and why that
birth occurs:

RV:  In the same BSB 2.1.14, the nirupadhika brahman is called sarvajna. I
have cited this and also said that in many places nirupadhika brahman is
called Ishwara and Ishwara is called the Self. When the pot is broken,
there will obviously be no knowledge of the pot and its effects such as
space outside and inside or any difference between space outside and
inside. It does not mean that space was negated. When the Brahman appears
in this world, He is Brahman only. The following is a playful
interpretation of this because you cite it way too often and derive every
conclusion from one paragraph. " In this post-negation scenario the
ignorance-realm
of Ishwara-Ishitavya (ruler-ruled) duality and omniscience, etc. do not
have a place. Hari and His bhaktas are one. There is no duality of ruler
and ruled between them. They cover their knowledge with their own power
which makes the impossible possible for the purpose of enacting the lila of
stealing  butter. Omniscience does not have a place there. They are
powerless when Yasoda chastises them and binds Damodara. So, there is no
omnipotence. Where is the omnipresence of the Lord for the liberated gopis
who cannot see Him suddenly?"

RV: Please see the detailed response I gave to your previous post.  He
clearly admits of an eternal form of Ishwara.

RV:There is a sea of difference between acts of devotion (sadhana bhakti)
talked of here and devotion, which is sAkshAt Ishwara.
