That's wrong. Let the jAti be eternal in terms of AkalpasthAyI. But, how

I can't understand what do you want to express by 'particular form is

mAyA itself is mithyA. Then where is the talk of anything made with it.

What if shruti says something opposed to yukti and other pramANa-s. He
seems to ignore this fact.

Here it appears that he is trying to escape and hence is nodding head to
your insistence.
Anyway, this whole thing was not enough to persuade us.
