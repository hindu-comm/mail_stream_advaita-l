Sankachuda tried to think that he is the consort of gopis and Krishna
enacts the pastime of killing the demon. Transcendence is for those who
have gone past nishidda and kamya karma from whose heart anarthas such as
lust, greed, anger, envy, pride etc. have completely gone. In this
anecdote, the three stages of devotion (I am He, He is Mine and I am His)
are on display and let me show how.

1. He attains the first stage of I am He (Lakshmi Narasimha), which is why
the form that was in front of Him disappeared. <quote> ...  amazing event
occurred. AcharyaL withdrew His hand from My head, joined His palms and
gazed at Me silently with deep reverence. My breathing stopped. The form of
Lakshmi-Narasimha that I was seeing within Me vanished. </quote>
2.  He then comes down to the second stage of He is mine. <quote> However,
I began to experience the Lord as My antaryAmin (Inner Controller), refuge
and intimate well-wisher as clearly as one can see a fruit in one's open
palm.  </quote>
3. He then comes down to the third stage I am His. <quote>I ceased to
regard the body, prANa, organ, mind and intellect as MIne; everything was
just His. </quote>

Mahaperiyava sees all the states of Bhakti as non-different from Ishwara.
<quote>All along I did see Acharyal keeping His palms joined and looking in
My direction.</quote>

Once his mind comes back to normal from the state of devotion, the form
re-appears.  <quote>Then, the form of Narasimha reappeared and My breathing
resumed.....I now felt extremely intimate with Narasimha. </quote>

Mahaperyava explains that he saw the lord in the place of his disciple when
he was in trance. <quote> At the same time Acharyal lowered HIs
hands...After completing the initiation He said, 'After You had said the
mantra once, I saw just Narasimha in Your place. That is why I jerked back
My hand from Your head and offered My salutation to Him. When His form
disappeared and You reappeared, I proceeded with the initiation. Dedicate
everything to Him.'' </quote>

RV: Please read carefully what Sankara says. He is a paroksha jnani who is
on the path to the supreme brahman. <quote> 'I am verily Vasudeva, the
Lord, and none else', that man of Knowledge asthitah, *is set on the path
leading to*, he is engaged in ascending to, going to; mam eva, Me alone, *to
the supreme Brahman;* who am the anuttamam gatim, super-excellent Goal to
be reached. </quote>
