*Sri Mani Dravid Sastrigal has said that MS in the Advaita siddhi has
clarified that 'aprAkRtam' is also within prakRti alone.  The difference is
that while the prAkRtam is a modification through the pancha bhutas, the
aprakRtam is a direct effect of prakRti, mAyA.  Still, the effects of
prAkRtam could be witnessed in the bodies of Rama and Krishna, who were
born from a womb, grew up, became adults, got married and became fathers
and grandfathers and also finally disappeared.  There is an account of
Krishna's death and even last rites.

Actually, in an earlier post of mine I had taken up sentences from this
commentary of MS to show that MS himself does not talk of a form for
Ishwara. A temporary form of Krishna, etc. is different from the
formless-form of Ishwara of Advaita.  It is like a jIva who has no form,
still exists as long as he attains moksha, still taking one body after
another.  The formless Ishwara exists in vyavahara assuming one or the
other forms as narasimha, krishna, etc.  While the former formless Ishwara
is a concept, the latter formed appearance is mAyic, as Shankara states. It
is only the conceptual Ishwara of Advaita which is 'yAvatkAlasthAyI', the
one that lasts till time lasts.  And, as already known to everyone, time
itself is a product of mAyA as per Advaita, admitted solely to explain and
manage the vyAvahArika.
