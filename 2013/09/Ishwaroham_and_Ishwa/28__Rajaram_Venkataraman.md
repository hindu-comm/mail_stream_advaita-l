RV: No.

RV: In any language, there are only finite set of fundamental sounds. There
are well or ill defined rules by which these sounds are combined to create
words. Without words, you cannot indicate objects. A new word is produced
from the same fundamental sounds whether it is derived from existing words
or not. In that sense, it is eternal because it is from the same sound that
existed before.

RV: From the words, lap, top and computer you say laptop computer, is there
a real or apparent modification of lap etc.? If you create a new sound kit
kat from existing ki, t and ka, is it a real or apparent modification of ki
etc.? The fundamental sounds are immutable but their combination is. (As an
aside, a word or a sentence indicating an eternal truth will be immutable).
