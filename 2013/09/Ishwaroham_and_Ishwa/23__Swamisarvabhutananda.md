OM
The methodology of unfolding BrahmajnAnam has a prerequisite of adhikAritvam.
This great status includes 'shraddA in Sruti,sharddA in the Guru'
Otherwise one turns out to be a vidandAvAdi or a jalpA vAdi.
The unfold meant of BrahmajnAnam is so perfect and one has to blame oneself if not understood and continue to be a poorvapakshI.
I enjoy the purvapaksha  siddhAnta in this forum.
