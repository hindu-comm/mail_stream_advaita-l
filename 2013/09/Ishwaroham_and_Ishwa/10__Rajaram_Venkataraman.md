RV: What do you mean by no understanding? Any meanigful word will produce
an understanding in our minds. The understanding may not be what the
speaker intended and hence can be wrong but how is it possible to have no
understanding?

​
There can be no eternal pot.
RV: Why? If the word pot is eternal, then the object indicated by it must
also be eternal. ​

​See here, the 'is called a pot' portion can be directed to the subject
'collection of objects' in your sentence. Now, how could a collection of
objects, which are definitely not pot(otherwise you would have mentioned
it), which shares certain characteristics(of whom ? pot or plant ?) be
called pot ?? No sane person will accept it.
RV: By the word cow in cow dung, you mean a single cow, a set or collection
of cows and also a class of animals. The word pot can mean a single pot
(e.g. broken pot), collection of pots (e.g. pot store) and a class (e.g.
mud pot).

RV: You have access to the scholar now where you are. He accepts that
Krishna's form is eternal (in vyavahara). We should go by pramanas not
dogmas.
