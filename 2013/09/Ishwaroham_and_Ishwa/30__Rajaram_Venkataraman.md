RV: As they are in Ishwara, all names and forms are eternal not "eternal"
because Ishwara, who is formless, is beyond space and time. However, names
and forms including those in smrti sastras depend on a cogniser. As the
cogniser is time limited by space and time, these names and forms are.  On
the other hand names and forms in shruti do not depend on a cogniser for
its existence. This is eternal in a special way of not being limited by
space and time. Krishna playing on Yamuna banks is in the shruti. It is
eternal in a special way of not being limited by space and time. We have to
differentiate between eternal and non-eternal. A jnana yogi will
concentrate on nirguna brahman. A bhakta will focus on the eternal form of
Krishna etc. As the Lord says in BhG, it is ifficult o focus on the
eternal formless but is easier to focus on the eternal form.

RV: Why all these labour? You cannot speak of hare's horn or innocent
criminal unless you perceive the concept. The object here is the object.

When you see an object for which you don't know the name, you know it as
nameless and don't wrongly attribute names such as pot to it for which you
have object association. A child may not know the names of objects but that
does not make that object nameless. Creators languages are like children.

RV: What is the need on your part to presume when I clearly said  "The
fundamental sounds are immutable but their combination is. (As an aside, a
word or a sentence indicating an eternal truth will be immutable)"?

But then, just one paragraph ago, you stated, "In that sense, it is eternal
> because it is from the same sound that existed before," which, logically

RV:  A sentence that depends on a cogniser is not eternal as the sentence
that does not depend on a cogniser though both may have same words and
fundamental sounds that are eternal. Where is the contradiction?

RV: You, LalitalAlita and Subrahmanian are attacking me logically with a
view to educate and establish truth - no need to be sorry. I'm proud of
you.
