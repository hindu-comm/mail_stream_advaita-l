Sunilji - PraNAms
There is anugeeta, where Krishna again teaches Arjuna. 
Hari Om!
Sadananda

>Many persons think that a Paroksha Jnani will have to make all statements conforming to Paroksha-Jnana only. However that is not true. When Arjuna asked his sakha Lord Krishna to repeat the Bhagavad Gita a second time, the latter refused saying that he was in a yogayukta state (a different state) at that time. A Paroksha-jnani can make both Paroksha and Aparoksha statements, whereas an Aparoksha-Jnani can make only Aparoksha statements.
