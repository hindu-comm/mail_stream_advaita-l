> RV: There are four questions that you should ask yourself or your teacher.
If the answer is yes to any one of them you should answer no to the the
last question. I may seem rudehere but am. Our system is based on pramanas.
Principles are more important than people.

1. Is the lord's body made of five elements?
2. Is the lord's body made of subtle elements?
3. Is the Lord actually embodied as we are?
4. Is there a real relationship between the Lord and His body?
5. Am I an advaitin?

If you read MS 4.6, you will get the right answers with reasons.

Very well said.  Actually MS in that commentary only means: //The
personality of Ishwara is eternal, till such time 'time' exists.//

RV: Does He have a body? If so, is His body gross or subtle? If His body is
gross, then He co-exists with Virat. If His body is subtle, then He
co-exists with Hiranyagarbha. If He does not have a body, does He occupy
someone else's body? Then He is like ghost.

This means: The mAyopAdhi Ishwara that I am, that is endowed with all the

RV: If you quote half his sentence, it is misleading. The full sentence is
"With physical eyes you cannot see Me who am possesed of all the qualities
of elements and who am endowed with the causal body as the upadhi".

RV: Madhusudana Saraswati says this, "He dispels the notion of His
acceptance of fresh body; the notion of separation from a previous body by
saying avyayaytma api san".

RV: All the names and forms in the shruti are eternal. This is basic
mimamsa logic.

RV: Please see my quote above. You are directly contradicting Madhusudana
if you talk about His separation from a previous body and acceptance of a
new body. The appearance of transitional forms from
vyavahara perspective is like the appearance and disappearance of sun.
Please refer the first line of 4.5
