> RV: I'm explaining two cases where a pot is eternal. In one case, there is
an ideal pot and other pots are made similar to that. In the second case,
there is no ideal pot but a collection of objects that share certain
characteristics is called a pot. When we say pot, we can refer to both the
jAti or collection and an individual. There can be a jAti with a single
member also. The jAti is eternal is the argument.

RV: I'm not negating eternality of jAti but saying the opposite. An
apparently new jAti is nothing but modification of existing ones.

RV:  We can only say that Ishwara knows every thing through the power of
maya. He will not know a dead man as alive but know all that a dead man
did. His name and form are eternal as His knowledge.

Devadatta's dead grand father as that karma is finished. Krishna appears in
the same form as His form is not produced by karma but by His will. That is
the difference.

RV:  No inconsistency. As long as Ishwara exists is used in the sense He is
eternal.

RV: Let me be the mukhya jiva. Even then, I know that cycle of creation is
eternal.

RV: We know of Krishna only through scriptures. For this who saw Him during
avatara, He was known through  direct perception. If we see Him now, it
will be though direc perception. But we can know He is Krishna only through
sastras.
