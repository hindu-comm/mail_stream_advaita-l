> RV: As they are in Ishwara, all names and forms are eternal not "eternal"


The reason I put quotes around the word eternal is to distinguish real eternality 
from your conception of "eternal as long as vyavahAra lasts".



> because Ishwara, who is formless, is beyond space and time. However, names


So you recognize that formlessness is more fundamental for ISvara than a form
that lasts as long as vyavahAra lasts.

How so? By what logical process do you establish that names, forms, words
and sentences in Sruti do not depend on a cognizer for their very existence? If
not for the existence of brahman, the veda would not exist. The upanishat says
that the veda was "breathed out" of brahman and in the smRti, we are told
"vedavid eva cAham." If not for that cognizer, the veda is not. And the veda
itself says as much. It also says, "tatra vedA avedAH."

The concept is not an object of perception, merely a verbal construction that 
corresponds to no object in the universe. You have still not addressed why it
is valid for you to jump from objects/entities to words/sounds.

The reason is that your sentence construction is very ambiguous. A reader does
not clearly know whether you meant to say,



"The fundamental sounds are immutable, but their combination is (not immutable)."



or



"The fundamental sounds are immutable, but their combination is (mutable)"



or



"The fundamental sounds are immutable, and (instead of but) their combination is
(immutable)."



The reason for the third choice above is that you had just argued "any new jAti is 
a combination of already existing jAtis" and you had argued for the existence of
infinite eternal (so long as vyavahAra lasts) jAtis. Then you jumped away from jAti
to sound. Eternality has to mean immutability, necessarily so. So one reasonably
has to ask whether you really meant that a combination of eternal jAtis (or sounds
in your latest argument) could somehow be non-eternal and mutable.

See above, re: veda and cognizer.

I wasn't really apologizing! Saying "I'm sorry ..." is just a style of speaking, to
ease out the intensity of this written conversation in a  polite manner. :-)
It is just one of those features of the English language where the words say
one thing and mean something else!
