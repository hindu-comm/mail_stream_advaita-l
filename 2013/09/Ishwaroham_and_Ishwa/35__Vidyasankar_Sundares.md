Once more, patiently. An eternal form (albeit only till vyavahAra lasts) is not
consistent with formlessness. A form is what is called taTastha-lakshaNa. The
formlessness is svarUpa-lakshaNa. In any case, what people here (including
me) are taking issue with is your very notion of "eternality till vyavahAra lasts."
If you accept that vyavahAra has an end, then something that ends with it is
not eternal, by definition. What is really eternal is what persists beyond time
and across time, past, present and future.

Please do not latch on to one passage and draw your own meaning, ignoring
all the rest. There is an internal consistency across the works of a given author.
In the context of interpreting the bhagavadgItA, mahat, avyakta and ahaMkAra
come before the sUkshma and sthUla bhUta-s, e.g. chapter 7, verse 4-5. So,
these three are mAyArUpa and are part of the lower prakRti as well, but not
made of gross or subtle elements. Elsewhere as well (chapter 13), we learn of
two prakRti-s of bhagavAn, and we have bhagavatpAda's interpretation,
"prakRti-dvayavattvam eva hi ISvarasya ISvaratvam." In another verse in the
same chapter, we are also told "sarvendriya guNAbhAsa" and "sarvendriya
vivarjita", "asakta" and "sarvabhRt", "nirguNa" and "guNabhoktA." Put all
these together in thinking of the Lord's form(s).

No, let's leave that for a separate thread. One needs agreement on basics for a
discussion to happen.
