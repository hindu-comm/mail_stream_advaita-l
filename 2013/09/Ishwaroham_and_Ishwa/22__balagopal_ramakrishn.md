Dear Rajaram Venkataramani,

>>>This "fall down", "saviour" etc. are good initial sentiments.


Examples are meant to convey certain aspect; not for enquiring further with 'whys' & 'hows'. It will lead to more confusion and also..


>>>>When we ask who fell down, who saves, why did he allow me to fall etc. these sentiments will not persist.


... leads to infinite regression

>>>You have not answered the key questions in yes or no format.
>>>Hence, I don't know your position clearly on Lord's form as much as I know Madhusudana's.


I 'm repeating for your convenience the following:


>>1.Is the lord's body made of five elements? 
>>2. Is the lord's body made of subtle elements?
>>3. Is the Lord actually embodied as we are?

Lord shortchanged the subtle and gross unlike me to appear. I see him embodied because of my ignorance.


>>Is there a real relationship between the Lord and His body?


When the body of the Lord is an appearance (due to my ignorance) what relationship can one cast!


>>Am I an advaitin?


Mine is for 'vasanakshayam'. i.e work in progress.


Regards

Balagopal
