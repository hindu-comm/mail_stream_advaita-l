Namaskaram. What is your pramana for concluding that I argue for arguments sake out of sheer ego? Even if you think I'm wrong, do you think it is possible that my conviction may be due to wrong understanding rather than bad intention? As far as I know, I have no interest but truth of the subject. 

Madhusudana Saraswati like Sridhara explicitly says Krishna's form is eternal. It is not just his opinion but supported by logic and sabda pramana. If you say Krishna's form is temporary, it is for you to base your statement on the works of an advaita purvacharya and sastras. I agree that we - not only me but we - should go by pramanas.

OM
I appreciate your reply toRV.
The basics of shraddA if not there and if one wants to argue for the sake of argument and such a person cannot be handled,as the EGO wants to establish the idea.
It is a pramAna vishayA and shraddA.
I enjoy this group discussion.
