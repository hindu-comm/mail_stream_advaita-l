Only relation of word with meaning doesn't grants that word will produce
understanding. It is 'the knowledge of relation of word and meaning' which
is needed. That's why I can't understand Tamil, although Tamil words have
meanings.
So, it is possible that words may not generate any understanding.

The name of devadatta's grandfather is eternal, hence his grandfather is
eternal !!! Who is going to put faith in such idiotic logic?

It may be. But, you were talking of eternal pot. What does this logic
benefits to that stance ?
