The event being talked about here is a case of mantra-siddhi for a master yogi. It
cannot easily be equated with bhakti in the kind of philosophical stance that you
are taking. At least, it is unclear to me how you can draw equivalences for bhakti
with stages along a yogic path.



On another note, perhaps you can see from this account why we advaitins naturally
put our gurus on a pedestal. It still does not mean that we elevate them over the
gods.

Whichever way one interprets it, again, it is unclear what you are driving at. The 
basic issues of formlessness vs. your notion of eternal form still remain.
