Namaste,
 I just heard from my mother that Sundararaman mama had passed away on Saturday 28th september. It is sad to hear this.

I remeber thanking him for uploading all the vedantic talks and also for updating them on time.

We were very fortunate to listen to shankarajayanthi talks every year.

In his mails he used to end saying sathsangha as parama Gathihi. 

May we learn from his good deeds .

May His soul rest in peace.
