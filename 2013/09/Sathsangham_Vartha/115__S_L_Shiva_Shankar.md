Namaste,

IÂ´m very sorry to hear about Sri K. Sundararaman. I have exchanged many
private mails with him over the last 9 years or so, and he never got tired
in supporting advaita vedanta and traditional scholars such as Mani Dravid
Sastrigal, Goda Venkateshwara Sastrigal and R. Krishnamurthi Sastrigal. It
is very sad indeed to know that he has left us.

Warm regards
Shivashankar
