Namaste,

Very shocking to hear !

He was the person who was very meticulously recording the lectures of Sri Mani Ji, Sri Goda Ji and Sri Krishnamurty Ji.  He was also maintaining the advaita website and was uploading all the lectures of these three stallwarts of advaita.

The loss cannot be replaced in advaita circles.

regs,
sriram
