Dear Abhishek,



I don't criticize your article as being baseless and I happen to agree with
much of what you have written about the current Indian education system
and the content that is being taught. The criticisms of the other issues are
indeed fine in their own right. Nevertheless, I do think the basic question
about the wording of the saMkalpa has not been adequately answered.
In retrospect, I think I was disappointed because I was curious to see what
definitive or even plausible conclusions/suggestions would be offered for
this question and that did not come across. 

Regards,

Vidyasankar
