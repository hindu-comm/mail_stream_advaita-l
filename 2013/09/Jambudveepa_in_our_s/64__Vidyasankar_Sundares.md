Bhaskar, articles like these are always disappointing, because they go off on a tangent about Aryans,
Western missionaries, Indian government and education etc. After reading through it, I could not find
the author proposing a definitive answer to the question. All the northern continents may be part of
jambUdvIpa, but America and Europe are nevertheless not part of bhAratavarsha, bharatakhaNDa.
So, what are they? I find nothing and I wonder if the author does have an answer.

For what it is worth, all south Indian purohitas in the US whom I've seen say the saMkalpa as kraunca-
dvIpe, ramaNaka-varshe aindra-khaNDe, no matter whether they are Srauta-smArta or SrIvaishNava or
mAdhva. I have no idea what other traditions transplanted here say and I have no idea what they say
in Europe.
