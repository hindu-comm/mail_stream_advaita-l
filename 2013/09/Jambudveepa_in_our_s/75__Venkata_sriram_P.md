Namaste,

////
Therefore they are not there in the Brahmandaâ€‹
//

No. They are verily there in brahmANDa so long as vyavahAra is there.  vishwaM bhUtaM bhuvanaM "chitraM bahudhA jAtaM" is the shruti vAkya.

It should be noted that Sri Narasimha Bharati Mahaswamigal of Sringeri used to visit Gokarna daily in sukshma shareeram and worship Lord Mahabaleshwara.  

The temple priest of Gokarna Sri Mahabala Bhatta had a typical vision of His Holiness worshipping there in sukshma shareeram.  But interesting fact is that Swamigal used to be in Sringeri only.

So, all the lokas are there in vyavahAra which can be reached through yOga and bhAvana.  

Ultimately, all these merge in one absolute upon the dawn of swarupa-jnAna.  To talk in terms of paramArtha jnAna, only brahman exists.  

tamEva bhAntaM anubhAti vishwaM....

regs,
sriram
