Dear Sri Balasurbramanian, I am currently conducting subhashitam class on
Skype thrice a week: Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday from 10 to 10.30 PM.
You can join if interested.  We cover just one shloka, do the lingam,
vibhakti, vachanam, and kriya padam analysis and overall meaning/anvaya.
My Skype id is: Subrahmanian.VS.

Also, my friend Shrivatsa is conducting Valmiki Ramayana classes on same
lines as above on Skype twice a week - Sat and Sundays afternoon.  Many
people are benefiting.  Pl. get in touch with him, if interested.

Thanks

Namaste,

Samskrita Bharati has a popular  correspondence based learning course that
spans over 2 years. This course is beautifully designed to cultivate
interest and increase the knowledge of Samskritam. It has adopted simple
ways of familiarizing students with the rich literature of Samskritam. For
example, verses/passages from Daily prayers, Ramayana, Gita, Raghuvamsha
 are taken to explain the grammar and provide opportunity to enjoy the
richness of these texts as well.

This course is in 4 levels, each of 6 months duration followed by an exam.
Exams are scheduled in August and February. Exams are of high quality and
certificate is issued to students which is well recognised. At the end of
this course, one will be able to read  texts like Bhagawadgita and Ramayana
in its original form with minimum support.

 Level 1 - Pravesha
Level 2 - Parichaya
Level 3 - Shikshaa
Level 4 - Kovida


In South Bangalore, contact classes happen at various places to help
students who have taken up such courses. I take classes on every Saturday
at my residence (9th Block, Jayanagar) and at SymInda in Jayanagar 4T
Block.
