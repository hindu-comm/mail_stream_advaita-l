The Upanishad bhashyam series  of this institution comes with various
traditional sub-commentaries and several foot notes by  Late Vidwan
S.Subrahmanya SastrigaL.  The eminent scholar Dr.Mani dravid SastrigaL  had
studied under him.

The footnotes  are of the nature of providing extra information with cross
references to Shankara's sutra bhashya, comparative commentaries of
Ramanuja and Madhwa schools on selected mantras, etc. That way the series
is of especially great utility.
