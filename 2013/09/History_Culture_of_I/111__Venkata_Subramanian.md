Hi All,

I came across a 11 volume series on Indian History, by Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan.

I just wanted to know whether it is worth buying - for I couldnt see critical views about it in the NET....

Any comments from our friends here...is it overall authentic ........fit one to buy and preserve ?!

Regards, Venkat.
