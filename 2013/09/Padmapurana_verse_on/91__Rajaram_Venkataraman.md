Dear Shri Sunil,

There is no need for commentary if you understand that a pure bhakta
attains the supreme state of vishnu simply by the power of devotion though
he does not even desire liberation what to speak of temporary material
gains. Even advaita jnanam comes to him on its own accord.

sa eva *bhakti-yogākhya*
ātyantika udāhṛtaḥ
*yenātivrajya tri-guṇaṁ*
*mad-bhāvāyopapadyate*

However, if your mind plays with the direct words of smrti, you have to go
to bhashya or a guru who as bhagavad bhakti. There are 11 extant
commentaries on SBh and it is not an insult to Vyasa but the statement of
its profound nature.

Best Regards
Rajaram Venkataramani
