 "yenātivrajya tri-guṇaṁ" does not mean one becoming traigunya.

RV: Please check Sridhara Swamin's purport and then we can come to yours if
it is inadequate.

You are nor right in assuming that the Advaitin desires for Mukti.

RV: What is the purpose of sravana, manana and nidhidhyasana if it is not
for moksha? On the other hand, a pure bhakta loves god out of natural
attraction. He does not desire moksha.

> RV: If you are not qualified and follow the path of jnana, you run the
risk of becoming unhappy. On the other hand, Bhakti does not need
qualification as we see from countless examples in smrti and legends.
Also, there is no risk for a bhakta. If he does not get atma jnana, he will
be born in a family of yogis etc. and continue.  Krisha says my devotee
never perishes. A bhakta may reject five types of moksha but he
nevertheless gets vishnu bhava - mad-bhāvāyopapadyate.
