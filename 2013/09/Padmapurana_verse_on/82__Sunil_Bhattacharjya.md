Dear friends,
There was a discussion on the
Mayavada in another group and one scholar referred to the verse
(62.31) from the  Padmapurana, Uttarakhanda  and said as follows :
Quote
The
term मायावाद finds place in
Padma Purana, Uttarakhanda, verse 62.31, a verse which the Vaishnavas
consider as authentic and Advaita followers consider as a later
interpolation.  
Unquote
Kindly look at the following advaitic
interpretation of the Padmapurana verse (62.31) and I shall invite
your valuable comments on it.

mAyAvAdam
asac-chAstram
pracchannaM bauddhaM ucyate
mAyaiva vihitaM
devI
kalau brAhmana-murtina (Padma Purana, Uttara-khanda 62.31)
In my opinion the Advaitins do not
think the verse to be interpolated as they know the correct
interpretation of the verse as follows:
In Veda it is said that "Sat"
came from "Asat", which means the "Sat" or the
physical existence or creation came form "Asat", which is
beyond existence. Mayavada teaches that the Lord has created the
universe with his "Maya" and the Svetasvatara Upanishad
says the "Maya is the "Prakrti". A liberated person
realizes his or her oneness with The Brahman and for the liberated
there is no more any separate physical existence for him, i.e., Maya
or Prakrti does not exist (for him or her) and also realizes that the
so-called pre-liberation stage was only a superimposition.
On the other hand there is no
liberation for the Vaishnavas as the Bhagavatam clearly states that
the pure devotees do not want to get liberated at the cost of service
to the Lord and therefore they do not accept any type of liberation.
The relevant verse is as follows:
sAlokyasArShTisAmIpya
sArUpyaikatvamapyuta 
dIyamAnaM na grihnanti vinA matsevanaM
janaH, (Bhagavatam 3.29.13)
Regards,
