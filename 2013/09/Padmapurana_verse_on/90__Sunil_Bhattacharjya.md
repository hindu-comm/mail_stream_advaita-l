1)
SKB : "yenātivrajya tri-guṇaṁ" does not mean one becomingtraigunya. 

RV: Please check Sridhara Swamin's purport and then we can come to yours if it is inadequate.

SKB : Shridharaswami reluctantly wrote the commentary on the Bhagavatam only at the behest of his guru, who commanded him (Shridharaswami) to write the commentary only to set right the wrong interpretation of the Bhagavatam by Madhvacharya. For any intelligent person reading the commentary on the Bhagavatam to understand the Bhagavatam is an insult to Vedavyasa. Vedavyasa clearly stated that he wrote the Bhagavatam so that one and all should understand the Bhagfavatm. If you say that you do not understand what is written in the Bhagavatam without the help of a commenatary then I shall be constarined to take that you are not worthy of reading the Bhagavatam. 

2)
SKB :You are not right in assuming that the Advaitin desires for Mukti. 


RV: What is the purpose of sravana, manana and nidhidhyasana if it isnot 
for moksha? On the other hand,apure bhakta loves god out of natural 
attraction. He does not desire moksha.
SKB : Oh, now we can see why you could not understand Advaita so far. For your information the Advaitin do not want to be in the dark. The Advaitin stalwarts had understood well the Upanishads
including the Mahavakyas and that had told them that the Brahmavid is no different from Brahman. If you are not able to understand this simple thing, it may be better for you to pray to Lord Krishna to give you the Advaita Jnana. Krishna-bhaktas never perish but they remain in the dark as long as they do not have the Advaita Jnana but without the Advaita Jnana they cannot become one with Krishna

>The Bhagavatam itself says that the Bhakta does not get any type of Mukti. Anybody with open mind will very well understand that the mental state of the Bhakta is such that he prefers to stay in the dark by clinging to the Ishvara through the rope of Bhakti and does not want to open the door to get the light of Jnana. The Advaita jnana may not come to such people in one birth.

RV: Ifyou are not qualified and follow the path of jnana, you run the risk of becoming unhappy. On the other hand,Bhakti does not need qualification as we see from countless examples in smrti and legends. Also,there isno risk for a bhakta. If he does notget atma jnana, he will be born in a family of yogis etc. and continue.Krisha says my devotee never perishes.A bhakta may reject five types ofmoksha but he neverthelessgets vishnu bhava -mad-bhāvāyopapadyate.
sa eva bhakti-yogākhya
ātyantika udāhṛtaḥ
yenātivrajya tri-guṇaṁ
mad-bhāvāyopapadyate
