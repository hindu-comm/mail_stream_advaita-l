RV: What is patitvam according to you? Para Vasudeva from who Sankarashana,
Pradyumna, Vasudeva and Aniruddha forms expands is formless.

RV: Impossibility of attaining is true of one in jnana marga also. If there
is bhakti in mukti, there is no jnana in mukti also. Both are merely
modifications of the mind. If the reflections of Brahman on mind are
accepted as real, then bhakti is there in mukti, jnana is there in mukti.

RV: Between you and Shri Sunil, please agree whether you have moksha as the
goal or not.  I agree with you that for those pursuing jnana yoga, moksha
is the goal but Sunil disagrees. If you say moksha is your goal, I have to
point out that it is a position of ignorance because no one is really
bound.

RV: A pure bhakta rejects such moksha according to SBh  verse quoted. You
have to base your position on pramanas.
