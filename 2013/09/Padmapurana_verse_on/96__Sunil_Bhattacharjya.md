Please do not try your trick to divert matters. If the Bhakta is not in darkness then what is the need for the Lord to give the Jnana to them. Do you think the Lord to be a fool ? You think you will go on trying all tricks in your writing in your attempt to catch an advaitin in the wrong foot. Please give up your futile attempts. The Advaita has the support of the shastras..

Dear Shri Sunil, Namaskaram.First of all, I never said anything that derides Advaita. Why would I? As a path towards Advaita Siddhi, I consider jnana yoga to be a valid and direct path forthose who are qualified.I consider bhakti yoga to be the desirable, easy and fast path for every one. I dont have the reference handy but the Lord says in SBh that a materialist is in ignorance,dualist is in the mode of rajas, a non-dualist (follower of jnana yoga)in the mode of sattva and bhakta is beyond the three modes. I have to disagree with you that a bhakta is in darkness. SBh itself says that it is relished by highest scholars. 

In the link below, you can change the number to look up the canto. Shri Jaldhar mentioned in a postthat Sridhara refers to Citsukha's commentary though I have not personally verified it.
