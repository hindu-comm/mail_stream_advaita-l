RV: A pure bhakta rejects all types mukti including ekatva. It does not
mean that he is bound by trigunas. The next verse clearly says that he
transcends the trigunas and attains the same bhAva as Vishnu.

RV:  The desire for mukti is based on ignorance that I am bound. One who
knows that bondage and liberation are not real cannot desire for
liberation. A pure bhakta, who does not desire liberation and is
spontaneously engage in acts of devotion without expectation of results, is
a true jnAni not one who desires freedom out of fear of the trials and
tirbulations of the world. Even though he does not desire liberation
including ekatva, he attains Vishnu bhAvA as confirmed in the next verse.
This is advaita siddhi as per Sridhara.
