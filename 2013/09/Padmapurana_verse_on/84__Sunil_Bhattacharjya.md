UNQUOTE

SKB :The subsequent two verses only confirm what I wrote. I did not say that Bhakti goes waste. What I said is that those with pure bhakti don't get any type of Mukti, as bhakti incapacitates them to desire Mukti. They may be able to deal with the three gunas better, but they cannot be nistraigunya as long they cherish bhakti alone. They can be happy in their state as long as they remain devoted to the Lord but the Mukti is not for them. 

The Advaita is for the Mukti and that too the highest or the ultimate type of Mukti, the Ekatva. Thus there is a paradigm difference between the Bhakti marga and the Jnana marga and it is sheer irrationality to compare Advata with Non-Advaita.

RV: In Buddhism, there is no real entity. In Advaita, there is an entity but it does not evenknow I exist. Essentially, there is no difference between the two. Hence it is called covered Buddhism. Advaita negates the world, jiva and Ishwara calling it all an illusion or mayathat exists so far as there is ignorance. Hence it is called Mayavadam. It is said to be asat sastram (untrue reading of sastras) because vaishnavas believe that there is a real world and consequently a real creator with who we have a relationship. It also talksabout giving up all karma, where as vaishnavas believe that devotional activities should not be given up even by a sannyasi. Sridhara and Madhusudana defend Advaita against the onslaught of bhakti tradition by integrating bhakti and advaita. But they are not accepted by mainstream it seems.

On the other hand there is noliberation for the Vaishnavas as the Bhagavatam clearly states thatthe pure devotees do not want to get liberated at the cost of serviceto the Lord and therefore they do not accept any type of liberation.The relevant verse is as follows:
