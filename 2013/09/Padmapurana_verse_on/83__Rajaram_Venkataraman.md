RV: In Buddhism, there is no real entity. In Advaita, there is an entity
but it does not even know I exist. Essentially, there is no difference
between the two. Hence it is called covered Buddhism. Advaita negates the
world, jiva and Ishwara calling it all an illusion or maya that exists so
far as there is ignorance. Hence it is called Mayavadam. It is said to be
asat sastram (untrue reading of sastras) because vaishnavas believe that
there is a real world and consequently a real creator with who we have a
relationship. It also talks about giving up all karma, where as vaishnavas
believe that devotional activities should not be given up even by a
sannyasi. Sridhara and Madhusudana defend Advaita against the onslaught of
bhakti tradition by integrating bhakti and advaita. But they are not
accepted by mainstream it seems.
