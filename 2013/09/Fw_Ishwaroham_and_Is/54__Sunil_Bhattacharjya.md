Yes Sadanandaji, Namaste,


After declining Arjuna's request for repetition of the Bhagavad Gita and ciding Arjuna for forgetting what the Lord told him in the Bhagavad Gita the Lord agreed to arrange for another discourse for the benefit of Arjuna. The Bhagavad Gita was given by Bhagavan in his Yoga-yukta state and all this is given in the Mahabharata.

Regards,
Sunil KB

>Many persons think that a Paroksha Jnani will have to make all statements conforming to Paroksha-Jnana only. However that is not true. When Arjuna asked his sakha Lord Krishna to repeat the Bhagavad Gita a second time, the latter refused saying that he was in a yogayukta state (a different state) at that time. A Paroksha-jnani can make both Paroksha and Aparoksha statements, whereas an Aparoksha-Jnani can make only Aparoksha statements.
