Namaste,

///

Sri.Madhusudana Saraswathi by his remarks has answered the critics 
who said that Veda vyasa has not written vedanta in his Brahma sutras

//

So, should i conclude with the idea of Sri Madhusudana that:

1) vyAsa's brahma sUtra doesn't clearly define advaita ?

2) vyAsa couldn't explain the vEdAnta as perfectly as sankara ?

3) Was vyAsa was less intelligent as compared to sankara ?

4) was it an arthavAda prayOga towards the sankara's brilliant commentary on sUtra so much so that it has outwitted even the original sUtra of vyAsa ?

5) Sankara filled the gaps by writing commentary and explained the siddhAnta which vyAsa couldn't do so ?

Why, Madhusdana has to devalue the vEda vyAsa who happens to beone of the chief acharya of advaita parampara by making a sweeping remark that vyAsa couldn't explain
the siddhAnta properly in his sutra?

regs,
sriram
