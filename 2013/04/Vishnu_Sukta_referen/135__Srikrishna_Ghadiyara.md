Om!

I would like to know the actual Rig Veda references to the following mantras.

1. 2nd mantra - nishnO rarAtamasi . . . . 
2. 11th mantra - paryAptyA anantarAyAya . . . . 

11th mantra is referring to 'atirAtra' ritual. Is the 2nd mantra also referring to the same 'atirAtra' ritual?

Do you know any references/commentaries/notes where Vishnu Suktam is interpreted as Kundalini/Chakra sadhana, which I find alluded to in the writings of Sri Konduru Veeraraghavacharya, as trivikrama - a jIva crossing anAhata, ViSuddhi, and Aj~nA chakras to know that he is indeed Brahma.

Om!

Srikrishna
