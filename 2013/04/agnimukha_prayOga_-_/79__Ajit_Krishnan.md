One observation -- On the Apastamba gRhya sUtra "uttareNAgnim ... dvandvam
nya~nchi pAtrAni prayunakti devasaMyuktAni", the akAkulA commentary says
the following:

"sarvAni ca dravyANi prayojanavanti pAtragrahaNena gRhyante | tena
upanayanAdau mekhalAdiinAm api sAdanam bhavati ||"


> In short only vicchinnagni-sandhaanam will use catuShpaatra


This is what I have seen in prayoga texts as well.

sasneham,
