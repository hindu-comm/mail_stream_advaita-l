but the dve, dve refers to the
fact that the six pAtras have to be placed inverted on the paatra saadhana
in groups of two - darvii-aajyasthaalii, prokShaNii-praNiitaa,
itradarvii-idhmam, west to east. It doesn't have anything to do with
catuShpaatra.

Thank you very much for your clarification on Apasthambha agnimukha 
prayOga prabhuji.  I've seen /done chatushpAtra prayOga by saying : teshu 
pAtrANi dvandvannyanchi, darvi, Ajya sthAli, prOkshaNa sruvAmiti.  In 
chatushpAtra prayOga pUrNa pAtra & idhma  will not be there. 
And jayAdi also omitted if we do the agnimukha with chatushpAtra prayOga. 
Instead of jayAdi, we do vyAhruti hOma, like bhUrannna maganaye 
pruthivyaicha mahatecha svAha, bhuvOvAyaventarikshAyacha mahatecha svAha, 
suvarAdityAcha divecha mahatecha svaha, bhurbhuvaHsuvaH chandramasecha 
nakshatrebhyaccha digbhyaccha mahatecha svAha etc. and then anAjnAjnAtAdi 
prayaschitta hOma etc. I have seen this practice of chatushpAtra prayOga 
which is more prevalent when we do the hOma-s at 'brAhmaNetara' places.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar

PS :  Sri Ajit Krishna prabhuji thanks for your mail also.
