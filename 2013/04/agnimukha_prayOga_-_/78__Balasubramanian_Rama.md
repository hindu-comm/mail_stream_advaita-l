Just in case there is some confusion, vicchinnagni sandhaanam is only done
before karmas which specfically require aupasanaagni, and not before other
kaamya homas such as gaNapati, etc. Additionally there is no jayaadi in
vicchinnaagni sandhaanam.

All comments I had in the mail before this apply to the aapastamba prayoga
only.
