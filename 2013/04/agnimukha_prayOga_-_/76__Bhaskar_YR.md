there is an extra step called lepa-kaaryam
which is performed after the samsraava-bhaaga.

praNAms Sri Ramakrishna prabhuji
Hare Krishna

Yes, I have seen & followed  this lepa kAryaM, is there specific reference 
for this prayOga in gruhya sUtra prabhuji??  I dont what exactly the 
significance of this lepa kArya, why we have to first keep one darbha 
aside out of bunch of darbha before offering it to the yajneshwara and 
point our index finger and then the remaining single darbha also to be 
offered to agni!!?? If there any specific purpose behind doing this kriya 
prabhuji??  Kindly clarify.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
