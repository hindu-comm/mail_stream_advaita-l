Om!

"Says j~nAnEshvara, even the unprecedented act of realization of the Supreme Spirit could be accomplished by the grace of Sri Guru nivrittinAtha."

What was the relationship of Sri j~nAnEshvara to his brother and Guru Sri nivrittinAtha? As those were of relatively close ages, how did Sri j~nAnEshvara get to accept Sri nivrittinAtha as his Guru? Was Sri nivrittinAtha already an accomplished yogi that Sri j~nAnEshvara accept him as Guru, and get spiritual guidance from him, in the sense of a Guru and sishya as we know today ? If Sri nivrittinAtha himself was an accomplished yogi, why is he not remembered so much in the religious history?

Are there any accounts of Sri nivrittinAtha's spiritual accomplishments?

Om!

Srikrishna
