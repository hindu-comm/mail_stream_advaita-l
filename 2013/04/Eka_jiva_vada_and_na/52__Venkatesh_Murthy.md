I am not trying to show hare horns are real. I am also saying they are
false only.I can imagine some horns for a hare in my mind and draw a
picture. If others are saying it is not a real thing I agree. I never want
to say hare horns are real. I never want others to approve my picture.

But others will say a hare without horns is real and hare with horns is
false. Because hare without horns is SEEN and hare without horns is
IMAGINED. To this GK VP 9-10 has said BOTH are unreal. BOTH IMAGINED and
SEEN things are unreal.
