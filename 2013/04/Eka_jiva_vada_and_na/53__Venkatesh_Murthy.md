Namaste

In GK VP 8 Adi Sankara has discussed चतुर्दन्तं गजमारूढं अष्टभुजमात्मानं.
The Purva Pakshi is saying we can see four tusk elephants and eight arms
person in dreams. The answer is this Apurva is Sthani Dharma. The dream
objects like four tusk elephants are also false. But in the same teaching
Gaudapada has said dream objects and waking objects are unreal only. There
is no difference.

If a person imagines a rabbit with horns or seeing a four tusk elephant in
a dream or he is seeing a table and chair in waking all these objects are
equally unreal. All seen and imagined objects in dream and waking are
unreal. Why some Advaitis are seeing difference between them?They are
saying waking object seen is Mithya. It is not Sat not Asat not both Sat
and Asat but Rabbit horns is not same. But they are contradicting with
Gaudapada.
