Namaste Sri Sadananda Sir

The question I had is exactly this. It was said in this group any thing
like a hare's horns is imaginary and it should be Asat. It cannot be seen
any where but imagined only. Any thing is experienced objective by all
persons like ordinary rabbit without horns is Vyavaharika. It is Mithya.
Every person can see a rabbit without horns running here and there. It is
Vyavaharika and Mithya.

In Gaudapada Karika VP 8 the Bhashya of Adi Sankara has given a Purva
Pakshi argument. He says in a dream we can see a four tusk elephant and
eight armed person. Kindly observe he is saying the four tusk elephant is
not imagined in a dream but seen in a dream. It is actually seen. But in
waking we cannot see a four tusk elephant. We have to only imagine it in
waking.

Important point is Gaudapada has said all these objects like four tusk
elephant or normal objects in waking are not different. They are false
only.

Two points are made -
स्वप्नजागरितस्थाने ह्येकमाहुर्मनीषिणः । GK VP 5
The dream state and waking are same.

उभयोरपि वैतथ्यं भेदानां स्थानयोर्यदि ।
क एतान्बुध्यते भेदान्को वै तेषां विकल्पकः ॥ GK VP 11
All objects in both waking and dream are false. We cannot say there is
difference between objects in these two. It is wrong to say there is a
difference.

You are saying there is objective reality because a rabbit without horns is
seen by all persons and rabbit with horns may be imagined by one. But in
Eka Jeeva Vada where are other persons? There is only one. What one person
is seeing and what he is imagining are both false. IMAGINED object = SEEN
object = False. End of story.

You are talking three things. First is Sat, then Mithya as objective
reality, and Asat the imaginary thing.

I am talking two things only. Sat and Asat. Mithya is not needed for
explanation in Eka Jeeva Vada.

It is a simpler explanation and easy to understand. If we use Mithya there
is confusion because how can you be sure of objective reality? WHat is
objective reality? IF I see a rabbit without horns and 100 people are
seeing it? If 10000 people have to see it? All people in world have to see
it? There may be some people have not seen rabbit before. They will think
it is some other animal. All people will not come to same conclusion. We
cannot define this strange thing objective reality. This is the conclusion.
We have to stop searching for objective reality and accept it is not there.
