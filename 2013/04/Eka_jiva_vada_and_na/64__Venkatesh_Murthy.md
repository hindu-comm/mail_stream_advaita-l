Namaste

Kindly read the Gaudapada Karika Vaitathya Prakarana 9-10 again and again.
In a dream you are walking on a road and thinking of 100 Kg gold. You meet
a person on the road and say Namaste to him. Then you wake up. You will
conclude both the Gold and the person are dream objects. Both are unreal.
You cannot say imagined Gold is unreal but the seen person is real. Same
way in waking Avastha also when you imagine something like 100 Kg Gold it
is unreal. When you meet a friend in waking also, he is not real. Like this
all persons are unreal. Imagined and seen objects in waking and dream both
are unreal.

What Nana Jeevas you see in Vyavahara are unreal because they are like
dream objects. The waking is also a dream. The dreamer is the only One
Jeeva. Eka Jeeva Vada is only for Vyavaharic level. You have to think
Vyavaharically like this is all my dream and I have created the Universe.
The Universe is there because I see it. This Drishti Srishti Vada. I see
the Universe because it is existing. This is Srishti Drishti Vada. This is
a road to misery and bondage. Drishti Srishti Vada and Eka Jeeva Vada are
the best methods of Vedanta. Gaudapada is saying this.
