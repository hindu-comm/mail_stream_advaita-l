I am unable to make out what exactly the correspondent is trying to say
here.  It is wrong to say traditionalists discard the mandukya and
vivekachudamani.  If he is looking for the popular advaitic view of the
illusoriness of the world from a source other than the two cited works,
here is one:

In the brahmasutra bhashyam 3.2.1.4 (on the nature of dreams) Shankara says:

na cha viyadAdisargasyaapi Atyantikam satyatvamasti.  pratipaditam hi
'tadananyatvam...' BSB 2.1.14 ityatra samastasya prapanchasya
mAyAmAtratvam.  .....

//And yet the creation of space, etc. also has no absolute reality; for
under the aphorism...2.1.14 we showed that the whole creation is but mAyA.
But before the realization of the identity of the self with Brahman,
creation counting from space, etc. continues just as it is, whereas the
creation within dream is abrogated every day.  Hence the statement that
dream is merely mAyA has  a special significance.//

In another (upanishad) (reference not immediately available) bhashyam
Shankara says, ..// the upanishad itself thinks that the waking is
non-different from the dream state...//

This view of the correspondent:  // Living connected, a jīvan mukta acts
"lokasaṁgrahamevārthaṁ sampaśyan kartum arhasi."//  on the nature of
kaivalya is not admissible in Vedanta.  The jivanmukta operates in the
world as long as the body lasts.  Upon the dissolution of the body there is
no entity left to be identified as a jivan/mukta.  There is no duality then
whatsoever.  That is the meaning of kaivalya: kevalasya bhAvaH.
