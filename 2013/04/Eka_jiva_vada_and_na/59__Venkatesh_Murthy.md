Namaste

You said -
what is never experienced is asat - and therefore your example as it is
relatively
real is neither sat nor asat - hence mithyaa.

But I can ask one important question. Where is the example taking place? It
is in waking or dream state only. Because in Sushupti sleep there are no
object like a table. If I am seeing a table and other people are seeing it
is my waking state or my dream state only. If I and other people are seeing
it in my dream we think in the dream it is real. But after the dream is
ended I will wake up and I will say the table in the dream  is false.

In that same dream I see a four tusk elephant and one person with eight
arms I will wake up and say it is false. In that same dream if I imagine a
hare's horns I will wake up and say it is false.

Your argument -

If I see a table in waking it is experienced but if I imagine a hare's
horns it is not experienced.

What is the difference between objective reality table and hare's horns?
The table is experienced but the hare's horns is imagined. Hare's horns
cannot be experienced. The table is Mithya. It is not Sat not Asat. But
hare's horns is Asat. This is your argument.

 But kindly see Gaudapada saying -
स्वप्नवृत्तावपि त्वन्तचेतसा कल्पितं त्वसत् ।
बहिश्चेतोगृहीतं सद् दृष्टं वैतथ्यमेतयोः ॥ GK VP 9
'Even in a dream what is imagined by the mind is unreal while anything
experienced by the mind outside is real. But both these are seen to be
unreal.'

When I wake up I know both IMAGINED and EXPERIENCED are unreal. They are
equally unreal. I cannot say EXPERIENCED object table in dream is less
false than IMAGINED object hare's horns .

जाग्रद्वृत्तावपि त्वन्तचेतसा कल्पितं त्वसत् ।
बहिश्चेतोगृहीतं सद्युक्तं वैतथ्यमेतयोः ॥ GK VP 10
'Even in the waking state what is imagined by the mind is unreal while
anything experienced by the mind outside is real. But both these are seen
to be unreal.'

When I am in a dream both IMAGINED and EXPERIENCED objects of waking are
not there. They are equally unreal. I cannot say EXPERIENCED object in
waking is more real than IMAGINED object.

Gaudapada also said - स्वप्नजागरितस्थाने ह्येकमाहुर्मनीषिणः ।  The wise
people say Dream and Waking state are One.

Final Conclusion is IMAGINED object in dream = EXPERIENCED object in dream
= IMAGINED object in waking = EXPERIENCED object in dream = FALSE = Asat.
Example - IMAGINED hare's horns in dream = EXPERIENCED table in dream =
IMAGINED hare's horns in waking = EXPERIENCED table in waking = FALSE =
Asat.

WHY? Because IMAGINED and EXPERIENCED objects are produced by the MIND. The
imagined object is in the mind. But the experienced object is not outside
but in  the mind only. Mind is the internal organ. Not Atma. Mind is
unreal. From unreal Mind we get unreal objects only.

Tell me where is the Not Sat Not Asat Not both Sat and Asat thing? A Mithya
thing is not there anywhere.
