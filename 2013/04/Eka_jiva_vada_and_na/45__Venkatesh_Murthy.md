That One embodied soul is a pupil. He imagines the whole Universe as his
dream. He has created all the 7 billion people in the world in his dream,
He has created God, Guru and Vedanta also in his dream. He has to go to the
dream Guru and ask him for instructions. The dream Guru will instruct him
with Vedanta. This Vedanta instruction is also happening in his dream. But
with Vedanta Knowledge the Pupil will wake up from his dream. It is like a
tiger in a dream causing waking you up sweating and like a dream lady to
cause wet dream. The false thing can have real effect.

If the embodied soul becomes Guru also there is no problem. He will teach
others in his dream like how he eats food and other activities. In the
dream he is eating food sometimes and doing so many activities. Teaching
others is one more activity.

Wrong. Many people have got instructed in dreams. Some people dream God
comes in dream and gives instruction.  Even though Guru is dream person he
has capacity to instruct the Pupil.  The Madhva says God is creator of even
dream things. Why he is objecting to dream Guru? People can learn in dreams.
Scientifically also dream learning is proved. Kindly see -

Only others in the dream are unreal. But the dreamer is never unreal.
Nobody can have a doubt like 'Am I real or unreal?' even though he is
dreaming. I will say always I am always real even in my dream. I am always
Brahma.  When I am Pupil I am real. When I am Guru also I am real only.
Only I am real. You and all other people in the world are my dream
creations. You are not real.
