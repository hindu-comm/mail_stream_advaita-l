Advaita never denies ishwara at the vyAvahArika level; Jivas &  Ishwara are
part and parcel of the vyAvahArika prapancha. The following sUtra & bhAshya

creator of the world*, on account of 'the declaration of difference..."



//Bhakti refers to the relationship of the jīva with īśvara.//

the anugraha of Ishwara.
