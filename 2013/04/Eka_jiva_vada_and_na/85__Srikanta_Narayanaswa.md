Namaste Srikanta Sir
You are misunderstanding GK VP 7 and 8. The Purva Pakshi is saying in 7
there is a Prayojana of objects in waking. But Adi Sankara Bhashya on that
is saying 'Yasmadya Saprayojanta Drusta Annapanadinam Sa Svapne
Vipratipadyate'. The utility of waking objects is contradicted in dreams.
'Ato Manyamahe Teshamapyasattvam Svapnadrushyavad Anashankaniyam Iti' There
is no doubt the waking objects are also unreal like dream objects.

The Purva Pakshi is now bringing one more objection. He is saying in dream
there are some Apurva objects in dream like four tusk elephant and eight
arms body. The Apurva object is a special object but not seen in waking.
But Adi Sankara is saying the Apurva is only Sthani Dharma.The Apurva is
because of dream quality. But this Sthani Dharma is also Mithya only. It is
not real.He is making one statement. 'Tasmad Yatha Stanidharmanam Rajju
Sarpa Mruga Trushnikadinam Asattvam Tatha Svapnadrushyanam Api Apurvanam
Sthanidharmatvam Eva Iti Asattvam.

Adi Sankara is saying Sthani Dharma is false like a Rajju Sarpa rope snake
and mirage. The Apurva dream object is also false because it is from Sthani
Dharma.

Your two points are Saprayojanata in waking and Sthani Dharma. But both of
these things are false only. Finally there is no difference between waking
and dream.

If a rich man has all desired objects he may not have a good dream at
night. He may have bad dreams. Why? Because the utility of his waking
objects is not there in the dream. They cannot help him. He may have 1000
security guards. But if he is attacked in dream by armed robber the
security guards cannot save him. This is showing the utility of waking
objects is nothing. It is false.

Dear Sri Venkatesha Murthy,
The waking state objects are real,because they are used for some practical purpose.The dream objects are unreal like those of the waking state objects.The comparison between the two is based on "Nyaya"logic,like syllogism.The waking state objects can be said to be unreal only from the "Turiya"state.>From common daily experience they are real.The only point that is brought here by Gaudapada is that the waking state objects are unreal because they are seen,and they are mutually contradicted in the dream state.Other wise,they are real and used for some practical purpose.The "sthani dharma"in the two states also differ.The waking state has the "Vaishvanara"who is "sthula bhuk"and hence the objects are gross(sthula).In the dream state,it has the "Taijasa"which is "sukshma",there fore the experiences also differ.They are experienced by the mind.
N.Srikanta.
