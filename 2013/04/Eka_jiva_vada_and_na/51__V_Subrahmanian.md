There is the description of Narasimha in the purana.  We know what a lion
looks like and to connect it with a human body is not difficult keeping in
mind the description.  But the case of hare's horn is different.  What horn
will you put on the hare's head?  We know only certain kinds of horns.
There is no description of a hare's horn in any literature that can be
relied upon unlike the Narasimha description of the purana.  If you draw a
picture of a hare's horn, only you will have to call it so; no one else
will approve it.  The case is not so with Narasimha's picture.
