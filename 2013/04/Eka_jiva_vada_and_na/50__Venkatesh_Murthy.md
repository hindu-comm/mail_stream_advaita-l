Namaste

Who has seen Half Man Half Lion? But we can imagine Narasimha Avatara.
Someone has made a Narasimha statue or picture. We can see it and imagine.
We can offer prayers to Narasimha. Mathematics genius Ramanujan was
dreaming Narasimha was coming and giving him all the Maths formulas.

For Rabbit Horns also I can imagine some Rabbit with Horns in my mind. I
cannot see it outside the mind. But it is there in my mind. It is unreal. I
can draw a hare horns picture. If I want I can build a statue also. I can
see a Rabbit without horns running in the garden in waking and dream. There
is no difference between the Rabbit with horns in my mind and Rabbit
without horns. Both are unreal. There is no difference between imagined
objects and seen objects. Gaudapada has said this.

To confuse the opponents some people have said seen objects are Mithya but
Anirvachaniya. It is not real not false. They have also brought Bhava Rupa
Avidya. This is making Advaita like Dvaita. Because there is Brahma. There
is Bhava Rupa Avidya. There are two things.This is for confusing opponents
only. But Advaitis should study only pure Eka Jeeva Vada and Drishti
Srishti Vada.

In Drishti Srishti Vada the Rabbit without horn is there because I am
seeing it. The Rabbit with horns is also there in my mind because I am
imagining it. There is no difference between imagining and seeing. Both
will show only unreal objects.
