If this world does not exist, then the why do we experience it? As long as
we live, we will experience the world. If this world does exist, then
according to Lord Krishna, it cannot cease to be. However, we know that it
goes through creation and destruction. Hence, what Lord Krishna says
contradicts our direct perception.  You can say that my direct perception
is due to my ajnana. If my ajnana exists, it cannot cease to be. If it does
not exist, then we are back to the original question. Why do I have direct
perception of jagat? :)
