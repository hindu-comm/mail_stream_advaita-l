RV:  Does the object ring - not its substratum - have non-existence or
temporary existence? It has absolute non-existence (atyantAbhAvA) because
what was not there and will not be there cannot be not there as it will
imply change to changeless Brahman to create the object ring. However, we
need to explain experience of the non-existent ring. Now, we not only
experience existence of ring. We experience names and forms of ring, neck
lace, bangles etc. If the knowledge of ring etc. is not pre-existent in
Brahman, this variety cannot be experienced. This knowledge cannot be a
quality of Brahman as that would make Brahman ignorant. This knowledge
cannot also be said to be a superimposition on Brahman as that would leave
the original question unanswered, "How do we we superimpose names and forms
of ring, bangle etc. on gold and ultimately Brahman?" Madhusudana takes
this point up and answers by saying that knowledge is neither an attribute
nor a superimposition but is essential nature of Brahman.  Brahman does
not have specific knowledge of each object. It has undifferentiated
knowledge. For example, mind is thoughtless by nature but can create
thoughts of ring, bangle etc.

RV: We cannot make illogical statements in the name of scripture. Then the
scriptures will have the defect of being the cause of logical fallacies.
Though scriptural statements are not logically deduced, they cannot
be logically inconsistent. anAdi karma cannot be the answer to "Why do we
experience ring etc.?" because karma is possible only when when there is
jagat and jiva, which is possible only when there is maya. There is no
problem when you say maya is anirvachaniya but when you say it is anrtam,
it is because it leaves the question "How do I experience a non-existence
world?" unanswered.
