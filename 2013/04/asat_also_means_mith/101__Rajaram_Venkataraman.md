RV: The logical contradiction is resolved by stating that maya is
anirvachaniya. How is the loss of maya relevant to te iscussion?

RV: What do you mean by apparent existence? An object can exist or not. It
can appear to exist or not. A ring does not exist but appears to exist. We
dont need to be brahma jnanis to know that ring does not exist but appears
to exist. And that it is a perception of reality - whether we call it
shunya or prakrti or brahman or atoms. Again, what do you mean by apparent
experience? This experience of a ring is real whether you are a jnani or
ajnani. The emotions attached to a ring may differ based on how we
conditioned the mind but a ring does not appear to be a pot. It s only
in vyavahara, we talk about ring and its perception as well as negation
through inference (or sastras). I don't see where I shifted point of view.
