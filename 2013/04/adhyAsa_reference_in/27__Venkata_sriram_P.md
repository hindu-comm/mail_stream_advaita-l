Namaste,

This is from adhyAtma rAmAyaNa where bhagavAn srIrAmachandra defines *adhyAsa* as:

vikalpa mAyArahitE chidAtmakE *ahaMkAra* Esha prathamaH prakalpitaH
*adhyAsa* EvAtmani sarvakAraNE nirAmayE brahmaNi kEvalE parE

The brahma vastu is free from all the vikalpAs and mAyA. It is of the form of *chit*.

The prathama-prakalpa in the form of *ahaM* which is superimposed on this vikalpa-rahita
brahma vastu is called *adhyAsa*. And all this tamAsha is being displayed by this ahaM only.

regs,
sriram
