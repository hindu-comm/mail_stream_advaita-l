There seems to be some confusion regarding the difference between the dream
experience and the waking experience. gaudapAda himself has differentiated
between these in the alAtashAnti prakaraNa.  bhAshyakArapAda's commentary
on these karikas are crisp and clear.

Relevant kArikAs:

87 Vedanta recognizes the ordinary state of waking, in which duality,
*consisting of objects and the idea of coming in contact with them, is
admitted*. It also recognizes a purer ordinary state i.e. the dream state,
in which is experienced duality consisting of objects and the idea of
coming in contact with them, *though such objects do not exist*.

88 The wise recognize another state, in which there exist neither objects
nor ideas regarding them. This state is beyond all empirical experiences.
They describe the three: knowledge, the objects of knowledge i.e. the three
states and the supremely knowable i.e. Ultimate Reality.

89 Having known knowledge and the threefold knowable, one after another,
the knower, endowed with supreme intellect, attains in this very life and
everywhere, the state of omniscience.
