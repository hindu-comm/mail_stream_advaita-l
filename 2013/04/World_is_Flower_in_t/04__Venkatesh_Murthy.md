Namaste

Recently members said world is Mithya but not like a fictional thing.
I said there is no difference between Mithya and fictional thing like
flower in the sky. Both are in dream and both are false only.

In third  chapter Yoga Vasistha has said this -
http://hinduonline.co/DigitalLibrary/SmallBooks/YogaVasistaEng.pdf

It is an illusion as the phantom of a city in a dream,
and as untrue as the imagination of a flower growing in
the air.The unreality of the world best appears to one at
the point of and after his death.
