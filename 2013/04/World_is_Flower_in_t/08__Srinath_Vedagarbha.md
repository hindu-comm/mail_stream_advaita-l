This is correct as per Madhusudhana Sarswati in Advaitasiddhi.

In defense against dualist’s attack, he takes the position what is
termed as ‘svarUpENa-niShEdha’.

What Madhusudana is saying is that the mithyabhUta jagat is negated in
its very essence in all three period of time (trikAlika niShEda).
That is to say this jagat is asat in its essence ontologically
speaking.

So, does this mean -- ‘mithya’ is plain ‘asat’ only when one is
speaking from ontologically, and an ‘error’ when one is speaking from
epistemologically?

Does this mean when we are talking about vastu-tantra categories there
are only two categories ‘sat’ & ‘asat’, but third category of mithya
is only from purusha-tantra perspective?

It seems there is some meaning in dualist’s accusation that advaitic
‘mithya’ is another name for plain old asat and just a fig leaf
attempt to distance themselves from jagat shUnyavAdins?
