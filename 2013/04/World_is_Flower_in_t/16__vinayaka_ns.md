Indeed it is, not only that seeing this discussion a dvaitin is getting
exited too. I have got some 'enlightening'  mails from him.

This is in order. Both veda pUrva bhAga and vedAnta accept the plurality of
jivas in the vyAvahAric plane.

Ok.

This is where I don't follow your explanation. The aforementioned view
boils down to eka-Atma-vAda and it need not be taken as eka-jIva-vAda in
which it is said that there is *only one jIva in the vyAvahAric plane*  and
all other jIvas are just imaginations. I have no problems with the former
view; that is what advaita is all about.

A sAdhaka intuits the One consciousness underlying upAdhis of ishwara and
jIvas by the use of bhAga tyAga lakshaNA. I don't know why we should call
this eka-jIva-prakriyA and restrict the number of jIvas to only one.

jnAnis Consciousness is the sattAprada all right,  but then it doesn't mean
that there are no other jnAnis and ajnAnis at all.

This is fine. But then, we need not restrict the number of jIvas getting
into sushupti to only one. For ex. the Chandogya shruti says all sorts of
creatures like tiger, moth, mosquito etc., attain satsampatti.

Am I missing something? Pls clarify.
