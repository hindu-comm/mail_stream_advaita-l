But my confusions stems from the fact that in Kanchi Mutt, Adi Shankara Jayanthi is celebrated on thithi basis only whereas the Jayanthi of the Mutt's Acharya's seems to be celebrated based on Nakshatram.

Can members explain on this "disconnect" in basis?

Vijay

I also believe that this is consistent with celebration of Adi Shankaracharya which is the Panchami Thithi in Vaikasi and Nakshatra is not relevant. For example this year Shankara Jayanthi falls on 15th May which is Panchami.

Here is my reply to Sri.R.Krishnamurthy:

// Birthdays go by nakshathram.Death days are governed by thithi.This is the usage for Hindus.R.Krishnamoorthy. //


Maybe this is followed by Tamil smarthas. As far as I know thithi is 
followed for birthdays too by non-Tamils. The Sringeri Acharya's 
vardhanti is on ShaShThI thithi.  

With Srivaishnavas it is 'tirunakShatram'. See this also:
