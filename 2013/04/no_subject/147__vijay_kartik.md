Dear members,

I get confused when I note the pattern of celebrating Sanyasin's birthday- be it called Vardhanthi or Jayanthi etc.

I am used to celebrating my birthday on the day when the same Nakshatra occurs in the almanac.


I know that Sringeri Acharya's birthday is reckoned as the day on which the same Thithi occurs. I also believe that this is consistent with celebration of Adi Shankaracharya which is the Panchami Thithi in Vaikasi and Nakshatra is not relevant. For example this year Shankara Jayanthi falls on 15th May which is Panchami.

However in case of Kanchi Mutt , Sri Mahaperiyava's Jayanthi seems to be always celebrated on Anusha Nakshatra day and thithi does not appear to be followed.

Can members clarify the basis for either practice?

Vijay
