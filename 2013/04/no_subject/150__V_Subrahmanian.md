Here is my reply to Sri.R.Krishnamurthy:

// Birthdays go by nakshathram.Death days are governed by thithi.This is
the usage for Hindus.R.Krishnamoorthy. //

Maybe this is followed by Tamil smarthas.  As far as I know thithi is
followed for birthdays too by non-Tamils.  The Sringeri Acharya's vardhanti
is on ShaShThI thithi.

With Srivaishnavas it is 'tirunakShatram'.  See this also:
