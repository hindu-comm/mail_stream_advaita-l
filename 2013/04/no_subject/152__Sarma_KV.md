Where chAndramAna almanac is followed, tithi is considered for most
purposes.
This is the case in Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka and officially by Sringeri
peetham.
Where sauramAna almanac is followed (Tamilnadu, Kerala etc.) nakshatram is
considered.

Other than this any further thoughts about "disconnect" is unending,
useless & academic in nature - no use getting into it.
