namaste,

The convention in Tamilnadu is as follows:

for human beings: use nakShatra for birth days andtithi for death days (shrAddha-s)
for avatAra-s: use tithi for birth days (e.g. rAma-navami, kRShnajanma-aShtami etc)

Since Adi shaMkara is considered an avaTAra, His jayanti is celebrated as per tithi.

Aniruddhan

But my confusions stems from the fact that in Kanchi Mutt, Adi Shankara Jayanthi is celebrated on thithi basis only whereas the Jayanthi of the Mutt's Acharya's seems to be celebrated based on Nakshatram.

Can members explain on this "disconnect" in basis?
