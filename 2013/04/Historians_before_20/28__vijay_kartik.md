 Dear members,

I request your inputs regarding references of books on Indian History, Religion, Society, Indology which were written by impartial scholars before the beginning of the 20th century.
Due to certain controversies , the accounts even of scholars from 20th century were not unbiased in most cases,according to my opinion. 
I am trying to see the "history" as it was believed in public domain before 20th century.
One scholar at least whom I think will fit in this category is Monier Williams, both in terms of his scholarship and objectivity.
Can members give other references of scholars and their works- Indian or otherwise?
Thanks 

Vijay
