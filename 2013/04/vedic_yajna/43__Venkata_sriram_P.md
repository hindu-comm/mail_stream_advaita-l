Namaste,

Nice to learn that you have put bhagavannAma to your son. "mAdhava" a very sweet name indeed !!

The nAmakaraNa should be done on the 11th day after the birth. 

"dashamyA utthitAyAg snAtAyAM putrasya nAma dadAti pitAmAtEti" says the grihya sutra. 

The name thus fixed on the 11th day gives *Ayu vriddhi* to the son because with the nAmakaraNa, one should invoke the Agni onto the newly born son for his longevity. Thus, the devata becomesthe friend "mitra" to the parents (nAmnA chE dvayEtE mitraM Eva bhavataH). 

Also, request you to perform the upanayana of your son at the right age of 8 and impart vedic education first. 

tvaM jIvaH sharadaH shataM...
