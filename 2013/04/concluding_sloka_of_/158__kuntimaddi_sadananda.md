PraNAms
Actually the Brahmasuutras are by
Badarayana - the second chapter dismisses the Buddhist doctrines. Traditionally
our achaaryas have equated Badarayana with Veda Vyaasa. Apparently there were
several suutras before Badarayana suutras but many got last after Badarayana
suutras became prominent.I donot think authorship is different for the first four suutras compared to that of the rest of the suutras. Hari Om!
