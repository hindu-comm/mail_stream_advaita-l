It happens both ways: mantropadesha upon asking for it and the Guru
bestowing it of his own accord.  [There is an instance where a person
received mantropadesha without longing for it, in dream, and later got it
confirmed from the Acharya].  Both are good as the deekShA mantra when
properly chanted will give great benefits; chitta shuddhi being the primary
one.

There are cases where when the Guru hears about the problems faced by the
disciple/devotee, bestows a mantra for getting relief from the particular
problem.
