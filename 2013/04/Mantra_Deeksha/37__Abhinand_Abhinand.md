Namaste friends,
I have 2 specific queries & I would request learned members in the group to reply to this queries:-

1) Is it good to ask for Mantropadesha/Deeksha from a Guru OR is it good
 if the Guru himself shows Karuna (or wait for this Guru) & gives us deeksha without we even
 asking for it?

2) Is it right to get initiated into a mantra, when our mind is worried 
about some particular thing & is unwilling to relieve from the 
tension for sometime?

Thanks
Abhinand
