The JAbAlopaniShat says 'yadahareva virajet tadahareva pravrajet, gRhAdvA
vanAdvA, yadi vA brahmacharyAdeva pravrajet.'  Upon acquiring teevra
vairAgyam one should renounce, either from householder's stage or from the
vAnaprastha stage or even from brahmacharya aashrama.  Shankara has, in the
Br.Up. bhashyam commented for the mantras that teach: those brAhmaNa-s
endowed with vairAgyam, even before entering the householder's stage, take
to renunciation, reasoning: We have known the Self and That is everything
for us. What need is there for us by endeavoring to beget children?

In the BGB 2.72 He says:

स्थित्वा अस्यां स्थितौ ब्राह्म्यां यथोक्तायां अन्तकालेऽपि अन्त्ये वयस्यपि
ब्रह्मनिर्वाणं ब्रह्मनिर्वृतिं मोक्षम् ऋच्छति गच्छति। किमु वक्तव्यं
ब्रह्मचर्यादेव संन्यस्य यावज्जीवं यो ब्रह्मण्येव अवतिष्ठते स
ब्रह्मनिर्वाणमृच्छति इति।
//2.72 O Partha, esa, this, the aforesaid; is brahmisthitih, the state of
being established in Brahman, i.e. continuing (in life) in identification
with Brahman, after renouncing all actions.Na vimuhyati, one does not
become deluded; prapya, after attaining ; enam, this Rcchati, one attains;
brahma-nirvanam, identification with Brahman, Liberation; sthitva, by being
established; asyam, in this, in the state of Brahman-hood as described;
api, even; anta-kale, in the closing years of one's life. What need it be
said that, one who remains established only in Brahman during the whole
life, after having espoused monasticism even from the stage of celibacy,
attains identification with Brahman! //

I do not think Shankara was saying something that was not in practice
during His times.
