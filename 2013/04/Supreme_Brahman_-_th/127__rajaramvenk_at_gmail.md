Hari is the Self of all. However, we don't see Him as such but as God or not at all as we are deluded by maya. However, gopis see Him as the Self as they are jnanis. We see His qualities as material (prakrtam) but gopis see it as aprakrtam. As atmaramas, they relish in these qualities which has an un-obstructed  reflection of pure consciousness and hence bliss itself. They don't relish material qualities which are perishable but relish in His transcendental qualities, which are eternal. In material names and forms, there is an obstruction of bliss due to rajas and tamas.

Hari, presumably is the Self of everybody, not just gopis.
Anybody who achieves Self-Realization achieves Hari-Realization ipso facto.
So it cannot be a multi-stage process for anybody.

Attraction to transcendental qualities of Hari, by its own momentum may give realization
of Hari who has transcended all qualities, unless you refuse that Hari cannot transcend all
qualities.
