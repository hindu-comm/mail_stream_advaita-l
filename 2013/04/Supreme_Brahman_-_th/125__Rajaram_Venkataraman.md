As to whether gopis attained Atmasakshatkara or Paramatmasakshatkara, we
have to first understand that there can be no jnani who is not a bhakta.
Lord Krishna calls jnani as one of the types of bhaktas in BhG 7.
Vidyaranya defines jnani as a Hari Bhakta. Madhusudana says in his very
introduction to the gita and also 18.66 that bhakti is essential for karma
and jnana. In his introduction to BhG, he says that an atmarama is
attracted to the transcendental qualities of Hari, who is their very Self.
He classifies the gopis as the highest types of jnanis. He admits Janaka, a
jijnanusu, attains jnana but gopis dont even aspire for jnana but are
jnanis by definition due to their selfless love for Krishna, who is their
necklace!  As Hari is their very Self, for gopis atmasakshatkaram and
paramatmasaksharam are non-different. These two realisations will be
different only for one who in the first two stages of devotion "I am His"
or "He is Mine" but not for gopis who are in the state of "I am He".
