Shree Rajaram - PraNAms

nirupaadika
brahman or turiiyam in mantra 7 of Mandukya is the same as
satyam-jnaanam-anantam Braham - even the words- satyam-jnaanam-anantam is only
from the reference of vyaavahaarika only - as Mandukya matra 7 says
-avyavahaaryam, agraahyam, advaitam, prapancopashamam etc. all descriptions
which cannot be described - for helping a saadhak to shift the mind to grasp
the essence using viveka - and is only called fourth - chaturtam manyante - in
relation to the three states. Even so called parabrahman - is only from the
point of vyaavahaarika only.
You
statement - that starts with - this parabrahma appears ... Any appearance is
from vyavahaara point only and it involves upaadika not nirupaadika. Hence it
is same as Iswara with maayaa as upaadhi. There is only vyaavahaarika and
paaramaarthika - the latter being absolutely real and sat. While the former,
the vyaavahaarika involves as I said - Brahman + upaadhi - either at jiiva
level or Iswara level - anupravesha statement of the scriptures involves as
though entering into the upaadhi. avataara is brahman -as though- descending
taking an appropriate upaadhi to solve a local problem. Hence Krishna was
located and as son of Devaki. 
Personally I do not see any
problem in accounting the paaramaarthika and vyaavahaarika and if one include
the individual mental projections - praatibhaasika. 
In essence anything that has
property has finiteness associated with it. Nirguna brahman is pure
paaramaarthika only.
Hari Om!

>However, in this thread we are talking about nirupadhika brahman that Sankara and Madhusudana talk about in BhG 15 and BhG 8. Just as Gaudapada calls turiya as Ishwara, Sankara calls Him Ishanashila or Narayanana and Madhusudana calls it Vasusdeva. This is a state of un-differentiated knowledge or the state of Vishnu. This parabrahman appears as Krishna and without becoming anatma. He takes the qualities of anatma when He appears as jagat but not when He appears as Krishna. Any form is prakrta but His form is apraktram, paramayarupam and pure consciousness. This nitya suddha buddha mukta Krishna, the son of Devaki and Yasoda, is the garland of the gopis who are jnanis. Janaka attained jnana because of being a jijnasa whereas gopis started as jnanis by being totally selfless and spontaneous in their love for Krishna. Some contemporary advaita scholars, jnanis though they may be, don't recognise the position of gopis as did Madhusudana. They think
 gopis went to Brahmaloka as do normal sadhakas. There is a huge difference between worshipping Krishna as the Self and as non-Self. This para-bhakti, which is advayajnanam, is non-different from Him, who is all bliss, says Madhusudana.
