In 16.14, ishwara means the lord only. It is condemned as asuree bhava because it is a false thinking. In reality, he (e.g. Hiranyakasipu) doesn't think that there is ishwara (anisvaram, apratishtam - 16.8). This is very different from the upasana gopalaham referred to in gopala tapani upanishad. 

In 18.43 also ishwarabhava is used to refer to lordliness only. We can't forget that a kshatriya is considered Vishnu on earth. I'm afraid your thinking comes from the contingency of the use of Ishwara given in gaudapakarika, BhG 15 and BhG 8 with respect to nirupadhika brahman.

* *I just wanted to point out a non-God usage of the word Ishwara in the
Bhagavadgita itself:

dAnamIshvarabhAvashcha kShAtram karma svabhAvajam  18.43b

Here, the natural traits of a kShatriya is being taught.  One of these is:
IshvarabhAvaH which is commented upon by Shankara thus:

ईश्वरभावश्च ईश्वरस्य भावः, प्रभुशक्तिप्रकटीकरणम् ईशितव्यान् प्रति,...

//isvarabhavah, lordliness, manifesting (exercising) rulership over those
who have to be ruled. //
