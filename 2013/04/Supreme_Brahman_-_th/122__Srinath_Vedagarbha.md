That exactly I am saying too.

So, are you saying Gopi-s, who are in the third state of bhakti of
type "I am He" as Madhusudhana seems to hold, are having such false
thinking and hence having Asuree bhAva?

Why Madhusudhana supporting such false thinking as "highest bhakti"?
That would automatically make Madhusudhna himself having Asuree bhAva
even under your own position.
