Both these think I am one and the Lord is another. At the highest level, which gopis were in, they realise "I am He". Please note such a jnani is a type of devotee according to Lord Krishna (BhG 7) and the highest. It is fallacious to argue that bhakti needs duality.

Look at what SriKrishna says in 6.14 "IswarO aham aham bhOgee siddhO
aham balavAn sukhee"
Geetha, classifies a thought such as "I am God" under "Asuree"
svabhAva which is something to be given up like any other Asuree
thoughts.

>From Gita itself (incidentally on which Madhusudhana relies his
pramANa), all such thoughts and preaching makes Madhusudana is having
Asuree svabhAva.
