Shree Rajaram - PraNAms.

Just simply - the substantive of Iswara, jiiva and the jagat is the same as Brahman - since there cannot be anything different from Brahman, the infiniteness - by definition. Hence, is Iswara diffent from Brahman or same as Brahman? The samequestion again- Is ring different from gold or same as gold?

It is neither differnet or the same -bhinnapyabhinnaa ubhayaatmikaano.. says Vivekachudamani. Hence anirvacaniiya ruupa. 

Iswara as vishiShTa chaitanya with all the qualifications is Brahman - as though- reflected in the maaya upaadhi. Iswara is Brahman + his upaadhi just as Jiiva is Brahman + his upaadhi; upaadhis of Jiiva and Iswara are different. The equation, tat tvam asi, involves dropping all viruddha upaadhis (intellectually) and recognizing that there is only Brahman at the substantive level- the pure unqualified or unqualifyable consciousness - prajnaanam Brahmna. This dropping of viruddha visheShaNas is called bhaaga tyaaga lakshaNa - one can drop them because they are mithyaa. 
Is Iswaara mithyaa or styaa - Qualified Iswara is mithyaa - unqualified substantive consciousness is satya. The same applies to jiiva too; only the qualificaitions are different. I can drop the notion of a ring and say it is just gold. The attrributes or visheShanaas of ring and bangle are different but the substantive gold is the same without those attributes of ring and bangle. Ring = Gold + ring upaadhi; Bangle = Gold +bangle upaadhi. What is substantive entity is only gold - the rest is name for a form. The same applies to Iswara and jiiva with substantive for both being Brahman. 

It is just simple as that. 

Hari Om!
Sadananda
