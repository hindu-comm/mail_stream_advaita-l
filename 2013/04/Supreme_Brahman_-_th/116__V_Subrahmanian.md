* *I just wanted to point out a non-God usage of the word Ishwara in the
Bhagavadgita itself:

dAnamIshvarabhAvashcha kShAtram karma svabhAvajam  18.43b

Here, the natural traits of a kShatriya is being taught.  One of these is:
IshvarabhAvaH which is commented upon by Shankara thus:

ईश्वरभावश्च ईश्वरस्य भावः, प्रभुशक्तिप्रकटीकरणम् ईशितव्यान् प्रति,...

//isvarabhavah, lordliness, manifesting (exercising) rulership over those
who have to be ruled. //
