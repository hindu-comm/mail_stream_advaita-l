Namaste Srikanta Mahodaya

Kindly read the two Slokas GK VP here again and again and again and again
and again and again and again and again and again and again -

13 The Lord (Atman), with His mind turned outward, imagines in diverse
forms various objects either permanent, such as the earth, or impermanent,
such as lightning, which are already in His mind in the form of vasanas, or
desires. Again, He turns His mind within and imagines various ideas.

14 Those that are cognized internally only as long as the thought of them
lasts and those that are perceived outside and relate to two points in
time, are all mere objects of the imagination. There is no ground for
differentiating the one from the other.

Sloka 14 GK VP is here saying any idea in the mind and any outside object
are only IMAGINED. There is no difference between IDEA and OBJECT.

Very Important Equation by Gaudapada - IDEA = OBJECT same as OBJECT = IDEA

Any idea in your mind is unreal. Any object your eye is seeing. Both
are unreal.
Why? Because IDEA is imagined by mind. This mind is internal organ
Antahkarana. Any OBJECT is seen by external organ eye. Both internal organ
Antahkarana and external organ Jnanendriya can show only UNREAL things.
Why? Because both internal organ and external organ are UNREAL only. The
organs are not real. From UNREAL organ eye you can see unreal object only.
>From UNREAL organ mind you can imagine unreal object only.
