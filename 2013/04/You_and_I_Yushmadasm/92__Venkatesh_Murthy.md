Namaste

Adi Sankara is talking about Subject Asmat and Object Yushmat. In Advaita
whenever there is a Subject and Object the Object is False and Subject is
Real. For You and I the Subject is I and Object is You. I can say I see the
book. I see the table. I see the computer. Similarly I see You.

Book, Table, Computer and You are all the Objects I am seeing. Whenever
there is Subject and Object the Object is always False. The Conclusion is
the Book is False. The Table is False. The Computer is False. You are
False. Like this I can say all Persons in the world are False because I can
see them.

This is nothing but Eka Jeeva Vada. Adi Sankara has promoted it in the
First Sentence Sutra Bhashya.
