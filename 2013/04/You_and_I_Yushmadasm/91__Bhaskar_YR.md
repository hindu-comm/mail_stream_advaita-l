This Teaching is the Eka Jeeva Vada. This Adi Sankara is teaching in the
first sentence of Brahma Sutra Bhashya itself. I am alone in the Universe
and I have created all the You things in my dream.

praNAms 
Hare Krishna

Context here is not about eka-jeeva vAda..here shankara clarifying how 
superimposition can take place though there is a huge difference between 
vishaya & vishayi like light and darkness.  If you go through the adhyAsa 
bhAshya in detail, shankara addresses how in loka vyavahAra naturally 
adhyAsa can take place.

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
