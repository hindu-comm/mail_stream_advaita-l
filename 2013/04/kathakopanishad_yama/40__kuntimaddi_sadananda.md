Ajit - jnaani understands that he is never a kartaa, hence he does not incur either merits or sins. However he does follow the dharma - to set example for others who do not have the self-knmowledge and follow whatever shreShTa purusha does. Hence Yama was following the rules that were laid out in receiving a learned brahmin boy. 
Hari Om!
Sadananda
