I am looking for a sanskrit version of the kumArOpaniShad. I can see the
tamil version in the www.murugan.org website but I would prefer a Sanskrit
version for obvious. This upanishad is about 12 verses with each verse
ending with

OM haMsaH tasmai kumArAya namO astu |

This upanishad is used for namaskara behind the Kodi maram in Thiruchendur
temple every day at 5:45 am.

In addition, if any of the learned members shed some light on this
upanishad and its root and meaning, it would be helpful.

Thanks in advance,

Raghavan
