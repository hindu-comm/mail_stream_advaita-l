Namaskarams to all,



The eminent scholar Dr.Mani Dravid SastriNaH has kindly consented to
deliver lectures on the VedAnta paribhShA (a seminal work that facilitates
a proper understanding of the Advaita shAstra)  in Hindi for the benefit of
those who are familiar with that language.  The Advaita Academy that is
video-recording and web-casting the lectures has provided the following
URLs for enabling interested persons to hear the lectures.  The initial
lectures are available here:

Those interested in following the lectures may kindly let me know through

classes as and when they become ready.  As of now it is planned to record
one class of one hour duration each week.
