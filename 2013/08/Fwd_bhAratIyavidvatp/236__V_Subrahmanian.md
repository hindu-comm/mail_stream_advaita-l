Namaste,

Samskrita Bharati has a popular  correspondence based learning course that
spans over 2 years. This course is beautifully designed to cultivate
interest and increase the knowledge of Samskritam. It has adopted simple
ways of familiarizing students with the rich literature of Samskritam. For
example, verses/passages from Daily prayers, Ramayana, Gita, Raghuvamsha
 are taken to explain the grammar and provide opportunity to enjoy the
richness of these texts as well.

This course is in 4 levels, each of 6 months duration followed by an exam.
Exams are scheduled in August and February. Exams are of high quality and
certificate is issued to students which is well recognised. At the end of
this course, one will be able to read  texts like Bhagawadgita and Ramayana
in its original form with minimum support.

 Level 1 - Pravesha
Level 2 - Parichaya
Level 3 - Shikshaa
Level 4 - Kovida


In South Bangalore, contact classes happen at various places to help
