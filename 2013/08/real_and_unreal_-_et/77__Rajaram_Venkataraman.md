Hare Krishna. I would like to know (with references) the differences
between eternal - real, eternal - unreal and non-eternal unreal in advaita.
There are entities within vyavahara which are eternal and vyavahara itself
is eternal but considered unreal and would like to understand the logic
thereof and if it holds ground.
