That is good advice from your father and I'm glad you see the point. Perhaps,
people on this forum are not quite aware of other factors involved. There is a
strong tendency in India to cast a negative political spin on anything that is
related to the Sanskrit language and vaidika tradition as they pertain to society
at large. Consequently, there is an attempt to tar everybody with the same
brush and  genuine points where a discussion will be of benefit to the larger 
goals of the organization are apt to get misused to undermine it thoroughly. 
It would be better to reach out and discuss these issues in private with those
involved with their activities.
