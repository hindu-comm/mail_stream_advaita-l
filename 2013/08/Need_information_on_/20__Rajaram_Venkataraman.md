RV: What is the reason? As Vedas are sakshat Ishwara and chanting itself is
a great upasana, I thought it is highly desirable to learn Vedas more than
Sanskrit. The latter is no doubt important to learn especially to access
literatures that have not been translated properly or to understand the
explanations.
