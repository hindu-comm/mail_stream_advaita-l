It is the foremost duty of Maths of Adi Sankara to establish
Dharma also like him. If they teach only Sannyasa they are not following
Adi Sankara. They have to establish Vaidika Marga firmly and encourage
Sanskrit learning also

My grandfather used to say that the day would come when gurus have to learn from his disciples.  The disciples would dictate terms and conditions to Jagatguru and would dare enough to teaching the dharma sukshmas to Amnaya Muttadhipati.  

We are venturing out to teach vaidika mArga pratiSTApana and dharma shAstra to a Jagatguru who is the beacon light of sanAtana dharma and advaita siddhAnta !!!
