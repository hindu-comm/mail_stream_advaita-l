Do not forget that the veda is "guarded" by 6 vedangas, 4 upavedas, and 4 
vidyas.  They are the reason the it has survived in its purity for 
millenia.   In chhandogyopanishad 7.1 Narada tells Sanatkumara about all 
of the subjects he has learned and included amongst them is 'vedAnAMveda'
Shankaracharya remarks that it is vyAkaraNa (grammar) which is the 'Veda 
of the Vedas' because it is only through the proper knowledge of words and 
their meanings can the Veda be understood.  So do not look upon the choice 
between learning Veda and shastra as an either/or.  They are 
complementary.

This is a serious suggestion:  Consider moving.  I fully realize that in 
these terrible economic times it is not simple to do but if you are 
serious about maintaining a dharmic lifestyle one of the best things you 
can do is to live amongst other people who do.  They don't necessary have 
to be experts either in order to benefit from network effects.  For 
instance, I'm in Jersey City, NJ.  Although I could do better, the one 
thing that keeps me here is community.  I have five mandirs within walking 
distance.  25% of the population is Gujarati like me. Sanskrit books, puja 
articles, contact with learned people from India are all relatively easy 
to obtain.  And that makes a difference.

Btw, nothing I have said in this thread should be construed as being 
against the use of skype etc. _If_ that really is the only choice that 
works for you.  I'm just saying don't assume it is the only choice.

No no not Bhashyas.  I'm talking about English translations mainly.  Yes 
they can be useful.  I even provide them myself from time to time. But in 
the long run, you are better off spending some time upfront to be able to 
appreciate the original.  Many times, I have been asked questions such as 
"I want to study X, can you recommend a good translation?"  But even the 
best translators can face difficulties converting the concepts of one 
culture to another.  And unfortunately many translators are not so 
scrupulous.  So the poor person trying to find an easy way to read X now 
has to understand X and what somebody thinks X means.  Double the work!
