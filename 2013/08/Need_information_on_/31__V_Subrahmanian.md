I would like to point out that Samskritha Bharati is quite into promoting
traditional style studying of classical texts.  For instance, they conduct
a (mostly) annual shalAkA-parIkShA where the texts from different
disciplines are announced *a priori.*  At the appointed time, the
candidates are subjected to a thorough examination, in the Samskrita
medium, on these texts and assessed.  I witnessed one such event in
Bangalore at the Aksharam, Girinagar.  Candidates come from traditional
pAThashAla-s.  On that occasion, it was the tarka sangraha with a
particular commentary, the siddhanta kaumudi in parts and the Raghuvamsham
for the kAvya section.

In fact the Sringeri Matha has a separate body: the surasaraswati sabhA,
which conducts exams at various levels in Sanskrit language.  The Kanchi
maTha too has an institution for this purpose.  Many Madhva and
srivaishnava maThas too do their lot in this direction.

Vidwan S.T.Nagaraj who retired from the Sanskrit College, Bangalore, after
teaching VyakaraNa for decades has settled down in his native Somapura,
near Shimoga, Karnataka.  He has established a (Datta) gurukula where he
can take students who dedicate themselves for study of vyakarana/veda. As
suggested above one willing to spend time with him for a certain period
learning the fundamentals can approach him and I am sure he will be most
happy to take them for the initial grounding.   That way, there are other
scholars from other disciplines too who would be willing to endorse this
scheme/method/concept.
