Dear Dr. Bharadwaj,

Further to my previous mail in this thread I would like to draw your attention of yours as well as of the other scholars seized with the general level of understanding of Sanskrit among the new learners, on the use of the Sanskrit word "varsha". Generally the word "varsha" means a "downpour" or a "year". However in the Valmiki Ramayana it has been used to indicate a day. Lord Ram was mentioned as having ruled for 11,000 years, whereas he could have, in reality, ruled for 11,000 days only. In fact there is another instance in the Valmiki Ramayana, where the word Varasha has been usewd to indicate a day. 

Regards,
Sunil KB

Good. Sri Bharadwaj. Good.

I'd love to see a more complete list.

All the best Sir.


Dear Sri Ajit,

Thank you.

Am I right in understanding that you were hurt by my earlier reply to you,
Sir?? If so, I am terribly sorry. There is nothing to gain for me by
hurting a total stranger. The hurt, if any, was definitely untended. If I
am wrong in my understanding, not kindly ignore.

Pl let me explain if the terseness of my reply to you hurts you, Sir. I
chose not to respond fully to your earlier main because I perceived your
response as 'challenging' my opinion. I did not want to address the
challenge and disturb your rightful opinion.

I usually, esp in academic matters, avoid challenges, arguments and also
having to disturb and unsettle other's opinions and collar them, with the
force of eloquence, into mine..I usually just give my opinion as politely
as and as clearly as possible for people to choose to ignore it or make
whatever they like out of it. Yes, usually, because I do persist where it
matters to me, to my purpose.

Besides I was seen as opposing the Bharati as such. It is not true, I gave
appreciation where it is genuinely due, according to me, and opposed it
only in one specific area.

I tread with extra caution in scholarly Forum like this one.

Because of the query in your mail, I had included the Group in reply. You
said that you'd love to see a more complete list.
I understand, Sir. But please forgive me for refusing to. The list would be
too long and too old for and not so well motivated to do long typing. Also,
they might generate controversy as the expressions themselves are quite
'legal', 'grammatically correct' and questionable only if I share my some
insight.

But two more examples that comes to my mind are, the way they make
repeatedly 'overt' some of verbs (like asti, asmi etc.) which are 'implied'
for some good reasons, in prauDha saMskRtam. They do it in order to vibe on
par with the inevitable, unavoidable 'is', 'am' etc in the English language.

The second is their push for universalization of the usage of 'bhavan' (in
place of tvam) merely merely merely for convenience's sake. Bhavan is usued
for very special purposes in Sanskrit. Usage of tvam is more common and
recommended. There is not even a discussion on why tvam was preferred in
usage in the original!!

One more : they prefer to do away with the dual number in conversation.
They stick to, like the other languages, the singular and the plural usage.
There is whole of understanding of the truth of existence of the universe
in an unequivocal day to day, vyaavahaarik, acknowledgement of the
existence of a duality between the plurality and the singularity, which is
perceived so clearly by our culture that it is a part of our bhAShA.. We
cannot shoot down the diktats of millenia of cultural grounding to make our
hoary bhAShA suit the modern upshot dialects without match in their
cultural moorings with ours..We will not succeed, either!!

The bhAShA IS indeed our culture - saMskRti. We need to, *at least,* pause,
think, discuss and proceed with caution. The self-righteous rhetoric of an
effervescent reformist is not always as right as it seems on the surface.

This merely my opinion, Sir.

ISvaraarpaNamastu
