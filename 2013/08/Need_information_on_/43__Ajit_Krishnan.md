Somehow, many Sanskrit enthusiasts are under the mistaken impression that
Samskrita Bharati wants to change the language. And that Samskrita Bharati
wants to promote usages that are not found commonly in shishtacara beyond
the initial bootstrap phase. And that this organization wants to promote
usages that are against Panini at any point in time.

Samskrita Bharati started publishing the Sambhashana Sandesha magazine back
in September of 1994. The very first issue had an article titled
"saMgyA-shabdAnAm saMskRte vyavahAra-prakAraH". This was written by Sri N.
Ranganatha Sharma, then a retired prAdhyApaka of vyakarana from the
Bangalore Samskrita Mahapathashala. The second issue had an articled titled
"samgyAshabdAnAm prayogaH". This was written by T. Srinivasa Ayyangar,
another prAdhyApaka of vyakarana at the pathashala.

Please reflect on the fact that these articles, written by qualified
panditas, appeared in the inaugural issues of the magazine. It really shows
the depths to which this organization is trying *not* to change the
language.

I have uploaded the relevant pages of the magazines to the link above.
Obviously, they are in Sanskrit. Please read them to understand the
thinking underlying these prayogas. And, if you think that you have a
better *solution*, please provide it.

Please read the article. It will help put many things into perspective.

sasneham,
