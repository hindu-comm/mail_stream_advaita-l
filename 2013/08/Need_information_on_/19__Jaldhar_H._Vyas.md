I don't know where in the US you are but before looking for a teacher over 
skype, please check if you can find a teacher you can meet face-to-face. 
In metropolitan areas it shouldn't be impossible to atleast learn 
sandhyavandana and other nityakarmas that way though more advanced study 
will be harder to manage.  Bottom line is skype should be your last 
resort but better to take it if there is no other choice than to remain 
ignorant.

Also I urge anyone in your position to emphasize a study of sanskrit and 
shastras even above Vedas (except for nityakarma mantras) because that 
will set the foundation for making it easier for the next generation to 
progress.

I don't know about guilt but that bharatavarsha is a superior karmabhumi 
and punyabhumi is undisputed.  Not being there definitely shouldn't be an 
excuse for shirking ones duty though.

Um you're not making a good case for living abroad if ISKCON is your 
example!

I'm curious why not shikha?  That is one of the easiest vedic vidhis to 
follow.

I won't lie, yes it is.  But not impossible if you try and I offer myself 
as an example.  I wasn't even born in India (UK to be precise) but people 
seem to think I'm doing a decent job of it.  Ultimately "difficulty" is in 
the eye of the beholder.  I'm sure even in the middle of Tirupati or Kashi 
there are people making excuses about how hard it is.

True but do you think the same isn't true in Mumbai or Chennai or even in 
small villages?

No use.  But mere location alone will not increase or decrease desires. 
That is also in the individuals hands.
