Hare Krishna! I don't think there should be any guilt about living in a foreign land. Let people in Indian celebrate Krishna Janmashtami at a scale they do in London and then lay claim to glory of vedic heritage. At least let them stop looting the temples. The vedic culture was perhaps global but is today going international. The life style and customs have been changing in recorded history and will continue to. Chanting vedas is a sophisticated form of upasana  and bhakti is the key ingredient here as well. 

For yajur veda, we have an ongoing online skype class (free), which my dedicated teacher (Balaji Sastrigal) will take whenever you are available. The expectation is for you to follow dress code (sans shikha)and nityakarmAnushtanam, in which I hope  you are more regular than I am :) Also he expects you to return to Bharatha Bhoomi at some future date.  

For sama veda, my teacher (Srinivasa Sastrigal) referred me to one Vaidyanatha Sastrigal who is skilled in skype etc. I will check and let you know - drop a note to rajaramvenk at gmail.com. 

All  sama vedins with basic recitation skills interested in understanding srauta karma and willing to take a sabbatical to go to Sringeri also please let me know - welcome to join me. If students join, it is less effort for teacher.

Subject: [Advaita-l] Need information on learning Vedas online

SrigurubhyO namaH

Respected members,

I live in USA and I want to learn Yajurveda and Samaveda. I request you to
let me know if you are aware of anybody who may be teaching these online
(Skype/Google Talk etc.). I would really appreciate any help/guidance in
this matter. While I am aware that this is certainly not the most ideal way
of learning vedas, it is a meek compromise I have to make between living in
a foreign land and satisfying my desire to learn vedas.

sarve bhadrANi pashyantu,
Shreekrishna.
