Your previous mails asserted that they have huge finances; you didn't ask a
question. And you are still comparing apples and oranges. Samskrita Bharati
does not have to run temples or Mathas or Veda Pathasalas. It does not
maintain fixed properties spread across the country that have been inherited
over many centuries and it does not have to deal with numerous other kinds
of problems that an old Matha has.

Can you step back a bit and see how downright insulting and condescending you
are when you write in this vein? As I mentioned before, you are not even partially
correct in what you take to be the facts.



Frankly, the real problem today is that everybody says they want leadership from
the Mathas, but nobody is prepared to actually listen to and implement what the
leaders from the Mathas are actually saying. As far as Sringeri Matha is concerned,
I suggest you pay close attention to the materials available at websites like
vijayayatra.sringeri.net and www.sringeri.net.



Finally, if you know for certain that you have solutions to problems, why don't you
step in and do something about it, rather than criticizing Sannyasis, who according
to you, do nothing more simply spend time sitting around? You think they are
leading comfortable lives with piles of cash. What sort of leadership can they really
provide you and what sort of follower will you be for someone you don't respect?
