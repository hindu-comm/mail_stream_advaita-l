Recitation (svAdhyAya) is important no doubt but the vedas also have a 
practical use.  They are not just some super bhajan.  In particular 
diligent performance of nitya and naimittika karma is a must for all 
Brahmanas.  Thus knowing the mantras and procedure for that is top 
priority but after that there are other things.

Today everyone and anyone are claiming vedic this and vedic that.  There 
is so much bad information out there (E.g. this Vidushekhara Bhattacharya 
affair.) and it is less likely ou will be misled by the unscrupulous if 
you are well-informed.  This is a particular concern for those who are 
isolated from the astika community whether insider bharat or outside.

Also if we are going to be established outside of Vedic cultures 
traditional environment (again in India or outside) we need to build up a 
proper infrastructure to ensure our continued progress.  Too many times 
I've seen people get overenthusiastic, bite off more than they can chew 
and then flame out.  And n particular we who are parents need to be 
literate so we can ensure our children are dharmically literate.

As you increase your sanskrit knowledge, you will find translations to be 
crutches you can increasingly do without.
