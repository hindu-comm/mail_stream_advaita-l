Very well said, Sir.

A healthy, harmonious alignment between knowledge of the scholars and  the
huge fluid energy, the enthusiasm and the dedicated executive cadre of
Samskrita Bharati (and the like) would be a great combination..

While the youthfulness of the zealous dedicated executive energies are
indispensably necessary for any 'good work of worth', it is the close
regulation of these energies from a maturity of a steady & unwavering,
wisdom that refuses to be carried away by the currents of the moment, can
reign in where it is needed, that ensures that the energetic 'work' is
'good and worthy'.

One day, or the other, this has to happen, in some form, in full measure,
going by the noble, laudable and impeccably good intentions of SB.
