it depends on the nature of learning and the intent. If the intent is to learn enough to undertake prayogam (suktams used during abhishekam etc...) then IMO undertaking a serious study of sayana and bhattabaskara etc... is not required.

For example, sandhyavandhanam is replete with veda mantras and there is no prerequisite to understanding the intricate meanings of the mantras.

I do agree that having an understanding of the rituals and the import of the mantras are essential but not a detailed study.

I do agree knowing sanskrit is essential for understanding puranas and slokams/ashtakams etc were the literal meaning is sufficient but not enough for veda mantras

Vishwam

//
I thought it is highly desirable to learn Vedas more than Sanskrit.

arthamajAnAnAM nAnAvidhashabdamAtrapATavatAM

The meaning:

Without knowing the meaning and essence of the mantras, the japa & parayana of the same is like a donkey that carries the load of the sandalwood. The donkey neither knows the importance of the sandalwood nor the odour of the sandalwood. 

Chanting of vedas and mantras without bhASAjnAna is compared with the above donkey. 

There is always a lack if bhASa jnAna is not there. The rasAnubhUti would not be there. 

Even to understand the vEda bhASya like sAyaNa, one should know sanskrit.

regs,
sriram
