Some figures will explain Samskrita Bharati.

Today this movement has flowered into an International Organization
operating in 14 countries and touching the lives of millions worldwide.
There are 110 full time volunteers who have pledged their life for the
cause and thousands of such dedicated volunteers since the inception have
served the movement. A strong team of 70000 Samskrit trainers has been
developed who work in more than 2400 centres across the country. *Samskrit
is now the fastest growing language in the world*, with more than 80 Lakh
Indians having participated in about 1,26,000 â€˜Spoken Samskritâ€™ Camps
organized free of cost so far by Samskrita Bharati. Samskrit serves as the
thread which binds together the entire nation transcending the
barriers of caste,regions
& languages.

 Question now is what are the figures for Sringeri and other Maths? How
many people? How many centres? How many people trained? Compare and see
yourself how Samskrita Bharati is contributing a lot and not so much the
other Maths. If they have huge finances why they are lagging?

Throwing money at a problem is not a way to bring long-lasting change.

Sringeri Swamiji in the Anugraha speech in Bangalore said Adi Sankara came
to establish Dharma also like Krishna. Yada Yada hi Dharmasya Glanir
Bhavati Bharata. But difference is Adi Sankara did not kill demons like
Krishna. He destroyed ignorance and bad Doctrines of other beliefs. He did
not say everyone should simply stop all Vedic activities and become
Sannyasis.  It is the foremost duty of Maths of Adi Sankara to establish
Dharma also like him. If they teach only Sannyasa they are not following
Adi Sankara. They have to establish Vaidika Marga firmly and encourage
Sanskrit learning also.

Leaders are needed. Leaders from Maths have to lead others first. They
cannot simply sit comfortably in Maths and spend time.
