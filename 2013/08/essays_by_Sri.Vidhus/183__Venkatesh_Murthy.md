Namaste

Vidhusekhara Bhattacharya has edited Buddhist book Mahayanavimsaka of
Nagarjuna

http://www.amazon.com/Mahayanavimsaka-Trisvabhavanirdesa-Vidhusekhara-Bhattacharya/dp/0895819953

'The Mahayanavimsaka is a brief work attributed to Nagarjuna that
summarizes the Madhyamaka or "Middle Way" philosophy in only twenty verses.
The Trisvabhavanirdesa of Vasubandhu similarly summarizes the fundamental
Yogacara teaching of the "three natures" of all things in only thirty-eight
verses. They are among the most concise formulations known of the two great
Mahayana schools. These hard-to-find texts are here brought together for
the first time, forming a compact and authoritative sourcebook of the two
most
influential Buddhist philosophies, Madhyamaka and Yogacara. Included are
the Sanskrit and Tibetan texts.'
