Namaste,


T. M. P. Mahadevan´s refutation of Vidhushekhara Bhattacharya can be
studied in T. M. P. Mahadevan´s book "Gaudapada: A Study in Early Advaita".
This book consists of 292 pages, and was published by University of Madras
in 1960. It´s a fairly rare book, but not impossible to find.

Best regards
Shivashankar
