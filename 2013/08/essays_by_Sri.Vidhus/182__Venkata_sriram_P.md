I'm not familiar with his traditional scholarship but Vidhushekhara 
Bhattacharya is well known amongst Indologists as a scholar specializing 
in Buddhism.

//

He was professor of sanskrit at Calcutta University and was conferred the 
title "mahAmahOpAdhyAya" in 1936 by Govt. of Bengal. 

Vishwabharati University conferred the title "dEsikOttama" in 1957.

He used to teach sanskrit to Sri Rabindranath Tagore.

Probably, one of our members Sri Niranjan Saha can throw more light
on his publications.
