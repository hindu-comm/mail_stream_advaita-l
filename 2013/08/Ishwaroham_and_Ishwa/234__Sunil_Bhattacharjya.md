Namaste,

One must realize that talking about Krishna's having Krishna bhakti is really weird. When the Jnani-bhakta realizes that he himself is Krishna where is the question of his having bhakti for Krishna. To me this seems so plain and simple.

Regards,
Sunil KB

Suffice it to say, nay, remind, that:


  1. In Advaita bhakti towards the saguNa Ishwara is not impossible
  2. A niguNa brahma jnani can have such bhakti
  3. The expression of such bhakti is possible ONLY till the end of
  jivanmukti for such a jnani who has devotion to a saguNa mUrti
  4. In (videha) mukti there is no bhakti.


The last point two points are only re-phrasing of what MDS told me during a
conversation: muktiyil bhakt kiDayAdu. jIvanmukti paryantam irukkalAm,
avvaLavuthAn.

regards
vs
