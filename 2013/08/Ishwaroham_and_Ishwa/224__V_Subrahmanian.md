Suffice it to say, nay, remind, that:


   1. In Advaita bhakti towards the saguNa Ishwara is not impossible
   2. A niguNa brahma jnani can have such bhakti
   3. The expression of such bhakti is possible ONLY till the end of
   jivanmukti for such a jnani who has devotion to a saguNa mUrti
   4. In (videha) mukti there is no bhakti.


The last point two points are only re-phrasing of what MDS told me during a
conversation: muktiyil bhakt kiDayAdu. jIvanmukti paryantam irukkalAm,
avvaLavuthAn.
