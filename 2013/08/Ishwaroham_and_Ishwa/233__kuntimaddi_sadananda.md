PraNAms
God bless Shree Rajaramji. He givesan opportunity for us all to dwell in Advaita philosophy and why one should have clear vision of absolute truth and shows how or why one should follow a sampradayik teacher togain this understanding ofadvaita - shrotavyaH, mantavyaH and nidhidhyaasitavyaH. 
Hari Om!

I am sure had Adi Sankaracharya been alive today he would have surely told us to leave him alone as he will never be able to understand the Advaita standpoint. It also does not matter to us if he thinks we do not understand his view point and if he thinks the principle of Advaita is wrong. We can probably tell him that "let us agree to disagree". If you think otherwise you may kindly tell me.
