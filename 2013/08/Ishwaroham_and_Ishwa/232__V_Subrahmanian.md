As I have stated before too, in the 'syllabus' of Advaita, the above work/s
have no place.  There is enough material within the prasthAnatraya bhAShya
for knowing the correct view of bhakti in advaita. And none of the
bhashya-s arrive at a conclusion that involves a nitya bhakti in videha
mukti. As I have mentioned before, for bhakti to operate there have to be
minimum two entities, which is not admissible in advaita.  Bhakti
culminates in realizing that one's svarupa is jnana or jnapti where there
is no subject-object division.

[I had already hinted at this: ananda could be equated to jnana, if it is
intended to be eternal.]

All this will give room to the fallacy of the liberated coming back to
samsara.  It is alright to say that the gopis are all liberates souls, only
enacting the lila to enjoy the company of the Lord, in order to enthuse a
sadhaka to cultivate devotion.  To proffer it as the siddhanta would be
wrong and therefore unacceptable. Also, what is the use of talking of those
constructs which are only in the vyvahara? We want a construct that will
free us from the vyavahara while the construct itself gets dissolved.  The
construct of adhyaropa-apavada taught in the shankara bhashya is the best,
unmatched one.   It has enough room for bhakti that is necessary for
advaita sadhana/realization.  All other constructs are of no consequence in
the light of the shankara bhashya.  It  pays a lot to correctly understand
the paramarthika stand when/where all that is stated above as
mirror/reflections/ishwara/maya/lila etc. will be nullified in one go.  If
this is not understood, there is no point in going over the same things
endlessly.
