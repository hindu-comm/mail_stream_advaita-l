The topic from my point is the issue what was discussed or attributed to Shreedhara swamin by you, as I have never read what he said. I am interested in the issues that were discussed not individuals. Reverence to all acharyas is never compromised from my point. Reverence to the knowledge absolute is also not compromised.
