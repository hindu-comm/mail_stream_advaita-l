Namaste Sadaji,

I have one curiosity as to why we do not leave Rajaramji alone. I am sure had Adi Sankaracharya been alive today he would have surely told us to leave him alone as he will never be able to understand the Advaita standpoint. It also does not matter to us if he thinks we do not understand his view point and if he thinks the principle of Advaita is wrong. We can probably tell him that "let us agree to disagree". If you think otherwise you may kindly tell me.

Regards,
Sunil KB

Do you accept eka jiva vada? According to that,no one is really liberated.
So, if you say there is no bhakti in mukti, I will say there is no mukti,
so only bhakti.
