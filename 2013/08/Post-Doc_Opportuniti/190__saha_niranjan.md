Dear members,

Pranam! I did contact Professors Hardmann, Zydenboss etc. there, but their research orientation focuses mainly on Kingship, Tibetian Buddhim etc. differing from my area of research Advaita Vedanta etc. (I've submitted my PhD dissertation on Madhusudana Sarasvati's Gitagudharthadipika at SOAS, Univ. of London, and await examiners' reports shortly).

best rgs,
N.Saha, Kolkata

Subject: [Advaita-l] Post-Doc Opportunities in Indian Philosophy at Ludwig	Maximilians University


I came across this on a Sanskrit blog. For those interested in post-doc
opportunities in South Asian/Indian Philosophy/Sanskrit/etc. please see
announcement below.
======================================

Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität (LMU) in *Munich* is one of the leading
European universities with a tradition reaching back more than 500 years.
The university has established the Graduate School "Distant Worlds: Munich
Graduate School for Ancient Studies", which has been funded by the German
Excellence Initiative since November 1st, 2012. As part of its doctoral
study and
 postdoctoral training programme, the Graduate School combines
research from a broad spectrum of disciplines within the field of ancient
studies.

The Graduate School invites applications of young researchers specializing
in Classics, Chinese or Indian Studies as well as the Ancient Near East for
the following positions:


3 post- doc positions
Salary Grade 13 TV-L / 100%
The starting date will be *November 1, 2013*.
The positions are limited to *two years; they may be extended by a third
year*.
Each of the positions will coordinate a junior research group. The research
groups are orientated towards one of the seven focus areas of the School.

*Responsibilities*
Successful candidates will conduct an independent research project
contributing to one of the seven focus areas, to be chosen by the
candidates themselves. In pursuing their research, candidates will be
supported by
 mentors.

*They will collaborate with doctoral students in an interdisciplinary
junior research group and coordinate the activities of that group*.

They will develop new research perspectives in the field of ancient studies
together with the members of the Münchner Zentrum für Antike Welten.


*Requirements*
In order to apply, candidates will need to have completed their doctorate
in the field of ancient studies with outstanding results. Applicants will
need to submit a proposal for an independent research project. They should
demonstrate their willingness to work in an interdisciplinary context as
well as an interest in basic and theoretical questions. *We are especially
interested in candidates whose research projects relate to the following
focus areas: "Organisation of coexistence", "Organisation of exchange",
"Organisation of elites".*

The School offers the scope for developing new
 perspectives in an inspiring
research environment.


Disability and equal opportunities
Applicants with disabilities possessing essentially equal qualifications
will be given preference. LMU Munich is an equal opportunity employer
committed to excellence through diversity and therefore explicitly
encourages women to apply.


Application process
For further information see:  www.mzaw.uni-muenchen.de/dw

Applications must be submitted electronically in German or English *by
September 23, 2013* to mzaw at lmu.de
==================================
All the best.
Mangesh
