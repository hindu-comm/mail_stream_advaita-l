Well, those above cited pramANa-s are talking about Consciousness of
Brahman/SriKrishna, but not yours.  Our dispute started with you
questioning the reality of objects based on **your** consciousness as
pramatar. Now someone else's  consciousness is shown as evidence. If
it is further argued that they are the same, then I say that such
identity cannot be made unless you deny the reality of external
objects. You cannot deny it unless you equate your consciousness with
Consciousness of SriKrishna. That sounds like a circular to me.

More over, your very quoting of those scriptural evidence itself is an
**evidence** that your consciousness did not know that Truth to begin
with but has to depend on that scriptures, which is quite "external"
to your consciousness. Your evidence proves the contrary to your
position at the end. As a pramatar you have a very dependency on
external scriptures in order  to know that they are not real but only
you are the real. That is  invalid, because at the root of your
conclusion there exist your dependency on the scriptures.

That is the talk of avidya.

Shankara clearly says "sasharIrasya mithyAjnAna nimittatvAt",  and
also in another place "nirasyopAdhi sambandham jneyatvena upadisyate"
(I think BSB 1.1.12 )

But that "qualified Acharya" must be unreal because his existence is
*depend* on your consciousness?
