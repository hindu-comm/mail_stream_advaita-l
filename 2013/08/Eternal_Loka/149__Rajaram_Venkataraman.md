RV: I have not responded point by point to your posts but in essence in
response to Shri Subrahmanian.

 RV: Self knowledge is there deep sleep just as the power of sight is there
in a dark room but as the mind is inactive, it does not realise it (self
knowledge) just as without light there is no realisation of the power of
sight in a dark room. In the case of Ishwara, there is no dependence of an
extraneous entity. Maya does not cover His jnana even during yoga nidra.
Also, it is present in Him as Himself.

RV: The person I call Vasudeva is the Parameshwara. I may worship in a few
forms that I like most. You can use a different word that is less silly but
mainstream *contemporary* advaita does not admit of having Krishna Bhakti
as the supreme goal, Madhusudana and Sridhara established that Bhagavad
Bhakti as Supreme.
