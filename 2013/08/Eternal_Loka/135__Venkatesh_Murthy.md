We can see this kind of thought coming in Sri Bhashya of Ramanuja 2 - 1 - 15

Sarvaa Hi Shrutayaha SaSmruti Itihaasa Puraanaaha Sarveshvareshvaram
Sadaiva Sarvajnam Sarvashaktim Satyasankalpam Niravadyam Deshakaala
Anavacchinna Anavadhika Atishayaanandam Paramkaaranam Brahma
Pratipaadayanti  - Na Punar Ishvaraadapi Param Ishvaraamshi Sanmaatram

All Shrutis, Smrutis, Itihasa and Puranas explain the Supreme Cause Brahma
who is none other than the Lord of all Lords always Sarvajna and all
powerful and Satya Sankalpa and free from defects and without restrictions
of Place and Time and always full of Joy. But not Pure Existence Sanmaatra
higher than Ishwara and having Ishwara as a Part.

It is very true.  Geetaachaarya Krishna has said the best Bhakta is Jnani.
Jnani Tu Atmaiva Me Matam. BG 7 - 18 The other bhaktas talking excitedly
about Krishna dancing and enjoying with Gopis is entertainment only.
