You probably meant su-tarka? :) 

Ishwara in advaita survives mahapralaya also. In one sense, He even survives jnana as a liberated soul becomes parameshwara according to Jaimini and Appayya. It is only recently He has been killed by the sword of ignorance. It is comical to claim to be advaitins and go against what acharyas have written about eternality of Ishwara.

In Eka Jeeva Vada if Ishwara is in my dream how can he become eternal? If
my dream ends he will not be there.

In "kutarka" it can. If one undertsands the principles there is no need to play with words and try to prove what is not provable.

Namaste

In Eka Jeeva Vada if Ishwara is in my dream how can he become eternal? If
my dream ends he will not be there.

If you are saying my dream will never end it is against Sabda Pramana. If
you are saying Ishwara is eternal as long as dream is there it is
contradicting statement. Because Eternal means Always and for all
conditions. Only Nirguna Brahma is Eternal. Ishwara and World are not
eternal. Vaikuntha and Kailasa are not eternal. You and all these Jeevas
are not eternal. Only I Nirguna Brahma am eternal.
