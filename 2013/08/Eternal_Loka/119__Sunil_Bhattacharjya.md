Namaste,

It will be nice if you can share with us that great verse which Appaya dikshita composed in his delirium conditions. 

Regards,

"Appayya Dikshitar was doubtful of how deep his devotion to Lord Siva was.
He asked his disciples to make a potion from UmattangAi that will make him
lose control of his mind and speak. In the state of delirium, he composed a
great verse on Lord Siva."

Umatta (Datura sp) is known for centuries as a hallucinogenic and a
deliriant. Its pharmacological effects are now known. It contains tropane
alkaloids and can prove fatal in higher doses. In ancient India, this plant
was considered a favourite of Shiva. Not only in India, in other continents
too it was under use for altered states of the mind like ayahusca,
marijuana etc.

regards,
