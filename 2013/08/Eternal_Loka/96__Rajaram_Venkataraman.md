Hare Krishna. I am glad that you admit that maya sabalitha brahman is
eternal and not merged in to parabrahman on pralaya.  There are others on
this forum who dont accept that Ishwara is eternal even in this sense. They
state that He gets merged in to parabrahman on pralaya.

We call Him differently. I call Him Vasudeva, Narayana, Ishwara, Vishnu
etc. or you call It Non-Person. It is a semantic difference. We both agree
that this Ishwara, maya sabalitha brahman, beyond all particular names and
forms is the container of names and forms and eternal. This is who / what
is called the Vaikuntha by Bhagavatam and Sridhara.  Where does Appayya
Dikshitar say that this Vaikuntha or Vishnu is non-eternal? If Ishwara is a
concept, so are all vyavahara satyams.

As to the significance of all these vyavahara realities for a vedantins, a
mukta becomes this Ishwara. As you must know, Appayya Dikshitar takes up
the question of whether a mukta becomes Parabrahman or this Ishwara and
asserts that he becomes Ishwara.
