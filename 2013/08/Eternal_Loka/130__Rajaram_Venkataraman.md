> RV : By introducing " by courtesy", you are reducing the weight age that
Badarayana and Sankara assign to Jaimini's view. You are also making it
impossible to admit eka jiva vada where jnanis in sastras and the world
have only attained oneness with Ishwara.

commentary of Periyava. BTW, Madhusudana clearly talks about two paths -
bhakti and jnana. IMO, Sankara does too.
