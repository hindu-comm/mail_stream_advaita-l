What is the point in answering the above question?  'Eternal' and fixing a
limit to it are contradictory.

In the Taittiriya up. bhAShyam for the mantra 'asad vA idam agra AsIt'
[2.7.1] Shankara comments:

//By 'asat' avyAkRtam (undifferentiated) brahman which is distinct from the
differentiated distinct names and forms is meant.'  This is not absolutely
non-existence, since there can be no effect issuing forth from
non-existence.  By the word 'idam' the distinctly experiencable world of
names and forms is meant.  Prior to the creation of the distinctly
available world, brahman alone, denoted by the word 'asat' existed.//

>From this it is known that during pralaya avasthA the qualified brahman,
the seed of the yet-to-manifest creation, existed.  This is Ishwara.  We do
not specify a loka, abode, for this Ishwara, for there is no need for such
a specification.  All the potential creation is 'in' this Ishwara (which is
itself a mAyA-tinged sentient entity).  If it is insisted that an abode  be
specified, we can say: it is the nirguNa brahman that is the substratum on
which this Ishwara containing the creation in potential form before
creation, and in manifest form after creation, rests.  It should be
remembered that Ishwara is not a person with a definite unchanging form.
It is a concept.

As I have said before, Appayya dikshitar has said that the very same brahma
loka (which too goes into pralaya) appears as shiva loka for shiva upasakas
and vishnu loka for vishnu upasakas.   Still it is not 'eternal'.  It is
within creation.
