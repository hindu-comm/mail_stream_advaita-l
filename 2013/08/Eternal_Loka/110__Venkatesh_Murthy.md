Namaste

Very nice response showing Adi Sankara's crystal clear thoughts. The Vishnu
and Siva Murtis are for Upasana only. If  you read
Vishnu and Bhagavatam Purana you can see Siva is praying to Vishnu. In Siva
Purana you can see Vishnu is praying to Siva. In Saundarya Lahari you can
see all gods are praying to the Goddess, For each Bhakta his own Ishta
Devata is greatest. All Devatas are for Upasana only. They are not eternal.
Bhakta has to accept Jnana Marga finally.

Advaitins will understand this and not get into fights with Vaishnavas and
Saivas.
