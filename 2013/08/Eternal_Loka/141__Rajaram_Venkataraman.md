RV: As per eka jiva vada you are (I am) in vyavahara, whether you, a
jivabhasa, think you are liberated or bound. All the bound and liberated
entities in your dream are in you, who are in reality the mukhya jIva, who
is the sarvajna Ishwara, non-different from brahman. Madhusudana Saraswati
has rightly combined eka jiva vada, drshti srshti vada and pratibimba vada
as all schools of advaita and for that matter all schools of thought are
special cases of this. (He also uses it to give bhakti the highest
ontological position matched only by gaudiya vaishnavas, if at all).

RV: You, as a liberated jiva bhasa, may assume Audulomi's view. I, as a
bound jiva bhasa, may assume Jaimini's view. You may think that your view
is right and superior where as my view is acceptable from my ignorant
perspective. I will think that my view is right and in reality your view is
my view only projected on you by me through my kalpana shakti. The
paramartika view of yours owes its existence to my vyavahara sthithi. It is
a dependent reality and hence mine is superior.

RV: I realised the  bhakti-prAdhAnya Gita Bhashya and for that matter
Brahma Sutra Bhashya of Sankara. I was introduced to Madhusudana after I
told someone that Gita Bhashya of Sankara is a Bhakti Sastra.

RV: Then they are not scholars or their intelligence is destroyed by
bhagavat apachara. There are countless verses but let me just quote two
from karma yoga chapter.
*yajnarthat karmano 'nyatra* *loko 'yam karma-bandhanah* *tad-artham karma
kaunteya* *mukta-sangah samacara (3.13)*
*mayi sarvani karmani* *sannyasyadhyatma-cetasa* *nirasir nirmamo
bhutva* *yudhyasva
vigata-jvarah (3.30) *
**
Veda samhitas are devotional hymns. They are sAkshAt Ishwara.

RV: You have not been taught bhakti in advaita but only jnana or at
best jnana misra bhakti. You find me wrong because you dont understand
suddha bhakti that Sridhara and Madhusudana talk about.

Could you point out at least one  typical instance in the GD to
demonstrate: the 'problem' stated in clear terms by MS and the solution MS
gives for it?

RV: In common understanding, bhakti involves duality and needs the
instrument of body and mind. It is a means to citta suddhi and is not the
ultimate goal. There can be no bhagavat bhakti on the dawn of non-dual
realisation. You are pure existence or objectless consciousness. This may
mean nothing to you who is only trained in jnana yoga but is a serious
problem for a bhakti yogi. He would rather give up videha mukti than give
up Ishwara (i). All schools were opposed to Advaita only because of its
treatment of bhagavad bhakti as a means and not an end in itself. This is
the problem that Madhusudana solve by showing that bhagavad bhakti is at
the same level as brahma jnanam. The problem is not inherent to advaita
tradition but more due to a misunderstanding of Sankara by rigid followers
of jnana marga. I suggest you read Lance Nelson's thesis to understand the
problem and then I will explain how I resolved the problems he found with
Madhsudana's treatment of bhakti. I also confirmed my understanding with
Mani Dravid Sastrigal. I will post separately titled Philiosophy of Bhakti
in Advaita.

RV: Madhsudana considers dualists not true vaishnavas. Bhakti is not an
action done to please the Lord. In advaita, Bhakti is the Lord Himself as
Madhusudana rightly points out.

RV: Having temporary visions of Ishwara, albeit a good experience, is not
the same as bhakti rasa as explained by Sridhara and Madhusudana. I believe
some of the advaita acharyas had bhakti rasAnubhava.  Mani Dravid Sastrigal
believes acharyas had bhaktirasAnubhava and said he will look for pramanas
to support the theory. If they did not teach you bhakti rasa, it may
because you were too pre-occupied with moksha and philosophicale  analysis.
