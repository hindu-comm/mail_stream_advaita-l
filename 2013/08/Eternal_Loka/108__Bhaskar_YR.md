If you don't answer the question what happens to Ishwara (mayasabalitha 
brahman) on pralaya, then you can say He is non-eternal. 

>  when shankara says Ishwara with his mAyOpAdi is kevala vyAvahArika 
satya which is avidyAkruta & there is no Ishwara & ishitavya in 
paramArtha, we could  see the thought process  of shankara on mAyOpAdhi 
Ishwara in paramArtha. 

Also, if you ignore Appayya Dikshita or for that matter Jaimini in Brahma 
Sutra where the mukta is to become one with Parameshwara, then again you 
can say that Ishwara is non-eternal (non-existent). 

> I've not read jaimini's sUtra bhAshya, but shankara is quite clear about 
Ishwara tattva when it comes to paramArtha.  No need to mention advaitins 
in general  prefer shankara's bhAshya to all other commentaries when it 
comes to siddhAnta nirNaya.  parameva hi brahma vishuddhOpAdhi saMbandhaM 
kvachit kaichidvikAra dharmaiH manOmayatvAdhibhiH upAsanAyOpadishyamAnaM 
aparamiti stithiH...clarifies shankara...So, what you say about mAyA 
shabAlita brahma is nothing but apara brahma according to shankara which 
is meant for upAsaNa where as apara brahman is completely free from any 
type of upAdhi (sarvOpAdhi vivarjitaM).

Hari Hari Hari Bol!!!
bhaskar
