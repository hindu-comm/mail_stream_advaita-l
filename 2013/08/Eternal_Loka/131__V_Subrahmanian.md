That the very concept of time is within vyavahara and absolute does not
admit of any time.  That is why in the si.le.san. you find the word
'yAvatsarvamuktiH' where the term yAvat means 'till such time'.  If you
understand that jIvas' bondage is only till such a time and that in truth
there is no bondage or liberation, there would be no room for delving on
that.

You failed to see the term '**व्यवहारा**पेक्षया' by Shankara which is what
warranted the 'by courtesy'.  In Vedanta the very discourse on bandha and
mukti is by courtesy, to accommodate ignorant ones.

How do you know?  While Ishwara itself is an introduction, an adhyAropa, by
Vedanta for helping understanding of the Brahman beyond Ishwaratva, only to
be dropped in the final understanding, how can you hold that jnanis attain
Ishwara and remain eternally so?  Did I not point out that the Br.Up.
precludes the sUkshma sharIra's departure from the jnani's body upon
death?  Such being the case where is the individuality that will persist
in/as Ishwara eternally for a Jnani?  In fact, there is no such an entity
called jnani upon death.  Also, I pointed out, from the nyAyarakshaamaNi
where Appayya himself has clarified his statement on Ishwara prApti for a
jnani in the si.le.sang. by saying that since Brahmachaitanyam is the
substrate for the jiva and Ishwara, the jnani being none other than
brahman, is admitted to be everything.  What is difficult in this, keeping
in mind that even this is only vyAvahArika, as pointed by Shankara, in the
jaimini-view?

To which verse is the above commentary?

Where does Madhusudana and Shankara specify two paths?

Can't you see from that bhashyam that the very concept of Ishwara is
upAdhi-dependent?  And such upAdhi is ignorance-created?  And that when
ignorance is destroyed the upAdhis are destroyed and Ishwaratvam itself
ceases to exist?  What more do you need Shankara to state?  There can be no
greater clarity than here on the ultimate non-existence of
Ishwara/Ishvaratvam.  In fact the very idea of Ishwaratvam is in the realm
of ignorance-created duality.  So, when duality is negated
Ishwara/Ishwaratvam automatically gets negated.  That is what Shankara
explicitly, not implicitly, states in that sentence.

I think it is better for you to take time off to contemplate on the various
inputs provided here instead of raising questions requiring same answers in
different words.
