with Ishwara as it tantamounts to superimposing on him characterisitcs of
Ishwara. From a paramartika point of view, you dont have either bondage or
liberation.

RV: In Siddhantalesa Sangraha, Appayya Dikshitar  takes up the question
whether a mukta attains oneness with Parameshwara or Nirguna Brahman. He
says that a jiva attains oneness with Ishwara and not Nirguna Brahman. He
explains that a jIvA is a reflection of Ishwara and is non-different from
Ishwara because (in pratibimba vAdA) bimba and pratibimba are identical.
When a jIvA gets liberated, the mirror of ajnAna(sthula and sukshuma
sarira) pertaining to that jIva is destroyed but the jIvA continues to
exist as Ishwara. Until all jIvAs get liberated, which will happen after
infinite time or in other words never, Ishwara will continue to exist as
their bimba. Therefore no jIvA can attain the ultimate salvation when the
world is totally dissolved until all jIvas are liberated. Hence the term
"sarva mukti". The same sthula sarira does not return for any one. The
sukshuma sarira does not return for a jnani. But even a jnani remains
forever in the memory, if we can call it that, of the omniscient Ishwara.

I had a follow up discussion with Sri Mani Dravid Sastrigal to confirm the
understanding. If you think I misunderstood, we can have a joint call.
